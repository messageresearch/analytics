[35:38] and
[35:40] so
[35:41] yes we are going to enjoy ourselves just
[35:43] a little bit
[35:45] reminds me of a little video clip
[35:48] of a
[35:49] pastor baptizing a young girl cute
[35:52] little girl
[35:54] and he's talked to her and she's like
[35:56] yes yes i i've
[35:58] asked the lord forgive me
[36:00] and
[36:01] yes and the pastor says now sweetheart
[36:04] after you get baptized and get the holy
[36:05] ghost where are you going
[36:08] disneyland
[36:12] so we're not exactly on that par
[36:16] but we might be
[36:19] but
[36:20] anyway please remember us in prayer and
[36:24] brother david's going to be preaching
[36:26] this coming wednesday sunday and the
[36:29] following wednesday so be lifting our
[36:31] brother david up in prayer
[36:33] that um
[36:35] the lord will just lay upon his heart
[36:37] just one
[36:39] of those 50 or 100 sermons that he has
[36:42] waiting
[36:43] just to choose the right the correct
[36:46] ones amen
[36:47] and
[36:48] so
[36:49] um
[36:50] i would ask that you uh would also
[36:53] remember uh brother vasily and sister
[36:56] toma they haven't been feeling well
[36:59] their heart's desire was to be in the
[37:01] house of god today
[37:02] and so just lift them up lingering
[37:05] effects of whatever little
[37:07] viruses and different things that might
[37:09] affect us and
[37:11] i believe what i've heard is that sister
[37:13] thomas mother had traveled
[37:16] to see her off
[37:18] and now is
[37:20] somewhere along the way back to danesque
[37:23] uh in russia
[37:25] with believers but she's caught there
[37:27] because of the conflict so
[37:30] please uh just remember and i'm sorry i
[37:32] can't recount what
[37:35] huh
[37:37] she's in russia i believe because they
[37:39] typically go out of kiev
[37:42] and go and go down if i understand right
[37:44] travel through russia and back in
[37:45] because of that occupied zone
[37:48] so let's just remember that and i'm
[37:51] what is sister thomas mother's name
[37:56] nina
[37:57] let's remember our sister in prayer lord
[37:59] be with her
[38:00] and um
[38:02] so also last announcement um or last two
[38:06] things i want to say
[38:07] um we have made great progress in the
[38:10] basement and sisters you have mentioned
[38:12] that when we quit making a mess that
[38:14] many of you had a desire to come and
[38:17] help clean and
[38:18] i believe we really literally are at the
[38:20] end of making a mess so i i say this
[38:23] from my heart just feel free if you have
[38:25] time feel the leading
[38:27] to come and just do your part
[38:30] i know sister sophie and sister grace
[38:32] sister ruth uh come friday evening and
[38:36] they might have gone away feeling like
[38:38] they didn't do a whole lot
[38:40] but i'm telling you every piece of the
[38:41] puzzle right every piece
[38:44] brings a completion of the puzzle
[38:46] so if you can only come for a little bit
[38:49] um
[38:49] you know and just
[38:51] i don't know do one little thing just
[38:52] remember you're you're filling a piece
[38:54] of the puzzle and uh so
[38:57] um
[38:58] just
[38:59] bring that to you the last thing i'm
[39:01] very excited about and we put a lord
[39:04] willing in front of this
[39:05] but our
[39:07] brother andrew
[39:09] is going to come and preach for us lord
[39:11] willing on june 12.
[39:13] and
[39:15] you know he's a fiery young man
[39:17] he gets excited he's not ashamed to jump
[39:20] and shout and yell hallelujah and
[39:24] and we're looking forward to that
[39:27] you know a new dimension i don't know if
[39:28] you know a new dimension in their life
[39:30] sister mariah
[39:32] is due i think middle of august
[39:35] uh with their first child so we're
[39:37] really thrilled for them as just going
[39:41] forward so
[39:42] anyway um
[39:44] brother andrew's been you know he just
[39:46] always keeps in touch he's always
[39:48] encouraging always sending little quotes
[39:50] and
[39:51] you know that's good
[39:53] saints i have something that's been a
[39:55] burden on my heart we brought it up as a
[39:56] prayer request but i want us to just
[39:58] take a moment
[40:00] and from the depths of our hearts
[40:03] as brothers have been sharing with me
[40:08] videos different things
[40:11] showing what's happening and and
[40:14] the ukraine
[40:16] to see
[40:17] as it is literally brothers
[40:20] have just a little bit of food
[40:22] they're not only afraid as it were to go
[40:25] outside
[40:26] but it doesn't matter because the market
[40:28] down the street is completely empty
[40:32] so there's
[40:33] nothing to go out for
[40:35] and
[40:36] the thing that stirs my heart so much
[40:40] and
[40:41] you see the responsive it is some people
[40:44] give up in the time of adversity some
[40:46] dig deeper
[40:48] brothers
[40:50] are having prayer meetings
[40:52] over the phone
[40:55] they don't dare leave their house they
[40:56] don't dare leave their basement
[40:59] and yet
[41:01] they're declaring the battle is not
[41:04] ours the battle is not ours it's the
[41:07] lord's
[41:08] and so as one brother shared this is
[41:12] simply satan trying to disrupt
[41:16] but he can't
[41:17] because the bride as the prophet said
[41:20] the bride is secure
[41:22] in the arms of her bridegroom
[41:25] and so whatever comes
[41:27] they have said
[41:29] thy will be done lord
[41:31] so let's just sincerely lift our hearts
[41:33] here feel free just to just to cry out
[41:36] in your own way
[41:38] remember brother chris what he preached
[41:40] here the other day and we lift our
[41:42] prayers in the morning
[41:43] and we lift our prayers in the evening
[41:45] and they come as a sweet saver before
[41:48] the lord let's lift our prayers this
[41:51] morning
[41:52] on behalf of our brothers and sisters
[41:54] russia
[41:55] ukraine
[41:56] but not just them all of eastern europe
[41:59] is in travail
[42:00] people are nervous people don't know
[42:02] what to do
[42:04] people nervous enough that even in the
[42:06] uh
[42:07] joining countries
[42:10] are already fleeing their borders to
[42:12] pull back
[42:13] just in case russia doesn't stop
[42:16] and so you see that fear is something
[42:19] that's been been just pressing
[42:22] look around us in the world we live in
[42:24] right now there's a fear for everything
[42:27] and satan is trying to press that fear
[42:29] because he knows that if we fall under
[42:31] that anointing of fear
[42:33] we will fear everything
[42:36] even to the place and i won't go into it
[42:38] it's on my sermon today we'll even fear
[42:40] the presence of god
[42:42] under that anointing of fear
[42:45] let's just lift our hearts to the lord
[42:46] for a moment
[42:48] oh heavenly father
[42:50] lord we just cry out to you this morning
[42:54] lord this is the part of the body of
[42:56] believers this is our family lord

[43:02] father many of them already displaced
[43:04] lord many of them unable to go to church
[43:06] unable to see family lord many of them

[43:11] lord and water provision father but lord
[43:14] we know that your hand is upon them and
[43:17] lord as they are anointed by the word to
[43:19] declare my god is in control it is not
[43:22] my battle lord may we enter into that
[43:26] with them lord may our prayers come
[43:28] before you as a sweet odor today on
[43:31] behalf of our brothers and sisters lord
[43:33] and all of those people father
[43:36] and those nations in those areas father
[43:38] they might not know you may this be a
[43:40] season lord that they would be anointed
[43:43] to cry out to you and come close to you
[43:46] father lord it is kind of a shame in
[43:48] humanity that it takes a crisis lord but
[43:51] father whatever is necessary may father
[43:54] this be a time and a season that lord
[43:57] prayers are lifted to you and faith is
[44:00] risen up father to claim the promises
[44:04] now father we ask you lord whatever it
[44:06] is would be your perfect will lord we
[44:09] just desire that father your word decr
[44:12] declares that we would pray for life
[44:15] so lord we're asking you father give
[44:17] provision of water and food and of
[44:20] physical
[44:22] safety father lord come down in such a
[44:25] powerful way lord to raise the faith of
[44:28] the saints father to reach out lord and
[44:31] declare for you said that you would give
[44:33] the desires of the heart and lord these
[44:36] are not desires for worldly pleasure
[44:38] worldly wealth but lord desires for the
[44:41] security of brothers and sisters and of
[44:44] families and children lord we ask you
[44:46] father lord as we stand here today in
[44:49] relative security father we ask you lord
[44:52] to come into the battle and stand on
[44:54] behalf of our brothers and sisters and
[44:57] lord realizing in the day that we live
[44:59] in lord we may never see warfare in our
[45:02] street but lord spiritual warfare is
[45:05] raging around the world as satan knows
[45:07] his time is short and father i ask you
[45:10] just to give security and faith into the
[45:12] heart of your children lord that we
[45:14] would stand holding on to your word
[45:17] claiming your word confessing your word
[45:19] lord we ask now that you would just move
[45:21] even at this moment upon the saints in
[45:24] the ukraine and russia father just lord
[45:26] be their portion i pray today will
[45:29] bolster their faith lord that they might

[45:56] today
[45:58] hallelujah
[46:02] i want to speak to you
[46:05] this morning just a little title of
[46:07] when you see
[46:09] and um you know there comes a time my
[46:11] brother and sister that we'll kind of
[46:13] take hopefully by god's grace expound
[46:16] this a little bit this morning
[46:18] to be able to uh
[46:22] fill out this thought of when you see
[46:25] you know it's a
[46:27] beautiful thing
[46:28] to know my brothers and sisters um
[46:31] that
[46:32] god is present with us
[46:34] also here i wrote a quick note and i
[46:36] forgot it right here just as i was
[46:38] coming out my phone flashed and
[46:41] sister conscious sent a prayer request
[46:43] for brother prashant
[46:45] that he has sprained his neck and it's
[46:48] not getting better so let's just
[46:51] in our prayers this morning amen even as
[46:53] we're moving forward just lift up
[46:55] brother prashant's sister concha
[46:57] to to be with them be their portion
[47:00] today amen let's turn in our bibles to
[47:03] john the sixth chapter
[47:06] i have quite extensive
[47:11] readings out of the book of john so
[47:14] we'll be taking quite a bit of our
[47:16] thought
[47:17] if you have a red letter edition bible
[47:20] you'll see
[47:22] where we're where we're coming from
[47:24] um
[47:26] and as we look at this this morning
[47:31] we want to
[47:32] lay down the thought as it were of
[47:34] seeing
[47:35] and
[47:36] to just analyze it for a moment uh maybe
[47:39] break it down that we'd have a little
[47:41] greater clarity of the scripture
[47:44] and in these things
[47:46] john the sixth chapter starting with the
[47:48] 28th verse
[47:51] then
[47:52] said they unto him what shall we do that
[47:55] we might work the works of god
[47:59] jesus answered and said unto them
[48:01] this is the work of god
[48:05] not ask you this morning who wants to
[48:07] work the works of god
[48:11] now
[48:12] jesus lays out this clear pattern that
[48:15] might been so simple they missed it just
[48:18] on that alone
[48:19] this is the work of god
[48:23] that ye believe on him
[48:25] whom he hath sent
[48:28] now my brother and sister if we have no
[48:30] faith in the messenger
[48:32] you can't say i believe the message
[48:34] without having faith in the messenger
[48:38] and so you know the critics let me just
[48:40] deviate for just a moment the critics of
[48:42] this day want to destroy the messenger
[48:47] while
[48:48] if you just go scan the networks as it
[48:50] were
[48:51] and just really see how many of them are
[48:53] actually preaching the message
[48:56] but they've taken this portion because
[48:58] they liked it and were inspired they've
[49:00] taken this portion but they don't want
[49:02] to be identified with the messenger
[49:05] because if you're identified with the
[49:07] messenger then you have to either have
[49:10] the praise or the shame
[49:12] that went with the messenger
[49:15] now we can take that into our day saints
[49:17] but let's go ahead and just take it back
[49:19] to jesus day
[49:21] they were like
[49:23] isn't he the son of mary
[49:28] you know what that meant
[49:31] you know remember mary that little girl
[49:33] down there
[49:34] was with child before her and joseph
[49:36] ever got
[49:37] isn't
[49:39] he her
[49:40] son
[49:43] so you have to be identified
[49:46] with the glory as it were and with the
[49:48] shame
[49:50] amen
[49:53] so here's the works that you believe on
[49:55] him whom he has sent
[49:57] they said therefore unto him what signs
[49:59] show us thou then that we may see
[50:03] and believe thee
[50:04] what thou dost
[50:06] what dost thou work
[50:09] our fathers
[50:11] now i'm going to dramaticize this
[50:13] they're standing there talking to him
[50:14] what are you going to do that we can
[50:16] believe because our fathers
[50:23] were there at the most supernatural
[50:25] event to ever take place in israel up to
[50:27] that time
[50:30] as they speak to the most supernatural
[50:33] event
[50:34] that's ever taken place
[50:36] in israel
[50:43] that we may see and believe thee
[50:45] what does thou work our fathers did he
[50:48] manna in the desert as it is written he
[50:52] gave them bread from heaven to eat then
[50:54] jesus said unto them verily
[50:56] say unto you moses gave you not that
[50:59] bread from heaven
[51:08] the message you believe where did it
[51:10] come from
[51:13] if you go on the internet it came from
[51:15] william branham
[51:20] but search the scriptures
[51:24] we'll take it back and anchor it right
[51:26] down to a foundation of where did it
[51:28] come from
[51:31] if it came from man then man must
[51:32] empower it
[51:42] moses gave you not that bread from
[51:43] heaven but my father giveth you the true
[51:46] bread from heaven for the bread of god
[51:48] is he which cometh down from heaven and
[51:51] giveth light unto the world
[51:54] then said then to him lord evermore give
[51:56] us this bread and jesus said to them i
[51:58] am the bread of life he that cometh to
[52:01] me shall never hunger and he that
[52:03] believeth on me shall never thirst
[52:06] but i said unto you that ye also have
[52:08] seen me
[52:11] and believe not
[52:13] and i want to this is a little part of
[52:15] my my title today i want to take that
[52:18] as it is here because you see
[52:22] when you see
[52:23] it makes all the difference in your life
[52:30] but you've seen me and believe not and
[52:33] all that the father giveth me shall come
[52:35] to me and
[52:36] him that cometh to me i will and no wise
[52:38] cast out
[52:40] for i come down from heaven not to do
[52:42] mine own will but the will of him that
[52:44] sent me and this is the father's will
[52:46] which hath sent me that of all which he
[52:50] hath given me i should lose nothing now
[52:52] somebody ought to be able to say thank
[52:54] you lord
[52:56] amen no matter what happens in life our
[52:58] struggles our failures and all that
[53:01] satan would squawk my brother and sister
[53:03] you realize as satan if if he was
[53:05] allowed as it were to publish the
[53:08] annuals of your life would certainly
[53:10] have something like the inquirer
[53:14] he would never talk about the time
[53:17] prayer for others in your times of faith
[53:19] he would never talk about who you are
[53:21] and the foundation you're built on he
[53:23] would be there saying and they did this
[53:25] and they did that and we saw
[53:27] dirt on the hem of their garment over
[53:29] here and we saw this failure you see my
[53:31] brother and sister it all depends on
[53:32] who's writing this story
[53:37] i read once now i hope you catch the
[53:39] significance of this
[53:42] read once that the reason that all of
[53:44] these magazines like that
[53:47] are right at the checkout counter
[53:48] because if there was anywhere else in
[53:50] the building no one would waste the
[53:52] effort to go find them
[53:56] they put it right there now catch this
[53:58] at the time of checking out
[54:03] all the trash
[54:05] would be brought up
[54:07] in an
[54:08] expose you
[54:11] but god's version my brother and sister
[54:13] is empty page empty page empty page
[54:15] empty page
[54:16] oh thank you lord
[54:18] and it won't matter my brother and
[54:20] sister where or when or how it's just
[54:23] simply what god has done
[54:28] i should lose nothing but should raise
[54:30] it up again in the last day
[54:33] and this is the will of him that sent me
[54:34] that everyone which seeth
[54:37] the son
[54:38] and believeth on him may have
[54:41] everlasting life and i will raise him up
[54:44] at the last day
[54:45] heavenly father lord we just ask you
[54:48] today
[54:49] lord open our eyes and father may today
[54:52] give me clarity father just to express
[54:55] this
[54:56] father it's not about lord what we see
[54:59] in this flesh
[55:01] lord it's not about what the world
[55:03] around us telegraphs to us but lord it's
[55:06] about you and it's about your word and
[55:09] the revelation of your word and father i
[55:12] pray today open our eyes lord that we
[55:14] truly can see
[55:16] lord of the day that we're living in not
[55:18] just your word but the signs also
[55:22] father bless lord the saints today those
[55:25] that are with us and those that are not
[55:28] father may you be with them equally
[55:30] father and may your holy spirit move in
[55:32] our midst i ask in the name of jesus
[55:34] christ amen you may be seated
[55:42] as we
[55:43] look at these
[55:44] for a moment my brother and sister i
[55:46] want to go back as it were
[55:49] into these last verses for a moment
[55:51] we'll probably revisit them again a
[55:52] little later but you see i want to take
[55:55] this emphasis out of verse 40. this is
[55:58] the will
[56:00] of him that sent me
[56:03] so jesus is expressing to the people
[56:06] of what god has placed or the holy
[56:09] spirit had placed into him as a desire
[56:12] to express and he's expressing it this
[56:15] is the will
[56:16] that everyone which seeth the son
[56:20] and believeth on him may have
[56:22] everlasting life and i will raise him up
[56:24] at the last day and my brother and
[56:26] sister i pray today that you can see or
[56:29] understand that we express this
[56:32] not as a judgmental fact to the world
[56:34] today
[56:35] but a true revelation of what god would
[56:38] bring out of his word and not just our
[56:41] ideology if you want to call it that
[56:43] because you see my brother and sister as
[56:45] the scripture says not all of israel was
[56:48] israel
[56:49] and so we're living in a day of
[56:51] christianity a huge portion of the world
[56:53] identifying in christianity and i
[56:56] believe that same principle would apply
[56:58] in the day that we live in not all that
[57:00] claims the name of jesus christ is a
[57:03] christian
[57:04] and so it's there that we'll look and
[57:06] and hopefully today be able to uh
[57:09] express to you uh this thought of seeing
[57:13] or
[57:14] recognizing what we are looking at and
[57:17] to recognize there's a time and a season
[57:20] uh i believe a lot of us uh could go
[57:22] back to a point in our life we read our
[57:25] bibles
[57:26] we had the identity of christians but
[57:28] there was so much that we did not see
[57:31] and my brother and sister i think it's
[57:33] just is equally important to recognize
[57:36] what we did not see in the season
[57:38] to be able to recognize where we have
[57:41] come from where we are moving to because
[57:45] it is by reading of the word of god that
[57:47] we have a closer relationship this is
[57:50] god in written form correct
[57:52] and so it's there that we can read this
[57:54] but if we don't understand the pages
[57:57] we don't understand what's in there my
[57:59] brother and sister now the word of god
[58:01] is is right here in the bible
[58:03] inspiration is right here and so it is
[58:06] sometimes bottled up in such a fashion
[58:09] uh uh that that people just don't get it
[58:12] they can read it uh they can read these
[58:15] things and uh and not have any
[58:17] comprehension and so i just moving
[58:20] forward on this i want to go into the
[58:22] sermon the deity of jesus christ
[58:26] jesus comes three times he came the
[58:28] first time to redeem his church he comes
[58:30] a second time to receive his church he
[58:33] comes the third time with his church
[58:36] everything in the bible travels in
[58:38] trinity's threes but all in one christ
[58:41] he remember the first time to redeem his
[58:44] church the second time to receive his
[58:46] church third time with his church as
[58:48] king and queen now that stirs my heart
[58:50] saint
[58:51] amen i get to come back as it were
[58:54] not looking as it is in the sense of our
[58:56] human flesh but i get to come back
[58:58] in a feminine form and be the queen the
[59:02] bride of jesus christ
[59:04] amen now that does not make us
[59:06] effeminate there's people of carnal
[59:08] minds it's like well these people
[59:09] talking about being the bride of christ
[59:12] that's just as perverted and they go off
[59:13] on some tirade that have total lack they
[59:16] are in the carnal they do not even see
[59:19] the types of the word expressed so if
[59:22] they cannot see that my brother and
[59:23] sister they must not be identified with
[59:25] it
[59:26] because the minute you become identified
[59:29] in the fact that god is calling back a
[59:32] wife a bride amen that you then
[59:35] recognize your position
[59:37] amen it don't make us brothers any less
[59:39] masculine
[59:43] we just recognize the relationship and
[59:46] how it's placed
[59:51] now but on his first coming we'll speak
[59:54] of just a little bit then on his being
[59:55] here and then on his second coming on it
[59:57] and then on the third time if the lord
[59:59] willing now in these days there was a
[1:00:01] great persecution against the church
[1:00:03] caesar augusta had made a great plan
[1:00:05] that he would tax all the people and
[1:00:07] that was only done for one purpose
[1:00:11] now you realize my brother and sister i
[1:00:13] want to lay this down as we're seeing
[1:00:15] things happening on the earth today
[1:00:18] there is only being done for one purpose
[1:00:21] so the mass confusion that went through
[1:00:23] all of the region
[1:00:27] you must go back to the place of your
[1:00:29] birth
[1:00:32] that we can tax you
[1:00:34] imagine what the roads must have looked
[1:00:36] like because families had moved from
[1:00:37] here to there and there to there and
[1:00:39] whatever and mass confusion so much so
[1:00:42] that as it were when joseph and mary
[1:00:45] arrive in town there's not even a place
[1:00:48] for them
[1:00:49] but look at what the prophet lays it out
[1:00:51] only done for one purpose and that's
[1:00:54] god's great prophecy would be fulfilled
[1:00:57] now i want you to think about what's
[1:00:59] going on in the world today okay this is
[1:01:01] kind of a crossing over of the world
[1:01:04] today and our thoughts here you see
[1:01:06] these things are being done for one
[1:01:09] purpose
[1:01:11] and that's that prophecy would be
[1:01:13] fulfilled
[1:01:15] now our hearts go out and trust me i've
[1:01:17] shed tears praying for the saints in
[1:01:20] ukraine and russia but my brother and
[1:01:22] sister on the other side when their
[1:01:24] voices echo back and they say
[1:01:27] this must come to pass god's will be
[1:01:30] done and they're the ones suffering
[1:01:34] there's an understanding they're seeing
[1:01:37] the plan of god unfolding before them
[1:01:41] and so this is done for one purpose that
[1:01:43] god's great prophecy would be fulfilled
[1:01:46] only thing
[1:01:47] you have to do when you see something in
[1:01:49] the bible
[1:01:52] sounds just a little mystic a little
[1:01:54] superstitious to you
[1:01:56] now we're not focusing on the mystic or
[1:01:58] the superstitious but i want you to
[1:02:00] focus on these words to come
[1:02:02] and a little superstitious to you
[1:02:05] just
[1:02:06] give god
[1:02:07] a little bit of time
[1:02:10] god is in no hurry we're the one that
[1:02:12] gets in a hurry just give god just a
[1:02:15] little bit of time and you will see the
[1:02:18] old prophetic wheels cogs
[1:02:21] run right up into the picture it will
[1:02:24] develop just like bringing up a picture
[1:02:27] and we are looking in the signs of the
[1:02:29] time my brother and sister a prophet of
[1:02:31] god said america would be bankrupt and
[1:02:34] could not pay it and it was there that
[1:02:36] their children are now they're spending
[1:02:38] the money the children 40 years from now
[1:02:41] will be doing i just heard a man say the
[1:02:43] other day if america went on an
[1:02:45] austerity movement it would take 100
[1:02:48] years to erase this debt
[1:02:53] prophet said we'd be bankrupt
[1:02:58] here we are
[1:03:04] now look at these things you see it
[1:03:06] applies
[1:03:07] the scripture said
[1:03:10] that satan
[1:03:12] as a roaring lion
[1:03:15] now i'm not saying he is a roaring lion
[1:03:17] but it's as because you see if he is the
[1:03:20] roaring lion my brother and sister then
[1:03:22] that would mean that he would be an
[1:03:24] equal as it were to the line of the
[1:03:26] tribe of judah so he's coming as in
[1:03:29] other words he's projecting himself as a
[1:03:32] roaring lion and it's there of the
[1:03:35] intimidation my brother and sister of
[1:03:37] the fear
[1:03:39] of the doubts
[1:03:40] of the insecurities
[1:03:51] in the church ages
[1:03:56] the closing down as it is
[1:03:59] brother branham says and i was going to
[1:04:00] put the page down and i didn't bother
[1:04:02] because i actually had an old church age
[1:04:05] book in my hand when i looked this up
[1:04:06] and i know many of us uh you know are
[1:04:08] reading brother george has got his
[1:04:10] formatted uh to where it's a little
[1:04:12] easier to read so you can find it it's
[1:04:15] right there uh in the cusp of the
[1:04:17] philadelphia uh and church age and it's
[1:04:20] actually well anyway you can find it
[1:04:23] brother branham says there now watch
[1:04:26] russia
[1:04:28] watch russia
[1:04:30] king of the north
[1:04:33] now my brother and sister we'll look at
[1:04:35] that and we're seeing that now
[1:04:37] of flexing
[1:04:41] and i i have many brothers who have
[1:04:44] jumped and said this is it this is a
[1:04:46] thing this is it's going to happen now i
[1:04:48] i believe it very well could don't
[1:04:50] misunderstand me but i want you to take
[1:04:52] this quote that i just read you and i
[1:04:54] want you to stop and you will look at
[1:04:57] that and see that god don't want you to
[1:04:59] jump to conclusion god don't want you to
[1:05:01] suddenly get afraid of it is that oh my
[1:05:04] this is it it's happening god don't want
[1:05:06] you to react that way god wants you to
[1:05:08] give him time because he promised he
[1:05:11] would reveal these things to you
[1:05:14] he promised that there would be no
[1:05:15] mystery left to the bride of christ we
[1:05:18] are not here my brother and sister to
[1:05:20] measure our relationship with the lord
[1:05:23] by how close we are to the rapture
[1:05:28] because if it operated that way
[1:05:30] according to the nature of human
[1:05:32] humanity we would just wait
[1:05:34] until we knew
[1:05:36] five minutes
[1:05:40] come on do you agree with me
[1:05:42] too many of us are that way
[1:05:44] oh i've got time still
[1:05:50] he said i don't want you to react to
[1:05:51] this
[1:05:52] watch russia
[1:05:54] oh we got to get desperate my brother
[1:05:56] and sister i apply this to myself but we
[1:05:58] should be desperate all the time
[1:06:01] we should not come to a moment of
[1:06:03] desperation we should be desperate
[1:06:06] before the lord
[1:06:08] we should be lifting these things up
[1:06:10] amen the prophet of god said he'll come
[1:06:12] for those that are sighing and crying
[1:06:14] for the abominations in this city oh god
[1:06:17] don't let it take something like a
[1:06:19] russian evasion invasion for us to
[1:06:21] suddenly have a desperation to start
[1:06:23] praying for the world
[1:06:26] but it should be a part of our daily
[1:06:27] life it should be something within us
[1:06:30] that we're reaching out and saying you
[1:06:31] know what lord we have prophecy we have
[1:06:34] the scripture it's going to come to an
[1:06:36] end i don't know when but lord if you
[1:06:40] will just grant my prayer i will be
[1:06:42] ready
[1:06:44] there will be no moment
[1:06:46] of pleading
[1:06:51] see let the picture develop
[1:06:54] you see we have no need to speculate
[1:06:56] saints
[1:06:57] a lot of speculation flying around
[1:06:59] people are like well believe this is
[1:07:01] this brother brown said this brother
[1:07:02] brown said this good what happens if
[1:07:04] russia apologizes it goes home every one
[1:07:06] of their declarations becomes mute
[1:07:10] will they do that
[1:07:14] in the carnal world we'd say probably
[1:07:16] not
[1:07:20] but have you ever heard of a faint
[1:07:23] you know boxers do it all the time
[1:07:26] and the guy's like oh guard myself
[1:07:29] and it comes from a different direction
[1:07:32] see let's not waste our time trying to
[1:07:33] figure out what that is
[1:07:36] let's spend our time figuring out
[1:07:38] what this is
[1:07:41] let's spend our energy and our effort
[1:07:44] of lord
[1:07:46] instead of being afraid
[1:07:50] let me spend time in preparation
[1:07:56] you see as it says there
[1:07:58] it'll develop
[1:08:00] just like the bringing up of a picture
[1:08:04] it's going to come whether we're over
[1:08:05] here
[1:08:07] or not
[1:08:09] now you see
[1:08:11] i just would like to put this out to you
[1:08:14] with a sincere heart maybe it just you
[1:08:16] would maybe grasp onto this and take it
[1:08:19] but with a sin's heart sincere heart to
[1:08:21] say to the lord lord help me be ready
[1:08:23] morning noon or night
[1:08:27] not just sunday or wednesday or not just
[1:08:29] when we see the blow coming as it were
[1:08:32] but let us be ready morning noon and
[1:08:33] night and i tell you saints we want to
[1:08:35] do something for the saints of the
[1:08:37] ukraine and russia and whatever eastern
[1:08:40] europe that's impacted i'll tell you
[1:08:42] what we can do oh yes the doors might be
[1:08:44] opened they're working on that to be
[1:08:46] able to send monetary help my but if
[1:08:49] there's nothing on the store shelf
[1:08:54] pray in earnest
[1:08:56] pray in earnest for them the prophet of
[1:08:57] god said prayer changes things now if
[1:09:00] this is the season that russia moves to
[1:09:03] fulfill scripture
[1:09:05] then so be it
[1:09:07] but god will provide amen
[1:09:10] god will provide so let's provide a
[1:09:13] sweet odor before the throne
[1:09:16] to provide for them their necessity
[1:09:26] now let's look for a moment of what we
[1:09:27] see with our eyes
[1:09:33] what we see with our eyes my brother and
[1:09:35] sister
[1:09:40] oh prophet
[1:09:42] we're surrounded completely
[1:09:45] by the enemy
[1:09:50] oh my servant
[1:09:53] come up into heavenly places
[1:09:57] come on we can apply that come up to
[1:09:59] this place right here come on up get out
[1:10:01] of your point of view what you see with
[1:10:04] your eyes and get up here in heavenly
[1:10:06] places and you will recognize there's
[1:10:09] more with us than there is against us
[1:10:12] and that we are surrounded by the
[1:10:14] presence of almighty god
[1:10:16] but the eye will tell us the eye and the
[1:10:19] mind will tell us there's no hope
[1:10:23] and god says i am the author of hope
[1:10:29] oh i've got many more notes here but i
[1:10:30] believe you caught that
[1:10:32] my brother and sister our eyes can look
[1:10:34] at the circumstances and we'll be there
[1:10:36] saying okay how does this apply and how
[1:10:38] does that apply my brother and sister
[1:10:40] you see uh
[1:10:42] gog and magog are gonna come to pass
[1:10:47] whether we give two thoughts about it or
[1:10:48] not
[1:10:51] oh brother
[1:10:53] what's gonna happen if this happens and
[1:10:55] if that happens brother what's gonna oh
[1:10:57] in the middle east and what are they
[1:10:59] doing over here and what's gonna go on
[1:11:01] and how does this affect the bride of
[1:11:03] christ
[1:11:04] well if the bride of christ is caught up
[1:11:06] in a nervous state of affairs she's
[1:11:08] gonna have a breakdown
[1:11:12] that's not what the word said the word
[1:11:13] said that we would come and he is our
[1:11:15] peace
[1:11:17] amen he is our mighty fortress he is our
[1:11:20] provider he is our guide
[1:11:24] and once again to bring it in those
[1:11:26] words he's our comforter
[1:11:28] now you can't claim comfort in a tizzy
[1:11:33] i've got peace while i melt down
[1:11:37] no
[1:11:38] no
[1:11:39] no come on saints
[1:11:40] it's time for us to say look we are but
[1:11:44] one little cog in this wheel as it were
[1:11:47] and i'm gonna make sure that when the
[1:11:49] wheel comes around to the bride in the
[1:11:52] united states and more pacific to the
[1:11:54] state of idaho more specific to the town
[1:11:57] of nampa that my cog in the wheel is
[1:12:00] going to be ready in the time of need
[1:12:03] i'm not going to be having a meltdown oh
[1:12:05] lord i was so focused on what's
[1:12:07] happening with israel and so how about
[1:12:09] what happened here and what happened
[1:12:11] there i forgot to be prepared myself
[1:12:14] and if trouble comes our way i pray we
[1:12:16] have the kind of faith that we'd be
[1:12:18] picking our phones up and calling
[1:12:20] brother let's pray together
[1:12:22] families let's pray together
[1:12:25] amen the gods will be done
[1:12:28] amen that we can stand the test of our
[1:12:32] position of who we are in our cog in the
[1:12:35] wheel that we'll stand the test
[1:12:39] in the meantime the saints in south
[1:12:41] america and africa and wherever else as
[1:12:44] they are praying to fulfill their part
[1:12:46] in the body of christ my brother and
[1:12:48] sister when this body doesn't break down
[1:12:50] over what's happening somewhere else and
[1:12:52] is fortified in the word of god for our
[1:12:55] position in the body of believers then
[1:12:57] when it comes to us
[1:12:59] we will manifest
[1:13:02] and fulfill that
[1:13:03] without
[1:13:05] a collapse
[1:13:10] you see as we
[1:13:12] look with our eyes our eyes can be
[1:13:14] deceptive
[1:13:16] reminds me of a story i read
[1:13:19] a man went hunting
[1:13:21] was not a real experienced hunter
[1:13:24] had only been a christian i mean a
[1:13:26] hunter for a short while
[1:13:30] and he's there in the woods
[1:13:33] and he bought a tag for everything
[1:13:39] he looks across the canyon and there's
[1:13:41] the biggest bear he's ever saw in his
[1:13:43] life
[1:13:46] he gets his rifle up
[1:13:47] zeroes in gets himself steadied
[1:13:51] it doesn't move
[1:13:53] puts another shell in
[1:13:55] doesn't move
[1:13:58] four times
[1:14:00] as he's hiking down in the canyon
[1:14:02] to go up the other side
[1:14:05] he meets another hunter
[1:14:06] the hunter said was that you shooting he
[1:14:08] says yes it's me shooting he says what
[1:14:11] was your shooting at he said the biggest
[1:14:12] bear you ever saw the guy got all
[1:14:15] excited he says well well you know i'm
[1:14:17] not seeing anything i'll just go with
[1:14:19] you and help you
[1:14:21] and they hike up out of that canyon and
[1:14:23] they get over there
[1:14:24] and there is a fire blackened stump
[1:14:28] with four holes in it
[1:14:32] and he tells the other man he says i am
[1:14:34] sure
[1:14:36] i saw
[1:14:37] a bear
[1:14:40] they hike down go back to where he shot
[1:14:43] look across the canyon
[1:14:45] it looked just like a bear
[1:14:50] but you see
[1:14:53] unless the bear is petrified
[1:14:56] it will move
[1:14:59] so he didn't look at all the signs
[1:15:02] his eye told him
[1:15:04] my brother and sister we look out here
[1:15:06] our eyes are going to tell us a lot of
[1:15:08] things
[1:15:09] it's telling a nation that's moved now
[1:15:11] from one fear to another
[1:15:14] if you don't think that that is ordained
[1:15:16] to be that way that we move from one
[1:15:18] great thing to catch our attention
[1:15:21] remember church if you look back through
[1:15:22] time
[1:15:23] you'll you'll remember that i preached
[1:15:25] on the distracted generation that is
[1:15:28] what's exactly we're seeing i'm not
[1:15:30] boasting on paul but that's what we're
[1:15:31] seeing happen right now is a distracted
[1:15:34] generation is being one flash to another
[1:15:37] flash to another flash and they're
[1:15:39] looking at that and behind the scenes
[1:15:42] little things like the un
[1:15:45] is bringing up a resolution before the
[1:15:46] council
[1:15:48] that the next
[1:15:49] get it the next plague or pandemic
[1:15:53] the next one they're planning on it
[1:15:56] they're not saying you know we hope this
[1:15:58] never happens again the next pandemic we
[1:16:01] need to have a world order that has
[1:16:04] authority over nations
[1:16:06] to
[1:16:07] control this
[1:16:09] to make every citizen and every nation
[1:16:12] accountable to the same rules
[1:16:15] and you know it's going to pass the u.n
[1:16:17] and our nation will jump right on that
[1:16:18] bandwagon
[1:16:20] giving their authority to someone else
[1:16:23] now that's happening in the natural oh
[1:16:25] my goodness the un's going to come and
[1:16:27] force you to be vaccinated
[1:16:33] while the devil's eroding everything
[1:16:34] underneath you in a spiritual realm
[1:16:39] don't be distracted
[1:16:41] don't be distracted my brother and
[1:16:42] sister
[1:16:45] now we look at this
[1:16:46] let's look with what our we see with our
[1:16:49] hearts remember now i was going to put
[1:16:50] the quote back in but i'll just
[1:16:51] reference it uh i i read it to you the
[1:16:54] other day brother chris referenced it
[1:16:55] now my brother and sister
[1:16:57] satan chose the head god chose the heart
[1:17:01] so the eyes are in the head and and
[1:17:03] we'll touch on that a little later here
[1:17:05] the eyes are in the head but god deals
[1:17:08] with the heart
[1:17:09] and so as it is we'll look at this now
[1:17:12] what do we see with our hearts we go to
[1:17:14] john 14 and he says here let
[1:17:18] your head
[1:17:23] are you with me
[1:17:24] he says let not your heart
[1:17:27] be troubled you believe in god believe
[1:17:29] also in me
[1:17:31] father's houses many mansions if it were
[1:17:34] not so i would have told you i go to
[1:17:36] prepare a place for you
[1:17:38] amen you
[1:17:40] and if i go and prepare a place for you
[1:17:42] i will come again and receive you
[1:17:45] unto myself that where i am there may
[1:17:49] there ye may be also
[1:17:52] and whether i go
[1:17:54] you know
[1:17:55] and the way
[1:17:57] you know
[1:17:58] now i want to ask you how are you going
[1:18:00] to know
[1:18:06] were we given a little handbook
[1:18:12] mcnally
[1:18:15] quickest way to heaven
[1:18:18] scenic route to heaven
[1:18:21] cheapest route to heaven
[1:18:25] most memorable route
[1:18:28] to heaven
[1:18:31] why is it
[1:18:32] because your heart
[1:18:34] has seen the revealed word
[1:18:37] no true believer saw this message with
[1:18:40] his eyes
[1:18:41] you saw it with your heart your eyes was
[1:18:44] the design god used for you to take the
[1:18:47] input of the written page your ears was
[1:18:50] the input of the the sound that come but
[1:18:54] it was the heart that received the word
[1:18:57] and as this comes my brother and sister
[1:18:59] this is now this is where i'm going to
[1:19:01] get a little rough as it were this is
[1:19:03] where the separation is coming between
[1:19:06] the so-called christian and the true
[1:19:08] believer because the heart is then
[1:19:11] giving guidance where one would say
[1:19:13] those things don't matter anymore it's
[1:19:15] old testament but jesus said i didn't
[1:19:17] come to do away with that
[1:19:20] but no that's old testament you don't
[1:19:21] understand that's an old covenant
[1:19:22] doesn't apply to us we're under grace
[1:19:25] well i'm telling you the scripture also
[1:19:27] teaches us that grace grace to disgrace
[1:19:29] is not god's plan
[1:19:31] and so grace is a a poor excuse for poor
[1:19:36] christian behavior
[1:19:39] the lord will forgive me while i rob
[1:19:40] this bank
[1:19:43] lord will forgive me while i cheat my
[1:19:44] employer
[1:19:46] the lord will forgive me why i do this
[1:19:48] or i do that
[1:19:49] no my brother and sister poor excuse
[1:19:53] so whether i go you know so what is he
[1:19:55] telling them john is telling them that
[1:19:58] the true believer which is you this
[1:20:00] morning is going to know the plan of god
[1:20:02] you know how you're going to get there
[1:20:04] and you can see by revelation through
[1:20:07] the word what god is doing to get you
[1:20:10] there he said i'm not going to take you
[1:20:12] halfway and lose you along the path
[1:20:14] those i have begun this work in i'm
[1:20:17] going to finish this work and so it's
[1:20:19] there that god says i'm going to reveal
[1:20:21] to you he didn't reveal it in our mind
[1:20:23] my brother and sister oh the mind is
[1:20:25] there to comprehend it but it is the
[1:20:27] heart and many people will quit because
[1:20:30] they never allowed their heart to see
[1:20:32] the word they were content to be able to
[1:20:35] take a position set in that position and
[1:20:37] say praise god i'm a message believer
[1:20:40] well that's good that's a good mental
[1:20:42] position to start with but to be a
[1:20:45] believer in jesus christ is the path
[1:20:48] that the word is leading to
[1:20:50] not just to say oh i i know this is
[1:20:52] right compared to all others
[1:20:56] well the rest will fail
[1:20:58] and the denominational spirit on this
[1:21:01] will also fail
[1:21:03] that's exactly right amen
[1:21:06] now john 6 and 36 like i said i got a
[1:21:08] lot of scripture in john here
[1:21:11] but i said unto you
[1:21:13] that ye also have seen me
[1:21:16] and believe not
[1:21:18] you see here is the dividing line
[1:21:21] of the seeing with the heart
[1:21:24] and jesus acknowledging you saw me
[1:21:28] you have eyes you're able to focus
[1:21:32] you saw me
[1:21:33] but you don't even believe
[1:21:36] so they're seeing him
[1:21:38] meant nothing
[1:21:42] yeah
[1:21:42] come on
[1:21:44] i hope you get that their seeing meant
[1:21:46] nothing
[1:21:50] because they couldn't believe
[1:21:51] and he stood right there in their midst
[1:21:54] oh look at this
[1:21:56] my brother and sister-in-law
[1:21:58] what we see amen
[1:22:00] now as we'll look at this we'll realize
[1:22:03] going once again just jumping actually a
[1:22:05] few verses
[1:22:06] and this is the will of him that sent me
[1:22:08] that everyone which seeth the son and
[1:22:11] believeth on him may have everlasting
[1:22:14] life and i will raise him up last day
[1:22:16] now my brother and sister once again i
[1:22:17] believe you caught the point you're
[1:22:18] you're very uh how do i say this you're
[1:22:21] smart people you understand you have
[1:22:22] revelation but you look at that and see
[1:22:24] my brother and sister here we have those
[1:22:26] that seen him
[1:22:28] didn't believe
[1:22:29] that's it
[1:22:30] and now we have the will of him that
[1:22:32] sent me that every one which seeth the
[1:22:34] son
[1:22:36] what is it it's looking beyond the veil
[1:22:39] you can't look at what's on this side of
[1:22:41] the veil and say well i was in church i
[1:22:43] was in the house of god i was there i
[1:22:45] saw you got to look beyond the veil to
[1:22:48] see christ in his majesty see him in his
[1:22:51] glory
[1:22:52] see him in his proper position of who he
[1:22:55] is and why he come and even why we were
[1:22:58] created you have to see that and when
[1:23:00] you see that you see the place that you
[1:23:03] are in the economy of god
[1:23:05] i'm not just a sinner saved by grace i
[1:23:07] am a crown jewel of my lord jesus christ
[1:23:10] oh that sounds so arrogant no it isn't
[1:23:13] just recognizing the facts
[1:23:15] i've seen him
[1:23:18] can you say amen i've seen him
[1:23:21] amen i didn't didn't find a religion
[1:23:23] that fit me i didn't find a religion you
[1:23:25] know my son and i was driving around in
[1:23:26] phoenix one time we went by drove by
[1:23:29] this this um
[1:23:31] church grounds
[1:23:33] i said oh what college is this
[1:23:36] he just laughed
[1:23:37] he goes oh that's something something
[1:23:39] cathedral
[1:23:41] it's a church
[1:23:43] they had football fields
[1:23:45] soccer fields basketball courts
[1:23:48] gymnasiums
[1:23:51] and he says i worked with a man he said
[1:23:54] i always would talk to him about the
[1:23:55] message you know it's funny because my
[1:23:57] son technically he'd say his backslid
[1:24:00] still talking about the message
[1:24:03] paradox huh
[1:24:06] he's talking to this guy the guy told
[1:24:07] him he says yeah my wife and i we
[1:24:09] changed church this week my brother's
[1:24:11] like really i mean my son's like really
[1:24:13] he goes yeah yeah we're going over there
[1:24:15] to the cathedral
[1:24:18] and my son's like so
[1:24:19] why i thought you guys were happy with
[1:24:21] your church he goes well we were but um
[1:24:23] they have a way better softball league
[1:24:31] okay
[1:24:33] everyone that seeth the sun
[1:24:38] are you catching that poor analogy
[1:24:40] going to church for what
[1:24:42] softball league
[1:24:44] not to see the sun
[1:24:47] better program they have free daycare
[1:24:49] my wife will go back to work now
[1:24:54] is this what church is about
[1:24:58] the less we would feel
[1:25:00] built up in ourselves we have very
[1:25:02] similar
[1:25:04] things in our world amen
[1:25:07] amen
[1:25:08] so as we look at this
[1:25:11] we're looking how
[1:25:12] he declares that
[1:25:14] that the one that seeth the sonnet
[1:25:16] believeth on him see before you can
[1:25:18] really truly believe my brother and
[1:25:20] sister you have to see him
[1:25:22] now look at this i i didn't include this
[1:25:24] i thought about this but i'm going to be
[1:25:25] too long anyway but look the prophet of
[1:25:27] god says now those that have never risen
[1:25:30] beyond that level they don't know but
[1:25:33] when you have risen to another level
[1:25:36] those that have risen to that level is
[1:25:39] now they see that they have never seen
[1:25:42] before but the others when you are
[1:25:44] talking to them i'm paraphrasing this
[1:25:46] when you're talking to them they would
[1:25:48] say i see
[1:25:49] but you see they can't see because
[1:25:51] they've never crossed that riven veil
[1:25:53] they've never been here so what they're
[1:25:56] seeing is something entirely different
[1:25:59] and their view is here while the view of
[1:26:01] the true believer filled with the holy
[1:26:03] ghost is here and they're talking about
[1:26:05] i see and they're saying i see and we
[1:26:08] think we're on the same page
[1:26:12] but it's impossible to be on the same
[1:26:15] page
[1:26:16] between the unbeliever make believer and
[1:26:19] the true believer
[1:26:21] do we elevate ourselves and boast on
[1:26:23] ourselves absolutely not
[1:26:25] amen there's nothing for us to boast on
[1:26:27] but my brother sister you need to
[1:26:29] recognize that by able by god's grace
[1:26:32] you are able to see
[1:26:34] what the world here is not seeing i went
[1:26:36] to a funeral
[1:26:38] this last friday
[1:26:42] and this is actually stark humor and i'm
[1:26:44] sorry to put it this way
[1:26:46] but my brother and sister there's
[1:26:48] ministers in churches
[1:26:50] that are so uninspired
[1:26:53] one thing i'll say about that minister
[1:26:55] that preached that funeral he had the
[1:26:57] whole group going to heaven to see this
[1:27:00] man again
[1:27:05] then what difference is there
[1:27:07] why try
[1:27:12] reminds me of a kid
[1:27:15] years ago that i knew
[1:27:18] smart kid
[1:27:20] intelligent i should say
[1:27:26] and i asked him
[1:27:28] you know i was thinking about quitting
[1:27:29] school
[1:27:30] i asked him why don't you why don't you
[1:27:32] just quit and he goes oh
[1:27:34] he said have you ever noticed that when
[1:27:36] you get your diploma
[1:27:38] it doesn't say what your grades were
[1:27:41] i'll get the diploma even if i get it
[1:27:44] with a d-minus
[1:27:52] when i was
[1:27:53] pardon the phrase half backslid
[1:27:57] i used to think lord
[1:28:00] if i could just make it to heaven if i'd
[1:28:02] be the doormat
[1:28:06] in the door
[1:28:08] of heaven
[1:28:10] i'll be happy
[1:28:13] but you know what happened
[1:28:16] i seen him
[1:28:19] i've seen him
[1:28:23] oh yes the doormat in heaven as it were
[1:28:25] figuratively would have eternal life
[1:28:28] but i seen him and i said i don't
[1:28:31] i don't want to be a doormat any longer
[1:28:33] i want to be right here before the
[1:28:36] throne because what i have seen is so
[1:28:39] beautiful and so precious and i want it
[1:28:41] so much that i no longer will be
[1:28:44] satisfied to be a doormat
[1:28:46] i want to be there and i want to sit
[1:28:48] right there at the throne of almighty
[1:28:49] god i want to be as it were along with a
[1:28:52] few other people i want to be right
[1:28:54] there where i can reach out and touch
[1:28:55] him imagine i don't know how god will
[1:28:57] work that out
[1:28:59] but as long as i'm there i'm not going
[1:29:02] to be the doormat i'm going to be a son
[1:29:03] of god shouting i'm standing on the sea
[1:29:06] of crystal and i'll be shouting
[1:29:08] hallelujah and glory to god my brother
[1:29:11] and sister knowing that i was privileged
[1:29:14] by almighty god to see him in his
[1:29:17] majesty and his righteousness in his
[1:29:19] holiness not just a god that saves some
[1:29:22] people but my god my husband my
[1:29:25] bridegroom that's who i want to see
[1:29:29] hallelujah amen so i want to see the sun
[1:29:33] in how god intended for us to see the
[1:29:36] sun i want to see him in the full
[1:29:38] revelation of the word not a watered
[1:29:41] down version
[1:29:43] hallelujah
[1:29:44] hallelujah
[1:29:46] oh hallelujah
[1:29:49] so as john is speaking he i just know
[1:29:51] john was hoping that the people would
[1:29:54] catch the essence of what was recorded
[1:29:57] what jesus was speaking i mean and catch
[1:29:59] the essence of it
[1:30:01] john saw that as important enough he
[1:30:03] writes it
[1:30:05] but my brother and sister see there's
[1:30:07] this other kind of seeing which is not
[1:30:09] the vision of a mortal man
[1:30:12] you do you realize what you see saints
[1:30:14] what god has granted you to see
[1:30:17] is not the vision and understanding of
[1:30:19] mortal man
[1:30:21] it is the revelation of eternal life
[1:30:26] so god has opened the channel to you
[1:30:29] personally of the essence of eternal
[1:30:32] life that you could catch whatever he
[1:30:35] says now you know where i'm going and
[1:30:38] you know how to get there
[1:30:40] what because the essence of eternal life
[1:30:42] has been revealed to you and it's no
[1:30:44] longer hey what do i do and how do i do
[1:30:46] this there's something inside of you
[1:30:48] just read this morning where the prophet
[1:30:50] of god says there is such a thirst in a
[1:30:53] real believer that they can only satisfy
[1:30:57] that by the presence of god
[1:31:00] oh i tell you it's what brings the
[1:31:02] drunks my brother and sister that's what
[1:31:05] brings the drug addicts that's what
[1:31:06] drink brings a street walker that's what
[1:31:09] brings them out of that life out of that
[1:31:11] culture and changes them and the world
[1:31:13] says we don't know how it happened oh
[1:31:16] hallelujah
[1:31:18] oh
[1:31:19] now let's go on
[1:31:20] verse 12 uh chapter 12 verse 44. jesus
[1:31:23] cried see this wasn't some casual
[1:31:25] conversation
[1:31:27] jesus didn't say now look guys reason
[1:31:29] with me
[1:31:31] let's discuss this you know there's a
[1:31:32] better way
[1:31:34] no jesus cried amen he cried out he he
[1:31:38] gave great expression
[1:31:42] force
[1:31:46] he that believeth on me
[1:31:50] believeth not on me
[1:31:53] now this is getting dicey
[1:31:56] oh this is getting dicey now this don't
[1:31:58] fit my message understanding of
[1:32:02] the godhead
[1:32:13] heathen okay i i know you're smart but
[1:32:15] i'm just gonna break it down because i
[1:32:17] need to break it down for me
[1:32:18] because i'm breaking it down for the 40
[1:32:20] second time you're just hearing it for
[1:32:21] the first time today
[1:32:23] he that believeth on me that's me
[1:32:26] yeah
[1:32:27] come on
[1:32:29] believeth not on me
[1:32:32] i believe on him but i'm not believing
[1:32:34] on him i'm stumped now
[1:32:38] because i believed on you
[1:32:40] but i'm not
[1:32:42] believing on you
[1:32:46] but on him
[1:32:48] that sent me
[1:32:51] apply that to today's
[1:32:52] saints oh yes there's them crazy people
[1:32:56] following a man
[1:32:58] yeah well i follow that man i follow his
[1:33:01] teaching but i'm not really believing on
[1:33:03] him
[1:33:05] i'm believing on
[1:33:06] the one that sent him
[1:33:09] i'm believing i'm the one that sent him
[1:33:10] hallelujah he that seeth me seeth him
[1:33:13] that sent me
[1:33:15] oh come on
[1:33:17] let's apply this right down into some
[1:33:18] good modern 21st century message
[1:33:21] theology
[1:33:23] amen
[1:33:25] look where this come from and people say
[1:33:27] how can you follow that paul i thought
[1:33:29] you had more sense than that i had a
[1:33:31] friend he quit
[1:33:33] but he was determined to convince me
[1:33:35] that i wasn't looking at it quite
[1:33:37] correct
[1:33:39] while he was unlike church number eight
[1:33:40] or nine trying to find a place that
[1:33:42] would preach something he could digest
[1:33:44] yeah
[1:33:45] i told him
[1:33:46] you've heard me talk about this i told
[1:33:48] them look as soon as i find something
[1:33:50] better i'm gone
[1:33:53] just don't expect that to happen
[1:33:56] yeah
[1:33:57] because you see
[1:33:59] this scripture right here
[1:34:01] john 12 44-45
[1:34:05] i saw it
[1:34:08] i saw it saints
[1:34:10] god was gracious enough to open my eyes
[1:34:12] i could see this i saw what he was
[1:34:15] saying and recognizing that there are
[1:34:17] men that god has used through the ages
[1:34:20] they say oh yes i believe the old
[1:34:21] testament i believe all that but that
[1:34:23] can't happen in our day
[1:34:25] god you're just not capable
[1:34:28] utter nonsense saints
[1:34:30] amen so we're not believing on the man
[1:34:33] we're believing on the god that's in the
[1:34:34] man
[1:34:36] and the god that's in the man just
[1:34:37] happens to be the same god that's in you
[1:34:39] and i and so the same spirit and the
[1:34:42] spirit speak to each other just like
[1:34:44] evil spirits right they speak to each
[1:34:46] other amen the holy spirit that's in the
[1:34:49] word is speaking to you and i and we can
[1:34:52] speak back to the word and say that's
[1:34:54] what i believe now why do i believe that
[1:34:56] i don't know why i believe that but
[1:34:57] that's what i believe
[1:34:59] because you see my mind will not be able
[1:35:02] to dictate what i believe
[1:35:06] my heart is what saw the word my heart
[1:35:09] is what saw the life my heart has saw
[1:35:11] god
[1:35:13] not my mind not my eyes not my ears
[1:35:17] but god
[1:35:19] oh hallelujah
[1:35:21] are we okay to keep going for a little
[1:35:23] bit
[1:35:24] amen john 14 17
[1:35:27] even the spirit of truth
[1:35:30] whom the world
[1:35:32] cannot receive
[1:35:35] doesn't that make you feel like an
[1:35:36] oddball
[1:35:38] got a whole world out here
[1:35:41] hundreds and hundreds we're up in the
[1:35:43] billions aren't we on the earth
[1:35:44] something like that
[1:35:47] can't see it
[1:35:51] why you
[1:35:53] well let me unfold this little theory
[1:35:58] that while there was still a void
[1:36:01] in the mind of god
[1:36:03] he was like paul when he's working in
[1:36:04] the basement of the church
[1:36:07] come on you little board get in here
[1:36:09] where you belong
[1:36:11] no don't ouch that hurt oh
[1:36:13] people be what's wrong with this guy
[1:36:16] now if you'll forgive me for making an
[1:36:17] analogy like that
[1:36:19] here's god
[1:36:21] in the universe
[1:36:23] i'd like to have
[1:36:25] someone
[1:36:27] that would love me so much
[1:36:30] they'd serve me
[1:36:32] through thick and thin
[1:36:35] they'd serve me no matter what happened
[1:36:40] and he looks off through the galaxies
[1:36:41] and the eagle nebula and all this the
[1:36:44] black hole of all these things
[1:36:46] and he said there's no one
[1:36:50] but i really want someone to love me
[1:36:55] now
[1:36:56] maybe you can grasp this real good maybe
[1:36:57] you don't if you don't i pray that you
[1:36:59] pray about it but you see god starts
[1:37:01] speaking your name
[1:37:04] where did it come from i don't know the
[1:37:05] mind of god so much larger than my mind
[1:37:08] i can't even comprehend it
[1:37:10] but i could start in the front row and
[1:37:12] move all the way to the back row and
[1:37:14] declare and to each one of you god spoke
[1:37:16] your name
[1:37:20] and eternity recorded it
[1:37:25] and he said let it be us
[1:37:27] and it had to come to pass
[1:37:31] now we can be all oh my life is so
[1:37:33] miserable
[1:37:34] we have family problems
[1:37:38] we have financial problems we have this
[1:37:40] problem we have that problem and church
[1:37:43] is so boring
[1:37:44] well let me remind you all
[1:37:46] if you're not getting fed at church
[1:37:48] that means your baby
[1:37:51] because babies have to have the bottle
[1:37:53] brought to them
[1:37:54] placed in their lips and supported so
[1:37:56] they can drink the bottle
[1:37:58] but a real true mature christian goes
[1:38:01] out and says i want meat and they find
[1:38:04] meat and they prepare the meat and they
[1:38:06] eat the meat without someone having to
[1:38:08] do that so i tell you that sounds a
[1:38:10] little harsh but if you don't feel fed
[1:38:12] maybe you might look in the mirror and
[1:38:14] see why you're not fed
[1:38:17] up
[1:38:22] i love you i'm not trying to be harsh
[1:38:25] amen but you see we're not looking at
[1:38:28] the vision of mortal man
[1:38:30] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[1:38:32] cannot receive because it what
[1:38:35] seeth him not
[1:38:37] they saw jesus a man walking on the
[1:38:40] shores of galilee my brother and sister
[1:38:42] they'll look once again in this day for
[1:38:44] a man walking on the shores of galilee
[1:38:46] but they fail to recognize that that was
[1:38:49] a time and a season of the expression of
[1:38:52] the prophecy and word of god and it is
[1:38:54] not the word for this day the word for
[1:38:57] this day is that oh let me just read it
[1:38:59] amen because it seeth him not neither
[1:39:02] knoweth him but ye know him for he
[1:39:05] dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[1:39:08] amen i will not leave you comfortless i
[1:39:11] will come to you
[1:39:13] isn't that a great security of feeling
[1:39:15] i'm not going to leave you my brother
[1:39:17] and sister i'm sorry to dwell on this
[1:39:19] but this is what god laid on my heart
[1:39:21] i'm telling you we got some believers
[1:39:23] that are over there in eastern europe
[1:39:25] and they are there in dire circumstances
[1:39:27] some of them not having come out of
[1:39:29] their basements in days and they are not
[1:39:32] comfortless
[1:39:34] [Applause]
[1:39:37] why because they've got
[1:39:39] amen oh how do i even describe it amen
[1:39:42] they shall call him the prince of peace
[1:39:45] amen we go right down the list it
[1:39:47] burdens our heart there's believers that
[1:39:50] are testifying this is not our battle
[1:39:53] this is the lord's battle and he's
[1:39:56] already prevailed
[1:39:59] now that doesn't excuse us from prayers
[1:40:02] and support if we can send money to them
[1:40:05] and these kind of things but i'm telling
[1:40:07] you there's much more than the things of
[1:40:10] this life the carnal needs of this life
[1:40:12] there's much more to that and that is
[1:40:15] that comfort and peace of the soul to
[1:40:18] know that i gave myself to the lord
[1:40:20] jesus christ he's taking care of me
[1:40:24] hallelujah we look so much to the flesh
[1:40:27] we look so much to the carnal things of
[1:40:29] life
[1:40:30] oh god help us
[1:40:33] oh help us amen
[1:40:38] but you know him for he dwelleth with
[1:40:40] you and shall be in you i will not leave
[1:40:42] you comfortless i will come to you yet a
[1:40:45] little while and the world seeth me no
[1:40:46] more
[1:40:48] but you see me
[1:40:51] oh look at the beauty of this my brother
[1:40:53] and sister it's not just about i come to
[1:40:56] the message this is about that
[1:40:58] relationship that i have met my lord and
[1:41:01] savior face to face and i looked upon
[1:41:04] him and he looked upon me and we are
[1:41:07] looking oh some i've said it myself god
[1:41:09] forgive me but we're like oh i just hope
[1:41:11] i can keep those words well done my good
[1:41:14] faithful servant if we will follow the
[1:41:16] word we will hear the words
[1:41:19] it won't be a question of maybe
[1:41:23] we follow the word we'll hear the words
[1:41:27] hallelujah
[1:41:28] amen because i live you shall live also
[1:41:32] oh isn't that beautiful
[1:41:35] amen
[1:41:37] hallelujah
[1:41:39] now i love this sermon here
[1:41:42] christ is revealed in his own word
[1:41:46] this is just a tremendous sermon
[1:41:48] because you see what the prophet of god
[1:41:50] does
[1:41:51] is he just takes you back to the word
[1:41:53] back to the word
[1:41:55] back to the word
[1:41:56] back to the word
[1:41:58] and he says now
[1:42:02] my mind's racing fast enough i'm going
[1:42:04] to get my stuff messed up here
[1:42:10] brother branham says
[1:42:13] if you read your bible
[1:42:16] and you don't see christ
[1:42:19] in every page or
[1:42:21] word verse
[1:42:24] go read it again
[1:42:28] you see it comes back to seeing
[1:42:30] if you don't see him
[1:42:33] amen
[1:42:35] now there's an opinion okay am i allowed
[1:42:37] to mark opinion
[1:42:39] i'm opinionated as all get out my
[1:42:41] family's told me so
[1:42:43] no i just but anyway
[1:42:51] i read the church age book in a year
[1:42:54] i read my bible in a year i read the
[1:42:56] seals book in a year
[1:42:58] and some who read all three in a year
[1:43:03] but i have one question for you
[1:43:05] when you read that
[1:43:07] what did you see
[1:43:12] you know when i was younger and i used
[1:43:13] to think that really meant something
[1:43:16] i'd read 400 page books
[1:43:20] in two
[1:43:22] days and all the high points of the
[1:43:25] story i could recount them to you
[1:43:28] but sometimes you'd have to turn around
[1:43:30] and flip back through the book to find
[1:43:32] out why fred did what fred did because
[1:43:34] you don't know why fred did what fred
[1:43:36] did because you glossed right over it
[1:43:43] and i read my bible in a year
[1:43:46] and i got no more out of it than i did
[1:43:49] when i read it in a year
[1:43:51] last year
[1:43:55] now go ahead read your bible in a year
[1:43:57] i'm not i'm not speaking against that
[1:44:00] but while you're reading three four five
[1:44:02] chapters a day
[1:44:04] why don't you take another 10 minutes
[1:44:06] and focus on a few verses
[1:44:09] and actually digest those
[1:44:12] and pray over it and say lord what does
[1:44:14] that really mean
[1:44:16] i need to know what that really means
[1:44:19] because you see if we don't know why
[1:44:21] fred did what fred did the only thing we
[1:44:24] can do is start going backwards
[1:44:26] trying to find out why did fred do
[1:44:29] what fred did
[1:44:31] well if you want to know what the whole
[1:44:32] deal in that story was fred killed his
[1:44:34] best friend
[1:44:36] now why would fred kill his best friend
[1:44:39] i don't know somewhere i missed it
[1:44:42] and if you don't know who you are
[1:44:44] and you don't see christ in every
[1:44:48] line and every chapter every book
[1:44:53] if we don't see that saints reading it a
[1:44:55] year means nothing
[1:44:57] we got to go back now and start
[1:44:59] searching where did i fall into this how
[1:45:02] did i fit into this where was this
[1:45:06] it's more about revelation than volume
[1:45:09] we can say well i've listened to every i
[1:45:12] remember there was a sister years ago my
[1:45:14] brother and sister and she would have
[1:45:15] chewed you up like a mad beaver with a
[1:45:17] chainsaw but she had listened to every
[1:45:20] message in the message seven times
[1:45:25] and she'd ripped your own leg off and
[1:45:27] beat you with it
[1:45:30] something's missing
[1:45:33] she didn't get something in there
[1:45:36] she decided volume i'm not speaking ill
[1:45:38] of her but subsided volume was more
[1:45:40] important than revelation
[1:45:42] i'm here to tell you if you never listen
[1:45:44] to every message the prophet preached
[1:45:46] and you haven't read every word or verse
[1:45:49] in the bible but you have seen christ
[1:45:51] then you have seen a great thing
[1:46:00] reminds me of a brother telling me one
[1:46:02] time he said i was there in the
[1:46:03] genealogies and i was reading and they
[1:46:05] begot and they begot and they begot and
[1:46:08] he woke up
[1:46:12] that's what the genealogy will do to you
[1:46:15] and he begot and then you're like wait
[1:46:17] there's two names here is this the same
[1:46:18] no it's not reason was you fell asleep
[1:46:20] your bible closed you thumbed yourself
[1:46:22] back there and ended up on a different
[1:46:23] page
[1:46:25] that's not going to do it for you
[1:46:28] but meeting the christ
[1:46:30] of the bible
[1:46:32] face to face
[1:46:34] to be able to say i've seen him
[1:46:37] i've seen him in his word and i'll never
[1:46:39] be the same it's a brand new book to me
[1:46:43] oh hallelujah now let's look i've got to
[1:46:45] hurry along here
[1:46:46] christ is revealing his own word you
[1:46:48] can't see with your hands
[1:46:55] the technical people will tell you well
[1:46:57] yes i can if the lights are completely
[1:46:59] out i can walk through the room
[1:47:05] you guys have memorized your living room
[1:47:08] bedroom right
[1:47:11] and you can get out of bed in the middle
[1:47:12] of the night in the dark and you can
[1:47:14] walk to your bathroom
[1:47:16] and hit the door
[1:47:18] absolutely without air
[1:47:20] until your wife puts a mirror on the
[1:47:22] wall
[1:47:23] that reflects the light of the crack of
[1:47:25] the door perfectly and you find yourself
[1:47:28] in the middle of the night
[1:47:35] and you're like what happened
[1:47:37] because you're asleep and it's like i i
[1:47:38] what happened
[1:47:41] and then you realize
[1:47:43] that's a mirror
[1:47:45] wow
[1:47:47] come on life lessons sometimes you know
[1:47:49] the prophet said the pastor preaches
[1:47:50] things that he's going through himself
[1:47:55] come on
[1:47:56] you realize your hands work fine in the
[1:47:59] dark after you've hit something
[1:48:03] yet it's part of the body you can't see
[1:48:05] with your ears yet it can hear you can't
[1:48:07] see with the nose yet it smells you
[1:48:09] can't see with lips though it speaks see
[1:48:11] that was the pentecostal age but now
[1:48:14] it's the eye time
[1:48:16] now not get caught up here in like what
[1:48:18] he was just talking about looking with
[1:48:19] the eyes don't get caught up with this
[1:48:20] catch the revelation
[1:48:22] the seeing
[1:48:24] ah the seeing it's the eye time the
[1:48:27] seeing not with natural eyes but with a
[1:48:29] spiritual eye see the revealed word
[1:48:33] now see now there's a one moving factor
[1:48:36] to be on the eye is that right the next
[1:48:38] is intelligence which is christ him
[1:48:40] itself who controls the whole body no
[1:48:42] moving i like this little humor in here
[1:48:44] if you see most of you probably already
[1:48:46] read ahead of me but
[1:48:48] no moving no motion beyond that see
[1:48:50] everything else has moved see move your
[1:48:52] feet move your muscles and your legs
[1:48:53] move everything move your ears can move
[1:48:56] i had a friend once that could just make
[1:48:58] his ear go
[1:49:00] amazing gift
[1:49:09] your ears can move your nose your lips
[1:49:11] and so forth but after your eyes there's
[1:49:14] nothing that moves that's why they claim
[1:49:15] that men get boldheaded
[1:49:20] [Laughter]
[1:49:23] oh my
[1:49:25] i tell you what i've already made it too
[1:49:26] far but i might have to start an
[1:49:28] exercise program
[1:49:30] but look at this i say the profit of
[1:49:32] god's got a sense of humor that's why
[1:49:34] they claim the men get bald-headed is
[1:49:36] because you see there's no exercise to
[1:49:37] develop the muscle in the hair the scalp
[1:49:40] you see and it's not got a cushion so
[1:49:42] that they can get blood in there
[1:49:45] the blood won't pump through see it
[1:49:46] won't go up in furnished blood of course
[1:49:48] the hair root lives by blood and now we
[1:49:51] find out that that part you see there is
[1:49:53] nothing beyond the eye now let's find
[1:49:56] out it shall be light
[1:49:58] about the middle of the day
[1:50:02] no
[1:50:04] at the evening time what is the light
[1:50:07] sent for so you can see
[1:50:11] hallelujah that's why this revealed word
[1:50:13] of the hour is talking about a light
[1:50:15] shining in the darkness in the evening
[1:50:18] time is called we can see
[1:50:22] thank you lord
[1:50:23] we're not going to wander around in the
[1:50:25] dark well god's in a trinity but not
[1:50:28] that kind of trinity a different trinity
[1:50:30] how many trinities can there be
[1:50:36] see where you're at shall be light about
[1:50:38] the evening time
[1:50:40] now you take that now and compare it
[1:50:42] over malachi 4. he promised that there
[1:50:44] would be a light come again in the
[1:50:45] evening time see for behold i will send
[1:50:47] you elijah the prophet and he will
[1:50:49] restore the children back to the fathers
[1:50:51] and the fathers to the children is that
[1:50:53] right lest i commit the earth with a
[1:50:55] curse now let's take john or saying luke
[1:50:57] 17 30 and watch what jesus prophesied
[1:51:00] they're saying as it was in the days of
[1:51:02] sodom it'll be the same
[1:51:04] now i want you to listen real careful
[1:51:06] here because if you don't you'll get
[1:51:07] stumbled on this now notice
[1:51:10] this is at the time when the son of man
[1:51:12] would be revealed right sodom time
[1:51:15] amen and as it was in the days of sodom
[1:51:18] the revealing of the son of man
[1:51:20] now the son of man was actually revealed
[1:51:23] potentially
[1:51:30] i think the prophet god could have said
[1:51:32] absolutely
[1:51:34] i don't think he had to put the word
[1:51:35] potentially there but the lord probably
[1:51:37] spoke to him he put that potentially
[1:51:40] just for a few moments there just before
[1:51:41] sodom was burned
[1:51:43] now that man was elohim
[1:51:45] that was god and jesus is god and god
[1:51:48] was revealed potentially right there for
[1:51:50] a few moments to talk to abraham in the
[1:51:53] investigation judgment just for a little
[1:51:55] bit the son of man was revealed the son
[1:51:58] of man the son of man
[1:52:00] elohim do you see it church
[1:52:03] the son of man elohim was revealed just
[1:52:06] for a few minutes for the very next
[1:52:09] morning she was burned when before the
[1:52:11] sun could come up again
[1:52:14] now look at this my brother and sister
[1:52:16] if that was a type
[1:52:19] of our day
[1:52:21] then the son of man
[1:52:28] potentially i hope you get this
[1:52:33] was revealed
[1:52:35] to you
[1:52:39] oh the technicals of the messages say
[1:52:42] now if he is stepped from the throne
[1:52:44] then the mercy seat
[1:52:47] is finished it's empty
[1:52:49] but the prophet of god said the mercy
[1:52:51] seat is in the heart of the believer
[1:52:53] so for you and i the mercy seat will
[1:52:57] never be empty
[1:53:02] did you make the connection there
[1:53:05] the son of man
[1:53:07] potentially
[1:53:09] you know why use the word potential
[1:53:12] because not everyone would see it
[1:53:15] if he said there he is right here
[1:53:17] then the whole world could looked upon
[1:53:18] it with revelation but it wasn't its
[1:53:21] potential because it's reserved to those
[1:53:23] it was reserved for
[1:53:26] and that's how you saw christ
[1:53:28] that's how you saw your bridegroom
[1:53:30] that's how you saw the lord jesus is
[1:53:33] because it was opened and the potentials
[1:53:35] of the word revealed it to you and you
[1:53:38] looked at that and said i believe
[1:53:42] and the word i've read the scriptures i
[1:53:43] won't go back and read them again you
[1:53:45] saw that and it become real to you and
[1:53:47] the world will say no no no you are in a
[1:53:49] cult you're in this you're in that
[1:53:50] you're following this you're following
[1:53:52] that and you'll say nope i'm sorry you
[1:53:54] think it's in a building in a book
[1:53:55] somewhere it's right here this is where
[1:53:58] it's at because i saw him all the
[1:54:01] potentials of the word was open to me
[1:54:05] and i had a clear vision
[1:54:09] and i saw it and i claim it
[1:54:12] oh hallelujah saints i hope it's real to
[1:54:14] you if it isn't it's just simply because
[1:54:16] i could not express it to you in the
[1:54:19] right fashion
[1:54:20] oh my
[1:54:22] amen
[1:54:25] i want to just throw this out i won't i
[1:54:26] won't elaborate on it
[1:54:28] but you see
[1:54:30] when elohim
[1:54:32] come down
[1:54:34] met with abraham
[1:54:36] this is before the judgment
[1:54:38] of sodom
[1:54:41] there was
[1:54:43] god himself in flesh
[1:54:48] and abraham recognized that amen
[1:54:52] he didn't say can i see some credentials
[1:54:53] can you like perform something proof to
[1:54:56] me you're who you are
[1:54:57] why because it was a word in him
[1:55:00] responded
[1:55:01] because he had already had a
[1:55:02] face-to-face encounter with the
[1:55:04] revelation of the word
[1:55:07] some people are so looking for the man
[1:55:10] so looking for the man you know i look i
[1:55:12] i don't like touching on these things
[1:55:13] but i believe sometimes we have to so
[1:55:15] people so many people are looking for as
[1:55:17] it were brother brown to come back my
[1:55:19] brother and sister what we need to make
[1:55:20] a rapture has already been drawn out of
[1:55:22] this word and given to us through a
[1:55:24] message that didn't come from brother
[1:55:25] branham it come from god himself and god
[1:55:28] said i choose this man as my vessel to
[1:55:30] carry the word and just as we read this
[1:55:32] scripture earlier my brother and sister
[1:55:34] it's not as it is the man we give
[1:55:36] reverence and we give honor i can't wait
[1:55:39] to meet him one day to shake his hand to
[1:55:42] thank him for his surrender to the word
[1:55:45] but my brother and sister we saw the
[1:55:46] verses right here it wasn't him it was
[1:55:49] god in him and brought the word out
[1:55:52] and so the very god that was in him is
[1:55:55] in you and i
[1:55:56] amen
[1:55:58] and we would no more
[1:56:00] glorify ourself
[1:56:03] hmm
[1:56:06] now look what abraham saw he's there
[1:56:09] a promise
[1:56:11] he got to see god in his grace and mercy
[1:56:13] because otherwise sarah had been struck
[1:56:15] dead on the spot
[1:56:17] and he got to see prophecy of the word
[1:56:24] and he saw the word
[1:56:28] you catch that
[1:56:30] he saw the word
[1:56:33] now look at the difference
[1:56:35] rich young ruler
[1:56:37] thought he saw the word
[1:56:43] he stood in the presence of the word and
[1:56:44] declared i have fulfilled all of this
[1:56:48] from my childhood and he stood in the
[1:56:50] face of the word and said the works that
[1:56:53] i have done by being obedient to the
[1:56:55] word of god has secured my position
[1:57:02] so he stood in the presence of the word
[1:57:04] and said i don't need any more
[1:57:06] oh please don't let that spirit that
[1:57:08] spirits around the age people around the
[1:57:10] message are saying i got enough of this
[1:57:12] message i don't even really need to dig
[1:57:14] into it anymore
[1:57:16] that's a lie of the devil my brother and
[1:57:17] sister that's a spirit that came right
[1:57:20] from that anointing that was on the rich
[1:57:22] young ruler that thought he had done it
[1:57:24] all well i'm telling you obedience to
[1:57:26] the word my brother and sister will not
[1:57:29] put you in the rapture
[1:57:31] amen oh scripture says obedience is
[1:57:34] better than sacrifice but you won't find
[1:57:36] the word saying obedience will put you
[1:57:38] in the rapture we have to have that
[1:57:40] personal seeing of jesus christ in our
[1:57:43] life in our relationship otherwise well
[1:57:46] we can be obedient rich young ruler was
[1:57:49] and so if obedience in the 21st century
[1:57:51] would get us in a rapture god's got to
[1:57:53] go raise the rich young ruler back up
[1:57:55] and restore him
[1:57:59] you see
[1:58:00] he done that by works of obedience not
[1:58:02] by revelation
[1:58:05] abraham moved forward by revelation
[1:58:08] and in the revelation he still made
[1:58:10] mistakes get that
[1:58:12] in obedience when we go to apply and be
[1:58:16] accounted worthy by obedience we
[1:58:19] don't want mistakes because mistakes
[1:58:21] then negate our obedience
[1:58:25] but when you go forward in revelation
[1:58:27] and you make mistakes you repent and god
[1:58:31] does not erase the revelation have you
[1:58:34] noticed that we get revelation and the
[1:58:37] devil comes acting like that roaring
[1:58:39] lion and we think oh lord i failed you
[1:58:41] god doesn't come back and say now you
[1:58:43] lose that position
[1:58:49] i'm sure glad it's by revelation because
[1:58:51] that obedience thing is just really hard
[1:58:54] especially you know to those who that
[1:58:56] repent every day
[1:58:59] those that don't make mistakes don't
[1:59:01] have to repent every day probably
[1:59:02] obedience is not that difficult for you
[1:59:08] i'm sorry i shouldn't be humorous about
[1:59:10] that
[1:59:12] but you see the rich young ruler never
[1:59:14] really saw the word he obeyed the word
[1:59:16] he never really saw the word
[1:59:17] because if he had saw the word he would
[1:59:20] have saw the word made flesh
[1:59:22] in front of him
[1:59:25] so people say i have a revelation of the
[1:59:27] message but
[1:59:29] they don't see christ right in front of
[1:59:31] them
[1:59:31] and they don't see a transforming power
[1:59:33] in their life
[1:59:35] i'm sorry my brother and sister
[1:59:37] it's hard
[1:59:39] it's hard to accept that
[1:59:41] now
[1:59:45] let's just go through here we're going
[1:59:46] to close
[1:59:48] well i've already took so much time
[1:59:51] my
[1:59:54] exposition of seven church ages
[1:59:56] philadelphia church age
[1:59:58] brother brown here says revelations 3 13
[2:00:01] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[2:00:02] the spirit saith unto the churches every
[2:00:05] age ends with this same warning
[2:00:07] it is a constant plea that the churches
[2:00:10] listen to the voice of the lord in this
[2:00:12] age the plea is even more insistent than
[2:00:14] in former ages for in this age the
[2:00:16] coming of the lord truly draws nigh the
[2:00:19] question would perhaps arise is there
[2:00:22] another age beyond this one
[2:00:25] if there is another age beyond this one
[2:00:27] why the urgency
[2:00:29] the answer lies herein the last stage
[2:00:31] will be a short one
[2:00:32] a quick work of consummation
[2:00:36] i i want you to go back if you want to
[2:00:38] and study this out my brother and sister
[2:00:41] consummation is not a casual
[2:00:44] relationship
[2:00:47] consummation
[2:00:49] is intimacy amen amen
[2:00:52] so it's going to be
[2:00:54] a quick work
[2:00:56] of an intimate
[2:00:58] nature
[2:01:01] this little bride's not going to say
[2:01:02] we're chris christians we're message
[2:01:05] believers
[2:01:07] no sir
[2:01:08] she's actually going to kind of come
[2:01:10] across as a fanatic
[2:01:13] you know that whole thing
[2:01:16] you first get married
[2:01:27] and you want to be really close to her
[2:01:29] she wants to be really close to you
[2:01:32] it's that time you know this the love of
[2:01:34] my life
[2:01:38] she would say i gave myself to him and i
[2:01:40] took his name and he would be there
[2:01:42] saying she gave herself to me and took
[2:01:44] my name
[2:01:46] same thing different words
[2:01:50] and they just like to do everything
[2:01:51] together they it's just so close it's
[2:01:54] there
[2:01:56] and this short quick work my brother and
[2:01:58] sister
[2:01:59] oh
[2:02:00] i don't mean to grind any axes please
[2:02:02] forgive me
[2:02:05] but i don't really want to hear about
[2:02:07] how many years people have been in the
[2:02:09] message
[2:02:11] it means nothing
[2:02:13] it means nothing
[2:02:14] if they have lost the intimacy
[2:02:18] if they have come to the place that the
[2:02:20] real boast that they have in their life
[2:02:22] is that they've been in the message for
[2:02:24] 50 years
[2:02:26] no
[2:02:27] sorry i'm not impressed
[2:02:29] what impresses me
[2:02:31] is a burning desire
[2:02:33] of the intimacy of the word
[2:02:36] that i can't just do
[2:02:38] look i i've been really busy this winter
[2:02:41] i don't know why things have been that
[2:02:43] way some of you will
[2:02:44] definitely relate
[2:02:48] and my own wife here a few days ago i
[2:02:50] said somehow i will do this for you and
[2:02:51] she goes i don't want you to do that for
[2:02:53] me i want you to be here and talk to me
[2:02:56] and be around me and
[2:02:59] you know it strikes you deep in the
[2:03:00] heart
[2:03:03] you see
[2:03:04] we can give good gifts to god
[2:03:09] we can labor and we can do all these
[2:03:11] things and say i did this for you lord i
[2:03:13] did this for you lord but
[2:03:15] you see that's not what he's looking for
[2:03:18] he's looking for the fire of intimacy
[2:03:22] the fire of when we come as it were into
[2:03:25] his presence that he sees our heart and
[2:03:29] we can see his heart and we are so
[2:03:32] excited
[2:03:34] but you see satan comes and just as it
[2:03:37] is in many marriages one of the most
[2:03:39] common
[2:03:41] most common things it's brought
[2:03:43] into divorce court
[2:03:46] is often under the subtitle in
[2:03:48] reconciliable differences
[2:03:50] but when they dig deeper
[2:03:52] the actual written out thing will be
[2:03:55] we've grown apart and have nothing in
[2:03:58] common
[2:04:06] come on church
[2:04:09] the devil wants to divorce you from the
[2:04:11] word
[2:04:12] he wants you to get to where i'm a
[2:04:14] message believer everything's going to
[2:04:16] be all right
[2:04:17] i'll tell you what i refer to it all the
[2:04:19] time and i'll take you back briefly here
[2:04:21] i can assure you they were all concerned
[2:04:24] about esther when she said i'm going to
[2:04:26] go i'm going to talk to the king asked
[2:04:28] her you can't do that because if he
[2:04:30] rejects you and he doesn't lift up the
[2:04:32] scepter then you will never see him
[2:04:34] again and you will just live as it were
[2:04:36] in exile
[2:04:38] but she had a secret that they didn't
[2:04:40] know
[2:04:41] she had saw his heart
[2:04:44] and she knew she wasn't just a queen to
[2:04:49] a king but she was the queen to the king
[2:04:54] and there she had a confidence to stand
[2:04:57] on the word of god in her hour and say i
[2:05:00] have need and i'm coming boldly to the
[2:05:02] throne
[2:05:03] hallelujah
[2:05:05] oh hallelujah
[2:05:06] where was i last stage will be a short
[2:05:08] one a quick work of consummation and not
[2:05:10] only is this so but one must always
[2:05:13] remember that in the eyes of god time is
[2:05:15] so very fleeting yea a thousand years or
[2:05:18] about a day and if he is coming within a
[2:05:20] few hours as he views time then he
[2:05:22] surely must warn us with all urgency
[2:05:26] and his voice
[2:05:28] must continually sound
[2:05:32] in our minds
[2:05:35] no
[2:05:36] no
[2:05:38] because that's where we see the
[2:05:40] revelation of jesus christ our
[2:05:43] bridegroom
[2:05:44] is in the heart
[2:05:48] must continually sound in our hearts to
[2:05:51] be ready against that coming amen oh
[2:05:54] thank you lord
[2:05:55] now look
[2:05:57] i'm glad actually praise the lord this
[2:05:59] broke off right where it did i had no
[2:06:01] idea but this is perfect
[2:06:04] but the musicians come please
[2:06:07] oh there are so many voices in the world
[2:06:10] so many problems and needs crying for
[2:06:12] attention
[2:06:14] but there will never be a voice so
[2:06:17] important
[2:06:18] and so worth attending as a voice of the
[2:06:21] spirit
[2:06:22] so he the hath and ear to hear let him
[2:06:25] hear with the spirit saith unto the
[2:06:27] churches i want to read that again so
[2:06:30] many voices
[2:06:34] so many problems and needs crying for
[2:06:37] attention is that not the truth
[2:06:40] but they'll never be a voice so
[2:06:42] important and so worth attending as the
[2:06:44] voice of the spirit
[2:06:47] you know how hard it is saints
[2:06:48] our hearts are breaking we have through
[2:06:50] the years we've seen this south africa
[2:06:53] apartheid things happening believers
[2:06:56] drug out of their cars and beaten in the
[2:06:58] streets
[2:07:03] oh my we got to do something about this
[2:07:08] pinochet south america
[2:07:11] people just disappear
[2:07:13] your son might walk out the door and go
[2:07:14] to the grocery store and never be heard
[2:07:16] from ever again
[2:07:18] only to find out he became one of the
[2:07:20] tens and hundreds of thousands that they
[2:07:22] shot and threw in a pit somewhere
[2:07:27] what's happening now eastern europe
[2:07:32] come on
[2:07:33] there's two sides to every coin saints
[2:07:36] we need to give attention and prayer to
[2:07:38] the needs of the saints in all these
[2:07:40] different places
[2:07:42] but not at the expense of losing
[2:07:45] the ability to hear the voice
[2:07:48] of the spirit
[2:07:50] in grace tabernacle
[2:07:52] in nampa idaho we can give all kinds of
[2:07:54] money and time and efforts and do all of
[2:07:57] this but if the spirit leaves here
[2:07:59] and we can't hear it
[2:08:02] we're the losers it is they may have i
[2:08:04] know that many won't be happy to hear me
[2:08:07] say this in this way
[2:08:08] they may have to give their life
[2:08:13] but that don't mean we come to a place
[2:08:15] that we waste ours yes
[2:08:21] let's hear the voice
[2:08:24] let's attend to the voice of the spirit
[2:08:26] saints
[2:08:27] let's see
[2:08:30] who jesus christ really is
[2:08:32] let us see the beauty
[2:08:35] of the gospel of jesus christ in our
