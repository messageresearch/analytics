the words of this song to to set your wings amen an action God doing something in you and I to cause us to step out of our position and take action I think that's very descriptive of the bride of Christ in this day is she is a bride that knows how to take action amen she can come hear the word of God take it home be a hearer but she's also a doer amen aren't you glad God anointed us to do that we have so many visitors today I say God bless you to each and every one of you that's here uh we welcome each one of you trust the Lord bless you today Amen brother Adrian sister aah and the children uh just uh I didn't realize you was going to be here this soon otherwise you might be preaching today amen but uh sister April my I'm going to I'm going to chastise you a little bit you know you could at least let us know you're coming home but uh anyway we are so happy I I can only imagine what you would have to share just reading between the lines of of what you have shared uh and uh you know may each and every one of us may Our Lives touch those in this world Amen we don't want to just pastor this life saying well praise God I I managed to overcome Le oia I made it through but Lord let us touch those around us that we could encourage them and strengthen them and anyway I know that there will be a lot of stories Maybe by God's grace we'll have opportunity to hear them and I imagine you're probably going to spend Thanksgiving with family yep so we get robbed out of that amen well Hallelujah we are so happy uh sister April we pray for you constantly uh didn't bother you too much sending texts and stuff sometimes they can be a distraction but I certainly want you to know the church prayed for you constantly and uh it is a beautiful thing to be a part of a body amen and uh it's U just a lovely time amen uh just before we stand here um I got a couple things there'll be no Wednesday service and I bring you um greetings from brother Dwayne sister Connie I would take too much time this morning to share the incredible things that we experienced there we got to see the Lord I shared with brother Alex just a little bit we got to see the Lord do the Supernatural and you say well what was that a healing a great Deliverance no what it was is the Lord anointing now this might sound boastful to some people but the Lord anointing the ministry to speak the things that touch the lives of the people people and the ministry is completely naive to what is happening does not have any clue of what God is doing but yet after the fact God brings it about and shows that it was spot on and I say thank you Lord because I happen to be that Ministry and we're not here to boast about that but we're here to say Thank You Lord that you would use us to speak to your people amen and I forgot brother Philip right yeah I forgot to greet you brother Phillip we're glad to have you here brother Phillip is Sister Diane's brother and um so I don't know if we can make this claim but I think he's probably high on the list of of brother there so put right at the top of that list but uh we thank the Lord for that opportunity that we we had there Saskatoon and in Edmonton both just lovely lovely times and it would take a whole service literally to share the things that that we got to see what God did and uh how that he come about answering prayers answering questions and and uh just a lovely time and I say thank you to each and every one of you for your prayers amen uh for it made for a a lovely time brother Dwayne sister Connie send their greetings brother Eugene and Sister Sarah send their greetings also uh I want to say anyone who doesn't have a place to go for Thanksgiving our house is open so I put that as an open invitation and uh we're trying to figure out what to do about uh service on the weekend brother Alex praise the Lord Brother Alex is getting married yes Hallelujah yeah amen the scripture says blessed is the man who gets a good wife and I think brother Alex is blessed so uh those of you won't be going to the wedding could you let us know so we can make sure that we make the right decisions here uh at the church um just a quick text or just share that um if nobody's going to be here there's no need turning the lights on but if you're going to be here uh I don't know I put Brother David in a spot he said well he's still praying about it but he said he he would he would take care of uh the Saints here at the church if that was if that was necessary or that was the case so amen um what I'm going to speak today uh you have heard God bless you musicians beautiful music this morning I thank the Lord that we have these gifts in our assembly uh it's just wonderful some of the things I'm going to speak this morning you have heard recently but I feel like uh that um I I should kind of connect them back together again as we would move forward and uh I just want to say I missed you each and every one of you I missed you and it was just uh you know uh thought about you a lot prayed for you and uh let's just stand as we go to the word I want to uh a titled the thought today proven to Perfection now my brother and sister I visited a brother who has a machine shop in Edmonton uh you know when once people get used to working in such tolerance they don't think it's anything to go to the hundreds of a thousands of an inch and the brother just talked about it very casually as he showed me these these deals that they're building as replacement parts for an existing machine and he's like these are down to a tolerance of 1 1,000th of an inch and I got to thinking about that what is perfection you see he's declaring something to one 1,000th of an inch but it's still not perfect and as we look at this thought today by God's grace we'll realize that our idea of perfection and God's idea of perfection are not quite the same amen and he said you know we ordered a new part which were several thousand dollar and they're rebuilding several hundred of these so you can see the math and the new part he said is of lesser tolerance than what we we are producing he says so we're exceeding the original oh I hope you catch this this morning we're exceeding the original and we don't feel like that's good enough that's it so let's look at this today proven to Perfection 1 Peter 4 12-13 now you're going to say brother Paul this seems like it's going a different direction but but please bear with me beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's suffering that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding Joy because when his glory is revealed your glory is revealed amen amen is't that beautiful Lord we ask you to bless the service today bless the visitors the Saints father so happy to be here together with each and everyone come now speak to our hearts Lord and draw Us close to you I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated you know sometimes in our Christian walk uh we we go along and the ups and downs of life and some of us may be a little bit more uh susceptible to the ups and downs than others but my brother and sister we if we're not careful we almost want God to be our grandfather and and that grandfather atmosphere is such that it's kind of like spoil me and tell me how wonderful I am now those of you that are grandparents you know that comes quite easily right you just want to hold those kids up close and and just tell them you know uh I love you mostess and then you got the next grandchild and you tell them I love you most and then the grandchildren start to grow up and say now which one of us is the mostest and uh you know my my own grandmother love bless her heart you know she she told every one of us grandchildren you know I want to give this to you I want to give this to you until she had split it in so many ways there really wasn't much there to give and you look at that and realize the very nature that Humanity has we we love that grandfather kind of atmosphere and you know uh it's just spoil me and tell me how wonderful I am and imagine my brother and sister that we as Sons and Daughters of God just wanting everything to be our way we want we want life to go our way we want God to answer our prayers the way that we want God to answer our prayers and and we want him the scripture says and he makes the way smooth before us and our idea of smooth is like glass and God's idea is I knock the biggest of the boulders out of your way and so it's there you can overcome all the rest and so we want it to be kind of our way and you know we have a savior who promised to bring us into a state or a condition of perfection and well look at that when you think about that 1 1,000 of an inch is just you know UNP perceptible to the human eye touch and and it's there that we look but you know this man this brother is uh just driven to to do things in the realm of perfection and um I thought it's interesting because they'll tell you that um you know that uh a messy desk is a sign of a smart person and this brother must be smart beyond measure amen because he had a very messy desk but you look at this and realize that something down in the heart is moving Sons and Daughters of God that we actually desire deep down in our heart to reach the state of perfection now my brother and sister because we in the flesh can never accomplish the Perfection of Christ but that word Moving On Us stirring our hearts is drawing us into a position where we want to be perfect and in any less desire than that if we have a spirit saying I I'll be close close is close enough my brother and sister that'll never do you need to have a spirit that is moving you and stirring your heart where you desire to come into perfection in our Lord Jesus Christ to be Flawless in Christ Jesus amen they'll never be Flawless In the Flesh you know the word shows us very clearly this flesh will bother us amen is there anybody here today that your flesh bothers you amen well don't be discouraged amen that's the word God doesn't want us to come to a place that we're complacent on this Earth complacent in our spiritual position he wants us to constantly strive some people feel like that if they're still yearning for something more they must be lacking something well that's true in one sense but it's not true in another because God put that nature in us to desire to live a higher life amen to not aim for a natural life or this but to be having a heavenly vision and if our vision is not a heavenly vision then what vision is it amen anything less than a heavenly vision is a carnal or Earthbound vision and God wants you to not look at this world right here and and he wants you to look up it's interesting as we are in Canada many brothers and sister ask me brother Paul how do you feel about the election and I said praise God the election was perfect and they're like really you I said no cuz whatever happen happened was God's will God's will is perfect amen we're not looking at this world my brother and sister you know Sister Jerry threw this out at me as we were traveling she said you know I think Donald Trump might be just the right guy for president and I said oh why she says cuz I think he would sign the note with the Pope what a what a different way to look at it caught me off guard right but there's got to be someone in a leadership position in this world in this country right now to fulfill the prophecy and so it's there God's going to have the right person in place the one that will say I'll sign that and my brother and sister that debts already there somebody's got to sign for it and by the way our country is set up you know he has the authority to commit you to the debt but my brother and sister the devil come right in and thought that's a perfect plan I think I have the authority to sign you to the debt but my brother and sister look what the word told us there is no debt no debt at all it's already been covered and the prophet of God come across this quote I should have included it if I thought I was going this way this morning the prophet of God said we are incurring a debt every single day backslide daily do we believe that I don't know about you guys you guys might be perfect but this guy is not perfect backslide daily and then the prophet says but that debt is paid by A Perfect sacrif rice daily oh Hallelujah I'm not incre a debt that I come one day and stand before the Lord pulling this great debt with me it's paid every single day thank you Lord Can someone say thank you Lord amen our debt is paid every single day amen so we have a savior our lord Jesus promised to bring us into state or condition of perfection and the only place we can find to be Flawless is in Jesus Christ now this is tempered a little bit by my experience with this brother and he says for as perfect as these pieces we are making seem to be when magnified there's all kinds of flaws amen now my brother and sister the Lord Jesus Christ comes and the only time he ever magnifies a flaw to you and I is when he wants us to see where we're standing never condemns us with it but look at with his great magnifying glass of Leo DEA is pointing out every flaw in your life every mistake that you're making and we view under that expanded Vision we say I'm not good enough to go to church I'm not good enough to take communion my brother and sister there's all kinds of things that Satan offers up to us but I want you today just speaking about communion let me be a little pointed on that if you're sitting here today and you're not taking communion I want to know why that's right not a man you don't have to answer to me but I want you to face the fact that God called you to take communion you're not taking it what kind of flaw do you think you have in your life that would be keeping you from communion when God said every day I pay your debt for you every day I pay that debt I have an atonement a sacrifice for you what would keep us it's a lie of the devil I'll tell you that's what's keeping us and I hope I'm not too blunt to you but I've just had another little transition in my life in case you don't know I got a few days older and so I've got a few days bunter amen so it's time for us my brother and sister to stop why when the scripture placed it the prophet placed it why do we let Satan's lie keep us from fulfilling it from doing it we should be saying okay the debts paid I'm going to take communion I'm going to let the world know let the devil know that I am in communion with the Lord Jesus Christ amen but the the devil presents all kinds of ideas all kinds of doctrines men's ideas that men like well you have to this and you have to that to take communion that's not what my Bible showed me that's not what the message showed me he gives us a clear picture that we should be taking it till the coming of the Lord amen so amen if that stepped on your toes I'm sorry but um that's just how it is amen see never Flawless in the flesh flesh will bother you every day of your life job 1:1 there was a man in the land of us whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright one that feared God and rescued evil this is God's testimony of job isn't that awesome that testimony is recorded in the word amen so here is the word declaring that he is upright and perfect and feared God and Es skewed evil you couldn't ask for a better believer amen but I'll tell you my brother and sister job wasn't the only believer that God has that testimony of Amen it is not there that God says well I found a couple I'll record them in scripture he's reproducing his pattern over and over again today amen the word producing the same pattern again and again and again you see once God dialed it in which wasn't here in leoda it was before the foundation of the world God said this is when I say dialed it in it wasn't like he had an imperfect and cast it away another imperfect and cast it away when God said this is what I want my Believers to be and I'll record it in the word and I will uh record it for posterity that Sons and Daughters of God through all the ages will be able to live by the same exact pattern not a deviation of a pattern that's why the Apostle Paul said don't take one word away from it don't add one word to it because then you break God's pattern do you realize every one of us how different are we we start on the front row and now I'm not saying they're more different than the second row but possibility the very pattern of the word duplicated again and again and again God didn't have special standard for you special standard for them and you feel like you're inferior because you don't seem to be on the same standard as them no it's the same word same standard God has the same expectation and we'll get the same result that's the thing that ought to cause us to Rejoice is that God will produce the same life in you and I so look at the screen read the scripture put yourself in there right now we're in Idaho the city of Nampa we're off of Midland Boulevard and Boone Street amen there was a man in the land of n whose name was put your name in there and that man was perfect and upright one that feared God and Es skewed evil amen just cuz your name is not in those words there God's producing the same exact result in you and if we have any less expectation than that then the devil is lying to you and it's time for us to stop and say devil I'm not going to listen to your lies any longer the word says amen this is what the prophet told us this day that there would be a word bride amen amen not a denominational Spirit bride not a bride that's a mixture of this and a mixture of that but it would be a word bride which the word being perfect and being Christ himself amen we can expect the same exact result so look at this here job 1:1 put yourself in that scripture today and have expectation that you can live that and meet that amen now let's go here as it is to job 17 just jump down a few few verses and the Lord said unto Satan whence cometh thou then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered you see Satan never said I'm pursuing your servant job God says here is my servant job yeah my my you mean God would volunteer you and I but not us not us Lord let someone else have that fiery trial I like it nice and calm I like it to be just yeah lukewarm yeah yeah steel that's lukewarm is malleable still but pretty rigid in its thinking pretty rigid in its form but you see God wants us to be able to be formed by the word he wants us to be filled and so he he says here consider my servant job and there's none like him in the earth that's a pretty large compliment but remember it's as a prophet puts it one in a million makes this pretty small number don't take that and kick everybody else reminds me one time I was working on a construction job and I had a Jehovah Witness I'm not speaking down on them but to just kind of let you see how that we have to be careful how we look at things and and I'm working on this house and the man comes up and says can I talk to you and I I climbed down off of what I was working on and got down and I said yeah how can I help you and he says oh I'm a I'm a I'm a Jehovah Witness he gave me his name and uh he starts to tell me why I should join their church and uh at this point uh he's really laying out brother Trevor you would loved it cuz the way you think about things you would have loved this he's laying out this perfect picture of why I should be a Jehovah Witness and he gets to a point and he says you know our church is growing so fast there's 6.7 million of us and I just looked at him I said sir can I ask you a question yeah your belief is only 144,000 are going to heaven what are you doing with the rest of them he decided he had some place else to go but you see we don't want to become so narrow in our thinking that we build a fence around God's word and say well you know as it is you're in but you're out you know who you are right now doesn't look like a message believer to me so you must be out my brother and sister tomorrow the Holy Spirit might fall upon that man and he change his life and kind line himself up with the word and just have a miraculous change but we've still got him out that's right you know what that leaves us out of the will of God not him amen we need to think about this not putting people out amen so consider my servant and Satan answered the Lord and says doth job fear God for not hast thou not made a hedge about him you know what that tells us my brother and sister there's a hedge around you amen aren't you glad God's got a hedge around you amen cuz we get buffeted enough amen but you know what God's Not Afraid God's not afraid to go and open that hedge amen no one can open that hedge but him amen and so when you come to the place you're in fiery trials don't go even blaming the devil because God harnessed Satan put a bit in his mouth and put a a a harness on him to fulfill what he wanted to happen in job's life Satan thinking I'm in charge here now but God says you can't touch his life you can't take his life my brother and sister you realize that alone bound Satan this flesh is flesh God will allow this flesh to be tormented he'll allow diseases like cancer to come but that's not a cancer of the Soul it's a cancer of the flesh a cancer of the Soul comes with a lukewarm unprotected son or daughter of God or unbelief coming in and when the lifeline is cut off my brother and sister this flesh Withers Go In the Heat of the summer and just take any kind of plant you want and just take your Little Nippers and just clip that thing and see how long before that beautiful nice big flowing leaf and stem turns into nothing and that's what Satan wants to do but he can't come and use the Clipper on your life without your permission that's why Satan creeping in see he wants to creep in he wants to come in slowly so he can cut the life off slowly so we don't realize we're actually spiritually dying if the devil come and walked up to you you know the guy with horns and a pitchfork Fork tail come up and said you know what I'm going to take your life you would push back but when he takes it a millimeter at a time a day at a time the scripture says it's the lust of the Flesh and pride of life that's how he entices us you love the quote I believe brother brandham says you know that we have to go out to the devil CU if he come in he would be our brother so when we get out from underneath the blood that's where Satan starts to get to us the little things that have already creeped into our life and Satan is able then to add to it amen but that's not who we are this morning morning is it amen are we a church full of Sons and Daughters of God this morning Believers of the word amen we're going to live that word put it into action that's who we are today amen amen and we ought to be vocal about it I'm not saying that be vocal just to be heard but you know maybe it's in your closet amen maybe it's in your living room by yourself or car or whatever be vocal I am a Son of God I a daughter of God and Satan I'm not your property amen so the Lord offers job to the devil and uh you know God just opens that hedge and it it fulfills some people's idea that God is not a loving God but I want you to see get a little ahead of myself God saw something in job's life that job couldn't see that's right but let's stop now he said he was righteous man do we have a paradox here is a man who would make the Rapture follow me yes sir but God said making the Rapture is not actually the parameter I have set for your life come on are you with me we think about oh Lord I want to make the Rapture I want to make the Rapture but God says I want you to be perfect in my S it right through the word that's right so I'm not making a Doctrine here nobody get nervous okay let go of the seat cushion but you see God set a standard to make a Rapture right here but he's calling you and I even higher than that standard to make the Rapture otherwise if we just got to that little minute I'm thinking in millimeters cuz I've been listening to these Canadians for 2 weeks millimeter millimeter millimeter and I'm like um brother told me he says you know how much 40 mm is don't you brother Paul and I said uh it's a measurement cuz I have no clue what 40 millimeters is but if we got a half a millimeter oh maybe let's go a little further we got to one 1,000 of an inch over God's requirement for the Rapture you know what our human nature would be I made it yeah I'll crawl in over the threshold but that's not what God's calling you and I to do he called us to be Sons and Daughters of God molded In His Image amen and he as a conqueror coming as a deliverer and bringing the word my brother and sister he said I didn't just bring enough word for them to make a Rapture I brought enough word to deliver them from every Affliction everything in life everything that could be a hindrance even if I declare them perfect I'm calling them higher amen we got to get rid of the idea that I'm just going to do enough to make a Rapture I want to do enough to fulfill God's desire in my life and in your life that God's desire will be fulfilled in us a word living amen you see if the Lord was afraid of the result in job he had never opened a hedge that's right if he was afraid of the result of the word in your life he would put a guard of Angels around you day and night not even let a single thought come to you right but he's got so much confidence in you and I that in this day Leo DEA 2024 we never thought we would be here on the earth at this time and we're still here and it's not looking any better in the future and he's opening the Hedge I've got confidence in you you can do it amen why because you're my word in flesh that's it amen he no longer has to look back to Calvary my brother and sister he's not looking back to anything in the past not even before the foundation of the world because the deposit has already been made and the word has come to life and it's growing and it's growing and it's growing and God doesn't keep a low standard for you and I just so we can get and say well cuz I was bride to Christ I made it no you're going to make it because life that is in the word is living in you amen amen otherwise we would take that package of whatever and throw it out in the garden and say the seed is planted but my brother and sister God says I put it in the soil the correct soil and I will nurture that and give every nutrient does that mean that the wind won't blow no doesn't mean that it won't get cold at night no it doesn't mean that the little varmits won't Trum try and chew the leaves off of it no my brother and sister but he says my seed will produce it will produce of its own kind it will produce the word for this hour amen so God Amen opens a hedge I want to ask you a question was job more of a Believer than you come on Saints not to be a resounding no he was not more of a believer than I am because you see the word that was planted before the foundation of the world was God's word and God didn't say I'm going to you know let job be an overcomer and I'm going to make you struggle your whole life we don't know the whole story of job that's right we see what God chose to put in the book but if God wrote a second book of Acts this morning you would be shocked at what God is writing about you you would say is that really me I don't remember being like that I don't remember being that man but that's how God looked at it and says you know what this is who you are this is the second book of Acts being written over commerce facing every challenge standing on the word and having it counted as righteousness to you and we would say I don't know I don't recognize this person but you're looking through carnal eyes God's Looking Through The Eyes of the word Through the Ages and declaring who we are Hallelujah we get to this idea Enoch Superman job Superman amen Moses Superman Joshua Superman Caleb Superman they were men we got part of it right they were men but they believed the word and they took the word in and when they were weak the word made them strong amen not that they were Supermen but their grip their hold on the word is what made them who they were and you and I have that same ability to hold on to the word and not let go and say God said and I believe him amen hallelujah job not more of a Believer than you not more valuable to God than you look I'm not I'm not trying to Hype you this morning but I believe the old outage of saving the best for last is true amen oh we we sit here today man I'm a failure I'm a failure I did this I thought that I I looked at that I'm a failure I believe with all of my heart not to make a doctrine of this I don't mean to do that but I believe with all of my heart the reason you are here as a Believer today is God said I'm saving my Best For Last my sons my daughters are going to be Overcomers taking the word believing the word acting on the word they will be successful in this endeavor that I have placed them in and if you think any less of yourself what have you got to offer the prophet of God said when you speak those negative words you're talking the devil's language amen I'm not going to speak the devil's language I'm going to believe what God said about me see they were not more valuable they didn't have more value to God than you do and God come and rescued them from the spirit of their day the prophet of God said that this would be the most wicked age so of all the ages I've heard people say before Oh you know I think even as bad as the Coliseum and the Dark Ages were it might be better than this day my brother and sister if you can't overcome in this day you wouldn't have overcome in that day right and God didn't call you to go face a lion face to face he called you to face an innumerable Angels of Darkness wickedness in high places that's right I think a lion would have actually been pretty easy quite honestly right maybe we'd overcome the lion by saying hey lion Here I Am The Lion would have said whoa whoa whoa just a second now what are you doing but here we are today Lord let the Rapture come in the morning I don't think I can last another week wrong Spirit wrong Spirit Saints you see we got to come to the place that whether it's raining or shining it's hot or it's cold we're in the Coliseum of leoda or not that we can stand and say I know just like job come to my redeemer liveth amen and while the skin worms may eat this flesh I know who I am you see the problem is is we've set our sights so low that we no longer really honestly look in Heavenly places we're looking well so and so said and they did this and they did that and I don't know the song service was pretty flat I don't know if the song leader didn't study just randomly grabbed some songs or I I just don't know well I tell you imagine if God fed us naturally yeah with the hunger we have spiritually my we wouldn't need a diet program we'd come to church and we sit there and say pretty flat service we go home and open the fridge there's nothing there go to the restaurant and they'd say oh sorry here's your menu open it up water and crackers am I making sense God help us God help us see God's moving us into Perfection amen amen the Lord did not look at job in his flesh he said he was perfect but he wasn't looking at job and his flesh he was looking at him through the perfect word and the perfect word showed that job was a perfect man amen and the perfect word has come been delivered to you and I amen and this perfect word my brother and sister has come the price has been paid daily in other words the blood is still covering us every single day it wasn't a one-time event he's covering us and God's looking at us through the blood and we're standing here today I can't this and I can't that Lord asking you to do something I can't do that come on my brother and sister let's get into the right rhythm with the word and when we get in the right rhythm with the word we can see I can do all things through Christ Jesus amen that's not even just a spiritual thing but you want to go out here in the natural you have the right motive you have the right objective you want to start a business or do something and when we're approaching it correctly we should be able to stop and say you know what Lord you know my heart you know what I want to do now Lord I'm asking you with confidence with boldness bless it amen because I'm not asking that for my flesh as a Son of God I'm asking so the Lord looked at him through the perfect word at a finished work my had any fiery trials lately yes some of you didn't respond praise God you are living in Utopia but that's not the truth that's right have you asked for fiery Tri remember brother jeel praise God never pray for patience what did God do took brother juel through some of the most fiery trials a man can face what happened through all of that he come out with a testimony just like job praise the Lord amen my God's in control amen amen amen he lifts me up amen he sets me down am he brings me in he sends me out blessed be the name of the Lord did Brother juel write that prescription I'll guarantee you not cuz I know Humanity we wouldn't write it he didn't write it but God said I know what I'm going to do amen bless our brother juwel amen because he truly as sons of God is a jewel amen so the fiery trials look what Satan put job through can I take the little switch on the recorder let's rewind what statement right here let's play it again look what Satan put job through I'm not playing games with you Saints no sir but it's a little bit of a misleading statement y let's rewind it again look what what Satan put job through who was the master of the Hedge that's it it wasn't Satan Satan never put job through that trial it was God who harness put the bit in Satan's mouth put the harness on him and said there's something in job's life that I want to burn out of job and so therefore job's going through this trial until he overcomes it and we'll cut it to the short my brother and sisters job actually had a little Spirit of Pride concerning his spiritual condition that's right and God says no no no no going to burn that out of you and I don't want to repr preach job here but my brother and sister God actually had to let the devil go to overtime and start working on job until job woke up one day after going through this fiery trial job woke up one one day and realized I'm not the Christian I thought I was cuz you know how I can make that statement that job would have said that because if we're not careful spiritual Pride will bring you and I to the place that we think we figured this Christian thing out and the minute God pulls his hand off of us y That's it right in the dust that's right Lord burn every drop of Pride out of us burn it out of us Lord that we won't think we have done a single thing the prophet of God you can look this up look at this my brother and sister under the search you'll find it human ability see what the prophet of God says about that there's not one human ability that we have amen we heard a lovely special today the music being played it blessed my heart my brother and sister but if we sit here and say look what I have we will fail but when we say thank you Lord for the gift that you placed in me amen it doesn't matter I'm not implying anything it doesn't matter if it hits every note correctly it's the anointing of the holy ghost that comes with those words because God is blessing it amen but when we think that we can do this in our own self we think we can be that kind and there was job coming dealing with his friends dealing with his wife dealing with all of this thinking no you guys don't understand I've done the word I've lived the word I've done this and God comes along and shows him job you've done nothing you've done nothing hallelujah what was he doing bringing him proving him into Perfection to come and realize my brother and sister I think we got a church full of jobes I apologize to all of you we got a church full of jobes if we're not careful we think we did something that's it my oh my amen it's God that did it that's it and let's surrender yield ourselves and let God do it again and again and again and again drawing us into Heavenly places into the Rapture of our soul my brother and sister let God bring us into the Rapture amen cuz as far as I know nobody can make the Rapture happen Christ working in his bride will bring a Rapture but we can't make a Rapture happen so he's dealing with it I'll go back and reiterate this job had a pretty high opinion of his spiritual walk and God said I don't like that no you're a perfect and upright man the problem is your own view of self that's right and God said I don't like that when you should be giving me the glory job you're taking it and I want you to rely and be completely dependent on me that's it that's it in other words I'll not give my glory to no man amen ouch that's right I tell you we can get pretty pretty high and mighty in our opinions amen you know job did really good early in the war but as it went on and his own friends and then his wife you know brothers let's let's be realistic with each other you can have somebody else's wife make that comment but when your wife makes that comment got a word to say about you too let me remind you and here's job finally comes to this place he's a little weary in the battle and he starts to assert what he has done not realizing without Christ he done nothing every goat out there was a gift from God every sheep out there was a gift from God every camel out there was a gift from God am every child a gift from God and the minute we start saying well I made this business plan and I did this and I invested there and I this and I did that and I outsmarted these guys and I I I right right oh and don't let me forget and I made the Rapture yeah really what a fallacy what God is doing he's proving us that by his grace I overcome amen amen see had a little tarnish in there is just this little spot if I could if I could project it if you guys can see this little spot that's hovering above my finger can you see that spot it's right there above my finger that's how small that spot in job's heart was no man's is ever going to see it did any of you see it no man can see it that's right but God saw it amen and God said I've called you Perfection not a man's idea of perfection no sir but to be perfect in my eyes that's it and God says I see this little thing in you job so no problem job I love you you're perfect but he hasn't told job this yet right job don't know it yeah he doesn't know God's opinion of him is that he's perfect and then God says figuratively here back in the fire we're going to burn that one out of you also now come can we be just friends this morning y wonder how many little spots that we can't even see that's it that's right and God's saying back in the fire that's it another fiery trial why me Lord I'm trying to live for you amen it's not about this flesh no sir and he's back in the fire that's right will run you through the fire again look you sisters I I mean I don't some of you Brothers maybe go to jewelry stores I mean I go to jewelry stores they say caseih John Deere Etc on them but you sisters walk in a jewelry store and you go over here on this end of the counter and it's you know made with iron pyite and still has some iron in it and it has silicon and all these other things in it you can buy that ring for 50 bucks that'd be half the men in America like oh I'll buy a ring for my wife pawn shop wouldn't even take it you know what end of the counter the wife goes to can we guess she's down here this is pure gold the husband's like and the wife's like honey I'd be so proud to wear this now if she has the wrong attitude and it's all about dollar signs amen look sister Gabriella when you get married hold out for the real thing cuz the men tend to be like for what that ring cost I could buy three guns a four-wheeler and a pickup to put it in but see God's not going to settle for iron pyite and this whatever right he says I'm going to take you from that position how does he do that there's gold in there he throws it in the fiery trial pulls it out getting better throws it in a fiery trial getting better throws it in a fiery trial getting better throws it in a fiery trial getting better now I want to ask you you judge yourself where are you at on this right where are you are you satisfied to be right in here no we want the real thing amen hallelujah a little confession to make when Jerry and I got married I bought her a cubic zirconium don't snort like that sister Sue and it offered an excuse I can't afford the ring that she wanted I can't afford that but we were just walking through a place one day and there was Rings there and I'm looking at rings and and and you know that ring they wanted a couple thousand dollar for it you know back in the early ' 80s and and now I'm looking and I'm like oh that ring looks just about what like Jerry really liked way back when it was like 21,000 I was like man that was an expensive back then that was like an investment and you see that's what God's doing he's not trying to fill Heaven full of immature Christians no that's right he says I want only the best that's right and so he keeps putting us in the fire putting us in the fire and about this stage right here I'm sorry to say Saints we start whining like job come on don't lift no hands but I want you to confess in your heart I've whined about what God's allowing to happen in my life I've whined about it what we should be saying is Lord just give me the patience give me the patience if I need to go through the fire again Lord let me go through the fire father I don't want to come to you as an impure person but to come to you as a perfect Son of God if I have to go through the fire again Lord just give me strength to go through the fire again because you see my brother and sister there's only a few words that really matter at that stage of the game no they're not going to be like the words coaches use to motivate people it's going to be those simple words well done my good and faithful servant amen those are going to be the only words that matter amen won't matter how many so to speak trophies we have the square footage of our house how much money is in the bank if we don't hear those words all of this is wasted all of this amen okay I have 30 seconds left you see I'm want to hit this again it just stands out off the page at me we have attitudes this tarnish little attitude now I'm not preaching to you guys I'm preaching to somebody else but we have a little attitude we still have impatience we still have a bit of spiritual pride no problem God's going to come and write you an excuse right God's got his notebook figuratively here I'm not picking on brother Trevor you know I called you before the foundation of the world brother Trevor you didn't quite make it but here just show them that sister Carrie yep just give it to him at the gate you know St Peter sister Sue Titus you imagine the size of the trash can that heaven is sent Peter's like not another one okay no sir we're the bride of Christ we are being tested amen into Perfection and don't think it's a man's Perfection I listened to a man preaching here recently just a little clip message man and he was like God has made us perfect but he was talking from a carnal realm I'm sorry I stand before you if Sister Jerry was here this morning I'm sure she would say amen I make so many my granddaughter's here where are you hiding at oh back row she would lift it she sees her grandfather she knows her grandfather she's traveled with me yeah she's even been bold enough before to say Grandpa are you hangry I am we could tell don't look for some Perfection there let the word take us through the fire again let the word change us don't offer an excuse offer yourself you see I might have mentioned this in church before I don't remember where I've spoken this but you see my brother and sister if we're not careful we're going to use the word to justify ourselves instead of using the word to purify ourselves the word's not here to justify us oh we will be justified yeah but the word's not here to justify us it's here to purify us I can say from my heart this morning Lord let that refining Fire come no I don't want fiery trials I want my my heavenly father to be like grandfather to me but I also know by the word that I can't get in on a grandfather's love I get in on my father's love which is the word and when I get into that position we hear those beautiful words well done musicians would you come heyen you know when I was a little kid my mama used to tell me this all the time Paul your eyes are bigger than your stomach and obviously that transfers down to notes they're greater than the time that we have I believe I've shared this quote with you before God's only provided place of worship we could just look at it real careful think about it Amazing Grace how sweet this sound see just no way of ever explaining what it is just take my word if you believe me be sure to make or burn every bridge of the world behind you and I believe the church is beginning to hear the message look at this date that's right 11:28 of 65 and a prophet makes a statement I just believe they're beginning to see that's right where has our vision went from that time it should have already come into maturity I believe but Paul's still here and maybe I'm the one hindering the Rapture but I would speak with confidence to tell you I was called to that Rapture and so God will keep on running me through the fire amen until I come out as pure gold amen nothing to boast about there right yeah imagine we get to heaven I'm sorry to put a little humor to this brother Phillip imagine we get to heaven what's your number brother Phillip what do you mean brother Paul how many times did he run you through the fire oh oh I remember they gave me a slip of 49,8 62 brother Philip pulls his out and goes I must not have been as hard-headed as you I'm only 41,000 no that's not how God works my brother and sister but you see he's going to run us through the fire and prove us into Perfection amen where he can take that and he can run it through the word that's and say I'll pick on you brother Phillip my servant Phillip have you considered him because he's a perfect and upright man and God says one more time I see something Beyond Perfection are you with me Beyond Perfection I'll just run him through the fire one more time burn today's draw out of him right Hallelujah I say thank you Lord that's how much he loves you and I Prophet says burn every bridge of the World Behind you I believe the church is beginning to hear the message and beginning to understand but friends listen we've got to lay in the presence of the son we've got to be ripened right I'm just going to throw a little little curve ball to you what if all that God desired he needed to do in your life was already done now he's just laying us out in the presence of the Sun and letting us be ripened it I believe all the word can we lift our hand and say amen I believe all the word amen amen I believe the supernatural I believe these things I have the evidence I've seen it and I've had it in my life I believe all of it was then what's more what's more some are over here trying to repeat an experience from past ages some are over here going intellectual and God says no no no if you really understand the message I'm just laying you in the presence of the son amen I'm not speaking ill of it I believe in all of those gifts but my brother and sister we have this whole thing creeping in slow but sure if we're not screaming and running around the church we're not doing all of these things then we don't have it and this is a sign my brother and sister I'm going to throw something out if I'm wrong correct me maybe if the greatest challenge God's placing in our lives right at this moment stand still that's right and know that I am God what if that is a greatest challenge God has for our life today we've said I'm speaking to Believers we've said amen to every word there's not one thing that we have not believed and not held on to and it's and maybe God just wants you to stand in the presence of the Sun and just let the last bit of it be baked out just letting the word come in settle in our hearts and what are we doing now I'm speaking this in general terms please don't we didn't even know we still had that Speck of impatience Lord you need to Rapture us this world is wicked I want out of here Lord Rapture needs to come now we're telling the creator of Heaven and Earth that his timetable is wrong h no problem though let's just take another trip back through the fire amen amen God's not over there saying scratching your name off the list no no one more trip amen amen come out of the fire back in the fire out of the fire back in the fire and we're over here going Lord what's wrong what's wrong what's wrong Lord help us to just stop stand still in your presence Amen Let Your Holy Spirit lead us amen if I need to move Lord give me unction I'll move amen we're not sing here saying I got all the message I can't this and I can't no Lord move me amen you need me to move Lord I want to move amen Lord if you want me to uh repent come on here can I can I just give you one body blow before you leave somebody lift a hand please okay thank you I it's not quite a majority but we're getting close how many times is the holy spirit dealt with us can I use you for an example brother yeah sure you don't know what you're get [Music] to I feel like this brother offended me see that hesitation didn't really want to shake my hand I'm offended then the Holy Spirit deals with me and says you need to go apologize to him amen have we been there yes might be husband and wife might be parents to children and God moves on us and says go tell them you're sorry yes sir amen and you know if we'd do that right now and I would just come there a madeup deal here and you guys know that I would just come and say you know what brother forgive me it's done it's done he has no ought to me I have no ought to him how many times have we just held on to that well it was really his fault it's I I can see that I it's it's not my fault and we just go on and on and on what do we do that just Falls away it fell away but I want to ask you did it go [Music] away if God asked you to repent and you don't repent it falls away but did it go away and we forget about it and God comes and says I want to start I want to burn this out of your life amen I'm done with the Last Words study it in the message if you have not found it you have not read it but you can see the pattern where you could not tell brother brenham's enemies from his friends that's right amen I'm afraid Saints if you put Paul under examination glass you probably could tell what about yourself God's proving us to Perfection let us listen to the Holy Spirit let's be the church that is rising up Amen to take the Rapture amen praise God I love you guys I don't know if that made sense if not I don't know um what I can say say but he goes on intellectually we're hearing the message God has give us we're seeing the signs he showed us proving it by the Bible it's there but oh how the church needs to lay in his presence till it do you think brother Brown used the word tenders up by accident no no I've got the doctrine down perfect it's you that's got the problem that's not tender till it comes down we can come and you might say shoulder toh shoulder take a hand with our brother amen amen in the appropriate way took a hand with our sister and say let me help you through this battle I'll pray with you I'll lift you up in my thoughts and my prayers I want to see you I want to see you strong overcoming instead of I wonder what their problem is yeah you see we've still got a little bit of spiritual Pride right in our lives amen amen will we fight our way back to the fiery furnace or today Saints would we say Lord as many times as I need to go I want to be pure I want your Holy Spirit to move in my life am we can go to church my brother and sister uh um somebody sent um a little deal to my wife she shared it with me I believe that was yesterday if going to church makes you a Christian I'm trying to remember the words of this if going to church makes you a Christian standing in the garage makes you a car I think I got that close you see my brother and sister we're a Christian because we're willing to go through the fire amen and come out as pure gold let's just stand amen God bless you today amen if I mangled it too bad just ask the Lord to help you because we have interpreters translators for everything amen let's just sing that song sister Ruth in everything give him thanks Hallelujah God bless you today amen [Music] in everything oh give him thank everything give him thanks oh in the good time I'm going to praise His name in The Bad Times I'll do the same in everything give the King of Kings all the thanks oh and everything give him thanks oh in everything give him thanks oh in the good times oh praise His name in The Bad Times Doe the same in everything oh give the King of Kings all the things amen just a small comment imagine if when we saw an imperfection in our life maybe a response you see my brother had no reason the hesitation you know where the hesitation was [Music] at I've now created something the brother would say brother Paul I no I didn't do that and now when we recognize this imagine in our daily life we recognize that the devil's coming trying to put a wedge between me and my brother if we'd lift a hand to lift a heart and say Lord I think I need to go back to the [Music] fire just take me back Lord that Refiner's Fire let it Purify Me you know all all the fussing and all the struggles that we have in that realm would all disappear if we were just volunteer amen God didn't have to grab us and drag us Kicking and Screaming if we would come to the place in our own life yeah our own life excuse me I've got to go jump in the fire the world's not going to know what you're talking about Sun Sons and Daughters of God would say I'll just join you I'll just join you and then maybe when one or two in the church would get that way it would be contagious and it'd be three and four then it' be 5 and six and then it would be well we got to leave some kind of drama here maybe it would be this side the church would all jump in the fire and I don't know about that son but what if we were here why don't all of us amen Grace Tabernacle why don't we amen just step into the fire Amen Let the Lord purify us not holding on to the past and not holding on to our opinions and our emotions and what Lord I just ask you today this is not an alter call but I just ask you today could we just kind of lift a hand and volunteer to the Lord and say Lord amen take me back to that Refiner's Fire I want to be perfect in your sight Lord not perfect in my sight but perfect in your sight help me Lord just to be able to stop and let your Holy Spirit Come and move around us and just take the dross away my brother and sister you see we're here today because God called you you're not here of yourself it's the Holy Spirit called you and if God called you before the foundation of the world if we deny that calling we're telling God he's wrong that's right the last thing I want to do on this Earth is tell my God you're wrong this brother this sister they can't be what are they here they're not my brother and sister if you think you can judge who is the bride of Christ let me I want to share can can I take just a second here I'm sorry amen I just want to go back let me find this amen [Music] oh I'm not seeing it here way too many little notes [Music] the only one who knows the heart of man is the one who created amen that heart amen let's not assert God's position let's stop and say Lord if there's something in this brother this sister desire to serve you they might be totally out of kelter that's right life might be totally messed up but unless you are God you don't know that heart let's draw them to Christ amen amen let's be examples not a guard rail right protecting the word we're going to protect the church that only the perfect people feel comfortable here well I tell you the minute we got here it wasn't perfect any longer hallelujah oh Saints forgive me here I'm going with way over I I told myself I was going to be done Break Every Chain amen let's just sing that brother Alex lead
