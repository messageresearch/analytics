hallelujah aren't you glad you can make that your testimony today amen the whole world my brother and sister it's become so common in the world today to people take a stand and then it's completely acceptable to back up from that look at everything about us our governments politicians great men that were applauded and then they lower their standard and the world says yep that's normal but as sons and daughters of god we have a testimony no turning back amen thank you thank you lord let's remember our brother bob sister joanne that just you know his age creeps up on all of us you know it's it's just uh something we have to face so let's just never forget to uh lift them up in prayer amen and uh i think our brother tim sister miriam today or in eastern idaho or something a little holiday or something as far as i know they didn't ask permission so i don't know what they're doing so anyway no i i believe they're on a little holiday together so and uh brother prashant sister concha i believe this is the weekend they're actually meeting together with some other saints that we know down there in that area and i think just a little time they're going to be having church together and i think that's wonderful you see the lord has an ability to put you somewhere and just accidentally right and so there it is that the footsteps of the righteous whatever word you want to use you hear it quoted both ways are ordered or ordained of god and so while we still lift them up today amen may they be able to share uh the light of the gospel in their life with those around them and uh just to uh just become a a you know brother brown talks about this oral roberts would would be able to speak out in the radio and tell the people lay your hand on your radio lay your hand on the television whatever and let that become a point of contact and you know it's interesting that we as humans we we need the truth of it is we need a point of contact we were not meant to just kind of uh float from pillar to post to just kind of aimlessly attach ourselves to this or that but god wanted us to come and by god's grace amen the word being opened to us today it's not our church amen it's not a certain ministry but it's christ himself has become our point and so i say that to say uh i know the saints that they're meeting with have a heart's desire just like us and brother prashant sister kancha of course is a part of this body we'll never let them go no matter where they go but that part of this body you know it just may they all come together to be a point of contact and amen i don't remember did you remember brother manasseh this morning he was just on my heart today seems like most sunday mornings he comes on my heart so it's pretty funny you know sister sophie i was telling you or asking i should say please you know respond to him i walked out of the service last sunday did he share this with you sister and um i have a message on my phone and so you know that happened quite quickly i guess but anyway it was just good i i missed that by just a moment let's stand as we go to the word brother joseph amen precious our sisters god bless you today as you're here with us just a group of believers amen we're all here together i want to bring to you um once again on the subject of obedience uh the two sides of obedience and my thought today the topic would be obedience brings submission see oftentimes we turn that around and think okay we have to submit to be obedient but you see my brother and sister we can actually as i spoke a few words to you the other day we actually can have a rebellious submission but when we come under obedience to the word submission follows and of course i always skip over my notes brother gill sister karen god bless you i enjoyed our fellowship and uh hopefully lord willing we can squeeze a moment from your family here and sit down again and visit amen but you see when when we try to just simply submit we're still struggling against all of the influences around us but when we come into full obedience to the word of god submission now this might sound a little direct and i'm not shooting arrows that no no one don't misunderstand but many people say i believe this message and they don't follow it as i've got older i tend to get a little more oh i don't know impatient i don't sound good does it a little less tolerant of people saying oh praise god god sent a prophet we can all say amen to that can't we i believe this message then they just go and do whatever they want to do i'm sorry i don't believe them any longer now does that mean that they're lost or i've thrown them out absolutely not but you see you have to come in to obedience now this is not we are we are not a denomination we are not here with some kind of conformity as as the token of our our uh uh belief or you know that we are faithful because we conformed you see we can just leave that you know see brother paul preached very much about y'all to this and y'all to that because honestly i believe from all of my heart when we get in the word and the word gets in us it just happens so we don't have to have a whip here and we don't have to beat you and we don't have to shame you and we don't have to do these things because when the word comes alive something happens and thank you lord that it's without us and our uh our ability that god says you know what they said amen to my word now you know sometimes people say well i acknowledge that god sent a prophet and i believe every word he said but they never say amen to the word you have to wonder are they fully submitted because sonic can tell you saints once they left goshen they believed that moses was sent to deliver them by the time they got to the red sea they had determined that moses was there to kill them yeah well praise the lord titus the third chapter let's start with the first verse so once again i want to just speak to you on obedience brings submission titus 3 1-8 now as the apostle paul is speaking sending this letter to titus my brother and sister we can interpret this many different ways but what we have to know and we do know is the very fact that paul's life was completely sold out to the gospel of jesus christ paul did not build a tabernacle put his name on top of it demand everybody you know as it were bower catered to him but many times he come from place to place and was in conflict with the ministry that was there you know how difficult that would be to get up and be the man now if you were narcissistic if you were overbearing egotistical you could easily stand in front of people and say i pull an apostle of jesus christ listen to me he said words some heard it that way but what he was really saying is i'm here simply as a representative of jesus christ and if you'll listen this word will change your life but some saw him as a domineering man but we serve if you'll follow me now we serve a domineering god oh some would be like what yes we are i am the way the truth and the life there will be no other gods before me so god made some demands on us saints amen put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to obey magistrates and to be ready to every good work and to speak evil of no man i say god help us to be no brawlers but gentle showing all meekness unto all men for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish and paul says amen disobedient and paul says amen deceit and paul said amen and serving divers lost in pleasures and paul has to say amen living in malice and envy and hateful and hating one another but you know saints the reason i believe that god a long time ago laid on my heart this word but isn't that incredible i like the word but because while i was once all that paul spoke here to titus but after that the kindness and love of our god of god our savior toward man appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost which he shed on us abundantly through jesus christ our savior my brother and sister not just enough to save you from the wickedness of this world but he poured it out abundantly through our lord jesus christ and abundance means there's more than we could possibly ever consume heavenly father we ask for your guidance today lord we just want to speak words lord today that would be beneficial to your people father bringing us closer to you washing us by the water of the word we ask you father now in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated saints now the apostle paul was writing to titus as an elder and as a brother he was not trying to bring titus under his influence as you might say a servant or whatever but just looking at that and sharing knowing that this now my brother and sister we might preach on patmos just a little bit uh maybe when we get back from arizona but um my brother and sister if we could just grasp what paul experienced when he was on the isle of patmos what paul experienced i mean john uh when when uh he was there on the isle of patmos and so in that it put him in such a place that he was now looking at the word of god an entirely different view than ever now paul was on the back side of the desert i had my my characters turned around here but this will be fine it's the same point when when paul was on the backside of the desert he went through that experience there my brother and sister he never looked at the gospel of jesus christ the same way and so that is why we need a back side of the desert or we need a patmos experience so that we will not look at the word of god just as the status quo but we would have an entirely different view amen the prophet of god told us that when the bible was revealed to us just paraphrasing this that it would become a whole new book when revelation come in our life it would become a whole new book to us and so in that we would then see the bible completely different than we did as just a carnal man with a religious spirit so you would find my brother and sister as as paul is um writing to titus he he's he's laying this out in such a way to encourage titus to teach the people to uh to speak the truth as it were and to break it down now my brother and sister we know that god deals in simplicity it is typically you might say uh uh it is mostly satan's influence to take things in an intellectual fashion but yet you know if you are a highly intelligent person amen uh don't don't feel like that you have some kind of uh uh hurdle to jump over because you see whether we are intellectual or just completely the base or simplest person on earth it still comes down to submission it still comes down to the yielding to the leadership of the holy ghost and so you know some people are like well i have a disadvantage now i have spoke this many times to our brother christian uh and i can say this in in humor and whatnot here today i've spoken to him many times you know christian one of the things i think is as a struggle for you as you're just too smart for your own good so on thanksgiving day i'm sharing that with your boys and all three of them said it's a problem now my brother and sister the word of god is just as effective though when the seed is there to those that mind is in another element as it is to those that are the ignorant and unlearned it all comes down to something within the soul saying i will submit to the word of god amen so you know i never say his name correctly but uh my brother strokoff is how it okay i wrote a book amen my brother wrote a book my brother and sister i don't know if you guys have ever seen that book i made it about halfway through it but really it was like reading about 40 books because i needed you know an oxford dictionary and a webster dictionary and i needed a new whatever they call it dictionary because he used words i never even heard of before so i'm in the dictionary okay that is spelled okay i got the right word book to a different element he wrote that as a judgment to the intellectual that was like this gospel is too simple it's too whatever i mean this is ridiculous so what it is you find that when you look in the dictionary many times uh people use words right that we we don't normally use and you look it up and it's interesting because you see their word has something corresponding in the simplicity but that is where their mind is at paul is preaching speaking to titus he's telling them teach the people encourage the people and we want to put in place guidelines as it were now remember my brother and sister guidelines are not fences guidelines are not a prison guidelines are encouragement that you stay and walk in this path guidelines to a fruitful christian life and as we look at this my brother and sister you think about this put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to obey the magistrates to be ready for it to to every good work to speak evil of no man to be no brawlers but gentle showing all meekness into all men for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish and disobedient deceived serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice and envy hateful hating one another he was giving this guideline to them that they could see if i can step away from what i'm going to call the basic element of humanity the basic behavior of humanity step away from that find deliverance from the basics of humanity of what your natural carnal man would respond to and how that you would react when someone would insult you or speak ill of you and step away from that and in that you will find a fruitful christian life because those things will no longer then have control of your mind in your flesh as we would see this we recognize my brother and sister now to be put in mind subject to principalities and powers lester be any misunderstanding i want to say this we're not speaking of following ungodly rules that serve man's wicked plans prophet of god said when we come to these places in our life it was mentioned here the other day of a situation where a wife was like my husband this and this and this and and he he wants me to to do this and he wants me to cut my hair and she's asking a pastor who has a friend of mine what do i do because he throws the scripture a wife should be subject to her husband totally the devil misinterprets the scripture at will he twists it any way he thinks it works for him and the brother he said you know brother paul this is what i shared with her and he wasn't really saying what do you think of what i shared but you know just as ministers would it's like you know maybe i missed something or did i not elaborate or whatever and i thought brother your answer was spot on that she's not subject to an ungodly spirit she has submitted to the holy ghost and that is the highest place that we as humans can come is submitted to the holy ghost now my brother and sister as it is in the natural a wife the scripture says she has submitted to her husband but that's not to be turned into a doormat or a dishrag that is for a man to be godly that is for man to be the correct leadership and a wife to follow that but you see the devil comes and he tries to twist these things around and so it's there when we're talking about the ungodly rules as it were of mankind this is not telling you to be subject to their ungodly rules remember we should always strive for balance in our life is that not right every time i think of balance i think of brother george and the fact that he reminds me that our pulpit's not balanced and um you know he says we lean just a little bit to the right and i don't know leaning a bit to the right i think that's positive better than leaning to the left but you see my brother and sister how important it is to follow that balance of the holy spirit and i say this is a positive statement that i believe with all of my heart and i'll read a little something to you after a while uh that in my mind gives a license to express things in that fashion now you look at this my brother and sister when the holy ghost when we truly have the holy ghost without any kind of encumbrance do you understand what i mean it automatically brings balance in our life now an encumbrance would be this is what the word says this is what the prophet preached but this is what my church believes you're encumbered you'll never find true balance because you'll constantly be looking to what the church or the preacher says but when we have the holy ghost and we're in the word and become one with the word it will automatically balance us amen now you look at that and realize my brother and sister that even then when something says it's balanced you should double check it right the prophet of god said take everything back to the word so you've say i've got the holy ghost i believe this i'm balanced just double check that by taking it back to the word i had a friend that was a finnish carpenter of the highest talent or degree that i ever knew and he used three levels now stabilize a company that makes nice good quality levels he had a stabila and he had a couple other brands and he started out with the rough one which that was the level that just got everything close and he knew he could trust it but but when he got down because he used to build these arches in these big houses that would be 20 feet tall would take him weeks to finish and he wanted everything it was just him he was driven by this desire for perfection and he wanted to be able to take the rosette on this side and the rosette on that side and they would be exactly to the 64th of an inch the same and that's when i realized that would never be a finished carpenter you see we should always strive for that balance not a close enough balance but that balance that only the holy ghost can bring now my brother and sister it is within the human element the prophet of god talks about you know one might say he's coming on a white horse and some would say he's coming on a cloud and the prophet says these words he says as long as you agree that he's coming so he's not trying to set a doctrine but he's putting an idea in our mind that just because you and i and brother you know david brother chris whatever sees the message in some slightly different fashion see now this is where it gets tricky this slight fashion might be as a pastor i would say brothers every one of you should be wearing a tie to church can i hear an amen see the minister might believe it's important but maybe you don't feel that way does that make you not a christian does it make you going to miss the rapture so there can be little differences of how we see now those that believe in wearing a tiger church would say the prophet of god said where your best what is the best see we can take that out of balance i've got to go here i've got to go there i've i need you know a 25 000 silk suit because i'm supposed to wear the best but you see really what he was saying was don't come to church shabby don't come to church disrespectful don't come to church as though it's no different than a local high school ball game come showing that you as a son or daughter of god so respect to god almighty of i i'm coming in your presence lord see the spirit of the age that we live in preachers are now up there with pants holes in their knees and sneakers and tie-dyed t-shirts and dangles around their wrists on why we're sharing our own opinion sisters i won't judge him but don't let this spirit of 25 bracelets get on you that's the spirit of the world amen no we're not going to have somebody inspect you on the way in we just want you to inspect yourself now you see my brother and sister sometimes disagreeing uh let's just put it this way let's be careful that disagreeing does not become disregarding are you with me this morning you see when we disagree my lovely granddaughter gabriella if she was here today i don't know pull your sleeves up sweetie nope she's not gonna cooperate now i'm just gonna say if she's wearing two or three bracelets and i would say you know what i i don't like that as your adopted grandfather i don't like that but you see my brother and sister because we would disagree i would hope that she wouldn't disregard what i preach by disagreeing it'd be easy to say i'm no longer listening to brother paul so we have to be careful that our disagreeing doesn't become disregarding because when you study this out you will find that disregarding the word is the same as just declaring i don't believe it it is disbelieving the word of god to say you know i know what the bible says but amen so disregarding the word is the same as dis believing the word brother branham says it was iniquity when we would know to do right but we wouldn't do it it's iniquity to us what are we doing we're disregarding we say well i'm a believer but i'm just not going to do that you're actually not a believer because obedience brings submission so if we believe the word of god we will follow the word without a question now let me just say this this morning saints if this touches any one of your lives i am not condemning i'm coming in the same fashion i believe as the apostle paul put them in mind to be subject but not to principalities and powers i'm saying i want to put you in mind to be subject to the word of god in everything and you know how much this weighs upon each one of us there is no exemption cards this is not the game of life the board game of life it is not the board game of monopoly we do not get to go past go we don't get a free pass we either are aligned with the word of god or we have serious issues see when we disregard we're choosing not to be subject to now how long would a person i know brother gill worked for the caterpillar dealer for a long long time how long does a person survive in a job disregarding the company's policies the manager's direction you don't when you show up when you want to leave when you want to failure to follow the protocol they say we can find someone who will and so we see this in the natural life i've picked on brother gill there because most of us have not worked for how many years brother gill 39 years my memory said 40 but i'm close most of us here haven't worked 40 years for this same exact company that's why i chose you brother gail to make that point you do what they ask you to do and you're compensated for it now my brother and sister people looking in the day and age it's like well i've been a christian i've served the lord and it's been difficult and i've just and they act like there's been no compensation for this but god compensates sons and daughters of god my brother and sister in abundance amen he never come god's not stingy god says you know what i will pour out the blessings of heaven upon you but not if you disregard me o israel i am the lord thy god he was telling them look you guys are forgetting you're letting other things infiltrate in and and other things are becoming gods in your midst and and i want to remind you that i am the lord thy god and so god comes to remind that we would remember that it is not just hearing his word but it is also as the prophet of god said acting upon it now you know there's about a half a dozen ways six seven ways that brother brown talks about the evidence of the holy ghost now here again we'll touch on this in just a little bit you'll see kind of the approach i'm bringing on this my opinion is i like it where he says it's hearing and acting on the word of god see because we can hear it and say sure enough that's the truth but we never apply it or never act upon that then we only regarded what he said to a degree in an intellectual fashion to say i believe that's the truth but never implementing it in our life you remember the story brother brown tells about the grandmother she's starving and i don't remember right off top my head here it's been a while since i read that but you know she's she's starving there and you know somebody comes to check on her uh and uh they're asking oh i got a son he's over here in this place and he sends me these lovely letters with these lovely pictures and as the individual is looking at this he is realizing what she's being sent is money orders from another country and literally in her bible there was thousands upon thousands of dollars to take for her care but because she didn't comprehend let me put this as revelation she had no revelation to her it was something a beautiful gift without authority behind it and when she had realization of what really was in her hands her dire situation was over now in this case we might say because she was elder maybe come from a time and a place was not familiar with but you see the moment that's the point i want to make the moment it was revealed to her those were the same as money if she starved one more day it was not her son's fault it was hers the word of god says there come a day that god will no longer wink at our ignorance so there'll be no excuse on that day to say hey i just didn't know because you see he shed upon us abundantly so i i would say in disregarding the word that is choosing not to be subject to the word and we cannot say that we are obedient to the word saints without submitting to the word when we hear that now you know what this might sound simple to you i'm not tooting my horn but this might sound simple to you that my brother and sister if you can hear this in the vein that i studied this in and what god spoke to my heart you will realize that it's not this that we can set to this side it's not that we can set to this side and we can still be believers and everything will be all right my brother and sister just as it is i hope this doesn't offend no one but the word of god says to take communion until he is coming and we disregard it now might be a little direct to some of you but maybe it needs to be a little direct but you see we're not subject to the word when we set certain parts of the word apart now as we would look at this i want to just go into now flashing red light of his coming now there are some very direct things now those of you are already reading ahead naughty naughty naughty but there are some things that brother branham has in this quote here that i i don't want you to take it too extreme in one direction but i want you to be struck by the bluntness of this here some time ago in los angeles i was waiting or was out at the campgrounds i was riding up the road and a little lady a pretty little girl very pretty was going up the road and i thought she must be going to a show she had on a little frontier close just about six or eight inches wide across the front of her very vivid really when you read this pretty vivid and a little three or four inch fringe hanging and up high on her body a little spot just about enough that you could wad up and shut every bit of it up in your fist hanging across her this way with a cowboy hat on and a pair of boots with tassels on them and a very attractive i could see where any young man would slide breaks and everything to stop to her going twisting up the road pretty vivid is it not saints prophet of god didn't spare it he didn't say well like there was this little girl and she wasn't dressed very good he is given a vivid image and it ought to be so it ought to be so that we have a vivid image my brother and sister to realize that when we make an effort to cover ourselves up but reveal ourselves in a certain way oh can i just be bold today hope this doesn't offend anybody we wear long sleeves and ties as men and our wives wear cut out shirts we wear skirts to the floor but we cut them well so i can walk in it find something you can walk in you see those kind of things my brother and sister look at the age we're living in we wear see-through clothes with something under it don't you understand saints the attraction to the carnal man is to see what he can see through the see through i hope you all still love me i'm compelled to tell the truth we get a little further in this quote you'll see why i'm compelled to tell the truth let's judge why look i'll tell you this morning i'm telling the wife i don't need to wear an undershirt under this dress shirt i'll be fine and i'm i'll just say this not to lift us up but i say this my wife holds a shirt up in front of my face with her hand behind it okay i'm wearing an undershirt we need to be mindful of these things saints i'm covered up but i'm visible to the world that's not what the holy ghost is about my brother and sister the blood of jesus christ wanted to cover us so completely that you can't see the world am i getting to be a legalist no i just love you very tactical i see where any young man would slide breaks and everything to stop to her going twisting up the road and i was fixing to turn to the campground and i went upwards to the campground and i started to turn around to go back i thought i'd stop and say young lady i wish to speak to you in the name of our lord jesus christ though you be a pretty girl there is no doubt about that though you have a figure that would anyway probably you you want to hear the breaks whine do you realize do you realize can i say it again do you realize that's the spirit that's making you do that will drive you to a devil's hell where you'll suffer through the ages that is to come do you realize that pretty little formed body look the prophet of god is not mincing any words here saints that pretty little form body and them well set cheeks and hair and red lips and maybe in another six months the worms will be crawling in and out of that well-formed body out there in the dust and that soul that stays in there a day will be and a devil's torment and then something stopped me as if god would say if you do that they'll lock you up down lock you down yonder in jail see there you are i hope i'm you're not taking this too bad this morning amen come on saints i've told you enough times i love you and i'm not lying to you there's no amount of money there's no amount of prestige there's no amount of nothing to cause me to lie to you and if you don't believe it by now i'd never be able to convince you then i seen billy come out in motion it was time to come and i hear them singing only believe oh my how can people be bewitched in such stuff as that is because they disregard come on it's because they disregard the word of god whoa that's right yes sir another thing as ministers behind the platform who is associated in these organizations who read that and know it or forbidden to say anything about it because they'll drive their church congregation away from them then and the churches are looking for members anybody see the but that's coming hallelujah oh hallelujah but god is looking for born again saints of the living god that will shine as the stars oh my brother and sister let me read that again amen the churches are looking for members but god is looking for born again saints of the living god amen what we're not gonna be some bright shining glitzy thing out here dressed to the nines to just fit to the world we're gonna be such that we present ourselves as sons and daughters of god oh god help us be honest and tell the truth what jesus christ said but that's the day we're living in that's the signs that jesus said would be and we see it right before us now look these are pretty strong words today saints it would have been much simpler to preach to you today for me and maybe for you also oh praise the lord we heard the message we're all going in a rapture and we would all said amen and would have went home and nothing nothing would have changed but would that line us up to the word because i'll tell you what this flesh as much as you have the holy ghost this flesh wars against wars against the word of god that's why even jesus and we'll touch on this if we get to it even jesus had to learn obedience by suffering why did he do it forcing himself because he was an unbeliever no my brother and sister he endured that to show you and i that the holy ghost in us can live through anything this world has to offer my oh my now look at this the greatest battle ever fought we'll just skip over a couple of my notes here there's a time where does it go eve could not sin until she laid aside god's word in other words until she decided that she would disregard it so when she come to the place she said you know what i don't believe that applies to me i have a greater revelation i have the holy ghost you don't know what god's doing for me well i know what his word does amen hallelujah you know there's just certain things that you can are very predictable in life amen you can pour two different ingredients together add different ingredients um you know i think probably every uh young man young woman sisters whatever that's ever done a lot of baking knows that you know there's quite a bit of difference between baking powder and baking soda but you know they'll they'll work you know that i know that for a fact i made biscuits one time kind of a few years ago or did i say decades i put the wrong one in there and you know if you put enough butter on a brick you can eat it but you see with the right ingredients you can have something nice and light and fluffy that all of your friends are like that is so good i ate some of those recently eve could not sin until she laid aside god's word opening up her channel of reasons through her soul to begin to reason why certainly my husband has never told me these things now my brother and sister we as a church our husband is not john smith or whatever it is the lord jesus christ and the reason the lord jesus christ going to make sure you see oh we could get into all this but you already know it the first adam second adam first eve second eve my brother and sister the prophet of god goes into detail there how it will come down that while they were found in that condition they'll be a bride that comes that has not been found with another she will be a word virgin bride my husband never told me these things but i believe that you he told me i shouldn't do this but you know you make it so real and so plain i believe it would be wonderful because you're making it so plain to me i remember an individual once telling me that it's like yes sir we are in the millennium my pastor made it so plain to me jesus christ is off the mercy seat it's all finished we have to be in the millennium you'd like him to go back through the message the prophet says where is the mercy seat in the heart of the believer god ever be off the mercy seat saints no sir he will not be off the mercy seat of the believer the unbeliever the make believer the heathen the atheist the agnostic all of these yes there'll come a day he's off the mercy seat for them but for the bride he'll never be from the mercy seat so you see what it is is some preacher made it so plain he's going to be off the mercy seat this is that we must be in the millennium you know what happened i hate to say this bearer of a bad story but my brother and sister their lives got sloppy got so sloppy that all of a sudden adultery started happening in the church because we're already in the millennium this doesn't matter really did god say now when you all get to heaven pardon me for using this expression but when you get to heaven all bets are off just go do what you want now no sir we are of the righteous one he's always been righteous he will always be righteous righteousness will not fall from us just because we have taken a rapture righteousness will not fall from us because we have revelation we are righteous because he is righteous amen hallelujah some of you should act more excited he told me he shouldn't do this you're making it so real i believe it would be wonderful because you're making it so plain to me see there was the first battle and through that battle has caused ev every other war and every bloodshed that's ever come was caused right there at eden she disbelieved god's word and if one iota of god's word was disbelieved caused all this trouble how are we going to get back disbelieving the word you can't do it got to shut off all these other things conscious memories reasonings all these other things casting down reasonings we don't reason about it at all nothing at all we just accept the word on the basis god said so see so we've now went from the intellectual as i was sharing there's nothing wrong going to be many intellectuals make the rapture very smart people but see where god brings us down he's taking it back he's down here where paul's at now god said it i believe it can you defend the message just second there's nothing in here says i defend the message intellectually but i defend the message in simplicity by living it out now how are you going to do that give them a time capsule of your life no sir you see they have to choose themselves to accept it on the basis that god said so but look what brother brown says that sets a stream between you and god and every channel comes open between you and god then there's the battle the very first front line let's not use a 22 rifle let's get an atomic bomb i like this he thinks like i do or i think like he does let's not just sit back and say now i'm going to give the devil a sip of the word every once in a while and maybe that'll be enough to poison him no sir how about we just vaporize him i like this i know brother jason would like this amen thanksgiving evening brother jason i made some snide comment about brother jason do you think there's enough wood on the fire brother jason says nope went and got another big arm load we had a fire as high as this ceiling saints it burnt till two and then there with every word of god behind it it blows every devil every sickness every disease you say is that right brother branham that's why it does it on some and not on others and that isn't that a struggle my brother and sister some people have i've dealt with people that they have a real struggle of why why is a word affecting me like this but it doesn't seem to affect them like that my brother and sister you're not here to worry about them other than praying for their soul but we're here as that old guy at the funeral the other toy told me our wife my wife a godly wife of 65 i think it was years is already in glory and now my job is to make sure this half gets there also amen but we're too busy guarding this family as it were you shouldn't you shouldn't if you did it like this if you've done this if you did this if you did it like me oh my what a wreck y'all want to live like paul i sure hope i didn't hear any amens it's because of the channel you can look out and see it but you've got to have it in here looking this away not out there looking in you've got to be in looking out and so many times saints the devil wants to get us out here looking in and we're trying to yep yep yep but what we got to do is see what god sees and god's on the inside yeah i said that god is in us god is on the inside and it is then we start looking out then we start looking through the eyes of god the devil's on the outside he sees all your failures all your things all your shortcomings all of this and all of that first but god's on the inside what does he see first your soul amen and when we get on the inside we start to look in that way as there's my soul it never was belonging to the devil the title deed has always had the name jesus christ on it and the devil snatched it but he never got it transferred you know there's some states like texas that record the title to property in such a fashion that people come in with a forged bill of sale and they change the title into their name sit down see i've got the title lead to you you're mine but praise the lord states like idaho requiring such a process that it takes more than some simple little piece of paper thrown on a desk to take the property because the state of idaho operates on a title deed you can look it up saints prophet of god preaches on it it's real to me because i look at that and i say hey i understand that it takes an absolute signed and notarized and witnessed and proven to change the title and satan comes and says ah there's the thoughts on their mind god says got nothing to do with it all but they nothing to do with it what about nothing to do with it because i've got the title lead to the soul and the title deed to the soul says they're mine oh hallelujah somebody ought to be able to rejoice today amen amen not out here looking in you got to be in looking out see you can't come through reason you can't come through these other things you've got to come right down god's channel of it right into the soul and how do you do it what's the last channel now i'm gonna leave your homework for you to look that up amen so you can just kind of go through that now i want to just remind you my brother and sister brother branham said here going back into a flashing red light i want to drive this home to you what happened here is the churches either through the people or the ministry disregard the word of god amen i'll ignore this portion now look just a few more minutes satan's desire is to unbalance our life have you ever noticed that effect in your life you can get up some morning drink your coffee read your bible and then when the wheel falls off the wagon what started out as a beautiful day ends up with coffee in your lap and it just ruined my day the rest of my day was just horrible really because the devil come and went boo you see what we've got to do saints has realized that if satan gets us off balance oh i'm guilty of these things i just stand before you and confess i'm guilty of this satan gets us off balance and in that mindset we approach our whole day a moment when we should have come before the throne of god we're walking around a little cloud our spirit is disturbed and satan's like you know what if i i could do this seven days a week this wasn't so hard yeah so they're a christian they believe the lord jesus christ the blood all these things yes but i can just get them off balance see when we recognize i hope this maybe helps you a little bit to understand the depth of what brother george is preaching when he's talking about balance hallelujah we're going along and the devil breaks the plank in half and we're like oh my we're fixing to fall in the crick until you realize god designed you to walk the straight and narrow that you can put one foot right in front of the other and you don't have to fall off just because something went wrong submission to the word will cause you to walk on water come on amen if god did it once then we had to enjoy a song today amen god does it once saints he's going to do it again and again and if you have need you'll walk on water i like how brother donnie reagan puts it he says people are like well okay i've got faith mountain move nothing happens well praise the lord mountain move nothing happens in some cases on the backside of a mountain a little rock rolled down the hill in other cases god says it's not the season it's not season for you to be speaking to mountains to them to move but if you'll still believe that you can speak to the mountain when the day comes when the time in your life that you really need a mountain to move you speak to it and it will move but we want to practice it kind of in a carnal method okay mountain move i see i want to tell you i want to prove to you guys god's real mountain move come on mountain move god you said the mountain would move backside the mountain rocks are just flying off of the mountain but they don't know it because they're coming to the word carnally god still will acknowledge your son or daughter of god but you see when you get right down to god's channel you get right into the soul how do you do it brother branham goes on here talking about what's the last channel goes on talking preaching about faith look it up amen you've got to have faith but you know what faith does faith brings us to the place we don't have to prove god you know how about we'll cut their ear off or we'll cut their arm off and you put it back on and then we'll believe see that's not what it's about saints faith is you and i having an unwavering stability in our belief jesus christ is our lord and savior unwavering hallelujah i hope this doesn't seem too cut up i realized my plate was way too big uh amen now look at this see satan upset i got got some notes here satan upset the balance in eve and uh she was there listening to him and he says you know surely he didn't mean that you would die certainly he didn't mean that he's just kind of putting a scare into you you know like tell us all that if we just live like the world that we're going to go to hell but no i i'm a christian i believe in god you know how shocked you can be when you're trying to talk to someone and they tell you i'm a christian you are i mean i'm sorry you just look stunned you are i had no idea and i'm not saying that mockingly it's just everything about their life nothing testifies of being a christian and they say i'm a christian and i'm like okay okay i believe there's a god well the devil believes that the devil believes there's a god but let's bring the devil up and tell him if you really believe in god then live it i would redeem but lest i would mar my own inheritance in other words i look like this supremely confident man but i'm not sure if i lay my life down i can raise it back up and then my whole plan just fell apart saying sorry are you full of enough faith to lay your life down and are you full of enough faith to have a hundred percent confidence god will raise it back up again are you talking about dying brother paul no i'm talking about dying to self dying to every reasoning dying to every thought every emotion everything that makes up this humanity are we willing to die so completely to ourselves that we would be like so without personality without anything believing that god would raise us back up and as the scripture says make us shine like the stars in heaven now some of you say i'm not interested in that i don't believe you i believe you we all like to be acknowledged just we like to be acknowledged in our way come on are you willing to just lay your life down and say lord however you desire to acknowledge me that's how i want to be acknowledged hallelujah whole another sermon i'm sorry i bled over to the next page see god put a demarcation in the word the before and after right here in these verses saints we looked at this but see but before hey they're they're in that position the after amen satan would like you to see yourself no different he'd like to have you look at yourself and and say yep the me before and the me now is not really any different i hope you don't get offended brothers sisters you actually have the same problem some do i should say brother brown was going up the hill to the campground there's a little girl a little strip of cloth wearing a little dinky dress with fringe on it slinking her way up there wishing a boy would stop you see my brother and sister the devil still throws these kind of things maybe some big muscular young man i'll tell you dave to share opinions to me it's just as wrong for a brother to walk around with his shirt and button as it would be for a sister some people don't agree right but remember we talked about that disagreeing earlier right and you said i heard somebody say amen to it so i think we're on board right but i'm telling you when we start unbuttoning on our shirt and walk around like we are something special you're offering the same as a sister would be and we would flip out if a sister in this church walked around with her shirt i'm down to a button did i say that clear enough okay i just i didn't want to stumble over that one amen so you see my brother and sister what's happening is satan's coming trying to present it in such a fashion that we wouldn't see ourselves any different than then and now but the word so clearly places us in an entirely different position same flesh as it is here the same personality the same smile the same intelligence but a different person a new creature new creation in christ jesus amen but after that the kindness and love of god our savior towards man appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by washing of the regeneration and renewing of the holy spirit now look i want to hurry here i actually actually glad i didn't say i'll be done in five minutes or something amen now look at this not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost now i want to focus this thought right here in this uh in verse five as we look at this and take me back if you would brothers to the scripture verse five amen you look back now at this my brother and sister what it is saying right here that in the renewing of the holy ghost now my brother and sister the renewing according to webster is a re-affirming now we're flash we're human aren't we okay i've got a box here click only on the ones that are a train i need to make sure you're humans what happens i'm sorry out to tell you here's this little boy walking along here he sees that little girl brother brown is talking about something triggers in his mind oh i hope this isn't too blunt for you wow look at her we get so spiritual we don't want to deal with these issues but we got some teenage boy following that girl and he's got sensations roaring through his mind and his body like you can't believe he's like oh my goodness look at her she's so beautiful but doesn't realize it's actually an enticing devil it's dancing in front of him he's not really seeing the girl he's seeing a devil oh i've got quotes to back that up amen that's a devil that's there dancing before him and so we look at that and we say oh my goodness what is happening here and that little boy might be headed the same service brother brandon was that little boy all of a sudden something happens and he's like oh my goodness what am i doing i'm thinking all these oh sorry we're human and i have to preach this to you that's right all kinds of thoughts but something and he's like oh my forgive me lord i was lusting after her now he goes into the service are you with me can i bring this out this way now he's in the service and brother branham's preaching and all he's thinking about lord forgive me i was lusting after that little girl oh lord forgive me i'm not even a believer i'm not even a christian lord forgive me and the holy spirit comes down and this scripture is then fulfilled in his presence because you see saints not by works of righteousness but according to his mercy by the wash washing of regeneration what taking you back to your first estate the holy spirit coming stirring the heart of that young man and saying that's not who i am lord and the renewing did you catch this when you read this earlier the renewing of the holy ghost you know what in the right context what that is referring to a time when there has been a gap there is now a restoration a time when you stepped out from underneath the presence of god come on saints we are i'm not preaching to a bunch of sinners but i'm not preaching to people who haven't grown up in this present world and you come to that place that little gap in there and the devil will just beat you can someone say amen the devil will beat you with what happened in that gap but god come along and said by the renewing oh hallelujah by the renewing of the holy ghost i come down on you and i set you back to your first estate i set you back as though you never done it oh hallelujah how beautiful the word is my brother and sister he comes and he says yes i'm gonna give you a renewing and that young man the next time in his life he's walking a road and that is there he remembers he says oh the devil dropped me here before but he's not gonna trap me today and he remembers in the renewing of the holy spirit but that some same young man might be at work and his boss will say oh my just lie on that inventory count so we don't have to go count everything and find what's missing and he thinks oh my i wanted to go to the youth meeting on friday and if i write that we're missing 10 cases we're going to be in here setting every pallet down counting every single and i won't go to youth meeting checks it off but then the holy ghost won't let it stay that way because there's a renewing coming there's a promise of the renewing and it deals with him and he walks in to his boss it might be a day two days five ten it might be a month and walks in and says i lied on the inventory count because i didn't want to have to count them all the boss says i know how do you know as i took those ten cases and gave them out as freebies to a vendor i knew they weren't there you know who that boy was right here that's why i get to preach some of these things to you i was the boy that walked behind the girl oh that sounds shocking doesn't it you're pastor i was the boy that lied about the inventory and we ain't got enough time to finish out the rest of the examples but you see by the renewing of the holy ghost god comes in and says i'm going to take you from your present place and will put you back in your original estate which i possess the title deed to so i know you're mine you've been marked a price has been paid oh hallelujah saints you ever wonder why the preacher can preach it so real sometimes it might be that he lived it that's right well praise the lord we can have elections just as soon as you would like well praise the lord sister emmy come on it's going to force me to stop and i need to fellowship by redemption now listen i want to tell you something i couldn't finish without reading this one i'm sorry i want to tell you something and listen close to it at this remark i'm going to be just a little bit different this morning i'm going to let myself loose with some of my own theology now you guys won't blink an eye when the prophet says that but if i got up here and said that without you knowing the prophet said that you guys would all get eyebrows to the ceiling and you would be so nervous you'd have one foot anchored in the carpet ready to run but you have to understand the context of what's being spoken i'm going to let myself loose with some of my own theology some of my own thoughts my own conceptions of the scripture that i've never said in this church before or no other church but i feel that it might be profitable this morning man in his own heart has ideas and so forth that he believes and holds sacred in his heart is secrets between him and god and no one else knows about but him and god alone you know that every one of you believers know that just the believer and his maker alone now right there write it down go home read the whole thing so you can make sure you got the whole thing but i want you to understand there are things that god has done in your life that no other believer can relate to that circumstance but god has made it so real to you [Music] i'll tell you saints any of you preachers can say amen if you want to and maybe some of you others feel the same way there's times i've went home and i have felt so alone and felt so disregarded as it were as a pastor as a minister don't feel sorry for me god knows what he's doing and i literally down in my pity party and i say lord if i have even one friend on this earth my phone rang we're talking about that much of a gap of time if i have one friend on this earth [Music] and the phone rings [Music] i only share that with you just to make the point see how that's just between me and the lord now you kind of know about it it's a very very edited version you got knows that's just between me and the lord he knows my struggles he knows my pain he knows your pain he knows your struggle and he's listening and oftentimes he's saying look you're just a little bit out of the word here just get back in the word and it will lose everything it will lose the word in your life it will lose the bonds it will lose these troubles it will loose all of this just just get in line just please take another step get in line last time i went to the airport any of you that have flown you'll know what i'm talking about they have you step in that little booth and you're supposed to put your feet on the floor put your hands up i stepped in there kind of sloppy you know not really thinking about it and the little girls there i always thought that was just they wanted you to stand in one spot because they want to just make you do it and the little girl's like sir can you step forward the machine won't work if you're not stepping in those areas struck me in my heart i thought that's it god didn't say just come to church all sloppy i was in the house of god today i didn't get nothing you know god's got a position he wants you to step into i want you to step into that channel he wants you to step into that place and and you step into that place now if we say i i don't the preacher i don't know i'm not going to do that preacher wants me to lift my hand wants me to worship that's the preacher maybe it's not maybe it's god speaking to you here's a time receive your promise receive the word act on it hallelujah just a believer in his maker all alone you see ultimately each one's got to come to the word right and the word's got to become more absolute now i'm going to put this out here some people might not like it but i'm going to say it there's something moving through the land it's very subtle believers of the message are saying the message is the absolute when the messenger that spoke the message said the bible is the absolute then they'll tell you if you call them on it well it's the same isn't it no no the bible is the bible [Music] the word of the ages is god's bible expressed but don't let the devil turn one into the other come on [Music] i read this quote to you here just recently let's move forward and quit now notice again how jesus overcome the world system of religion when he's repeatedly badgered by the theologians of his day he constantly applied the word [Music] constantly applied the word he spake only what the father gave him to speak there was not a time when the word was not utterly confused by the word time when the world was not utterly confused by his wisdom for it was the wisdom of god in his own personal life contending with himself come on we forget that he was tried with every temptation he'd been tried with every situation oh you're gonna think that this is heresy there was my lord jesus walking up the road towards the campground [Music] and that same little girl [Music] with the same spirit one little girl was right there come on [Music] the word says he was tried in every fashion [Music] time when the world was not utterly confused by his wisdom for his wisdom of god his own personal life contending with himself he overcame by obedience to the word of god in hebrews 5 7 to who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him what was he obedient to the word of god amen hallelujah hallelujah i'm sorry for some gaps in there but i've already kept you long enough amen let's just stand sing a song there's a fountain open in the house of david i thank the lord for that amen that fountain has never closed it's never gone away and my brother and sister here we are oh i didn't even bring you the other side of obedience today i didn't bring you the other side of what it is when a man or a woman would simply say that's not what he meant we touched down that last sunday that's not what he meant what are they doing they're really not trying this might be confusing for you they're really not trying to change the word of god they're actually trying to open up a spot in the word that they can slip an exemption for themselves in there because if that's what he meant i've got to change but i like me i like my life i like my understanding of the word for the hour i like all of this so what i need to do is open this up that's not really what he meant and then we'll insert our explanation [Music] and they wouldn't judge it as though it was adding and taking away from the word of god because it's just concerning them but i'm sorry it applies [Music] help brother jay [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] before the eyes a new heart will i give you [Music] and place my spirit a renewing of the holy ghost and take you from your sins [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and there are streams of grace that's flowing down from calvary the house of my trolls in one spirit of grace [Music] and in that day what a day a fountain shall be opened up [Music] is [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] thank you lord [Music] [Applause] hallelujah aren't you glad today such an awesome god come they spend a certain amount of time this doesn't i hope doesn't apply to believers they spend a certain amount of time it is i think average of three point something hours a day on a television they spend x amount of time with their friends they spend a much smaller bit of time with their family interacting research says they spend less than two hours a week in church [Music] i want you today amen thank you lord are we good for another song or two hallelujah how great are you lord how great are you lord we serve an awesome god saints how great is your mercy how great are the things that you have done for me [Music] how great are you lord your loving kindness it's filling my heart as i sing how great are you lord hallelujah how great is your love it reaches to the heavens [Music] how great and is me how great are you lord how great is your mercy how great are the things that you have done for me how great are you lord your loving kindness filling my heart as i sing how great are you lord how great is your love foreign it reaches to the heavens it's not by works of righteousness but by his grace alone it's not by works of righteousness but by his grace alone it's not by works of righteousness but by his grace alone and we complete in heaven it's completely complete complete in heaven we are completely [Music] for there's nothing more that i can do for jesus paid it all there's nothing more that i can do for jesus paid it all there's nothing more that i can do for jesus pain at all and we are complete and [Music] we are completed is [Music] oh the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelling in my lord the fullness
