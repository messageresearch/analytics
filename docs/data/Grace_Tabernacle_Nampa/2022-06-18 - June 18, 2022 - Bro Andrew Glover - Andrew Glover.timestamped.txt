[31:50] [Applause]
[31:55] by the water of the world
[32:02] just have to share this mini sermon
[32:05] when i
[32:07] hear these words i think about because
[32:09] i've been studying the book of esther
[32:12] and i think about when esther's time was
[32:14] to come before the king
[32:17] she went and bathed or washed herself in
[32:20] the water
[32:21] and only took what the king
[32:25] had provided for her
[32:28] she didn't call out for any other ideas
[32:30] any other fashion she didn't have
[32:32] somebody thumbing through a magazine she
[32:35] just simply took
[32:36] and when you think about the water of
[32:38] the word amen that is our royal garment
[32:42] when we wrap ourself in the word of god
[32:45] and and nothing can nothing can get to
[32:48] us then the prophet of god said we get
[32:50] under that blood and we stay there i'm
[32:54] paraphrasing this and the only way the
[32:56] devil can get to you is to come under
[32:59] the blood and i always get excited about
[33:01] this quote and he says if he come under
[33:04] the blood then you could call him
[33:05] brother
[33:06] amen that's how powerful the blood of
[33:08] jesus christ is i say thank you lord
[33:11] we're being washed and being clothed in
[33:13] that glorious garment well saints i just
[33:16] want to say this evening

[40:38] of jesus praying there in john 17 to
[40:40] read the whole thing but just to pull
[40:42] some thoughts here tonight from john 17
[40:45] verse 15 the bible says i pray not that
[40:48] thou should estate them out of the world
[40:50] but that thou should escape them from
[40:52] the evil
[40:54] they are not of the world
[40:56] even as i am not of the world
[40:58] sanctify them through thy truth for thy
[41:01] word is truth
[41:03] as thou has sent me into the world even
[41:06] so have i also sent them into the world
[41:09] now watch this
[41:10] and for their sakes i sanctify myself
[41:13] that they also might be sanctified
[41:16] through the truth
[41:17] neither pray i for these alone but for
[41:20] them also which shall believe on me
[41:22] through their word
[41:24] that they all may be one as thou father
[41:26] art in me
[41:28] and i in thee that they also may be one
[41:30] in us
[41:31] for that the world may believe that thou
[41:34] has sent me
[41:35] now i find it amazing that jesus is not
[41:38] asking god to remove him from the world
[41:41] to manifest who he is but he's right
[41:43] here in the middle of the world
[41:45] manifesting who he is in the 22nd verse
[41:48] he says and the glory which they gave us
[41:51] me i have given them that they may be
[41:53] one even as we are one
[41:56] i in them and thou in me that they may
[41:59] be made perfect in one and that the
[42:02] world may know somebody say the world
[42:04] may know
[42:05] that the world may know that thou has
[42:07] sent me
[42:08] and has to love them as thou hast love
[42:11] me
[42:12] one other place i want to look with you
[42:13] tonight is the book of colossians the
[42:15] first chapter
[42:16] the book of colossians the first chapter
[42:18] you that
[42:19] study the message you know that this is
[42:21] brother braham's text in christ
[42:23] is the mystery of god revealed
[42:26] in colossians the first chapter
[42:29] another a very very powerful reading if
[42:31] you get time to read the whole chapter
[42:33] but in the 25th verse i want to pick up
[42:35] here
[42:36] paul here writing he says where of i
[42:39] have made a minister
[42:40] according to the dispensation of god
[42:43] which is given to me for you
[42:46] to fulfill the word of god now how many
[42:48] knows that brother brahma said the mind
[42:50] of christ is to fulfill the word
[42:52] so if you have the mind of christ then
[42:54] the desire is to fulfill the word
[42:57] even the mystery which hath been hid
[42:59] from ages and from generations
[43:02] but now
[43:03] is made manifest to his saints to whom
[43:05] god would make known what is the riches
[43:08] of the glory of this mystery among the
[43:10] gentiles here it is which is christ in
[43:14] you
[43:15] the hope of glory
[43:16] christ in you
[43:18] the hope of glory then let me ask you
[43:20] who was it in john 17 it was christ who
[43:24] is it in the bride tonight it is christ
[43:27] in you we ask lord this evening to add
[43:28] the blessing to the reading of his word
[43:30] as you can be seated here this evening
[43:32] uh from those passages of scripture
[43:35] for just a few moments here if i can i
[43:37] want to speak to you on a thought
[43:38] tonight if i title this i want to speak
[43:40] to you on living images of true
[43:42] christianity uh living images of true
[43:45] christianity i i am a firm believer that
[43:48] god has sent us it's been the most
[43:50] powerful message that has ever hit the
[43:52] face of the earth and we know that
[43:53] tonight and we believe that and we
[43:55] treasure this message and i find that
[43:57] according to malachi 4 it meant that god
[44:00] promised that he would send a message of
[44:02] restoration in this generation all that
[44:05] had been lost would be restored now
[44:07] abraham says in the end time evangelism
[44:09] he says the end time evangelist message
[44:12] is from malachi 4 it's a restoring he
[44:15] says the message and the messenger both
[44:17] will have to be a restoration of the
[44:20] faith in the book of jew just about 30
[44:22] years after the crucifixion he said
[44:24] brethren
[44:25] i give all diligence to write unto you
[44:27] of the common salvation that you should
[44:29] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[44:32] once delivered to the saints back there
[44:34] see malachi said the last days the last
[44:36] prophet of the old testament before the
[44:38] great and terrible day of the lord shall
[44:40] come i will send to you elijah the
[44:42] prophet and he will restore the faith of
[44:45] the children back or the faith of the
[44:47] children back to the fathers just before
[44:49] the destruction of time what is it he
[44:52] said it's a message that goes forth and
[44:54] a messenger of the last days that's not
[44:56] to bring them to a creed amen but to
[44:59] jerk them out of those creeds and bring
[45:01] them back to the original faith of the
[45:04] fathers he said the pentecostal fathers
[45:06] were the churches to be in the last days
[45:09] not the mosaic fathers but the
[45:11] pentecostal fathers now and then you
[45:13] realize that brother branham teaches
[45:14] that john was actually malachi 3 he said
[45:17] and what john done when he restored the
[45:19] children back to the mosaic fathers he
[45:22] said but what the message of malachi 4
[45:24] will do is he will restore the faith
[45:26] back to the pentecostal fathers again he
[45:28] says the end time message is to get the
[45:30] bride ready and prepared for the rapture
[45:33] what can it do according to malachi 4 is
[45:36] to bring them back to the faith that was
[45:38] once delivered to the saints see bring
[45:41] them back to the faith of the fathers
[45:43] the pentecostal part amen in the
[45:45] restoration time he says i will restore
[45:48] saith the lord that's the real event the
[45:50] end time evangelism so the end time
[45:53] evangelism is not to take away from the
[45:55] church amen but it is to give back what
[45:57] the devil has taken from the church now
[45:59] amen it's amazing to think that the
[46:01] pentecostal part of god amen was that
[46:04] men was not led by men amen but they was
[46:07] led by the spirit of almighty god
[46:10] you agree with that men was not led by
[46:12] men but they were led by the spirit of
[46:14] god therefore as the bride of jesus
[46:16] christ we have been restored amen to
[46:19] spiritual leadership the bible says it
[46:21] like this he that hath an ear let him
[46:23] hear what the spirit is saith unto the
[46:25] churches how tragic it is that in the
[46:28] first stage they did not listen to the
[46:30] spirit amen but instead it listened to
[46:32] man amen but thank god in the last days
[46:35] there will be a group rise up amen the
[46:38] true bride of the last day and she will
[46:41] listen to the spirit amen in the last
[46:43] day there will be a bride who will raise
[46:45] up and she will listen to the spirit he
[46:48] said in the day of gross darkness the
[46:51] light will return by the pure word and
[46:54] we will return to the power of pentecost
[46:56] amen to welcome back the lord jesus
[46:59] christ amen i'll set you like this we
[47:01] are not a bunch of fanatics amen we are
[47:04] a group of people that have been
[47:05] prophesied amen in the bible in the
[47:08] message in the word we have been
[47:10] prophesied to be here in the age that
[47:12] we're living in then to think that if we
[47:14] are going to be the bride of jesus
[47:15] christ who is going to follow the
[47:17] leadership of god he meant then there
[47:19] had become a voice of leadership he
[47:22] meant out of all the voices that was in
[47:24] the world and the fact that revelation
[47:26] 10 7 would say in the days of the voice
[47:29] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[47:32] to sound amen the mystery of god should
[47:35] be finished as he had declared to his
[47:37] servants the prophets he meant then the
[47:39] voice that we're following is not the
[47:41] voice of a man amen it is the voice of
[47:44] the son of man that has returned to this
[47:47] generation to lead the bride he's been
[47:49] from the confusions of laodicea amen
[47:52] from the religious ideas of the world
[47:54] into a place of power with god amen the
[47:57] bible says that the days of the voice of
[47:59] the seventh angel amen i need some more
[48:01] up here if that's possible amen my voice
[48:03] is weak but we're going to preach anyhow
[48:05] amen in the days of the voice of the
[48:07] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[48:09] sound amen the mystery of god should be
[48:11] finished as he declared to his servants
[48:13] the prophets now how many knows that
[48:15] this prophet is not going to be a
[48:16] prophet by man's desire but he's going
[48:19] to be a prophet by god's desire that's
[48:21] why the prophet said he is sending a
[48:23] vindicated prophet he is sending a
[48:25] prophet after almost 2 000 years he is
[48:28] sending someone i want you to catch the
[48:30] way i'm saying this it's not me sending
[48:32] myself amen but it's god sending someone
[48:35] he's sending a vindicated prophet he's
[48:38] sending a prophet after almost 2 000
[48:40] years he's sending someone who is so far
[48:42] from organization and education and the
[48:45] world of religion amen that is john the
[48:48] baptist and alliance of old he will hear
[48:51] only from god
[48:54] he will hear only from god and he will
[48:56] have saith the lord and he will speak
[48:59] for god he will be god's mouthpiece amen
[49:02] and he as it is declared in malachi 4 6
[49:05] amen will turn the hearts of the
[49:07] children back to the fathers he will
[49:09] bring back the elect to the last day and
[49:12] they will hear a vindicated prophet give
[49:14] the exact truth as it was with paul he
[49:17] will restore the truth that they had he
[49:20] meant then the truth that had been lost
[49:23] would be restored to the church under
[49:25] the voice of revelation 10 7. he meant
[49:28] under the voice of malachi 4 under the
[49:31] voice of luke 17 30. he meant the truth
[49:34] of god would return to the church amen
[49:36] and those elect with him in that day
[49:39] amen will be the ones who truly manifest
[49:42] the lord amen and be his body and be his
[49:45] voice and will perform his works now
[49:47] amen i have to say it the way i believe
[49:49] it i believe the message of the hour
[49:51] amen has restored the truth of water
[49:53] baptism it has restored the truth of the
[49:56] godhead it has restored the truth of
[49:58] what happened in the garden of eden it
[50:00] has restored the truth of what happened
[50:02] amen in the are what going to happen in
[50:04] the future under all the symbols in the
[50:06] book of revelation amen the message of
[50:08] the hour is a perfect message it's not a
[50:10] man's message it's not a doctor's
[50:12] message amen it is the king's message
[50:15] and that message is bringing a faith in
[50:18] the church of the living god that is
[50:20] anointing you and meant to be more than
[50:22] church members to be more than just
[50:24] citizens they meant to be more than just
[50:26] husbands and fathers and preachers and
[50:28] deacons but this message amen is
[50:30] anointing you to be the bride of jesus
[50:32] christ amen and i'll say it to you like
[50:34] this amen either this message is the
[50:37] truth or it's not amen but i believe it
[50:39] is and if it is the truth amen that
[50:41] there's a power that will come in the
[50:43] church that will anoint her to be the
[50:45] body of the lord jesus christ mine amen
[50:48] to think he will restore amend the true
[50:50] christianity amen he will restore amen
[50:54] true christianity if he can restore amen
[50:56] the truth of the godhead the truth of
[50:59] water baptism the truth of merit and
[51:01] divorce the truth of seven seals amen
[51:04] that i believe he can restore have been
[51:06] the truth of what christianity is i'll
[51:09] tell you this much if you know what
[51:11] something is then you know what it's not
[51:14] are you with me if you know what
[51:16] something is then you know what it's not
[51:19] like if you're wondering what is the
[51:20] mark of the beast amen if you know what
[51:22] it's not then you know what it is and
[51:25] it's not the nra and it's not a covet 19
[51:28] shot and it's not a chip in your
[51:30] computer amen it is a revelation from a
[51:33] devil's system amen called the called
[51:35] the denominations that will stamp you in
[51:37] the forehead now come on friends if you
[51:40] know that amen then that tells you when
[51:42] all these other people say well it's a
[51:44] covet vaccine and it's a chip it's a
[51:47] credit card you say that's not what it
[51:49] is because my eyes have been enlightened
[51:52] by a message of restoration amen that
[51:54] i'll sit like this when people say
[51:56] christians are just people that conform
[51:58] to a certain creed i say that's not what
[52:01] a christian is when they say christians
[52:03] is people that just goes to church i say
[52:05] that's not what a christian is amen
[52:07] because i'm following a message that has
[52:10] restored the redemptive identity of
[52:13] almighty god to the church and if i know
[52:15] what a real christian is then i know
[52:17] what a real christian is not and a real
[52:19] christian is not a church member that
[52:21] sits on the pew for 40 years and never
[52:24] goes anywhere with god a christian is
[52:26] not somebody that fusses and fights and
[52:28] argues and debates and looks for faults
[52:31] and failures amen a christian is to be
[52:33] the manifestation of god on the earth
[52:36] amen i'm sorry but i'm losing up here if
[52:38] you can who is probing and guessing and
[52:40] hoping and presuming when we are
[52:42] following a message that has been
[52:44] vindicated by the purifier that's why
[52:47] the prophet said is your life worthy of
[52:48] the gospel he said lord jesus any man
[52:51] physically or woman or child amen can
[52:53] move back the pages of the bible but
[52:56] there's no one that can reveal it but
[52:58] you he said lord then i pray taken this
[53:00] this text as it is placed upon my heart
[53:03] to send that across the nations for the
[53:05] people that they might know what type of
[53:08] life is required for them to live he
[53:10] said so many has asked me is the
[53:13] christian life a life of church service
[53:16] is it helping the poor and the needy is
[53:18] it a constant member is it a loyal
[53:20] loyalty to the church and such questions
[53:23] he said may the correct answer come
[53:25] tonight
[53:28] i'll just be honest with you brother
[53:29] david when i hear a prophet of god say
[53:31] may the correct answer come denied i'm
[53:34] now in position to receive the truth of
[53:36] the subject that is at hand he said
[53:39] another place we have assembled here
[53:40] tonight for no other purpose but to know
[53:42] how and to learn how by thy help to be
[53:46] better christians and better fit
[53:48] subjects for this hour that we are
[53:50] approaching do you realize the hour that
[53:52] we're living in the world is hungry to
[53:54] see something real amen the prophet of
[53:56] god said they're not waiting to see how
[53:58] big of a denomination we can make how
[54:00] well of a crowd we can get dressed how
[54:02] big a church we can build they're
[54:04] waiting to see us manifest they've been
[54:07] the life of the lord jesus christ in
[54:09] love and power they're not waiting to
[54:12] see how deep we can get they're not
[54:14] waiting to see how educated we can get
[54:16] they're not waiting to see how smart
[54:17] religiously we can become amen they're
[54:20] waiting to see somebody have been stand
[54:23] and dispound where the glory of god can
[54:25] fall upon a human life in this age and
[54:27] the same thing that was done when jesus
[54:30] was here will be done in his bribe
[54:32] listen friends i believe amen if the
[54:34] church of the living god is going to
[54:36] advance then we must have a restoration
[54:39] of truth and a restoration of truth is
[54:41] essential amen for the church to advance
[54:44] the church can never progress until it
[54:47] knows what grounds it's progressing on
[54:50] the church can never go further until it
[54:53] knows what grounds it's progressing on
[54:56] he said i believe before anybody can
[54:58] ever move or have real confidential
[55:00] faith it's first they have to know where
[55:03] they stand and how to stand after they
[55:06] make their stand you've got to know
[55:08] where you stand you've got to know how
[55:10] to stand and you've got to know how to
[55:12] keep the stand once you make the stand
[55:14] he said i believe that's essential for
[55:16] you cannot just head long plunge into
[55:18] something amen with faith when you don't
[55:21] know where you're plunging you've got to
[55:22] know and if our faith is set right and
[55:25] in the right position it gives a
[55:28] constant satisfaction oh my i can't stop
[55:30] here because i'll preach all night but
[55:32] if your faith is set right and you're in
[55:34] the right position then it will give you
[55:36] a constant satisfaction amen as a
[55:39] christian tonight amen we're all going
[55:41] through troubles we're all going through
[55:43] trials we're all going through
[55:44] persecution amen but as a christian
[55:47] there is a difference between you and a
[55:49] difference between the world and the
[55:51] difference is that no matter what you
[55:53] find yourself going through amen you
[55:55] still are satisfied amen you can be in a
[55:58] hospital room and you're still satisfied
[56:01] you'll be laying in the death bed at the
[56:04] grips of satan and you're still
[56:06] satisfied you can be facing the greatest
[56:08] trial of your life and you're still
[56:10] satisfied let me ask you where is that
[56:12] satisfaction coming from it's not coming
[56:15] from a church
[56:16] it's not coming from a denomination it's
[56:18] coming from the life that is on the
[56:20] inside of you they've been by the
[56:22] baptism of the holy ghost
[56:24] my i feel like preaching here tonight
[56:26] amen we're not a bunch of church members
[56:27] we're christians we're not a bunch of
[56:29] wannabes we're christians we're not a
[56:31] bunch of hitchhikers amen we're
[56:33] christians here tonight who has been
[56:35] born by the water and the blood and the
[56:37] spirit of almighty god my than to fake
[56:40] christians amen must have real
[56:42] confidential faith
[56:44] if you're going to be a christian a real
[56:46] christian must have real confidential
[56:49] faith amen i want you to catch up and
[56:51] hear that the most solemn confession
[56:53] that you can make is that you are a
[56:55] christian do you realize that the most
[56:58] solemn confession you can make is that
[57:01] you are a christian it's not that you're
[57:03] a preacher it's not that you're a deacon
[57:05] not that you're a pastor not that you're
[57:07] a missionary the most solemn confession
[57:10] a human can make is that they are a
[57:12] christian and then i'll say to you like
[57:14] this amen as
[57:16] christians we are created in the image
[57:18] of almighty god amen how many knows the
[57:21] image of god amen is an image of god
[57:23] that is a divine image it is not a human
[57:26] image it is a divine image in genesis 5
[57:29] 1 the bible says this is the book of the
[57:32] generations of adam that in the day that
[57:35] god created somebody say god created in
[57:38] the day god created man amen in the
[57:41] likeness of god made he man amen now
[57:43] watch this it was not man creating god
[57:46] it was god creating man but when a
[57:49] prophet come on the scene the way the
[57:51] churches was approaching it they was
[57:54] approaching it as god he meant as some
[57:56] second person of the trinity amen and
[57:58] man was leading god everywhere but a
[58:01] prophet come on the scene and said no
[58:03] that's not the way it is amen man did
[58:06] not create god and man did not evolute
[58:08] from a monkey amen man was created in
[58:11] the divine image of god in the likeness
[58:14] of god made he him now i want you to
[58:16] look at this word likeness it's a
[58:17] powerful word it means likeness or image
[58:20] amen it is the image of the son of god
[58:23] into which true christians are
[58:25] transformed
[58:27] think about that all the way back in
[58:29] genesis the fifth chapter as a true
[58:32] christian you've got an identity
[58:35] that's a powerful fault now if you go
[58:37] all the way back to genesis 5 verse 1 if
[58:40] you are a true christian you had
[58:42] representation all the way back there
[58:45] when moses was speaking what he was
[58:47] receiving from the pillar of fire amen
[58:49] the image of the son of god into which
[58:51] true christians are transformed amen it
[58:54] is the likeness not only of the heavenly
[58:56] body but also the most holy body and
[58:58] blessed state of mind which christ
[59:00] possesses it is the image of one in whom
[59:03] the likeness of anyone has seen it is
[59:06] applied to man on account of this power
[59:08] of command it is to christ on account of
[59:11] his divine nature and absolute moral
[59:14] excellence now i want you to catch
[59:16] something whatever was in christ amen
[59:18] was here in genesis 5 1. whatever was
[59:21] going to come out and be manifested in a
[59:24] man called jesus was not the nature of
[59:26] mary or the nature of joseph it was the
[59:29] nature of the almighty god that would be
[59:32] displayed upon the earth oh god then as
[59:35] christians we are to manifest amen the
[59:37] lord jesus christ in all ways of our
[59:40] lives
[59:42] i pray this is okay hey then that word
[59:44] christian or christians you know what
[59:46] it's used it's used three times in the
[59:48] bible amen the word christian or
[59:51] christians is used three times in the
[59:52] bible in acts 11 chapter and the 26th
[59:55] verse the bible said when he was
[59:56] speaking about
[59:58] barnabas there when he when when he had
[1:00:01] found him he brought him unto antioch
[1:00:03] and it came to pass that a whole year
[1:00:05] they assembled themselves with the
[1:00:07] church and they taught much people and
[1:00:09] the disciples were called christians
[1:00:12] amen first in antioch they met before
[1:00:14] they were called disciples they were
[1:00:17] called christians
[1:00:19] are you hearing me before they were
[1:00:21] called disciples they were called
[1:00:23] christians acts the 26th chapter the
[1:00:25] 28th verse the bible said that agrippa
[1:00:27] said unto paul almost now persuades me
[1:00:30] amen to be a christian amen in first
[1:00:32] peter 4 16 if any man suffer as a
[1:00:36] christian then let him not be ashamed
[1:00:39] amen for let him glorify god on this
[1:00:42] behalf the protagonist said a christian
[1:00:44] is not a tool or some kind of mechanical
[1:00:46] wrench to a great big religious regime
[1:00:49] amen a christian is not some some kind
[1:00:51] of a tool that keeps a religious
[1:00:53] organization moving that is not a
[1:00:55] christian
[1:00:56] a christian is to be christ-like a
[1:00:59] christian cannot be a christian until
[1:01:01] christ comes in the man and the life of
[1:01:04] christ in him then it produces the life
[1:01:07] that christ lived and you do the things
[1:01:09] that christ did amen if the life of
[1:01:12] christ is not in you then i hate to bust
[1:01:14] your bubble amen but you're not a
[1:01:16] christian the works of christ is not in
[1:01:19] you i hate to bust your bubble you're
[1:01:21] not a christian you say preacher i lay
[1:01:23] hands on the sick and i can preach the
[1:01:25] gospel and i can sing the glory down
[1:01:28] that is not the sign of the christian
[1:01:30] the sign of a christian is the same life
[1:01:32] that was in a man called jesus has
[1:01:35] returned to the church in the form of
[1:01:37] the holy ghost
[1:01:38] my to think tonight remember said that
[1:01:40] produces the life of christ and you do
[1:01:43] the things that christ did he said what
[1:01:45] am i talking about personal relationship
[1:01:48] to christ
[1:01:50] what am i talking about i'm talking
[1:01:52] about personal relationship to christ
[1:01:55] i'm not talking about pastor
[1:01:57] congregation relationship to christ i'm
[1:01:59] not talking about evangelist
[1:02:01] congregation relationship to christ i'm
[1:02:04] talking about a personal relationship to
[1:02:06] christ you say then preacher how can a
[1:02:08] personal relationship become between me
[1:02:11] and christ amen the new birth is the
[1:02:13] only thing that will produce a true
[1:02:16] personal relationship between you and
[1:02:19] the lord jesus christ you say preacher
[1:02:21] what is a christian amen a christian is
[1:02:23] this it is a follower of christ it means
[1:02:26] to be christ-like or like christ
[1:02:30] [Music]
[1:02:32] a christian means to be a follower of
[1:02:33] christ
[1:02:36] it means to be christ-like
[1:02:38] it means to be like christ you see we
[1:02:40] have so many explanations today and
[1:02:43] definitions of what a christian is do
[1:02:45] you realize that when brother branham
[1:02:46] was here that there was about 900
[1:02:48] different denominations around 900 do
[1:02:51] you realize today out of one religion
[1:02:54] called christianity there's about 3 000
[1:02:57] different branches and sex amen of
[1:02:59] different religions called christianity
[1:03:02] then what that tells me is 3 000
[1:03:04] different or 3 000 plus amen different
[1:03:07] people are trying to identify what you
[1:03:09] are amen would you not go crazy amen if
[1:03:12] you had 3 000 different ideas about who
[1:03:15] you are as one person well the baptist
[1:03:18] said you're this and the amish said
[1:03:19] you're this and the catholic said this
[1:03:22] and the pentecostal said this and the
[1:03:24] methodist said this and the christian
[1:03:26] scientist amen all these different
[1:03:28] groups trying to identify one person
[1:03:30] amen but god sent a message in this hour
[1:03:33] that would go beyond the ideas of
[1:03:35] denomination it would go beyond the
[1:03:37] confusion explanation that men was given
[1:03:39] the church and would bring them back to
[1:03:41] an absolute and he would reveal to you
[1:03:44] amen what the real bible definition of a
[1:03:46] christian is
[1:03:49] a real bible definition of what a
[1:03:52] christian is the program said like this
[1:03:54] many times people say oh what is a
[1:03:57] christian he said some people limited to
[1:03:59] joining a church
[1:04:01] can i read this to you someone said well
[1:04:03] a christian is a church member someone
[1:04:05] who takes up their affiliations with the
[1:04:07] church i believe that all christians
[1:04:09] should do that but i don't believe
[1:04:11] that's christianity
[1:04:12] that's what a christian does after he
[1:04:14] becomes a christian
[1:04:16] now come on for you people that don't
[1:04:17] want to go to church let's preach a
[1:04:19] minute amen that's not a sign of a
[1:04:21] christian
[1:04:23] come on now amen amen it's not just
[1:04:25] showing up on easter sunday and coming
[1:04:27] back on christmas amen and if you're
[1:04:29] lucky you might show up on mother's day
[1:04:31] that's not what a christian is amen a
[1:04:34] christian is a christian regardless of
[1:04:36] what season it is regardless of what
[1:04:38] condition their family's in regardless
[1:04:41] of how cold the church is how full the
[1:04:43] church is how empty the church come on
[1:04:45] friends this message has come amen to
[1:04:48] produce real christians he said see then
[1:04:50] some say it's going to church and
[1:04:52] serving a declaration of creeds and
[1:04:54] being loyal to the things in which the
[1:04:56] church teaches and then things are all
[1:04:58] right he said others say perhaps packing
[1:05:00] a little cross or something that is the
[1:05:02] sign of a christian then there's others
[1:05:04] who believe that if they burn a candle
[1:05:06] or do some kind of a penance that's a
[1:05:08] christian if they will merely be
[1:05:10] immersed in water or they will do some
[1:05:12] sacrifice or give some good to the
[1:05:14] church or help the neighbor or buy some
[1:05:16] coal for the widow or some shoot for the
[1:05:18] orphan he said that's the ax a christian
[1:05:21] should do but that steel doesn't make
[1:05:24] them a christian come on friends amen
[1:05:26] you can bother call for the widow you
[1:05:28] can buy shoes for the orphan you can
[1:05:30] split wood for the fatherless amen that
[1:05:33] steal doesn't make you a christian he
[1:05:35] said then some says if you pack an image
[1:05:37] of christ in your car or on your wall
[1:05:39] that is a sign of a christian them
[1:05:41] things are all right amen but i don't
[1:05:43] believe that packing an image makes you
[1:05:45] a christian come on friends he said i
[1:05:47] believe that being an image is what
[1:05:50] makes you a christian it's not the
[1:05:52] pictures on your wall it's not the cross
[1:05:54] on your mirror it's not the stamp oh god
[1:05:57] hallelujah it's not the it's not the
[1:06:00] button that you're wearing on your coat
[1:06:02] amen what makes you a christian amen is
[1:06:04] when you as a human being become an
[1:06:07] image of jesus christ
[1:06:09] my the problem god said see it's not
[1:06:12] what we do outwardly it's what happened
[1:06:14] inwardly i could he told me to take my
[1:06:17] liberty so can i preach for a minute
[1:06:19] it's not what happened in outwardly it's
[1:06:22] what happened inwardly you say well
[1:06:24] preacher i'm a christian amen and i've
[1:06:26] got something on the inside if you got
[1:06:28] something on the inside it'll manifest
[1:06:30] on the outside but you cannot
[1:06:32] manufacture something on the and outside
[1:06:35] and expect to manifest it on the inside
[1:06:38] this is not a manufacturing of the life
[1:06:40] of jesus christ this is the
[1:06:42] manifestation by the quickening power of
[1:06:45] the holy ghost coming in the human heart
[1:06:48] oh god i tell you this if you get
[1:06:50] something inside you won't have to tell
[1:06:52] nobody it'll work its way to the outside
[1:06:55] now he told me to take my liberty so can
[1:06:57] i preach a second amen i happen to
[1:06:59] believe that a christian lady don't have
[1:07:01] makeup on her face
[1:07:03] i happen to believe that a christian
[1:07:05] woman ain't walking around and heals so
[1:07:07] high that it looks like she needs a
[1:07:08] ladder to get in him and a parachute to
[1:07:10] get out of
[1:07:12] come on i don't believe boys are running
[1:07:15] around in skinny jeans that are real
[1:07:16] christians come on now let's preach a
[1:07:19] minute if we're going to be christians
[1:07:21] let's be christians if we're going to be
[1:07:23] church members and lodge members and
[1:07:25] social members let's find the social
[1:07:27] gospel but this message is not a social
[1:07:30] gospel it is not a religion it is the
[1:07:33] power of god under salvation it is
[1:07:36] transforming grace with almighty god
[1:07:38] that has come down in this generation to
[1:07:40] change us from the inside out
[1:07:44] come on now you say well preacher we
[1:07:46] move beyond we move beyond preaching
[1:07:47] makeup i can tell that's why half our
[1:07:49] girls have got it on these days
[1:07:52] come on well preacher we move beyond
[1:07:54] preaching on televisions i can tell
[1:07:56] that's why most of homes have gotten
[1:07:58] again
[1:08:00] well i guess it's the evans that's
[1:08:01] coming out well preacher we've moved
[1:08:03] beyond preaching boys wearing shorts i
[1:08:05] can tell that's why we got boys that are
[1:08:07] 18 years old still running around in a
[1:08:09] pair of swords
[1:08:10] well preacher we move beyond preaching
[1:08:12] on hebrews 10 25 i can tell that's why
[1:08:15] people don't show up unless it's a
[1:08:17] special meeting or a special convention
[1:08:19] but let me say this either we're
[1:08:21] christians or we're not and if we're
[1:08:22] going to be christians let's not be
[1:08:24] christians by lip service let's be
[1:08:27] christians by a quicker than seed on the
[1:08:29] inside of our hearts
[1:08:32] it's not what we do outwardly it's what
[1:08:35] happened emily that makes us what we are
[1:08:37] then therefore he is our image and we
[1:08:41] are in his likeness and we are members
[1:08:43] of his party we should be images like
[1:08:46] him then our lives somebody say our
[1:08:48] lives
[1:08:49] our lives should reflect the image of
[1:08:52] christ
[1:08:54] mercy
[1:08:55] our lives should reflect the image of
[1:08:58] christ not in our joining church not in
[1:09:01] our pack of the crucifix or on our
[1:09:03] emotions but it should be in the living
[1:09:06] presence of the living god that's
[1:09:08] reflected through our life see then i
[1:09:11] like the song it's jesus on the inside
[1:09:14] working on the outside oh what a change
[1:09:18] is in my life the father god said church
[1:09:20] membership is all right i have nothing
[1:09:22] against it or any of those things but
[1:09:24] brother to be a christian means to be
[1:09:26] conformed to the image of christ we want
[1:09:30] to be living images not pack an image
[1:09:33] but be an image of the lord jesus in
[1:09:35] christianity versus idolatry he said we
[1:09:38] are made partakers of his holiness there
[1:09:40] is a redeemed bride upon the face of the
[1:09:43] earth tonight who will not bend she will
[1:09:45] not bow she will not back up he will not
[1:09:48] retreat she will stand as a living image
[1:09:51] of jesus christ
[1:09:54] will somebody give him some praise you
[1:09:57] might as well
[1:09:59] you might as well bless his name you
[1:10:01] might as well worship him you are the
[1:10:03] redeemed of the lord
[1:10:06] come on you're not buried in dead
[1:10:08] traditions you've been quickened from
[1:10:09] the dead
[1:10:12] you've been made alive in christ jesus
[1:10:14] you say made alive oh yeah the problem
[1:10:16] of god said as christ was the first one
[1:10:19] to rage from all the prophets and so
[1:10:22] forth although tied to many places he
[1:10:24] was the first fruit of those that slept
[1:10:28] are you ready for this in the bride
[1:10:31] coming of christ
[1:10:33] i love to read that quote brother paul i
[1:10:35] think i was about 15 16 years old i just
[1:10:38] started preaching on the field and i
[1:10:39] read that quote one night and a guy met
[1:10:41] me in the back of the church he said you
[1:10:43] ain't got no right to read that i said
[1:10:45] pray tell me why i don't he said because
[1:10:47] that's for a future day he said you're
[1:10:49] just confusing them people i said let me
[1:10:51] tell you something that's not for a
[1:10:52] future day that's for this day
[1:10:56] and you know why i'm still reading that
[1:10:58] quote it's because i heard brother
[1:11:00] branham before i heard that man and
[1:11:02] brother branham said this is the bride
[1:11:05] coming of christ
[1:11:07] this is the bride coming of christ it is
[1:11:10] christ amen being manifest in a body
[1:11:13] it's the waving of the chief again
[1:11:16] oh hallelujah what is the sheave amen
[1:11:20] the first one to come to maturity the
[1:11:22] first one that proved it was a wheat
[1:11:24] brother if there was one that come to
[1:11:26] maturity the reason they was waving it
[1:11:29] is because there was a whole field that
[1:11:31] was coming to maturity too and let me
[1:11:34] put that devil on notice jesus christ
[1:11:36] was not the only one to come to maturity
[1:11:39] william branham was not the only one to
[1:11:41] come to maturity but they were way
[1:11:43] before this generation as a prophetic
[1:11:46] announcement there is a field full come
[1:11:49] on ruth stay in the field there's power
[1:11:52] in the field there's bread in the field
[1:11:54] there's streets in the field
[1:11:59] there's a rapture in the field there's a
[1:12:01] body change in the field everything you
[1:12:03] have need of is in the field of the son
[1:12:06] of man
[1:12:11] come on it's in the book of ruth
[1:12:14] it's in the book of ruth don't go to no
[1:12:17] other field
[1:12:19] stay in the field of boaz ruth you want
[1:12:22] to be redeemed stay in the field of boaz
[1:12:25] you want strength stay at the feet of
[1:12:27] boaz
[1:12:30] it's the word
[1:12:32] and for the first time
[1:12:33] i love how brother says things brother
[1:12:35] paul for the first time there will come
[1:12:38] forth for the bride age
[1:12:41] it's the broad coming of christ in a
[1:12:43] bright age for a resurrection out of
[1:12:46] dark denominationalism will be a message
[1:12:50] about not a personality amen not a group
[1:12:53] of educated men that say with brother
[1:12:55] man on the mountain somewhere and
[1:12:57] receive some backwards chimney corner
[1:12:59] story amen but there will be a message
[1:13:01] that the full maturity of the word will
[1:13:04] be turned back again in its full power
[1:13:07] and will be waved again over the people
[1:13:12] and the signs and the wonders that he
[1:13:15] did back there will return to the human
[1:13:18] flesh again by the message of the hour
[1:13:22] come on now you thought john 14 was the
[1:13:24] funeral text till the prophet come on
[1:13:26] the scene and said no it's about a
[1:13:28] theophany
[1:13:30] it's things that are to be and he said
[1:13:33] these words he said because i live ye
[1:13:36] live also we didn't know that we had a
[1:13:40] spot in scripture we thought that was to
[1:13:42] the world but a prophet come along and
[1:13:45] said he was speaking to his wife
[1:13:50] glory to god he was speaking to his wife
[1:13:53] because i live he shall live also the
[1:13:57] word which he was has been way back on
[1:13:59] the day of pentecost the word made
[1:14:02] manifest now i say it is to be waived
[1:14:06] again

[1:14:11] didn't accidentally become a christian

[1:14:42] your own desire you become a christian
[1:14:45] by god's desire and god died
[1:14:48] hallelujah god desired you from before
[1:14:52] the foundation of the world to represent
[1:14:54] him in this age so he chose you and

[1:19:14] difference between you and a pentecostal
[1:19:17] emotional meaning is there rejoicing
[1:19:19] trying to see it but you're rejoicing
[1:19:22] because you see it
[1:19:26] you're rejoicing because the word has
[1:19:29] become flesh in grace tabernacle

[1:19:35] word has found the body
[1:19:39] come on come on we're not we're not a
[1:19:41] bunch of babies we're not a bunch of
[1:19:43] immature christians we can stay under
[1:19:46] the anointing we can stay in the
[1:19:48] presence of god until all the greenness
[1:19:50] is baked out
[1:19:53] come on now
[1:19:54] i'm gonna turn the corner if that's okay
[1:19:57] outside of this message you'll never be
[1:19:59] a real christian
[1:20:03] come on you say can you back that up the
[1:20:05] problem of god said if your life always
[1:20:08] was an attribute of god if your life was
[1:20:11] not always an attribute of god he said
[1:20:14] then you'll be nothing but a mimic
[1:20:18] of christianity
[1:20:22] how i feel i put my choices on here
[1:20:23] tonight if the attribute of god was not
[1:20:26] always in you then you'll just be a
[1:20:29] mimic of christianity
[1:20:32] are you ready for this he said there'll
[1:20:34] be millions and billions of them they'll
[1:20:37] just be mimics of christianity
[1:20:40] there'll be millions
[1:20:42] and there'll be billions of just mimics
[1:20:44] of christianity you know what the bible
[1:20:46] says in jeremiah 17 10 it says i the
[1:20:49] lord search the heart i try the reigns
[1:20:52] even to give every man according to his
[1:20:55] ways and according to the fruit of his
[1:20:57] doings mark 7 7 says how be it in vain
[1:21:01] do they worship me
[1:21:02] teaching for doctrine the commandments
[1:21:05] of men the prophet of god picks this up
[1:21:07] in the church age book he says now why
[1:21:09] does god call these churches his
[1:21:11] churches even though they are the false
[1:21:14] vine the truth of the matter is they are
[1:21:16] christians
[1:21:20] they are christians
[1:21:21] but they are not christians of the
[1:21:23] spirit
[1:21:24] come on now they are christians of the
[1:21:27] flesh
[1:21:31] they're christians
[1:21:33] but they're not christian to the spirit
[1:21:35] they're christians of the flesh he said
[1:21:37] they are bearing the name in vain
[1:21:40] fulfilling mark 7 7
[1:21:42] but indeed they are christians for what
[1:21:45] else could they be
[1:21:47] a is a this is his
[1:21:50] religion no matter how he lives it
[1:21:53] because he subscribes in theory to what
[1:21:56] the quran teaches it's the same way a
[1:21:58] christian is a christian as long as he
[1:22:01] subscribes to the fact that jesus is the
[1:22:04] son of god the born of a virgin
[1:22:07] crucified died rose again that he is the
[1:22:10] savior of mankind in fact listen now in
[1:22:13] fact can i have a few more minutes here
[1:22:16] in fact they in this laodicean age there
[1:22:19] will be those who call themselves
[1:22:21] christians because they subscribe
[1:22:24] to the fine qualities of jesus while
[1:22:27] reserving to themselves the right to
[1:22:30] deny his deity
[1:22:34] they're christians because they
[1:22:36] subscribe to the fact that jesus is the
[1:22:38] son of god he was born of a virgin come
[1:22:41] on amen since they'll put a nativity
[1:22:43] scene out at christmas and denies mark
[1:22:46] 16.
[1:22:48] come on amen on easter they'll go put up
[1:22:50] a crucifix and do a rep of calvary and
[1:22:54] say oh we're christians in reality
[1:22:57] they're denied his deity
[1:23:01] how can i break it down
[1:23:03] you say we're denying this deity oh yeah
[1:23:05] let a drunk come to the altar well
[1:23:07] brother god bless you we got an
[1:23:09] alcoholics anonymous program and that
[1:23:11] out at me and i'll sure help you i'll
[1:23:13] tell you right now let a young person
[1:23:15] let a young person come to them and say
[1:23:17] i got a promise with pornography and
[1:23:20] they'll say now listen bro i'll tell you
[1:23:21] right now what we'll do is we'll take
[1:23:23] you to a psychologist and he'll sit
[1:23:25] there and talk to you and we'll cancel
[1:23:27] with you a little bit i'll tell you what
[1:23:29] a devil of pornography don't need to be
[1:23:31] counseled it needs to be cast out
[1:23:37] he told me to take my liberty so i might
[1:23:39] as well preach
[1:23:40] i'm this close to it i might as well cut
[1:23:42] its head off we don't need psychology in
[1:23:45] the house of god
[1:23:49] people say well preacher oh god well
[1:23:52] they said it publicly so i guess can i i
[1:23:54] can bump it publicly
[1:23:56] well the greatest psychologist ever
[1:23:58] lived was the holy ghost i resent that
[1:24:00] spirit that is a devil
[1:24:03] the holy ghost was not a psychologist
[1:24:06] the holy ghost was god himself
[1:24:10] come on church
[1:24:14] well that spirit's on the run we might
[1:24:17] as well run him back to hillary come
[1:24:18] from
[1:24:20] we really we're really going to resort
[1:24:21] back to psychologist and psychiatrist
[1:24:24] when the prophet come on the scene in a
[1:24:26] discernment line and a woman was begging
[1:24:28] for healing and brother paul she said
[1:24:30] these words she said brother branham
[1:24:32] i've confessed to god and i still can't
[1:24:35] get healed and under a supernatural sign
[1:24:38] he looks at her and says the problem is
[1:24:41] you committed adultery against your
[1:24:43] husband
[1:24:47] come on now he said you committed
[1:24:49] adultery against jesus he said here's
[1:24:51] the problem he said you confessed it to
[1:24:53] god but you confessed it to your husband
[1:24:55] he said and you'll never get healed
[1:24:57] until you confess it to your husband you
[1:25:00] didn't sin against god you stand against
[1:25:02] your husband she said oh brother branham
[1:25:04] if i would confess that to my husband he
[1:25:07] wouldn't he would leave me he said don't
[1:25:08] worry sis amen he done the same thing
[1:25:14] come on now he said he and the same
[1:25:17] thing i believe it was he was away to
[1:25:18] the military he said now you go confess
[1:25:21] he said he went to her and she went to
[1:25:24] he confessed that he confessed it to her
[1:25:26] he said you know what happened they both
[1:25:28] made it right she got healed he said and
[1:25:31] they're still serving god today
[1:25:35] brother david i love these next few
[1:25:37] words he said it brought clean living
[1:25:40] back
[1:25:42] but i really love these next words he
[1:25:44] said now listen that devil had hid from
[1:25:47] the psychiatrist for years
[1:25:50] that spirit had hid from the
[1:25:53] psychiatrist from years you know why
[1:25:55] because the psychiatrist is mental
[1:25:57] telepathy the psychiatrist is mind
[1:26:00] reading the psychiatrist is guessing in
[1:26:03] probability but the holy ghost is a
[1:26:06] discerner of the faults and intents of a
[1:26:09] heart
[1:26:10] come on church the holy ghost is a
[1:26:13] deserter of the thoughts
[1:26:16] of the intention listen the devil that
[1:26:18] he had from the psychiatrist couldn't
[1:26:21] hide from the holy ghost
[1:26:29] the devil that he had from the
[1:26:31] psychiatrist
[1:26:33] couldn't hide from the holy ghost you
[1:26:35] say what are you talking about remember
[1:26:36] it like this he said that false
[1:26:38] christian is a nominal christian and
[1:26:41] belongs to the church but he is not a
[1:26:44] true
[1:26:45] or spiritual believer
[1:26:51] he said that kind of believer is one who
[1:26:54] has been baptized into the body of
[1:26:56] christ and is a member of him but
[1:26:59] nonetheless it's god's order that the
[1:27:01] tares grow up with the wheat and they
[1:27:03] are not to be uprooted that is the
[1:27:05] command of god their day for binding and
[1:27:08] burning is coming but not yet so the
[1:27:10] spirit is speaking to the mixed group on
[1:27:14] the hand he is praising and on the other
[1:27:16] hand he is rebuking
[1:27:21] now think about this he is told what is
[1:27:24] right with a true believer what is a
[1:27:26] false christian it is a christian by the
[1:27:29] flesh
[1:27:30] what is a true christian
[1:27:32] is a christian by the spirit
[1:27:35] come on i'm not gonna preach all night
[1:27:36] but can i finish this it's a christian
[1:27:39] by the spirit it's the spirit that
[1:27:41] zechariah spoke of in the fourth chapter
[1:27:44] he said see speaking of zerubrable he
[1:27:47] answered and speaking to me saying this
[1:27:49] is the word of the lord undeservable
[1:27:52] saying not by might
[1:27:55] not by power
[1:27:57] but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts
[1:28:00] he says who art thou
[1:28:01] he asked a question who art thou o great
[1:28:05] mountain are you hearing me for six ages
[1:28:08] this mountain has withstood them because
[1:28:11] there was no strength to bring it down
[1:28:13] but zerubbabel who is a type of the
[1:28:16] seventh angel says who art thou
[1:28:19] are
[1:28:20] o great mountain before cerebral thou
[1:28:23] shalt become a plane and he shall bring
[1:28:26] forth the headstone thereof
[1:28:30] there you are
[1:28:33] with winkings
[1:28:42] is i bring forth a headstone
[1:28:45] with noddings
[1:28:47] in between snores
[1:28:53] my bible says
[1:28:54] he shall bring forth the headstone
[1:28:57] thereof
[1:28:58] with shoutings
[1:29:01] you know what they're going to be
[1:29:02] shouting
[1:29:04] they're going to be crying
[1:29:05] grace
[1:29:07] grace
[1:29:08] grace grace
[1:29:11] hallelujah they're going to be screaming
[1:29:14] they're going to be shouting they're
[1:29:15] going to be crying grace grace unto it
[1:29:18] he said moreover the word the lord said
[1:29:20] unto me the hands of zerubbabel has laid
[1:29:23] the foundation this house in his hand
[1:29:25] shall also finish it and thou shall know
[1:29:28] the lord of hosts has sent me unto you
[1:29:33] what is this message
[1:29:35] it's not the message of legalism
[1:29:39] thank you lord this is coming fresh and
[1:29:41] a perfect place to preach it grace
[1:29:42] tabernacle amen
[1:29:44] it's not the message of legalism it's
[1:29:47] the message of grace
[1:29:50] come on church it's not the message of
[1:29:52] legalism it's the message of grace the
[1:29:56] prophet of god said jesus amen was the
[1:29:58] chief cornerstone and he's also the
[1:30:00] headstone if we will think for a minute
[1:30:03] the seventh church age messenger was to
[1:30:05] restore the faith of the children back
[1:30:08] to the fathers in other words that's a
[1:30:11] beautiful study in other words rebuild
[1:30:14] the church again
[1:30:16] under the power of the spirit
[1:30:20] not by power not by might but by my
[1:30:23] spirit saith the lord not by
[1:30:25] organization not by the nomination but
[1:30:28] by the holy spirit god will bring forth
[1:30:31] the church in the last days
[1:30:37] oh help me jesus and there will be a
[1:30:40] true bride who will rise up
[1:30:43] in the last days
[1:30:45] there will be a true bride who will
[1:30:47] follow not what a man says shall follow
[1:30:50] what the spirit says and she will rise
[1:30:52] up in the power of the holy ghost and
[1:30:55] she will return to the power of
[1:30:57] pentecost to welcome back her
[1:31:00] lord are you ready for this they're
[1:31:03] going to be some shouting in the bride
[1:31:05] there's going to be some crying in the
[1:31:07] bride and it's not going to be because
[1:31:09] the guitar hit the right key and it's
[1:31:11] not going to be because the favorite
[1:31:12] song had been tickled your emotions and
[1:31:15] caused you to relate to emotion there's
[1:31:17] going to be shouting and there's going
[1:31:19] to be crying and it's going to be grace
[1:31:22] grace

[1:31:30] i shouldn't be saved by grace i should
[1:31:33] have been dead but grace my family
[1:31:36] shouldn't be in the house of god but
[1:31:38] grace

[1:31:46] heart he said how he's let me go all
[1:31:48] over the world around the world to

[1:31:53] millions coming to the lord and accept

[1:32:37] the spirit of god he saves people by the
[1:32:40] spirit of god he heals people it's the
[1:32:42] spirit of god that gives the message to

[1:45:19] david he said these words he said in the
[1:45:21] way that you call heresy

[1:45:30] have limited the way of heresy to
[1:45:32] emotional worship
[1:45:33] we've said all that heresy is is
[1:45:35] somebody that'll express himself and he
[1:45:37] moves away but do you realize why paul
[1:45:39] was being called an emotional or be
[1:45:40] called was being called a heretic is
[1:45:43] because he was believing all that was
[1:45:45] spoken and written by the prophets
[1:45:49] the way of heresy is more than just
[1:45:52] running the aisles and screaming and
[1:45:54] shouting the way of heresy is to stand
[1:45:57] upon the most solemn confession and say
[1:46:00] i am a christian i believe everything
[1:46:03] that the prophet said
[1:46:07] let our musicians come

[1:48:17] to fit in
[1:48:20] he was called
[1:48:21] to stand out
[1:48:24] he was born for a purpose
[1:48:28] brother paul
[1:48:29] you're an oddball among pastors
[1:48:32] [Music]
[1:48:33] why you say that
[1:48:35] because you was not born to conform to
[1:48:36] what everybody else says
[1:48:39] he was born to preach the pure word
[1:48:43] to the sheep that god has given you
[1:48:51] if they scandalize your name what
[1:48:53] difference does it make
[1:48:56] i recognize it

[1:49:04] in here tonight
[1:49:07] the greatest the greatest victory you'll
[1:49:09] ever get
[1:49:10] [Music]
[1:49:12] is when you quit worrying about what
[1:49:13] people think about you
[1:49:16] and you just be
[1:49:18] who god called you to be
[1:49:20] [Music]
[1:49:24] if god called you to see this revelation
[1:49:26] quit apologizing for it
[1:49:30] if they walk off let them go they did it
[1:49:32] to jesus
[1:49:32] [Music]
[1:49:34] come on
[1:49:35] but there's some people here
[1:49:38] who can't walk off
[1:49:41] they've been impressed
[1:49:43] they've been sealed by this revelation
[1:49:47] they've been sealed by this revelation
[1:49:50] of the son of man
[1:49:52] now brother graham says it this way he
[1:49:53] said you know there were millions in sin
[1:49:55] when i got saved
[1:49:57] but he had a purpose in saving me
[1:50:00] i'm an oddball
[1:50:01] amongst the brethren
[1:50:03] many times because i believe in
[1:50:05] predestination
[1:50:07] the seed of the serpent baptism in the
[1:50:09] name of jesus christ all these other
[1:50:12] things that seem to be and the visions
[1:50:14] and the power of christ return back
[1:50:16] and condemning organizations and things
[1:50:18] i'm an oddball i i'm the oddball
[1:50:22] but he had a reason to save me
[1:50:25] a purpose
[1:50:27] for doing it
[1:50:29] let us stand our feet tonight
[1:50:36] i am
[1:50:36] proud to be an oddball
[1:50:39] [Music]
[1:50:42] if it makes me a fanatic to say the
[1:50:44] seventh hills open then i'm a fanatic
[1:50:47] [Music]
[1:50:49] if it makes me a fanatic to say this is
[1:50:51] the right age then i'm a fanatic
[1:50:55] if it makes me a fanatic to say this
[1:50:57] message is rapturing faith and i'm the
[1:50:58] fa
[1:51:01] if it makes me a fanatic to say it's
[1:51:03] going to take more than stories to make
[1:51:04] a rapture then i'm a fanatic
[1:51:07] not ashamed of it i'm not hiding from it
[1:51:10] it's who i am
[1:51:11] beat me stalk me kick me out persecute
[1:51:13] me but when you all get down i'll still
[1:51:15] be a fanatic

[1:51:19] there's nothing you can do to me in time
[1:51:22] that could change what god put in me in
[1:51:24] eternity
[1:51:24] [Music]
[1:51:27] and god put a seed in me
[1:51:29] from before the foundation of the world
[1:51:31] that when this pressure would come

[1:52:18] the persecution makes the believer
[1:52:19] stronger
[1:52:20] [Applause]

[1:52:23] file on your hands before you put this
[1:52:25] persecution on me you just wait till

[1:55:14] and without raising one finger
[1:55:17] without lifting her voice she walked
[1:55:19] over and began to pick up the broken

[1:55:27] cross for you there's a cross come on

[1:55:40] didn't know that her testimony was on
[1:55:42] the line when he threw them eggs before
