[32:22] refuge and everything that is ours
[32:25] that's promised to us has been purchased
[32:27] for us at Calvary and we have the token
[32:30] of that and Assurance of that that it's
[32:32] our property and Lord we are so thankful
[32:36] for your goodness and bringing us
[32:37] together once again tonight and Lord
[32:40] You've laid a message on My Heart Lord
[32:42] and you know that I've I've I've battled
[32:45] through today with this but Lord
[32:47] believing it's your will to bring it and
[32:49] I pray that you would bless your word
[32:52] and open my mouth and speak things that
[32:55] David dehart knows nothing about
[32:58] but that you would bring forth the word
[33:01] by your quickening power of your spirit
[33:04] that it would Quicken and speak to every
[33:06] individual heart as you see fit to do so
[33:09] and For Your Glory we're not here in
[33:11] vain we've come here Lord by the
[33:13] leadership of your spirit we are here as
[33:16] you've appointed us and thank you for
[33:18] the faith to come we thank you for this
[33:21] now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen I'd
[33:25] like you to turn with me to the song of
[33:29] Solomon I want to title this brother
[33:32] Alex if you can get this it's very
[33:34] simple little
[33:37] foxes I want to title this little
[33:40] foxes and I I I I I can subtitle it
[33:44] maybe like
[33:46] this uh consider our ways consider our
[33:51] ways let's consider our ways or consider
[33:55] your way amen this is what we want to do
[33:58] and feeling like the Lord laid this on
[34:00] my heart for this tonight and I I really
[34:04] was heading towards the part two of what
[34:06] we took a Sunday before uh concerning my
[34:11] Revelation and it's not mine obviously I
[34:13] mean individually it's it's the
[34:16] brides but I just felt that I just
[34:19] didn't feel directed that way and and
[34:22] some things come to my heart that were
[34:24] very very much look like that way but
[34:26] the Lord seemed to let lay this in my
[34:28] heart for about 2 months I've had the
[34:29] little message here on my heart and so
[34:32] we just felt like it was the right time
[34:34] maybe the end of the year that we should
[34:37] consider our ways because we don't know
[34:39] what's going out here in the future and
[34:42] we I believe it's going to the battle is
[34:44] going to get hotter and heavier but we
[34:46] remember the victory is
[34:47] greater and so we just we just re
[34:51] believe that some things may happen that
[34:53] you don't understand why and don't have
[34:55] any reason for it but we have
[34:58] an
[34:59] absolute and that's the word of God so
[35:02] let's let's consider our ways through
[35:04] the word of the Lord Jesus and take heed
[35:08] to what's been spoken and by a
[35:10] Vindicated Prophet at our day and and
[35:13] and follow it because it's been proven
[35:17] right and it'll bring if you feed upon
[35:19] it it's going to bring this word to life
[35:21] to you it's going to it's going to bring
[35:24] Quicken it I mean not the message I'm
[35:26] talking about not William ROM but the
[35:29] spirit of that message will bring this
[35:32] word to life because he brought it the
[35:34] Lord brought it amen so in Song of
[35:38] Solomon in in Chapter 2 and reading
[35:42] verse
[35:42] 15 take us the
[35:45] foxes the little foxes that spoil the
[35:48] Vines for our Vines have tender grapes
[35:52] how many know this is what those grapes
[35:55] are the little tender grapes are the
[35:56] fruit for the Seas season and so we've
[35:59] got to realize that we have fruit for
[36:01] the season and we've got to stay very
[36:04] Vigilant over the
[36:06] enemy's power and deception amen so you
[36:10] may be
[36:11] seated I have some other scriptures here
[36:13] will
[36:14] read we should consider our ways are we
[36:17] pleasing the Lord by obeying his word
[36:21] you know there's only one way to please
[36:22] him that's through faith and Faith God's
[36:25] faith takes this resting place in the
[36:28] unmovable un
[36:32] unending not
[36:34] defeatable and Eternal Word of God Amen
[36:38] it's going to stand right there and it
[36:41] won't leave that
[36:42] word faith in God will not leave the
[36:45] word so he wants us to believe it and
[36:47] take it and not put our opinion to it
[36:50] not add what we think to it and reason
[36:53] with it don't add to or take away from
[36:55] it amen but Satan will do everything he
[36:58] can if he can to spoil that vine you're
[37:03] the branch on the vine you're the branch
[37:05] if he can get to the vine he'll spoil
[37:07] the
[37:09] branch is that right if he can get if
[37:12] the fox can get to the
[37:15] vine amen the vine what is the vine to
[37:18] you your
[37:19] life yes your Source of Life the vine to
[37:23] you is the quickening spirit you can do
[37:26] nothing without being in that Vine right
[37:28] the vine is the
[37:30] word the vine is the manifested fullness
[37:33] of the root and and you and you can't be
[37:36] complete without the branch and you
[37:38] can't bring the tender grapes without
[37:39] the
[37:41] branch amen so so we want to understand
[37:45] that if the devil can get to that root
[37:47] or to get to that vine and and and work
[37:51] that vine and spoil the vine he can stop
[37:55] fruit from coming and that's what he
[37:58] hates is the fruit for the
[38:00] season but the Bible said in Matthew
[38:03] 4:4 that man shall not live by bread
[38:07] alone is that right but by every
[38:11] word that proceeded from the mouth of
[38:13] God that's what man lives by amen so he
[38:17] gave you and what and man was was meant
[38:21] God made mad in the beginning he created
[38:23] him to be dependent upon God Amen
[38:27] but because we were born and brought
[38:29] into these bodies of sin and come in a
[38:32] in in an under a nature yeah we were
[38:36] come under a nature of sin and until
[38:39] we're born again you'd live under that
[38:42] nature you'd be everything that nature
[38:43] is and that's a sinful
[38:45] nature not to deviate here a little bit
[38:48] but you ever wonder why the badger skin
[38:50] was between the holy and the holiest of
[38:52] holiest is because that old Badger is
[38:55] just like a carnal sin born man arrogant
[38:58] yeah he can he's he can he's has his own
[39:01] way and he wants his own way you know a
[39:04] prophet said that tide of that Badger it
[39:06] laid between the two was your
[39:09] self-will and you had to come through
[39:11] that will you got to die out to that
[39:14] will and and the only way you can die
[39:16] out to it is die out to yourself take
[39:18] the
[39:19] blood amen the only way can go into
[39:22] there into that Holiness of holies is
[39:23] through the blood amen so God God's
[39:27] given us his word and his word is
[39:30] perfect yes and and I was going to come
[39:33] with part two because there's an
[39:35] unfolding behind the badger skin of the
[39:37] word yeah and that's the bride's
[39:39] Revelation yes and so but I've just stop
[39:43] that right now and we'll just not try to
[39:45] go
[39:47] there but the word is perfect yes now in
[39:50] our word of perfect you know we can look
[39:53] at word perfect and say yeah perfect but
[39:55] our our condition our interpretation of
[39:59] perfect is an
[40:00] ending man's
[40:02] interpretation because he can't speak it
[40:05] like God would speak perfect because
[40:06] God's word is
[40:09] eternal amen that's how perfect God is
[40:13] and he's absolutely Flawless there's no
[40:16] shadow of turning with him right there's
[40:18] no darkness in him amen if we're in the
[40:21] light then we're can't walk in darkness
[40:23] and be in light at the same time so
[40:26] every day we have choices in fighting a
[40:28] battle on the battlefield that's right
[40:31] and Satan can you know if you give an if
[40:33] you give the devil an
[40:36] inch he'll take a mile but he comes in
[40:40] inch by inch if you give him an inch
[40:42] you'll take another inch you give one
[40:44] inch you'll take another inch and pretty
[40:46] soon there's several inches and you're
[40:47] out here wondering what
[40:50] happened so I just just Lord just laid
[40:53] in my heart here to just be aware and be
[40:56] attentive to the these little foxes and
[40:59] so there's mandates that God
[41:01] Commandments or directives that God has
[41:03] laid in his word and he expects us to
[41:05] keep it not reason with it not not put
[41:10] our ideas to it don't let the devil
[41:13] bring reasoning and Imagination because
[41:15] he will if he can get you to flirt with
[41:18] him and that's and that that's a spirit
[41:21] of
[41:24] rebellion because the word is perfect
[41:27] right
[41:28] you don't have to wonder about the word
[41:29] the word is absolutely completely
[41:32] Eternal and perfect it'll never
[41:34] fail amen so so we need we should
[41:38] consider our ways are we pleasing the
[41:40] Lord by obeying his word and we obey his
[41:42] word why how just well it's my duty No
[41:45] it should be a love affair between you
[41:48] and God it needs to be it needs to
[41:51] be uh obeyed because you love him and
[41:55] obeyed because it's his word word right
[41:59] you have no other desire in your heart
[42:01] but to believe his word and serve him
[42:03] and you serve him by faith in the word
[42:05] because without faith it's impossible to
[42:07] please him right so we want to obey the
[42:12] word because it's the word we obey it
[42:15] because it's his word and we love him
[42:17] and we will keep his word true love will
[42:20] not go against the word true love can't
[42:24] fail because why it holds the word it
[42:26] rejoices is in the truth amen and so so
[42:30] we want to obey and keep his
[42:33] Commandments because we love him and
[42:35] because we're part of him and we have it
[42:37] in our heart to do
[42:39] so amen and so and so we obey his
[42:44] Commandments and his directives or his
[42:46] mandates because his word is our
[42:48] absolute
[42:50] yesen and we and and when we know that
[42:53] God is the word then we're certain that
[42:56] he's got to keep his
[42:59] word amen there's no failing in God no
[43:03] such a thing as of failing and if and if
[43:06] you're in him how you going to
[43:10] fail if he's in
[43:12] you how can you how can I'm talking
[43:16] about the inward man now how can you
[43:18] fail the outward man will fail every day
[43:20] of fails but see God has made a decision
[43:23] and we talked about this two Sundays ago
[43:26] that by his word he is he is
[43:28] absolutely um uh
[43:32] separated and divided yes I forget that
[43:37] word yeah brought uh divided a Sunder
[43:41] between Soul and Spirit he's showing you
[43:44] who you are and who you're
[43:48] not because you're the spirit of God
[43:50] that's been brought alive in you that's
[43:52] your Revelation that's the bride's
[43:54] Revelation that's the rock that we're on
[43:57] now that rock is offensive to many
[43:59] people yes it but it's not offensive to
[44:01] the bride it's a stumbling to a lot of
[44:04] people because we live by revelation we
[44:06] live by faith we don't live by sight or
[44:08] feelings we live by faith and when we
[44:10] stumble out here if you really know who
[44:12] you
[44:13] are and by the word see who you are and
[44:16] see your name in that book then this
[44:19] outside man they can stumble all want
[44:21] you didn't
[44:24] stumble the outside man May stumble but
[44:26] that was ever your heart's desire or
[44:28] intention to stumble you never had the
[44:31] desire in the first place you're born
[44:32] again you're the word living amen amen
[44:36] and so and so but getting all I don't
[44:38] want to get off my my focus here but it
[44:40] is part of my focus here all right so we
[44:43] we read here don't let those foxes
[44:45] brother brandom said that that every
[44:48] little jot everything you must be
[44:50] faithful
[44:53] in and he said here always the little
[44:56] it's the the the little the little
[44:59] fox that spoils the vine right he said
[45:03] sometimes you leave he said it's not the
[45:05] big things you do it's the little things
[45:08] you leave undone right and Satan is a
[45:11] Master with trying to come in here and
[45:14] just make you just we'll just reason
[45:16] this out a little bit what difference
[45:17] does it make if you do this or you do
[45:20] that the difference it makes is whether
[45:22] the word said to do it or
[45:25] not you see that's one thing he's got to
[45:28] do he's get you off the
[45:30] word he's got you
[45:32] defeated that's what he does he tries to
[45:35] anoint with unbelief that's why he'll
[45:38] try to get you look at what you've done
[45:39] or haven't done or what you said or
[45:41] shouldn't have said but if you ever
[45:42] realize who you really are then you
[45:45] realize this man fails but that inward
[45:48] man is not a weakling right and it can't
[45:52] fail this outside man is a is a failure
[45:55] it's a weakling because Paul even said I
[45:58] glory in my weakness I take pleasure in
[46:01] it because when I'm weak he's strong but
[46:05] when the Bible said when the prophet
[46:07] said don't call yourself weak he was
[46:08] talking about that inside man who you
[46:10] are if not a weakling see we have to
[46:13] we're living by
[46:15] faith not in what we feel not in what we
[46:19] see but who we are praise the Lord Liv
[46:23] so if you live by that you're going to
[46:24] live by the word
[46:27] amen amen because the word is complete
[46:29] and perfect and you're complete in him
[46:32] being in the word you're complete in
[46:34] Him in all things see he can't see you
[46:38] when you come through the blood he only
[46:39] sees one
[46:41] thing he see what the blood produced the
[46:44] life's in the blood and so the token is
[46:47] our message and the token is who we are
[46:51] and everything must come through that
[46:53] blood that's that is that life is our
[46:56] absolute when you come through that life
[46:59] when you come through the
[47:02] blood amen and you receive and you
[47:05] receive the life of that blood or the
[47:08] revelation of Jesus Christ in you yes
[47:12] then that is identifying you as his seed
[47:14] Gene because you couldn't have that
[47:17] Revelation in you without being that
[47:19] seed because he's come to Quicken his
[47:22] word yes and it shows it with laying
[47:24] there ready to be quickened amen amen
[47:27] and so everything he promised you is
[47:29] yours amen you youve come through that
[47:32] so that faith we live by that faith that
[47:35] faith is the substance of the things
[47:37] hoped for amen that faith is the
[47:41] evidence yes that you're in the Rapture
[47:46] you're going to have a body
[47:48] change amen that's exactly what it is
[47:52] because that Faith God's whose Faith
[47:54] remember the Bible said have faith have
[47:56] the Fai have faith in God or other have
[47:58] the faith of
[48:00] God where will the faith of God rest
[48:03] right there in the
[48:05] word he believed his word he spoke it
[48:07] and believed what he said and here we
[48:12] are because we were a part of that word
[48:15] now so don't let the little foxes chase
[48:18] you off of that amen because you're
[48:21] you're are you are the word living
[48:24] yes amen amen so so when you have that
[48:29] that evidence laying in you see God
[48:31] promised a
[48:34] Rapture and everything you have need of
[48:36] when the Holy Spirit comes in and dwells
[48:38] in you everything you have need of for
[48:39] this journey is in you
[48:41] now including the
[48:46] Rapture because the holy spirit in you
[48:48] is the
[48:49] token and that's the
[48:52] faith amen we draw everything through
[48:55] that life right there we have to draw
[48:57] every every little thing comes through
[48:59] the filter right amen that's right so
[49:04] when God said we need to place the token
[49:06] in our households and do what he said to
[49:09] do and get rid of this and get rid of
[49:10] these things clean it
[49:12] up oh well we don't have to do that
[49:17] watch out the little fox reasoning with
[49:22] you amen are you with me yes that's
[49:25] right it's going to be a little fox
[49:26] trying to spoil the vine yes if he can
[49:30] just get at that vine get at that word
[49:32] see the word is where we're standing man
[49:35] shall not live by bread alone but by
[49:36] every
[49:37] word we've got to lay that word we got
[49:40] to hold that word that's our defense yes
[49:42] amen amen is the
[49:44] word when you know you're the word how
[49:46] you going to deny the
[49:48] word care how many mistakes you make out
[49:52] here that is not you in
[49:55] here inside remember there's an outside
[49:57] and an inside man yes remember the word
[50:01] has divided that as yes between spirit
[50:05] and soul brother brandom said you are
[50:08] what's in your
[50:10] soul amen and it declared the real you
[50:13] is the holy spirit in you
[50:16] amen amen there's the word living see
[50:20] Satan can't fight
[50:22] that amen because when you're sealed in
[50:24] he's sealed out yeah
[50:27] amen he can't find you he has to come
[50:31] through the blood to get to you so when
[50:34] you know your position now seated in
[50:36] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you're
[50:38] going to take every word and make it
[50:41] positive present tense yes I have my
[50:45] healing now how why because he he said
[50:47] so said so yes amen that's right and you
[50:50] be you hold it and you begin to confess
[50:52] what you
[50:53] believe because when the Holy Spirit
[50:55] comes in you have faith when holy
[50:57] spirit's living in you you have the
[51:00] faith of
[51:01] God Amen is that right and you confess
[51:05] what you believe then not what you hope
[51:07] for you're confessing what you believe
[51:10] right amen and what do you believe what
[51:13] has he identified you believe you
[51:15] believe the
[51:17] word all right
[51:20] so don't let that little those it's not
[51:23] the big things you do it's the little
[51:25] things you leave undone remember
[51:26] remember a chain is only strongest at
[51:28] its weakest
[51:29] link so there's things in our lives and
[51:31] brother sister I'm not talking you alone
[51:34] I'm talking to myself also because every
[51:36] we are human and we do and we we allow
[51:38] things to come and we make decisions
[51:42] amen and and Satan he's he's subtle but
[51:45] remember how the Holy Spirit Works he
[51:47] shines the light he exposes
[51:51] something amen and that gives you
[51:53] opportunity to make the correction right
[51:56] right amen are you with me because see
[52:00] people take offense at the light because
[52:03] the light many times comes on their on
[52:05] their on the on the scene it uncover
[52:07] light always
[52:08] uncovers darkness and the Bible said the
[52:11] light of the Lord does make manifest
[52:14] it'll make manifest error it'll make
[52:16] manifest sin something in your life you
[52:18] know something like brother Brown said
[52:19] you hear something creeping along in the
[52:21] darkness to flip the light on yeah and
[52:23] they
[52:24] scatter the light comes comes on the
[52:27] scene for your deliverance right that's
[52:29] what we want to see we want light on the
[52:31] subject yes we put light on the subject
[52:34] we can see we can see we we can be set
[52:37] free and that's what God does he brings
[52:39] light many take offense to that you know
[52:42] and say well he offended me by what what
[52:44] offended you light coming forth to
[52:47] expose Darkness offend you why would it
[52:51] offend you it's for your
[52:53] deliverance it's to expose something
[52:55] that you can see now and walk in this
[52:58] light he doesn't want if you refus to
[53:01] walk in the light you know they had no
[53:03] sin until holy the Jesus said you had no
[53:06] sin until the light come on the scene
[53:08] right right and now exposed your sin and
[53:11] now you have the opportunity to be free
[53:13] but you don't want to be free you want
[53:14] to continue in the darkness and take
[53:16] offense to the light be careful we're
[53:19] not doing
[53:22] that amen cuz when the word comes forth
[53:25] it it brings conviction a real
[53:27] conviction right and shows you where
[53:30] your Heir is yes it didn't come to
[53:33] condemn you it come to free you prise
[53:35] the Lord now the condemnation isn't when
[53:38] you reject
[53:40] it the condemnation is when you turn it
[53:43] down right because he that doeth knoweth
[53:46] to do good and doeth it not to him is
[53:48] sin so when the correction of the word
[53:50] comes and you take offense to that word
[53:52] What Spirit would take offense to the
[53:54] word of God right right well there's
[53:58] only two Powers so I think you can
[53:59] answer that
[54:00] yourself amen because the because the
[54:03] Holy Ghost in you will never will always
[54:05] receive correction of the word always
[54:09] all right amen amen so so we don't want
[54:14] those little foxes at work blessed are
[54:17] they and I was going to read that
[54:19] Revelation 224 and let's turn over there
[54:21] right now Revelations 22
[54:28] 22:14 because the Lord doesn't want
[54:32] us as I said we but we take him at his
[54:35] word because he is the word we take it
[54:37] because it's his command and that's the
[54:40] bride that's the bride's joy and that's
[54:42] her Delight is to follow the word to
[54:46] obey the word right because the Jesus
[54:49] said himself he that loves me will keep
[54:50] my word yes amen Love Will Keep the word
[54:55] amen amen
[54:56] amen so so you
[54:59] just here it says right here Matthew or
[55:02] excuse me Revelation 22:4 blessed are
[55:05] they that do his
[55:06] Commandments that they may have right to
[55:09] the tree of life and may enter in
[55:11] through the gates into the city blessed
[55:14] is he that keeps his
[55:17] Commandments that do excuse me that do
[55:19] his Commandments
[55:21] yes amen so so you see brother brandom
[55:25] referring to this blessed are they he
[55:27] said after he said that the chain is
[55:29] only strongest that his weakest link he
[55:31] said blessed are they that do that do
[55:33] all the his Commandments of God of God
[55:36] do the Commandments of God that they
[55:37] might have a right to enter in do all
[55:39] God
[55:41] said amen so we want to go in some of
[55:44] the things that kind of people and
[55:46] including myself because I've been there
[55:48] I've done that but thank God for the
[55:50] light on the subject yes amen aren't you
[55:53] happy when God corrects you yes praise
[55:55] the Lord yes correction is not to demean
[55:58] you it's not a condemnation it's
[56:01] Deliverance it's correction God's
[56:04] correction is for your
[56:06] deliverance he'll bring you home see we
[56:09] have to be corrected we have to be
[56:11] trained we're
[56:12] trained we're taught by him and trained
[56:15] by him like a father uh like you you
[56:18] would train your children it's a
[56:20] training not just so much teaching but
[56:24] training I mean I remember when I when I
[56:27] went through my training in flight to to
[56:30] be a
[56:31] pilot my instructor would put me under
[56:34] situations where I learned by training
[56:36] he'd let me make a mistake yeah just to
[56:39] teach me let me go so far and
[56:44] corrected amen and I learned by that I
[56:47] mean I was taught amen and I believe
[56:50] that's the way it
[56:52] is God's Not Afraid for you to make
[56:54] mistakes he already sees you and know
[56:56] knows who you are you're already a part
[56:57] of him the Lord he's not afraid of
[56:59] mistakes and failures because his word
[57:02] is not going to make a mistake and
[57:03] failure but he's going to teach you how
[57:05] to lean on him
[57:08] yesen and so so we want to Let's and
[57:11] I've I've let's be let's go to 1
[57:16] Samuel we don't want to let down the
[57:18] bars brother sister of
[57:20] anything you know the old poem that
[57:23] brother brandom refers to he said we let
[57:25] down the bars we let down the bars the
[57:27] Sheep got out but how' the goats get in
[57:29] yeah we let down the
[57:31] bars the bar of what the
[57:34] word so we need to sometimes we need to
[57:37] just put the bars back
[57:39] up Let the bar be raised back up amen
[57:43] and so but God has the word for you to
[57:47] to follow to do right and and you don't
[57:50] have to worry about how it's going to be

[58:51] future is clear in the word yeah all the
[58:54] way clear on to the to the
[58:56] the
[58:57] Rapture it's all clear because you're in
[59:01] Christ you're going to be you're going
[59:02] to be tested and tried God loves to test
[59:04] his children but the testing and trials
[59:06] isn't for the the evil or bad it's to
[59:10] get you home yes sir amen right
[59:14] Hallelujah so 1st Samuel
[59:19] 15 1
[59:24] Samuel well I got to find 1 Samuel here
[59:27] I know it's
[59:29] there all
[59:31] right 1 Samuel
[59:38] 15 and I'd like this is where this is
[59:42] where of course he the
[59:44] Lord commanded Saul to go out and
[59:48] kill was an
[59:52] Amic I think it was let me see here
[59:59] but the point I want to make
[1:00:03] here um no AAG king of am amalekites
[1:00:08] right the amalekites destroy them
[1:00:10] completely destroy them don't leave
[1:00:13] child nothing left just go out and slay
[1:00:15] them all and of course Saul in his
[1:00:17] reasoning now that was the word of the
[1:00:19] Lord yes are you with
[1:00:22] me that was the Mandate God made right
[1:00:25] there
[1:00:26] that was his command that was his
[1:00:28] directive yes but the king reasoned with
[1:00:31] it and because of the fear of the people
[1:00:33] because he wanted to please the people
[1:00:35] over and above the word that become an
[1:00:38] idol that's idolatry that's an idolatry
[1:00:42] Spirit which is
[1:00:44] stubbornness let's read it here in verse
[1:00:47] 23 for Rebellion is the sin of
[1:00:51] Witchcraft Rebellion now these are
[1:00:53] strong words yes but they apply as much
[1:00:56] today as they did yesterday probably
[1:00:58] even more so
[1:01:00] today because Rebellion is the sin is is
[1:01:04] as as the sin of
[1:01:07] Witchcraft a witchcraft is listening to
[1:01:09] the devil yes a witch will will be in
[1:01:14] have intercourse with Satan yeah I'm
[1:01:17] talking about communion with him
[1:01:19] listening to him he's being directed by
[1:01:21] the
[1:01:23] devil and so he's he's divining
[1:01:26] but God doesn't want us divining our way
[1:01:30] right and Rebellion Rebellion is open
[1:01:34] resistance to lawful
[1:01:36] Authority that's what Rebellion is an
[1:01:39] open
[1:01:41] resistance to lawful Authority and
[1:01:43] there's only one true lawful Authority
[1:01:45] that we need to hear and receive and
[1:01:47] that's God's word that's a word of our
[1:01:49] Lord and he didn't do that did he you
[1:01:51] know the story you know how it goes he
[1:01:54] he he reasoned with it and yet told told
[1:01:56] Samuel I've done what God Said then why
[1:01:58] do I hear the Lo of animals and why this
[1:02:02] and why that and how come I see this
[1:02:04] King still
[1:02:07] alive well we kept the better for
[1:02:10] sacrifice does god require sacrifice
[1:02:12] over obedience to his word
[1:02:15] right see no he doesn't it's better to
[1:02:19] obey isn't that right so let that come
[1:02:22] down to our hearts tonight it's better
[1:02:24] to obey
[1:02:26] then put an idol up there of what you
[1:02:28] think and what people think and what you
[1:02:29] reason with because when you begin to
[1:02:32] reason against the word you're flirting
[1:02:34] with the
[1:02:36] devil if begin to reason with the
[1:02:39] word watch I I've got a quote here if
[1:02:41] you want me to read it Christ wants his
[1:02:43] wife pure with the
[1:02:47] word the that's the way she must be this
[1:02:51] is the third seal okay that's the way
[1:02:53] she must be because nothing not one jot
[1:02:56] or one TT will pass from that law that
[1:02:59] book till it's all
[1:03:01] finished Jesus said both heavens and
[1:03:03] earth will pass away but my word shall
[1:03:05] never pass away Matthew
[1:03:09] 24:35 my word shall never pass away
[1:03:12] don't put any interpretation to
[1:03:19] it don't put any interpretation to it
[1:03:22] God knows how to lead you and direct you
[1:03:25] yesen
[1:03:26] amen he knows how to keep
[1:03:29] you and he's given you his word you say
[1:03:32] well I love the Lord and I will obey him
[1:03:34] then what about the scripture here
[1:03:38] yeah because the fruit you're living is
[1:03:40] not bearing out that
[1:03:42] scripture the Holy Ghost will bear
[1:03:44] witness to his word yes amen now I'm not
[1:03:48] condemning anyone please understand I'm
[1:03:50] just talking about a little fox that
[1:03:51] wants to come into real Believers lives
[1:03:54] and try to get you off the word even to
[1:03:56] simple things like keeping the speed
[1:04:00] limit I'm going to come on home now I
[1:04:03] listen I you say well that doesn't make
[1:04:05] any difference but it doesn't I've got
[1:04:07] some word here that makes a difference
[1:04:11] right amen because we've got a mandate
[1:04:14] by God you're to obey those in authority
[1:04:17] over you as long as it agrees with the
[1:04:23] word are you with me
[1:04:26] then if you don't and you reason about
[1:04:28] it then it's a little
[1:04:30] fox he watch these little foxes it's
[1:04:33] these little things you let go
[1:04:36] undone okay so he said now he want he
[1:04:40] said don't you put no interpretation to
[1:04:42] he wants the pure
[1:04:44] unadulterated not even he wants you pure
[1:04:47] he wants his bride pure and
[1:04:48] unadulterated not even a flirt yes I
[1:04:53] wouldn't want my wife flirting with some
[1:04:54] other man
[1:04:59] right wives submit yourselves to your
[1:05:06] husbands I I'm going to amen it
[1:05:08] regardless whether you do or not why
[1:05:11] submit yourselves to your own
[1:05:13] husbands that's the word of
[1:05:16] God well I'll have you know my husband
[1:05:19] just doesn't believe like I do or this
[1:05:21] or that or some other reason you can
[1:05:23] give it didn't say whether you had a
[1:05:25] reason
[1:05:26] wives submit yourselves to your own
[1:05:31] husbands all right husbands love your
[1:05:35] wives as Christ loved the church and
[1:05:38] gave
[1:05:41] himself for it is that right now what
[1:05:44] about that that's as much the word of
[1:05:46] God as the other
[1:05:49] ones we're coming down home this morning
[1:05:52] tonight and I I don't like to preach
[1:05:54] like this praise Lord
[1:05:59] I've got to though you've got to I I'm
[1:06:03] looking we're looking at the New Year
[1:06:04] we're not turning a new Leaf we're
[1:06:07] saying Lord help me I will not
[1:06:09] compromise with your word I don't care
[1:06:11] how bad it gets I don't care how much it
[1:06:14] looks radical to my way of thinking
[1:06:19] right I'm going to keep your word
[1:06:21] because it's your word
[1:06:24] amen and I love you and I know you love
[1:06:27] me and I have one desire Lord search me
[1:06:31] try me if you find anything in my life
[1:06:33] that's outside of your word I want to be
[1:06:35] corrected and Lord help me to
[1:06:39] quickly ask you to forgive me and turn
[1:06:41] around and go the way of the word and
[1:06:44] leave it there in the word and God will
[1:06:46] take care of
[1:06:48] it do you believe he'll take care of his
[1:06:51] word amen he's testing you to see if
[1:06:54] you'll believe him amen
[1:06:57] amen all right he said I wouldn't want
[1:07:01] my wife flirting with some other other
[1:07:04] other man and when you go to listening
[1:07:07] to any kind of reasoning beyond that
[1:07:10] word you're listening you're flirting
[1:07:13] with
[1:07:15] Satan
[1:07:17] amen Rebellion is as a sin of
[1:07:22] Witchcraft we don't want that Spirit
[1:07:24] around us we don't want that rebellious
[1:07:27] Spirit around I I'm not saying you do it
[1:07:29] intentionally but oh how the devil likes
[1:07:32] to come in and reason with us on
[1:07:34] things and you know good and well this
[1:07:36] is what the word said about
[1:07:38] it but because of your reasoning and the
[1:07:41] appearance of what it may be to your
[1:07:43] thinking and what others may think about
[1:07:45] it you turn to that instead of the word
[1:07:48] you've added your own thinking to it and
[1:07:51] you created your own Idol
[1:07:55] anything that stands between you and
[1:07:57] that word is an
[1:08:01] idol amen that's right you build your
[1:08:06] little image and this is what you'll
[1:08:07] walk in here's the word saying don't do
[1:08:09] it right or the word saying do it and
[1:08:13] used to be a reason why it shouldn't be
[1:08:15] done and why you shouldn't do it you
[1:08:19] have no reasoning to add to that
[1:08:22] amen amen amen all right consider our
[1:08:26] ways tonight let us all consider our
[1:08:31] ways am I obeying you fully Lord am I
[1:08:35] have I done all that you have asked me
[1:08:38] to do am I following and obeying every
[1:08:40] word that comes out of the mouth of God
[1:08:44] man shall not live by bread alone but
[1:08:46] every word
[1:08:49] amen all
[1:08:54] right so stubborn Rebellion is the sin
[1:08:57] of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as the
[1:08:59] as is as iniquity and
[1:09:05] idolatry you see he wouldn't he just was
[1:09:08] stubborn Saul was
[1:09:11] stubborn then I'm going to have my own
[1:09:13] way you say well he might not come right
[1:09:15] out and said that but that's the fruit
[1:09:17] he was bearing I'm going to have my own
[1:09:19] way no matter what the word says I heard
[1:09:21] what Samuel said but I'm King
[1:09:26] how many times have we lifted up our own
[1:09:28] self as an
[1:09:29] idol put our own self there put our own
[1:09:32] self there in front of it and bow to
[1:09:36] that instead of bowing to the word God
[1:09:39] help
[1:09:43] us we bow to our feelings we bow to our
[1:09:46] reasoning we bow to our imagination we
[1:09:49] bow to anything the devil can get you to
[1:09:51] believe through your
[1:09:53] senses contrary to the word right and we
[1:09:57] bow to that thing and that becomes
[1:09:59] idolatry yes a spirit of idolatry I'm
[1:10:02] not calling you an idolatrous but it's
[1:10:04] the spirit of idolatry if you continue
[1:10:06] with that what's going to happen little
[1:10:09] by little you've gone off the path you
[1:10:12] got out of step and he screamed get back
[1:10:15] in Step
[1:10:16] yes stay in step with the word
[1:10:21] amen now there's many many things that
[1:10:24] we could talk about tonight that little
[1:10:27] foxes will come in and keep you away
[1:10:29] from I'm going to mention a
[1:10:30] few that okay I'm going to mention a few
[1:10:35] as we go along
[1:10:37] here now but you're flirting with Satan
[1:10:40] when you you go any kind of reasonings
[1:10:42] beyond that word beyond that simple
[1:10:45] straightforward perfect
[1:10:47] Flawless yes
[1:10:50] word there's nothing as perfect as it
[1:10:53] that's right as I said in our human
[1:10:56] capacity of what's perfect can't touch
[1:10:58] it it's
[1:11:00] perfect eternally
[1:11:03] perfect you can't get any clearer
[1:11:06] perfect than
[1:11:07] that all
[1:11:09] right okay and though I'll just let you
[1:11:12] know Satan knows good and well the word
[1:11:13] is what created him yeah and the word is
[1:11:16] what will destroy
[1:11:20] him that's why he hates the word that's
[1:11:23] why he'll do everything against the word
[1:11:25] if he can get you from believing that
[1:11:27] word simply simply simply believing and
[1:11:31] taking God at his
[1:11:33] word as long as you stay behind that
[1:11:36] word Satan can't touch it right can't
[1:11:39] touch you he can't touch
[1:11:41] anything but if you can bust a hole
[1:11:43] through the word like he did Eve through
[1:11:45] is the reasoning and what she saw and
[1:11:48] what she feel what she
[1:11:49] seen and here let me tell you what he
[1:11:53] meant and need look up big beautiful
[1:11:55] creature to him and had more knowledge
[1:11:57] than what her husband did
[1:12:02] hello all right and if we ever have a
[1:12:06] day we have today that's Back to Eden
[1:12:09] again
[1:12:10] yes and that's just how subtle he
[1:12:14] is and he tries to tries to get you to
[1:12:17] disbelieve and he said why you're a
[1:12:18] Believer you're a Christian but he then
[1:12:20] injects his religious
[1:12:23] knowledge in and above the word
[1:12:25] yes okay I think you get the part of
[1:12:28] that let's go
[1:12:30] on you stay right with the word you he
[1:12:33] want you to stay unadulterated you stay
[1:12:35] right with that word
[1:12:37] unadulterated don't you commit adultery
[1:12:40] with that
[1:12:41] Spirit fornication and adultery with
[1:12:44] another man another Spirit you have one
[1:12:47] Spirit to obey and one to follow and
[1:12:50] that's the word of God it's not just a
[1:12:53] letter to you it is the Spirit of the
[1:12:55] Living God in you and that spirit will
[1:12:58] obey that word so go back to what you as
[1:13:01] a man thinketh in his heart so is he so
[1:13:04] what are you thinking in your heart is
[1:13:06] who you are Satan not coming there he's
[1:13:08] coming out here to this man of
[1:13:11] reasoning and you've got either accept
[1:13:13] it or reject it you the word has to
[1:13:16] accept it or reject
[1:13:17] it that inside man's got to accepted or
[1:13:20] rejected it's not the outside man
[1:13:22] rejecting or accepting right you either
[1:13:24] give a channel for it and you close the
[1:13:26] door how you going to close the door
[1:13:28] resist the devil and he won't just walk
[1:13:31] away he'll get away
[1:13:33] quickly just resist him turn him down
[1:13:36] this is what the word said this is what
[1:13:39] I believe this is my absolute get away
[1:13:42] from me
[1:13:43] Satan I'm not going there I'm not
[1:13:46] accepting those
[1:13:50] thoughts you must cha you must challenge
[1:13:53] the devil on the battlefield and take
[1:13:55] the word over
[1:13:57] him amen all right so
[1:14:02] now nobody's lifting thems up and say
[1:14:05] one I'm you know I David Dean Hart's
[1:14:08] bigger than somebody else no way shape
[1:14:10] or form we're all in the same boat but
[1:14:13] if you're born again we are too also in
[1:14:16] the same
[1:14:18] ship we have Fellowship yes amen I'm
[1:14:21] wanting you to see what you are who you
[1:14:23] are and that you have authority over
[1:14:25] anything that's contrary to the word is
[1:14:27] your
[1:14:28] enemy I don't care what form it comes
[1:14:32] in it's your
[1:14:35] enemy anything contrary to that word any
[1:14:38] flirting around with something contrary
[1:14:41] to the word oh how the devil's a master
[1:14:43] and say well you know if you don't if
[1:14:45] you don't do this you don't love
[1:14:47] them and you're flirting with the
[1:14:50] word contrary to the word letting a
[1:14:53] Spirit come in that would lead you away
[1:14:55] from that word either you're not born
[1:14:57] again or you need to wake up because the
[1:15:00] Holy Spirit Will discern
[1:15:02] that that's
[1:15:05] right the Holy Spirit Will discern
[1:15:07] what's the right spirit and not the
[1:15:09] right spirit and you will correct
[1:15:11] yourself because he'll keep it corrected
[1:15:14] but if you don't see that Spirit there's
[1:15:16] something wrong but there's others that
[1:15:18] do and when it's brought to you and puts
[1:15:21] light on the pathway you take offense to
[1:15:23] it why because there's a devil in there
[1:15:25] rebelling against the word boy that was
[1:15:31] strong but that's what it is it's the
[1:15:34] same as
[1:15:35] witchcraft all right all right now you
[1:15:38] just can I'm not just reading the word
[1:15:40] to you here it's a sin of Witchcraft and
[1:15:42] stubbornness is Iniquity and idolatry
[1:15:44] because you're accepting what you think
[1:15:46] over and above what the word
[1:15:51] said all right because thou Hast
[1:15:54] rejected the word of the Lord he hath
[1:15:56] also rejected thee from being
[1:15:59] King don't compromise with the
[1:16:02] word the spirit today is compromised
[1:16:06] yeah you can live between the two Realms
[1:16:09] you
[1:16:10] can't you're either going to live in the
[1:16:12] word live in the light walk in the light
[1:16:14] or you're walking in
[1:16:16] darkness you can't be a double-minded
[1:16:20] man you either have the mind of Christ
[1:16:22] or you don't have the mind of Christ
[1:16:24] that's right
[1:16:25] amen yes sir
[1:16:28] amen either it's the word or it isn't
[1:16:30] the word there's no in between no
[1:16:37] compromise
[1:16:39] amen and Satan does not want you
[1:16:41] compromising with a a a a denominational
[1:16:45] spirit I don't care how much of the
[1:16:47] message they claim to believe if it's
[1:16:50] denominational if it's a wrong spirit
[1:16:52] and it's not leading you it's leading
[1:16:53] you to a a system of man instead of the
[1:16:56] word revealed for the hour and season
[1:16:59] the fruit of the Season get away from it
[1:17:01] as quick as you
[1:17:02] can amen and let me just come right back
[1:17:06] and say the holy spirit in you will
[1:17:08] discern that
[1:17:16] amen you see brother and sister I wish I
[1:17:20] could explain to you what I
[1:17:22] believe don't we all how many would say
[1:17:24] I wish everybody could I wish I could
[1:17:26] explain to you you can't explain this no
[1:17:29] more than nothing you can't give it to
[1:17:31] anybody you can't give Revelation to
[1:17:33] somebody else
[1:17:37] amen that's right you can't do it
[1:17:45] right oh I won't I just something I was
[1:17:48] going to say but I'll just go I'll go
[1:17:49] off in the other message if I do that so
[1:17:51] anyway let's let's stop right here
[1:17:53] stubbornness okay witchcraft okay
[1:17:56] listening to the devil Mark 12:13 let's
[1:17:59] go over there just a moment before we go
[1:18:01] any further as I've already I've already
[1:18:04] quoted this but I want to see it I want
[1:18:06] you to see it there's many places in the
[1:18:07] scripture this is Mark there's places in
[1:18:10] in Matthew Mark
[1:18:16] 12 but they came to
[1:18:20] Jesus and this is Mark chap 12 and I
[1:18:24] want verse
[1:18:25] 13 and they send unto him certain of the
[1:18:28] Pharisees and of the herodians to catch
[1:18:32] him in his words Bo the devil likes to
[1:18:34] do that yeah doesn't he
[1:18:41] though I I'd like to catch him in his
[1:18:44] words and when they were come and you
[1:18:47] know there's good people that do that
[1:18:50] sad good
[1:18:52] people don't even realize what SP
[1:18:54] they're walking
[1:18:56] by catch him in his words and when they
[1:18:59] were come they say unto him Master we
[1:19:01] know that thou art true no they didn't
[1:19:04] they didn't know that they didn't
[1:19:06] believe that right Thou Art true and
[1:19:08] regardest and regardest not the person
[1:19:10] of men and teach us the way of God and
[1:19:12] truth and why didn't they believe
[1:19:15] it why didn't they walk in it here
[1:19:18] they're confessing something that why
[1:19:20] Jesus said you my Hypocrites yeah you
[1:19:23] don't believe that no more than nothing
[1:19:25] you don't believe my words are truth
[1:19:28] you'd follow it right well we be not be
[1:19:31] of
[1:19:34] adultery John
[1:19:36] 8 he said you are because you can't hear
[1:19:39] my
[1:19:40] word if God were your father you'd hear
[1:19:42] my word you'd receive it that's right
[1:19:45] the evidence of the Holy Ghost is have
[1:19:46] an ability by God to receive and hear
[1:19:48] the word for the season yes and we've
[1:19:50] turned a corner this is bride time this
[1:19:53] is seed time yes this is Rapture hour
[1:19:56] Rapture raptured
[1:19:58] age moves on for the bride not the
[1:20:01] church the
[1:20:02] bride
[1:20:04] amen hallelujah all right so he said now
[1:20:09] you don't care about the person of men
[1:20:11] but teaches the way of God and Truth is
[1:20:12] it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or
[1:20:14] not or we could even say is it lawful
[1:20:18] now that was tribute cuz when when Rome
[1:20:20] or a country would defeat another one
[1:20:21] they they made him pay tribute to them
[1:20:24] okay but the same things are applying to
[1:20:27] taxes is it lawful to pay taxes or not
[1:20:31] well I don't I believe that I believe
[1:20:33] the Constitution says it's against the
[1:20:35] Constitution for them to even charge us
[1:20:38] taxes I say Amen to that
[1:20:44] but Caesar
[1:20:48] said whether you understand it or not
[1:20:51] all right Caesar
[1:20:53] says to pay certain certain
[1:20:59] amount can you
[1:21:02] imagine
[1:21:03] Joseph with Mary knowing she was Buri
[1:21:07] and and about to deliver had to make a
[1:21:09] trip to
[1:21:12] Bethlehem on the part cause of
[1:21:15] taxes because they required
[1:21:20] taxes but they gave Caesar what Caesars
[1:21:27] right cuz it wasn't against God's word
[1:21:30] for them to go down to Bethlehem and pay
[1:21:36] taxes
[1:21:38] amen all right are you with me see
[1:21:41] because Luke told us the story I won't
[1:21:44] go there but he it told us the
[1:21:47] story and here's what he here's what he
[1:21:50] said but all things are for ordained of
[1:21:52] God that work together for good to them
[1:21:54] love him do you believe that tonight all
[1:21:57] things work together for good to them
[1:21:59] that love God do you not know he knew
[1:22:01] beforehand I'd be running out of ink and
[1:22:03] I would all these other things see do
[1:22:07] you not know that he knew that yeah do
[1:22:09] you not know that he knew you'd be
[1:22:10] sitting here tonight what your thoughts
[1:22:12] are in your mind right now do you not
[1:22:14] know that the attitude you take toward
[1:22:16] the word right here Will May determine
[1:22:18] you're Eternal
[1:22:21] Destiny attitude's a big thing at atude
[1:22:24] creates
[1:22:27] atmosphere a right mental attitude is a
[1:22:30] powerful powerful
[1:22:32] thing because just the attitude can
[1:22:34] judge you the Judgment whether you get
[1:22:35] eternal life or no what attitude you
[1:22:38] take toward the word of God and bride
[1:22:41] form boy that's right all right see so
[1:22:47] here they are God knew all about it was
[1:22:49] and brother brother said it was ordained
[1:22:51] of God that there should be a heartless
[1:22:52] King in that day and a blood thirsty
[1:22:55] Herod God knew all about it God knew
[1:22:56] about the taxes and how brutal
[1:22:58] government did not have no thoughts of
[1:23:00] Mercy on that poor mother and was just
[1:23:03] ready about about ready ready to about
[1:23:06] to deliver her firstborn son in a few
[1:23:08] days but he commanded that they should
[1:23:10] come to the native their native
[1:23:12] birthplace and pay taxes no matter what
[1:23:15] condition she's in she's got to come
[1:23:16] anyhow God knew all about that he fornew
[1:23:19] all things and he knew all things see
[1:23:21] and he makes
[1:23:22] everything work together together for
[1:23:28] good so what' they
[1:23:30] do they
[1:23:35] went because it was God's
[1:23:37] command now we're going to come to that
[1:23:39] you say Where's that in the Scripture it
[1:23:41] was God's command that they obey that
[1:23:45] King oh I've got the
[1:23:48] scripture
[1:23:50] amen because God has put powers in place
[1:23:55] and if you don't obey those
[1:23:57] Powers now I'm not talking about
[1:23:59] anything contrary to the word because
[1:24:01] the Bible said and I just read it to oh
[1:24:03] I didn't read it to you did I I didn't
[1:24:04] finish it but the Bible said to give
[1:24:08] Caesar what Caesars give God what's God
[1:24:12] is that right if you don't listen to
[1:24:14] those powers and do what they say and
[1:24:16] you want to rebel against it you are
[1:24:18] rebelling against God's word himself
[1:24:25] because he put that power over you to
[1:24:26] see what you'd
[1:24:28] do and he said obey it so I want to get
[1:24:31] to these scriptures before we get a
[1:24:32] finish here and so so let's just hurry
[1:24:36] now let's go back to Mark so they tested
[1:24:39] him they were trying him is it lawful to
[1:24:41] give tribute to Caesar or not shall we
[1:24:43] give or shall we not
[1:24:45] give but he knowing their hypocrisy said
[1:24:49] unto them why tempt ye me why tempt the
[1:24:53] word yeah
[1:24:55] bring me a penny that I may see it and
[1:24:57] they brought it and he saith to them who
[1:24:58] is this
[1:25:00] inscription who is this image excuse me
[1:25:02] and
[1:25:03] superscription and they said unto him
[1:25:05] Caesars and Jesus answered and said un
[1:25:07] them render to Caesar the things that
[1:25:09] are Caesars and to Gods the things that
[1:25:11] are
[1:25:12] gods and they marveled at him regardless
[1:25:16] of what you think about
[1:25:18] it regardless of what I think about
[1:25:21] it and the Holy Ghost if he's in you
[1:25:23] will know what's the word and not the
[1:25:25] word and when he said to obey it he
[1:25:27] means for you to obey it if you don't
[1:25:29] obey it you've disobeyed
[1:25:32] him boy that's powerful I know
[1:25:36] but we're talking about little
[1:25:40] foxes because I don't know what this
[1:25:42] year is going to bring and there may be
[1:25:43] some very strange things
[1:25:47] happen that they may up and mandate and
[1:25:50] up and and and make law I don't know a
[1:25:54] mandate is a command or directive
[1:25:57] whether it be by a governor or this or
[1:25:59] that it's a mandate it's not a
[1:26:00] suggestion it's a mandate that's right
[1:26:03] and you are under the word under the
[1:26:05] authority of the word to obey that as
[1:26:07] long as it's not going against the
[1:26:12] word amen now I can give you instances
[1:26:16] where it did go against the word the
[1:26:17] four Hebrew children refused to Bow
[1:26:19] before the Idol because it was against
[1:26:21] the word but it was the command of a
[1:26:23] king
[1:26:24] but it was against the word and so they
[1:26:27] refused to Bow before the idol of
[1:26:29] William
[1:26:31] brandham well you say William Brown yeah
[1:26:33] it was it was Daniel that
[1:26:35] time but what is it
[1:26:38] today instead of looking in on what he
[1:26:40] what the word unsealed and look in a
[1:26:43] white stone that had no writing and he
[1:26:45] said look in on this they decided to
[1:26:47] follow the
[1:26:52] prophet that was their image that was
[1:26:55] who they were following instead of
[1:26:56] looking in on what was be revealed to
[1:26:58] them what was to be opened and he said
[1:27:01] I've got to go west to get the
[1:27:02] interpretation of this Unwritten word in
[1:27:04] Revelations
[1:27:08] 10 and I met that Mighty Angel up there
[1:27:11] and he told me and he had the seven seal
[1:27:13] and I had to go there to get it and I
[1:27:15] had to come back and I had that open
[1:27:17] that word had to be open that John knew
[1:27:20] what it
[1:27:21] said think of that and where was it
[1:27:24] hidden it was hidden in the
[1:27:27] mountain the stone cut out of the
[1:27:29] mountain it was hid in the
[1:27:34] mountain this is what the bride you see
[1:27:36] what I'm saying is this they didn't look
[1:27:39] in on it right they didn't keep their
[1:27:41] eye on it they kept their eye on a man
[1:27:43] and today that spirit's just as strong
[1:27:45] and it's an idolatrous
[1:27:48] Spirit that's exactly what it
[1:27:51] is I'll tell you what it is you want me
[1:27:53] to tell you what it is it's a dominating
[1:27:56] Catholic spirit it's a dominating female
[1:28:00] Spirit to dominate over the
[1:28:06] word amen and the bride won't give into
[1:28:09] that spirit because she has discernment
[1:28:11] of what that spirit
[1:28:15] is she has one thing to let dominate her
[1:28:18] and that's her headship which is a
[1:28:20] kingdom and the kingdom of God in you
[1:28:22] will not leave this word
[1:28:25] amen because it'll receive it by
[1:28:28] Revelation that's why God hid it from
[1:28:30] others and would receive it reveal it to
[1:28:33] babes that was God's dividing Point Abel
[1:28:36] probably said I can't explain Cain why
[1:28:38] God did
[1:28:40] this and Cain came to him and said don't
[1:28:42] you know the seventh seal is not
[1:28:45] opened oh my and don't you understand
[1:28:48] you say Brother David you shouldn't have
[1:28:49] said that I am exposing a
[1:28:53] spirit you're meeting the same thing
[1:28:55] today the same thing I don't know those
[1:28:59] people or what they do or what they
[1:29:00] don't do that's none of my business but
[1:29:02] what was said is contrary to the
[1:29:10] word it's contrary to the word that
[1:29:13] doesn't mean I don't like the person it
[1:29:16] don't mean I don't pray for the person
[1:29:18] but what they said
[1:29:22] right amen contrary to the
[1:29:25] word because it has been
[1:29:28] opened and if it hadn't been open we
[1:29:30] couldn't see who we are behind that
[1:29:33] Veil we would never come to the full
[1:29:35] complete revelation of Jesus Christ this
[1:29:38] is the hour for the complete revelation
[1:29:40] of himself to be
[1:29:44] finished and it's the unveiling of all
[1:29:46] these loose ends that brought the
[1:29:48] mystery to Revelation and we can enter
[1:29:50] in now and see who we are fully that's
[1:29:53] right
[1:29:57] amen
[1:30:03] amen now if that offends you it wasn't
[1:30:07] me that did
[1:30:09] that because I'm speaking
[1:30:12] truth amen it's not that it's that word
[1:30:17] that
[1:30:19] light then you need to search the
[1:30:21] scriptures the Bible Jesus even said
[1:30:23] search the scriptures for in them you
[1:30:25] think you have eternal life and they are
[1:30:27] they that testify of me and if it
[1:30:29] testified of him it's got to testify of
[1:30:31] the Bride for you're in the same
[1:30:35] Revelation that's right amen search the
[1:30:39] scriptures you want to know who Jesus
[1:30:41] Christ isday you want to see the son of
[1:30:43] man search the scriptures you're going
[1:30:44] to find him in Bride
[1:30:48] form praise the
[1:30:51] Lord Brother I tell you that's getting
[1:30:53] pretty stiff but that's the
[1:30:55] truth
[1:30:57] it
[1:31:01] amen I wouldn't flirt with it at
[1:31:05] all in fact the opposite the word says
[1:31:08] the opposite right the word says for you
[1:31:11] to get away from
[1:31:13] it not keep flirting with
[1:31:17] it because be careful it can be little
[1:31:20] foxes that's exactly right
[1:31:24] amen now you say you have no right I
[1:31:27] have every right to say
[1:31:30] this I'm a servant of Jesus Christ I am
[1:31:33] here to give his thoughts in a
[1:31:37] word and it's for the purpose of

[1:31:47] thinking we are not giving our own
[1:31:50] thoughts we're saying what's already
[1:31:52] been said because the bride is the final
[1:31:54] voice to this final age whether you like
[1:31:57] it or don't like it that's right that's
[1:31:59] right that's none of my business how you
[1:32:01] want to react to it's none of my
[1:32:02] business whether you can even receive it
[1:32:04] or not is not my business my business is
[1:32:07] to give it to you absolutely to preach
[1:32:10] it amen amen we need to get their eyes
[1:32:12] off of how people react to it realize we
[1:32:14] don't have any responsibility of
[1:32:20] that or they accept it or not it's God
[1:32:23] that has to quick it to them but we are
[1:32:25] commanded by God to preach the truth so

[1:34:26] not of
[1:34:29] God Amen I I just it's not of God and
[1:34:33] the only way you can get away from that
[1:34:35] is you have to have faith to overcome
[1:34:36] that that's if you are a Christian you
[1:34:39] are a son or daughter of God whichever
[1:34:40] you may be and you will never be able to
[1:34:42] stand and just rebuke it rebuke it and
[1:34:44] rebuke it it's just like tantalizing a
[1:34:46] rattlesnake just laying there ready to
[1:34:48] bite you if you just ignore him and walk
[1:34:50] away from him he can't hurt you

[1:35:59] quicker I'll bypass some of this
[1:36:04] now we know what 2 Corinthians 10:5 said
[1:36:07] the Warfare is not carnal but spiritual
[1:36:09] right casting down of imaginations and
[1:36:12] any High thing that exalts itself
[1:36:14] against the word of God you bring in
[1:36:16] subjection to the word you're bringing
[1:36:17] every thought under obedience to Christ

[1:36:23] amen don't and you say well how I can do
[1:36:26] that you have the absolute ability to
[1:36:29] bring every thought under obedience to
[1:36:31] Christ if you're born again believer
[1:36:33] you've been given the ability by God to
[1:36:36] do that that's your mandate that's your
[1:36:39] Authority amen and the word is in your
[1:36:42] mouth
[1:36:45] amen you will know that the word in the
[1:36:47] mouth of believing Christians never
[1:36:49] failed you know that do you realize that
[1:36:52] when a born again man takes that word
[1:36:53] and puts it upon his lips it's the same
[1:36:55] as deity speaking Yeah do you realize
[1:36:58] that he gave you that Authority you
[1:37:00] speak the word and I'll perform it
[1:37:02] where's the

[1:37:15] another but that one Nature has already
[1:37:16] come to overcome the other nature and
[1:37:18] the other nature of the flesh is your
[1:37:21] enemy but he's a defeated enemy
[1:37:24] amen and the Bible said he would bring
[1:37:26] this word inside of me this this word
[1:37:28] this Living Word will bring my body
[1:37:30] under obedience to that word and bring
[1:37:32] it subject to the
[1:37:34] word

[1:37:41] bars don't let down the bars now don't

[1:37:49] will take care of the rest you stand for
[1:37:50] him he'll stand for you don't take away
[1:37:52] or add to the word it's perfect let's go
[1:37:55] to Titus I want to get through these
[1:37:57] scriptures and I'm going to close I just
[1:37:59] may have to read through them Titus
[1:38:00] Chapter 3 Verse one put them in mind to
[1:38:04] be subject to
[1:38:06] principalities and powers to obey
[1:38:09] magistrates to be ready to to every good
[1:38:15] work what did it just say to do put them
[1:38:18] in mind Titus is saying you put them in
[1:38:21] mind to obey to be sub to
[1:38:25] principalities and powers and Obey
[1:38:33] magistrates well
[1:38:35] amen
[1:38:37] amen all right and to be ready to every
[1:38:41] good work how do you have a good work by
[1:38:43] Believing on him whom God has sent the
[1:38:46] word the Son of God the never failing
[1:38:50] Lord our Lord yes receiveing
[1:38:54] amen all right all right let's go to
[1:38:56] another scripture if that's not enough
[1:38:58] let's go to another
[1:39:00] one Romans
[1:39:04] 13 Romans the 13th
[1:39:07] chapter and the first verse let's start
[1:39:11] reading let every soul be subject unto
[1:39:13] the higher powers for there is no power
[1:39:17] but of god the powers that be are
[1:39:20] ordained of God yes yes okay now that
[1:39:24] just settles it right there okay let's
[1:39:26] he put the Power there he knew what
[1:39:28] you'd come under
[1:39:30] today he knew what struggles you'd go
[1:39:32] through with those Powers yes is that
[1:39:34] right it may work against your your
[1:39:37] feelings it may work against your I
[1:39:39] don't like to do that therefore I'm not
[1:39:41] going to do it be
[1:39:45] careful that you're not disobeying the
[1:39:48] higher power that God put there because
[1:39:51] if you turn that down and disobey you've
[1:39:54] disobeyed the word of God as long as
[1:39:57] that thing doesn't take you in a
[1:39:58] contrary to the word you are under
[1:40:00] mandate by God's Own word to obey it and
[1:40:04] do
[1:40:06] it whether you like it or whether you
[1:40:09] don't like
[1:40:12] it you say you're just making fun of our
[1:40:14] feeling no I'm not making fun of your
[1:40:15] feelings I'm showing you the
[1:40:18] word God's concerned about
[1:40:20] this because if you don't little foxes
[1:40:23] are
[1:40:25] somewhere okay let's go a little further
[1:40:28] he said I'm reading on whosoever
[1:40:30] therefore resisteth the power that he's
[1:40:33] put ordained resisteth the power
[1:40:35] resisteth the ordinance of God and they
[1:40:38] that resist shall receive to themselves
[1:40:42] damnation because what about judgment
[1:40:44] when it's taken before you and say you
[1:40:46] had the you had the order there and you
[1:40:48] just willfully went against my
[1:40:52] word how's he going to be judged right
[1:40:56] he's going to ask you why why didn't you
[1:40:57] obey it it was my
[1:41:02] word well you could give him every
[1:41:04] reason you wanted to you think that's
[1:41:05] going to stand you think that's going to
[1:41:07] hold up under the white
[1:41:10] Throne God expects his people you say
[1:41:14] well we don't believe in just rituals
[1:41:15] and on we don't make this message a book
[1:41:18] of rules and regulations I'm
[1:41:19] not I've already said this is a love
[1:41:22] affair
[1:41:24] and this is our husband's word
[1:41:28] wives bride who are we subject
[1:41:33] to are you with me yes all right I got
[1:41:37] got to hurry now watch let's go a little
[1:41:40] 13 verse three for rulers are not a
[1:41:42] terror to Good
[1:41:45] Works see rulers are not a teror to good
[1:41:48] works but to the evil wil thou then be
[1:41:52] afraid of the power do that which is
[1:41:54] good and thou shalt have Praise of the
[1:41:59] same all right for he is the minister
[1:42:02] watch what this power that God's
[1:42:04] ordained here he is the Minister of God
[1:42:06] to thee for good but if thou do that
[1:42:10] which is evil be afraid for he beareth
[1:42:12] not the sword in vain for he is the
[1:42:14] Minister of God can you imagine God
[1:42:16] telling you that this ungodly magistrate
[1:42:19] out here that he's put in power over you
[1:42:21] and this policeman or this author of
[1:42:23] this mayor or this Governor or president
[1:42:29] or is a
[1:42:32] minister of
[1:42:34] God to you and
[1:42:39] I let me say it
[1:42:44] again well Brother David I have better
[1:42:47] judgment than he does I know better I
[1:42:50] don't care what you know better the word
[1:42:52] said obey
[1:42:58] him now you can sit here and reason all
[1:43:00] you want with what I'm
[1:43:02] saying not going to do you a bit of good
[1:43:05] because here's the
[1:43:07] word why put your own thinking in it
[1:43:11] just do
[1:43:13] it as long as it do against the word yes
[1:43:16] I'm I'm making what do you call that
[1:43:18] brother Paul when he when you say he
[1:43:20] makes a something for it you know here
[1:43:23] it is but as long as it doesn't leave
[1:43:25] the
[1:43:26] word because the word what is your
[1:43:28] absolute
[1:43:30] yes this this power is not your absolute
[1:43:33] but it is your absolute as long as it
[1:43:35] don't disagree with the word you better
[1:43:37] obey it because God's told you if you
[1:43:39] don't you're disobeying
[1:43:44] me all right I know I I told you it's
[1:43:47] could to be a little straight I didn't
[1:43:49] tell you but I'm telling you now all
[1:43:51] right
[1:43:53] so he's a minister of God a Revenger to
[1:43:56] execute wrath upon him that doeth evil
[1:43:59] wherefore you must needs to be subject
[1:44:02] not only for wrath but also for
[1:44:04] conscience
[1:44:07] sake for this cause for for this cause
[1:44:11] pay ye tribute also and they are God's
[1:44:14] ministers attending continually upon
[1:44:16] this very thing do you not believe God
[1:44:18] has so much full control that he knows
[1:44:21] what to put before you and give power
[1:44:23] over
[1:44:25] you what is our
[1:44:28] place do good render good well
[1:44:31] somebody's back there and say if I was
[1:44:32] you I would just do what I have a right
[1:44:34] to do why are you obeying
[1:44:39] that I wonder where the little fox is
[1:44:43] there be
[1:44:45] careful that we don't Rebel because of
[1:44:48] our own reasoning because of God Satan
[1:44:50] trying to use our reasoning right stay
[1:44:53] with the
[1:44:54] word stay with the word all
[1:44:59] right now watch he's just goes on here
[1:45:01] render therefore to all their
[1:45:04] dues tribute to whom tribute is due
[1:45:07] custom to whom custom Fear To whom fear
[1:45:11] honor to whom

[1:45:21] I got to read quick you listen
[1:45:24] fast okay 1 Peter
[1:45:28] 2
[1:45:32] 13 submit yourself to every ordinance of
[1:45:35] man for the Lord's sake whether it be
[1:45:38] the king as supreme or as unto Governors
[1:45:40] or unto them that are sent by him for
[1:45:42] the punishment of evildoers and for the
[1:45:44] praise of them that do well for so is it
[1:45:47] the will of God that in well-doing you
[1:45:48] may put to silence the ignorance of
[1:45:50] foolish men
[1:45:54] as free and not using your Liberty as a
[1:45:57] cloak of maliciousness but as a Servants
[1:45:59] of
[1:46:00] God honor all men love the Brotherhood
[1:46:03] fear God honor the
[1:46:07] king said if you speak if you speak evil
[1:46:11] of those that he put above you spoke
[1:46:12] evil of him be careful we don't speak
[1:46:15] evil of those that God put in
[1:46:19] Authority we may not like Trump we may
[1:46:22] not like Biden but be careful you don't
[1:46:24] speak
[1:46:25] evil we may not like the mayor we may
[1:46:28] not like the governor we may not like
[1:46:31] what they do who said we didn't say not
[1:46:33] said you didn't have to like it or
[1:46:35] dislike it but there's one thing you
[1:46:36] have to do obey God
[1:46:39] yes now if they make a suggestion okay I
[1:46:43] don't have to I can or I can't but when
[1:46:46] they say you've got to do
[1:46:50] it when they make a command or when they
[1:46:54] make a
[1:46:55] decree and say that everybody's got to
[1:46:57] do this and we're putting it under law
[1:47:00] you may disagree or agree but are you in
[1:47:03] agreement with the word right that's the
[1:47:06] line we've got that's where we told
[1:47:09] brother sister yeah because otherwise
[1:47:11] you're putting your own thinking to it
[1:47:14] right okay now let's just I'll by bypass
[1:47:18] here if I
[1:47:21] can you know even act even even
[1:47:25] Paul over in the book of Acts he the
[1:47:28] high priest commanded he was standing
[1:47:30] judgment before him and and the high
[1:47:32] priest commanded somebody to Smite Paul
[1:47:35] in the face and he and he's commanded
[1:47:37] him to do it and Paul said God smite
[1:47:40] thee thou whed
[1:47:43] wall this is where I said about speaking
[1:47:46] evil of your rulers he said God smite
[1:47:48] thee thou Whited wall you tell him to
[1:47:51] smite me contrary to the law and you say
[1:47:53] you obey the law and he and you told him
[1:47:55] this might be contrary to the
[1:47:58] law boy Paul Paul believed keeping the
[1:48:02] law too in fact his own words said us to
[1:48:04] do it see but then they said how ralst
[1:48:07] thou the high priest he said sir I'm
[1:48:08] sorry I didn't realize he was high
[1:48:11] priest because the Bible said not to
[1:48:13] speak evil of the governor of your
[1:48:16] people or those in authority over
[1:48:20] you see see see oh I feel like just
[1:48:24] telling him like it is what right does
[1:48:26] he have to do this and make me wear this
[1:48:28] and do that and this
[1:48:33] and he has every right as long as he
[1:48:35] doesn't leave the
[1:48:40] word oh my it's quiet in here all right
[1:48:45] that's all right you're

[1:51:17] taxes I owe were Caesars it was God's
[1:51:19] money but nevertheless he said God had a
[1:51:22] way and showed me a way to do it and he
[1:51:24] said nevertheless lest we offend them he
[1:51:26] took him right back to that scripture
[1:51:28] Matthew 17 lest we offend
[1:51:31] them we cause struggle we try to have

[1:52:27] five I left one of them for the
[1:52:28] afternoon you can only get six in the
[1:52:30] state of Kentucky that's the limit so
[1:52:32] this person said I got nine Christian
[1:52:34] boy said I got nine fine kid I said you
[1:52:36] done
[1:52:37] wrong you did wrong he said well I said
[1:52:41] I had five that morning saved the one
[1:52:43] the afternoon but I got the one squirrel

[1:52:57] country preaching to you boys and you
[1:52:59] people here the thing that's right I've
[1:53:01] got to live that example Christianity
[1:53:03] what you say it's what you live what you
[1:53:05] do it's an example you're the salt of
[1:53:07] the earth I said the law said Jesus said
[1:53:09] you give Caesar them things that belong
[1:53:11] to Caesar you break that speed law there
[1:53:14] what are you doing you're doing wrong

[1:53:49] more I said okay he said well the law is
[1:53:52] wrong I can't help how wrong it is it's
[1:53:55] wrong to break Jesus
[1:54:00] commandment if you don't give Caesar
[1:54:03] things that Caesar you did what Jesus
[1:54:04] told you not to do and transgression of
[1:54:06] the law is sin when you know to do right
[1:54:09] and do good to him that knoweth to do
[1:54:12] good and doeth it not is

[1:55:27] don't think anybody's here doesn't take
[1:55:30] it there are those that
[1:55:32] don't I say why not it's God's
[1:55:37] command if you love the Lord and you
[1:55:39] know he's in your heart it's an outward
[1:55:41] manifestation that you're a part of God
[1:55:43] you love God and you're a part of the
[1:55:44] body to take it any other wise with that
[1:55:47] word being in you you're taking it
[1:55:50] unworthily
[1:55:53] and if you don't take it it shows that
[1:55:55] you don't accept what God Said and if
[1:55:58] you do take it unworthily you bring
[1:56:00] damnation to yourself now go back into
[1:56:02] communion 1965 and see what he said

[1:56:07] Revelation to you that you're a part of
[1:56:09] him and you're I'm a part of you and
[1:56:11] you're a part of me and we take it
[1:56:13] together as a revelation of that in our
[1:56:15] hearts showing
[1:56:17] forth that we were went with him through

[1:56:32] say what about foot washing can and
[1:56:39] communion amen is that right what's the
[1:56:42] third one water baptism
[1:56:45] yeah and you're taking water baptism
[1:56:48] because the Revelation to you that
[1:56:49] Christ died for you and bore your
[1:56:51] infirmities on Calvary and your and your
[1:56:53] sin and you're showing to the world you
[1:56:55] believe that and willing to die with him
[1:56:57] and and and show resurrect with him is
[1:57:01] that
[1:57:02] right and it works
[1:57:05] righteousness you'll do that sincerely
[1:57:08] and see what same thing with communion
[1:57:10] I'm not going to go there I could say a
[1:57:12] lot I could read some quotes out of
[1:57:13] there but I'm not going to do it now
[1:57:15] we're told give Caesar what Caesar I'm
[1:57:17] closing
[1:57:23] and I've closed stand with me Hallelujah
[1:57:27] I can say a lot more there's a lot more
[1:57:29] to be said but you know what I think the
[1:57:31] message has got through I think so amen
[1:57:34] is that right I believe it's got
[1:57:36] through what are you going to do when
[1:57:38] the Bible said don't wear those pants
[1:57:39] what are you going to do when the Bible
[1:57:41] said don't cut your hair not brother
[1:57:43] Bram said not even a lock of
[1:57:47] it you cut it you might as well shave it
[1:57:50] off
[1:57:55] that's another one of his
[1:57:56] Commandments we could go a lot of his
[1:57:59] Commandments don't you let that fox come
[1:58:01] in and turn you away from those
[1:58:04] Commandments because you're afraid of
[1:58:05] what somebody's going to feel like and
[1:58:07] say you're wearing those ungodly clothes
[1:58:10] that draw men's attention to your frame
[1:58:14] and by doing so you're committing
[1:58:15] adultery because they're going to lust
[1:58:17] for you I don't care how much of the
[1:58:19] message you say you believe right amen
[1:58:21] that's that's the word of God now what
[1:58:23] are you going to do about
[1:58:28] it so tight like you're poured into them
[1:58:32] and they can't they see every shape you
[1:58:34] make I know I'm speaking very clear
[1:58:35] might as well speak clearer than trying
[1:58:37] to hide behind the
[1:58:40] wall that's
[1:58:43] right Holiness is more than just a
[1:58:46] saying Holiness is a life amen and it's
[1:58:50] not ungodly the Holiness of God is not
[1:58:53] ungodly you walk down this these aisles
