[44:13] once it was quite a ways back but I I
[44:17] still have those memories of that so uh
[44:20] we want to do that and also next Sunday
[44:22] we'll be a little bit busy because we
[44:25] are going to
[44:26] um share the ballots to reaffirm uh
[44:29] we're not voting as it were for offices
[44:32] but we're just giving the church the
[44:33] opportunity to cast a vote either for or
[44:36] against amen and um you know uh what we
[44:40] want what we're really doing brother
[44:42] Ivan and I have had this conversation
[44:45] and and it is what we want is to make
[44:47] sure that you as a church have your
[44:48] voice amen we don't want to just assume
[44:51] that we know everything that should be
[44:53] good for you but you as a church so
[44:56] we'll reaffirm those and I want to
[44:58] because I don't know how it will be for
[44:59] people it's not going to be a vote that
[45:02] is counted and answered right at that
[45:04] moment uh so uh if um you're not here
[45:08] for whatever reason uh you still have
[45:11] your vote amen so even if it comes
[45:14] together um and uh I say this jokingly
[45:17] please don't misunderstand me if you're
[45:19] going to kick me out just give me at
[45:20] least 30 days amen so you have 30 days
[45:24] to count the vote so and anyway amen and
[45:28] next Sunday we've got a little bit out
[45:30] of um timing but next Sunday we will
[45:34] have communion and foot washing at 5:00
[45:36] p.m. so kind of just a a busy schedule
[45:40] amen let's just stand as we'll go into
[45:42] the word today thank you brother Isaac
[45:44] brother Alex a amen and we'll we'll look
[45:48] at this um in the word today and I want
[45:51] to speak to
[45:52] you uh from uh the The Book of Mark the
[45:57] 12th chap:
[45:59] 13-17 on the subject of whose image do
[46:03] we bear amen and we will find as we look
[46:06] at this that uh every one of us Bears an
[46:10] image of some uh sort as some form you
[46:14] know I always found it interesting I
[46:16] don't say this derogatory but just very
[46:18] interesting to me that uh you will have
[46:22] grown men who in the midst of you might
[46:26] say identity crisis they'll go out and
[46:28] buy a jersey of a of a professional
[46:31] sports person and and um they wear that
[46:34] Jersey as though that somehow by wearing
[46:37] that Jersey they're identified with that
[46:40] individual and um it's there that you
[46:44] see the image and um I happen to have
[46:46] some friends that are my age that have
[46:49] all kinds of jerseys from all kinds of
[46:52] different teams and and one week they're
[46:54] a chief and the next week they're an
[46:58] Indian and uh so what you realize is in
[47:00] the natural there's an identity crisis
[47:03] they they don't really know what they
[47:04] are and their identity is what they put
[47:06] on and you might think that brother Paul
[47:09] is rambling but I I believe before the
[47:10] service is over you will catch the
[47:12] foundation that I'm trying to lay for
[47:14] you and so we want to be very cognizant
[47:19] of the image that we bear amen we can
[47:22] bear an image of indifference and some
[47:25] people just would think that's just the
[47:27] kind of person they are but my brother
[47:29] sister for us to Bear an image of
[47:31] indifference there has to be an
[47:33] influence of indifference somewhere and
[47:35] so as it is brother Isaac shared that
[47:38] about uh just a few people on fire for
[47:42] God versus all kinds of revivals now
[47:45] when you see somebody on fire for God
[47:47] and it shows my brother and sister
[47:49] there's been something that has been put
[47:52] that has influenced that image in their
[47:54] life that they could step out you say
[47:57] well I'm a quiet person my brother and
[47:59] sister we are not talking about our
[48:02] persons we're talking about the presence
[48:04] of Jesus Christ and so it's not just who
[48:07] we are in this flesh but it's who we are
[48:10] in Christ and so sometimes we have to
[48:12] just break down the barriers and Step
[48:14] Beyond the image that is trying to be
[48:17] placed upon you and we'll look at that
[48:20] my brother and sister in the day that
[48:22] we're living in amen Mark the 12th
[48:25] chapter verses 13-1
[48:28] 17 and they sent unto him certain of the
[48:31] Pharisees and of the herodians to catch
[48:34] him in his words and when they were come
[48:37] they say unto him Master we know that
[48:41] thou art true and carest for no man for
[48:44] thou regardest not the person of men but
[48:47] teachest the way of God in truth is it
[48:52] lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not
[48:55] not shall we give or shall we not give
[48:59] but he knowing their
[49:03] hypocrisy so in spite of all their
[49:06] cleverness they come to Jesus and their
[49:09] hypocrisy is
[49:12] plain said unto them why tempt ye
[49:17] me bring me a penny that I may see it
[49:21] and they brought it and he saith unto
[49:23] them who's is is this image and this
[49:27] subscription and they said unto him
[49:29] Caesars and Jesus answered and said unto
[49:32] them render to Caesar the things that
[49:34] are Caesars and to God the things that
[49:37] are gods and they Marvel at the
[49:42] word that's right right do you mind that
[49:45] I just changed that it because he was
[49:48] the word so they were marveling at a man
[49:51] that they still didn't believe cuz if
[49:53] they believed he was the Christ Christ
[49:56] they would had a different attitude
[49:58] they're looking at just a man amen now
[50:01] let me read that
[50:04] correctly Jesus answered and said unto
[50:06] them render to Caesar the things that
[50:08] are Caesars and to God the things that
[50:09] are gods and they marveled at him
[50:12] Heavenly Father we ask you to bless this
[50:15] time this morning as we come together as
[50:17] Sons and Daughters of God just Desiring
[50:20] father to be be pulled Closer to You
[50:24] Lord to magnetized by the word of God
[50:27] father and we just ask you to come and
[50:29] deal kindly with each and every heart
[50:31] Lord every need that is in this body
[50:34] father Lord there are no visitors here
[50:36] today are we are one family of God and
[50:39] Father we ask you now to speak and set
[50:42] everything aside bind every contrary
[50:44] Spirit every distraction in the name of
[50:47] Jesus Christ amen hallelujah God bless
[50:50] you you may be
[50:54] seated
[51:00] as we look at this my brother and sister
[51:03] we'll just take a glimpse at verse 13
[51:06] they sent unto him certain of the
[51:08] Pharisees and herodians to catch him in
[51:11] his words and they were faultfinders is
[51:14] all they were they actually had come
[51:15] into this church service just simply to
[51:18] find something they could criticize and
[51:21] I'm telling you this morning not that I
[51:23] believe there's any critics here but I'm
[51:25] telling you you can't go anywhere even
[51:27] amongst the very body of the Bride of
[51:29] Jesus Christ and you look and if you
[51:32] want to you will find something to
[51:35] criticize amen and that's the beauty of
[51:37] it because you see God is not making us
[51:40] perfect in our words in our intelligence
[51:42] and in our appearance and all of these
[51:44] things he making us perfect in the
[51:47] maturity of the word in our life amen
[51:50] because I tell you what you know uh I
[51:53] say this I'm not tossing j under the B
[51:55] but you know she she now usually if
[51:58] she's not going to be here which isn't
[52:00] often but you know she like lays out my
[52:02] clothes because one time quite a few
[52:04] years ago she went out of town and you
[52:07] know she must have watched the service
[52:08] online or something and she's like I
[52:10] can't believe you wore that with that
[52:13] and so you know my brother and sisters
[52:15] some of us just don't have any more
[52:19] sense well that's what they call it
[52:21] fashion
[52:22] sense but I'll tell you what we do have
[52:26] we have another sense that this world
[52:28] doesn't have and we recognize the
[52:31] clothing of the word of God how that God
[52:34] has come to wrap his word around you and
[52:38] I to bring us into a fellowship that the
[52:40] world says it's not necessary that the
[52:42] word says oh the God doesn't care about
[52:45] that anymore but God's revealed to this
[52:48] bride what God does care about and is
[52:50] clothing her with the word and it's not
[52:52] mismatched it's not out of place it's
[52:55] not not color blinding and whatever it
[52:57] might be my brother and sister it is the
[52:59] word of God it is the life that is in
[53:02] the word coming and matching the need
[53:04] that is in you and I can someone say
[53:06] thank you Lord amen because without that
[53:09] need we would just wander around and
[53:11] we'll touch on this so let me just move
[53:13] on Amen but they were there to to uh
[53:17] catch him in his words they were not
[53:19] trying to catch him amen they weren't
[53:22] trying to catch him a as the son of God
[53:25] as the Redeemer my brother and sister
[53:27] they were just trying to catch him in
[53:29] his words they were hoping that he would
[53:31] trap himself you know they were actually
[53:33] afraid of all of those around them
[53:36] because God had been dealing with these
[53:38] people and speaking in such a fashion so
[53:41] they have to be clever my brother and
[53:43] sister the day it comes that we have now
[53:45] somebody I had somebody tell me one time
[53:47] well brother Paul you maybe are just a
[53:49] little too transparent a little too this
[53:51] well I'll tell you what would you rather
[53:53] I be too transparent or would you rather
[53:55] I'd be a little
[53:58] clever I think I'll stick with
[54:00] transparent because I want to I just
[54:02] want to I just want it to be Christ amen
[54:04] I don't want it to be Paul I don't want
[54:06] it to be me thinking of a way to present
[54:09] it in such a fashion that people for
[54:11] years to come would say oh wasn't that
[54:14] such a lovely statement that's not what
[54:16] I care about my brother and sister I
[54:18] care about that we are clothed upon with
[54:20] the word of God with the very Life of
[54:22] Christ that not be what we are clothed
[54:24] upon amen and so it is here that we look
[54:27] this while they're trying to catch him
[54:29] in his words amen not trying to be
[54:32] caught of him amen we want to be caught
[54:35] of him amen if we'll turn in Philippians
[54:38] the thir chapter I want to just plow on
[54:40] this morning I realized as I was
[54:43] studying and finishing up my thought
[54:45] this morning that that I just have way
[54:47] too much here amen and anybody come to
[54:49] the grace smorgus board this this
[54:51] morning amen let's just keep going back
[54:53] to the table eat as much much as you
[54:55] want but don't push your table your
[54:57] chair back and leave okay just sit back
[54:59] and enjoy yourself now in Philippians uh
[55:03] the third chapter uh 11th verse we'll
[55:07] see uh here it is now if by any means I
[55:10] might attain into the resurrection of
[55:13] the Dead you know if we're going to
[55:15] attain my brother and sister that is
[55:17] interchangeable with achieve so if we're
[55:20] going to to uh come we we by any means I
[55:24] might achieve now when we say this we
[55:26] have to take it in the context of the
[55:28] word that was being brought because
[55:30] remember crawling in through the window
[55:33] is not
[55:34] achieving amen so we can't say well I
[55:36] made it into the marriage Feast because
[55:39] you see they will recognize that you
[55:41] have the dirt and the cobwebs of the
[55:43] window upon you and not the correct robe
[55:47] amen cuz you can't pass through the door
[55:49] God didn't just forget once you have
[55:51] come baptized with the Holy Ghost amen
[55:54] come into His his presence God does not
[55:56] forget to clothe you in righteousness
[55:59] amen you can't say but I've done all
[56:01] this people are today my brother and
[56:03] sister people look you in the face and
[56:05] say I have the Holy Ghost and you would
[56:08] look at that and I'm not judging by a
[56:10] man but you would say you know what
[56:11] something's missing and you hate to say
[56:14] this and it's a preacher's complex I
[56:16] think isn't it Brother David that we
[56:18] just kind of tend to look at things and
[56:20] say that doesn't line up with the word
[56:22] and if it doesn't line up with the word
[56:23] I'm sorry I don't really care or can't
[56:25] relate to what you're saying so if
[56:27] someone says I have the Holy Ghost
[56:29] they'd fight a buz saw you stop and say
[56:31] is that true now I'm not talking about
[56:33] us fighting the Flesh and sometimes the
[56:35] flesh getting carried away okay anybody
[56:38] know what I'm talking about there yeah
[56:41] yeah thank you for those that are H us
[56:42] this morning amen but look at this my
[56:45] brother and I'm not talking about that
[56:46] but I'm talking about a regular display
[56:49] of nature that it's easier to be mad
[56:51] than it is to be
[56:53] compassionate this is what I'm talking
[56:55] about God help us amen so you look at
[56:59] this and realize see that to be clothed
[57:01] on with the robe as we come into His
[57:05] presence correctly is a
[57:08] lifechanging experience amen it is
[57:11] obvious it becomes evident Something's
[57:13] Happened to this man or woman this boy
[57:16] or this girl amen but anyone can say
[57:18] I've been there millions can say I've
[57:21] been to the water and I've been baptized
[57:23] but it was not a lifechanging experience
[57:26] I hope I'm not going to preach too hard
[57:28] this morning amen but look at that they
[57:30] didn't come to be caught of him they
[57:33] come to catch him and that's not how it
[57:35] works amen so by any means I might
[57:38] attain it to the resurrection of the
[57:40] Dead not as though I had already
[57:43] attained either were already
[57:46] perfect these are pretty strong words
[57:48] when you break it down I wish we had
[57:50] time this morning maybe I should just
[57:51] scrunch this back and and just break
[57:53] this down but you see he's acknowledged
[57:56] that I know what I need and I know what
[57:59] God's offering but I don't always act on
[58:02] it I don't always have it on display I
[58:06] don't always move forward in that and so
[58:11] here is a great messenger
[58:13] preacher to the
[58:15] age saying I'm I'm not
[58:20] perfect I'm glad I got a prophet when I
[58:24] was struggling at a point in my
[58:26] life had a prophet that stood in the
[58:29] Pulpit one day and said there I was
[58:32] under all this pressure from the IRS and
[58:35] all of this stuff and the lawyers and
[58:37] this and that and the phone
[58:41] rings and the wife answers and says it's
[58:44] a
[58:45] lawyer he gets up out of a chair goes
[58:48] over walks out the door tell them I'm
[58:52] not
[58:53] here
[58:55] well come on Saints if his foot was over
[58:58] the
[58:59] threshold
[59:01] it's
[59:04] defendable but
[59:06] intent it was a
[59:08] lie how many times have we done that we
[59:11] have used the
[59:13] absolute harmonics of the fact to say
[59:17] yes there was more of me out the door
[59:19] than there was there I'm not
[59:22] home and defend it or how about when God
[59:26] can we get personal this
[59:28] morning I don't need your shoe size I'm
[59:30] not talking that personal but get
[59:33] personal how many times has God dealt
[59:35] with you and I and said you know what
[59:37] what you did there wasn't quite right
[59:39] you ought to apologize yes sir and if we
[59:42] would get up out of our chair right then
[59:44] and there either go to a telephone or go
[59:46] in person and brother Trevor I'd done
[59:49] you wrong and brother Trevor would be
[59:50] anointed and say brother Paul I didn't
[59:52] take it that way all is well but you
[59:54] know what I do I sit over here and I I
[59:57] justify it well really brother Trevor
[59:59] deserved that he deserved it me to try
[1:00:01] and tear his head off he deserved at me
[1:00:03] to this and this and this and this and a
[1:00:05] day goes by and a week goes by and a
[1:00:07] month goes by six months go by and the
[1:00:10] case doesn't get weaker it gets
[1:00:14] stronger that's why I I I had a a
[1:00:18] situation where somebody was saying why
[1:00:20] not talking about the church here but
[1:00:21] why do we take communion so often so you
[1:00:25] have to come face to face with
[1:00:29] yourself oh you thought it was just to
[1:00:31] satisfy the ordinance of the word no God
[1:00:34] knows you that's right God knows that
[1:00:36] sometimes he's going to twist your arm
[1:00:39] and bring you to a place I can't take
[1:00:42] communion without
[1:00:44] repenting oh I'm glad to see you guys
[1:00:46] are human like me that that's reassuring
[1:00:50] amen cuz it'd be terrible if I said that
[1:00:53] and realized I was the only one here
[1:00:54] that had
[1:00:55] that now look what God's doing here he's
[1:00:59] dealing with him now he says you know I
[1:01:01] don't count myself to uh count not
[1:01:04] myself to have apprehended but this
[1:01:06] thing one thing I do forgetting those
[1:01:08] things which are behind and reaching
[1:01:11] forth into those things that are before
[1:01:13] I press amen I don't casually stroll I
[1:01:17] don't just hope I make it I press to the
[1:01:19] mark for the prize of the High Calling
[1:01:21] of God in Christ Jesus so we're seeing
[1:01:24] here these uh Pharisees and herodians
[1:01:27] and all these critics they they're
[1:01:29] coming to trap Jesus what they don't
[1:01:31] realize is he knew their very thought
[1:01:34] and the intent of their heart as they
[1:01:36] stood there and he realized their heart
[1:01:39] is here as a Critic that's it they're
[1:01:41] not here to dig deeper in the word of
[1:01:44] God they're not here to to take a
[1:01:46] portion my brother and sister I tell you
[1:01:49] I have sat down at a table many times in
[1:01:52] foreign countries and looked at the food
[1:01:55] and I say this jokingly but somewhat
[1:01:57] serious and looked at the food and
[1:02:00] prayed literally Lord you send me here
[1:02:04] Lord please take me
[1:02:08] home and I ate it
[1:02:10] anyway and I can tell you my brother and
[1:02:13] sister God's faithful now if we are here
[1:02:16] in leod deia and God sent you and I here
[1:02:20] and we are living in a world that's got
[1:02:22] all kinds of things to satisfy the
[1:02:24] appetite my brother and sister God knows
[1:02:26] what you need to go back home he's not
[1:02:29] sent you here to fail to fall falter to
[1:02:33] be weak and tossed around he sent you
[1:02:36] here to be Victorious and strong and to
[1:02:39] be able to eat the meat of the word and
[1:02:41] to Rise Up from that and when Leo deia
[1:02:44] throws something before you I was just
[1:02:46] doing some studying in this another
[1:02:48] subject I'll probably come to it in
[1:02:49] another sermon but the prophet of God
[1:02:52] talking about as it was with Samson my
[1:02:54] brother and sister God looks at you and
[1:02:56] I and all he's looking for from you and
[1:02:58] I is for us to rise up in the moment of
[1:03:01] our weakness and say Lord just one more
[1:03:04] time Lord forgive me just one more time
[1:03:08] come upon me and we say well that sounds
[1:03:11] hypocritical no it isn't if it comes
[1:03:12] from the heart when it comes out of the
[1:03:15] heart God looks down says that's my son
[1:03:17] that's my daughter they're heart they
[1:03:20] may have fallen they may have struggled
[1:03:22] they may have got something on the h
[1:03:24] their garment but they're coming back
[1:03:26] and asking Lord forgive me I wasn't who
[1:03:29] I am it's not who I want to be nor will
[1:03:32] it be who I am when I
[1:03:34] finish
[1:03:36] amen so yeah we're not
[1:03:39] perfect but there's something in the
[1:03:41] heart that keeps pressing on oh we won't
[1:03:45] get that personal but I'll tell you my
[1:03:46] brother and sister when the prophet of
[1:03:48] God said we backslide daily he was
[1:03:49] preaching at
[1:03:52] me come on yeah come on he was preaching
[1:03:56] to me no I didn't rob a
[1:03:58] bank no I didn't go out and kill
[1:04:01] somebody I thought about
[1:04:02] it but you understand what I'm saying
[1:04:06] it's little things sometimes that God
[1:04:08] just deals with us why because he's
[1:04:11] bringing us into maturity Perfection
[1:04:14] amen he isn't taking it and putting us
[1:04:16] in some kind of machine that just
[1:04:18] smashes the draw out of us my brother
[1:04:20] and sister what is he doing he's rolling
[1:04:22] us I hope you follow this he's rolling
[1:04:24] us over and pounding on us rolling us
[1:04:27] over and pounding on us I tell you it'd
[1:04:30] almost be better if he just had a
[1:04:31] machine that just squish it all out at
[1:04:33] once but that's not how it works God is
[1:04:36] pounding the dross out of you and I can
[1:04:38] someone say thank you Lord amen I tell
[1:04:42] you I don't like being pounded on but I
[1:04:44] don't like the draw
[1:04:46] either in fact I dislike the draw more
[1:04:50] than I dislike the
[1:04:51] pounding and that's what keeps us coming
[1:04:53] back back to the word amen now let me
[1:04:57] get moving along
[1:04:59] here now I want you just to catch
[1:05:02] sometimes how these little things hidden
[1:05:05] in the word Little Gems that are hidden
[1:05:07] in the word that come in such a fashion
[1:05:10] worded in such a
[1:05:13] fashion like let me put it this
[1:05:16] way the devil being so
[1:05:19] subtle would
[1:05:22] come because he can't prove that your
[1:05:24] name's not in the
[1:05:27] book so he just accuses you of not
[1:05:30] living the life of someone whose name
[1:05:33] would be in the
[1:05:35] book he's got no access to the book
[1:05:39] Saints so what does he do he just comes
[1:05:41] and accuses you ah you can't be the
[1:05:44] bride you can't be the bride do this you
[1:05:48] that you did oh yeah yeah yeah yeah you
[1:05:51] can't be so he makes these accusations
[1:05:54] that causes us wait it's not even the
[1:05:58] devil my brother and sister he's just
[1:06:01] hovering like the little bird over our
[1:06:05] head trying to build the
[1:06:07] nest it's us I hope this doesn't offend
[1:06:11] you that are too
[1:06:14] lazy to knock the nest off that's
[1:06:19] right
[1:06:23] wow
[1:06:25] and some of you thought it was just
[1:06:26] somebody's little feathery hat they were
[1:06:28] to
[1:06:29] church no sorry that was a devil trying
[1:06:32] to build a nest and whisper in their ear
[1:06:34] that you couldn't possibly be the bride
[1:06:36] of Christ You couldn't possibly
[1:06:39] be you see my brother and sister what
[1:06:42] God wants us to do is get enough unction
[1:06:44] I tell you what sister ulie I'm throwing
[1:06:47] you under the
[1:06:49] bus I don't know if it even has new
[1:06:51] melin tires on it or not sorry about
[1:06:54] this sister Julia she's like what did I
[1:07:04] do ah maybe I should sa this for after
[1:07:06] the
[1:07:07] vote no you know Jerry made some comment
[1:07:10] sister y about the trampoline being
[1:07:12] broken sister Yuli is like well you know
[1:07:14] why not and why don't you just go start
[1:07:16] fixing it so next thing I know the piece
[1:07:19] of the trampoline the wind blew our
[1:07:21] trampoline against the building and
[1:07:23] twisted it
[1:07:24] and so next thing I know the piece is
[1:07:26] out of the box and um the piece is no
[1:07:30] longer even in the garage the Box no
[1:07:32] longer exists and I look out and the
[1:07:34] piece is leaning against the trampoline
[1:07:37] and the Springs are taken off of the
[1:07:39] trampoline and I'm
[1:07:43] like okay I take the hint actually what
[1:07:47] I'm doing sister ulia is very backhanded
[1:07:49] saying thank
[1:07:51] you you know something I put put off for
[1:07:54] several weeks right now took sister
[1:07:55] Jerry and I a whole and 10 minutes
[1:07:57] to
[1:08:00] fix now I've left that you're probably
[1:08:02] wondering where I'm going I've left the
[1:08:05] thinking of
[1:08:07] repairing the trampoline on the back of
[1:08:10] my mind for
[1:08:13] weeks but I didn't have enough unction
[1:08:17] to do anything about
[1:08:20] it and now I'm throwing sister Yulia
[1:08:23] back under the bus
[1:08:25] until someone else
[1:08:26] says why doesn't your husband fix
[1:08:30] this and I found myself
[1:08:35] shamed
[1:08:37] disgraced
[1:08:40] blemished but being truthful
[1:08:43] recognize yes
[1:08:46] why now I'm not saying sister ulia is a
[1:08:49] woman
[1:08:51] preacher but sometimes we need someone
[1:08:55] to speak words that move us into
[1:09:00] action forgive me sister
[1:09:04] J we need
[1:09:07] someone now was some great
[1:09:10] orator come and walk through our
[1:09:13] backyard they have said one your grass
[1:09:15] is about a foot tall I thought I saw
[1:09:18] Bingle tiger your trampoline
[1:09:21] broken what's going on here
[1:09:25] well I tell you when the spirit of do
[1:09:27] the right thing get up and do it got on
[1:09:28] me we not only fixed a trampoline
[1:09:31] yesterday we mowed a lawn we weigh eated
[1:09:35] it cut out weeds we did all this stuff
[1:09:37] and you think brother Paul this is just
[1:09:38] a weird story you're bringing out I'm
[1:09:40] telling you that when God starts to work
[1:09:42] on you he doesn't just pick the least he
[1:09:46] starts in and he starts putting this in
[1:09:48] order and this in order and this in
[1:09:50] order and this in order and I want to
[1:09:53] say this morning Lord come and put me in
[1:09:55] order Lord come and deal with my life
[1:09:58] and Lord let me take the little things
[1:10:00] I've left undone that have been on my
[1:10:03] mind you realize if it's on your mind
[1:10:05] it's robbing your peace from you if you
[1:10:08] don't deal with it or the prophet says
[1:10:10] it more strongly if you know to do it
[1:10:13] and don't do it it's iniquity and we can
[1:10:16] carry iniquity with us so easily we get
[1:10:20] used to it we just get to the idea that
[1:10:23] we think everybody's walking around with
[1:10:25] a little iniquity and and it's just
[1:10:27] normal my brother and sister it might be
[1:10:29] normal for Leo to see you but it's not
[1:10:32] normal for the bride of Christ she's got
[1:10:34] the word what she needs is some function
[1:10:37] amen just a few people with a fire of
[1:10:40] God not 40 revivals just a few people
[1:10:43] that will say I'm going to read my Bible
[1:10:46] I'm going to pray I'm going to go to
[1:10:47] church hungry I'm going to take the word
[1:10:49] of God I'm going to pray for this
[1:10:51] brother pray for this sister I'm going
[1:10:53] to apply the word and come to work to
[1:10:56] church as a mighty warrior not as a
[1:10:58] beaten down person that don't even know
[1:11:00] if he's a son or daughter of God Amen
[1:11:04] you want a Victorious Church let's take
[1:11:06] and kick out the iniquity let's kick out
[1:11:09] those things that are binding and
[1:11:11] holding us back let's do what we know we
[1:11:14] should
[1:11:20] do
[1:11:22] Hallelujah now look at this they come
[1:11:25] verse 14 we'll go back and visit it here
[1:11:27] and they come and they say unto him
[1:11:29] Master they were lying right he was not
[1:11:31] their Master but they were telling the
[1:11:33] truth because he's the master of
[1:11:37] all we know that thou art true we can
[1:11:40] say
[1:11:41] Amen but the next part is very cleverly
[1:11:46] put and car us for no
[1:11:50] man I say that is not
[1:11:52] true my brother and sister he cares for
[1:11:55] mankind more than mankind cares for
[1:11:58] himself but they're presenting it
[1:12:00] because he didn't recognize their
[1:12:02] flowing gowns and their position and all
[1:12:04] of their little kind of like the
[1:12:06] military you know those guys at that
[1:12:08] time had certain little things that they
[1:12:09] wore and it showed their position their
[1:12:12] Rank and the prophet of God said that
[1:12:14] that nickan Spirit of denominationalism
[1:12:17] is when you place one man above another
[1:12:20] so here were these nicians coming
[1:12:23] because they had their position and it
[1:12:25] was definitely higher than that position
[1:12:28] or that position and they come to Jesus
[1:12:30] and they call him
[1:12:31] Master but they look down their nose at
[1:12:34] him he was not their Master they were
[1:12:37] their own master or Satan was amen and
[1:12:40] carest for no man for thou regardest not
[1:12:43] the person of men that was true but
[1:12:47] teach us the way of God in truth that's
[1:12:49] true amen so look how they're doing that
[1:12:52] they're using the words of
[1:12:54] flattery trying to get him built up do
[1:12:58] they want to build him up to keep him
[1:13:00] lifted up no my brother and sister they
[1:13:02] weren't lifting up amen our lord Jesus
[1:13:05] they were lifting him up so when they
[1:13:06] knocked him down he had farther to fall
[1:13:09] that they could make it do but I tell
[1:13:11] you my brother and sister I don't say
[1:13:13] this just because I'm a pastor but I say
[1:13:15] this that every one of us should be this
[1:13:17] way there is no greater care for
[1:13:19] Humanity than the care for the soul amen
[1:13:23] amen there's nothing that we can say I I
[1:13:25] would do so much for you brother I would
[1:13:27] do so much for you young people so much
[1:13:30] for you sister then do something that
[1:13:32] builds their soul up amen don't don't
[1:13:35] just you know like the parents you know
[1:13:38] I tell you it's a true story I went to
[1:13:40] school with a kid that his parents man
[1:13:42] back you know we're talking way back in
[1:13:44] the 70s you guys remember them
[1:13:49] days they give this kid 50 bucks a week
[1:13:51] for an allowance man he walked around
[1:13:54] the the school like he was goldplated
[1:13:57] cuz my my parents gave me an allowance I
[1:13:59] think it was like five bucks a
[1:14:01] year my dad used to say you live in this
[1:14:04] household you're part of this household
[1:14:06] you work for this
[1:14:07] household and I thought that was
[1:14:11] normal but it's there my brother and
[1:14:13] sister when this kid went to
[1:14:16] college he never had to work never had
[1:14:19] to do nothing daddy daddy sent a check
[1:14:20] to the college daddy paid for food dadd
[1:14:23] he paid for a car he got out of
[1:14:27] college and he got married really nice
[1:14:30] girl girl with a lot of
[1:14:33] character he was so
[1:14:35] pampered that when he decided he'd
[1:14:37] rather just sit home and mess
[1:14:39] around he just push his wife go get a
[1:14:42] better job go get a better job just
[1:14:45] bring me the money a better job you know
[1:14:50] his parents ruined
[1:14:52] him
[1:14:54] and because of that behavior his life
[1:14:56] ended quite
[1:15:01] short kids I just want you to know my
[1:15:05] son called me the other
[1:15:06] day and he told
[1:15:09] me when I was growing up interesting way
[1:15:12] to hear a conversation when I was
[1:15:14] growing
[1:15:16] up my dad treated me like I was a
[1:15:20] machine and just told me I don't care
[1:15:23] what you think go out there and do
[1:15:25] it I'm thinking wow where's this
[1:15:30] going and I just called today
[1:15:34] dad you
[1:15:36] called to say thank
[1:15:42] you if God pampered you and
[1:15:46] I what kind of Christian would we
[1:15:51] be we wouldn't be that's actually in
[1:15:53] name only right a Chino that's a
[1:15:56] Christian in name only
[1:15:59] amen so you know when you fight for it
[1:16:03] do you know when my parents sorry to go
[1:16:06] into this but I want to make a point
[1:16:08] when I was a young
[1:16:09] man my dad said you know so and so was
[1:16:12] in town the other night said they saw
[1:16:14] you peeling the tires off your
[1:16:18] pickup yeah it's true
[1:16:20] dad he's like
[1:16:24] I'm sure
[1:16:25] glad you have to pay for all of that
[1:16:29] yeah I've been having so much
[1:16:37] fun if none of you ever been no I better
[1:16:41] not do that some of your kids
[1:16:43] would back on
[1:16:45] track I just want you to realize I could
[1:16:48] found different way to express that you
[1:16:50] see God cares for the soul more than he
[1:16:52] cares for anything
[1:16:53] thing so they're saying you don't you
[1:16:55] don't regard man or Humanity you don't
[1:16:58] regard nothing but he regarded the soul
[1:17:01] amen I'm sorry I got sidetracked there
[1:17:04] amen so that you see what it is that
[1:17:07] what is true care of the
[1:17:10] Soul can I make you eat it can I make
[1:17:13] you read it can I make you pray over it
[1:17:16] no I
[1:17:17] can't I'm not nickan and we're not just
[1:17:20] followers we're Christians
[1:17:24] so brother David's job my job brother
[1:17:26] Chris is not here but our
[1:17:28] job
[1:17:29] amen when we study the resume of the
[1:17:32] ages here in the next few weeks you'll
[1:17:34] see right in the resume of the ages that
[1:17:36] brother brandham indicts them Ministry
[1:17:38] for taking the Sheep into a pasture that
[1:17:42] there is no food
[1:17:46] in is that care for the
[1:17:49] soul see I might not have the best words
[1:17:51] I might not lay it out so well might not
[1:17:53] have flowing things to put to you but I
[1:17:55] tell you what I want to do I want to
[1:17:56] take you into a pasture that the grass
[1:17:59] is above your head that everything you
[1:18:02] need to be healthy is right there and if
[1:18:05] it does that the word says that he says
[1:18:07] I'm a good minister of the gospel and I
[1:18:09] want to be a good minister of the Gospel
[1:18:11] so they were looking for great flowing
[1:18:13] words and they were looking for all
[1:18:15] these outward signs just as it is today
[1:18:17] a nice house a nice car oh our church
[1:18:20] and we're blessed my brother and sister
[1:18:22] they're going straight too and it's
[1:18:24] there that they don't even recognize it
[1:18:26] because their wallet's full but God says
[1:18:28] what it is is when I take my sheep into
[1:18:31] Shady Green Pastures amen and they can
[1:18:35] lay down by the streams of flowing water
[1:18:38] and they can be comfortable there no
[1:18:40] stress and strain of am I deceived is
[1:18:43] this truth is this this is a wolf coming
[1:18:45] is a Kyo coming is a bear coming they
[1:18:48] can lay down why because the word is
[1:18:50] what is surrounding them not the
[1:18:52] preacher not the the church not mankind
[1:18:54] not man's thoughts but it's a presence
[1:18:56] of God himself and they were there
[1:18:59] strange enough to be able to say we know
[1:19:02] you don't care for man see how far they
[1:19:05] missed the mark see how far that they
[1:19:07] were off they were the ones offering all
[1:19:10] of the embellishment and all of the
[1:19:12] stuff and all of position and they
[1:19:15] accused Jesus of the one that didn't
[1:19:19] care clever old devil isn't he
[1:19:23] mhm
[1:19:25] amen so they're asking a simple thing do
[1:19:29] we give or don't give and Jesus answers
[1:19:32] the question to them and he says you
[1:19:35] know uh whose image or superscription
[1:19:38] that's upon this and they s un him
[1:19:40] Caesars and he says render to Caesar the
[1:19:43] things that are
[1:19:47] Caesars I know message
[1:19:50] men that do everything they can Shifty
[1:19:53] Shady everything not to pay a tax yes
[1:20:00] sir I'd like you to reconcile
[1:20:04] this you see we're not here to defraud
[1:20:08] the government Jesus said you give to
[1:20:09] Caesar what is
[1:20:12] Caesars but you make sure you give to
[1:20:15] God that's right what is God's and when
[1:20:19] we catch that Revelation my brother and
[1:20:20] sister I tell you I'm a businessman I'm
[1:20:22] not overly proud to make a boast of that
[1:20:24] but I'll tell you if you will follow the
[1:20:28] word you will have more money than you
[1:20:31] would if you try to work it under the
[1:20:33] table I'll tell you I've been on both
[1:20:36] sides of this equation I I can speak
[1:20:38] from truth and I can give you just the
[1:20:40] exact right down to the uh asphalt of
[1:20:44] how it works my brother and sister but
[1:20:46] you start to follow what you should do
[1:20:49] and obey the word of God and give to
[1:20:52] Caesars what is Caesars and God will
[1:20:55] fill up those Pockets that had holes in
[1:20:58] them he'll sew them up and he'll fill
[1:21:01] them up amen but as long as we're going
[1:21:03] on our own reasoning we're going in our
[1:21:06] own little idea if they don't know what
[1:21:09] they don't know won't audit
[1:21:13] me God's the one that's the auditor you
[1:21:15] ought to be concerned about not the
[1:21:17] Internal Revenue Service which there's
[1:21:20] no service attached to the internal
[1:21:22] Revenue amen it's a the internal revenue
[1:21:28] takers yeah cuz we don't need their
[1:21:32] service but let me put it this
[1:21:34] way if you've ever been in a
[1:21:38] situation you're pretty happy the fire
[1:21:41] department comes aren't you you're
[1:21:43] pretty happy that the wheels don't get
[1:21:45] tore off of your car like the potholes
[1:21:48] they have in
[1:21:49] Arkansas yeah I've seen them swallow
[1:21:52] trucks
[1:21:54] hey
[1:21:56] happy there's a price that comes with
[1:22:00] that some of you aren't liking
[1:22:04] this Brothers list start an internal
[1:22:09] investigation we could act like the LDS
[1:22:12] and ask you to all submit your tax
[1:22:19] returns I tell you what you talk about
[1:22:21] devoted I don't know why I'm off track
[1:22:23] you talk about devoted they submit their
[1:22:25] tax returns and pay what the church
[1:22:27] tells them they ought to pay and they're
[1:22:28] just thrilled to be part of that you get
[1:22:30] around the message and you mention tithe
[1:22:32] or offering or whatever and people get
[1:22:33] all weird and if you're going to preach
[1:22:35] that we're not going to church here H
[1:22:39] that's kind of weird isn't
[1:22:41] it
[1:22:42] okay praise the Lord somebody start
[1:22:46] praying he'll move
[1:22:49] on so in 2 Corinthians 3:1
[1:22:55] Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves
[1:22:59] or need we as some others Epistles of
[1:23:01] commendation to you and letters of
[1:23:03] recommendation from you ye are our
[1:23:06] epistle written in our hearts and known
[1:23:08] or read of all men for as much as ye are
[1:23:11] manifestly declared to be the Epistle of
[1:23:13] Christ ministered by US Written not with
[1:23:15] ink but with the spirit of the Living
[1:23:18] God not in tables of stone but in the
[1:23:20] fleshly tables of the heart now as we
[1:23:23] look at this scripture my brother and
[1:23:24] sister we'll re recognize this that in
[1:23:28] giving we have to come to a place that
[1:23:30] we actually submit what God has done and
[1:23:34] we are now confessing that he has
[1:23:37] written on us can we can we just maybe
[1:23:40] be bold enough to lift a hand and say he
[1:23:42] wrote on me amen he wrote on me amen I I
[1:23:45] didn't read it somewhere he wrote it see
[1:23:49] it's one thing to know that it was said
[1:23:51] it's another to know it was said to you
[1:23:53] amen and when he makes it real to you so
[1:23:56] here we are as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:23:58] we're not taking as it were the church's
[1:24:01] opinion or man's opinion but God has
[1:24:05] written on the fleshly tables of our
[1:24:08] hearts now my brother and sister what is
[1:24:11] written there I want to tie this back
[1:24:14] with this inscription on the penny
[1:24:16] here's a picture of Caesar and he's
[1:24:19] telling them you give to Caesar what is
[1:24:22] Caesars now here is you and I in this
[1:24:27] 2023 as Sons and Daughters of God with
[1:24:30] something that has been
[1:24:33] superimposed and written inscripted upon
[1:24:36] you and I and what is that well I'll
[1:24:38] tell you what my brother and sister you
[1:24:40] can go around in the world as I started
[1:24:42] this off you can see the guy that's
[1:24:44] sports-minded everything about the decor
[1:24:46] of his life is something about sports
[1:24:49] and you can see the man who is all about
[1:24:51] business everything that he does is all
[1:24:53] about I got a new idea to make more
[1:24:55] money and you go over here and you got
[1:24:57] somebody that's into music and
[1:24:59] everything in his line might be good
[1:25:01] music but it's about music and you go
[1:25:03] over here it's all about this and it's
[1:25:05] all about that well where is the
[1:25:07] Christian in this whole equation there
[1:25:10] should be something that is marking the
[1:25:13] Christian that when the world looks at
[1:25:15] him they can say I see the uh the spirit
[1:25:18] of Le oysa imposed upon this one I see
[1:25:21] this spirit imposed upon this one I see
[1:25:24] this period imposed upon this one and
[1:25:26] who are these people they're different
[1:25:28] there's something about them that has
[1:25:30] been marked upon them that shows that
[1:25:33] they are and as that sister was there in
[1:25:36] a store I think we shared that story
[1:25:38] she's in a store and some woman walks up
[1:25:40] to her and says you know you don't have
[1:25:42] to live this life God doesn't require
[1:25:45] this all of these things you don't have
[1:25:47] to submit yourself to that and still be
[1:25:50] a Christian and God give that sister the
[1:25:52] right words and she says how do you know
[1:25:54] I'm a
[1:25:56] Christian
[1:25:57] because of the inscription that's that
[1:26:00] was upon
[1:26:02] her now this other person this other
[1:26:05] individual is opposed to
[1:26:08] that imagine my brother and sister whose
[1:26:11] face is on $100 bill any of you seen one
[1:26:14] of those
[1:26:17] lately is it Ben
[1:26:20] Franklin what if you is to stand day and
[1:26:22] say I refuse to touch any money that's
[1:26:24] got Ben Franklin's picture on
[1:26:27] it why I don't like
[1:26:30] Ben I'd be right behind you saying I
[1:26:33] love
[1:26:35] Ben now I'm not talking about that kind
[1:26:37] of love but if I got a choice between a
[1:26:40] five and
[1:26:42] 100 you follow me now my brother and
[1:26:46] sister the world's got a choice but
[1:26:48] they're finding it easier to have
[1:26:51] Caesar's picture
[1:26:52] than Christ they're seeking out Caesar's
[1:26:57] picture not
[1:26:59] Christ and Paul declaring I Paul a
[1:27:04] prisoner of Jesus Christ you know what
[1:27:06] it is to be a prisoner you have given up
[1:27:09] all control of your own
[1:27:12] life and that's why they don't like him
[1:27:15] that's why they don't want Jesus Christ
[1:27:19] inscripted on them it's because they
[1:27:22] want to have their own life they just
[1:27:25] give me your name just give me your
[1:27:29] name see the
[1:27:32] superscription is something written or
[1:27:34] engraved on the surface of outside or
[1:27:37] above something else an inscription an
[1:27:42] address well you know what I'm glad my
[1:27:45] brother and sister that this
[1:27:46] subscription amen has been imposed upon
[1:27:49] me because you know what I'm I'm I I I
[1:27:52] say this to myself but I say it to you
[1:27:54] do you know I'm walking around with an
[1:27:55] address on me you're walking around with
[1:27:58] an address on you amen and it's marked
[1:28:01] in the very Behavior it's marked in such
[1:28:03] a fashion you know you you sometimes we
[1:28:06] get the neighbor mail amen you know the
[1:28:09] mail lady might you know just be
[1:28:11] grabbing letters and there's one there
[1:28:12] and ends up in our mailbox now my
[1:28:15] brother and sister we don't have to do
[1:28:16] anything I don't have to lick another
[1:28:18] stamp and put it on there I don't have
[1:28:20] to do anything we just put it back in
[1:28:21] the
[1:28:22] mailbox and it gets delivered to who it
[1:28:24] belongs
[1:28:28] to I don't have to go around this world
[1:28:32] and tell everybody I'm a Christian I'm a
[1:28:35] Christian I'm a Christian the address is
[1:28:39] written on
[1:28:42] me had a visitor in our farm
[1:28:45] shop that would have been Friday start
[1:28:48] to use some
[1:28:50] language and a minute it come out of out
[1:28:52] of their mouth they turned and looked at
[1:28:53] me and said I'm so
[1:28:54] sorry why because they're reading a
[1:28:56] different address than theirs they're
[1:28:59] reading a different writing and they
[1:29:01] recognize this is
[1:29:04] different this is different it doesn't
[1:29:07] make us
[1:29:08] weird it makes us
[1:29:10] his because we've been marked with an
[1:29:12] address that's sending us where we were
[1:29:15] called to
[1:29:17] go
[1:29:19] hallelujah amen I can see I might have
[1:29:21] to chop listen to because we're just not
[1:29:23] making much progress here and it's my
[1:29:25] fault amen so in 2 Corinthians the 3rd
[1:29:28] chapter:
[1:29:30] 1-5 uh we we don't want to commend
[1:29:33] ourselves or as some ACC commendations
[1:29:36] my brother and sister you see it's as
[1:29:38] much as we declared the Epistle of
[1:29:40] Christ ministered by US Written not with
[1:29:42] ink but the spirit of the living good
[1:29:45] not on the table of stone but in the
[1:29:47] fleshly table of the heart and this is
[1:29:49] God working on you and I and as we go
[1:29:52] down we won't read it all you can see it
[1:29:53] right there uh not that we are
[1:29:55] sufficient of ourselves to think
[1:29:57] anything as of ourselves but our
[1:29:59] sufficiency is of God so my brother and
[1:30:01] sister we are not sufficient to write on
[1:30:03] our own heart God God didn't say now you
[1:30:06] just write on your heart how you feel my
[1:30:08] brother and sister this whole feeling
[1:30:10] thing that has taken over the world has
[1:30:12] destroyed more people more marriages
[1:30:14] more families more children because
[1:30:16] we're into such a I feel well I'll tell
[1:30:20] you what my brother and sister I've had
[1:30:21] people come to me after a preaching of a
[1:30:23] service right here in this church and
[1:30:25] meet me at the back of the church and I
[1:30:27] read scripture and I read quotes and the
[1:30:30] quotes wasn't a singular quote it was
[1:30:32] quotes that are through the message and
[1:30:34] they look at me in the face and say I
[1:30:38] feel and I'm sorry this sounds rude
[1:30:40] maybe I didn't approach it right but the
[1:30:42] minute they said I feel I just dismissed
[1:30:44] whatever their argument was cuz I'm not
[1:30:47] really caring I love each and every one
[1:30:49] of you and I think you know
[1:30:50] that I fail if you
[1:30:53] don't but I'm not really caring about
[1:30:56] your
[1:30:59] feelings come on
[1:31:02] Amen come
[1:31:05] on when did our Fe that's
[1:31:12] right I know this sounds harsh oh I just
[1:31:15] felt the presence of God in the service
[1:31:17] today and they go right out exactly like
[1:31:19] they walked in that's right and the
[1:31:22] prophet of God taught us the word
[1:31:24] teaches us that you cannot walk out the
[1:31:28] same as you walked in you will either be
[1:31:30] better or you will be worse and yet they
[1:31:33] say I felt the presence of God well you
[1:31:35] might have but that's all you did is
[1:31:37] felt it it never it never got a hold of
[1:31:41] you you might have got a hold of it but
[1:31:44] it never got a hold of
[1:31:46] you well this ain't at all what I
[1:31:48] thought I was preaching to you Saints
[1:31:50] praise the Lord now this will throw some
[1:31:53] of you for a loop but just please hang
[1:31:57] on I want to put it in such a fashion
[1:32:00] that you don't misunderstand
[1:32:02] me say it in this way
[1:32:05] Paul that you might say that there's two
[1:32:08] tables in every person this is not two
[1:32:11] Soul Doctrine this is not the duplicity
[1:32:14] of souls T but you see we're looking
[1:32:19] here at the flesh man
[1:32:22] that's right and we're looking at the
[1:32:24] Spirit man right and the scripture
[1:32:27] teaches us that they're Waring that's
[1:32:31] right hey how many of you guys met the
[1:32:34] black dog this last week yes
[1:32:39] sir
[1:32:40] yeah you might put it this way he howled
[1:32:44] outside my window this
[1:32:49] week but you know who else I met this
[1:32:51] week
[1:32:53] yes sir the white dog amen and the white
[1:32:56] dog come as it were figuratively here
[1:32:59] laid down at my feet laid his head on my
[1:33:02] lap wrapped his tail around my ankle and
[1:33:06] loved
[1:33:07] me now one that's
[1:33:09] howling and one that's
[1:33:12] loving that might describe human nature
[1:33:14] isn't it and we can be that same way
[1:33:17] within about five
[1:33:20] minutes
[1:33:23] reminds me of a little Story Once little
[1:33:25] boy is with his dad going up
[1:33:28] town and they went to stores and
[1:33:31] whatever in the car and they're driving
[1:33:33] home the little boy says Dad can I ask
[1:33:35] you a question sure
[1:33:37] son why are you nice to everyone but
[1:33:42] us pretty
[1:33:44] blunt but see there's the warfare that's
[1:33:47] right there's the Warfare going on might
[1:33:50] not even realize that that that's the
[1:33:52] image that's projected so there's these
[1:33:55] two tables in every person and the flesh
[1:33:58] amen impressed upon by the natural and
[1:34:01] what I'm saying is this flesh and not
[1:34:03] all negative but say that your your dad
[1:34:06] was a handyman or a mechanic or a
[1:34:08] plumber or whatever now if that child
[1:34:10] pays attention he'll know how to wire a
[1:34:13] house he'll know how to fix the plumbing
[1:34:15] he'll know how to tune up a car and this
[1:34:17] is all just pressed upon him now it
[1:34:20] isn't necessarily that it would be son
[1:34:22] you have to learn this but he learned it
[1:34:25] because it was there and he was part of
[1:34:27] what was happening and it was in that
[1:34:30] that he started to see you know what oh
[1:34:32] that's how you change oil my goodness my
[1:34:34] brother and sister there was a a man in
[1:34:36] Colorado here a while back almost when
[1:34:38] the weather was still bad almost got run
[1:34:40] over by a semi on the highway because he
[1:34:43] got a flat tire stopped right in the
[1:34:45] middle of the road dug all of his
[1:34:47] suitcases out of the trunk and was
[1:34:48] trying to find the spare tire because he
[1:34:51] knew it had to be
[1:34:53] there he was 47 years
[1:34:55] old his daddy obviously did not teach
[1:34:58] him much of
[1:35:04] anything but another one would say
[1:35:06] common sense says get off the road and
[1:35:09] common sense says if the tire is not
[1:35:11] under the car it's in the
[1:35:16] car how did they learn
[1:35:18] that it was written on the table Able by
[1:35:23] natural
[1:35:24] life statistically
[1:35:27] Saints those families that are raised up
[1:35:31] in an
[1:35:32] atmosphere of
[1:35:36] Christ have more children who go on to
[1:35:40] raise their family in the atmosphere of
[1:35:45] Christ those that raise them up in the
[1:35:47] atmosphere of the horse trck or the ball
[1:35:50] field or the bar
[1:35:53] scene it
[1:35:55] produces everything they laid upon that
[1:35:59] heart but Les we get worried about this
[1:36:01] you will see that when Christ comes and
[1:36:04] he starts writing on the table of the
[1:36:08] heart amen everything that Daddy wrote
[1:36:10] on there everything that Mama wrote on
[1:36:12] there everything that LE oaia wrote on
[1:36:14] there gets wrote
[1:36:18] over and it breaks a cycle I got a good
[1:36:21] friend in South Africa lovely brother
[1:36:24] only one in his family that's a Believer
[1:36:27] well his wife and children but only one
[1:36:30] rest of his family and he said brother
[1:36:32] Paul I sometimes don't understand and I
[1:36:35] said all I know brother is whatever had
[1:36:37] been written on there was written over
[1:36:41] by something else and that's what
[1:36:44] matters because God writing on the
[1:36:47] fleshly table of the heart the word of
[1:36:51] the the hour of predestination of the
[1:36:54] Holy Ghost Revelation riding over it
[1:36:57] riding over it until it's no longer
[1:37:00] there now look my brother and sister see
[1:37:03] we can't ride on our own Hearts amen but
[1:37:06] look at this now the shared wisdom of
[1:37:08] man I'm very thankful for that my daddy
[1:37:11] taught me how to do a lot of things I
[1:37:13] can I can Plum a house I can wire a
[1:37:16] house I can roof a house I can frame a
[1:37:18] house my concrete work leaves a little
[1:37:20] bit to be desired but I'm thankful for
[1:37:23] my daddy but what I'm thankful most is
[1:37:25] when my dad heard the message that my
[1:37:28] dad said son this is the way you ought
[1:37:32] to go right here this is what you need
[1:37:34] to learn this is what you need to focus
[1:37:36] on this is what you need to make a
[1:37:38] priority and all the rest of that my
[1:37:41] brother and sister I'm thankful for but
[1:37:43] I'm thankful for Godly Parents more than
[1:37:45] I'm thankful for anything else in this
[1:37:47] world and I'm thankful that there was
[1:37:50] men in my life that would look me in the
[1:37:52] face and say Paul you can do better than
[1:37:54] you're doing rise up a little higher
[1:37:57] come up a little higher you see my
[1:37:59] brother and sister this is what God is
[1:38:02] do he's changing the image of what has
[1:38:05] been imposed upon us he's changing that
[1:38:08] image so that we bear another image oh
[1:38:12] you people say it's a message it's a
[1:38:13] message well I'm not going to argue with
[1:38:15] you but I'll tell you the message is
[1:38:18] Jesus Christ what's been imposed upon us
[1:38:21] now is Jesus Christ himself and that is
[1:38:25] why when you walk out and you walk down
[1:38:27] the road and you think man where did
[1:38:29] that thought come I'm talking positive
[1:38:31] where did that thought come from God
[1:38:33] dealing with you oh I'm thinking about
[1:38:35] this brother or this sister God dealing
[1:38:37] with you why are you thinking about them
[1:38:39] to raise them on your thoughts and
[1:38:41] dismiss them or maybe God wants you to
[1:38:43] stop and pray for them or maybe even
[1:38:46] stop and knock on their door God wants
[1:38:48] you to be part of his program because
[1:38:51] he's taking this word and pressing it as
[1:38:54] His
[1:38:57] Image oh my brother and sister I'm not
[1:39:00] expressing it as well as I'd like to
[1:39:01] this morning but I'm telling you God
[1:39:04] will superimpose every natural thing
[1:39:07] that was imposed on you and everything
[1:39:10] that's outside of the word imposed on
[1:39:12] you and he will come and impose his word
[1:39:15] and press it into you that you then bear
[1:39:18] the mark as that Penny had Caesar on it
[1:39:22] may the Bride of Jesus Christ have
[1:39:24] nothing other than Jesus Christ amen may
[1:39:28] they look at us and see not some kind of
[1:39:30] offshoot or some kind of this let them
[1:39:33] see Christ let them see the word living
[1:39:36] in this day now whether they choose to
[1:39:39] embrace that or not is up to them that's
[1:39:41] right I'm going to cut out a whole bunch
[1:39:43] of this if you don't mind amen you see
[1:39:47] whatever has been written in 2
[1:39:50] Corinthians 3:7 17 and 18 He says now
[1:39:52] the Lord is that Spirit where the spirit
[1:39:54] of the Lord is there is Liberty we ought
[1:39:57] to be having Liberty in the house of God
[1:40:00] Amen we ought to be able to walk in here
[1:40:02] and take every issue in your life and
[1:40:05] set it down and say that's not who I am
[1:40:09] I'm a Son of God and walk right in and
[1:40:12] rejoice lift our voices to praise him
[1:40:15] and thank him because I tell you
[1:40:17] whatever has been imposed upon the flesh
[1:40:19] might stay upon the flesh
[1:40:22] yeah right yeah it might
[1:40:26] be met a brother one time he's
[1:40:29] blind preached at their church he come
[1:40:31] up to me he says brother Paul why was I
[1:40:34] born
[1:40:35] blind and it just come out of me I
[1:40:37] didn't have time to think about it
[1:40:39] because God Saves blind people and
[1:40:42] you're living proof he starts
[1:40:46] weeping that's
[1:40:49] right God God wasn't punishing me
[1:40:53] sir God's using me for an example that
[1:40:56] blind people can receive the word of God
[1:40:57] receive the Holy Ghost and serve
[1:41:01] him oh I tell you what that brother
[1:41:03] Chile down there that brother changed
[1:41:05] his whole attitude he went around
[1:41:07] forever and ever amen that's that little
[1:41:09] boy that was in St Carlos baroi amen was
[1:41:13] becoming increasingly angry at
[1:41:17] God he wasn't blind I'm sorry deaf
[1:41:21] he was deaf Lord just brought my memory
[1:41:24] back he was deaf CU he had a little
[1:41:27] friend that come up when he come up
[1:41:29] there for prayer come up to talk to me
[1:41:32] his little friend bold just come right
[1:41:34] up there
[1:41:35] too he said I'm his
[1:41:42] voice yeah that's it yeah and I'm
[1:41:46] telling you God bless him he's sitting
[1:41:47] right there with hands moving so fast
[1:41:49] I'm like this looks like and then little
[1:41:51] boy starts
[1:41:53] weeping just breaking
[1:41:55] down it's like
[1:41:58] yes God
[1:42:00] Saves deaf people
[1:42:03] too may we see who we are
[1:42:07] Saints what the world has imposed we're
[1:42:10] tall we're short we're big and
[1:42:14] little we're all these things none of
[1:42:17] that
[1:42:19] matters but what what's been written on
[1:42:22] the table of this heart is nothing short
[1:42:26] of Christ himself that's it that's right
[1:42:29] and he came to you and I and wrote his
[1:42:32] story on our life amen amen he didn't
[1:42:36] write it on everybody's life see what
[1:42:38] those people what all of them missed was
[1:42:41] the fact they should have been coming
[1:42:43] and saying there's something we see that
[1:42:46] was not written on our life and we need
[1:42:48] that we need that I need that written on
[1:42:51] my life that's the true approach to God
[1:42:53] not to come and say I'm going to
[1:42:55] criticize I'm going to find fault but to
[1:42:57] come and say what did you have I need
[1:43:00] and I want Hallelujah because you see
[1:43:04] when they stamp Caesar on that
[1:43:06] Penny it didn't look like
[1:43:12] Herod and we can't stand here today and
[1:43:14] say oh I've been marked by Christ but I
[1:43:18] look like the world yeah that's it amen
[1:43:20] and whatever's been stamped upon
[1:43:23] us will be evident amen will be
[1:43:28] evident Lord stamp me stamp me with your
[1:43:32] Holy Spirit you know this message I'm
[1:43:36] closing this message didn't come to give
[1:43:39] us something to argue about is't that
[1:43:41] amazing you can get people in a circle
[1:43:43] and before long if there's dissenting
[1:43:45] voices they'll be no no I'm right you're
[1:43:48] wrong I tell you my brother and sister
[1:43:51] this message come to draw you and I out
[1:43:54] that's right of our little
[1:43:56] houses of our little groups that we
[1:43:59] would lay in the presence of the sun
[1:44:03] right you see the wheat doesn't get
[1:44:05] ripe by saying I'm wheat that's right
[1:44:10] exactly
[1:44:13] right and I'm of this
[1:44:15] variety and you're of that
[1:44:18] variety we can't Fellowship
[1:44:21] no wheat comes to maturity amen by not
[1:44:26] saying you're not of us but by laying
[1:44:30] itself Amen in the presence of the
[1:44:33] Sun and it's there in the presence of
[1:44:36] the sun because you
[1:44:38] see makes sense right when all the wheat
[1:44:42] goes to the
[1:44:44] elevator it just all goes into one big
[1:44:48] pile and it doesn't hit and all all
[1:44:50] slide down together in the
[1:44:53] greenery some goes here and some goes
[1:44:56] there that's right amen so wherever I
[1:44:59] might be Lord let my light shine that's
[1:45:01] right let Christ that's
[1:45:09] been
[1:45:14] pressed pressed into
[1:45:17] me no matter where I'm at that's it
[1:45:21] that's it you know you see I'm sorry to
[1:45:23] go negative but I want to make this
[1:45:27] point you have message Believers get
[1:45:31] together where are you from well I
[1:45:34] belong to brother so and so's
[1:45:39] Church oh I belong to so and so's
[1:45:42] Church well I want us to change our
[1:45:45] vocabulary that's right I belong to
[1:45:48] Jesus
[1:45:49] Christ I live amen amen amen I don't
[1:45:53] know are you guys living in
[1:45:55] Louisiana yes I live in Louisiana I live
[1:45:58] in Washington I live in
[1:46:00] Idaho whatever it might be it's
[1:46:03] irrelevant if the image that's been
[1:46:06] pressed into US is Jesus
[1:46:09] Christ it's not a matter of where this
[1:46:12] is It's where God chose to place you and
[1:46:17] he placed you there because there's
[1:46:18] someone that needs to recognize that
[1:46:22] there is a life living in the presence
[1:46:24] of the son that reflects Jesus
[1:46:28] Christ
[1:46:30] hallelujah oh my I don't want to sound
[1:46:32] like I'm getting jaded but I'm telling
[1:46:34] you my brother and sister I'm just
[1:46:35] slowly getting very tired of people
[1:46:38] using all of these descriptive
[1:46:40] adjectives of describing who and what
[1:46:43] and where they are my Bible tells me I'm
[1:46:46] the bride of Christ and it doesn't say
[1:46:49] I'm the bride of Christ of here or the
[1:46:51] bride of Christ of there but I am the
[1:46:53] bride of Christ amen and I want to
[1:46:57] reflect and I want you to reflect the
[1:47:00] image of the word that God is pressing
[1:47:03] into his bride in this hour that we
[1:47:05] could then walk out and people wouldn't
[1:47:07] have to say now what religion are you
[1:47:10] they would be able to say I I I see
[1:47:12] you're a

[1:49:45] quote
[1:49:48] amen but you know the Heathen they
[1:49:50] prostrate themselves before an idol an
[1:49:53] imaginary God and in an imaginary way
[1:49:56] they believe that imaginary God speaks
[1:49:59] back to them that's heathenism that's
[1:50:03] romanism that's right they bow before
[1:50:05] all kind of saints and everything
[1:50:07] else they have Saint Cecilia a house God
[1:50:12] and so many different things like that
[1:50:14] they bow to that and actually believe
[1:50:17] that in an imaginary way
[1:50:20] what a type it is of the true Living God
[1:50:25] but when we not in an imaginary way
[1:50:28] that's it but prostrate ourselves before
[1:50:30] a living God a living virtue a living
[1:50:33] knowledge a living patience a living
[1:50:36] godliness a living power coming from a
[1:50:40] living God makes a living man a Living
[1:50:44] Image in the stature of God Amen I
[1:50:48] should have just read this quote
[1:50:50] dismissed earlier shouldn't
[1:50:53] I what's he doing the same things that
[1:50:57] Jesus did walking the same way he walked
[1:51:00] doing the same things he did because
[1:51:02] it's not imaginary thing there's a
[1:51:06] reality that proves amen see what I mean
[1:51:11] see how these virtues these building
[1:51:14] materials type in with the church
[1:51:17] Messengers with the church ages now one
[1:51:19] of these days we're going to take each
[1:51:21] one of these words and study them out
[1:51:23] and show that it proves it it Go all
[1:51:26] goes together sure see oh my how
[1:51:29] wonderful that is see to see it what it
[1:51:32] does
[1:51:34] now what is the house that God dwells
[1:51:37] in not a building with a great big Bell
[1:51:40] on top of it or a high steeple

[1:53:03] God have his way that's right and then
[1:53:05] you stop right there then it's not some
[1:53:07] deep spiritual thing but it's so
[1:53:10] deep that sometimes we miss
[1:53:13] it just to let God have his way
[1:53:18] why because
[1:53:21] if old Caesar saw that
[1:53:24] coin he'd say that coin
[1:53:27] exists because of
[1:53:32] me and when Christ looks at you that's
[1:53:35] it he says they exist that's right

[1:54:14] deep that it endured all kinds of
[1:54:18] struggle all kinds of daily wear and
[1:54:23] tear and the life and the nature of
[1:54:25] Christ is imprinted in you and I so deep
[1:54:29] amen the word says nothing is going to
[1:54:34] take it away that's right
[1:54:37] nothing not fiery trials not
[1:54:40] tribulations not cares of Life
