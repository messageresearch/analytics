[43:57] see my own life i will pass over you
[44:00] when i see my fruit in my season
[44:04] being manifested through you
[44:09] amen that's what it is
[44:12] all right i'd like you to turn with me
[44:14] to math malachi
[44:20] 4.
[44:22] and while you're standing and i don't
[44:23] mean to keep you standing but i realize
[44:25] here i've got to take a couple things
[44:27] that the prophet said and i've
[44:29] i have quoted it already but just bear
[44:32] with me
[44:34] brother brown said over and over again
[44:36] to know him is life
[44:39] to know him brother ham said on the
[44:42] message
[44:43] um rising of the sun he said and notice
[44:46] the by
[44:47] the message was it is the rising
[44:50] and then later in the message he said it
[44:52] is he is
[44:53] the sun is up
[44:58] satan doesn't care how religious you are
[45:03] or how right you are in your doctrine
[45:07] if you miss that life
[45:12] if you miss that like you have all
[45:14] knowledge of mysteries
[45:15] but if you miss that life
[45:19] amen you won't come up anyhow no matter
[45:22] how religious
[45:24] how good many good people
[45:28] good people doesn't put you in the
[45:30] rapture and i believe in being good
[45:34] i believe the bride will be good
[45:38] amen
[45:41] but you can put your trust in that and
[45:42] never be there
[45:44] there's a lot of good people that are
[45:47] led by the devil
[45:51] there's a lot of good people
[45:56] and i'm not talking about so much out in
[45:58] the world there's a lot of good people
[45:59] in the world outshine a lot of the
[46:00] people call
[46:01] so-called bride
[46:04] that's true in works they can outshine
[46:07] you
[46:12] amen a lot of good people
[46:15] they don't know a thing about the word a
[46:18] lot of good people say they got the word
[46:20] they quote the word
[46:21] they don't know anything about the word
[46:25] amen all right
[46:28] so he doesn't care if you miss that life
[46:31] that's what he's concerned about if you
[46:33] miss that life
[46:34] you won't come up anyhow no matter how
[46:36] religious how good how many churches you
[46:37] belong to or will belong to
[46:40] it doesn't matter one thing unless you
[46:43] have been born
[46:44] again the baptism of the holy ghost
[46:48] is the new birth
[46:54] amen amen and and we're
[46:58] and but the true baptism of the holy
[47:00] ghost
[47:03] is the new birth on the uh quickening
[47:06] the seed that's in you
[47:08] you cannot only the elect can be born
[47:10] again
[47:11] why because they are the seed of god
[47:16] amen i'm not saying who's elect and who
[47:19] isn't
[47:21] i'm just telling you that only the elect
[47:23] can be so if you've got the pull if
[47:25] you've got the desire if you've got the
[47:27] taste
[47:27] for more of him and wanting him then it
[47:30] shows in your soul
[47:32] then it shows god's got a filter for you
[47:33] to draw life through
[47:37] to quicken that seed
[47:42] amen all right he's
[47:45] so it doesn't matter one thing unless
[47:47] you've been born again
[47:49] brother brown said what a resurrection
[47:50] that was to see jesus
[47:52] no he raised but what a resurrection
[47:57] what is the new birth it's a
[47:58] resurrection
[48:01] amen is that right exactly what it is
[48:05] it's a resurrection from death to life
[48:09] you are a new creature and that creature
[48:11] is jesus christ revealed in you
[48:15] that's who you are and that's who you
[48:17] grow up into
[48:20] amen all right

[48:25] message

[48:28] shreveport 65. i was sitting over there
[48:30] talking to my old friend brother brown
[48:33] while the songs were going on and he
[48:35] said brother branham i've never seen
[48:36] till yesterday what you've been talking
[48:38] about he said if people could just get
[48:40] into what you're speaking about
[48:42] every obstacle would move out of the way
[48:48] just think if he began to see then
[48:51] what are we seeing now
[48:55] is that right think of it
[48:59] what kind of place there's some listen
[49:01] there's a maturity
[49:02] there's a bride and maturity coming
[49:04] forth here
[49:06] amen
[49:09] that's the brother brown said that's
[49:11] exactly right that's right it's exactly
[49:13] right if you could just grasp it could
[49:14] catch it
[49:16] now the promise is to the bride
[49:19] she will all right
[49:23] now i want you to
[49:29] listen to this quote here carefully i
[49:31] know i'm not on keeping you standing
[49:32] forgive me but you're going to sit for a
[49:34] while too so
[49:37] page 27 of christ revealed in his own
[49:40] word
[49:41] and i'm going to read some things out of
[49:43] this this morning
[49:44] church age book different things so bear
[49:46] with me
[49:50] i can only do as i'm led to do all right
[49:55] on paragraph 24 page six
[49:58] of this message i'm sorry 27
[50:02] today brother braham said today so
[50:04] confused
[50:05] about the evidence of the holy ghost
[50:09] and so forth satan can impersonate any
[50:12] kind of gift that god has got
[50:17] i'm going to read that again satan can
[50:20] impersonate
[50:22] any kind of gift that god has got but he
[50:25] cannot
[50:27] this is what he cannot do he cannot
[50:30] bring the word
[50:31] that word he said that word word by word
[50:35] that's where he failed in the garden of
[50:37] eden
[50:39] and that's where he's always failed
[50:43] that's where them he said on that tape
[50:46] and i'm gonna i'm gonna cover this
[50:48] on the false anointed ones or anointed
[50:50] ones
[50:51] they can be anointed with the spirit
[50:54] speak in tongues
[50:55] dance shout preach the gospel
[50:58] instill the devil
[51:01] you say well brother david that's pretty
[51:03] hard don't you think we could preach on
[51:05] something a little softer this morning
[51:08] no no this is a mystery that had to be
[51:10] opened up in this hour
[51:13] this was laying under those seals amen
[51:17] this opens up to who you are
[51:20] because these two spirits remember and i
[51:22] want you to hold this in mind as we go
[51:24] forth here in this message
[51:26] matthew 24 24 brother brown referred to
[51:28] it as
[51:29] two spirits so close that they would
[51:32] deceive the elect
[51:33] if possible that's how close they are
[51:37] but they're two spirits under the
[51:38] anointing of one spirit
[51:42] they're two spirits one is the spirit of
[51:44] god the other is the spirit of the devil
[51:49] two seeds one is god's seed one is
[51:52] serpency
[51:54] are you with me all right but they're
[51:56] both anointed by the holy spirit
[51:59] they can't live without that holy spirit
[52:01] anointing
[52:02] because that holy spirit anointing
[52:04] brings both to maturity
[52:08] you want to know what day we're in
[52:11] that's why the new birth
[52:12] without the new birth you will not be
[52:14] able to discern
[52:16] those differences and you aren't born
[52:20] again because you shouted because you
[52:22] prophesied because you had feelings and
[52:23] sensations
[52:24] you're born again because the word is a
[52:27] revelation
[52:28] to your heart for this day
[52:33] amen all right i've said a lot already
[52:37] we almost say amen go home
[52:42] all right so let's but so confused about
[52:45] the
[52:46] evidence what the evidence
[52:49] is brother we have a perfect answer
[52:53] we have the message of the seventh angel
[52:57] we are the message of the seventh angel
[53:02] that message didn't go away when he left
[53:04] that message increased
[53:06] he said i must decrease but what i
[53:08] prophesied to you what i've given to you
[53:10] he said has got to increase he must he
[53:13] he must
[53:14] increase
[53:18] he is here today in the bride form
[53:24] who is the son of man revealing himself
[53:27] through her
[53:29] decline why you say why brother david
[53:31] because she's him she's the mystery of
[53:33] god
[53:34] revealed amen
[53:37] complete mystery
[53:40] seventh angel's message the mystery of
[53:42] god
[53:43] would be completed then what are we
[53:46] facing in that completion
[53:49] where what are you facing here you say
[53:51] well i'm facing rapture that's right
[53:53] that's the that's the that's the full
[53:55] capping of this revelation
[53:57] but what are you facing what's the third
[53:58] coming
[54:00] millennium what's the millennium eden
[54:05] there's three comings of christ you know
[54:07] that the third coming is when he walks
[54:09] out with it
[54:10] on the earth is that right in the
[54:13] millennium
[54:17] but the mystery of the seventh seal is
[54:19] the second coming
[54:22] it's his coming that's the mystery
[54:26] remember how brother braham said the
[54:28] seven seal mysteries the coming of the
[54:29] lord
[54:32] amen all right and he said those seven
[54:35] thunders hold that mystery
[54:40] amen you see that's why the bride
[54:44] is such a different person she's a
[54:45] mystic to many people
[54:49] okay i'm getting a little ahead of
[54:50] myself so we'll back up here
[54:53] so
[54:58] i want to read one other thing and i'm
[54:59] going to read the scriptures so just
[55:01] just bear with me

[55:13] reread it read it reread it i got a
[55:15] brother
[55:16] in in billings montana right now that
[55:18] just can't get enough of it he's already
[55:19] read it four times i think
[55:21] yeah and he just can't get enough of it
[55:23] and still he just says my goodness the
[55:25] whole
[55:25] he said i he said he he loves he loves
[55:28] the message
[55:29] but he just can't get enough of it he
[55:31] said that thing has opened the words
[55:32] completely open
[55:33] to me what's opened what's opened
[55:37] something's open to him hallelujah
[55:41] amen all right all right in in the page
[55:44] top
[55:44] bottom of page 327 now the messenger of
[55:46] malachi 4. anybody
[55:48] know the messenger of malachi 4.
[55:51] the holy spirit
[55:57] kind of threw one on you didn't i
[56:01] that's right but he he used the prophet
[56:04] it was a prophet with the spirit of
[56:05] elijah is that right
[56:07] all right but the spirit of elijah was
[56:09] none other but the holy spirit
[56:11] is right but he used that nature to
[56:14] minister through to us is that right so
[56:16] we had an elijah in this hour all right
[56:18] so the but the messenger of malachi 4
[56:21] and
[56:22] revelation 10 7
[56:27] is going to do two things
[56:31] number one according to malachi 4 he
[56:33] will turn
[56:35] the hearts i want to put emphasis
[56:39] the hearts he will turn the hearts of
[56:43] the
[56:44] children to the fathers

[56:49] pentecostal
[56:50] word-born fathers
[56:54] are you with me turn it back to that
[56:56] original life original
[56:58] word the original seed is what i believe
[57:02] all right to the fathers number two he
[57:05] will reveal
[57:07] the mysteries his message now watch his
[57:09] message he will reveal the mysteries
[57:11] of the seven thunders in revelation 10
[57:14] which are the revelations contained in
[57:18] the seven
[57:18] seals seven seals
[57:24] seven
[57:26] amen not just six so the seventh had
[57:30] something it contained that is revealed
[57:35] all right then it will be these
[57:38] divinely revealed mystery truths
[57:43] that literally turn
[57:46] the hearts the hearts the hearts
[57:50] of the children to the pentecostal
[57:54] fathers only the children's
[57:57] hearts brother brown said will be
[58:00] turned it's only the children who will
[58:04] listen
[58:06] and he refers to it as true seed

[58:24] i will send you elijah the prophet
[58:26] before the coming of the great and
[58:28] dreadful day of the lord
[58:30] and he shall turn
[58:33] the heart i'm going to drop right down
[58:35] here to his day
[58:37] and the heart of the children to their
[58:40] fathers
[58:41] lest i come and smite the earth with the
[58:43] curse see why did you miss that because
[58:44] john the baptist was part one
[58:46] of verse five or 6 excuse me
[58:50] are you with me all right they see but
[58:54] this message was to turn
[58:55] our hearts back what's then to turn your
[58:58] heart back there had to be something in
[59:00] your heart
[59:00] to turn

[59:12] morning all right turn

[59:43] with the cloud and a
[59:44] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[59:47] face as it were the

[1:00:28] section of the lamb's book
[1:00:30] is the eternal life section that brother
[1:00:32] braham said speaks of his bride

[1:00:40] of life will be bride
[1:00:44] you i you question that go back to
[1:00:46] church ages he makes that very clear
[1:00:49] it's a section that is a section that
[1:00:52] speaks of his bride only
[1:00:56] and that's eternal life and those names
[1:00:58] can never be removed from it
[1:01:00] he said the land book of life the book
[1:01:02] of life the record of life
[1:01:04] those are all the same book but there
[1:01:06] was a section of that lamb's book of
[1:01:08] life he said or the book of life
[1:01:10] that was the bride portion i'll just
[1:01:13] drop that right there because i'm not my

[1:01:38] to change this body
[1:01:42] and i am that rapture
[1:01:45] amen amen
[1:01:50] all right now he says here going on and
[1:01:54] he had his hand a little book open set
[1:01:55] his right foot upon the sea and his left
[1:01:57] foot upon the earth and cried with a
[1:01:58] loud voice a loud voice a loud voice
[1:02:02] lazarus with a loud voice a loud voice
[1:02:04] he gave up the ghost
[1:02:07] as when a lion roareth
[1:02:11] and when he had cried seven thunders
[1:02:15] uttered their voices and when the seven
[1:02:18] thunders had uttered their voices i was
[1:02:20] about to write so john was about to
[1:02:22] write
[1:02:23] something they said
[1:02:27] but the scripture said here and a voice
[1:02:30] from heaven saying to me seal
[1:02:31] up those things seal up those things
[1:02:34] which were seven thunders i heard and
[1:02:35] write them not
[1:02:36] and brother brahm said he said seal them
[1:02:38] up where
[1:02:43] and the angel which i saw stand upon the
[1:02:45] sea and upon the earth lifted up his
[1:02:47] hand to heaven
[1:02:48] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:02:51] ever who created heaven and
[1:02:52] now now notice brother sister notice
[1:02:54] there was something unwritten in this
[1:02:56] word here
[1:03:00] in this bi in this chapter
[1:03:04] something unwritten unwritten it's what
[1:03:07] john heard
[1:03:08] is that right but it's in the word yes
[1:03:11] it is
[1:03:14] it's not out of the word but it wasn't
[1:03:16] written here
[1:03:19] amen but brother baby said this
[1:03:20] unwritten word would be revealed at the
[1:03:22] seventh angel's message
[1:03:26] amen all right
[1:03:29] all right now anne
[1:03:34] and i and swear by him okay that liveth
[1:03:36] forever and ever who created heaven
[1:03:37] are the things that are in our in the
[1:03:39] earth and the things that therein are
[1:03:41] and the sea
[1:03:41] and the things which are therein that
[1:03:43] there should be time no longer
[1:03:46] in other words that time is no longer
[1:03:48] delayed
[1:03:49] we've come to the end brother brahm said
[1:03:50] we're here we've arrived
[1:03:53] we have the sign of the end we're here
[1:03:55] we've come to the end of time
[1:03:58] we haven't seen the fulfilling of the
[1:03:59] end yet but it's here
[1:04:01] we're in that day we're in that time how
[1:04:03] may i understand what is being said
[1:04:05] all right he said that's when it was to
[1:04:08] take place
[1:04:11] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:04:14] voice
[1:04:16] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[1:04:19] to sound the mystery
[1:04:21] of god who is the mystery of god
[1:04:24] revealed so the mystery of god
[1:04:28] should be finished
[1:04:32] as he had declared to his servants of
[1:04:34] prophets now i'm going to stop right
[1:04:35] there
[1:04:38] in hebrews chapter 12 or chapter four
[1:04:40] excuse me hebrews chapter four
[1:04:43] so he's gonna he's coming with a message
[1:04:45] to turn the heart
[1:04:47] amen

[1:04:52] those seven thunders would literally
[1:04:55] turn the hearts
[1:04:58] of the children amen
[1:05:02] and it's progressive revelation to
[1:05:05] revelation
[1:05:06] from glory to glory he's changing me
[1:05:10] all right and in hebrews
[1:05:14] chapter 4 and in verse 12.

[1:05:22] possible and i
[1:05:23] and i don't i there's so much lord help
[1:05:26] me

[1:05:38] for the word of god is quick and
[1:05:41] powerful that word quick and powerful
[1:05:43] is living and operative
[1:05:46] the prophet said this that the bride
[1:05:48] would be the word living and
[1:05:50] in action living and operative
[1:05:55] the word is quick and powerful and
[1:05:58] sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:06:01] piercing even to the dividing asunder
[1:06:04] a separation god is a segregationist
[1:06:08] i may know that's true separates truth
[1:06:12] from error life from darkness
[1:06:13] light and darkness truth from error
[1:06:17] he segregates he did from the beginning
[1:06:20] he still does
[1:06:21] my mic in and out i don't know what's
[1:06:24] happening here but
[1:06:29] but let me bring that back again
[1:06:31] dividing asunder piercing even to the
[1:06:33] dividing asunder
[1:06:35] of what soul and spirit
[1:06:39] am i losing battery or got battery
[1:06:44] i don't like these
[1:06:48] i don't like it in my hand are you with
[1:06:51] me
[1:06:53] testing one two eight nine
[1:06:57] fourteen all right
[1:07:02] i'll try all right the
[1:07:06] dividing asunder of soul and spirit
[1:07:11] of soul and spirit there's a great
[1:07:14] divide in here
[1:07:17] something has been divided between the
[1:07:19] spirit
[1:07:20] and the soul there's a division between
[1:07:23] the two
[1:07:26] he's making a difference here
[1:07:30] amen now you're a triune being
[1:07:33] you can be seated i'll let you be seated
[1:07:35] i'm sorry thank you for standing so long
[1:07:38] you're a triune being
[1:07:42] you're made up of body spirit
[1:07:45] soul is that right three circles how
[1:07:48] many
[1:07:48] are familiar with what i'm talking about
[1:07:49] brother brown used it many times
[1:07:51] three circles and he referred always
[1:07:54] back to the
[1:07:55] little wheel in the middle of the wheel
[1:07:59] which was the soul but it's a little
[1:08:02] wheel in the middle of the second wheel
[1:08:07] if you're if you're centered on christ
[1:08:09] everything revolves around that center
[1:08:12] if you're born again everything revolves
[1:08:14] around that center
[1:08:18] amen now that's the heart realm
[1:08:23] that's the soul realm
[1:08:26] there is a soul realm brother branham
[1:08:29] referred to it as the third realm
[1:08:32] all right so now there's a division that
[1:08:36] this word will discern
[1:08:38] and divide and separate
[1:08:42] between the soul the spirit and the
[1:08:43] joints and it goes right down referring
[1:08:46] to the same thing and the joints and the
[1:08:47] marrow
[1:08:49] morals always inside of the bone it's
[1:08:52] the life source of the bone it's where
[1:08:53] the blood cells are
[1:08:55] are you with me all right
[1:08:59] and is a discerner oh my
[1:09:03] watch this and is a discerner
[1:09:06] of the thought and intent of the heart
[1:09:11] oh i'm glad for this message
[1:09:15] aren't you happy for the message all
[1:09:17] right now psalms chapter 1.
[1:09:23] so hebrews 4 12 a segregation of
[1:09:25] separation there's a separation by the
[1:09:27] word
[1:09:29] amen there's a separation by the word
[1:09:34] i mean how many believeth all your heart
[1:09:36] that what came in this hour was the word
[1:09:38] so there's a separation it's bringing a
[1:09:40] separation
[1:09:44] by the word we can't feel bad about
[1:09:46] separation because separation
[1:09:49] if it's god the word doing the
[1:09:50] separating that's what you want
[1:09:55] amen all right but the word and i must
[1:09:58] say this the word will separate
[1:10:04] all right remember
[1:10:08] remember as i said remember matthew 24
[1:10:11] 24.
[1:10:13] two spirits
[1:10:17] amen one of those spirits is in your
[1:10:21] soul
[1:10:22] and the other one is in the soul not to
[1:10:25] not the same time
[1:10:26] that's one or the other are you with me
[1:10:30] you were born with one or the other
[1:10:32] there
[1:10:35] amen because god planted or
[1:10:37] predestinated at that in your soul that
[1:10:39] seed
[1:10:41] are you with me
[1:10:45] all right some can never be saved some
[1:10:48] will be saved
[1:10:51] some can never rise and others will
[1:10:55] what's determining that not their good
[1:10:58] works or lack of it
[1:11:02] but for knowledge predestination
[1:11:06] amen jacob i loved he saw hate
[1:11:09] esau was a better man than jacob you
[1:11:11] would have chose esau
[1:11:15] he had to turn jacob down because he was
[1:11:17] a shyster
[1:11:19] he was a good jew he's a shyster i hope
[1:11:21] there's no jews here
[1:11:24] brother brown called them watch out be
[1:11:26] careful
[1:11:28] hold your pocketbook
[1:11:33] see but there's there's elect you also
[1:11:37] elect israel see but he was an elected
[1:11:41] one
[1:11:42] brother brahm said jacob alone had the
[1:11:44] seed
[1:11:46] jacob was seed he said
[1:11:51] so he didn't choose jacob on his works
[1:11:53] or lack of it
[1:11:55] before he was born he said i loved him
[1:11:58] why
[1:11:59] jacob was himself the word
[1:12:03] the seed what you are in your soul is
[1:12:08] who you really are
[1:12:12] the outside can be an outward expression
[1:12:14] but it's always what's in the heart
[1:12:16] tells you who you are and you can tell
[1:12:19] who you are you can tell by the desire
[1:12:21] and the taste
[1:12:22] that you have because you'll always look
[1:12:24] for a filter to satisfy your taste
[1:12:30] are you with me but so god's provided a
[1:12:32] filter to satisfy a holy man's taste
[1:12:35] to satisfy the taste for the seed
[1:12:38] of god amen
[1:12:42] and when you draw through that filter
[1:12:43] nothing comes through it but the holy
[1:12:45] spirit
[1:12:46] because the holy spirit was sent to
[1:12:48] quicken that seed
[1:12:51] his seed but if that seed his seed isn't
[1:12:55] in there
[1:12:56] then you'll draw for whatever taste or
[1:12:57] desire you have in your soul you'll draw
[1:12:59] for that taste
[1:13:02] you'll dress for that taste you say i
[1:13:04] won't take all the word
[1:13:05] you either take all the word or miss the
[1:13:07] rapture
[1:13:09] okay let's let's go on i get i'll get on
[1:13:12] these and i've got to keep moving
[1:13:14] sometimes i wish the clock was up there
[1:13:16] but it's right here so
[1:13:18] sometimes i wish it wasn't all right
[1:13:23] psalms chapter one
[1:13:27] and notice there what i'm trying to lead
[1:13:29] to is something inside of you
[1:13:32] is working
[1:13:40] all right brother brown said that a
[1:13:41] message communion 1965
[1:13:44] he said it was already there working he
[1:13:46] didn't even know about it it was already
[1:13:47] working
[1:13:49] and he said i was born again and it was
[1:13:51] working in me
[1:13:53] that seed that life that little spot of
[1:13:56] life he said that was in there
[1:13:59] all right so something's in the heart
[1:14:02] and the message of the
[1:14:03] hour would unveil it
[1:14:08] and it would be a complete revelation of
[1:14:10] jesus christ
[1:14:13] let me just drop this in right now
[1:14:16] paragraph 52 of this message it's right
[1:14:19] here
[1:14:19] the bible is a brother had it on the
[1:14:21] board last sunday
[1:14:22] the bible is the complete revelation of
[1:14:24] jesus christ
[1:14:26] then what is christ in you what does it
[1:14:27] make you
[1:14:31] it makes you the complete revelation of
[1:14:32] the whole thing
[1:14:37] amen it makes you the complete
[1:14:38] revelation of the whole thing
[1:14:42] amen the revelation of jesus christ in
[1:14:44] you he would build his church upon the
[1:14:46] revelation of who he is
[1:14:48] that's what you're receiving and he said
[1:14:50] i'll build my church on that revelation
[1:14:52] of who i
[1:14:53] am then who i am is who she is and who
[1:14:56] she is is who i
[1:14:57] am
[1:15:01] amen that's right all right so
[1:15:04] blessed is the man psalm 1 1 blessed is
[1:15:07] the man that walketh not in the counsel
[1:15:09] of the ungodly
[1:15:11] nor standeth in the way of sinners nor
[1:15:13] sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[1:15:15] be careful there's a lot of scorners
[1:15:18] around the message
[1:15:19] i'm sorry to say that but they're
[1:15:21] scoring anything that even
[1:15:23] appears to be
[1:15:26] the word yet they don't even know what
[1:15:28] they're scoring
[1:15:30] amen amen we don't want scorning
[1:15:37] if you don't understand it let it alone
[1:15:40] and let god take care of it
[1:15:41] don't go start talking about to other
[1:15:44] people
[1:15:47] what you don't like and what this one
[1:15:48] did and that one did be careful of your
[1:15:50] discernment
[1:15:52] because it may be way off the line all
[1:15:55] right
[1:15:58] so he said he's and he shall be like a
[1:16:01] tree
[1:16:02] no excuse me verse two but his delight
[1:16:05] is in the law of the lord and in his law
[1:16:08] doth he meditate day and night
[1:16:12] the bible said he that keeps his mind on
[1:16:14] him he will give him perfect peace for
[1:16:15] he trusteth in me
[1:16:18] amen is that right psalm 26 3
[1:16:22] and he shall be like a tree planted
[1:16:24] predestinated
[1:16:26] by the rivers of one water
[1:16:30] water singular that bringeth forth
[1:16:33] his fruit
[1:16:37] in his season
[1:16:40] notice the his here his fruit in his
[1:16:46] season
[1:16:50] and versus season his leaf also shall
[1:16:53] not wither
[1:16:54] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[1:17:00] amen on the message broken cisterns
[1:17:04] i want to just bring in in remembrance
[1:17:06] something here also i
[1:17:07] i'm not going to get through this but i
[1:17:09] may just and god help me i've said this
[1:17:11] many times i'll take a part too but i
[1:17:13] never get around to taking part two
[1:17:14] because by the time i get a part two
[1:17:16] it's already gone i've got a ten other
[1:17:18] messages
[1:17:22] and so it's part two kind of i know
[1:17:24] brother chris kind of realized part two
[1:17:26] kind of you just wonder where's part two
[1:17:30] that right because the word just keeps
[1:17:33] opening so quickly
[1:17:35] my just keeps it again dovetails every
[1:17:37] bit of it
[1:17:40] but god help us
[1:17:43] first pull second pull third pull first
[1:17:46] pull was what
[1:17:48] healing what'd it do
[1:17:52] it's a pull what to do it caught the
[1:17:54] attention of the people attraction it's
[1:17:56] an attraction
[1:17:57] boy they come out by the thousands
[1:18:00] is that right what they do with jesus on
[1:18:03] it was jesus's own ministry today
[1:18:05] what was jesus ministry yesterday same
[1:18:08] thing
[1:18:09] oh great prophet my look at healing
[1:18:13] lepers walk blind seed deaf here they
[1:18:15] just attracted thousands of people
[1:18:18] under that healing first pull healing
[1:18:20] second poll was prophecy now begin to
[1:18:22] separate a little bit
[1:18:26] watch these polls now the second poll
[1:18:28] began to separate
[1:18:30] uh although not quite so many came out
[1:18:35] they like to be entertained under the
[1:18:37] second pull
[1:18:39] which it wasn't meant for entertaining
[1:18:42] but they liked to be but they also
[1:18:43] didn't want to be because it exposed
[1:18:45] them
[1:18:47] and the prophecy of the word began to
[1:18:50] expose them because he began to
[1:18:51] put these things in order baptism
[1:18:54] eternal security
[1:18:56] on and on we could go amen
[1:19:00] under that second pull prophecy
[1:19:04] that began to separate even more but
[1:19:06] watch the third one
[1:19:08] remember he said the first pull little
[1:19:10] fish all ran for it
[1:19:12] then the second pull some other fish but
[1:19:14] some bigger fish showed up
[1:19:18] he attracted every one of them but then
[1:19:20] the third pull was sent to do what
[1:19:23] catch the big one other words
[1:19:26] those pulls but when it come to the
[1:19:28] third pull it was the opening of the
[1:19:30] word
[1:19:33] and it separated again now it's
[1:19:36] separated to what
[1:19:38] to the word itself
[1:19:42] amen who's gonna who's gonna walk into
[1:19:45] that
[1:19:46] the bride that's what it was for
[1:19:51] that's what those polls were for so she
[1:19:54] could take the hook
[1:19:58] the voice followed those signs are you
[1:20:00] with me
[1:20:01] there was a voice brother said
[1:20:05] wednesday night he said it's not one
[1:20:06] thing to walk see the light
[1:20:08] attracted by the light but it's hearing
[1:20:10] the voice too
[1:20:13] some saw the light didn't hear the voice
[1:20:15] see
[1:20:16] they didn't hear the voice but jesus
[1:20:18] said my sheep hear my voice
[1:20:22] my sheep hear my voice
[1:20:28] so it comes down to this he that hath an
[1:20:31] ear
[1:20:32] let him hear what the spirit saith to
[1:20:36] the churches
[1:20:38] okay and the broken cistern message he
[1:20:41] said you cannot make a man
[1:20:43] see the word of god till his nature has
[1:20:45] been changed
[1:20:47] and when his natures change from what he
[1:20:49] is to a son of god
[1:20:51] and the holy spirit comes into him the
[1:20:53] holy spirit wrote the word of god
[1:20:55] and the holy spirit comes into him
[1:20:58] all right now on page 30
[1:21:03] of the church age book he said this and
[1:21:06] you can
[1:21:06] you can see this throughout but he
[1:21:09] mentions this other times
[1:21:10] but brother graham said the bottom of
[1:21:12] the page 30 he says this
[1:21:14] it says in the word that no man can say
[1:21:16] that jesus christ
[1:21:18] that jesus is the christ except by the
[1:21:21] holy ghost
[1:21:26] i look back up a little bit before that
[1:21:28] he said if revelation is beyond you look
[1:21:30] up and seek
[1:21:31] god for it that is the only way you'll
[1:21:34] ever going to get it
[1:21:36] a revelation has to come from god it
[1:21:39] never comes by human
[1:21:40] natural endowments but by spiritual
[1:21:43] endowment
[1:21:47] you can never you can even memorize the
[1:21:49] scriptures and though that is wonderful
[1:21:51] that won't do it
[1:21:52] it has to be a revelation from god it
[1:21:55] says in the word that no man can say
[1:21:57] that jesus
[1:21:58] is the christ except by the holy ghost
[1:22:01] you have to receive the you have to
[1:22:04] receive the holy ghost and then and then
[1:22:06] only can the spirit give you the
[1:22:09] revelation
[1:22:10] that jesus is the christ
[1:22:16] amen
[1:22:22] see god he said jesus is the christ or
[1:22:25] other words jesus
[1:22:26] is god the anointed one
[1:22:30] amen all right
[1:22:37] so he said he said here he says and when
[1:22:40] his nature has changed from what he is
[1:22:42] to a son of god and the holy spirit
[1:22:43] comes into him
[1:22:44] the holy spirit wrote the word of god
[1:22:46] today i was talking to with my good
[1:22:47] friend dr lee vale
[1:22:49] who is present now and he's quite a
[1:22:51] theologian and so we
[1:22:52] usually have some pretty good
[1:22:54] discussions on scripture
[1:22:56] he's a very smart man he's very smart he
[1:22:58] said i said
[1:23:03] and i asked he asked me one time
[1:23:06] what i thought about the initial
[1:23:08] evidence of the holy ghost
[1:23:09] was it speaking in tongues it's been
[1:23:12] many years ago
[1:23:14] and i said no can't see that he said
[1:23:17] neither do i
[1:23:18] though i've been taught that he said
[1:23:20] what would you think would be the
[1:23:21] evidence
[1:23:22] and i said now once you listen carefully
[1:23:25] i said the most perfect evidence i can
[1:23:27] think of is love
[1:23:29] and so we got to talking on that and
[1:23:31] then i thought that sounded pretty good
[1:23:33] so i just
[1:23:34] held that if a man's got love watch
[1:23:38] but one day watch just a progressive
[1:23:42] message
[1:23:43] it keeps opening are you with me opening
[1:23:45] to the prophet opening is that right
[1:23:47] just the same way it works with you the
[1:23:49] more you lay in the presence of that son
[1:23:51] the more it keeps opening it keeps
[1:23:54] opening
[1:23:55] what's an opening to do it's taking you
[1:23:57] right into a body change
[1:24:00] the rapture rapture's begun
[1:24:04] either begin a good work and you will
[1:24:06] perform it
[1:24:08] is that right who will he will
[1:24:13] all right now he said
[1:24:16] he said but one day the lord by vision
[1:24:18] in a vision straightened me out he said
[1:24:20] the evidence of the spirit
[1:24:22] was those who could receive the word
[1:24:26] so the evidence the evidence the most
[1:24:28] perfect evidence
[1:24:33] was those who could receive the word
[1:24:35] amen
[1:24:37] neither love now brother sister that's
[1:24:40] good oh i received the word bless god i
[1:24:42] received the word but no revelation of
[1:24:43] it
[1:24:45] he that has an ear to hear
[1:24:48] brother abraham said the ear to the
[1:24:50] hearing is receiving
[1:24:56] amen all right he said
[1:25:00] he said here said who can receive the
[1:25:02] word
[1:25:03] he said it's neither love nor speaking
[1:25:06] in tongues
[1:25:07] it's receiving the word
[1:25:12] well yes i as i said yeah i believe the
[1:25:14] word yeah uh-huh
[1:25:15] listen there's people in this message
[1:25:16] don't even believe malachi 4 because
[1:25:18] they're still looking for him to return
[1:25:19] to bring him the message
[1:25:23] and he already did it what other
[1:25:26] messages have come back in return for
[1:25:29] the message is living right now the
[1:25:31] message is returned all right
[1:25:33] it's living right here in pride form
[1:25:34] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:25:36] and forever
[1:25:40] there certainly is a return ministry
[1:25:45] but it was introduced i've introduced
[1:25:48] you to him
[1:25:48] i must decrease he must increase
[1:25:52] it's not another it's him hear ye him
[1:25:54] not hear ye her hear ye him
[1:26:00] amen all right so it's receiving the
[1:26:02] word then dr vale was saying to me that
[1:26:04] is scriptural
[1:26:05] and you can look that up you can go to
[1:26:07] saint john 14 26
[1:26:08] it speaks of it i'm saving time here and
[1:26:11] saint john 16 13 through 15.
[1:26:13] here's what it says it he says it kind
[1:26:16] of
[1:26:17] cuts it here but he said when dr vale
[1:26:19] said to me that scripture
[1:26:20] because john in fort john 14 said when
[1:26:23] he the holy ghost has come upon you
[1:26:25] he will reveal these things to you that
[1:26:27] i've taught you and will show you things
[1:26:29] to come
[1:26:30] there it is
[1:26:35] amen now he says so there is
[1:26:38] so there is so there is the genuine
[1:26:42] evidence of the holy ghost
[1:26:43] he has never told me anything wrong yet
[1:26:46] that
[1:26:47] that it that that evidence it is
[1:26:50] the evidence of the holy ghost is he who
[1:26:53] can believe
[1:26:54] the word you can receive it
[1:26:59] it's faith brother sister it's
[1:27:00] revelation
[1:27:02] it's the holy spirit in you working
[1:27:05] identifying himself
[1:27:09] because remember these things are hid in
[1:27:11] the scripture you read the letter
[1:27:12] but there's a thought behind that letter
[1:27:16] it's not revealed to everybody it's
[1:27:19] revealed to his bride
[1:27:21] now you take that word i don't care you
[1:27:22] take it you take it right give it a
[1:27:24] right mental attitude and god will bring
[1:27:26] it to pass
[1:27:26] is that right yes he will
[1:27:31] but it's a revelation of it amen
[1:27:34] that opens it up
[1:27:40] all right now so he says
[1:27:43] receiving it and said there's the
[1:27:45] genuine evidence and
[1:27:46] of course jesus never said when the holy
[1:27:48] ghost has come you'll speak with tongues
[1:27:50] he never said the holy ghost you come
[1:27:51] you'll do any of those things
[1:27:54] shout dance and i listen let me just
[1:27:56] stop here i believe in shouting
[1:27:58] i believe in dancing i believe in
[1:28:00] getting happy enough to shout and
[1:28:02] and and hallelujah and amen and but
[1:28:05] there's something working
[1:28:06] down in me that's no evidence that i'm
[1:28:12] right
[1:28:14] it's where that word is leading me
[1:28:18] it's what that word is open to me it's
[1:28:20] the opening of it it's a revelation
[1:28:23] amen everything you do everything every
[1:28:26] little voice everything come by you
[1:28:28] he said you better check it by the word
[1:28:30] because if it doesn't lay in that word
[1:28:32] you better get away from it because it's
[1:28:34] not the spirit of god
[1:28:37] if it doesn't lay in the word it's wrong
[1:28:42] any revelation true revelation the
[1:28:44] prophet said any true revelation given
[1:28:46] by god
[1:28:47] will be vindicated by the word of god
[1:28:51] amen that's right
[1:28:55] all right now so we go here
[1:28:59] keep he said now he said he but he said
[1:29:02] you you
[1:29:03] whether you do any of those things it's
[1:29:05] not the evidence he but the evidence is
[1:29:07] he'll take these things of mine
[1:29:09] and show them to you
[1:29:13] will show you things that is to come now
[1:29:16] there is the genuine
[1:29:17] evidence of the holy ghost according to
[1:29:20] jesus himself
[1:29:25] so all these sensations and things that
[1:29:27] people have and live on
[1:29:33] and the earth's full of it
[1:29:36] all these sensations and things that
[1:29:38] people have and live on
[1:29:40] you can see why they do it see it
[1:29:42] becomes
[1:29:43] a denomination or a stagnated pool
[1:29:46] and they'll never be a denomination
[1:29:48] they'll never be a denomination made
[1:29:50] upon the
[1:29:51] upon there'll never be a denomination
[1:29:55] made upon
[1:29:56] the perfect word of god
[1:29:59] it can't do it because you can't
[1:30:02] nominate or denominate god
[1:30:06] can't put him in a box and this is the
[1:30:08] way it is and this is this
[1:30:09] this is i've got this and because i got
[1:30:11] that because i shouted because i felt
[1:30:13] good because i spoke in tongues because
[1:30:14] i had something come to me
[1:30:16] i wrote it out be careful it may not
[1:30:17] even be the word of god
[1:30:22] those are spirits but that's not
[1:30:26] evidence that you've got the holy ghost
[1:30:29] that's no evidence god's trying to show
[1:30:33] you the evidence here
[1:30:35] all right now so
[1:30:40] and it's not something you work yourself
[1:30:42] up into
[1:30:43] make it happen
[1:30:47] god just fills you with himself opens up
[1:30:49] himself in you
[1:30:51] identifying you identifying himself in
[1:30:54] you
[1:30:58] well what will i do when i get the holy
[1:31:00] ghost what will i do well i shout while
[1:31:02] i do this while you may not do anything
[1:31:04] but it'll be a reality it'll be a
[1:31:07] revelation to you
[1:31:11] you know you've met him
[1:31:14] amen and watch that word begin to unveil
[1:31:16] itself
[1:31:17] unveil itself look at it open up and you
[1:31:20] may do other things you may do this i
[1:31:21] don't know what you might do but don't
[1:31:23] look at what you do or don't do as the
[1:31:24] evidence that you've got it
[1:31:29] because it isn't
[1:31:33] amen i'm not getting too many amens but
[1:31:36] anyway it's all right
[1:31:38] i said this this is kind of mystic
[1:31:43] god makes it that way you know sometimes
[1:31:46] he doesn't come right out plainly and
[1:31:47] say it sometimes just to see what you'll
[1:31:49] do about it
[1:31:51] i read that quote here a while back
[1:31:54] brother branham even said he'll make it
[1:31:56] a little shadowy
[1:32:02] is he afraid of himself in the bride is
[1:32:04] he afraid of what he put there
[1:32:07] she can no more deny that word let that
[1:32:09] word come to life
[1:32:10] and light before her she'll receive that
[1:32:13] there's something in her
[1:32:14] that has to say amen to that
[1:32:17] and then watch when you fully obey watch
[1:32:19] when you obey the word and watch and see
[1:32:21] if the word doesn't open up
[1:32:22] it shows you what that is inside
[1:32:25] pulling you the taste you've got
[1:32:34] all right now so you can't denominate
[1:32:38] a perfect word of god and the bible said
[1:32:41] his word is pure
[1:32:43] so don't add your symptoms into it
[1:32:48] and don't add your reasoning and your
[1:32:49] feelings into it and in your senses into
[1:32:52] it
[1:32:52] just leave it alone and believe it to
[1:32:54] what he said and leave it there and act
[1:32:56] on it
[1:32:59] jonah did that he refused to look at the
[1:33:01] vomit
[1:33:03] the seaweed he said i'll turn i'll turn
[1:33:06] instead
[1:33:08] to the word spoken about from solomon if
[1:33:10] any will look to this house
[1:33:13] and believe is that right he took the
[1:33:14] word
[1:33:16] peter would have done fine if he hadn't
[1:33:18] looked the waves
[1:33:20] if he had just stayed with the word you
[1:33:23] can't mix it
[1:33:25] the words pure you can't mix it
[1:33:28] it's perfect
[1:33:32] see our human language of perfect always
[1:33:35] leaves a little spot for imperfection
[1:33:38] but the word perfect in the bible is
[1:33:40] complete
[1:33:41] and there's nothing added to her taken
[1:33:42] from it
[1:33:44] it's perfect and when it says it's pure
[1:33:48] there's nothing as pure as that you
[1:33:50] can't drop
[1:33:51] something into the into the light and
[1:33:53] say well i have all light now you can't
[1:33:55] put a shadow to it
[1:33:57] this is a message god is light and they
[1:34:00] that are in him
[1:34:04] amen this then is the message god is
[1:34:07] light
[1:34:08] and in him
[1:34:11] is no darkness
[1:34:16] all right now the reason it is you get a
[1:34:19] bunch of men that can
[1:34:20] who who can believe the word let them
[1:34:22] start an organization the first thing
[1:34:24] you know in a year's time there's a
[1:34:26] bunch of rickies in there
[1:34:27] that you couldn't do nothing with in a
[1:34:29] bunch listen
[1:34:30] you see it we see it
[1:34:34] i'm not talking about the world i'm
[1:34:35] talking about among the message
[1:34:37] this matthew 24 24 isn't out here in the
[1:34:40] world anymore
[1:34:41] it's right here on those that proclaim
[1:34:42] the message
[1:34:46] but i'm telling you the evidence he's
[1:34:48] telling you the lord's trying to show
[1:34:50] you
[1:34:50] the evidence that divides the difference
[1:34:52] of it here he's showing you who you are
[1:34:55] he's taking you from just a spirit walk
[1:34:57] to a soul revelation of his word in your
[1:35:00] soul
[1:35:03] i haven't even got down here to meet
[1:35:04] what i want to say quite yet
[1:35:06] anyway so you you've been a year by the
[1:35:09] rickies get into it they got they got a
[1:35:11] hold
[1:35:12] you can't do nothing about it it's god's
[1:35:14] system it isn't
[1:35:15] it he said it's not god's system excuse
[1:35:18] me
[1:35:18] it isn't so we know that the thing is
[1:35:21] out
[1:35:22] it becomes a cistern becomes a place
[1:35:24] where each one will compromise on this
[1:35:26] and that and the other to get members in
[1:35:28] there or let people come in
[1:35:30] so they've had to provide a filter for
[1:35:32] their taste
[1:35:34] that's why you see nudity coming in it
[1:35:36] shouldn't even come around the message
[1:35:44] i know i i know you don't like to hear
[1:35:46] that
[1:35:48] but i'll tell you what you put a holy
[1:35:51] god inside of you
[1:35:52] you won't dress so man attract to you
[1:35:58] and show your body that sounds very
[1:36:00] brazen but it ought to be brazen
[1:36:02] you need to understand the holy god
[1:36:04] won't do that
[1:36:05] and a holy husband this walking in the
[1:36:07] light of the word will recognize it and
[1:36:09] discern it
[1:36:10] and a holy woman that has the holy ghost
[1:36:11] in her won't do that
[1:36:15] it's not something you work up into it's
[1:36:17] a life
[1:36:21] it's a life
[1:36:26] not a put on not an outward show it's
[1:36:29] got to come from your heart
[1:36:34] people can act ever so so pious
[1:36:39] and never have a stitcher revelation of
[1:36:41] the word
[1:36:43] and go to bring in the word and they
[1:36:44] raise up against it what are they
[1:36:45] raising up against
[1:36:48] see all right
[1:36:52] so
[1:36:55] i believe the message was son of god
[1:36:58] i believe it's for the going home of the
[1:36:59] bride i think
[1:37:01] i i want i want more of him every day i
[1:37:04] can't get enough of this message
[1:37:07] it's my life it's my soul it's
[1:37:09] everything that i am it's tied right
[1:37:11] here
[1:37:12] it becomes alive it becomes living it's
[1:37:15] not a
[1:37:16] it's not a dead letter it brings this
[1:37:18] word to life it puts life
[1:37:21] puts life in me it's called me it's
[1:37:22] brought something to life it's
[1:37:25] it's what it what did it do it opened
[1:37:27] the word in me
[1:37:33] it showed me i was always was eternal in
[1:37:36] him
[1:37:37] and it showed me that i am eternal life
[1:37:39] i
[1:37:40] am the resurrection and the life
[1:37:44] not the body not the outward man this is
[1:37:46] dying man but that
[1:37:48] inside soul is risen
[1:37:51] that inside soul is the word living and
[1:37:53] that living word right there
[1:37:55] is transforming me and changing me amen
[1:38:00] it's eternal life that's the record that
[1:38:01] i'm under
[1:38:03] this record i have what about you this
[1:38:05] morning what about you what about you
[1:38:06] young people
[1:38:07] what about you you say i've given my
[1:38:10] heart to the lord and baptized what
[1:38:11] about the holy ghost
[1:38:13] why are you stopping go on and get the
[1:38:15] holy ghost it's for you
[1:38:21] don't just stop there go on and get it
[1:38:24] what'd you come to him for what you
[1:38:26] repent for
[1:38:29] you know i said the promise says you
[1:38:31] shall receive it
[1:38:32] don't let the devil take it from you
[1:38:34] don't let him steal it away go to god
[1:38:36] and say this is my property you gave it
[1:38:38] to me
[1:38:38] i come on the basis of your word
[1:38:42] amen i want the holy ghost or don't live
[1:38:45] anymore
[1:38:45] that's how desperate you got to get
[1:38:47] right i'm not saying this this morning
[1:38:49] to down anybody i'm putting this out to
[1:38:51] make the bride
[1:38:52] realize who she is and where she's
[1:38:54] standing she's sitting in heavenly
[1:38:56] places in christ jesus
[1:38:57] she's up there in the realm of where he
[1:38:59] said she would be
[1:39:01] she is him and he is her
[1:39:11] amen it's it's it's a it's to raise you
[1:39:14] to a higher plane
[1:39:15] it says you discern the differences here
[1:39:18] these differences of these spirits are
[1:39:19] all
[1:39:20] oh they're so kind and oh they're so
[1:39:21] loving be careful what you call love
[1:39:25] because love can be impersonated
[1:39:32] boy that was a good one i just read it
[1:39:36] it wasn't love that wasn't the perfect
[1:39:39] evidence
[1:39:41] you want more all right
[1:39:48] listen he said
[1:39:52] you can't love with your body
[1:39:56] you love with your spirit spirit little
[1:39:59] spirit
[1:40:02] i'm getting a little bit ahead of myself
[1:40:04] right here because there's a lot i want
[1:40:05] to read about that first and second
[1:40:07] realm and third realm all right i
[1:40:10] haven't got there yet
[1:40:11] i probably won't because the time flying
[1:40:15] but i maybe touch here watch he said the
[1:40:18] holy spirit can fall upon a man the holy
[1:40:21] spirit can fall
[1:40:22] upon a man in his spirit
[1:40:25] but his soul is the germ
[1:40:30] that germa is it's either going to be
[1:40:32] the word or isn't the word he's talking
[1:40:33] to believers so the germ is the word he
[1:40:35] said
[1:40:36] all right then he said i don't care how
[1:40:38] much you preach and how well you do this
[1:40:40] and how much you love
[1:40:41] that's one of the inlets to the spirit
[1:40:45] remember five inlets to the spirit one
[1:40:48] of them is love affection love
[1:40:50] filio is conditional
[1:40:53] all right watch what he says
[1:40:57] you can't love with your body you love
[1:40:59] with your spirit that's one of the
[1:41:00] inlets
[1:41:01] you can love and even love god and still
[1:41:04] not
[1:41:04] be right
[1:41:10] amen but there is an action of the holy
[1:41:13] ghost called charity
[1:41:15] the holy ghost is love
[1:41:20] now see how close the two are you can
[1:41:23] have that holy ghost
[1:41:24] right there anointing your spirit
[1:41:28] but what's in the soul
[1:41:31] he said well i have all the works i well
[1:41:33] i believe the word i have the books i
[1:41:35] have
[1:41:35] i have this and well how come you're
[1:41:36] dressing the way you are
[1:41:38] and how come you don't discern the
[1:41:40] differences
[1:41:41] what's happening to your discernment of
[1:41:43] what you're hanging around and who's
[1:41:45] influencing you
[1:41:49] oh you're being influenced
[1:41:53] but they're so kind and they can shout
[1:41:56] they have miracles they can do signs and
[1:41:58] wonders
[1:42:00] i believe every bit of that i'm not
[1:42:02] making fun of that
[1:42:04] i believe i believe that absolutely
[1:42:06] follows the true believer
[1:42:08] but you can have that and not have that
[1:42:11] germ inside of you
[1:42:12] you're not going in a rapture
[1:42:16] it comes to receiving the word it comes
[1:42:19] down to what
[1:42:21] the word has to be revealed to you
[1:42:24] it's the god's own working of revelation
[1:42:28] he reveals himself
[1:42:31] he reveals the word for the hour
[1:42:34] what is the fruit that god's requiring
[1:42:36] today what what makes what makes those
[1:42:38] faults anointed there see you say their
[1:42:40] faults anointed now be careful when you
[1:42:41] say
[1:42:42] that the anointing isn't false
[1:42:45] they are false because they're not the
[1:42:47] word
[1:42:48] they're not the seed of god but the
[1:42:50] anointing isn't false
[1:42:53] but their anointing is the holy spirit
[1:42:56] how many has ever read annoyed once the
[1:42:58] end time
[1:42:58] or knoweth it not
[1:43:01] and this message right here man brother
[1:43:04] branham especially over and over and
[1:43:06] over and over again the later on the
[1:43:08] years that he preached
[1:43:09] he got into that more and more and more
[1:43:11] almost every message
[1:43:12] he was showing you the difference what
[1:43:14] was it dude dividing asunder
[1:43:18] because he said those spirits will be
[1:43:20] that close
[1:43:21] because they're both anointed with the
[1:43:22] genuine holy ghost
[1:43:25] and these signs and wonders prophesy
[1:43:28] cast out devils they'll come to him in
[1:43:29] that day haven't we prophesied in your
[1:43:31] name
[1:43:31] haven't we cast out devils in your name
[1:43:33] and he said i won't even i don't even
[1:43:35] know you
[1:43:36] depart for me i don't know you you
[1:43:38] weren't mine to begin with
[1:43:40] but yeah you you count you you you were
[1:43:43] contented on the fact that you could
[1:43:44] shout you could
[1:43:45] you could say this you could do that you
[1:43:47] could get up you could be anointed you
[1:43:49] could see
[1:43:50] visions or even speak in tongues and
[1:43:52] even prophesy
[1:43:56] amen and you still don't know him
[1:44:04] how do you know him you're his seed
[1:44:08] it has to come through the word
[1:44:12] but watch how these two things are so
[1:44:14] close down here
[1:44:16] you say that scares us brother david i'm
[1:44:17] not trying to scare you but it ought to
[1:44:19] put a desperation
[1:44:20] in your heart that you want to know that
[1:44:21] you know that you know that you
[1:44:23] are him that you're a part of him
[1:44:28] that you're sure of where you're
[1:44:29] standing
[1:44:32] and you have a right to be sure god's
[1:44:34] expecting you to go to his word and find
[1:44:35] out
[1:44:36] god reveal this word to me open it to me
[1:44:39] lord
[1:44:40] reveal it let it be more than just a
[1:44:43] letter let it become reality
[1:44:44] let it become a reality more than just a
[1:44:46] word let it be a reality to me
[1:44:48] let it become in me let it become my
[1:44:50] life my living
[1:44:51] let it be the original
[1:44:54] life
[1:45:00] you see that's what the devil doesn't
[1:45:02] want you to get
[1:45:03] he can he can impersonate any one of
[1:45:05] those gifts
[1:45:09] he can be he can be he can be in a
[1:45:12] person's soul
[1:45:13] that devil working down there just like
[1:45:15] judas and cast out devils
[1:45:21] i didn't hear any men much on that
[1:45:24] that's what the word said
[1:45:26] but but he couldn't go to pentecost
[1:45:30] to receive the life of that word
[1:45:36] you say i've got the life of the word
[1:45:37] because i shouted and i danced i spoke
[1:45:39] in tongue the holy spirit came on me and
[1:45:40] prophesied
[1:45:41] how come your prophecy's off the word
[1:45:43] then
[1:45:47] how come it doesn't dovetail with the
[1:45:48] word
[1:45:50] and even could dovetail with the word
[1:45:52] and you could prophesy according to the
[1:45:54] word
[1:45:55] well see there i've got the holy ghost
[1:45:56] no you don't that's no evidence
[1:46:01] now that's brought it right down flat
[1:46:03] didn't it
[1:46:04] what is the evidence revealing of the
[1:46:08] word for the season to you it's the
[1:46:10] opening of the word to you
[1:46:15] the fruit is the fruit of the season the
[1:46:18] prophet said
[1:46:28] brother brahms said last sunday we were
[1:46:30] going on those cycles about how the five
[1:46:32] senses on the outer realm
[1:46:34] the inlet five senses see taste feel
[1:46:36] smell here on the outer realm the inlet
[1:46:38] five senses to the body
[1:46:40] there's only one way you can get into
[1:46:41] the body that's those five senses
[1:46:44] see taste feel smell here he said
[1:46:45] there's no other way to contact the body
[1:46:47] on the inside of that man is called
[1:46:49] spirit
[1:46:51] you are spirit man all right he said in
[1:46:54] the inside that man is called
[1:46:56] spirit and he said
[1:47:02] and and and el he has also five
[1:47:05] senses that contact the spirit he said
[1:47:08] think thought
[1:47:09] love conscience so forth
[1:47:12] now you could read them right out
[1:47:14] imagination reasoning memory conscious
[1:47:16] affection
[1:47:17] is that right five senses
[1:47:22] all right now you he says now you can't
[1:47:25] think with your body
[1:47:28] you think with your mind that's spirit
[1:47:31] realm
[1:47:32] and in there he said and in there where
[1:47:34] in that spirit is where too many
[1:47:36] christians only stop
[1:47:42] be sanctified i don't drink i don't
[1:47:45] smoke
[1:47:46] i feel good i can shout
[1:47:50] i'm good to my parents i'm good to this
[1:47:52] i'm good to that i keep all the
[1:47:53] commandments
[1:47:54] but the one thing i'm lacking
[1:48:01] all right now he said
[1:48:04] he said you can he said to be anointed
[1:48:06] they can be anointed with the same holy
[1:48:09] spirit now
[1:48:09] in there too many christians only stop
[1:48:11] and they just take like the corn in the
[1:48:13] field
[1:48:13] and the corn in the field and the weed
[1:48:16] in the field
[1:48:17] two seeds they can be anointed with the
[1:48:21] same holy spirit
[1:48:22] that the real believer is anointed with
[1:48:30] but down on the inside of that that next
[1:48:33] realm the third realm
[1:48:34] is the soul right
[1:48:38] and that's predestinated by god there is
[1:48:41] where the real
[1:48:42] sea germ lays is in there
[1:48:48] that's why brother branham said you
[1:48:50] could have the holy ghost the baptism
[1:48:51] even
[1:48:52] on your spirit but it never it could
[1:48:54] fall on you it could come right fall on
[1:48:55] you baptized
[1:48:56] but if that seed germ is laying in that
[1:48:58] soul there will never be a birth of the
[1:49:00] word
[1:49:04] amen but it'll be it'll it'll bring
[1:49:07] forth it'll bring that
[1:49:08] whatever it is in the soul to
[1:49:10] manifestation and you'll be
[1:49:11] and you'll be very religious go on
[1:49:15] do miracle signs and wonders
[1:49:19] but never able to receive the word
[1:49:22] never able to see the word for your
[1:49:24] season and your time
[1:49:29] yeah that's close isn't it that's close
[1:49:32] that's how those two spirits are so
[1:49:34] close
[1:49:36] amen they come from two different seeds
[1:49:38] but they're that close
[1:49:40] because the rain and the sun fell on
[1:49:42] both
[1:49:46] is that right hebrews 6 matthew 5
[1:49:50] the rain falls on the just the unjust
[1:49:53] now i'm going to have to skip a lot here
[1:49:54] and i want to go to one place
[1:49:56] and then i'm going to have to close
[1:49:57] we'll come back with this is that all
[1:49:59] right
[1:50:00] i just i can't there's things in the
[1:50:02] church age books that i've got to get to
[1:50:05] and i can't do it this morning but i
[1:50:07] want to give this to you
[1:50:08] see so confused he said i'm the baptist
[1:50:11] see see
[1:50:12] on the evidence and remember if i take a
[1:50:14] cup of water cut it open graft into the
[1:50:16] heart of a wheat
[1:50:18] and put it in there bury it now watch
[1:50:20] this is this is good because this is
[1:50:21] exactly what's the bride
[1:50:23] you say you look at old brother david
[1:50:25] out here you might look at old jacob and
[1:50:26] he was an old cuckleberg
[1:50:28] but one day jacob met god
[1:50:32] and there was there was a quickened word
[1:50:34] down inside of him
[1:50:35] and jacob was changed yet he looked like
[1:50:39] jacob
[1:50:42] that looked like the badger that was
[1:50:45] looked like the huckleberry but
[1:50:47] the life of the culkeber wasn't there
[1:50:48] anymore
[1:50:50] amen oh it still worked in his flesh i'm
[1:50:52] sure he got
[1:50:53] upset sometimes and but what changed
[1:50:57] down in the germ
[1:50:59] where's that inside of the inside what's
[1:51:01] that little holiest of holies in there
[1:51:03] what's laying inside of there
[1:51:07] determines who you are amen
[1:51:11] what can it receive can it receive by
[1:51:14] revelation can it receive can it hear
[1:51:16] the word for the season an hour
[1:51:18] are you feeding on this word and my it
[1:51:20] just keeps opening opening and you say
[1:51:22] well that's just ministry that's not
[1:51:23] just ministry brother sister
[1:51:25] that's you
[1:51:30] amen it just keeps opening and you just
[1:51:32] can't get enough of it and tomorrow
[1:51:34] there's more
[1:51:34] and the next day there's more and
[1:51:36] there's more and there's more and
[1:51:37] there's more he said lord i can't hardly
[1:51:39] take any more of this
[1:51:40] my body's got to give way
[1:51:44] oh you say brother david that's just a
[1:51:46] story no it isn't a story
[1:51:48] that's the truth
[1:51:51] and we're very close and i'm praying a
[1:51:54] message like this because these things
[1:51:55] brother braham said must
[1:51:57] be preached on it's what he said
[1:52:01] the very thing i'm talking about this
[1:52:02] morning he said these things must be
[1:52:04] preached on
[1:52:05] because the devil we're going through
[1:52:06] trouble sometimes where and we see it
[1:52:09] down here the things come
[1:52:10] completely insane we're right on the
[1:52:12] edge of it you see it
[1:52:13] you see now israel's in an uproar they
[1:52:15] can't even get leadership back there
[1:52:17] anymore they've had four elections they
[1:52:19] can't even find a leader
[1:52:20] god's saying i'm your leader but what's
[1:52:22] happening it's opening the door for rome
[1:52:24] to step in
[1:52:27] where are we at where are
[1:52:31] see how close those two spirits but i'm
[1:52:34] talking to the bride this morning
[1:52:37] what's in your soul
[1:52:43] what's been what's what's dividing here
[1:52:45] what's god
[1:52:46] showing you he's showing you who you are
[1:52:50] he's opening the window to that seventh
[1:52:52] seal that's been open
[1:52:54] he's trying to get you to see the seal's
[1:52:56] been tore back it's that little rock
[1:52:57] underneath the rock brother brown said
[1:52:59] it was the rock beneath the rock
[1:53:06] that's not my quote that's his
[1:53:10] he said that's what's that's what's
[1:53:12] unveiled
[1:53:13] and he said i had to go west to get the
[1:53:15] revelation of that
[1:53:17] what was written there was unwritten
[1:53:19] word but i had to go to rail
[1:53:21] i had to go west to get the revelation
[1:53:23] and bring it back
[1:53:26] and when i saw the seventh seal opened
[1:53:27] it went to those thunders
[1:53:30] and brother branham said see the seventh
[1:53:32] seal was what jesus said he didn't know
[1:53:35] but brother branham said when he when
[1:53:37] the book of revelations was written
[1:53:39] when he come to his complete revelation
[1:53:41] of himself that was no more a mystery
[1:53:44] amen it was unveiled so he said then
[1:53:48] but what's he say brother david what
[1:53:49] would we don't know we don't know the
[1:53:51] day or the moment of our body change
[1:53:54] but we see his coming
[1:53:58] what's it consummated in appearing in
[1:54:01] the air
[1:54:04] there's something happening in the bride
[1:54:06] that's maturing
[1:54:08] they're laying in the presence of the
[1:54:10] sun ripening
[1:54:13] the next thing left is a meeting in the
[1:54:14] air
[1:54:16] but he had to come to unite with his
[1:54:18] bride because there had to be a
[1:54:19] spiritual uniting
[1:54:24] now that's a lot of statement it's one
[1:54:26] small lump there
[1:54:27] but i still want to get into some of
[1:54:29] that here but i
[1:54:30] but lord help us
[1:54:35] let me just get into one thing will you
[1:54:36] bear with me about 15 more minutes let
[1:54:38] me just get into one thing here
[1:54:41] i'm not looking for an answer i'm just
[1:54:43] asking
[1:54:49] in the message church age book i mean
[1:54:54] paragraph or page it's about page 166 i
[1:54:58] think it is
[1:55:00] let me just say bring something that
[1:55:01] brother brown said here
[1:55:03] there's a lot more to go there's a lot
[1:55:06] more
[1:55:15] now he's referring to first corinthians
[1:55:17] 12 7 let's go over there just a minute
[1:55:20] first corinthians 12 7.
[1:55:28] i'm just happy for the mysteries have
[1:55:30] been opened
[1:55:32] these things are all loose ended and god
[1:55:35] by his grace has just taken these things
[1:55:37] and
[1:55:37] opened them right up how many know as
[1:55:40] you walk with god things are getting
[1:55:42] clearer
[1:55:42] and clearer and all the time more
[1:55:44] personal
[1:55:46] more personal more personal more
[1:55:49] personal
[1:55:50] a personal revelation all right
[1:55:54] then in first corinthians 12 7 he says
[1:55:57] but the manifestation of the spirit
[1:56:00] is given to every man to profit with all
[1:56:05] watch what he says here
[1:56:09] he reads that scripture and then he says
[1:56:11] now comes
[1:56:12] now comes this very good question
[1:56:15] why isn't the manifestation and evidence
[1:56:18] of being baptized with the holy ghost
[1:56:24] because you surely could not manifest
[1:56:26] the holy ghost he says
[1:56:28] speaking of what somebody else said
[1:56:29] because surely you couldn't manifest the
[1:56:31] holy ghost unless you were
[1:56:32] you truly were spirit-filled brother bam
[1:56:35] says now i wish i could say that is
[1:56:37] right
[1:56:40] because i don't like to hurt people or
[1:56:42] walk on their doctrine
[1:56:44] but i wouldn't be a true servant of god
[1:56:46] if i didn't tell you the whole counsel
[1:56:47] of god
[1:56:48] that is right is it not just let us take
[1:56:51] a look at
[1:56:52] look at balaam he was religious he
[1:56:53] worshipped god he understood the proper
[1:56:56] method of sacrificing
[1:56:57] and approach unto god but he was not a
[1:57:00] true seed
[1:57:01] prophet for he took the wages of
[1:57:03] unrighteousness and worst of all he led
[1:57:05] the children of god
[1:57:06] into sins of fornication and idolatry
[1:57:09] i could spend a lot of time right there
[1:57:13] but we won't all right
[1:57:17] yet who would dare to deny that the
[1:57:21] spirit of god manifested through him
[1:57:24] in one of the most beautiful portions of
[1:57:26] absolute accurate prophecy
[1:57:28] the world has ever seen but he never had
[1:57:30] the holy ghost
[1:57:35] okay now then what do you think of
[1:57:38] caiaphas the high priest
[1:57:40] the bible said he prophesied the kind of
[1:57:43] death the lord would die
[1:57:44] we all know there's no record of him
[1:57:46] being a spirit-filled and spirit-led man
[1:57:49] as dear old simeon or sweet saint called
[1:57:52] anna
[1:57:53] yet he had a genuine manifestation of
[1:57:56] the holy ghost
[1:57:57] we can't deny that so where is
[1:58:00] manifestation
[1:58:01] as an evidence it isn't there
[1:58:07] see how fine the line it comes down to
[1:58:09] see why we needed the word to come into
[1:58:11] full
[1:58:12] unveiling a complete revelation today
[1:58:17] god thank god for sending us his word
[1:58:20] through a prophet because we had still
[1:58:22] been in the we've still been doing what
[1:58:24] we thought was right
[1:58:25] every man doing what they think is right
[1:58:27] there had to be some
[1:58:29] absolute come forth vindicated by god
[1:58:32] that had the word of god for the age
[1:58:35] perfectly vindicated
[1:58:39] if you still got questions about whether
[1:58:41] the message is right
[1:58:43] you get down before god desperately
[1:58:48] all right
[1:58:52] so where is the manifestation of it
[1:58:54] evidence it isn't as evidence it isn't
[1:58:55] there
[1:58:56] if you truly if you are true watch what
[1:58:58] he says if you are truly filled with the
[1:59:00] spirit of god you will have the
[1:59:02] evidence of the word in your life
[1:59:07] all right let me and then he goes on
[1:59:19] and he talks about he begins to talk
[1:59:21] about what he meant in
[1:59:23] in in was it not chautauqua indiana
[1:59:27] um where he met the pentecostal people
[1:59:29] in his earlier years
[1:59:31] was it chautauqua i think it was the
[1:59:33] chautauqua
[1:59:35] anyway no it doesn't sound right anyway
[1:59:37] in indiana you know what he's referring
[1:59:39] to
[1:59:40] he saw the manifestation holy holy
[1:59:41] spirit one would say
[1:59:43] one would speak the other would prophesy
[1:59:46] misha walker that's it
[1:59:47] that sounds similar yeah misha walker
[1:59:51] remember he talking about that okay i
[1:59:53] won't read all that
[1:59:54] one he saw was a real hypocrite both
[1:59:57] prophesying both speaking in tongues and
[1:59:59] be right
[2:00:01] all right and he saw and and and both
[2:00:04] manifesting and both were manifesting
[2:00:07] the spirit in gifts
[2:00:10] right all right and i sought god for the
[2:00:14] answer and he went to his
[2:00:15] you know he went to where his cave was
[2:00:17] and he read hebrews 6 4-9
[2:00:20] it's impossible those were once
[2:00:22] enlightened have tasted the heavenly
[2:00:23] gift
[2:00:24] and were made partakers of the holy
[2:00:25] ghost now that ought to tell you right
[2:00:27] there see
[2:00:28] they tasted but no revelation they had a
[2:00:31] taste
[2:00:32] they come and partook of it are you with
[2:00:35] me
[2:00:35] they could be anointed in their spirit
[2:00:38] the holy ghost could fall right in their
[2:00:39] spirit
[2:00:40] amen but if that seed germs not in that
[2:00:42] soul
[2:00:43] there's nothing there's nothing of the
[2:00:44] word to quicken there so they don't have
[2:00:46] the word in their life
[2:00:49] they have manifestation that's the
[2:00:51] difference now watch and he said
[2:00:54] here he says now so it's impossible for
[2:00:57] those lightened they shall fall away to
[2:00:59] renew themselves again to repentance
[2:01:00] seeing they crucify themselves the
[2:01:02] son of god afresh and put him to an open
[2:01:04] shame for the earth which drinketh in
[2:01:06] the rain that cometh off upon it
[2:01:07] bringeth forth herbs meat for them by
[2:01:09] whom it is dressed
[2:01:10] receiveth blessing from god but that
[2:01:12] which beareth thorns and briars
[2:01:14] is rejected and nigh into cursing
[2:01:18] see watch now we're in the we're in the
[2:01:20] day now of maturity
[2:01:22] these things this is harvest time
[2:01:27] amen it takes the holy spirit to
[2:01:29] recognize
[2:01:30] that wild wheat that's why you see many
[2:01:34] people in the sad
[2:01:35] because there's many people in the
[2:01:36] message still flirting around with wild
[2:01:38] wheat
[2:01:41] because they have manifestation of the
[2:01:42] spirit in their life
[2:01:44] but they're a denominational hybrid
[2:01:49] you say why can't they discern that why
[2:01:50] can't they see that why can't they see
[2:01:52] that that's wrong
[2:01:53] that thing is leading them down the
[2:01:54] wrong path and they're flirting and
[2:01:56] press and pressing it to everybody
[2:01:57] else and it's bringing things into an
[2:02:00] assembly that fights the true word of
[2:02:02] god
[2:02:04] brother sister i'm not just speaking
[2:02:06] thing i know what i'm saying
[2:02:11] and it fights that why because there's
[2:02:13] no discernment there of what's right and
[2:02:15] what isn't
[2:02:16] why because the holy ghost has to be
[2:02:18] there
[2:02:20] where in the soul
[2:02:24] the control room in the soul
[2:02:27] because your spirit can be anointed
[2:02:30] and it anoints the body to do these
[2:02:32] things
[2:02:34] but what's in that soul is going to
[2:02:36] control the whole thing
[2:02:44] i hope that left you here this is this i
[2:02:46] believe the bride knows what i'm talking
[2:02:47] about
[2:02:49] it's just here it's an encouragement to
[2:02:51] you it's not to discourage you
[2:02:53] it's trying to bring a desperation to
[2:02:54] you young people that have such a
[2:02:56] burning desire for more of god
[2:02:58] then get down to business with him
[2:03:03] get in dude everything you know that he
[2:03:05] said to do and now say lord and come to
[2:03:07] him on the basis of the word
[2:03:08] and now you said you would fill me if
[2:03:11] i've been
[2:03:12] i know who's filled and who isn't but
[2:03:14] don't stop at sanctification
[2:03:16] don't stop there go on have you received
[2:03:19] the holy ghost since
[2:03:20] you believed
[2:03:25] amen have you received the holy ghost
[2:03:27] since you believe
[2:03:30] i know what it is as a young person to
[2:03:32] receive the holy ghost
[2:03:33] it's kept me for 60 plus
[2:03:37] years and it hasn't stopped
[2:03:40] it just gets clearer and clearer and
[2:03:43] clearer and more revealed
[2:03:44] all the time
[2:03:48] why because there was a thirst and a
[2:03:50] hunger for god inside of me
[2:03:54] i knew there was a true baptism of the
[2:03:57] holy spirit
[2:03:58] and when that happened and i took the
[2:04:00] steps of the word
[2:04:02] then the word began to open to me then
[2:04:05] the word began to be revealed to me
[2:04:09] i'm a living testimony of that
[2:04:13] i know that's true
[2:04:16] you say well that's just deep it's too
[2:04:18] deep the prophet said with the bible
[2:04:21] said with the deep things of god we
[2:04:22] should feed upon it's hid from the wise
[2:04:24] and prudent and revealed to babes
[2:04:26] that could receive it
[2:04:32] don't pass it off as just something well
[2:04:34] it's just too deep i don't need that
[2:04:37] be careful
[2:04:42] let's go on a little further i'm i'm
[2:04:44] past my time now am i right at the time
[2:04:46] now let's let's i want to get down to a
[2:04:47] point here
[2:04:49] so they so he's telling that story he
[2:04:52] comes down
[2:04:56] and he saw and he saw in a vision how
[2:04:58] why man in white had gone forth sowing
[2:05:00] seed
[2:05:01] then a man in black came stealthily
[2:05:03] sowing
[2:05:04] some more seed amongst the man in white
[2:05:07] had sown now we've had that same thing
[2:05:09] happen today
[2:05:10] we've had the sowing of the son of man
[2:05:12] sowed his word is that right
[2:05:14] got to the bride first then we've had
[2:05:16] this stealthful man coming in behind
[2:05:19] them
[2:05:19] through ministry the man the spirit it's
[2:05:21] the spirit brother sister i've had
[2:05:23] nothing against nobody
[2:05:24] it's a spirit
[2:05:29] working come right behind that and sowed
[2:05:34] oh i still believe the message praise
[2:05:36] god i believe the message
[2:05:38] and some of those men don't even believe
[2:05:39] the message anymore what's happened
[2:05:41] no revelation
[2:05:45] wrong seed couldn't well they could
[2:05:49] preach like a house of fire
[2:05:51] a lot better preachers than what i am
[2:05:53] that's for sure
[2:05:55] amen but they couldn't receive the truth
[2:05:59] for the hour of the day they couldn't
[2:06:00] see it
[2:06:05] how can you be in the word a part of the
[2:06:07] word and deny the word
[2:06:09] it's impossible you can't be in the word
[2:06:12] himself
[2:06:13] and deny the word
[2:06:17] he can't have the revelation of himself
[2:06:19] laying in your soul
[2:06:21] oh you might have a feel-good experience
[2:06:23] i'm talking about the word revealed
[2:06:26] something you not hope you got you know
[2:06:28] you have
[2:06:30] what i'm telling you this morning is not
[2:06:32] i hope i've got it right
[2:06:33] it you know you've got it you look for a
[2:06:36] knowing not to say well if i do this if
[2:06:38] i do that i've got it i'm trying
[2:06:39] god's trying to make it very clear to
[2:06:41] you where the evidence is
[2:06:47] he that has an ear i haven't even got to
[2:06:48] john 8
[2:06:50] you're not of god because you don't hear
[2:06:52] my word
[2:06:55] think of that i can't go there i'm too
[2:06:58] late
[2:06:59] you pray for me if i can get back with
[2:07:01] this i will
[2:07:02] but you know what dig in the word won't
[2:07:05] you just start
[2:07:06] digging it's all laying right there go
[2:07:09] to the message start reading the
[2:07:10] scriptures
[2:07:11] go to what the prophet refers to open
[2:07:13] the word ask god for revelation
[2:07:15] ask god to fill you every day daily
[2:07:19] fill you and refill you revelation
[2:07:23] upon revelation upon revelation
[2:07:26] that's a work of the holy ghost
[2:07:32] ask him to open the word to you open
[2:07:35] what's in your heart
[2:07:36] he said a message for what purpose to
[2:07:38] unveil the mystery
[2:07:40] in your heart bride
[2:07:43] he would turn the heart
[2:07:47] christ the mystery of god revealed
[2:07:50] christ in you the mystery
[2:07:56] the finish mystery the complete mystery
[2:08:00] of adam the complete mystery of the
[2:08:01] second adam
[2:08:02] the full revelation of himself
[2:08:07] amen amen
[2:08:19] so he saw that happen and he saw that he
[2:08:22] saw the
[2:08:23] the little plants that uh the skies
[2:08:25] turned the brass and all the plants
[2:08:27] began to droop and die
[2:08:29] and i and i heard the wheat life i heard
[2:08:31] though excuse me the wheat lift their
[2:08:32] heads and cried to god for rain
[2:08:35] the tares also lift their voices and
[2:08:37] pleaded for rain
[2:08:38] and the skies darkened and the rain came
[2:08:40] and again the wheat
[2:08:41] now full of strength lift their voices
[2:08:43] and cried in adoration praise the lord
[2:08:46] and to my wonderment i i heard the
[2:08:49] revived tares
[2:08:50] also look up and say hallelujah
[2:08:59] oh there's so much more to say but the
[2:09:01] word in your life
[2:09:04] i'm not against saying hallelujah i love
[2:09:06] to say hallelujah
[2:09:07] something in you that'll say amen
[2:09:12] but if that's all you've got and all
[2:09:13] you're relying upon it's got to be the
[2:09:15] word living
[2:09:19] got to be the word living it's got to be
[2:09:22] a birth of the word there
[2:09:25] what a resurrection this is
[2:09:29] amen all right and he said
[2:09:36] they write they cried hallelujah then i
[2:09:39] knew the truth of the camp meeting see
[2:09:41] and the evident manifestation of
[2:09:43] spiritual gifts in a mixed audience all
[2:09:44] became wonderfully clear
[2:09:46] the sore in white was the lord the sower
[2:09:48] in black was the devil
[2:09:49] the world was the field the seeds were
[2:09:51] people elect and reprobate
[2:09:53] both partook of the same nourishment
[2:09:55] water and sun both prayed
[2:09:57] both received help from god and let me
[2:09:59] say this both believe the message
[2:10:02] or claim to amen
[2:10:07] one went off a little bit here because
[2:10:08] he can't take it word by word
[2:10:11] watch what he said satan can't remember
[2:10:13] satan can
[2:10:14] impersonate but he cannot there's one
[2:10:16] thing he cannot impersonate that's that
[2:10:18] third poll
[2:10:21] because he can't receive it he said he
[2:10:24] can't get it
[2:10:25] it's kept from him
[2:10:29] and he can't place that word by word or
[2:10:31] the original word and he can't do that
[2:10:34] it'd be an original seed and he's not
[2:10:35] the seed
[2:10:38] you see how close it is all right
[2:10:41] but it's not going to deceive the
[2:10:42] elected why
[2:10:45] because she is the word
[2:10:51] she's the word open she's the word
[2:10:53] revealed
[2:10:54] that's what the seven seals were sent to
[2:10:57] to do
[2:10:59] seal her away
[2:11:03] what are the opening little seven seals
[2:11:04] revealing christ
[2:11:07] are who are those seven seals christ
[2:11:09] who's the revealing of what is the
[2:11:10] revealing of the seals then
[2:11:12] christ
[2:11:15] amen all right
[2:11:18] they both took partook of the same
[2:11:21] nourishment
[2:11:22] water and son both prayed both received
[2:11:24] help from god
[2:11:25] for he maketh his son to and don't you
[2:11:28] ever judge your life by how many
[2:11:30] miracles and signs and wonders you can
[2:11:32] do
[2:11:33] how many of us knew prophet said that
[2:11:35] don't ever judge your life by that
[2:11:38] how many devils you can cast out he said
[2:11:41] there's people that will pray there are
[2:11:43] places to pray
[2:11:44] others cast out devils sister come to
[2:11:47] him one time and said i can't i just
[2:11:48] wish brother
[2:11:49] brother brahma cast out david said that
[2:11:51] isn't your place to cast the devil out
[2:11:53] your place was to pray others were
[2:11:55] casting them out
[2:11:59] so you can't put confidence in that and
[2:12:02] yet i believe every bit of that
[2:12:04] you know i do well i believe in casting
[2:12:07] out a devil
[2:12:07] i've seen many devils cast out just
[2:12:09] yesterday afternoon one was cast out
[2:12:11] over the phone
[2:12:13] one that morning yesterday morning
[2:12:14] another one's cast out
[2:12:19] that's the authority of the word
[2:12:22] i've given that to you but just because
[2:12:25] you have that you see there's more to it
[2:12:30] i'm not diminishing that please
[2:12:32] understand me that's good i'm trying to
[2:12:34] show you the evidence
[2:12:37] of being filled with the holy ghost you
[2:12:39] can be anointed to do that there's only
[2:12:40] one thing that can cast out a devil
[2:12:42] that's god
[2:12:44] the holy spirit does it that's why the
[2:12:45] manifestation of the holy spirit is with
[2:12:47] all
[2:12:48] prophet with all all are profited by it
[2:12:51] but it's not the evidence i just read it
[2:12:53] to you
[2:12:54] all right okay
[2:12:58] and those gifts should be working in an
[2:12:59] assembly
[2:13:01] absolutely but where's the true evidence
[2:13:03] slay
[2:13:09] the seeds were people okay and though
[2:13:12] they both had the same wonderful
[2:13:14] blessing both had the same wonderful
[2:13:15] manifestations
[2:13:17] there was still that one great
[2:13:20] difference anybody tell me what it was
[2:13:24] they were of different seed
[2:13:28] that's the difference
[2:13:31] right there and that's not a thing you
[2:13:35] can do about that
[2:13:36] nor i so there's nothing i can boast it
[2:13:39] will look at what i got
[2:13:41] no way we're identifying the seed of god
[2:13:48] and the seed of the serpent and the seed
[2:13:50] of the devils being also exposed
[2:13:52] that's what the seals did
[2:13:56] all right the opening i should say of
[2:13:58] them revealing
[2:13:59] here was the answer matthew 7 21-23 not
[2:14:02] everyone that saith me lord lord shall
[2:14:04] enter the kingdom of god
[2:14:05] or heaven but he that doeth the will of
[2:14:08] my father doeth the will of my father
[2:14:10] which is in heaven
[2:14:11] many will say to me in that day lord
[2:14:13] lord have we not prophesied my name
[2:14:15] in thy name cast out devils and in thy
[2:14:17] name done wonderful many wonderful works
[2:14:19] and then i'll profess them i never knew
[2:14:21] you depart for me you worker of iniquity
[2:14:24] jesus does not deny they did the mighty
[2:14:27] works that only the holy ghost can
[2:14:29] accomplish by the way of men
[2:14:31] but he did deny ever knowing them
[2:14:34] these weren't backsliders
[2:14:38] he said these were wicked they weren't
[2:14:40] backsliders these were wicked
[2:14:42] unregenerate reprobates
[2:14:43] that were the seed of satan
[2:14:48] and and there it is you can't claim the
[2:14:50] manifestation of the evidence of being
[2:14:52] spirit born and spirit-filled
[2:14:54] no sir i will admit that the true
[2:14:58] manifestation of the evidence of the
[2:14:59] holy spirit doing mighty acts is is
[2:15:01] doing mighty acts
[2:15:02] but it is not the evidence of the
[2:15:04] individual being spirit filled
[2:15:06] even though the individual has an
[2:15:08] abundance of those manifestations
[2:15:11] the evidence of receiving the holy ghost
[2:15:13] today is just the same as it was back in
[2:15:15] the day of our lord
[2:15:16] it is receiving the word of truth for
[2:15:19] the day
[2:15:20] in which you live jesus never did stress
[2:15:23] the importance of works
[2:15:24] as he did the word he knew that if the
[2:15:27] people got the word
[2:15:28] the works would follow
[2:15:36] how do you get the word he reveals it
[2:15:40] amen
[2:15:47] anointed one's the end time these trees
[2:15:50] the true vine and the false fine you've
[2:15:51] heard me preach on that from years ago
[2:15:53] how they growed up together brought them
[2:15:55] in in individuals and showed that from
[2:15:57] cain and abel
[2:15:58] the two vines that met in an altar both
[2:16:00] of them religious
[2:16:01] both of them anointed both of them
[2:16:04] desiring life
[2:16:05] and worshipping the same god and one was
[2:16:08] rejected and the other received
[2:16:10] and the only way that one that was
[2:16:12] received could have done anything
[2:16:13] different from his brother
[2:16:15] it was revealed to him
[2:16:18] for the bible said by faith hebrews 11
[2:16:21] chapter by faith
[2:16:22] abel offered unto god a more excellent
[2:16:25] sacrifice than that of cain
[2:16:26] which god testified he was righteous
[2:16:28] jesus said the spirit
[2:16:30] jesus said the spiritual revelation of
[2:16:33] who he was
[2:16:35] what does who does man say i the son of
[2:16:37] man am
[2:16:38] peter said thou art the christ the son
[2:16:40] of the living god blessed art thou simon
[2:16:42] son of jonas flesh and blood never
[2:16:43] revealed this to you
[2:16:45] my father which is in heaven has
[2:16:46] revealed it
[2:16:48] has revealed it upon this revelation a
[2:16:50] rock i'll build my church
[2:16:52] what is the true revelation of the word
[2:16:54] there is the vine again
[2:16:55] abel there is the true vine again able
[2:16:59] by faith you said it wasn't revelation
[2:17:04] the prophet says what is faith faith is
[2:17:06] something that's revealed to you
[2:17:09] that is not yet but you believe it will
[2:17:11] be faith is a revelation of the will of
[2:17:13] god so
[2:17:14] by revelation and the churches don't
[2:17:17] even believe in spiritual revelation
[2:17:19] they believe in a dogmatic teaching of
[2:17:21] some system
[2:17:22] by revelation abel offered unto god a
[2:17:24] more excellent sacrifice than that of
[2:17:26] cain
[2:17:27] which god testified he was righteous and
[2:17:30] i hope you see that
[2:17:31] where are we living see the hour
[2:17:37] he said i talked to a gentleman not long
[2:17:39] ago christian scholar gentleman he said
[2:17:40] mr branham we refuse
[2:17:42] all revelation i said then you have to
[2:17:44] refuse jesus christ
[2:17:46] for he is the revelation of god god
[2:17:48] revealed in human flesh unless you see
[2:17:50] it you're lost
[2:17:53] brother braham said when you see the
[2:17:55] word made flesh you're seeing light
[2:17:58] all right he said except you believe
[2:18:00] that i am he you will die in your sins
[2:18:03] amen he is the revelation of god the
[2:18:06] spirit of god revealed in human form
[2:18:09] if you can't believe that you're lost
[2:18:12] you put him a third person second person
[2:18:14] or any other person besides god your
[2:18:16] loss
[2:18:16] except you believe that i am he you will
[2:18:19] die in your sins
[2:18:21] a revelation no wonder they couldn't see
[2:18:24] him
[2:18:25] see him no man can come to me except my
[2:18:28] father draws him
[2:18:29] that's revelation 6 37 44 and all the
[2:18:33] father has given me
[2:18:34] in the roots will come to me
[2:18:37] you get it oh how we should love him
[2:18:40] adore him praise him
[2:18:41] see the fruit of the spirit in the last
[2:18:43] days the bride tree ripening

[2:19:42] our pastor said go listen to it
[2:19:46] there's on and on there's many many
[2:19:48] messages he preached that same thing
[2:19:50] over and over again bringing you down
[2:19:53] dividing asunder
[2:19:54] showing the difference showing what the
[2:19:56] evidence is
[2:19:59] amen having an ear to hear the word
[2:20:03] the ability is given by god it's not you
[2:20:05] see and it's only revealed to a special
[2:20:07] class of people
[2:20:08] i had the quote here on that
[2:20:11] and that special class of people is
[2:20:13] those that have the ability given of god
[2:20:15] to hear their word or hear receive it
[2:20:17] and then prophet says right there they
[2:20:18] receive it by revelation

[2:20:24] they have prophetic insight that's
[2:20:25] revealed to them

[2:20:30] the word
