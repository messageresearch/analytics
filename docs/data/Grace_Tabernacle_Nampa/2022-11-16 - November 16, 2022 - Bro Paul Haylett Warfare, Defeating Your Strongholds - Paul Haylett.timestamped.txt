[25:01] the same
[25:06] there's only

[25:23] name
[25:25] oh touching Jesus

[26:36] when
[26:39] hold on
[26:42] his name
[26:45] and truly saints that is all that
[26:48] matters
[26:49] amen we can
[26:52] I just
[26:54] you know sometimes when you just pass
[26:56] along the compliment to the Lord it
[26:59] sounds like you're complimenting men but
[27:01] we would just add a scripture to the
[27:04] song service tonight we could dismiss
[27:07] because it truly is everything that was
[27:09] on my heart
[27:11] and uh
[27:13] even to the point of remembering brother
[27:16] Joshua and brother Mason
[27:19] going through some struggles going
[27:21] through a a valley going through a oh
[27:25] you know I remember
[27:28] I remember reading in one of those
[27:31] little history books his sister Sue
[27:33] bought me
[27:34] somebody asked this man who had been in
[27:36] the World War II in the war in Africa
[27:40] and he said what was the thing that was
[27:42] the most terrifying to you during the
[27:45] war
[27:47] and he said the most terrifying thing to
[27:50] me in the war was not being shot at
[27:52] was not the the artillery and not the
[27:56] charge of all of this
[27:58] but to be literally a few hundred miles
[28:01] from anywhere in the desert in Africa
[28:05] and he said I saw the absolute majesty
[28:08] and power of God
[28:10] in a sandstorm
[28:13] and he said it was so thick so dark and
[28:16] so so just destructive
[28:20] he said I was sure I was dying
[28:23] and he said in Warfare you don't think
[28:25] about it you just react but when you're
[28:27] sitting there huddled in a hole you've
[28:29] got nowhere to go
[28:31] and you realize it's just you and God
[28:34] he said that was my most terrifying
[28:37] moment
[28:38] and that was the point that when he came
[28:40] home
[28:41] he referred back to
[28:43] people say you got saved during the war
[28:46] yes just me and God
[28:48] in a little hole in the ground in the
[28:51] middle of the desert
[28:53] you know
[28:54] our brothers going through a struggle
[28:57] right now
[28:58] maybe others are too
[29:01] might be a terrifying time for them
[29:04] let's lift them up in prayer let's not
[29:07] forget them
[29:08] you know sometimes in those times you
[29:10] feel like it's just you alone and
[29:13] sometimes we need that amen let's stand
[29:15] I want to speak to you tonight
[29:18] and um
[29:20] you know I just uh
[29:22] will be my last opportunity and I don't
[29:25] know if we'll pick this up again I I
[29:27] hope tonight you can
[29:29] make continuity of my thoughts because
[29:31] I've had to set so many of them aside
[29:34] we're going to be gone for such a
[29:37] lengthy amount of time I don't know if I
[29:39] will be able
[29:40] to pick this back up again because
[29:44] um
[29:44] where those slots are other thoughts
[29:47] will take their place
[29:49] and so I hope tonight that that the
[29:52] things that I've cut out don't leave too
[29:55] big of a gap second Corinthians I want
[29:58] to speak to you tonight the war within
[29:59] and the war without
[30:01] and defeating the strongholds
[30:04] we have been given a promise my brother
[30:07] and sister and in that promise
[30:10] it's not for us to make the promise come
[30:13] to pass it's for us to rise in faith
[30:17] believing as we'll hopefully Lord
[30:19] willing be able to touch but believing
[30:21] as we walk forward
[30:23] you see
[30:27] how do I say this
[30:32] it's one thing to know you have a
[30:34] promise
[30:35] it's another that Satan would plant a
[30:38] thought
[30:39] that the promise is either going to fail
[30:41] you or you have failed the promise
[30:45] and so in that realm we will find
[30:47] ourselves constantly looking back to see
[30:51] is this taking place is this present and
[30:54] I hope tonight that we can just
[30:56] elaborate on that
[30:58] amen defeating the strongholds and uh my
[31:02] brother and sister I'll say tonight I
[31:04] believe each and every one of us maybe
[31:07] even still have some strongholds we need
[31:10] to defeat and anything that is a
[31:12] stronghold is a place where Satan has
[31:15] power and authority
[31:17] so it doesn't even have to be a
[31:19] besetting sin
[31:20] as it were it could be something very
[31:23] small
[31:24] you know Sister Jerry and I just to
[31:26] drive a point home
[31:27] sister Jerry and I are suffering from
[31:29] the consequence of our own lack of
[31:33] Prudence to deal with puncture Vine
[31:37] she's got one in her foot that she's
[31:39] been trying to soak and get it out and
[31:41] I've got one in the side of my foot that
[31:43] hurts the you know it's not even there
[31:45] still it's whatever residue
[31:51] and you see sometimes that's how Satan
[31:53] is he just comes and he goes
[31:55] leaves his poison
[31:58] that we have to deal with after the fact
[32:02] so it's not even necessarily you might
[32:04] say a besetting sin
[32:06] a moment that Satan uses to remind you
[32:09] of the failure in the past or a lack
[32:14] for the sake of time let's go to the
[32:15] word second Corinthians the 10th chapter
[32:17] verses one through seven very very uh uh
[32:22] common scripture to us and uh we just
[32:26] draw a little thought out of it tonight
[32:28] the Lord willing
[32:30] now I Paul myself
[32:32] beseech you by the meekness and
[32:34] gentleness of Christ
[32:36] who in present embase among you but
[32:40] being absent and bold toward you but I
[32:43] beseech you that I may not be bold when
[32:46] I am present with that confidence
[32:49] wherewith I think to be bold against
[32:51] some
[32:53] which think of us as if we walked
[32:55] according to the flesh
[32:59] you know that's interesting because that
[33:01] Spirit has not left
[33:05] sometimes
[33:07] as ministers we preach in such a fashion
[33:11] and people feel like
[33:13] they've got a just a carnal Earthly
[33:16] motive for preaching that
[33:19] what most people don't realize is when
[33:21] you stand right here and you preach
[33:23] along those lines
[33:24] the very first heart that is Smitten by
[33:28] the word
[33:29] is the our own The Man Behind the
[33:33] platform
[33:36] I tell you there's been more than one
[33:37] time I've had to stop and say Lord Lord
[33:40] forgive me
[33:42] Lord forgive me and it seems like you're
[33:44] cutting at someone and the truth of it
[33:46] is is God's cutting at the preacher
[33:51] that's not the way I meant to say that
[33:53] but
[34:00] for though we walk in the flesh
[34:03] we do not war after the flesh
[34:07] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[34:09] carnal I want to say that again I say it
[34:12] with emphasis for the weapons of our
[34:14] Warfare are not carnal But Mighty yes
[34:19] through God Amen that's what we've got
[34:22] to remember it's mighty through God to
[34:25] the pulling down of strongholds casting
[34:28] down imaginations and every High thing
[34:31] that exalt us itself against the
[34:33] knowledge of God and bringing into
[34:35] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[34:39] of Christ now I want to elaborate
[34:42] because we're not going to come back to
[34:43] that my brother and sister captivity is
[34:46] not where something has a choice
[34:49] captivity is bound
[34:52] so God says I'm going to bind these
[34:56] things that's going to uh uh the
[34:59] imaginations and high things that exalt
[35:02] themselves and bringing into captivity
[35:04] every thought to The Obedience of Christ
[35:08] and having in a Readiness to Revenge all
[35:11] Disobedience when our obedience is
[35:14] fulfilled do ye look on things after the
[35:17] outward appearance
[35:19] If any man trusts to himself that he is
[35:21] Christ let him of himself think this
[35:24] again that as he is Christ even so are
[35:29] we Christ amen so this is not for some
[35:32] preacher to say look I know I'm saved
[35:34] and I question you my brother and sister
[35:36] every one of us has a right to stand on
[35:38] the word and declare that we are saved
[35:41] that we are Sons and Daughters of God it
[35:44] is not to a single man it is not to an
[35:47] organization it is not to whatever but
[35:50] it is between you and I and when you
[35:52] have that experience and people say well
[35:55] I don't know about you can stand there
[35:57] and say look I've had my own backside of
[35:59] the desert
[36:00] amen
[36:02] let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord we
[36:04] thank you for your grace your mercy
[36:06] tonight and Lord so many thoughts
[36:08] swirling in my mind I pray father you
[36:10] just help me to remain focused Lord just
[36:13] be with the Saints Lord our brother
[36:15] Sergey somewhere in the country our
[36:17] brother vasili Lord no doubt the same
[36:19] out on the road somewhere with the
[36:21] family's father the Saints in the
[36:23] Ukraine and Russia Lord South America
[36:26] Africa wherever the bride of Christ is
[36:29] Father we just ask for your Holy Spirit
[36:31] to move and Lord lead us and guide us
[36:34] you've given us a promise father but
[36:36] somewhere along the line Lord we know we
[36:38] have to stand on that promise and not be
[36:41] moved from the promise and so I ask you
[36:43] father give us strength give us courage
[36:46] Lord give us understanding and
[36:48] revelation of of where we stand and the
[36:50] word is it's being opened in our day
[36:52] father Lord that we can stand here Lord
[36:55] and fulfill what you've called us to
[36:57] fulfill we ask these things in the name
[37:00] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen
[37:03] you may be seated
[37:08] as we would look
[37:09] through my brother and sister I'm I want
[37:11] to just take for a moment and touch back
[37:14] on some of these verses here for the
[37:16] weapons of our Warfare are no carnal but
[37:19] we my brother and sister in a body of
[37:22] Flesh have come and have to be under the
[37:25] anointing of the holy spirit because
[37:27] without that we turn everything into an
[37:30] issue of the flesh
[37:32] whether someone slighted us or offended
[37:35] us or ignored us but look at verse 5 it
[37:39] says casting down imaginations in every
[37:42] High thing that exalteth itself against
[37:44] the knowledge of God and bringing into
[37:46] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[37:50] of Christ and you know just going
[37:52] through this I hope you don't mind if I
[37:54] speak a little direct tonight but my
[37:56] brother and sister were living in a
[37:58] generation that a lot of things are
[38:00] dealing as a prophet of God taught us
[38:02] the greatest battle ever fought and one
[38:04] of the Realms that Satan is doing so
[38:07] well in is in the realm of thought or
[38:10] imagination and so it's there that Satan
[38:13] starts to work upon them we won't go
[38:16] into all of the eagle evil uh things
[38:19] that Satan would use concerning the
[38:21] imaginations but my brother and sister
[38:23] let us just bring it to the place that
[38:25] we would look into our own life and you
[38:28] can judge for yourself your circumstance
[38:30] you see when Satan starts to anoint an
[38:33] imagination it is there that things
[38:35] happen and people create their own realm
[38:39] they create their own thought they
[38:40] create their own atmosphere and it is in
[38:44] that realm that Satan comes in and
[38:46] starts to anoint the people and it's
[38:48] there that many times people would would
[38:51] uh do I I just listen to a little
[38:53] something that was brought to my
[38:54] attention the other day of a man he's
[38:58] he's on the internet out there and uh
[39:00] says he's and now the prophet in the
[39:03] message he's now the prophet for the age
[39:05] to carry the bride to a Rapture and he's
[39:08] been sending letters and different
[39:10] things to people to correct them to to
[39:13] get their churches in order and now if
[39:16] something goes wrong if he sent a letter
[39:18] and something goes wrong he's declaring
[39:21] that's the Judgment that came for people
[39:24] not following his teaching and I look at
[39:27] that and I think you know isn't that an
[39:29] interesting thing because my brother and
[39:31] sister we can all take some Avenue like
[39:34] that and Satan will come and actually
[39:37] bring that crazy kind of an idea and we
[39:40] will be here maybe a little internal
[39:42] struggle right the battle within and
[39:44] without but we can be in a little
[39:46] struggle and maybe we have issues that
[39:49] happen in our life you know the car
[39:51] won't start
[39:53] God's punishing me
[39:57] this comes over here
[39:59] oh it's God showing his disfavor
[40:02] what is that my brother and sister
[40:04] that's imaginations and it's coming to
[40:07] Captivate you to come now we're not
[40:10] doing you know me I don't preach this
[40:12] just love love love but we are living in
[40:14] the age of Grace my brother and sister
[40:16] and God does not come he is avengeful
[40:20] God but he's not a pentagon and he will
[40:23] never never never judge us until he's
[40:26] giving warning and if we our sons and
[40:29] daughters of God that's who I'm talking
[40:30] to tonight so God's giving warning to us
[40:33] but he doesn't do that by killing your
[40:36] car unless that's for your benefit
[40:39] not judgment
[40:41] benefit
[40:45] but you see Satan anoints us and people
[40:47] start getting ideas that these things
[40:49] happening in their life is because God
[40:51] is angry with them my brother and sister
[40:53] you know I shared that with you and I
[40:55] keep going to go look at them it was
[40:57] either Tozer Spurgeon you know says when
[40:59] we fall away there's not exact words
[41:01] when we fall away God Woos us back
[41:07] now sometimes wooing probably can be
[41:10] pretty Direct
[41:12] Amen in our human thinking we would
[41:15] think man that's not really wooing
[41:19] well my brother and sister I'll tell you
[41:21] God knows what he's doing we need to
[41:23] trust him and we need to come and follow
[41:26] the word and cast down the imaginations
[41:28] that pull us away from the word of God
[41:31] and cast down anything that wants to
[41:33] exalt itself over the word of God and we
[41:36] need to bring in captivity our thoughts
[41:39] amen it's there that Satan Works in that
[41:42] realm and people then start to do that
[41:45] oh I I think this and they start to
[41:48] entertain that and there's a lot of
[41:50] avenues that we could go into that
[41:52] tonight but I won't but look at this my
[41:54] brother and sister some of it can be
[41:56] very personal
[41:57] in life and satanic exalts that
[42:01] imagination anoints that imagination and
[42:04] you know I will bring this one thought
[42:06] up this happened a few years ago there
[42:08] was a man and a woman and it was there
[42:11] that they come they're married and they
[42:14] were fellowshipped around as families
[42:17] and whatever at the church and and it
[42:19] was there that they did that and he got
[42:21] an imagination that uh you know I'm not
[42:24] I didn't marry the right wife and she
[42:27] got an imagination now I wonder where
[42:28] that imagination come from
[42:31] then I didn't marry the right husband so
[42:33] they divorced their spouses and
[42:35] believing that this is the perfect one
[42:37] for them they divorce their spouses tear
[42:40] up their families and 13 months later
[42:42] realized they weren't the perfect couple
[42:46] now what have they done
[42:49] what was that
[42:51] and Imagination
[42:52] an anointing from Satan
[42:55] to look over as it were to lust after
[42:58] another man's wife to lust after another
[43:00] woman's husband but yet in their mind
[43:02] they were sure it was God that told them
[43:05] see how slippery the devil is
[43:08] that's a pretty strong imagination my
[43:10] brother and sister I hope that's not too
[43:11] strong for Wednesday night amen so look
[43:15] at this that we're doing here it's there
[43:17] that we need to come to a place that we
[43:20] bring captivity to our thoughts
[43:23] amen that will that will do a lot and
[43:25] I'll just put it this way you feel like
[43:27] you're not good enough to be a Son of
[43:29] God or a daughter of God cast down that
[43:32] imagination cast down that spirit that
[43:35] would try to convince you to convince
[43:38] yourself that you are not a part of the
[43:40] body of Christ cast that down
[43:43] amen because you see we're supposed to
[43:46] follow the word
[43:50] that's a whole other chapter
[43:52] I'd like to give you a little side note
[43:54] tonight if you don't mind
[43:56] just a lot of things have come across my
[43:58] plate in the last little bit here
[44:01] you know this to me is an interesting
[44:04] side note and
[44:05] one of the reasons that people around
[44:08] the message are increasingly rejecting
[44:11] it
[44:15] is that the message is not catering
[44:18] to the flesh
[44:24] the word of God said the things done in
[44:27] secret
[44:28] would be made known
[44:31] so when they come face to face with the
[44:33] product of their imagination
[44:36] they don't like it
[44:38] now my brother and sister I'm not
[44:39] talking about a preacher beating people
[44:41] up but when the word is preached and it
[44:43] comes back and Deals and comes before
[44:46] them again and again and again they have
[44:49] two options they can repent and come
[44:52] back to the Lord or they can exit with
[44:54] an excuse
[44:56] and let us all be honest tonight
[45:00] it's very face saving to exit with a
[45:04] good excuse
[45:07] not a feeble one
[45:09] but a good one
[45:12] and so when the word of God does not
[45:14] cater to the Flesh and look at the age
[45:17] look at the spirit in the land that
[45:18] we're living right now my brother and
[45:20] sister it's there you know just the
[45:22] craziness I won't even go into the
[45:24] details of it but just the craziness of
[45:27] what is taking a place across our nation
[45:29] right now and now we'd say there's got
[45:32] to be a safe place Idaho would be safe
[45:34] no it's not
[45:36] no the devil is everywhere
[45:38] and the spirit is there is everywhere
[45:41] and so more and more as the flesh rules
[45:45] the semi catch this the semi-spiritual
[45:49] man
[45:51] this is a man that will tell you I went
[45:53] to church with my grandma
[45:56] we go at Christmas and Easter and maybe
[45:59] a couple other holidays
[46:01] the semi-spiritual man probably in
[46:04] remembrance knows more scripture
[46:06] than you do
[46:12] anointed
[46:14] with an imagination that that made him
[46:17] spiritual
[46:20] now I am bringing you this a slightly
[46:21] different Avenue and you you can
[46:23] recognize that but you see look at the
[46:26] realm when a man comes and he believes
[46:28] that he is right and you are wrong this
[46:31] is why partly I chose the scripture
[46:33] there the Apostle Paul said hey if you
[46:35] think you're saved you have to include
[46:37] me because I am Christ also
[46:42] but look at how these Spirits are these
[46:44] spirits of imagination they always draw
[46:46] it you need to worship my way if you are
[46:49] going to make a rapture
[46:51] and what they're trying to do is cast
[46:52] upon the people a spirit that would
[46:55] cause them to look at their own life and
[46:56] say I'm not doing what he's doing and
[46:59] maybe that's the reason that I don't
[47:02] feel like an overcomer is because I need
[47:04] to go do this but my brother and sister
[47:06] that's not the answer the answer is a
[47:09] deeper consecration to the Lord It's a
[47:11] deeper sincerity it's a acting upon the
[47:14] word it's not just shifting directions
[47:16] and following someone else's teaching
[47:18] and so it's there as we see more and
[47:22] more the flesh is ruling the
[47:24] semi-spiritual man and so more and more
[47:27] to be seen uh versus the Unseen and we
[47:30] can turn these around because these do
[47:32] apply in opposites each one of these but
[47:35] it's more and more that people you know
[47:37] they say well if I can see it I'll
[47:39] believe it but my brother and sister
[47:41] that's not what the word says amen the
[47:43] word doesn't say you know I'm going to
[47:45] do that but then the word says I've
[47:47] given many infallible proofs
[47:50] so the evidence is to be seen but
[47:53] they're looking for something that was
[47:55] unseen are you with me
[47:57] and so it's there more and more the
[47:59] scene versus the Unseen you know must
[48:02] see to believe the unproven
[48:05] versus The Proven
[48:09] now my brother and sister you'd say what
[48:10] what do you want to bring there well I'm
[48:12] going to just keep this simple tonight
[48:14] my brother and sister people believe
[48:16] God's got given them favor another vain
[48:19] imagination that if they get rich that's
[48:22] God's favor
[48:24] and it's really strange because there's
[48:26] just
[48:27] Beyond accountability of people who have
[48:30] taken that position and become wealthy
[48:33] and they're convinced that was God
[48:44] and yet to flip that over
[48:48] when the proven
[48:50] is before them
[48:52] because it will not cater to the flesh
[48:55] they'll reject it
[48:59] what is this
[49:01] dying to oneself
[49:07] there comes your time my brother and
[49:08] sister and if you haven't already come
[49:10] there you will come there and that is
[49:12] that you will come and the difference of
[49:14] moving forward with God and stalling
[49:17] where you're at will come down what you
[49:19] will choose to do with your own flesh
[49:22] your own imagination your own knowledge
[49:25] what you decide to do with that will
[49:28] determine whether you move on or not
[49:33] you guys sure are quiet
[49:40] but you see Satan would twist it to his
[49:43] advantage
[49:45] you see he always knows which way to
[49:47] turn it
[49:48] he knows which way to present it
[49:52] now
[49:54] there was a man of war one time said
[49:56] something to this order these won't be
[49:58] the exact words
[50:00] this man of Wars said attack the enemy
[50:03] not only at their weakest point but also
[50:06] at their weakest time
[50:10] recognize what happens to you
[50:14] certain things in our life
[50:16] and because I've been dwelling on
[50:18] imagination a little something you know
[50:19] in our mind that we trouble or just keep
[50:22] fighting over and Satan can just sit and
[50:25] let you go for days weeks months maybe
[50:27] even years and then when the time is
[50:30] right he pounces and it's in that moment
[50:33] that many a man and many a woman has
[50:36] found themselves with the question mark
[50:38] even to the degree is their a god
[50:42] that's how effective Satan can bring
[50:44] bring them to a place is there a God
[50:51] see my brother and sister
[50:55] Satan's whole job
[50:59] I'm glad
[51:00] that God gave us the ability to
[51:04] recognize Satan's tactic in the Book of
[51:06] Job
[51:12] not in real deep tonight Saints just
[51:14] trying to stir us and remind us
[51:16] I'm glad I thank the Lord that God
[51:20] allowed us to see Revelation in the Book
[51:23] of Job and to see that what applied to
[51:26] job my brother's sister applies to us
[51:28] and God said go ahead I'm not worried
[51:31] about him I'm not worried he'll fail I'm
[51:34] not worried he'll give up so go ahead do
[51:37] everything but take his life and when
[51:40] God said that my brother and sister do
[51:42] you realize because
[51:44] eternal life resided in job it was
[51:46] almost as God was saying you can't take
[51:49] his life
[51:50] because that is eternal life that's an
[51:53] eternal seed in job and so you're going
[51:56] to fight against him you're going to war
[51:57] against his flesh you're going to give
[51:59] him friends that help his imagination of
[52:03] what he did wrong and what he has done
[52:05] right and friends that are going to give
[52:07] advice and wife that will be this and
[52:10] that and whatever but yet in the end God
[52:13] said I'm not concerned because I know
[52:16] who job is and job is mine
[52:21] and so that life that was there and I'm
[52:23] so thankful today my brother and sister
[52:25] that God gave us the understanding of
[52:28] that scripture and of that time and
[52:30] place that when things come what we
[52:32] think is a dead end it's pretty bleak
[52:35] stop my brother and sister and realize
[52:37] God would not let you through into this
[52:40] test if God had not provided the way out
[52:43] of this zest
[52:45] that he has already declared go ahead
[52:47] this is my faithful servant attack him
[52:54] I'll tell you otherwise we would
[52:55] sometimes and circumstances be just like
[52:58] why is God what's happening here it
[53:00] seems like the devil's beating me up but
[53:02] when we have that revelation we can
[53:05] stand and say yes sir you know I got
[53:08] purified ones amen they poured the gold
[53:11] off but there must still be some dross
[53:13] in me and God's turning the fire back up
[53:16] again amen anybody recognize the fire
[53:19] amen The Melting Pot the trial the
[53:22] Temptation the struggle and the flame
[53:24] gets what is it purifying a bride that
[53:28] she will be spotless on that day
[53:31] not some bride that's got that you know
[53:33] I don't know if any of you ever done
[53:34] that I used to do a lot of reloading we
[53:36] used to go collect the Lino type from
[53:39] the old style printing presses and and
[53:41] different things wheel weights and just
[53:43] anything that was led and and we would
[53:45] melt it down and then we would have to
[53:48] add I forget now even what it was but we
[53:51] added uh some stuff to it and all of
[53:54] that contamination in that lead would
[53:56] coagulate on the top and we would scrape
[53:58] it off
[53:59] and then you think oh it's ready to make
[54:01] bullets out of no it isn't you got to do
[54:04] it again three or four times
[54:06] Hallelujah
[54:08] three or four times well I've already
[54:11] been three or four times maybe not at
[54:12] that refiner fire maybe not at that
[54:15] level maybe God was just getting all the
[54:17] sticks and stones out first
[54:19] so you see how this comes about so as
[54:23] Satan tries to use this attacking us at
[54:26] our weakest point at the weakest time
[54:28] amen we would come and Satan uses it
[54:31] against us but my brother and sister God
[54:35] has given us a weapon and some of this
[54:37] I'm just paraphrasing not going through
[54:39] all the quotes because of time but you
[54:42] know just to look at what the prophet of
[54:44] God shows us here and Satan's got his
[54:47] weapon that he uses against us but God
[54:50] has given the bride of Christ her own
[54:52] weapon amen we're not sitting here uh
[54:56] powerless uh indefensible we're not
[54:59] setting here as weaklings my brother and
[55:01] sister he has made us Warriors
[55:04] amen he has taught us of the Warfare
[55:07] that matters not of Flesh and Blood not
[55:10] of carnal things but in the spiritual
[55:12] realm is where this Warfare matters and
[55:15] God has given us weapons that we can
[55:17] take and as Satan would come down and he
[55:20] bombards us with thoughts and I'm
[55:22] telling you it's a comfort to me when
[55:24] the prophet of God said that thought
[55:26] might enter your mind but your job is to
[55:29] make sure that it doesn't stop and make
[55:31] a nest
[55:32] and you'd say oh I can't be a very good
[55:34] Christian for a thought like that to
[55:36] pass through my mind
[55:37] my brother and sister all it is is for
[55:40] you is not to dwell on that
[55:48] but to cast it out
[55:51] and say that's not who I am
[55:53] nice try Satan nice try
[56:00] you know sometimes
[56:03] sometimes the enemy
[56:08] has such a incredible way
[56:14] that they work
[56:21] Once Upon a Time in World War II
[56:25] in Italy there was such a strong
[56:27] contingent
[56:29] of Italian and German soldiers
[56:32] that it seemed as though the Allied Army
[56:34] could not
[56:36] move forward
[56:39] it was a pretty Rapid River that they
[56:41] had in fact the rip River however you
[56:44] would say it in Italian was basically
[56:46] rapido
[56:48] very fast river flowing and almost like
[56:51] a channel across the country there
[56:54] they can't penetrate it they can't even
[56:55] get across the river
[56:58] somebody says
[56:59] why don't we make them come to us
[57:03] and they started shooting Cannon shells
[57:05] with pamphlets in them so when they hit
[57:07] the ground they just basically burst
[57:09] open and all these pamphlets they flew
[57:12] over Enemy Lines even had some planes
[57:14] shot down dropping canisters that broke
[57:17] open with pamphlets and the pamphlets
[57:19] were saying they're lying to you
[57:21] they're lying to you they're going to
[57:24] sacrifice you on the table and it's
[57:27] there they're doing this and and you
[57:29] think oh well they're soldiers they're
[57:31] trained soldiers they've been fighting
[57:33] they've been holding their own
[57:36] but then they're holding a pamphlet
[57:39] and they look around and realize those
[57:41] people that are leading them and telling
[57:43] them to go and die
[57:45] are living in Comfort
[57:47] actually eating with China and Crystal
[57:49] and whatever at night and
[57:51] it started to weigh upon the minds
[57:56] of the soldiers
[58:00] and they literally when the rainy season
[58:02] come we're living in foxholes or half
[58:04] full of water
[58:06] their feet were rotting off of their
[58:08] bodies
[58:11] but yet maybe inside a coat pocket they
[58:14] still had a pamphlet
[58:18] see the two-edged sword here
[58:20] go to use a cast off Bible in a trash
[58:24] can
[58:25] to catch a man's mind
[58:29] but Satan will also use a pamphlet
[58:32] of 101 reasons what you believe is wrong
[58:37] Warfare
[58:39] of the Mind
[58:41] it becomes so strong
[58:44] that entire uh uh platoons of Italian
[58:48] soldiers would March up with the rifles
[58:51] turned around and the breach open and
[58:54] hand them to him and say we want to
[58:56] surrender
[59:00] and then they told the German soldiers
[59:02] if they go to to surrender kill them
[59:06] instead the German soldiers walked with
[59:08] them and surrendered
[59:10] how effective this battle of the mind is
[59:16] but the word of God says that we
[59:19] would could should
[59:22] let me rephrase that
[59:24] could should
[59:28] have the mind of Christ
[59:30] how much more my brother and sister if
[59:33] we purge our mind of all of the negative
[59:36] that this world has right here and we
[59:39] get the mind of Christ and the Devil
[59:42] comes to assault us and we are there I
[59:44] hope you can follow this figuratively as
[59:46] we are there and the devil is assaulting
[59:48] us we're just taking those thoughts and
[59:50] brushing them away brushing them away
[59:52] you're not going to build the nest of
[59:55] those thoughts that are anti-word
[59:57] Antichrist in my mind
[1:00:00] but it doesn't stop Satan you can knock
[1:00:02] a thousand off and he'll come with a
[1:00:04] thousand and one
[1:00:09] Satan uses us against us
[1:00:13] but you know the true word of God and
[1:00:15] this is nothing new but the true word of
[1:00:17] God
[1:00:18] is our greatest weapon
[1:00:22] you see my brother and sister the reason
[1:00:24] I put the word through in there is many
[1:00:26] people take up a Bible
[1:00:28] and start to present ideas and try and
[1:00:30] make that this is what God's saying to
[1:00:32] you
[1:00:33] the true word of God will be the word
[1:00:36] that has come as it were through the
[1:00:39] fire and is unquenchable amen it is a
[1:00:43] fire in of itself and it has been tested
[1:00:46] it has been proven it has been
[1:00:48] Vindicated and you know what I hope you
[1:00:50] don't take this wrong I'm not even
[1:00:51] talking about brother branham's Ministry
[1:00:53] I'm talking about the experience that
[1:00:56] you have with Christ
[1:00:58] there's the thing people say well I knew
[1:01:01] it was wrong all along you know Saving
[1:01:03] Face a good excuse a good way out but my
[1:01:05] brother and sister I'll tell you what I
[1:01:07] know I know personally it's the truth I
[1:01:11] know personally that time after time God
[1:01:13] has dealt with me in things that my wife
[1:01:16] didn't even know about and so perfect to
[1:01:19] come down and touch upon those and
[1:01:21] change directions and change hearts
[1:01:25] and somebody's going to drop a pamphlet
[1:01:28] and expect you to digest it
[1:01:34] brother Sergey and I was having a
[1:01:36] conversation here recently
[1:01:40] and sometimes you just got to love just
[1:01:42] a fresh perspective
[1:01:45] almost like what do you do with this
[1:01:47] stuff
[1:01:48] throw in the trash
[1:01:50] don't even read it
[1:01:54] yeah
[1:01:57] cool
[1:01:59] just throw it in the trash
[1:02:01] in electronic age that means when that
[1:02:04] comes your curiosity is not even allowed
[1:02:09] to open
[1:02:11] and scan so that you can criticize their
[1:02:14] nonsense
[1:02:18] what is this you say well brother Paul
[1:02:20] you were talking about breaking down
[1:02:21] strongholds tonight we are
[1:02:24] we are you see this is Satan's form of
[1:02:27] creating a stronghold for him is to
[1:02:30] plant a seed of Doubt a seed of fear I'm
[1:02:33] going to be deceived but my brother and
[1:02:34] sister I preach this a lot and it is a
[1:02:36] very pet subject to me I will admit that
[1:02:39] but the word of God says we can't be
[1:02:42] deceived because what we are the word
[1:02:48] amen you won't be deceived so what does
[1:02:51] this mean if you are the word you must
[1:02:54] be eating the word because pardon me for
[1:02:56] this normal phrase you are what you eat
[1:02:59] and if we're eating the word then
[1:03:02] there's no way Satan can come and
[1:03:05] deceive you
[1:03:06] unless he plants
[1:03:08] something
[1:03:10] in the womb of your mind
[1:03:13] and causes you to start dwelling on that
[1:03:17] well
[1:03:21] scripture said that signs and wonders
[1:03:24] would follow
[1:03:26] them that believe
[1:03:29] Do You Realize by entertaining that
[1:03:31] Spirit you've just set yourself out
[1:03:35] from that position of that promise
[1:03:39] because you now have a spirit of doubt
[1:03:43] so you're now stepping back the promise
[1:03:45] is right here you're stepping back
[1:03:49] because now you've got to look around
[1:03:50] and see is it happening anywhere
[1:03:53] well Saints I don't know about you but
[1:03:56] we'll go into it tonight some of it's
[1:03:58] very personal
[1:04:01] my God
[1:04:03] has come down in a very personal way in
[1:04:07] my life
[1:04:09] it's undeniable
[1:04:12] do I have to go out amongst the
[1:04:14] Sadducees and the Pharisees and the
[1:04:16] herodians and lay my life on a table
[1:04:20] so they can examine the details to see
[1:04:22] if they're valid
[1:04:25] you see how slippery Satan is
[1:04:28] coming with his pamphlets spreading them
[1:04:32] oh you need to watch this you need to
[1:04:34] hear this you need to read this
[1:04:38] I wouldn't even use it for Firestarter
[1:04:40] lest the smoke of that Spirit would
[1:04:42] float through my house
[1:04:50] so the true word of God is our greatest
[1:04:53] weapon
[1:04:55] can someone tell me what Satan's weakest
[1:04:58] link is
[1:05:01] foreign
[1:05:05] the word
[1:05:08] the word is Satan's
[1:05:10] weakest link
[1:05:13] you see the word shows us
[1:05:15] how Lucifer
[1:05:18] the prince of the heavens
[1:05:21] was cast out
[1:05:25] by the word
[1:05:28] and he can't get back
[1:05:30] so if he had any Authority he would go
[1:05:33] and place himself back
[1:05:35] but he's had to make
[1:05:37] Earth
[1:05:38] his kingdom
[1:05:47] you know if you're wanting to be a
[1:05:49] fighter
[1:05:51] you don't want to go to the man who
[1:05:53] talks about fighting
[1:05:55] you want to go to the man who goes in
[1:05:57] the alley and he's the one that walks
[1:05:58] out
[1:06:01] that's what you want to do
[1:06:04] and Satan brings a fight and he talks a
[1:06:07] good fight doesn't he Saints
[1:06:09] but my brother and sister he's already
[1:06:11] been cast out
[1:06:12] when he came out of the alley it was by
[1:06:15] force of the word
[1:06:17] not of his own
[1:06:20] and so we see that Satan's weakest point
[1:06:23] is the word of God and my brother and
[1:06:25] sister we see in our scriptures our lord
[1:06:27] Jesus and and Satan comes down and takes
[1:06:31] him to the Pinnacle takes him all these
[1:06:33] places and you know it's there what did
[1:06:35] Jesus do he didn't go and say now this
[1:06:38] and now that his response was there was
[1:06:42] only one reference isn't that wonderful
[1:06:44] when we're all on the same page and
[1:06:46] nobody has to say what are they
[1:06:47] referring to but when he spoke to the
[1:06:50] devil that day it is written Satan knew
[1:06:55] what he was talking about it wasn't like
[1:06:58] oh let me explain to you what I'm
[1:07:00] talking about over here he said it is
[1:07:02] written he didn't have to go quote
[1:07:04] chapter verse lines he didn't have to
[1:07:07] bring up keywords for his search all he
[1:07:09] had to do is say it is written and right
[1:07:12] there at that moment Satan he didn't
[1:07:14] even give up get this Saints this is
[1:07:16] where many people Miss up here mess up
[1:07:18] here is because they think when you say
[1:07:21] to the devil it is written that he's
[1:07:23] going to just run off but my brother and
[1:07:25] sister he runs off all right but he
[1:07:27] leaves a lot of little pamphlets behind
[1:07:29] him a lot of little ideas a lot of
[1:07:31] little arrows into the mind and into the
[1:07:34] spirit because he knows he's defeated
[1:07:36] but he'll be right back
[1:07:39] now the scripture says that
[1:07:41] if we approach the word of God correctly
[1:07:44] that Satan will flee from us
[1:07:48] what is the key ingredient
[1:07:51] the word
[1:07:54] I always like that story you know when I
[1:07:56] was younger I used to read that over and
[1:07:57] over again used to
[1:07:59] get this have an imagination
[1:08:03] of the seven sons of Siva
[1:08:06] I can see them all
[1:08:07] stop right there the mirror
[1:08:10] just the tie
[1:08:12] walk through that doorway
[1:08:15] we're here to cast you out
[1:08:18] a few minutes later hope this isn't too
[1:08:21] visual for you they come running out
[1:08:23] almost stripped naked beat and scratched
[1:08:26] bit
[1:08:29] why
[1:08:31] they went with knowledge
[1:08:33] they went with the education they had
[1:08:35] studied they had observed
[1:08:38] and had a little dose of imagination in
[1:08:41] there of how it must have been
[1:08:44] when they cast Satan out
[1:08:47] well
[1:08:49] sorry
[1:08:51] sweet and he was like well
[1:08:55] and they're like that doesn't work
[1:08:58] but you see the devil when he gets you
[1:09:00] to running doesn't stop
[1:09:03] he'll chase you as far as you'll run
[1:09:06] he'll Trace chase a rich man
[1:09:09] from Wall Street
[1:09:12] to living in a cardboard box under the
[1:09:15] Brooklyn Bridge
[1:09:18] that's how far
[1:09:19] he would Chase
[1:09:21] let me hurry here
[1:09:25] so Satan's weakest point is the word of
[1:09:27] God it is written not his powerful
[1:09:29] Saints
[1:09:30] I don't know how many of us and you
[1:09:33] don't know I don't I don't really want
[1:09:34] to know I don't know how many of us
[1:09:35] actually practice that actually come
[1:09:38] down to the point Lord the word it's
[1:09:40] written this spirit is bothering me this
[1:09:43] thought is bothering me this
[1:09:44] circumstance is bothering me but it's
[1:09:46] written Lord that you would deliver me
[1:09:48] from every affliction
[1:09:52] I stand on that Lord I believe that Lord
[1:09:56] and then to watch those things evaporate
[1:09:58] from in front of you and go away
[1:10:02] amen the prophet of God said the word
[1:10:05] will defeat Satan any time in any place
[1:10:08] do we believe that
[1:10:13] not the debate of the word
[1:10:17] don't you just love that when you
[1:10:18] receive a little email
[1:10:20] and somebody wants you to
[1:10:22] engage into a Blog thing
[1:10:26] just debate the message with us as
[1:10:29] friends
[1:10:32] I ain't got no friends that got a
[1:10:34] pitchfork and horns
[1:10:39] not one single friend
[1:10:41] that wants to take the word of God
[1:10:44] and make it none effect
[1:10:47] friendship does not connect to that
[1:10:50] you want to be Paul's friends and
[1:10:52] surprisingly there's very few that want
[1:10:54] to so I don't have to worry about saying
[1:10:56] this you want to be Paul's friend you
[1:10:58] come with the word that lifts me up and
[1:11:00] strengthens me the word that encourages
[1:11:02] me to press forward the word that
[1:11:04] reminds me of who I am and then I know
[1:11:07] they're my friend because they care
[1:11:08] about my soul
[1:11:10] which is who I really am
[1:11:13] yeah
[1:11:15] not the knowledge of the word look
[1:11:17] dealing with Satan my brother and sister
[1:11:18] it's not to debate the word and defeat
[1:11:21] someone on a debate it is not to prove
[1:11:24] how much knowledge we have but the real
[1:11:26] proof lies in the word applied
[1:11:31] if I really believe this
[1:11:40] little story about a grandmother
[1:11:43] went to the naturopathic type doctor
[1:11:45] said I have this symptom I have that
[1:11:47] symptom
[1:11:49] the doctor says Well here here's these
[1:11:52] these two you know vitamins or herbs or
[1:11:55] whatever here you take this one twice a
[1:11:58] day you take this one twice a day and
[1:12:00] we'll see in a month so she comes back a
[1:12:02] month later
[1:12:04] and the Seal's not even broken on the
[1:12:06] bottles
[1:12:07] she tells the doctor I feel better
[1:12:11] the doctors but how could you
[1:12:15] it's a silly story
[1:12:18] I read the label and it said it would
[1:12:21] make me feel better
[1:12:23] and I believed
[1:12:27] the doctor's like I don't think that's
[1:12:29] how it works
[1:12:33] but would it work for us
[1:12:37] I believe what's on the label
[1:12:40] and it will change my life
[1:12:46] on caveat
[1:12:49] we're supposed to eat the book
[1:12:54] the doctor sent Grandma home
[1:12:56] after making her swallow some vitamins
[1:13:02] it's an interesting story about this
[1:13:04] lady I think it was West Virginia
[1:13:07] and that brother back there in West
[1:13:08] Virginia will tell you I won't say who
[1:13:10] it is for sure but he'll tell you
[1:13:12] anything that happens in West Virginia
[1:13:13] will be extraordinary
[1:13:17] now let's look at this looking to the
[1:13:19] Unseen I'm getting sidetracked
[1:13:22] someone asked me not long ago said
[1:13:24] brother Branham what do you think about
[1:13:26] the future
[1:13:28] I said I do not know what the future
[1:13:30] holds but I know who holds the future so
[1:13:34] that's the thing if I can keep
[1:13:36] acquainted with him
[1:13:39] then when he found out that this Prophet
[1:13:42] was in Israel now this goes back and
[1:13:44] kind of another thing here and please
[1:13:46] never hesitate to go read the the whole
[1:13:50] before and behind and
[1:13:52] then he found out that this Prophet was
[1:13:54] in Israel he said go fetch him bring him
[1:13:56] to me and they went down and someone
[1:13:58] told him that Elisha was at Dothan and
[1:14:01] when they got down there to Dothan they
[1:14:03] went in by night time and encamped
[1:14:06] around about in darkness you see how the
[1:14:08] enemy always works underhanded in dark
[1:14:12] and encamped around about the city to
[1:14:15] catch Elisha so when the young man his
[1:14:17] servant raised up early in the morning
[1:14:19] and went out in other words he was a
[1:14:21] fellow that had taken him in and out and
[1:14:23] around was his servant life and when he
[1:14:25] went out he came back and he said alas
[1:14:27] my master for the whole city is a
[1:14:32] excuse me
[1:14:34] is uncamped about with horses and
[1:14:36] Chariots of the enemy
[1:14:38] he said
[1:14:39] why there's more with us than there is
[1:14:42] with them
[1:14:44] well he could see no one
[1:14:47] but Elisha
[1:14:49] so only thing I can guess Saints is that
[1:14:52] Elisha must have lifted a curtain in a
[1:14:56] room and looked out
[1:15:00] doesn't sound right does it
[1:15:02] because you still can't see him
[1:15:09] so Elisha
[1:15:12] will hurry on here
[1:15:17] and Elisha prayed
[1:15:19] and said Lord protect us from these
[1:15:22] enemies that are surrounding us
[1:15:24] protect us from the the whole city
[1:15:27] that's encamped about With the Enemy
[1:15:29] Lord you've got to come rescue us
[1:15:32] oh am I on the wrong page
[1:15:36] Elisha prayed and said Lord open the
[1:15:38] young man's eyes that he may see and I'm
[1:15:41] going to add this right in there he may
[1:15:43] see what is already taking place
[1:15:47] this is not we hope to see this is not
[1:15:51] these signs and wonders should good
[1:15:53] might possibly be following this my
[1:15:56] brother and sister is a point I want to
[1:15:57] make to you tonight because you see it
[1:16:00] all depends on what your outlook is of
[1:16:02] the signs and the Wonders it's what you
[1:16:05] look at of seeing and thinking that God
[1:16:07] is going to do in this day the prophet
[1:16:10] of God said this is not going to be a
[1:16:12] show
[1:16:14] this is going to be a secret
[1:16:16] and the world out here says prove it
[1:16:19] show us my brother and sister we can't
[1:16:22] show them because we cannot make God
[1:16:25] make what he said in secret open
[1:16:29] and they wanted to be open they want to
[1:16:31] be able to judge it in their fashion but
[1:16:34] God said these things would be done in
[1:16:36] secret in other words this bride of
[1:16:38] Christ is coming to maturity coming to
[1:16:41] the fullness of who she is and it's not
[1:16:44] a public show
[1:16:49] oh look at that
[1:16:52] and the Lord moved the veil from before
[1:16:54] the young man and he looked in the whole
[1:16:57] hills and mountains were full of
[1:16:58] Chariots of Fire standing around that
[1:17:00] old Prophet well he wasn't afraid then
[1:17:04] oh oh what I would think tonight Lord
[1:17:08] let us look past the curtain of time
[1:17:10] just look over just a peek see what it's
[1:17:13] all about we're fighting here we're
[1:17:15] fighting here tonight a great Warfare
[1:17:21] right against wrong word of God against
[1:17:24] modern theology trying to make the word
[1:17:26] of God bring it to the people while the
[1:17:28] enemy would try to be said it in every
[1:17:31] way but one is the majority in God
[1:17:35] Hallelujah aren't you glad now notice
[1:17:37] the point I want to see is Elijah the
[1:17:40] man who was of God called the man of God
[1:17:42] did not look to the natural thing he
[1:17:46] looked to the supernatural thing he
[1:17:49] didn't look at what he's seen he looked
[1:17:52] at what he did not see
[1:17:54] oh my brother and sister I've got a
[1:17:57] couple notes injected into this my
[1:17:59] brother and sister one as we'll look at
[1:18:01] this this is what happens when you're
[1:18:04] acquainted with the right one
[1:18:07] when you are acquainted with the one
[1:18:09] who's in charge of all things you can
[1:18:12] say Lord you notice he didn't have to go
[1:18:14] have prayer meeting
[1:18:15] he didn't have to go consult anybody
[1:18:17] else he just said Lord open this young
[1:18:20] man's eyes and he was so close to God
[1:18:22] God said I know what he's thinking and I
[1:18:24] know why he wants to think it and I know
[1:18:26] the purpose behind it and it happened
[1:18:31] another thing my brother and sister
[1:18:33] Elisha
[1:18:35] didn't have to run outside as it were
[1:18:38] and Peak
[1:18:40] and see if those chariots were there
[1:18:45] he knew
[1:18:47] who he was
[1:18:49] I will be with you
[1:18:52] even in you
[1:18:55] to the ends the ends the ends of the
[1:19:00] Earth
[1:19:01] oh God help us to not have to stop and
[1:19:04] say Lord are you here
[1:19:06] Lord are you in Grace Tabernacle tonight
[1:19:09] are you in our lives Lord are you in my
[1:19:11] circumstance Lord we should come my
[1:19:14] brother and sister to the place as Sons
[1:19:17] and Daughters of God with a promised
[1:19:18] word for the hour and say my God is on
[1:19:21] the scene whether I see him or not
[1:19:23] whether it's approvable whether it is
[1:19:26] and it doesn't matter he said he would
[1:19:29] be and I believe
[1:19:32] and I believe
[1:19:34] Hallelujah
[1:19:37] now look at this boy this sure seems
[1:19:39] like to be the day we're living in if I
[1:19:40] can just come over here and rub this
[1:19:43] just a little bit we're fighting here
[1:19:45] tonight
[1:19:46] so not 2 000 years ago three thousand
[1:19:50] years ago
[1:19:52] now this might be
[1:19:54] a few years ago
[1:19:56] but it's in our generation
[1:19:58] you realize there's people still living
[1:20:01] that were in these meetings
[1:20:05] they're passing quickly but we are not
[1:20:07] devoid of eyewitnesses
[1:20:11] so what do you do if you have an
[1:20:12] eyewitness in the court of law I
[1:20:14] actually did a little studying on this
[1:20:16] you have an eyewitness in the court of
[1:20:17] law
[1:20:19] and you don't want that eyewitness to
[1:20:21] speak
[1:20:23] so you do everything to convolute the
[1:20:25] story and drag the attention of the
[1:20:27] eyewitness to something else and then
[1:20:30] look back and get them to stumble on
[1:20:32] their words
[1:20:33] and then say see
[1:20:36] they didn't tell that story
[1:20:38] the same as they told it before
[1:20:42] well I'm sorry please all forgive me
[1:20:45] we follow those people around
[1:20:48] we'll get the versions of their story
[1:20:50] also
[1:20:52] because we're human
[1:20:54] but you see they want it to be profit
[1:20:56] when they want it to be profit and they
[1:20:57] want it to be human when they want it to
[1:20:59] be human and they want it to be confused
[1:21:01] when they want it to be confused
[1:21:05] they simply want it their way
[1:21:10] and my Bible says I am God
[1:21:13] and I change
[1:21:17] no matter if my servant stumbles
[1:21:20] I'm God Amen I never stumble
[1:21:24] but you see people get this Warfare
[1:21:28] into the flesh Realm
[1:21:30] I'm going to take this old man here that
[1:21:32] can barely remember who he is now
[1:21:34] but he witnessed the supernatural
[1:21:37] we're going to make him look foolish
[1:21:40] and somehow that proves our point
[1:21:46] you say brother Paul why you're
[1:21:47] preaching on this because you're going
[1:21:48] to face it
[1:21:50] they're going to knock on your door one
[1:21:52] day they're going to somehow find your
[1:21:54] email somewhere
[1:21:56] and bombard you with their pamphlet
[1:21:59] maybe an electronic form
[1:22:02] best thing you can do
[1:22:04] I jokingly look over at the keyboard
[1:22:06] and call it
[1:22:08] the eject button
[1:22:12] you're out of here
[1:22:17] then in my imagination
[1:22:21] I see the devil
[1:22:24] sorry about that I had to just put that
[1:22:25] in there
[1:22:27] see if y'all was paying attention
[1:22:30] but one's a majority
[1:22:34] but look at this prophet of God just
[1:22:36] told it like it is
[1:22:38] trying to make the word of God bring it
[1:22:40] to the people while the enemy would try
[1:22:43] to be said it in every way
[1:22:46] so they were living in Saints it's
[1:22:48] happening amen let me move on
[1:22:51] now
[1:22:52] you know we preached the other day and
[1:22:55] brought Hebrews 11 into this and I want
[1:22:58] to just bring this one scripture real
[1:23:00] quick
[1:23:02] Hebrews 11 33
[1:23:04] speaking all the heroes of faith
[1:23:06] who through faith
[1:23:10] subdued kingdoms
[1:23:21] I should ask the brothers to have put
[1:23:23] Webster Online
[1:23:25] up on the screen
[1:23:30] because Webster ties it right back
[1:23:34] to spiritual
[1:23:35] realms
[1:23:40] who cares if they went out kicked a king
[1:23:42] out of a country
[1:23:45] oh but it means a lot to me
[1:23:48] when realize that through faith I
[1:23:52] subdued spiritual realms
[1:23:55] I can conquer the devil's anointed
[1:23:59] spiritual Realm
[1:24:03] and walk away as a conqueror
[1:24:07] because the word says we're going to be
[1:24:09] Kings and Priests to our God
[1:24:11] there's our rulership there's our
[1:24:13] leadership there's a position
[1:24:15] amen
[1:24:17] so look at that now wrought
[1:24:18] righteousness obtained promises that's
[1:24:21] another one I highlighted here obtain
[1:24:24] promises does that mean they just went
[1:24:26] out found some promise and took holds of
[1:24:28] it no they recognized the promise that
[1:24:30] had been given to them and they took
[1:24:33] possession of it they no longer just
[1:24:36] talked about that promise my brother and
[1:24:38] sister let's not let this stumble us
[1:24:41] it's good to talk about the promises but
[1:24:44] there comes a day that we need to obtain
[1:24:48] that promise lay hands on that promise
[1:24:51] make that promise our promise and put it
[1:24:54] into action
[1:24:56] Hallelujah
[1:24:57] Hallelujah
[1:25:01] let me just bring this I wrote this
[1:25:03] little note here
[1:25:04] once again
[1:25:07] we're subduing kingdoms
[1:25:10] do we need to stop
[1:25:15] let's just say you're in your prayer
[1:25:16] closet you're in your car you're in your
[1:25:18] lip do you need to stop
[1:25:20] and look
[1:25:22] and make sure God's with you
[1:25:30] he said he would be
[1:25:32] he'll be there
[1:25:34] it's his promise to us
[1:25:37] it's ours to obtain
[1:25:40] don't let the devil say well look you're
[1:25:42] you're just going through a really hard
[1:25:44] time Where's God
[1:25:47] you know
[1:25:48] footsteps and the sands of time
[1:25:51] it's just a lovely illustration of that
[1:25:55] imagine if we could see that we're
[1:25:57] closing here
[1:25:58] imagine if you could see this Prophet
[1:26:00] Jason I think about this I'm sorry about
[1:26:02] using imagination in a negative
[1:26:04] connotation and also bringing back
[1:26:06] imagine if God was so gracious
[1:26:10] just like that little footsteps on the
[1:26:13] sands of time
[1:26:14] and he let us really truly experience
[1:26:17] what had happened
[1:26:19] now pardon me I would put this in just
[1:26:21] kind of a rough Realm
[1:26:24] we'd realize that those two marks was
[1:26:26] the tips of our toes because God's got
[1:26:28] our caller
[1:26:32] and at some point in time we're like hey
[1:26:34] hey I can walk now you'd say good
[1:26:38] now you say why'd you bring it out that
[1:26:40] way Paul
[1:26:41] because so many Christians
[1:26:43] got God babying them
[1:26:47] oh my poor little guy
[1:26:50] my poor little guy someday you'll be a
[1:26:53] rugged Warrior for me my poor little guy
[1:26:58] no sir I'm kind of the fashion I hope
[1:27:00] you all don't mind looking at me kind of
[1:27:02] starting here
[1:27:03] I hope you don't mind I'm more on the
[1:27:04] got the collar and your toes are
[1:27:06] dragging ditches
[1:27:07] and God's going to say man up
[1:27:10] has God ever said that to you
[1:27:13] I'm telling you God has said that to me
[1:27:15] more than once man up quit your
[1:27:18] whimpering quit your crying quit your
[1:27:20] sniveling
[1:27:21] I don't need your excuse I've heard them
[1:27:24] all in Generations before you ever got
[1:27:26] here so I don't need your excuse just
[1:27:28] man up
[1:27:29] go repent
[1:27:33] maybe it's not for you Ted but for me
[1:27:36] it was go repent
[1:27:39] okay we're hurrying even though it don't
[1:27:41] look like it
[1:27:42] sometimes they say slow is fast
[1:27:47] okay now here brother Branham I cut this
[1:27:50] a bunch of this out brother Branham is
[1:27:53] talking about the little lady that come
[1:27:55] to the table
[1:27:56] and approach Jesus
[1:28:00] now son of David
[1:28:03] we understand by Revelation that she
[1:28:06] approached him wrong but sincere
[1:28:09] right she had no office to approach him
[1:28:11] as son of David
[1:28:14] so put this in the context
[1:28:17] put back and shoved back and shoved out
[1:28:19] put outside whatever it was she was
[1:28:22] determined she was persistent
[1:28:25] perseverant something on the inside of
[1:28:28] her can anyone say Amen to that told her
[1:28:31] that she was going to get it regardless
[1:28:33] of how long she had to wait what she had
[1:28:37] to go through she would get it anyhow
[1:28:39] she was after the crumbs she didn't want
[1:28:42] a full course dinner she said the dogs
[1:28:44] eat the crumbs from under the master's
[1:28:46] table that's the way to do it
[1:28:48] oh wouldn't it be much better to have
[1:28:50] our lord Jesus recognize us call us to
[1:28:53] the front you know and say here we have
[1:28:55] this special plate for you a special
[1:28:56] place for you this woman was so desirous
[1:28:59] of receiving from the Lord that she
[1:29:02] would settle for a crumb and my brother
[1:29:05] and sister a crumb is all we need if we
[1:29:09] are sincere
[1:29:10] and the people I couldn't live on a
[1:29:12] crumb well
[1:29:14] you just never seem to come from the
[1:29:16] table of the king
[1:29:19] yep
[1:29:21] don't take the high seat
[1:29:24] take the back seat
[1:29:28] just be a little person
[1:29:31] wait don't you know I I'm a pastor
[1:29:35] don't you know I I've been all over the
[1:29:37] world
[1:29:38] don't you
[1:29:39] no just
[1:29:42] take a back seat
[1:29:44] just be little
[1:29:46] God will testify of the things
[1:29:50] oh my
[1:29:52] the Way Up Is Down always he that
[1:29:54] humbles himself shall be exalted he that
[1:29:57] exalts himself shall be abased the Way
[1:29:59] Up Is Down always remember she had never
[1:30:03] seen a miracle you know when I read this
[1:30:06] quote it really stunned me I had to go
[1:30:08] back and kind of like look at this and
[1:30:09] realize
[1:30:10] okay
[1:30:12] she wasn't going like well you did it
[1:30:14] for her did it for them did it for that
[1:30:15] did it for this family did for that
[1:30:17] family you know he's got to do it for me
[1:30:19] she just knew her Deliverance was in him
[1:30:23] her security was in him her healing was
[1:30:26] in him everything she had need of was in
[1:30:30] him
[1:30:33] she was a gentile but she had Faith she
[1:30:36] was something like the Harlot Rahab
[1:30:40] she said to the spies she didn't say
[1:30:43] wait till I see how Joshua Combs his
[1:30:45] hair
[1:30:47] what how does your generals all look
[1:30:50] or what kind of Swords do they use what
[1:30:54] instruments have they got
[1:30:56] what kind
[1:30:58] of warfare
[1:31:01] she said
[1:31:03] this struck me
[1:31:06] I've heard
[1:31:08] that God is with you
[1:31:12] that Saints we say what can I say to a
[1:31:14] co-worker
[1:31:18] sister April we've had these
[1:31:20] conversations about those
[1:31:22] what do we do what do we say
[1:31:25] we live it in such a fashion
[1:31:28] that their own words would be I know
[1:31:31] that God is with you amen there is when
[1:31:37] we can say thank you Lord I maybe have
[1:31:40] done something for the kingdom
[1:31:42] why just living
[1:31:45] it's living in
[1:31:49] I've heard that God is with you that's
[1:31:52] good enough for me
[1:31:54] I want Mercy
[1:31:56] she believed amen
[1:31:59] Hallelujah
[1:32:03] faith
[1:32:06] cometh by hearing that's right that's
[1:32:08] right hearing the word of God
[1:32:10] let's just stand sister Ruth if you
[1:32:13] would come brother Sean
[1:32:15] all I want to say tonight Saints to
[1:32:17] close this out I hope that maybe one
[1:32:19] word would stirred or inspired you just
[1:32:21] a little
[1:32:23] I just want to say tonight these are
[1:32:25] words from the prophet
[1:32:28] I want Mercy
[1:32:30] not Justice
[1:32:33] because if it was Justice I am condemned
[1:32:37] I want Mercy Lord
[1:32:39] I want Mercy and you have given me
[1:32:42] everything I need
[1:32:45] to be victorious in this Warfare
[1:32:49] Amen to be able to stand in this hour
[1:32:52] amen and tear down Saints we really
[1:32:55] didn't talk about strongholds so much
[1:32:58] but we did
[1:33:01] this is the hour
[1:33:03] believe
[1:33:05] if there's a stronghold in your life
[1:33:06] believe
[1:33:07] God has already equipped you to overcome
[1:33:10] that yes God has already given you what
[1:33:13] it takes to knock down the walls of the
[1:33:16] enemy and find deliverance we don't need
[1:33:19] they're good we need to have some more
[1:33:21] of that we'll have some things we'll
[1:33:22] announce here in the near future we need
[1:33:25] to have things my brother and sister but
[1:33:27] we don't need a great Revival that
[1:33:28] brother so and so preaches and then I'll
[1:33:31] get Deliverance no what we need to do is
[1:33:33] determine in our hearts the prophet of
[1:33:36] God said that determined in our hearts
[1:33:40] and God will bring you to that place
