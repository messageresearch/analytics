[1:16] God bless you this evening,
[1:18] man. Good to be here.
[1:21] Hallelujah.
[1:23] Just talking to brother Paul and I uh
[1:25] was driving to work this morning and
[1:27] just singing, praising the Lord and uh I
[1:31] had a whole list of songs that was
[1:33] perfect for service tonight. I
[1:34] remembered two of them.
[1:38] So, he had a different plan. Amen. Got
[1:40] to trust in that, right? Amen. Amen.
[1:44] Praise the Lord. Uh I want to sing
[1:47] Springs Living Water.
[1:51] Number 645. Sorry.
[2:00] I thirsted in the barren land of sin and
[2:05] shame and nothing satisfying there I
[2:09] found.
[2:11] But to the blessed cross of Christ, one
[2:15] day I came where springs of living water
[2:21] did abound.
[2:24] I'm drinking at the springs of living
[2:27] water.
[2:30] Happy now am I. My soul they satisfy.
[2:36] I'm looking at the springs of living
[2:40] water.
[2:43] Wonderful and bountiful supply.
[2:48] How sweet the living water from the
[2:52] hills of God. It makes me glad and happy
[2:57] all the way.
[3:00] Now, now glory, grace, and blessing mark
[3:04] the path I've tried. I'm shouting
[3:08] hallelujah every day.

[3:32] Oh, wonderful and bountiful supply.
[3:37] Oh sinner, won't you come today to
[3:41] Calvary?
[3:44] A fountain there is flowing deep and
[3:47] wide.
[3:50] The Savior now invites you to the water
[3:55] free where thirsting spirits can be
[3:59] satisfied.
[4:02] I'm drinking at the springs of living
[4:06] water.
[4:09] Happy now am I. My soul they satisfy.
[4:14] I'm drinking at the springs of living
[4:18] water.
[4:21] Oh, wonderful and bountiful supply.

[12:49] Sue for prayer. Her back has been
[12:52] bothering her a lot. She's a lot of
[12:54] pain. Um also for brother Dan. He's got
[12:56] a procedure tomorrow. Lord, just be with
[12:59] him with that. I know there's many
[13:02] others out there.

[13:13] Um,
[13:18] I know there was others, but don't
[13:20] remember them all. If you have something
[13:22] on your heart tonight, pray just lift
[13:24] your hand.
[13:28] Just bow our heads.
[13:31] Gracious heavenly father, we've come
[13:33] here this evening, Lord Jesus,
[13:36] to give you praise, to give you worship,
[13:38] Lord, to hear from you this evening,
[13:40] Lord God, how we love you, Lord God.
[13:45] how our hearts are just overflowing,
[13:47] Lord, sometimes with the love of God.
[13:50] Lord Jesus,
[13:54] just pray tonight, Lord God, that you
[13:56] just find the songs and the worship
[13:58] pleasing unto you, Lord God. May you
[14:00] just
[14:02] be found amongst us this evening, Lord
[14:04] Jesus, amongst your saints,
[14:08] Lord. And as we come before you this
[14:09] evening, you've heard these requests,
[14:10] Lord Jesus.
[14:12] the few here, Lord, the lifted hands,
[14:15] whatever they might be, the different
[14:17] ones, Lord, God, anyone online tonight,
[14:20] whatever it might be, Lord Jesus, you
[14:23] know each life, you know each need, each
[14:24] circumstance, each each thing, Lord
[14:28] Jesus, and we we're committing them unto
[14:30] you this evening, Lord God, knowing what
[14:31] your word says about each and every one
[14:33] of them, Lord.
[14:36] Lord, we're thankful for you, Lord
[14:38] Jesus.
[14:41] And Lord, we pray for brother Paul as
[14:43] he'd come and bring the word this
[14:44] evening. Lord, may just speak to each
[14:46] heart and each need, whatever it might
[14:48] be. Lord,
[14:50] we dedicate this time and this service
[14:52] into your hands. We dedicate our lives
[14:53] into your hands. Lord Jesus,
[14:56] help us, Lord Jesus, each day to serve
[14:58] you better,
[15:00] to be a better reflection of Christ to
[15:02] this world, Lord.
[15:05] Lord, as we
[15:08] go through our days, Lord Jesus, just
[15:10] help us, Lord Jesus, to be mindful of
[15:12] you, Lord, and in every situation, Lord,
[15:17] committed to you and let you have the
[15:18] preeminence, Lord. Let you rule the
[15:21] situation.
[15:23] Just take this time, Lord Jesus. We
[15:25] dedicate it unto you. Be with each one
[15:27] tonight. Each request, Lord Jesus, that
[15:30] we've said, Lord, each one, we ask it in
[15:33] Jesus name. Amen.
[15:36] Amen. You may have your seats.
[15:42] Number 705. I haven't sang this in a
[15:45] while.
[15:55] I think we can all say that this
[15:56] evening. I pledge allegiance to the
[15:58] lamb. Amen.
[16:01] I've heard how Christians
[16:06] long
[16:07] ago
[16:09] were brought before
[16:13] a tyrant
[16:15] throne. They were told
[16:18] that he would spare their lives. They
[16:24] wouldn't
[16:26] renounce
[16:28] the name of Christ.
[16:31] But one by one
[16:35] they chose to die,
[16:38] the son of God. They would not be
[16:45] like a great angelic
[16:50] choir
[16:52] sings. I can almost hear
[16:57] their voicees
[16:59] ring. I pledge
[17:02] alance
[17:04] to the land. With all my strength,
[17:11] with all I am, I will seek
[17:17] to honor
[17:19] his command.
[17:22] I pledge
[17:24] alent
[17:26] to
[17:28] the lamb.
[17:30] Now the years have come and the years
[17:36] have gone, but the cause of Jesus
[17:42] still goes on. Now our time has come to
[17:49] count the cost, to reject this world,
[17:56] to embrace the cross.
[18:00] So one by one
[18:03] let us live our lives
[18:07] for the one who died
[18:10] to give us life till the trumpet sound
[18:17] on that final day.
[18:21] Let us proudly stand
[18:24] and boldly
[18:26] say, I pledge
[18:30] alions
[18:32] to
[18:33] the lamb. With all my strength,
[18:39] with all I am, I will seek to honor
[18:46] his
[18:48] command. I pledge
[18:51] alce
[18:53] to
[18:55] the lamb
[18:57] to the lamb of God
[19:01] who bore my pain
[19:04] who took my place
[19:08] who wore my shame. I will see
[19:13] to honor
[19:15] his command. I pledge alce
[19:22] to
[19:24] the lamb.
[19:26] I pledge
[19:28] alance
[19:30] to
[19:32] the lamb.
[19:34] With all my strength,
[19:38] with all I am, I will seek to honor
[19:45] his command. I pledge
[19:50] alance
[19:52] to
[19:54] the lamb.
[19:58] Amen.
[20:01] Amen. Number 217.
[20:11] Consume me.
[20:19] Come consume
[20:23] me Lord
[20:26] with the fire of your spirit.
[20:33] Consume
[20:35] me Lord
[20:39] and make me more like you.
[20:47] Break
[20:49] me low
[20:53] and bless the broken
[20:57] pieces
[20:59] of my life.
[21:05] Let me be you
[21:10] Lord
[21:12] by you.
[21:18] Consume
[21:21] me Lord
[21:24] with the fire
[21:27] of your spirit.
[21:31] Consume
[21:34] me low
[21:38] and make me more like you.
[21:45] Break
[21:47] me Lord
[21:51] and bless the broken
[21:55] pieces
[21:56] of my life.
[22:03] Let me be you
[22:08] Lord
[22:09] by you.
[22:14] Amen.
[22:16] So we ask our brother Paul to come
[22:19] number 186 pleasing. Let me be pleasing
[22:22] to you Lord God.
[22:33] pleasing.
[22:38] Let me be pleasing
[22:43] to you.
[22:46] Let everything
[22:49] that I do
[22:53] be pleasing
[22:57] to you.
[23:01] Praying.
[23:05] Let everything
[23:09] thy pursue
[23:13] be pleasing,
[23:16] oh Lord,
[23:19] unto
[23:21] you.
[23:27] pleasing.
[23:32] Let me be pleasing
[23:36] to you
[23:40] and everything
[23:42] that I do
[23:46] be pleasing
[23:50] to you.
[23:54] Praying
[23:59] that everything
[24:02] I pursue
[24:07] be pleasing,
[24:10] oh Lord,
[24:12] unto you.
[24:17] One more time.
[24:20] pleasing.
[24:25] Let me be pleasing
[24:29] to you.
[24:32] Let everything
[24:35] that I do
[24:39] be pleasing
[24:43] to you.
[24:46] Pray
[24:51] that everything
[24:54] I pursue
[25:00] pleasing
[25:03] oh Lord
[25:05] unto
[25:06] you. Could we just stand and just lift
[25:10] our hands for a moment and just praise
[25:12] the Lord? Just thank him in your own way
[25:15] from your heart. just
[25:17] speak those things that are precious to
[25:19] you tonight. And knowing that God has
[25:23] given great gifts to his bride,
[25:26] he's given himself, which is the
[25:28] greatest gift that could be given.
[25:32] Oh Lord, how we just give you praise
[25:34] tonight,
[25:36] Lord, that you've come. You've made us a
[25:39] people that we're not a people, but you
[25:42] have made us your people. Oh, how
[25:45] blessed we are, Lord. To know you in
[25:48] spirit and in truth. To know you,
[25:51] Father, as a personal savior, a personal
[25:55] healer,
[25:57] our bridegroom.
[25:59] Oh Lord, how beautiful it is, Father,
[26:02] that you would come and choose us as
[26:05] your people. We just lift our hearts to
[26:08] you tonight, saying thank you. Thank
[26:11] you, Lord, for your many blessings
[26:13] you've poured out. So many, Father, we
[26:16] can hardly number them. Sometimes we can
[26:20] hardly even remember, Father. We just
[26:22] see you moving in every little thing of
[26:25] our life. We say thank you tonight,
[26:28] Lord.
[26:29] Oh, how we bless your holy name.
[26:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[26:36] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[26:40] the Lord tonight.
[26:42] Amen. I just uh was marveling how
[26:44] gracious the Lord is. I want to speak to
[26:47] you on the topic of all things are
[26:49] finished now. And uh just to see couple
[26:52] of the songs tonight. Uh actually more
[26:56] like three of them just touch along that
[26:58] line. and just really am thankful for
[27:00] what the Lord does for us. Because my
[27:04] brother and sister, we are here tonight.
[27:07] We are, you'd say, "But brother Paul,
[27:09] I'm still I'm still struggling. Still
[27:12] have things in my life." But let's look
[27:14] through God's lens tonight. And he says,
[27:16] "You are a finished work." Amen. And I
[27:20] think that we should rejoice in that. It
[27:23] shouldn't cause us to become lazy,
[27:25] complacent, or anything like that, but
[27:27] to rejoice that he says we are a
[27:29] finished work. Amen. And I I so
[27:32] appreciate that. Thank you, musicians.
[27:34] That was lovely tonight. Amen. All
[27:37] things are finished now. And this comes
[27:40] from a a quote that um as I was reading
[27:44] the other day, I come across a a quote.
[27:47] We'll touch on it here a little later.
[27:49] Let's turn in the book of Genesis 1. And
[27:52] uh we'll just look right here at the
[27:56] start of creation, how that we were
[27:59] placed there in that. And uh uh Genesis
[28:04] 1 and 24.
[28:06] Amen. So we're seeing this
[28:10] uh beautiful thing that we look at. And
[28:13] my brother and sister, we can look at
[28:15] this in creation. And I hope maybe catch
[28:17] a little bit from from my uh outlook of
[28:20] it uh here. And God said, "Let the earth
[28:23] bring forth the living creature after
[28:25] his kind,
[28:28] cattle and creeping thing, and beast of
[28:30] the earth after his kind." And it was
[28:32] so. And God made the beast of the earth
[28:35] after his kind, and cattle after their
[28:37] kind, and everything that creepeth upon
[28:39] the earth after his kind. And God saw
[28:42] that it was good. And God said, "Let us
[28:45] make man in our image, after our
[28:48] likeness. Let him let them have dominion
[28:51] over the fish of the sea, over the fowl
[28:53] of the air, over the cattle, over all
[28:56] the earth, and over every creeping thing
[28:58] that creepeth upon the earth." So God
[29:00] created man in his own image, in the
[29:03] image of God created he him. Male and
[29:06] female created he them. Amen.
[29:11] Lord, we just ask for your blessings
[29:13] upon the word tonight. Help us, Father,
[29:15] as we try to share this that's on our
[29:17] heart. Let it be a blessing. I pray in
[29:20] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may
[29:22] be seated. Now, we can look at creation,
[29:25] my brother and sister. Uh uh we we have
[29:28] a clear picture of our place in
[29:30] creation. And we can look at creation
[29:32] and say, "Wow, God made the earth and
[29:34] all these creatures. He made man." But I
[29:37] really want to focus tonight on in his
[29:40] image. Amen. Now there is a difference
[29:43] my brother and sister here and we could
[29:46] recognize that and the fact that that
[29:48] God shared with us and says you know
[29:50] what I want to see all mankind saved. I
[29:53] want to see everyone saved. But knowing
[29:56] that not everyone would accept the word.
[30:00] He come and he absolutely laid out a
[30:03] plan that there would be a people so
[30:05] created in his image. It would come
[30:08] right down to the very depths of the
[30:10] spiritual man would be in his perfect
[30:13] image. And so you think about yourself
[30:16] and you know it's not really about how
[30:18] we see oursel but we need to see
[30:21] ourselves in his image. We need to see
[30:23] ourselves how that he looked down upon
[30:26] us and how he created us to be a
[30:29] believer. Now remember the influence of
[30:31] Satan in his in this age in his Eden
[30:35] here is so powerful that if it were not
[30:38] the scripture tells us so that if it
[30:40] were not that God would shorten the time
[30:43] and that if they could be deceived they
[30:45] would be but they can't be. Amen. So you
[30:48] look at that that being in the very
[30:50] image of God that means that everything
[30:52] about us is after his image. So we have
[30:56] his faith, we have his desire, we have
[30:58] his thoughts, we have all of this. And
[31:01] so we see that God creating uh um nature
[31:06] in in his image. We'll see that how much
[31:09] more so the sons and daughters of God
[31:12] have been created in the image of God.
[31:14] Amen. And uh we'll look at this in
[31:16] Ephesians the 2 chapter uh and uh verses
[31:20] 10-14.
[31:23] And now God is not speaking my brother
[31:25] and sister to all of creation here. He
[31:28] is speaking to a very chosen people, a
[31:31] very select group. And and while in the
[31:34] religious world today uh they might say
[31:37] that you know you have a high opinion of
[31:40] yourself, you might even be told that
[31:42] you are a little bit arrogant to think
[31:44] that you are above and beyond special to
[31:47] the Lord. But my brother and sister, you
[31:50] see it says here in verse 10, for we are
[31:53] his workmanship created in Christ Jesus
[31:56] into good works. So there is a people
[31:59] whose works are going to be according to
[32:02] creation.
[32:04] I'd like to tie that together if I can
[32:06] tonight. In creation, God created a
[32:09] people that would have good works. Amen.
[32:12] Which God hath before ordained that we
[32:15] should walk in them. A a Amen. in
[32:18] Christ. And so look at that, my brother
[32:20] and sister. As we'll look now, we'll see
[32:23] that this creation that God was creating
[32:26] at that time was not just to populate
[32:28] the earth, but he was giving a creation
[32:31] as a habitation for sons and daughters
[32:34] of God that would be created in Christ
[32:37] Jesus in good works. Amen. So it's there
[32:40] that God is giving the opportunity and
[32:43] uh we have to understand you know the
[32:45] realm of free moral agency and look at
[32:48] that that God's not forcing anyone
[32:50] whether we are young or old God will not
[32:52] force you to serve him but he will make
[32:56] it where you will desire to serve him.
[32:58] He he has a way of bringing us to that
[33:01] place. And he says, "Wherefore remember
[33:04] that ye being in time past Gentiles in
[33:06] the flesh, who are called uncircumcised
[33:09] by that which is called circumcision in
[33:12] the flesh made by hands, that at that
[33:14] time ye were without Christ, being
[33:17] aliens from the commonwealth of Israel,
[33:19] strangers from the covenant of promise,
[33:22] having no hope, without God in the
[33:25] world. But now in Christ Jesus. See,
[33:28] this is a creation still unfolding. God
[33:31] didn't come along and say, "Oh, here's a
[33:33] people. I think I'll just go save them."
[33:35] But you see, we were already in him,
[33:37] created in him. So now, if you want to
[33:40] put it like this, a little awkward to
[33:43] say it this way, but this is the
[33:45] evolution of the gospel because God knew
[33:48] that at a certain time or place that his
[33:51] creation would be manifested. And so
[33:54] it's there not by accident. We didn't
[33:56] just somehow just skip the
[33:57] Philadelphiaian church age or Ephesus,
[33:59] but we were called to this day. And God
[34:02] had that in the plan from the very
[34:05] beginning. So we were sometimes a far
[34:08] off. Amen. But we've been made nigh by
[34:11] the blood of Christ. For he's our peace
[34:14] who hath made both one and hath broken
[34:17] down the middle wall of partition
[34:19] between us. So we see that we were
[34:22] without God. Amen. Coming along and as
[34:25] creation was unfolding, being made in
[34:28] this image, it starts to unfold where we
[34:31] being created to serve him, created to
[34:34] love him, created to follow him. Amen.
[34:37] That in that realm, it come forth. Amen.
[34:39] Just as our uh young children here in
[34:42] the church, we could not ask them to go
[34:45] tomorrow and and uh drive the car. I
[34:48] imagine they would love to but uh you
[34:50] can't uh you know ask more of them of
[34:52] the season but in the season God brings
[34:55] about a desire and in the season they
[34:58] are a reflection of the very creation
[35:00] that God created them and that's why we
[35:03] see the difference where some might come
[35:05] and desire to be baptized as young
[35:08] children six or seven years old some it
[35:11] takes time they'll be maybe in their 20s
[35:13] and and that before that fully comes to
[35:16] a revelation to them. But the reality of
[35:19] it is is at the time that God appointed,
[35:22] they will come forth because God created
[35:25] them to come forth in that season. Now,
[35:28] you can look at this, my brother and
[35:30] sister, in a real technical form, but I
[35:32] believe sometimes we should just keep
[35:34] things in simplicity
[35:37] to know that if God has called us, our
[35:39] season of manifestation will come and it
[35:42] will be in God's season, not man's
[35:44] season. And so I I kind of titled or or
[35:48] put a label there that this is a
[35:50] transitional scripture because as we'll
[35:53] look at this, it says that he's our
[35:55] peace who have made uh ma been who hath
[35:59] made both one and have broken down the
[36:01] middle wall of partition between us. So
[36:03] we'll look at this position of mankind
[36:06] how it comes down. But look how much
[36:08] greater as the bride of Jesus Christ our
[36:12] position in Jesus Christ is. We are not
[36:14] just a part of creation out here to
[36:16] acknowledge there is a God. But as we'll
[36:19] go along here, I hope that it becomes
[36:21] very plain. Now in the sermon, what
[36:24] shall I do with Jesus called Christ?
[36:26] Brother Brandham says, notice God's
[36:28] daughter, the church, the bride, is also
[36:32] a product of God and his word uniting
[36:35] the Holy Spirit uniting in a body of
[36:38] flesh. It produced a son of God, a
[36:41] product of righteousness of God. And in
[36:44] the last day, we're told, as it was in
[36:46] the days of Sodom, the bride will be
[36:48] united by the word of God made manifest
[36:52] in the flesh, the Holy Spirit sealing
[36:55] them unto God, sealing unbelief out on
[36:59] the outside. So, we're now seeing this
[37:01] this this maturing of of the of the
[37:04] creation. It's coming forth that now
[37:07] it's coming to a place that it's being
[37:09] united. It wasn't always united
[37:11] according to the scripture, but it's
[37:13] being brought into a united state. And
[37:15] God comes and he says, "You know what?
[37:18] I'm not I'm not here. I'm not afraid of
[37:20] what's going to happen in the life of my
[37:22] bride. I'm I'm not God's not running
[37:24] around in fear that you're going to be
[37:26] lost. He's not fretting every day that
[37:28] you're going to just give up and walk
[37:30] away." But he knows what his word is
[37:32] doing. And so now it is coming forth in
[37:36] a manifestation in the flesh. And we're
[37:39] sitting here tonight and we can say this
[37:41] word has come to pass. This word of God
[37:44] is sitting right here tonight fulfilled.
[37:46] And that Holy Spirit is sealing them
[37:49] into God. So we're not sealed into fear.
[37:52] We're not sealed into anxieties or
[37:54] depressions, but we're sealed into God.
[37:57] We're sealed by the Holy Spirit, which
[38:00] is that part of God coming down. And so
[38:03] it's him coming and doing the very work
[38:05] that we long for, the very thing that we
[38:07] cry for to be sealed with the Holy
[38:10] Ghost. He's coming down. He's doing
[38:12] that. It's not left to another
[38:14] discretion. It's not left to uh
[38:16] something that would be accidental or
[38:18] incidental, but it is God himself
[38:20] coming. And so he's there sealing
[38:23] unbelief out. Now, that doesn't mean
[38:26] that Satan won't come. Remember, the
[38:27] prophet of God said that it would be
[38:29] like the bird flying over. Now my
[38:32] brother and sister, you can't stop the
[38:33] bird from flying over, but you can stop
[38:36] him from building a nest. Amen. And so
[38:39] we'll look in this age that while we
[38:41] would one day in service, in prayer, in
[38:44] whatever it might be, just feel like
[38:46] we're on top of the world, but then
[38:48] circumstance will come and we will we
[38:52] will find ourselves in a battle. Amen.
[38:55] And the prophet of God talking about
[38:57] battles. You know, everything that we
[38:59] will gain as sons and daughters of God
[39:02] must actually be brought through
[39:04] warfare, through a battle. We are more
[39:07] than conquerors. That's not just a
[39:09] phrase, my brother and sister, but
[39:11] that's what God is doing through his
[39:12] bride. We shouldn't lament. We shouldn't
[39:15] cry about the trials that we have. We
[39:17] should look for God in the trial. And in
[39:20] the midst of that trial, we will see God
[39:23] if we look for him. Amen. Because he's
[39:26] always present. Amen. And so we'll look
[39:29] at this now when it says here, Brother
[39:31] Brown puts it that way, sealing unbelief
[39:33] out on the outside. Now, we'll have
[39:36] doubts. We'll have fears. There'll be
[39:38] things that will be spoken. There'll be
[39:40] little things that are planted here and
[39:42] there, my brother and sister. But when
[39:44] you see unbelief in a believer, it is a
[39:49] temporary warfare that he is having with
[39:51] Satan because the Holy Spirit will seal
[39:55] that unbelief out and you will overcome
[39:58] it. Every question that there is. Amen.
[40:01] And brother Brandham goes on to say, as
[40:02] I said, if the life of Behovven was in
[40:05] you, you would live like Behovven. If
[40:08] the life of Hitler was in you, you would
[40:10] live like Hitler. And when the life of
[40:13] Christ is in you, you'll live like
[40:16] Christ. This is the manifestation of
[40:20] those who were created in his image in
[40:23] the spiritual realm. Amen. Created to be
[40:26] those believers to possess the word, to
[40:29] speak the word, to live the word. So
[40:31] when we would see that Christ is here,
[40:34] my brother and sister, we will live like
[40:37] Christ because we are Christ. Amen. We
[40:42] are of his very DNA. And it's a
[40:45] wonderful world we live in. We were just
[40:47] visiting about that the other day. How
[40:49] DNA, you can figure out relatives, you
[40:52] can figure out that they solve crimes
[40:54] with it and all these things. My brother
[40:56] and sister, let's bring that over into
[40:58] the house of God. Who are we? Amen. We
[41:01] shouldn't even have a question of who we
[41:03] are. We can trace it right back and it's
[41:06] proven to be 100% accurate. Amen. It's
[41:09] not a guess or a hope, but it is the
[41:12] life of Christ manifested through his
[41:15] manifested bride. Amen. And so you look
[41:18] at that. Amen. We'll live like Christ.
[41:20] And you say, "But I I don't always live
[41:22] like Christ." Look at it from God's
[41:24] view. Look at it from where God's
[41:27] looking at it. Don't look at it from the
[41:28] way the devil's looking at it. You need
[41:30] to focus on the word. Amen. And that'll
[41:34] be if Christ lived today, he would do
[41:38] exactly what the word said he would do
[41:40] today. And the word said he's the same
[41:42] yesterday, today, and forever. Why can't
[41:44] this blind ecclesiastical world see the
[41:47] time that they're living in? See? Amen.
[41:50] Now, think about this. I want to go
[41:52] back, catch this paragraph for just a
[41:53] moment. H. If Christ lived today, he
[41:56] would do exactly what the word said he
[41:58] would do today. My brother and sister,
[42:00] do you realize that the very word that
[42:03] would be giving direction if Jesus
[42:05] Christ was here is the very exact word
[42:08] that's giving direction to you and I?
[42:10] Amen. He wouldn't have a word for
[42:12] himself and a different word for you.
[42:15] But he's got one word. Amen. He doesn't
[42:18] have two interpretations or three
[42:20] interpretations. He has one. And the
[42:22] prophet of God showed us very clearly
[42:24] that Christ interprets his own word. So
[42:27] as it is, we are here. Amen. If the Lord
[42:30] Jesus walked in this church tonight, my
[42:33] brother and sister, he would hold to the
[42:35] very same word that he is giving to you
[42:37] and I to be overcomers in this hour. And
[42:40] he overcome in that day. Amen. And so
[42:43] it's guaranteeing as he come in this
[42:46] day, he would be an overcomer. And
[42:48] because we are of him, we are overcomers
[42:51] also. Amen. We don't always feel like
[42:54] it, do we? Sometimes things come as
[42:56] circumstances, but I tell you, it's the
[42:59] truth.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I would say, Lord, grant us
[43:02] the faith to take a hold of this.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; We're not we're not given a lesser
[43:07] power. We're not given a a lesser word
[43:09] or lesser authority. Amen. I want you to
[43:12] just ponder this for a moment. When the
[43:14] word says that whatever we bind on earth
[43:17] will be bound in heaven and whatever we
[43:18] loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
[43:21] Do you realize my brother and sister
[43:22] that's not even you speaking the words
[43:25] that bind, it's not you speaking the
[43:27] words that loose, but it's Christ
[43:29] speaking through you. So it's not us in
[43:32] our ability binding. So if you got a
[43:35] situation and and you say, "I want to
[43:37] bind this in the name of Jesus Christ."
[43:39] My brother and sister, you got to
[43:40] remember, don't let Satan get in your
[43:42] mind. It's not you that's doing the
[43:45] binding. It's Christ in you. You the
[43:48] word speaking says I bind this spirit or
[43:51] I loose my brother or sister from their
[43:54] circumstance that they could be blessed
[43:56] of God. It's not you speaking it. It's
[43:59] not you doing it, but it's the very
[44:01] manifest life of Christ in you.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So sometimes we get to thinking,
[44:07] you know, oh, oh, you know, I I how
[44:10] could I tell you as a minister and
[44:12] there's a pattern? I I started to
[44:14] recognize it, you know, that when Satan
[44:16] just comes and really hammers on me, I
[44:19] find that it's that day or the next, my
[44:22] phone will ring and there'll be someone
[44:24] in need. Amen. And Satan recognizes a
[44:28] circumstance and he's trying to come to
[44:30] where we won't even have faith ourself
[44:33] or confidence oursel to pray to bind a
[44:36] spirit to loose a spirit cuz he wants to
[44:38] beat on us first. So we can't offer
[44:41] anything to our brother or sister. But
[44:43] you got to remember even if Satan does
[44:45] beat on you, it's not you. Amen. We are
[44:49] fulfilling the word. We're speaking the
[44:51] word and it's Christ in us that is
[44:54] fulfilling that word and bringing it to
[44:56] pass. Amen. I'm telling you, if we had
[44:59] to rely on our own ability to loose or
[45:01] to bind, we would be in trouble. But
[45:04] when we recognize it's actually Christ
[45:06] in us and Satan is coming up and saying,
[45:09] you know what, I'm going to bind them so
[45:12] they won't have the confidence. They
[45:14] won't be able to speak out to do this.
[45:16] But when you stop and say, "Wait, I
[45:18] could never bind that spirit anyway.
[45:20] It's my petition to my father, to my
[45:23] bridegroom, and he's doing the binding.
[45:26] All I've got to do is open my mouth. All
[45:28] I've got to do is speak the word, and
[45:30] God will take care of it from there."
[45:32] Amen. Amen. Now, I want to take another
[45:35] look at this finished product to carry
[45:37] this forward in the quote in the faith.
[45:41] Amen. There's a lot more here, but I
[45:43] realize tonight we just we can't spend
[45:45] all night. Amen. Now, there's no one can
[45:49] heal.
[45:51] Healing is a finished product of God.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; So, we're not looking out here trying to
[45:59] find enough faith
[46:02] &gt;&gt; to bring healing.
[46:06] What we've got to do is actually enter
[46:07] into the promise that's already given
[46:10] and say it's not me anyhow, but I I have
[46:14] to submit everything that is me. All
[46:17] that I am, I have to submit that and I
[46:20] got to give it to God. Amen. I can't I
[46:22] can't hold on to my own interpretation,
[46:25] my own feeling, my own doubt, my own
[46:27] fear, my own ability, whatever. I can't
[46:29] hold on to that and expect God to move.
[46:32] But when we'll come and realize that
[46:34] healing is a finished product of God,
[46:37] what we've got to do is bring our pla
[46:39] self to a place that we have full
[46:41] acceptance.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. That this is a full acceptance
[46:45] that we have as submitting ourself.
[46:48] Actually, you know, it seems
[46:50] counterintuitive of our our natural self
[46:52] to say, you know what, Lord, I'm
[46:54] submitting myself to be healed.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to fight for my healing.
[47:01] I'm not trying to wrestle the devil for
[47:03] my healing. Actually, it comes down to I
[47:06] am submitting myself that you can heal
[47:10] this body because this body is your body
[47:13] and I'm yielding this body that you can
[47:15] do what you want with this body. Amen.
[47:18] But boy, I tell you, it can be hard
[47:20] sometimes. Amen. There's no one can
[47:23] heal. Healing is a finished product of
[47:25] God. If any man tells you that he can
[47:27] heal you, if he's a doctor and can tell
[47:29] you he can heal you, he's wrong. There
[47:31] is only one healer, that's God. And a
[47:34] doctor can give medicine. And brother
[47:36] Brandham goes on, I just pulled that out
[47:38] because I love that fact that healing is
[47:41] a finished product. In other words, I'm
[47:43] not going to produce healing. You're not
[47:45] going to produce healing. We're going to
[47:48] accept our healing that is already been
[47:52] manifested for you and I. Amen. So it's
[47:55] not a matter of what we can do other
[47:57] than acceptance
[47:59] &gt;&gt; to say Lord I give this body to you.
[48:02] Heal it if you want to heal it. Take it
[48:04] if you want to take it. Whatever you
[48:06] want to do with it Lord I give it to
[48:08] you.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:11] Now you see in Jeremiah 8:22.
[48:15] Now we look there. It says is there no
[48:17] balm in Gilead.
[48:20] Is there no physician there? Why then is
[48:23] not the health of the daughter of my
[48:24] people recovered? Now look at this my
[48:28] brother and sister. How sometimes that
[48:32] in the struggle of life in in issues
[48:34] with our health that it just seems like
[48:38] sometimes nothing goes right.
[48:43] And we would wonder,
[48:46] Lord, where is your healing? Of course,
[48:49] we've already read where the prophet
[48:50] said, "It's a finished.
[48:54] It's a finished work." Amen. It's it's
[48:56] done.
[48:59] Where is the physician?
[49:02] Why is there sickness amongst the
[49:04] people?
[49:06] My brother and sister, there is balm in
[49:08] Gilead.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; God is present.
[49:14] It's in the time of trouble,
[49:18] the time of distress.
[49:21] This is a human thing. Uh it's it's we
[49:23] should understand it because we're all
[49:25] humans as far as I know here tonight.
[49:29] But when life is too easy, we go into
[49:33] slack mode.
[49:35] We we we go easy with it.
[49:38] We wonder why we have trials and
[49:40] troubles and we're distressed on every
[49:43] side is because like an army that's in a
[49:47] territory where the enem is at, they
[49:49] must be diligent. They must be prepared.
[49:53] And God allows trouble to come our way.
[49:56] He uses these circumstances so that we
[49:59] don't become fat, doy Christians.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not talking about in the
[50:04] physical element. I'm talking
[50:05] spiritually. We can sit around and say,
[50:07] "Oh, God's blessed me so much. God's
[50:09] blessed me so much." Until we don't look
[50:11] for nothing. We don't do nothing. We are
[50:14] not ready for anything. We are just
[50:16] sitting around almost boasting about
[50:18] what God's already done for us. But God
[50:20] wants an army that's ready to fight.
[50:22] Amen. He wants a people. And so, you
[50:25] have to actually to be ready for these
[50:28] battles, we have to face an enemy. We
[50:31] have to have something that we are are
[50:34] are ready and coming to the Lord
[50:36] constantly, you might say, to be
[50:39] prepared that we would be asking him for
[50:42] strength and for faith and for wisdom,
[50:44] for leadership, all of these things. He
[50:46] wants us to be in that position. Amen.
[50:49] That is not the kind of army that lays
[50:52] around. This is a kind of army that's up
[50:55] and ready for the battle. Amen. Ready to
[50:57] respond to the enemy coming on the
[51:00] scene. And I would say that no matter
[51:02] how uh we have been hurt, how we hurt,
[51:06] how deep the wound is, whether it's
[51:09] physically, emotionally, spiritually,
[51:11] amen, there is a balm in Gilead. There's
[51:14] an an ointment in the word that is here
[51:18] to bring healing and bring relief to us.
[51:21] It doesn't matter what we have faced,
[51:23] but there is balm in Gilead, my brother
[51:26] and sister. And the Holy Spirit will
[51:27] come and move in our midst if we're
[51:30] seeking him. If we're longing for a
[51:33] healing, amen, it's not just a physical
[51:35] body. If we're longing for a spiritual
[51:38] healing, an emotional healing, amen,
[51:40] physical healing also. There is a bomb.
[51:44] This relief that comes. Amen. We don't
[51:46] have to sit here and say, "I hope he
[51:48] will come." He's here.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet of God speaking to us.
[51:53] Amen. And he is there in the seals and
[51:56] talking about that. And you know, my
[51:58] brother and sister people, you would
[51:59] think it would be obvious to them, but
[52:01] the prophet of God then says a pause
[52:03] there and says, "He is here." Amen. Our
[52:07] bomb is here. Our physician is here
[52:10] tonight. We're not hoping he come. We
[52:13] can SAY TONIGHT, I KNOW THAT MY
[52:15] PHYSICIAN is here. And he's not just a
[52:18] physician. He's a great physician. Amen.
[52:22] He's the one that can take every need
[52:25] that we have, every circumstance we
[52:27] have. Amen. And he can set it right, set
[52:30] it in order. Amen. I say once again, the
[52:33] great physician is here tonight. And we
[52:36] should not sit here tonight with
[52:38] anxiety, doubt, or fear. We need to give
[52:41] a complete surrender to that and say,
[52:45] Lord, hey, this body is the body you
[52:48] give me to dwell in. It's really not
[52:50] even who I am, but I'm here to give it
[52:54] back to you, Lord, that whatever you
[52:56] choose to do with it.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother and sister, it's so hard
[53:01] for us sometimes to let go. But God's
[53:04] looking for a people that are going to
[53:06] just let go. As the song says, let go
[53:09] and let God. Amen. It's not what we can
[53:12] do. It's what we will surrender ourself
[53:15] for him to do in us.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the prophet of God
[53:23] says in the message, the token,
[53:28] and this might be one of your shorter
[53:30] Wednesday night services. I don't know.
[53:34] This is just what was on my heart.
[53:38] In the token, he says, "Listen close
[53:40] while I make this closing remarks."
[53:44] If Satan tries to hand you some of this
[53:47] stuff like sickness,
[53:50] you know what to do. Just show him the
[53:54] token.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; That's right. Exactly.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; See how important the token is to the
[53:58] bride of Christ. It's not just a
[54:00] catchphrase or or some kind of of
[54:03] something that the message has produced.
[54:05] But the token is so powerful. Amen. That
[54:08] when we can come and actually literally
[54:11] possess the token, my brother and
[54:13] sister, it is a powerful tool for the
[54:16] bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. So he says
[54:19] here, now you know what you do. Just
[54:21] show him the token. Now my brother and
[54:23] sister, this will be a little
[54:24] straightforward. I hope it doesn't
[54:25] offend anybody. This is not the same as
[54:28] people who are living any old way and
[54:31] then coming and showing us telling the
[54:33] devil, I I got a message book. I believe
[54:35] the message. Leave me alone. That's not
[54:37] the token.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Christ himself is the token. He's the
[54:41] seal. Amen. That's what we're looking
[54:44] for. Not just words. Man can say
[54:46] anything he wants to say, but God's
[54:49] looking for a life. He's looking for a
[54:51] trust that we would give that will fully
[54:54] bring us into submission to the word.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Just show him the token. I
[55:01] am a purchased product. Now, this quote
[55:05] right here is what caught my attention
[55:06] on this whole thing. You know, we're
[55:08] just products.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Think about this. We're just
[55:12] products. Amen. I don't mean that
[55:14] lightly. I don't mean to make light of
[55:16] that. But you see what it is is without
[55:19] God creating us in the beginning with
[55:23] the ability to believe, we could never
[55:26] make ourselves believe.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; But when he spoke our name before the
[55:32] foundation of the world, he sent forth
[55:36] that spirit with that. Amen. As it would
[55:39] be that he spoke the names and he sent
[55:41] them out into time. Amen. My brother and
[55:43] sister, you look at this also actually
[55:45] into eternity. Amen. We just eclipse
[55:48] time until we step into eternity. But
[55:50] it's there. That word in us, that
[55:53] creative word created you as a believer
[55:57] before the foundation of the world. You
[56:00] could not be anything else. The prophet
[56:02] of God put it this way. He said, "If you
[56:04] weren't in him, then you won't be in him
[56:08] now."
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's not like we can put
[56:11] oursel into this. Right?
[56:15] &gt;&gt; And this is how we see people that agree
[56:18] with every drop of the message.
[56:22] But there's no life. There's no fire.
[56:24] There's nothing there to take them in to
[56:28] be not judgmental, but to just clench it
[56:30] to that. There's no token.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[56:38] Imagine
[56:40] in Egypt,
[56:43] God speaks to Moses and tells them, "You
[56:45] know what? They've got to uh they've got
[56:48] to uh kill the lamb, put the blood over
[56:50] the the lentil, the doorpost."
[56:53] And I imagine, I'm sorry, just I have a
[56:56] vivid imagination.
[56:58] Imagine somebody would say, "You know, I
[57:01] don't really understand how it will
[57:02] work, but having lamb tonight does sound
[57:06] good."
[57:07] So wife, cook a lamb.
[57:11] My brother and sister, that wouldn't do
[57:12] it.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; It had to be a revelation to them that
[57:16] this blood was going to seal, Amen. the
[57:20] token of my home and it will keep my
[57:24] wife and my children, especially my
[57:26] eldest, shall keep them safe.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; And that revelation took him out there.
[57:32] And that would be a daddy that stood
[57:34] there with a hissup in the blood on the
[57:36] door and explained it to his son. The
[57:38] token is going to seal us, son. In the
[57:42] day that we're living, in this day of
[57:43] evil spirits, in this day that death is
[57:46] at the doorstep, this token is going to
[57:49] seal Satan outside AND SEAL THE BLOOD OF
[57:54] JESUS CHRIST INSIDE. This is our
[57:57] salvation. Amen.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; And there would be a young man that
[58:00] would grow off that being anchored in
[58:02] his mind. And then, my brother and
[58:04] sister, you see, God didn't allow the
[58:06] windows to be sealed so tight. And they
[58:08] could see the wailing and hear the
[58:10] wailing and the nashing of teeth and the
[58:12] cries and maybe the whoosh of the death
[58:14] angel going down the street. And my
[58:17] brother and sister, if we have ears to
[58:19] hear today, we're hearing the size and
[58:22] the cry and we're hearing that and the
[58:24] death angel is going whoosh down the
[58:27] street and we see it all around us. Oh
[58:29] God, help us to seal our house. Amen. To
[58:32] seal our lives, to seal ourselves
[58:35] completely into the word
[58:37] &gt;&gt; because explaining that you believe God
[58:40] sent a prophet to the devil won't
[58:42] impress him at all. In fact, the prophet
[58:45] of God told us he knows this word better
[58:47] than we do. So that he would say, "So
[58:49] what? So what? So what?" But when you
[58:52] have got the token, Amen. What would he
[58:55] say? You know what you do? Just show him
[58:58] the token. It's not words, my brother
[59:00] and sister. IT'S THE LIFE THAT'S ON
[59:02] DISPLAY. SHOWS THAT THIS LIFE HAS BEEN
[59:05] SEALED by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then Satan knows he cannot
[59:10] touch that.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; My healing's been paid for. I let me
[59:14] back up. I am We ought to say that
[59:16] together. Is that okay? Can we say it
[59:18] together? I am a purchase product. Amen.
[59:23] To know that,
[59:24] &gt;&gt; to realize that it's not just lip
[59:27] service to a message cuz this is seems
[59:30] better than everything else. This is
[59:32] what God has given. My healing's been
[59:36] paid for. I'm a product of God because I
[59:38] have the token of the Holy Ghost. You
[59:41] cannot keep me off this highway. Amen.
[59:43] We ought to repeat that together. You
[59:45] cannot keep me off of this highway,
[59:47] Satan. Amen. You might cause me to
[59:49] stumble. You might cause me to get
[59:51] detourred or turned around a little bit,
[59:53] but you won't keep me off of this
[59:55] highway.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; You cannot keep me from my health. I
[59:58] present the token and I show you that my
[1:00:01] by his stripes I was healed. Here is the
[1:00:04] resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:00:07] right
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; in me.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Now, right. Amen.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; We're not trying to labor to get to
[1:00:14] that. We're not trying to earn that.
[1:00:16] We're not trying to find that as some
[1:00:18] kind of a concept or find an anchor for
[1:00:21] it and scripture to explain it all. My
[1:00:24] my brother and sister, how can you
[1:00:27] explain that the literal life of Jesus
[1:00:30] Christ is living in you?
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; People would say, "I believe the same
[1:00:35] thing. I believe the same thing. I
[1:00:37] believe the same thing." But my brother
[1:00:39] and sister, it's the life that is the
[1:00:41] evidence.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Write in me now to prove it to you. Oh,
[1:00:49] there is the real thing.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; There is the token.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; I say tonight, Lord, help us. Amen. If
[1:00:57] we've left even one little portion of
[1:00:59] that undone, help us, Lord, to get this
[1:01:03] completely sealed with the token with
[1:01:05] the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Is it okay to be excited tonight?
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to jump off course just a
[1:01:15] tad bit here.
[1:01:17] Uh if you're not familiar with it, you
[1:01:20] could open your Bibles to Romans 1, but
[1:01:22] Romans 1 is a clear picture of the
[1:01:24] spirits and the conditions of this age.
[1:01:27] Yeah, it lays it out so clearly. I don't
[1:01:29] know how anyone could miss it. I don't
[1:01:31] know how there could be an argument
[1:01:33] amongst some of these denominations
[1:01:36] about whether these things are
[1:01:37] acceptable, whether people are
[1:01:39] Christians or not. Obviously, they've
[1:01:41] ripped Romans out of their Bible.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; They have totally ignored it because it
[1:01:46] is so cut and dried plain. But as we're
[1:01:49] looking at this, we see the conditions
[1:01:50] of this age. And one way to look at this
[1:01:54] is God through the word has said, "I've
[1:01:58] left an imprint of myself on them." That
[1:02:03] is on the unbeliever.
[1:02:06] Now,
[1:02:08] it doesn't appear that there's an
[1:02:10] imprint there, but if you'll be patient
[1:02:12] with me, I'll I'll take you through
[1:02:14] this.
[1:02:15] God's left an imprint from his word on
[1:02:19] them. Amen.
[1:02:22] And he didn't always do it through the
[1:02:24] preaching of the word.
[1:02:27] He did it through nature.
[1:02:30] And the word says that they would do
[1:02:32] things that would be unseeming.
[1:02:36] So men with men, women with women,
[1:02:39] nature will not support that. So right
[1:02:43] before them is nature. God has imprinted
[1:02:47] nature there. And so what what this
[1:02:50] scripture, if I could just loosely
[1:02:53] interpret it, not not just playing with
[1:02:55] it, but just to loosely put it,
[1:02:58] they
[1:03:00] know
[1:03:02] no matter what spirits on them,
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; that imprint has left them that this is
[1:03:09] not right.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; But you see, there's not enough of
[1:03:14] anything in them.
[1:03:17] The scripture says that they give
[1:03:19] themselves over.
[1:03:21] Now, if you've caught it already, that's
[1:03:24] wonderful. But we're talking about
[1:03:27] surrendering into our healing,
[1:03:28] surrendering into our ceiling. You see,
[1:03:31] we're giving ourselves over. This is the
[1:03:34] counter type to the bride of Christ
[1:03:37] completely giving herself over to the
[1:03:40] leadership of the Holy Spirit. Now the
[1:03:42] counter type of this we see in Romans 1
[1:03:45] that they are there completely giving
[1:03:48] themselves over. Amen. Now I'm telling
[1:03:51] you every one of us that gives oursel
[1:03:54] completely over to Jesus Christ
[1:03:56] submitting to the Holy Ghost there are
[1:03:58] little things. We've been taught things
[1:04:00] in a in previous church and previous
[1:04:02] teaching and just all these things that
[1:04:05] Satan would put out little doubts. But
[1:04:07] when we give ourselves completely over,
[1:04:09] the Holy Spirit takes us up and over all
[1:04:12] of those challenges and leads us right
[1:04:14] into the token. Now, my brother and
[1:04:17] sister, here is this counter type. Sorry
[1:04:19] to bring it up, but we needed to preach
[1:04:21] the truth. Amen. This is there. And they
[1:04:24] know that those things are not right
[1:04:27] there. But they give themselves over to
[1:04:31] that spirit. Amen. That means there was
[1:04:34] a willingness in there to do that. They
[1:04:37] didn't just accidentally find themselves
[1:04:39] there, but there's a willingness to give
[1:04:41] themselves over to that. And we see this
[1:04:44] dividing that's coming in the day. And
[1:04:46] so God has left his imprint on them
[1:04:50] regardless of what they choose to do.
[1:04:52] See, because as I already spoke, nature
[1:04:55] will show them what is right and wrong.
[1:04:57] Amen. And the prophet of God, he used
[1:04:59] nature to show the very aspect or very
[1:05:04] uh um well, let me just make it simple.
[1:05:07] He used nature to show the nature of
[1:05:08] God.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; And so, we'll see how that while nature
[1:05:13] leaves an imprint on you and I because
[1:05:15] we're seeing God in his in his creation,
[1:05:18] we're seeing God in his universe, as it
[1:05:20] would be, my brother and sister, that
[1:05:22] imprint is left over on the other side
[1:05:25] to judge them. Now my brother and
[1:05:27] sister, how much more should this
[1:05:29] imprint of the Holy Spirit be upon you
[1:05:32] and I? Amen. It should be so manifest
[1:05:35] upon the believer that we would
[1:05:37] recognize that just about everything I'm
[1:05:40] doing, every every uncction that I have
[1:05:43] is God imprinting this upon me. You
[1:05:45] might call it anointing, you might call
[1:05:47] it leadership, you might call it many
[1:05:49] things, but it's God putting an imprint
[1:05:51] on us that we can see who we are. And my
[1:05:55] brother and sister, let's face it,
[1:05:57] sometimes yielding to the word can be
[1:06:00] difficult.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; We're bringing this flesh
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; into subjection.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; There are writers there in the time
[1:06:09] coming up in the dark ages that wrote
[1:06:13] things such as the nature of man
[1:06:16] is a beast
[1:06:19] without subjection.
[1:06:23] And so you look at that and realize just
[1:06:25] how blessed we are that God's anointed
[1:06:28] us in this hour that we could literally
[1:06:31] come and by the uncction and the moving
[1:06:33] of the Holy Spirit, we can come and say,
[1:06:35] "Yes, Lord. Yes, we can come and just
[1:06:37] yield ourselves into the things of God."
[1:06:40] My brother and sister, I'm not preaching
[1:06:42] about the rights and wrong. I'm talking
[1:06:44] about what God's done for you tonight.
[1:06:46] And sometimes we don't even recognize
[1:06:48] the depth of what he's done. We don't
[1:06:50] realize the breadth of what he's done,
[1:06:52] the blessing of what he has done for us
[1:06:54] that he's put this yearning, put a
[1:06:56] desire, put a longing, put a action in
[1:06:59] us that we could step out and something
[1:07:01] inside of us says I believe that word.
[1:07:04] But it takes more than something saying
[1:07:06] I believe that word. It takes another
[1:07:08] action to bring an action to cause us to
[1:07:10] step out and take a hold of that word
[1:07:12] and start walking with the word. You
[1:07:15] might stumble. You might stumble and
[1:07:17] fall. You might stumble and get mud on
[1:07:19] your face. You might do all of that. But
[1:07:21] there's something inside of us.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Can someone say, "Thank you, Lord."
[1:07:25] There's something inside of us that we
[1:07:27] get up and say, "I can't quit. I can't
[1:07:29] stop. I have to fulfill my calling, and
[1:07:32] I recognize my calling." Maybe the man
[1:07:35] or sister or brother down the pew might
[1:07:37] not see it as clearly as you, but God's
[1:07:40] given you that imprint to know this is
[1:07:44] what God called me to do. Amen. I'm
[1:07:47] telling you, my brother and sister, God
[1:07:49] is moving so strongly. And Amen. As fast
[1:07:52] as this has gone tonight, I wished I
[1:07:54] wouldn't have taken those other couple
[1:07:55] quotes out. Amen. But look at this, my
[1:07:58] brother and sister. How much more God
[1:08:02] has given to the believer
[1:08:04] when he said, "I made you in my image."
[1:08:08] That's right. Not just natural human
[1:08:12] creation, but he's talking about that
[1:08:14] soul he placed on the inside. That soul
[1:08:17] is a mirror of my soul. Amen. You are a
[1:08:21] mirror of who I am.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; And it's manifesting out in a bride.
[1:08:26] Look, I'm telling you, my brother and
[1:08:28] sister, in the day we live in,
[1:08:33] we have to be getting close to Sodom and
[1:08:37] Gomorrah again. We have to be
[1:08:42] all the things, wars, rumors of wars,
[1:08:45] all these things that's happening. My
[1:08:48] brother and sister,
[1:08:50] are we could we not check off the boxes?
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I don't think that's a wise
[1:08:55] thing to do because then we start to
[1:08:57] interpret what we're doing. But
[1:08:58] literally, I I think that we could start
[1:09:01] checking off boxes. There can't be too
[1:09:03] much scripture left to be fulfilled.
[1:09:06] Prophet of God said, "We should we
[1:09:10] should have been ready already." He says
[1:09:12] this, I believe it was 1964 or five, we
[1:09:15] should have been ready already.
[1:09:18] Look how patient God is.
[1:09:21] It's coming that not one of this
[1:09:24] creation could be lost.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; That each one must receive the word
[1:09:31] because it can't return void. And I
[1:09:33] believe it's not returning void. I
[1:09:35] believe there's a people on the earth
[1:09:36] today that are absorbing that word.
[1:09:39] They're living that word. That word is
[1:09:40] giving guidance to them. It is their
[1:09:43] very life.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight. Amen.
[1:09:48] You know, we we look at this and I don't
[1:09:51] want to dwell too much on Romans 1, but
[1:09:54] you look at that, my brother and sister,
[1:09:56] and that's the world we live in. But we
[1:09:58] don't want to focus on that scripture.
[1:09:59] We want to focus, Amen. that there is a
[1:10:02] bride. Revelations 19. Amen. There's a
[1:10:05] bride that is being called. She's being
[1:10:07] clothed. And she's not just being
[1:10:08] clothed, but she's being clothed in
[1:10:10] righteousness. And as we already touched
[1:10:12] on it just briefly right there, that
[1:10:14] righteousness is the very nature or
[1:10:17] manifestation of God coming and being
[1:10:20] manifested out. And he didn't keep it to
[1:10:22] himself, but he has sent it out into his
[1:10:25] bride that she is coming because she
[1:10:27] must be in his very image.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? Amen.
[1:10:35] Maybe you don't get up in the morning
[1:10:38] and say, "Praise God. I feel like I'm in
[1:10:40] his image."
[1:10:43] But as long as you can stop, look in the
[1:10:46] word, you realize he's telling us again
[1:10:49] and again and again and again. Could I
[1:10:52] keep going and again and again and again
[1:10:56] that we are his very image. Amen. and
[1:11:01] Sister Ruth, would you come?
[1:11:07] Hallelujah.
[1:11:20] Yeah. Beautiful. As I studied out this
[1:11:23] little thought, there was more. But I
[1:11:25] think the Lord knows exactly
[1:11:27] everything's on time. Amen.
[1:11:30] just how we realize
[1:11:34] how important it is to realize
[1:11:37] that God didn't just grab randomly,
[1:11:42] but he spoke confidently
[1:11:45] of who he said has my image right down
[1:11:50] into the spiritual
[1:11:54] mankind. in
[1:11:57] in
[1:12:00] ages, you might say, gone by, they
[1:12:03] thought that maybe men and women in
[1:12:06] Africa or Asia or something were somehow
[1:12:09] built differently.
[1:12:11] You know, they had all kinds of crazy
[1:12:12] ideas
[1:12:14] and then time proved that we are all the
[1:12:17] same. Maybe different color, different
[1:12:19] language, etc. Now you look at this my
[1:12:22] brother and sister. We don't want to
[1:12:24] fall in the opposite side of that trap
[1:12:27] and think spiritually all are built just
[1:12:30] like we are. We have to realize how
[1:12:33] special we are in Jesus Christ. Amen. We
[1:12:37] were built to receive the word. Amen.
[1:12:40] Where others can't receive the word,
[1:12:42] there'll be something they'll come. It
[1:12:44] will be a a a stumbling stone. But God
[1:12:47] put it in you and I to believe this
[1:12:50] word. Created us in that very image. The
[1:12:54] word he spoke. We have that same
[1:12:57] genotype in us. And he says it and we
[1:13:00] say amen.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; And you know that when the word is in us
[1:13:04] and we speak, if we could only hear it,
[1:13:07] God would be on the other side saying
[1:13:09] amen. See how this relationship is
[1:13:12] there? It's not a one-sided
[1:13:15] relationship, but the bride of Jesus
[1:13:17] Christ speaks the word just like Esther
[1:13:20] spoke. Amen.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; The king had respect to Esther.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; He heard her.
[1:13:28] And when she spoke, she spoke with
[1:13:30] wisdom. And this bride is speaking with
[1:13:33] wisdom. Amen. Hallelujah. We stand and
[1:13:37] just sing a song or two. Amen.
[1:13:44] I believe God. I think that's number one
[1:13:46] in the song book, page one.
[1:13:54] Ah,
[1:13:55] listen.
[1:13:57] Believe God.
[1:13:59] I believe God.
[1:14:01] Ask what you will and it shall be done.
[1:14:06] Trust and obey. believe it and say, "I
[1:14:12] believe. I believe God."
[1:14:15] And if you want
[1:14:18] salvation now
[1:14:20] and the Holy
[1:14:23] Ghost and power,
[1:14:26] trust and obey.
[1:14:28] Believe it and say, "I believe. I
[1:14:33] believe God." Let's sing it again. Oh, I
[1:14:36] believe God.
[1:14:38] I believe God.
[1:14:41] Ask what you will and it shall be done.
[1:14:46] Oh, trust and obey. I believe it and
[1:14:50] say, "I believe. I believe God."
[1:14:55] And if you want
[1:14:57] salvation now
[1:15:00] and the Holy
[1:15:03] Ghost and power,
[1:15:05] just trust and obey.
[1:15:08] Believe it and say, "I believe. I
[1:15:13] believe God."
[1:15:15] Amen. Can we fulfill that song? It says,
[1:15:17] "Believe it and say, Amen. I believe
[1:15:20] God." Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:15:23] Hallelujah.
[1:15:24] Hallelujah.
[1:15:26] Amen. 776.
[1:15:35] This song struck me
[1:15:38] in the sense that
[1:15:41] if we can hold on to and believe
[1:15:45] that the word has been born in the
[1:15:48] manger of our heart
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; without a doubt without even a flicker
[1:15:53] of any question
[1:15:56] how that will change our whole approach
[1:15:58] to life
[1:16:00] we can stand and say you know what seems
[1:16:03] like I'm in the middle of a battle attle
[1:16:05] right now, but he's been born in this
[1:16:08] manger.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan can't take that away.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know how much Satan just
[1:16:14] wanted? He anointed Herod. I'm sorry. I
[1:16:18] don't mean to go off in the bushes, but
[1:16:20] he anointed Herod such that history
[1:16:22] shows the blood ran in the street from
[1:16:24] the babies cuz he so wanted to do away
[1:16:28] with the Christ.
[1:16:31] Horrible time. I I mean I I just get
[1:16:33] shivers to think about that.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; And Satan today
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; in a different sense is killing right
[1:16:41] and left trying to make sure he can kill
[1:16:44] the bride of Jesus Christ. He wants to.
[1:16:46] It's a different kind of death. It's a
[1:16:48] spiritual death, but he's doing his
[1:16:50] best. He's just going cuz he doesn't
[1:16:52] know for sure who he is.
[1:16:55] But the word has been made real to us.
[1:16:58] And I say thank you, Lord.
[1:17:01] was a tiny simple stable
[1:17:07] all beaten
[1:17:10] and warm.
[1:17:14] Hardly
[1:17:15] a place
[1:17:18] for a king to be born.
[1:17:24] He didn't choose some place special
[1:17:29] to reveal his majesty.
[1:17:35] So I know if I'll give him control,
[1:17:41] he'll be born in me.
[1:17:48] Let your word
[1:17:51] be born
[1:17:54] in the manger of my heart.
[1:18:00] Let it live in me.
[1:18:04] Let it start.
[1:18:09] Live inside this house of clay
[1:18:15] and mold it every day.
[1:18:21] Let your word be born
[1:18:25] in the manger
[1:18:29] of my
[1:18:32] home.
[1:18:36] Well, outwardly
[1:18:39] I'm nothing.
[1:18:42] Not much to behold.
[1:18:48] unlikely
[1:18:50] the place
[1:18:52] for his word to unfold.
[1:18:58] But if I'll just yield this vessel
[1:19:03] and let him have his way
[1:19:09] from glory unto glory.
[1:19:14] He'll change me day by day.
[1:19:20] Let your word
[1:19:24] be born
[1:19:27] in the manger of my heart.
[1:19:33] Let it live in me.
[1:19:37] Let it start.
[1:19:43] Live inside this house of clay
[1:19:49] and mold it every day.
[1:19:54] Let your word be born
[1:19:58] in the manger
[1:20:02] of
[1:20:03] my heart.
[1:20:09] Amen.
[1:20:11] Amen. Praise God.
[1:20:14] Amen. I always preachers preaching. I
[1:20:18] always try to
[1:20:20] look for inspiration for songs
[1:20:23] for
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; more inspiration.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; I got I
[1:20:28] am a purchase product.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. I was thinking of the quote
[1:20:34] from expectation that I read about that
[1:20:37] that that woman said I'm remember in the
[1:20:40] Bible I'm a shun that Shounomite woman
[1:20:42] she knew who she was for that situation
[1:20:44] I am a purchased product who I am go
[1:20:47] Lord who I am
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; oh glorious victory
[1:21:02] victory.
[1:21:05] That day he set me free
[1:21:10] and he made my heart.
[1:21:15] His very throne.
[1:21:19] My life is no longer mine.
[1:21:24] I'm a prisoner of love divine.
[1:21:29] And now I live
[1:21:34] to praise his name.
[1:21:39] Who I am, Lord.
[1:21:44] Who I am.
[1:21:49] I can see now
[1:21:53] who I am.
[1:21:58] A part of my savior,
[1:22:02] a part of his word.
[1:22:07] It's a revelation
[1:22:12] of who I am.
[1:22:17] On Calvary,
[1:22:20] he died
[1:22:22] to redeem his lost bride.
[1:22:27] The king of kings
[1:22:32] became my savior.
[1:22:37] This is God's great mystery
[1:22:41] of love expressed to me
[1:22:46] that Christ and I
[1:22:51] might be made one.
[1:22:56] Who I am, Lord.
[1:23:01] Who I am.
[1:23:05] I can see now
[1:23:10] just who I am.
[1:23:14] Am a part of my savior,
[1:23:20] part of his word.
[1:23:24] It's a revelation
[1:23:29] of who I am.
[1:23:35] Amen.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; The other song that just came on my
[1:23:40] heart was uh He hideth my soul.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:52] A wonderful
[1:23:55] Savior
[1:23:57] is Jesus
[1:23:59] my Lord.
[1:24:02] A wonderful
[1:24:05] Savior
[1:24:07] to me.
[1:24:11] He hideth
[1:24:14] my soul
[1:24:16] in the cl
[1:24:19] of the rock
[1:24:21] where rivers
[1:24:24] of pleasure
[1:24:26] I seek.
[1:24:31] He hideth
[1:24:33] my soul
[1:24:36] in the cl
[1:24:38] of the rock
[1:24:41] that shadows
[1:24:43] a dry thirsty
[1:24:46] land.
[1:24:50] He hideth
[1:24:52] my life
[1:24:55] in the depths
[1:24:57] of his love.
[1:25:00] and covers
[1:25:02] me there with his hand
[1:25:10] and covers
[1:25:12] me there
[1:25:14] with his hand.
[1:25:19] A wonderful
[1:25:22] Savior
[1:25:24] is Jesus
[1:25:26] my Lord.
[1:25:29] He taketh my burden
[1:25:34] away.
[1:25:38] He holdeth me up and I shall not be
[1:25:46] moved.
[1:25:48] He giveth
[1:25:50] me strength as my day.
[1:25:57] He hideth
[1:26:00] my soul
[1:26:02] in the cl
[1:26:04] of the rock
[1:26:07] that shadows
[1:26:09] a dry thirsty
[1:26:12] land.
[1:26:16] He hideth
[1:26:18] my life
[1:26:21] in the depths
[1:26:23] of his love
[1:26:26] and covers
[1:26:28] me there with his hand.
[1:26:35] And covers me there with his hand.
[1:26:45] With numberless
[1:26:48] blessings
[1:26:49] each moment
[1:26:52] he crowns
[1:26:54] and filled with his fullness
[1:26:59] divine.
[1:27:04] I sing in my rapture.
[1:27:08] Oh, gloryy
[1:27:11] to God
[1:27:13] for such a redeemer
[1:27:18] as mine.
[1:27:22] He hideth
[1:27:24] my soul
[1:27:27] in the cl
[1:27:29] of the rock
[1:27:32] that shadows
[1:27:34] a dry thirsty
[1:27:37] land.
[1:27:41] He hideth
[1:27:43] my life
[1:27:46] in the depths of his love
[1:27:51] and covers
[1:27:53] me there with his hand.
[1:28:00] and covers
[1:28:02] me there with his hand.
[1:28:09] When clothed in his brightness,
[1:28:14] transported
[1:28:16] I rise
[1:28:18] to meet him in clouds of the sky.
[1:28:28] His perfect
[1:28:30] salvation,
[1:28:32] his wonderful
[1:28:35] love.
[1:28:37] I'll shout with the millions
[1:28:42] on high.
[1:28:46] He hideth
[1:28:49] my soul
[1:28:51] in the cl
[1:28:53] of the rock
[1:28:56] that shadows
[1:28:58] a dry thirsty
[1:29:01] land.
[1:29:05] He hideth
[1:29:07] my life
[1:29:09] in the depths
[1:29:12] of his love
[1:29:14] and covers me there with his hand.
[1:29:24] and covers
[1:29:26] me there
[1:29:28] with his hand.
[1:29:33] Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:29:38] Amen. He's hidden us in his love. Amen.
[1:29:42] Glory to God. Amen. God bless each one
[1:29:45] of you. Be with you throughout the rest
[1:29:47] of the week.
[1:29:49] You are dismissed.
