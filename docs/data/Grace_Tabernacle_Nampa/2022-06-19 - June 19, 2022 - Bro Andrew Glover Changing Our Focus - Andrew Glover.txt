have you back amen you know um i just seeing our sisters sing that song and uh kind of reminded me sister kerry she's apologetic this morning because i'm sorry it was so late but she's sending me a sent me a picture last night of um you know it's i don't know how you say this it's nostalgic and you see saints while we're pressing forward to a victory a victory in love divine is how the prophet of god put it let's not fail to live life while we're going let's not get up every day saying well tomorrow let's live the life today and sister kerry sent a picture last night of mason and gideon their baptism in the boise river a few years ago and they're just these little kids they're just these little little kids and i'm thinking where'd the time go and time has changed because now now this manhood that's coming upon them has come and you know they've got to you know grab the pastor and lift him off the ground to let him know that they can do it they've got to shake his hand until his knuckles crack just so he'll know that they're coming and i don't mind that because it's a stage of life and i'm enjoying the fact saints that they're young men they want to serve the lord and they have life in them and it's beautiful and i was just thinking about that as our little sisters were singing this song sister vika plays the piano so beautifully i don't know if one of these days she realizes that she'll be up front here and i hope she's prepared for that and i hope you don't mind this little nostalgic moment but little heidi yes that's how i see her as little hiding watching her crawl for the first time in my living room watching her ride a bicycle for the first time in our drive i thank the lord amen for his power amen his holding power and let it not just be today but lord let this holding power be upon our young people our middle aged are old to the coming of the lord but let's not fail to live it amen this victorious life includes enjoying this life as it were because we have a special place in the body of the family of christ and anyway i hope you don't mind my little nostalgic moment vanessa come here we are going to have a baptism today after this service this beautiful little girl who's very special to me i've got her in trouble with her mom many times and i apologize for that but she's been after mom and dad for quite a while a heart's desire wants to be baptized and i tell you it stirs my heart if you want to call this another nostalgic moment but it stirs my heart that god is as brother as our brother last night just said we're not praising god because we think it's going to happen but we're praising god because we're seeing it happen and right here is a living proof amen that god is still calling children still calling young people still calling in the day that we live in a dark wicked world god is still calling and there is a people according to the word that will respond amen so today after the service downstairs we get to baptize this beautiful young lady and i look forward to that amen god bless you hallelujah hallelujah well i feel anointed enough to preach to you but it's not my job today so what i want to do is i want each one of us if you had just take a moment now let's lift our hands and let's invite the lord in our presence today and let's give now brother our brother expressed to us last night how we have to give ourselves to christ and we can give it but still really not make him a hundred percent welcome we say lord i'm yours but let's make him a hundred percent welcome in this church this morning and let's just lift a hand to the lord and say lord we invite you heavenly father lord we just call upon you this morning lord we just invite you into our presence father into these walls lord just because we're inside a message [Music] when you come lord when you come in our midst lord when we come into your presence father our lives are changed forever lord i ask you this morning change some lives this morning lord let the word come with such power and authority lord today that father little things animosities and bitternesses lord resentments whatever it might be hurts lord let them just be washed away in your presence today father and lord we know there is a fountain open in the house of david and lord we are coming now into that fountain to be washed by the water of the word this morning and we ask father that your holy spirit now move in the aisles of this building lord in the idols of our hearts father that we might be open to receive you and give praise lord let us be quick father to give praise and glory and honor to you this morning lord this is my heart's cry lord this is our prayer this morning lord that you would have preeminence in this building in this service today in these lives father that you might receive all glory and honor and lord that our lives might be changed forever lord that we would just be drawn into your presence father that we might live in heavenly places father we thank you for this opportunity for this day in the name of jesus christ amen amen brother andrew comes i sing thy course again preach the word [Music] i just learned it this

what we've come here to do a man is to receive from his word amen amen it's the word that will defeat the devil anywhere anytime any place under any conditions amen i'm thankful to be identified in the word of the living god this morning and we want to say god bless you today we greet you in the name of the lord we sure counted an honor and privilege to be here with you all and my sure enjoyed that song service this morning just hearing the songs of zion being sung and the words of exhortation being given amen just to create an atmosphere for the word to come and have preeminence amen and we sure sure appreciate you this morning and just before we read the word if you have your bibles today we'll invite you to the book of luke the 21st chapter the the 25th verse that's a lot better luke 21 uh very very familiar reading to the believers this morning we probably could read these verses we're going to look at by heart but i just have a few things here on my heart this morning the lord's been dealing with me on for a few days and i was telling brother paul last night after service he was closing in the song last night and he made a statement about your eyes being turned from you to god and that's actually the direction i was looking this morning so i told him i said well that was just a confirmation amen and we we sure want to say we appreciate brother paul and his friendship and the confidence to come and i know the day and hour we're living in the the times and seasons it's a it's a real thing for a pastor to open this pulpit to minister this day and time i hate to say it this way but it's almost got to where you don't know what guys are going to say sometimes but i sure i appreciate the confidence and the invitation to come and i pray we can say something to be a blessing to you and a strength amen it's an honor brother paul to be able to come and put our shoulder to the wheel and the vision here and what you're doing for the message and for the people of god and we just we sure appreciate you this morning and amen just before we read the word let's just borrow our hearts together for a word of prayer and let's just ask the lord to come in the spirit of revelation and understanding this morning heavenly father as we gather here today lord we are well aware that we're not here by ourselves but lord you have sent angels into this generation you've sent ministering spirits into this building this morning lord we have been taught by a prophet of god that when we arrived here lord we did not walk to our seat by ourselves but there was an angel that lord accompanist and set us where you would have this lord to sit this morning and father it just opens our eyes to realize oh god that lord this is not man's doing this is your doing and lord it is marvelous in our sight for lord no man can orchestrate lord things the way they've been orchestrated outside of your grace now father this morning as we gather here on this beautiful lord's sunday morning resurrection sunday that you've given us father we are well aware that the world recognizes your resurrection one day out of the year but lord as your prophet said to the believer lord we recognize it every day for lord it is by your resurrection that we persevere it is by your resurrection that we have strength and grace to keep pressing forward lord to know that our god is not dead but he is alive and well and lord our hearts are full of joy this morning to see what you're doing in this assembly lord and i pray a special blessing o god upon our brother paul upon his family lord upon this church oh god i pray that your grace and mercy lord would continue to follow them and would continue to cover them oh god lord may you give them many souls for their labor lord many lord many rewards for their struggles oh god now lord as we look into your word we have been taught that anyone with physical strength can open this book but oh god it will take you to make it real now lord may you come in the spirit of revelation bring liberty and understanding forgive us of our failures oh god in our short comings we pray and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believer says amen and amen the book of luke the 21st chapter i want to look in the 25th verse we also want to say god bless you to all you fathers happy father's day today yes sir amen we want to look here in luke 21 verse 25 jesus here speaking says there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring men's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken the powers of heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory now the bible is speaking of the signs upon the earth it's speaking of men's hearts failing for fear and then it says then they shall see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory now notice what the 28th verse says and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your redemption draweth nigh when these things begin to come to pass then look up can i sit this way in other words change your focus lift up your heads your redemption is drawing nine i also want to look in the book of romans the eighth chapter the book of romans the eighth chapter i know uh this may seem like two uh exact opposite readings but by the help of the lord this morning we can hopefully bring these together that will help you in some way in the book of romans the 8th chapter and the 17th verse the bible here paul speaking he says in romans 8 and verse 17 he said if children then we're heirs and heirs of god and join heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him notice that word suffer if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us he says i reckon that the sufferings of this present time i want you to notice here in these two verses when you see the word suffering you'll find the word glory right behind the word suffering i reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us amen we ask the lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this morning from those passages of scripture for just a few moments if the lord would help me today i want to minister to you by the help of the lord on this thought and if i would title this today i want to speak to you on changing our focus changing our focus i i was recently hearing the prophet of god in the message the resurrection of jesus 1956 and he said something that really just jumped out and got me he said now tomorrow night the lord willing or one night before i leave i would like to speak on the infallibility of the word of god he said and if people can ever get placed and their faith centered not upon present situations but upon what god has said about it now brother branham separates that he said not upon present situations but upon what god has said about it he said if you can remember that no matter what comes or goes or how impossible that it seems to be he said god's word will take its place every time see in the face of every difficulty he said nothing and he repeats himself nothing can take its place he said it has preeminence amen it has preeminence he said because it's none other than god himself in the spoken word and it has to come to pass he meant the prophet of god is showing us that the word has preeminence and it has to come to pass in the message what is the holy ghost he said it doesn't make any difference what anything says he meant the word of god has preeminence in my heart amen it doesn't make any difference what anything else says the word of god has preeminence in my heart that's right and i want what god's got for me if there's anything more open heaven lord cause my heart is open for it amen if there's anything more for me to receive then lord open my heart and open heaven because i want to receive it in the message the token he says i believe that we're now at the time amen that the word should have preeminence i believe we're now at the time that the word should have preeminence i believe the time has come he meant to lay aside our creeds and our faults amen and come back to the word then a prophet of god is inviting the church he meant by divine vision a mentor look at things he meant not the way the world looks at things he meant but to look at things the way that god looks at things in the message victory day he said god invites man to look but man wants to show himself he said man wants to look at what god is trying to show him on the basis of his own idea about it see but god is trying to show man something amen but the man wants to accept it the way he looks at it amen so you can look at something but if you're looking at it amen the way the world looks at it then you're not looking at it the way god looks at it and you will not accept it the way a believer ought to accept it now amen there's many there's many things that we could go through in the message this morning amen of world events or modern events or end time events and we could see amen the way the world looks at it is a totally different view than the way the bride looks at it amen but here's the here's the thing amen is that we as christians have to remember amen that we are in the world but we are not of the world right so we so so we're in this world but what our battle is he meant is to not let the world's influence become the influence of the believer amen like i'll show you this example like right now there's a there's a battle going on between this uh between the country of ukraine and the country of russia right amen and i'll tell you this amen it is a devil that is motivating that it is a spirit at work that is out to kill and destroy amen but we as believers these things did not catch us unaware a bit but we already knew about it because god sent a prophet who would tell us what's going to happen now amen i said like this amen if you're not careful amen every time that russia says something about a bomb amen we'll get to looking at it and if we look at it the way the world looks at it amen we'll be buying bomb shelters and we'll be buying we'll be buying sellers and we'll be we'll be getting all kinds of doomsday preparation amen you know why because we're looking at things the present situation the way the world looks at it but if we look at it the way god looked at it amen we'll look at it the way a prophet said he said before one bomb ever hits this nation he said the bride will be seated at the merit supper of the lamb amen i'll sit you like this friends you've got to get your eyes he meant off of the things the way the world looks at it amen and start focusing on the vindicated word amen that has come in this generation to lead us he meant from the confusion of creeds from the confusion of dogmas into the beautiful revelation of the living god now amen i'll sit you like this in order for the word to have preeminence he meant in the church amen there's got to be a cleansing and there's got to be a purging now you know the problem god said in that last series on the seven seals he said finding in the sixth seal that there is a great interruption in nature the moon the stars the earth belches forth the church is purged amen israel is purged and everything is purged amen under the sixth seal so that the millennium can start in there has to be somebody said there has to be there has to be a cleansing first he said and that's what the church today what i want to point to you what we need is a cleansing he said before anything can begin from god he meant we've got to have a purging and when we when we look and see things that is now under the present conditions existing the way they are then we can see that we've got to have something happen before god can continue his program and to purge him amen i'll sit like this something to happen is a change of focus now do you realize when israel returned to the homeland amen the father god said they came back and he said in a little film they made they asked him on this question said are you returning amen to the homeland to die amen look at the way the world was looking at the situation the world was looking at the situation and saying israel is coming back in the homeland but they're coming back to die amen but a prophet come along and said but there was some there who looked back at those reporters and said no we have come here amen to see the messiah and when you see israel the tree putting forth its buds it's a great sign that the time is at hand when israel becomes a nation and she's a nation today we see things happen in the world amen just as blind as it was in the days of noah amen but to we who look for christ amen to we who look for christ and then the second time he meant it is an enzyme that he is soon coming we see something is fixing to happen it depends on what we're looking at amen if you if you're looking for trouble you're going to see it if you're looking for a fault you're going to find them if you're looking for failures they're going to be there amen if you're looking for something to criticize there's going to be plenty to criticize hey but if you're looking for jesus christ the second time he will send a message which will be an enzyme that'll change our focus oh i say it like this god has promised to lift up an enzyme amen god has promised to lift up an inside do you realize that an inside according to isaiah 5 26 he said amen he will lift up an insight to the nations from afar and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth and behold they shall come amen with speed swiftly the problem of god said an inside it's something that's in commemoration it is lifted up something to people to look at it's something that is placed before you do you realize there is a sign then there is an ensign amen there is signs in the sun there is signs in the moon there is distress between nations with perplexity and then the sea amen the waves are roaring amen men's hearts are failing them for fear those are all signs amen but god promised when you see those signs i will send an end sign hey bendy get your eyes off of the signs and get your eyes back on the vindicated word amen we got to change our focus somebody say that with me lord change my focus we got to change our focus from the sign amen to the inside if you look at the sign you'll be a nervous wreck if you look at the sign you won't have joy you won't be able to make it to church you won't be able to worship god but if you get your eyes off the side and you look away to jesus and then you will see him in the power and the glory and the beauty of his resurrection you will see him as the mighty god you see him as the everlasting father you will see him as the great conquer my we got to change our focus that word that word focus is a beautiful word to me it is the interest or activity amen the center of interest or activity it is an act of consecrating interest or activity on something it is the focal point amen of a person or their eyes amen adapt to the prevailing level of light somebody say that with me prevailing level of light amen focus is for your eyes to adapt to the prevailing level of light and become able to see clearly it means to cause one's eyes to focus it means to pay particular attention to amen it means to concentrate amen so here you find amen that the word focus means a prevailing level of light do you realize it meant that there's many kinds of light amen there's natural light there's artificial light there's spiritual light there's king light there's messiah life there's denominational lie there's all kinds of light but according to isaiah 42 verse 6 he said i the lord have called the unrighteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and will give thee a covenant for i give thee for a covenant of the people amen for a light amen a light of the gentiles amen according to matthew 4 16 the people which set in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death amen light is sprung up the power of god said the sun is the king of all lights on the earth the sun is the king of all lights on this earth in the natural lights no matter how much artificial light we have how many great electric rays we can produce amen when that sun rises all the rest of them dim out when the sun rises all the rest of them dim out amen when the same thing it is with the word of god when the word of god rises all superstitions denominational fanaticism and things spread away and it shows exactly what it is he said see god in the beginning said let there be light amen then light only comes the true light the king light amen comes by the word of god do you realize when light appears that light does not change what it's shining upon it only reveals what it's shining upon amen like it like the prophet god said superstitious mountain he said there was no way to be able to see everything he said with that flashlight he said but when the sun began to break over the horizon and the sun began to shine upon superstitious mountain he said it was exactly what it's called it was superstition he said there was nothing to what they were saying about it and i'll say it to you like this if you're looking at this message through the flashlight of denomination you will never see amen the power of this message if you were looking at this message through the superstitious eyes of some denomination you will never see it as rapture and faith but if you can look at this message amen through the son of god and then you will see it is the power of god under salvation you will see it's not a bunch your quotes it's not a bunch of pictures it's not a bunch of man's ideas it is the power of god to change a human heart it's the light of god he said god separated the light from the darkness in the beginning amen and the word of god made manifest always amen always separates the light from the darkness when the word is made manifest amen it is an evidence that the word is right when the word is separated from the light and the darkness now notice this the word of god separates it said people can rise up isms can rise up communism all things can rise up he said but his word is superior over all man's words amen over all anything his word is the light do you realize that light coming to you was coming to a seed that was already in you his light was coming to the seed for the age amen the problem of god said he needed light to bring forth that seed he meant to make that seed live because the seed was already there do you realize when martin luther amen recognized that the body of jesus was not that bread that catholicism had made it and the blood of jesus was not the wine that catholicism had made amen do you realize when martin luther recognized that he didn't receive a seed and then this deed was already laying there it took the power of god to quicken that seed came into a revelation that there's more to god and a bunch of catholicism and martin luther moved out and said these words the just shall live by faith do you realize that that was laying in the bible the whole time he was in that catholicism system but there was no prevailing light to come upon that scripture to open his eyes to the revelation of what god was really saying but the bible says in the evening time it shall be light then to think tonight friends amen that we as the pride of jesus christ we have not come here amen is a bunch of church members we have not come here as a bunch of fanatics we have come here as the pride of jesus christ my to think tonight amen to think this morning amen i'm knocking the monitor over but we'll preach anyhow amen to think to this morning that the light was already there it just had to quicken luther's eyes to see it do you realize when wesley looked at the word and said there's more to serving god amen than just a just shall live by faith and he found the message of sanctification the seed was already laying there it was just waiting for light to quicken the seed when pentecost come along and said there's more to serving god than just the just shall let my faith and the sanctified life but there is a promised baptism of the holy ghost that will return to the church amen the seed was already laying in a one-eyed man named william seymour who received the revelation that the holy ghost amen can fill a man's life and he can go into another dimension and see god for himself come on now amen let's not stop at three let's go all the way to four amen let's go to that fourth line let's go to that fourth stage amen there was a bride upon the earth who was knowing that there's more to serving god than just the just shall live by faith and a sanctified life he meant in a restoration of gifts but there was some word laying here and there was a seed laying in your heart to be quick and to the promise of the age you're living in my he said the only thing he needs is the manifestation of the light of god upon that scripture to make it live for that age he said the hour is at hand now that the message he said the light is shining the gospel light in its power of the resurrection of jesus christ manifesting himself that he's jesus christ the same yesterday day and forever he said see that he sings his promise for this day must happen in this day the things he's promised for this day they must happen in this day if the church won't accept it amen then god is able these stones to rise children unto abraham he will get his message over because he's always done it and he always will do it let me put every devil in hell on notice you will never defeat this message you will never defeat this bride you will never defeat the holy ghost you can better stop the son and you can stop a son or daughter of god amen from believing this message come on friends you're living witnesses i know my jacket's hanging off and i'm taking it off on purpose but preach with me your living witnesses ain't been that this message will get over the devil's tried to stop it he's tried to bind it he's trying to defeat it he's tried to corner the righteous seed of god said slew righteous abel in the beginning but everywhere every time any place under any condition amen the word has defeated the devil may i announce to you this morning the word is victorious and feelings are defeated the word is victorious and memories and reasons and conscious and imagination they're all defeated this morning by the superiority of the level of light in the word of almighty god oh i tell you why the devil hates you it's because you are the fulfillment of ephesians 1 18 that the eyes of your understanding have been enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and the riches of the glory of the inheritance and the saints do you realize this morning that the spirit amen moves with the word the spirit moves with the word people say well brother brother paul we just need the word and we don't need the spirit or they say we need the spirit and we don't need the word do you realize you cannot have the spirit without having the word and you cannot have the word without having the spirit they meant they go together like a hand in a glove the father god said then the main thing amen is to focus our lives to the word we must focus our lives to the word not what somebody else says amen but focus our lives to him and he is the word let me let me just go and knock another devil out while i'm here amen you have not been called to focus your life to what a man thinks about this message you have not been called to focus your preaching and your teaching to what a man thinks ought to be taught in this generation you have been called by the almighty god amen to focus your life to what a prophet said and if a prophet said it amen there ought to be some preachers with the courage of god they've been to say what a prophet said we're not called to focus our lives to what a man thinks about this message we are called to line our lives with the word he said then our life and the word becomes the same and the mind that was in christ was to fulfill the father's word which he was the word amen there you are then you and the word are focused in together and you become a living unit of god amen you become a living unit you become a living manifestation of the living god paul says in hebrews 9 24 he said that christ is not entered amen in the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true amen but in itself now to appear in the presence of god for us somebody said that word appear amen now to appear in the presence of god for us not yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with the blood of others verse 26 for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world amen but now once in the end of the world amen half he appeared amen there's that word again hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself as it is appointed unto man wants to die but after this the judgment verse 28 so christ was now offered wants to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he what appear amen the second time without sin unto salvation amen three times paul uses one word amen appear the product of god said when jesus was on earth he declared himself to be the messiah john declared there was a messiah sign following him the old testament claimed that there would be a messianic time he proved the messiah signed to the people that he was the messiah he was a god prophet amen moses the one they had followed said the lord your god shall raise up a prophet like unto me we know that we're aware of that and amongst the jews and the samaritans he sold this time but of course he never amongst the gentiles because we were heathers in those days he said our people the gentiles the romans we wasn't looking for no messiah amen and messiah only appears to those who are looking for him messiah only appears to those who are looking for him amen those who wait for him he will appear the second time amen so it would be who that's denied to be waiting for him and watching for him that we do not miss him when he comes amen now we've added another word amen when he comes so he will appear and then he will come you say preacher there's no difference well a prophet said there was so i'm going to say what a prophet said because i've been called to say what he said he said there is a difference in his appearing and his coming amen is this okay there's a difference in his appearing in his coming in second timothy 4 8 his four thirds laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but to also to them that shall that love his appearing unto all them that love his appearing first peter 1 7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than that of gold that perished that would be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ the part of god said not believes his appearing amen but loves his appearing amen such a joy to know he's coming amen not to those that believe he is appearing but to those that love his appearing that love will produce a joy amen to know that he's coming come on church we are a strange people this morning that we start preaching on the rapture and the church don't get quiet we start preaching on the second coming of the lord and the church don't quit preaching they don't quit saying amen you know why because you've seen his appearance and by seeing his appearance it is quick and something inside of you and you're looking for it's coming hallelujah i'm not a crazy man i have seen the appearing of the lord in the generation i'm living in and by seeing his appearing it has put a hunger in me amen for his coming amen the appearance of the lord amen comes before the coming of the lord the appearing of the lord is the holy spirit himself in the church and then bringing the church to perfection by a prophetic message come on amen a prophetic message has come to the church listen you're not just citizens of idaho you're not just citizens of napa or boise or somewhere amen you are citizens of a heavenly kingdom you are the part of jesus christ you are the you are the messiah ants that have been prophesied let me tell you this you know why you can't be stopped it's because you're a prophetic class of people and prophecy oh god hallelujah amen you know why you cannot fail it's because prophecy cannot fail for prophecy to fail means god has failed amen but my god has never failed he's not failing this morning and he will never fail he is the unfailing god come on church you're a prophetic class of people the devil can throw everything he wants at you and yet you'll rise again he can scandalize your name and you'll rise again you can get sick in your body and you'll still say god is a healer because you're a prophetic class of people there's a force of prophecy behind your life the prophet said there's a great big difference in the sign of jesus appearing and then jesus coming there's two different words two different things the appearing of the lord and the coming of the lord now can i say what a prophet said the appearing of the lord is now we're looking for his appearing he's already appeared he's here now preacher you've got to be careful no i don't have to be careful because i've not aligned myself with what some man called i've aligned myself with what a prophet said and he said my ministry is different from the evangelists it is different from the pastor my ministry is to declare him he is here come on friends amen he's not just coming amen he's here this morning listen friends amen the appearing of the lord is in his people his spirit working among them and proving that it's him with him getting them ready for the rapture for the coming of the lord to catch away his bride the appearing and the coming the thing we have to do is if we can believe it then be concerned about it because first we've got to be convinced that it is god amen then when we're convinced we are concerned we appeared amen i'm not going to read you all these quotes but there's many there amen the appearing of the lord is now he's appearing amongst his people we see him in his same works the appearing his holy spirit but his coming will be in a physical being amen it'll be to catch the church up amen it has to be his ministry reproducing itself again in his church amen for the rapture then his appearing is luke 17 30. his appearing is revelation 10. his appearance is malachi 4. it's appearing as john 14. is appearing as mark 11. his appearance matthew 18 are you hearing me amen his appearing is a prophetic message which the holy ghost had been bound by denominational rivers for 2 000 years but was to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy ghost back in the church again who is it healing the sick it's the holy ghost who is it raising the dead it's the holy ghost are you hearing me amen his personal presence has appeared in this generation let me say this he did not appear to give us something to argue about he did not appear to give us something to fuss about he said he only if we could only realize that he is appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose somebody say one purpose for one purpose and that is to release our desires that we have in him to us he is appearing here to bless us he is appearing here to heal us he is appearing here he meant to release our desires that we have in him in us oh god come on church el santiai has returned to the church amen the breasted god has returned to the church then you have got a right to latch onto the breast of el shaddai the old testament and the new testament and to draw the very strength of el shaddai into your body by recognizing this is elohim this is el shaddai this is the mighty god returning to the church to release our desires in him and put him into us my to think we've got to recognize his presence how can you recognize his presence is when the promised word for the age is made manifest not the promised word for moses age or any other age the promised word for this age when you recognize the promised word for this age you have recognized the presence of the lord for where his word is is where his presence is and where his presence is there will be liberty there will be joy there will be revelation come on there will be anointing there will be power there will be signs and wonder where the presence of god is the impossibilities will become possible where the presence of god is and then death will become life where the presence of god is blind eyes will be open come on church it's not a man it's the lord it's the appearance or let me say it like this if you see his appearing it'll change your focus and you'll be looking for his coming come on now people say well he appeared in 1963 so we're not looking for his coming that tells me brother david they didn't see his appearing because the prophet said if you see his appearing it'll produce a love that'll cause you to look for his coming if you're not looking for the second coming of the lord jesus christ amen then you've not seen his appearance but if you're looking for the second coming of the lord jesus christ it's because you have seen his appearing now come on friends the prophet of god taught it and three kinds of believers he said every believer true believer believes in the physical corporal return of the lord jesus christ amen 1963 did not dismiss amen the coming of the lord it was the personal appearance oh god i'm trying to behave myself this morning it was his presence coming to the church amen then when you see that the prophet of god said i want to take one word this morning and i want to call it l double okay look he said see look when you hear the word it's usually trump somebody trying to get you to see what they're looking at he said everybody is looking for something they're looking for something to happen everything is looking he said the ford company is looking to make a better forward the chevrolet company looking to make a better chevy phoenix looking to make a bigger city a nation looking for more territory the church amen is looking for more members aren't you thankful that the prophet of god separated you in the first seal and said i'm no longer going to call you church i'm going to call you bride when he separated you he was changing your focus the focus of the church was more members a million more and 44 bigger programs bigger buildings bigger schools more hospitals but a prophet said that's not the focus of this bride amen the bride is looking for the coming of her lord because she has seen his appearing oh god she is looking for his coming because she has seen his appearance my this morning to think the prophet god said we're all looking he said but it depends on what the voice is trying to tell you to look for some of us are saying look for this amen but the voice i'm trying to say to you this morning is like the writer of this epistle which we believe to be paul the book of hebrews he said see in order to do that you've got to look for the coming of jesus christ the second time in order to do that you got to see something you got to see something before you can tell somebody else to look at what you are seeing amen amen you got to see something in order to tell somebody look come on now if you say look i mean if there's nothing there then you're playing a trick on them come on brother brother jason we've all played that game we hey look over there so you look over there and the only reason they're telling you that is to distract you because they don't want you to see something come on amen amen if if we were going to bring a surprise person in here this morning to surprise you we'd say look over there look look over here until the person could come in the room amen see they're trying to distract you but let me say this a prophet of god was not tricking the church when he said these words look away to jesus he had spent 20 years telling you how you're going to see him the four ways he appears can we see jesus search we see jesus come on looking for jesus looking for him we had heard sermons for years of how to see him and then in 1963 a prophet caps his year off and says look away to jesus in other words he's saying what you've been looking for is not coming it is here what you've been looking for is upon the earth my he said he was trying to get the people to look at remember was trying to get the people to look at what he was seeing what am i trying to do i'm trying to get you to see where you're at amen just as sure as god kept his word to peter james and john as sure as he kept his word to john the beloved the revelator is as sure as he kept the promise through the church ages is that sure he's promised in this last day he would send down a ladder rain that would bring the same spirit upon the earth that was in him the light shall come in the evening time and show the same power the same signs everything he did in his day he would do again in this open door in the last day here it is we got it right with us now here it is we got it right with us now the jesus christ the holy spirit the same yesterday today and forever now i want you to catch his words it's preaching to you he didn't say i'm preaching to you he said it's preaching to you he said it's teaching you it's trying to get you to see what is right and wrong brother david who is that it he's talking about he said it's the holy spirit himself among church justification made way for sanctification and sanctification made way for the baptism of the holy ghost but the baptism of the holy ghost made way for the person himself jesus christ to step in the church it's the holy spirit speaking through human lips operating among human beings trying to show mercy and grace i am not the messiah i am no christ brother says but he is here and that's what i'm trying to get you to see he is here and he's keeping his word he is here and he's keeping his word amen i didn't come here just to be seen he says i didn't come here because there was no other place to go i come here because i felt to come here i felt that the ministry that the lord had given me amen must be sowed among the people here and i'm trying to get you to see what god really is now he turned the corner brother paul and he said i'm not here trying to get you to see what god was or what god will be i'm trying to get you to see what god is now he is his promised word god is his promised word he always is the word and he identifies himself by the characteristic that he has promised then i say amen let the person of the holy spirit come in the church which the prophet said that's god's range finder amen amen the holy spirit is god's range finder which is a connector what does a rangefinder do it connects you and tells you how close you are to something it connects you and tells you amen he's not a million miles away he's not three feet from where i'm standing are you hearing me are you hearing me i'm in the world come on i'm i'm feeling some liberty now they've been there with three seeds sown in the last days according to spoken word it's the original seed three seeds sown three messengers sowing three different seeds billy graham sowed a denominational seed oral robert sowed a pentecostal seed william branham the seventh age messenger amen so the original word seed again in the bride by the word okay so so then you've got you've got three messengers trying to identify the same god you got billy graham saying he's god and he's somewhere i know he's god he's god up there he's god he's god in heaven he's god on his throne amen you've got oral roberts who's under a pentecostal anointing he's saying oh i feel god is somewhere he's somewhere in this building he's moving somewhere but then you've got william branham who's standing there not saying he's god in heaven or he's god somewhere he's saying he's god right here on the platform but god hallelujah the god that stood at the tenth door of abraham and sarah is not standing three feet from where i'm at right now whole church of the living god that god is not dead that god is here this morning he's in nampa idaho he's in grace tabernacle he's here by the baptism of the holy ghost my god is not dead my god is alive and he's got power he's got supreme power he's got the authority my god has been identified he's here now hallelujah he's here now what do you see church do you just see a building do you just see a preacher holding the microphone do you just hear some songs i see my lord see my bridegroom i see my king i see my father i see the god of gods the king of kings the lord of lords by the baptism of the holy ghost i have been connected to the person oh god he said god only god himself can take a hold of the camera of your eyes and let you see what god is not what god was not what god will be but what god is and what his purpose is come on young people you may never hear me preach again but i'm going to preach the truth to you this morning you've not been brought up on the earth just to be a young lady you're not here just to be a young man you've been brought up on this earth for an eternal purpose of the almighty god that is returned in this age to make real men and women out of you oh god if i can say it to any way open your eyes and see him let's see who god is let's see what his purpose is the protagonist is a group of believers a symbol today we want to fix our thoughts we want to fix our principles and things upon the coming of the lord come on what was elohim materializing for to change your focus on the coming of the lord what was el shaddai returning to the church for to reveal himself that you could receive strength from the nourishment of el shaddai looking for christ who shall appear somebody say appear the second time without sending the salvation to those that believe and are looking for him then god here by the writer is inviting us to view this and to look at it therefore it's the word that we look to for it is the expression of what god is what a hope it gives us that god has not left us without a true witness in the days of confusion come on now it's a day of confusion in the days of confusion that we live in today we are certainly privileged people if we'll just look to the true witness that we have the word the true witness is the word the word see because that's god's full revelation of jesus christ the true witness of the church is the word which is god's full revelation of jesus christ nothing can be added to it or taken away from it it's because it is the revelation of jesus christ in the day of confusion it's a day of confusion because people are looking to signs rather than the ensign in luke 21 25 there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth the stress of nations with perplexity amen the sea and the waves roaring amen men's hearts fading them for fear now notice this for looking after those things which are coming on the earth so they're here on the earth and their eyes for the paul is fixed upon the sun upon the moon come on now amen we went through it a few years ago everybody had their own interpretation of what the blood moons was they was all interpreting what the blood moons was and most of them missed it and instead of coming back and saying it was wrong and then they just went on as if everything was okay but that's what oh god that's why i don't get excited by eschatology teachers that's why i don't get excited when somebody says oh i've got a revelation on the blood moons because i know that that revelation could fail but when i heard a prophet of god say something i've tied my life to it it's an absolute for my ministry it's an absolute for my family come on it's an absolute to the bride of jesus christ now their hearts are going to be failing for fear for looking after those things which are coming upon the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken notice this the prophecy wherever you look at with your eyes and you see now our nation is shaken and trembling war clouds are flying everywhere every nation under distress and perplexed times every sign that jesus said would happen is happening there would be signs in the heaven above in the earth below great things will be taking place like flying saucers and things but he commanded his church come on but he the mighty god elohim el shaddai the god that not just was not the god that will be but the god which he has commanded his church to lift up their heads in that day and look up for the unseen christ will be appearing soon come on church you know why you can't stay depressed is you're under a command do you know why you can't stay discouraged if you're under a command do you know why that negativity amen cannot keep you earthbound is because you're under a command you say preacher i'm under a command first thessalonians 4 and the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout that word shout means an order or a command it is specifically a stimulating cry amen it is to soldiers by a commander with a loud summons the problem of god said in the rapture a shout what is the sound it's the message going forth it's the living bread of life bringing forth the bride come on church we're not a bunch of chickens we're eagles here this morning we're not feeding up on barnyard food we're feeding up on living bread what is the bread it's the revelation of jesus christ in the age you're living here now i gotta preach can i i gotta preach this to you when you see these things happening lift up your heads your redemption draws now do you realize what had to happen if something had to happen that would cause you to look away the bible said then shall they see i don't know about you but i put myself there put my name there then andrew glover shall see amen the coming of the son of man in a cloud with power and great glory you know what revelation 1 7 says it says behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall well because of him listen every eye shall see him but not ever i shall know who he is come on church every eye shall see him but every eye is not going to see what he's doing when he appears oh god what is it brother paul it's a vision of the second coming of christ that begins with an appearing now brother david either this message is the truth or not if luke 21 25 21 25 is going to be fulfilled revelation 1 7 is going to be fulfilled then let's see where it was fulfilled amen notice this and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven amen clothed with a cloud revelation 10 1 another mighty angel who is the mighty angel it's christ it's the angel of the covenant it's the god of abraham isaac and jacob it's the god of the earth it's the god of heaven i saw him come down brother paul how did he come down he came down clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was it were the sun and his feet is pillars of fire come on now amen we're not about we're not about your idiots here this morning we're christians and we know the word is true and we know that god fulfills his word he came down brother paul he came down the mighty angel came down in this generation and you know what all i saw him all kinds of eyes saw him you know what they done they took a picture of him they took a picture here come on now i'm gonna just go ahead and say it somebody told me today they said preacher you're making too much of that picture you're making more out of it than what it really is i said no you're letting the devil rob you of what it really is that's not a picture that's not just something to hang on the wall amen that's a reality that's luke 21 25 that's revelation 1 7 that's revelation 10 1. let me say it like a prophet this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears he is not just coming he has appeared in the glory of his resurrection oh god 1963 are you hearing me 1963 a mysterious cloud appears over sunset mountain the prophet said we went up there big observatories from way down in california plumbing and mexico over tucson everywhere taking the picture of it it was a mysterious sight fred sothman amen brother gene norman standing right there when they're present up there they took the picture but still they don't know what it's about come on they took the picture and they still don't know what it's about here's some time ago everybody's saying lookie here this looks like this and then angels wings how they're folded in there now you know what he's doing when he says here some time ago in that quote this is spiritual food and new season 1965 when he says here some time ago he's referring back to it is the rising of the sun when he comes to jeffersonville and says now they've got the picture amen brother a good friend of mine brother ed hunter he was actually there when when when brother brown preached that sermon it is the rise of the son i believe brother eddie fitzgerald was there as well you hear brother i'm on the tape say come back here notice this they're there and they're out in the parking lot and brother ed hunter told me he said brother andrew he said we all had the picture we had in our hands he said he was out there on the pulpit on the parking lot we was turning every which way we were seeing angels we were seeing clowns and he said we were seeing all kinds of things he said so we went in there and he said brother got up and he said these words he said now what now i'm going back to spiritual food and due season he said one day turning it to the right he said he held the picture up and he turned it to the right and he said there was jesus christ just as perfect as hoffman ever brought him oh god are you hearing me he's getting ready to tell you look away to jesus but if he's going to tell you to look there's going to be something there to see when you look so he's he identifies what you're looking to is revelation 10 1 fulfilled luke 21 27 fulfilled one day turning to the right notice this it was standing there with a white wig on oh god with a white wig on looking back down towards the earth showing he is supreme authority the heavens declares it the bible declares it the message declares it all the same supreme authority with a white wig on do you see he said now some say just turn it sideways here it is it had been photographed to him he said they're looking at him from the wrong angle if you're going to see him you got to change your focus they were looking at it from the wrong angle he said but you got to look at it in the right angle and the only the lord god can reveal which is the right angle come on friends brother paul it was not william branham and the pulpit it was the mighty angel had come down into a man and was revealing who he was only the lord god can reveal who he is turn it to your right and look at it there he is just as perfect had it been a photograph up there listen brother brother brother david he says these next words he said and my house has never been without one of those picture fence brother paul my house has not been without one of those pictures since in the skies the very god i saw in this vision out here just a little boy by the schoolhouse he looked like that and here in the heavens 33 years later declares it's the truth the way he looks it's not some mystic something of somebody's idea we are not following a mystic something of somebody's idea come on church will you agree with me that the book of revelation is the book of symbols will you agree with me the book of revelation is the book of symbols from revelation 1 to revelation 22 is symbol after symbol after symbol after symbol do you realize that a symbol remains a symbol without a revelation without a revelation a symbol remains a symbol but when the revelation comes according to a prophet in the first seal the revelation comes he says it thundered when it was released in symbol form he said that how much more will it thunder when he reveals it in reality form come on church revelation 10 1 was a symbol form upon the mountain but he was god is coming quicker than i can get it out but he was not desiring to remain in symbol form his head was not looking up to the heavens he had already filled the highest office that could be filled he was god he was the mighty god so what is he doing he's looking down upon the earth i'm on church he's up high looking down if you're looking down you're looking down for a reason you know why because in 2022 there would be a group of people up on the earth there would be a group of people upon the earth who would have every reason to be looking down and they needed a reason to look up they needed something to look up to so the mighty age will come down and reveal himself in this generation to fulfill the words of jesus when these things begin to come to pass russia is hollering when nations are breaking when israel is in the homeland then come on little bride look up your redemption is drawing nigh hallelujah hallelujah we're not a bunch of fanatics we're not looking up in the sky like a bunch of idiots our lord is up there our lord is up there well preacher i don't see what you're looking at maybe he wasn't born to see it but there's a bride on the earth brother paul there's a bride in position the word of almighty god has changed her focus it was a symbol can i preach it to you it's got to be a reality to the symbol or it remains a symbol may i introduce you to the symbol this morning may i introduce you to the reality of the symbol there it is there it is in the back there it is on the front row there it is in a pastor there it is in a song leader there it is in a young lady it's no longer in symbol form you are the reality of the appearance of jesus christ in this dispensation he has come the son of man he come as son of god he will come as son of david in the millennium but between the son of god and the son of david according to luke 17 30 he will return as the son of man this day this scripture is fulfilled in nampa idaho [Music] oh somebody rejoice oh somebody giving praise somebody worshipping michael mighty bride he's the mighty god he's the everlasting father he's the appearance of our lord do you know what you're feeling right now do you feel that tug you feel that charge do you know what it is it's a redeemer drawing you it's the redeemer pulling that exactly right if there's a clown picture with a symbol there's going to be a reality you say preacher there ain't no power in the picture then pray tell me how come five boys laid in their bed every night for 18 years and looked at a picture on the wall and when they grew up they everyone went into the navy but tells the story he said five boys grew up and everyone one by one went into the navy he said that they they come down and did an investigation because nobody in their family had ever been an overcomer i mean had never went in the navy nobody in their family had ever been able to overcome sin i mean had never went into the navy the whole family tree was cursed and hear these come on friends and these five boys break the cycle of a thousand-year-old tradition in their family you know what happened brother paul they went in there and they began to investigate the boy's bedroom and in them boys bedroom brother was a picture of a ship that was sailing on a calm sea god have mercy what's the picture of a ship sitting on a calm sea he said then five boys laid there every night looked at that ship and rob said like this he said see it so impressed them boys it's so impressed them boys as they went to bed looking at this picture it was on their mind to sail that quiet soothing sea and as long the morning when they first arose the first thing they could look at was that making her way through the comm sea and it impressed the boys till each one become a sailor he said now if a picture of a ship will impress boys to become navy men sailors of the sea then what ought the picture of the lord jesus do you say what brother andrew i'm not hanging up that clown picture i don't really trust it i'm going to hang up hoffman's head of christ do you realize hoffman's head of christ is a painting come on it's a painting it's not even a it's not even a real picture taken in time it was a man's painting now i'm not discrediting hoffman's head of christ the prophet god said that's the closest thing i can describe he looks like he said but see amen what happened up there on the mountain what happened in sam houston coliseum it was not psychology because the camera will not take a picture of something that's not there oh god there was a literal physical being that was there was a literal physical being that had come into the church are you hearing me therefore the picture we have amen ought to be before our children come on he said see it ought to be bring up a child and the way it should go and when he's old he'll not depart from it i love how the prophet said this are we sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst are we sufficiently impressed with the revelation well let me say this whatever them boys got out of that picture come on now whatever them boys got out of that picture listen i'll resent that spirit this is not coming from a man it's not coming from a preacher it's coming from almighty god this stimulation the church this morning it's not coming because andrew glover's here it's because the mighty angel is here the everlasting father the angel of the covenant has returned to the church are you hearing me hey man let me say it to you like this whatever them boys got out of that picture and pressed them enough come on now do you realize brother they didn't just look at that picture for 18 years and wake up and go straight to become a navy man or a sailor put on a uniform get in the cockpit of a ship and sell the ship they had some training to go through come on you imagine the first day amen the first boy got down there oh god that first boy got down there and he went in there and the the drill sergeant said come in here boy you're gonna get a haircut he said yeah i've been needing one you know kind of get a little long on the sides so he went in there and sit down imagine that that drill sergeant said listen how do you want your hair cut he said well you know i think i'll just take a little bit off the sides here maybe line up the top you know just kind of edged up he said okay i got you he flipped the guard off turned the clippers on and buzz cut that boy down to a bald head do you realize that wasn't enough to turn him around come on that wasn't enough to turn him you imagine the next day he got up about five o'clock and they said let's go to the mess hall had breakfast and he went down there and he's thinking it's going to be eggs and biscuits and grits and bacon all kinds of good old you know butter and salt and he got down there it looked like dog food on the table but that wasn't enough to turn him around are you hearing me you realize six hours of pt or whatever you had to go through wasn't enough to turn whatever was in that picture impressed that boy to persevere regardless of the condition you know why because the suffering was not worthy to be compared with the glory which was going to be revealed in them boys lives are you hearing me church and i'll say it like this as a young man i have suffered for this message but i do not regret one suffering i do not regret one ridicule i do not regret one hard trial come on i don't regret one mile that i've cried my way home from a meeting because of things it was saying i have seen the glory of the lord and it has impressed me brother paul it is impressed me what are you saying preacher i'm saying young lady let this message impress you you don't know what your future holds i don't know what your future holds but the want who is in that picture is holding your future are you hearing me the one who is in that picture is holding your future he's got it all in control it may look like it's falling apart but remember he's still a waymaker he's still a miracle worker you just got to change your focus are you hearing me you got to change your focus remember what that word focus means it means to cause one's eyes to focus to cause one's eyes to focus it means to pay particular attention to to concentrate do you realize that the eyes are the gate to the soul the eyes are the gate to the soul and the soul is the real you the soul is the real you then whatever you let come through your eyes is what's getting to the real you come on whatever you let come through your eyes is what's getting to the soul which is the you you're a triune being the problem god said you're a triune being just like father son holy ghost right he said your body your spirit and your soul do you realize the problem god said there's three kinds of believers in every church three kinds of believers do you realize that three kinds of believers for a believer you say what do you talk about there's three kinds of believers in every believer do you realize what your body your flesh is your body your flesh is an unbeliever it'll never believe you know what your spirit is it's a make believer if everything's going good and there's no trouble in the church and everybody's getting along just fine amen your spirit is high and you can walk with angels come on come on when when you come out of the good meeting you know that spirit's real high amen you're too anointed to be disappointed you're too blessed to be stressed you're too highly favored you know all those terms we use amen we're walking in heavenly places amen but let monday morning roll around and that spirit goes from heavenly places into low places amen what gets you out of bed what brings you what brings you here on the wednesday night brother paul what causes you to preach when your body don't want to and your spirit's so low you can't even study you know what caused you to preach is there's a soul in there that has been impressed there's a soul in there that has been sealed it has been impressed by the appearing of the lord in this generation and that appearance sister jerry has changed your focus from the things that you're suffering to the glory that's going to come after the suffering's over oh god are you hearing me brother paul you suffered sister jerry you've suffered i'm going to church you all suffered but can i give you a word from my heart this morning you have seen the suffering grace tabernacle now stay in line you're going to see the glory you've seen the sufferings you've seen the hard times you've seen the disappointments you've seen the let downs now stay in your position you're going to see the glory you're going to see soul say you want to see young people on fire with a holy ghost come on i'm not a crazy man i'm preaching from a picture i've been impressed by it's supreme authority you say preacher how can you stand there and tell us that it's going to be okay because i'm preaching from supreme authority i'm not preaching from man's authority i'm preaching from supreme authority are you hearing me you got to change your focus come on friends you got to change your focus the bible says many of the afflictions of the righteous but the lord will deliver him out of them all anybody here afflicted anybody here ever been afflicted three or four of you man i need to take some water home what's in the water out here anybody ever been afflicted anybody ever suffered anybody had some hard days do you realize what the bible says the bible says many are the afflictions of the righteous the lord will deliver him out of them all brother brother paul not some of them not a few of them all of them the lord is on come on church it's in the first seal we've got a sworn affidavit with the mighty angel that he will deliver he will do what his word said he would do you say preacher why are you preaching about the word because i think it's time for the word to take preeminence in the church again i think it's time that dreams become what a prophet called them secondary i think it's time visions become what a prophet called secondary he said the word is the major the word is the preeminence the word is the preeminence the word is the liberty the word is the direction the word is the anointing the word is the power to destroy the yoke of the enemy come on church what are you saying is there anybody want to say with me give me the word give me the word give it to me true give it to me plain give it to me pure give me the word i don't want mama's home and act i don't want grandma's feelings and great grandpa's stories i want the word [Applause] well i might as well preach i'm here give me the word don't tell me what brother braham said about you and some little situation on a rock somewhere tell me what he said on tape listen they shoot me beat me cut me up and persecute me listen this is how strong i believe this message you can take a sword and cut my head off and let it roll down this carpet and as it's rolling it'll still be saying the message is absolutely the message is the absolute are you hearing me i will not back off of it i will not apologize for it it's the direction to this generation it's the word of truth it's the power of god this is the bride's revival you want revival you want a revival preach this message you want a move of god preach this message it's a spirit of intimidation it's a spirit of hierarchy that lifts himself up in a position and says well you know so-and-so is with brother branham and they've got little inside here and a little backwards story here and we're going to leave the church by that i'll tell you where you lead them you're leading the tribulation this message will lead you to glorification i'm on church somebody told me one time they said brother andrew i was talking to a brother and he looked at me and he said you know what brother problem with you is you just ain't too revelated he said what in your terms would tell you that i'm qualified for revelation he said well one time i was out with brother brandon hunting a long time ago long story i don't know if the man still alive or not but he said eyes out brother i'm hunting and he said brother branham called me buddy and he called me pal and he called me friend that young boy was told that story and it put a spirit upon that young man for years that he was not with brother branham and he was not called buddy or friend or power by the brown i said young man listen amen you might not been called buddy and you might not been called friend or power but you was called something greater he was called bride i would rather be called bride than i would be rather called free i'm on church because as the bride of jesus christ and under this message i am a friend to a prophet come on now do you realize under this messenger a friend to a prophet what was in his dream he was walking the trail brother paul and what reared its head the black mamba and he said you got power to mind and you got power to lose he said in the name of jesus christ i bind you and the mama was bound he said just to see if it worked he said i said i loose you and the thing come up and tried to bite me again he said and i bind you he said there was a man walking with me in the vision who had the same power he meant to bind and to loose the serpent do you realize where the power he meant to bind loose was coming from it was coming from walking with a prophet and he was not with that prophet he would not have the ability to bind the serpent but the strength the promise of god's asked a question can you interpret what it means to receive a prophet is to receive the prophet's reward he said it means to be the friend of a prophet come on church many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord will deliver him out of them all do you realize can i take a little liberty here do you realize what affliction means the bible definition of affliction means bad evil unpleasant and malignant now come on bad evil unpleasant and malignant go the doctor doctor said i found a tumor what's the first thing you ask is it malignant is it cancerous come on and the bible here saying many are the afflictions of the righteous brother paulie it dawned on me one day every affliction we go through has the potential to become cancerous i'm gonna back it up by the word the protagonist said a cancer in the nazarene would be a scavenger a buzzard and eat dead things he said a cancer comes from a bruise a bruised cell usually where it's come from the cell is bruised it's all mashed up and the cell is backslidden it's something happens in there that fails to get the blood function of it to it right the get the the function of the blood to it right i'll get it out in a minute and through there satan the author of death which god is the author of life satan the officer of death puts a demon in there called the devil a cancer he said the cancer comes from the word crab he said with legs and things that runs out and like other diseases are given medical terms he said then that little cancer comes in there and first it is a spirit the first thing for the jason of cancer is is a spirit he said see then it gets into a backslidden cell brother brother david why didn't that cancer spirit amen find a strong right all cell i'm preaching to you now why didn't that spirit find a real healthy cell that's that's pulsating with white blood cells why did it find a weak back sudden sale see or a bruise sale that's not operating right amen isn't it amazing a spirit comes in the church and it don't come to pasture a spirit comes in a church and it don't come to a strong cell a strong member that the blood is functioning through them it finds somebody that's already heard about something well we might as well preach we're here are you hearing me amen you you let a spirit come in a church that says the preacher is preaching too long or the song service is too loud or the music is too fast that spirit will not go to a strong cell member of the church it'll go to somebody else who's thinking the same thing that spirit's thinking and it'll connect itself come on it'll connect itself and then that sale will go to another cell and they'll say you know what i'm not thinking [Music] i got to thinking you know that music's a little too loud that song was a little too emotional you know i got to thinking brother paul's just he's just two two he's just too long for me i tell you what i got to thinking them pews are just not comfortable that sale is going to other sales he said oh i'd like to preach the gospel for five minutes that's what happens in the church when he gets someone failing to operate with the church someone failing and pulling off and getting indifferent that's a cancer in the church it's a devil in that person that's right he said that causes the whole church to be sick over it are you ready for this are you you want some prophetic advice you say preacher this ain't going on well hold on the devil will try so i'm going to equip you right now by the word how to defeat that devil when he rears his ugly head the best thing to do is have a spiritual operation preaching now the best thing to do is have a spiritual operation you say what is it he said first it's a spirit then it forms a teeny little cell of its own it forms a little teeny cell of its own so it pulls away from the body and says this is the direction we're going to go i could call the big words he said and no one knows it's happening come on church no one knows it the sale the spirit comes in it finds a bruce sail it attaches itself and then it begins to feed on other backslidden sails and no one knows it's happening until the spirit rears its head he said the little cell is born and it must be fed he said another cell breaks out and another cell breaks out and another cell breaks out and after a while cell on sale on sale and tumor cataract whatever it may be it grows bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger larger spreading out more sales the first thing you know it begins to sap so much blood he said to this young lady begins to feel sick come on you know what you know you come on now you know the spirit in the church it'll snap the joy out it'll sap the amen now listen i'm not a politician i'm a preacher so i'm not intimidated by spirits a spirit will snap the revival out of a church a spirit will snap the liberty out of a church a spirit will climb down the atmosphere come on now that's what the prophet of god said he said but here's what we need is a spiritual operation he said the best thing to do is have a spiritual operation for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword he said pierce and even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and a joint and admiral and is a discerner of the false and intense lord you know what a cancer hates to see is a knife you know what a cancer hates to see is a holy ghost filled preacher walk out of the back room of john the baptist anointed with the pillar of fire amen and a sword in his hand come on church to lay their axe to every root of every tree that doesn't bring forth amen you say preacher what are you talking about you all know brother ron spencer out here brother ron spencer god bless him a gallant soldier the cross right now battling stage four cancer i tell you one thing you ever get to feeling like you got problems and you're down and you hey man you got a man with stage four brain cancer and lung cancer standing in a pulpit saying god is bigger than cancer god is bigger than cancer but just to prove that this message is the truth amen i know i'm going a little bit long so y'all forgive me he told me to are you hearing me when brother ron went in there for that first scan on that cancer they laid him out on the table and they put a big screen up on this on the board and they said now mr spencer we want you to watch us go in here and get a biopsy when they put that screen up he said they went in with a camera and the doctor said i want you to watch he said there's a cancer there's a cancer there's a cancer he said when the cancer sees this knife coming at it it'll run and hide brother said laying right there on that bed i watched the doctor go in with the needle and as soon as that cancer felt that needle it ran and began to hide he said the doctor had to come out and say we'll have to wait till the cancer shells come back out come on and go back in there he said they went back in there and the cancer ran and hit again you know what cancer is it's a chicken it's a coward come on it's a defeated being come on you tell me how come out of all the demons that the lord the angel could have coped with the random not even cancer we'll stand your way let me let me preach my heart to you right now grace tabernacle not even spiritual cancer will stand in the way of this church not even spiritual cancer will stop this bride's revival not even spiritual cancer will hinder the power of the holy ghost in this church we are not a bunch of chickens we're eagles here we're warriors here and the holy ghost has come down with spiritual operation are you hearing me are you hearing me i'm closing by saying this it's time to get your eyes off the trouble come on let me say this cancer is feeding in the natural or in spiritual cancer is a devil and it's defeated gossip is defeated bitterness is defeated in different spirits just defeat come on church i'm preaching to you amen the scars of the past are defeated grace tabernacle lift up your heads and look up your redemption is drawing nigh i know you've had some bruises come on brother paul i know you had some bad days and all those afflictions they should have become malignancies that would have shut the work of god down but greater is he that is in grace tabernacle that he that is in the devil against it greater thing that is in paul hayward and he that isn't the devil against him come on church you're not going to be you are an invincible army [Applause] brother david it's not coming it's here it's who we are we are overcomers we are the bride we are the warrants hallelujah hallelujah you might as well rejoice you might as well praise god you're on the winning side brother you're on the winning side sister jerry don't matter what has been or what he is or what will be if god before you then who can be against you [Music] [Applause] come on church else shady eyes in the building elohim is in the building draws strength from him right now cancer is defeated come on church the devil is defeated you're not going to be now you are overcomers now you are more than conquerors now you are victorious now you are righteous hallelujah hallelujah what are you saying preacher i'm trying to close by saying what a prophet said he said this little temporary suffering that we go through it's not worthy to be compared are you ready for this to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory amen it'll be revealed in grace tabernacle now i can say it to you like this and i'm done the line affliction cannot compare for our live affliction which is but for a moment amen are you hearing me i'm preaching to you you got to get your focus off the suffering you got to get your focus off the affliction because the light affliction that worketh but for a moment are you willing are you willing to change your focus let me ask you this what are you going to pay attention to the light affliction that worketh but for a moment or this the exceeding eternal far more exceeding an eternal weight of glory while we look under the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen they are eternal are you hearing me no matter what it looks like here can i have five minutes no matter what it looks like here somebody say here we don't look at what we see we look at what we don't see come on now he says colossians 1 15 who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him are all things created that are in heaven and that are in the earth visible and invisible whether they are thrones dominions principalities powers all things were created by him and for him you know what that word visible means it means open to view you know what invisible means it means the thing which is unseen or cannot be seen by the natural eye invisible problem says look at the unseen when a man once catches the vision i'm closing right here when a man once catches the vision of the invisible god and so god and knows that he's always present there is something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes his actions and in the time of distress and troubles it'll still make him look upward and above the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the unseen yet by promise abraham not only did he see the unseen and the reason he believed it was because god said it and if we being dead in christ we are abraham's seed and if the spirit that was in christ dwells in us it does the same thing it takes every divine promise of god that's in the bible and calls it present tense and rest itself upon there come on church we are in possession we're not going to be we are right now this morning in possession of divine promises that were born in the unseen world you say the unseen world there's two worlds there's the seed world and there's the unseen world the problem of god said like this he said well there is no vision that people perish even notice that word vision means divine communication it means prophecy in other words a vision causes you i promise you i'm closing right here a vision causes you to be in two worlds at the same time a vision causes you to be in two worlds at the same time he said you're in this world here now yet you're in another world and you're speaking over there knowing that your voice is being heard back here then pray tell me where was this message coming from it was coming from an unseen world by a son of by a son of man in the seen world then what's on those tapes was not coming from the earth it was coming from the unseen world are you hearing me he says it like this now we can preach the word and we can explain the word but you have to receive the word oh hallelujah that sets you to fire brother when you receive it somebody say when i receive it when i receive it when you receive it the revelation he says something slips out yonder of the unseen world and comes rolling down through a mystical channel somewhere into your soul not your body not your spirit amen the real you into your soul he said see and says now i see it and your eyes brighten your lips that hung down straighten up and smile and every muscle in your body seems to rejoice because something's going to happen come on church come on grace tabernacle why are you still here this morning because you've been charged seen world what are you feeling right now brother it's not andrew glover it's a charge from the unseen world brother paul what moved you a few minutes ago to stand up on your feet and receive from the rest of el shaddai it was a charge from an unseen world among church what's causing these people to rejoice and express themselves in an emotional way it's not a preacher it's a charge from an unseen world hallelujah we're going to make it brother paul we've already made it we have been charged brother jason we've been charged from an unseen world among church this sea world is full of failures it's full of sicknesses it's full of demons it's full of troubles it's full of persecutions it's full it's full of distresses but the unseen world is full of glory it's full of power it's full of love it's full of joy it's full of peace come on lift up your heads and look away to jesus let us stand on our feet this morning hallelujah it's a charge hallelujah it's a charge that's what it is it's the dynamics coming to the mechanics [Music] it's a charge you see when that intellectual faith comes down in your heart and becomes so charged with the unseen world i got a whole other message right there i can't preach i ain't got time to get into it it's an unseen world [Music] i said to you like this brother paul is the bride of jesus christ it's time for us to quit imagining [Music] [Music] we are the reality [Music] brother paul your ministry is the reality of what a king sword coming to a prophet's hand amen young lady you're the reality the word in action [Music] [Music] you're a twofold man the problem of god said you're a twofold man he said if you've got the holy spirit in you i mean it's got the holy spirit can i tell you what the prophet said he said then you are a candidate for association with the unseen world and supernatural no wonder people can't believe in those things they've never come in contact they got nothing in here to believe with are you ready for this but when the holy spirit comes into the heart quickly quickly he becomes then a twofold being one of the earth one of the earth and one of the heaven to live in his body he's still subject to death but in his soul he's passed from death into life in his body he has earthly contact with his five senses in his spirit he has a contact with god through the holy ghost and the angels of god visits them and speaks with them and they are messengers sent from god to reveal and bring the messages from god to the individual [Music] brother paul it's the greater works of john 14. problems in a prayer line he says this is he said these things these things what i do show you also then is god's sworn covenant true is his sworn covenant true then what have we got to be worried about jesus is here his spirit is here don't you love how he says things he said what happened just now i went into another world brother paul what happened to you a few moments ago you went into another world he said we become so conscious of looking at one another like this but there's an unseen world and it's greater than anything you see here and here's christ do you feel that charge when things get so bad you can't even lift up your head and then all of a sudden you say praise the lord where'd that charge come from an unseen world you're a part of two worlds come on church you're following a vision that has changed your vision changed your focus and has connected you to the unseen world you love him this morning [Music] what are you playing says amen amen somebody help me sing that let the worshipers arise how many worshipers have we got here this morning how many how many believers have we got here how many how many people can say lord my focus has been changed i know i pray you all forgive me i had a lot of hay on the fork this morning

nowhere but see i don't have my eyes on present conditions i've got my eyes on what god said about the present condition and here's what god said through david i once was young but now i'm old i've never seen the righteous forsaken or his seed begging for bread i can get my eyes brother on the on the present situation that the gas is high or i can get my eyes on what jesus said but he said give

approach things the way the democrats approach them i don't approach things the way the republic i'm living between two worlds i approach things the way my god would approach him i'm a candidate for

the other day brother jason he said you all forgive me he said this morning he said i preached for three hours i'm thinking three hours but he probably started about nine and got done about twelve he said no he said i started about eight o'clock he said but what was wrong he said as i was preaching and he said while i was preaching he said i saw the holy ghost come in the meeting and break through upon the people and he said while i was preaching he said they were catching what i was saying and he said i couldn't stop because they was getting it [Music] i said the potentials of god had broke

let the worshipers arise and let the sons and the daughters say i'm surrendering my all i surrender to the kings let the worshipers arise let the sons and the daughters sing i'm surrendering my all i surrender to the king saints i just have to share this as the lord laid this upon my heart as brother andrew was preaching [Music] did you hear the call do not focus on your suffering if i can just speak real direct to you if we are not careful our testimony will be this this this this this is wrong in my life [Music] the wife don't listen the children don't listen we don't have enough money the preacher's picking on me it's this i need a new car i want this i'm not happy about that that becomes a testimony of your life and then you'll say i don't know if god's real or not because i feel defeated how about today we lift a hand and say lord i am victorious i am an overcomer the problem in my family the problem in my own life the problem in my church is not my problem lord because what i surrendered i surrendered i don't have a problem i don't have a defeated spirit because i gave it to my king i gave it to my husband hallelujah hallelujah this bride does not see defeat my brother and sister the devil would put that on you and say there's problems there's problems there's problems my husband my wife my children whatever it might be but this bride is not defeated she's been given victory i hope i'm not too bold today but sister zera put those spirits that have you defeated behind you surrender it to the lord amen god is in control of your life god is in control of your destiny not a court not an opinion almighty god is who is in charge and it's about time that we face up in the mirror and say lord forgive me for carrying this to the altar crying picking it back up and taking it home it's not my problem i gave it to my husband my husband said he would take care of me he would be my provider he would be my security he would love me and he would protect me that's all we need to have trust the lord hallelujah if i could just have one more moment this struck me brother andrew something i read when he was talking about the naval [Music] in the days of old the sailing ships [Music] when they faced a storm i hope you get this when they face the storm [Music] they had no other alternative but to take down the sails and hide in the belly of the ship [Music] but god come and said i've got a new horizon for you got a new horizon for you what i want you to do is i want you to climb get up to the top of the sail [Music] and as a prophet went through those struggles of his life god comes to him and speaks and he said path the future is clear come on saints don't go down in the belly of the ship and hope you survive laodicea climb up the sail look to the horizon we've got a new horizon and we can look across there and say i see the way is clear before us why because we've risen oh i hope you get this we haven't hunkered down in laodicea but we climbed up in heavenly places we climbed up in the presence of almighty god and there in the presence of god you can look beyond the horizon of the atomic bomb and the economics and the destruction that satan's wreaking in and family we can look at that and say the clear it is clear my future amen saints our families it's clear before us why because we're no longer earthbound in the belly of a ship but we are climbed up into heavenly places and can look across the horizon and see what god had in store what has god got in store for saints oh the prophet of god said you ever come into that position this bible will become a brand new book to you it's time for us to let that happen oh hallelujah brother andrew could preach i think there's some anointing behind this pulpit oh my oh my oh my come on saints look one more thing i want to comment on [Music] now don't take this as i'm countering what brother andrew said because i'm not at all but we can look at that painting that picture i mean not painting the picture on the wall the parents if your children don't see christ in you you can hang every picture you want on every wall you can have a bible in every room you can play a tape in every room you can do all these things but they've got to be able to see christ in you and i if it's not showing there it won't matter how many church services we take them to but young people i want to speak to you just because you see mom and dad and you're discouraged of something maybe that you see is failure it's not an excuse not excuses brother andrew god called you you're not here by accident you're not here to become satan's cannon fodder you're here to be sons and daughters of god pursue and experience yourself pursue the presence of almighty god learn to invite god yourself it's not complicated all you got to do is take that moment and say lord go with me today lord guide me today protect me today and speak it in the name of jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i'd like to sing that song brother jason amen give us the word or what the title was the specials is it good to be in the house of the lord today i'll tell you what i'll tell you what this is a beautiful
