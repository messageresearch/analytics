[28:39] want to preach tonight on the way of
[28:41] Holiness amen if you have a need you'd
[28:43] like to lift before almighty god let's
[28:45] just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly
[28:47] Father you see our hands and our hearts
[28:50] that are lifted as we come into your
[28:53] presence this evening and we come Lord
[28:56] not as bystanders to observe but we come
[29:00] as Believers to receive Lord May the
[29:03] Holy Spirit Lord finish the great work
[29:06] you have begun in our lives and may the
[29:09] word of God find a resting place in our
[29:11] hearts in our homes in our families in
[29:14] our church Lord May the spirit of God
[29:17] have
[29:18] preeminence and Lord we just give you
[29:21] complete
[29:22] control speak to our hearts give us what
[29:25] we have need of we ask it in Jesus name
[29:30] amen God bless you thank you so much you
[29:32] can have your
[29:35] seats this scripture is
[29:38] beautiful and it has a
[29:41] compound uh meaning to it an application
[29:45] rather as we know that we're reading
[29:47] about the
[29:50] Millennium and uh it has also a
[29:53] spiritual application that applies to us
[29:57] today
[29:59] and uh a highway as the Bible said there
[30:02] shall be a highway and a way a highway
[30:04] is a prominent
[30:06] Road and uh that was even back then Rome
[30:10] was famous for making their
[30:12] roads but the scripture you find is
[30:15] commentaries if you study
[30:18] commentaries they express difficulty
[30:21] trying to understand what exactly this
[30:25] scripture means there shall be a highway
[30:28] and there shall be a
[30:30] way and uh God has always in all ages
[30:34] provided a way for his people amen if
[30:38] God is wanting to get us to a place God
[30:41] will provide a way for us to get there
[30:44] how many believe this blessed Bible is
[30:47] God's way it's God's program it's God's
[30:50] Plan of Salvation and the Bible is the
[30:54] map to eternal life that we are sure to
[30:58] get there we're sure uh not to fail if
[31:01] we follow the word of God and uh there
[31:04] are only two ways there is a right way
[31:08] and there is a wrong way there is man's
[31:10] way and there is God's way and you
[31:13] cannot go right and wrong at the same
[31:16] time you can only go the right way as
[31:20] you follow God in other words that you
[31:22] cannot follow man and God at the same
[31:25] time you must follow God how many want
[31:28] to follow God there's 45,000
[31:32] denominations and everyone believes
[31:35] something different but everyone
[31:37] believes that they are right now there
[31:41] is a right and there is a wrong surely
[31:43] not everyone is right and we don't want
[31:46] everyone to be wrong and the Bible said
[31:50] there is a way that seeth right that's
[31:52] right but that way the end is death and
[31:56] we don't want the way that seems right
[31:59] we want the way that is right and that
[32:01] way is by the Bible praise the Lord so
[32:06] to refuse the right way is to take the
[32:09] wrong way that right to re reject the
[32:12] Holy Ghost is to reject life eternal so
[32:17] it it
[32:18] it it is
[32:20] uh a caution to
[32:23] us to
[32:25] study where we are going
[32:29] because there is only one right way
[32:33] amen and it behooves us to study what
[32:36] we're
[32:37] doing and the direction that we're
[32:40] going and we cannot go wrong with the
[32:43] word of
[32:44] God and the blood will never fail
[32:48] us if you pull up that scripture there
[32:50] in John 14 verse one this is familiar to
[32:54] us as we kind of get our footing this
[32:56] evening
[32:58] these are Jesus words he said let not
[33:01] your heart be troubled you believe in
[33:04] God believe also in me in my father's
[33:08] house are many
[33:09] mansions and if it were not so I would
[33:12] have told you I go to prepare a place
[33:15] for you and if I go and prepare a place
[33:19] for you I will come again and receive
[33:21] you unto myself that where I am ye may
[33:25] be also and whether I go you know and
[33:29] the way you know and Thomas saith un him
[33:33] Lord we know not whether thou goest or
[33:37] how can we know the way and Jesus saith
[33:40] unto him I am the way the truth and the
[33:44] life and no man can come unto the father
[33:49] but by Me Jesus was saying at Calvary
[33:53] that he opened up the way that God is no
[33:58] respector of persons black man white man
[34:01] yellow man whosoever will if he wants
[34:04] life there is a way provided for that
[34:06] man and there is a way that we have
[34:09] desired life there is a way for us to
[34:12] receive life and Jesus destroyed the
[34:16] workings of the devil that day at
[34:19] Calvary he destroyed the power of the
[34:21] enemy Satan was knocked out and his
[34:24] backbone was broken that day how how
[34:27] many believe that God became a man and
[34:31] God paid our price and he made a way
[34:34] that we could
[34:35] live and Satan lost the
[34:39] battle and Jesus said I am the way and
[34:43] that way is a way of Holiness praise the
[34:47] lord we know that Jesus had connected
[34:50] God and man so man could return back to
[34:54] God again so Jesus when he said I am the
[34:57] way he was the way of
[35:00] Holiness bear with me just for a
[35:03] moment in Acts chapter 19 I want you to
[35:06] look at these scriptures here in the New
[35:09] Testament sa in verse one I've got it I
[35:11] got the scriptures here for you so you
[35:14] don't have to turn there it said Saul
[35:17] yet breathing out threatenings and
[35:20] Slaughter against the Disciples of the
[35:22] Lord went unto the high priest and he
[35:25] desired of him letters to Damascus us to
[35:29] the synagogue that he that if he found
[35:33] any of this
[35:36] way that's right whether they were men
[35:39] or women that he might bring them bound
[35:42] unto Jerusalem now he was looking for
[35:45] those if he found any of those in this
[35:50] way in the New Testament the word way is
[35:55] expressing the Believers the gospel El
[35:59] the Bible calls it the way of the Lord
[36:00] the way of life the way of Salvation go
[36:04] to Chapter 19 Verse 8 it says it again
[36:07] here and he went into the synagogue and
[36:10] he spake boldly for the space of three
[36:13] months disputing and persuading the
[36:15] things concerning the kingdom of God but
[36:19] when diverse were hardened and believed
[36:22] not but spake evil of that way
[36:27] before the multitude he departed from
[36:30] them and so on and so forth so once
[36:32] again the scripture when it's speaking
[36:34] of the Gospel is calling it the way
[36:38] notice chapter
[36:40] 24:14 if you'll pull that up for
[36:47] me it says and this I confess unto
[36:51] thee that after the way which they call
[36:56] heresy
[36:57] yeah so worship I the god of my fathers
[37:01] praise the
[37:02] Lord so the way of
[37:05] Holiness the New Testament calls it the
[37:08] way and and now this sounds confusing
[37:12] and I want to preach on this this
[37:13] evening there shall be a
[37:16] highway and a way amen and as I was
[37:19] saying commentaries really don't fully
[37:22] you read them they can't seem to get
[37:24] their footing on it it's a little
[37:26] difficult to understand stand but but
[37:28] there's a there's a spiritual symbology
[37:31] here and brother Brandon brought great
[37:34] light to this uh watch this now as we uh
[37:38] out of
[37:40] expectations it said God said in Isaiah
[37:43] 35 there shall be a highway and many of
[37:47] you dear nazarenes used to sing a
[37:49] Highway of Holiness now there shall be a
[37:53] highway and and is a conjunction it ties
[37:56] your sentence together
[37:58] and a way and it should be called the
[38:01] way of Holiness not the Highway of
[38:04] Holiness amen but the way yeah now watch
[38:07] this a correct road is built so water
[38:12] washes the trash to one side or the
[38:16] other and he said you would either be
[38:19] real cold or starchy or fanatic and then
[38:22] he breaks a sentence the way watch this
[38:25] the way is right in the middle of the
[38:31] road right towards Calvary right up the
[38:35] middle of the road so there shall be a
[38:39] highway and a way and the way is the
[38:42] middle of it and the road is made so
[38:45] it's so the water runs to each side of
[38:49] the ditch amen one time brother brandom
[38:52] was preaching and he had said something
[38:54] of this nature and and this manner had
[38:57] come out to speak to what brother
[38:59] brandham was saying and he did not know
[39:02] brother brandham was behind him and he
[39:04] said brother brandham certainly had bad
[39:06] driving ethics as he said that you're
[39:10] driving down the middle of the road and
[39:13] brother brandham was behind him and he
[39:14] didn't know it and brother brandham
[39:16] spoke up and said brother you think too
[39:18] Earthly he said that's a Earthly Road
[39:22] the man said you'll get in a head-on
[39:24] collision if you ride in the middle of
[39:25] the road and brother Bram said I'm not
[39:28] talking Earthly I'm talking Heavenly and
[39:31] this is a oneway
[39:33] road we're not going backwards we're
[39:36] going all the
[39:37] way hallelujah how many believe that he
[39:41] said you got to quit your Earthly
[39:43] thinking this is a one-way road now the
[39:47] way of Holiness is in the middle of the
[39:53] road now not everyone on the highway is
[39:56] going to make it that's right so there
[39:59] is a Highway and there is a bunch of
[40:02] people traveling on it right but the way
[40:05] is in the middle amen if you will pull
[40:08] up the patmas vision I want you to see
[40:10] this here brother bam said you know I've
[40:13] always tried to be
[40:15] this and our Lord has always revealed it
[40:18] to me there's an
[40:21] extreme and another
[40:24] extreme but right in the middle of the
[40:27] Road lays the
[40:29] truth that's right praise the Lord see
[40:33] there are isms in both sides of the
[40:37] ditch and so when he said there is a
[40:40] highway there are people going off the
[40:42] road but there is a way that is right in
[40:45] the middle and he said the Lord revealed
[40:48] this to me there are two
[40:51] ditches
[40:52] right and when you're driving you're
[40:55] constantly correcting yes right amen
[40:59] when you're driving you're constantly
[41:01] moving and I know as a minister as a
[41:04] Christian I have felt this way in times
[41:07] of my life and then after a few years
[41:10] you come over here on the other side and
[41:12] you you has anyone ever experienced that
[41:15] you used to be over here and then life's
[41:18] bitter blows give you maturity and you
[41:20] come over a little bit said if I could
[41:22] go back I wouldn't have been maybe so
[41:25] heavy-handed or I wouldn't have thought
[41:27] it that way you know and all of us
[41:29] that's part of life am that's right and
[41:32] we're driving we're trying to stay right
[41:35] in the middle of the
[41:37] road and you'll find that every truth
[41:40] has two ditches right the godhead you've
[41:44] got trinitarianism over here and you've
[41:47] got Oneness over here but the truth of
[41:49] it is right down the middle of the road
[41:52] you've got marriage and divorce brother
[41:54] brandom said there were two thoughts
[41:56] you've got predestination and you got
[41:58] free choice you've got faith and you've
[42:01] got works and every truth is right in
[42:05] the
[42:06] middle isn't that
[42:09] wonderful praise the Lord now brother
[42:11] brandham said now just like
[42:14] tongues tongues is written in the Bible
[42:18] the Bible said forbid not speaking in
[42:20] tongues but what happened is the
[42:23] Pentecostals began to lean real hard on
[42:27] Acts 2 and 4 Acts 2 and 4 Acts 2 and 4
[42:31] but there's nine spiritual gifts what
[42:34] happened to the other eight but what
[42:37] happens is men begin to lean one way and
[42:41] when they lean one way they end up in
[42:43] the
[42:44] ditch we believe in the whole counsel of
[42:47] God we believe in every word of God can
[42:51] you say amen God send the tongues God
[42:54] send the gifts and brother brandham said
[42:56] if the devil can't keep you from seeing
[42:59] truth he'll make you go overboard with
[43:03] it right every false Doctrine is built
[43:07] off truth amen we can we've seen that in
[43:11] our own in our own ranks and brother
[43:13] brandham said now if you're a little
[43:15] emotional he said you'll go off on this
[43:18] ditch he said if you're a little
[43:20] scholarly and a little intellectual he
[43:23] said you can go off in this ditch
[43:27] and he said
[43:29] now this side will condemn that sideen
[43:33] that's the and so the emotional ones
[43:36] will be throwing off on the starchy ones
[43:39] and the starchy ones will be throwing
[43:41] off on the emotional ones but we can
[43:43] pull from both
[43:47] sides it's
[43:50] amazing the human
[43:52] beings so if we're not careful we can go
[43:55] from the frying pot to the frying pan
[43:58] yes sir amen praise the Lord Brother
[44:01] Brenham said now the first organization
[44:04] was the Catholic
[44:06] Church from 325 ad all the way up to the
[44:10] 1500s with Luther one
[44:13] denomination then Luther was the second
[44:17] brother bandom said Luther was the
[44:18] second
[44:20] denomination and then zwingley broke
[44:24] off this one broke off this one's
[44:28] splintered this one's splintered now
[44:31] we've got
[44:32] 45,000 I think it's more than that
[44:34] 45,000 denominations that splintered
[44:39] off have you seen that Among Us truth
[44:43] comeing a splinter and Splinter and
[44:45] Splinter and it's
[44:49] this everyone will quote a quote and
[44:52] point to the
[44:55] scriptures and then brother Brandon said
[44:57] the Pentecostals split and split and
[44:59] split until they're divided into
[45:05] hundreds and then brother Bram said this
[45:07] he said now have you ever studied the
[45:09] history of
[45:11] Revival a Revival signifies a move of
[45:14] God and power and every time God moves
[45:18] Satan moves also yes sir he said the
[45:21] Welsh Revival he said quickly insane in
[45:24] institutions filled up Wesley day pecul
[45:28] people did peculiar things and and uh
[45:31] Satan was mocking the goodness of God
[45:33] and Luther's day he said the miracle
[45:35] laid in the fact that he could be sound
[45:37] and sane in the midst of Fanatics then
[45:40] listen to this he said have you been
[45:43] aware of this last day Ministry you have
[45:45] noted the same invasion of false Wicked
[45:48] Spirits it has to be that
[45:52] way and I hope you and Trust you're
[45:55] spiritually minded enough to get that to
[45:59] capitalize upon
[46:02] it so I'm not trying to make you
[46:05] suspicious but we should be Discerning
[46:08] that's right and we should start with
[46:12] ourselves it's so easy to judge someone
[46:15] else but it can be kind of hard to judge
[46:17] yourself that's right to check your
[46:19] motives and to search your own heart how
[46:21] many want to be pure-hearted and God
[46:23] lord search
[46:25] me if I'm wrong I want to be right and I
[46:28] don't care what that costs me if I have
[46:29] to humble myself and we can never
[46:32] underestimate the power of Satan to
[46:35] deceive that's it God forbid that that
[46:38] we should underestimate his powers to to
[46:42] come and deceive us we must stay under
[46:46] the word of God as our
[46:49] protection now brother brandom said the
[46:51] two spirits of the last day are formal
[46:53] and fanatical that's right direct quote
[46:57] he said those are the two Spirits he
[46:59] said Satan is always trying to
[47:01] counterfeit and he will shake things
[47:04] before you to get you off track that's
[47:07] right so you must stay with the
[47:10] scriptures
[47:12] amen constantly like like Eve you must
[47:15] stay fortified behind the word of God
[47:19] now brother this is amazing brother
[47:21] brandom said if a man is unstable in the
[47:23] word he's vulnerable to isms that's it
[47:27] amen have you ever seen that some people
[47:29] repeat the mistake if you are not solid
[47:32] in the scriptures that means that you
[47:34] can fall in either ditch you get pulled
[47:36] off to every wind of Doctrine and you're
[47:38] all over the
[47:40] map and we're no stronger than our faith
[47:44] and adherent our adherence to the word
[47:46] of
[47:47] God we need Revelation more than
[47:50] anything we need Revelation by the
[47:53] spirit to discern amen amen
[47:57] Matthew 7: 13 we're in an hour where we
[48:01] have got to put on the full armor of God
[48:05] really know our standing in Christ
[48:08] Matthew 7 verse
[48:11] 13 enter ye in at the Straight
[48:15] Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is
[48:19] the way that leadth to
[48:21] destruction and many there be which go
[48:25] thereat
[48:27] because straight is the gate and narrow
[48:31] is the way which leadth unto
[48:34] life and few there be that find
[48:38] it now brother brandham said the Lord
[48:41] was giving a Stern warning to that
[48:45] dispensation amen he said because they
[48:48] thought they were
[48:50] right and they were really struggling
[48:53] with God in flesh right yeah that's
[48:57] right because he was the word made flesh
[48:59] and it was the closing of the Jewish
[49:03] dispensation and they're trying to to
[49:06] grasp it and they're having a hard way
[49:07] to go about
[49:10] this and Jesus tells them enter ye in at
[49:15] the Straight Gate for broad is the way
[49:19] that leads under
[49:21] destruction but narrow is the way that's
[49:24] it that leads to life
[49:28] sometimes we are forced to make a
[49:31] choice of which way we're going to
[49:35] take and a good example of that is
[49:38] Abraham Abraham and lot they had a
[49:41] choice before them and brother brandham
[49:44] said that Abraham chose the harder
[49:47] way and he said lot chose the easier way
[49:52] as he cast his tent toward Sodom he said
[49:55] because things
[49:57] were easy down there he said but many
[50:00] times the easy way is the wrong
[50:03] way he said when you follow Christ
[50:06] you'll be hated and persecuted and all
[50:09] will be against you he said but you must
[50:12] come with your own confession and your
[50:15] own faith in Jesus Christ amen it's not
[50:19] always with the multitude no sir right
[50:22] it's not always easy matter of fact
[50:26] that's when my battles
[50:28] began now he said lot followed the path
[50:31] of popularity yes
[50:34] sir had good job
[50:38] opportunity a lot of money he
[50:40] said he said but he made the wrong
[50:45] choice and brother bandham said that God
[50:47] will bring us to a place where we must
[50:50] make a choice amen of which way we're
[50:55] going to take and the devil will offer
[50:57] you some really good
[51:00] benefits y that's right oh
[51:05] yeah and brother brandham said millions
[51:08] times billions will miss the gate that's
[51:12] right I'm not trying to scare you
[51:15] right but he said millions will go the
[51:18] broad
[51:22] way now watch this narrow way is you and
[51:27] Christ alone that's
[51:30] it now we're for everyone we want
[51:34] everyone to win we want everyone to be
[51:36] saved Jesus is not willing that any
[51:38] would
[51:39] perish but when it comes to this walk it
[51:43] is you and God alone that's right the
[51:48] pastor will point the way the prophet
[51:50] will point the way the Evangelist will
[51:53] point the way the Bible will point the
[51:56] way
[51:57] but at the end of the day it's about you
[51:59] and
[52:00] God God don't make cookie
[52:03] cutters everyone is fearfully and
[52:06] wonderfully made they're made
[52:07] differently and God has a different
[52:09] purpose for every
[52:11] individual now the spirit of
[52:14] organization is the Broadway yes sir it
[52:17] is for years when brother brandham uh
[52:20] preached on denominationalism I thought
[52:22] it was the physical entity right and
[52:26] recent years I realize denominationalism
[52:28] is a
[52:32] spirit and that we must discern the
[52:34] spirits whether they be of God Amen and
[52:38] the only way to do that is by the
[52:41] word do not go with the crowd go with
[52:46] Christ the straight and the narrow way
[52:51] and brother brandham said the straight
[52:52] and narrow way is the middle of the road
[52:56] that's right amen amen how many want to
[53:00] walk with Jesus and go that straight and
[53:02] narrow way may God keep us there now
[53:06] that way is
[53:09] misunderstood when you walk with God
[53:12] you're
[53:13] misunderstood because the spirit don't
[53:16] always make sense right that's it
[53:19] sometimes people accuse you of having
[53:22] different motives and objectives and but
[53:25] walk with God Amen it don't really
[53:28] matter at the end of the day that's
[53:30] right walk with God if you hear from God
[53:34] you stand on that and it it'll come out
[53:37] you may have to bear the reproach of the
[53:39] word but it'll work
[53:41] out praise the Lord the way of Holiness
[53:46] is the word of God
[53:48] amen
[53:51] amen April 11th
[53:55] 1960 brother brandham has an incredible
[53:59] Vision he has a a vision
[54:03] of
[54:06] well just before the one I'm going to
[54:09] speak of this were a couple Visions
[54:11] connected he saw a vision of uh I think
[54:15] three ladies and a man they wanted to
[54:17] build a meeting they were building a
[54:20] building and as they were building it a
[54:24] ray of light came out and and the
[54:26] building
[54:28] exploded and in the vision the men and
[54:31] the women came with nail guns and said
[54:34] we're going to rebuild it and what
[54:36] happened is brother Brandon was
[54:38] pressured to do
[54:40] meetings but God told him don't do it
[54:42] and he said I felt the nudge not to do
[54:44] it but I wanted to help
[54:46] him and he said so I was going to do it
[54:48] anyway and he said when the time came
[54:51] for me to preach he said my throat shut
[54:53] up and he said for nine days days of
[54:56] fever he said I couldn't even
[54:59] whisper and he said I I looked at MAA
[55:02] and said why in the world do this
[55:04] happening go sometimes I wonder if I'm
[55:06] even
[55:08] called
[55:11] 1960 you all don't go through those kind
[55:14] of things just just preachers go through
[55:20] that I thank God brother Brandon was
[55:24] real I tell you if he didn't tell us
[55:26] that we would be discouraged
[55:29] preachers and MAA you know what MAA
[55:31] tells him she says God knows about it
[55:34] she said stop that and she corrected him
[55:36] that's that's
[55:39] right and he said thus sayith the Lord
[55:41] he said men and women will end up at
[55:43] your door and they're going to tell you
[55:45] reschedule the meeting he says they're
[55:47] going to come to the door and brother
[55:48] bandham told it before it happened he
[55:50] said they're going to come to the door
[55:51] he said tell them no and he he refused
[55:54] it so in this vision
[55:57] he saw the wall open up and he saw the
[55:59] blue sky and he said a Bible was in the
[56:02] sky and out of the Bible came a cross
[56:04] and out of the Cross walked the Lord
[56:07] Jesus right out he said I think it was
[56:08] the second or the third time that he
[56:11] ever saw
[56:12] him and Jesus said you're waiting on
[56:15] your commission he goes you just it's
[56:18] already here you've got to accept it he
[56:22] said just like salvation is already here
[56:24] all you got to do is accept it that's
[56:26] right then he says the most incredible
[56:28] thing he's looking for the third pole to
[56:30] be fulfilled his ministry and the Lord
[56:33] said it's already been confir you just
[56:35] got to accept it then he said this you
[56:38] walk with too many that's
[56:42] it he said to walk with the Lord is to
[56:46] walk
[56:49] alone now this is the third
[56:52] poll this is the words the third pole
[56:55] the word coming forth he said to walk
[56:57] with me that's it you must walk alone
[57:02] Hallelujah so now the ranks are thinning
[57:06] brother brandom is now coming to his
[57:08] commission the word but in order to walk
[57:11] with the word he must walk alone he must
[57:15] be un
[57:16] misunderstood he might he's going to be
[57:19] rejected it is a straight and a narrow
[57:21] way but it is the way of Holiness that's
[57:25] right
[57:26] it is a word that'll bring a bride right
[57:29] down the middle of the
[57:31] road it is a word that'll restore the
[57:34] Bible back to the people again
[57:38] Hallelujah to walk with me you walk
[57:41] alone he said you've catered too much to
[57:44] the
[57:47] organizations praise the
[57:49] Lord and I believe that's all of us Amen
[57:53] to walk with this word you will walk
[57:56] alone amen that's right amen that's
[57:59] right now I want I want you to see this
[58:00] brother brandham because he's walking
[58:03] with the word he said I preach against
[58:05] the women all the other Pentecostals are
[58:08] lowering the standards and now they're
[58:11] becoming offended at Holiness
[58:14] Preaching
[58:16] that's if you look at the those old
[58:19] Pentecostal in the 1940s to the 1960s
[58:23] sir it is a drastic change Chang what
[58:27] the Bible never changed hair started
[58:30] getting cut brother brandom Elijah the
[58:32] uncompromising Elijah is pounding it
[58:35] over the pulpit and people are resenting
[58:37] it they love his crowds but they're
[58:40] resenting the preaching just get to the
[58:42] praying
[58:45] amen amen and brother brandom we don't
[58:48] know this until after the seals he's
[58:51] beginning to develop a complex that's
[58:55] right amen yeah it's hurting
[58:57] him because he's walking with the
[59:01] word and to walk with the word you walk
[59:05] alone and now as best friends Jack Moore
[59:08] Gordon Lindsay men that had seen the boy
[59:11] raised from the dead seen Mir countless
[59:13] Miracles the Mexico Miracles the dead
[59:16] baby Rose they saw the prophecy never
[59:19] failed but they still turn away
[59:27] and he said the more I preached the
[59:29] worse it
[59:30] got listen to this he said I became
[59:33] nervous I become I'm a neurotic kind of
[59:36] person I felt insufficient for the job
[59:39] and he said you know I thought God why
[59:42] did you call me I have failed so now
[59:45] because he's an uneducated man he's a
[59:48] bootlegger son he feels like he is
[59:51] failing right he's starting to get a
[59:55] complex
[59:57] he's thinking I'm not the man for the
[1:00:03] job
[1:00:05] right brother brandom said I had almost
[1:00:08] a nervous breakdown two or three
[1:00:10] times
[1:00:12] credible see
[1:00:14] rejection is affecting the
[1:00:18] prophet rejection affects us amen right
[1:00:22] sure does we really need to be spiritual
[1:00:24] at these times to walk with the word
[1:00:26] amen because this is not a congregation
[1:00:30] thing and we thank the Lord for the body
[1:00:32] of Believers you remember brother
[1:00:33] brandom taught an outer court and inner
[1:00:35] court and the holies of holies how many
[1:00:37] remember that the outer court is the
[1:00:39] message
[1:00:40] community and man of falls out in that
[1:00:43] Community but it is about you and God in
[1:00:46] the holies of
[1:00:48] holies we cannot stay in the outer
[1:00:50] courts God's calling us to the hidden
[1:00:53] life to the land of adoption amen that's
[1:00:56] right that's exact you in the word alone
[1:00:59] you in the presence of God Alone
[1:01:02] Hallelujah it ain't the community sir
[1:01:07] sir the complex begins to change brother
[1:01:10] brenham's attitude yes sir you never
[1:01:13] would have discerned it I couldn't
[1:01:15] discern it I studied very closely I
[1:01:18] couldn't discern that this was happening
[1:01:20] until he tells us about it ex right and
[1:01:23] he said well if they won't hear me
[1:01:26] I'll just head off into the mountains
[1:01:29] you know what he says he said I'll just
[1:01:31] trap ma up
[1:01:34] there that's right thousands of miles
[1:01:38] away from
[1:01:39] Walmart that's right I'll grow my beard
[1:01:43] out I'm not going to leave the Lord when
[1:01:46] God gives me a vision I'll stomp out
[1:01:48] like Elijah thus sayith the Lord yeah
[1:01:52] and I'll go back and he said when God
[1:01:54] ain't using me I'll catch some big
[1:01:56] fish sounds pretty
[1:02:00] good you know the
[1:02:03] story and as brother brandham is driving
[1:02:06] there God begins to speak to
[1:02:09] him and he said you have lost the love
[1:02:12] for the people that's it right there
[1:02:15] rejection Y and he said I have called
[1:02:19] you to a much higher office than the
[1:02:22] prophets of old dear God that's right he
[1:02:25] said you have lost the love of the
[1:02:27] people and as brother brandham is is
[1:02:30] talking about this he refers to an
[1:02:32] experience that he had in 1961 January
[1:02:36] in Los Angeles at a men's breakfast he
[1:02:39] preaches and he said I was tearing the
[1:02:41] hide off of them and he said Denny Henry
[1:02:45] who was a Baptist came and put his arm
[1:02:47] around me and said brother brandom that
[1:02:49] could have been the 23rd chapter of
[1:02:52] Revelation and he said he began speaking
[1:02:54] in tongues knowing knowing nothing of
[1:02:57] the gifts of the Spirit and then the
[1:02:59] interpretation came forth as we know
[1:03:02] there were three people that interpreted
[1:03:04] it and when it was interpreted it was
[1:03:07] the spirit speaking because thou H has
[1:03:10] chosen the narrow
[1:03:13] way amen the harder
[1:03:17] way and thou has walked in thine own
[1:03:23] choosing see he said Moses had to make
[1:03:25] his Choice yes sir thou has picked the
[1:03:29] precise and the correct
[1:03:36] way and he
[1:03:38] says and a correct
[1:03:41] decision it is my way
[1:03:46] amen he said underlined my way the Holy
[1:03:49] Spirit speaking back because of this
[1:03:52] momentous decision a huge portion of
[1:03:54] Heaven awaits you what a glorious
[1:03:57] decision thou has made this in itself
[1:04:01] which will make come to pass the
[1:04:03] tremendous victory of love divine amen
[1:04:08] amen so when brother Brandon was walking
[1:04:11] with the word he was walking alone and
[1:04:15] he was
[1:04:16] misunderstood and he was
[1:04:19] rejected and to walk the straight and
[1:04:22] narrow way amen will cost us something
[1:04:24] amen amen that's right it will
[1:04:28] exactly when everyone else says it's
[1:04:30] okay but you say I'm staying with the
[1:04:32] word amen amen amen that's right it
[1:04:37] hurts amen and the rejection is
[1:04:40] painful yes
[1:04:43] sir brother brandham said that God has
[1:04:46] given us a road map to
[1:04:50] power he said when I have crossed this
[1:04:53] country so much
[1:04:56] he said I can tell you how long it'll
[1:04:58] take me to get to a destination within
[1:05:01] 15 minutes and sometimes he said I HIIT
[1:05:04] it right on the dot he said see I've
[1:05:09] covered it so much I just know it and
[1:05:13] brother brandham said that's the way God
[1:05:15] wants us to know this Bible That's Right
[1:05:18] amen he wants us to covered inside and
[1:05:21] out I think more than just memorization
[1:05:23] I think he wants us to know it
[1:05:26] uh by our experience he said now his
[1:05:29] road map is our Bible and the Bible road
[1:05:33] map leads to power and he said and Faith
[1:05:37] leads you to power and power produces
[1:05:41] the
[1:05:42] promise so the way the way of Holiness
[1:05:47] leads us to power which produces the
[1:05:51] manifestation of God's word in our life
[1:05:55] praise the Lord Lord many times people
[1:05:57] get detoured but the holy spirit will
[1:06:00] bring us to Pentecost every time I'm
[1:06:04] talking about reality Pentecostal
[1:06:07] reality and he said now some people when
[1:06:11] they're born again he said they sat
[1:06:13] right in the middle of the road with
[1:06:14] their eyes on Christ can I go just a few
[1:06:17] more
[1:06:18] minutes he said finally they get over on
[1:06:21] so much knowledge and wisdom that they
[1:06:23] know it all and he said and you don't
[1:06:26] know nothing that's right and if you
[1:06:28] don't do that he said you run off on the
[1:06:31] other side and have a bunch of wildfire
[1:06:33] of
[1:06:34] fanaticism but right in the middle of
[1:06:37] the road is the true sound unadulterated
[1:06:41] gospel and power of God he said it's the
[1:06:45] power of almighty God not fanaticism or
[1:06:48] formality it is the power of
[1:06:52] God he said the great Heroes of Faith
[1:06:55] have walked the middle of the
[1:06:58] road pulling from both sides not
[1:07:01] fighting the other side but ping from
[1:07:04] both sides how many can say amen and
[1:07:07] when we stand on the word the mountain
[1:07:10] will crumble when we stand on the word
[1:07:12] the sickness will crumble when we stand
[1:07:15] on the word the Red Sea will move back
[1:07:18] and Devils will tremble when you stand
[1:07:21] on the word hallelujah everything will
[1:07:24] fall to your left or to your right and
[1:07:26] he said just stay with the
[1:07:30] word the moving of the holy spirit is in
[1:07:33] the middle of the road amen that's where
[1:07:37] the moving of the spirit happens is when
[1:07:40] you walk the straight and the narrow way
[1:07:44] amise don't follow the crowd amen
[1:07:48] right let God speak to you amen amen let
[1:07:53] God speak to you as an individual how to
[1:07:56] dress how to conduct yourself how to
[1:08:00] walk amen you believe
[1:08:03] that brother brandom said brother
[1:08:05] there's a middle of the road there's
[1:08:08] where the true gospel is preached and
[1:08:11] real Bible signs and wonders are
[1:08:13] following the real Sweet Holy Spirit
[1:08:16] leads the church that's the kind of
[1:08:19] church to go to an intelligent Church
[1:08:22] preaching the word standing on the word
[1:08:24] with a full whole gospel sermon the real
[1:08:27] spirit of God everything in the spirit
[1:08:30] everything decent everybody in order
[1:08:33] everything in love that's the kind of
[1:08:35] church we want how many would say amen
[1:08:39] that's the kind of Christian I want to
[1:08:40] be I want to be right down the middle of
[1:08:44] the
[1:08:45] road the Bible tells us Hebrews
[1:08:49] 11:5 by faith Enoch was
[1:08:53] translated that he should not see death
[1:08:56] and he was not found because God had
[1:08:58] translated him for before his
[1:09:01] translation he had this testimony that
[1:09:03] he pleased God for without faith it's
[1:09:07] impossible to please God and he that
[1:09:11] cometh of God must believe that he is
[1:09:13] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:09:15] diligently seek himen the Bible tells us
[1:09:18] that all the days of Enoch was
[1:09:22] 365
[1:09:24] years so that means that that Enoch did
[1:09:28] not start walking with God till he was
[1:09:32] 65 that's when Enoch made his first step
[1:09:36] 65
[1:09:38] years praise the Lord anyone over 65
[1:09:44] here how sad that's pitiful they're like
[1:09:47] that's something to be proud of the
[1:09:49] keeping power of
[1:09:51] God that's that's wonderful that's
[1:09:54] that's near the age when Enoch started
[1:09:57] walking with God there was a time he
[1:09:59] took his first
[1:10:00] step remember your first step 300 years
[1:10:05] he walked with God 300 years of
[1:10:08] faithfulness and Enoch means dedicated
[1:10:11] amen committed amen
[1:10:14] devoted faithful
[1:10:17] wholehearted singl minded how many want
[1:10:21] to be Enoch Enoch walked with God but
[1:10:25] but he had to First make a step and to
[1:10:29] walk with God you must walk with the
[1:10:31] word amen that's right every individual
[1:10:34] that walks with God walks with the word
[1:10:37] that means walking in the light of the
[1:10:39] age walking in the message of the hour
[1:10:43] and Enoch never missed one word he
[1:10:46] amened the word of God when God revealed
[1:10:49] it to him he rejoiced in it and he
[1:10:51] walked in it and we can only walk with
[1:10:54] the word when we agree with the
[1:10:56] word your heart says amen how many say
[1:11:00] Amen to the message Enoch was a type of
[1:11:03] the seventh age that's right that we
[1:11:05] would walk with God God would have a
[1:11:07] bride that walked with God and he
[1:11:10] pleased God because he believed God and
[1:11:12] he walked with the word of God that's a
[1:11:15] type of you amen that's a type of me
[1:11:19] that's a type of the raptured group and
[1:11:21] brother Ram said Enoch kep every word he
[1:11:25] said how many Enochs would there be
[1:11:27] today when God speaks in 1 Corinthians
[1:11:30] 11 about our hair or Deuteronomy 225 in
[1:11:34] our dress or or you know walking in the
[1:11:37] light of the word of God he said how
[1:11:40] many Enochs would we have he said but
[1:11:43] notice Jesus walked with the word amen
[1:11:48] he was the word he said he walked
[1:11:51] unconscious he believed what God Said
[1:11:54] was true
[1:11:56] and the words must be fulfilled and he
[1:11:58] know that his life was to fulfill them
[1:12:02] he said and you're here to fulfill it
[1:12:04] too just walk unconscious of fear walk
[1:12:09] unconscious of criticism amen walk
[1:12:12] unconscious of the world walk as you
[1:12:16] walk in Christ walk with him not paying
[1:12:19] attention to the right or to the left
[1:12:21] just keep moving on if something comes
[1:12:24] up in the church
[1:12:25] walk with God if sickness strikes you
[1:12:28] walk with God if your neighbor don't
[1:12:30] like you walk with God just keep walking
[1:12:34] with God Enoch one day walked like that
[1:12:37] and you know what he done he walked all
[1:12:39] the way home to be with God he said he
[1:12:42] got so far up the road he did not want
[1:12:45] to come back again he said walk with God
[1:12:48] doctor says you're going to D die walk
[1:12:51] with God he said now God God promised
[1:12:55] you I'll never leave you nor forsake you
[1:12:58] you have your ups and downs don't worry
[1:13:01] you're going to go through Brier patches
[1:13:04] right you're going to go over sharp
[1:13:06] rocks and Bluffs and hillsides and
[1:13:08] through the mountains and over the
[1:13:09] waters but walk with
[1:13:12] God one time he was walking he was just
[1:13:15] 300 years of Walking with God and
[1:13:18] brother brandham said all of a sudden
[1:13:20] gravitation begin to let go how many are
[1:13:23] looking forward to that day
[1:13:25] Pastor Paul comes out preaching the word
[1:13:27] and all of a sudden you feel yourself
[1:13:29] going through the ceiling walk with God
[1:13:32] one of these days gravitation will lose
[1:13:34] its hold and he said he left this path
[1:13:37] he he said he kissed his wife goodbye
[1:13:40] and he walked down an old familiar path
[1:13:43] he said and all of a sudden he started
[1:13:45] stepping up until he stepped up on the
[1:13:47] King's Highway and he said he walked
[1:13:50] with God until he left and he was into
[1:13:52] the presence of the Lord amen
[1:13:55] GL there shall be a highway yes and a
[1:14:00] way and it shall be called the way of
[1:14:04] Holiness amen he said a good road is
[1:14:07] built the highest part is in the center
[1:14:10] and it lets the trash wash off both
[1:14:13] sides and when a man really comes to
[1:14:16] Christ and got his eyes centered on
[1:14:18] Christ he said if he's a little
[1:14:20] emotional he'll be fanatic if he's a
[1:14:22] little cold he said be on the other side
[1:14:24] just be a cucumber over there on the
[1:14:26] other side he said but the main thing is
[1:14:30] in the middle of the road with enough
[1:14:33] spirit in you to keep you warm and
[1:14:36] moving amen amen knowing enough to keep
[1:14:39] yourself under The Obedience of the
[1:14:41] spirit just as the spirit moves you not
[1:14:46] till or not after but just as the spirit
[1:14:50] moves you amen amen you see when a man
[1:14:52] is converted his eyes is set towards
[1:14:54] couch Calvary he if he's a little
[1:14:56] nervous he don't watch he said he'll go
[1:14:58] to The Fanatic side if he's a little
[1:15:00] scholar he'll becomeing the starchy side
[1:15:02] but right in the middle of the road is
[1:15:05] the same sane sensible Born Again Spirit
[1:15:11] Le endowed Church of the Living God
[1:15:14] right straight down the road to Christ
[1:15:17] the real coming from both sides one went
[1:15:21] one way one went the other shows
[1:15:22] fanaticism scholarly two stiff bow he
[1:15:25] said but they know more about the word
[1:15:28] than they do the
[1:15:29] author to know the word is not life
[1:15:33] that's it but to know him that's right
[1:15:35] is
[1:15:37] life how many say Lord I want to be
[1:15:39] balanced that's it I want to be a
[1:15:42] balanced man yes sir I want to be quick
[1:15:45] to hear and slow to speak that's it Lord

[1:15:55] Discerning Lord I want to be patient

[1:16:00] middle of the road let me walk in the
[1:16:04] way of

[1:16:11] feet I want to walk with

[1:17:18] show us the bride how she should walk in
[1:17:23] the middle of the road where there's
[1:17:24] just enough room for you and
[1:17:27] her we thank the prophet when you

[1:22:48] ohly
[1:22:52] Spirit through me
[1:22:57] I think something that we can all
[1:22:58] benefit from was brother brandom's
[1:23:02] transparency amen that a prophet of God
[1:23:05] that had 30 to 40 Visions a day and
[1:23:09] spoke to God in ways that most men will
[1:23:12] never would actually be so transparent
[1:23:16] as to say I developed a
[1:23:19] complex because the people would not
[1:23:21] receive
[1:23:23] me and if and I thank God for that
[1:23:26] because he's showing the humanity is our
[1:23:29] weakness and that every one of us can be
[1:23:32] that way every one of us and it can
[1:23:35] cause us to misstep and it isn't sinful
[1:23:38] desire it isn't like I want to sit on a
[1:23:41] bar stool or you want to sit on a bar
[1:23:43] but it it is our human weakness that the
[1:23:45] devil
[1:23:46] attacks and I thank God that he he
[1:23:49] showed us this because it shows that we
[1:23:53] must stay under the influence of the
[1:23:56] word coming to church is so
[1:23:59] important to stay under the influence of
[1:24:02] the word to listen to the message and
[1:24:05] not look at the crowd don't follow the
[1:24:07] crowd follow the word of
[1:24:09] God God how many would say Lord just
[1:24:12] keep me right on that narrow way and
[1:24:15] that is Jesus said that is my
[1:24:18] way sometimes you'll be misunderstood
[1:24:21] and you'll be rejected sometime you may
[1:24:23] not be pop
[1:24:24] but you'll find it's God's way which is
[1:24:27] the harder way do you love the Lord
[1:24:30] tonight everybody appreciate the word of
[1:24:32] the Lord let's just give the Lord a hand
[1:24:35] clap of
[1:24:36] Praise we thank the Lord for the
[1:24:39] message where would we
