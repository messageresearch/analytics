[48:28] morning just for us to remember uh to

[48:49] day she just said brother Paul it's just
[48:52] always pain I always don't feel good and
[48:56] we just need to lift her up in prayer
[48:58] let's count that our prayers for our
[49:01] sister as though we were the one in that
[49:04] situation amen often times we say well
[49:07] what about this and what about that what
[49:09] about if it was you amen let's remember
[49:12] her in prayer amen our brother Camden
[49:15] and uh brother Logan um not feeling well
[49:19] uh it is my understanding uh sometimes
[49:22] I'm probably a little slow on the uptake
[49:25] but I do believe that they are moving
[49:28] here or have moved here brother Logan is
[49:30] the younger brother he's already
[49:32] enrolled in cahi and uh so we just need
[49:36] to pray for them uh for their family uh

[49:59] think it's time I hopefully I don't
[50:01] embarrass anybody I'm I'm losing a
[50:04] little bit of my filter and that's bad
[50:06] but anyway let's start really lifting
[50:09] our sister ulia up in prayer uh the Lord
[50:13] blessed them with a beautiful little boy
[50:15] and we just want uh her to be strong uh
[50:19] and uh the Lord just keep her that
[50:20] strength until uh as I was reading
[50:23] scripture
[50:24] today h the scripture said as a a woman
[50:29] travaileth with child she's in sorrow
[50:33] but at the
[50:35] Deliverance she says thank you Lord for
[50:39] the
[50:39] man amen we just want to remember in
[50:43] prayer
[50:44] hallelujah amen brother basilia I had
[50:47] you on the prayer list but you're here
[50:48] so you're still on the prayer list God
[50:50] bless you amen hallelujah um I want to
[50:55] speak to you to today on a little time
[50:58] comes thank you musicians God bless you
[51:00] I love the song service this morning
[51:02] partly because uh it just seemed to go
[51:05] right together with with thoughts um you
[51:09] know just uh things that we are uh uh
[51:13] sometimes thinking and all of a sudden
[51:15] it comes together in a song service and
[51:18] you could almost say hey focus on the
[51:21] song service God bless you have a
[51:23] wonderful day amen
[51:27] I want to speak to you on the title Lord
[51:32] lift the curtain and uh this comes out
[51:35] of a message which we'll get to in a
[51:37] little bit let's turn to Revelations the
[51:40] 2
[51:42] chapter uh and the 11th verse we're
[51:46] actually going to take uh each one of
[51:49] these now the quote that we're going to
[51:51] use right off here I have uh ministered
[51:54] on that before but I just really felt
[51:58] led uh as the Lord just speaking to me
[52:02] uh last night just uh for us to uh
[52:07] remember the promises God has given us
[52:10] remember the blessings that he says he
[52:12] is already poured out now if it's
[52:16] already there remember how the prophet
[52:17] of God said our voice these voices
[52:20] George Washington's voice all these
[52:22] voices are still here now if God has
[52:24] spoke those promises it's up to us to
[52:28] reach out and take a hold of it the
[52:30] promise is right here we're not waiting
[52:32] for a promise to arrive from somewhere
[52:34] it's not ups and it's stuck somewhere
[52:37] out in the South China Sea but it's
[52:40] right here and it's up to you and I
[52:42] reach out take a hold of that promise
[52:47] you have need of it he's already
[52:49] promised it take a hold of that
[52:52] Revelations 211 now I'm going to jump
[52:55] down through these
[52:57] different verses in Revelation and I
[52:59] want to just expound uh on that
[53:02] thought verse 11 he that hath an ear let
[53:06] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[53:09] churches he that overcometh shall not be
[53:12] hurt of the second death and I'm going
[53:15] to let you be seated God bless the
[53:18] reading of the
[53:19] word amen now we know what the second
[53:23] death is my brother and sister and
[53:25] really the natural death death means
[53:27] nothing it is on a a a uh message uh
[53:32] little I don't know if you call it a
[53:34] chat thing or whatever that I'd been
[53:36] invited to here a few years ago and in
[53:38] the last while here there's been many
[53:40] brothers uh sisters uh elderly it is and
[53:44] some not so elderly that are passing
[53:46] away and so there they have come face to
[53:48] face to across the Great Divine that
[53:51] narrow sea that STS us into the presence
[53:54] of God but my brother and sister sister
[53:56] their passing in the natural really
[53:58] doesn't mean much uh it means a lot to
[54:01] us as family as close friends but when
[54:04] we look at this the real uh uh Crux of
[54:07] the whole thing is those who cross over
[54:10] with no relationship amen they are the
[54:14] lost they are there in that time and the
[54:17] second death has touched them because
[54:19] that's the death or separation from God
[54:22] and so we'll see in this time that we're
[54:24] living in that all of these scriptures
[54:26] that we're going to touch on briefly for
[54:28] a moment all of them and and maybe we
[54:32] can in in uh future uh uh flesh each one
[54:35] of these out but you'll see it is a
[54:37] cumulative effect that is coming these
[54:40] are not just Standalone scripture but
[54:42] these are God adding scripture line upon
[54:45] line adding it together coming down into
[54:47] our day and he starts right off here in
[54:51] verse 11 and he says they shall not be
[54:53] hurt of the second death in other words
[54:55] they will be no Eternal separation uh of
[54:59] them from God and so what a what a
[55:01] blessed promise my brother and sister
[55:03] that we can reach back uh talking a
[55:06] different Church age but we can reach
[55:08] back and say thank you today Lord that
[55:11] you have given us a security you have
[55:13] given us the promise that we will not
[55:16] face the second death or the separation
[55:18] from God that we will once sealed amen a
[55:23] Son of God Holy Ghost filled Son of God
[55:26] in their passing from natural life has
[55:29] no concern about his future he has no uh
[55:32] insecurity his family should not have
[55:34] any insecurity about that because we
[55:37] have already been sealed and once sealed
[55:40] Christ has come there is nothing of the
[55:42] life or the afterlife that would be able
[55:45] to unseal them and I say thank you Lord
[55:49] amen and so we can sit here today with a
[55:52] security this morning that we have no
[55:55] fear of the and death amen and so each
[55:59] age as we would look at these each age
[56:01] it defines the reward that would go with
[56:05] that age and as it comes down in this
[56:07] time like I said they're not just
[56:09] individual to an age and it no longer is
[56:11] relevant but these are Promises of God
[56:15] that have been given and they come
[56:17] together as you might say jewels that
[56:19] are being uh brought together
[56:21] Revelations 2 and7 we just move a few
[56:24] verses down he says there he that hath
[56:27] an ear let him hear what the spirit
[56:29] saith unto the churches to him that
[56:31] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[56:33] Hidden Mana brother Chris touched on
[56:35] this just the other day uh we'll give
[56:37] him a white stone in the stone a new
[56:39] name written which no man knoweth saving
[56:42] he that receive it so we find now that
[56:45] the Overcomer in that day is there and
[56:48] he is receiving now this hidden mana and
[56:51] it's a beautiful thing my brother and
[56:53] sister go study what brother brandham uh
[56:56] breaks down for us on the hidden Mana it
[56:58] is there something my brother and sister
[57:01] that by God's grace the man down the
[57:03] street now we don't stand here in
[57:05] arrogance to say this but the man down
[57:07] the street May read the same scripture
[57:10] you do all of his life and never see
[57:13] that hidden Mana amen so we ought to be
[57:16] thanking God every single day that our
[57:19] eyes have been open amen it's not just
[57:22] oh we see God sent a prophet many people
[57:25] have that Revelation but do not see the
[57:28] hidden Mana this is a blessing from God
[57:32] and we should be saying thank you Lord
[57:34] for every single blessing that he pours
[57:37] out upon us and so it's there and we
[57:41] won't take time to explain all this but
[57:43] he's got hidden Mana White Stone a new
[57:46] name and no man knows saving him that
[57:50] received it my brother and sister
[57:52] another person uh cannot come and
[57:55] understand what God's dealing in your
[57:57] heart you might not be living it like
[58:00] you should it might not be uh expressed
[58:02] it might not be uh uh open in Vision as
[58:05] it should be but there's something down
[58:08] inside there that is drawing that person
[58:10] drawing right out of the myy the song
[58:13] says he brought me out of the myy clay
[58:15] amen my brother and sister there still
[58:17] might be traces of clay upon that
[58:20] individual but it's God that's bringing
[58:22] them out and God said by my word I will
[58:25] wash them and until they are whiter than
[58:27] snow how white is that my brother and
[58:30] sister it's beautiful and that's how we
[58:33] should look at one another and that's
[58:34] how we should look at ourself according
[58:37] to the word because the minute you look
[58:39] at your flesh or the Flesh of another
[58:41] you'll see fault after fault after fault
[58:44] you'll see something that you could say
[58:46] well they my brother and sister let's
[58:48] look in the mirror of the word amen oh
[58:51] thank you Lord for the washing of the
[58:52] water of the word amen wash me again
[58:55] Lord amen and look at this now what he's
[58:58] saying unto them is is not so much my
[59:01] brother we'll get to it in a minute not
[59:03] so much about the Overcomer part because
[59:06] we can look at that and we'll say well
[59:08] are we Overcomers and some will say
[59:10] they're Overcomers but it doesn't appear
[59:11] to be but we're not going to focus we're
[59:13] going to take the prophet's word here in
[59:15] a minute and we're going to touch upon
[59:17] that now Revelations 2 and 26 he says
[59:20] there he that overcometh and keepeth my
[59:23] Works unto the end to him will I give
[59:26] power over the Nations so you can't have
[59:29] Revelation as it were and walk away from
[59:31] it and expect to receive the reward this
[59:34] is a race amen that we are taking as
[59:37] brother Craig preached amen the way we
[59:39] are taking the way all the way amen not
[59:43] stopping along the way but we're
[59:45] allowing the way to take us where we've
[59:47] been called to go amen we weren't called
[59:50] to just run for a season but we're
[59:52] called to run to the Finish amen
[59:56] Hallelujah and it can be
[59:58] laborious it can be a struggle we can
[1:00:00] feel tired we can feel weak we can feel
[1:00:03] forsaken but he said I will never
[1:00:06] forsake you so it's only the devil when
[1:00:08] we say I feel forsaken it's only the
[1:00:11] devil coming in a time of distress and
[1:00:14] whispering in our ear Satan using the
[1:00:17] time of distress but I'll tell you my
[1:00:19] brother and sister God also uses times
[1:00:22] of distress God allows us to come into
[1:00:24] times that we do feel forsaken that we
[1:00:27] do feel lonely we do feel weary we do
[1:00:32] feel and God says I'm doing this I'm
[1:00:34] allowing this to happen because you need
[1:00:37] to break through you need to come to a
[1:00:40] place that you realize there's a deeper
[1:00:42] depth and a higher high than you've ever
[1:00:45] experienced but if you're complacent and
[1:00:47] you settle for that and say well praise
[1:00:50] God this is just what it is to be a
[1:00:52] Christian just to feel defeated just to
[1:00:55] feel all these things no God wants you
[1:00:57] to know Victory and it's not always a
[1:01:00] victory my brother and sister I'll get
[1:01:02] ahead of myself I'm sorry it's not
[1:01:04] always a victory over some great thing
[1:01:07] out here but my brother and sister
[1:01:09] sometimes it's victory over
[1:01:11] self amen we already know that our self
[1:01:14] is our greatest enemy we already know
[1:01:17] that our self is our hindrance oh this
[1:01:20] brother he he's hindering me no it's not
[1:01:23] if you come prayed up and you you're
[1:01:26] hearing the preaching of the word
[1:01:28] nothing will hinder you amen it will be
[1:01:31] God's lip to your ear and you'll walk
[1:01:33] out hearing maybe something no one else
[1:01:36] in the church heard and that was because
[1:01:39] God came to speak to you
[1:01:42] amen that's
[1:01:46] right amen amen just give me the
[1:01:51] word amen doesn't have to be profound
[1:01:56] and definitely we don't want it watered
[1:01:59] down just give me the word I would sing
[1:02:02] that right now if I could sing amen that
[1:02:04] just strikes my heart amen just give me
[1:02:06] the word that's all I need amen amen it
[1:02:10] doesn't have to be you know the prophet
[1:02:12] of God I I just I I I won't go into all
[1:02:15] the things because then I'll start
[1:02:16] preaching down that vein but the prophet
[1:02:17] of God talking about what God's got he
[1:02:19] said if he wants me to go to Africa and
[1:02:22] preach to thousands he'll provide the
[1:02:24] money if he wants me to go over here to
[1:02:27] some little spot over here and preach to
[1:02:30] 10 people he will provide amen but we
[1:02:34] get in programs and we get like we need
[1:02:36] to do this and we need to do that what
[1:02:38] we need to do is take God at his
[1:02:41] word
[1:02:42] [Music]
[1:02:44] hallelujah hallelujah somebody tell me
[1:02:46] where was
[1:02:49] I did we touch verse
[1:02:52] 26 okay okay sorry I'm in a tizzy
[1:02:57] Revelation 3:5 he said he that
[1:02:59] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[1:03:01] white rment see a direct connection
[1:03:04] between the Overcomer and how he's
[1:03:07] clothed come on we ought to think about
[1:03:09] it Saints we don't look like Le oia amen
[1:03:13] we we are not a representation of Cl of
[1:03:16] Le oysa amen the Overcomer will be
[1:03:19] dressed according to the word amen be
[1:03:21] clothed in white rment and I will not
[1:03:23] blot out his name out of the book of
[1:03:26] life but I will confess his name before
[1:03:28] my father and before the angels I want
[1:03:31] to tell you Saints there's some
[1:03:32] Believers this morning is there any
[1:03:34] believers here there's some Believers
[1:03:36] this morning whose name are be confessed
[1:03:40] before the father right at this very
[1:03:42] moment can someone say thank you Lord
[1:03:46] hallelujah that my name your name is
[1:03:49] being confessed even as we sit here
[1:03:52] sometimes struggling with the things of
[1:03:53] life and what decisions to make and
[1:03:56] whatever we're struggling and at that
[1:03:58] moment Satan's trying to say look you're
[1:04:00] defeated give up stop now and your name
[1:04:03] is being confessed before the father at
[1:04:05] that very moment oh that ought to make
[1:04:08] somebody kind of happy amen it ought to
[1:04:11] make us realize that God's plan is so
[1:04:14] perfect he's got the provision already
[1:04:17] in
[1:04:18] place Hallelujah God's not like now who
[1:04:20] was this you were talking about Amen
[1:04:24] brother Trevor
[1:04:26] yeah it's brother Trevor I know brother
[1:04:30] Trevor and that might scare us
[1:04:34] sometimes but when it scares us we
[1:04:37] should stop that and rejoice and say he
[1:04:41] knows my
[1:04:42] name amen he knows my
[1:04:46] name I'm not a
[1:04:48] stranger I'm his lamb I'm his sheep and
[1:04:51] He Knows My
[1:04:53] Name Hallelujah
[1:04:57] I like that sir now if our name would be
[1:04:59] confessed before God then imagine what
[1:05:02] it would be if our brothers and sisters
[1:05:03] are confessing us before God also am and
[1:05:06] we are lifting up
[1:05:08] Faithfully
[1:05:10] hallelujah
[1:05:12] amen now I think we come right down to
[1:05:20] here man I'm just in a tizzy this
[1:05:23] morning my mind is just going
[1:05:29] Hallelujah forgive
[1:05:32] me him that overcometh what I make a
[1:05:34] pillar in the temple of my God Amen
[1:05:40] Hallelujah do you know a pillar is a
[1:05:45] permanent
[1:05:47] part
[1:05:52] amen we might not grasp eternity but
[1:05:55] I'll tell you if I'm a pillar in his
[1:05:57] house in his his kingdom I in his Temple
[1:06:00] if I'm a pillar there amen as long as
[1:06:03] there is a house of God I'm part of
[1:06:07] it Hallelujah God's not going to come
[1:06:09] and say well the roof will fall in but
[1:06:11] I'm removing this pillar no he's placed
[1:06:15] that as the master builder that's right
[1:06:17] placed it in exactly the right spot you
[1:06:20] realize this morning you have been
[1:06:22] placed in exactly the right spot today
[1:06:25] cuz God has placed you right where he
[1:06:26] want to bless you right where he wants
[1:06:28] to use you right where he wants to
[1:06:31] manifest or magnify himself in your
[1:06:33] presence he's put you right there so
[1:06:35] that he can do that amen not a reference
[1:06:38] of someone that was somewhere one time
[1:06:40] once upon a time but he can point right
[1:06:43] there in his Temple amen right in his
[1:06:47] house he can say this is who it is this
[1:06:51] is my son this is my daughter and
[1:06:53] they're doing exactly what I called them
[1:06:55] to
[1:06:56] Lord never to go away Eternal in the
[1:07:00] heavens
[1:07:02] my my oh my and he shall go out no more
[1:07:06] out and I will write upon him the name
[1:07:09] of my God and the name of the city of my
[1:07:12] God which is the New Jerusalem which
[1:07:14] cometh down out of Heaven from my God
[1:07:17] and I will write upon him my new name
[1:07:21] amen I'm gonna just put this out in
[1:07:23] simplicity so don't don't you know say
[1:07:26] whoa whoa just a second but I'll tell
[1:07:28] you what the Simplicity of the new name
[1:07:30] is Mrs Jesus
[1:07:32] Christ that is ownership amen now we
[1:07:35] live in a day of feminism and and not to
[1:07:38] pick on any sisters or whatever but
[1:07:40] right we're living in a day that the
[1:07:42] word of God said that the women would
[1:07:44] rise up and the men would become more
[1:07:46] effeminate and and less ability to make
[1:07:49] hard decisions and and the women would
[1:07:51] rise up to that position my brother and
[1:07:53] sister and when we come and we take the
[1:07:56] name of Mrs Jesus Christ that is a sign
[1:08:00] of complete surrender and a complete
[1:08:03] ownership now I'm not going to sit here
[1:08:05] and go into all the things about the
[1:08:07] spirit of the age what I do know is I
[1:08:10] want to be identified as the Lamb's wife
[1:08:13] I want to be identified as part of that
[1:08:16] body amen where he comes and says I give
[1:08:19] you my name Hallelujah the wife
[1:08:24] shouldn't have to come and say and look
[1:08:26] I I I'm gonna Force
[1:08:28] you I'm GNA Force you in public to give
[1:08:31] me your name no my brother and sister
[1:08:34] now take put your spiritual cap on when
[1:08:37] you think about that amen amen what has
[1:08:39] happened Christ is outside the church
[1:08:42] how can he give his name to those on the
[1:08:44] inside when there's never been a
[1:08:47] relationship a connection never been a
[1:08:50] consummation there's never been my
[1:08:53] brother and sister he can't give a name
[1:08:54] to something he has hasn't claimed and
[1:08:57] won't claim
[1:08:59] him so you see how God is working he's
[1:09:02] coming down in every one of these ages
[1:09:06] every one of these he's saying the
[1:09:08] Overcomer and he's placing this what
[1:09:10] he's doing my brother and sister is not
[1:09:12] throwing out something the idea of well
[1:09:14] if you can overcome you overcome maybe
[1:09:17] you can overcome a sin maybe you can
[1:09:19] overcome an unbelief maybe you can
[1:09:21] overcome the prophet deals just a little
[1:09:23] bit different with this my brother and
[1:09:24] sister and I think that we ought to get
[1:09:26] this anchored in our heart to understand
[1:09:29] that while overcoming sin is part of the
[1:09:32] equation right God gives us Grace amen
[1:09:34] whatever that thing might be that was in
[1:09:36] your life God gives us grace and mercy
[1:09:40] to come by Revelation and put that
[1:09:43] behind us as the scripture says we're
[1:09:45] going to put our foot on it amen we're
[1:09:47] not going to let that thing Trail along
[1:09:49] behind us forever that God allows us to
[1:09:51] bring a finality to that but there's
[1:09:53] still more to be an overcome
[1:09:56] amen there's still more to that amen and
[1:09:59] he says here that uh in Revelation
[1:10:03] 3:21 to him that overcometh will I grant
[1:10:06] to sit with me here's culmination Saints
[1:10:09] amen I want you to look at this not just
[1:10:11] as the seventh age or whatever it would
[1:10:13] be but this is a culmination of the plan
[1:10:17] of God being brought right down in front
[1:10:19] of us he says uh to him that overcometh
[1:10:22] will I grant to sit with me
[1:10:26] in
[1:10:27] my Throne amen not next to it not on top
[1:10:34] of
[1:10:35] it in it that's right that's right amen
[1:10:39] the only way you get in the throne my
[1:10:41] brother and sisters become one with the
[1:10:43] word and when we become one with the
[1:10:46] word we're in the throne amen amen now
[1:10:48] that can be where people say well I have
[1:10:50] this Revelation I'm one with the word
[1:10:52] I'm talking about Jesus view of it
[1:10:53] Christ's view God's view whatever you
[1:10:55] want to do the Lord's view uh when the
[1:10:57] Lord views and says they're one with me
[1:11:00] we're one amen man can say anything he
[1:11:02] wants he can declare it in any fashion
[1:11:04] that he wants I've had the Holy Ghost
[1:11:06] for 50 years and I just listen to
[1:11:08] brother Brown say this a couple days ago
[1:11:10] he said there I've got I've got had the
[1:11:12] Holy Ghost for all this time and a got
[1:11:13] temper to fight
[1:11:16] AA that's right it's not what you say
[1:11:20] that's right and this kind of pinches a
[1:11:22] little bit okay I just want to be honest
[1:11:24] this pinches a little bit
[1:11:26] it's what we
[1:11:28] do we can say anything we want to
[1:11:48] say I want to sit down with my father
[1:11:51] and his
[1:11:53] throne that's a heart's desire
[1:11:56] amen
[1:11:57] failures
[1:11:59] shortcomings get stressed out get upset
[1:12:03] easy anybody help me with that
[1:12:08] list but you see God said I've already
[1:12:12] finished the work in
[1:12:15] you we're we're you know what is it they
[1:12:18] built some kind of spaceship and it's
[1:12:19] floating around in space right now and
[1:12:21] they're afraid to bring it
[1:12:23] home right do any of you know I'm
[1:12:25] talking about I can't remember who
[1:12:26] actually built that but they sent some
[1:12:29] spaceship up to the the space permanent
[1:12:32] space station and it's got a flaw
[1:12:34] they're afraid to fly at home they're
[1:12:36] thinking about trying to make it remote
[1:12:38] fly home my brother and
[1:12:41] sister we're that space station we're
[1:12:44] that rocket ship we got
[1:12:48] flaws and sometimes we're
[1:12:52] afraid but God said you're are finished
[1:12:54] work amen
[1:12:57] amen we're finished work we shouldn't be
[1:13:00] afraid to stand up today any one of us
[1:13:02] right here in this building regardless
[1:13:04] of what last week happened in your life
[1:13:07] you should be able to stand up this
[1:13:08] morning and say I am a Son of God I am a
[1:13:12] daughter of God and I possess every
[1:13:14] promise of God because God said
[1:13:19] amen thank you Lord I have a
[1:13:22] flaw I acknowledge I have a flaw
[1:13:27] and I pray about that flaw a lot because
[1:13:29] that flaw don't don't take me too
[1:13:32] serious in the sense of like that I I'm
[1:13:34] standing here God but don't ask Jerry
[1:13:40] either but he didn't say ask anything in
[1:13:44] my name if you don't have a
[1:13:49] flaw that's
[1:13:51] right you think God don't know your flaw
[1:13:55] actually he's burning it out of you slow
[1:13:57] but
[1:13:58] sure can someone say thank you Lord burn
[1:14:02] it out of me Lord I don't like the pain
[1:14:05] I don't like the suffering I don't like
[1:14:06] the trial but burn it out of me Lord yes
[1:14:11] amen
[1:14:14] amen now look at our
[1:14:17] age this all come
[1:14:20] down to a promise that the Overcomer of
[1:14:23] this day about to sit with him in his
[1:14:25] throne amen now I'm just going to make a
[1:14:28] a loose connection here so please bear
[1:14:31] with
[1:14:34] me get to sit with
[1:14:37] him in his throne
[1:14:41] amen not outside of it not to the right
[1:14:44] of it not to the left of it but we've
[1:14:47] been granted a privilege to sit with him
[1:14:50] in his
[1:14:51] throne in the beginning was the word and
[1:14:54] the word word was with
[1:14:56] God Amen and the Word was made
[1:15:01] flesh and we have beheld him
[1:15:06] amen go home look in a mirror behold
[1:15:11] Christ that seems like a long step but
[1:15:14] it's the
[1:15:15] truth Christ in you the hope of
[1:15:18] glory let that come out let's release it
[1:15:23] amen now look at this my brother and
[1:15:24] sister look at this common theme every
[1:15:27] age there's a thread that carries
[1:15:28] through a connection that carries to the
[1:15:30] next age brother Chris brought this out
[1:15:33] and uh uh uh I think this last Wednesday
[1:15:36] or Wednesday before that or I don't
[1:15:38] remember I think I was here so it have
[1:15:40] been two Wednesdays ago but you see
[1:15:43] every age I had just been reading that
[1:15:45] brother Chris and every age wants to
[1:15:48] look at the next age and say there
[1:15:51] that's wrong you guys are going
[1:15:53] somewhere out in the bushes you you're
[1:15:55] no no no no that's what they thought
[1:15:58] amen Luther Wesley every one of these
[1:16:01] age looking at what were God's moving on
[1:16:03] and the problem with that my brother and
[1:16:05] sister or their problem with that is
[1:16:07] that because they the prophet showed us
[1:16:10] how they came to a halt they went just
[1:16:12] so far and they come to us and they
[1:16:14] built something around that and then God
[1:16:16] moved on and then they started saying no
[1:16:18] we had the fire we had the fire you guys
[1:16:20] are wrong but you see every age it's
[1:16:23] going and we know this I'm not preaching
[1:16:25] nothing new to you amen now it comes
[1:16:27] down that we are in an age or the End of
[1:16:30] the Age we could get like all kinds of
[1:16:32] shuffling around on that but we come
[1:16:34] down to the end of the age and it's
[1:16:35] going to be a bride age and that means
[1:16:38] those that were in the leoan age are
[1:16:40] going to look at the bride and they're
[1:16:42] going to tell her who do you think you
[1:16:44] are saying that you have the bridegroom
[1:16:47] we had the bridegroom he's our
[1:16:49] bridegroom we built great big Shrine
[1:16:51] churches around the fact we had the
[1:16:53] bridegroom and you're telling me that
[1:16:55] because you an orphan are you with me
[1:16:58] amen that little story about the
[1:17:00] Cattleman son and all that such a cute
[1:17:03] little story that's the word unfailed my
[1:17:05] brother and sister because you're an
[1:17:07] orphan from denomination you're an
[1:17:10] orphan from the cares of this life an
[1:17:12] orphan from the control of Satan my
[1:17:15] chains are broken and we are there and
[1:17:18] they're saying no you're wrong who do
[1:17:19] you think you
[1:17:20] are who do you think you are still when
[1:17:24] the Chariot
[1:17:26] wagon whatever Buckboard drove up you
[1:17:30] didn't see that young man get out and go
[1:17:33] in the house and say you know I feel bad
[1:17:35] that I'm taking her and not you so why
[1:17:38] don't you come
[1:17:42] on he got out said there's only one here
[1:17:48] that I have come to
[1:17:50] redeem there's only one sounds very very
[1:17:53] aggressive passive
[1:17:55] aggressive all the rest of you nice
[1:17:58] girls you look like Le oia but you're
[1:18:01] nice you've met them the nicest of
[1:18:08] people but
[1:18:11] one and she didn't have a whole lot of
[1:18:15] baggage come
[1:18:16] on broaden the thinking please amen she
[1:18:20] wasn't bringing the bed she'd slept on
[1:18:22] and she wasn't bringing the cute little
[1:18:24] Chester drawers and she wasn't going to
[1:18:26] bring this and that no she knew what she
[1:18:28] needed and she was dressed for the
[1:18:31] occasion and that's all that went with
[1:18:33] her was those things that had changed
[1:18:36] her
[1:18:37] life the
[1:18:39] word his word that's what she took with
[1:18:43] her amen see so look at this this common
[1:18:47] theme uh connection to every age carries
[1:18:49] to the next age and you see I I kind of
[1:18:52] touch this got ahead of myself it's not
[1:18:54] just a victory over a certain sin and
[1:18:57] and we don't need to do that because my
[1:18:58] brother and sister every sin has no
[1:19:01] greater or uh no diminished value Sin is
[1:19:05] Sin amen and we can sit here and not
[1:19:07] believe the word and be just as Mark
[1:19:10] just a black mark on us just like the
[1:19:12] guy out here that's going to smoke a
[1:19:14] pack of cigarettes today and and drink a
[1:19:16] case of beer because it's Sunday we can
[1:19:18] be in unbelief and be no different in
[1:19:21] our position than that man right there
[1:19:23] so God help us us from having a
[1:19:25] condescending Spirit around us my
[1:19:27] brother and sister one pulling back from
[1:19:30] the word of God it's God's grace that
[1:19:32] pulls us right back amen it's God's
[1:19:35] mercy that pulls us amen so it's not
[1:19:37] just a victory over a certain sin
[1:19:39] although God will give us Authority and
[1:19:43] uh uh his power coming down in our life
[1:19:46] and the authority to take that word and
[1:19:48] put besetting sins behind us amen Can
[1:19:51] someone say Amen to that amen put those
[1:19:54] things behind this it might be
[1:19:56] impatience wait is that a sin it can
[1:20:00] be did you know that not trusting is a
[1:20:03] sin
[1:20:06] amen the prophet of God loved the song
[1:20:09] only believe and he believed it and
[1:20:11] saying it my brother and sister because
[1:20:12] he knew the power of that if we can
[1:20:14] bring yourself forgetting about what
[1:20:17] your flesh that's right looks like
[1:20:20] believe and God will change you
[1:20:25] that makes me
[1:20:29] excited every age had a greater
[1:20:31] expression of God's plan we see that
[1:20:32] through the church age book do you
[1:20:34] realize how blessed we are some people
[1:20:37] in the message don't even believe in the
[1:20:38] church age
[1:20:39] book they they don't even
[1:20:42] acknowledge but I'm glad it's there
[1:20:44] because I can look and see now now you
[1:20:47] can look at this and and and see how
[1:20:49] this is our savings account spiritual
[1:20:52] savings account we get to go back in
[1:20:54] history they lived
[1:20:56] it just like they don't know what Le is
[1:20:59] cuz we're living
[1:21:00] it but the piggy bank as it were God
[1:21:04] tucking it in now we get to come in here
[1:21:06] and go okay I see how God started this I
[1:21:09] see how he's doing this I see what he's
[1:21:11] done in our day and it clicks anybody
[1:21:15] have a click thank you Lord don't
[1:21:18] normally endorse clicks but um uh that's
[1:21:21] a click that you want to get is when
[1:21:23] that hey amen now see every age a
[1:21:26] greater
[1:21:27] expression now I want to know I'm
[1:21:29] speaking to Paul so nobody get offended
[1:21:31] what are we doing with the greater
[1:21:33] expression are we sitting back and
[1:21:35] saying God sent a
[1:21:37] prophet a bookcase full of
[1:21:41] message it ought to have an impact on
[1:21:44] our
[1:21:45] life it ought to be something whether
[1:21:48] you're talking about you know a a book a
[1:21:51] a cassette or a real toore let's get
[1:21:54] them all in there a a book a real toore
[1:21:57] uh real to real was before the book okay
[1:22:00] we got to get in the right order real
[1:22:01] toore a book a a
[1:22:05] cassette
[1:22:09] uh M
[1:22:11] MP3
[1:22:13] CD Now thumb
[1:22:16] drive and brother
[1:22:18] pant told me brother
[1:22:21] Paul let me explain this to you
[1:22:25] brother pant you're listening I say this
[1:22:28] in
[1:22:29] love brother Paul I don't know if you'll
[1:22:31] get this or
[1:22:33] not but what I do is
[1:22:35] like write the dictionary on the end of
[1:22:39] a grain of
[1:22:42] sand you're right brother Pon I don't
[1:22:44] get
[1:22:48] it you follow the
[1:22:51] correlation it's come right down
[1:22:55] the impact of the message is
[1:22:58] greater but the volume of the book is no
[1:23:03] longer
[1:23:04] external as in all the writings and the
[1:23:07] teachings because he said I'm going to
[1:23:10] write it on your
[1:23:14] heart Hallelujah we don't have to have
[1:23:17] all these vast volumes I don't need to
[1:23:20] go read all the writings of all of the
[1:23:23] Great Men through the AG is coming right
[1:23:25] on down I have it now and God has come
[1:23:28] can someone please say Amen it's been
[1:23:31] rot on our heart today and it's there we
[1:23:34] going to take it everywhere we go and we
[1:23:36] won't forget it amen because it's been
[1:23:39] etched into our life and that's nothing
[1:23:42] but God himself come right down in that
[1:23:44] little bitty spot that's in your heart
[1:23:47] and wrote his word and placed it in
[1:23:49] there in the volume of the book amen
[1:23:53] it's become so real to to us oh my
[1:23:57] Hallelujah see we're in a greater
[1:23:59] expression this this might be a little
[1:24:01] boastful to some but we right now even
[1:24:03] in the Apostle Paul we are a greater
[1:24:07] expression of the
[1:24:09] word than ever been in any age because
[1:24:13] there was things in the word that
[1:24:16] brother
[1:24:19] John never saw
[1:24:24] that brother Paul never saw
[1:24:30] that's and there is no greater
[1:24:33] privilege than to be allowed to see
[1:24:36] it and live it amen that's that's when
[1:24:41] the word preached comes to life when we
[1:24:45] as Sons and Daughters of God have been
[1:24:47] granted a glorious privilege to live it
[1:24:50] amen amen God's not just saying I'll
[1:24:53] preach it and hopefully something comes
[1:24:55] with it God says I've got a chosen
[1:24:57] people amen that were called and chosen
[1:25:00] to be the ones to live out the
[1:25:06] Revelation and then I ask you is it
[1:25:09] easy the flesh says
[1:25:13] no but the soul says
[1:25:17] yes hallelujah
[1:25:20] amen how can I overcome let's go into to
[1:25:34] that I tell you
[1:25:36] what if you ever want to see time fly
[1:25:39] just have a
[1:25:40] sermon
[1:25:44] yeah now I'm not getting along very good
[1:25:46] so I got to speed this
[1:25:49] up
[1:25:51] overcome we get an idea that it's got to
[1:25:53] get this be setting sin behind me I want
[1:25:56] you to read what the prophet of God said
[1:25:58] amen overcome means to recognize the
[1:26:01] devil in every one of his tricks lots of
[1:26:04] people says there's no devil it's just a
[1:26:06] thought don't you believe that there's a
[1:26:08] real devil he's just as real as you are
[1:26:11] or anybody a real devil and you must
[1:26:13] recognize him real you must know he's a
[1:26:16] devil then the same time that you
[1:26:19] recognize him and know he's a devil and
[1:26:21] he's against you then to overcome you
[1:26:24] must recognize that the god in you is
[1:26:27] greater and mightier than he is that the
[1:26:30] one that's in you has already overcome
[1:26:33] him we can stand here and say praise God
[1:26:36] I'm an overcomer but my brother and

[1:34:01] minutes now
[1:34:04] listen talk about how God
[1:34:06] works look at the woman at the well for
[1:34:08] just a few
[1:34:10] minutes the woman at the well is there
[1:34:12] she's drawing
[1:34:14] water and here's Jesus he starts to deal
[1:34:18] with
[1:34:20] her had five wives
[1:34:25] and a husband I mean Five
[1:34:28] Wives wow I'm slipping maybe it's time
[1:34:30] to
[1:34:35] quit she she was she was there and when
[1:34:39] Jesus starts to deal with her she
[1:34:42] doesn't say that's that's wrong or
[1:34:44] that's not she knew the
[1:34:47] word she knew the prophecy for the
[1:34:51] day she knew this
[1:34:54] but it didn't change her
[1:34:56] life she was in that
[1:35:00] position and she recognized when Jesus
[1:35:03] spoke and said ah we know this is what
[1:35:06] we've been taught didn't change her life
[1:35:08] she'd been taught a lot didn't impact
[1:35:11] her
[1:35:12] life you see teaching is not going to do
[1:35:15] it it takes a living word amen and if
[1:35:19] it's not a living word you can teach the
[1:35:21] fire out of it it won't make one drop a
[1:35:24] difference right amen hallelujah so here
[1:35:28] she knew the scripture but it didn't
[1:35:30] change her but what happened is is Jesus
[1:35:33] starts to deal with her and she
[1:35:36] recognized how Satan had tricked her she
[1:35:41] realized this is what Satan's done he's
[1:35:43] pulled the wool over my eyes and the
[1:35:46] whole time the very thing I desired was
[1:35:48] not to be found in another man another
[1:35:51] relationship it was to be found in
[1:35:54] Christ and it was such a real Revelation
[1:35:56] that hit her why because it was a living
[1:35:59] word that she come in contact with not a
[1:36:02] dead letter some people have a stroke
[1:36:05] around the message if you said this
[1:36:07] message is a dead letter but I'll tell
[1:36:09] you my brother and sister you could go
[1:36:10] to bed every night with books piled on
[1:36:12] you and it won't change your life it's
[1:36:15] going to come off the page it's going to
[1:36:17] come into the heart it's got to come
[1:36:19] down into the soul and it's got to not
[1:36:21] just touch the soul amen that's that
[1:36:23] just anointing that's there but doesn't
[1:36:25] change them it's got to embed itself
[1:36:28] right amen a pregnancy requires a seed
[1:36:31] to be embedded amen and when it's
[1:36:34] embedded in there amen the prophet of
[1:36:36] God says nothing can take that away
[1:36:40] Hallelujah and so why she recognized by
[1:36:43] Revelation that this was the word
[1:36:46] speaking to me and goes into the City
[1:36:49] and says hey everybody there's one who
[1:36:53] told me the word amen told me who I am
[1:36:57] he didn't say called me a
[1:37:00] prostitute she said he told me who I
[1:37:03] am oh thank you
[1:37:05] Lord thank you

[1:37:13] age for the
[1:37:15] individual come on are you with me today

[1:37:26] revealed because of who you are amen who
[1:37:30] God called you to be is why the word was
[1:37:33] revealed and that's why you can believe
[1:37:36] it now let's let me hurry here because
