[37:32] heart and I want to just kind of bring
[37:36] out to you a little bit of how I come to
[37:39] this and we'll find that this scripture
[37:42] sure here parallels amen
[37:46] Hebrews 10 which was our Bible study
[37:48] this last Sunday evening and I want to
[37:52] take my title tonight
[37:54] in this journey aren't aren't you glad
[37:57] we're on this journey I I thank the Lord
[37:59] that that he's allowed us to have this
[38:02] journey now if if a journey was all
[38:04] disaster in all struggles and there was
[38:07] no hope at the end then we would be like
[38:09] the world
[38:11] but God has brought us out amen as the
[38:14] scripture we'll share with us in just a
[38:16] moment he has took us from the myri pit
[38:19] and he has set our feet on the solid
[38:22] rock and that alone right there brings
[38:25] us in a position while life is not
[38:27] always easy it has set us up and apart
[38:31] from the spirit of laodicea now remember
[38:34] all of this that is happening around us
[38:36] is fueled by a spirit
[38:39] amen so the devil doesn't have to show
[38:41] up and literally knock on your door if
[38:44] he can anoint us to decide that it's all
[38:48] for naught our own self then Satan just
[38:50] sets back and watches us self-destruct
[38:53] but God in his grace and mercy comes you
[38:56] know uh you know the three little pigs
[38:59] and the Wolf my brother and sister if
[39:01] those three little pigs had had the Holy
[39:03] Ghost they'd rebuked that devil and they
[39:06] would have sent him away from their
[39:08] house but what they did is they looked
[39:11] to themselves and said hmm how are we
[39:14] going to deal with the wolf and found
[39:16] out they couldn't
[39:17] amen and so I'm sorry to throw a little
[39:20] three little pigs into the sermon
[39:22] tonight but when we look to ourself we
[39:26] can expect for our house to get blown
[39:28] down but when we look to Christ amen
[39:30] he's the solid rock and we are anchored
[39:33] in him and the devil can huff and puff
[39:36] all he wants and he will not accomplish
[39:39] his goal amen so I want to speak to you
[39:43] tonight taking the title from the
[39:45] scripture tonight in the volume of the
[39:48] book amen
[39:49] Psalm the 40th chapter verses one
[39:52] through eight
[39:54] I waited patiently for the Lord
[39:59] and he inclined unto me and heard My Cry
[40:05] he brought me up also out of a horrible
[40:08] pit
[40:09] out of the myri clay
[40:12] and set my feet upon a rock
[40:14] and established my goings can we say
[40:18] Amen
[40:19] he had put a new song in my mouth even
[40:23] praising to our god many shall see it
[40:26] and fear and shall trust in the Lord
[40:30] hmm I want to preach blessed is the man
[40:33] that maketh the Lord his trust and
[40:36] respecteth not the proud nor such as
[40:39] turn aside to lies many O Lord my God
[40:43] are thy wonderful Works which now has
[40:47] done and thy thoughts which are to us
[40:50] word they cannot be reckoned up in order
[40:53] unto thee if I could declare and speak
[40:56] of them there are more than can be
[41:00] numbered he's talking about you bride
[41:03] amen if we could have ever kept a list
[41:07] in our life and even knew the half of
[41:10] what God is doing on our behalf we would
[41:14] be we would have to become uh what did
[41:17] they call them the right for a living
[41:19] um um scribe we'd have to become scribes
[41:22] because we would day by day be just
[41:25] writing and writing of the glory and the
[41:27] blessings and all of the things that God
[41:30] is doing for us and amen amen sacrifice
[41:35] and offering thou didst not desire mine
[41:38] ears hath thou opened I'm going to say
[41:40] Amen to that Hallelujah that right there
[41:43] is more incredible than one can even
[41:46] imagine that we can hear
[41:51] um
[41:52] burned offering and sin offering hath
[41:54] thou not required then said I lo I come
[41:59] in the volume of the book it is written
[42:02] of me I Delight to do thy will o my God
[42:07] yea thy law is
[42:12] not even just written on
[42:16] when God wrote it in our life
[42:19] he didn't just put it superficial
[42:23] he made it who we are
[42:29] if it was on the surface it could be
[42:31] wiped or washed away but when it come
[42:34] thy law is within my heart
[42:39] oh Lord we thank you tonight I just ask
[42:42] you to bless this service father Lord
[42:44] your presence here already I think we
[42:47] could almost close our Bibles sing
[42:49] another song and go home and be able to
[42:51] say we met with you tonight Lord father
[42:54] just bless this time I pray together all
[42:57] of the prayer requests Lord those stated
[42:59] those not stated or remembered father
[43:01] you know we're just human but ask you
[43:04] Lord to just deal with each one deal
[43:06] kindly we pray in the name of Jesus
[43:09] Christ amen hallelujah you may be seated
[43:14] amen you know there's sometimes
[43:16] uh that that God just lay something on
[43:19] your heart and it is tonight's Saints to
[43:24] me just a real joy and if God will bless
[43:27] this I'll be able to speak it with the
[43:29] feeling that I felt in looking into this
[43:31] that just something that was there and
[43:34] as I read this in Psalms 40. uh it is
[43:39] the connection come from our Bible study
[43:41] uh there in uh Hebrews 10 and we'll look
[43:45] at this my brother and sister how it is
[43:48] that God has given to you and I as we
[43:50] read this scripture it is we can feel
[43:53] the heart cry our own Hearts cry we can
[43:57] feel that there's something in US
[43:59] compelling us to respond amen we're not
[44:03] the kind of Believers that just sit back
[44:05] and say uh who are you or what are we I
[44:08] belong to this church no my brother and
[44:10] sister I belong to Jesus Christ amen the
[44:13] building just happens to be our shelter
[44:16] in a natural world Amen it is not our
[44:19] refuge Christ is our refuge amen and so
[44:23] this heart's Cry of every believer some
[44:26] are more vocal some not so much etc etc
[44:28] but my brother and sister I believe
[44:30] tonight as we read Psalm 40 these verses
[44:33] as it goes on just a whole Beautiful
[44:35] chapter but we can say this is my
[44:38] testimony this is this is my heart's cry
[44:41] this is what is being pulled out of me
[44:44] is compelling me to be who I am is
[44:47] because I can recognize as David is here
[44:51] and writing and talking about these
[44:53] things that we can recognize this this
[44:56] is a same God now isn't that awesome
[44:59] tonight amen there's nothing like a
[45:02] sense of belonging amen we as humans
[45:05] were meant to have a sense of belonging
[45:09] and it is there in the sense of
[45:11] belonging it's not just that there are
[45:14] some people you know a conversation I
[45:16] had recently the so you know somebody
[45:19] makes a statement so there's like more
[45:21] people like you than just you oh don't
[45:25] you even know amen the Bible says that
[45:29] they are as the sand of the seashore
[45:32] amen this body of Believers oh let me
[45:36] tell you but something inside of me says
[45:38] they're not ready for a cannon blast
[45:41] they're just you know wondering is there
[45:43] a few more people like you oh let me
[45:46] tell you there's a few more people like
[45:48] us they're called The Bride amen and
[45:51] God's the only one that has numbered
[45:53] them amen no man can identify no man can
[45:57] make the list it's God and God Alone
[46:00] amen and I say thank you Lord Jesus amen
[46:03] so it's here that we see this heart's
[46:06] cry moving the Believers the bride of
[46:08] Christ and the hour we're living in you
[46:11] know my brother and sister I won't go in
[46:13] there because I don't want to be
[46:14] depressed and I'd probably be the first
[46:15] one but if you just ever follow the
[46:18] headlines I go on the computer usually
[46:21] every morning for just a brief moment so
[46:25] that I'm not too happy during the day
[46:29] and everything there is very rarely
[46:34] anything that even pops up in the news
[46:38] that you would say oh that's wonderful
[46:41] a little girl lost in a national forest
[46:44] somewhere eight days comes out alive you
[46:47] know well praise the Lord you know the
[46:49] little girl I mean uh you know a lot of
[46:51] adults wouldn't have survived out there
[46:52] and hear this little girl survives I'm
[46:55] sure she had some bumps and bruises and
[46:57] scrapes and dehydration and all of these
[46:59] kind of things but you know it does your
[47:01] heart good well wonderful things still
[47:03] happen but you know our government's
[47:06] falling apart our nation's falling apart
[47:08] the world's falling apart I'll stop
[47:10] right there amen but what is happening
[47:13] the bride day by day is being
[47:16] strengthened she is in the word and the
[47:19] word is strengthening her and she's not
[47:22] relying upon herself she's not saying
[47:25] look me as a Christian look how strong I
[47:28] am but it's quite the opposite she's
[47:30] saying you know what the farther I've
[47:32] got down this road the more dependent I
[47:35] have become and I'm going to become so
[47:38] dependent that I'm going to be so close
[47:40] to Christ that you you won't even be
[47:42] able to peel me off amen I will be stuck
[47:45] to him or he'll be stuck to me however
[47:48] you want to word it amen but you see
[47:50] what God is doing he's bringing us to a
[47:54] place that we can look in the word and
[47:56] not it is not always my brother and
[47:58] sister now judgment begins in the house
[48:00] of God I lift my hand and say thank you
[48:02] Lord many a sermon has corrected this
[48:05] guy right here in the house of God but
[48:08] not everything is Judgment in the house
[48:10] of God sometimes God just brings an
[48:13] anointing down a presence that's there
[48:16] to remind us of who we are amen now
[48:20] correction reminds us who we are because
[48:22] he says those I love I chasten so if
[48:24] he's not chastening he's not loving amen
[48:27] but we are here tonight as the Bride Can
[48:31] I Be boastful tonight we are here
[48:33] tonight as the bride the bride of Christ
[48:36] amen not a bride the bride amen
[48:40] hallelujah so it's there we look now why
[48:43] would just uh go through the scriptures
[48:45] for just a moment if you don't mind uh
[48:47] verse 1 he says I waited patiently for
[48:50] the Lord ain't inclined into me in other
[48:54] words you could take this if you want to
[48:56] look at this and you can say that he he
[48:59] was disposed to listen he was inclined
[49:03] to to come and listen and and take what
[49:08] I you know I was there and as it is my
[49:12] brother and sister when God inclines
[49:13] himself
[49:14] he is coming and saying I am going to
[49:18] and that fits right into the word
[49:21] promise
[49:23] he's come and he said you cry out
[49:28] I will hear you
[49:30] and I will respond to you
[49:33] otherwise
[49:36] you know what the devil does if you ever
[49:37] saw that maybe you experienced it you
[49:40] get in a position maybe not not
[49:42] spiritually strong
[49:44] and we think our prayers
[49:47] came up
[49:49] hit the ceiling
[49:51] and like smoke above the range
[49:54] just curled away
[49:56] and slowly disappeared
[49:59] I can't tell you as a minister how many
[50:01] times people have spoke to me my prayers
[50:04] are not getting beyond the roof
[50:12] don't want to sound judgmental
[50:15] but what was your prayer
[50:18] was it a begging
[50:22] was it selfish
[50:24] was it out of season
[50:26] a lot of things I won't go into all of
[50:28] that but a lot of things that can impact
[50:30] that we say Lord I need you to come on
[50:32] the scene and he says okay I'm coming
[50:37] I'm telling you if my phone does more
[50:39] than two little circles I'm like what's
[50:41] wrong with this thing
[50:43] now approach god with your prayers the
[50:46] same way and we don't wait around to
[50:50] hear the answer
[50:52] we're already gone gonna fix it ourself
[50:55] before God can even come on the scene
[50:59] so what happens is when we come as David
[51:02] David had those experience but he says
[51:05] here I waited patiently oh Lord let that
[51:07] be me amen I want to pray and I'm in a
[51:11] way patiently for you to come on this
[51:13] scene and answer and you incline
[51:15] yourself and let's make this personal
[51:17] tonight not a historical message here
[51:20] and he inclined himself unto me
[51:23] amen and he heard My Cry amen can we
[51:27] claim that tonight amen so God is ever
[51:30] present and with us on time all the time
[51:33] we need to get on his time amen
[51:39] you know and so it says here he brought
[51:42] me up also so besides the fact that he's
[51:45] acknowledging God's hearing my prayer
[51:47] and he's doing this work in my life I
[51:50] was in a pit oh my can anyone tonight
[51:52] say I know I have a vague memory of that
[51:56] pit amen but I'm not in the pit anymore
[51:59] and don't let the devil toss you back in
[52:02] the pit because God's delivered you amen
[52:07] you know like the little story of the
[52:09] man was just gonna uh you know he was
[52:11] had this old donkey fell in the well and
[52:13] he says you know what there's no way I
[52:15] can get this donkey out we're just gonna
[52:16] bury him here and they start throwing
[52:19] dirt in there but the donkey's down
[52:21] there in the bottom of the well and
[52:23] every shovel full of dirt that hit him
[52:26] amen every accusation every dirty mean
[52:29] thought the devil ever had and the
[52:31] donkey shakes the dirt off and next
[52:34] thing you know the donkey's up around
[52:35] level amen because he refused to accept
[52:39] that he refused to stand for that and I
[52:42] tell you my brother and sister this pit
[52:44] that God has brought us out of you were
[52:47] actually an integral part of getting out
[52:49] of the pit God did not just say okay I'm
[52:52] pluck you out of the pit and you know
[52:53] and throw you over here or put you over
[52:55] here God Made You and I as the bride of
[52:59] Christ struggle through the Deliverance
[53:02] of the pit amen he says I'm going to
[53:05] deliver you trust me but you are gonna
[53:08] get down get desperate have a better
[53:11] prayer life Reach Out cry out I'll
[53:14] answer but you've got to put an effort
[53:16] in
[53:17] oh we got way too many people in the
[53:20] world we live in today that just think
[53:21] God's Gonna hand him everything on the
[53:23] platter my brother and sister Our God
[53:26] wants you and I to be molded by our
[53:28] experience he wants us to have character
[53:30] when we come out of here it'll match we
[53:33] get to heaven with a characterless bride
[53:37] Lord my Mansion is not as big as his
[53:42] I this and I that no no no sorry
[53:47] that's not what God's doing
[53:49] we are going to be standing there before
[53:52] the Throne of God so thankful
[53:55] for what God has done for us there would
[53:58] be no room even if the devil could get
[54:00] there there wouldn't be room for the
[54:02] devil because this bride is going to
[54:04] fill up heaven with her praise
[54:06] amen she's going to fill it up amen and
[54:10] she's going to be standing there so
[54:12] solid because she's on a rock now my
[54:15] brother and sister we know I'm preaching
[54:17] to the choir in a sense but just bear
[54:19] with me amen this was not a rock of
[54:22] Peter
[54:23] a man who denied Christ
[54:26] a man who who literally within you might
[54:29] say hours backslid
[54:31] what kind of Revelation is that I I
[54:34] don't want that kind of Revelation
[54:40] you know there's a little crisis let me
[54:42] throw this in as an example a little
[54:43] crisis going on in the United States a
[54:45] major home builder in the United States
[54:48] and they've got a point that they are so
[54:50] greedy that they're building these brand
[54:51] new homes
[54:52] and they're actually in many cases unfit
[54:55] to live in before the people have ever
[54:57] moved in
[54:58] they're being sued right now for
[55:00] hundreds of millions of dollars now my
[55:02] brother and sister that's not the kind
[55:04] of habitation God is creating for you
[55:07] and I he's not creating for you and our
[55:10] habitation that's not fit to live in he
[55:13] is creating a habitation that is fit for
[55:16] a bride Fit For A chosen people to stand
[55:20] in his presence that's the kind of
[55:22] habitation that God is bringing us to
[55:24] and I can say praise the Lord now I'll
[55:27] throw this out as an example don't have
[55:29] a lot of Sympathy For Us amen but when I
[55:32] got married Jerry got married amen We
[55:34] Got Married the same time in case that
[55:36] wasn't uh but you know uh some of the
[55:39] first places I took my bride to live in
[55:42] and she lived in them for years amen you
[55:46] know houses that had holes in the floors
[55:48] and houses that the wind blew through
[55:50] the curtains you you didn't have to look
[55:52] outside what direction the wind was you
[55:54] just look at the curtains you'll see
[55:55] what direction they're going and it was
[55:57] that kind of a world and and I'm glad I
[56:00] thank God that she she was determined
[56:02] and stuck with me and we just had a kind
[56:05] of a bulldog faith that one day we would
[56:07] have a different alternative my brother
[56:10] and sister the devil would like you and
[56:12] I to believe that God has put us in a
[56:15] less than satisfactory habitation he
[56:18] would like us to believe that what he
[56:20] has provided for us is not sufficient
[56:23] for the day but I'm here to tell you the
[56:26] word says that it is sufficient I'm here
[56:29] to testify it is sufficient and I'm
[56:32] going to confess it is sufficient and we
[56:36] will come out of here as thee adorned
[56:39] bride of Jesus Christ
[56:42] amen not just a bunch of us I shouldn't
[56:46] use that word in church amen just so you
[56:48] know shabby looking we we were not going
[56:51] to come out of this shall be looking
[56:52] remember the little story about the
[56:54] Rancher and the and the the uh cousin or
[56:57] whatever my brother and sister she's
[56:59] there in work clothes scrubbing the
[57:01] floors doing the dishes doing all of
[57:03] this stuff and you know every day she
[57:06] just was wearing these kind of you know
[57:08] less than desirable clothes and that's
[57:11] how and I hope you can take the
[57:13] spiritual context that's how the other
[57:16] churches viewed her
[57:21] you're not as glorious as us you don't
[57:23] have as many people you don't have as
[57:24] fine of buildings you don't have this
[57:26] you don't have that but I'm telling you
[57:28] the day she went out to meet her
[57:30] bridegroom she was dressed in a dress
[57:34] that was a fitting to be a bride amen
[57:37] she didn't walk out there and shall be
[57:39] stained closed but she walked out there
[57:42] and pardoned me but without even a spot
[57:45] on the Hem of her garment and God said
[57:48] you know that's what I've got you're
[57:50] going to be right here laodicea you're
[57:52] going to labor you're going to push your
[57:54] way through this but when it comes to
[57:56] that moment cold praise the Lord when it
[57:59] comes to that moment not even a spot on
[58:01] the Hem of your garment
[58:03] oh thank you Lord and that was just a
[58:06] cute little story The Prophet told us
[58:09] [Music]
[58:11] Hallelujah let me get focused here
[58:14] blessed is that man that maketh the Lord
[58:16] his trust and respecteth not the proud
[58:20] now I'm just going to jump right out
[58:22] here I don't care whether you support
[58:24] Trump or not that's really up to you
[58:26] but I can tell you right now if you do
[58:28] support him you're supporting a very
[58:30] proud man
[58:34] and I'm not really picking on him
[58:35] because I think he's better than our
[58:37] current alternative
[58:38] uh but but
[58:41] you look at this see and people have
[58:43] thrown themselves
[58:44] into this this is the man but they're
[58:47] actually by scripture supporting a proud
[58:50] man and that's an anti-word
[58:54] and so we realize that while you know
[58:57] remember when he got elected or was
[58:59] coming up to that you know they were all
[59:00] like oh Trump it's in the scripture
[59:03] he's in the scripture all right my
[59:05] brother and sister he's in the scripture
[59:07] as a proud man
[59:09] not one to be looked up to amen but one
[59:13] to flee from
[59:14] amen amen I'm so glad God's in control
[59:18] amen if not
[59:21] well I don't know where we would move
[59:26] but look at this
[59:27] blessed is the man that maketh the Lord
[59:29] his trust and respect and not the proud
[59:31] nor such as turn aside to lies
[59:35] many
[59:37] oh my god oh Lord my God are thy
[59:40] wonderful works and I'm just going to
[59:42] just kind of paraphrase our way through
[59:44] verse 5. my brother and sister because I
[59:46] already kind of touched on it how that
[59:49] we if we could by recall
[59:52] start to write the things of our life
[59:56] start to write
[59:58] how
[1:00:00] visiting with the in-laws
[1:00:06] they're like
[1:00:08] wow
[1:00:10] even when you wasn't serving God he was
[1:00:12] right there wasn't he
[1:00:15] he was
[1:00:17] he was right there
[1:00:18] all the time
[1:00:20] all the time he can't lose a one my
[1:00:22] brother and sister
[1:00:23] amen the devil would lead us off you
[1:00:26] know now lead us right to the wolf amen
[1:00:29] forget about the wolf coming to us the
[1:00:31] devil would lead us to the wolf
[1:00:33] amen but God In His Infinite Mercy amen
[1:00:37] and if we start to just recall this is
[1:00:40] what Fellowship really ought to be it
[1:00:42] shouldn't be about politics and it
[1:00:44] shouldn't be about the price or whatever
[1:00:45] my brother and sister but Fellowship
[1:00:48] ought to be us as Sons and Daughters of
[1:00:51] God recounting to one another in
[1:00:53] encouragement of what God has done for
[1:00:56] us and what he is currently doing amen
[1:00:59] you see when God's on the scene oh let
[1:01:01] me just put it this way when God's on
[1:01:04] this scene you don't need to see the
[1:01:07] conclusion you know what the conclusion
[1:01:10] will be amen God's not taking you out
[1:01:13] there to leave you in the wilderness but
[1:01:15] he said I'll take you through the
[1:01:17] Wilderness and lead you into the
[1:01:20] Promised Land
[1:01:21] so the problem is is we say well I just
[1:01:23] struggle to trust the Lord well what you
[1:01:26] need to do is learn to just trust the
[1:01:28] word
[1:01:30] and the word says that he hasn't lost a
[1:01:34] one so all you got to do is sit back and
[1:01:36] say Lord you're in control I'm along for
[1:01:39] the ride
[1:01:40] amen I've said this before you know some
[1:01:42] country music person sang a song about
[1:01:45] Lord take the wheel they still got their
[1:01:47] foot on the gas they still got their
[1:01:49] foot on the break oh Lord You Take the
[1:01:51] Wheel he wants it all he doesn't want
[1:01:54] part of it he wants all of it that we
[1:01:56] would say Lord and I've only seen a
[1:01:58] glimmer of a shaking of a pebble on the
[1:02:01] mountain but your word said this
[1:02:03] mountain will move and I believe your
[1:02:06] word so the mountain in my mind and
[1:02:09] heart is gone
[1:02:11] I'll tell you what that will do it will
[1:02:13] change your perspective about life when
[1:02:15] you're looking out not looking at the
[1:02:16] mountain waiting for it to move but look
[1:02:18] at the word and says I have a need and
[1:02:22] he promised he would move the mountain
[1:02:24] mountain you're gone
[1:02:26] the world's going to say you're crazy
[1:02:27] but you're crazy anyway
[1:02:30] I mean what's more and more time of them
[1:02:32] saying you know you're crazy
[1:02:35] what is what does God need to send a
[1:02:37] prophet we have all of these things well
[1:02:39] according to my Bible he had to send a
[1:02:42] prophet to fulfill the Bible amen so he
[1:02:45] would send a prophet if nothing more
[1:02:47] than to fulfill his word but I'll tell
[1:02:51] you what tonight I needed a prophet I
[1:02:53] needed someone that would come and I
[1:02:56] needed god with skin on I needed a
[1:02:58] prophet that had to apologize for
[1:03:00] getting his wife to lie I needed a
[1:03:03] prophet that made mistakes under the
[1:03:05] prophet that had these attributes and
[1:03:08] they're looking for a perfect one I'm
[1:03:10] looking for one I can relate to
[1:03:12] amen and God brought him right down in
[1:03:14] our midst and said here it is because
[1:03:16] it's not about him it's all about me and
[1:03:20] so he doesn't have to be perfect because
[1:03:22] I'm the perfect one
[1:03:24] and there it was in that that God is
[1:03:27] fulfilling his word amen his wonderful
[1:03:30] works and this is kind of tying back
[1:03:33] into our Bible study Sunday night
[1:03:34] talking about sacrificing offering you
[1:03:38] see we've come to a place it says Hear
[1:03:40] sacrifice and offering thou didst not
[1:03:42] desire My nears hast thou open my
[1:03:46] brother and sister we just don't really
[1:03:48] grasp
[1:03:49] what an outstanding Revelation that
[1:03:52] David had for that day
[1:03:55] for that time in history
[1:03:59] how deep his Revelation was
[1:04:02] many were still looking out saying I got
[1:04:06] to fulfill this I've got to do this I
[1:04:07] got to do this I got to check the box
[1:04:09] check the box but David had a revelation
[1:04:12] that he started to recognize it's not
[1:04:14] about that it's not about blood and
[1:04:17] lambs and Bullocks and all of these
[1:04:19] things it's all about me being the one
[1:04:22] that was sacrificed to the ultimate lamb
[1:04:25] the one that has given over to the
[1:04:27] ultimate and he'd come to that place he
[1:04:30] recognized who he was and where he fit
[1:04:33] and this coming because I'm not wanting
[1:04:35] to keep you all night we just kind of
[1:04:38] move so he realized that that the sin
[1:04:41] offering was for purpose
[1:04:43] but it was not God's ultimate
[1:04:46] isn't that beautiful
[1:04:49] but I like verse 7 and this is what
[1:04:51] really caught my attention
[1:04:52] then said I
[1:04:54] lo I come
[1:04:57] in the volume of the book it is written
[1:05:00] of me
[1:05:02] that's almost sounds arrogant if you are
[1:05:05] a not a real believer
[1:05:09] but yes Brother David hit it right there
[1:05:12] it makes the word so personal
[1:05:16] oh Saints
[1:05:18] amen you realize God wrote this book and
[1:05:22] in this book he encapsulated you amen
[1:05:27] everything you are is in the volume of
[1:05:31] this book and it is not that I need to
[1:05:33] go over here and people say but I'm
[1:05:36] bothered by you focus so much on brother
[1:05:38] Branham well I'm sorry that you missed
[1:05:41] the messenger that came to the door but
[1:05:44] I'm holding the message
[1:05:46] amen I'm not chasing the postman down
[1:05:49] the street saying thank you thank you
[1:05:51] for the message thank you for the
[1:05:53] message I have been given the message
[1:05:56] and the volume
[1:05:59] look at this
[1:06:01] people say well not I don't want every
[1:06:02] promise in this book well I've actually
[1:06:04] changed my opinion on that
[1:06:06] I want every promise in this book I want
[1:06:09] every promises is talking about the what
[1:06:11] we might call negative
[1:06:13] well Hallelujah I need to have the
[1:06:17] contrast
[1:06:19] amen
[1:06:22] sister April some of these tests you
[1:06:24] guys do are all about contrast aren't
[1:06:26] they and it's all about measure the
[1:06:29] background of this to that and that's
[1:06:31] how they actually see the picture
[1:06:33] imagine if you took the Majestic
[1:06:35] mountains away and only left this puddle
[1:06:40] you'd look at it and say
[1:06:43] nice Lake
[1:06:45] but it would lose its significance
[1:06:48] because
[1:06:50] it lost the Majesty of what was placed
[1:06:53] around it
[1:06:56] we could get really
[1:06:59] deep down but I'm going to just kind of
[1:07:01] stay on the surface we're all believers
[1:07:03] here
[1:07:04] the promise of this book
[1:07:07] tonight
[1:07:08] song service well God laid on brother
[1:07:11] Alex's heart
[1:07:13] brother Trevor is talking about love
[1:07:16] and I'm over there going thank you Lord
[1:07:17] thank you Lord I felt like I was on the
[1:07:20] right track I believe I was on the right
[1:07:21] track I know I'm on the right track now
[1:07:23] amen my brother and sister you see what
[1:07:26] this is this is the greatest love story
[1:07:31] how many of you read romance novels
[1:07:36] even if you did you wouldn't admit it
[1:07:41] so you're going to wonder where I'm at
[1:07:43] okay I'm going to tell you my brother
[1:07:45] and sister all that was in Christ was
[1:07:48] poured into the church who's the church
[1:07:50] amen it's not a building it's not
[1:07:52] shingles Rafters a floor carpet whatever
[1:07:55] amen all that was in Christ was poured
[1:07:57] into the church amen all of the word
[1:08:01] amen pointed to Jesus Christ he's there
[1:08:05] telling them that if you had known let
[1:08:07] me just paraphrase it if you had known
[1:08:10] God like you claimed to you would know
[1:08:13] me
[1:08:13] amen because the book has been all about
[1:08:18] me from the beginning to present time
[1:08:21] Amen in fact we can take it all the way
[1:08:24] to the end it's about him but this could
[1:08:27] get a little confusing if you didn't
[1:08:28] have a depth as it were in the message
[1:08:30] because you see this book is all about
[1:08:32] me this book is all about you wait it's
[1:08:35] all about Jesus Christ no it's all about
[1:08:37] me because he poured himself into me and
[1:08:40] I am him and he is me I'm bone of his
[1:08:44] bone I am flesh of his flesh and he has
[1:08:47] come and possessed us
[1:08:50] people are like well I don't know these
[1:08:52] Spirits possessing people I want to be
[1:08:54] possessed amen I want the Holy Ghost to
[1:08:57] come down every fiber of my being I want
[1:09:01] to be this expressed oh Hallelujah
[1:09:06] Hallelujah
[1:09:08] amen it's powerful words Saints it's a
[1:09:12] powerful message we have and when you
[1:09:15] see the open word amen let me just
[1:09:17] figuratively take this we have the Bible
[1:09:19] it was a closed book now look we come
[1:09:21] out of denominations family and this all
[1:09:24] of these things some our families have
[1:09:26] history serving God going way back but
[1:09:28] one day the book got opened
[1:09:32] oh my even people today it's sad to say
[1:09:35] there's people around our ranks that
[1:09:37] believe you shouldn't read between the
[1:09:40] lines I'm there I'm stunned I I remember
[1:09:42] the day I heard this from an individual
[1:09:44] yeah you shouldn't be reading between
[1:09:46] the lines you'll just get confused and
[1:09:48] I'm like but I just read the prophet
[1:09:50] saying this bride
[1:09:52] is going to read
[1:09:55] come on
[1:09:56] between the lines
[1:09:58] oh what is it
[1:10:00] amen now it didn't say our eyes were
[1:10:03] opened it said our ears were hearing but
[1:10:06] you see I'm standing on my example and
[1:10:09] that is the fact that I can read this
[1:10:11] but until God speaks to me it's not what
[1:10:16] my eyes see
[1:10:18] it's God speaking to us
[1:10:21] because we could be physically
[1:10:24] and be filled with filled with
[1:10:25] revelation
[1:10:26] amen so it's God speaking to us and when
[1:10:29] the book is opened
[1:10:31] when you see
[1:10:33] the open book now I'm going to be
[1:10:35] preaching a little contrary just please
[1:10:37] balance what I'm saying tonight okay
[1:10:39] when we have the open book you are
[1:10:43] seeing the bride in word form
[1:10:47] amen you say oh we receive Christ we see
[1:10:50] Christ yeah wherever Christ is his bride
[1:10:53] is there with them amen and so you when
[1:10:58] the book is open you are seeing the
[1:11:00] bride in word form I'm so glad I can
[1:11:04] read this word and see myself in the
[1:11:07] presence of almighty God I don't need
[1:11:09] someone to interpret I don't need
[1:11:11] somebody to explain amen God said I'm
[1:11:14] going to send a prophet he's going to
[1:11:16] introduce you to your bridegroom Jesus
[1:11:19] Christ and in that introduction
[1:11:22] I don't even need to go in that
[1:11:24] I don't need to but I guess I will
[1:11:27] amen
[1:11:29] you know we use words like wordbride
[1:11:32] catchy isn't it
[1:11:35] what does it mean
[1:11:41] go in the grocery store
[1:11:43] walk down the aisle
[1:11:46] and for any product there's 10 versions
[1:11:48] of it and they're all the best
[1:11:51] I mean you've never went in a store and
[1:11:54] saw a label on a product we have the
[1:11:57] worst tomato sauce
[1:12:00] no sir it's all the best
[1:12:02] and the devil's out here and the prophet
[1:12:05] of God said it's not a glow it's a glare
[1:12:09] and some people like a glare
[1:12:12] some people are like the shinier it is
[1:12:18] do you know how to catch a raccoon
[1:12:25] a drill
[1:12:26] a hammer and a nail
[1:12:28] and a lid off a tin can
[1:12:32] you drill a hole in the log
[1:12:34] put the lid of the tin can in the bottom
[1:12:36] and drive a nail at an angle
[1:12:38] and when the raccoon sees that shiny lid
[1:12:41] he reaches in there no pain
[1:12:43] reaches in there grabs the holds of the
[1:12:45] lid
[1:12:46] the pain comes of the fact he won't let
[1:12:50] go
[1:12:51] of what he believes is important
[1:12:58] now I know this is a stretch but bear
[1:13:00] with me
[1:13:02] that's why
[1:13:03] let go and let God have his way
[1:13:08] I'm holding on to my career I'm holding
[1:13:10] on to this I'm holding on to my bank
[1:13:12] account
[1:13:13] Hallelujah
[1:13:17] the can just walk away if he'll let
[1:13:19] go
[1:13:20] but he can't let go
[1:13:23] it's of his nature he has to have it
[1:13:28] hmm
[1:13:29] we could go a lot of ways from that
[1:13:31] couldn't we
[1:13:33] so let's go back to being a word bride
[1:13:36] we can take a whole so the phrase word
[1:13:38] bride and it's very catchy
[1:13:40] and we can tout that everywhere we go we
[1:13:43] are the word bride of Jesus Christ
[1:13:48] are we
[1:13:57] prove it
[1:14:02] let me open the book
[1:14:06] it's right here
[1:14:08] in written form
[1:14:10] you see
[1:14:12] a lot of people have read it
[1:14:15] if you talk to people and I like to talk
[1:14:19] to people you know it's kind of scary if
[1:14:21] I can insert this when you're young
[1:14:23] you're like oh Lord don't let me be like
[1:14:26] my dad
[1:14:29] I'm now 61 years old
[1:14:32] and I'm like I can't even hardly walk in
[1:14:34] a store without talking to somebody
[1:14:40] but God has been gracious
[1:14:43] and I start fishing
[1:14:46] and pretty soon somebody's like well
[1:14:48] what do you do well I have a couple jobs
[1:14:51] really at your age you work two jobs
[1:14:54] yeah I'm a farmer by day you might say
[1:14:58] a pastor by weekend or evening
[1:15:02] what do you do
[1:15:05] they share that and I'm like where do
[1:15:07] you go to church oh we haven't been to
[1:15:09] church in years
[1:15:11] my apologies
[1:15:13] not like oh yeah that's too bad oh
[1:15:15] that's terrible no my apologies you
[1:15:17] don't know what you're missing
[1:15:18] man Church my brother and sister you
[1:15:21] might misunderstand me tonight but I'm
[1:15:22] telling you even if you did not have
[1:15:24] this Revelation Church is good for you
[1:15:28] even in the denomination church is good
[1:15:31] for those people
[1:15:37] yeah well I have quote to back it up
[1:15:40] prophet of God said if they just preach
[1:15:42] that Jesus is divine
[1:15:44] hmm that wasn't for our day
[1:15:47] that wasn't for us we recognize that but
[1:15:50] my brother and sister not everyone has
[1:15:51] had the book opened not everyone's had
[1:15:53] their ear open and so we see how that
[1:15:56] God is working and as the book has been
[1:15:58] opened and we come with Revelation to
[1:16:01] look at this amen what do we do we have
[1:16:04] the same vocabulary with an entirely
[1:16:08] different language
[1:16:11] I'm a Believer
[1:16:12] I'm telling you you can go down here in
[1:16:14] the grocery store at the gas station
[1:16:16] wherever I'm a Believer but there's an
[1:16:19] entirely different language associated
[1:16:22] with I'm a Believer and you'll find that
[1:16:25] the world is increasingly vocal about
[1:16:28] being the Bride of Jesus Christ amen but
[1:16:31] my brother and sister what does it mean
[1:16:34] it is not something as a self-identifier
[1:16:37] we're living in the day of the
[1:16:39] self-identification amen I was just a
[1:16:42] little deal with sister Jerry the other
[1:16:43] day sitting there in a chair and the
[1:16:45] young lady that is sitting there looks
[1:16:47] at me I thought she was joking at first
[1:16:49] and she said um sir
[1:16:51] and that's sharing she called me sir and
[1:16:53] then asked me how I identified
[1:16:56] I looked at her and I was like what did
[1:16:58] you just say
[1:17:00] and she got all embarrassed she goes I
[1:17:03] I have to ask you this
[1:17:06] how do you identify why do I look like
[1:17:11] I know that's not sufficient you have to
[1:17:14] say it
[1:17:16] I'm man male well you know just name
[1:17:19] them all off what what goes along you
[1:17:22] know and she just laughs she goes yeah
[1:17:24] I'm sorry that's a requirement I have to
[1:17:27] do
[1:17:28] my brother and sister but as I was
[1:17:30] sitting there I was thinking about that
[1:17:32] what is my identifier
[1:17:35] what is my identifier
[1:17:37] amen the world is caught up in the very
[1:17:41] uh Vapor let me put it this way the very
[1:17:45] Vapor that came out of the Garden of
[1:17:48] Eden they have breathed it in and it has
[1:17:51] poisoned them and so they are their
[1:17:54] identifying with something that was
[1:17:57] there the original the beautiful
[1:18:00] creation of God and then as it is as the
[1:18:04] prophet of God brings it out shows us
[1:18:06] very clearly amen the masculine the
[1:18:09] feminine how that the feminine separated
[1:18:11] out of the masculine are you following
[1:18:13] why they're confused
[1:18:19] Satan's took them back
[1:18:21] where
[1:18:22] not to Creation
[1:18:25] to the garden
[1:18:27] and as it was in the beginning so shall
[1:18:29] it be in the end and so they are there
[1:18:31] taking this end and they were never I
[1:18:34] hope you follow me I don't mean to make
[1:18:36] a Doctrine out of this it's just
[1:18:37] something that's been forming in my mind
[1:18:39] and is it there how did we become
[1:18:42] separated masculine
[1:18:45] feminine
[1:18:50] it was God did the separating
[1:18:52] and they are here now a Godless
[1:18:55] generation and there is no separation
[1:18:58] they don't know if they're masculine
[1:19:01] they don't know if they're feminine
[1:19:03] because it was God that did that
[1:19:05] separating amen and we sit here today
[1:19:08] just thinking I was born this way no my
[1:19:10] brother and sister you were created this
[1:19:12] way it wasn't just I burst some
[1:19:15] chromosomes some mixing of DNA it was
[1:19:18] from the very Throne of almighty God
[1:19:20] before the foundation of the world that
[1:19:22] he said this is who you are and they did
[1:19:25] not come out of that they come another
[1:19:28] alternative route and they don't know if
[1:19:30] they're man or woman
[1:19:32] because the spirit of laodicea has taken
[1:19:36] them back into the garden and they're in
[1:19:38] the garden they are sitting there who
[1:19:40] are we what are we well I'll tell you my
[1:19:43] brother and sister this word bride is
[1:19:45] not just a catchy phrase you might have
[1:19:47] wondered where I was taking you it is a
[1:19:50] fact it is a fact we are the word bride
[1:19:55] of Jesus Christ he's the one that said
[1:19:58] this is what will take you back to your
[1:20:01] original in your place of my presence
[1:20:05] Walking In The Garden in the cool of the
[1:20:07] evening it won't be the spirit of
[1:20:10] laodicea it will be the word
[1:20:13] and when the word is open and becomes
[1:20:15] real it is a living
[1:20:18] I'm going to use the word creature if
[1:20:20] you don't mind it is a living creature
[1:20:23] amen it's not a dead letter of the word
[1:20:26] but it's living
[1:20:30] Hallelujah
[1:20:32] oh
[1:20:34] now I want you to disconnect with this
[1:20:36] right here real quick
[1:20:37] because this also goes to this laodicean
[1:20:40] spirit
[1:20:40] anointed ones at the end time amen
[1:20:43] hallelujah
[1:20:48] we're going to just take a little
[1:20:51] blip out of this if you don't mind
[1:20:54] brother Brown says right here
[1:20:57] I don't care what it is
[1:21:00] if it's contrary to the written word for
[1:21:03] this hour
[1:21:04] it's a lie
[1:21:06] God will have nothing to do with it
[1:21:09] no matter how sincere how educated how
[1:21:12] smart how true it sounds how reasonable
[1:21:16] it sounds if it's contrary to the word
[1:21:19] of this hour
[1:21:31] they're creating more genders every day
[1:21:39] you can't find them
[1:21:43] I can't find them
[1:21:45] my brother and sister I can't find them
[1:21:50] if it's contrary to the word of this
[1:21:54] hour
[1:21:56] it's a lie
[1:21:58] and this sounds harsh
[1:22:00] but the world is living a lie
[1:22:04] there's no truth in them
[1:22:08] they have identification
[1:22:11] but they don't have reality
[1:22:14] they don't have Christ so therefore they
[1:22:17] have something else
[1:22:20] I wouldn't even say it was created
[1:22:22] because the prophet says it was
[1:22:23] perverted
[1:22:25] so it's not even something created to go
[1:22:27] back to it was perverted
[1:22:35] now in verse 7 it said then said I lo I
[1:22:39] come in the volume of the book it is
[1:22:40] written of me
[1:22:43] I don't want you to get caught in a side
[1:22:45] note sometimes it's easy we could get
[1:22:47] caught in a side note where you're like
[1:22:49] well okay that thought yeah okay okay
[1:22:52] we were just kind of wander
[1:22:54] you know preachers do that a lot
[1:23:00] see we have all kinds of History
[1:23:04] can we find history
[1:23:06] we can find all kinds of History
[1:23:08] I can tell you my brother and sister I
[1:23:10] mentioned it in the church before
[1:23:12] we were in Seattle many years ago
[1:23:15] family wanted to take us to the what's
[1:23:18] the name of the museum thing there in
[1:23:20] Seattle Metropolitan Museum of Art
[1:23:24] and uh I was like dragging my heels I
[1:23:28] was like Jerry seriously
[1:23:31] come on you agreed to this
[1:23:35] I'm going to sit in the car and she's
[1:23:37] like
[1:23:38] are you kidding they already paid for
[1:23:39] the tickets you are not not's making her
[1:23:41] bossy or nothing but she's just like
[1:23:44] you are not sitting in the car they
[1:23:46] already paid if you knew how much they
[1:23:48] paid for these tickets you would really
[1:23:50] blow your top
[1:23:52] and I'm like okay
[1:23:54] Saints I tell you God knows what he's
[1:23:56] doing we go in there the first thing
[1:23:58] hanging from the ceiling inside the
[1:24:00] doors of this uh Seattle Metropolitan
[1:24:03] Museum of Art is an old rusty car with
[1:24:06] holes blown in it and plastic pipes
[1:24:08] sticking in every direction
[1:24:10] that is art
[1:24:15] we had a car like that on the back side
[1:24:16] of our place right there by the ravine
[1:24:19] what is so Artful about that
[1:24:22] and we went over here and there was this
[1:24:24] stuff not making fun of it it actually
[1:24:26] does take more Talent than one would
[1:24:27] think but here's these canvases and it
[1:24:30] looks like somebody just
[1:24:32] got a bunch of kids with paint balloons
[1:24:34] and went
[1:24:37] and they called it a masterpiece
[1:24:42] I think I'll get the kids to create some
[1:24:45] masterpieces
[1:24:47] probably at Brother sergey's house not
[1:24:49] mine
[1:24:53] but we rounded a corner Saints
[1:24:56] and here it was on loan from
[1:25:00] the Louvre I believe is in Paris France
[1:25:04] and here's all these statues and I
[1:25:06] started just going by them yeah but I
[1:25:08] stopped red one
[1:25:11] wait
[1:25:15] that's almost what's on this bronze
[1:25:17] plaque is
[1:25:18] verbatim
[1:25:21] of what brother Branham speaks
[1:25:24] man I turn around I go back to the very
[1:25:27] first of all these I walked by and I
[1:25:29] start reading them
[1:25:31] oh my
[1:25:33] they won't let you take a camera they
[1:25:35] won't let you take a piece of paper and
[1:25:36] an ink pen you can't take nothing in
[1:25:38] there
[1:25:39] if you are caught taking a picture they
[1:25:41] kick you out
[1:25:43] so I'm just reading it over and over
[1:25:45] again mentally absorbing this
[1:25:47] wow and I moved to the next one
[1:25:51] wow
[1:25:53] and the next one wow
[1:25:57] and they're all done with the tour and
[1:25:58] ready to go to a restaurant and I'm way
[1:26:01] lost back in here somewhere from one
[1:26:04] bronze plaque to the next just like
[1:26:07] I believe the message but I'm telling
[1:26:09] you here it is these people are talking
[1:26:11] about history and gods and this thing
[1:26:13] and that thing and what happened to this
[1:26:15] point of history and how they're doing
[1:26:16] this my brother and sister I didn't need
[1:26:18] that to believe but it tells me that
[1:26:21] every person in this world that goes
[1:26:24] through there and reads those has been
[1:26:26] witness to
[1:26:31] him to witness the word
[1:26:35] amen now if God can use a museum to
[1:26:37] witness the word how much more will the
[1:26:40] open book in flesh called the bride of
[1:26:43] Christ be a witness to this world Amen
[1:26:46] because she's walking in places they'll
[1:26:49] never take that you want to talk about
[1:26:50] something interesting so valuable so
[1:26:53] valuable that every one of these things
[1:26:55] was in a case and they have all the
[1:26:57] lasers with the security and everything
[1:27:00] is there and and you know I'm I wasn't
[1:27:02] born yesterday and I'm like that guy's
[1:27:04] got a gun under his coat and uh oh that
[1:27:06] guy right there yeah oh yeah that's how
[1:27:08] valuable it was to me but my brother and
[1:27:10] sister they hardly place any value on
[1:27:13] the open word but here is the bride
[1:27:17] revealed here is a treasure the word of
[1:27:22] God says that is immeasurable in value
[1:27:25] and you say what the word's talking
[1:27:27] about Christ that's right he's inside of
[1:27:30] me amen and so he is a major beyond
[1:27:34] measure and he's in you and I then we
[1:27:37] are a major beyond measure
[1:27:39] oh hallelujah how about we quit looking
[1:27:42] us for me I'm the bride I believe the
[1:27:44] message but poor me poor me poor me I am
[1:27:47] a measure of riches beyond belief
[1:27:51] Hallelujah and how did I figure that out
[1:27:55] it was contained in the volume of the
[1:27:58] book
[1:27:59] oh that's why the devil don't want us
[1:28:01] reading our Bible
[1:28:03] amen hallelujah
[1:28:06] all kinds of History all kinds of
[1:28:08] authors all kinds of stories all kinds
[1:28:10] of lessons encouragement correction
[1:28:13] revelation
[1:28:17] and how do you sum it up
[1:28:19] greatest
[1:28:21] love story
[1:28:23] greatest love story ever
[1:28:27] my brother and sister
[1:28:29] so when I ask you all of you read love
[1:28:30] stories
[1:28:32] amen I'll ask you again do any of you
[1:28:35] read love stories
[1:28:37] hallelujah amen
[1:28:40] they can be pretty interesting
[1:28:43] oh my
[1:28:44] I'm not sure
[1:28:46] I'm not sure if we would love some of
[1:28:48] these people that God loved
[1:28:54] it would take God
[1:28:58] I'm going to just bring it right home
[1:28:59] it's not personal and you know that but
[1:29:01] it would take God for some of you to
[1:29:03] love some of us
[1:29:05] right here
[1:29:08] we wouldn't have went out in the world
[1:29:10] and hunted each other up
[1:29:13] no sir if I had magnets I would show you
[1:29:17] what our reaction to each other would be
[1:29:25] the god came
[1:29:27] and we found something in the book and
[1:29:30] he said that is a part of my bride and
[1:29:34] you are a part of the bride and then all
[1:29:36] of a sudden when we recognize that oh
[1:29:39] drawn together and that's how we're
[1:29:42] compelled and Drawn to Christ amen we
[1:29:44] don't have to say oh we we sing the song
[1:29:47] Saints now don't misunderstand me
[1:29:48] tonight okay but we sing the song Draw
[1:29:51] Me nearer amen if you just read the word
[1:29:54] and you ask God for the Holy Ghost you
[1:29:56] won't need that it will draw you near
[1:29:59] amen it will will pull you like you've
[1:30:02] never been pulled before because the
[1:30:05] word is always attracted to the word
[1:30:09] oh let me move on we're running out of
[1:30:11] time tonight amen
[1:30:14] so it turns out this book is the record
[1:30:16] actually of the greatest love story ever
[1:30:20] and let me tell you how much he loves me
[1:30:23] let me tell you how much he loves you
[1:30:25] amen beyond the value of Heaven and
[1:30:31] Earth

[1:30:41] it anybody not catching that ten

[1:30:49] amen you want to know what it is I've
[1:30:51] shared this with you before one time I
[1:30:53] had a pretty good calculator we had a
[1:30:55] scientific calculator and I sat down on
[1:30:58] the computer and went to the gross
[1:31:00] economies of the gross national product
[1:31:02] and just started the alphabetical you
[1:31:04] know in the United States is way at the
[1:31:06] end right the you part and I started
[1:31:09] adding up the gross national product of
[1:31:11] the Nations alphabetically
[1:31:13] I didn't even get this much down the
[1:31:15] page and the computer said um whatever
[1:31:18] its words were you've exceeded
[1:31:21] that was just this much down a page
[1:31:24] and there was like 38 pages
[1:31:30] Oh How He Loves
[1:31:33] you and me
[1:31:36] this bride is so special you see
[1:31:41] she's Glory beyond measure

[1:31:47] and I am so glad
[1:31:50] I gotta Live By Your Side Oh Hallelujah
[1:31:54] Saints if we just recognize that God has
[1:31:57] come and this was all in the volume
[1:32:02] of the book
[1:32:05] I'm sorry people can't read the book for
[1:32:06] what it is
[1:32:08] I'm sorry they can't see that just like
[1:32:10] if I can throw this out to you just like
[1:32:13] when people hear the little stories that
[1:32:15] brother Branham tells they don't see
[1:32:17] anything but a little orphan girl living
[1:32:20] with her cousins and a man decides she's
[1:32:24] a nice girl that's going to take her
[1:32:25] away they don't see the open book that's
[1:32:29] right they don't see the volume of what
[1:32:32] is being spoken they don't see the
[1:32:35] beauty of what it is and how that would
[1:32:37] encourage Sons and Daughters of God to
[1:32:40] be able to stand and oh my brother and
[1:32:42] sister actually not stand get down and
[1:32:45] scrub the floor amen get down and do the
[1:32:47] Dirty Work get down and live through all
[1:32:50] of the things of laodicea that we don't
[1:32:52] want to live in and we don't want to do
[1:32:54] and God said that's all right I'm coming
[1:32:56] for you I've got a promise for you I'm
[1:32:59] Coming For You
[1:33:01] hallelujah amen let's just go

[1:33:21] this
[1:33:22] oh that spiritual union of Christ and
[1:33:25] his church now
[1:33:27] when the flesh is becoming word
[1:33:31] oh isn't that beautiful my brother and
[1:33:32] sister we're not just a people saying
[1:33:35] amen do we believe the prophet's words I
[1:33:38] don't think we'd be here tonight if we
[1:33:40] didn't amen we're not just saying we are
[1:33:43] a word bride but a prophet is here
[1:33:45] declaring and telling them amen when the
[1:33:48] flesh My Flesh your flesh is becoming
[1:33:51] word and the word is becoming flesh
[1:33:55] manifested Vindicated just what the
[1:33:58] Bible said would happen in this day it's
[1:34:00] happening day by day my brother and
[1:34:02] sister this was 1965 and the plan of
[1:34:06] God's not stopping for nobody it's so
[1:34:08] much more today than it was when the
[1:34:11] prophet said it Hallelujah we don't need
[1:34:14] to add to it this is sufficient amen why
[1:34:17] it's culminating so fast out there in
[1:34:21] those deserts and things taking place
[1:34:23] that I couldn't even keep up with it
[1:34:25] we're near the coming of Jesus to be
[1:34:27] United with his church where the word
[1:34:30] becomes the word
[1:34:32] hmm thank you Lord
[1:34:35] call of the Holy Spirit you see my
[1:34:37] brother and sister it's not just a
[1:34:39] preacher's call it's not a prophet's
[1:34:41] call this is God's call
[1:34:44] of the Holy Spirit searching the hearts
[1:34:47] you're standing completely you never
[1:34:50] sinned at the first place I'd ought to
[1:34:54] get one of us some of us all of us to be
[1:34:56] able to say Thank You Lord thank you
[1:34:59] Lord that you're looking down on us I
[1:35:02] never did it in the first place now if
[1:35:05] God says you didn't do it and the devil
[1:35:08] says you did who you going to call a
[1:35:10] liar
[1:35:12] it's not a very hard decision if we
[1:35:15] think about it that way but if it's in a
[1:35:18] difficult day a hard struggle a time
[1:35:21] that things are not well in your life
[1:35:22] and your family etc etc and the Devil
[1:35:25] comes along and says you're not the
[1:35:27] bride
[1:35:28] and we'll even entertain that thought
[1:35:31] but if we'll just remember God said you
[1:35:33] never did it
[1:35:34] Amen in the first place
[1:35:36] amen
[1:35:38] you never sinned at the first place God
[1:35:41] don't even know it's in the sea of
[1:35:43] forgetfulness you never did it you were
[1:35:46] accused of it by the accuser but really
[1:35:48] from the beginning you were
[1:35:49] predestinated to be a son or daughter of
[1:35:52] God you're standing there washed
[1:35:55] Hallelujah and your old book of
[1:35:57] divorcement is put away and it's dead
[1:36:00] absolutely out of existence even in the
[1:36:04] mind of God out of existence in God's
[1:36:07] mind that ought to make somebody tonight
[1:36:09] be a little happy and I'm not trying to
[1:36:11] just get you happy but I'm telling you
[1:36:13] this is what the devil doesn't want you
[1:36:16] to find in the book amen he wants you to
[1:36:19] get caught up when what's this and
[1:36:21] what's that and argue over baptisms and
[1:36:24] this is and that's and whatever what we
[1:36:26] need to do is find ourselves in the
[1:36:29] volume of the book and when we find
[1:36:32] ourselves in the book The Devil is going
[1:36:34] to have to sit back and say I don't know
[1:36:36] what to do with them now
[1:36:38] he hasn't been able to do away with this
[1:36:41] book he won't be able to do away with
[1:36:43] this book and the book is open and it's
[1:36:46] not a magic trick that something came
[1:36:48] out let me use you for an example amen
[1:36:51] something came out of the book
[1:36:55] oh they say that's just a spirit you're
[1:36:58] right it's a spirit it's his spirit amen
[1:37:02] anointed your spirit and you believe the
[1:37:05] word and the book being opened changed
[1:37:08] everything
[1:37:09] oh Hallelujah
[1:37:11] oh my is it okay to be excited tonight
[1:37:14] amen You're The Virtuous bride of Christ
[1:37:17] washed in the blood of Christ precious

[1:38:03] I don't understand the physics of that
[1:38:06] I don't understand the physics of that
[1:38:08] amen but the prophet of God used a steel
[1:38:10] mill
[1:38:11] for an example
[1:38:13] and when that great magnet went over
[1:38:16] those steel filings couldn't say I don't
[1:38:19] want to go today
[1:38:20] amen they didn't have a choice
[1:38:22] in fact they had to bolt everything else
[1:38:25] down

[1:46:23] [Music]
[1:46:26] 8 24 really get in
[1:46:28] [Music]
[1:46:30] little inspiration my brother and sister
[1:46:32] you know and when that strikes your
[1:46:34] heart
[1:46:35] I tell you what
[1:46:36] [Music]
[1:46:38] amen reminds me
[1:46:40] long time ago I was actually sitting in
[1:46:42] a truck stop I believe that was Wells
[1:46:45] Nevada
[1:46:46] bored to death wishing I was home but I
[1:46:48] was headed in the wrong direction to go
[1:46:50] home
[1:46:51] there was horse race on the TV
[1:46:54] I'm eating some of their real healthy
[1:46:56] food out of the cabinet there
[1:46:59] and here's this horse race and here's
[1:47:02] this horse out there prancing around and
[1:47:04] the Handler he's getting jerked around
[1:47:06] and the jockey's having a hard time
[1:47:08] staying on it and the announcer is like
[1:47:10] yeah this horse is wasting the energy
[1:47:13] that he would need if he was going to
[1:47:16] win this race and he needs every bit of
[1:47:19] what's got and so we can pretty much
[1:47:21] discount him being a wimp and this horse
[1:47:24] is out there and they finally get him in
[1:47:26] the gate and and he backs out the gate
[1:47:29] and they get him back in the gate and so
[1:47:31] then the announcer's saying yes they're
[1:47:33] saying the next time that his nose
[1:47:34] touches the gate they're going to qual
[1:47:36] that good and so they got him in there
[1:47:39] rushed him in there his nose touched the
[1:47:41] gate they opened it and all the rest of
[1:47:43] them horses saw was dust
[1:47:45] [Music]
[1:47:48] and all the world's going to see of this
[1:47:52] bride
[1:47:53] who's been a little bit excited people
[1:47:56] just get nervous about that he's
[1:47:58] prancing around why don't he just stand
[1:48:00] still he's moving around what's wrong
[1:48:02] with him he's wasting the energy is he
[1:48:06] he's got more than enough energy amen
[1:48:08] this bride's got more than enough to
[1:48:10] take her in a Rapture she's got
[1:48:12] everything she needs she can do a little
[1:48:14] jump and a little shout and a little
[1:48:16] hand waving a lot of singing amen God
[1:48:19] will restore her strength Hallelujah I'm
[1:48:21] sorry about the poor analogy but I just
[1:48:23] remember that Hallelujah poor horse
[1:48:25] using his energy up man he had more
[1:48:28] energy than they ever knew this bride of
[1:48:30] Christ has got more energy than this
[1:48:32] world ever recognized amen they've shout
[1:48:36] they've screamed jumped up and down done
[1:48:38] whatever but that's not the kind of
[1:48:40] energy God placed in the bride amen
[1:48:42] hallelujah

[1:48:47] a maker
