[31:30] the things you know of Life
[31:33] uh you end up cooped in my case I end up
[31:36] cooped in a tractor for for hours upon
[31:40] hours day after day but we don't want to
[31:43] waste that time so we just listen to the
[31:46] prophet just start digging in focusing
[31:49] on what he's saying and and uh listen to
[31:52] those things and I've just in really
[31:55] actually on that side enjoyed uh such a
[31:58] lovely atmosphere to be there by myself
[32:01] and uh just listening to the word I
[32:04] would like to turn tonight to Luke 24
[32:07] starting with verse 32 and uh we're
[32:11] going to just catch this right on the
[32:14] very heels of these brothers on the road
[32:18] to emus and our lord Jesus coming out
[32:20] and talking to them walking with them
[32:24] and uh just want to just to take that
[32:28] right there at verse 32
[32:31] amen um I'll take time just to mention
[32:35] right now that sister Jerry and I will
[32:38] be going to Arizona on the
[32:41] 17th to uh watch can you believe this
[32:44] we're just children and we've got a
[32:47] grandson graduating and it just seems so
[32:51] strange yeah I know Brother David but
[32:54] you're older
[32:58] we don't have to say by how much right
[33:00] but it just but it isn't it strange
[33:02] Brother David just to come to a stage in
[33:04] life and you you you just realize that
[33:06] your children's children are adults and
[33:10] uh it's a shocking position but anyway
[33:13] so we will be gone that weekend I
[33:16] believe of the
[33:17] 17th uh so just wanted to put that out
[33:20] early so it doesn't come as a shock God
[33:23] bless you brother Trevor sister Carrie
[33:25] traveling nomads
[33:30] amen verse 32 and they said one to
[33:34] another did not our heart burn within us
[33:38] and I just want to insert this right now
[33:41] we should be able to say that tonight it
[33:44] won't be about who preached and who led
[33:46] songs but just simply the fact that our
[33:49] lord Jesus is with us so we could say
[33:51] our hearts burned within us while he
[33:54] talked with us by the way and while he
[33:56] opened to us us the scriptures and they
[34:00] rose up the same hour in other words
[34:02] they didn't dially they didn't sit back
[34:03] and say we'll have to ponder this a
[34:05] month or two to see what happens but
[34:07] they returned to Jerusalem and found the
[34:10] 11 gathered together and them that were
[34:12] with them saying the Lord is risen
[34:15] indeed and hath appeared to Simon and
[34:19] they told what things were done in the
[34:21] way and how he was known of them in
[34:24] Breaking of bread now we look at this my
[34:27] brother brother and sister they broke
[34:28] natural bread but we also understand in
[34:31] the scripture that the breaking of bread
[34:33] is spiritual amen so it wasn't just they
[34:37] sat down and ate together but there was
[34:39] something in the atmosphere that changed
[34:42] at that moment and as they thus spake
[34:46] Jesus himself stood in the midst of them
[34:49] and saith unto him them peace be unto
[34:52] you what does the word tell us when we
[34:54] talk about him he draws nigh to us amen
[34:58] my brother and sister they weren't there
[35:00] talking about ESPN
[35:03] sports they weren't there talking about
[35:06] politics they were talking about him and
[35:10] in that conversation he came in their
[35:13] midst oh Lord let's take that as an
[35:16] example let's take that as something
[35:18] that we hold
[35:19] amen but they were terrified and AR
[35:23] frighted and supposed that they had seen
[35:26] a spirit now I just want to interject
[35:28] this right here cuz my thought will go a
[35:30] little different direction I was just
[35:32] listening to the prophet of God chide
[35:35] brandom Tabernacle for being afraid of
[35:40] the presence of God the Holy
[35:43] Spirit I want you to catch this we get
[35:47] ideas that that was the perfect place to
[35:49] go to church how good it would be should
[35:51] move across the country to be there the
[35:53] prophet of God is telling him you're
[35:55] distracted by the world amen now I'm not
[35:59] throwing this back at brandham
[36:01] Tabernacle my brother and sister but I'm
[36:03] telling you the prophet did not have
[36:07] favorites the people he loved he loved
[36:10] them enough to tell them the truth amen
[36:13] aren't you glad that the lord loves us
[36:15] enough to tell us the truth
[36:19] amen they were terrified and frightened
[36:21] supposed that they had seen a spirit and
[36:23] he said unto them why are the ye
[36:25] troubled and why do f arise in your
[36:29] hearts behold my hands and my feet that
[36:33] it is I myself handle me and see for a
[36:38] spirit hath not Flesh and Bones as ye
[36:41] see me have and when he had thus spoken
[36:44] he showed them his hands and his feet
[36:47] and while they yet believe not for joy
[36:51] and wondered he said to them have ye
[36:54] here any
[36:56] meat and they gave him a piece of
[36:59] broiled fish and of honeycomb and he
[37:02] took it and did eat before them and said
[37:04] unto them these are the words which I
[37:07] spake unto you while I was yet with you
[37:11] that all things must be fulfilled which
[37:13] were written in the law of Moses and in
[37:16] the prophets and in the Psalms
[37:18] concerning me amen then opened he their
[37:23] understanding that they might understand
[37:26] the scripture amen Heavenly Father we
[37:29] just thank you Lord as you are so
[37:31] gracious so merciful father Lord we
[37:35] think about all the times we have come
[37:37] short in our lives all the times that we
[37:40] have let thoughts come into our our
[37:43] spirit Lord be affected by the things of
[37:45] this world Lord how many times has the
[37:49] turmoil of the world we live in uh
[37:51] brought an emotion or an influence upon
[37:54] us and sometimes one of Despair some
[37:57] times one of maybe just outright fear
[38:00] father anxieties Lord and all of that we
[38:03] know that Satan would desire to draw us
[38:06] away from our confidence in the word
[38:08] coming to pass but we are here tonight
[38:10] Lord I I pray that you help us just to
[38:13] express this in the fashion father that
[38:15] you laid it upon our heart that it would
[38:17] be real to us to recognize Lord what is
[38:20] happening in our day we thank you your
[38:23] grace your mercy be with each and
[38:24] everyone that is not here tonight be
[38:27] travel or wherever it might be or
[38:29] whatever might have kept them from the
[38:31] house of God we just ask for your
[38:33] presence to be with them strengthen us
[38:36] we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[38:39] you may be
[38:45] seated I'll try to kind of restrain
[38:48] myself a little bit on Sunday I just ran
[38:52] my voice right to the very end and I
[38:55] just kind of had to tone that back a
[38:57] little bit but you know when things burn
[39:00] in your heart you just feel like you got
[39:01] to share them so just a little prayer
[39:04] for me that my voice will will be able
[39:06] to handle this and we'll start with
[39:09] verse 32 and and they said one to
[39:12] another did not our heart burn within us
[39:14] while he talked with us by the way and
[39:17] while he opened to us the scripture and
[39:20] so it was there these brothers amen were
[39:22] walking and uh our lord Jesus was
[39:26] himself preaching to them and and
[39:28] recounting scripture and laying it all
[39:31] and my brother and sister we recognize
[39:34] that in our condition in life our
[39:36] travels our our struggles sometimes uh
[39:39] we're brokenhearted we don't fully
[39:41] understand what God's plan is and you
[39:44] know uh we need someone to preach to us
[39:47] and how much more so that we let the
[39:49] Lord Jesus Christ preach to us amen that
[39:52] we would not look as it would be this is
[39:55] a brother so and so or brother so and so
[39:58] but we would look and realize that
[40:00] Christ himself through the word promised
[40:02] that he would be here today that he
[40:04] would lead us and he would guide us and
[40:06] and the preaching of the word comes and
[40:09] I I tell you just in the last uh few
[40:12] months the preaching of the word has
[40:13] taken on a new Essence in my own heart I
[40:17] I just Rejoice you know now don't
[40:19] misunderstand me but sometimes you'll
[40:21] listen to a sermon and if you're not
[40:23] careful uh uh brother will be preaching
[40:25] his heart out and and we'll we'll say
[40:28] I've heard that I know that I've heard
[40:30] that I know that but how about we stop
[40:33] looking at what we do know and say Lord
[40:36] would you just open what I've already
[40:37] heard amen see these people these
[40:41] brothers I should say not just people
[40:43] have already heard this preached but our
[40:46] lord Jesus has come back on the road to
[40:49] emus to remind them amen not just like
[40:53] yep we heard you say it we heard you say
[40:55] it but when he spoke to them it took on
[40:58] a new life amen and I say Lord just help
[41:01] me sit in the service whenever I would
[41:03] just be in the audience and Lord just
[41:05] let it take on a new life let it not be
[41:08] a thought I've heard this before but let
[41:11] today be the day that the word takes on
[41:13] a new life and changes my understanding
[41:17] my thinking may it take a complex I may
[41:20] be carried and just take it from me May
[41:22] it take something I've questioned in the
[41:24] scripture and just Enlighten it to me
[41:27] because we see my brother and sister
[41:29] these brothers on the road to Emmas were
[41:31] not heathens they were not just fresh to
[41:34] the message but they were men that had
[41:37] heard our lord Jesus speaking and yet
[41:40] they're walking along saying why did
[41:42] this turn out I thought it was to be
[41:44] like this I thought that being a
[41:46] Christian would be a easier walk I
[41:49] thought when the message came from me I
[41:51] would just be able to rise up and say
[41:53] Satan get thee behind me and why is it
[41:56] Satan in essence seems to be mocking me
[41:59] because I can't seem to break
[42:02] through because maybe I need to hear it
[42:04] again that's right maybe as we look and
[42:07] see Jesus never condemned them look I
[42:10] already told you didn't you get it the
[42:12] first time he's there no I'm here to
[42:14] tell you what I've already told you that
[42:17] it must come to pass and now I tell you
[42:20] my brother and sister and one thing that
[42:22] must come to pass is our full
[42:24] comprehension of the word amen amen we
[42:27] can't go with just God sent a prophet
[42:29] it's got to get down at that personal
[42:31] level where before the foundation can I
[42:34] share that for a moment tonight before
[42:36] the foundation of the world God said I'm
[42:39] going to create a little atmosphere and
[42:42] I'm going to place Paul in that
[42:43] atmosphere and Paul is an inferior
[42:46] vessel but he is my
[42:49] vessel can you relate with me and when
[42:53] we come to the place we realize it's not
[42:56] about how great our vessel is but it's
[42:58] the fact that God chose to inhabit that
[43:01] vessel amen that God chose to say you're
[43:04] mine and he put himself in us and
[43:08] claimed us oh hallelujah amen so he's
[43:11] preaching and the word needed to be open
[43:14] and I tell you as we look at this you
[43:17] can see very clearly our ears I'm
[43:20] talking to Believers tonight I'm talking
[43:22] to Sons and Daughters of God our ears
[43:25] still need to be open we didn't have
[43:28] just a complete Revelation that we've
[43:30] heard it but my brother and sister we
[43:31] need him to speak and Lord let my ears
[43:34] be open more than they've ever been
[43:36] before amen let my eyes be opened like
[43:40] never before Lord I want to walk on this
[43:43] road with you Lord and I want to hear
[43:46] what you've got for me I want to see
[43:48] what you've got for me I want to believe
[43:50] what you've got for me and I want to see
[43:53] what that is coming to pass in me that's
[43:56] right
[43:57] in other words
[44:01] magnified
[44:02] [Music]
[44:03] Hallelujah Believers still needed to
[44:06] hear the anointed word
[44:13] amen we all like to talk positive I
[44:15] remember being in some meetings one time
[44:19] and a brother making a great emphasis I
[44:20] understood where he was going but I
[44:22] wondered if a lot of the people did and
[44:25] and he was like you should just never
[44:27] ever never ever walk in a cloud you're
[44:31] believer you're Son of God you should be
[44:33] claiming sunshine and walking in the
[44:35] sunshine all the time and I thought you
[44:38] know what I I believe
[44:42] that but the
[44:44] battle is
[44:47] there we can say Amen to it but the
[44:50] battle's still
[44:51] there
[44:52] [Music]
[44:54] Hallelujah you know yesterday you need
[44:57] day for the weather right it was
[45:00] Idaho and through the day as I'm sitting
[45:02] there in a tractor I alternately had the
[45:05] heater on and the air conditioner on and
[45:08] then I turned the heater back on and
[45:10] before the day was over I had the air
[45:12] conditioner on my brother and sister I
[45:14] hope you catch the analogy that's where
[45:16] we're at sometimes amen heater cold hot
[45:21] cold hot cold hot and God doesn't come
[45:24] and rebuke us on the way he walks with
[45:27] us and opens the word up to us that when
[45:31] we hear we can literally go back in the
[45:33] Fellowship of the brother and say he's
[45:36] alive he's alive he's present he's with
[45:39] us amen I tell you we can be discouraged
[45:42] by circumstance and in just a moment or
[45:46] two have our hearts on fire when he
[45:49] speaks to
[45:50] us sir the word is
[45:55] living it's so interesting my brother
[45:58] and sister I love to read and you know
[46:00] you pick a book up that that you've read
[46:03] before and you'll start to read
[46:06] it and and if the book is a well-written
[46:10] book The Essence of the book will keep
[46:13] your attention to continue to read
[46:17] there's never been a book like this book
[46:19] that's right that can grab our attention
[46:21] but Satan will do everything he can to
[46:24] keep us from even picking the book up
[46:27] because he knows if we pick the book up
[46:29] it will change our circumstance our
[46:32] vision of what is happening around us
[46:35] will no longer be Doom and Gloom what is
[46:37] happening with Russia and Israel and
[46:40] this and this and this I'll tell you
[46:42] what's happening a bride is getting
[46:45] ready and she's on her way out of here
[46:48] amen she's not caught up in what will
[46:51] happen here I seen a little article the
[46:53] other day and this man has done all this
[46:55] research about how they have built
[46:57] detainment camps up in the north amen
[47:01] and I I have no doubt that he's telling
[47:03] the truth you know that this is what's
[47:04] going to happen people that are denters
[47:07] and don't fit in are going to be placed
[47:09] in these camps maybe possibly
[47:12] exterminated and you know you can't help
[47:14] reading something like that without a
[47:16] twinge of
[47:18] apprehension until he comes and walks
[47:21] with us and says all that I told you
[47:25] before in my word must must come to pass
[47:28] everything must come and be set in order
[47:32] nothing can be out of order and if God
[47:35] give it order my brother and sister and
[47:38] we're in God amen in Christ then we
[47:41] don't have to worry about what's
[47:42] Happening Here What's Happening Here
[47:44] What's Happening Here should we buy
[47:46] crypto or gold the currency is going to
[47:48] fail the econom is going away every bit
[47:51] designed to draw the attention of the
[47:54] believer away from the word let's go
[47:57] ahead and walk to EMAs he left us the
[48:00] job is not finished we did not have that
[48:03] Authority and power that he was speaking
[48:05] of we don't see a new kingdom we don't
[48:08] see these things having come to pass
[48:10] what are we going to do and he steps out
[48:12] amen has he stepped out amen I say he
[48:16] has stepped out and he's walking with us
[48:19] tonight and all we've got to do is get
[48:21] back to what he promised
[48:23] us the critic say about William Brandon
[48:26] but I tell you my brother and sister it
[48:28] was God speaking amen amen it's not man
[48:31] speaking it's God
[48:34] speaking
[48:36] amen so they can criticize a
[48:40] man and feel
[48:42] comfortable but if they were standing in
[48:44] the presence of Jesus
[48:46] Christ it would be a different
[48:50] atmosphere or let me take it to another
[48:52] level as the thinking of man if they
[48:54] were standing directly in the presence
[48:56] of God
[48:57] God they would be
[49:00] afraid how's that saying go fools
[49:04] walk with hob nail shoes Where Angels
[49:08] feared to trot but look at the Spirit of
[49:11] the day we're walking we're living in
[49:15] amen let someone pass the
[49:18] way and they'll criticize them very
[49:22] roundly where they would never accept a
[49:25] challenge fac face to
[49:27] face that's the spirit of the
[49:30] age Hallelujah so here we are my brother
[49:33] and sister we might be discouraged by
[49:36] the circumstance but a heart that is on
[49:38] fire amen is a heart that is resistant
[49:42] to Satan's
[49:44] communication amen it is a resistant as
[49:48] our brother said you you know you find
[49:50] yourself on the end of the bridge having
[49:53] a conversation with the
[49:55] devil my brother St I like that comment
[49:59] cuz you see if we're not careful we get
[50:00] in the conversation with the devil don't
[50:02] even realize we're talking to him we
[50:05] just think it's just a normal thing but
[50:08] he's there you're not going to make it I
[50:11] love the song service tonight if felt
[50:13] like it fit with what I was
[50:15] thinking you
[50:18] know
[50:20] we're we're only touching the tip of the
[50:24] iceberg we really are Saints
[50:28] we're here in the
[50:29] flesh maybe it's God's intentional
[50:32] purpose for us to only touch the tip of
[50:34] the iceberg
[50:37] now but do you
[50:40] realize I'm kind of ahead of myself but
[50:42] you we've got so close now it's not
[50:46] Theory anymore and I use the word theory
[50:49] very Loosely I believe you understand
[50:52] me there there's a new Heaven A New
[50:55] Earth wow wow how do we comprehend I
[50:58] tell you how we comprehend we walked
[51:00] this road far enough and he's walked
[51:02] with us far enough when he said I have a
[51:04] home for you a mansion for you we just
[51:08] praise God I've got a mansion that's it
[51:10] not a theory nobody has to prove to me
[51:12] that this going to come to pass this is
[51:14] real now the world's going to say you're
[51:16] crazy but really let's be honest you're
[51:20] on the bus with
[51:21] them they're
[51:25] crazy you don't even have to be
[51:27] spiritual to stop and say this world is
[51:29] going
[51:36] crazy I'm going to say something I hope
[51:38] it's not
[51:40] offensive this is something through the
[51:43] years getting married having a family
[51:47] all the things of life seems like I work
[51:50] way too
[51:51] much I'd still rather be a man
[51:58] come on do you understand
[51:59] me and yet
[52:02] men want to be
[52:05] women I'll bet if they had to go through
[52:07] the whole process they wouldn't want to
[52:12] be and yet sometimes I think oh come on
[52:15] wife you got life good get up cook
[52:17] breakfast I don't know maybe another nap
[52:19] right after that I don't know what she
[52:21] does it's best sometimes just to leave
[52:23] the house and not look back
[52:27] I wouldn't trade two three naps a day
[52:31] for being a
[52:36] woman I told I don't know what I don't
[52:39] know what she
[52:41] does but you see the spirit of the age
[52:45] confusion that's right
[52:48] distraction false communication what do
[52:52] they call those false
[52:54] Flags Satan's throwing them out
[52:57] you realize no new spirits in the land
[52:59] my brother and sister the prophet of God
[53:01] showed us clearly no new Spirits it's
[53:03] not like the Devils had a new spirit out
[53:06] there these Spirits have always been
[53:09] here and we're not going to go into the
[53:11] attribute by which they manifest
[53:13] themselves but the spirit will lump it
[53:15] under this
[53:17] distraction Satan wants to keep us from
[53:20] seeing who we really are and he can
[53:23] throw this out and throw this out and
[53:25] throw this out and it keeps us pulled
[53:28] here and pulled there and we don't see
[53:31] who we are and those two brothers
[53:33] walking down the road to emus were there
[53:36] and could very well without the presence
[53:38] of our Lord Jesus come convince
[53:40] themselves it was
[53:43] finished but he said I'm going to meet
[53:46] you I'll meet you in there amen
[53:50] hallelujah not a little building my
[53:52] brother and sister in that envelop of
[53:55] the Holy Spirit spirit in that realm my
[53:58] brother and sister where he draws you
[54:00] and I into his presence and he filled us
[54:04] with the Holy Ghost can you explain how
[54:06] that
[54:07] happened impossible but it happened and
[54:11] it will happen again and again as as
[54:13] Sons and Daughters of God come to him it
[54:16] will happen again it's not a one-time
[54:18] thing it's happening even in this very
[54:21] moment God wrapping himself around
[54:23] individuals and filling them with his
[54:26] spirit amen hallelujah amen as you look
[54:30] at this they're walking he's opening the
[54:33] word we're walking he's still opening
[54:37] his word amen it's not a closed book
[54:41] that we go back to a reference of what
[54:43] happened you know 2,000 years ago I'm
[54:46] telling you God has walked the aisles of
[54:48] this church in the lives of Sons and
[54:51] Daughters of God almost every service I
[54:54] can testify of something that has
[54:56] happened and we should be saying Lord I
[54:59] want my portion I'm not going to sit
[55:01] here and I'm not going to be sitting on
[55:03] the Pew just as an observer I am a
[55:06] participant I am the one the word is
[55:09] talking about I am the life that was
[55:12] declared to be changed I will be
[55:16] changed
[55:18] Hallelujah I didn't even have them put
[55:21] this on the screen but it's out of now
[55:23] I'm going to I'm going to put a little
[55:24] disclaimer not disclaim claimer that's
[55:26] not right a little deal uh um you know a
[55:29] few Services ago that brother Chris
[55:31] preached he he spoke a quote out of this
[55:33] service a deceived Church by the world
[55:36] and and it got my interest and I thought
[55:38] I want to listen to that service that
[55:40] sermon amen and it's very good if you
[55:43] guys will accept a homework assignment I
[55:45] would encourage you to listen to it it's
[55:47] very straightforward no beating around
[55:49] that bush that bush got turned into a tu
[55:52] and got hauled away amen so it's there
[55:55] that God wants us not to beat around the
[55:57] bush he wants us to recognize because we
[56:01] don't even have a clue how
[56:03] slippery the devil is he's so
[56:08] Sly not going to curse him we're going
[56:10] to expose him
[56:12] yeah no no good to stand back and say oh
[56:16] devil get go this that listen to me I
[56:19] command you the devil just sits
[56:23] back who are you
[56:27] but when you've got the
[56:29] word he just doesn't know what to do
[56:31] with the word because it exposes
[56:34] him but you know what happens the devil
[56:38] gets people to thinking if the word
[56:40] exposes it's exposing me no it's not
[56:44] it's exposing the devil that's exactly
[56:46] right amen you're a son or daughter of
[56:48] God but the devil so wraps us up in this
[56:52] false who we
[56:54] are that we think that's us us that's
[56:57] right now brother Brown says here just
[56:59] this is a little excerpt just drawn out
[57:01] of this the success of the church lies
[57:05] within the preaching of the Gospel of
[57:08] the power of God Amen that's short and
[57:12] sweet isn't it we probably could just
[57:14] say s now and let's sing a song or two
[57:16] and dismiss right there because I'm
[57:18] telling you my brother and sister I want
[57:20] Grace Tabernacle my heart and I want
[57:23] Grace Tabernacle to be a successful
[57:25] Church the prophet of God typing this in
[57:28] in this sermon is is not the size of the
[57:31] steeple it's not the size of the choir
[57:33] it's not the amount of the people that
[57:35] are in the congregation or how educated
[57:38] the preacher is but it's how much
[57:41] Liberty the Holy Ghost has to move in
[57:45] our lives to change our
[57:48] life and there's times that I truly
[57:51] believe in the humor as it were if you
[57:54] want to call it that of God when he said
[57:56] it's by the foolishness of preaching
[57:59] because we
[58:00] preach I think Brother David brother
[58:02] Chris would agree we preach and
[58:04] sometimes you feel foolish afterwards
[58:06] well why did I say it like that that
[58:08] wasn't the really the way that I I
[58:10] thought would but that's the way God
[58:12] wanted it to be and so therefore it's by
[58:15] the foolishness of the
[58:18] preaching let's hit verse 35 and we'll
[58:21] kind of go on there
[58:23] now they were told that things were were
[58:26] done in the way they shared a testimony
[58:29] and how he was known at the breaking of
[58:32] the bread amen as I said before that's
[58:35] twofold right spiritual natural and as
[58:38] they thus spake Jesus himself stood in
[58:41] the midst of them and said unto them
[58:42] peace be unto you my brother and sister
[58:45] let's be honest we can read the
[58:46] scripture and say well what kind of
[58:48] Revelation they had same kind you have
[58:50] if our lord Jesus stood right here
[58:53] visible form tonight we would probably
[58:55] be shocked be stunned be be whatever
[58:59] because it would be something that's so
[59:01] far out of our own
[59:04] senses but he's here amen absolutely
[59:07] right he's here he just chooses to
[59:10] reveal himself
[59:19] where the devil would want you to say oh
[59:22] he wouldn't do that he sure would that's
[59:25] right that's what his word says that's
[59:27] right he sure would am so he's here to
[59:31] reveal himself to you and I tonight but
[59:35] yet we would be shocked if we visibly
[59:36] saw
[59:37] him right that's just that human element
[59:41] it's who we are it's how it works amen
[59:44] so he stands in the midst of them he
[59:46] says peace they're terrified they're
[59:48] frighted seeing a spirit and he says
[59:50] unto them why are you troubled and why
[59:53] do thoughts arise in your hearts what
[59:55] was he doing do he knew the very
[59:58] reaction and now I'm just going to go
[1:00:00] off on a limb I hope you don't mind some
[1:00:02] of them would be
[1:00:05] like before I come to Jesus we were into
[1:00:08] spiritualism and oh
[1:00:12] my another would
[1:00:16] be my mind was in the wrong
[1:00:19] place and I realized he knew where my
[1:00:23] mind was
[1:00:24] at every everyone had a different reason
[1:00:28] but the truth of it was Jesus didn't
[1:00:30] turn it was within his ability to say
[1:00:33] you've got a spirit you've done this
[1:00:35] you've done that um as it were he's
[1:00:38] without sin go ahead and cast the first
[1:00:42] stone and he says don't don't be
[1:00:44] afraid don't let that in your
[1:00:47] heart it is
[1:00:50] I it is I they knew him
[1:00:54] Saints but it was so far out of the
[1:00:56] realm I tell you what that's why
[1:00:58] denomination today well they have to
[1:01:00] fulfill their portion of scripture but
[1:01:02] that's why denomination today cannot
[1:01:04] deal with this is because they've got
[1:01:07] Christ in a box of History that's
[1:01:11] right they've got him firm firmly
[1:01:14] wrapped up in the Box nailed shut of
[1:01:16] history with a declaration of what he
[1:01:18] would and would not
[1:01:19] do I always find it interesting that
[1:01:22] people talk about what God meant when
[1:01:25] they have not a clue of God Amen well
[1:01:29] this is what he means really you need to
[1:01:31] know Christ first and even then his ways
[1:01:35] are higher than our
[1:01:39] ways behold my hands and my
[1:01:43] feet go ahead handle
[1:01:46] me he was not afraid he wanted them to
[1:01:51] see but I tell you what my brother and
[1:01:53] sister if you can just step over another
[1:01:55] step with me here I want to handle
[1:01:58] him I want to handle him amen I'm not a
[1:02:02] doubting Thomas I want to handle him you
[1:02:04] know what that means to handle him
[1:02:05] you've got to get close up close and
[1:02:08] personal you have to almost as it were
[1:02:11] meld or merge or be bound with him amen
[1:02:15] I think it's time we as a church get
[1:02:17] afraid get away from being afraid of
[1:02:19] handling amen our Lord Jesus Christ be a
[1:02:23] uh get over the fear of handling the
[1:02:26] word and having confidence of what the
[1:02:28] word is in you and I and to be so
[1:02:30] intimate with him that we can actually
[1:02:33] say I have been in his
[1:02:36] presence I've been touched by him and he
[1:02:39] has touched
[1:02:41] me and I have touched
[1:02:44] him how is that brother Paul because we
[1:02:47] have a high priest that can be touched
[1:02:49] by the feeling of our infirmity so that
[1:02:52] means we're touching him with our hearts
[1:02:56] cry with the need of our life with the
[1:02:58] things of family and relationship and
[1:03:01] our own spiritual health we can touch
[1:03:03] him my brother and sister we're not here
[1:03:06] hoping that he just comes by on a whim
[1:03:08] to touch us one day but he is responding
[1:03:12] to
[1:03:13] us amen look on me handle me wrap your
[1:03:17] arms around me see that I'm present with
[1:03:20] you
[1:03:21] amen you see he was the revealed word
[1:03:25] that's right
[1:03:26] people are afraid of the revealed word I
[1:03:29] I hope this isn't too rough too critical
[1:03:33] there's people that name the name of the
[1:03:35] message are afraid of the revealed
[1:03:39] word because remember where there's fire
[1:03:43] there's cleansing amen some are afraid
[1:03:46] to come to the fire that's right and
[1:03:48] some are
[1:03:50] willing let let there be more Shadrach
[1:03:52] mesach and Abednego of this day what is
[1:03:55] it
[1:03:56] they're sending me to the fire no
[1:03:59] problem they weren't thinking about
[1:04:01] Christ meeting them in the fire they
[1:04:03] were thinking about I'm ready to meet
[1:04:06] Christ and if I have to pass through the
[1:04:08] fire to meet him I'm ready to go through
[1:04:11] the fire but he saw their faith he saw
[1:04:14] their heart he saw the desire and he
[1:04:16] knew his word and he met them in the
[1:04:19] fire and you tell me science will tell
[1:04:21] you can't happen
[1:04:26] but I'll put this word of God above
[1:04:28] science any day of the
[1:04:29] week amen oh Hallelujah so they were
[1:04:33] they were a little shocked you know of
[1:04:36] what was going on and I hope you don't
[1:04:38] mind but when I was studying this I had
[1:04:40] just a little bit of humor come up in me
[1:04:42] and and Jesus is talking to them so
[1:04:45] sincere and they're trying to deal
[1:04:47] they're coping digesting their anxiety
[1:04:50] and their fear and they're looking there
[1:04:52] and realizing this is the Lord Jesus
[1:04:55] Christ
[1:04:56] and he is here in our midst and then he
[1:04:58] says you got any
[1:05:05] food is that what he said brother
[1:05:09] Trevor
[1:05:11] wow what was he doing he was proving to
[1:05:14] them am that when he said I know the
[1:05:18] feelings of your
[1:05:20] infirmities he was
[1:05:23] hungry he was hungry
[1:05:26] he's connected to us
[1:05:28] Saints he's not a god floating out in
[1:05:31] ether land just seeing if we can perform
[1:05:33] like some kind of circus act no sir he
[1:05:36] feels the feeling of our
[1:05:41] infirmity now
[1:05:44] hallelujah amen so he eats the fish in
[1:05:46] the
[1:05:47] honeycomb and then he reminds them look
[1:05:50] this is a time that's a little bit of
[1:05:51] chiding he reminds them I've already
[1:05:54] told you all this
[1:05:57] do you guys ever hear the preacher I
[1:06:00] just preached on this but we're going to
[1:06:02] preach on it again that's right I
[1:06:04] already told you this when I was walking
[1:06:07] or with you before
[1:06:12] sir but because you guys are probably
[1:06:14] sleeping and distracted and thinking
[1:06:16] about your bank account and thinking
[1:06:17] about your car going to the shop and
[1:06:19] thinking about this and thinking about
[1:06:20] that you missed it that's right he
[1:06:23] doesn't say a single word about that
[1:06:26] that's right he just comes and says I've
[1:06:28] already told you that here it is
[1:06:32] again aren't you glad amen I can tell
[1:06:36] you right now I'm standing here tonight
[1:06:37] so thankful amen that the Lord didn't
[1:06:40] say you didn't listen the first time
[1:06:41] you're out that's right cuz I would be
[1:06:44] out amen right come on I I you know I've
[1:06:48] shared my testimony a fair amount
[1:06:50] through the years here at the church
[1:06:52] other places but there's a lot I left
[1:06:55] out
[1:06:56] because it doesn't
[1:06:57] edify it doesn't give any encouragement
[1:07:01] but I'll tell you of that portion the
[1:07:03] fact that God loves us enough he come
[1:07:06] back and said come
[1:07:08] on am come onise the Lord and I still
[1:07:11] told him no and he come back and said
[1:07:14] come on come on and if he didn't do that
[1:07:18] I would be
[1:07:19] lost but he does it amen and I say thank
[1:07:24] you Lord hallelujah
[1:07:26] and he tells them these words I spake
[1:07:27] unto you while I was yet with you that
[1:07:30] all things must be fulfilled that ought
[1:07:32] to give us joy my brother and sister
[1:07:34] because there's not one portion that
[1:07:36] politics and world wars and whatever
[1:07:39] else can
[1:07:41] supersede it must all be
[1:07:44] fulfilled amen what's written in the law
[1:07:47] of Moses and in the prophets and in the
[1:07:49] Psalms concerning me in other words
[1:07:52] everything in this book concerning
[1:07:54] Christ must be fulfilled amen
[1:07:59] hallelujah and we have that word tonight
[1:08:01] Saints that's right we're not looking at
[1:08:03] history we're not looking back there
[1:08:05] we're looking at the word is being
[1:08:07] spoken not through Paul tonight but
[1:08:10] through Christ to his church again the
[1:08:13] same word the same promise the same
[1:08:17] reminder so let's not be distracted amen
[1:08:21] you know there's a sub subtle very
[1:08:24] subtle side move in the
[1:08:26] message and it's called
[1:08:30] denomination and you'd say that's not
[1:08:32] very subtle but it is it is it is
[1:08:35] because it's what causes us I won't do
[1:08:38] it but it causes us sit down on the Pew
[1:08:41] on our
[1:08:44] hands
[1:08:46] because I'm just supposed to be
[1:08:52] here well the church can run without you
[1:08:57] someone will say
[1:08:58] Amen someone will believe it that's
[1:09:01] right the church can run without you if
[1:09:04] you think that's the only purpose God
[1:09:06] had for you in this great Universe
[1:09:08] before the foundation of the world was
[1:09:10] okay the first 50 he'll go to church no
[1:09:13] sir he chose us amen he chose us Saints
[1:09:17] let's get that in our head he chose us
[1:09:21] amen and the devil wants to distract you
[1:09:24] and this little deal let's refocus on
[1:09:26] the message that's right let's refocus
[1:09:28] on the message it really is not about
[1:09:30] the prophet well they're not wrong but
[1:09:34] they're not right because the prophet of
[1:09:37] God also shows us out of the scripture
[1:09:40] that Christ looks down in the very
[1:09:42] motive that's right of our heart that's
[1:09:45] right so what's their
[1:09:48] motive if you can get the prophet
[1:09:52] out we're much more acceptable
[1:09:57] we can go witness with the best of them
[1:10:00] of Miracles and signs and all these
[1:10:02] things just get a profit out of your
[1:10:05] sermon and the world will accept
[1:10:12] you it's happening
[1:10:15] yeah the
[1:10:18] military
[1:10:19] sanitizes their Public
[1:10:23] Communication we're going to to just be
[1:10:25] doing a little
[1:10:28] operation killing a few people blowing
[1:10:31] up a few things they sanitize it that it
[1:10:35] sounds like they're doing a Boy Scout
[1:10:37] job in the
[1:10:38] neighborhood Satan wants to sanitize
[1:10:41] this message so that it is like we're
[1:10:44] just while he's out killing destroying
[1:10:48] pillaging
[1:10:50] plundering Souls see trying to refocus
[1:10:54] us
[1:10:55] it's a
[1:10:57] distraction we need the
[1:11:00] reminder we need the reminder same
[1:11:03] reminder Jesus gave them we need the
[1:11:05] reminder amen Can someone say we need
[1:11:07] the
[1:11:08] reminder amen stir up our pure hearts in
[1:11:11] remembrance amen now I love this verse
[1:11:14] 45 we're getting down to the end here
[1:11:17] then he opened then opened he their
[1:11:20] understanding that they might understand
[1:11:22] the scripture you know the world if they
[1:11:25] hear this tape tonight would think I was
[1:11:27] just some kind of arrogant kind of
[1:11:29] person but I tell you I rub shoulders
[1:11:31] with a lot of people and I'm getting
[1:11:34] older and Boulder it scares me I'm
[1:11:35] acting more like my dad that means I'm
[1:11:38] talking at the grocery store just
[1:11:40] checking out and I just ask people
[1:11:43] questions that probably polite people
[1:11:45] wouldn't ask them uh yeah what happened
[1:11:47] to your
[1:11:54] face oh all they have to do is say I'd
[1:11:56] rather not talk about it but what they
[1:11:59] do do is tell you I was in a car
[1:12:02] accident I almost
[1:12:04] died oh my did your church pray for you
[1:12:09] I don't go to
[1:12:11] church why
[1:12:12] not you see it's not the question it's
[1:12:15] how you presented that's
[1:12:18] right if you don't go to church you're
[1:12:20] going to
[1:12:21] hell at least that's what our church
[1:12:23] teaches
[1:12:27] no you tell
[1:12:28] them I wished I would have known of
[1:12:32] course I haven't been in alberon for a
[1:12:34] year but I would have prayed for you and
[1:12:38] they look at you like you would
[1:12:40] have yes I I would
[1:12:44] have you see because there's a deep
[1:12:47] longing in the hearts of men
[1:12:50] kind prophet of God talks about how it's
[1:12:53] not the alcohol the alcoh
[1:12:56] is their way of trying to deal with
[1:12:59] something
[1:13:02] else these things the dancing all these
[1:13:05] things that's just trying to deal with
[1:13:07] something else
[1:13:09] amen but we have an open book we have
[1:13:12] the word we have life my brother and
[1:13:14] sister I hope I'm not preaching too
[1:13:16] straight to you tonight but we opened
[1:13:19] our understanding Can someone say my
[1:13:21] understanding has been open amen I'm not
[1:13:24] boasting I'm not bragging I'm just
[1:13:26] acknowledging the truth that I can talk
[1:13:29] and look at the word and you realize
[1:13:32] those around you this might sound
[1:13:33] arrogant but those around you have a
[1:13:36] glossed over view of the
[1:13:40] Gospel you know when they said years ago
[1:13:42] that Mark 16 the latter portion was not
[1:13:45] inspired the world believes it but I'm
[1:13:47] sorry we met a word that was inspired
[1:13:50] and it said that he was our healer and
[1:13:53] he discerned the thoughts and intent of
[1:13:55] our hearts you're too late devil you're
[1:13:58] too late world to tell me God doesn't
[1:14:00] care enough about us to discern our
[1:14:03] heart and come and heal our bodies amen
[1:14:07] there's way too many healings I've
[1:14:09] experienced it myself Amen to sit here
[1:14:13] today and think oh I maybe God won't
[1:14:16] heal maybe that is maybe that no my
[1:14:19] brother and sister let's stand up and
[1:14:21] say My God Is A Healer I believe every
[1:14:24] drop of it and devil I don't care if
[1:14:26] this flesh never gets healed my God Is A
[1:14:29] Healer they'll say that's Insanity
[1:14:37] welcome see where we stand Jesus Christ
[1:14:41] once again is walking in our midst amen
[1:14:44] he's talking to us we're on our road to
[1:14:47] emus he's talking to us and he's
[1:14:50] speaking and he's opening the word and
[1:14:53] he's reminding us do you realize a lot
[1:14:56] of preaching of the Gospel is just
[1:14:59] really as simple as a
[1:15:01] reminder we read we
[1:15:04] hear and sometimes we just need to be
[1:15:09] reminded you know when I was a young
[1:15:12] man I lived kind of all over the place
[1:15:15] for a while
[1:15:19] there I didn't always hang out with the
[1:15:22] best of characters
[1:15:28] they say you want to go get a drink
[1:15:30] we'll get some beer go to the
[1:15:35] lake you see they would have thought I
[1:15:38] was
[1:15:40] crazy but when they would say that a
[1:15:43] little recorder kicked on started
[1:15:51] playing otherwise this flesh would have
[1:15:53] went with them
[1:15:57] yes and when you get in positions I
[1:16:00] wouldn't never share that in church I
[1:16:02] haven't even really shared it too much
[1:16:03] to the whole world maybe one of these
[1:16:05] days I will the right place right time
[1:16:08] to see the major disaster That You Don't
[1:16:12] See
[1:16:13] coming and God closes the gate puts the
[1:16:18] chain around it puts the padle loock on
[1:16:22] it
[1:16:25] and says
[1:16:31] no right yeah I'll give you just a
[1:16:34] little hint I was offered a job many
[1:16:36] years ago as a Young Man pretty
[1:16:38] aggressive in that stage of my life to
[1:16:41] become a job
[1:16:43] superintendent the job was to take place
[1:16:45] in the Grand Canyon and it paid
[1:16:48] incredibly well and would open a door to
[1:16:51] this massive construction company that
[1:16:55] uh did a lot of government
[1:16:57] work everything about it looked like
[1:17:00] that's the future that's wonderful
[1:17:03] except for I couldn't get the gate
[1:17:07] open and I look back now and say thank
[1:17:11] you Lord
[1:17:12] amen thank you Lord that you put a big
[1:17:15] enough lock and a big enough chain that
[1:17:17] I could not get through that because it
[1:17:21] would have been such a mar in my life
[1:17:28] amen what has happened he's
[1:17:32] come we can use this in both ways would
[1:17:35] be correct we can say he has opened up
[1:17:40] our understanding that would be correct
[1:17:43] right yes
[1:17:45] sir the words or the way I prefer he is
[1:17:50] opening up our understanding it didn't
[1:17:54] just open for moment that's right and
[1:17:56] then that was like you know oh that's
[1:18:00] finished ongoing he's still walking with
[1:18:04] us he's still telling us why he came and
[1:18:08] the reasons and all of the things that
[1:18:11] happened and I don't know about you that
[1:18:12] there's things in my life that that I
[1:18:14] don't understand why they happened but
[1:18:16] they're decreasing in numbers because as
[1:18:19] I go further down this road I seeing
[1:18:22] more and more of why God closes that
[1:18:25] door close that door close that
[1:18:28] door Hallelujah I I don't want to drag
[1:18:31] this out tonight we're just almost done
[1:18:33] so if musician sister via if you would
[1:18:36] come amen musicians amen so look what he
[1:18:40] did is he opened his word to remind us
[1:18:42] once again do we need that I say I need
[1:18:45] it amen he's opened our understanding
[1:18:47] and I'll tell you what we need to
[1:18:49] understand the word for our hour you see
[1:18:52] it's not just about brother brandham or
[1:18:54] God sent a prophet and so many focus on
[1:18:56] that it's got to be about the prophet no
[1:18:58] my brother and sister it's about the
[1:19:00] word being open to you and I and if the
[1:19:03] word's not open to you and I none of the
[1:19:05] rest of this is going to matter we might
[1:19:07] as well go be a whatever and it's there
[1:19:10] but God said no you're mine you're mine
[1:19:13] can I say it again you're mine I'll
[1:19:16] prove it to you you're
[1:19:19] mine but I've got problems you're
[1:19:23] mine I failed you you're
[1:19:31] mine let me deviate just a second this
[1:19:34] really struck me
[1:19:39] listening so here's
[1:19:41] Samson this portion of all of this is so
[1:19:45] incredible when you read it how brother
[1:19:47] brandham ties it back in and that's why
[1:19:49] I encourage you to listen to this
[1:19:52] sermon but here's Samson my brother and
[1:19:55] sister he
[1:19:56] flirted with Delilah she's the
[1:20:00] world do you love
[1:20:04] me where's your strength it's what I was
[1:20:07] going thought I was preaching on
[1:20:11] tonight where's your
[1:20:17] strength well I know what the word says
[1:20:20] but you
[1:20:22] know it's here
[1:20:25] Samson the Philistines come bounds up
[1:20:30] breaks everything I thought you said you
[1:20:32] love
[1:20:33] [Music]
[1:20:34] me again and again brother Brown ties it
[1:20:37] right in beautiful through the church
[1:20:40] age coming right up and ties it in
[1:20:43] beautiful but you know what happened was
[1:20:47] in Delilah's final seduction in other
[1:20:49] words uh uh Samson played
[1:20:53] around to the point that he really
[1:20:57] poured his heart
[1:20:59] out and Delilah took his heart and rung
[1:21:03] it and rendered it as though it was
[1:21:07] nothing left him empty and
[1:21:13] sightless for a little gold and if you
[1:21:16] don't think the world won't trade you
[1:21:17] and I for a little gold then we've got a
[1:21:20] lot to learn but I love this what
[1:21:24] brother Brandon broke
[1:21:27] down while
[1:21:29] Samson was in
[1:21:32] prison no
[1:21:35] peir but the Nazarite
[1:21:37] vow was still upon
[1:21:40] him and while he's in prison and they're
[1:21:44] rejoicing in their conquering of this
[1:21:47] soul I love how it comes out on the tape
[1:21:51] a little
[1:21:52] hair popped out
[1:21:57] and God honored that little bit of Faith
[1:22:02] oh doesn't that make your heart so soft
[1:22:05] oh we think if I had more faith if I had
[1:22:07] more faith just have God's faith amen we
[1:22:11] don't need to measure Faith by how we
[1:22:13] measure Faith let it be measured by
[1:22:16] God's measure and in that time of
[1:22:19] repentance that little hair bound out
[1:22:21] and God said there's The Vow coming back
[1:22:25] once again because if he hadn't knocked
[1:22:28] down the palace if he has his life had
[1:22:31] not been taken from him he would have
[1:22:33] never voluntarily let them cut his hair
[1:22:37] again because he had revelation of what
[1:22:40] it was in the
[1:22:47] beginning can you see
[1:22:49] it can you see
[1:22:52] it I needed to be this and God says you
[1:22:56] just need to start right here amen I
[1:22:59] knew this but I still did it just start
[1:23:03] right here just come back to the point
[1:23:05] you can say Lord I accept it I am yours
[1:23:11] oh
[1:23:12] hallelujah amen I'll tell you what my
[1:23:15] brother and sister we talked how many
[1:23:17] times we've heard ourselves saying if I
[1:23:20] just had more faith well I tell you what
[1:23:22] why don't we just acknowledge of faith
[1:23:25] that God has given us that Faith he's
[1:23:28] given us is
[1:23:31] sufficient
[1:23:34] amen it's sufficient my brother and
[1:23:37] sister take the shackles off of it
[1:23:41] hallelujah look how close we're coming
[1:23:43] to the
[1:23:45] end you know when we were on that tour
[1:23:48] in Israel remember we were up there
[1:23:51] where all of those uh hole in the
[1:23:55] mountain they had the stone troughs for
[1:23:58] the horses
[1:24:00] and that armag again I couldn't remember
[1:24:03] if that was exactly the name but MTO
[1:24:07] there that's what I was in my mind
[1:24:08] fishing for but right there in the
[1:24:10] valley right below it's scriptural it's
[1:24:13] where armageddon's going to take place
[1:24:16] now my brother and sister we could sit
[1:24:18] on that
[1:24:19] rock on those on those
[1:24:23] artifacts till we were old and gray and
[1:24:25] fell
[1:24:26] over and Armageddon might not come it
[1:24:30] might be just a day beyond our
[1:24:34] life we could look for proof that
[1:24:37] armageddon's going to take
[1:24:39] place but I'm here today to offer you
[1:24:43] sufficient truth that we weren't called
[1:24:46] to witness
[1:24:47] Armageddon we're not called to be there
[1:24:50] when we see the valley full of blood the
[1:24:54] blood that matters to us has already
[1:24:57] come it's already on us amen don't let
[1:25:01] it be washed away don't let it be taken
[1:25:04] away receive it act on it amen because
