everybody he's here and there's everyone lots of people are missing him but somehow you have eyes that are a little bit different than theirs it's not somehow it's by God's grace and he's preordination amen thank you musicians brother Alex for the song [Music] service my nerves say sing another song but we're gonna we're going to turn into the word tonight Matthew chapter 22 it's good to be here tonight in House of God you know I think uh I think we take ourselves a little too serious in general and the word of God not serious enough these are the literal words of God yeah praise the Lord Matthew chapter 22:1 15 says then went the Pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians saying Master we know that thou art true and teachest the way of God in truth neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest not the person of men they are underestimated the holy spirit's ability to discern the hearts and thought they'd sugarcoat their words but he knew exactly what they were there for tell us therefore what thinkest thou is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar or not but Jesus perceived their wickedness and said why tempt ye me you Hypocrites now you have to remember Jesus had no malice he had no gu so when he said these words he wasn't spitting back at them he was simply calling out exactly who they were and a real child of God would hear those words and immediately go to repenting yeah that's how God speaks to us he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't um accuse us he points out where our weaknesses are and he does so in such a way that he can call you a hypocrite to your face oh God forgive me right cuz there's love in how he's portraying that so even even in his verdict to them there was an opportunity for them to respond back and say oh you know what you're right I'm sorry you you keep talking says show me the tribute money and they brought unto him a penny and he said unto them who is this image and superscription they say unto him Caesars then saith he unto them render therefore unto Caesars the thing that excuse me render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesars and unto God the things that are Gods when they had heard these words they marveled and left him and went their way the same day came him came to him the Sadducees so big day big day which say that there is no resurrection and asked him saying Master Moses said said if a man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother now there were with us seven Brethren now see Jesus is very familiar with the story first not not only because he is literally God in flesh but because this is in his lineage right you had uh judah's Sons married um that that lady I can't remember her name right now but tamaron right and was supposed to raise up the seed right so Jesus is very familiar with this he understands exactly where they're going I'm sure everyone else there listening did too now there were with us seven Brethren and the first when he had married a wife deceased and having no issue left his wife unto his brother likewise the second also and the Third on down un third unto the seventh last of all the woman died also very realistic situation therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven for they all had her Jesus answered and said unto him you do error not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels of God in heaven but as touching the resurrection of the Dead have you not read that which was spoken unto you by God saying I am the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob God is not the god of the dead but of the living lengthy reading but just hang on and when the multitude heard this they were astonished at his Doctrine so Pharisees come to him and they challenge him on on on paying your taxes and then the sadu es come to him and challenge him on the resurrection this is their favorite topic to debate because they didn't believe in the resurrection and now the Pharisees ver verse 34 they heard that he put the Sadducees to silence so they gathered back together they said well you know what we could we got to do better than the Sadducees so then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying Master what is the great commandment in the law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets so he he stumped them again and while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them so now he turns and he brings the word back to them so now Jesus is not is not in engaging in a in in a debate the devil is trying to undermine the sermon of the day by sending the Sadducees and the Pharisees or the Pharisees Sadducees and the Pharisees again so now Jesus turns and rebukes the devil to leave and he says what think ye of Christ whose son is he they say unto him the son of David hey we got this one easy he says unto them them how then do David in spirit call him Lord saying the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy foot stol if David then call him Lord how is he his son and no man was able to answer him a word neither Durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord I pray you minister to our hearts tonight Lord we have no desire to make anything of ourselves we just simply have come to hear your word to share your word Lord to receive the life that your word has in it Lord I ask you just push aside every spirit that would be contrary to your word May the Holy Spirit take full control tonight and you just minister to us may there just be an atmosphere father of your presence here tonight we ask we love you Lord we thank you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated tonight thank you for standing for that reading I tried to to to cut it where I could but I wanted to bring these these three different situations this story and and how Jesus handled this and you know if you think about it um you you have to remember he was he was all God and He was all man and in his ministry he put up with a lot he dealt with a lot and you know I believe it's Paul says you know next time you think you have to deal with a lot remember what Jesus had to deal with deal with right in so many words and so I wanted to look tonight and my title is um positional positional character and uh my subtitle is position position by invitation but I I have this I had this line in my notes and as I was meditating on what to minister tonight the Lord directed me here and so if I could say that the the subject or the thesis or of the the point tonight that we want to look at is that it it's the character of the person that makes the position the position does not make the person so for example in our world if you take a man who off the street and he he can't hold the job he can't and he has not disciplined enough to keep himself clean and keep himself away from from drugs and and alcohol and and he's just a mess and you clean him up and you make him the CEO of Apple guess what couple days he'll be back on the street right so even though you gave him the position it didn't change him so when it comes to being a Son of God God has to mold your character for the position he's calling you to so there is no you know when brother talks about adoption you're born right you you receive the new birth and he gives you the Holy Spirit to be the inward teacher the tutor to come unto adoption because you're not born and immediately now you're ready for a position you have no character right so you need character for your position and we all hold a unique position in the body of Christ so my character molding is going to look different than titus's character molding now there'll be some situations that are similar right you know my dad believed in spanking titus's dad believed in spanking right so there's similar things that God that the Lord does as he moves us along but how it comes to us how we receive it how we see it through our perspective is all very very different you know we're we're we all come to church tonight and and there's you know I don't know how many people are tonight I'm terrible at at guessing people but maybe about 20 of us here you you think about the the individuals that each of us have touched down to the youngest each of us have touched In Our Lifetime those are those are experiences to each individual so you say oh there's only 20 people here but each one of you has an entire world an entire story an entire I mean history that has just touched and and moved and and you know especially you know brother Paul and Brother David traveling around this opportunities and exposures and things that has come together and all of these do something to your character now we want those experiences to impact our character in a positive way but how it impact your character whether positive or negative is actually your choice God put you through a situation and he's looking to to to to cut this part of your of your flesh and this this part of you to mold your character in a certain way from this angle so he put you through a situation now how much of that gets chipped off is your abilities to surrender to him so when you come to a situation and you surrender to him and you're just ready and you're wide open God gets a good chunk off of you if I can have the Liberty to say so but when you resist and and you're caught up here and caught up there then God has to come from another angle another angle to swing around to come at you now God had this already all planned out don't think God's out there guessing think well do I hit here or do I hit here no he had this all planned out before there was even a speck of dust in the universe he knew exactly how your character would be molded but you see we we he gave us a free moral agency so we have the ability to choose how we approach a situation how we approach an invitation to mle our character now let's go to this quote here I know I had the scriptures there but uh this a first quote to see Jesus he said hold on I changed the order and then now I'm going to go back to the first order I had so it's the last quote there Gideon identification he said where would you be identified at that time now W with your character that's molded in you I'm sorry okay I'm trying to find a have a quote here let's see here just give me one second it's worth it hang on okay sorry identification 64 um it will be the second quote there and his character was that he did everything that pleased God so we're back to Jesus now because we read this story this these altercations that Jesus had and that that's a glimpse into into the stress and and the intensity that he had to deal with in his min hisory and all of this was was completely pre-ordained I mean it was ready to be written in the scriptures when it would happen God anointed Matthew to write it down so this was all a part of God's plan but it's it's an everything he experienced he experienced purposefully for you and I and so he says here brother says here he says and his character was that he did everything that pleased God and he stayed with the word so he comes up I mean you you sometimes you know you deal with people and and and in my how I work you know it's it's on a call or a video call or messaging and and you pulling your hair out sometimes trying to communicate clearly to somebody and and just you lose your patience and nobody knows it because you're thankfully behind a camera with a muted mic and just that and then you put it back on and says oh yes you know so we have the opportunity for that but he's right there in this moment everybody's watching everybody's looking at him I to slow down a little bit for our interpreter and he has to keep it all together he's got to keep his patience because he's he's dealing we heard it the other night somebody said stop worrying about the chickens if you're an eagle stop worrying about the chickens worry about the Eagles so he had to have the patience to deal with these these people because in those moments right that is a testimony to those that are around him so having the patience and the character to to to stand these he had he had to be God to make it this way he'd be perfect so he stayed right with the word that's the point I'm trying to make he stayed in the will of God in these moments and he says he goes on to say he says that's what he molds us for if we'd stay with God's word find our place and then know where we we were at stay with his word and think of it we are invited now this is why it's the position by invitation we are invited to shape our own character to his we are not required we are not demanded we are invited to shape our character to his own so guess what sometimes we go through trials and we fail them and God has to do it over again but you see he has the patience to deal with that if you had the patience for a bunch of hypocrites kind the patience for his own children so you see God has God is asking you he's given you the and wh why why because you have a position he wants you to hold to he wants your name to be as good on the check as his but you have to have the character for that position first you can't just come out and and suddenly right you have to have the character you have to be that son that son he was bornn he was a son but he needed a tutor to come to a position now where he had the character to come to the position that he was destined for now we know the stories you know sometimes the the tutor goes to the father and says you know he's got the Sheep eating the bad grass right so but then he's got the Sheep down there in the lowlands he's watching over them he's feeding them he's doing it just like you would do to the father so he's invited us he says now we're going to find out what we've done shape our character to his own Now by his own spirit so you don't do it of yourself I have learned you can't change yourself and that's where you know we we if we're not too careful the society we live in very similar to the Romans before the of the Roman Empire I mean self-development knowledge meditate yoga work out be the best self you look it's impossible without God that's you might look like 100% but you act like 20 right so it doesn't matter how you look on the outside that's right we say that tongue and cheek especially as ministers because we want you to be holy look to look holy but if the inside's right it has to manifest and and that's not just true for how you dress that's true for how you conduct yourself amen how you how you how you handle yourself in situations with your family at church right when when people aren't exactly you know the best treating of you how you handle that that's that's your character so it's shaped by his own Spirit which if you catch it goes right back to adoption right the holy spirit is the tutor he says then we by him are sons of God just what was expressed by having his mind in us so not only do we have his Spirit to shape us but we have the very mind of Christ so we think like him you know me and brother Alex have had the opportunity to do a lot of projects together at my house and sister Sue and stuff and and we just click I mean I reach for the screws and he's already got them out so working with him is just an absolute Joy right it's same thing back and forth we're right there we've done enough of it together we kind of think the same and and and that's exactly what God's looking for he he goes to to speak the word and you say you're right there he goes to turn around to ask for the crescent wrench and you're already handing it to him he he he wants you you see brother Bram had to deal with this in his ministry because brother Bram says no I wait until I have a vision and the angel of the Lord chastised him and said look the third pole right it's a spoken word what you need to be moving forward by faith and know that look you're not you're a Son of God you're an adopted son you need to act on the father's desires because you have the same mind amen you see we have to get this out of our heads that we can't be perfect we absolutely can be perfect amen so shape our character by having his mind in us to shape our character to his so it's both the Mind and Spirit his mind that's the mind that was in Christ be in you right he's quoting scripture if that mind is in you then you see he only did that which pleased God you see he he had he never did what pleased the Pharisees he never did what pleased the disciples if you read in the in the early part of of of of his ministry there's a an episode where he prays for a very long time for just a massive line of lepers and blind and sick people he a big old prayer line for you know almost all night long or however long it was but then he goes from there and you know it's it's 10 lepers it's one man at the pool of Bethesda right because that prayer line was the father's will the pool of Bethesda was one man that was the father's will you see the world today has it backwards when they think about God it says well you know love everyone be kind and and the the idea of of the culture of today that we live in but you see it's not about that it's about what does God want you to do you see there's a lot of things as a Christian that you can do but does God want you to do it that's right you know I just I listening to a sermon the other day I don't remember what it was I mentioned it in communion where brother says God has a season and a time so time and season season are not the same thing so you see God's word when it moves when it rustles in the mulberry bushes it's perfect it's he's divided between the season and the time so he says look in the fall September 10th 9:30 p.m. right I mean that's how he moves that's how he does things it's perfect and the only way you're going to know is if you know Christ if you have the Spirit of Christ in you and the mind of Christ so when you miss it what does that mean God wasn't loud enough no you weren't listening we weren't listening you see we take ourselves too serious we don't take the word of God serious enough we're so busy trying to make it perfect ourselves in the name of God in the name of of of of the word of God but brother says you he says get a prayer life and you'll be the Christian you want to be instead we have we're looking for you know eclipses and and stars and purple on the vice president and you know a news in in you know in a hurricane in Florida and and uh you know this brother that preach this meeting at the same time this brother over here preaches this and we're not praying and we're not feeding on the word of God and we think we're spiritual because we connected the dots that's how children act immature children act and I know that not everyone's going to agree with that statement but been there lived that and I'm sure I'll do it again because I have a lot to learn this is as much this is more for me I'm just going to be shelf selfish tonight this is all for me because I've been realizing more and more Lord I hi just too busy trying to do it myself and then somehow think that I you know I'm in tune to the will of God it's like I didn't even ask you but somehow I think oh I've got it figured out I didn't even bother asking God this is what you want me to do I just said well a plus b equals c and squar it and and the calculator gives me the number and hey yeah this is it but I never asked God so he says his mind okay he only did that which pleased God I mean what a place to live what a position to be in right but he had to have the character for that position Jesus lived on the earth for 30 years before he ever started his ministry amen he went through some character molding do you know how much he was ridiculed his entire life for being a bastard child nobody believed the story oh sure Mary nobody believed it Not only was was it unbelievable she's from Nazareth everybody knows what happens in Nazareth that's how they treated him he had no friends in school he had you know he just had his dad in the wood in the wood shop he knowed who he was he came the son you see that's how you stand against the pressure of of the age you know who you are that's right because when you know who you are which to to say the same thing in a different way is to say you know your itions then somebody else comes along with a better idea you're not going to fold to them because this is what you believe no matter how convincing they are that's Revelation that's right because you know who you are so if you find yourself folding to pressure go find out who you are that's right go get in contact with God and it's really as simple as just as praying more and feeding on the word of God that's right it has to be simple because if it was complicated everybody would do it he know who he was he came the Son of God and if you think that's not biblical look at non non was like dip in the muddy Jordan River that's too simple he came the Son of God he know know he was to take that place his character had to be that way his character had to be that way his character had to be that way having taking his taken his place he know what the Messiah was required of so he knew what the position required and he knew he had the character for the position so he did only what the father said to do and that is how he fulfilled the own his own word he spoke because he was the spirit and the mind of Christ in flesh so he had to act the word you have to act the word see that that understanding of scripture that understanding that God wants you to catch a hold of that you will act the word you have to act word that's not a that's not an easy way out that is there to give you the confidence that you can yeah you see if you start to look at it as well if I'm the bride I'll be the bride and you just kind of drift you're you're you're if you're the bride everything's going to just get messy because God wants you to have be encouraged by that not to to give up I just said the same thing twice in a row maybe someone need a different wording his character had to be that way he knew what the Messiah was required of and he always sought at God to do those things and did nothing until the father showed him now let's go to Romans chapter 8 verse 5 you know sometimes especially I I find for myself when I get into books like Romans it's really hard to find the verse to stop and if you're not careful you just read the whole book Romans chapter 8 verse5 for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace now we just found we just talked about why okay because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither in can be amen so your carnal mind the carnal mind is always against God Amen now you say well no not not not what you think it's just oh I can do that that's the carnal mind say I I'll arrange it that's the carnal mind says well that was pretty good song special that's the carnal mind it is not a it's not carnal mind isn't crafting how you're going to fraud the government and get away with fake checks right that's not the carnal mind I mean it is that's not what Paul's talking about he says when I would do good evil is present with me so we're going to turn around and say well you know Paul just sinned all day every day no no because you see when you become a Son of God things get down to the razor's Edge right so it's little things like just you know hey you know that person would just get their act together no how about I need to pray for that person yes it is right or well you know if the pastor just would have handled it like this it would have been a lot better no Lord if that was correct show me if not give my pastor better wisdom that's how you handle that that's the mature Christian that's the mature bride that's the one who's taking the character now guess what you begin to act that way suddenly God gives you more God gives you a promotion right there are revelations in the word that are waiting for you if you'll just stop acting like a little kid you see Revelation isn't about how do I say this correctly Revelation isn't necessarily about how long you sit in the word it's how much your character molds to Christ then he says okay right because think about it as as as a as the son's growing up um he begin he he acts appropriately and he's given a little bit of responsibility okay your responsibility is to make sure all these papers every day are ordered by by uh invoice number and they're stacked neatly on the desk once he shows he's responsible in that no matter what happens rain or shine or his buddies want to play those papers are stacked in order and perfectly in place like the father asked him to be okay this is the tutor now he's the one writing the invoices okay so the same thing is going to happen to you spiritually as you grow in the word of God God's God's going to challenge you with responsibility however that may look shake out I can't think of an example but God will challenge you and and and and he will see can you be faithful with your tithes can you be faithful with offering can you be faithful you know it's your turn to clean the church can you be faithful to clean the church will you put your best foot forward or where you you know Skip the baseboards under the Pew right and then he sees okay now I have something more for you but we all want to jump out the gate and and we we see our our kids do this right man you know uh dad can I can I try the the skill saw absolutely not when you're we always say when you're older but what we mean is is when you're more mature then yes so we're we we get you know sometimes they don't they're not happy with that decision so they'll throw a fit we do the same thing to God he says well God you know I I I I want to be I want to be just this spiritual you know wow and God's like we take care of your house right clean it up I bless you with a home take care of it or or I I I bless you with the ability to sit and and play play an instrument be the best you can be then I'll have more for you I believe that God when God gives you a talent for the musicians song leaders whoever it may be or actually everybody yet God gives you a talent you have to show because as it now remember it's different for the children of God we don't care about how they do it out there or how others do it for the children of God the remember the higher calling uh that that that brother in in China um whatever I can't remember his name right now but years ago still a brother um but God won't allow it to work for you if you you want to sing you know I have a friend and if I said him by name you would know who he is so I won't say him by name but he was at a meeting and he has a he has a phenomenal voice and he's at the at at at some C at some meetings and and he says he says let me see the lineup and he looks and he's like oh yeah I'll have no problem tonight God completely blasted his voice and he couldn't s you see that'll work for them out there but that's not going to work for a Son of God because a gift is given to be a blessing to the body of Christ so Titus as you get better you say I'm going to honor God in my life and in my playing suddenly new chords will come C notes new notes will come out new bow movements will come out and just wow where did that come from that's God blessing your gift because you're willing to honor him amen and that's how it works but then he honors you with that and then if you get a little bit of pride guess what suddenly you can't do it anymore you just I just my fingers won't go where they're supposed to go and as God then God will whisper in your ear and said you see it's not for you it's for me amen okay same thing is in business you know how where you work and how you do your job so he says to be spiritually minded is life and peace we are we are in verse S we're in verse eight so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God you know that's not reserved for not unbelievers that is that is us we get in the flesh we're not going to please God and here's the thing about it Saints is God's going to let you know that you're not pleasing him okay but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his so you have to have the spirit of Christ right and if Christ Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness so you're draging around a dead man but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you you see it's all about the spirit of Christ is going to manifest Christ in your life your your body you know our sister Joanne her body can't do nothing it's going to be raised up because the spirit of Christ it can't hold it back nothing can hold it back right nothing can hold it back so so so the the desires of the world though they be strong for a season you will overcome them because the spirit of Christ within you can't be held back as an encouragement you have a job to do surrender to God and eat the book right therefore brethren we are debt not to the flesh to live after the flesh so we don't we we don't we don't owe this flesh anything amen for if you live live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live so through the spirit for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are sons of God praise the Lord for you have not received received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father looking to the father right we desire to please the father because we want to receive we want to be adopted Sons and Daughters of God the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God Amen to see Jesus well we we I'll read these scriptures here sorry right there uh John 5:19 then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do interesting he says seeth the father do so the father did it first for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise so the tutor is saying look look how Papa does it look how your father does it do it that way right right so God's showing you this is how it's done do this same thing right John John 5:30 a little further down I can of my own self do nothing this is God in flesh amen all God all man I mean the Pinnacle of History do you know history revolves around Jesus being on earth a what is it BC or ad BC or backwards BC ad right I mean it's it's the point in history historians the world over can't deny Jesus was here on Earth and he says I can't do anything as I hear I judge and my judgment is just now he just said he can't do anything but then he goes follows up and says as I hear I judge and my judgment is just Why semicolon because I seek not my own will but the will of the Father which hath sent me so you have the right to say my judgment is just when you operate according to the spirit of Christ in your life people come to people come and they say well don't you know Only God can judge me you're looking at him but you see you're never going to condemn them to to to uh to um you're not going to judge them to condemnation you're going to judge judge them to Restoration right you have a desire to see them change you know as a as as a minister you get up here and you begin to speak and you come under the the anointing of God and and things start to open up and you see people and you see their struggles you know you're sitting in the Pew you you can't hide and you see I'm not saying it's perfect I'm still a man I'm not trying to say I'm kind of prophet but God gives you the window and sometimes to see certain things and as it's a burden you carry because you say God I want to see them succeed God I want to see them but guess what it's God and it has to be God but when you harness yourself to the word of God your judgment will be just right so don't be afraid to judge you need to judge situations you need to judge individuals not to condemnation not to gossip about them right because then you're not doing it according to the will of God now you're just doing it as a man and that's where it says judge not that you be not judged that's what that scripture means but when you're looking at situations and you're saying I'm concerned about this the spirit of Christ says take that to prayer then you take that to prayer you SE an individual you say kids stay away from him right you're rightfully judging it's the Holy Spirit Discerning the situation before you and that is the spirit of Christ so amen and two see Jesus he says but trying to get in now this is the pool of bethesa now trying to get into this pool this Mighty mess of suffering there and Jesus walking right through that crowd of people lame Hal blind withered that's our lovely Lord full of compassion walked right through these those blind people those sick people those screaming people those lame people those halt people those maimed people you know brother brand was speaking from experience he's had to you know remember he in his early Ministry he stood at the pulpit for like what was it eight days or something like that praying for people Non-Stop and by the time he got to that point where he was just about to have a nervous breakdown there was more people than when he started so brother bam knows exactly firsthand what this feels like to walk past those maed people knowing that they have the faith and God has the ability to heal them but it's not the will of the father so now Jesus you don't think that tugged on him as a man I mean that was that was a burden to walk in pray for that man and walk out and leave all those people suffering and he knew their outcomes he's God he knew as he walked by that man's going to die tomorrow and there was nothing he could do because he was completely harnessed to the will of the father you think oh it's just Jesus it was easy no Jesus had to know what it's like that's why he was all man but all God he had to know what it's like so when you're out there and you say well be kind help everybody and God says no only this that's it you have to stand against doing the right thing because you're doing the will of the father amen I this is an important lesson that I had to that I had continually we have to learn because we can look at it and we say well as a Christian I need to do this this is the right thing to do but did God ask you to do it did God tell you to do it you know there are situations where where where we have heard different stories you know people try to go pray for someone that's demon possessed and then it goes bad cuz God didn't tell them to do that right see we're harnessed to the will of the father you have to pray for everybody for one you can't you don't you don't have the mental faculty those main people all those twisted and Afflicted and blind suffering bunch of humanity laying there half starved to death naked waiting for that full of mercy and compassion walked right through every one of them and walked over to a man laying on a pallet that had some kind of an infirmity he had it 38 years perhaps sugar diabetes or tricular it was I don't know what he's what that's saying there but walked over to that man so in other words this man it wasn't life-threatening and we look at that and we say now listen we need to order the sicknesses by severity and pick the worst one you know God says look you know God speaks to your heart says you're going to go to the P of Bethesda you're going to pray for one person that's what we would do say okay give me a list we'll pray for the worst case God's like no come on down the let's pray for this man why we don't need to know why that's right we don't need to know why I'm going to I'm going to pause this quote I'm going to jump and I'm going to read to explain why don't need to know why trying to do God a service without being the will of God now think real hard and watch what the denomination has done today see they've turned it down called it false Doctrine see look where they're at they'll get their ecumenical counsel all right called it mental telepathy what when God himself vindicating it to be the truth and proving it's the truth oh they're just a little bunch of nitwits out there they say don't know what they're talking about that's right we don't but we just say his words and he knows what he's talking about see I can't explain it nobody else can but he proves it amen so we don't need to know why he said it so we say it too amen that's when you're really harnessed to the will of the father now back to that quote paragraph 29 now let's take that being Chicago tonight and say sitting along here would be a whole maybe 20 or 30 or 40 Wheelchairs and some critic would come in and in the meeting and say look let me see these the those people who believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and they claim that Congressman Upshaw and all these people that's has that's been healed and we've heard all these testimonies of the lame Halt and short legs made long and the dead raised up the doctor statements of it and so forth like that let me see them walk down and make them well now that will be the same spirit that was on them people in that day right so here's Jesus's opportunity right big day everybody's watching they've heard all the rumors what's he going to do well history says he he'll go in there and heal everybody else he heals the man who who's fine he's sick but he's fine he's not going to die and he walks out everyone says well yeah we knew it it was all a hoax cuz they God's God is not a magician he's not a sideshow right tell us who hit you not a word was spoken you see it it's nothing to do with he didn't even use the power that God gave him to prove God Amen you say well brother just said he proves it yeah he proved it by keeping his mouth shut he proved it by only healing the one man he proved it by going to Calvary and Rising again and he didn't go around and tell everybody see look I'm alive I really am here no he just went to his people he went to the elect of God he didn't run to to to Herod and and and and um pilot and everybody else and say no no no it's not a hoax I'm alive no he didn't do that because it doesn't matter they don't matter only the child children of God matter only the Eagles matter we don't know who's Eagles so we just we try for everybody but God knows so God comes to you and says look do this you just do you don't ask why you you do it you listen to what he says you be obedient because you're a child of God and that's maturity that's right that's maturity you know we we're at that stage in in our life and and bless my my kids if they're listening and they're catching what I'm saying we're you know we're getting some arguments back you know so well what about you know do this well I don't no when Dad says do something you just say yes sir and you do it you don't argue with me you don't have that position and there's consequences and then you know I'm sorry but that's what God does to us he says do this and we want to argue and say well Lord no I really think you ought to do it this way and guess what we do we go and do it that way and he says great how is it talking to a donkey yeah balum right look where he ended up and he was murdered in the the Armen but Bam's not a child of God he wouldn't have acted like that if he was but you see or I don't want to make that statement you know whatever balam is in the hands of the Lord but he received judgment for how he behaved so the same thing we we God tells us to do something and and we want to argue with it why because because of the flesh when I would do good evil is present with me and it's because we have character flaws I think it's really healthy every day to look at yourself in the mirror not in a self-destructing way because we should have humble confidence but in a real with yourself kind of way look in the mirror and says look you got a lot to learn because whenever we start to think we got it figured out man that's when we're the most arrogant the most annoying and the most hardest to deal with when we think we got it figured out every in church is like you can't tell that guy anything I can't I mean just it's so complicated it just doesn't work out you know that's why God gave us gave us wives they're are mirrors and children oh come on so he says let's take that in Chicago tonight say sitting along here would be a whole maybe 20 or or or 30 or 40 Wheelchairs and some critic would come in the meeting say look let me see these people you know make this claim let me let me see you show me show show what happen so that Jesus is the same I'm paraphrasing because I realize I'm further down to the quote let me see them walk down and make them well now that would be the same Spirit was on them people in that day they wanted to know the same thing how could this man walk by there full of love full of compassion and leave all those people lay there how could he do it now God in his infinite wisdom and Grace tells us why in this point in time he says now Jesus answers them in John 5:19 which we read he said verily verily I say unto you the son of the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that doeth the son likewise is that right if that was Jesus yesterday that's Jesus today you do nothing except God shows first what to do now Jesus plainly said he did nothing except the father showed him that's right now in hear ye him 1958 but now notice in my father's house he was strictly with the Bible I I just I I don't know you read quotes sometimes in these phrases pop out like the invitation to mold your character and and this part just really pops out to me he was strictly with the Bible that's right you know in in the programming world we we use this we use software kind of like word right like you're going to write a document in Word we use something very similar it's called an IDE and we have we have software that's loaded into that program that can then keep us writing good code because you can write whatever you want but then when it ships then that's when you see the problem so we have these safeguards in place and there's a Mode called strict mode and when you put it in strict mode your editor as we call it gets all these red squiggly lines under every function you can imagine that you've written because it's not good enough because it's strict mode so you know what we do we turn off strict mode because there's only certain situations where strict mode can actually work you have to start it right and you got to finish it right and you got to work through it correctly and it takes a lot of time but you'll never have a problem with it so mankind says well we'll just turn that off mankind says well Bible you know got to grow your hair and wear n it's too hard we'll just turn strict mode off no he says he says he was strictly with the Bible that's right so if the Bible said it he did it why because it was his own words so you says wow maybe you feel like like it's too impossible get the spirit and the mind of Christ inside of you and suddenly you'll just do it I went from working in a place where we didn't do any testing and I came to where I work now and it was like oh my goodness testing and we had to have all this extra stuff to be closer to strict mode and it was a pain and I was frustrated but now it's just what I do right it's just part of my everyday work I don't even to think about it God does the same thing with you he takes you and just you're you're frustrated and and you're you're frally with yourself you see how you're falling short but then you just keep applying the word of God because there's a balm in Gilead as the Bible says you just keep applying the word of God and you keep going to church and all of a sudden you realize I'm not the man I used to be that's right tell me tell me tell me the Magic in that tell me the the boom and the drama in that no it's it's it's just a Son of God living God's word but it's not just that is a miracle amen amen he was strictly with the Bible back in the Old Testament when a father owned a big Kingdom and a child was born into that Kingdom he was a son as soon as he was born but yet that son he would be heir of all the father had if his character was right that's that's it but first his character had to be proved now you ministers know where I'm going to it's the placing of a son now but his character didn't show up right he didn't inherit anything he was just a son amen so then the father in order to get this great son of his who he loved he had a he had business to be doing so he got a tutor trainer over his children and he sought through the places till he found the best man he could find because his son's education and the future of his son depended on what kind of a training that child got there's some good family teaching right there that's the way it is today in the Kingdom of God that when we're born in the kingdom of God God sought out the best tutor that he could find for the church and that was the Holy Spirit that's right so you see it's our benefit when we stick with God's will yeah that's right because we're getting better because we're there with the Holy Spirit which is the teacher yeah so the sooner we can surrender what we want and do what God's want God wants it's actually you're going to be happier the the the the the barebones example of that is somebody living in the world and you look at them you think if you would just surrender to God your life would be incredible compared to what it is right now because I I think sometimes you see somebody like that I think they're a child of God that's why it just doesn't work out there for them just everything goes wrong because some people who live you know good successful lives but and so you just say well you it be easier I mean you fight battles right you fight fight battles but the peace the rest right I was just reading today in my studies and brother talking about how denominations or something along those lines ministers so forth painting being a Christian like it's some um you know strenuous and like oh you got to just try to be a good Christian he says no it's rest that's right it's rest and and identification one more quote here and then we're going to close he says where would you be identified at that time well I say that but we have a whole quote so we never know where would you be identified at that time now with your character that's molded in you now now this is this is uh what is it called pause right now this moment at uh 8:56 right here your character okay that's what we're looking at not your character in a few years not your character tomorrow WR this second right he says that character that's something in you something's molded your character you're some kind of a character and that's more true for some of us you're going to find yourself somewhere here what would you have done so your character right now what would you have done what in your present State now he's going to get to what we're talking about here where would you have been at that time see teachers all against him and everything and his miracles identified him you see so the identification was present and was obvious right but all they could think about was how he was disrupting their well oiled machine he was dropping bolts in their flywheels because they needed to rebuild the engine so he says where would you have been his and his miracles identified him and when the 70 got up and the pastors and the ministers and got up and said we can't understand that would you have walked away like that congregation or would you have been like them disciples I don't care what they say it's there then Jesus turned and gave them trials see he just he just turns it up a notch right he gets rid of it that's what was happening with Gideon right that was the type there in Gideon God just kept turning up the notch because the real child of go children of God they don't crack under the pressure they mold under the pressure right because it's the fire right the gold doesn't go away everything else goes away but the gold just gets hotter and hotter and then just just just soup how hot do you want to take it it's there everything else Burns and Falls away but the gold stays so God has to turn the temperature up so you think it's bad right now he says can understand that would you have walked away like okay then Jesus turned and gave them trial said do you all want to go too see they had caught they had him caught in a trap why this man's a vampire said we have to eat his flesh and blood they walked away the congregation well the ministers say well we we'll say we'll stay a little while longer and see what it's all about see so they didn't go in his in this story he's sharing we're going to say and see what he has to say and he said now when you see the son of man identifying himself as God now and saints of God that's always the point when you lose them that's the point when the draw falls out is when God ENT why okay praise God why is it the point when God identifies himself why is that when everyone separates because he can see himself in the gold so nothing else can be there that's why they separated oh no they separated no that's a good sign that means God's looking at himself right because there's nothing to Mar the image now so he turns and says look I'm God when you see the son of man lifting up into heaven from where he come from oh they said this is too much for us and off they went then he turned to the disciples and said you want to go too he didn't turn to them and say you guys going to stick with me he says look you should leave too and they said Lord where are we going to go yeah amen Lord who would we go that's right where could we go we know that you and you alone have has the words of life I mean what what a position to be in amen when you look I mean just put yourself there for a minute you're looking Christ himself in the face eye to eye and he learns at you and says are you going to leave me too right and you see it wasn't it wasn't his look alone to hold them it wasn't his features alone to hold them because he had no features were a mini would desire him he and he made himself of no reputation so the man those who knew him in passing didn't understand him the man there was nothing to want you to say I want to follow that guy it had to be that way because otherwise it wouldn't have worked because it has to be the words of life so why do you follow the message because your parents do because you just grew up in it and you married a girl who grew up in it too why do you come to church because it's all you know and it's a nice community and SS of God we are coming to the point where God's going to start looking at you in the face and say are you going to go too that's it because you can't be in the way if you're not in either you're in or you're not that's right and we're at that point in time where the Lord's like look I don't got any room on the bench that's right I need I need players in the game and I and I need you to stand the test of time it's like in the in in the in the in in the if I can have the Liberty to be a bit a bit loose in The Game of Life there's just enough players on God's team that's right oh the devil's got droves of them the bench is full he's got fresh Replacements but you got to tow the line ining in and ining out quarter in and quarter out you have to be there Towing the line there is no break because as soon as you break the devil says I own the bench so are you on my team right now a bit more serious God has called us to something amen why would we want to fail him why would we want to back up and give up and and uh the only way the only way is eat the book you know what until the end of time we will preach the same thing over and over again that's right eat the booken every sermon comes back to that whether you realize it or not it comes back to the same thing eat the book it's the same thing like Noah right as in the days of Noah so shall it be the coming of the son of man Noah said it's going to rain and we're saying eat the book same message so Noah brought it from different angles 400 years of preaching he refined his ability to bring bring it from different angles and show Enoch this and and Methuselah's name this and all of this kind of stuff right Noah brought it but it all ended the same thing it's going to rain amen same is in the world that we live in today eat the book you want to be like God be like Christ eat the book but you got to pray too that's you got to pray too you got to serve God you got to have a relationship with God and none of us can make you have a relationship with God and those that are serving God Don't Stop Get Down down deep grain and say God what are the little things I am holding on to what are the little Prides that I'm holding on to those that have been serving God and they're dedicated to serving God we're still here so obviously you have something to change and I have something to change so God show me show let me see when my pride takes control let me see when my my you know my Temperance is out and I'm not fulfilling the fruits of the spirit Lord help me to see that and Lord help me not to do it again next time that's right give me the strength to say say no no give me the strength to have joy give me the strength to have joy yes that's that's I've been thinking about it a lot lately I know I said I would close but Lord I need to I Joy is part of what Joy is part of the fruits of the spirit amen so if I'm being longf faced guess what I'm not being a good witness of Christ we're not Martyrs okay we are Sons and Daughters of God we should have have joy in our lives you think the martyrs looked like they were sad to die no they were praising God they were praising God and they had to give their literal lives you have to give your spiritual life you have to surrender your flesh to God Amen and die out completely to him let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Lord if we if we look at it through the flesh it's a big mountain it's a big pyramid actually and if and if we look and say well well it's too hard to climb well it is but if if we look into your word and we say God show us the next step to take then we look back and we see how we gain some elevation up the statue of a perfect man Lord remind us keep us focused that we can we can look and we can say Lord you're in control what is your will what do you want me to do where do you want me to go what do you want me to do next how do you want me to handle the situation and there's an argument between the husband and wife may there be a pause say let's pray before we continue let's seek the father's will in in everything we do Lord you're calling us to that so we need to make that our goal because we want to get out of here we want to wrap we want this thing to wrap up we want to see you in the skies and meeting in the air and we want to come over but Lord you're getting down to the nitty-gritty down deep where the joints and the marrow of the bones that that's the the the the beest form of the human body the bones and the marrow down deep and you're saying look boy you need more joy look you need more less Pride you need to be more humble you need more Temperance in your life you need more brotherly kindness you say you love me and you can't even love your neighbor you need to fix that God that's what you're doing now Lord help us to surrender to you help us to lay our lives on the line Lord and say whatever you want God I'll do it I'll do it whatever you want send me I'll go if send me means live here stay here and just serve you and clean the church then God I'm ready to do it that Lord should be our desire and Lord I pray you'd strengthen that cuz I know your people here tonight that is their hearts but God things gets in the way so may you strengthen that desire may you throw some more wood on the fire throw another coal on the fire lord Jesus to burn brighter in their lives and say you know what I don't need a glamorous life I just want to be surrendered to the will of the father thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord
