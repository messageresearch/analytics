[31:30] Lord

[31:36] our hearts Lord
[31:39] s words fail us sometimes to express to

[32:31] may you begin to move within our hearts
[32:35] Lord Jesus something beyond what music
[32:38] can touch the god that your Holy Spirit
[32:41] would touch our hearts deep down inside

[34:13] it's going to be back tonight
[34:15] with everyone thank you for your prayers
[34:17] for the trip it's all it all went really
[34:20] well God God spoke to the heart of the
[34:22] people and both in chivac and uh brother
[34:26] rich rich Cobbs and uh so we said we
[34:29] bring greetings back from I don't know
[34:31] Tabernacle and uh for the rich as well
[34:34] of course
[34:35] whether they tell me to or not we'll
[34:38] bring it back so
[34:39] Genesis chapter 32
[34:43] and Jacob went on his way and the angels
[34:46] of God met him
[34:47] and when Jacob saw them he said this is
[34:50] God's host and he called the name of
[34:52] that place
[34:53] mahanim and Jacob sent Messengers before
[34:56] him to Esau his brother unto the land of
[34:58] seer the country of Edom and he
[35:01] commanded them saying thus shall you
[35:03] speak unto my Lord Esau and thy servant
[35:06] Jacob saith thus I have sojourned with
[35:09] Laban and stayed there until now and I
[35:11] have oxen and asses flocks and Men
[35:14] servants and women servants and I have
[35:16] sent to tell my Lord that I may find
[35:19] Grace in thy sight
[35:20] and The Messengers returned to Jacob
[35:22] saying we came to thy brother Esau and
[35:25] also he cometh to meet thee and 400 men
[35:27] with him then Jacob was greatly afraid
[35:30] and distressed and he divided the people
[35:32] that was with him and the flocks and
[35:34] herds and the camels into two bands and
[35:36] said if he saw come to the one company
[35:38] and smite it then the other company
[35:39] which is left shall escape and Jacob
[35:42] said oh god of My Father Abraham and God
[35:45] of my father Isaac the Lord would say it
[35:47] said set us unto me return unto thy
[35:50] country into thy Kindred and I will deal
[35:52] well with thee I am not worthy of the
[35:55] least of all the Mercies
[35:57] and of all the truth which thou has
[36:00] showed unto thy servant for with my
[36:02] staff I passed over this Jordan and now
[36:04] I am become two bands deliver me I pray
[36:06] thee from the hand of my brother from
[36:08] the hand of his offer I fear Him lest he
[36:10] will come and smite me and the mother
[36:12] with the children and thou said as thy
[36:15] will surely do the good and make thy
[36:17] seed as the sand of the sea which cannot
[36:19] be numbered for multitude
[36:21] and he lodged there that same night and
[36:23] took up took of that which came to his
[36:26] hand at present for Esau his brother
[36:30] amen may the Lord blessing to the
[36:31] reading of his words you may be seated
[36:32] tonight
[36:35] so
[36:36] my title tonight is so re-wrestle
[36:41] and my subtitle is the enduring will of
[36:43] God
[36:46] so Genesis in Genesis chapter 32 we read
[36:50] we read the beginning of the the ending
[36:54] of Jacob
[36:56] and uh the beginning of Israel
[37:00] a prince with God and
[37:03] Jacob prays to God in this prayer
[37:07] but
[37:09] he's nothing happens at that point in
[37:11] time
[37:12] he's still
[37:14] goes on he still divides up the family
[37:16] he still splits it all up
[37:19] and God knows when when we were when
[37:22] we're ready
[37:23] God knows when when we're at perfect
[37:26] pressure
[37:28] and um
[37:30] he knows exactly what he's doing
[37:33] in Luke chapter 22
[37:35] verse 39.
[37:54] at one point in time I was a barista
[37:58] and um when you make coffee when you
[38:02] make espresso you have to there's a lot
[38:05] of things that have to go that go into a
[38:07] perfect shot
[38:09] in including coffee
[38:12] and the the course
[38:15] you grind up the coffee and you pack it
[38:17] into What's called the portafilter that
[38:19] little thing they pop on there and
[38:21] there's a cylinder inside that that
[38:23] builds pressure if your coffee is too
[38:26] coarse
[38:27] the pressure won't build properly and
[38:29] it'll run through the coffee too soon
[38:31] and you'll get a weak shot
[38:33] if the pressure if the grind of the
[38:36] coffee is too fine the pressure builds
[38:38] too much and it'll burn the shot
[38:40] so you have to have the right amount of
[38:42] of the exact right amount of pressure
[38:45] and there's a little gauge you can see
[38:48] it's on the some of the machines
[38:51] and God when he he deals with you it's
[38:53] the same way
[38:55] he knows the exact amount of pressure
[38:58] to put you underneath
[39:02] he he looks at you and and he looked at
[39:05] Mary Magdalene who was at the tomb
[39:08] on the first Easter Sunday
[39:11] she was looking for Jesus and the body's
[39:13] gone she goes and gets the disciples and
[39:15] a couple disciples they come back Peter
[39:17] says
[39:18] I don't know the other disciple believes
[39:21] they leave Mary's there and she begins
[39:23] to weep
[39:24] she's been under so much pressure since
[39:28] Friday
[39:30] and we look at that and we say poor Mary
[39:33] the pressure that she's underneath but
[39:36] God looked at that and said she's still
[39:38] two degrees from perfect pressure
[39:42] and then she she hears a voice behind
[39:45] her and she turns around and she sees
[39:46] the man who she think is thinks is the
[39:47] gardener and she says sir you know if
[39:49] you've done something with my Lord
[39:51] please tell me
[39:53] and he says a few words and then she
[39:55] turns and he and Jesus who was the
[39:58] gardener Jesus says Mary
[40:02] because right at that point in time she
[40:05] was at perfect pressure
[40:09] and when she he said Mary she recognized
[40:12] who he was
[40:14] perfect shot
[40:16] and she he tells Mary he says Mary go
[40:20] quickly
[40:21] and tell my disciples I have risen
[40:24] because Peter is at is five still five
[40:28] degrees
[40:29] from perfect pressure
[40:31] go quickly and tell him because I I
[40:34] don't want to miss the shot
[40:37] Thomas everyone meets pressure perfect
[40:40] shot Thomas he's still two degrees from
[40:43] perfect pressure
[40:45] so Jesus says Thomas come touch my hands
[40:49] come put your hand in my side
[40:51] perfect shot
[40:53] we look at our circumstances and we say
[40:55] the pressure is too great
[40:58] or we say I am breaking under the
[41:01] pressure
[41:03] but God's just pulling a perfect shot
[41:07] because you and I are Sons and Daughters
[41:11] of God and God never ever ever makes a
[41:16] mistake
[41:19] everything the disciples were put
[41:21] through think about that was their
[41:22] friend
[41:24] three years night and day
[41:27] you know me in the trip me and Alex did
[41:29] to Alaska in February ah man I missed
[41:31] him
[41:32] we were together for a whole week and a
[41:34] half imagine being together with
[41:36] somebody like that for three and a three
[41:38] and a half or three years and then now
[41:41] all of the plans they had in their head
[41:45] fell apart
[41:48] how many times in our lives have all the
[41:51] plans that we had in our head falling
[41:54] apart and we say wow everything's
[41:57] falling apart
[41:58] and God says no no
[42:01] perfect shot
[42:02] [Applause]
[42:04] he knows exactly how much to to grind
[42:08] you down
[42:13] he knows how much to grind you down
[42:15] before you he even puts you in the
[42:18] cylinder
[42:19] the Piston he knows exactly how much to
[42:22] grind you down until you're in the
[42:24] position now
[42:26] Jesus ground Peter down
[42:30] Peter no you'll deny me three times
[42:33] denies his Lord denies his best friend
[42:36] and curses while doing it
[42:39] but God was grinding him and then God
[42:42] was pressing him
[42:45] there's Beauty in the pressing we know
[42:47] you press of rose right you crush a rose
[42:49] you get perfume from it
[42:51] Luke chapter 22 verse 39 and he came out
[42:55] and went as he walked to the Mount of
[42:57] Olives and his disciples also followed
[42:59] him and when he was at the place he said
[43:01] unto them pray that she entered not into
[43:03] temptation and he was withdrawn from
[43:06] them about a stone's cast and kneeled
[43:08] down and prayed he didn't know he didn't
[43:10] know sleeping was temptation
[43:16] take care of yourself get the rest that
[43:18] you need so when the tempter of sleep
[43:21] comes you will not fall
[43:25] and he was withdrawn from them about a
[43:27] stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed
[43:29] saying father if thou be willing remove
[43:31] this cup from me nevertheless not my
[43:33] will but thine be done
[43:36] what a position
[43:38] we can I can stand here and I can preach
[43:41] that
[43:43] but when I walk that
[43:46] when you walk that
[43:49] there is nothing amazing
[43:53] about it
[43:55] there it you pray the same thing Lord
[43:58] take this pressure from me take this
[44:01] away from me
[44:02] so we wrestle
[44:05] what was Peter doing Peter was face to
[44:08] face with his Humanity
[44:11] and he wrestled
[44:14] how many times do we come to places in
[44:16] our life where God says all right it's
[44:18] time to step higher so what does he do
[44:21] he doesn't give you some great
[44:22] Revelation he puts you face to face with
[44:25] yourself
[44:26] and you say he's in the way
[44:29] she's in the way
[44:32] that is one of the most difficult things
[44:34] to do to face yourself to see your
[44:38] Humanity because we all live with our
[44:40] Humanity
[44:42] but when God reveals to us our
[44:45] discrepancies when God reveals to us our
[44:48] failings we have to face ourselves
[44:51] face to face
[44:54] and then we say nevertheless not my will
[44:57] but thine be done
[45:05] and there appeared an angel unto him
[45:07] from Heaven strengthening him the angel
[45:09] didn't come
[45:11] until he surrendered
[45:14] not my will but thine be done
[45:17] all man all God at the same time
[45:21] so he showed us this is what happens
[45:23] when you're pressed to the point of
[45:26] breaking
[45:28] this is what happens when you go through
[45:30] this difficult thing and we and you're
[45:32] being pushed upon this is how you will
[45:35] feel
[45:37] but he says
[45:39] this is how you conquer
[45:42] God never leaves you in that position
[45:44] God doesn't ever leave you weeping by
[45:46] the tomb God reveals his self to you
[45:50] what is God his will in your life
[45:55] and when you face the will of God
[45:59] when you face the will of God you were
[46:01] ready to accept it because he brings you
[46:05] pulls you pushes you leads you but you
[46:09] still have to say nevertheless not my
[46:11] will but thine be done and as soon as
[46:14] you do
[46:16] as soon as you do the angel appears and
[46:20] begins to minister unto you what is an
[46:21] angel is an angel is a messenger begins
[46:24] to bring you read a scripture
[46:26] and God speaks to your heart
[46:29] strengthening him and being in an Agony
[46:31] he prayed more earnestly and his sweat
[46:34] was as it were great drops of blood
[46:35] falling to the ground
[46:38] in the message the breach between the
[46:41] seven Church ages and the Seven Seals
[46:43] but the Browns talk he's preaching about
[46:45] John and John sees and John sees that
[46:49] there's nobody worthy to open the book
[46:50] and and and that's a that's another
[46:53] sermon for another time I would have
[46:55] wanted to take this point in time and we
[46:57] look at John and we see John who who
[46:59] says he he falls and he begins to weep
[47:01] he just like Mary at the tomb
[47:05] and he sees there's no way for the word
[47:07] of God there's no way for the book to be
[47:10] taken where it's hopeless for all of us
[47:13] that hopelessness is is that we can have
[47:18] no relationship with God
[47:20] so John begins to weep Trump begins to
[47:22] cry and he's in this position of this
[47:24] pressing and it says and he says don't
[47:26] be broken-hearted John don't weep for
[47:28] the line of the tribe of Judah the root
[47:31] and Offspring from David he has
[47:33] prevailed now that same thing is true in
[47:36] you in our lives because the same word
[47:39] that prevailed
[47:41] and open the book is the same word that
[47:43] prevails and opens you
[47:46] Prevail means wrestle with and
[47:50] overcome
[47:52] wrestle with and overcome
[47:56] oh my The Garden of Gethsemane when
[47:58] blood dropped down out of his face he
[48:00] was overcoming when blood dropped down
[48:04] out of his face he was overcoming say no
[48:08] he was under too much pressure
[48:11] no
[48:14] The Lion and the root of David has
[48:16] prevailed has overcome
[48:22] now we'll pause there I won't read the
[48:24] rest of the quote we'll come back to it
[48:28] we read we read the story of Jacob
[48:31] my title tonight it to remind you is so
[48:34] we wrestle
[48:36] in Genesis 25 27-28
[48:39] says and the boys grew and Esau was a
[48:42] cunning Hunter and a man of the field
[48:44] and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in
[48:46] tents
[48:47] and Isaac loved Esau because he did eat
[48:51] of his venison but Rebecca loved Jacob
[48:54] Jacob this is the beginning of the story
[48:57] of Jacob and we see here we look we look
[49:01] between the lines and we begin to Desert
[49:03] because Jacob was a man like you and I
[49:06] no
[49:07] nothing special yet everything special
[49:11] here's Jacob never could be as good as
[49:14] Esau
[49:16] no good job Jacob but Esau
[49:21] Rebecca love Jacob but Jacob was never
[49:24] good enough for Dad
[49:26] never strong enough never good enough on
[49:28] the field never good enough hunting
[49:29] never good enough for this because Jesus
[49:32] was the one
[49:34] so here's Jacob this is the start of his
[49:36] life
[49:39] and now Jacob
[49:41] because
[49:42] he was Jacob means supplanter or
[49:45] Deceiver
[49:46] Jacob meets Esau coming off the field
[49:49] hunting right Jacob and Esau are always
[49:51] at each other's throats
[49:53] jealousy from Jacob
[49:55] and I don't know what for Misa
[49:59] and the Bible says Jacob have a love and
[50:02] Esau have I hated we use that and we and
[50:04] if we're not careful we'll use that
[50:06] scripture and we dismiss the humanity we
[50:08] dismiss the pain that the hardship that
[50:10] Esau and Jacob both went through
[50:13] we dismissed that oh Jacob you know was
[50:16] a deceiver and then he wrestled with God
[50:17] and it's just a story that we talk about
[50:19] but it's we got to make that real to
[50:21] nape to today tonight because we wrestle
[50:24] just like Jacob so this is our example
[50:27] we see Jacob I mean what the deceiver
[50:31] Jacob says swear to me this day
[50:34] and he swears unto him and he sold his
[50:36] Birthright unto Jacob Jacob deceived
[50:39] Esau says you want someone with his
[50:41] pottage
[50:43] here no smell it just smell it give me
[50:46] the birthright
[50:49] Jacob could never get away from the
[50:51] birthright
[50:53] you see his heart was in the right place
[50:56] but his flesh was in control
[51:01] his heart was in the right place but his
[51:04] flesh was in control
[51:06] brother Branham talks about in God
[51:08] trying to go to service without it being
[51:10] the will of God he says the bringing the
[51:13] ark
[51:14] back to
[51:16] Jerusalem or whatever it was bringing
[51:18] that Ark back was an honorable and a
[51:20] pure desire but David did it wrong it
[51:23] wasn't
[51:23] God's will for That season
[51:28] the will of God was for Eliezer to get
[51:32] Rebecca and to tell her that's Isaac but
[51:35] the will of God changed seasons
[51:38] because the will of God is seasonal
[51:43] sometimes it's the will of God for you
[51:46] to be a certain place then that changes
[51:50] and God says now it's time to go here
[51:53] those are called transitions those are
[51:56] called corners
[51:58] and brother Benham says there's always
[52:00] trouble at the corner
[52:03] if you think about a group of of men say
[52:06] in the Army and they're marching
[52:07] and they say you know
[52:10] whatever they say about left or whatever
[52:12] and there's eight guys marching and they
[52:15] say the guy in the lead says left go
[52:17] left at one point in time there's four
[52:19] guys going this way and four guys going
[52:22] this way
[52:23] and the guys going this way I said wow
[52:25] man they didn't catch the corner but if
[52:27] that guy at the very back turned when
[52:29] the front guy did he'd be completely out
[52:32] of the will of God
[52:34] he has to turn when he comes to the
[52:37] corner
[52:39] and it's our job to keep marching to
[52:41] Pace to the will of God for the season
[52:44] we're in because maybe the guy behind us
[52:48] is not at the corner yet
[52:50] because if you paused it there'd be one
[52:53] guy this way and one guy right here
[52:55] right at the corner but still going if
[52:58] this guy going this way looks at him and
[52:59] begins to judge him and say oh he's
[53:01] going the wrong way
[53:04] that guy can't turn then he's got to
[53:06] wait his turn
[53:07] God's will is seasonal it wasn't God's
[53:11] will for David to do what he did
[53:13] but then David learned a very very
[53:16] important lesson
[53:18] and David's again his brother says he
[53:20] never consulted God he consulted the
[53:22] priest he consulted the mighty man he
[53:24] consulted the people but he never
[53:26] consulted God
[53:28] and we want to be always aware
[53:31] especially always aware but especially
[53:33] in transitions in their lives we begin
[53:35] to see what we're doing just because we
[53:38] can do something doesn't mean we should
[53:43] just because David could get an auction
[53:45] cart and oxide never bore a burden oh it
[53:48] was spiritual
[53:50] doesn't mean he should
[53:52] and because he did he cost us life
[53:56] and brother says that's what happens
[53:59] when men take the word of God into their
[54:02] own hands he said they spiritually kill
[54:03] the people the same thing happens in
[54:05] your life when you say I'm gonna turn
[54:06] and you turn too soon you begin to die
[54:09] spiritually
[54:11] but then David goes back and says hey
[54:15] we need the Levites
[54:17] we need them to Bear the Earth because
[54:18] that's the way and you just read the
[54:20] stories both stories you see you can
[54:22] just tell by reading that David is a
[54:24] different person
[54:28] for for a for a season amen well
[54:32] so Jacob Heart in the right place flesh
[54:35] and control he steals the blessing
[54:38] and uh but all the while all along
[54:42] what does the Bible says the footsteps
[54:44] of the righteous are ordered of the Lord
[54:46] all along God was still in control
[54:54] amen now Isaac calls Esau and he says
[54:57] hey take your weapons and your quiver
[55:00] and your bow and go out into the field
[55:01] and get me some venison because I'm
[55:03] getting old and it's time to bless you
[55:06] Rebecca hears in the tent he she hears
[55:12] Isaac tell Esau this and she quickly
[55:15] goes to Jacob and she says I heard your
[55:18] father speak unto Esau
[55:21] she's so she said quick go get a lamb
[55:24] kill it I'll prepare it take the Lamb's
[55:26] fleece put it on you so you'll be hairy
[55:29] like Esau
[55:30] and Jacob
[55:31] goes into Esau and he says I am Esau thy
[55:34] firstborn I have done according as thou
[55:36] badest me arise I pray thee sit and eat
[55:39] of my venison that thy soul may bless me
[55:42] deceiving
[55:45] and then came to pass as soon as Isaac
[55:47] had made an end of blessing Jacob and
[55:49] Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the
[55:52] presence of Isaac his father Esau comes
[55:54] into camp
[55:57] what a way to just really strengthen
[56:00] your relationship with Esau
[56:07] his heart was in the right place
[56:10] but his flesh was in control
[56:13] and so he has to run away
[56:17] and Rebecca says now therefore my son
[56:20] obey my voice arise flee doubt to Laban
[56:23] my brother
[56:24] to Heron then Isaac before Jacob goes
[56:27] Isaac sends him away
[56:30] and he says go
[56:33] to Laban
[56:35] and Jacob's on this journey running and
[56:37] you and the fear building in his heart
[56:39] because Esau said I'm going to kill him
[56:42] if it's the last thing I do I'm gonna
[56:44] kill that boy
[56:46] and so Jacob goes and he now Jacob's
[56:48] running oh he was high and mighty you
[56:51] see God what God does God sometimes has
[56:54] to work layers off of our lives have to
[56:57] work layers off of our expectations till
[57:01] we can come face to face oh Jacob meets
[57:03] God and and he says he wakes out of his
[57:06] sleep and he says surely the Lord is in
[57:08] this place I'm going to call it Bethel
[57:10] but that didn't change him
[57:13] he met God oh it was a spiritual time
[57:16] he's running across the desert he's in a
[57:18] moment but then he gets to labor and he
[57:20] begins to deceive
[57:23] because who we are and what we are
[57:27] has to be done away with but God
[57:31] sometimes has to work in stages
[57:35] God has to sometimes take one layer off
[57:37] and then the next one and then the next
[57:40] one because why he's building the
[57:42] pressure
[57:43] he's preparing you so he meets Rachel
[57:47] and he kisses Rachel and he lifts up his
[57:50] voice and he wept this is the one
[57:52] Layman what do you want me to do for
[57:54] Rachel I'll serve me seven years
[57:57] now Jacob right wow he's he's got it all
[58:02] he's he he's in the land and he sells
[58:05] way far away his problems are buried in
[58:07] his past so you wonder where where
[58:09] western novels got their ideas from
[58:13] Jacob went into the to West and left his
[58:16] troubles in the east
[58:20] the man has been trying to do that since
[58:22] the dawn of time
[58:24] but there's a funny thing about triples
[58:26] they always catch back up
[58:28] so now Jacob is in is serving for Laban
[58:32] but Jacob
[58:34] has met his match
[58:37] oh God will bring somebody in your life
[58:40] who's your match
[58:42] somebody who points you
[58:46] to your Humanity
[58:48] somebody who brings you face to face
[58:52] with yourself
[58:54] and you look and you
[58:56] that's exactly what I do
[58:59] now I know how it feels
[59:02] what is God doing taking another layer
[59:05] off of Jacob
[59:08] so what does Jacob do surrender no
[59:12] came to pass in the morning behold It
[59:14] was Leah not Rachel
[59:15] and he goes stormy into Layman's house
[59:18] what have you done
[59:20] I served you for Rachel why have you
[59:22] beguiled me he says hey just just
[59:25] fulfill her week and I'll give you
[59:26] Rachel you work another seven years
[59:31] so Jacob says fine
[59:33] that's fine
[59:36] so then Jacob says hey
[59:39] seven years pass
[59:41] he says I need some cattle tell you what
[59:42] you give me I'll take all the ones with
[59:44] blemishes Mark string strength Rings
[59:47] whatever straight I think it is spotted
[59:49] I'll take him
[59:51] and so then Jacob deceives Laban now
[59:54] they're back and forth they're back and
[59:57] forth I mean Thanksgiving was awkward
[1:00:00] because Laban and Jacob would something
[1:00:03] would be brought up
[1:00:05] and
[1:00:11] but what it was what was it sometimes
[1:00:13] you know the science will tell you
[1:00:15] something there's a thing that in
[1:00:15] someone else that bothers you the most
[1:00:17] is your worst weakness your biggest
[1:00:20] weakness it's God
[1:00:23] putting you face to face with yourself
[1:00:27] and when you look at yourself face to
[1:00:29] face and then all you can do as a child
[1:00:31] of God because I'm not talking about
[1:00:33] the others I'm talking about the child
[1:00:34] of God because the child of God has a
[1:00:36] desire to change a desire to change that
[1:00:38] outweighs the pain it takes to drink
[1:00:41] that cup he looks at you you look at
[1:00:43] yourself face to face and you wrestle
[1:00:47] you wrestle
[1:00:48] you go and you pray and you say you just
[1:00:51] you pray to God and you and
[1:00:54] and you sometimes you're praying and he
[1:00:56] says no no you got it all wrong
[1:00:59] you misunderstand
[1:01:01] this is how it is but you pour your
[1:01:04] heart out to God he said I don't
[1:01:06] understand why it's like this what are
[1:01:08] you doing you're wrestling it out with
[1:01:11] God
[1:01:14] there are transitions when you come to a
[1:01:16] transition in your life
[1:01:18] you have to wrestle it out with God
[1:01:23] you have to say God was your will and he
[1:01:25] wants to see you press he wants to see
[1:01:28] you persevere he wants to put you under
[1:01:30] pressure
[1:01:31] he wants to leave his mark on you
[1:01:34] he wants you to know he had to put
[1:01:36] brother Branham through that in South
[1:01:38] Africa because he needed brother random
[1:01:40] to be totally completely sold out 110
[1:01:44] percent and God saw a little part of
[1:01:46] brother Branham I was willing to go with
[1:01:49] the crowd so he pressed him
[1:01:53] and then God brought the word then God
[1:01:56] the sunset Mountain and all of that
[1:01:58] happened then God bought the word God
[1:02:01] sees you all you say
[1:02:05] they snuck they they they they took
[1:02:08] people to to pretend to be disciples to
[1:02:10] deceive Jesus
[1:02:13] God sees right through your mask I don't
[1:02:17] see through your mask
[1:02:18] but God does
[1:02:20] when you sit in church and you smile and
[1:02:22] Nod like you got it all under control
[1:02:24] God sees through your mask
[1:02:26] I can't
[1:02:31] God knows exactly what to do to bring
[1:02:34] you face to face
[1:02:35] with your Humanity
[1:02:40] the cattle were feeble he put them not
[1:02:42] in with the
[1:02:45] stripped bark
[1:02:47] the the trees that had the bark strip
[1:02:49] from them and the feebler were labans
[1:02:51] and the stronger were Jacobs
[1:02:54] Funny Thing Happened Jacob beheld the
[1:02:56] confidence of Labor and behold it was
[1:02:57] not toward him as before
[1:03:01] he began to realize that Laban wasn't
[1:03:04] very happy because you looked at the two
[1:03:06] herds and it was obvious Jacobs was
[1:03:09] Stronger
[1:03:14] and Laban and and uh so Jacob stole away
[1:03:18] unawares to Layman the Syrian in that he
[1:03:20] told him not that he fled Jacob's
[1:03:23] running again
[1:03:27] this time he's older he's got wives
[1:03:29] children cattle
[1:03:31] but he's running again what his problems
[1:03:35] came back only it has a different name
[1:03:38] instead of Esau it's Laban but you see
[1:03:40] what happened
[1:03:42] Jacob was in a position we we call a
[1:03:45] pickle
[1:03:46] he had Laban on that side and Esau on
[1:03:50] that side why because God said I'll let
[1:03:53] not let my son remain in this condition
[1:03:57] now in Jacob's condition he needed
[1:04:00] if we could say this the Holy Ghost
[1:04:03] but what if you have the Holy Ghost but
[1:04:05] it's time for you to step higher so he
[1:04:08] puts you between a Laban and an Esau
[1:04:12] and now all you can do
[1:04:15] all you can do you can't go to somebody
[1:04:17] for an answer
[1:04:20] you can't go to somebody for an answer
[1:04:21] all you can do is wrestle it out with
[1:04:24] God
[1:04:25] there are positions like that sometimes
[1:04:27] we come to you can get a word of
[1:04:29] encouragement but there's certain things
[1:04:31] we go through words you and God
[1:04:34] and you have to wrestle it out what God
[1:04:37] did was he left Jacob no other option
[1:04:42] why because he loves you so he leaves
[1:04:45] you no other option so we wrestle
[1:04:50] but you see the will of God is enduring
[1:04:53] it's seasonal and it's enduring
[1:04:56] God says it doesn't matter the world
[1:04:58] says wow what a mess God said it doesn't
[1:05:00] matter
[1:05:01] I'll endure
[1:05:03] Islander
[1:05:05] because I know they'll come I know when
[1:05:09] they get to that position because the
[1:05:10] world looks on and the record says
[1:05:11] Jacob's a mess Jacob has ruined it
[1:05:15] but God says now I have an appointment
[1:05:18] with Jacob
[1:05:20] God says no I can see Jacob's heart and
[1:05:23] I know exactly what he needs
[1:05:25] he say oh I wish things were different
[1:05:29] I wish I was like that person I wish I
[1:05:32] was this you know I got on the car the
[1:05:34] other day and I heard a denominational
[1:05:35] preacher on the radio and he tore my
[1:05:38] height off
[1:05:40] God can use things sometimes right on
[1:05:43] time I came in mid-sermon
[1:05:45] and he said the children of Israel were
[1:05:47] walking to the desert their shoes
[1:05:48] weren't new but they didn't need to be
[1:05:50] replaced
[1:05:52] their clothes were old
[1:05:54] but they were in perfect condition they
[1:05:57] had nothing but they lacked nothing
[1:06:06] and I thought okay God
[1:06:10] you never lack anything
[1:06:13] you never lack anything oh it was Manna
[1:06:16] again but you weren't going hungry
[1:06:20] it was quail again
[1:06:22] how many ways can mom cook quail
[1:06:26] you know there was there was uh things
[1:06:29] on people's news feeds you know 101 ways
[1:06:31] to cook quail
[1:06:34] life hack he didn't know about manna
[1:06:40] but they lacked nothing
[1:06:43] sometimes we say oh whoa it's me and
[1:06:47] you're sinning
[1:06:49] in a perfect position
[1:06:51] you lack nothing
[1:06:53] God promised he would never ever ever
[1:06:57] leave you or forsake you has he
[1:07:05] we look and we look at Jacob in between
[1:07:07] Laban and Esau we look at ourselves in
[1:07:10] between Laban and Esau we say God
[1:07:12] forsaken me
[1:07:14] Jacob said God you have a promise please
[1:07:16] keep it
[1:07:18] but then Jacob
[1:07:19] still tried
[1:07:22] Jacob still did his thing see God was
[1:07:25] pulling Jacob God was leading Jacob
[1:07:28] because
[1:07:30] Jacob sent you know the two people the
[1:07:33] two bands but the bands and then he
[1:07:35] takes his family and he and he sends
[1:07:37] them in phases and and then he takes all
[1:07:39] these girls excuse me takes his family
[1:07:40] and he sends all these gifts and faces
[1:07:42] and then he sends his family and then
[1:07:44] he's alone
[1:07:47] Genesis 32 says in
[1:07:53] verse 23 and he took them and sent them
[1:07:55] over the brook and sent over that he had
[1:07:58] and Jacob was left alone
[1:08:02] there's a semicolon there in other words
[1:08:04] there's a space of time
[1:08:07] there's a space of time the punctuation
[1:08:10] the Bible is perfect
[1:08:11] it's God's word there was a space of
[1:08:14] time Jacob was left alone
[1:08:17] when you see God was giving Jacob no
[1:08:21] other option
[1:08:22] we will scratch and scramble till we're
[1:08:26] down to no options and then we say
[1:08:31] we're all alone
[1:08:34] and God says
[1:08:36] now that you're alone
[1:08:38] I'll come talk to you
[1:08:43] but Jacob had to have the pressure build
[1:08:48] Jacob was not ready to meet God face to
[1:08:51] face Jacob had met his Humanity face to
[1:08:54] face and realized his weakness
[1:08:57] he realized his weakness
[1:09:00] and so he's trying to beg Esau for mercy
[1:09:06] and so God says Jacob's ready
[1:09:09] and Jacob was left alone and there
[1:09:11] Wrestled a man with him until the
[1:09:13] breaking of the day
[1:09:16] in other words
[1:09:17] they wrestled all night long
[1:09:22] sometimes we have to wrestle all year
[1:09:24] long
[1:09:28] sometimes longer than that
[1:09:33] wrestle wrestling Jacob wrestling what
[1:09:36] was he wrestling with he knew what he
[1:09:38] had a hold of
[1:09:40] he knew what he had to hold of he was
[1:09:44] now face to face with God
[1:09:46] and he held on tight he said God I can't
[1:09:49] do this alone
[1:09:52] when Jacob says I'm not letting you go
[1:09:55] till I get a blessing Tigger wasn't
[1:09:57] talking about just a feel-good thing
[1:09:59] Jacob wanted overcoming power Jacob was
[1:10:03] in the position he was because of what
[1:10:06] he had done and he did not want to be in
[1:10:09] control anymore
[1:10:12] so he held on to the Angel sometimes
[1:10:18] a lot of times
[1:10:20] we just have to wrestle it out
[1:10:23] we come to a corner
[1:10:26] we can't see the corner yet
[1:10:29] God's Building it
[1:10:30] in our life a transition
[1:10:33] that's what the trouble is why is there
[1:10:36] trouble there because God's Will has
[1:10:38] Departed the other direction
[1:10:40] and he doesn't want you outside of his
[1:10:42] will
[1:10:43] so you come to that transition you come
[1:10:44] to that corner and everything's falling
[1:10:47] apart nothing's working as well as it
[1:10:49] used to and what do we do in our
[1:10:50] Humanity we force it get a bigger hammer
[1:10:54] so we force it
[1:10:56] but God says no no my will changed I'm
[1:10:58] over here now
[1:11:00] so he stirs up the trouble he stirs up
[1:11:03] the trouble in our life in the church he
[1:11:05] stirs up the trouble
[1:11:07] and then we come face to face and we say
[1:11:10] oh
[1:11:12] God's this way
[1:11:15] the Unseen path
[1:11:18] the Unseen path
[1:11:20] we haven't walked that way before
[1:11:22] we have not you have not gone this way
[1:11:25] before Israel so follow the ark
[1:11:29] follow the word amen
[1:11:32] when the word steps into the water then
[1:11:34] the path was seen because the word
[1:11:37] reveals the path it's only unseen
[1:11:40] there's portions of the path for us that
[1:11:42] are unseen but the path we need today is
[1:11:44] not don't get stuck trying to figure out
[1:11:47] the future
[1:11:48] walk the path you can see
[1:11:52] don't worry about
[1:11:54] this is a very carnal example but
[1:11:57] and not to say one person is better than
[1:11:58] the other so I won't even say who's who
[1:12:00] I'll just have two people one person you
[1:12:02] just tell them you know just drive down
[1:12:04] the road you'll see it on your right
[1:12:05] okay
[1:12:06] the person says no no no no I need the
[1:12:08] map and how many feet how many miles two
[1:12:12] miles three miles
[1:12:13] you'll just see a big rock and it's got
[1:12:15] like this weird little thing to it the
[1:12:17] other person says sweet I got it I'll
[1:12:18] turn right there okay and they'll just
[1:12:20] drive and drive and drive and drive
[1:12:23] never fearing never worrying until they
[1:12:25] see the rock with the funny little thing
[1:12:26] on it but other people say no I need the
[1:12:28] map I need to I need to know what's out
[1:12:31] there God wants us to what was that
[1:12:33] other person doing driving by faith God
[1:12:35] wants us to walk the path by faith we
[1:12:37] don't need to see what is on that chair
[1:12:41] we don't need to see what's sinning the
[1:12:43] opportunity sitting on that chair we
[1:12:44] don't need to see it yet
[1:12:46] because we're not there
[1:12:49] we don't need to see the opportunity
[1:12:50] that God has for us up there in the
[1:12:53] Unseen path because we're not there yet
[1:12:55] as soon as we need to see it we'll see a
[1:12:58] sign that says turn right here
[1:13:03] God brought Jacob to this position
[1:13:06] but Jacob God brought Jacob to this
[1:13:08] position but Jacob still had to wrestle
[1:13:13] still had to have sleepless nights still
[1:13:16] had to have burdens he couldn't Express
[1:13:18] still had to have frustrations he
[1:13:20] couldn't handle
[1:13:22] but he still had to do one thing just
[1:13:24] keep going back to God and wrestling it
[1:13:27] out
[1:13:28] just keep going back to God and
[1:13:30] wrestling it out Lord what is your will
[1:13:33] please lead me to it
[1:13:37] there's always trouble at the corner
[1:13:39] there's trouble at Jacob's corner
[1:13:47] and he said he says well what do you
[1:13:49] want oh he's wrestling it out it's dark
[1:13:52] you know when it's you ever tried to
[1:13:53] walk in the dark you're trippy it twist
[1:13:55] your it just it's a pain wrestling in
[1:13:58] the dark you know boom I didn't know
[1:14:00] that tree was there and
[1:14:02] the angel says the light's coming I
[1:14:04] gotta go what do you want
[1:14:07] and he says I want the blessing so the
[1:14:10] angel says thy name shall be called No
[1:14:13] More Jacob but Israel for as a prince
[1:14:17] hast thou power with God and with me
[1:14:19] with men and Hast prevailed
[1:14:25] then Jacob walked different
[1:14:27] he wrestled with the eight you wrestled
[1:14:30] with the word of God God gave you the
[1:14:31] Holy Ghost you walked different
[1:14:33] but then you come to times in your life
[1:14:35] where God says it's time for you to come
[1:14:37] higher up
[1:14:38] wrestle with me wrestle with me wrestle
[1:14:42] with you what you can't see Jacob
[1:14:44] couldn't see what he was wrestling with
[1:14:46] he could feel it though
[1:14:48] he could feel it
[1:14:53] and then God said
[1:14:55] you now have the power you have
[1:14:57] prevailed
[1:15:01] the rest of that quote
[1:15:03] he says The Lion and the root of David
[1:15:04] has prevailed has overcome he says like
[1:15:07] Jacob being sir planter and when he got
[1:15:10] in contact with the angel he held on and
[1:15:13] the angel tried to pull away and he said
[1:15:16] why are the Angels trying to pull away
[1:15:17] was God trying to abandon Jacob no God
[1:15:19] was pressing Jacob again
[1:15:22] Jacob's wrestling with the angel and God
[1:15:24] says no there's still a part of you
[1:15:27] there's still some of you left and so he
[1:15:29] tried to get away
[1:15:30] and then Jacob said whatever it takes
[1:15:33] I'm staying here
[1:15:36] that might not be a literal physical
[1:15:38] location
[1:15:40] that might be
[1:15:42] a spiritual location
[1:15:44] he said God I'm just going to keep
[1:15:46] praying
[1:15:47] God I'm going to keep praying because we
[1:15:49] have lives we have to work we have to
[1:15:50] get up in the morning we've got to take
[1:15:51] care of the kids we gotta we gotta come
[1:15:53] to church we gotta do our duties at the
[1:15:54] church take care of the church do all
[1:15:56] these things
[1:15:58] but we keep praying amen we keep we stay
[1:16:01] in that position we position we say God
[1:16:03] I I haven't forgotten I haven't
[1:16:05] forgotten God
[1:16:06] please show me
[1:16:09] Lord okay okay Lord I don't I don't need
[1:16:11] to know what's the opportunity on that
[1:16:14] chair I don't I don't need to know God
[1:16:15] just show me the next step because I'm
[1:16:18] standing here and the light is
[1:16:20] Illuminating a path that has ended
[1:16:22] where do I go
[1:16:26] and then he swings the light and you say
[1:16:29] oh the path turned the corner
[1:16:32] if you just barge on the light stops
[1:16:34] back there and you fall off the cliff
[1:16:38] because you're walking a path you have
[1:16:40] not walked before
[1:16:41] at every point in your life every day
[1:16:44] you get up it might be the same thing
[1:16:45] again
[1:16:46] but it's a path you haven't walked
[1:16:49] before you say God what's your will
[1:16:52] today what is God's will for today his
[1:16:55] word for today
[1:16:57] his word will show you because his word
[1:17:00] is a light Thy word is a lamp unto my
[1:17:02] feet and a light unto my path
[1:17:06] you'll never catch the corner unless you
[1:17:09] stay consecrated to God
[1:17:11] so start there first
[1:17:14] start there first
[1:17:15] when you come to the corner don't be so
[1:17:17] quick to say wow the devil is really
[1:17:19] fighting this
[1:17:20] stop and check yourself
[1:17:22] make sure
[1:17:24] it might be god pushing you like he did
[1:17:27] Jacob Jacob said Jacob was mad at
[1:17:29] leaving because Laban comes after him
[1:17:30] says you stole my God you took my kids
[1:17:32] everything I don't even say goodbye you
[1:17:34] took and then he can't find the gods
[1:17:36] because his wife is sitting on them
[1:17:39] and then Jacob gets really upset how
[1:17:42] dare you right I'm you know I have
[1:17:44] nothing but troubles from you
[1:17:47] Jacob was just as much to blame as
[1:17:49] leaving was
[1:17:57] but Jacob overcame
[1:17:59] and you and I will overcome
[1:18:06] one last example here
[1:18:09] first Samuel 16 verse 11 to 13 can turn
[1:18:12] or write it down and Samuel said unto
[1:18:14] Jesse I hear all thy children and he
[1:18:17] said There remaineth Yet the youngest
[1:18:19] and behold he keepeth the Sheep
[1:18:22] and Samuel said unto Jesse's sin and
[1:18:24] fetch him for we will not sit down till
[1:18:26] he come hither
[1:18:28] that's a polite way of saying do what I
[1:18:30] told you to do
[1:18:32] and he sent and brought him in and now
[1:18:35] he was ready and with all of a beautiful
[1:18:37] countenance
[1:18:39] and goodly to look to in other words he
[1:18:41] didn't look very rugged he didn't look
[1:18:43] like a king
[1:18:45] and the Lord said arise anoint him for
[1:18:47] this is he
[1:18:49] over and over again in the Bible
[1:18:52] God uses men
[1:18:54] who we don't expect
[1:18:59] why
[1:19:02] because he wants you to look to him
[1:19:07] not them that's right
[1:19:11] he doesn't want you to look at me
[1:19:14] he wants you to look at him
[1:19:22] and Samuel took
[1:19:24] and he sent and brought him in and he
[1:19:26] okay and the Lord said arise anoint him
[1:19:29] for this is he Samuel
[1:19:32] let me just I want to make sure I get my
[1:19:34] facts straight real fast let me turn to
[1:19:35] First Samuel my Bible here first Samuel
[1:19:39] chapter 16.
[1:19:59] so the first the first one comes in 16
[1:20:03] Verse 6 came to pass when they overcome
[1:20:05] that he looked on eliab and said surely
[1:20:07] the Lord's anointed is before him but
[1:20:09] the Lord said unto Samuel look on his
[1:20:10] countenance are on the height of his
[1:20:12] statue because I have refused him for
[1:20:13] the Lord seeth not as a man seeth for
[1:20:15] man looketh on the outward appearance
[1:20:16] but the Lord looketh on the heart
[1:20:19] and then he he goes to abinadab
[1:20:23] and it doesn't say God spoke to Samuel
[1:20:26] because God already said it
[1:20:29] God doesn't repeat himself
[1:20:32] he says it he gives you the word and
[1:20:34] then he wants to see he wants to see you
[1:20:37] walk by it tell Samuel don't look on the
[1:20:39] countenance and then the Lord goes quiet
[1:20:43] I've been in that comes and then the
[1:20:45] next one comes the next one comes and
[1:20:47] Samuel Now isn't going off how he feels
[1:20:50] he's going off the word saying is this
[1:20:52] is this The Wanted God's not audibly
[1:20:55] speaking to him but Samuel's looking
[1:20:57] basing off the word say no not this guy
[1:20:59] no not this guy
[1:21:01] then he comes to David and then
[1:21:03] he says arise
[1:21:04] anoint him for this is he then Samuel
[1:21:07] took the Horn of oil and anointed him in
[1:21:09] the midst of his Brethren and the spirit
[1:21:12] of the Lord Came Upon David from that
[1:21:13] day forward so Samuel rose up and went
[1:21:16] to Rhema the spirit of the Lord came on
[1:21:19] David from that point forward
[1:21:22] now came to pass when evil spirit from
[1:21:24] God was upon Saul that David took and
[1:21:25] harp and played with his hand to so Saul
[1:21:27] was refreshed and was well in the evil
[1:21:29] spirit departed from him David man wow
[1:21:33] what a position he's an aide to the king
[1:21:36] he helps the king
[1:21:38] he's anointed by Samuel anointed by God
[1:21:41] through Samuel he's helping the king
[1:21:48] first Samuel 17 51 the battle with
[1:21:50] Goliath therefore David ran and stood
[1:21:52] upon the Philistine and took his sword
[1:21:53] and Drew it out of the sheath thereof
[1:21:55] and slew him and cut off his head there
[1:21:56] with and when the Philistine saw the
[1:21:58] champion was dead they fled another
[1:22:00] great High moment
[1:22:02] David
[1:22:03] a hero
[1:22:05] the anointed hero
[1:22:09] Saul took him that day and would let him
[1:22:11] go no more home to his father's house
[1:22:13] full-time employee
[1:22:16] top of the food chain right next to the
[1:22:19] king it's Jonathan's his buddy I mean
[1:22:21] son of the king Jonathan wow that's my
[1:22:23] best friend he was name dropping
[1:22:26] he said yeah Jonathan my best friend
[1:22:27] yeah Jonathan is my best friend David
[1:22:33] lifted up
[1:22:35] everything's going well he's right there
[1:22:37] at the king he said okay one day the
[1:22:39] king's gonna get old and die and he's
[1:22:40] gonna say I hand my scepter off to you
[1:22:42] David
[1:22:45] and David went out with this River Saul
[1:22:47] sent him and behaved himself wisely and
[1:22:49] Saul sent him over the men of War
[1:22:51] promotion
[1:22:53] and he was accepted in the sight of all
[1:22:55] the people and also in the sight of Soul
[1:22:57] servants lifted up in the church high up
[1:22:59] in the church looked upon
[1:23:01] looked up to in the church
[1:23:05] then it all changed
[1:23:07] Saul cast the javelin for he said I will
[1:23:09] Smite David even to the wall with it and
[1:23:11] David avoided out of his presence twice
[1:23:15] what
[1:23:17] in a moment's time everything for David
[1:23:20] changed
[1:23:22] what was God doing
[1:23:23] God said no no you're not ready yet
[1:23:27] you're not ready yet
[1:23:28] why bring David to that position and
[1:23:32] then have Saul through a javelin at him
[1:23:34] why not start there
[1:23:37] because God loves to bring you up
[1:23:39] he says and that vase doesn't look right
[1:23:42] and smash the clay back down
[1:23:45] why because in that smashing
[1:23:49] characters built
[1:23:52] David was a good man after God's heart
[1:23:54] but their character was not yet so that
[1:23:57] he could rule the kingdom
[1:24:01] so God smashed him back down
[1:24:03] by Brother Saul throwing a javelin at
[1:24:06] him
[1:24:09] brother Saul
[1:24:12] throwing a javelin at him
[1:24:14] not denominational Saul brother Saul
[1:24:22] what's going on
[1:24:24] Saul was yet the more afraid of David
[1:24:26] and Saul became David's enemy
[1:24:29] continually
[1:24:31] I'm just hopping these scriptures here
[1:24:33] to tell the story
[1:24:36] once looked up to like another father
[1:24:38] Jonathan his best friend everything's
[1:24:40] going well then Saul hates his guts
[1:24:44] forgive me if that was a little bit
[1:24:46] crude Saul can't stand him
[1:24:52] so he throws a javelin twice
[1:24:54] and Saul speak to Jonathan his son and
[1:24:56] to all his servants that they would kill
[1:24:58] David
[1:24:59] the hell Council
[1:25:01] David was gone
[1:25:02] probably off doing the king's business
[1:25:04] wise in his countenance and so it has a
[1:25:07] meeting and how we're going to bring
[1:25:08] David down
[1:25:10] even telling Jonathan his best friend
[1:25:14] kids kill David
[1:25:18] now for a third time Saul sought to
[1:25:20] Smite David even to the wall with the
[1:25:22] javelin but He Slipped Away out of
[1:25:24] Saul's presence and he smoked the
[1:25:25] javelin into the wall and David fled and
[1:25:27] escaped that night
[1:25:29] now David is running
[1:25:34] what what what why
[1:25:38] did Saul have to throw the javelin again
[1:25:39] because David wasn't running yet
[1:25:42] God said David I need you running
[1:25:44] I need you running David Saul
[1:25:47] throw the javelin again
[1:25:50] a third time Peter denied the Lord three
[1:25:53] times
[1:25:54] a third time he throws a javelin what
[1:25:57] everything's falling apart for David
[1:26:02] no it's not
[1:26:05] none of these men in David's life were
[1:26:08] outside of the church
[1:26:10] they were here
[1:26:15] throws the gentleman against Saul David
[1:26:16] runs and now now David has still has
[1:26:19] Jonathan and Jonathan says look I'll go
[1:26:22] talk to Dad and I'll shoot the arrows
[1:26:24] and you can go with the story at home
[1:26:26] and you know if I tell the boy run and
[1:26:28] get the arrows so on and so forth
[1:26:30] and David fled from neoff in Raymond
[1:26:32] came and said before Jonathan what have
[1:26:34] I done
[1:26:35] Lord what did I do what is wrong
[1:26:40] thing David
[1:26:42] nothing
[1:26:43] and I say to you tonight nothing
[1:26:47] is wrong
[1:26:49] you're just 20 degrees from perfect
[1:26:51] pressure
[1:26:54] because God never misses a shot
[1:26:56] what have I done what is mine iniquity
[1:26:58] and what is my sin before thy father
[1:27:00] that he seeketh my life
[1:27:02] they had no reasons
[1:27:06] they had no reasons to kill Jesus they
[1:27:08] had to make things up
[1:27:10] Mana Belial hair to that see no fault in
[1:27:13] this man
[1:27:15] we can take the types of David another
[1:27:17] sermon
[1:27:18] as soon as the lad was gone David arose
[1:27:21] out of a place toward the South fell on
[1:27:23] his face to the ground and bound himself
[1:27:24] three times and they kissed one another
[1:27:26] Jonathan him and Jonathan and wept one
[1:27:28] with another until David exceeded the
[1:27:31] word exceeded there means until David
[1:27:32] composed himself
[1:27:34] he says okay
[1:27:36] this is where we are this is what's
[1:27:38] happening I don't understand it but I
[1:27:40] know God's in control and David runs
[1:27:45] David runs and he runs and he runs and
[1:27:48] he runs and he's in the cave and then
[1:27:50] and then he's he's in the Philistines
[1:27:53] camp
[1:27:54] then his family gets attacked
[1:27:59] and he's constantly told go ahead take
[1:28:02] Saul's Life by brother abishad go ahead
[1:28:09] take Saul all your troubles will be over
[1:28:11] just kill him and David says no
[1:28:14] because why it was not yet God's season
[1:28:17] for David to be king
[1:28:20] you say but that's a pure and an
[1:28:22] honorable thing to to get rid of Saul
[1:28:25] the man who's causing Israel all of
[1:28:27] these troubles
[1:28:30] go ahead you know nobody will everybody
[1:28:33] will thank you
[1:28:35] go ahead run him through
[1:28:38] you see you see why there's trouble at
[1:28:41] the corner because it's all good both
[1:28:43] ways
[1:28:44] but only one way is God's will only one
[1:28:46] way is God's season
[1:28:49] only one way
[1:28:51] what was God's will is not God's will
[1:28:54] today
[1:28:56] amen for a time it was Eliza Rebecca and
[1:28:59] Isaac Eliza's pointing saying that's
[1:29:01] Isaac Rebecca's running off the camel
[1:29:04] for a moment in time it was God's will a
[1:29:06] god season but then Eliezer left
[1:29:08] God made a transition
[1:29:12] now the same thing in you and I
[1:29:14] there's a point in time where we come to
[1:29:16] a transition where God calls us
[1:29:18] to go running
[1:29:21] from what what was God doing stripping
[1:29:23] David down
[1:29:25] tell it was just David all alone
[1:29:29] see well he was surrounded by men yeah
[1:29:30] men who said kill Saul
[1:29:35] and then men who were ready to kill
[1:29:36] David because
[1:29:37] the stuff and the women were gone
[1:29:40] David all alone Time After Time After
[1:29:43] Time God stripped David down to nothing
[1:29:45] took him to a position of nothing
[1:29:49] and so
[1:29:50] we wrestle
[1:29:53] and wrestle and wrestle but the will of
[1:29:56] God is enduring
[1:29:59] the will of God is enduring and God
[1:30:03] gives us the strength to again get up
[1:30:06] in that Dusty crummy old cave
[1:30:10] and say maybe today's the day
[1:30:13] but not my will thine will be done
[1:30:17] because one day
[1:30:19] will be the day you see the corner
[1:30:23] then
[1:30:25] then
[1:30:26] but until then you keep wrestling
[1:30:31] and don't worry
[1:30:33] God's will will endure amen
[1:30:37] until you're in the position God wants
[1:30:40] you to be amen that's powerheads
[1:30:45] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[1:30:49] it's no
[1:30:50] easy thing to come face to face with
[1:30:52] ourselves Lord
[1:30:55] it's no easy thing to have to wrestle
[1:30:57] wrestle these things out with you Lord
[1:31:01] but father
[1:31:05] you give us the strength to do so
[1:31:11] you stripped David down but you never
[1:31:13] left him
[1:31:15] he stripped Jacob down but you never
[1:31:16] left him you were there
[1:31:18] you were always there
[1:31:21] and you're always here
[1:31:24] every day we go you're here every day we

[1:31:54] lose another part of ourselves to lay
[1:31:57] down another part to surrender another
[1:31:59] portion of ourselves that's the only way
[1:32:01] for us to step higher up
[1:32:07] the angel came and ministered unto
[1:32:09] him after he surrendered and brought him
[1:32:14] higher up
[1:32:17] God help us Lord Jesus
[1:32:20] Lord we all pray we have the desire to

[1:32:37] discrepancies that you have caused me to
[1:32:39] come face to face with give me the
