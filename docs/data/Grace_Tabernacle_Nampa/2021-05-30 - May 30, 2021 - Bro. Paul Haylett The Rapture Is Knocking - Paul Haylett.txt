this i wanted a million [Music] [Music] spoken and clarified so clearly we could change the words of this song and say i have proof amen not some future tense of i might or it might be a possibility but i have proved that i'm one in a million and i am showing my my brother and sister let's look at the world around us and look what's happening and you'll see that there's such a great influence that that has come upon the world today that around us uh people are just compromising right and left and it's going to take an absolute infilling of the holy ghost which i believe god is fulfilling right now to stand in the hour that we are living and not compromise amen i'm i'm so glad that we can say thank you lord that we can stand on your word and not compromise on it amen uh so just uh just uh oh my my heart is stirred today i hope um as we speak today that uh i can convey to you the enthusiasm by which this topic had come to me and i hope you can take this with just a tad bit of humor but when our brother david was preaching a couple sundays ago i think i probably missed part of the service because i had a pen and a paper and i was just scribbling things down as fast as i could because an inspiration hit me and and i i just was thanking the lord amen you know let's just remember our kids uh going to camp our young people i should say not kids but our young people uh going to be going to camp and you know i pray you know what an awkward world we live in but i pray more of our young people if the lord tarries uh more of our young people next year will be able uh to go to school getting out late lots of factors that were there but uh anyway just let's be faithful i believe it's tuesday that they're leaving and going to spend this uh uh this coming week and through the weekend uh i i don't want our kids just come home and say i had fun as i mentioned the other day i don't want them to come home and say i'm so happy my team won at volleyball or soccer i want them to come home saying you know what i have a greater appreciation for who i am in jesus christ i know that i've been filled with the holy ghost and i know that i've made a decision to stand amen so let's remember them in prayer amen now i put this as a side note brother chris sent out to the youth group and i believe it would be the sunday afternoon of june 13th that youth group will be taking place at brother chris's house they'll be gone on the regular scheduled camp and so um let me say this carefully grace kids is not just following along uh in in some footsteps but still for the sake of the parents and and what is happening um we have if you would call it permission from brother sergey and sister yulia once again used their home so on sunday the 13th we will also have grace kids at brother sergey and sister yulia's house also so that makes it convenient for the parents when they come bring their older children to the youth group that it makes it very easy instead of having some split thing so i will announce this in this context uh grace kids will be meeting sunday june 13th five o'clock brother sergey and sister yulia's house and i have to say brother chris brought the youth group on himself but we have pressed the kids of sergey and sister yulia so we just say thank you uh they have a lovely backyard and it just is very convenient and we appreciate uh what they're doing and also i don't know that we announced that brother trevor and sister kerry are hosting a fellowship this afternoon and uh so i believe they have uh made everyone welcome if you didn't receive an invitation personally uh you know as someone like sending you a monogrammed letter uh you're all welcome that's how it works i don't want it ever to be that we have a fellowship that someone says i was not invited let me declare it to the heavens when there is a fellowship in this church that is termed as a fellowship everyone's invited don't don't use the excuse don't let the devil anoint you with the deal well i didn't get invited because let me just drop a note to you about two-thirds of the time i'm not invited but brother adam hit this right on the head yesterday where two or three are gathered in my name and then he laid this out and says we're family you see my brother and sister brother branham lays it in the message he says i didn't get invited to be a branham i was born of random my brother and sister we don't need an invitation to call ourselves part of the family of god here in grace tabernacle we were born into this god ordained this so anyone who ever lifts up this thing i wasn't invited i'm here right now this morning to just kill that spirit that the fact that it's happening you're invited now let me put it in a context all you old people if they're having a birthday for a four-year-old or three-year-old or a two-year-old or an eight-year-old that doesn't necessarily mean you're invited so let's separate the differences of what is happening you know we don't want to show up well anyway i'll just my shoe isn't that clean and i don't really feel like chewing on it so we'll just stop right there amen i'd like to speak to you once again saints um on redemption's we believe amen that the word of god will produce exactly what it said it would when he said let there be light we didn't have to come with a scientific cosmic explanation of how there's a possibility of light he said let there be light and there was light amen and so we are here today knowing that the word of god has declared there must be a manifestation right the seventh seal is the full plan of redemption completed amen not not talking about it the possibilities of what could be or how it might work but you see we have to understand my brother and sister just like our healing amen any of you need healing today i want you to just be able today to confess i'm not waiting for my healing my healing has already been purchased it's already finished and i believe it is my healing amen and so we just want to be able to realize that this whole plan of god this great mystery of god was for one purpose and that was to bring about redemption and it is a completed work we're not waiting for it to happen but it is done amen let's just stand we want to remember today our brother vasily out on the road and i don't know of any of those that we might forget forgive us today uh there'll be those that are not present with us today and and uh we just remember them uh in our hearts our brother bob sister joanne of course um i was visiting my mother yesterday and she just wanted you all to know that um she she loves you and appreciates you and um you know she she has that app and she goes and you know has some circumstances that keeps her from listening to the whole service they're pretty rigid about lunch is it 12 o'clock and she said so i don't get to hear what's beyond 12 o'clock because my long-winded preacher son it goes well beyond 12 o'clock and so i don't get to hear that but anyway she's thinking of you she's praying for you and wants to be remembered of you so and always we remember in our hearts brother prashant sister concha amen let's just turn your bibles this morning to matthew the seventh chapter the seventh first to the tenth and i want to speak to you today on the rapture is knocking amen so we are not my brother and sister just simply waiting there's no signs there's nothing but it literally is at the door and i had a much longer title and i will just share that i decided for reasons to just cut it down simple but the rapture is knocking at the door of your heart amen now the prophet of god shows us that the heart is a doorway into the soul and so it's knocking on our heart and when he gets each one of us beyond that point that it is complete it is finished work amongst the whole bride of christ we'll see a rapture it is not a fallacy uh you know you read some people's words and they say well do we have a scriptural uh evidence as it were of a rapture well my brother and sister uh those that believe say yes those that don't believe say no isn't that normal are there ufos those that believe say yes and those that don't believe say no is there healing those that believe say yes those that believe don't believe say no so it doesn't matter what we're talking about it's the position that you and i take oh i want to take sides with a word ever whatever the word says that's what i want to take sides with amen amen matthew the seventh chapter ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you now i want to just interject this real quick here my brother and sister the rapture is knocking on the door of our hearts i want to ask you today are you knocking on the door of the rapture you've got to want to be part of that you've got to be seeking it also whom if his son ask bread we'll give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent heavenly father we ask you today lord move in our midst and speak to our hearts father we look at the world around us and father we thank you that the prophet of god so clearly brought it to us that the greatest battle ever fought would not be over land it would not be over some kind of possession but the greatest battle ever fought would be in the mind and lord knowing that is a gateway father for our hearts and our hearts to our soul we realize how satan would battle for our mind control of the mind so greatly and lord we're in the world and the world is around us but we are not part of it and father i thank you for that that you've given us a place or a way to escape to let off the pressure and we i believe each one of us would recognize what it is lord to be subject to the pressures of this life those ones those things that would come and cause us to to disagree be grumpy angry maybe even lord help us shout and be completely upset with those we love with all of our heart and then we would recognize this is nothing but satan trying to pressurize us but lord you said that the pressure would drive the bride into and desperation would drive us not away from you lord oh thank you lord how this come out so clearly to us lord but desperation would drive us into the presence of god oh father let that be in our hearts and lives today we thank you father for your word and ask you to remember our brother david sister diane sister ruth lord as they would travel for the saints father that would be far flung lord would maybe hear even my brother jake this morning lord somewhere in montana on his way home father with this situation that's happened to sister lisa lord just bring a peace bring a comfort deal kindly with him and with them today lord father we love you and adore you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated saints as we would look at these words i felt led to use this scripture because here it is speaking to you and i in a very positive tense that um what we have asked for shall be given us amen the scripture says that you have not because you ask not and then when you get in a position where you are in a flux you are in uh some kind of uh stress and strain or or under anointing of another kind then we ask a miss we don't even ask correctly so i pray that god would just move upon you and i today that we would be able to with confidence correctly come and ask for the right things in the right way and says that if you would seek you shall find and i say my brother and sister we know that no man has ever sought god but god has sought us and to knock and it shall be opened unto you and so we would see there that this and we'll carry this lord willing a little later in the service to to catch that about the knocking amen now we always understand we do understand uh that there are key factors that influence us and uh we approach god my brother and sister because of these influences as the scripture says to train up a child so we would have our children that they would be here in the midst uh this body of believers and and it is my brother and sister much of what we say and do uh how we approach this how's this uh very uh indelible impact upon our children and so it's oftentimes how we are taught is how uh we we are influenced by how we are taught and and you know if we uh approach this or are influenced by the teaching that god is unapproachable because in sister there is uh much teachings uh throughout the land and even some in our own midst that still are putting god at a distance to you and i and here again i want to just bring this up how we train up a child we the lord tarries we want our young children we want our young people to realize that god is right there accessible to them he is not a distant god he is not an uncaring god i knew a man many years ago uh had many struggles in his life and as it turns out he had been trained or taught as a young man that basically god was angry at humanity and once in our life and we'll feel like we come very short of of the word of god might feel like a complete failure and then the wheel falls off the car and we're sure that the wheel fell off the car because of what we did yesterday or last week and my brother and sister god doesn't operate that way and if god did make the wheel fall off your car he did it for your benefit not because he was angry the word of god shows that god clearly loves you as a husband loves his wife is how christ loves the church and my brother and sister no man the scripture says hateth his own flesh and so we are of the very dna of god and so it's there that the idea that satan would like to put out here in the world that we serve an indifferent god a a uncaring god an untouchable god an angry god is merely satan's way of constructing an atmosphere that influences you and how you approach god oh i'll tell you what my brother and sister when you catch that um god loves you so much that he was willing to give his life we all oh yes yes that's the scripture that's the scripture no that's a revelation that's a revelation when you finally understand just how much god loves you you might have been in sin and transgressions just you know the prophet of god yesterday just listening to him and he was talking about how that people would come and and they would be so far deep down in sin and they would be there and satan would do his very best to convince them that was their position but a loving god oh i love how he put that a loving god reach down into that and let you know that you always were his a loving god oh i thank you lord today to know that we serve a loving god amen not a god that is angry with us now we look at this and i just want to kind of lay a little foundation so hopefully you can catch the steps that we're taking this morning but in second timothy now he's actually kind of speaking to the preacher amen so it is there that i hope you can follow this he says preach the word right not preach a tradition not preach some kind of man-made doctrine but he says preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure now i want to try just a little bit to our last sunday service my brother and sister he who endures to the end see so there comes a time now when they will not endure sound doctrine so there's a shifting or a pulling back from sound doctrine now look we know that we have a position to take when we hear the word preached we either line up to the word or we bend the word to line up to us right there's really only two positions to take so we come to a place that we have to say whether it's ouch me oh my whatever it is that we will then line up with the word not asking for a compromise but willing to be moved and of course the word says that to those he loves he chastens so therefore sometimes the word is coming as a rebuke people don't like rebukes mostly it's pretty good that we would have the idea that we're all just going to go to heaven you know that's becoming a more and more prevalent teaching in the world today that this here life is just a little series of tests kind of like high school and in the end you're all going to graduate and get a diploma well they got that right but they didn't say where they were going after they got their diploma right so that's the watering down right everyone gets a diploma you finished this life you finished the race here's your diploma but sorry you didn't win not good all right not good for the time will come oh that reminds me though so something my daughter joe lynn shared with me god be with them today they flew to mexico yesterday morning to spend time with family uh so we want to remember them in prayer also but um you know joe lynn is working there in the high school or grades middle school whatever it is there in wilder and um a lot of students really like her she's firm but fair she's encouraging to them and they want her to be part of their graduation stuff and we were talking and she said well dad you must understand that it's not whether we can say we're christians or not right i i don't know i know there's others that have used the same phrase i it come upon me years ago and i've used it for many many years now uh but chino you know christian and name only we don't we don't want to be a christian in name only we want to be a christian amen because anyone can put any kind of name you know they will not endure sound doctrine but after now look at this oh this is my brother and sister i'm not going to defend the preacher every one of us will stand here brother chris myself here this morning brother david is gone but we'll stand before god and account for every single word we preach to you but you see sometimes people want to blame i'm not serving god today because of the preacher but that's not really what the jewel who will preach those things to them and so it is them searching for the preacher that will preach it in a way they can remain comfortable in their own life or as the term says they'll be comfortable in their own skin but that isn't what the gospel says right the gospel says we die to ourself that we change that we line up with the word of god not the word of god having to be shifted to line up with us and my brother and sister i'll just throw this out just so you'll you'll just do i don't mean to stir anybody up but around the message you know there's what they call the two soul doctrine and that is those people who are there saying well you know here we are sunday morning isn't it good to be in the house of god there's those missing from us uh you know but it's good to be here today and there's those that are here and my soul is hungry for the word of god and i want to make it to heaven but and when they go to work on monday then they might cheat a person here and do a little something here and lie a little bit there and so instead of letting the holy spirit change them somebody cooked up this whole idea that they're really two souls and there is that spiritual me and there is that carnal me and the carnal me can do these things that the spiritual me can't do but when i go to church the spiritual me is good in the eyes of god my brother and sister that's somebody searching out someone who will heap to themselves a teacher with itching ears they're there now i i don't want to change but the truth is is i like this man out here now the scripture says no man hateth his own flesh so let's be honest this morning saints there are certain things that we have to keep correcting in our life before god that seemingly come natural to us help us lord that's right brother chris help us lord because that thing that comes seemingly natural to us i always like to pick on the irish you know i've got a temper because my family's irish well my brother and sister you got uh i hope you follow me this morning nobody get confused you got a temper because you are believing to soul i'm just fine with god because i can fight a buzz all over here but when i go to church i never behave that way yeah no the thing is god wants you to be converted from that nature to this nature amen not to compromise well some people say i have balance in my life i've heard this before i have balance in my life on this side i'm very spiritual and on this side i'm very worldly and in the middle i have balance no i think the way it works no no no so we look at that see in the training my brother and sister now i want to just take a verse 4 here and touch on it and they shall turn away their ears from the truth so this is a point that there comes a time that that the people themselves have now found a preacher that preaches a form of the message they're comfortable with and so then they no longer well they'll say you know what we've we've been part of this for 40 years or 50 years my grandfather or whatever right on down you hear it even sometimes and i hope this don't bite anybody but we hear it sometimes while our family knew the prophet well that's good my brother and sister but if you have heap to yourself a teacher that is not preaching sound doctrine then it doesn't matter who your grandparents knew amen you'll find that when the truth comes they'll actually turn away from that truth because it doesn't fit what they think it doesn't fit the agenda and shall be turned into fables now i'll tell you what i preached this up in canada one time thought i was going to be a tartan feather before it was all over because my brother and sister the truth of it is i believe this message just to make sure anybody here or anywhere else will understand i believe this message just as much as any other human on the face of this earth but i tell you what i don't need a story from 50 years ago i need a real living god here in my midst this morning i don't need oh see this gets you in trouble i don't need a story about how brother branham this i like those stories i read those stories i listen to those stories and they encourage me to stand up but my brother and sister that story from 50 or 60 years ago will not be a substitute for the holy ghost today but people get into fables which are stories i don't want to belabor this but i want you you see because the story makes you feel good and i tell you there's things about these stories that happen that encourage me i'll can i take one moment just share one with you real quick brother bud southwick never knew him myself but i've known people that were bosom friends with him brother bud was what you would call a man's man in the sense that he was a man of the wilderness he was a man probably a lot of people around the message would say that man's too rough around the edges to be a believer because he was rough around the edges but this was a man that had the seed of god in him the germ of life was in him and he is there hunting with the prophet now don't you know that god knows what he's doing and here is brother bud he is believing this prophet he's believing this message he has seen the example he has felt the presence of almighty god before he ever gave his heart completely to the lord he knew this was something different than he had ever seen in his life and one night he's there they're sitting in the tent and he says well uh uh uh brother bill i i'm gonna go out and check the horses one last time and go outside check which way the breeze is blowing get off to the far end of the string where the horses are pull out a cigarette and lights a cigarette and the smoke is drifting away from the tent and he's out there in the dark puffing on a cigarette and he hears brother branham's voice hey bud when did you quit smoking he had a decision why i don't smoke no he had an anointing my brother and sister because he wasn't turning his ears to a preacher that told him you can have the holy ghost and smoke those evil things he was in the presence of someone who believed in the truth an anointing come upon him and he took as it were the shame upon himself and he says just now brother bill just now brother branham didn't say well you know what's good you this you're killing yourself you're this you're that it was just praise the lord you know what that encouraged me because there's been times oh i hope this applies to you not just me there's been times i've sat in church and the preacher has preached and they come anointing upon me and said paul when are you going to quit this and abel in my heart because i have this recollection of this story to be able to say just now lord just now i'm not going to give an excuse i'm not going to try and hide this i'm not going to try and coat it with butter or sugar i'm going to accept this it's god speaking that's what brother bud southwick said it wasn't brother branham speaking to me it was almighty god calling to me this is the moment but you see if we just feel good to tell the stories something's missing if we never change if brother bud had went on his next guide trip into the wilderness of british columbia and took a carton of cigarettes with him my brother and sister it would just be a story but we're talking about a real life god come down in the midst of that man's life changed him forever yeah but we got too many people that are willing to settle for stories i was brother branham here i was with brother branham there he told me this he told me that i could name names and i could put this out but it would not be good but my brother and sister there's people today that i'm personally acquainted with that are holding on to certain things in their life and according to the word of god the message of the hour those things are not right but when brother branham you fill in the blame everything will be all right no i'm sorry my brother and sister we have a message we have a word we have an answer amen the prophet don't need to come back right we've got it he gave us all that was necessary right did he not tell us that we have everything we need for a rapture is already inside of us we don't need someone to come back we need god we need the holy ghost hallelujah now i want to just carry this on a little bit if i could here you see my brother and sister we'll turn to titus once again speaking to the preachers because they're not exempt holding fast the faithful word has been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine to both exhort and to convince the gangsters so we're finding i'm laying this little foundation down to you that it is important that we do not get tired we do not get weary we do not get discouraged we do not get deceived and move away from sound doctrine god requires it through the word to his ministry and he will require it to you and i in titus 2 and 1 coming on just an extension of this thought into the next chapter but speak about the things which become sound doctrine so we see how important this is that that the foundation is built upon sound doctrine my brother and sister sound doctrine is the bible foundation of doctrine it is not another interpretation now i change those words around a little bit but you'll find that the prophet of god actually spoke that if it's necessary for people to to have that endorsement on that the prophet of god said everything has to be built upon the foundation of the bible now i want to move into just a little deeper and hopefully hopefully it makes sense this morning are we doing okay amen unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans right these saying saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god now we see my brother and sister as he is now starting to speak he spoke through these other six church ages and gave them a word for their day a word that was completely as we look back through history absolutely accurate of the needs and the times and the days that it was done and now he's speaking to the angel of the church of the laodiceans and he's telling them so these words that then follow and i kind of clip this out for the sake of time would know this scripture if we don't we should amen but in verse 20 says behold i stand at the door and knock so that means in the age that we're living christ is at the door knocking right no way to deny it no way to get around it we're not looking for another day in fact brother branham has words concerning that but i stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me now i want to just uh focus for just a minute on on that right there we see my brother and sister how that it comes a time and it comes a place that we need to maybe put it into a type and and uh it is there you know it's pretty funny i've actually had this happen to me uh before you know and uh you you go to a door and you knock and you hear scurrying and you hear a chair sliding and you hear a clink of a glass but no one comes to the door you're not a bill collector you're a brother or you fought you see a decision was made the knock my brother and sister did not go silent the knock you heard on the outside is a knock that is heard on the inside are you with me amen so someone had to make a decision whether to respond to the knock and i can assure you that uh in case you guys ever decide to do this don't bother pulling the curtain back that's right beside the door they will see you but people will then peek out and they're like oh i don't want to talk to this person and they want to act like and ultimately word it in such a fashion when they see you at church in the coming week to to go oh you stopped by my house yeah yeah you had your blue frame glasses on you were in the window left of your deal i heard you set down your coffee cup and you tripped over the chair but you looked at the screen and some of you might say that you might have done that to me brother paul i might have i look at that not now i have a little button on the side of an iphone that you can push and the phone goes right on ringing but is now silent can someone say amen would someone be brave enough to say i've been there and i've done that hallelujah those that didn't lift your hand you must not have a telephone we could put that also into the type of the doorbell now we live in a day and age when they have these things called ring and whatever other names they have and now you don't even have to go to the curtain because the curtains right there on your phone and i can assure you your car is in the driveway your dog's barking your kids are in the backyard they know you're there but you look at your phone and it's like it's them we'll just act like we're not here well you be careful because somebody might call child protective services if you've left your dog alone in the house and your children alone in the backyard better off to have the courage to open the door and say god bless you brother god bless you sister i just don't want to deal with you at least they know where they stand you say brother paul you're being funny but my brother and sister this is exactly what it is when the holy spirit comes down in our midst and starts knocking in our life and we choose to ignore the knock because we think we can act like we didn't hear we didn't know it didn't happen to us come on saints let's not let's not think we can just ignore this knock but let me just go on couple thoughts that just came on my mind there i think sometimes we shouldn't speak everything that we think can someone say amen to that but look the rapture is knocking can someone say amen to that the rapture is knocking there is a people that the holy spirit has come down into the age and he says you know what behold i stand i didn't it isn't me it isn't the preacher it isn't paul the pastor or this person or that person it's god himself says behold i stand at the door and knock and if any man would hear my voice and we know the word of god says that he closes the eyes and the ears of those of the unbeliever and he opens the eyes and the ears of the believer so it's still there now on our court that god is speaking to you and i this is not some random person out here this is not the person that will never move of the spirit of god and receive it this is you and i the people that we call believers the people we say we're filled with the holy ghost and god is knocking you say but isn't this just about salvation no this might be about some unbecoming thing in your life and god's knocking it's time to deal with that it's time to let that complex go it's time to respond to my word it's time to move forward time to grow and i don't want to grow you know i i'm probably i'm trying not to be so transparent saints not that i've got something to hide from but you know sometimes i realize i'm probably not beneficial but you know sometimes the other day i told jerry i'm not dealing with this deal i'm not doing this i'm not doing this she gets this smirk on her face i hope she don't mind sharing this i've thrown her under the bus so many times she should be used to it by now and she gets a smirk on her face and she goes off and usually when my wife has a smirk on her face it's better to deal with it sooner than later because the smirk grows into something bigger and i was like what are you what is your deal and she says well you just don't want to be an adult today and you know i was so anointed by that spirit i was like you're right i am not going to be an adult today it didn't work the word of god shows us the prophet reiterates it you won't hear his voice unless it's been made known to you some people can't respond to that saints we've been given the word the anointing of the hour the revelation for our age and if god is speaking don't ignore the voice god's doing that for you and for i he's coming he's speaking for our benefit he's not here to tongue-lash us he's not here to beat us to brutalize us to lash us you know to oppose to leave us there my brother and sister he's doing this for our benefit and if any man would hear my voice can someone say lord let me hear your voice today and open the door see it takes an action beyond just hearing the voice we've got to open the door oh god let me be quick let my feet be fleet as it says in the book of psalms let my feet go quickly to thy presence and open the door and say lord i've been dealing with this and i've been pushing it now i know none of you do this but sister jerry and i just moved here recently and we've we it was almost like a treasure hunt and ignored for so long tried to bury it for so long come on saints i know i'm preaching to you because you're human some of you didn't even say amen wow so what is this i will sup with him he with me i tell you what there's nothing nicer than feeding on the word of god with the lord with the holy spirit present come and dine amen so as it looked my brother and sister we'll find now as this is it's showing here even as i overcame and sat down with my father and his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and the spirit is speaking today we have a word a sure word of prophecy for our day and if you are hiding in a hole you will not know this but there is literally dozens of scriptural prophecy and prophetic prophecy has come to pass in the last year well you say but they're they're not this and how can you be certain well my brother and sister no i'm not i don't know kamala harris might be that woman the prophet of god was talking about she wouldn't be in my book but anyway you know so you look at that but it might be according to god's word that she would be that one very much looks like we have a president who is out absolutely uh cognitively dysfunctional and and it's there that he appears that he's just being coached and led along some people use the word puppet we should show a respect it's hard but we should and we can look at all these signs and whether that's the exact sign or not we have people are like well until i have proof that's a sign i'm not going to do it well i'll tell you what the prophet of god said it the scripture says it it is going to come to pass whether that is the individual that fulfills it or not it's coming and so if that is coming and the word of god can't fail then when the word said there would be sons and daughters of god when it got so dark that people didn't think there was any way possible he said i will be the light that shines from the darkness i will be the light that shines out of zion into your pathway it's coming saints you just need to stand on the word and believe it and if whether you think that is the exact sign of the time that's fine but i tell you it is coming it is coming to a day that they will try to silence your voice it is coming look what's happening in canada up there in edmonton it's happening to a bunch of churches there in that area that they put they put chain link fences around the whole church so no one could even come close and then told the church you'll pay the bill for this they come to another church maybe that church has different ideas they've come to that church escorted everybody out locked it up they had church on the lawn and now a judge is telling you keep this up we'll take it all away from you and make it ours you don't think it can happen we live in conservative old idaho might be one of the last places that happens but the word of god says prophet said there'll come a time they'll turn your church into a sore house but he also said the bride would be gone come on amen hallelujah eat the hat and ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches now look we move on right here into the fourth chapter and john now is speaking after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven but if god's not dealing with you personally not talking to you personally if all you're getting out of this is coming through another channel through a person i ask you to get down and pray and get serious we're in a season right now that god is talking to sons and daughters of god the prophet of god said lip to ear this is a season my brother and sister not to expect it to come from somewhere else but it comes from almighty god directly to you brother and sister if you don't care enough to get in a position for god to speak lip to ear to you then you've got more troubles in your life than you ever thought see we look at this and we we catch this revelation as it were now first thessalonians some people would say is there really a rapture uh you know in my studies looking around you've got these whole crowds and they're like well you know we think the rapture is a figurative thing well that's good i figure i'm in it so that's figurative enough for me amen first thessalonians the fourth chapter verse 14 says for if we believe that jesus died and rose again right first first point on the checklist we have to be able to check off even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord so he either was light or this is god speaking that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall go through the tribulation and be tortured and driven and be beaten and oh i was in the wrong deal wasn't i that we which are alive oh i hope you catch these saints and endure unto the coming of the lord we've got to still be remaining we're going to still be here serving him it can't be that we say you know 15 years ago or at this stage of my life i was on fire for the lord praise the lord god owes me to to do something no my brother and sister we've got to be still enduring amen i hope you don't mind me taking that little bit of liberty with this but you've got to be alive and remaining in the service of the lord until the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and no this isn't donald trump i'm serious there's all kinds of these churches out here oh there it is there it is there it is there it is the prophet of god i've heard message people the prophet of god said there would be like a superman come in the last days well you know what they have some poster thing of donald trump standing here ripping his suit open and it's superman poster behind it i tell you what there ought to be some of those people that believe that he's the superman uh they they might just very well just ought to buy that poster and hang it up but i'm sorry my brother and sister the superman that they're gonna be is is going to be a pope that comes with a solution to hunger and poverty and violence and wars and pestilences there's a superman because i can tell you even as rich as donald trump is you don't have enough money to even be a drop in the bucket but the one who controls the wealth of the world look it up see what the prophet talks about one who controls the wealth of the world will have that kind of influence in fact already right all them big businesses met with the pope how can we change the world we pledge billions you imagine how the pope probably thought that was actually kind of funny in the deep rooted side because he would have said i already own you you're pledging something i already own you now i don't mean to preach my opinions but i just see all these little things saints it's things the prophet of god said a little isolated thing here you say well brother paul you're putting them together well you know what maybe i am but i believe these things are words that were spoken and you take and you can put a direct line between them and this event direct line between this and it's not a doctrine we're not creating a doctrine what we're doing is taking the timeline by which god revealed it to a prophet that he saw certain things take place and then you can see that those certain things don't have to be all tied together they don't have to have a string connected to them but he says right here all the way back in the 50s saints he speaks things that are so perfectly in tune with what is taking place right now that you cannot deny it but those which are alive and remain endure shall be caught together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with him wherefore comfort one another with these words if that doesn't mean there's going to be a body change if that doesn't declare that there's going to be a calling out a raising up my brother and sister i don't know what scripture that you need or how much you need to influence that now look right here in the message the rapture um i guess you can probably tell what i've been thinking but to the church the bride see clearly identifies that right we're not talking church like up the road or down the road amen although i keep telling sister jerry that church that's just beyond the mega church down here a few blocks only has about 10 cars there on sunday and i've i don't know i might be covered in but i'm thinking you know what they don't they can't utilize that but we could it's got grass and it's got a bigger parking lot i don't know we might might slip down there in the middle of the night and just go lay hands on their building to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her now my brother and sister this is not us going back into thessalonians and saying oh here it is sure enough there it is in the scripture this is now the word applied this is the word manifested and now the rapture is becoming a revelation to you and i and what is revelation something revealed i see myself i hope i don't sound presumptuous put yourself in this i see myself in the rapture i see myself fulfilling all of these parts that are necessary every ingredient has been put in and it's now coming together and i see myself in the rapture i recognize that people would contest that how dare them say they are the rapture or the raptures taking place in the rapture is an event well i'm telling you the event is now it is not some day in the future the body change is taking place right now because i can tell you i may not be what i ought to be but i can thank god today i am not what i used to be because there is a body change taking place and i've got a mind in this body and i've got a heart in this body and i've got a soul in this body and it's all coming together and it's changing oh people are just like i've been 40 years you still got a temper you still don't come to church you still got a super super super big screen in your house and you watch whatever they throw in that filthy thing and try to justify it you've got books and magazines and you're busy busy busy with everything but god and you say well i believe the message my family's been in for 50 years my brother and sister that is here and the wheat is being thrashed and everything else is being bound together and burnt am i preaching too hard okay i'm just getting excited the other day sister jerry's like you realize you're yelling at me no i didn't realize that i'm sorry but you look at this my brother and sister you see that the revelation the true bride of christ will be waiting she's not going to sit there and go well someday it'll show up if god wants me to have a revelation of the rapture then god will give it to me what's happening my brother and sister they're waiting for that revelation because they know it's coming they know that god is going to speak to them did you know that my brother enoch oh yes i can i can trace my bloodlines right back i'm enoch's brother and my brother had a revelation of a rapture that it wasn't hey one of these days praise the lord i get out of my house payment i get out of my car payment i get out of this payment and that payment i get out of this stuff i get out of this ugly old world no my brother and sister that was not the revelation of the rapture that epoch had enoch had a rabbit revelation of the rapture and every day he got up and said oh god oh god let me please you today let me live a life today lord that would be worthy of your gospel lord i want to please you he wasn't counting the days down oh another day gone i'll be out of here another day gone what was he he was concerned about the here and now he was concerned about lord let my life today in this moment lord let my life be pleasing you see what satan's doing to us he's getting us so caught up in this this this this and this we forget our sole purpose is to please god i preached about enoch a few times i tell you i was preaching about enoch south africa and it had to be the hand of the lord because i was walking down an aisle in the church i didn't know anybody from anybody and i stopped right at the end of a pew of a brother it turns out it had a mental breakdown and any kind of pressure threw him in such a deal that he just couldn't even function and god in his grace and mercy saints had nothing to do with this man right here i was so oblivious in fact when the man leaped out of his chair and started screaming and shouting and jumping around it scared the fire out of me because i had stopped right here at the end and he is sitting right here you say bro paul that's just so simple just please god is it simple saints i want to ask you be honest with yourself today is it simple to get up every single day and live a life it's pleasing to god come on i don't know if you got any feedback but i'll tell you what it's a fight in my house well wait i don't i don't want to brush sister jerry without it there's a fight in my house because i have a mouth and i have body english my body english speaks louder than my mouth does yes but back to the brother in south africa do you know right there saints a revelation touch this brother i can live it i can live it i can be pleasing to god i am not a man who is mentally crippled and emotionally crippled and i guess he shared later he made a commitment right there as he was leaping to his feet i am free not only did the lord give him back to his rightful position oh here you know let me just go ahead and finish the story it does have some very good content you see the prophet of god said often times the wife rises up and becomes dominating in her spirit taking that headship role because she's just a mean rotten woman is that what he said what did he say because the husband won't and the wife had to go out of the house and get a job and the wages were not sufficient enough so she had to devote herself to learn to type and to do this and to do that and she rose up and got more and more responsibility more and more responsibility more and more pressure and then she's coming home to a husband who has emotionally mentally just crippled because of this mental breakdown and she become quite domineering because she would come in the home and it was like you do this you do this you do this everybody sunday morning get dressed we're going to church you get more and then her family started fracturing i can speak this because the son is now serving god but their son had a very beautiful voice decided he was elvis reincarnated and he sounded like him but he got banished from the church because he was then teaching hey sister gabrielle you want to learn to sing like elvis sister donna sisters you want to learn to speak come brothers we can all sing and we can we can also do that other stuff like elvis they're like you're out of here so he's not in church now he's gonna find someone else to hang out with and they thought it was great and i had one daughter that was in such turmoil i won't go into all the details but she tattooed herself and it was a tattoo that reflected her emotion of how she did that and she tattooed the words hate into her forearm but there come a time because it's a revelation of faith there come a time that god said i've put up with enough and it's time it's a season for my people a jubilee and god come right down and started with one daughter and delivered her by the grace of god and then that come and another daughter they had a daughter that was just sold out to the lord just serving the lord and we got to see right there in a little short time my brother sister not brother paul not sister jerry god on the seat god doing a work and we saw a little girl delivered and then we saw a mother suddenly realize god is on the scene i thought i'd lost another child we got to see on a sunday morning god stop at the end of a pew oh yes i'll be bold enough to tell you god stopped at the end of his pew and god said now is the season my son stand up and claim your deliverance and the power of god moved and now a few years down the road we have a son married to a catholic girl while living he was living with a catholic girl and it was there that god had allowed a word to be spoken your son will serve me and then the day comes that he and his girlfriend walk into church go to an altar give their heart to the lord my brother and sister don't tell me god's not on the scene don't tell me that god is blind to what is happening in our world don't tell me my brother and sister that these things are not happening don't tell me hallelujah that the rapture is not knocking on the hearts of sons and daughters of god don't tell me i've seen it i've seen it what's happening is we've created an atmosphere where we justify why we feel like we feel and that it's not important or i will deal with it tomorrow no he is knocking respond respond hallelujah oh you can't have revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that's been revealed to you like it was abraham now i want to ask you saints anybody got any faith then you have experienced revelation god is on the scene revealing himself because there's no such thing as a man's faith it's only god's faith and faith is a gift from god to you and i hallelujah faith is something that's been revealed to you like it was to abraham that could call anything contrary to what have been revealed to him as though it wasn't so you know what the world calls that cognitive dissonance you're denying the reality you have a disease you have marriage problems you have this over here and you have that over there you have cognitive dissonance because you're denying that yes i do praise the lord i will call those things that are as though they are not and i will call those things that are not as though they are my children are saved i am healed in the name of jesus christ i've got overcoming power the holy ghost but you say brother paul it don't seem to fit no that's right it don't seem to fit in the flesh but i stepped out of the flesh i stepped over into another realm and that realm is called faith amen hallelujah forgive me for getting excited this morning call anything contrary did you hear me anything don't go down a list exempting certain things that you feel like just can't be done well i've had this certain little thing brother paul for so long good today's as good a day as any just like that little brother in south africa he had had a mental make breakdown for like four years four years you know what four years can feel like sometimes a whole lifetime what happened god come not and the season was right and he responded right and god gave him his mind back gave him his emotions back gave him that determination where he literally admitted i guess later that the reason he went to church he wasn't sure he was even a believer in where he went to church because his wife basically got him out of bed every sunday morning and said you're going to church sounds like some of us they'll expect me there well you've heard this story about the man that was laying in bed sunday morning he's got the covers pulled up over his head and his wife's coming in there honey it's getting later and later and later i ain't going to church come on honey go to church i ain't going to church finally he says well just give me a good reason why i should go to church and she said because you're the pastor now faith that's what faith is is the revelation of god let's not attribute it to anything else i know this sounds anti-message but people sometimes i think get confused what the message is my brother and sister this is not a revelation of the message are you with me this is a revelation of jesus christ we have put the title the message to it [Music] in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god we've put the title message but some people say if you don't say this the revelation of the message you're wrong well that's good if the message is the bible i'm all for it but if the message is a title we have given it are you with me and you just go study it saints i i would press upon you go study what it is the whole foundation of what it was that created traditions in the church i'm preaching all your happiness away here now faith that's what faith is it's a revelation of god the church is built upon a revelation the whole entire body amen now can i have just a few more minutes so we look here let me find myself in my notes here in proverbs 23 7. now what i preached on this last wednesday my brother and sister i stopped just right above this so i want you to see how this drives in and i thank the lord for that because you see what is our our expectation what is our our deal we see the signs saints look we see the signs do we not see the signs we see the signs the hour has come the prophet of god even himself i believe i have it in the quote here if we can get to that then we see the signs it's here the hour is come the bride amen with this revelation come on not another revelation with this revelation will produce the results come on this isn't like we hope we can make it if you are if you're vocalizing i hope i can make it to the end i hope i can finish the race i hope i can go in the rapture i hope that something's wrong don't let the devil twist you up don't think that you've got to do i want you to just shift your thinking a little bit my brother and sister we have the word of the hour amen we've got the holy ghost and the holy ghost in the word of the hour is to produce a certain result and we are producing it can i say that a little louder we are producing it you say brother paul we have troubles amen there's still a thing called the devil but it's whether you are going to produce the result or not well i feel like i'm almost backslid that's good the devil would make you confirm your backslid if you listen to him but you keep standing on the word and still receive from god and you will fight the greatest battle ever fought and you will come out shouting the victory it won't be just i feel like i might make it to in the rapture i might make it to heaven my brother and sister the word of god showed us right here that the bride with this revelation will produce the result because the word of god said the hour was coming again when the word would be in flesh again hallelujah so look it's oh how oh my well look at this i gotta i gotta just ask it to you this way what is your anticipated result well i i personally don't know anybody that's ever had an experience with god that says well i i'm just imagining brother paul that i'll i'll probably go about 40 years in the message and then i'll get discouraged and then i was raised lutheran imagine probably after about 40 years in the message i'll just become a lutheran again well if that's your anticipated results what's keeping you go become a lutheran right now well i'll probably just backslid and go off in depression and be on some kind of medication the rest of my life because it just didn't work out like a plan no no that's your expectation or anticipation right now something seriously is wrong amen there's there's there's a clarkson going off there's lights flashing there's something wrong saints what is i want you to stop think about what's your anticipated result come on i knew a man that made this declaration and he hid it so right on the head almost to the day he said well you know i'm going to marry this girl but i imagine we'll probably only be married about half a dozen years get divorced we'll have a couple kids by then and we'll just fight and fuss over that spend thousands of dollars on a lawyer half a dozen years goes by young man gets divorced they fight over the kids they spend tens of thousands of dollars and i thought hmm yeah i wonder if you ever put that together i tried to hint at him you know did you realize you kind of prophesied that what's prophecy i don't know what you're talking about well i'll tell you what it is it is your anticipated result low expectation low result high expectation yes high results and when i'm standing before the throne i'm going to be really thrilled to look out and see every one of you there i'm going to shout to the heavens the grace of almighty god that when i get to heaven i'll see you there when we all try to get to heaven oh what a glorious day that could possibly be when we all hopefully see jesus we'll maybe sing and shout the victory there's a reason that isn't the real words of that saints there's a reason the songwriter was not anointed to put maybes and ifs and butts hallelujah amen i want to ask you this sounds a little psychology wise what is the result of your absolute reality your an absolute reality is the one that has no additional additions no additional subtractions it is the finished reality you know what that means that means when you catch the revelation of who you are the prophet of god said when the bride the church you recognize who you are you will be an invincible army what is that that's your absolute reality i'm going to be invincible hallelujah right after i just get you know over this tizzy and that tizzy and i get over no no look saints look saints i know this is a little hard for some people to grasp it's time for us to deal in the realm of the absolute yes right go listen to this message brother brown preach the absolute amen there's no i got this and but i got this also it's absolute now the word's producing a rapture right it's not not what the scripture says the words producing a rapture a body change i hope this don't sound like you think i fell off the ledge did you know that you your body is the vessel of the rapture if god had chose to bring the rapture in any other form god didn't need you god didn't need me i just listened to the prophet yesterday said god don't need us we need him you realize god chose this vessel to be the body the body the vessel of the rapture why didn't he why didn't he take the trees they're innocent why didn't he take something else god said no i choose you i choose you you are the body of the manifestation of the change that the word of god promised would come to pass did that make sense to you i don't want anybody walking away saying brother paul's got some new weird doctrine well i'll tell you what it's the absolute the truth amen amen what is a vessel it's a container we contain the rapture in us you didn't feel like that yesterday afternoon did you you didn't feel like you were the rapture well good i don't care how many days you don't feel like you're the rapture you catch a revelation that you are the rapture and you'll quit looking at this vessel of flesh and you will start looking at the vessel of the spiritual man you will start recognizing god said it god will fulfill it and i believe that and i will act upon that because well praise the lord i'll keep my mouth zipped here yeah god could use anything he wanted but he chose you isn't that amazing so the word jesus christ himself using your body to house the rapture is that not incredible do you know that this has been years ago kind of an old story maybe you can find the research of it but did you know the united states government somewhere back east there stored literally hundreds of millions of dollars of gold in a just plain old ramshackle warehouse no big thick steel bars no big thick concrete ceilings and walls no foundation that went 20 or 30 feet of solid concrete to keep them out they literally just packaged it up like it was nothing used forklifts to unload trucks and took it into a warehouse set it down but you see the reason nobody stole it is because nobody knew it was there they weren't looking for gold in a warehouse and this world is not looking for the holy ghost in you just this old warehouse that god said i'm going to fill myself up i'm going to store myself in you and i'm not going to make you oh can you imagine brother tim wouldn't we look good in them big robes and of course you know in the old you know arabian method of family whatever our wives and our daughters would be trailing behind kind of like a bride in a wedding and we would be walking along with our big robes i am the word of god made flesh no sir he hid it in you the very place the world wouldn't look amen hallelujah thank you lord some of you better start voicing that amen you better say thank you because the lord might think you're not appreciating that look okay we know the word says the body change has already taken place right one we know it's a catching away from this world now here is a i think interesting thought the scripture clearly shows us what sends us to hell right can you pick your bible up and figure out what sends you to hell it's very clear amen yet the flesh still finds these things attractive come on don't lie down don't lie don't lie to me please please don't lie to me this morning the flesh still finds these things attractive come on it's maybe time we face a little rubber on the road brothers it's still a challenge isn't it there's a pretty woman the prophet of god said i hang that cross everybody's got this idea oh we're just no no no the prophet of god do you realize get the depth of the story the prophet of god spoke right there on tape to the world and says the reason i have this cro this cross on my mirror is when i look over here and i see this girl of this purdy this perfect stature i can turn my eyes and look to the cross what was he doing he was telling us i'm not exempt a prophet of god not exempt no we've had angry prophets through the scriptures we've had all kinds of prophets discourage prophets prophets that clinically psychologists now religious ones are looking at going we believe a lot must might have suffered from depression you think so huh well i know one thing he suffered from the presence of god in his life if you want to call that suffering and the old flesh just can't do that people are like oh go on youtube see how many people i i was in my room last night and god come down and stood in my midst and he gave me these ten points that i'm to share with the world and so i'm here to tell you this this this and this and this well let's just start with it and take it back to the scripture okay no no no no no no though an angel of light should come well if his angel light had to be god right no no no okay for as he thinketh in his heart so is he i want to get back and move on here what is your expectation saints please look at me focus what do you think about yourself today so as you think of yourself in your heart if you see yourself as bitter and defeated and unable and and just on down that negative line that's what you are this is not psychology saints this is scripture i will see you in the rapture see you in the rapture oh i can't sing this tractor version too you guys will go man he butchered that but i'm telling you that's where i see myself that's who i am i'm in the rapture i am the rapture i am the word in a vessel called into the presence of almighty god hallelujah oh let me just let's go on see we also see the word shows us clearly what will save our souls right and the flesh finds that hard to do would someone agree with me the things that send us to hell seem to come so naturally things that would save our souls is a bitter fight come on get that picture but how do you see yourself i made mistakes yesterday right scripture lays out all these things there as it were a transgression of the word of god and i can stand before you today and say pride of life a little token of bitterness here a little anger oh no we don't talk like that you're a preacher in the message you can't talk like that yes i can i can tell you that i get to face those things and i get a struggle with those things but i get to come at the end of my day and stop and look in the word of god and say thank you lord for the blood thank you lord for the revelation of who i am in jesus christ thank you lord and i can rise up from that with the confidence that i shall not be defeated i shall not give in to the enemy i shall not do why because the rapture has now been expressed in me and i no longer see myself in the flesh but i see myself in the spirit the word says that you have to get into even know he's the christ you have to be filled with the holy ghost prophet of god said i'm keeping you a little long aren't i it's not mother's day it's not father's day it's just memorial day and so we're just going to remember why we're here amen now i'll leave some of those thoughts out praise the lord now john 1 and 12 said but as many as receive him to them gave him power to become sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god are you familiar with the lafontaine song you're looking more like your father every day hallelujah i am it's just amazing i don't want to sound egotistical i don't want to sound lifted up in your sight but i get up in the morning and i go look in the mirror and i'm thinking yeah i'm looking more like my father every day no i'm not talking about my earthly father i'm not ashamed of him but i'm looking more like my heavenly father of who i really am hallelujah every day i'm looking because you see when you catch the revelations brother paul you're making revelation out of a lovely stuff i am because we struggle with it and it has to be a revelation for you to live and use that victoriously amen so as many as received him he gave them the power to become sons and daughters of god now look my brother and sister you can't be a son of god and a son of perdition at the same time it's impossibility we don't have two fathers we don't have a two soul doctrine around here i'm of my father amen the lord jesus christ that's what i'm of which were born see not back to the flesh not the will of the flesh we would say well we're married we want to have one child two child three child four child a van i mean anyway i'm sorry see it's not the will of the flesh not the will of man our children that are here because god desired them to be amen that's simple body change is knocking one more shot here are we okay go through this one last quote in the days of the pentecostals restoring back of the gifts the restoration of the guests speaking tongues casting out devils and the gifts why it testified there was no joke about it people said when it first raised up i read the books in the history of pentecost they said it can't last it'll burn down it's still burning why is this because you'll never put it out god said it would be there it's that portion of the word and no more could you put that out then when the bride is being called out how you going to put it out you see this word my brother and sister that's calling you and i nothing's going to stop that i don't care how many people i'm just going to be blunt with you i don't care how many people quit i don't care how close they were to you that quit you cannot put the fire out to this bride of christ amen the rapture is a revelation to her it's not i read it in a book i read it in scripture but it's becoming something that is playing out of your life and just like enoch you get up in the morning and you say lord i'm gonna do my very best to please you and you realize god looks at this now look my brother and sister when when we look oh my i'll just be taking more time i have i just have to i'm sorry i had the privilege sister jerry and i to sit in brother willie and sister betty retief's home eat home-cooked food they apologize sorry this isn't very good i didn't care sitting here with a man that has such an incredible testimony a sister with such an incredible testimony of the labors that they've done of what they they gave through those years through the 50s 60s and coming right on up now they both passed to their reward and you look at that and and we got to sit there in their house and and i i don't know how to tell you i'm not a respecter of persons but i i do have a respect for these men that can just share with you yes brother paul i used to take everything but uh virtually the equivalent of ten dollars every drop of money we had but ten dollars i left that for sister betty and i would get books and i would get bibles and i would get this and i would go and i would go up through these countries and up through these places and i would sleep in my car and he had a sense of humor too he says you know i would sleep in my car because you see they'd say oh here this bed is for you and you'd look in there and there'd be four dogs and a baby camel and this and that and whatever sleeping in the bed they'd be like no the back seat the car don't look bad at all and sister betty sharing her testimony i'm glad i got to hear this in person and she's there and she says you know brother paul it was this time it was this place and brother branham was coming and we were going to have this interview with him and i went down to the to the hair salon deal and got my hair trimmed and permed and all this stuff and i got a dress and i wanted to just be as presentable as i could and we were going to be with brother branham right after this meeting and the service and and and so i'm there and as he's preaching i just was sinking and sinking she said in my heart because you realize i just went before the prophet of god come and we're going to meet him and the very thing i shouldn't have known i went and had my hair all done up and trimmed and and that's against the word of god and she's heart broke and they're there with brother branham she shares that with him i want this to encourage you and she tells brother branham i i did this brother brown i'm so sorry and he said it's all right sister betty in the service when those words and he repeated the words when they were spoken in your heart you said oh lord forgive me and in god's eyes right now sister betty you have long beautiful hair not a ritual no i go to this and i go to that but he said in your heart when you said and he tells her what she said in her heart she never doubted she said i was a little embarrassed when i was around other people that believed the message of the hour that my hair was there but it just kept growing and it kept growing and it kept growing and and but she just knew she said i have confidence a prophet of god told me god saw my heart isn't that beautiful thank you lord sister emmy would you come amen how are they going to put that out when the bride is being called out how are you going to put it out it's the revelation of the manifestation of the word made true and we're living in that day praise be to god the revelation of the mystery of himself and it's more real today saints than it was when the prophet of god preached this in 1965 it's more real today of the revelation oh hallelujah a revelation of the mystery of himself now the rapture is only this rapture we're talking about is only for the bride you talk about having a revelation when you by revelation can stand and say you know what i'm in the rapture what you're actually making a revelation i know who i am as the bride of jesus christ i'm not a hope so i'm not a maybe soul i might be i am i am remember the bible said in the rest of the dead live not for a thousand years this great rapture now listen to this carefully we're closing if there's not a rapture friends where are we at what are we going to do what age are we living in what promise do we have there oh could i just put that in bold letters there is going to be a rapture the bible says there will be and it'll only be for the elected the elected lady the bride in this day that's pulled out the church the very word church means called out of and moses called the nation out of a nation the holy spirit is calling a bride out of a church a church out of a church members from every denomination making up a bride bride tree it's in the tape the bride tree bride coming out call that's the one thing the bride tree is the bride rather is the one that's going to be in the rapture that alone nothing but the bride the elected ones foreknown by god from the beginning the father's spiritual genes oh hallelujah hallelujah when the word says that you were always in him that's because it was his spiritual genes that brought you to this all saints look look at this rapture i've seen people get up excited and upset because it would be spoken such terms but i'm just going to make one closing parting shot with the canon if you don't believe you're the rapture then the prophet of god has just showed you you're not the bride because if you're the bride you are the rapture so therefore they can't be a rapture without you the bride so if you claim to be bride but don't believe you are the rapture we've got a misunderstanding somewhere and that might well go back to the teaching let's just say what the prophet said can we do that saints can we just stand on what the prophet said hallelujah i was known by god from the beginning because i'm his child i'm his word manifested i like what was spoken here recently the seventh seal is not a doctrine it is the word and the word is the bride and the bride is the word so therefore the mystery of redemption which was hidden throughout all the books revealed in the seventh seal i am redemption also you see redemptions all through me it's redeemed every molecule of me imagine a person would stand in front of you and say well praise the lord i i'm redeemed i'm saved i've got the holy ghost except for my hands or my feet or my eyes or my ears or my mind or my heart no sir if we're redeemed we're redeemed just the same as if we're lost we're lost but i'm telling you this word has come i've got the holy ghost you've got the holy ghost confess it stand on it amen i wish somebody would just maybe electronically be able to shut off hallelujah we'll just call that good amen no ye not amen brother jason hallelujah always marveled by it is very few preachers can sing hallelujah no ye not no ye not ye are a temple [Music] [Music] no oh yes i know yes i know i am a temple i've got a revelation oh yes i know yes i know i am oh yes i know yes i know i glory i'm full of praise full of power full of glory for a praise for the powerful of glory [Music] oh yes i know yes i know i am a temple oh yes i know yes i know i am a temple i am a temple hallelujah well you know i don't really shouldn't spill the beans here but if you guys just want to maybe do a little study in your own self listening the prophet reading some words we're going to just move on into just a little study amen of where the mercy seats at not too long ago i encountered an individual he says so paul you believe if god these are words saints you believe god's right here in your church in your midst i said yes i do he said you mean figurative like the holy ghost i said well the prophet of god says it's all god come on look it up it's quotes it's not some portion of you got the holy ghost you've got god and he said i can't believe that because if god's here with you in that form he's off the mercy seat caught me so off guard i thought what what no no i'm sorry prophet of god didn't word this in various forms a few hundred times to come along and say oh sorry i got the got off the mercy seat so if you get an opportunity just study it now the mercy seat we'll preach and i want to just make sure the church here that we have clarity on the mercy seat amen i could just put it in one paragraph to be done but that would be no fun hallelujah we'll look through the word of god we'll study this out and realize my brother and sister how awesome our god is how he has covered every point every avenue satan doesn't even have you know if you ever played football or whatever you know satan doesn't even have a way to to do an end run to get around the word it's covered oh thank you lord well hallelujah if that same spirit that raised christ from the [Music] from the dead [Music] [Music] my [Music] dwell in you [Music] christ from the dead [Music] [Music]

word because we have become the word [Music] oh hallelujah sorry saints this strikes my heart so strong the prophet god said you know what you've been living below your privilege i'm tired of living below my privilege i'm tired of seeing us live below our privilege it's time for us to say god promise this i'm rising up to it i don't care what i see i don't care what i feel i don't care what anyone else says i'm gonna live what my privilege is hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah what almighty god we serve no listening that song break every chain we're just with this dismiss on this i i
