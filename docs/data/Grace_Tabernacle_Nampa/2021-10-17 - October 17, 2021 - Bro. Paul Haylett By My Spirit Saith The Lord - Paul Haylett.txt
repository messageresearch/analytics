forget somebody then people get left out but sister diane you just don't look any older to me amen hallelujah aren't you glad we're actually in god's thoughts we're actually moving back to that original perfect creation the spoken word of who we are in jesus christ isn't that wonderful amen amen sister victoria amen must have been a good season for for personalities and things and anyway god bless you sister vika amen saints uh just happy to bring greetings to you from the believers in salt lake city we traveled down there last weekend to visit an old friend brother fabian palma from chile and and i guess i had an inkling of that but we got down there and were fellowshipping and they said oh we have decided that you're preaching tomorrow and uh so i traveled down there because i wanted to hear my brother fabian minister and and uh just a lovely time um i was really happy jolin and leah went with us uh sister jolin made a great interpreter and uh just helped many conversations and just just a lovely time amen and so we're just looking forward um as it is just uh i want to take a moment brother jason sent out a text this morning does anyone have a special song or a testimony and i don't think that sister jerry and i are trying to hog everything but you know i just i'll just share this with you because to me it's a very significant event that took place during harvest and uh we were uh working uh one day there in a field that the corn had got pretty dry in an uh a portion of it and as we're harvesting there and and one of the guys come on the radio and said paul i i think there's smoke coming out of your chopper and so you know i pulled it to a halt there and backed up away from the corn and i started to get out and i realized we had a serious problem and i shut it off and needless to say saints when i climbed down and run around the front of it the flames were coming out from underneath and you're like oh my what do you do but uh three fire extinguishers and everybody that was there's bottle of water amen about 30 bottles of water and three fire extinguishers later we had it put out uh you know it's amazing i've had this happen before in my life that god's god's touched me in this fashion uh but i burnt my left hand and you know it hurt but in a couple days no hide fell off nothing a couple days it was just fine and uh by god's grace it did just very minimal damage to the machine and then god said well i tested you there and saw how you reacted and so two days later the machine did it again and uh but guys god very minimal damage once again and then the lord showed us uh what the problem was because you see we can have natural problems and we can seek for natural answers and sometimes we can't even find them in the natural you can't find the reason why but the lord is good and we take that over into the spiritual and realize sometimes we have things troubling in our life the water's being stirred and we're not able as it were to get into the water and we wonder why lord but you know the thing is he is faithful and he has come and he has an answer for you and i and his answers are always in the right season his answers are in the right timing that doesn't mean that you don't have to go through the fire it doesn't mean that you don't have to face the troubling times that uh discouraging things but i just wanted to share that uh if i could share the adrenaline and whatever that was there with you you'd be all jumping up and down shouting right now because um you can get quite excited but uh you know it's by god's grace right everything we do in this life is by god's grace and and uh you know we we just stand and and i i won't go into the deeper uh side of this as it is uh but you know sometimes you i think we go through life and we say lord are you or you hear me lord am i am i do you see what's happening in my life lord and then god comes and says i'll let you know that i'm right here with you i'll let you know that i'm walking with you i'll let you know that i'm on the scene and i'm fighting on your behalf and i have answers for you and i have encouragement for you and i have strength for you and and uh you say we're both paul these things are like in the natural yes but the prophet of god showed us so clearly the natural types of spiritual and that we can see these things happening in our life and and uh we're thankful for the lord let's stand today i would like to speak to you once again oh by the way please remember me if i sound a little weird this morning it's because i've been fighting this congestion my ears are plugged and i joked with sister jerry this morning i said i think i'll call in sick and anyway so i have called in sick and my head is plugged and every time i speak it vibrates but praise the lord i'm already healed i'm already delivered in fact the vision of walking on the hills of glory is becoming clearer every single day amen i can see i can see more clearly now amen and i thank the lord for that amen i want to speak to you this morning by my spirit saith the lord amen and and this is a very common scripture uh in uh zachariah the fourth chapter let's turn there verses one through six and as we look at this my brother and sister i i um well you know sometimes i just have to ask jerry as we're maybe driving home from church did this even make sense and uh you know it's my prayer that i wouldn't come to you as paul said you know with great flowing words of wisdom that everyone would say that was that was so intellectually stimulating but we want to come in the spirit of christ we want to come in the word and and uh just to be able to take those words and speak them out and then let god amen now i hope this makes sense to you but a man can speak those words out and often times the carnal will criticize and say i don't even understand what they were talking about but god takes those words and by the time they come down to you he has set them in order and in your heart you say praise the lord that's the word of god i just read that scripture i just i just read that quote uh god just spoke to me in the midnight hour on that right there but the carnal man says well he he jumped here and he jumped there and it didn't even make any sense and not very articulate i was just reading a a age-old criticism of the prophet of god and i thought this is interesting as all of these critics quote the same people they have no new voice but they're all quoting the same negative voice right because you know why they do that because there's only one true negative voice in the land and that's satan and so when they come up and disagree or rebel against the word of god ultimately you'll find now this sounds like a harsh criticism but ultimately you'll come back and see that they're really just quoting satan because if it was anything but satan they would be saying that's the word and we need to line up so they're all going back but you know the prophet of god just speaking in such a fashion and and you look at that and you realize it's like you know this that's birthed in me i had nothing to do with this that has drawn me is not of man this that has changed my life is not a 10-step plan this is not a something anonymous right because we have you know alcoholic anonymous which are good we have narcotics anonymous we have all of these anonymous things my brother and sister i know who changed me there's nothing anonymous about what god is doing in his church hallelujah we're not sitting back saying i'm trying why i feel different i know why i feel different hallelujah now we're looking here and i just need to get to work thank you lord and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is awakened out of his sleep in other words he's just not totally alert but he's awake he doesn't have a grasp of every sense that is going on around him but he is awake and he said unto me what seeth thou and i said i have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and the two olive trees one upon the right side of the bowl and the other the left side thereof so i answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord now this is a servant an angel coming to him right my lord is not capitalized but it is words of reverence of respect of honor then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me know us thou not what these be and i said no my lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor my power but by my spirit say the lord of hosts amen heavenly father we just thank you lord for the opportunity to come today and to gather in your house and father lord while the flesh might be weak lord sitting here today myself father with this congestion lord and my hearing all blurred but lord it's not this flesh that we're trying to preserve it's not this flesh that we're trying to lift up but it is the spirit of the living god in the souls of sons and daughters of god lord our souls could only feed upon the word lord we are human lord so there are things and pleasures and enjoyments of this life but the only true joy that can be found in the heart of your children is when the word your spirit comes down and moves amongst us deals with our hearts and speaks to us and comforts us encourages us corrects us lifts us up with words of authority for the position you called us to lord i ask for every prayer request whether they were spoken even acknowledged today let every prayer that is upon the hearts of your people today come as a sweet order before your throne today lord that you would look with favor upon your children and we ask you father now just to speak to our hearts don't anoint us just in the flesh lord but let us go much deeper into your spirit lord that you would deal with us lord at the foundational level lord as we march forward with confidence in you and your word and the life that you have given us we thank you today lord and bless your holy name in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated you know as we upon the word of god today saints i want to remind you that unlike many of the religious world we have not segregated the old and new testament as something for them and for now but understanding that jesus christ came to magnify the old testament to magnify the law to you and i that we could understand with clarity of what he was doing what he said in the beginning because he said i'm god and i change not so we can't come to a day that god puts a giant period at the end of his word and goes into a whole different chapter of a whole different thought of a whole different way we will find with the correct interpretation of the word that everything from the beginning to the end he says i am alpha and omega so he's claiming the very start of it all and declaring i am the finish of it also we don't have a god who wonders somewhere in the middle and changes thoughts or changes stride but it is all about the same amen god is the same yesterday today and forever and so we realize the old testament if we have the right interpretation is just valid today now god was gracious and he he brought about in the new testament a a a more open dialogue if you would use those terms he spoke to us more in a fashion of which we could understand in the day that we live in and this was the word being magnified right now my brother and sister i hope you understand me today uh don't don't misunderstand me i guess i should say but how simple it would have been that we would have been a people that could have just come once a year to the high priest with our lamb or our turtle dove or whatever it might have been and simply offer the offering that one time of year and then kind of just went every day just living our life i'm not talking about those that went out and just sinned again but just living our life you know making a mistake here and there like i made about 10 or 12 yesterday you know i don't know about you but you know i just going on with no real conscience of sin i mean it sounds in a way kind of good i can just go live 364 days just live and when it comes to that day i can then just go and bring my lamb and say lord i'm sorry for the mistakes that i made but you see in the magnification of the word of god god said what i'm going to do is show you what the lamb actually represented i'm going to show you of what the consciousness of man actually was and i'm going to bring you to a place that you will no longer come once a year and offer a lamb or a turtle dove or whatever it might have been but you are going to each and every day by the moving of my spirit come and make a sacrifice every single day and if we're not making that sacrifice every day my brother and sister we're actually transgressing not the word of god as it is by the law but we're transgressing the love of christ for you and i we're saying you know i can just go ahead and carry this burden i can carry this problem i can carry this mistake it's not too grievous of a burden but by revelation we see how incredible our god is we see how incredible the things that he is doing and then we realized in seeing how he how magnificent you might say that our god is we actually only then can see how little we really are it when we when we feel like that we've got it all under control we feel like you know what i'm a part of the plan of god i can just do this part here but when we truly catch the vision of who we are in jesus christ my brother and sister that's when we truly see just how little we are so when people feel like oh yes i'm a great spiritual man my brother and sister that's good you ought to have confidence in god of what he's done for you but when you carry that in the human way and in a human thought uh it really is showing people saying now brother paul what you're fixing to say is kind of judgmental yes it is but it's not me doing the judging you see when people think highly of themselves as a christian i'm talking about in the human element it shows you how little they have of revelation of who they are almost like a minister saying you're not going to make it to heaven without me i agree i agree because the minister holds his plan his place in the plan of god but are not a minister with that kind of attitude because the minister first and foremost must present the true picture of christ and that is i am a sinner saved by grace without him i am nothing amen so we look at this now i want to get back on track here we see how zechariah's vision and that's what i would term it for the day because you see it was a time that he just uh was awakened out of a sleep and i would say he wasn't there with absolute complete clarity of mine now that's maybe just my opinion but there's with a state where god is able to come and deal with it now i don't know if this happens this way with you i believe it would be there's times that you would awaken in the night you're not really awake but you're not really asleep and those are times that god speaks to you it's in that state where we're not caught up with i must go do this i must do this got to fix this got to go here but it's in that state where you're there and i believe that was the state that zechariah was in when god come to him and i believe that we can make these comparisons today of zechariah's vision and i say it's for our day also see the continuity of the word always ties everything together now the critic might say well we believe certain scriptures and this is kind of a theology thing as the way i would put it that uh the more they go to school the more they find uh problems with the bible amen i'll just be a simpleton i will just be a guy that looks at this and finds no error finds no a contradiction finds no problem with the bible because you see the god who ordained the writing of the bible we're not talking about king whatever in england you know that was just a translation my brother and sister the god who ordained the writing of the bible a god that is so great to hang us in the heavens now my brother and sister i thought this was quite interesting i saw a little deal the other day how that they're once again renewing their push to go out into the galaxies and whatever else to try and find the origin hallelujah they're just looking way too far see they've went they went a million miles off when the origin is right here in the midst of his church the origins right here walking on the earth making his presence known but you see they don't really believe in a god so they're looking for something that's just you know a manufacturing in a galaxy somewhere that's just kicking out you know a an earth every once in a while and you know something that is done but you see the continuity of the word is tying everything together and and i want you to think about this uh what he's tying together in you uh something that the word starts to stir in your heart and you come one day to an awakening that i'm not just as it is a sinner saved by grace but i was part of the plan of god from the very beginning and when that becomes real in us it changes so many things in our life because then we realize that it is even greater than just when i can see taste hear smell here in this world it's just such a greater thing and and god starts tying all these pieces together and you know my brother and sister i it's interesting i've talked to many believers through the years and they have a common testimony that they share and that is even as a child and growing up they never felt connected as it were to things of this world they always like they were a little bit of an oddball and so you know that we look at that and realize that this is gone tying everything together and so there's not one conflicting word in the word of god and so we look now as it is here that this vision that zacharias had he sees now the seven golden candle sticks and we understand my brother and sister tying it back into our day of uh brother branham preaching this really making emphasis the thing is the critics want to say you know what he just plagiarized that no my brother and sister it just shows that those others through the years that have spoken such topics were anointed of god to speak on those topics amen we're not dredging up something that's never been thought or spoken before but many times those men if you go study their ministries you'll find that they spoke on those things but they never brought a complete clarity because the clarity was reserved for this day amen this is when the mystery of jesus christ was to be completely fulfilled or revealed out and so we we don't hold no criticism to those they were just laying down as it were the seeds that would come in another day and we see seven church ages right young people you've been studying the church age book and i think that's good because it lays this foundation to understand what is moving there is even much more history which we understand brother branham uh uh did not feel led to tie all that together imagine what the church age book would look like if you tied every bit of known history of the ages together it would be like here children take your church age book but you see hit highlights of what it was that opened the rest of it up to us see that's what the word of god's about my brother and sister brother branham didn't preach on every scripture in the bible but he hit the highlights that opened it up to us and made it a living book amen so it's there that we look at that we see the seven church ages now everything that happened through this seven church ages i've heard people say before oh i kind of wish you know laodicea is just so hard i wish we'd been born in another age which one bingo god says i'll let you do that bam next thing you know you're standing in the colosseum and there's a line in front of you not this age lord come on saints you've been specially equipped by god to live in the age that you were called to we don't want to look to another day and think oh if i could have just been here if i could have been there amen reminds me this was just a forgive me i hope this doesn't sound sacrilegious in a sense but reminds me one time of a a little spoof movie i've seen and this this kid was walking around you know and i had a couple pistols on a belt you know and he was telling his friend he said i sure wished i had been a cowboy back in the days of the indians cowboys and indians and all of a sudden he disappears the next thing you know he's standing out on the grass of the prairie and he's surrounded by indians be careful what you ask for amen stick to the basics stick to the foundation i need more of you lord that's what i'm asking for you can never go wrong with that approach to the word of god lord i need more of you amen so you look at this but all of these church ages were all and just pardoned my verbiage were all powered by the holy ghost there was not one age that it was man's intellect or man's physical strength or prowess that ever brought them through that age every one of the seven church ages was a complete dependence upon the anointing of the holy ghost in their life and even when they really didn't talk about it as it were being the holy ghost when when they were not really cognizant as we view it today it was god in their midst leading them and guiding them and strengthening them and when they would be there and as paul is speaking to them and peter is speaking to them about these things concerning the spirit of god and you know they they come back with responses like we don't know if there be a holy ghost but they had a desire for it you see it was a season you might say of enlightenment and we don't use that in in a casual term but enlightenment being a season of revelation coming the word opening up coming alive to them and the ministry that our lord jesus christ brought in that day we can look at that and say you know in a way it was simplistic do you follow me in a way it was very simplistic but once again i want to make a connection here for you so they are there looking at this saying well the ministry of jesus christ was very simplistic he come and he spoke in these fashions it was there you know why because he knew exactly as it were what button to push for revelation to flow down into the church he wasn't spoon feeding them as into baby them like wallflowers but by revelation the opening of the word come and while some got angry and walked away some said we believe you to be the messiah the son of god what a contrast my brother and sister now pardon me i say this with a tad bit of humor this morning but are we eagles or are we buzzards come on it's it's not going to be what we can prove and not prove it's going to be how you receive and react and and god's placed it in there and i'm telling you i've heard some rough preaching in my life i've heard some tear off the hyde type of preaching before and basically preachers making statements like i sometimes wonder if there'll be anyone in this building today make the rapture but he didn't realize he just included himself but you see those kind of statements my brother and sister some walk out and say yeah i'm not going to make the rapture we never see them again but some just keep pressing forward because regardless of what he is i know what god said and god wasn't speaking as it were with the words of man but he spoke to my soul and it might have been the worst man that brought it or carried it down but it was still the spirit of christ that touched my soul and i am the bride of christ and there'll be no preacher send me hell you know that i want you to hear me today and hear me well there'll be no preacher send you to hell amen it will be your reliance on that preacher that might send you to hell but it's the word of god that redeems you and even there i just read it this morning i should have put it in here i had no idea this vein would come this way but the prophet of god was talking about how god can use a jackass to speak now i say that with a tad bit of humor but i want you to understand that just because we're looking at the vessel that's speaking don't look at them measure by the word by the word can somebody say by the word amen so seven church ages powered by the holy ghost all anointed and this is what stirs my heart because it's a very big subject all positionally placed god never made one single accident amen nobody was back god didn't send alex back there to the second church age and him they're telling me here i can reprogram your your iphone for you come on every one of us is here praise the lord there's those that can reprogram an iphone i i can mess them up i can't reprogram them but you see god places each one positionally but you know being positionally placed does not mean easy who's positionally placed this morning who's been called of god and know you're to stand in this age and stand as a testament of the power of almighty god hallelujah now how many of you can lift your hand and say it's been easy not one of us can say it's been easy in fact sometimes we we cry and moan to ourself lord why is my burden so heavy why is my circumstance such as it is well i'll tell you quit looking at the circumstance paul i mean saints and realize that god positionally placed you then god made a way for you to fulfill what he called you to it's not about how we feel about it amen now look you know i've been criticized before being a cherry picking quote reader well i'm telling you what i just have got worse and worse about that cherry-picking amen the queen of sheba hey man look at the link to that quote is that not cherry-picked but i want you to read it god don't always work on the easy road and things that's at your hand you have to struggle to do the will of god sometimes now i call your attention to the title of that sermon and in that sermon if you go and listen to it you'll see where brother branham talks about people say oh oh i'm on the north side of chicago and this is down here and brother brown says yeah yeah it's too far for them to go but she traveled that far and that's why god said she'll come in the day and she will judge why because it wasn't bring the message to me it was a yearning burning searching hunger down in the heart and soul of the queen of sheba and she said i hear that there is a man brother branham makes this statement he says solomon did not go to them they came to solomon see so showing the hunger now we can have such a hunger my brother and sister for for people we can have such a hunger to do this i've done this before and god showed me where i made my mistake and we go and actually cater oh what is it that will take you to get you to come to church what is it will be to to make it where you have this desire i'll tell you what i've done in the past realized it was such a huge mistake i provided a house i provided the electricity i provided the heat i provided food i paid for gasoline and they still wouldn't serve the lord now i don't want you to think i've become callous but i'm telling you you want to serve god you say you have a desire in your heart become a queen of shiva brother brown also says in this sermon i might as well put the quote in here shouldn't i now i'm trying to quote it from memory brother brown says she didn't travel in no cadillac and she come and she said i'm going to be here long enough to see if this is the truth and then brother brown says and some of these won't even sit for three minutes aren't you glad god's made you work for it i don't mean works as in works but you know what i'm talking about amen because when it also says and the other queen of sheba which was pre preached just about two months from this one earlier he also says in there that you don't appreciate it when it comes to easy amen but when there's a burning desire down in the soul to serve god can somebody say amen i have burning desire to serve god you just keep pressing and you say why am i pressing they quit they quit why am i pressing because you are called now look don't misunderstand we're not putting them out we don't know what god's timetable is for them i'm talking about you today and your life you here amen you can't quit why because there's something inside of you that cannot be restrained and knows that the word of god which is the very life of christ is not able to give up hallelujah you know in the message and then jesus came now i had this book with me in the harvester and i've read it sporadically and sometimes those sporadics are just so cool because there'd be a truck coming in the field but they're not there i reach down and i pick it up and i open it up and i maybe only get to read two paragraphs and i'm just stunned by what i'm reading i'm like my but i don't look at the page and so i want to go back and read it again and i think it's about page 17 and i turn page 17 but there's another stunning quote and jesus came they thought or he thought that they'd went off without their lord but what did he do got all frantic my children gonna be lost i see what satan's gonna do oh my they're gonna be lost no he didn't no sir he climbed up on top of a mountain was sitting up there watching that little ship as she was bouncing in the sea oh i'm so glad that that uh he climbed on the ramparts of glory and sets in the majesty on high and his eye is on the sparrow and i know he watches me and he watches you just in the darkest of the hour now look saints i want to clarify in a sense here in the darkest of the hour you'll be saying oh brother paul life's been going good for our family we're blessed we just uh god's been good yes no disaster just look out the window look out the window it's the darkness of the hour if it's not necessarily troubled directly in your family remember that these things must come to pass for the coming of the lord so we are going to face the tempt to see we're going to face the troubles amen we're going to face the conspiracies you know every once in a while i get home from work big mistake actually i turn on the computer and i go and i look at the the news on the computer and and uh you look at that and it's like oh my oh my goodness yes it this this is just horrible and and this is horrible and and this is more horrible than the horrible but in the end you stop and say thank you lord this must come to pass and when this is coming to pass we're not going to walk around with our head in the dirt crying woe unto us we're going to stand up and we're going to say children talking about your family children this is the word of god being fulfilled just as you children living in the presence of god is the word of god fulfilled they both must rise up together we can't pluck the evilness out of our nation out of the governments we can't pluck that up lest we tear up what shouldn't be tore up you see god could come imagine we are in egypt and the death angel passing over america or south africa or chile or england or wherever do you realize the wailing and crying of judgment coming down at that level would be like but i want you to look at another side of the scripture the scripture says in that day that these diseases and pestilence and torments of the mind and spirit would come across the people and they would curse god not a spirit of repentance they would curse god you know saints that's already come to pass the last major earthquake in chile the brothers down there have chronic uh chronicled that way back no major 10 point whatever was 9.9 or whatever and then they revised it later by the new standards it was a 10 something that hit chile many years ago people fell in the streets and cried out to god the church has filled up many new churches built in people and then you see a progression another earthquake and people cried out to god but not in sincerity if you went to church but soon they were back to their deal do you know that right after sister jerry and i left here a few years ago they had that great earthquake down there it was actually in the news in chile it's not something done in a corner that somebody speculated on people stood in the streets lifted their fists to the heavens and cursed god look at the day my brother and sister we're here in our earthquake we're here in our time of great sorrow and travail and destruction and corruption and all of this and we're lifting our hand to the heavens but our hands are open and our voices are saying lord we love you we thank you lord for your word that has redeemed us in this darkest of hours he watches just in the darkest of the hour when every pitch talking about the little boat seemed to be the last one imagine come on can you place yourself in that little boat out there you're going and here comes a wave i don't want to take too much of your time but i've actually been in a situation like that where when a boat hit a wave and you can watch about a foot of water roll in front of the boat and splash in the boat and you are standing inside of the boat with water halfway to your knees and every time the boat getting sluggish and sluggish and one man in the boat this true story i was there one man in the boat on his knees crying out to god repenting of the things he had been doing and doing and other brothers on their knees with buckets and pictures and this and that pitching the water out as fast as they can and you're sitting there even my own self that stage of my life 1988 standing here i was driving the boat and saying lord if this is the end please forgive me forgive me of my shortcomings forgive me of my unbelief saints it's very real it's very real when you look at the horizon and there is no horizon and they're right there just in the darkest hour when every pitch seemed to be the last one the water coming in the boat the boat is now heavy and burdensome then jesus come along walking on the sea i want you to notice they were helpless hopeless despairing and when they saw him they rejoice praise the lord jesus is here they were scared of him the only thing that could help them they were afraid of it there's another reference that i almost used today trying not to be too long brother branham says and that's what the spirit of our day is god's in the midst of the people his spirit moving the supernatural is here to be and we're afraid of him we're afraid of him oh my maybe i think i'm a holy roller they might think i'm a fanatic well i'm here to tell you folks they'll think that regardless because the spirit in them you say look i just by the trevor don't i look somewhat normal put me in wranglers work boots work shirt farmer cap you know such and such fertilizer fuel whatever you know i can go pass myself off as a farmer anywhere but it doesn't take very long that they say something different about you yeah sorry no i don't want to go for a drink no i don't smoke no i don't chew no i don't want to go to your show they'll stand there and try and kill time with you did you see such and such movie the part where the guy did and he did this and did this and you're like don't know what you're talking about but you turn that around and say have you been in church lately in a power of god move and they'd be like you're fanatic really they're worshiping the devil glorifying the devil's expression and you're the fanatic whoa look the only thing that could help them they were afraid of it oh you know i thought it was a different quote i'm sorry saints may i say this tonight in this great hour atomic age when this world is in despair when nations is against nations and total annihilation could come within 30 minutes to the world jesus is coming walking along in this darkest devour the world's afraid of him they're saying isn't that funny how i didn't think i included this i tried to preach this and they're saying it's holy rollers and fortune tellers and everything else could be called and i'm so glad amen that in this dark hour jesus is walking along with his church i can't you lift a hand and say thank you lord you're walking with me amen i'm not alone i might have felt like i was alone but i am not alone amen hallelujah is walking along with his church showing himself alive this is the dark could that be it's way back when when they called it the dark ages this is the darkest hour this world has ever seen since the dawn of time never has it been like this never has it been so separated never has the church been so towards the pieces never has it been so denominationally eat up so many differences so many sensations and things going on in the message but right here in let me correct that so nobody can criticize me i'm just tired of getting criticized going on in the church but right in the midst of it all jesus comes along in this darkest of hour to show himself and his love to his church the darkest devour then jesus comes along now aren't you glad my brother and sister every one of us has had our road to emmaus when we've been walking along and then realized it was jesus christ walking with us it was him dealing with us as him that has changed our perspective it was no longer i tell you what when they hustled back to jerusalem my brother and sister they wasn't going back there saying we're tired and we're discouraged they walked back in there said you guys won't believe what happened i was walking along in this life and i was discouraged yes i had heard truth i knew what truth was but i was still discouraged and then i realized and my eyes were open that jesus was walking with me oh what a life-changing thing it doesn't mean you won't have good days and bad days but it won't control our life for very long let me put it that way it won't control your life for very long you might go through the day but you come to the end of the day in the night you sit down and you start to think upon the things that god has done for you and there is something that just starts to dispel that might be a word from a husband it might be a word from a wife it might be a word from parents or from children it might be words from a brother or sister i'll tell you i was feeling a little bit down look i'm just going to be honest with you i was feeling a little bit down and then my phone goes ding i was already in bed and i thought now who would text me at this time of night but my brother and sister i picked the phone up it was brother prashant sister concha and they had kind words that they were sharing of words of appreciation and i went to bed amen laid my head back on the same pillow and i my heart was smiling i was like thank you lord we are maybe making a difference don't feel like it sometimes that maybe we are and here was words that god said well right before you go to sleep i'm not going to let you go to sleep in that atmosphere and i'm going to speak to you oh hallelujah brother persona sister contra thank you for those words amen now don't feel sorry for me i i would covet your prayers but i've been fighting this congestion and then that's caused my vertigo and uh i've been joking you know with the guys as we're working laying under a chopper vertigo spinning so fast i can't even tell where the bolt is i was trying to tighten and you know i just had to see the humor of it and i told my brother i said would you quit spinning the chopper so i can reach up here and tighten this bolt and he said i'm trying but you're down there pushing it along no no that's not good saints that's not good i'm tired of it i'm fed up with it amen but i'm not going to claim it it's a circumstance and it's there and a doctor says i'm sorry nothing we can really do for for that for you you know we can put you on some drugs thank you i've got some drugs right here it says by his stripes i'm healed amen so i'm going to take that pill every day hallelujah amen showing himself alive darkest hour world's ever seen since the dawn of time denominational spirits trying to eat it up differences so different sensations and things going on in the church now we could look at that and say oh brother brown's talking about the denomination but look how it fits so perfectly in our day you see those spirits oh i don't want to be confrontational but i'm not going to be shy any longer saints i hope you're good with that we go down there there's a brother in salt lake that we just really loved him and his lovely wife little kids no no there was a minister started coming up salt lake kind of integrated himself with the believers there and started working to cut the sheep out cut one here cut one there now this dear brother has moved away to a different church and says if you don't believe that brother branham's coming back and preaching then you're lost i asked the brothers not i wasn't trying to be a know-it-all but i said did you ask him to prove it by scripture they looked at us and no one ever thought but you see my brother and sister the word of god says test everything by the word and the prophet said test everything by the word so are we judgmental to ask someone prove it by the word right is that wrong of us does that mean is that evil no no it's not it's the word so we look at this and realize what's happening my brother and sister do you realize that brother brown speaks of this maybe you've looked at it in this depth and maybe you haven't but brother branham talks about how as a young man actually running from the lord ends up in colorado riding for a ranch and he's talking about how they could only run in the forest if they were purebred right had to have a blood tag you ever seen a blood tag little metal clip typically they have a number that number's recorded in a book that would record when that cow was born that calf was born so they have to have that blood day but there come a day at the end called harvest time and the cowboys were there and they didn't say we'll just go load up 40 cows on this truck and send them to the market no they look at the brand and they cut this one this way and cut that one that way you realize satan understands that principle and he's here now early on trying to you belong over here go on saints are you with me you belong here you belong here you don't belong over there with him you don't belong no if you're over there with him you're not of us the word said we are one in grace tabernacle we are one in bethel tabernacle we are one in living word no we are one come on in christ amen don't let anybody cut you out try and put you in a different pen you don't belong there i'll tell you where i belong hey man i'm still praying for more revelation but i'll tell you where i belong i belong in christ hey man you're gonna slap a brand on me pardon me this expression go ahead slap a brand on me don't smear it i want a good clean brand i want to be branded fiery trials you imagine what these poor calves when i was a young man i'm sorry saints but when i was a young man i used to glory in that take that calf most of it be like what is wrong with you paul i'm sorry it's just how i felt and i've done that to thousands well if i could just do that to thousands for christ i'd be a really happy man amen look at this we branded them for jesus christ they don't belong in any other herd they belong to him hallelujah they don't belong to this ministry they don't belong to this church building they belong to jesus christ let them be marked such but right in the midst of this comes the darkest of hours to show himself and his love to the church amen that's when jesus comes along now he's already declared my brother and sister that this is the darkest hour let's remember that this is the darkest hour so he's talking now that jesus is here in our midst look saints there's been people that have come through this church that didn't believe that god was in them they would say if god's in me where is he at now i want you to understand what kind of a spirit and what kind of intellectual warping that somebody can follow this message read this message hear this message read their bible and even have one question that god's in them or not besides the fact that the prophet god said it over 100 times you see the spirit that's there trying to cut you out put you in a pen no we have the holy ghost we just don't have anything else well what is the holy ghost go look it up go look it up the prophet of god talks about it so many times the holy ghost is god himself and then he comes along and refers to it the holy ghost is christ the anointed one in you and he comes along and says all of these are one it's god amen don't let them amen sorry i don't care how many pardon me for putting you down like your cattle or sheep or something i don't care how many is in that pin over there my brother and sister that don't mean they're right now look let me just it's getting late joel 2 28 the prophet of god referred to this many times and i was going to read from 25 to 30 but you can do that as homework or you probably have it memorized and it shall come to pass after this i will pour out the spirit of the church the spirit of the age he said it was my spirit this is god himself speaking said i'm going to pour out my spirits upon all flesh now when he's talking about all flesh my brother and sister we'd say well this is referring to christians no it isn't there's people around here that prophesy there's people out here their prophecies come to pass if you just pay attention i don't recommend you waste your time doing it but if you just pay attention you will find that there isn't many incredible supernatural signs taking place but that is not the proof that is not the proof the life is the proof amen if it doesn't produce the same exact seed that's right yeah all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall drink dreams your young men shall see visions now look what this is from he's pouring out his spirit he's pouring out his spirit so you look at this and realize saints grace tabernacle will sit here now i'm not i'm not trying to tell you how to worship god don't misunderstand me but don't sit here like a a bump on a pumpkin god's alive in our midst god's moving he's pouring his spirit out but i can also take you in the message where brother brown says so many people don't even wait for god scripture says they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength you know kind of like the old joke pardon me i just have to tell you this minister of a little country church about the size of grace gets invited to go preach at a conference in the big city and he's there and he's shocked lo and behold they say well we want reverend so-and-so to come i want you to minister sunday morning we've heard great things about your ministry and he preaches a phenomenal sermon that sunday morning people are shouting jumping praising the lord right before he's fixing to go home from this trip the board calls him in and says hey pastor we want to invite you to come and pastor the first church great big almost cathedral-like church thousand people gets home from his trip walks in the door oh my his wife's like honey you're so happy he said honey you can't believe it i preached the best sermon i've ever preached in my life and they they invited us to come and pastor the first church and she said what are you going to do and he says you start packing while i pray about it they that wait upon the lord i wonder if his time in the first church was anointed of god you see i could take you to some of the notes i cut off this morning the prophet of god said when you have problems when you're in the will of god god will help you out when you have problems out of the will of god you have to get back in the will of god before god will help you oh lord help us to be in your will amen they that wait upon the lord lord help us to be in your will amen none of this i'll you start packing while i pray about it amen hallelujah now i want to just hurry along here i just can't help myself saints sometimes forgive me lord now here in the sermon oneness brother brown lays this out he says but god said not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the lord that's how i'll unite my church not by organization not by education not by theologians but by my spirit saith the lord i'll bring my sheep together now saints i'll just give you a glimpse of why sometimes i say things to you god allows you to be in a position god allows you but in the last year year and a half i've received a multiple of phone calls of people saying things like brother paul now i know we don't agree on everything but brother so-and-so has a vision for uniting the bride in the message and i'm thinking praise the lord they're going to repent and come back to the word instead you know what i hear saints words that's best of my memory would put brother paul if we of different groups in the message could lay aside our differences bail pure oh i mean yes anyway we could unite believers of the message back together saints maybe i hold on to things a little too tight god's lord's helping me my father the word has just become alive in front of me taking me back hundreds and hundreds of years and god recorded that so that little paul in the year 2021 would not go man that sounds like such a good idea i look at that and i say just a second under and this will tie together in a minute and you'll see and i'm getting close to finishing under messenger right you understand that amen we're not here worshiping brother branham i don't care what the world thinks my brother and sister i don't worship but i see a man that there has not been a contemporary uh to him on the earth in this generation 2020 i mean uh 20th century and 21st century not a contemporary and i'm looking at this and saying yes under my messenger he laid it out right here how we measure everything i'm going to put a two-year-old plane i'm not picking on no churches but just memories uh uh uh under cloverdale bible way under living word under grace tabernacle under uh uh evening light under this is how your no no he said you take it back to the word and when it comes back to the word you'll be able to look at the word of god and you'll be able to say praise the lord it lines up and then he told you after that when it all lined up go pray about it not just it lined up let's go but look at this my brother and sister they're coming and there's a spirit moving denominational spirit moving not god's spirit the spirit of man moving and so i told them uh yeah if i can be in charge come on saints strange how these invitations always include you sitting down and shutting up while we describe what the baseline of our belief is no i'm sorry i'm sorry and you'll realize i why i can't shut up and i'll share that in just a minute it's a quote i've quoted many times it's been on my heart so much in these last few months it just has dominated my thinking amen and i say amen so what happens i'll bring my sheep together yes yes that's it thank you for pointing that out brother david i'll bring my sheep together amen not great ministry you know my brother and sister oh my excuse me listen this signs will bear a record of the same and when he does what happens and his signs will bow record of the same that's how israel could say before they got mixed up with moab oh my goodness so there's a time israel could confess that and this was a pillar of fire over them yes sir what will he do he'll bear record the same kind of a record but after they got disassociated and so with god separated their oneness between them and god and got in with moab and them the victory all failed oh my brother and sister it wasn't necessarily oh i hope i'm not offensive this morning but it wasn't necessarily that the enemy come crashed the gate down took and pillaged and and raped and whatever and went on i know my brother and sister what happened is the spirit of the age started coming in upon the young girls and upon the young boys and started coming in on the parents and people said don't criticize me this is what my parents do when nobody's looking and the victory all failed they stayed in the wilderness for 40 more years till god raised up another group to go over and complete his plan that's exactly what they did now here look at that my brother and sister what's happening here amen moab was a type of the worldly church amen they possessed enough of the word to claim association aren't we all found now i don't want to sound like i'm venting but i'm just making these points i've received amongst these phone calls that i have received in this last year and a half or so i've heard these words spoke to me more than once and it is well aren't we all one uh no let me explain something to you we are not one when it comes to the word of god we are seventh cousins twice removed no sorry we have the same message we're quoting the same quotes we're reporting the same scriptures we we have the same overall you might say umbrella of identity moab had enough to claim association they had the right offering the right altar they had all the right things many of their sacraments were correct but it's what they did after they left church that set them apart they were adulterers they were fornicators they were liars and they were thieves they were idol worshipers but they had the right form of worship what was missing not the fundamental saints they had all the fundamentals right it was the spirit of god that was missing it was not with them but i'm saying here as long as that before they got mixed up with moab israel had the spirit of god with them now look at how beautiful this is i i hope shift gears from all that negative stuff i just preached to you look how beautiful it is god's group look at it now raised up god was raising up a group look at this saints i hope you i want you to see these spiritual types amen i hope i'm not just went radical off the end right here in our day we have that picture perfect wow these are down here worshiping with moab and you know my brother and sister they're singing and dancing getting drunk and doing all of these things they shouldn't be doing that wasn't all of israel that wasn't all of israel that was down there there was a group over here that says it's been a long time and this journey through this wilderness of sin has been hard but i tell you what i remember what my daddy said that his daddy said that his daddy said that his daddy said that we've seen this supernatural and the word of god is forever living and we are here as living epistles read of all men and we will not family we're going to get branded as radicals we're going to get branded as whatever but we're not going to moab's altar amen if we're going to offer a sacrifice to god we're going to bring our own lamb we're going to do it on our own altar and we're going to do it in the right atmosphere but daddy what sets us different honey this sounds boastful this sounds almost arrogant this sounds like we think we're really something but the spirit of god is here and the spirit of god is not there and we are not going to worship somewhere that we know the spirit of god is not present did you see what happened the victory failed daddy where's mama honey i really don't want to talk about it okay daddy let me rephrase this jimmy next door says that mama ran off with so-and-so oh honey it's it's all right it's just the age we live in mommy where's daddy honey i don't talk about it oh mommy bobby over here says he saw daddy down there at the bar with his arm around some half-dressed woman oh honey i'm sad to tell you but that's just what the 21st century is like we all still love the lord and you'll see daddy at church this sunday come on saints i might hang out in a different circle than you do but we hear such we hear such no sir i'm not down here at some denominational church i'm hearing this in the midst of israel amen what's the difference saints spirit of god where the spirit of god there's liberty not liberty to sin but liberty to take brother trevor than boat cutters brother this is a pretty big bolt here help me you take that handle i'll take this one saints just so you know i'm tipping over the edge tipping over the only it's not this edge i'm tipping over this edge because you see satan's here he's here trying to push the darkness amen what's that little story saying darkness is just the absence of light look at this god's group been raised up that's what the prophet of god says see amen till god raised up another group to go over and complete his plan god's got a group he's raising them up the word is raising them up it might be a really small group in comparison to the world saints but i'll tell you what we ought to rejoice chris tabernacle can we rejoice that god said no if i'm not going to let your standard go down i'm actually going to raise up your standard and this is going to go up and up and i'm going to raise you up and up and up and up and up because i have a plan that i spoke out and i predestinated this to happen and somebody's going to fulfill this plan and i've chose you now we should be over here saying thank you lord thank you lord you chose me you chose me oh lord you chose me hallelujah not woe unto me you know i'm trying to live a christian life woe unto me no my brother and sister thank you lord thank you lord that you have chosen us to help complete your plan you see it won't be by an accident it won't be by circumstance it won't be by a distant association but he has raised up and identified people by the word oh that gives my heart joy hallelujah now this coming quote here has been on my mind a lot lately and i want you to understand the most important powerful ministry in your life is not a man the most important powerful ministry in your life is the holy ghost the spirit of christ the spirit of the lord dealing with you praise the lord now we're going to take an informal poll this morning hope you don't mind it's going to be you know anonymous but we'll pass out paper and you'll write your name on it i hope you follow me real careful as brother paul ever said anything that changed your life yeah it's a trick question now to all of you that said no just go ahead and raise your hand that'd be fine chickens paul has never once spoke a single thing that changed your life because if i possess that kind of power get prepared for a radical change are you with me now it's a spirit of the lord and he's kind and he's patient and he just works on us and he just works on us and this is how it works saints just so you won't feel bad about what's happened in your life god starts cleaning you up and we know it's god right we know it's the lord and he cleans us up and we're like praise the lord the chains of that circumstance are gone thank you lord and then you feel the brillo pad come right back and starts cleaning us again you see we multifaceted and when we found deliverance through the word the moving of the spirit that unlocks the door for him to come and deal with the next and with the next and with the next you know they say that pressure is good it brings out the best in you amen i don't like pressure no i'm sorry i don't like pressure what's much more beneficial than god having to pump up the pressure is for us to yield when god comes with his brillo pat i've told you about my grandmother my grandmother anne you're spending the night at my house child you ain't leaving here with dirty elbows they're gonna be bright red like a stoplight but they won't be dirty you see we can either yield and let the holy spirit move and come down and i said now let me put it in this way the prophet of god about this and certainly there's lots of counselors talked about this but one of the greatest encouraging things to a man and brothers you can all thank me and pay me later is when you walk in the door i have a wife that's there you didn't pay off the trash this morning that just makes the guys like i just love coming home i don't know look what a man likes is when he opens the door and his wife is there and she's like hi honey thank you for working hard for me thank you and he slips his arms around her and there's something just changes an atmosphere what is it a yielding she yielded to him he yielded to her and all of those other things yes he did get the trash out of the garbage can and he did set it close to the back door to take out but he forgot his hat he turned and found his hat and then it's chilly out there i'll get back it and then he walked out the door and when his wife comes to the back door all she sees is trash and not only that the triple seal hefty bang doesn't hold water like they said and the day is lit but you see god's raised up a group that's going to go over and she's going to complete the plan and that plan is i will have a people holy submitted to me a people that says if it's not in the word i'm not in it if it's not your spirit lord do you know we can have the truth saints and have totally the wrong attitude we can possess the truth like a hammer but without the right spirit we are the one who's wrong oh my but look i oh sorry to be so presumptuous amen i've been raised up and the word of god shows us there's not a generation to come there's not a church age messenger to come there's not another season to come so i want to ask you a direct question today are you that group or not amen and if we're that group let's claim it let's not sit back and say well let's see you know god's got some anointed ministry well let them speak god's got this church over here god's got this movement over here no sir be courageous be bold amen very much a dear friends to my daughters young lady it was like a daughter to us many years ago and uh they had his funeral yesterday we prayed for carl and you know it's just interesting saints that you you listen as they're speaking and i i enjoyed this uh we were just watching it online um i enjoyed this and there was a bikerish bikerish-looking dude there and he said when i met carl he told me you're going to be my project the guy 7th day adventist but still changed life because someone looked at him and said my ministry is standing right here in front of me i'm gonna this is my uh this is where i get to do my part for the lord i get to show the spirit of christ i need to just i get to show the spirit of the lord this guy's got long stringy hair and he's a biker and he's rough and he's scary but something in me says you're going to be my project imagine how you'd feel your biker i could squish you with one hand and kick you to the curb but there was something there you see god has a people who's got a ministry now we'll close here sister emmy would you please come that way i i will have to now i've read this in the church here many many times through the years but i love i love this quote a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and creeds if you preach more than 45 minutes you're out of the will of god because that's what brother branham says it's right you realize how long we've been out of the word of god saints i'm sorry when i was a newbie as a pastor as a minister i still couldn't preach for 45 minutes that was just the warm-up so what do we do we create dogmas and creeds not the simple word they could no longer speak for god then god sent wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day and the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistles read and known of all men for their generation and when the method has failed god raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in this last day now don't read any further i know some of you could quote a verbatim but don't read any further in this last day okay so let's not look back when brother branham was here this message my brother and sister the proof that this message is true is what there's a bride on the earth today there's the vindication saints we can look and say well brother branham uh uh prophesied and it came to pass brother branham uh read their uh you know discern the intents of their heart and that was true and and that's that's a vindication now the real vindication sitting here this morning men and women filled with the holy ghost raising families filled with the holy ghost that's exactly what the word said it would there's our vindication hallelujah you know you can draw something out you can draw something out i just was watching this deal kind of got interested recently in machining work and and these guys had all these blueprints but nobody had actually verified that the point something something of this and the four point this this to the decimal point of whatever brother jason kind of knows he was in the bigger steel but now they do stuff in this major and uh when you add up the two point blah blah and the three point the one point this point point that point and they're greater than the overall measurement when you get down to the end you've got a problem because that one hole's out here in no man's land right so it's all gonna line up no matter how perfect the machine is millions of dollars in these cnc machines controlled by computers with men who have to write very intricate programs to make it all work men who make hundreds of thousands a year just because they can program that machine but if it doesn't all dovetail we got nothing so what was it is until in this last day what we read earlier is the people that got raised up this last day another people in the land who under their messenger right we're not trying to step out people are like you guys are saying something the prophet didn't say you know imagine that saints you wonder sometimes where people are at individual look you in the face and say you are not allowed to read between the lines one moment the prophet of god says you will read between the lies now what kind of spirit would lead somebody to try to keep you in the dark young people i we're just gonna we're gonna dumb you down i'm gonna dumb you down so far that when we tell you in church to stand on your head you're gonna ask for how long no sir we're gonna enlighten you by the word of god that you can take every spirit and test it every spirit intestine to say under their messenger will be the final final can somebody tell me what the word final means [Music] you're all right sister carrie's like real simple final periods [Laughter] no look saints the voice in the land is what the work is finished christ has come word is manifested now it's coming to fruit you know i'm going to eat of the fruit of the tree when the tree gets another 20 feet taller sorry this is all the bigger the word comes because it's coming to maturity it's not going to come well when we see this come on i don't want to hurt anybody's feelings i know we have family and friends and whatnot but there's nowhere in the scripture for us to just start adding to the book he didn't leave a lot of empty pages at the back of the book for us to just to do it in fact if there was another book of acts written not when another book is written but if there was we would be writing it saints do you realize that god's not going to raise up someone else to write that book of acts he would commission you and if there was another book of acts written to be recorded for another generation to look at they would be seeing people with names that resembled your names [Music] sister miriam there's a miriam in the bible and if there was another book of acts written it would be miriam in this day that would record once again believing the word of god hallelujah look saints we come under that messenger and i'm proud to be i'm not ashamed at all of what i believe i'm not ashamed of where i come from i'm not ashamed of who god said i am amen and i will under that you know what that is that's the ultimate sign of respect to come and say here's the revelation god gave a prophet to our day and that word has come down and becomes so real in me that i'm gonna go live i'm gonna go live one more anecdotal thing reminds me of a guy bought a swing set like a lot of men he told his little girl honey i'll have this swing set set up for your birthday party so there he is in the dark in the backyard he can't read the directions so he throws the directions away and he's putting it all together and here's this one board the holes line up but it's too long and he's out there in the backyard these ridiculous people can't even get their boards done takes that thing cuts it off puts it in place [Music] in the morning he gets up and his wife says honey where's the handrail for the playstation he looked around and here was a board and he picks it up it was up there the holes line up but it's too short [Music] don't try to change the word the prophet said god was going to raise up a people instead of trying to question who where how why don't we look at that and say lord can i be that people if you're going to do something supernatural and you're going to pour your spirit out our young men and our daughters are going to prophesy lord can it be our young men can it be our daughters lord can we sit here and say lord if someone's going to receive the spirit of god lord let it be me let it be our church i don't feel like i fit lord but i i'm not gonna try and change myself because i believe your plan is perfect i'm not gonna look and say you know this sister she'd be better this way and i'd rather be better that way i believe god knows what he's doing saints just let god be god in our life and let the spirit of the living god come down in our midst and instead of looking and backing up from that of like i don't know where they're going but i'm why don't you stop and say lord show me the way i'm supposed to go [Music] show me lord the way i'm supposed to go let the spirit of the living god come down and speak to my life and change me i don't i'm not i'm not ignoring you saints and i'm not pushing you out of my mind but you know more and more i'm focusing lord help me be right help me walk in your spirit lord help me be anointed by the holy ghost lord because it's then i can actually help my brother my sister then we can actually have a project because then we'll actually have a holy ghost testimony hallelujah oh my my brother and sister [Music] let's just stand sing a song or two [Music] isn't that amazing i looked at the clock a little bit ago and it was 11 54 and [Music] i spirit of the living god brother jason come help me sing this spirit of the living god could that be our prayer today saints the spirit of the living god fall fresh on me i'm not trying to look back to a day going by when well i remember when i was 18 and the holy ghost just moved upon me in a youth camp and i gave my heart to no how old are you now i'm 50. [Music] but i'll tell you what's happening saints i'll tell you what's happening there's men and women see they were boys and girls but they're men and women now they walked away i know of many cases right now we won't mention names and places not all right but they walked away at the same time of life that i walked away and this is why it moves me so much they walked away by god's grace it was still 20 years for me to make my way back they're now 50 47 to 56 years later coming laying down on the altar forgive me lord i can't deny the life that's in that scene you can't deny the word don't let us get the wrong attitude don't let us get the wrong spirit don't let us get to the place we give up 50 years imagine a little boy ten years mom and dad have quit the message anointed by a spirit i believe the holy spirit the little boy comes into the kitchen one evening it says mom and dad 10 years old no one thinks a 10 year old spiritual 10 years old says mom and dad we've made a mistake we need to go back to church mom and dad says we are not going back that is a cult [Music] 50 years later [Music] that boy finds himself in an altar and for 50 years all i've thought about is why did my mom and dad do this to me i wanna want you to catch this what stopped him he knew he knew in his heart where he belonged what kept him from just turning to it [Music] a spirit a spirit a spirit of scarecrows a spirit of darkness a spirit of fear a spirit of will they accept me a spirit of this and a spirit of that that finally broke through found himself in an altar weeping giving heart back to the lord god giving deliverance to him of 50 years of chains come on saints you don't think the atmosphere that we create as a church as a body of believers matters you don't believe the atmosphere within the walls of our own homes i'm preaching myself this morning the atmosphere within the walls of our homes we think it has no difference in the lives of our children god help us [Music] let's have the spirit of the lord in our house let's let the spirit of the lord the spirit of the living god let it come down oh hallelujah i'll just be quiet [Music] [Music] french [Music] spirit of the living god fall fresh on me [Music] break me just open your heart [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] let's sing it again as we worship him and praise [Music] [Music] all fresh on me spirit [Music] fall i'll sing fresh words from your heart [Music] [Music] living [Music] now if you just lift your hands this morning just speak from your heart to the lord you know every circumstance of your life you know how that satan would call my brother dwayne lawson sharing a testimony recently with a young boy coming in the presence of god the holy ghost moving yet someone who thought that was just some pentecostal thing tell them that's not god that's not god that's not god he walked away a lot of years have went by that young man is now older god moves upon him he gives his heart back to the lord and he realized the whole time that had been the devil lying to him to keep him from the presence [Music] the lord realized what happened when he was a child was the holy ghost it was god moving oh saints let's let's just create an atmosphere i pray let's create an atmosphere the revival's not dead the life is not gone hallelujah we are sons and daughters of god of the living god filled with the spirit of the lord hallelujah we've been given authority i just encourage you let the spirit of the living god fall on you fill you up strengthen you for you are the chosen generation called to bring forth the fruit of god in this death lord we just call upon you today lord we put every hindrance father every negative thought that's hindered us we put it behind us now and we step forward into your spirit lord and we just father yield our spirit lord if our spirit doesn't line up with your spirit lord take our spirit lord we give it to you freely father and ask you lord [Music] fill us father that we can stand the test of time that we can stand the test have the testimony oh lord you know this is just my own thoughts lord but people sing that song oh they're working on their testimony i say yes thank you lord the testimony that i was born i was raised up in the presence of god and he has held me every single day of my life i did not have to fall away but i have been kept by the spirit of the living god oh god that our young people could have that kind of a testimony oh god i know many of us don't have that kind of testimony lord but there's absolutely no reason lord that our young people cannot be raised up in an atmosphere where the spirit of the living god rules life guides them strengthen them bringing them to your presence oh oh my god help us lord fall fresh on us i pray today lord [Music] we're not called to live by stale manna father we don't need to get used to an appetite of wiggle tails lord moab is not our friend oh they might be some distant relative and they might claim the same identity but lord we have been called out of egypt we've been called into a promised land lord and the word is making the way for us if we'll just stand with the word oh lord we ask for your guidance lord bless the saints lord you know there's burdens upon my heart just ask your father touch those burdens lord i pray hallelujah you know there's a called out number amen we've been reading about it this morning and i'm going to sing i'm in that number amen hallelujah when he called out a people to fulfill his word in this day saints i'm going to say i'm in that number amen i'm identifying that number well brother paul you know you this you that you know you're right not even going to deny it i have my pro i have to repent it daily i'm sorry i just have to repent hey man brother branham preach letting off the pressure i'm still working on it but i'll tell you what there's something that's deep down in my heart and i know i'm in that number hallelujah hallelujah i'm in that old highlander [Music] i'm in that number i'm in that number i'm in that number [Music] number that bloodwash number john saw that number [Music] now look i got something to say to you here i'm sorry saints amen john saw the believers do you believed and saw the believers amen you believe john saw you because if you were in the number of the believers that john saw john saw you now i'm going to bring that a little closer home the prophet of god goes there and he sees all the believers in their national attire walking amen and he saw that worldly church moab he saw her prancing along she thought she was so gorgeous and no doubt in the physical realm she maybe was but he saw her in the way that she thought was serving god and brother branham's heart breaks and then he's like oh no and then he hears this onward christian soldier and he sees the bride in every national dress and whatever coming over and he sees them going by you believe the prophet saw you hallelujah he didn't say i saw a few people he said he saw the bride hallelujah so look at the continuity is god allows on to see the bride why because he's showing john the clear picture and he saw brother brown was allowed to see the bride because he was showing brother branham the clear picture hallelujah not an abstract not well there will be something like this he showed him the actual bride of jesus christ and i want to go a step further if i can this morning or afternoon whatever you want to call it amen when you come to jesus christ i hope you didn't see some abstract picture i hope you saw him jesus christ the word hallelujah he said i don't want you to just have some abstract thought of who i am in this final age the revelation of jesus christ would be made manifest hallelujah oh my goodness my brother and sister what's he look like brother paul right here right here but you know it's even greater when i see him i shall be like him hallelujah i'm not gonna be someone different i'm not a different product i'm a product of him hallelujah hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm in the number john saw that number [Music] john saw that number that same spirit that is christ from the dead hallelujah i feel like singing saints i've skipped church so much lately that i started to think do i where do i go to church at amen had to get my wife to drive me to church so i could find it hallelujah and i'm glad about christ in here the words living the words alive the word is real and i have become the word hallelujah [Music] spirit that raised christ from the dead dwell in you oh [Music] [Music] oh it will quicken my mortal body through that spirit that dwell in you well it shall quicken your mortal body [Applause] [Music] dwell in [Music] in you
