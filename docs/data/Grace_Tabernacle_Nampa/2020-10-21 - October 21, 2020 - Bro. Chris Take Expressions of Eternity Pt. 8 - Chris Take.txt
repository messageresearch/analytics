here praise the lord thank you musicians amen why don't we stand tonight and uh it's good to see y'all's faces again but the boxes holding up my camera weren't exactly inspiring it's good to see you all face to face i know we've seen each other already but as far as preaching amen it's good to be here tonight praise the lord genesis chapter one yeah go ahead and put that up i put together a few slides tonight so we'll see how this goes for us so to my title tonight this uh we're speaking on expressions of eternity part two and title is the spoken word and we're going to turn the bibles to genesis chapter 1 [Music] verse 1 the very beginning of the bible praise the lord in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day revelations 22 from genesis to revelations if your revelation doesn't move all the way through the bible you might have to double check it [Music] revelations 22 or just discard it revelations 22 it's okay to smile tonight revelations 22 verse 18. i know it's hard to smile when you're tired praise the lord for i testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book it's about our heads heavenly father lord jesus we ask you to just come down tonight lord father i have few notes nor we're relying completely upon you but that is how you designed it from the beginning lord it's never been about me it's never been about any man lord but it's been about you father it's been about your your relationship with us father and what can be said across this sacred desk tonight lord to strengthen that relationship because at the end of the day father that's really all that matters without that relationship father our life is a dead end it's not that relationship father we find ourselves completely separated but god lord true life is a relationship with you father i pray tonight you would speak to our hearts lord move aside mine my nerves lord my opinions my thoughts lord that we will be totally harnessed by your word by your will by your spirit lord we ask that you will just come down now lord father may you speak lip to ear lord jesus and father may you inspire your children tonight inspire them beyond father this flesh inspire them beyond their own ideas inspire them father beyond what someone else may have told them father that your revelation would pierce and divide father the ideas of man lord and that father you would come and take full complete control we love you lord and thank you in jesus christ's name we pray amen praise the lord you may be seated i know it's that awkward like everyone knows we sit down now but he didn't say it praise the lord so brother branham says in the cruelty of sin and the penalty that it costs to rid sin from our lives 1955 i can see this little halo move over over this world which was merely a cinder frozen hanging out there like a great iceberg and he moved it over near the sun and he began to turn it like that around the sun and it began to melt and the big ice glaciers tore loose texas was being formed and the planes there as were taught how the icebergs were icebergs come down through there best chronolog chronologists can figure out and then the whole world after it run down into the gulf of mexico and so forth began to burn up with water and the world without form and void now we're in genesis 1 see now then god moved and separated the firmament from the waters and he made the light praise lord is that the right one okay i'd like that view better if that's right praise the lord so oh it goes back and forth all right so when the when god began to when god had the vision to express when god had the desire to express his vision for the world there was nothing there was as a genesis says though earth was without form and void but as we know in in the in the message we learned that the seeds were actually already in the ground but yet god had to speak over those seeds god had to speak over the the earth god had to bring forth the light and the light is what brought forth the life right so but with within these seeds laying within the world or the on the earth was the life and so then then came the light and uh it's god spoke it it was it was an expression of god or the logos because god was not god yet at that point it was an expression he had and we know that following following on with our title that this was an expression of eternity so god had a desire before anything ever was out there it was just blackness god had a desire to speak and bring forth the earth as we know it and his desire didn't stop there he then had a desire to bring forth life upon the earth to bring forth you and i so that we could make him god because god is an object of worship so as god spoke over the the earth whoops their life began to come forth from those seeds that lay down in there see god when god does stuff that's why science can can tap into this and say oh no we we can prove evolution because god is so great he does things in order so he created the seed why couldn't he just have spoken this little plant and it just appeared because his design was a seed being watered and nurtured with light coming down upon that seed to bring forth life upon it see god has a program and god's program always follows god's word amen praise the lord and so there there was no manifestation of god there was no manifestation of god until he expressed from eternity his vision and that was the spoken word sorry it's a little bit distracting i'm sorry so the manifestation of god there was nothing from god until he expressed his vision from eternity through the spoken word brother branham preaches the message spoken word is the original seed and after we preach the sermon you should go listen to that at some point between now and but he says in 1962 he says now after i have told you why i believe the word and what god said about it how it should not be taken or added to taken from i want to go into the dense part of it to contact to the context of this long text that i have drawn out and explain to you and show you what happened then you can see the reason i believe what i believe it says a turning point message that he that he ministered and the title uh really says it all right people rattle off the title sometimes just uh but they'll never stop to think about it he goes on to say he says and you can see the reason i believe what i believe see now it cannot be mixed and it will not hybrid with nothing else it will not hybrid why because it's the original today is a great day of high breeding animals corn wheat making a better looking product but it's no good it's rotten there's no life in it dies can't reproduce itself it's dead because everything that we have on earth today in its original form is a spoken word of god so in other words god from the beginning he spoke out in in over the the earth that was without form and void there was nothing he spoke out life came her light came and produced life upon the face of the earth and you say oh well when a plant grows up and it dies that's the end of the plant but the thing of it is about god's word is that it continues on so that plant dies but guess what its death brings forth another life and just how christ he came down and he died on the cross his death brought forth life within you because you see his he could you know it's like the devil thought he had him at that day on calvary but if you would have known and believed the word he would have known there was no possible way regardless of what they did did to him regardless of his death that could stop him because because even christ jesus himself walking the shores of galilee was an expression of eternity was a spoken word so it had to continue on it had to continue on and so because because mary the the holy spirit the angel told mary the holy spirit will overshadow you and bring forth and bring forth the holy spirit overshadow you and you'll be with child right so that very cells that were placed in her womb that was an expression of eternity that was the spoken word so the spoken word cannot stop there is no end to the spoken word and that spoken word is an expression of eternity so he goes on to say he says because everything we have on earth today in its original form is a spoken word of god we still have trees when god created the earth however many years ago there was trees guess what they're still trees it's a continuation the seed bringing forth life of itself right but he says that's why that a mule a bastard born an animal with a cross breeding cannot breed itself back again because who came up with the mule man man's idea cannot continue on this is good tonight it's like a bible study you know sometimes a preacher has an idea in his head and what his sermon is going to be like and then he comes out and he has to he has to follow the leading of the holy spirit and it changes praise the lord but you just have to make yourself relax and say whatever god's idea for tonight was well that's the best one praise the lord so a man a man-made idea now we say we say we say these idioms man's idea man's organizations and i feel like sometimes they come in one ear and go out the other and then we go out tomorrow and we accept man's ideas because we did church last night but the thing what is is you have to ask yourself is who i'm spending time with feeding me life that's even in your friends that's even in your in in you know the atmospheres that we go is it breeding life now we have to sometimes be in atmospheres that we don't appreciate because of work but you can carry that atmosphere of christ around with you so man comes up with something but it might look like a really good idea it might sound really good but you give it time if you can't okay you give it time to see what'll happen but you take that idea back to the word if you can't find it if you can't understand it if you don't catch a revelation of it put it on the shelf as they say that doesn't mean you give up and say well i can't understand this the messed whole message is false i'm sorry dude most of you understand exactly how your car works no but you still drive it every day you don't park it on the side and say never mind i'll walk you keep driving it what will happen if you accept man's idea is there will be no seed well what's the great controversy in the message today is the tent vision we just heard this on sunday what what's happening in the tent it's you receiving seed from christ which is the spoken word which is the original seed so when you go in there you receive seed of christ listen a woman that's pregnant aside from that space of time whose their womb is sealed they can't get pregnant again they're two months three months pregnant there's it's not they're not going to get pregnant on top of that the same natural always types of spiritual once you receive the seed of god thank you jesus you cannot receive man's idea that's why you can say i don't understand why this person does that when it's not it doesn't line up with the word perhaps their womb is not sealed and i'm talking about extreme cases where it's blatantly obvious and they've been faithfully taught so he goes on to say he says because everything that we have on earth today in its original form is a spoken word of god that's why that a mule i read that part god made a horse and he made it and he made a donkey you breed them two together you got a mule see they're both god's thoughts the horse and the donkey our spoken word but see it was not god's plan that a donkey breeds with a horse you see you see how tricky the devil is right it would say if it would deceive the very like it would deceive the very left if it were possible because it's so close say well god made the horse and god made the donkey and my pastor made the mule so it's got to be right right i can find it in the message i can find the horse and the message i can find the donkey in the mess i can find both of these in the bible but guess what you can't find now this is spiritually speaking not physically you can't find the mule in the bible and that's the tricky part right because you say oh this side the horse came from the message in the and the bible and the donkey came from the bible and the message but those two together don't follow both any doctrine you pull out of the bible has to line up with the message any doctrine you pull out of the message has to line up with the bible i say this tongue in cheek if i read something from the message that's contrary to the bible guess what that's false doctrine now we know by revelation that everything for that was said right in the message lines up with the bible even but you even see that's why you have to pay attention because brother branham in the early days says love was the evidence of the holy ghost but it wasn't that was contrary to the bible but you see that's why you have to take the whole thing you can't just pull this out i as a minister of the gospel i can't pull a quote to support an idea unless that idea is supported throughout the message and the bible you say well you just you just when you preach you just read quotes yes i read summaries excerpts of the idea but that thought that idea doesn't come from me it comes from christ and that thought expressed through the preaching of the word is going to what bring overshadowing the holy spirit upon your womb of your soul that's why you need the preaching of the word and we're going to get into that it's hybrid therefore it can't breed itself back so in other words there is no continuation of life that's why sometimes you see that there's a church right years ago it raised up it was it was dynamic the pastor's dynamic then the pastor died and the church died because there was no christ there was no spoken word we're going to he goes on to say he says we're going to hit the serpent seat after a while now it can't breed itself back it's okay to say amen this is the word it's not my idea you're like the pastor's not here what's he gonna say the spoken word continues to live on if you receive the revelation of the word that's going to bring forth life what is that life going to look like now i i speak in in the physical is that going to look like short skirts is that going to look like makeup is that going to look like you know a guy with a shirt so tight you can see his ribs hey you you didn't have to say that before i don't know i mean i'm only 28 so i don't remember but you got a preset now because people are walking around you're like bro that's about four sizes too small skinny jeans there's an expression from within it's hard sometimes when you i have i know people like this it's hard sometimes when when you hear when you hear them speak you're like oh it sounds good it lines up with the message but then their life doesn't and it it boggles you it's hard to look past but what what what would cause somebody to to to know what to say but their life not mess up match up it's in their head there's a song you take that they take it from my head down to my heart because when it's in your head lord help me to say this right not to sound blasphemous when it's in your head though it's the word it's just an idea of yours it's a man idea but that spoken word when it makes it into your heart it'll bring forth life why because the mind isn't isn't a betting ground your soul is your heart is so the word can't grow what i'm trying to say is the word can't grow in your head it's like you put a seed on out you take a seed and you set it on a slab of concrete you can dump all the water on it you can dump all the emotion on top of it you can go to camp on top of it guess what nothing's going to happen because and that that that that um praise the lord that seed can can start to to soak up soak up that moisture maybe you see a little bit of that sign there but you know just like the bible says you sow on the rocky ground it springs up fast but it dies because there's no sustaining power there i don't where where are we going amen praise the lord so everything god created on this earth continues to bring forth of its kind the spoken words and expression of eternity this message has to continue to bring forth of its kind we should think of a different word to call this besides the message because it carries so many to stigma it bothers me i don't tell people you know i'm in the message i mean not that i ever did but i'm a christian if you you okay brother brown said the message will never denominate but did you know you can live the message as a denomination you can express the message as a denomination do you think that's an expression of eternity do you think god is going to be in that guess what you can see fulfillments of what you would say is god because the rain falls on the just and the unjust you can see women denominational women in short hair and makeup and pants and earrings dancing underneath the anointing of the holy spirit yes it's the holy spirit but the bible says the rain falls on the just and the unjust so it has it does not mean that inside there is christ i don't know why this keeps coming up god forgive me i'm not preaching against any man but there is no life in tape only because it is hybrid they say oh how how dare you speak tape only across guess what in the day and age that we live in we're going to have to just call it out you say oh you're just saying that because you're in front of friends no no given the opportunity being led of the holy spirit yes you believe god god leads your conversations conversation with somebody if the holy spirit isn't pushing you you just say okay that's nice have a nice day you don't push it because guess what you are no match for their intellectualism because the true revelation of christ is of the heart not of the mind you can have somebody who who doesn't know two plus two who can't figure out complex things or or can't do anything like that can't can't even explain to you the serpent seed and they can be so full of christ you wouldn't hardly believe it because it's not about what you know in your head it's about what you know in your heart a spoken word in your life is an expression of eternity the re because a man came up with man came up with the idea to play the tape for church and push out the five-fold ministry that was man's idea can you find me a place in the bible oh i can find you a quote okay take that quote through the entire message and then through the bible oh we don't need the bible anymore what wow okay well we can get in the weeds and i'm preaching to the choir praise the lord it stops the moving on of the word of god and that's that's what i was trying to to stick my what's on my heart tonight is that is that an idea not coming from eternity a revelation not of god will come to an end but a revelation expressed a spoken word expressed from eternity will continue to move with the word of god you can't sit in a church just listening to a tape and move on with god it won't happen praise the lord bill abraham says here in this quote he says now remember every spoken word of god is the original seed really this is the prophet speaking he says every spoken word of god is the original seed now i'm gonna blunder here okay well i can't find it i fail praise the lord but he won't he'll fill in the gaps for me every spoken word of god is the original seed there's given forth teachers apostles and prophets the fivefold ministry that's in the bible ephesians oh that's because i'm in corinthians ha ha ephesians see told you he'd fill in the gaps he's faithful praise lord and he gave some ephesians 4 11 he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ every spoken word of god is the original seed look it lines up with both right god planted everything in the earth by his word and as long as you stay with the original seed it will breed itself right back and reproduce itself again hybrid it it dies see it's all the unspoken in that quote it's between the lines he says every spoken word of god is the original seed what is your life the spoken word of god everything in the earth by his word god planted the message of the hour has been planted as long as you stay with the original seed it will beat itself right back what is the original seed it is the the word of god the bible the message of the hour both together producing within you life an expression of eternity so a hybrid seed is death death not maybe suddenly maybe slow a hybrid seed and idea like that is serpent seed an idea of man is serpency it's finite nothing spoken of god ends nothing spoken of god ends the spoken word in your life will not end your flesh guess what what is your flesh your flesh is an idea of man they say oh but god created all man yes he did but your flesh was in an idea of man in the garden of eden the serpent said oh but did he really mean it what happened took one word replaced one word brought death now there's a separation between your flesh and god because it's the inside of you that keeps the flesh on the outside subject to the word of god without that you would not be able to control the lusts of the flesh but it is christ in you but what happened why do you have to deal with that because of a hybrid idea see what is hybrid hybrid is partial truth see the devil used through the serpent he used the bible if you will the word of god to bring up his idea for eve to partake of the fruit he didn't go out somewhere into some book in some denomination and bring up an idea no he pulled the idea from the word and eve fornicated what do you do when you accept man's idea it's fornication the the word of the the brother man says god looks upon denominations as a man making love to a dead court to a corpse you think that's just for denomination that's for in this message you see someone playing with an idea that is from man who's feeding on that who's entertaining that who's preaching that who's caught up in that it's no different than the the denominations a man making love with a corpse you know how gross that is i don't need to go into details what is it it's finite it's lack of revelation this thing it's a dead end a spoken word is a thought expressed so someone begins to to tell you we had a pastor and i won't use his name but you most of you know who he is and he begins to say he he sits down with another pastor in the message and then and there they they argue for for an hour or more because this one man's decided he's going to leave the message because none of that do you think that happened in a week well he confessed two years two years all because someone planted a seed back who knows when and that sea took a hold you say whoa whoa then he doesn't have the gold holy ghost well we don't know what he has or what he doesn't have but christ doesn't speak against christ christ doesn't deny christ and a wound sealed by the holy spirit with the seed of god can accept no other idea no other seed and that right there is a perfect expression of eternity before the foundation of the world god had a message in his mind and we listen to it on tape and we preach it over the pulpit in church whether i read it from the bible or i read it from the table that was god's desire we talk about how oh each one of us it was in the mind of god before the foundation of the world but guess what even this word was in the mind of god before the foundation of the world and when he expressed that spoken word it can't ever fail you are god's thought expressed next time you're having a bad day and the devil's telling you you ain't worth nothing you tell them i'm sorry i'm a thought of god expressed because you are and there's no dead end when you're a thought of god expressed why because you are the spoken word because you are the original seed you see you couldn't receive a seed from that's why it says god has no grandchildren you have to receive the original seed you have to receive the seed that comes from the spoken word of god that's why when a man tells you something about the bible that doesn't line up with the word there'll be nothing in it for you no life in it for you just death christ spoke you into existence before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou came us forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations praise the lord there's one word and we've said it many times is the seed right you are part of christ amen god is eternal which would mean god's thoughts are eternal you are part of god's thoughts so you are eternal not your flesh because your flesh is in the thought of god your spirit your soul is eternal if you've accepted christ and you're sealed by christ you cannot die you cannot come to a dead end because you are an expression of eternity christ's spoken word is the original seed amen that message is more than a title i jumped ahead of my slides praise the lord so what is the message is it just words on a page is it a man's idea acts 5 35 to 39 says and said unto them gamaliel speaking he says you men of israel take heed to yourselves what she intended to do as touching these men for before these days rose up theodos boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about 400 joined themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to naught after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the taxing and drew away much people after him he also perished and all even as many as obeyed him were dispersed and now i say unto you refrain from these men and let them alone for if this council or this work be of men it will come to not but if it be of god you cannot overthrow it lest happily ye be found even to fight against god praise the lord if you add one word it's hybrid remove one word it's hybrid because god's word is eternal it has to be complete there is nothing missing from god's word there is nothing that needs to be removed there's not too much of god's word because god is eternal everything about him is eternal so he knows the end from the beginning because from his viewpoint there is no end or beginning so he has to in order to be eternal in order to be god he has to know everything so his word then has to be fit and complete to handle everything if you have a question where are you going to find the answer in the word you say but i haven't and i've been looking and i've been looking and i've been looking god is faithful and he will answer that question even if it's on the other side we are not called to find the answer to every question you see what happened with that pastor he set out to answer questions that didn't need an answer and doubt when doubt began to breed you know what breeds doubt pushing to find the answer through your own strength pushing to find an answer because guess what we as humans we got to know right why do you think everyone googles everything you gotta know what happened to the days before google right we just sat around for an hour discussing whether or not this was true not this but something was true you know yeah so i heard the other day you know a giraffe can't lick its elbow or it's it's kneecap and that was really random okay you can't lick your elbow right so what does everyone do everyone tries it oh yeah i don't think that works yeah maybe that doesn't work maybe there's some people that can do it nowadays like you can't lick your elbow nope i can't watch some cat on youtube try to do it that's the age that we live in the age of information instantly why do you think what do you think that's the case because the devil knows that's not how god works how long did it take abraham to get the promised son who which was what the spoken word right 25 plus years when he was called of god he was already 70. any all been alive for 70 years yet no so you you you wouldn't even reach the point for god to call you if you was abraham yet oh it's been a week and my package hasn't arrived me and we were yeah we were just talking about that the other day me and isaac you know you back in the day it was like three weeks right okay that's fine yeah wow it's only three weeks now it's like it's been two days where's my package or you go you gotta buy something that's not on amazon it's some other private website and it's like you know five to seven business days like oh my goodness is it on amazon i need it tomorrow right and then you see the list it's like expedite you know it's like going to a car wash it just progresses and gets more expensive but just by small increments and you're you're like it's seven days right and you're like if i can have that tomorrow for an extra thirty dollars because you can't wait to get it and that's what we have today is a bunch of impatient people because the society breeds that in them as a software engineer we also dabble in designing i mean because it's part of our job designing websites that hold your attention the average the the the time span that we have on a page and i'm i'm i'm pulling from memory here so i may be wrong to catch your attention is like 0.7 seconds before you swipe and move on fast everything is fast you can never disconnect what is that it's distraction con i'm going somewhere that's constant bombardment caught constant distractions from the opposite of truth not all of it's bad it's just not life right and so you have these distractions and so then when it comes time and god's trying to move people are sitting there like why is a song leader leading songs longer than 30 minutes or why isn't he leading only 15 minutes why is the preacher preaching so long why is the preacher preaching so short shut up and sit down god's trying to tell you something we get so impatient we need to have it now guess what that's what abraham wanted and what did him wanting to have him and sarah wanted to have it now bring ishmael even that picture just makes you think of war and persecution oops i went too far so abraham and sarah added one word with hagar who was an egyptian right which what is egypt the type of the world so it was a it was coming from man abraham and sarah said oh i know how we can make the word come to pass put together a horse and a donkey sarah's like i need this promised son it's been too long there's absolutely no way whatsoever that god's work can come to pass whoa that's not what she said but that's what she believed god's word when you go when you go ahead and you don't wait for the russell and the mulberry trees you're saying god's not good enough to keep his word when you say when you try to step forward and hurry up and get done in your time you're saying god's word isn't good enough but none of you would say that to my face oh sorry no god's worth isn't good enough but your actions are an expression of your heart your words are an expression of your thoughts your thoughts come from your heart so because abraham and sarah jumped the gun and they went excuse me they went ahead and did their own thing and brought forth ishmael who continues to bring death but then three men walked out of the desert one day as abraham was sitting in the door of the tent in the heat of the day and here steps out three men two angels and one was elohim abraham recognizing him runs and says you know prepare a feast he gets a he gets a a lamb i think or something or calf or it prepares a feast for them please sit down and eat my lord right he recognizes the difference between the two angels and god elohim and elohim begins to speak to him elohim begins to express his thoughts to him because a word is a thought expressed and he says abraham i will visit you according to the time of life now sarah being weak in the flesh inside the tent yet covered by abraham laughs in her heart says how can that be i me being old can i have pleasure with my lord after all these years and then the elohim with his back to the tent says why did sarah laugh sarah comes out says she denies it he says i will visit you according to the time of life he spoke the word god had been saying to abraham for years you will have a promise you will have a son you he he says your your your seed will be as the sand on the sea and as the stars in the sky i will make a nation out of you abraham but then god came down in flesh i'm not making this stuff up this is right in your bible god came down in flesh and spoke the word christ in the midst god came down with a message for us through the mouthpiece of a man brought to us the message now the message has continued because it's the spoken word of god because it came from god the thoughts the words expressed it was an expression of eternity brought forth the spoken word now that spoken word is in us guess what we can't just listen to the tapes because the spirit of god the spoken word is moving forward sitting down and listening to i'm talking about in church listening to a tape in church isn't moving forward with christ that keeps going over dead i'm just hoping you're all tired and inside you're going amen amen amen and it will bring forth death but the spoken word of god i will visit you according to the time of life brought forth the promised son you see there's one thing about the spoken word of god and it is truth and the bible says the truth shall set you free and there's one other promise and i i'm not taking too much time tonight oops i don't have my watch over here praise the lord there's one more promise in the word of god that says he who began this work in you will finish it will not maybe not hopefully will finish it they say how how can that how can that happen how can how can this come to oh how can how can god finish this work because he spoke it you see that's why it's so important that you feed on the word of god because that word of god is pulling you along it's pulling you along you have a destination you have a you have a place to go you have a ticket you have to get to the railway station and you have to get on the train and that is what's going to bring you to your husband what is that ticket it's the seed say oh you're pregnant yes please get on the train that's what it is god looking to identify himself in you because your life who you are is an expression of eternity and the reason that i can say that is because it's god's spoken word i feel like we're going back and forth that's the message that's the word of god right big eight eternity it never ends it keeps on going keeps on going you can read the same scripture today that you read yesterday and it means more or something different now it always lines up with the word it continues to to to expound you need genesis now next time you read genesis you know the earth was without form and void you're going to think oh i'm like the earth i was without form and void before god came along and shined his light upon you but see that was that was your destination with eternity is that god will come along and express himself in you so you could overcome this world because you cannot do that on your own god always keeps his promises and one of his promises is that you will overcome the position's going to come tonight it was chopped up i hope that the lord spoke to your heart and that praise the lord you god will finish the work that he started in you because you are the spoken word that's really what it comes down to um something we know it's not a great well it's not great in the eyes of man but god works in simplicity isn't that right they say oh brother chris preached tonight he only preached 45 minutes i don't know if god can move in that much time one word two words god can change a life because it's not i was in the back i was praying but i no amount of words i could put on a page can change anybody in the congregation it takes christ to change you and it takes you to yield to christ praise the lord you love him
