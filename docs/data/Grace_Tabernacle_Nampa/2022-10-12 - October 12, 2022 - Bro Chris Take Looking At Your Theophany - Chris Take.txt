bless you let's sing as we turn the service brother Chris is he's going to come number 903 came to me amen the gulf that separated me from Christ my Lord it was so vast The Crossing eye could never fall from where I was to his demands it seemed so far I cry dear Lord I cannot come to where you are [Music] he came to me aren't you glad he came to me when I could not come to where he was he came to me and that's why he died on Calvary when I could not come to where he was he came to me he came to me when I was bound in Chains of my sins he came to me when I possessed no hope within they picked me up and Drew Me Gently to his side where today in his sweet love I now above God he came to me [Applause] when I could not come to where he was he came to me and that's why he died [Music] when I could not come to where he was he came to me he came to me he came to me when I could not come to where he was he came to me and that's why he died [Music] when I could not come to where he was he came to amen good to be in your in the presence of the Lord tonight to be in the house of God we're going to take the Liberty to bring greetings from Brother Stephen Coffey and his assembly there tonight from them didn't tell me exactly but um we uh I'm going to bring that to you so amen if you have your Bibles you want to stand tonight we will get into the word this evening sing that song he came to me but around says that he came down and became us so that we could become him you see sometimes we think I don't say this in an arrogant Spirit but we think to live a little of Who We Are the devil wants to put you down and make you feel small and insignificant which you are in the right attitude when you see God and who he is and how he is desired desire to express himself in you you feel you are humble but you are confident and the power that he has given you as Sons and Daughters of God Amen Psalms chapter 116. looks like you already saw my um title tonight but um it's looking at your theophany Psalms 116 verse 9 Psalms 116 verse 9. I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living I believed therefore have I spoken I was greatly afflicted Paul takes the Liberty to cut that scripture in half and he says I believed therefore have I spoken second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 1. second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 1. I walked before I will walk by back in Psalms here I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living we we move from the Land of the Dead into the land of the living though we walk through the Land of the Dead it's the Paradox of the Christian Life second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 1. quite a few verses to read here but you'll be seated and you'll get to set the remainder of the service so II Corinthians chapter four therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received Mercy we think not you have this ministry but you have mercy and you faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully don't use it to your own gain but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves ourselves to Every Man's conscience in the sight of God but if our gospel behind it is hid to them that are lost let me tell you the truth will never be hidden if you find a gospel that's hidden it's a gospel that is not full truth because the devil likes to sneak around and to hide but the Gospel of Truth cannot be hidden you try to hide your life if you're living for Christ people are still going to see it and they're going to recognize that but if our gospel beheaded is hid to them that are lost to whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves for your servants for Jesus sake so they see the gospel but they don't understand it that's right I realized what I said kind of sounded like contradictory with what we were reading so to clarify they see the gospel in you they see your life as different and it bothers them it irritates them some of them but because they don't see the truth they don't catch a revelation of the truth for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in Earthen vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we're actually going to pause there say a word of prayer and have your seats Heavenly Father Lord Jesus father I pray tonight nothing would be held back for Jesus but father as a as a as a man here I would I desire to give 110 into you father that you would come and you would speak Lord father May the barrier when we break down the barriers of unbelief Lord may you break down the barriers of sin Lord father may you break down the barriers of of preconceived ideas Lord break down the barriers of bias that are within us Lord that we would come and we could hear with you with pure unadulterated hearts Lord I pray you'd speak to us Lord that your word would revive within us Lord pull us from the Earthly and into the Heavenly tonight god father for this world that we live in is Satan's Eden God we're going to claim it back one of these days but as right now it's Satan's eating we don't want to get caught in it father but we want to step into the next Dimension Lord father though we live and then we walk through here father May our lives and our thoughts beyond the glory Lord we love you father we thank you speak to us tonight father have your way may there be no personal opinions father contrary to your word but it'd be your pure word spoken lest our pastor and his wife Lord tonight give him strength in their bodies you pray in Jesus name amen you may be seated so the title tonight like I mentioned already looking at your theophany let's pick back up here in second Corinthians 4 where in verse 7 says but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that's the Excellency of the power may it be of God and not of us see we don't just want anointing anointing is anointing of God is good but it's not just the anointing it's the combination of the anointing and the word you go too far into just the the the the the the scriptures and the quotes you go too far that way it becomes intellectual and you leave the spirit of Christ you go too far into the anointing you leave the spirit of Christ where you want is you want right in the middle where you have the word and the anointing because that's my brother preached the sermon anointed ones at the end time so so we have so the power may be of God and not of us so who why God chose Earth and vessels why he chose us to to express himself through us to express to who he is in US you see he's expressing himself out through us but at the same time showing us through that expression who we are sometimes we say things and we do things and we go wow what in the world was that god pushing out his life within us so tonight that's what we want to look at looking at your theophany we looking at our theophany but Christ looking at your theophany we are trouble on every side verse 8 yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body how does that work the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life of the Lord Jesus would be mid manifest in our body but the Bible says the seed has to die and rot to bring forth life we're going to look at that for we which live are all we delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh unbelievable that God would use this mortal flesh to manifest himself but yet he's doing it he's showing the power of Christ you say why wouldn't he why wouldn't he make the why wouldn't he just when he changed us why wouldn't he resurrect the flesh as well because he wants his power on display every day he wants to say and look say see what the power of Christ within that Earthen vessel that Rotting Flesh look what it can do it can bring it under subjection to the word of God that's why he dealt the way he did with job that's right that's right so then death worketh in us but life in you we having the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believe we just read this I believed and therefore have I spoken he says we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many redowned to the glory of God for which cars we think not but though our outward man perished yet the inward man is renewed day by day see the flesh is rotting every day it's getting older it's rotting but why because there's something inside that needs that flesh to rot to bring forth that life within us knowing that he would okay for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory you see the seed in the ground was crying out because he was rotting and dying away but it was birth pains and listening to the tape birth pain it was the birth pains you say why a birthday you think about oh the bringing force of life every time there's a bringing forth of life there's pain involved in that when a baby is born there's great pain involved in that so God had women do it not men because there would be no babies there's great pain when the seed is dying and it's rotting away but what is that that doing the very I mean all of creation right now is dying okay let's also work with me here we don't know what's happening we've never seen fall before and everything's dying Brother David you're going to go out there and you're going to start dumping fertilizer on your trees Jason's going to go be trimming the dead Limbs and he's just going to keep on trimming until there's just a stump because you've never seen fall before okay so you're wondering what's going on what's Happening everything's dying all around you you've never seen fall before but then someone comes along with a Farmer's Almanac oh I don't know what he was some book and says no no stop stop cutting off those branches you think are dead stop stop denying that in your life that you don't understand this is fall and what's happening is everything is dying and going back into the ground because spring winter is coming and when there's a time of harsh weather and it's cold and if the sap of the tree was in the tree the tree would die but the trees going down the the flowers the the bulbs you know the Tulips and stuff the bulb that all the whole plant dies it goes away but the bulb is there down inside the Earth because there's coming a resurrection so you go through winter University Winter before and you're like wow what's going to happen this is it but this is just our life now but then something begins to happen it begins to warm up life begins to start to come and now you see the same thing that died resurrecting itself coming back new life why it had to die and go down to preserve life to bring life again at the appointed season so those same thing the word went down in the Dark Ages as we know to preserve the life so that the life could be born again renewed a seed was planted you planted some uh what is is it onions or garlic you plant in the fall and it comes next spring I think or something like that there are things you plant in the fall that that that that need to be planted at that time of season to bring forth to life later on but that seed had to go down in the ground the seed from the beginning from Pentecost had to be planted so that therefore to bring forth the life from within the seed the seed had to rot and to die amen so um sorry I don't mean to amend myself and me Manning the word I'm reading for our light Affliction which is but for a moment Verse 18 while we took not at look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen he's picking up his message coming up in Hebrews Paul is for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal in other words what you see and what you call real isn't but the things that are not seen are real and eternal for we know we're in chapter five for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle be dissolved rotted and dead we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens this flesh was made with hands that you're sitting in tonight that you prettied up and fancied up and handsomed up before church it's made with hands if you will you understand God created life but it comes through the fall so we have to this this is going to be laid down and the Tabernacle dissolve so that we may step into the building of God that's Eternal for in this we groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven that's your theophany that's those scripts right there talking about your theophany so we're groaning our bodies are groaning as they age and as they get older and as they rot away they're groaning Desiring because we were not designed we were not this is not what God had in mind if you understand what I'm saying this is not the end see you see every time you see death it's testifying of life every time you see something going down and getting old it's testifying a resurrection why because for every for every opposite for every fake there's a real this expression God showing time and time again that hey look what I desire is that in the fall it would go down but there would be a resurrection he's Desiring an eternal spring an eternal Summer oh God expressing himself to us throughout eternity now in the message who is this Melchizedek says you were there in his attributes you don't remember it no because you're just a part of his life you're a part of God when you become a son or a daughter of God now let me let me just pause there for a second he says you are there in his attributes let me tell you you are an attribute of God Amen amen we talk about the attributes of God and we say you know God had the attribute of healer that he desired to express so he allowed the Fall In the Garden of Eden so that people could be sick so he could well the eventual plan was Redemption but Desiring people would be sick so that he could come and heal them so that's why he come and and he's walking on the shores of Galilee as Jesus he's not hanging out with the Pharisees of the people who don't need him he's going and talking to the prostitute at the well and Samaria Samaria Samaria because he came for those who needed him you see what all men need him yes but he came for those with the desire for him and why do you have that desire you have that desire for him because of predestination because there's a seed in your heart there's a seed in your life so you are an attribute so no different than he had the desire to express his healer he had the desire to express you amen he had a desire to express you today 2000 and 20 and 22. you were born when you were born and that was the time God desired to express you out so let me if you are an attribute of God God's attributes are eternal amen God's thoughts are Eternal it wasn't that that he had a thought I don't have a paper here we go it wasn't that he had a thought and he said oh yeah that's a good idea you wrote it down that would be a beginning but the thoughts that he had of a Healer the thoughts that he had for brother Jason never started because he's Eternal his thoughts are eternal so if you're from eternity because you're an attribute of God you only have one destination and that's back to Eternity back to Eternity what is redeemed taken back that is what redeemed means it is not that God said oh you know I'm going to decide to to choose you Sean and so I'm going to change you no he's taking you back he came and he said now it's time for you to recognize who you are I'm going to show you I'm going to identify myself in you through the expression of my attributes I'm going to identify myself with you by expressing who I am to you so that you can see who you really are you begin to see something let me tell you you know your spirit remembers eternity your soul remembers eternity your soul remembers sitting there with Papa God on the side of the of the bench your soul remembers living in glory without a robe of Flesh your soul remembers and when God came along and he found you because you didn't find God God found you when he came along and he began to speak to you your soul was quick and wide because you remembered eternity something in your soul begin to stir because you recognize you begin to realize I forgot about this Amnesia you had Amnesia see whether I preaching that message about spiritual Amnesia why is it Amnesia and why is it not some other context of of you discovered this cool thing no it's Amnesia because it's already Who You Are do you see the Eternal quality that you have as a son and daughter of God you say oh but I failed or I haven't done this or I haven't done that yet it doesn't matter because there's something in your heart that keeps pushing Back Against The Darkness the light came and the Darkness comprehended it not but that did that stop the light no the light pushed back the dark just as you are a part of your Earthly father that's right you are the male carries the hemoglobin the blood and when that has gone in the egg then you become of your part of your father and your mother is a part of your father also so you're all a part of your father Glory that's that lets denominations out all together he says notice now in notice now his attribute then the attribute was first God the thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed logos then when he expressed secondarily he became then the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us you see he had a thought to step down into a robe of Flesh to be your Kinsmen Redeemer and that thought came to pass one day when he expressed the word and he said Mary why did the angel come down and give verbal message to Mary when he when when the angel Gabriel was if it was Gabriel was speaking to Mary and saying thou are highly favored among men the word if you could see if you could put on your spiritual glasses and look the word was coming forth on that message and going right into the womb of Mary and begin to create begin to move inside of her and when she said be it unto me according to your word the spirit quickened what was inside of her when God when her faith connected with her identity it brought forth life in there and that life began to grow right then and there that cell to start to build upon cell was quickened inside of her womb the spoken word coming forth amen now who is this because I'm gonna quote from who is this Melchizedek many times I recommend you go listen to who is this Melchizedek and identification uh the first identification I think it is but look when those when this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you it knows this body excuse me it throws this body in subjection to God let me read that again when this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to God he that's born of God does not commit sin he cannot sin Romans 8 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there you are see that throws your body subject now watch then after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food sorry I I just realized I had some notes missing so let me pause before I read that quote Revelation brings recognition amen recognition brings identification identification brings more Revelation it's one big circle saints of God it's one big circle as you catch the Revelation you recognize Who You Are and then recognizing who you are you become identified with the word of God and when you become identified with the word of God more Revelation breeds upon that when Revelation moves upon that because you say well if that's it then this is it and this is it and this is it and God begins to bring you see why it's so important that you feed on the word of God Amen it can never be overemphasized you gotta feed on the word of God if now this is hard for some people to accept I don't want to say sound negative when I say that let me put it this way you have to feed on the word amen when you're not feeding on the word daily you miss listen the battle is really hot in laodicea it's hotter than it was in time past that's biblical so now 50 years ago wow well I can't say 50 years ago 500 years ago the battle was such that sanctification was enough but today the battle is such that you need everything you need the whole complete revelation of Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of Christ right you need all of it so now before just as a metaphor maybe you could miss a day or two of devotions and be okay this is Brother Chris's personal opinion but I believe it's backed by the word you miss one day In the Heat of the battle right now in this day and age that we live in and you're going to begin to struggle it's that important I I I maybe I shouldn't say this so take over the grain of salt but test it out don't don't test it out but next time you find yourself struggling going man what's wrong with me it doesn't have to be it could just be depression ask yourself when's us if you had devotions not read your Bible devotions and you'll find many times it's been too long because when you're not feeding on the word your body always feeds it never stops feeding your body always feeds physically your body always feeds if it's not eating if you're not eating food it's taking the energy stored in your body spiritually is the same way your body's constantly feeding so if you're not but giving it the word of God and even storing up reserves of the word of God riding on the table of your heart you're going to begin to feed on the world you're going to begin to feed on your own ideas and it might be something simple that's not a big deal yet but baby amalekites grow up to be big amalekites so it's very very important that we feed that we prepare ourselves for battle and even even just change the way you approach your devotions in the morning which I hope you have uh I hope you have a rhythm or a you know a part of your morning routine where you spend time with God I would believe that we all have come to a position now in maturity where we realize that we need that part of our morning if it's not part of your morning I challenge you get up earlier so um well I don't remember what it's going to say so we'll just we'll move forward so then after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food then you left the other thing you you have then been formed into the living image of the Living God you heard from your theophany this is not just allegory and nice words you heard from your theophany why what was that your theophany is the word of God Amen the word of God spoke to you your soul remembered eternity and that the often began to speak to you Gabriella begin to say you are better than this you are better than the situation and Life begin to grow inside of you you see but you got to just like Mary you have to accept it and said be with me no matter how hard it is you have to accept it the living image of the Living God you heard from your theophany if this Earthly body be dissolved so now um God another quote here God vindicates that that's always been right God vindicates it to be true so playing the predestinated is the only ones that's considered in Redemption did you get it let me say that again the predestinate is the only one that's considered in Redemption okay praise the Lord the next paragraph 117 being Eternal with him at the beginning the eternal life that you had being Eternal with him you think you think sometimes well we need to preach against split skirts and high heels we do those things have to be said but if we can preach I'm not condemning preaching that so we have to be blunt if you but you see brother man I'm focused his focus wasn't on that he hid it but his Focus was not his focus on was on recognizing Who You Are that was his message revelation of Who You Are which is an expression of Christ so being Eternal with him at the beginning the eternal life that you had his thought of what you was only he wanted he wanted me to stand in the pope you see so God had a thought of what he wanted you to do Sean he wanted you to stand in line at Chick-fil-A and take sandwich orders he had an Express a thought that he wanted you to lay he had he has your life laid out Sean you can't mess it up he has it laid out in front of you you really don't have a say but in your heart you don't desire anything else that's predestination so he said only he wanted he wanted me to stand in the Pulpit he wanted you to sit in the seat tonight you are right now fulfilling the will of God so if you've been concerned that you're out of the will of God tonight you are in the will of God then we are serving his eternal purpose so he has an eternal purpose for your life and you are playing it out not like a robot but for Destination is he saw foreknowledge he saw that you would have the desire to serve him he saw that you had the desire for the birthright so you are playing out what he saw because he saw it try to wrap your head around that and the one that left home only come to the Earth to serve his purpose the body the flesh to serve his purpose is that right all right then after it's finished it's brought back in a glorified State it's matured and brought back again now remember we talked about the seed why do not just bear with me why did we have to bypass our theophany wouldn't that wouldn't it have been better for us to just step from glory to glory and skip the in between wouldn't have been better that way the thing is you had to come and take on a robe of Flesh that's right so that God could be glorified and that same flesh that's glorifying God by being under subjection to his word is rotting and dying to bring forth life some of the some some of our loved ones have passed on into Glory but they're going to come and that body is going to resurrect into their theophy they're going to come down and they're going to resurrect are this flesh we have to be in this flesh just like the seed has to go in the ground and rot this flesh has to it's rotten right now this flesh is rotten no good but it's not just a byproduct of the Fall it's God's purpose so that it can bring forth the Life of Christ that's God's Redemption plan right there so he he says and then after it's finished it's broadcast now it's matured the seed will never mature into the plant another mature into the wheatless it first goes in the ground and rots and bring forth life so if you just step from glory to glory there'd be no maturity there'd be no expression but you see that life is forming and now because you take your character with you your character is who your spirit man the soul excuse me your soul is your character is what molded into your soul and your soul then steps into the glorified body and that glorified body amen lines up perfectly with the soul the spirit of Christ within you and now the whole thing is complete now it's a mature plant and now you can stand in glory because you can never stand in glory in this rotten flesh praise the Lord so God okay praise the Lord um then he was Christ has revealed in his own word 1965. then he was made actually human flesh and dwelled Among Us in the person of Jesus Christ himself born of the Virgin Mary he come in that form so he could die and went back into heaven now in this last day he has promised to manifest himself in the fullness again of his flesh in spirit see so he came to die and resurrect and then he says now in this last day he has promised to manifest himself in the fullness again death burial Resurrection the fullness again if you are God you are God in flesh you're going to mimic Christ but you could not do it until he first came and broke the last barrier of death now you have this you have the ability through his anointing because he's paid the price for you to complete the picture Death burial Resurrection all three of these so he came the Flesh and the spirit for as it was in the days of solemn so shall be in the coming of the son of man now look at the Sodom how it's set and what taking place and Jesus Christ being manifested in bodily form of his church today see doing the same thing same work same things that he did all the time never changes the Eternal one so if he came to die you came to die too amen you stepped out of Glory To Die see and upon Earth today he was manifested himself in the human bodies Our human body is that he has called and done exactly the same thing that he'd done thing he done in Sundry times in the times of his flesh upon Earth so he's doing the same thing today now per gift 142 the next now the next thing happens is when it's all gathered up into that one person Jesus Christ bride and body at the physical Return of the Lord Jesus trying to get to the part I want I want to read and the the woman and man is just so close together uh next next next yes and the woman and the man and man is just so close together tell they're just almost they are the same next time someone tells you how dare you say your God and flesh this quote was also in 1965. so for all those naysayers that say Well it has to be after 63. he says they are the same they ought to be anyhow there they are see they just exactly manifested the same she is a part of him because she was taken out from him you see who what was that what was the representation of of our relationship with Christ Adam and Eve Eve was taken from Adam you are a actual part of Christ for Christ for for us to get to the end of this whole thing and you do not be there if you're a son or daughter of God and you would not be there which you just keep believing you are it wouldn't be complete we'd get there and God would be incomplete if you will he'd be missing an arm because she was taken out from him and the bride today is taken out from the body of Christ which is acting and doing just exactly like he said it would do for this day the bride the Queen the king and the Queen so he had to come Christ had to come down and a robe of Flesh to die just like the seed has to die okay we have to come down and bypass our theophany so that the Life of Christ could be born in us through the death and rotting of our flesh but it would have it would end there if because we without Christ have no victory over death but he came before us and he took the Stinger from death so all this time so no I hope I by God's grace you understand so all this time you're walking in flesh and you're and you're living in this robe of Flesh and and God's done redemption in your life and you are serving God and you look at this well I'm mad at my wife again well I growing up for every reason it was always you know the preacher always said kick the dog so I just automatically use that example oh I kicked the dog again I don't know where that came from don't kick it I did it again I stuck my foot in my mouth or or I did something I shouldn't have there's something wrong I did I did it again you're looking at the flesh now do you want me to tell you what God's looking at all this time he isn't looking at you in your flesh because he doesn't know your flesh if you will the way a husband and wife know each other it's not your flesh that God knows God doesn't know your flesh that's right you say but but I did this God said I don't see it God has a forgetting problem every time you put something out of the blood he forgets it that's that's truth 100 percent God does the all-knowing omniscient all-power for God doesn't remember your sin amen he doesn't remember it you remember it the devil remembers it but God does not remember it also the devil is not all-knowing just so you know and he can't read your mind don't give the devil too much power amen all this time God isn't looking at you in your flesh he is looking at your theophany amen because that's who you really are that's exactly because your theophany is a representation of Christ within you amen this flesh contradicts the spirit of Christ inside of you but your theophany is a perfect representation of the spirit of Christ inside of you every day you see this flesh come underneath subjection to the word of God because God's word is that powerful because he created all things and all things are underneath his subjection but God doesn't look at your flesh God looks at your theophany if you're under the blood you still have your part to play repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit you still have your part to play but you will play it you will play it he is looking at your theophany who you really are which is the word of God expressed his attribute you see saying to God the power that God has put within us the power that God has expressed to us we are literally a part of Eternity amen this this finite Minds Can't Wrap our heads around that and I might sound contradicting but you don't need to figure it out stop trying to figure out God I've I've counseled with with with different people about all the questions that they have and it's like look stop questioning and just accept it when I was growing up I I I math was hard I I wanted to know why now down the line I realize why God made me that way but I wanted to know why why why why why and I was like I was told look and there's an element of proof to this look don't worry about why just do the formula and you'll get the right answer you see God has a formula now you know in in uh in programming we can do we can do we can get the same result a lot of different ways but there's only one or there's only there's but there's a right way to do it and put let me put make it simple put it that way there's many ways to do things to make what you see as the client when you open the application on the web and to see it you'll see the same thing but I did it wrong so it won't last it'll break it might be good for a little bit but then it breaks might be good for a little bit then it breaks see that's what people in their life they try to to manufacture of being a Christian some of you sitting here tonight might be trying to do that manufacturing being Christian you wonder why all it's just a struggle and how do people live this life look what you have to do is die die you have to die and you got to say look it can be as simple as this look I don't understand how this works Lord um but I want to serve you and that's it and then you just spoke the word maybe your life isn't lining up with the word at the time but speak the word maybe you are keep losing the victory with the sand or something in your life or anger in your life or something you keep losing the victory just start speaking the word don't focus on your problem focus on the one with the solution don't focus on it don't don't even try let me say something that might sound a bit radical don't even try to change yourself don't even try to stop lusting or stop smoking or whatever whatever it is stop getting having a taper don't try don't put your energy in stopping that instead put more time and energy into God's word when you go to open your Bible if you've got to sit in your life that's that's condemning you've got something in your life that's condemning you um maybe you didn't have the courage to make to go to go repent about it yet just and and just open the word and start to read and the devil's going to come and say how dare you read the scriptures with this thing in your life he's going to be whispering in your ear but guess what when the devil's talking it's because he's scared that's right he doesn't bother he didn't bother when you're doing exactly what he wants you to do he's like that boss I never tells you when you're doing good or that sounds weird but he's like that boss that never tells you hey you're doing a good job all you ever hear is when you're doing bad same thing all time the only time that I've ever talks to you I mean it's the opposite is when you're doing good he wants to tell you how you know how dare you and you put on a tape and you begin to feel condemned and you begin to feel all these things but let me tell you something this word the word of God and the messages are on the tapes are not just words there's life in them do you know why do you know why because they're God's thoughts that's right this book if you will is no different than you know the words in this book if you all know different in the words on this page Naturally Speaking but these words aren't God's thoughts these are God's thoughts have creative power there's something going on in your home and I challenge you to do this maybe you'll see the effects right away it might take time but I challenge you to find a scripture in your Bible that represents the opposite of what your house is doing and every morning get up for anyone else is up and out loud read the scripture amen don't don't try to you know grab the wall we rebuke you Satan no just speak the word amen say and maybe it's just you in your room maybe you're a young person in your room there's something you're struggling with walk in your room tonight shut the door and don't say I rebuke you no there's a time for that but don't do that find a scripture in your Bible that speaks Victory to your atmosphere and create that atmosphere but guess what as soon as you start to do that the devil is going to come with a couple other Buddies so you got to do it again the next day and again the next day and again the next day and next thing that you know you're going to be walking in Victory and you're going to look and say wow I don't have chains rattling on my feet anymore well I haven't even thought about wanting to do that thing or go to that website I haven't even considered that why because the atmosphere that you're living in has been regenerated by the power of Christ you had that ability to say to God you had that ability it's not so much although those services are good and you are and things are delivered but it's more take the word home and put it to use take the word tonight what's been spoken don't leave the anointing here in the building don't leave what's been said here for brother Chris to take home and and think about how he could have said it better take the word of God the quotes the spoken and go and do what it says to do the word on tape play it in your house I don't care if you feel anointed I don't care what the situation is put the tape on and play it every day keep on playing keep on playing it I know someone who was struggling with depression and guilt feelings of guilt even though it was all taken care of and under the blood the devil was coming and reminding them and I said you know what you need to do start playing the tapes start playing the good worship music start reading the Bible and you know what that person is so happy so free and so light today why because the word began to create an atmosphere I can't come home with you and do it for you amen I have my own house to take care of my own house to take care of every man is responsible for what's in his condition responsible for his condition of his house maybe you you know a young person again and there's something in your house that's getting the victory over the soul there's a scripture in Joshua that says as for me and my house we will serve the Lord we hang that on the picture nice in our homes guess what that applies to your fleshly house as well that could be your scripture that can be your scripture remind yourself of that scripture put it on a little index card laminated and put it in your pocket and when you're at work and you touch it you remember as for me and my house we served like this stuff is not denominational ideas this is putting the word of God in action and sometimes this is the kind of preaching that we need more of is God is it Brother David and brother Paul preaching and we're getting the word of God to put into action I don't want you to leave tonight and be like what do we talk about what did we do I felt really good but what do I do what do I do now there is practical applications that you can start tonight it's your house in your life that God and watch God begin to give you Victory give me victory over bitterness give you victory over unforgiveness give you the ability to say whether that person has treated you any other way it does not matter to you you've forgiven them and you pray that God one day that they hear from their theophany amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Lord we want to remember we're going to go from here in this this building this this church we come and we sit in a certain triggers in our brain and different things but at the same time this is what you called us to you called us to be here it might feel like a habit sometimes but there's something in us that desires more it might be the same scriptures but it's the Living Word of God Lord I pray that they wouldn't we wouldn't leave the word here tonight but we would take it home with us Lord this day this scripture is fulfilled we are the completion of you yes and that's been fulfilled today in our lives Lord I just pray you bring energy and strength to your people tonight father those that are struggling for the for we all have times in our life we struggle with different things father our flesh in the way but I pray but that's one thing Lord but the the other side of it is Habitual sin I pray God that you would come and break the chains that may be binding some of our belief Believers tonight some of our brothers and sisters suppose they would find the freedom that we talk about they would find the freedom that we live in God that the devil would not have his say or his way anymore but God you would come we love you Lord we thank you for your word Lord Jesus Lord help us to not underestimate the power of the atmosphere your word creates and let us begin to put it to use more in our lives Lord we love you father we thank you for this time tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen I wish we could sing that song the word born in you and me but amen we won't try that I don't think it's in I will beat unto me that's in there beat unto me according to your word
