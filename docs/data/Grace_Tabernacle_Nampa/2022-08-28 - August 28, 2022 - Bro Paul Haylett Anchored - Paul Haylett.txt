commit the tithes and the offerings lord bless the giver bless the receiver may all things be done for your glory in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen you may have your seats my sister yulia

sister sharon come on turn the service to our pastor [Music] bring them in bring them in bring them in from the fields of sin bring them in bring them in bring the wandering once to jesus oh bring them in bring them bless you bring them in from the fields of sin or bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to jesus hallelujah you know i just want to take just a second if you don't mind i wouldn't want to embarrass anybody but i cannot tell you how wonderful this day is to me because there was a season there was a time that our sister sharon the world had waved their best you know the devil never throws a half-hearted offering he always throws his best and it just brings joy in my heart our sister sharon here today and i say this with a tad bit of humor she's just now just another married woman but how beautiful god is to bring together a relationship our brother yannick sister sharon to bring forth this beauty a blessing a gift from god and how we have such a wonderful privilege to raise these children up in the fear and admonition of the lord not a casual we hope that they will serve god but we have a confidence we have a trust that that we saw in satan's best offering a redeeming power and i'm thinking about my my sermon today i'm thinking about our special song he's began this good work in us saints and he promised he would keep it and i i say i believe it was just the lord led our sister yulia and family and brother sean to sing that song this morning because there is a keeping power there is something that satan cannot equal he can offer his best of the world but my brother and sister god's got something greater for us and i consider it a real privilege this morning to be able to dedicate this wonderful little treasure this blessing of god that we are claiming today and speaking from our hearts that the lord having called him from the foundation of the world will keep him to the culmination amen and so we just want to take this time to just speak blessings over this child and yes there'll be challenges there'll be times that this will be a sassy little boy there'll be times of a disobedient little boy and there'll be times that these parents will feel like just lord why why lord but in the end when we see the power of god come down and seal this little soul with the seal of the holy ghost and to see this young man if the lord tarries to see him lifting his hands in the house of god and declaring that jesus christ is his lord and savior in the end just like our own spiritual walk we'll declare it was worth it it was worth every trial every temptation every struggle amen hallelujah i'm glad he's sleeping he won't look up and become afraid of brother paul um yes isn't he a handsome little guy my i'm telling you i just i'm in love with him yes let's bow our heads and just take this time a real privilege a real joy heavenly father lord we stand before you this morning lord this love gift that you have given to our brother yannick and sister sharon lord jesus as you've brought them together and placed in them a desire to serve you father you've given this gift to them lord because you knew lord you could trust them to raise up this child this young boy in the fear and admonition of the lord and father we ask you lord as we offer back to you little mary and neville father that you had just come and may your angels father your holy spirit be with him father strengthen him keep him healthy father let his heart and his mind always be upon you lord whatever gifts lord you would place in his life father i pray let them be magnified to bring glory to you father satan lord he's always meddling lord we just ask father lord that you would just once again place your angels around little marian father keep him safe healthy and happy lord may he bring joy into the life of his parents father i would father not being selfish but lord i pray that he would also bring joy into this assembly to this body of believers as we will claim him as our child as our family our brother lord we just ask now for the blessing of your holy spirit upon mary and neville father all the days of his life we commit him to you in your precious name amen amen amen hallelujah and this beautiful saints thank you lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i tell you i know that sometimes verbiage can kind of spook people but i have a special love affair with our sister sharon i got to see her come as a sister even when it was hard she'd come and would speak to me and pour her heart out and it just bonded my heart and that's what i'm talking about love affairs just bonded my heart with hers because there was something so deep within her heart and her soul that even in the times we might be embarrassed by what we have done or what is happening around us we still would come and be able to say i want to be right with the lord and so i have that special relationship and i love and appreciate brother yannick is always so open kind and loving uh to speak and and we appreciate that let's just thank the lord for little mary and neville today amen god bless you my brother god bless you hallelujah hallelujah how beautiful amen i think it was brother ron peterson one time said you know i could make a career out of dedicating babies and um and i think i agree with him 100 percent amen well this morning i find it remarkable once again god is so faithful let us come and to be able to find through the service i'm taking little thoughts as it were i might be incorrect so correct me if i'm right or wrong or whatever i think sister yulia you were going to sing that song on wednesday maybe so there was something about would be sunday well i believe it was ordained for sunday that's what i think it wasn't uh a lack of time or circumstance whatever it was when god ordained it to be and i believe that song fit very very well and uh also i won't go into detail on that but um there was um uh uh things in the song service that that just uh really touched me i thought well thank you lord i i appreciate that and um my brother jason and i was having just a a little revival in the back room uh there and uh you know i tell you i just uh i was started crying back there and i'm kind of having a little bit of a struggle to quit and that's i think jason's fault uh amen let's just stand saints and let's go right into the word amen appreciate the work of the musicians what they're doing for us just an atmosphere amen it's really the prophet of god shares with us over and over again how much of it is built around the atmosphere and with the wrong atmosphere we can have all of the message of the hour and the wrong atmosphere and god will not move in our midst but by god's grace we can come and in that atmosphere the lord will even take our inadequacy and he'll bless it when we are weak he is strong and when we come thinking that we have something to offer then it always i'm reminded you know the minister brother brown talks about went up there with his chest puffed out and he did that and was preaching to those pentecostal people and he come down humbled and you know it was voice that if he went up the way he came down he'd came down the way he went up and so we want to create an atmosphere that god is is pleased to come in and we can walk away from the house of god built up and strengthened amen hallelujah uh i want to give early announcement on this even though it's actually a little more than it's like roughly two and a half weeks away but our brother marcus becker from germany uh will be passing through this part of the world on a wednesday night on september the 14th and uh i hope this doesn't sound too critical but i would encourage some of you who don't even show up on wednesday nights that wasn't too harsh was it to show up you'll be blessed brother marcus a wonderful brother and uh he's passing through from one speaking engagement we've just caught him uh on his passing through you might say he even changed his route that he was traveling to come see us so let's just come and fill up the church on wednesday night september the 14th to um to uh just receive a blessing and also give support to a brother who has changed his itinerary to to just come and be with us amen now once again i don't mean to be too harsh but how many of you did your homework and how many of you even remember you had homework proverbs the third chapter is a lovely lovely now i'm i'm not throwing down on you saints don't misunderstand but i received a text late last night from a brother who doesn't even live in this country that let me know he had done his homework and uh i thought hmm do i mention it and i just couldn't help myself i just had to ask you did you do your homework so you know uh there's brothers in foreign countries that are doing their homework i pray that we our local body of believers can also do our homework amen and maybe i should do you want me to send out a group text on the home would that be good as a little reminder i know life is busy yes i know we're busy in life and i i don't mean that judgmental or whatever but i know we're busy but you know sometimes uh we can grasp a lot from what it's taken from and so i will a little later today i'll give you another homework assignment we can try again amen hallelujah now a key element saints before we go in this scripture i want to lay this out a key element to being an overcomer is a good solid foundation in christ right if we have a very poor foundation uh we you know uh many years ago uh sister sue has bought me just a lot of history books on warfare and things of that and you know uh a book that she bought me many years ago and i've read it oh probably three times at least and it's about a a commander a major i believe he was at the time training troops to go to vietnam and in the base where they are training there is uh many groups like this and and different men of rank training are overseeing this and this man drove his men so much that they talked about uh uh fragging him which was a term in that day when they would wait till a man went to the restroom or whatever and they'd throw a grenade in there and then they were history and there was all kinds of talk but his common phrase was as hard training now more blood on the training ground will be less blood on the battlefield and his men hated him for it and he would look them in the face and say the reason i'm doing this is i want you to come back to your life they still hated him for it but nothing ever happened to him no one ever hurt hammer they became the infantry battalion that went to vietnam and came home with the lowest casualty rating so truly what he put them through manifested itself that more of them came home than any other group that was sent there now taking that thought in mind i would like to lay out before you my brother and sister us being overcomers on one side we can say is locked into predestination but if we say well i'm just predestinated to be an overcomer do you believe that but you're going to find many bloody battles because we don't have a good foundation we don't have the right training and so it's there that if we have the right training the prophet of god preaches on it speaks of it the scripture lays it out very clearly that when we can understand the wiles of the devil the prophet of god says when we learn to block the fiery darts of the enemy then we know true joy and victory in jesus christ but if we don't learn to block those we will then be repeating over and over and over again these same challenges facing the same pain the same heartbreak the same condemnation as it were you see what god wants us to do is he wants us to take the word and learn how to weld it as a powerful two-edged sword not just to hold the bible up and say devil back up back up i've got a bible best-selling book on the face of the earth today millions upon millions have a bible and millions and millions you can hear the chain rattling in their life we've got to learn how to weld this two-edged sword and use it with wisdom and judgment and use it without fear amen i want to speak to you today on our once again the overall thought our position of strength i want to speak to you today on being anchored and as we look at this i want to just go into the scripture hebrews the sixth chapter verses one through eight as we will look at this now i want i want um as we are going to actually take the whole chapter of hebrews 6 but i want to break it down in two parts because it in essence is dealing entirely with two different people and uh we want to by god's grace be able to step into that and break this down hebrews 6 and 1 says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ now i'm telling you when this was spoken to the hebrew somebody would have rose up and said whoa that's wrong you're trying to leave the principles of the doctrine of christ that's that's false you're not going to deceive us but you see he's telling him to move forward saints to be in church today you had to leave your house and you could have drove to church but decided to stay in your car i'm going to sit in my car in the parking lot and stream the service no you had to leave your car we could start that all the way back to getting out of bed yeah and we know how much some of you love to nap so getting out of bed is a pretty big challenge but you have to leave that you have to leave the dinner the breakfast table you have to you know and it goes on and on therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not every church service laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god let me read that correctly so no one would say i misconstrued the word not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment and this we will do if god permit in other words these are things that need dealt with these things need to be preached about they need to be taught but that's not my brother and sister now i hope i don't offend anyone this morning but i'm just going to say it right out this is not for us to come again and constantly service after service preach god sent a prophet it's time for us to move on time for us to realize what this message really is and it's so so so much more than god sent a prophet and some people would have almost elected fit over me saying that but the truth of it is my brother and sister it's time for us to grow up from milk to strong meat and move on into perfection those aren't too strong of words are they and this we will do if god permit for it is impossible for those who are once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they should fall away to renew them again and to repentance now my brother and sister you have to understand because the devil will now try to inject this in people's minds i have a husband i have a child that's not serving god it's going to be impossible for them to come back that's not what this scripture is saying this is to the people who have turned their heart against god turn their heart against the word these are the ones that have come to the place that they are like well if god loved me if god this and they then create an atmosphere that once again in their life they're actually by rejecting the word of god are putting a period at the end of everything god ever said so we're not talking we're seeing god move in a mighty way in the land my brother and sister not just in america but through the continents we're seeing god move in a mighty way and men and women who have went away from the word of god many years ago are coming back and i love this now i don't want to sound harsh but i love this because they have a common testimony and that is i have been miserable well praise the lord for that you all know some of you'd be offended pray for my son i will i'm going to pray they're miserable pray for my wife my sister my whatever yes i will lord make them miserable don't give them a flowery bed of ease make them miserable lord your horse i had a sister in the message with good intention a twinkle in her eye tell me you're harsh well sister i'm not going to pray that your son who has come back to the lord i'm not going to pray that your son has a good life i pray that every time and everything that he does and everywhere that should be great joy overwhelmed drunk on the beach with the moon shining so beautiful and everyone laughing may he be in the corner saying what is wrong with me what is wrong with me yeah hope you don't find that too harsh and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they should fall away to renew them again and to repent and seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame we're going to take down to the eighth verse for the earth which drinketh in the rain cometh oft upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from god but that which beareth thorns and briars is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned now we're going to make a break here and just allow you to be seated because you see verse 9 goes on and says but beloved we're persuaded better things of you heavenly father we ask lord you would come speak to our hearts touch us and father for our loved ones i stand here today lord jesus with a son and a daughter-law and grandchildren not serving you lord jesus i will not give up i will not lose hope i will not quit praying and believing i claim them i have brothers their families lord jesus we will claim what is rightfully ours in the name of jesus christ now open the word to us lord make it alive i pray amen you may be seated saints hallelujah now i'm going to just speak some very direct things today and i hope it doesn't offend anyone sometimes we just have to quit patty caking around things you'll find my brother and sister that there's many dividing lines in the message uh brother i won't name his name today don't want to like toss them under the bus trying to break that habit but there's a brother shared once that he says i believe marriage and divorce will become a dividing line in the message and we are now seeing that being manifested where some people uh are there's very staunchly on one side now i'm not talking about marriage and divorce of a circumstance in your life but marriage and divorce as a place of justification of what you're doing or how you're doing it uh marriage and divorce as uh something that you believe you can completely disregard my brother and sister god did not give us this to play it as a game but to take a vow and live up to our vow because if we can't hold the simplest of vows then we won't hold any vow at all and so there it is my brother and sister uh the dividing line of these elements nowhere my brother and sister does the message of the hour the scripture lay out that being a follower of the message is making you a part of this plan of god now people would say whoa whoa we followed the message my family has followed the message and uncle and followed the message but my brother and sister i want you to go if you want to and make a little homework of this and look up what the word follower means now being a follower does not mean that you strictly adhere to what it is you are simply as those who left egypt right there was a what does this scripture say mixed multitude that left out of israel out of egypt i mean and followed israel they were not followers of jehovah they were looking for a way to get out of their circumstance that was though controlling their life in egypt and so this mixed multitude did not make them israelites and did not make the promise of the land their promise are you with me amen but it's rather moving into a position with christ this is what this is about it's not being a follower but it's being put into a position now i don't have the quote but i'll make reference to it where the prophet of god says that i didn't come to make you followers or for you to look to me but i come that you would be introduced to jesus christ that's what it was he wasn't gathering up followers he wasn't gathering up a group of people that would be identified with him my brother and sister you can look beyond the curtain of time of what the prophet of god shares therein and he's there and and you know uh he he gives us this uh confidence that it is what paul preached and brother brown says i preached what paul preached and we as the bride of christ responded were counting on it so he didn't come and say i've got an all-new original message for you but he was preaching the collection as it were of the things god had revealed through the ages and made it real to us and the prophet of god tells us over and over again i've always pointed you and i will always point you to jesus christ amen so it is this message my brother and sister is a moving now if we are not moving today if we find ourselves and well i've been in the message and i am what i am and we haven't moved my brother and sister you're gonna find that you're not far outside of egypt if you haven't moved see the original word would have been come right down to the waters of the red sea and keep right on walking and walk right out into it and god would have said they believed my word and the waters would have separated but you see what happened is satan throws a tendency for us to get all comfortable well my family has always been message believers or they can put a date my parents grandparents coming to the message at a certain time oh that's good and i i actually am very happy to hear those kind of conversations just as long as we can see there's a moving well without a moving my brother and sister we might very well be right where we was when we were introduced and so it's there you know it reminds me speaking of moving i won't mention names here as i said trying to break the habit but i was friends many years ago not in a real deep way but with a young man who was just incredibly bashful and shy and um they ended up back in missouri i believe it was and he met a young lady there and uh he really really liked this young lady and and i loved spending time with her but he was so shy and so afraid of being rejected that uh you know he expressed all kinds of little things uh you know showing that he loved her young men i can give you a few lessons on courtship if you want amen you got to show them oh they're way clever they're way clever brothers but in the end you've got to show them you're going to let them know you're serious amen so he just kept you know take her for dinner buy her gifts finally one day she says oh james let's go for a walk in the park they're walking through the park and she says james let's sit on this park bench right here and he's kind of like okay sits down she pulls her skirt up a little bit james will you marry me totally backwards but effective because he just couldn't get it out but she knew he loved and he loved her it was obvious but you see my brother and sister sometimes we have to make sure that what we're expressing and how we're expressing it is going to put us in a position to move forward we can't just say i love the lord and never change we can't say i believe in the power of the word never change we can't believe that this is the real word for the hour amen this is what broke the yoke of bondage and never change the yoke is broken but we act like and live like we're still under bondage no we have to move into a position a deeper position with christ and entering into my brother and sister you want to talk about a change that's happening and this is part of that um oh when i preach this myself it would just come out so eloquent you know this great fuss that's around the world today of whether the seals are open or not or the seventh seal i kind of shared with a few of you i don't remember if i mentioned it or not but you know you get a text and somebody's saying i was told you don't believe the seventh seal is open and i thought what a paradox when here we had all this friction and all this within the church about us believing the seventh seal was open and them telling us we're wrong and now somebody comes along and says we don't believe you believe seventh seal is open and i thought the devil is unrelenting if he's gonna attack from any direction but the people who declare these things don't even know you it's just a talking point from the devil think about that don't feel sorry for me that's not what i'm bringing it about it's like my response was if they said that they don't know us they've never heard us preach they don't know our church amen but you see what it is my brother and sister this moving being a follower of the message is wonderful but there comes a time that something is taking place can someone say amen something is taking place i have moved from being a follower and my brother and sister at the opening of the seventh seal i moved from being a follower of the message to being the message amen so i'm no longer people like we follow the message i'm sorry i don't follow the message any longer i am the message i am the revealed word in this hour the prophet said so my bible says so i am the word in flesh on the earth today hallelujah yeah listening to a song you've come too late to tell me about it yeah too late we have become the word expressed in this hour this is who we are why because we follow the message no christ has come and take us deeper beyond just followers we are not mixed multitude we are the bride of jesus christ not a mixed multitude not sitting there my brother and sister will the word be preached to the lukewarm and to the make believers and to the those that are called the word will be preached but this message was not sent to go remind the lukewarm or remind the unbeliever this message was sent to bring life amen to bring forth a german nation and a life into the bride of jesus christ that she could come and manifest jesus christ here on the earth today otherwise we're nothing but a bunch of talking heads with notes and things that we can research to argue the argument's over the devil lost the word's been open i am the bride of christ oh does that mean i'm perfect no it doesn't mean i'm perfect i'm still in a body of flesh but i am moving forward into perfection i'm not here to argue how you want to be baptized and how you believe the thunder's men and what this over here is that i am here to live the life that is in this word that it was poured out into me oh my brother and sister you say brother paul you're just rehashing the same old things well as long as the devil's talking as long as the devil's talking long as the devil is coming and saying no you got to just see i heard a quotation of this the other day all you've got to see is that god sent a vindicated prophet with a vindicated message the devil sees that there's people that would rip you off for your last dime see that i'm looking for life i'm not looking for words i'm looking for life i want to see the life oh not to prove them right or wrong i want that life that life is who i am and that's what my heart cries out for is that life i want to be that life oh my let me say it this way in case any of you misunderstood me god sends a prophet in our day is that right introduces the revealed word for the day many follow the message receiving two from the message however you want to say but the opening of the seventh seal made us the message that's what god's intent was otherwise my brother and sister we can intellectually open the seventh seal will that do us any good show up in heaven you know the old figurative deal meet saint peter at the gate saint peter what's my name on the book before he can even answer let me prove to you saint peter the seals are open saint peter would hear us as we quote quotes and quote scriptures and we tie it together we bring in a little bit of luther we bring in a little bit of wesley we bring in a little bit of of all of these men through the ages and when it would all get done peter would still say no name sorry come on we often times hash over this oh yeah well it's not intellectual intellectual message but then we explain it and that's good because that's what the preaching of the word does it brings forth and lays it out clearly for us but you see my brother and sister can you explain it i was in the clay i wasn't sure there was even a god but one day something something started stirring in me something and when i found myself in my greatest time of need i didn't say oh buddha i said oh god deliver me and he said i've been waiting you see i actually led you up to this point that you would cry out my name and god opening the word moves us forward amen and as the song says we won't leave our little ones behind and some of our little ones are 60 50 60 70 years old amen so you look at this my brother and sister the bride of jesus christ what is she a lot of explanations you get as many people together and you can have a lot of explanations what the bride of christ is they're predestinated they're called before they're those that he died for and just various deals brother jason and i've been having conversations like this you know what is the message maybe as we exit today we'll have a little poll some of you look terrified already but i want you to stop we won't do something like that but i want you to stop what is the message to you it really should come down that we would all have the same theme or the same thought because my brother and sister the message is not tapes it's not books it's not a church amen this message the only possible defendable position is this message is jesus christ that's the only thing that comes because we can come to a position that we say god sent a prophet my brother and sister but you can see as i said earlier there are men that will just adamantly defend that god sent a prophet but you better hold on to your wallet when you do business with them that is not the message that is not the life that is there we are talking as the prophet of god laid it out for us what is the gospel it is the life behind the word amen not a bunch of words but a life that is behind the word that makes it living in you and i hallelujah people say well we had that without the seals well my brother and sister that might be fine but you see there's an hour that it is not just we are redeemed we sing that song that we're redeemed it's not just that we're redeemed we've been redeemed as the bride you know uh could be you know could be me could be some other brother here whatever disperse these you might have started out at 16 17 18 19 years old and you just went to you know camp and you met several fine young ladies and you can tell how old-fashioned i am you guys would tweet and twitter and whatever all this stuff would be back in our day the way to do that is you wrote a letter now the downside of writing a letter is that someone else holds the evidence besides you and that was actually good because you know they have i guess this thing in this day and age now where they can send a photo they can send a text and after 48 hours or something it's gone my you could be very bold oh you're the most beautiful girl on earth and my heart just twitter painted and writing the same message to seven different girls you guys know what i'm talking about it happens oh you know but i tell you what you get a holy ghost-filled young man you get a holy ghost-filled young lady and uh yeah you might write seven letters as it were hey how are you god bless you happy to meet you but there'll be one letter that returns back maybe the other four don't even respond one responds with thank you your wonderful friend you set that one to the side but there'll be one letter that comes back and it was like i was so happy to meet you too and you know let's keep writing and blah blah blah and one of those letters will come and say ask my dad if you can call me wow that's a sign god said in our day he would discern the thoughts and intents of the heart did you realize in a courtship in a minor factor is discerning the thoughts and the intents of the heart i'm not trying to spiritualize it i'm just telling you it's a fact you realize this young lady or this young man there's something special there and i like them and and then next thing you know you know a year later they are mr and mrs it all started from a little communication it all started from a little something you know i know i know some funny stories maybe i shouldn't go into that but let's just say i know a married couple that it all started with a wink yeah god bless you shaking a sister's hand god bless you and she winks at him and he's like they're mr and mrs yeah somebody told me they asked her why did you do that and she said i didn't know how else to get his attention yeah so this bride of christ my brother and sister is not just some people that heard the preaching of the message this bride of christ has had a deeper communication and something discerned the intent of the heart and you might think i'm presenting this kind of strange but we discerned the intent of the heart of god we were able to discern that god in the written word is telling me i am the bride of christ you are discerning the heart of god while he discerned your heart because predestination is god not forcing you to be a believer but god acknowledging and writing down that he saw in you from the foundation of the world that you believed his word and he says i write record of this that they are a believer hallelujah amen what is it this bride of christ those spiritual beings are there any spiritual beings here this morning that we call brother and sister what are they they're wrapped in the word and not of their own accord but of god's choosing amen you've all seen the poster that shows like the wedding gown that's nothing but the word everything about it the veil the gown the whatever you call it the trails out behind it it's all just the written word and they're dressed in that they're clothed in that word and so my brother and sister it is there that when we become uh through the word of god not of our own accord but it's god's business i like being part of god's business amen god's business is profitable business amen we don't do this to become overcomers you know i just preached to you have been just touching on this in the last little bit my brother and sister we don't wrap ourselves in the word to become overcomers we have always been overcomers there's a revealing taking place there's revelation if you want to word it that way taking place that is revealing to you and i that we were called to be overcomers and others say can't live the message i have to lift my hand you can get in trouble doing this because they think you're on their side somebody says i can't live this message and i'm like i can't live it either so later they send you texts like hey are you quitting what are you talking about all i did is acknowledge i can't live it but christ that has wrapped himself around me in his word and clothed me and pulled himself up so close to me he's living it and i am up in him and therefore i can live it and they go on and they say well i thought you were quitting and we're quitting we're gonna go thought you were on board with us no i'm sorry you misunderstood i can't live this i still even this morning can't live this but the word the word that's been wrapped around me and has bound me to christ is living it amen then i don't have to go out and be up and down in my struggle oh my heart my spirit it might be i'm gonna use the word depressed forgive me now i might be a little depressed when i know i have come short of the glory of god but there's something in me says my mercies are new every morning and i get up the next morning and something inside of me says today will be different i'm one step closer to the lord i'm one step deeper into his word and he is that much deeper into me hallelujah wrapped in the word you see not our own accord but god's choosing my see not to try and become the overcomer because we're already right as brother brown brings it out says you know what if god jesus christ was standing right here tonight he couldn't heal you do you realize how stunning that was to the denomination in that day if jesus christ was here tonight he couldn't heal you you know people rejected that said oh no if jesus was here tonight he could heal me but then the prophet of god lays this out and says he couldn't heal you because he has already healed you so it's not another kind of healing oh my brother and sister do you realize brother stephen coffey made some comments i thought were very interesting he said he went to israel was there in all the holy places on the mount at the tomb all these holy places and he said he felt a bit of disappointment and he thought what is what is wrong with me disappointed then he recounts another time that he went to brother branham's tomb and went to the tabernacle and he's there brother branham's tombstone and there was kind of an emotion there but still something missing this young man must not have the holy ghost right this is not moving him he's standing in a prophet's grave goes to the tabernacle moved but not really a disappointment and then it struck him you see being on the mount didn't move him being in the tomb didn't move him being at a gravestone didn't moving because that's not where god is those is holy ground sacred to god but that's not where god's dwelling he is dwelling in you and i amen that's where god's at today my brother and sister he's not in a cave he's not on a mountaintop he's not by the sea he's not there he's in you and i today hallelujah i'll tell you that stirs my heart makes me so happy hallelujah hallelujah amen now look we we come and you would say well you know i i just i just want to be victorious i want to have any of you ever felt that in your flesh usually after a great battle has come and you're like oh lord i want to be victorious can someone say amen to that i want to be victoria but you know my brother and sister they they just sang this special song today amen now i might not get the words as they sung them exactly right forgive me but you know what sometimes what god said and what we thought he said can end up being two different things we thought god said if i was good enough i would heal you if i'm good enough he'll deliver me if i'm good enough he'll do but that's not what he said amen he already from his own life his own sacrifice what he did for you and i and amen i'm telling you my brother and sister sometimes we're not giving enough value to the things that god has already done we should be rising up and saying he is my healer he is my deliverer he is my victory and people say i don't feel victorious you are victorious because you are in him and he is in you and he's already conquered it all you are victorious you don't have to look around and say lord give me something that i would feel victorious it's up to you to declare it it's up to you to say i believe what he said i believe the word as it's revealed i believe this and i am victorious and if you don't think so just ask god to rewind the last 10 years of your life and tell me god's not been present with you hallelujah here we come down to our special song today what i have done in your life what i've given you it cannot will not shall not return void now if god sent the seed out and placed it in your life do you want to be the first one to declare you know what i had the revealed word and it wasn't enough sorry i'll flee from that one hallelujah because i can take you right in the message where the prophet of god maybe i even put that in this sermon today prophet to god to tell you whatever you confess is what you'll be i'll tell you what the word opened up the life that's in the word i'm victorious i'm an overcomer i am healed i am everything i have no spirit of depression i have no spirit of anxiety because the word said that's been taken from me and i believe the word over my own emotion and my own circumstance and my own feeling i'll tell you just so you'll understand here this morning i haven't hardly been able to get out of bed because that sciatic nerve has been so enraged that i moan and groan and even get tears trying to function but i'm telling you this morning amen my wife has prayed for me this morning brother jason prayed for me in the back room and i'm declaring this morning i've got victory that demon is not going to stop me from standing here and preaching this word to you i don't care what my brain registers as pain i've declared it defeated in the name of jesus christ hallelujah you're already an overcomer and by the word you're already victorious so why don't we live out what the word says about us oh come on my brother and sister oh [Applause] hallelujah anybody ready for homework go home if you would please i ask you from the depths of my heart i don't want to guilt or force anyone but read all of isaiah 55. from beginning to end but isaiah 55 11. i don't i don't know if the brothers caught it it's not here on the board i don't know if they had that did they have that in there no probably not because i wrote it off as a side i wrote it off to the side on the end of the deal there doesn't matter was it did i miss it which way somebody help us oh there we go praise the lord look at this 55 11. we're only catching a little snapshot of what god is saying right here but he says right here so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth not just neo words not just any old voice god's voice god's voice it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where to accent it hallelujah with a confidence amen that's why i believe that that song was not ordained for wednesday night it was ordained for this morning hallelujah because my brother and sister the work that god started in us is not going to be derailed no matter the amount of minions and demons that satan could dredge out of hell will not stop this word from coming alive in you and i and what is it doing it's anchoring us it's holding us down that no matter how the storm blows from the north from the south from the east and from the west from within the church and without the church within the family and without the church out of the family within the company or wherever we were or without it no matter where it come from amen this word will not return void god's got to hold to you and i he's got a halt of our life he's got a halt of our circumstance and he says i wrote my word and my word was written to encourage you to strengthen you to deliver you my brother and sister this word is not for the unbeliever you've seen it before in the quotes i can't think of the sermon off top my head where somebody tells brother branham i can't believe that brother brown's response is not like you're just you know this and argue the points brother brown says well it's not for the unbeliever but it's for me whether it hurts whether it rubs my hide raw or not amen i'm not throwing sister jerry under the bus but we're having conversation and i said well what about this and she just starts laughing and i thought what is her deal and she said i wasn't thinking about for me i was pitch forking it to someone else well did any of you receive that text oh i think i know who she was pitch forking it to yeah but it's all right that's what husbands and wives are for and sometimes even your own children yeah dad husband you need this well sometimes we do amen hallelujah we need to be reminded that there's no way this message can return void i'd go into another thought here but i shouldn't amen now let's look here i'm trying to remember now let's go to the second half of that six and nine okay there we go now what is he doing here's a here's a fundamental shift he said but beloved we're persuaded better things of you things that accompany salvation though we thus speak amen so is god speaking to you can we today say god is speaking to me i am not of those that are going to turn back i am not of those that this word will never bring fruition in my life i am not one to lay it down and walk away i am the one this word was sent for amen but beloved we're persuaded amen he didn't say i think or i hope he's persuaded better things of you and i say that to you church today i'm persuaded of better things of the saints of grace tabernacle for god is not unrighteous to forget your work your labor of love which you have showed toward his name and that you have ministered to the saints and do minister and i remember years ago somebody saying well that's to the preachers no sir every one of you here this morning is a minister of this gospel amen called ordained of god to bring forth words of righteousness amen some are called to do it from behind to desk some are called to do it in their own living room some are called to do it in a workplace or the grocery store some beautiful stories my brother and sister we don't have time today to touch of sisters you know from the early days of the message you know you sisters sit down shut up get back in your kitchen you guys don't remember those days of the message you wonder why there's a few people are kind of leery of the message because that was the atmosphere in my childhood but what about the little sisters sitting there sorting through the fruit in the grocery store and have somebody walk up and say i hope this don't offend you but you're kind of weird how dare you call me weird i'm offended no thank you can we do that i tell the old flesh would be more like the world we live in right now i'm offended oh thank you i didn't mean that offensive i mean you have long hair like my grandma used to used to and there's most of all some something around you oh praise god it's because i followed the message you didn't expect to hear that did you i follow the message as the reason i am what i am today no the message pointed me to jesus christ and he's alive in me and to witness to a little girl and them to cry amen when we see sister andrea sister uh uh alice again ask him about the little girl at the fair tattoos rings in their nose and whatever else break away from their friends oh i'm telling the story ain't i come back please pray for my mama she's an alcoholic and her life is crashing and a little girl break into tears when they said we will pray for your mother my brother and sister you talk about the clash of the culture but there's something real there's something real i rather doubt that little girl walked up to the man with the water filtration display and said pray for my mama she's an alcoholic and her life is crashing why god puts us in a place to perform the word you say perform that's a bad word brother paul no it is my brother and sister you see just go study what the prophet of god said about the spirit of dillinger and all of that you'll see with there's no way to be what you aren't and that's why they say actors go insane because many of them enter so much into what they're acting that they can't separate themselves from that well we're not actors we are the bride of christ we're not acting to be a bride we are a bride amen so it'll bring peace and it'll bring joy and it'll bring deliverance because we're not acting in that part we are that part hallelujah oh my somebody stole the time again y'all need to pray for me somebody just keeps coming has to be the devil just stealing my time and we desire that every one of you to show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until the end that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises so we've got my brother and sister godly example before us we've got a people that we can look out it might be a parent or it might be a sibling even and it might be a grandparent or it might be a close friend to you or whatever it is but we have the scripture says been given such a great cloud of witnesses i'm telling you anybody who doesn't uh uh uh uh want to close his eyes if you if you want to open your eyes and you'll look you will see delivering power you'll see the manifestation of the word of the hour coming forth in lives around us amen so we don't have to stop and say well is it true or not just open your eyes look the devil wants you to focus on one mistake reminds me of a little story hope you don't mind me throwing some humor in there wasn't his own grandma some other grandmother comes up to a little boy and says do your parents ever fight it's like yeah my parents fight what do you what do your parents do after the fight a little boy well what do they do they kiss and make up some of you probably go ahead take that advice go ahead some of you married people take that advice home with you today okay amen when you fight it's time to kiss and make up amen not to just go well i'm not going to speak to them until they speak to me well that same devil's hanging around the chandelier so nobody's going to speak and finally you do and i was just sharing this with a brother the other day my brother and sister look what happens is you realize that when you declare a truce the war is not over let's turn this into a marriage counseling seminar here parents brothers sisters when you don't repent to one another you have declared a truce in other words we are not going to give in but the fighting will stop do you realize the warfare is still there you cannot say well you know that's just how we deal with our deals no no you're not because you've never repented the battle is still there the devil still has access to the battlefield of your mind and of your spirit because you're both too stubborn well i would have repented if he would have repented yeah the devil would have got baptized if he'd have been repented also you see it's time for us to realize god's anchoring in our life the way to deal with everything in our life the weapons of our warfare need to maybe start right in our own house where we as parents would come to a place that i know i was right it's wrong my wife is so opinionated nobody say amen my husband's so opinionated show me in the scripture who has to say i'm sorry first come on y'all quiet how your toes feeling come on we want to be overcomers brother paul i'm i'm teaching you preaching to you how to be overcomers oh just second while i have my own conversation here okay okay paul you can be first you see how how how my brother and sister well i was looking for a huge moving the holy spirit well it's right here he's moving he's stirring us stirring this a little ripple upon the water come on go back through the message go back many times brother branham was there the holy spirit come down and there was only a little ripple on the water there wasn't a big wave rose up out in the middle of the lake and crashed to the shore to get his attention it was a still small voice it was just a stirring in the leaves of the mulberry bush it was just a quiet move of god my brother and sister what god's trying to do is anchor these principles in our life that when satan comes we can come and put up a forbiddable defense against the wiles of the devil amen you guys are all too quiet today i really i put my order in today for at least a thousand amens and you guys haven't got past 100 yet come on so we'll go quickly here look at this now these verses coming down here we just show that you would uh the same diligence to a full assurance of hope to the end that you be not swaffled but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promise in other words don't go follow the family over here that's made a million dollars but they're on the verge of divorce don't follow that family that is boisterous and they're gifted in this and that but they cannot come as it were and bring the presence of god into their own life my brother and sister don't follow them we get caught up and we're looking at the wrong thing and god's here standing saying all you got to do is look to me and i will make it i will anchor you and you will be able to stand every test that has come in this hour amen he made a promise to abraham verse 13 because he couldn't swear by anything greater he swear by himself and i just want to go through this real quick do you realize that god swear an oath to you oh you don't you know what a swearing an oath is somebody speak up help me a vow god swear an oath we're like god swore an oath to me yes sir he made a vow he said i'd shake heavens and earth on your behalf whatever going back whatever i've started in you i will finish you don't want paul for your savior because you can just walk into my house and you can see about 42 projects i have started not finished would you want god to be your god paul to be your god no sir you sure wouldn't you sure wouldn't but our god made a vow to us he gave an oath and that oath came in the prophet of god said god is greater than his promise can somebody say that with me god is greater than his promise amen you don't have to worry about him fulfilling that promise amen he says sure saying surely blessing i will bless thee i claim that lord multiplying i will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise that's part of that's part of this message that's part of this gospel amen god teaching us patience i always laugh about that it's a good a joke between brother jewel and i'm brother jewels like i am not praying for patience and it's like brother jewel you might as well pray for it because as a son of god god's going to give it to you anyway he goes that doesn't mean i have to ask for it now look my brother and sister we're gonna obtain it we're gonna obtain it but you're gonna have to endure it to obtain it for men verily swear by the greater and the oath for confirmation to them and end of all strife wherein god willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of the promise the immutable mutability of his counsel con affirming it by an oath a vow now what is this immutable unable to be changed now i hope this doesn't offend any of you but i'm i'm just going to speak it anyway amen you can fire me any way you want as long as not with gasoline and a match we got a lot of voices more and more as time goes on raising up saying well brother adam meant this brother brown said this you know why they can do that saints this might sound harsh but let it be they can say that because they're not pointing you to jesus christ they are pointing you to william branham because the word declared god can't change not only that he can't change but we can take it from the position that even if he could change he wouldn't and then they come along things like preachers and marriage and divorce and gifts in the church and different things like that that they're saying well no brother branham told brother so and so come on hang on to your seat belts we've got voices in the land saying well if we understood what the prophet really was saying we don't need a five-fold ministry it's not what my bible says and my bible says god can't change so he put a five-fold ministry into the church not to lift up a five-fold ministry but that me i could irritate you that god would give you patience oh you thought it would come some other fashion but you see the voices my brother and sister the reason these people can say these kind of statements is they're not pointing you to the word which is jesus christ they're pointing you to a message even though that same message says always go back to god's written word now you say brother paul um you seem to beat on that well let me do we have a moment can i can i just make a little explanation a little defense on paul's part do you know why i keep beating on the saints some of you might think i have a grudge against people who are in this church and left but you're wrong i actually love those people but there's a spirit in the land that says just get them to change one word all it takes get them to change one word now if we was to go back to the bible and deviate off of this what does scripture say you add one word you take one word away you will find yourself in the lake of fire you think oh i don't know that you do but if you think i'm preaching against some people or some circumstance or whatever i'm trying to preach you out of the lake of fire or keep you from that because it's just one word oh not a whole new doctrine not a whole new deal we've got to write a new book a new definitions we've got to do no my brother and sister one word and when someone comes to you and i'm going to use marriage in divorce because it's it's very much present in our own community definitely present the message people are like there's nothing wrong this is this this that and brother branham forgave it in the sermon marriage in divorce no he never no he never you can't find one word to back that up not one word but i want you to take it to scripture and i want you to prove it i made this challenge to men but i tell you what my brother and sister the spirit is there well it was told to so and so who told it to so and so and you've all seen norman rockwell's painting have you if not we'll round that up and we'll put it on the screen and show it to you let me just give you a picture of that here is all these squares with all these pictures in there and it starts out with this person here a man telling a woman and a woman telling another woman woman telling a man and by the time it gets down here we've got the original people that was in this first square and you can tell man is upset why because the story changed come all the way through and when it got back to the original and the prophet of god said take it back to the written word i wouldn't care if we were best friends with the greatest minister in this message my brother and sister one word if it doesn't line up one word not one word with explanation not one word with ideology one word one word saints i'm not beating on the people i'll say this again just so close and move on it's not about the people it's about the spirit that's trying to get you on one word because the devil knows god has to hmm immutable can't change he said if you one word in or out one word and the devil's there anoint him one word but it was brother so and so and you don't understand he was no one word one word why is god doing my brother and sister he's anchoring us that when the winds of doctrines blow we're not going to be stumbled by one word come on i made this example before and i'm off here and we'll close but look at this my brother and sister look at the deception in the garden all satan did was come and took away one word lord supremacy supreme deity final authority lord removed it the minute they fell introduces it right back because this god that i got you on one word is now going to judge you and he is the supreme judge so what'd he do he depersonalized this message he took our anchor out now look i i'm willing to jump out of this real quick if you guys will let me read one more quote okay actually i should ask for two is it too late look some beautiful things i'd like you more homework is that okay you got your pen and paper go search the message out brother branham says right here let me get it up on the screen so you can at least see an authority of the word amen look this sermon up write down the notes here you can find it real easy jesus on the authority of the word amen the prophet of god talking about this my brother and sister you will see just the power that there is because the authority of the word overrules everything i don't care who says amen people say well the lord told me if it doesn't line up with the word then it wasn't the lord it was the devil come dressed up like you expected the lord to look like and gave you a word if it conflicts with the word of god so we'll we'll just skip over that amen although it's got some beautiful stuff like if you come to receive you will expecting to receive and you'll receive just what you expected to receive amen i'm telling you i it breaks my heart when i hear people say well the ministry in our church you know it just seems like this and seems like that well i'm going to turn the table i'm going to defend the preacher for a moment if y'all don't mind amen it wasn't about the preacher it's never been about the preacher y'all okay if i throw it back at you where did we come to church did we come ready to burn the house down did we come expecting the holy spirit to move from wall to wall and lift us up into heavenly places did we expect to be healed when we got to church did we expect god to deliver this one and deliver that one did we expect the holy ghost to get a grip on our young people and pull him into his presence where they couldn't resist if they wanted to or was it just another sunday that we stayed out around the bonfire too late last night and we're here today no brother paul's preaching long again what did we expect i'm telling you pardon me i'm not preaching to you but people like you in another place maybe if we were businessmen with that same approach we'd be bankrupt and we come in the house of god and walk out and say nothing stirred me today it's because we didn't expect to be stern we didn't expect for the holy ghost to come down and grip our hearts to where we couldn't help ourselves and say i love you and i need more of you no instead we're already thinking about what i'm going to do this afternoon and i've got this chore and i've got this thing and we got to do this and we're going to go out we're gonna have dessert and we'll have to drop one of those now because brother paul preached too long oh don't feel sorry for me my brother and sister you know how hard it is for me to preach this but what is our expectation what is our expectation god wants to anchor us then our expectation is every single time we are in the house of god i'm expecting the holy ghost move i'm expecting the power of the word to come and show that i've got a smudge on the hem of my garment i'm not going to say lord you're picking on me i'm going to say thank you lord you reveal the smudge thank you lord that you stirred my heart because i was getting just a little bit stoney but instead we've gone into our tradition i'll leave that rest because i really want to read another quote to you okay you know what i got a little bit of i got a little bit of dialogue here i want to share before we go into this next quote it's really what's been on my heart i walked downstairs and saw what chris we i come down here with brother isaac to help just do a couple things the other night and i saw what chris had wrote on the board for the young adults and i was like oh no oh no oh no he's coming he's burglared my house and went in my office looked at my notes that's after he preached the other half of that original sermon on wednesday night stole that from me and i was like my goodness what am i going to do with this young man so it's like okay imagine how long the service would be if i preached chris wednesday night and landed it to this morning so it's good but look you want to dislodge the devil my brother and sister you're getting a pushing shoving match with the devil do you realize saints that he is so powerful compared to us in the flesh that we go to pushing on the devil i should get jay up here an example but it embarrassed me because he'd pushed me when i shoot squeaking all the way down the aisle out the back door but you getting a push and shove match with the devil and you think i'm gonna do this look the seven sons of siva thought they were gonna walk in there and push that devil out of there and he walked him and chased him out of there stripped him almost half naked and just beat on them and they run away from that and imagine you and i gonna walk up and face the devil and tell them devil get out of here he's gonna go you know how it all starts high school or wherever it's ever been you know you don't push me around i'm a son of god and when we wake up we're like who am i and what am i doing here hmm but what happens in a tug of war a shoving match when someone is anchored oh i hope you guys can follow me here and the devil pushes you and pushes you but there reaches a point he can't push you any farther because you're anchored in the word of god you're anchored in the rock and we are there going oh this is a terrible battle i've been through but god takes that storm and turns it into victory because you're anchored in christ and the devil can't push you off of the word you're tethered you're tied you're anchored he can't push you off the word and the devil can push for so far but then it comes a point he can't push you any further because then he's got to rip the word amen out of the presence of god and break it up fracture it to push you any further and that's why god wants you and i to be anchored in this word it wants you to be settled down in that when it comes down to it become even if it's a last resort we can come and say lord it's written devil it's written it's not within me as i said earlier an old friend's saying oh you can't live it paul oh i can't live it are you gonna quit no i'm anchored i'm tied to the word i can't quit you don't understand the devil has beat me to a pulp but i couldn't be pushed off of the word because i've anchored to that word and realized it wasn't me that drove the pen amen study the concept go read what the serious dangerous mountain climbers will tell you what is the word brother chris they drive him in the rock pit on something like that do you know a serious mountain climber when it's life and death will never trust another man's revelation i remember years ago i was reading about these guys climb some mountain over in italy it's considered harder than mckinley and harder than everest and whatever because it is a spire of rock oh it's not really super tall it's a spire of rock that goes straight up and the only way you can climb it is within hope you follow this the level of your revelation is how far you can reach don't jump any higher than you can live and these guys climb and they drive these and what struck me in that story was they come to a face of a rock and there's literally hundreds of these things driven in the rock and these guys are such die-hard mountain climbers of which life is so sacred because they named dozens of their friends that have died through the years and instead of climbing right up the mountain they spent i believe it was a day and a half moving back and forth across this rock face breaking off all of the i don't know if i'm saying it right pins that others have left behind they felt an obligation to remove some they could pull out with their hands and some were led down a trail that was dead end no way to go any further and they went out there and started their way back breaking them off because they didn't want to be responsible for anyone losing their life i hope you don't mind me putting it this way from bad revelation and they spent the time to root these things out cost them a day and a half which ultimately put them in a storm and this is why brother paul is a farmer fields are flat tractors drive on fields they end up spending a day and a half in this little tent thing anchored on a perfectly straight rock face while the wind blew as the storm reports later said up to 80 miles an hour and they're basically in that pup tent you guys camped in a church camp hanging on the side of a rock huh sorry farm fields are beautiful and the only way to go up is by something anchored in the rock and the only way to live through the experience is to anchor that so deep that nothing can pull it out no storm no care of life i won't go into the whole story but one of those climbers lost a family member they got a little squawk on their radio and someone had died and a man sent in his little tent there and he cried but he had a place to cry for the challenge of his life without failing because he was anchored in that rock and even in that tragedy he didn't have another tragedy in that tragedy he was able to stop and reevaluate life and live through those things because he was anchored in that rock my brother and sister i'm sorry to keep you a little long here but you see if you plan on dislodging the devil you've got to get anchored amen you've got to come to a place that no matter how hard the storm rages around you the devil can't shove you off of the rock amen and when you're anchored in jesus oh look this is the part i get excited about when i'm anchored in jesus and i know i can't get pushed on i start pushing back amen he's got me cornered in a corner i know i can't do this it's not me oh my friend i can't live it or are you gonna quit no i'm gonna push back i can't go any farther that way i'm gonna push back because i know now anchored into the rock of jesus christ that i can push back of these little things the little fiery darts of the enemy little temptations that come i can push against that and say satan get thee behind me because you realize if satan's behind you and he starts pushing he's pushing you in the presence of god hallelujah the devil don't like to be behind you he wants to be in front of you that all you see is the devil hallelujah okay look i'm going to skip over too much of this but we're going to amen believe us thou this hallelujah there we go click on that for you brother joshua oh is this okay okay i'm starting to feel convicted about preaching too long but it's really hard saints you spent the whole week sometimes two weeks you're praying you're looking you're studying waking up in the middle of the night it's on your mind it's just really hard just to just cut it off now look at this i went into a place not long ago they were having a healing service in the back of the room the psychopathic cell i went back there there was lunatics sitting in there in their straight jackets and things and there said a beautiful young lady sitting there and i said how do you do you got your patient i'm the patient hmm i'm not gonna look to see what god's gonna do with these young people i'm not gonna look what god's gonna do for you i'm the patient when they recognize they are the patient then they can go to the doctor and be dealt with delivered their own self right that's the problem we got amen well if they would just understand this if they just catch that the whole time i got this moat huh no i've got a beam well you know the so-and-so family excuse me while i push the beam out of my eye here so i can no come on i'm the patient i looked down at her i said what's the matter said i don't know sir she said when i was a little girl i took a road that's wrong i was raised a catholic then they picked me up it's a long ways from a little girl regardless of catholic church or not long ways from a little girl in church to a prostitute on the streets sent me to the good shepherd's home i served a time i come back from there and said i went right back into it again said then they picked me up and they sent me away to a woman's prison i served two years there raise that up brother joshua if you would so now oh let me see i went back to it again okay serve two years there go go to the next part there's something missing excuse me let me just read it to you it's all right i served two years there i said come right back a drunkard a cigarette fiend come right beautiful woman come right back and she said and i did it again they told me i ought to change my religion that's a sure cure just religion i got a terrible habit i've got a demon in my life just change churches just pick up this one and go right down the road to that one and it'll just obviously just change everything yeah you know i like what brother donny reagan said if you're looking for the perfect church it won't be perfect when you get there yeah yeah thank you for letting me plagiarize that brother donny yeah i'll come back a drunkard cigarette fiend come right beautiful woman came right back she said i did it again they told me how to change my religion i went over and joined a certain church and i went down and i prayed the way they prayed and i tried everything and i was still just as much a prostitute as i ever was i said see this this offends religious people you never touched god yet well i'll have you to know i've been in this message for 25 years you haven't touched god yet that kind of attitude kind of atmosphere kind of spirits you haven't touched god yet i hope you don't mind my my commentary in this yeah she said i said let's pray she got down and she prayed and she prayed and i i tried to speak to her and she said well brother branham she said i believe i'm going and i said no you're not imagine presumptuous preacher she's going to get up she's going to leave amen what was it doing the devil making her nervous my roast might burn i've got to meet a friend there's scarf coffee at starbucks waiting for me i've got to go ever notice when the holy spirit moves oftentimes the children start to cry the devil look what he says here you never touched god yet sis she said i said let's pray she got down she prayed and she prayed and tried to speak to her well brother brown she said i believe i'm going no you're not you're going out to do the same thing look lady it's the devil i said you don't want to do that a woman as pretty as you are and made i joked with jerry i hope you don't mind saying this it won't sound crass but i'm telling you my brother and sister brother branham is telling you giving a very vivid description he had looked at this girl he didn't look at her with the wrong intent or the wrong desire but he's making a declaration a young woman as pretty as you are a beautiful woman there's an emphasis there you know sometimes i think it pays that god just lets us be average yeah there's certain things that the devil just prays upon when it comes to those kind of things and a woman as pretty as you are made the way you are would be an idol for any man's heart i don't get the image that she was some dumpy girl you realize what satan had done right there he had taken her in her beauty used that against her because in satan's chosen occupation that was a plus is that too forward to speak so satan used that because in the job of a prostitute that was an attractant and satan then anointed that oh i hope you guys get this no you're not you're going out to do the same thing look lady it's the devil you don't want to do that a woman as pretty as you are made the way you are would be an idol for any man's heart don't you like to be a little mother and have some children like other ladies and she said i always wanted it brother branham now i can never have it like this you don't want to do that she said no something drives you to it that's right it's the devil she says i always thought it was but my brother and sister being able to identify it's a devil doesn't give you deliverance oh i hope that you can catch that down in the depths of your heart many people are like that's an evil spirit that's an evil spirit that does not deliver just exposing the devil now that's the devil that's the devil that's the devil won't bring deliverance just like oh i hate to even go here but i'm going to right here in this message i've been around men that would have called out your name and said you've got a devil on you and people would be like that's got to be god because i do have this thing but they never give them an avenue for deliverance you know what it does do i don't want to point any of you i'll come out here and just sit down for a month ah what it does is the devil then says now everybody knows everybody knows how can i ever face these people in church ever again and those people cause more people to quit than they ever got delivered from the spirit hmm that's why the cleansing power of the holy ghost doesn't have to call your name in public it comes down into the depths of the soul it starts its work and works its way right out and the inside out oh hallelujah i always thought it was and i said but jesus christ the son of god said in my name they shall cast out devils believe this and she said yes sir and we went to prayer there for a little bit and after a while the power of the holy ghost come and i never said a word just prayed and she raised up them big black eyes with tears drip dripping down and said brother branham some things happened to me amen this is not a religion that brings a deliverance that we don't know whether we're delivered or not we don't know whether we got the holy ghost or not we don't know whether god's real or not when god comes on the scene you know he's present amen my brother and sister i'll tell you right now i hope you don't mind but i'm tired of living some kind of powerless message we're always kicking the can down the street god's gonna do this god's gonna do this i'm looking my brother and sister it's not god it's us i hope that don't rip too many scabs off it's not god's saints it's us not creating an atmosphere not a desperation not a desire god help us this little woman wanted delivered and she was enough that the prophet of god could deal straight with her and when she thought she had been delivered the prophet of god tells her you're going right back to where he was don't get up and walk out of here resist the urge to leave the house of god without the deliverance you came for resist the urge to walk out and believe it'll happen another day brother branham something's happened to me i said it's over now sis well it's the same girl isn't it three-time busted for prostitution you think a few minutes in the altar is going to deliver her yeah i think so i think so a few minutes in the presence of the holy ghost will deliver from everything now i read all of that to you and i preached this whole sermon today because of a few sentence right here that's fixing to come it's over now sis amen hallelujah is over now why she waited into the blood of jesus christ and it cleansed her oh she didn't say i believe the message she didn't say oh yes i read this and i like these quotes she didn't say i'm going to put my name on the church book and i'm going to be faithful to come she waded into the blood of jesus christ and cleansed her oh hallelujah my brother and sister this is the kind of gospel i would like us to live and preach and say have an example here in this church and i say today god forgive me if i'm the one hindering this from happening but i'm telling you young people old people the power of the blood is still here we don't have to sit beside it we don't have to just talk about it we've got the opportunity to wade into it and the only thing that will stop us oh it's not even the devil it's ourselves god help us god help us hallelujah hallelujah the demon powers well you know this psychiatric ward would have said she's just going to go out and do it again because she has a certain kind of mental illness and that's just going to she you know what we need to put her on you know uh chromium and we need to put her on this and um then we need to get her to where she can't function so we're gonna put her on some kind of a a narcotic type legal prescription that she will be addicted to but it's legal well i'll tell you what the power of the holy ghost is legal drug it's a powerful drug amen it'll drag us right through the blood of jesus christ and bring us out i just love that but look at this now look what happens she's been to prison she's been to a rehab she's been to all this stuff but she made it to calvary she got married last year she's going to have a child now what's the matter the blood of jesus christ cleanser no matter how much this that or the other you've got to have something strike you brother vital that settles it forever that's faith jesus is the high priest of your confession whatever you confess that he's doing he'll do now i left out the quote where the prophet brings it out so beautifully i skipped over about the high priest but i'll close it with this right here isn't it awesome you go somewhere you go to the bank and they say well this is mark he's your personal loan representative come on we're human we're kind of like yeah we're looking for mortgage i got a personal mortgage representative i got a high priest brother trevor my high priest amen he's been assigned to me my high priest he's the high priest of my confession and he's here to bring about anything i ask in the name of jesus christ my personal representative oh don't be shocked when you find out your high priest and my high priest are the same guy but hey look he's everywhere and he covers all things but my brother and sister when i was reading that i thought isn't that beautiful my high priest my high priest and he's here to facilitate the desires of my heart to bring me into the presence of god and he's the high priest and you've heard this so many times oh my brother and sister sometimes i wonder that people don't jump up and say look you preached that for the ten thousandth time now but the word says that your body is going to obey your profession confession well the high priest also works off of your profession now if you're here saying i'm weak how's high priest going to work with that what he's got to do is show you that when you're weak he's strong so step from your position to this position and also when you're there saying i'm not much of a believer remember what prophet of god said about that don't you speak the devil's language confess the word oh come sister i mean whoever's playing the piano amen i i've got i've got so much still hallelujah amen let's just stand and worship the lord saints i kind of feel bad i've kept you much longer than i planned oh lord help us lord oh there is a fountain open in the house [Music] there [Music] [Applause] [Music] from [Music] there is a fountain [Music] oh

filled with joy filled with your holy spirit lord let us take every thing lord every sin that would so easily beset us let us take every false accusation of the devil every fiery dart and lord may we just take it under the blood oh your blood quenches quenches every accusation quenches every condemnation quenches everything that's not of you i pray lord jesus and may your saints father lord may they not put it off for another day may they not put it off to the future lord may they not have come so comfortable lord with these things in their life lord that they would disregard i believe father you laid this upon my heart i believe the burden of it's been great lord because you desired for me to preach it lord forgive me for anything lord that would have been the human but lord i know lord jesus i know father that lord when we get into your blood it changes us it delivers us it strengthens us it anchors us oh lord and i desired lord not to be blown by every wind of doctrine lord never ever slight of the devil father but to be anchored in you that lord as the times the challenges of the times become greater we're here father anchored in you not blown away by the spirit of laodicea oh then truly from our hearts lord we could sing the song i shall not be moved i shall not be moved oh lord jesus this is my prayer today lord this is my heart's desire lord this is my profession may the power of the holy spirit sweep across this church today any spirits lord any spirits lord that would cause us father lord to just become resisted any spirits lord would come just to cause us to not be stirred [Music] i ask in the name of jesus christ may those spirits be broken that the power of your holy spirit would come lord for our young people oh the day that we live in help our young people [Music] find satan that he won't pour something into their lives as a child that they have to fight all the days of their life fill them up i pray with your holy spirit [Music] lord
