jason and god bless you saints it's good to be in the house of the lord tonight amen just knowing we live in a world of technology and you know it can have its problems amen but we just rejoice that god allows us use technology as it is now to be able to communicate with you i uh i don't know if we uh i just had a few minutes ago felt to look at my phone and i i hadn't seen this earlier from sister yulia did you see that one okay so sister yulia shares here i'm not sure what time here this evening she says good evening saints please pray for my aunt reya she lives in massachusetts she was tested positive for the coronavirus she has been in a coma for two weeks our family would really appreciate your prayers so i would just like to stop right i would just like to stop right now and take a moment just to pray for their andrea you know this is a very serious thing in the day that we live in right and we we just believe that our healing has already been purchased by his stripes we are healed and we just stand upon that and we as a body of believers are here for one another to lift these things to the lord so i want to just take that moment and lift this need that our sister felt led to share and and we want to just lift it up heavenly father we come before you this evening lord knowing that truly father by your stripes we are healed lord there is not one affliction father that is exempt from this as you spoke to the prophet and told him if he could get the people to believe that cancer would not even stand in his way lord and we know this was the spoken word the thus saith the lord coming forth now lord your word says that our healing has already been purchased and so lord we would just lift uh andrea up before you father lord that you would just come down father you know the situation you know the need you know every circumstance about it and so father we fully commit this healing lord to you and lord just believing father that you would just as your perfect will would be manifested bring forth lord your desire lord we know as the prophet has clearly showed us we pray for life and lord commit all things to you we ask father that you would deal kindly with the family kindly with this uh lady lord father we just asked now in the name of jesus christ amen amen and amen and amen hallelujah well thank you god bless you um just want to go this evening to uh the preparations of the inner man i would like to go into as it would be part three and i would like to speak to you tonight on the value of the soul now we know the word says that one soul is worth ten thousand worlds but my brother and sister what god places as a value we ourselves have to come to a place we place a value so it is here that in the maintenance as it were of of anything in life uh just talking to a gentleman today you cannot ignore something for years sometimes even months and expect it to remain the same so we just want to look as we know the time is is coming nigh we're looking at the preparation of the inner man knowing that there is a season as we'll touch on in a few minutes knowing there's a season a time uh the scripture says that he would come our lord jesus would come as a thief in the night and so we just want to be prepared for that day let's just stand for a moment a very short scripture reading in matthew and matthew 16 and starting with verse 25 we'll take our thought from this for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul amen we'll just uh we'll stop right there for the moment so we'll just well we'll go ahead in verse 27 excuse me for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels then he shall reward every man according to his works heavenly father lord we thank you tonight for your grace and for your mercy your hand upon each and every one of us lord for we know father as we look back and the saints of old through the dark ages lord through the trying times of history lord that uh the prophet of god clearly showed us that when the persecution come upon the church and lord we're not saying we're persecuted but certainly father there is uh circumstances that make it difficult but in the times of difficulty lord that it's always caused your people to get more fervent and lord i pray father that our hearts would just be burning within us regardless lord i would rather be able to look out as it were tonight right here in our midst but lord we're together and father i ask you just to stir the hearts of your saints tonight in your precious name amen you may be seated amen you know as we take our our thought tonight from verse 26 what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul and this word profited means to gain or to benefit so what is it that a man would gain or benefit if he gains the world and loses his soul we live in a very materialistic age my brother and sister and and i think it afflicts all of us uh some maybe worse than others over over the years over time we just collect little things that have value to us sometimes it's nothing more than sentimental value and so in this very materialistic age that we live in uh we we would find that it fits or kind of falls into uh satan's plan of distraction because we would understand that the more that we have the more attention uh that we uh have to give it and uh so the more attention it requires and so as we would catch the things in this life we have a house we have a land we have cars we have these these possessions as it were and uh all of this requires attention and as i was speaking to a man today and he was talking about a property not being taken care of for 25 years and you realize you can't ignore as it were a house or a property for 25 years and expected to stay in pristine uh condition and uh you know as we were in this conversation it touched me that as sons and daughters of god we cannot ignore our spiritual house and expect it to be in pristine condition we we have to give care to that house and as a natural house has to have a good foundation and needs a good roof and and if you have a good foundation and a good roof mostly everything between it will remain in decent condition but the storms of life the the weather all of these conditions would be constantly taking a toll and so as it is uh we can look and uh you know back in my days uh of when i was in construction work i i had painted a house one time and and the folks went uh uh 20 22 i believe it was years before they painted their house again and you know they jokingly was talking about how much money it saved them but they did not look at the toll that it had taken upon the house itself and so we look at that my brother and sister we want to make sure that we expend you might say the energy and the time to maintain as it were a natural house but we want more than uh uh more than all or more than uh we would desire to to look at this spiritual house and make sure that day by day week by week month by month year by year as it is a time carrying on you know and when you think about that and the prophet of god now we do not question what what god has in store god's plans are perfect but you know the prophet of god makes a statement he says there's nothing left but the rapture but my brother and sister that was many many years ago and and so if we had ignored those that have been around those that come as children those coming through the years if we ignore the spiritual house and time continues to go on we could very well my brother and sister i don't see it but we could very well be facing another you know year or five or ten uh before the coming of the lord we don't know but you know what i don't want to know that the lord is coming tomorrow and my house is in disrepair i want my house to be taken care of i want it to be presentable i want it to be what god ordained it to be amen so we must give the house as it were the attention that it requires now as humans uh we are not of infinite resources we are not uh uh given we have uh just the same amount of time as it were every day has just 24 hours my brother and sister so we do not have an infinite resource of time and the time that we have the scripture says that we should redeem that time and if we are redeeming that time then that means that the portion of time that god would desire for a son or daughter of god to be allotted to the upkeep and the care of the spiritual house that we would devote that time that would be redeeming the time we cannot as it were ignore the house and then say well okay i'm gonna go out and trim the weeds down and and consider that good that's not my brother and sister giving the proper attention so in the time that we have we we ought to redeem that time we ought to use that time wisely and i certainly would have been guilty through the years and you might say even now be guilty sometimes of not using that time wisely sometimes finding ourselves so busy in life that maybe we're not giving the time to the study of the word or or even to just pondering maybe listening to uh music that would encourage us and and we need to focus to those things uh for satan truly would desire to to distract us and you know we having only in uh you know finite resources we'll find as we get a little older we only have so much energy and my brother and sister we have to choose what we are going to expend our energy on and and all of this kind of ties together in a sense because when when you have expended your energy on something that was really you might say of not so much of a consequence something not so important my brother and sister you cannot go and just redeem that energy now i do i will just interject this uh that there was a time in my life years ago that uh pastoring the church and working that i i just started speaking to the lord saying i i have enough energy lord to work every day and be able to preach on sundays and wednesdays i don't have enough energy and i was actually saying so i don't want to glorify this in any fashion but i was actually looking for you might say a little bit of a way out of this and you know one day i was just kind of speaking to the lord uh just uh bone i was weary to the bones and i just remember the lord speaking to me and saying you know what what you need to do is not complain about your energy you need to ask the lord for more and so i started saying lord i know that i have you know to work and and saints i i don't want you to misunderstand that this is not something for sympathy or anything of that nature but many times you know i would have to be working in the middle of the night and and uh when i would get off work i would get up and be home in the early hours of the morning maybe five or six and i would have to preach that sunday that that very morning and you know it would be easy to say i'm gonna give this to someone else or hand off the baton but there's something burning in your heart you want to share and while i would be there in the middle of the night working i would just say lord i want you to anoint me and my saint by brother and sister saints we we don't want to come to the place that we think we're acting spiritual when we start acting asking the lord for these things god wants us to claim what is rightfully ours we're not being overly spiritual we're not just anointed with some kind of religious spirit to stop and say lord i want you to anoint me today maybe even tonight maybe you're tired at home or whatever the day is you can stop you can stop saint and say lord i want you to anoint me tonight to be anointed with a spirit of strength the spirit of energy and spirit of focus lord because this is who i am and this is important amen and so it was there you know you only have so much energy what will we expend it on you know they're talking about the day and age that we live in they talk about the attention span as it was through the ages my brother and sister we are living in a day that the attention span of humanity is shrinking and you will find now i i just fortunately have my phone here because i read that prayer request off of it but my brother and sister you talk about a distracted generation when this little phone goes ding we are compelled by some kind of an anointing to see what it is we can't even wait a minute or five we must know why the phone went ding and so we are living in such a distracted time that our attention span is drawn in so narrow that it used to be an extensive amount of time and now we're down now some studies say it's not even to three minutes that there's an attention span my brother and sister this is satan's this is part of satan's trap to keep our mind constantly flitting from one thing to another never stopping to focus and it doesn't just stop when you pick up your bible it doesn't stop when you pray it's a spirit of the age but we are anointed by the holy ghost to claim the ability to focus on the things of god we don't have to let our minds bounce from here to yawn and believe that just uh 10 or 20 or 30 seconds is sufficient amen so we're living in a day my brother and sister this resource our limited attention span which would be tied directly to this finite ability to focus now saints i realize the age that we're living in and i'm certainly not condemning anyone because we're all subject to these spirits but my brother and sister i've had believers good solid christians tell me brother paul i'm sorry i got distracted in the service my brother and sister we don't have to be we can claim we have been granted the authority to unleash the power of god's word and we don't have to let satan come and draw our thoughts on how you're going to make the house payment or what you're going to do at work tomorrow or what is this situation or what is that situation but we can stop and focus and say this is the time whether it's your prayer or reading your bible or listening to the message you can say this is my time that's focused to god i know believers my brother and sister good faithful christian believers that talk about how they have a hard time focusing the world says oh you've got an attention deficit disorder no my brother and sister we've got a satanic disorder it is satan just doing his very best to draw the believer his thoughts his actions everything away from the word of god from the presence of god i say lord help us to be able to stop and focus and we could be now my brother and sister we often hear people speak of priorities you must set priorities every day get up or before even the evening or afternoon before set the priority of tomorrow set the priority for what you know you must accomplish what you long to accomplish so we hear people speaking of priorities and certainly those would be a a variety of subjects my brother and sister uh i just happened to listen to a brief little deal of this lady talking about how their seminar would help business people be able to set and maintain and accomplish priorities now my brother and sister i think that's really good they are uh seemingly talking about helping they're seemingly doing about this and people only have to just give 750 dollars for the literature and to be a part of this seminar my brother and sister all we got to do is give some time to the lord jesus and say lord i want to get my priorities right this is laodicea this is the hour that the word says that it would be lukewarm and we can set a priority lord in your word that you would come and anoint us that we would be able to do uh what you have called us to do to set our priorities on you not to set it on something of this world not upon some marketing scheme not upon some you know house flipping thing or some investment thing or day trading my brother and sister that is not our priority our priority as sons and daughters of god is to get ourselves ready for a rapture that's our priority not to get anchored and rooted into this laodicean world and be caught up in all the cares of this life but to loose ourself from laodicea to be caught up in the presence of almighty god amen i love that hallelujah now in uh john third uh third john uh one and two he says now look at this my brother and sister as we are speaking of priorities we're speaking of prophet profiting and and uh those things like that as we've touched on uh john uh iii john the first chapter of second verse beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health as thy soul prospereth now look my brother and sister as i've been touching here today uh this evening there's a tremendous focus in the world today on prosperity now you know this is just personal so please don't think that i'm trying to make something out of this i happen to believe one of those people to be one of those people that that you can labor out here in the natural and you can gain as it were natural treasure as it were a house uh land a little money in the bank etc i'm one of those i don't think that you have to take some vow of poverty you know and just scrape by all the time to stay in your correct position with the lord but my brother and sister we got to keep everything as our brother george always puts the little level right here you know we got to keep things in balance and so what this tremendous of focus on prosperity uh i constantly get things in my inbox about how that you know if you'll just do this and do that you can increase your wealth well my brother and sister what kind of wealth are they talking about well if we look what john had to say here he says beloved i wish above all things so he's putting a high emphasis on this that thou mayest prosper so if we was just to cut short or take a hold of this we would realize john is telling the saints that i am placing a priority i'm placing something here that you would prosper you don't have to be uh uh you know in poverty you don't have to just be uh groveling as it were in the alleys and byways and he says here that you could be uh uh prospered you could be brought up you could do well and he says uh here also to be in health and their tremendous focus look at the world we live in today now there is this constant focus on how to make money and how to live healthier everywhere you go facebook those of you that do facebook you will find that things like facebook there is constantly this person with a diet this with a health food this with a supplement this with this this exercise this deal here health health health health health and we have also in there oh here here's how you can make more money you can have more time to be more healthy and you can do this and do this but you know what you don't find when you look on things like facebook is you don't find too much about how to build a closer relationship with god it's mostly on the carnal and the natural things of life so you look at this uh this focus is there but look my brother and sister he puts a comma and then he continues it on which to me is the quantifier or qualifier that puts it all in balance right god's word always puts everything in balance amen god will not leave you out of balance so he says here now beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health we could stop right there and say amen and i believe we should that we want to prosper and be in health but he puts this quantifier on it even as thy soul prospers so we look at this and he's putting this this qualification on it this connection to the prosperity natural the the health natural needs to only be in proportion and the right balance to your spiritual prosperity now my brother and sister if we if we look and i've used this analogy many times through the years if we had like to say eight or nine or ten year old child and you know uh they they celebrate their 11th birthday and they haven't grown and they they can't do any higher uh qualification of education and they celebrate their 12th birthday and they're in the same spot they're 13th and they're in the same spot 14th are in the same spot somewhere along that line we're going to say we need to take our child and see a doctor see if there's some kind of a deficiency or some kind of disease or something that is causing our child to not grow both naturally and intellectually or knowledge wise whatever we we would go but i tell you i don't mean to be rude but we'll have people that will set in church for 20 or 30 years and not grow spiritually they are sitting in the same spot that they did 30 years ago and my brother and sister people think that all paul's got to do is spend time talking about well we're beyond god sent a prophet but my brother and sister if that's all the further someone has matured in 30 years there's an issue there is something wrong amen so the prophet of god even made the statement that when we recognize who we are we will become an invincible army no it's not my brother and sister that we become something special but we recognize who we are in the plan of god and as that plan is unfolding we are growing with it amen hallelujah i hope somebody out there said amen too amen so here it is see as the soul prospers so if the soul is not prospering but our health is good we're exercising spending all our money on vitamins and vegetables and our bank account is growing but the soul is not prospering we've got problems we've got a lot bigger problems than what's happening out here in laodicea with the government and everything else we've got bigger problems my brother and sister the sin question is a bigger problem amen than the financial question or the health question so you look at this and realize that this connection now if we prosper and we are in health and our soul is prospering then we have a balance my brother and sister i've said this for years i believe it you could give a believer a real holy ghost-filled believer you could give him any amount of money and by the leadership of the holy ghost he'd know what to do with it but you take one that might be just a make-believer you take one that might be the unbeliever and you hand them untold wealth all you got to do is go to the internet and type in lottery winners and you will see all these people that that money ruined them but if you got a real holy ghost-filled son or daughter of god and they come into wealth they would know what to do with it imagine the good things just like and we'll touch on it in a few minutes just like the rich young ruler amen see where he fit so you look at this amen but it's got to be in the correct proportion see we don't want to say well you know if i had an equal portion of my soul growing and my health and my natural prosperity but my brother and sister that's not the proportion that the word of god gives it to us amen that is not the balance not to divide it up as three portions equally but we have to come to that right balance now look my brother and sister there is this day right now i just talked to an individual today said that the stimulus check from the government has landed in their bank account and they were so happy amen they got twenty four hundred dollars them and their wife and uh it's now in their bank account right there and and they bank online and their phone went ding and said you've got to deposit showed it's from the u.s government i i think you know whatever that stimulus package you know all they're doing is adding to the debt and you have to understand the way they look at you uh bro our brother eugene one time preach a service that just baffled me until i really studied it out my brother and sister they have pledged you and i as citizens of the united states to labor to pay our portion you see we say it's the government's debt the government says no it's your debt you study how they speak it and they say every man woman boy and girl amen even a child that has just been born taking its first breath is now like i forget 60 70 80 000 in debt the minute they're born because that is how the government looks at it they have pledged that debt to that child to pay in their lifetime some contribution as it were in taxes or to the economy so you look at this this stimulus package is here to help everyone all they've done is just put it in uh the debt added it to what you owe amen now remember what brother branham said many years ago he said that they were not spending the money that would be paid with the taxes 40 years that our children 40 years down the road and so you see now how it is that they added my brother and sister in all this stimulus they added as much debt as the whole nation had just 20 years ago they added it in one stroke my but you see we also know that this nation must come to the place that it's bailed out it's got to come to the place that is so thoroughly bankrupted now my brother and sister bankruptcy sometimes can be merely cash flow or it's when your debts exceed your assets and when you realize what is happening my brother and sister they're spending we we say what is wrong with these people no praise the lord they're spending our nation into a fulfillment of scripture i say thank you lord even as much as we don't like it it must come to pass but remember my brother and sister the prophet of god clearly shows us that the bride of jesus christ will be raptured before tribulation the wrath hits this earth the bride will be raptured amen he uses many types through the scripture and we'll we'll not uh venture into that tonight so you look at that some people are like well are we in the tribulation uh what is happening now my brother and sister no this is birth pains this is not tribulation tribulation is when hell comes to earth amen this is birth pains the earth is in travail the bride of christ is in travail and the word is being brought forth or manifested amen for for the prophecy amen so this stimulus package here to help anybody but i'll tell you what we really need in this day what we need every man woman boy and girl in in the world today needs this but we're speaking right here in our church what we really need today is not to look out and say well praise the lord we got to you know uh we got a couple three kids you know so here we go a few thousand dollars uh maybe a husband and a wife you got you know twenty four hundred dollars you know that's that's good well i don't know about you but that's not going to change my world amen it's not going to make it all better it's not going to fix any problems amen but i'll tell you what we need today is we need a soul stimulus we need some to come down and to stimulate a bride of christ that she recognizes who she is because when she recognizes who she is she will become the invincible army hallelujah that's more important to me than a thousand or two in my bank account i say lord come down right here in grace lord come down and stimulate some souls lord shake us off and let us see father just who we are let us recognize what it is that you have brought us and placed us in this season for amen i'll tell you what my brother and sister our stimulus package the one that the bride of christ is looking for that is the holy ghost opening the word to you and i now when i say the word i want to express that tonight it is revealing amen revelation all people sometimes just by figure of speech say well the revelations my brother and sister there is one revelation and that is the revelation of jesus christ i say lord let this be a stimulation that would open up our hearts mind souls lord to re receive this revelation of who you are that we can find this revelation stimulation amen that would just stir us i'll tell you what you want to talk about something that stimulates you i tell you some corners of the world my brother and sister different ideologies and i'm not speaking that but some of them you can just do different things i have preached in the midst of these where you just say a couple words you could just say god is great the whole church jumps up and screams hallelujah now my brother and sister if that stimulation is from the soul then that's incredible but sometimes it's merely upon the flesh or in the mind that you can get so excited about something but you see if we don't make it out the door with that it only stimulated our flesh what we wanted to do is open us up amen that's why the prophet of god shows us how that in the music and the opening of a service it sets an atmosphere and the holy spirit can just come right in it's pleased with our worship comes right in but the prophet of god showed us so clearly how that the true stimulating power of god come from the opening of the word from the preaching of the word amen we can talk about the carcass we can talk about how eagles are going to be gathered around it but i say let's find the carcass amen i believe we have but let's find the carcass and we need to dig into that carcass not stand around as it were with our little wings crossed saying you know what this looks like the carcass this might be what they were talking about the carcass i'm going to examine it from every angle because i think it might be and it should be and the seasons right in the locations right no my brother and sister where the carcass is the word of god eagles will be found feeding amen not talking feeding hallelujah i just read a lovely quote i wished i had it right now i'd share with you lovely quote well prophet of god talks about we're we're not here just to talk about this we're not here to talk about the message we are here to become the message hallelujah i i love that amen i don't want to just talk about it i want to become it i believe it amen i've committed my life to it i've spent these years laboring from my heart as this little assembly here in this in this town because i believe this i've given because i believe this and so i don't want to just stand around and say well okay praise the lord we got a carcass here no i want to come i want you now pardon me for for uh putting it pardon me for putting it this way but my brother and sister well i want you to come and say hey brother paul and when i look up i want you to see food on my face hey man i want you to say hey hey what that must be good because he's he's got food on his face i tell you my brother and sister sometimes we so daintily sometimes we are so prim and proper well praise the lord if i i said amen if i really let this stimulation that's stirring my heart right now out what would people think brother branham blasts that he said if you don't let it out my brother and sister god will find somebody to let it out through well praise the lord hallelujah talk about some stimulation look here what the prophet of god's got to say question and answers on the seals he said now i encourage everyone any time any place that i ever post a quote or make reference to it we are not trying to isolate something to to twist or tweak your perspective but i don't believe that you want me to share the whole sermon on every quote every night you have notes it's on the internet you can go back if you don't want to take the notes i encourage you read every bit of this study these things don't think we're cherry picking amen because you can't cherry pick the carcass hallelujah now question answers on the seals brother brown says now but the bible said that he was slain before the world was ever created and your name when the lamb's book when the lamb was slain to redeem this book here is a great thing now now saints i just preached you know about the last 17 years on our name being in the book before the foundation the world you know different brothers have different topics or you might say a favorite thing that stirs them you say well uh now i'm not name-dropping and i certainly don't say this critical but you hear brother tim pruitt preach and brother tim loves the book of revelation he he digs in there he's pulling it apart and he comes and you'll see him coming back to certain points over and over again because he's trying to make an emphasis of what that scripture is and how it's relevant to us and and i put this in a context that through the years my brother and sister my heart has always rejoiced since the lord ever first took me to this is always rejoice to know my name was on that book before the earth that we are on today even had a foundation now that ought to be something to get us excited that's not something well i'm so glad you know i just slipped in before the rapture come my brother and sister how can that be when god placed you in the plan before the very earth we walk on had a foundation oh hallelujah oh my goodness i'll tell you that gets me excited now look what the prophet of god says about it if you think i'm overly carried away hear what the prophet of god says here here is a great thing now now my brother and sister the prophet was standing here with us tonight and and he was looking in the scripture and he said hey saints here is a great thing we wouldn't say oh yeah okay fine now are you with me amen here's a great thing now it might cause stimulation now many people don't get excited about that my brother and sister not is too mundane it's too too old news to them but i'll tell you what it still causes stimulation in me and i'm not saying that to boast i'm just telling you that when i read that and realize what god had done what he included me in included you in is so great he took it all the way back before the foundation hallelujah i like that amen look when when the lamb now remember the bible said the lamb's book of life was written before the foundation of the world well you know why i think it ought to excite some of us because some of us just balancing our checkbook almost feel backslidden some of us in dealing with our children feel backslidden some of us with uh problems of life maybe marriage problems you just think it's all coming apart at the same and you say oh woe is me woe is me what was me why don't you stop and focus on what the carcass is bringing to you and that is your name is here you are in this book you're a part of this plan you can deal with all of this you've got an issue in life you've got a health issue you've got something that's troubling you why do you let it control your life i'm preaching to you paul tonight why do you let it control your life god put you in the book he's got an answer just sit back and rest and ask him to give you the answer lord reveal the answer but maybe the answer is in the carcass and if we're not eating the carcass we won't find the answer oh hallelujah what we got to do is just simply get back into the word and make it a priority of our lives again amen oh it might cause stimulation i don't know about how you're doing saints but it's got me stimulated amen now remember the said the lamb's book of life was written before the foundation of the world and your name might have been possibly could have by accident placed in there hallelujah because after all god just deals in accidents right cosmic light striking cosmic matter caused something to happen come on saints god with intention amen now you know there's a brothers always always corrects me he's always reminding me brother paul brother branham said that jesus blood was not spilt because that sounds like an accident it was poured out which is intentional now my brother and sister i want to take that same intentionality if that's a word and i want you to take that and realize that's how your name ended up in the lamb's book of life god intentionally wrote our name in that book that ought to bring some stimulation to a believer somewhere amen hallelujah and your name was put in was in the book when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world to redeem every name that was written in the book see you got it now see there ain't nothing out of order now if we'll take what the prophet of god said though there ain't nothing out of order then my brother and sister if nothing's out of order do we have a right to make chaos out of something god put in order do we have a right to sit back and say this is this is all a mistake this is a problem this is this this is that my brother and sister if god said it's in order we need to stand up and say what we think is chaos is in order and we need to trust one who said it in order or otherwise maybe we could readjust the tilt of the earth or we could adjust where the heavens and the stars would appear maybe we could change cosmic light to move and do whatever we would please it to do my brother and sister that wasn't the attention the prophet of god said our theme song is only belief that was not oh try to change it oh get worried about it oh get stressed about it oh backslide over it no he said only believe hallelujah oh i tell you i think some of us need a little more intentionality amen oh see there ain't nothing out of order it's working just exactly like god's big time pc like a moving right around your name was put in there before the foundation of the world when the lamb was slain to redeem what was in that book oh hallelujah that means i can say today i'm redeemed amen it's not we might be but there's a possibility of it we can today rejoice from the depths of our heart oh but brother paul if you knew the mistakes that i made you think god don't know the mistakes you were going to make you think god said well i'll redeem them until he makes a mistake god said i'm going to put his name in the book put her name in the book in spite of her mistakes or his mistakes my brother and sister that's how you got to look at it god chose you in spite of you oh hallelujah i hope i'm not too excited tonight amen i i sound strident but it's just a joy inside my soul tonight to know that god knew exactly who i would be my he didn't have this little boy born to to a parents on on a farm somewhere and go through everything that life would offer and disappointments and highlights and all of this so that i would just accidentally turn out to be something useful in the plan of god god knew hallelujah and he still said i choose you thank you lord thank you lord and now he comes forward and takes that book to claim his redemption now my brother and sister some would say that the opening of the book was the actual redemption but the actual redemption took place when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world that's when the actual redemption took place what is this the opening of the book is the manifestation that's god loosing it to come forth to take place hallelujah amen once again i repeat this statement we hear people speak of priorities but matthew 6 33 34 gives very clear clarity to us my brother and sister about priorities but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these can i be presumptuous tonight nobody get too upset with me and all of this prosperity and health shall be added to you hallelujah i hope you see the correlation the continuity seek the kingdom of god so here john put it that you would prosper and be in health even as your soul prospers but here we see in matthew how it's turned the other way around in other words set in order that you seek the kingdom of god first and his righteousness and your prosperity and your health and these other things will be added to you take therefore no thought for to tomorrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient until the day is the evil thereof my brother and sister if the stock market goes up tomorrow the stock market goes down tomorrow well hallelujah what's that got to do with you and i if they come out tomorrow and say that everybody's going to have the flu and everybody that's susceptible is going to or the virus and everybody that's susceptible is going to die what's that got to do with you and i because you can't die one second before god ordains it and you won't live one second longer amen we are the lords amen we have been given fully we belong to him amen we are as it were an esther coming to her king she is not a concubine she is the queen but as i preached to you here recently she did not look at him that's the king she looked at him and said that's my husband hallelujah and we are the bride of jesus christ we are not as it were just a possession we are not the concubine we are the wife let's look at him as our husband let's look at him oh he is our king amen he is all of those uh wonderful names that describe our god our lord jesus christ all of those names but we must come down to the simple fact he is our husband hallelujah now that's you know some people don't like that some people think that just way way too personal i want to serve a god well my brother and sister this god said that he would be to you as a husband amen he would be and we would be to him as a wife if that is too aki too yucky too personal my brother and sister then you're gonna have to get over it because you're going to have a real issue if you're going to hold god at arm's reach and then claim to be his bride well come on saints it's proven in the courts of this land that if a man marries a woman and that marriage is not consummated he has a right to walk away from her and that be annulled it's not even considered a marriage oh my brother and sister you say brother paul how's that relevant it's because this is all about relationship it is not this is my husband don't touch me don't speak to me don't do this don't do this no my brother and sister this is a relationship an intimate relationship as a husband and a wife and the scripture even brings that out to us oh hallelujah so he look as we would take this get our priorities right seek the kingdom first his righteousness and these other things added to you now people make plans don't they i've got so many plans well i possibly couldn't even fulfill them in the rest of my life i have so many plans i want to go back to africa i want to go to europe i want to go back to australia i would i wouldn't mind going to japan i i you know just all these things that are there and believe it or not i have invitations i just would need to commit and and take those and go but my brother and sister you see as we make plans as we we take these things and we say well i want to do this and i think these are lofty i think these are loyal we say well i want to buy a house oh i want to do this i want to you know progress in my career that's wonderful look what james said it says right here amen the fourth chapter starting with the 13th verse he said go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gained so making plans voicing those plans is what we're going to do i'm going to set up a business i'm going to buy and i'm going to sell and i'm going to get gain what is this my brother and sister gain is equivalent or synonymous with profit amen so i'm going to go to a city and i'm going to do this work buy and sell and i'm going to get profit and the scripture told us amen what would it profit a man to gain the whole world so now we're setting the very paradox or the very box the matrix by which a man could enter in with plans to go to a city buy and sell and make profit whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow for what is your life it is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time then vanish away i'll tell you what there's nothing like i i don't consider myself old in fact i i just i just refuse to but where did the last 40 years go i can remember brother shawn when i was your age i just could not wait to get a driver's license 14 years old i got my first dirt bike oh the world had been set free to me but then i started hearing about these other places you could go ride a dirt bike beside some farm or canal bank or ditch bank or some interesting places i'll leave it at that and then i wanted a car and when i got a got my own pickup at 16 years old i thought i had the answer but there was always something else and then poof here i am standing tonight 58 and a half years old preaching to you and wondering where did the last years go they were like a vapor and i'm still living amen it is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time then vanisheth away for that you ought to say oh lord forgive me so many times i've i've not fulfilled this for that ye ought to say if the lord will we shall live and do this or that look what he's doing laying a foundation that we are actually telling god we want your perfect will lord we want what you want lord i have plans as a human i have plans as a man amen that lord i want to accomplish this i i want to build a house i want to remodel a house i want to buy the land i'd like to travel the world lord all of these things are my expression but when we come to the place we're willing to lay our expression out and then say lord whatever you will is what i really want amen see then you're putting your soul in a position that you bear your soul to god and let god put the circumstance or the blessing or whatever it might be in life in you not you trying to dictate to god amen but now you rejoice in your boastings i'm going to go do this i'm going to own this i'm going to build this i'm going to buy this see we just take it for granted but obviously by the scripture god is trying to compel us to put his will in front of everything that we're doing by putting his will in front of everything that we're doing we're telling god i'm willing lord if i never own a house a train or a plane or this or do that if i never go back to australia i never go to africa i never go to europe lord whatever you want i'm happy with you see we're not putting our own personal gain we're not putting what we think and feel and want ahead of god's will oh my but now you rejoice in your boastings and all such rejoicing is evil i don't think any one of us would say lord i want to just do this and be evil therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin i think verse 17 clenches this lord help every one of us because if we're to put it to god that his perfect will would take place and we don't put it to god that his perfect will take place it says right there in verse 17 him that knoweth do good and doeth it not it's sin so for us to put our own boasting our own hearts desires our own longing for whatever it might be my brother and sister are for us to put that ahead of the will of god is sin now some people would say well i disagree and that's good i'm not here to argue with you i just see it the way i see it and i can't see it any other way lord your perfect will when the lord first spoke to me about this it changed the way i pray i find myself even today saints praying for my brother jewel this desiring as he was going into this surgery this desiring that the surgeon's hand would be guided so perfectly that everything would be right but at the end of this prayer see it might sound like a paradox it might sound like paul is double minded but at the end of that prayer that i prayed earnestly for brother jewell's life i had to close that prayer out with lord thy will be done and we would look at from my brother and sister and we'd say oh oh if a brother passed away a sister passed away oh this is terrible this is terrible and some people my brother and sister are celebrating the death of uh aunts and uncles and and grandma and grandma grandpa and grandpa and moms and dads and they they're longing they're constantly looking back to this oh this terrible time this terrible time what we should be doing is saying lord thank you lord they've graduated they're walking on the streets of glory in the presence of almighty god you chose him lord you said the season that as a fruit as the first fruit they're ready to come in the presence of god we shouldn't be mourning that my brother and sister we should be saying hallelujah and lord i'm looking for the day to go visit mom and dad again to grandma and grandpa again lord to walk in your presence i'm looking for that day and that might come tomorrow for us it might not come for fifty years for us but whatever it is lord thy will be done otherwise we start trying to impose our will our ideas we we should rejoice and we rejoice when we should be mourning because this flesh is a conflict to the things of god oh my do you know in various forms i just want to make this not each one of these implies the same way that i'm preaching it tonight so don't misunderstand me but the prophet of god uses the words lord willing 959 times in the message amen over and over and over again speaking lord willing my brother and sister i think that i think that might have meant something because he was compelled now look we're going to just go right here into leadership amen now look at this brother branham says now i i like this not intentional but i like this this was preached on my birthday i was four whole years old my hard to imagine isn't it my parents didn't hear about the message for another five years beyond this if you ever bought one of my tapes get this when i get when i get home the trail of the serpent so if you've ever bought one of my tapes he's saying get this when this one comes out you get this one when i get when i get home the trail of the serpent and you'll see where it's at see where this ends up at going home now to speak if the lord willing go study the foundations the few words that the prophet of god speaks about the trail of the serpent but brown was going to go back to jeffersonville because he wanted to preach it in his home church where the people would sit there and absorb that and support it and draw on it and brother branham was going to lay the rubber to the road my brother and sister do you know there was men that claimed friendship with brother branham claimed to believe what he bought and at the passing of brother branham did their best to divide the message up to claim their group of believers to claim their position in the whole thing men who did very politically oriented things if brother brown had preached the trail of the serpent i can only imagine saints if i could speculate this evening for just a moment i can only imagine what the prophet of god saw when he was around those groups i can only imagine i wouldn't even want the job you imagine that when someone comes up oh god bless you brother branham and he could tell right there just it wasn't mishawaka mishawaka here was a man filled with the holy ghost his whole hearts desire to go up and and that man was rejoicing and entering into the word but a man that was also interpreting the speaking of the tongues and entering to this had a whole other family by another woman i had an extramarital affair and was doing that but still anointed the rain falling on the just and the unjust right prophet of god go study the message how he talks about how he was out there cave and the wind blew that open again and blew it open again and uh god speaking to him about the rain falling on the jost and the unjust my brother and sister how this would be and here the prophet of god is talking about when i get home you'll see where it's at he would he was oh if we could only understand what he was saying here you'll see where it's at and you'll see where it ends up how and going home now to speak if the lord willing it's about four hours so i couldn't keep it at one of the meeting like this i have to go up there where the church suffers with me so long patiently and notice but now you can listen at the tapes sometime in your home amen so he's telling them when i preach this what does this tell me saints he had every intention of going home and just laying the whole thing right out and saying this is where this spirit's at this is where this spirit's at this is where this individual is and the spirit they're anointed with oh my goodness oh my goodness but you notice he quantified this lord willing oh my goodness and then the prophet goes from the scene well that's a shame he never got to preach that no saints god didn't want it preached god did not want that priest or it would have been preached it would be part of the message that we have recorded today oh notice this now we find out that he was great success then we find him later until he was a greater success until he was let's talk about the rich young brother until he said i've got so much boy he made a real genuine guy of this day amen i've got so much boy he'd have made a real genuine guy of this day wouldn't he even my barnes has swelled out there bursting i've got so much till i said oh soul take your rest but you see he got the formula wrong he didn't put value to the soul he put value to prosperity oh my oh my now look what the prophet goes on to say but what he done at the beginning he rejected the leadership of jesus christ so when he had accumulated this wealth that caused his barns to swell my brother and sister that was not when he rejected god he rejected god in the beginning so god did not hinder his prosperity now many times we'll see that people still in this day even after the prophet warned us about this people still put some kind of value to the fact that they're prospering is a blessing from god the rich young ruler the prophet of god says had rejected leadership of jesus christ he still prospered and he still was faithful in church amen because look at this and what he done at the beginning he rejected the leadership of jesus christ his church his intelligence his education and all led him to a success all the jews love him they gave he gave to them he helped them he might have done this that or the other but you see he rejected the leadership of jesus christ the eternal life and that the bible said he said thou fool tonight your soul is required now we find him the next place is in hell lifting up his eyes and seeing that beggar that he'd turned out to the street in the bosoms of abraham what a fatal my brother and sister the word fatal means death what a fatal mistake how that the churches had had had had had been all right in the way that they went but they still hadn't had eternal life you see what we're doing my brother and sister is coming to a place we have to put it in the right order i want to close sister emmy would you come amen see he profited tremendously at the expense of his soul see no matter what our wealth is god's been good to sister jerry and i i live in a paid for house i don't have to worry about paying the light bill tomorrow it doesn't matter what kind of wealth we have it don't matter what our ability is it don't matter what our talent is we cannot put those things above our soul we have to put our perspective correctly amen now look as we look at this my brother and sister in first corinthians 9 19 i think i'll just skip down for the sake of time to verse 24. know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that that ye may obtain all saints let's just keep pressing to the mark of the high calling just think of how glorious i don't expect you to jump up out of your seat and shout and sing but i think sometimes we as believers message believers have just got so jaded you might say we've heard it we've heard it and we've heard it and we understand it we believe it that it's lost the spark in our soul to realize how incredible the plan of god was that he would go before there was even a earth he would go and put our name in that book and then tell us uh place us in a time in a season he places in this and when you look at that when you look at hebrews 11 that they without us oh my goodness you realize what god did he placed us in a position that our position in the word will bring them also to be perfect what is it it's not you and i it's the word being fulfilled it's the prophecy the thus saith the lord bringing each one of us into our maturity in the season that god ordained and how that we as sons and daughters of god are we're not hoping to but are fulfilling our calling in jesus christ oh hallelujah amen i've got more here to preach but the clock speaking of finite the clock has just run out on me just skipped out of town on me oh my maybe we can get a clock i can control from the pulpit hallelujah amen brother jason would you come i'd like to sing that running for my life amen that's what we're doing saints we're running for our life we're not running out of desperation although when the prophet of god preached the sermon desperations it showed us that we can't be sitting here in some laxadaisical oh god's in control praise the lord whatever god wants will take place we need to have a little desperation in our life amen hallelujah well i'm running for my life i'm running for my life oh yes i am i'm running for my i'm running for my what's the matter with me hell i'm saved and sanctified holy ghost filled and i've been baptized i've got jesus on the inside and i'm running for my life i'm
