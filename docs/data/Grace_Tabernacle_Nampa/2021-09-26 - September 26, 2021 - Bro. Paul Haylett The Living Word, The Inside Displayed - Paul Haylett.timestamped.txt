[41:20] that uh i move so much because you see
[41:24] what brother jason has just sung led you
[41:26] in song this morning
[41:28] is a very inspiration that has led me to
[41:31] today's thought and i i'm just moved i
[41:34] just
[41:35] think how gracious the lord is and how
[41:37] beautiful the work that god does and and
[41:40] how he makes it so real to us it's not
[41:43] just chance
[41:45] you know i remember one time an
[41:46] individual making a comment he says i
[41:49] don't
[41:49] i don't know whether to believe brother
[41:51] paul that this is the holy ghost
[41:54] or whether
[41:56] these things just happen
[41:59] and i said well brother you're gonna
[42:01] have to narrow it a little narrower than
[42:03] that because you see if you think it
[42:05] just happened
[42:06] then you ought to go buy a lottery
[42:08] ticket
[42:11] amen
[42:13] god's in control
[42:14] god speaks
[42:16] amen the word is alive
[42:19] now
[42:21] it's kind of interesting i hope you
[42:22] understand when i say this statement
[42:24] here i promised brother ken that i would
[42:26] read this before
[42:28] i read it
[42:29] so uh anyway we're gonna just put it on
[42:31] the screen and uh let you read it for
[42:34] yourselves but brother ken and sister
[42:36] lona i just wanted to say thank you can
[42:39] we make it a smidge bigger brothers
[42:43] amen
[42:48] those of you getting older can just
[42:50] thank me for
[42:51] encouraging him to do that
[42:54] um
[43:07] you've been able to read it
[43:10] so
[43:11] you know i feel bad because
[43:14] um brother ken called me up and he says
[43:16] brother paul would there be any way the
[43:19] brothers the body of believers there
[43:21] could help us
[43:23] and of course you would have saw that on
[43:24] the church whatsapp and brothers let's
[43:26] show our love to them let's go do this
[43:28] and then i didn't show up
[43:32] but by god's grace the brothers were
[43:35] young and they're strong and i know
[43:38] brother ivan brother sergey i don't know
[43:40] who else
[43:42] brother chris
[43:43] anyway they they got all that loaded
[43:46] brother allen had
[43:48] tore something in his shoulder and his
[43:50] bicep
[43:51] and really wasn't the doctor didn't want
[43:53] him doing anything but
[43:55] uh
[43:57] brother ken was like if no one shows up
[43:59] he will load every drop of that by
[44:01] himself even if it hurts and so i just
[44:04] say thank you to to the brothers for
[44:07] doing this
[44:09] there's just a lot of things i don't
[44:11] feel at liberty to say but
[44:14] i believe this is just a very much
[44:16] a real token of love that they're
[44:18] speaking back to you
[44:20] it goes beyond helping
[44:22] load their vehicle um their possessions
[44:25] and
[44:26] so anyway we just say
[44:28] god speed to them and just pray that the
[44:30] lord would
[44:32] just
[44:34] bless them in pawnee oklahoma good
[44:36] church there
[44:38] brother wendell martin is just a good
[44:40] solid minister straight
[44:42] forward tell it like it is uh
[44:45] you know doesn't have to doctor it up
[44:47] he's just
[44:48] lays it out there and says here's the
[44:50] word of god now you take it
[44:52] and eat it and live it
[44:54] so we're very happy and and i'm happy
[44:56] for him in this sense too that uh of
[44:58] course brother allen and sister angie
[45:00] have been living there for quite a while
[45:02] calling out their home church and their
[45:05] daughter tabitha and
[45:07] her family
[45:08] brother mitch and all the kids are there
[45:11] and this is the beautiful part
[45:13] and just since about march of this year
[45:17] both of their sons have been baptized
[45:20] so god just dealing very very direct
[45:23] with them and and uh we just thank the
[45:25] lord for that and um you know just in in
[45:29] conversations
[45:31] sometimes we don't understand but i'll
[45:33] tell you this saints i just want you to
[45:36] i want you to focus on this if you or i
[45:39] have to go through a little pain
[45:42] for god to be able to do something for
[45:44] someone else then lord just give us the
[45:47] ability to bear the pain
[45:50] not to complain not to cry not to whine
[45:53] not to wonder but just say simply lord
[45:56] if
[45:57] my life needs to go through something
[45:59] that it might touch someone else then
[46:01] lord let me go through it amen
[46:04] um as i said here i think i said uh
[46:07] brother jay's song service we never
[46:09] discussed one drop of this but it very
[46:11] much very much moved me today
[46:14] and i just want to saints um just move
[46:17] forward
[46:18] and and that
[46:20] i want to speak today on the living word
[46:22] the inside display
[46:25] now the problem we have my brother and
[46:26] sister in the world we live in today is
[46:28] there's way too much christianity on the
[46:30] outside but yet on the inside people
[46:33] still have the same nature nothing
[46:35] changed
[46:36] they're not really uh desiring to change
[46:40] they just want to do that uh you know
[46:42] belong to something be identified with
[46:45] something and and that's well and good
[46:47] that's well and good to be identified
[46:49] with something but the real truth or
[46:51] strength of the gospel is that the
[46:54] inside is changed now we can come you
[46:56] know i've heard people make statements
[46:58] like well you know you've got to tell
[47:00] them not to do this or not to dress like
[47:02] this or act like this my brother and
[47:04] sister that's not really a minister's
[47:06] job a minister's job is to present the
[47:09] word of god and then when the hunger
[47:11] inside the heart of a man or woman a
[47:14] child uh whatever starts to to hunger
[47:17] and thirst after righteousness as the
[47:19] scripture says then when it's deep down
[47:21] within the heart and soul the outside
[47:24] just starts changing but we can enforce
[47:27] a form i guess we would just call it
[47:29] legalism upon people and say you know
[47:32] this is if you're going to believe or
[47:33] belong to our church you've got to look
[47:35] walk talk like this my brother and
[47:37] sister that won't work we have to get
[47:40] christ deep down embedded in the heart
[47:44] and soul and then all these other things
[47:47] you know i always love that little story
[47:48] that brother branham shares uh you know
[47:51] and to those i never knew brother bud
[47:53] southwick personally but i i i
[47:56] am friends with uh brothers that were
[47:58] very intimate or close uh friends with
[48:01] brother bud southwick and he has shared
[48:03] this testimony over many a meal and
[48:05] campfire with others and and you know
[48:08] they're up in the
[48:10] wilderness of british columbia and uh
[48:12] they're out there hunting and brother
[48:14] bud you know says you know this story
[48:16] brother bud says well i better go out
[48:18] and check the horses one last time
[48:21] and brother bud's out there at the end
[48:23] of the the string where the horses are
[48:25] all tied off uh the breeze blowing the
[48:28] odor away as it were and he lights up a
[48:31] cigarette there just to satisfy his
[48:33] nicotine craving and he hears brother
[48:36] branham's voice come from the tent and
[48:39] he doesn't say
[48:40] but southwick you're going to hell
[48:42] smoking those devil fire sticks
[48:48] he doesn't say i thought you said
[48:52] but just simple words brother bud
[48:55] when
[48:57] did you quit smoking
[49:02] you see the desire was in the heart but
[49:04] the craving of the flesh
[49:07] craved that
[49:13] oh my it must have been brother
[49:15] branham's words
[49:17] that changed
[49:18] brother bud's life right there
[49:21] no saints i'm actually sorry to tell you
[49:24] it was brother budd's words
[49:26] that changed brother budd's life
[49:29] right there
[49:30] he could have said
[49:32] i'm ashamed to say it brother branham
[49:34] but i still smoke
[49:36] i can't kick this habit
[49:39] oh brother branham i feel condemned
[49:44] branhamite
[49:45] what did he do
[49:47] he spoke
[49:49] those things that were not as though
[49:50] they were and he says
[49:52] just now
[49:55] he didn't say brother branham come in
[49:57] the tent and you pray for me
[50:02] he made his confession
[50:04] of what his heart's desire was and he
[50:06] says
[50:07] just now
[50:08] brother branham
[50:10] just now you see and god delivered him
[50:13] from that and
[50:14] brother bud never smoked another
[50:16] cigarette in his life and it was amazing
[50:18] because those who knew him well said he
[50:20] had spoke many times of i need to quit
[50:23] you know i know this isn't right
[50:25] but um you know he he couldn't so
[50:28] remember my brother and sister sometimes
[50:30] you know the word just comes in the
[50:32] right season
[50:33] and uh
[50:34] brother jay not to throw you under the
[50:36] bus but the bus is very close uh
[50:39] sister nadia brother sergey's mother
[50:43] yes not brother sergey's mother she is
[50:46] our sister nadia amen i'm trying to
[50:49] change the culture
[50:59] you identified her as sister
[51:02] sergey's mother
[51:04] she's our sister nadia i'm just i'm just
[51:07] rattling your chain here okay
[51:09] we want to we want when our sister uh
[51:13] when our sister shows up by god's grace
[51:15] here in the church we don't want to
[51:16] greet her with god bless you sister
[51:18] sergey's mother
[51:20] we want to be in the culture as it were
[51:23] of naming her amen so anyway i was just
[51:26] kidding jay and i i'm sorry i couldn't
[51:28] help myself
[51:29] but uh let's just stand and go to the
[51:31] word this morning i want to talk to you
[51:33] about the living word the inside
[51:35] displayed and this actually has much
[51:38] more to it but we will go this morning
[51:41] to here in
[51:43] the uh first john the first chapter
[51:46] verses one through five
[51:48] and um we'll look at this and uh
[51:51] my brother and sister to me
[51:53] the song service today just touched
[51:55] right on this because once we know who
[51:58] we are
[52:00] once we are identified clearly
[52:09] first john 1 1
[52:12] that which was from the beginning which
[52:14] we have heard in which we have seen with
[52:17] our eyes
[52:18] which we have looked upon and our hands
[52:21] have handled
[52:22] of the word of life
[52:24] for the life was manifested
[52:27] and we have seen it
[52:30] and bear witness you see now my brother
[52:32] and sister i'm kind of going back a few
[52:34] services where i were talking about
[52:36] witnesses and these things so sorry a
[52:39] little bit random on this but you see
[52:41] we're moving from the time that we're
[52:42] going by someone else's witness
[52:50] come on i want you to think about that
[52:54] we've got to move away from the time
[52:55] we're going by someone else's witness
[53:00] and show unto you that eternal life
[53:02] which was with the father and was
[53:04] manifested unto
[53:06] us and us
[53:08] is a very inclusive identifiable group
[53:12] it is not an entirely random
[53:15] but it can be identified
[53:19] that which we have seen and heard
[53:21] declare we unto you
[53:24] so this my brother and sister i'm
[53:25] getting ahead of myself let me just read
[53:27] the scripture that ye also may have
[53:29] fellowship with us and truly our
[53:30] fellowship is with the father and his
[53:32] son jesus christ and these things write
[53:35] we unto you that your joy may be full
[53:38] this then is the message which we have
[53:41] heard of him
[53:42] and declare unto you
[53:44] that god is light and in him is no
[53:46] darkness at all
[53:48] amen now look at this
[53:52] happy
[53:53] is he
[53:55] heavenly father we thank you lord that
[53:57] you had just come
[53:59] lord ask you to move in our midst lord
[54:01] just
[54:02] feel like father just
[54:05] the way that you move sometimes the way
[54:07] you bring things about and
[54:10] lord you would
[54:12] give and you would take away as it were
[54:15] father we just asked lord for your
[54:17] leadership for your anointing today
[54:20] for the guiding hand of god
[54:23] in our lives lord you're you're just so
[54:25] precious to us and
[54:27] certainly lord there's
[54:29] things that we do that we make mistakes
[54:32] but lord you've already covered
[54:34] made a propitiation for our
[54:36] mistakes this morning i just lift my
[54:39] hands lord to you and say thank you lord
[54:41] for your grace and for your mercy
[54:44] lord knowing that this great plan of
[54:46] redemption this
[54:48] seventh seal that has been opened and
[54:51] father a great shout in heaven lord
[54:54] that all eternity would know that the
[54:56] plan of god is working
[54:58] it's coming to pass just exactly as it
[55:01] was said to be
[55:03] oh lord how the angels
[55:05] father
[55:06] they would worship and they would be
[55:08] happy and sing songs of praise but
[55:10] father they could not understand or
[55:13] relate
[55:14] to the experience lord that we have
[55:17] knowing of where you have brought us
[55:19] from
[55:20] and where you have promised to take us
[55:22] to
[55:23] guide us today lord
[55:27] open our hearts to your word lord not
[55:29] the words of man but to the word of god
[55:33] lord and i pray you just bless the
[55:35] people in your precious name amen you
[55:38] may be seated
[55:48] so i was sent
[55:51] a um
[55:52] little video that come from the men's
[55:54] meetings and
[55:56] sister kerry right
[55:58] full screen is your husband
[56:01] worshiping the lord
[56:03] hallelujah just a lovely lovely little
[56:05] video that was sent to us by brother
[56:07] barry coffey and
[56:09] uh the men's meetings just a lovely time
[56:12] so we just uh thank the lord you know
[56:14] while
[56:15] some of us would love to go and it's not
[56:17] possible amen it's part of the body and
[56:19] we're all one body so part of me went to
[56:22] those men's meeting and part of me are
[56:24] rejoicing uh in the blessings that they
[56:26] have declared amen
[56:29] so as we look this morning i want to
[56:31] just draw out of uh verse 2
[56:35] right here it says it was manifested
[56:37] unto us and the definition of manifest
[56:41] is
[56:42] displayed
[56:43] or to be an evidence of so the uh
[56:47] life amen that was in the father amen
[56:51] that eternal life was displayed or uh uh
[56:56] made evident to us
[56:58] uh
[57:00] if if you follow what i'm saying here
[57:03] i need to get that anchored in your
[57:04] thoughts this morning because we're
[57:06] going to just use uh these various words
[57:09] of displayed and display and manifest
[57:12] manifested but you look at this and
[57:14] realize see my brother and sister that
[57:17] this was not something that was just uh
[57:20] spoken and then it was just put out with
[57:24] no display of this now you look at this
[57:26] in uh the first verse it says it was
[57:30] from the beginning i want you to think
[57:31] about that now what does the word say
[57:33] that it was before the foundation of the
[57:35] world so when it's speaking of the
[57:37] beginning it's not talking about just
[57:39] the beginning of a ministry or or a
[57:42] certain particular little time there but
[57:44] this was from the beginning and it's
[57:47] been the gospel through the ages my
[57:49] brother and sister we can see this
[57:50] through our bible the gospel through the
[57:53] ages is an unchanging gospel and we live
[57:55] in a world today that uh many times
[57:58] there's different translations sister
[58:00] jerry and i just visiting the other
[58:02] night about you know how people say well
[58:04] you know the king's game version of the
[58:06] bible is not accurate it has taken
[58:09] certain liberties but yet you would look
[58:12] my brother and sister and i'm not going
[58:13] to be down on any translation today
[58:16] that's not my point but you look in the
[58:17] world we live in today and the new
[58:20] living
[58:21] testimony version whatever
[58:24] it's written in the vernacular of our
[58:27] day
[58:28] the king james version was written in
[58:30] the vernacular of their day
[58:32] but the gist of it is my brother and
[58:35] sister it's still pointing to jesus
[58:37] christ and uh you know i know brothers
[58:39] that say well i i kind of
[58:41] uh prefer this uh you know new new uh
[58:44] what i can't get in my head here
[58:47] uh
[58:50] no it's a you know one where they kind
[58:52] of use modern words anyway you know what
[58:54] i'm talking about
[58:56] uh new living translation uh and uh you
[58:59] look at that and and you know i i read
[59:02] that i look at that sometimes i go
[59:03] online you know and i i compare the
[59:05] scriptures and you know the thing is my
[59:08] brother and sister it doesn't matter if
[59:09] it's out of a new translation or an old
[59:12] translation if you got the holy ghost it
[59:14] says the same thing to you so you know
[59:17] people want to write things in the
[59:18] vernacular of their day and and uh that
[59:20] is that is perfectly all right because
[59:23] you see it's it's a something that
[59:25] started at the beginning and if it's
[59:28] just about the translation of the bible
[59:31] you read my brother and sister then you
[59:33] will be caught up in whether it's new or
[59:36] old or this or that but you see from the
[59:38] beginning uh he's speaking here john is
[59:42] speaking it's that which we have heard
[59:44] amen and that is not the voice of a man
[59:48] speaking to you that's a problem too
[59:49] many people have they have to anchor it
[59:52] back to the man but this is a living
[59:54] word and it should be speaking to you
[59:56] and i and in our prayer life getting in
[59:58] the spirit we should be able to then
[1:00:01] translate transcend any kind of a
[1:00:04] distraction any kind of interference any
[1:00:07] kind of stuff because the word of god
[1:00:09] was meant my brother and sister to speak
[1:00:11] to this and i want to say today he's
[1:00:14] speaking and i want to ask you are you
[1:00:16] hearing
[1:00:17] amen so it also says and we have seen
[1:00:20] with our eyes
[1:00:22] now i'm going to jump ahead a little bit
[1:00:24] of my thought today my brother and
[1:00:26] sister you have to come to a place this
[1:00:28] is this is what is discouraging to
[1:00:30] people they come to a place that they
[1:00:33] look around them and they can't find in
[1:00:36] their life a example of a real christian
[1:00:41] that they can not hang on to them right
[1:00:43] they won't save you but we as humans
[1:00:46] need someone you might say in our
[1:00:47] support group or we can look out and say
[1:00:50] this brother this sister is a real
[1:00:52] christian i see christ in them if we
[1:00:56] look around in the world we live in
[1:00:58] today as christians and we can find no
[1:01:02] one
[1:01:03] that we see as displaying the life of
[1:01:05] christ
[1:01:07] what is going to be our reaction
[1:01:10] we are going to be discouraged and we
[1:01:12] are going to give up
[1:01:14] that's just a it's just a fact my
[1:01:16] brother and sister
[1:01:17] so you see
[1:01:19] we have seen the word of god but i
[1:01:22] believe now i'm not trying to interpret
[1:01:24] the word today don't don't misunderstand
[1:01:26] me but you see we have to see christ
[1:01:29] present in the world we live in we
[1:01:32] cannot live in a world that's merely of
[1:01:34] somatics it's just merely of words it's
[1:01:36] merely of of this or that the bible on
[1:01:40] tape or you know or this and we can't
[1:01:43] live in that world my brother sister we
[1:01:44] need to see a real
[1:01:47] absolute physical manifestation of the
[1:01:51] word of god in someone's life can some
[1:01:54] would say amen to that amen and we have
[1:01:56] looked upon
[1:01:58] see this is not that we have
[1:02:01] just set back and and just simply have
[1:02:04] heard
[1:02:05] but we have looked upon this
[1:02:07] and the thing that really strikes my
[1:02:09] heart and our hands have handled
[1:02:12] of the word of life
[1:02:13] you see god's got to be a real tangible
[1:02:16] god to us
[1:02:17] see god never intended and we'll touch
[1:02:19] upon that in just a few minutes but you
[1:02:22] see god never intended right here
[1:02:24] according to john 1 1
[1:02:26] this is god
[1:02:32] and we've handled it
[1:02:34] we've read it we've heard it
[1:02:36] but you see god intended for it to be
[1:02:39] deeper than that
[1:02:41] because then we could go as a hermit in
[1:02:43] the woods
[1:02:45] in our den room
[1:02:47] shut the world out read this and have an
[1:02:49] answer for everything
[1:02:51] but it doesn't work that way
[1:02:53] we as humanity need to see christ moving
[1:02:58] in those around us
[1:03:00] we need to see christ moving
[1:03:03] as parents
[1:03:05] in laodicea we need to see christ moving
[1:03:07] in our children
[1:03:09] otherwise we look out and see what the
[1:03:11] world is
[1:03:12] and we start to become discouraged
[1:03:14] thinking lord is that where our children
[1:03:16] will end up
[1:03:18] you have to see christ moving
[1:03:20] in your children's life and children
[1:03:22] need to see christ moving in their
[1:03:24] parents life
[1:03:25] because we can sit around the living
[1:03:27] room or around the table and we can talk
[1:03:29] about why we need to serve god but if
[1:03:31] our kids never see god
[1:03:34] you have a hard sale
[1:03:37] because what the world calls joy and fun
[1:03:39] and happiness my brother and sister
[1:03:41] there's actually a very tangible
[1:03:43] evidence of that in the world because
[1:03:45] these people are just jokesters and
[1:03:47] they're laughing and they're doing all
[1:03:49] the time but the devil's a great master
[1:03:51] of deception
[1:03:53] you know the military has mastered what
[1:03:55] they call cloaking
[1:03:57] and uh you know when you think about uh
[1:03:59] little things just to give you an idea
[1:04:01] my brother and sister so
[1:04:03] things like night vision
[1:04:05] was actually developed uh a way between
[1:04:08] the gap of world war ii and korea they
[1:04:11] they developed night vision but it never
[1:04:14] came into the real public realm until
[1:04:17] many many years later and so i just do
[1:04:20] that there's many things today uh that
[1:04:23] that in that realm and i hope you're
[1:04:25] following me and so now they have
[1:04:27] developed cloaking it's actually been
[1:04:29] around for a little bit and they can
[1:04:31] project a picture and someone could be
[1:04:34] here doing something and they have
[1:04:36] project a hologram for you and what you
[1:04:38] would see would be an empty pulpit a
[1:04:40] screen and a wall but someone could
[1:04:42] actually be here and they have developed
[1:04:44] this and then is such a way that that's
[1:04:47] that that is happening behind the scene
[1:04:50] can take place and you don't know any
[1:04:52] different and that's what the devil's
[1:04:53] doing in the world today he's trying to
[1:04:56] just cloak what his what did and he
[1:04:58] shows this joy he shows his happiness he
[1:05:00] shows all of these things but he doesn't
[1:05:02] show what's going on behind the scene
[1:05:04] but you know what he actually stole that
[1:05:06] from god because sometimes oh my brother
[1:05:09] and sister you know remember i've said
[1:05:11] before that sometimes we come to church
[1:05:13] we need to let our face know that our
[1:05:15] heart is happy
[1:05:18] because what is going on behind the
[1:05:20] scene is a joy in her heart but you're
[1:05:22] tired you're this you're that uh you
[1:05:24] know you've stubbed your toe and and you
[1:05:26] do that and sometimes brother paul chide
[1:05:28] you and sister and i didn't say sit
[1:05:30] jeremy did i
[1:05:32] oh my i did i'll just go ahead and
[1:05:34] finish now that i put her sister emmy's
[1:05:36] like brother paul we are happy
[1:05:43] and i had to say that in humor sister
[1:05:44] emmy
[1:05:46] you know sometimes we just need to let
[1:05:48] her face know it
[1:05:52] so what god is doing
[1:05:54] he's working on the inside
[1:05:56] now my brother and sister
[1:05:58] we can smile and laugh and be full of
[1:06:01] joy and sing to the top of our lungs
[1:06:04] and go to hell
[1:06:06] so we got to have something on the
[1:06:08] inside it's not about the outside
[1:06:10] amen reminds me of a little story took
[1:06:12] place memphis tennessee these people had
[1:06:15] some young children some young boys and
[1:06:17] uh this uh this colored man was just a
[1:06:20] couple houses down on the other side the
[1:06:22] street and every sunday morning when
[1:06:24] they got up and looked out their front
[1:06:25] window this big black cadillac is in the
[1:06:28] driveway and he's out there polishing it
[1:06:30] and one day this little boy
[1:06:33] he just couldn't help himself he goes
[1:06:35] out and uh the neighbor was a very nice
[1:06:37] gentleman he goes over there and he says
[1:06:38] sir
[1:06:40] and he says yes
[1:06:42] he said i see you polishing this car all
[1:06:44] the time how come you never drive it
[1:06:48] and the man went around to the front and
[1:06:50] popped the hood and raised it up and
[1:06:51] there was no engine
[1:06:56] he said i have this car because i enjoy
[1:07:00] polishing it
[1:07:02] now my brother and sister we can polish
[1:07:04] the outside but if there's no life to
[1:07:06] move us
[1:07:08] then all we're doing is polishing
[1:07:11] we're just making ourselves maybe look
[1:07:13] good right we always wear the right
[1:07:14] clothes always have the right right this
[1:07:16] right that but you see god's coming to
[1:07:18] move in such a fashion that he's putting
[1:07:20] power into the church
[1:07:22] amen so we could say right here that we
[1:07:26] have seen from the beginning we've heard
[1:07:28] we've looked upon we've handled and we
[1:07:30] could place this as it were entirely
[1:07:32] upon the bible but the word of god is
[1:07:35] not that just we would read our bible it
[1:07:37] is a necessary ingredient and we should
[1:07:39] be but you see it has to be a much
[1:07:42] deeper experience it has to be that we
[1:07:46] would let the god of the bible out
[1:07:48] now you look at this and my brother and
[1:07:50] sister sometimes you know where i stand
[1:07:52] i believe in this believe this message
[1:07:54] believe god sent a prophet entirely but
[1:07:56] i also am a person who looks in a very
[1:07:58] broad spectrum and you look in the world
[1:08:00] and there is some men that have given a
[1:08:02] very very profound explanation uh or or
[1:08:07] uh oratory of of uh uh letting the god
[1:08:11] of the bible out and um uh you know it's
[1:08:14] there that you look at that you see god
[1:08:16] of history and uh i just remember a man
[1:08:19] many years ago he was preaching on the
[1:08:21] journey that's what he called it and
[1:08:23] he's talking about the journey and he
[1:08:25] says you know uh it's just like my
[1:08:27] family uh trying to get out of town on a
[1:08:30] vacation and that was um that was israel
[1:08:33] getting out of goshen you know they just
[1:08:36] um a pretty funny guy you know he says
[1:08:38] they're just there and it's like praise
[1:08:40] the lord pharaoh gave us liberty to get
[1:08:42] out of here and they're over there not
[1:08:44] even really looking and everything that
[1:08:46] come to their hand they're throwing it
[1:08:47] in the wagon because well we got to go i
[1:08:49] mean we've got to go here or go there
[1:08:52] you know and uh you know you guys have
[1:08:54] done this on vacation you know you're
[1:08:55] about 500 miles from home almost ready
[1:08:58] to stop for the night and it's like
[1:09:00] we didn't bring any toothbrushes
[1:09:04] i forgot my shoes
[1:09:07] where's the camera
[1:09:13] it's not what god wants for this journey
[1:09:15] my brother and sister he wants you to
[1:09:16] actually be very methodical
[1:09:20] is it that i need
[1:09:22] to make a rapture
[1:09:24] now you look at it my brother and sister
[1:09:27] it's in that realm that
[1:09:29] we're not just here to get out of town
[1:09:32] i think and i've said this before i'll
[1:09:33] say it again too many people are are
[1:09:36] crying out for a rapture because they
[1:09:38] want to get out of the life that they're
[1:09:39] in they want to get out of their
[1:09:41] situation they want to get out of the
[1:09:43] the doldrums as it were so oh lord
[1:09:45] deliver us my brother and sister it
[1:09:47] shouldn't be while what he is delivering
[1:09:49] you from even though that is important
[1:09:52] it should be you with great anticipation
[1:09:55] of what god is taking you to
[1:09:57] amen we're not just getting out of this
[1:10:00] corrupt earth we are getting into the
[1:10:02] presence of jesus christ but yet we can
[1:10:05] do that my brother and sister uh without
[1:10:07] as it were taking place in the rapture
[1:10:10] so you see we got to let the god of the
[1:10:12] bible out we've got to let him become
[1:10:15] real now verse 2 says life was
[1:10:18] manifested and we have seen it i hope
[1:10:20] someone can lift a hand today and say
[1:10:23] the life has been manifested and i have
[1:10:25] seen the life of christ amen and we then
[1:10:28] can bear witness you see if we have
[1:10:31] never seen it my brother and sister we
[1:10:33] can talk of what is on the written page
[1:10:35] and that is good confess what is in the
[1:10:37] bible until you see it come to pass but
[1:10:39] it's really awesome when you have
[1:10:42] experienced what you are talking about
[1:10:44] amen and so as we'll look at this and it
[1:10:47] shows unto you that eternal life
[1:10:52] we can talk about eternal life
[1:10:55] we can talk about the future we can talk
[1:10:57] about standing before the sea of crystal
[1:10:59] before the throne of god and talk about
[1:11:01] how we'll have a conversation for 10 000
[1:11:04] years and we're doing all of this but my
[1:11:06] brother and sister we got to move that
[1:11:08] from a realm of just something that's in
[1:11:11] our mind and it's got to come into it
[1:11:13] and god actually look at the word and
[1:11:16] show unto you that eternal life which
[1:11:19] was with the father was what was it my
[1:11:22] brother and sister come on what was it
[1:11:25] displayed
[1:11:26] not just talked about not just something
[1:11:28] that's theoretical but it was put on
[1:11:31] display to you and i that we are no
[1:11:34] longer talking in a theoretical way but
[1:11:37] we're talking in a reality of what we
[1:11:39] have experienced and can speak from the
[1:11:42] depths of our heart
[1:11:45] reminds me of a brother one time
[1:11:47] pardon me putting it this way
[1:11:49] but it reminds me of a brother one time
[1:11:51] talking about what it was like to be in
[1:11:53] a car wreck
[1:11:57] i couldn't relate to that
[1:12:01] i couldn't
[1:12:02] relate
[1:12:04] those of you from alaska would know
[1:12:06] brother wild bill
[1:12:08] and how he smashed in the car and
[1:12:11] how that his throat and neck were
[1:12:13] crushed
[1:12:16] and he pulled the knife out
[1:12:18] and gave himself
[1:12:20] a tracheonomy
[1:12:23] how many of you can relate
[1:12:27] impossible right
[1:12:29] to have someone tell you what it was
[1:12:31] like to say i'm dying anyway
[1:12:35] i might as well see if i can do this
[1:12:38] and taking a knife
[1:12:40] and piercing a hole and boring it in his
[1:12:44] throat there so he could breathe
[1:12:48] you see we can't relate to brother bill
[1:12:52] regardless of how many times and how
[1:12:54] many ways it was explained to us we
[1:12:56] cannot relate to that and that is the
[1:12:59] problem my brother and sister when we
[1:13:01] get to the place we're looking at the
[1:13:03] word of god as it is historical when
[1:13:06] we're looking at the word of god as it
[1:13:08] is this historical god historical things
[1:13:11] have happened oh praise god god is real
[1:13:14] and we love him he died on the cross for
[1:13:16] us but how about you make that a living
[1:13:19] word today and what happened on the
[1:13:21] cross is living to you this morning not
[1:13:25] something that you look back to but it
[1:13:27] is right here right now
[1:13:30] amen so you know it comes a time and a
[1:13:33] place uh we could place it on the bible
[1:13:36] it needs to be deeper than that let the
[1:13:38] god of the bible out amen so you look at
[1:13:41] this you see it was manifested in us god
[1:13:44] has
[1:13:45] put it on display
[1:13:47] now i'd have to say i don't matter what
[1:13:49] church you go to and what you believe
[1:13:55] god will be on display to you
[1:13:57] if you're searching for him if you're
[1:14:00] not searching for him
[1:14:03] you won't find him
[1:14:04] he won't be on display
[1:14:07] but if you're searching for him the word
[1:14:09] of god says those who
[1:14:11] draw nigh unto me i'll draw nigh
[1:14:15] unto them
[1:14:16] you see we have to put that effort i
[1:14:18] want god close i don't i don't want a
[1:14:20] god that's out somewhere in the
[1:14:22] atmosphere as it were my brother and
[1:14:24] sister i want to god this close now look
[1:14:26] the life was manifested unto us and look
[1:14:29] at the positive context
[1:14:32] amen that it was manifested it was seen
[1:14:34] and it bear witness and we'll show a
[1:14:37] witness we will show a witness of it how
[1:14:40] would you like to be a witness today
[1:14:42] amen you know been called into court
[1:14:44] before for certain circumstances
[1:14:46] subpoenaed and you go in there you know
[1:14:49] and and um
[1:14:51] you know
[1:14:52] what you've seen or what you did you
[1:14:54] just think this is not even important
[1:14:56] why am i here but you see what is being
[1:14:58] done in the court is they are giving a
[1:15:01] witness after a witness after a witness
[1:15:04] and each one of those becomes a little
[1:15:06] part of the picture and when the picture
[1:15:08] becomes redundant that you literally
[1:15:10] have dozens i i'm gonna put this
[1:15:13] thinking of the body of christ it goes
[1:15:15] from dozens to hundreds to thousands to
[1:15:18] ten thousands to hundreds of thousands
[1:15:20] and you can get on an airplane and you
[1:15:23] can travel the world my brother and
[1:15:25] sister and you can get off a plane and
[1:15:27] find real christians and they will talk
[1:15:29] to you of the delivering power of
[1:15:31] almighty god they will talk to you about
[1:15:34] healing power they will talk to you
[1:15:36] about deliverance they will talk to you
[1:15:38] about provision and it's the same
[1:15:41] everywhere you go you don't go to africa
[1:15:44] and they are there telling you well god
[1:15:46] doesn't answer prayer god doesn't heal
[1:15:48] people god doesn't this god doesn't that
[1:15:50] that's the unbeliever there everywhere
[1:15:52] but you find a real believer and you
[1:15:55] will find the witness or manifestation
[1:15:57] of the word to real christians is
[1:16:00] exactly the same the world over oh let
[1:16:03] me just shock some of you not every one
[1:16:06] of those that i declare as a real
[1:16:07] believer is going to necessarily confess
[1:16:10] the message like you confess it there
[1:16:12] are godly people out there my brother
[1:16:14] and sister old world baptist you would
[1:16:16] think they were message believers
[1:16:20] they dress right
[1:16:21] they live right
[1:16:24] oh some of you won't like that right
[1:16:26] but the fact is the prophet of god even
[1:16:28] spoke about they'll come out of these
[1:16:30] other churches they're not just all
[1:16:32] confined my brother and sister you got
[1:16:33] to understand the place that god called
[1:16:35] them from and the position that god put
[1:16:38] them in now some people don't like that
[1:16:39] and i if i offend you i am very sorry
[1:16:42] but the truth of it is god is bigger
[1:16:43] than our thinking amen and so what it is
[1:16:47] eternal life that was with the father
[1:16:49] has been put on display to you and us
[1:16:54] it is on display to you and us today my
[1:16:56] brother and sister
[1:16:58] oh well
[1:16:59] i didn't see it well i'm sorry it's on
[1:17:01] display what you see or you don't see
[1:17:05] will not determine the outcome of the
[1:17:07] whole promise of god it is to those who
[1:17:10] are seeking him now if eternal life is
[1:17:12] on display and it's been displayed to us
[1:17:15] would it not be our ministry
[1:17:19] to put it on display once again
[1:17:22] would it not be you and i's job
[1:17:25] right he said i'll be with you even in
[1:17:27] you to the end of the earth so it is our
[1:17:31] job once again to put
[1:17:33] the word of god amen the manifestation
[1:17:37] of who christ is it is now our job to
[1:17:40] put it on display right you know the
[1:17:42] little song the kids sing hide it under
[1:17:45] a bushel no
[1:17:46] i'm gonna let it shine now this is
[1:17:48] something brother brother jay and i
[1:17:50] mentioned it to him we really didn't
[1:17:51] discuss it this morning but i just
[1:17:53] mentioned it to him you see we're call
[1:17:55] brother jay works uh you know with this
[1:17:58] company and they have a couple different
[1:17:59] facilities and in that i'm not touting
[1:18:01] brother jay but in that you see he's
[1:18:03] felt led of god to speak words to young
[1:18:06] men young men that are troubled young
[1:18:08] men that have are alcoholics and have
[1:18:10] other issues and marriage issues and you
[1:18:13] see he's then become a witness in that
[1:18:16] environment you know i've never been
[1:18:18] inside the door of those buildings and
[1:18:20] not too many of you would maybe sister
[1:18:22] emmy and and uh sean and heidi but you
[1:18:25] see i won't penetrate that door i won't
[1:18:27] walk in that door i won't work with that
[1:18:29] young man i won't never know him well
[1:18:31] enough for him to talk about how his
[1:18:33] marriage is falling apart and he's
[1:18:35] become an alcoholic but you see there is
[1:18:38] one who was called and placed into that
[1:18:41] position to minister on that day not
[1:18:44] random my brother and sister god's got a
[1:18:46] calendar he keeps it
[1:18:48] amen and so there's a ministry now you
[1:18:50] can put that everyone has their circle
[1:18:53] they work in they fellowship in and and
[1:18:55] the the clerk you know i i just remember
[1:18:58] i don't ever shop anymore but but you
[1:19:00] know i remember years ago when when
[1:19:02] jerry and i was first married living out
[1:19:04] you know west of caldwell out there and
[1:19:07] there was one lady in albertson's and if
[1:19:09] she was on on duty uh we went to her
[1:19:13] even if we had to stand in line and wait
[1:19:15] because she was just this nice lady and
[1:19:17] she was the kind of lady that would go
[1:19:19] oh oh oh there's a coupon for that
[1:19:22] so you know we were back living those
[1:19:24] days i know i know some of you have been
[1:19:26] there where you know at the end of the
[1:19:28] end of the month the paycheck just
[1:19:30] wasn't quite long enough maybe we felt
[1:19:32] blessed back in them days if we had 25
[1:19:35] left over so when the clerk says you can
[1:19:37] save three dollars on this right here
[1:19:39] with a coupon you were like thank you
[1:19:41] wanted to go around the backside and
[1:19:43] give her a hug
[1:19:44] amen well she she knew my mama that was
[1:19:47] part of the story so she wouldn't cared
[1:19:49] if i had give her a hug but you see
[1:19:53] eternal life was on display and it was
[1:19:55] displayed to you and i and now it's our
[1:19:57] ministry
[1:19:59] hallelujah who wants a ministry
[1:20:01] every one of us ought to be lifting the
[1:20:03] hands saying i want a ministry i want to
[1:20:05] minister of this supernatural life of
[1:20:09] jesus christ now look this is what
[1:20:12] produced hebrews 11. you read your bible
[1:20:15] go through hebrews 11 and look at this
[1:20:17] it was by faith but my brother and
[1:20:18] sister what built faith
[1:20:21] an abstract god an invisible god a god
[1:20:24] who never answered a prayer a god who
[1:20:26] never spoke to his people no sir my
[1:20:28] brother and sister what produced hebrews
[1:20:30] 11 was a god that was so real to these
[1:20:33] people that they would walk through the
[1:20:35] fire they would go to the lion's den
[1:20:37] they would do whatever it is that god
[1:20:39] ordained for them and set in order
[1:20:42] because they had no fear
[1:20:44] because they knew they were part of
[1:20:46] god's ministry
[1:20:48] and they knew that whatever the word
[1:20:49] said god would back it up
[1:20:51] we ought to have that kind of courage
[1:20:53] today saints now you got to understand
[1:20:55] this is not like i'm going to stand up
[1:20:56] here and boast boy if i was
[1:20:58] ever thrown in a lion's den
[1:21:03] i tell you what i would do
[1:21:06] no that's not what it's about
[1:21:12] if the lions eat me it's the will of god
[1:21:17] and if the lions lay down in the corner
[1:21:20] it's the will of god
[1:21:22] if they take me to a fiery furnace
[1:21:26] and i go up in flames it is the will of
[1:21:29] god
[1:21:31] if i walk out
[1:21:33] untouched without even the smell
[1:21:36] it is the will of god
[1:21:38] you see we have to have that submission
[1:21:41] before we really truly will have the
[1:21:43] faith
[1:21:44] when we face it
[1:21:46] to stand upon it
[1:21:48] and when we have submitted to the word
[1:21:50] of god go study the message how many
[1:21:52] times that brother brown speaks on those
[1:21:55] things they're literally
[1:21:56] in the hundreds
[1:21:57] my brother and sister
[1:21:59] but you see each one of those if you was
[1:22:01] there facing what they did in hebrews 11
[1:22:05] you would say man life is hard we can
[1:22:07] read it today and say oh they subdued
[1:22:09] lions and they did this and they did
[1:22:11] this and by faith that's wonderful we
[1:22:13] have faith but my brother and sister
[1:22:15] they were rugged christians and i want
[1:22:18] to encourage you today that in you is
[1:22:21] the same faith that god placed in them
[1:22:24] and when god brings you to the time and
[1:22:26] the place he will ignite that faith in
[1:22:29] you and as it were a new book amen you
[1:22:32] could be written in there because you'll
[1:22:34] stand on that i'm telling you my brother
[1:22:36] and sister were coming into a time we're
[1:22:38] coming into a world uh just reading a
[1:22:41] little a little deal and they're talking
[1:22:43] about cities like chicago and milwaukee
[1:22:46] and and different places like that uh
[1:22:48] baltimore new york city the violence has
[1:22:51] escalated that people literally uh
[1:22:54] reading this this lady says i used to
[1:22:56] take my children for a walk in the
[1:22:58] evenings and now we make sure we're
[1:23:01] inside our house with the doors locked
[1:23:05] when the sun goes down
[1:23:07] we're afraid to go outside in our own
[1:23:10] yard
[1:23:11] now my brother and sister this
[1:23:14] is prophecy coming to pass
[1:23:16] we are seeing not just because of the
[1:23:18] violence but it's of the nature of the
[1:23:20] spirit that is there and we're seeing
[1:23:22] that but it is in this season god called
[1:23:25] for you and i to put him on display now
[1:23:28] you know brother branham put god on
[1:23:30] trial right and uh you know some people
[1:23:32] just get all critical you know i i've
[1:23:34] heard comments before about that was
[1:23:36] arrogant for him to preach that but my
[1:23:38] brother and sister do you realize every
[1:23:40] time you come face to face with
[1:23:41] something in your life you put god on
[1:23:43] trial
[1:23:44] every time you come face to face with
[1:23:48] you might call an emergency or a
[1:23:49] situation in your life you put god on
[1:23:52] trial because you're either believing
[1:23:54] what he spoke or you're not and when you
[1:23:57] don't believe you're telling him you
[1:24:00] believe he did not tell the truth and so
[1:24:02] there it is every single day of your
[1:24:04] life you put god on trial amen so that's
[1:24:08] what we see my brother and sister uh of
[1:24:10] how this we are called to display christ
[1:24:13] not fear
[1:24:14] you realize my brother and sister now
[1:24:16] this is just kind of rhetoric in a sense
[1:24:18] now forgive me but you realize what is
[1:24:20] happening in the land that we're living
[1:24:22] in right now
[1:24:23] there is such a spirit of fear
[1:24:27] has crept in our nation
[1:24:30] now
[1:24:32] if it was something else it would reach
[1:24:33] the headlines but people are being
[1:24:35] bullied shoved down knocked down
[1:24:38] assaulted in grocery stores and walmart
[1:24:40] and whatever you might have got that in
[1:24:42] walmart anyhow but anyway that why
[1:24:44] because they're not wearing a mask
[1:24:49] you see the spirit of the ages setting
[1:24:51] the store that i'm against you and
[1:24:52] you're against me and everyone's against
[1:24:54] everyone and that is the spirit of the
[1:24:56] day
[1:24:58] satan's been trying to do that in the
[1:24:59] church
[1:25:00] of almighty god
[1:25:02] for thousands of
[1:25:04] thousands of years
[1:25:06] and he's not going to accomplish that
[1:25:08] because true believers will always come
[1:25:09] back to the word and the word unites
[1:25:12] the word has a uniting quality right
[1:25:15] amen
[1:25:16] so i want to just hurry and move on now
[1:25:19] in first john the third chapter
[1:25:21] amen uh behold what manner of love
[1:25:25] the father hath
[1:25:27] amen if you'll change that brother ivan
[1:25:29] what manner of love the father hath
[1:25:31] bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:25:34] called the sons of god therefore the
[1:25:36] world knoweth us not because it knew him
[1:25:39] not
[1:25:40] now i want you to just look at this what
[1:25:42] manner of love it's almost in a sense a
[1:25:45] question what manner of love not not
[1:25:48] superficial not just a a slight dose as
[1:25:51] it were but a great outpouring that he'd
[1:25:55] bestowed and when something is bestowed
[1:25:57] upon you it's as a present
[1:25:59] an honor a gift amen so this is not
[1:26:02] earned by good works
[1:26:05] it's not something
[1:26:06] but good works accomplishes it
[1:26:09] you have never seen a true holy
[1:26:11] ghost-filled christian that did not have
[1:26:13] good works accompanying his life
[1:26:17] if we say we have the holy ghost and we
[1:26:20] are snide and petty you know a common
[1:26:22] term they use in the day we live in now
[1:26:24] your snark
[1:26:26] and say you got the holy ghost you're
[1:26:28] combative
[1:26:30] you're judgmental
[1:26:31] my brother and sister come on the rubber
[1:26:33] to the road okay is that okay
[1:26:35] you can't you can't be of those
[1:26:36] behaviors and say i have the holy ghost
[1:26:39] you can't have a buzz saw temper and say
[1:26:42] i have the holy ghost you can't have a
[1:26:44] loose liberal life and say i have the
[1:26:46] holy ghost because it does not fit the
[1:26:48] nature of god
[1:26:50] and so if it does not fit the nature of
[1:26:52] god it didn't come from god but he says
[1:26:54] behold what manner of love the father
[1:26:57] hath bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:27:00] called the sons of god
[1:27:02] what a gift that we can come and accept
[1:27:07] he has spoken and said you are my sons
[1:27:09] you're my daughters
[1:27:11] you see that that is so beautiful
[1:27:14] james 1 17
[1:27:17] says that every good gift
[1:27:20] and every perfect gift is from above
[1:27:23] and cometh down from the father of light
[1:27:26] with whom
[1:27:27] is no variableness
[1:27:29] neither shadow of turning
[1:27:31] you know we live in a day my brother and
[1:27:33] sister right the scripture says that a
[1:27:35] double-minded man is
[1:27:37] unstable or
[1:27:38] double-minded in all of his works so you
[1:27:41] can't be just double-minded over here
[1:27:43] and not be double-minded over there you
[1:27:45] you got to make up your mind you know
[1:27:47] what what it is you're going to do and
[1:27:49] be what it is and so this good gift that
[1:27:52] god has given this perfect gift that god
[1:27:54] has given to us uh to be able to be
[1:27:56] called sons and daughters of god this is
[1:27:58] actually a gift that came down from
[1:27:59] heaven people say well you know i
[1:28:01] haven't really seen god do anything in
[1:28:03] my life but look you've been given this
[1:28:06] gift my brother and sister
[1:28:07] and it come down from the father there's
[1:28:10] no variableness
[1:28:11] look in our
[1:28:12] nation
[1:28:14] look at our nation saints
[1:28:17] we're headed so many different
[1:28:18] directions we don't know what direction
[1:28:19] we're headed
[1:28:21] kick them out do you realize i want you
[1:28:23] to catch the irony of this i'm not going
[1:28:25] into the political thing of it but the
[1:28:27] irony of it at the process right now
[1:28:30] they're letting people across the border
[1:28:32] by by thousands a day at the same time
[1:28:35] homeland security is burning millions of
[1:28:38] dollars deporting people
[1:28:41] so is this an exchange program
[1:28:45] you see the double-mindedness of this
[1:28:48] and it comes that we're going to protect
[1:28:51] religious freedom until we don't
[1:28:54] and i could cite you many court cases
[1:28:56] right now where they have not protected
[1:28:58] religious freedom at all
[1:29:00] in others the government goes overboard
[1:29:02] to protect it
[1:29:04] you realize down in california there's a
[1:29:06] satanist group that the neighbors
[1:29:08] started complaining about their behavior
[1:29:10] and actions and what was going on there
[1:29:12] and the courts have ruled that because
[1:29:14] that house is their temple that they are
[1:29:17] allowed to worship there
[1:29:20] while throwing chain link fences around
[1:29:22] houses of god across the nation and
[1:29:24] saying
[1:29:25] you defied our coveted rules
[1:29:29] well i'm sure the devil made all the
[1:29:31] covet rules
[1:29:33] because that's the devil he's into
[1:29:35] obeying the rules
[1:29:41] you see
[1:29:43] here
[1:29:45] jumping back to our
[1:29:47] scripture first john 3
[1:29:49] beloved we are now the sons of god
[1:29:52] and it doth not yet appear what we shall
[1:29:55] be
[1:30:00] what will we be when we get on the other
[1:30:02] side
[1:30:05] who will we look like
[1:30:07] what will it be will we be the same
[1:30:09] person
[1:30:12] or will we be like
[1:30:13] a more perfect version of me
[1:30:20] the lord says you don't you don't know
[1:30:28] now we are sons of god and it does not
[1:30:30] yet appear what we shall be
[1:30:32] but we know that when he shall appear we
[1:30:34] shall be like him
[1:30:36] for we shall see him as he is
[1:30:42] you can tie this directly back john 1
[1:30:45] he's the word
[1:30:47] and the word in you my brother and
[1:30:49] sister is not a different version of the
[1:30:51] word
[1:30:52] this has to be the very version that is
[1:30:55] god himself almighty jehovah shaddai
[1:30:59] and when the word meets the word my
[1:31:01] brother and sister there won't be a
[1:31:03] discrepancy so don't worry about what
[1:31:05] your name will be people get all caught
[1:31:07] up oh you know the vision brother
[1:31:09] branham said a new name and what's that
[1:31:11] going to be and people went all into
[1:31:12] deals and i remember i was a young man
[1:31:15] at this time when this swept through the
[1:31:16] message and people were down at the
[1:31:18] courthouse changing their names well my
[1:31:20] name was fred but now it's daniel
[1:31:23] and my name was this but now it's
[1:31:25] solomon
[1:31:26] my name was this but it's now
[1:31:28] israel well i'm sorry my brother and
[1:31:31] sister changing your name in the natural
[1:31:33] if you have a name that means rat or
[1:31:36] something like that i can understand
[1:31:38] changing your name
[1:31:39] but you see this is not what it's about
[1:31:41] because you see we're being identified
[1:31:43] and what we are becoming not what we're
[1:31:45] becoming what we are
[1:31:47] is the word
[1:31:48] we are the word made manifest in the day
[1:31:52] that we are living and so what we are as
[1:31:54] the prophet of god talked about us being
[1:31:56] many messiahs and it's funny because you
[1:31:59] go study that out and people are like oh
[1:32:01] these people believe that cultist stuff
[1:32:03] not even talking about the message
[1:32:05] that cultist stuff they believe that
[1:32:07] they're sons of god they believe that
[1:32:10] they're many messiahs
[1:32:12] well they ought to read their bible with
[1:32:13] a little revelation and realize that we
[1:32:15] are being molded in the very image of
[1:32:17] god and if we are in the very image of
[1:32:20] god my brother and sister we will be
[1:32:22] what god is
[1:32:24] and so we will be what it is and so
[1:32:26] while we are here in the flesh not
[1:32:28] knowing really what we are sometimes oh
[1:32:31] am i am i you know am i christian even
[1:32:33] some days you feel that way you know and
[1:32:36] i don't know but we know that when he
[1:32:38] shall appear we shall be just like him
[1:32:41] because the word that is in you is the
[1:32:44] word that is him it can't be a different
[1:32:47] word
[1:32:48] hallelujah
[1:32:50] no variableness of turning in our lord
[1:32:52] jesus christ for we shall see him as he
[1:32:55] is and when you recognize the word here
[1:32:57] today when you are here in this life
[1:33:00] recognizing the word of god and saying
[1:33:02] amen to it you will recognize jesus
[1:33:06] christ when you see him amen there were
[1:33:08] those we could go back and draw this out
[1:33:10] through through the old testament uh
[1:33:13] bringing it right into the new testament
[1:33:15] my brother and sister when these people
[1:33:17] came in the presence of almighty god
[1:33:19] they were those that when they came in
[1:33:22] his presence they knew who they were
[1:33:24] dealing with and we sometimes speak on
[1:33:27] the woman at the well and we just like
[1:33:28] yeah we know that story we know that
[1:33:30] story but my brother and sister do you
[1:33:32] recognize the revelation that come to
[1:33:34] that young lady because as he starts to
[1:33:37] speak to her now you can look at that
[1:33:39] and at first it seems as he's kind of
[1:33:41] downing her you know that i'm not
[1:33:43] supposed to serve you we're supposed to
[1:33:44] be separate get the water anyway
[1:33:48] as he starts to speak to her
[1:33:51] her mind
[1:33:52] oh
[1:33:53] come on let's catch this
[1:33:56] sometimes we think that
[1:33:58] well she was a young woman so we're just
[1:34:00] using one
[1:34:01] young woman sometimes we think oh this
[1:34:04] young woman went out
[1:34:06] she's had all these men in her life
[1:34:09] oh that is so horrible
[1:34:12] that's so horrible
[1:34:14] do you know she knew the word
[1:34:18] when he started to speak to her
[1:34:21] she said
[1:34:23] that
[1:34:24] is a sign of the messiah
[1:34:26] that is what will be spoken that is what
[1:34:29] will be done when the messiah comes
[1:34:33] she wasn't ignorant she wasn't some
[1:34:35] trash-hopping bum that was a drop out or
[1:34:38] whatever it is she had been raised in an
[1:34:40] environment that she knew the word but
[1:34:43] circumstances of her life but look how
[1:34:45] god come right down and said nope she
[1:34:47] always was my daughter and he comes
[1:34:49] right down and he speaks to her and she
[1:34:51] goes into the city and when she goes in
[1:34:53] the city she starts telling them oh come
[1:34:55] and see the man who told me all i've
[1:34:57] ever done and they didn't go out in the
[1:34:59] street and throw pumpkins and tomatoes
[1:35:01] at her and say oh you lying no good
[1:35:03] piece of trash they saw something
[1:35:06] that quick immediate change in her eye a
[1:35:09] presence she was speaking of something
[1:35:11] and they might have said well you know
[1:35:12] that was sister so's daughter she was
[1:35:15] raised in church
[1:35:18] didn't keep her from going out there
[1:35:20] but god didn't let her go
[1:35:22] hold her right back amen hallelujah
[1:35:25] you see so it is we shall see him as he
[1:35:27] is the word
[1:35:29] and every man my brother and sister that
[1:35:31] ever knows the word will recognize jesus
[1:35:33] christ brother brown speaks about this
[1:35:35] but we don't even have to go into the
[1:35:36] message to see that it's all through the
[1:35:38] bible pointing pointing pointing to
[1:35:41] these things
[1:35:42] to recognize that when you are able to
[1:35:46] let's say amen to the word of god and
[1:35:48] instead of contesting or fighting or
[1:35:50] pushing against it or trying to
[1:35:52] interpret it just to stop and say lord i
[1:35:54] surrender now please lead me to all
[1:35:57] truth you made a promise i want all
[1:35:59] truth amen hallelujah how many of you
[1:36:02] are selfish when it comes to that i want
[1:36:04] all truth i don't want a portion of
[1:36:05] truth i don't want just something out
[1:36:07] here i want the pure unadulterated word
[1:36:11] of god i don't need to look at some
[1:36:13] great man on the earth today i don't
[1:36:16] need to elevate somebody and say oh if
[1:36:18] they said it and that it's got to be
[1:36:20] right i tell you i've got something that
[1:36:23] has been elevated in my presence and i
[1:36:25] can take the things of this life i can
[1:36:28] take men's words i can take dictums from
[1:36:30] governments and whatever and i've got a
[1:36:32] filter to run it through and that filter
[1:36:34] speaks to me and says that is the truth
[1:36:37] or that is a lie amen
[1:36:39] almost every bit
[1:36:41] of lies
[1:36:42] have a majority of truth
[1:36:45] hallelujah amen i've got a text
[1:36:49] hey paul
[1:36:51] you paid your
[1:36:53] att bill for august
[1:36:57] open this site for a reward
[1:37:01] and i don't know how long we've had cell
[1:37:03] phones well i'm just going to say 25
[1:37:05] years
[1:37:06] at t has never said thank you
[1:37:10] for paying them
[1:37:12] so somebody's a little scammed that they
[1:37:14] have sent me
[1:37:15] if i push on that thing and whatever
[1:37:18] would happen after that my brother and
[1:37:19] sister
[1:37:20] they told the truth
[1:37:22] we paid our bill in august
[1:37:26] see most of it was a lie what they
[1:37:27] didn't tell you is what they're going to
[1:37:29] do to you afterwards
[1:37:31] hallelujah
[1:37:33] look if we're going to recognize christ
[1:37:36] we've got to be in the pure word of god
[1:37:39] we can't have something that's confused
[1:37:41] or whatever now look here let's go
[1:37:44] uh and to move forward brothers to uh
[1:37:47] when their eyes were open i've had this
[1:37:50] book in my chopper and as sometimes
[1:37:52] trucks don't come back promptly i've
[1:37:54] been reading this and it really
[1:37:57] really uh spoke to my heart and i hope
[1:37:59] it does to yours
[1:38:01] wouldn't you like to took a trip with
[1:38:03] cleopas and them on the road to emmaus
[1:38:06] can we take a poll who would like to
[1:38:08] have been there
[1:38:09] i would like to have been there i would
[1:38:11] have liked to that was a supernatural
[1:38:14] event that took place
[1:38:16] jesus christ walking right in their
[1:38:19] midst
[1:38:20] and they didn't even recognize him
[1:38:24] this goes to show you that see when when
[1:38:26] your eyes are veiled
[1:38:29] even though you're a believer you're
[1:38:30] going to walk right with the presence of
[1:38:32] god
[1:38:34] you don't see it
[1:38:36] god help us revelation
[1:38:38] i want to know him i want to recognize
[1:38:40] him when i see him
[1:38:41] i'd like to walk with them and it's
[1:38:44] possible
[1:38:45] i'm glad to be living today that i can
[1:38:47] still do the same thing walk with him
[1:38:49] today just the same
[1:38:51] as they did
[1:38:55] the thought of it
[1:38:56] was how that jesus had raised up from
[1:38:58] the dead but the sad part of it was that
[1:39:00] some of them who loved him didn't know
[1:39:02] it
[1:39:03] and there's a certainly not certainly a
[1:39:05] picture of today there is many people
[1:39:07] who love him who doesn't yet realize
[1:39:10] that he is alive there is some kind of a
[1:39:13] history that they have learned in some
[1:39:16] school
[1:39:17] it's some book of theology some ethics
[1:39:19] some code of ethics that they studied
[1:39:22] somewhere and jesus is a historical
[1:39:25] figure to them
[1:39:28] now that just seems
[1:39:30] like almost impossible right
[1:39:36] without going any further detail i'll
[1:39:38] just tell you saints
[1:39:40] within the last couple years i've
[1:39:42] experienced individuals
[1:39:45] making statements
[1:39:46] that lined perfectly
[1:39:49] with this
[1:39:52] now let me make a point here i'm not
[1:39:53] pointing to myself but i want to make
[1:39:55] this point
[1:39:57] that
[1:39:58] is a witness to me
[1:40:01] that this statement
[1:40:03] is correct
[1:40:09] somebody say i've never heard anybody
[1:40:11] say that
[1:40:12] well
[1:40:14] trust me if you will don't if you don't
[1:40:17] but i can stand as a witness before man
[1:40:19] and god
[1:40:21] that people
[1:40:23] are still anointed
[1:40:24] with these same spirits
[1:40:27] they're still caught under that same
[1:40:30] influence
[1:40:34] some kind of a history that they have
[1:40:35] learned in some school some book of
[1:40:37] theology some ethics code of ethics that
[1:40:40] they studied somewhere and jesus christ
[1:40:42] is this historical figure to them
[1:40:45] and yet in the history
[1:40:47] they love him
[1:40:49] and don't realize that he is alive with
[1:40:52] us walking right around with us
[1:40:55] just as he always did he is here just
[1:40:57] the same as he ever was
[1:41:00] now you look at this my brother and
[1:41:01] sister if he's walking with us
[1:41:05] i don't think any of us had too hard
[1:41:07] wrapping our mind around going down the
[1:41:09] road to emmaus and the fact that it was
[1:41:12] jesus christ
[1:41:14] walking with him we look at that we look
[1:41:16] back in this historicalness of the bible
[1:41:19] and realize this took place these two
[1:41:22] men they were not unbelievers just
[1:41:24] coming to the gospel they were believers
[1:41:27] who were confused at the very things
[1:41:31] that had already been prophesied and
[1:41:34] preached to them they thought they
[1:41:36] understood what jesus meant but they
[1:41:38] didn't really
[1:41:40] right
[1:41:41] and jesus says um okay
[1:41:45] oh foolish and
[1:41:47] slow of heart that would have
[1:41:49] flaked off a whole bunch of people right
[1:41:50] there
[1:41:51] they went this guy called me a fool and
[1:41:53] i'm not a fool and i'm not slow of heart
[1:41:55] i'm out of here
[1:41:56] but you see there was something in there
[1:41:58] that was attracting them to the word
[1:42:01] they didn't even recognize that the word
[1:42:03] was walking in their midst but the word
[1:42:05] was being spoken to them and they were
[1:42:08] not attracted this is a problem we have
[1:42:09] in the day that we live in there is a
[1:42:11] messenger that comes and he speaks the
[1:42:13] word and the people are attracted to the
[1:42:15] messenger and miss the fact that it's
[1:42:18] god that's speaking
[1:42:19] amen so it's got to be that we are there
[1:42:23] and they were attracted to the word
[1:42:25] you see at that point in that story
[1:42:27] there's nothing about who the man was
[1:42:29] his description what defined him the
[1:42:32] cloak he was wearing
[1:42:34] you know his hair his looks none of that
[1:42:36] stuff
[1:42:37] it was the word
[1:42:40] and we can verify that that it was the
[1:42:42] breaking of the bread the word
[1:42:44] that opened their eyes
[1:42:47] are you with me
[1:42:48] amen
[1:42:54] hallelujah yet in history they love him
[1:42:57] didn't realize he is alive with us
[1:43:00] walking right around with us hallelujah
[1:43:05] you know i did something stupid
[1:43:06] yesterday and hurt myself
[1:43:11] god was right there with me
[1:43:15] why did god allow that to happen
[1:43:18] wouldn't he have
[1:43:20] kept me from my own stupidity
[1:43:27] no sorry
[1:43:29] i just love free moral agency
[1:43:31] i'm in the house of god today because i
[1:43:33] wanted to be here
[1:43:34] amen i worship the lord i sing praises
[1:43:37] to the lord because i want to
[1:43:38] there is no dictum that says you will do
[1:43:41] this and you will do this and will oh
[1:43:43] there is
[1:43:44] man wrote it though
[1:43:46] god didn't
[1:43:48] god says you know what
[1:43:50] satan do anything you want to and just
[1:43:52] don't take his life
[1:43:53] you realize the hedge that's been opened
[1:43:55] up around you
[1:43:57] god could give you all kinds of stuff
[1:43:59] you say well hallelujah i have this
[1:44:02] problem well i'm sorry you know if you
[1:44:04] drink 500 gallons of soda pop it'll do
[1:44:06] that to you
[1:44:07] amen
[1:44:08] you know you you do this here you leap
[1:44:10] off of tall buildings you know and it
[1:44:12] hurts then uh you know that that's what
[1:44:15] happens
[1:44:18] but god was with him now look
[1:44:20] my brother and sister when we start to
[1:44:22] behave i don't think there'd be anybody
[1:44:24] in this building this morning or that
[1:44:25] might listen to this service would say
[1:44:27] oh i believe in a historical god then
[1:44:28] why do we act like he's a historical god
[1:44:31] you see with our lips we would confess
[1:44:33] one thing oh no no he's here ever
[1:44:36] present oh can i
[1:44:37] can i just vent for a moment
[1:44:40] somebody raise their hand and say paul
[1:44:42] you can vent
[1:44:45] why saints
[1:44:47] do we go out in the foyer or out in the
[1:44:49] parking lot
[1:44:51] and we go oh yeah
[1:44:54] i've got this deal right here in this
[1:44:56] disaster right there and this thing here
[1:44:58] and the doctor says this
[1:45:01] come on i hope this smarts a little bit
[1:45:02] i want it to be do you know there's not
[1:45:04] a single prayer request
[1:45:06] concerning those things
[1:45:08] you say well it's personal well you just
[1:45:10] shared it with the whole church because
[1:45:11] you know if this one told that one that
[1:45:13] one told that one that one told me it's
[1:45:15] not necessarily gossip
[1:45:18] might be close
[1:45:19] but you see saints look i hope you
[1:45:21] understand my point
[1:45:23] we we're we're talking about it as
[1:45:25] though yeah when we go through this i'll
[1:45:28] have physical therapy i'll have this
[1:45:29] i'll have that i go the doctor put me on
[1:45:31] this pill all the
[1:45:33] and we're acting like god's no longer a
[1:45:35] healer
[1:45:37] we're acting like god's not really
[1:45:40] interested in what's happening in our
[1:45:42] little things in our life
[1:45:44] so therefore we put it as though
[1:45:46] this is historical god he'll get to it
[1:45:49] when he gets to it
[1:45:50] i'm sorry saints there are some things i
[1:45:53] got a prayer request in today pretty
[1:45:54] vague isn't it remember what brother
[1:45:56] chris preached about them unspoken
[1:45:58] prayer requests but i think some of you
[1:46:00] don't want me to really tell you what's
[1:46:02] that prayer request
[1:46:04] my brother and sister i expect god to
[1:46:06] answer those
[1:46:08] i am not speaking in vagueness because i
[1:46:10] just don't do it's because it doesn't
[1:46:12] pertain to me these these unspoken and
[1:46:15] these burdens on my heart they're not me
[1:46:17] my wife my children my brother and
[1:46:19] sister they're things that i see as a
[1:46:21] pastor that my heart is aching to see
[1:46:24] something change and i want it to be
[1:46:26] before you as a body that you would be
[1:46:28] faithful and say you know what brother
[1:46:30] paul's got something that's bothering
[1:46:32] him and if it's important enough for him
[1:46:35] to share it with the church it's
[1:46:37] important enough for me to pray about it
[1:46:40] why because i believe in the power of
[1:46:42] prayer of the saints
[1:46:43] amen
[1:46:45] no we don't put these out here just as
[1:46:47] something oh i put in a prayer request
[1:46:48] praise the lord i expect results right
[1:46:51] i'm expecting god to come on this scene
[1:46:53] and touch some of you
[1:46:55] things that i see that's happening in
[1:46:57] your lives and i don't believe it's good
[1:46:59] my brother and sister and i want god to
[1:47:01] come on the scene and do that do we need
[1:47:03] to humiliate everybody and like oh i
[1:47:05] think uh brother so-and-so and sister so
[1:47:07] and so and then and you're not doing
[1:47:09] this and you're not doing no my brother
[1:47:10] and sister i want to give god the
[1:47:12] liberty and i believe in the power of
[1:47:15] prayer that god will change that
[1:47:17] because the last thing on earth i would
[1:47:19] do
[1:47:21] maybe i would need to be checked even to
[1:47:23] bring up
[1:47:26] what i said sister emmy
[1:47:28] i said that in humor in case some of you
[1:47:31] missed
[1:47:32] my warped humor
[1:47:36] we're not here to humiliate
[1:47:39] you know what i like nothing better
[1:47:41] saints
[1:47:43] then we get on the other side
[1:47:46] to look up
[1:47:48] god bless you
[1:47:50] oh right
[1:47:52] i can't believe people might say oh i
[1:47:54] can't believe we made it brother paul
[1:47:56] it'll be brother paul going i can't
[1:47:57] believe i made it
[1:48:00] but i believe i was called
[1:48:02] and i'm going to do my very best to live
[1:48:04] it
[1:48:05] amen because i believe it
[1:48:07] amen it's not a story to me it's not
[1:48:09] historical
[1:48:11] see so in history they love him but they
[1:48:13] don't realize he's alive with us right
[1:48:15] here
[1:48:16] now look my brother and sister let me
[1:48:17] put it this way just a little little um
[1:48:20] oh my mind won't wrap around what it is
[1:48:22] here just a little paradox
[1:48:26] i encounter people
[1:48:28] that definitely without a doubt view god
[1:48:30] in a historical fashion
[1:48:33] but the god who is the ever-present help
[1:48:36] in the time of trouble
[1:48:38] cannot be a historical god
[1:48:41] he's got to be a god
[1:48:42] who is present
[1:48:44] right here right now that's right
[1:48:48] you know when i was
[1:48:49] about 17
[1:48:51] i might have been 18 at the time
[1:48:54] backslid
[1:48:55] still went to church kind of because i
[1:48:57] lived in my parents home
[1:49:00] that was something i respected but
[1:49:02] without a doubt backslid
[1:49:04] you know we were driving the highway's
[1:49:06] totally different you wouldn't wouldn't
[1:49:08] recognize it for what it is now but when
[1:49:10] you go south on 95 to go into oregon and
[1:49:12] nevada that road used to have some
[1:49:15] twists and winds and
[1:49:17] uh winding parts and a man ran off the
[1:49:20] road and got out of his car
[1:49:22] ran out in the road in front he was
[1:49:24] afraid we was going to hit his car i ran
[1:49:26] out in front of my brother and i my
[1:49:28] brother was driving we spun down the
[1:49:29] highway
[1:49:32] the pickup
[1:49:35] went over the bank
[1:49:39] and all i remember is god
[1:49:43] help me
[1:49:47] 240 feet in an angle like that into the
[1:49:50] bottom of a ravine
[1:49:54] in a rock this big wedged in the wheel
[1:49:56] of a pickup
[1:49:58] and stopped it
[1:50:03] sure glad that wasn't a historical god
[1:50:08] i'm sure glad it was a god
[1:50:10] that was present
[1:50:12] right with me even in that condition
[1:50:16] amen at that time
[1:50:18] you know they come along in the state
[1:50:21] snowplow says i it's against the law for
[1:50:23] me to hook onto your vehicle
[1:50:28] my brother said well sir
[1:50:30] i guess you'll either hook on it
[1:50:33] or we'll retrieve it out of the bottom
[1:50:34] of that ravine and
[1:50:36] the man goes well i sure hate to see
[1:50:39] your pickup do that and
[1:50:41] he literally looked around at a couple
[1:50:42] witnesses there and the first guy goes i
[1:50:44] didn't see nothing i didn't hear nothing
[1:50:47] other guy said me either the guy turned
[1:50:50] his truck around hooked a cable on it
[1:50:51] pulled the pickup up
[1:50:53] and i watched the rock saints
[1:50:56] see this is real i get to testify this i
[1:50:58] get to share this from my heart as a
[1:51:01] real witness just a rock that was no
[1:51:03] bigger than that and the minute
[1:51:07] one ounce of pressure was pulled against
[1:51:09] that pickup that rock rolled out from
[1:51:11] underneath that tire
[1:51:13] and fell into the canyon
[1:51:17] this is not a rock that was anchored
[1:51:19] deep in the mountain unmovable
[1:51:23] now you tell me on a slope like that
[1:51:26] how a rock that big on the surface
[1:51:29] would stop a pickup that went off the
[1:51:32] edge
[1:51:35] i knew at that time
[1:51:37] i knew at that time
[1:51:39] that god would hear my prayers
[1:51:41] and i wasn't even serving it took me a
[1:51:43] few more years
[1:51:46] my almost 20 more
[1:51:50] to give my heart to the lord but you see
[1:51:52] i can stand here today and testify to
[1:51:54] you young people to brothers and sisters
[1:51:56] god's an ever present god
[1:51:59] in the time of your trouble
[1:52:02] he didn't have to stop and say well now
[1:52:04] let me get back to him
[1:52:06] we'd have been piled up in the baltimore
[1:52:08] canyon right there just deader than dead
[1:52:09] unless a miracle that took place
[1:52:12] you see i believe this word that i
[1:52:13] preached to you saints amen
[1:52:17] now look going on in here
[1:52:21] let's go on in here where am i
[1:52:24] sorry
[1:52:26] oh my we got to wrap this up somebody
[1:52:28] press the turbo button
[1:52:31] amen
[1:52:33] and the reason they didn't believe it is
[1:52:35] because the resurrection was too unusual
[1:52:37] see there was they hadn't happened
[1:52:39] before it was unusual thing for them to
[1:52:42] believe something like that and the
[1:52:43] unusualness is where god lays see
[1:52:46] christ's birth was unusual a virgin
[1:52:48] shall confuse uh conceive god is always
[1:52:51] unusual he does unusual thing but it's
[1:52:54] always according to his word he never
[1:52:57] does anything outside of his words so
[1:52:59] unusual because he promises at first
[1:53:02] then he sends somebody to manifest that
[1:53:04] word to make it real to people now i
[1:53:07] want you to look at this my brother and
[1:53:08] sister i don't care who you are here
[1:53:10] this morning because i actually don't
[1:53:12] know what all of you believe or what the
[1:53:14] innermost thoughts are that's between
[1:53:16] you and the lord it's not for me to pry
[1:53:18] into but if you can't take what you
[1:53:21] believe and run it right back through
[1:53:23] this bible and confirm every line of it
[1:53:26] you need to stop and examine where
[1:53:28] you're at with your life amen because
[1:53:30] here is a very word of god and we don't
[1:53:33] have to say oh that's so because brother
[1:53:34] branham said in a quote we can take you
[1:53:36] to ample scripture right i am god and i
[1:53:39] change not amen there's just all kinds
[1:53:41] of scriptures we won't go there but all
[1:53:43] kinds of scriptures that god is
[1:53:45] immovable amen he doesn't have something
[1:53:48] today and something new tomorrow that's
[1:53:51] one of the things i personally have
[1:53:52] against the religious world we live in
[1:53:54] they keep morphing we've got to loosen
[1:53:57] the standard to attract the young people
[1:53:59] we've got to do this to get the family
[1:54:02] we've got to have a fun night for this
[1:54:04] and we've got to do this for that and my
[1:54:07] brother and sister what is
[1:54:09] the whole
[1:54:13] what is the real word of god
[1:54:16] what matters to a son or daughter of god
[1:54:18] not
[1:54:19] what feels good not what looks good not
[1:54:22] what sounds good although the true word
[1:54:26] will bring that reaction to every one of
[1:54:28] us
[1:54:30] but we can't go for that feeling
[1:54:33] but it's always according to his word he
[1:54:35] never does nothing outside of his word
[1:54:37] and so unusual because he promises it
[1:54:40] first then sends someone to manifest
[1:54:43] that word to make it real to people now
[1:54:45] let's look we can go down through the
[1:54:47] bible and we can see god sends prophets
[1:54:50] right to make the word known to the
[1:54:51] people amen is that word
[1:54:54] only for the prophet to manifest
[1:55:00] come on i want you to think about this
[1:55:02] if it was only
[1:55:04] for the prophet to manifest
[1:55:07] wouldn't god just give it to the prophet
[1:55:10] and it go no further
[1:55:13] why through the ages let's just not look
[1:55:15] in the day that we live and don't go
[1:55:16] back into 20th century coming forward to
[1:55:19] now and say oh this is different no my
[1:55:21] brother and sister god works by patterns
[1:55:23] and so god has never just given the word
[1:55:26] for the prophets to the prophets to go
[1:55:28] over here and they got their great big
[1:55:30] old brunswick safe and they open that
[1:55:32] thing with the combo and open it up and
[1:55:34] take the revealed word and stick it in
[1:55:36] there and say that was for me no what do
[1:55:38] they do they expend their lives
[1:55:41] are you with me they expend their lives
[1:55:43] they go through great oh you say well
[1:55:45] brother paul i don't know how that is
[1:55:46] look you just study it and i'll tell you
[1:55:48] what if you've ever ministered you've
[1:55:49] ever been in conventions you've ever
[1:55:51] been places where the devil is working
[1:55:53] right there and you can see it happening
[1:55:55] and you say that's not a labor no i tell
[1:55:57] you what i have said in back rooms when
[1:56:00] i preached in south america and knowing
[1:56:02] what i was going to face and was afraid
[1:56:06] but before i walk out the door to come
[1:56:07] to a platform say lord we're here for a
[1:56:10] purpose this purpose is not to lift some
[1:56:12] man up this is a purpose to defeat the
[1:56:15] devil and deliver god's people and see
[1:56:18] saints oh
[1:56:19] help me lord see people delivered of
[1:56:22] demons right there in front of you
[1:56:26] amen oh hallelujah i can't even express
[1:56:29] it to you
[1:56:30] because god is a on time god he's a god
[1:56:34] that's ever present
[1:56:35] amen it's not about the preacher amen so
[1:56:38] god didn't give that just a gift to a
[1:56:40] prophet for it to be a prophet to
[1:56:42] manifest but you study the first fruits
[1:56:44] if you have a revelation of the word and
[1:56:46] the first fruits you'll see my brother
[1:56:48] and sister whatever it was that came to
[1:56:50] the prophet was meant to pass as it were
[1:56:52] right the prophet's life had to line up
[1:56:54] with it but it was meant to be passed
[1:56:56] through that amen and what did it do it
[1:56:59] come right down that that word come to a
[1:57:01] people in a day and it was delivered to
[1:57:04] them i don't like the word explained
[1:57:07] now preachers often times explain things
[1:57:09] right but i don't really like the thing
[1:57:11] word explain because you see we can
[1:57:14] explain something
[1:57:16] and people catch a grasp of it
[1:57:18] but never have a revelation of it
[1:57:21] now they could explain to you oh i see
[1:57:24] it in scripture seven church ages
[1:57:27] but you see that's much
[1:57:28] deeper
[1:57:29] much much much much deeper
[1:57:32] amen
[1:57:33] now look at this
[1:57:34] can i have just a few more minutes
[1:57:36] would be okay
[1:57:38] now you're going to think that
[1:57:41] i've went off the edge here
[1:57:43] but he sends prophets to make it known
[1:57:44] to the people
[1:57:46] right is that what
[1:57:48] god said brother branham
[1:57:49] make it known to us
[1:57:51] look once again i want to say this do
[1:57:53] you realize if brother brown was a
[1:57:55] prophet like people look at prophets
[1:57:57] you would never know
[1:57:59] that he told his wife tell them i'm not
[1:58:02] here
[1:58:04] because we just don't go out
[1:58:06] and share
[1:58:08] our failures
[1:58:11] but you see what god required out of a
[1:58:12] prophet
[1:58:13] was transparency
[1:58:15] and what does god require out of his
[1:58:17] people
[1:58:19] transparency
[1:58:22] god doesn't want a people that hide
[1:58:23] their sin he said everything that was
[1:58:25] done in secret will be made known
[1:58:27] god wants transparency my brother and
[1:58:29] sister so what was this it passed
[1:58:31] through a prophet amen it was preached
[1:58:33] but it was here the word is for you and
[1:58:35] i to manifest that was the ultimate goal
[1:58:37] what if the message of the hour let me
[1:58:39] put it this way what if the message of
[1:58:41] the hour come and god speaks to a
[1:58:42] prophet and the prophet catches that
[1:58:44] revelation and he preaches that
[1:58:46] revelation and it does not produce one
[1:58:49] thing
[1:58:52] it doesn't manifest one thing
[1:58:55] think about that
[1:58:56] there'd be no reason to do it
[1:59:01] this word is for you and i to manifest
[1:59:03] are the prophets words good enough for
[1:59:04] us
[1:59:05] are they good enough for me i'll put it
[1:59:07] that way
[1:59:08] now look you're going to think i've just
[1:59:09] derailed it
[1:59:11] but you know have you ever seen the
[1:59:13] hamburger ads
[1:59:14] i'm thinking of wendy's
[1:59:18] you're looking at me like
[1:59:20] i know it's time to eat
[1:59:26] you ever watched
[1:59:27] a wendy's ad you ever seen a wendy's
[1:59:29] billboard
[1:59:31] a double meat
[1:59:34] cheddar cheese baconator
[1:59:41] and the hamburger
[1:59:43] is lined up perfect
[1:59:45] and the corners of the cheese are melted
[1:59:47] just enough they're all
[1:59:49] draped over the edge
[1:59:52] and you see
[1:59:54] the glimpse
[1:59:56] on all four corners of some tomato
[1:59:59] lettuce is there just right
[2:00:02] oh i can see the edge of a pickle
[2:00:06] oh
[2:00:07] it looks so good
[2:00:10] do you know what your double meat cheese
[2:00:12] baconator looks like when they actually
[2:00:14] give it to you
[2:00:18] that thing looks like it has went
[2:00:19] through a tornado and then been in a car
[2:00:21] wreck right afterwards
[2:00:24] and you know the reason why it's that
[2:00:26] way
[2:00:28] is because
[2:00:29] now i'm not picking on young people
[2:00:32] but that little high school or college
[2:00:34] kid
[2:00:35] has just looked at
[2:00:36] 3624 hamburgers today
[2:00:40] and it's just another hamburger
[2:00:42] and they will eat it
[2:00:51] i've watched
[2:00:53] in there in the evening
[2:00:56] and they're there
[2:00:57] zombies
[2:01:07] and i opened up my hamburger
[2:01:10] and the tomato was this big
[2:01:13] the pickle had to been the tip
[2:01:15] and the piece of cheese must have been
[2:01:17] the leftover of the deal because the
[2:01:19] patty's this big and the cheese is that
[2:01:21] big
[2:01:24] but they know
[2:01:26] you'll eat it
[2:01:32] what if that would be the gospel
[2:01:37] we're going to just throw something
[2:01:39] together
[2:01:40] you know i'm sitting up here thinking
[2:01:41] these people probably think i'm nuts
[2:01:43] they're probably like oh i want to shut
[2:01:44] up i want to get over i'm going to go
[2:01:45] home i've got plans
[2:01:48] i have something in my heart i have to
[2:01:49] my brother and sister this word is not
[2:01:52] just something i'll we've preached look
[2:01:53] we're on what part the redemptions
[2:01:56] manifestation part 55 55 sundays
[2:02:00] i spoke about the redemption
[2:02:03] being manifested
[2:02:06] god didn't take his word and just start
[2:02:07] throwing this together and say just
[2:02:09] throw it out there they'll eat it
[2:02:11] god wants it put together if god worked
[2:02:13] at wendy's my brother and sister every
[2:02:16] sandwich would be just as perfect as
[2:02:18] perfect could be because he doesn't want
[2:02:21] a subpar throw together word for the
[2:02:25] hour
[2:02:26] he wants a word that the people can look
[2:02:28] at this and say i can count on this i
[2:02:31] can give my life i can hang as it were
[2:02:34] over hell on this word knowing that it's
[2:02:37] perfect
[2:02:38] amen
[2:02:39] you see a perfect word from the throne
[2:02:41] of god and it's not just for a prophet
[2:02:44] to manifest it it was a word that was
[2:02:46] sent down so that we could come let us
[2:02:49] not church let us not fall back to the
[2:02:52] human element i know what the truth is
[2:02:54] i've heard the word preached for years
[2:02:56] but i have this person done this and
[2:02:59] this happened and that happened and
[2:03:00] therefore no go back to the perfect word
[2:03:04] what does the perfect word say it's not
[2:03:06] about that church and that church and
[2:03:08] this ministry and that person it's about
[2:03:11] the word
[2:03:12] don't settle for something just toss
[2:03:15] together go back and get the original
[2:03:18] but what we do is we fall back to a
[2:03:20] human element
[2:03:23] we fall back to a human element we have
[2:03:25] reasons why we don't do what we need to
[2:03:27] do
[2:03:31] would it be too brutal
[2:03:34] too rude too abrupt
[2:03:37] to say we have so much iniquity in our
[2:03:39] lives
[2:03:40] saints they must grieve god because the
[2:03:43] prophet of god said iniquity is knowing
[2:03:46] to do
[2:03:47] and not doing it
[2:03:49] oh god purge every bit of iniquity from
[2:03:51] us
[2:03:52] purge us lord from everything that would
[2:03:55] resemble iniquity
[2:04:01] you see this word come down my brother
[2:04:02] and sister and it come down in this day
[2:04:04] it was brought in every effort that was
[2:04:06] placed upon it and every effort that
[2:04:08] will continue to be was for you and i it
[2:04:11] was not to stop somewhere along and like
[2:04:14] a carrot being dangled but this is the
[2:04:16] word it's at our fingertips it's in our
[2:04:18] hearts we have every form of it
[2:04:21] amen
[2:04:22] and you
[2:04:23] are called to make it manifest to the
[2:04:24] people
[2:04:26] you minister to
[2:04:30] you see you minister to people i don't
[2:04:32] even know
[2:04:33] so you can't just leave it to some
[2:04:35] preacher in church
[2:04:37] you minister at the grocery store the
[2:04:39] gas station at the corner mart you
[2:04:41] minister to the neighbor you minister it
[2:04:43] to some of your relatives you do this
[2:04:45] you're the one that's called the
[2:04:46] minister this you can't say well we'll
[2:04:48] just leave all the ministry to the
[2:04:50] ministry no sir you are the ministry you
[2:04:54] are the one that god has called he
[2:04:56] manifested this to you everything that i
[2:04:59] have read to you that it was manifested
[2:05:01] in your sight you've seen it he has
[2:05:03] become
[2:05:04] a regular once twice
[2:05:07] ultimately three to four times a month
[2:05:11] couple sundays couple wednesday nights
[2:05:13] preaching to them
[2:05:17] and he's praying
[2:05:18] and the lord says
[2:05:20] pull the veil off
[2:05:23] pulls the veil off
[2:05:26] about a third of the church says
[2:05:28] that's a cult
[2:05:31] two-thirds of the church says you've
[2:05:33] been preaching the truth because we were
[2:05:35] taught to take it back to our bible
[2:05:38] i'm wondering if that other third
[2:05:40] actually took it back to their bible or
[2:05:41] if they were the lazy ones that
[2:05:43] just
[2:05:46] well anyway i'll i'll leave that be
[2:05:50] baptizes pastor
[2:05:52] associate minister deacons trustees
[2:05:56] families
[2:05:58] why
[2:06:00] because
[2:06:00] sometimes william branham
[2:06:04] becomes a
[2:06:06] hera
[2:06:08] to the people
[2:06:11] if google says it
[2:06:12] it's got to be
[2:06:15] true
[2:06:20] oh my my neighbor who i just asked to
[2:06:23] pray for my daughter
[2:06:25] and god did touch her and i thanked him
[2:06:29] he
[2:06:31] oh by the way he didn't ask anyone else
[2:06:33] to pray
[2:06:35] he doesn't pray his own self imagine
[2:06:37] this we're narrowing this down
[2:06:41] he's
[2:06:42] in a cult
[2:06:46] what did i do i asked a guy in a cult to
[2:06:49] pray for my daughter
[2:06:57] yeah
[2:06:58] we're all in on the cult
[2:07:00] those of you got your own religion built
[2:07:02] around your own thoughts in your own
[2:07:04] world or in a cult of your own
[2:07:06] hallelujah oh i know sometimes we don't
[2:07:09] like that it but it's the truth saints
[2:07:12] amen what did they do god sent wesley he
[2:07:15] was the voice for that day goes right on
[2:07:17] down so it has gone on through the years
[2:07:19] until in this last day there is again
[2:07:21] another people in the land who under
[2:07:24] their messenger will be
[2:07:26] the final voice
[2:07:28] to the final age
[2:07:30] what does that do it doesn't
[2:07:32] absolve us
[2:07:34] my brother and sister it actually binds
[2:07:36] us
[2:07:37] to live a life
[2:07:39] and to speak a gospel that is true
[2:07:42] and people can look at you and say what
[2:07:45] they claim
[2:07:46] is real
[2:07:48] not they spoke it on sunday
[2:07:51] and they are something different
[2:07:54] let
[2:07:55] your ministry
[2:07:57] be faithful
[2:07:58] amen
[2:08:00] and let's purge
[2:08:01] let me just say this one last time let's
[2:08:02] just purge any
[2:08:07] iniquity
[2:08:09] i just almost struggle to say that
[2:08:10] because it seems like
[2:08:12] i'm saying people are you're not
[2:08:14] christians and i'm not at all
[2:08:16] my brother and sister but let's just
[2:08:18] purge iniquity out of our life
[2:08:20] the word says it
[2:08:22] let's do it
[2:08:24] i'm not talking about words of men
[2:08:27] i'm talking about the word of god sister

[2:09:22] my brother and sister i want to remind
[2:09:25] you right as we go an amazing grace has
[2:09:28] always been my song of praise brother
[2:09:29] jason can you come lead us in that
[2:09:32] amen
[2:09:33] i just want to remind you saints once
[2:09:35] again
[2:09:37] the ever-present
[2:09:39] god
[2:09:41] is not a historical god
[2:09:44] he's a god that answers prayer
[2:09:46] and if we will seek truth now i i don't
[2:09:49] mean to impose any will upon you saints
[2:09:53] but i do encourage you
[2:09:56] include in your prayer life
[2:09:58] lord
[2:09:59] lead me and guide me into all truth
[2:10:02] make that part of your everyday life and
[2:10:04] you will realize that god
[2:10:06] will take you places you never thought
[2:10:09] you would go
[2:10:10] god will show you things you never
[2:10:12] thought you would see why because he's
[2:10:13] faithful
[2:10:14] to his promise
[2:10:16] amen
[2:10:17] hallelujah you know you look at some of
[2:10:19] these things like the opening of the
[2:10:21] seals
[2:10:24] people criticized and said well if
[2:10:25] william branham had a revelation god
[2:10:28] wanted him to preach the seals wouldn't
[2:10:29] he have just gave it to him
[2:10:31] but you see
[2:10:32] a lot of that
[2:10:35] was that direct anointing of the day
[2:10:37] fresh manna he didn't come and have it
[2:10:39] all written out because you know what
[2:10:40] the nature of it is students you write
[2:10:42] papers for school right
[2:10:45] if we're not careful we second-guess
[2:10:47] what we wrote right we write something
[2:10:49] out we look at it that don't sound right
[2:10:51] i want to scratch that out i'll write it
[2:10:53] this way no that looks better i'll write
[2:10:55] it this way pretty soon we've morphed
[2:10:57] the whole thing
[2:10:58] god said you know i don't want anybody
[2:11:00] morphing this i don't need them writing
[2:11:02] it down and then rewriting it i'm just
[2:11:04] going to give it fresh
[2:11:05] right now
[2:11:06] and let it be preached fresh amen that's
[2:11:09] what revelation is about
[2:11:11] hallelujah
[2:11:17] [Music]
[2:11:22] amazing grace can we just stand and
[2:11:25] worship the lord
[2:11:27] thank him for his grace
