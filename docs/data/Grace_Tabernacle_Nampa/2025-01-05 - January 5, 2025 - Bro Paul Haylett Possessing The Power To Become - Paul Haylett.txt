the real revelation of the seventh seal yes sir is that God would come down Choose You amen choose me Amen to be his Sanctuary what a mystery what a mystery what an amazing story that God has written and he is allowing us to live that story out and we're not just some little part you know you might see like an advertisement that says that they need people for a movie well to be chosen just to be the back walking away down a sidewalk but God chose you and I to be the star of the show he's the real true star but he chose us to just be part of that that whole story is wrapped around you and I what he saw us to be and what he made us to be Is So Glorious can we just lift our hands for a moment and just thank the Lord for including us in this glorious story this glorious Revelation this manifestation Lord we just say thank you Lord Jesus of all the people on the Earth today Lord that you would come down us the seemingly most unlikely people nothing special nothing to behold and yet you said I chose you and I place you right in the middle of my story Lord how we thank you for that today your grace and mercy father is beyond our comprehension Lord the picture is so much bigger than we can even see and we the least that we can do today Lord is just simply to say Thank You Lord and we give praise and glory and honor to you today father Lord that you allowed us to be what you wanted us or called us to be you've made it possible oh how we thank you Lord we bless your Holy Name today Lord just another day at the start of a new year father but another step closer for the bride not to be there at the throne but to be in the throne Lord Jesus a part of you how we appre appreciate Lord and we love you we give praise to you father today bless each one father Lord I know their needs maybe they just lift a hand to say Lord I have a need my family has a need my children whatever it might be father but we're here father to claim what is rightfully ours because you have said that you would give to us what we would ask in your name if we ask correctly and father we want to come today just asking father for the needs in our lives our families the church friends Lord whatever it might be father Lord we don't want to ask a Miss but we want to see each and every one come to a deeper relationship come to a a re Revelation Lord not just not just an idea not a concept but a revelation of who we are in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Lord bless a service today I pray in your precious name amen amen hallelujah thank you musicians beautiful song service stirs my heart amen good to see our sister Donna on a violin again amen I thought maybe she had retired and uh but um happy to see her amen I want to read to you a a little um a little deal that had been sent to me here if I can find it um and while it would appear to be just sent as it would be to me this is actually sent to you and so it's in the wording that we need to make uh from Brother Barry coffee thank you for your support of vision books in 20124 your contributions Have Been instrumental instrumental in distributing B IES and message books to Believers across the globe this year bringing joy and encouragement to those seeking God's word your kindness is not only appreciated it is making an inter Eternal impact in the lives of many may God richly bless you for your faithfulness and your heart for his work amen and so I read that as not Paul Halen amen I read that as Grace Tabernacle each and every one of of you for your prayers and your offerings and gifts that have made a difference in the life of Believers I just want to just touch a little bit on this I really should ask brother Sergey to come do this but um we are I'm asking more almost like a prayer request at this point right now uh we are endeavoring or moving forward uh to support a translation work some of it is already there there's already uh um what would you say work completed um but uh as a church um we have endeavored to see the message there's many many uh um languages you know that still do not have the message in their language and or limited amounts or I don't say this negative but factual that some early translations of the message uh were not sufficient and uh no criticism to those that did it I'm sure they did it from their hearts but anyway um we've been working on this and uh uh not me so much but to give credit where it's due brother Sergey has um been working he's been our our front man on this and we won't go any deeper on the details right now but I just want you to pray uh that God would bless this work it truly is a necessary work and um uh we will kind of put together a a uh more complete deal but as we go into the new year uh I would just ask you to put that on your prayer list for this year uh that the word would be translated brother Barry is is uh working very much so to to have this printing done um they have at this point by God's grace found an Avenue uh to have the message printed and good quality uh not not some cheap deal good quality and it and it being shipped uh all around the world it's not just entirely to Africa but um there's been uh quite a quite a amount shipped to South America and Spanish uh and uh into Europe and uh you know I believe we're in the time the season uh that God is finishing up his work we're we're seeing all these things you can interpret quotes you know uh just looking at something a brother posted the other day about uh uh this is it Russia is going for the oil um well we know that's going to happens absolutely is it going to happen today or tomorrow or 2026 that's right we don't know but what we know is what God anointed a prophet to speak is coming to pass amen and I see it right here in Grace Tabernacle I see a faithful group of people we're not a huge Church we're not busting this building at this seams but I tell you what my brother and sister I believe that we have the word being manifested in our midst and so I thank God for that and just certainly encourage you to include these translation work uh in your prayers uh that that God could anoint the brothers uh that are involved each one to do his part and uh you know I just listened to a brother preached the other day I loved his sermon I'm not going to try and imitate his sermon but I loved his sermon he was talking about being on the clock and um he he basically was making the point that we're not our own we're on God's time and it's time for us to do our job and I thought that's the truth right there that we we are not on our own time but we are on God's time and and he's called us and Lord help us to do our job amen hallelujah so uh a thank you from Brother Barry uh I think we forgot to remember Sister April uh she's now I think paying the price for her time off and uh so God help our our sister uh I just want you to know this coming Wednesday if Lord willing this is all Lord willing this coming Wednesday our brother David Nash will be speaking for us and uh then the coming Sunday Brother David will be speaking and sister Jerry and I will be here on Wednesday uh but uh we're going for a quick weekend uh to see our son and uh family in Phoenix and uh so um just wanted you to know that amen let's turn our bibles if you would I want to speak to you this morning uh a title possessing the power to become and um my brother and sister when we look at this scripture if we are not careful we will put it as a past tense or a future tense but God wants you if you read the same scripture every single day he wants you to make it present tense amen so we don't look at God of history or God of the future but we look at it as God in his word today and so if we're still reading the same scripture tomorrow it will be God of his scripture today amen so we look at that and we thank the Lord for that amen and it's one thing to talk about a power it's talk about possessing it's quite another when we take that uh possession make it ours and take the power and manifest it or make it ours and so we certainly would ask uh that God would come and bless the service today let's turn to John 1 11-13 amen amen wonderful God is good to us the closing of the closing of uh 2024 uh you know we have to look back I'll tell you personally one of the most challenging years I've ever had in my life and you know it's interesting is the challenge was not you the challenge was not the politics of our government but the closer we get to the Rapture those little things that we never even give second thought to in the past are rising up in front of us and we're saying Lord is that really me we didn't even used to notice it but now we see it as I I guess I just speak straight we just see it as this giant flaw in our character isn't that amazing what's happened God's taking the magnifying glass of his word he's just slowly turning the magnification to what we saw as a grain of sand that meant nothing now puts us in desperation amen Lord I Need this out of my life you you understand what I'm saying 5 10 years ago we wouldn't have given a second thought but today it's like Lord I need this out of my life and so I tell you that 2024 being probably the greatest challenge of my life God's turning the magnifying glass that's right he's he's cranking that down and I realize the greatest enemy Paul's God's not even Satan it's Paul and I just Lord help me I want 2025 to be a year that I would actually let go of some of those little things I didn't think mattered just give you a little example I just recently you know I I I love to read and um had books are not bad books um they're they're not a a horrible story or horrible things in the story and it just dawned on me when I've got so many things to read I gave them big pile of books just expensive books fiction one thing to have a history book on your shelf yeah another to be engrossing your time and thoughts and labors into something that's fantasy not even real and I realized Lord I I just don't need this I don't know why I placed such importance on it in the past and you know I just see these little things coming in her life amen sorry to keep you standing John 1 11-13 he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him can someone raise a hand and say I'm one of the many amen but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God Heavenly Father we ask to bless your word today bless this time together in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Saints now I want to just focus uh for just a moment there in that scripture if we could you see my brother and sister to them gave he power to become the sons of God now when you look at that we we have to have a good understanding or balance of predestination um I don't know brother Isaac we have some feedback I think it it seems like a little little echo or something up here um so we look at predestination isn't it wonderful about predestination amen Because unless that we just fully reject God Satan cannot take and pull you out of the Lamb's Book of Life that's it I mean he can do everything he wants to do but he can't pull you out of that book and we in our flesh cannot put ourself into that book book amen so when you look at this it says it gave them power to become the sons of God what the word is actually saying there it gave you an ability to accept who you are by Revelation and so when you have that ability to accept who you are you can then look in the word and say you know what I I failed yesterday imagine my brother and sister I'm sure glad we don't keep track imagine if we took all the little things of our life the little failures that were and we wrote them down in a book like a diary my we would be on about the 365th Edition this year so it's there that we look at that see but God gives you an ability to look Beyond those little failures and he let you look into the promise of the word in other words predestination is not a concept in Scripture it is a life being lived amen it is the very word com out that's what predestination is it's not something that we teach and and use it for an anchor to say well praise God I can't be lost but it is there something that is bubbling up inside of you and I that is showing us that's who I am right there an eternal thought of God Amen and God does not change his mind he doesn't come along and say you know what you know you kind of messed up and and you know you did and you did this or you didn't and I'm sorry you hit the limit but my brother and sister I still think of the word how many times must you as a body of Believers forgive me when my stumbles and bumbles as the pastor amen it's that me and it is reciprocal amen that each one of us looks at one another so we get all bent out of shape amen especially married people would would be able to do that we're still you can be married a long time and you're still being mared or molded together we are humans we have opinions and we have and things little things in our life that maybe have kind of been put in there uh and and we look at that and God is bringing this and working this all together and my brother and sister as we come as Sons and Daughters of God we have to do the same thing actually in the plan of God because God is bringing you and I not as a prefinished that's right you can go over here to Home Depot and you can buy a piece of wood and it's prefinished to look like Oak and take it home and put it next to the Oak and it looks false we are not pre-finished God is working on us but see he has a perfect plan that he is molding us together to to bring us to that place of perfection and it's a Perfection that is God's Perfection not Perfection that Humanity thinks it is it's not a Perfection that we can look in the mirror and say I've been a perfect teenager I've been a perfect brother a perfect this a perfect that no my brother and sister it's Perfection by the word and the word is bringing about and often times God's Perfection of his word is actually hidden in this vessel amen amen God working us to a place that you'll come my brother and sister and you know the Rapture already taking place right now we're we're not looking for Rapture to come but there's actually a body change taking place in the body of Christ right now and as it is but my I want to ask you do you feel this morning now now you got to understand this I'm not I don't like to go by feelings amen but do you feel like right now that that you're just Rapture Ready see that's a tricky statement right cuz in our flesh that's it we would look at that and say I am not Rapture Ready but you might be shocked that God has declared many of you Rapture Ready right now but he's waiting till the whole body that's right he's bringing the body together in this great body change and so as the bride of Christ is being prepared by the word she's being uh uh fed she's being built amen structured by the word and the revelation of the word will be different to you as it would be to someone sitting next to you or across the building from you because we have different needs amen we are human and we have all the same needs as the bride of Christ but what position we're actually in is different for each one and that's why sometimes we have to just sit back let God preach the word to us because we say I've got that one heard that one before that's good I got a revelation of that but maybe the one beside you doesn't that's right so do you want to just hear what's good for you or do you want to hear what's good for the body that's right amen we want what the body needs right that's a real believer wants what the body needs because then there'll come the day that the preaching of the word comes to you and they've heard it and they believe it that's why the church has always got to stay in Balance we can't come to a place that we are more spiritual than those around us because there will be a place in our own life that is not mature and we need to be able to receive the preaching of the word to touch on that portion of our body and so God by his grace and mercy has come so he's gave us a power or a revelation to become the sons of God Amen as we stand there in that place the power my brother and sister is in Christ right amen amen so what we're doing is actually surrendering that power that we need we surrender the need to Christ he's the power that comes to fill the need amen so I think that to them he gave power in other words he gave them an acceptance or an amen to the preaching of the word to become Sons and Daughters of God now as Paul is speaking to the Romans in Romans 1:1 for I long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end you may be established so now my brother and sister the the definition of part by Webster is to give something of quality a thing to make something known to someone so the Apostle Paul's speaking to the Romans and he's telling them you know what I want to make known unto you something that is a spiritual gift that that will change your life it will Build You Up strength in you it's Revelation to you and I want to come now Paul we know if he was speaking as a man uh this would be totally in effective for you and I but he was not speaking as a man so therefore his words were God's words which are Eternal Words which are here today that God would actually be speaking to you and I today wanting to give to you and I a gift amen we just come through the holiday season amen now some of us are a little bit Scrooge kind of you know makes me happy to see my grandchildren happy it makes me happy to see those around me happy but don't waste your money on me me and you know nobody listens you know I mean how many shoes do you need how many socks do you need How many pairs of pants and shirts and stuff and the things that I actually would want in this flesh we're talking in the flesh right now you're not going to buy for me so we love our pastor so much we took on a 7-year payment of about 800 a month no we don't do that right so we stay away from the flesh this the things that this gift was some kind of carnal kind of tangible I can lay my hands on this gift the Apostle Paul wants to give to me and realize the Apostle Paul speaking in these words that he wants to impart a spiritual gift in other words he wants the word to be broken as bread and given to you and I that we would be spiritually built up spiritually blessed by this gift and and it's there that he is not only saying I I want to impart to you this gift but he said in the end you'll be established in other words this gift has a a a a a tangible uh uh oh I lost the word there sorry uh but it'll be a tangible thing to you and I that that what we hear by the word today will affect our life not just for one day I always liked uh you know the little story about the dad who said said why I come to dislike Christmas and it's it's a cute little story he says I I went to the store and I I bought him a dump truck and a loader and a back hole and I I got all of this little conveyers and all this little stuff and and before Christmas was over they must have been in a warm area he said I look out in the backyard and my son is digging a hole in the sandbox with a stick and realized this dump truck this stuff didn't mean anything more to his son than a stick so we got to be careful that by I I believe in deep teaching don't understand I believe in deep things but by Deep teaching my brother and sister if it's not usable that's right we will revert to back to what we had before so just because it's deep and it has a certain a factor it doesn't mean that you'll actually Tak it into your everyday life God wants you to have a gift that will establish you he wants you to have the word that when you are in a time of crisis when you are in times of stress when you're times of sickness whatever that might be that you have something that you will take a hold of hold on and be able to use that that establish also means to Anchor so he wants you to be anchored by the word amen and so as we look at this we we realize my brother and sister uh that God is so good to us because he has come amen has brought a gift to us he's given it to us it's a gift can anyone say I'm more anchored today than I was a year ago 5 10 years whatever it be to be more anchored today than we was you see God doesn't blow a horn every time he does something for you sometimes God just changes the circumstance and allows you to live under that blessing without even touting or or making it known that he did that but yet when we stop in retrospect we can look back and say you know what I I'm not who I was a year ago I I'm not I'm not in the same circumstance I was a year ago and I'm looking for 2025 myself to be another gift coming into the assembly GI coming into our lives that we could finish if God so chooses the end of 2025 we'd be able to say I'm not the same person I was at the end of 2024 because God's imparting more and more and more into my life that's changing me bringing me into a different relationship than I ever had before and God is not into the superficial God is into the deep relationship not deep preaching don't misunderstand me deep preaching does doesn't make deep relationships I know many of people that can quote all kinds of things and still are so superficial in their life that you're stunned amen people that would rather tell you about their Millions than talk to you about the Lord amen God help us my brother and sister deep yes they're very deep very intelligent make people like me feel so inadequate but you know what I'd rather be the simp that knew Christ than to be the Rich Young Ruler amen but you see God is doing this he's given his word you might say we're looking a little bit in retrospect today but he's given you the word do you have the same understanding of the word today as you did when he gave it to you I would hope not that's right I would hope hope not cuz if there's no growth my brother and sister we have a problem that's right amen so God's given his word and we love his word and his word is opening to us every day can we say amen amen he didn't just give it to us in a print form he didn't just give it to us in the voice but he gave it to us also in the spirit amen and that is where he comes down and talks to you and I he talks to us in the Midnight Hour he talks to us in our time of need often times we'll have an answer out of the word if we'll just open the word people are like Pastor I need an answer I need an answer I need an answer amen have you opened the word just just go to the word and and God I believe will speak to you from the word and and I I'm a curious guy when you hear nothing more back from this you often think well do I dare ask them do I dare go into this equation because maybe they felt like I didn't do enough for them please don't lift your hands but probably some at some time have felt like I didn't do enough for you but let me tell you what I did do for you I prayed that's it that's it and if we long to get the answer the pastor doesn't have the answer for you it's Jesus Christ who has the answer and so when you go and you start looking in the word and you've got a body of Believers that love you appreciate you pray for you I can guarantee you I can tell you as a matter of fact you will find the answer cuz God wants you to find the answer my brother and sister you don't you know some people that they they they they want an answer they truly want an answer but they go the wrong place that's it to get the answer amen true story a man I knew years ago got in a financial bind had good credit could have walked into a bank and borrowed money under a structured loan every loan typically is considered structured we give you this you pay us this much over this period of time structure instead he started hauling things to the pawn shop and selling it for a quarter of its value and in the end it didn't work he no longer had anything to his name and still didn't get himself out of his financial situation now you say why are you mentioned that brother Paul I'm telling you it's because he found he was searching for his solution in the wrong place and we often times search for Solutions in this world we search for Solutions in ourself when we should be searching for the solution in Christ that's right in the word is where we should be seeking the solution and so it's there my brother and sister God has come and and he's given us these answers he's placed it there and uh so as we'll look at that we see that God sends men but people don't always listen to men I can I I feel free to preach that way not as a pastor or preacher but because I've been in that stage of my life that I I I just simply refus to listen Ministers of this gospel tried to to help me and I didn't want their help my dear wife could give you a whole list of of those times and seasons and did it bless my family that I behave that way no it did not bless my family that I was going to solve this problem that I had on my own I wasn't going to lower myself to ask a preacher to help me maybe it sounds familiar if it does maybe this sermon is for you God sent his men amen why because it wasn't the man who had something he wanted to impart to you just like it wasn't the Apostle Paul that was going to be doing the imparting it was God coming wanting to impart to you and he used a man amen to do that aren't you glad that today each and every one of us is used of God Amen we are God's hands we are his voice amen we are his heart amen and he wants to use us amen we're on the clock maybe we should do our job amen but you look at this realize that God wanted to impart something to you and I and he said I'm going to use these men to do this and why so we could stay the same that we could just go on status quo no God wants you to step up higher amen he's got a higher calling for us Saints don't look at it like God's trying to punish you don't look at it like something is missing at as it were on God's part but God wants to lift you and I up to a higher calling amen and you know sometimes God has to use correction to do that sir right sometimes you know God is God is uh dealing with us uh uh whatever it takes to tap into a higher life tap into the supernatural uh you know 2 Peter 1:11 said for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ now this is what God is trying to do my brother and sister he is coming bringing the word and sometimes we feel like it's a little too blunt but the truth of it is if you went to the end of your life and that was never dealt with you would look back and say Lord why didn't you deal with me and God's trying to deal with us and we're like saying why are you so harsh my brother and sister it's not harsh if God's bringing you into a higher calling it's not harsh if God is purging these things out of our life that are negative holding us back it's not harsh if God is doing everything it takes for us to step up into an eternal position amen so as we tap into the supernatural so this entrance that is opened my brother and sister in our mind we would picture that as like a doorway that that we have an entrance now to do that but we're dealing with the soul and so if you can look then at the doorway of your soul and you look at that and realize that there are a few things that are in the doorway now naturally at home imagine you go home today each one of you to your house and you have to climb over several boxes of tools and pipes and wrenches and whatever to get into your house wouldn't we stop and move those things out of the doorway yes sir especially if the nice dress that you young ladies and Sisters Wives are wearing if you climbed over that big pile and realized that you just tore your dress You' say this stuff has to be moved now I want you to look at this I hope you can follow me you see we're dressed by the word God's not wanting us to crawl over all kinds of self all kinds of shortcomings and complex and what not you know that that smears uh uh as it would be the grease or tears the the dress the word in our life God wants you to get that stuff out of the doorway and let him come and let you come freely amen come to the Water of Life freely and so as God is dealing with us he's bringing us to a place that he's imparting to you and I to give this so we can tap into a higher life and as it is in second Peter uh an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly amen this is not just enough message to get you to church on Sunday my brother and sister this is enough of Christ himself to get you and I into a position that we can be effectively used of God to witness to the cashier witness to those around you witness to the grumpy neighbor witness to whoever it might be that this is God putting us in a position that we're no longer walking imagine to tell and represent ourselves as royalty are we royalty today amen we should view ourselves as royalty in Jesus Christ and if we're in a torn smudged tattered dress trying to tell the neighbor how we have something so much more valuable than they have my brother and sister we're not here to boast of what we have but we're here by the grace of God this is why a message came to you and I to open a door Amen to open an entrance that would be opened and administered abundantly not the defeated Christian not the one that's walking along saying I don't know if I am I I it doesn't seem like I am I'm not sure God is listening I tell you if you have struggle in your life this morning please hear me you have struggle in your life this morning you need to say Thank You Lord because God saw you fit and able to handle handle the trial God's not going to give you a trial to watch you fall on your face and have mud on your face so to speak but God saw that you would have enough character to continue to press to the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus that you would be able to look at the word and say Lord is this the path you have for me then Lord you must have made me able to walk this path but we get a mentality that I'm going through trial after trial struggle after struggle and God must not love me God must not be hearing my prayer I want you to think about job my brother and sister God did not say watch me Crush job he was there letting the devil see that what was in job no matter what happened what was in job would come out Victorious did it changed job yes it changed job but job needed changed a man that was considered righteous he still needed more of Christ in his life and God is here today you are not of less value than job you are of Greater uh just as great I mean uh a value and in fact the Revelation that God give to you to bring you into this generation the seventh age moving into the bride age my brother and sister God placed that value on you to put you here that's right don't sit here and say oh woe is me you ought to lift a hand and say Lord thank you that you would see of all the saints of the ages that I would be qualified and capable to live in this day and manifest Jesus Christ right oh my my brother and sister the devil sometimes just tricks us into thinking why doesn't God care I'll tell you he cares more than you can even fathom that he cares because he has put you here and you might not feel Victorious but you're still standing today praise the Lord amen the devil would love to crush you grind you to ashes but you're standing today you're not sitting here feeling oh I'm so spiritually Victorious but you're still standing today Hallelujah all these things that are going on in life you're still standing today someone ought to lift a hand and say thank you Lord amen because this is how God works my brother and sister he's not uh he doesn't run a nursery with a hot house amen God will put you right out and we think we got a lot of woes it's a lot of Mind woes right that's what the prophet showed us it' be a mind battle in this day but you wouldn't have felt any more encouraged to be there and see your children fed to the Lions you would have said Lord what are you doing and and then God would deal with them and they would say I heard this preached and if this is the price I have to pay feed me with my children to the Lions 21st century a little hard to comprehend that but do you realize that they had been drawn out of the Coliseum and placed here today in the mind battle they would sayl why are you letting my children be so beaten and battered by the spirits of leoda why is music and clothes and all of these things having such an impact on my children my brother and sister the truth of it is if you have an open mind and can understand the devil would like to feed your children to the lion of leoda but when they turned and gave their life for Christ but you see it's a little bit different we don't have a Coliseum and giving our life for Christ is submitting to the word that's it that's it we don't have to go out here and be slaughtered on the street no that's right it takes a personal death amen a personal commitment and yes parents you're going to struggle yes young people you're going to struggle but in every age you can follow a theme if you just trust the Lord trust the Lord trust the Lord trust the Lord trust the Lord through every age my brother and sister it wasn't about the Doctrine doctrine's important but it wasn't about the doctrine that made them decide to give their life for Christ it wasn't about I understand this or that or the preaching of the word it was something down inside a seed that had been activated by that word that said you know what God's real God's real I might not be able to explain all of this the seals and and and you know bring the Hebrews in and tie this here and tie that there but I'm going to trust the Lord anyhow and he's not going to come and ask you did you explain it he's going to ask you did you believe it amen hallelujah aren't you glad we got an entrance that's been ministered to us amen and it's not just a just a a drought it it's an abundance my brother and sister that has given to us to Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and I just I mentioned this but I want to hit it just a little bit more my brother and sister we Liv in a day and I I hope this doesn't offend anybody that I pin at this but it doesn't matter how many naysayers do their little thing about whether or not the seals are open God's proving that he has opened the seals you can go over here and say but on this page it's not open yet and and that's after the page where he says it's open my brother and sister do you realize that God God leaves a certain element in every one of us that's called Revelation that's right amen and without Revelation it don't matter on what page that it's on or whether it can be misconstrued or construed none of that matters this is a personal message amen and it doesn't matter what page it's on it's a personal message it just needs to be on your page because if it's not on your page no one will ever make it real to you that's right people would say well explain it to me I tell you my brother and sister I I told a certain brother one time you know he said explain it to me and I said I can't explain it he come back down the road ways and said well why would I listen to you you said you can't explain it well I'll tell you what my brother and sister he's absolutely right I don't know why God chose me I don't know how God come at the time that he met me was seemingly uh uh totally out of place order of time I can't explain to you how certain words that were spoken would not leave me alone I cannot explain to you how that I sat and thought I am so low and So Unworthy God wouldn't waste his time on me and God come along and says but I am that's right I can't explain that but if you want a theological explanation you might have to find a theological person to break the Revelation to you and then all you'll have is theological reasoning and a theological life that's exactly right and then you'll live life and have theological victory yeah that's it and sorry to be harsh but then you're going to hear the theological answer from our lord Jesus do you know what the theological answer is depart from me that's right he's not looking for theology no he's looking for those that will give themselves open the door Amen to receive a greater blessing there's what he's looking for amen theology that's fine you can take almost any word in the Bible no doubt any word in the Bible and you can find the definition in Hebrew or whatever for those words and sometimes it's enlightening but the minute you have that word in the Hebrew doesn't do a single thing that's right for your soul that's right and the man who's in complete ignorance of the Hebrew but has Revelation yeah will have more that's right but it's that it's that element that comes in that's trying to replace the things of God with knowledge yeah that's right exactly right the tree of knowledge is't it amazing how God just allowed that to come now the tree of knowledge is good I I'm I'm excited that that we're here today and we can read and write I'm excited that that you know we can comprehend the difference between up and down especially when you're on an airliner and they tell you you know go to 32,000 ft what are you doing going to 32,000 where on the other side of the earth no you we need to have that but when it comes to the word the prophet of God told us you need to read and you need to pray and you need to trust God cuz I tell you right now there's so many things in scripture we can't explain if we fight our battle on that Hill you'll never finish the race that's right now second Timothy are we clear I maybe you disagree I don't know but I I do believe that this that we've just been speaking ties directly to the seven seal that whole thing coming right down it's God speaking to you personally in other words we could sum it up to say you can't make it on Daddy's uh Revelation you can't make it on Mama's Revelation you can't make it on brother or sister's Revelation you can't make it on the pastor's Revelation you got to have your own personal relationship and Revelation with Jesus Christ amen amen second Timothy 2:20 but in great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of Earth and some to honor and some to dishonor so in the world we live in today you'll find that the denominations are pushing away they say that predestination is kind of a misunderstood thing that you know you have this uh ability yes God is doing some choosing but not choosing that much but my brother and sister I'll tell you what God does God can allow things to be so painful that you'll change direction sounds cruel they say a loving God wouldn't do that they don't know what the love of God is cuz the love of God will bring you to a place that you will say Lord not not my will but thy will be done and we change direction and you look at that and some would say that that's not a loving God that's a cruel God my brother and sister I'll tell you how loving our God is he loves us so much he knows that we don't comprehend what hell is we don't comprehend what these things out of judgment are but he knows that we are inadequate to understand that and he says but I'm going to lead you and guide you is this not scriptural amen I'm going to lead you and guide guide you into all truth what is truth eternal life is truth amen living in the presence of God is truth and he said he's going to lead you there amen so it doesn't matter how we feel about this in this little touchy feely world we live in where everything oh don't don't offend don't offend we're not going to preach an offensive gospel we're just going to all go to hell did I say that out loud I'm sorry no my brother and sister God cares that's it right if God didn't care he would say go ahead and compromise a little bit and I'll Overlook it but he said you add one thing to this amen that's what compromise would be adding one thing to this amen God loves us enough he'd rather you be pained right now and rejoicing over there amen but the world wants to Rejoice now and they don't even think that hell is real anymore that's right they believe it's a figurative writing in the Bible could we take a poll is hell real I believe it's real cuz the Bible said it's real amen heaven real yeah amen some theologians today are like well heaven and hell it's just like you know whether some get caviar and some eat prime rib well what if you don't like caviar no you know they've watered it down so far there's no consequence for the life and God's saying there is consequence and I want you to see it and in fact if it's necessary I want you to feel it amen amen if we would be honest with ourselves we would actually admit there's been times we thought God was punishing us amen right because God was changing the course of our life and we thought why is he punishing me he wasn't punishing you no hard to comprehend for some people he was actually leading you that's exactly right sometimes it takes pain my brother and sister to cause us to react in the right sense amen CU if it was words were good enough we would read the Bible once and do exactly what it said but we read the Bible over and over and over again and go do the opposite that's it h are we doing okay see Timothy 2:20 you know says that some are to honor and some are dishonor you know what an opportunity God's given us to step into our role as a supernatural being when you got up this morning did you feel like you were Supernatural H I didn't feel too Supernatural this morning I I I won't go into it it's actually humorous but I don't think it's necessary for me to go into what the morning went like but I can just tell you if you're sleeping soundly and you have a runny nose you have a problem didn't feel too Supernatural didn't change who I am in Jesus Christ amen a leg cramp at midnight doesn't change who you are in Jesus Christ and we would say oh Lord but my brother and sister don't say oh Lord but just say Lord keep leading me keep leading me Lord you wouldn't even care about me Lord if you didn't care about me you would just let me go but you're not letting me go you're pulling me back again and again and again and if I have to face the fiery trials I'll face them amen who would we say Amen to that amen hallelujah you see the word said somebody's going to be hungry in this generation you think God missed the Mark when he chose you serve and put a desire in you to live this word you've seen the jokes through the years of of uh uh what's the Archer with the you know shoots the arrow and Cupid yeah yes yeah you know you guys have all seen the you've seen the cartoon things they do of that Cupid man and woman in the park sitting on the bench looking at each other and there's a really really ugly guy just beyond them and Cupid's like an arrow goes misses the guy goes over and the guy runs over and sweeps the girl off her feet yeah no it's not how it works Cupid might Cupid might miss God didn't that's right God knows so he's made no mistake Can someone say he made no mistake amen so if he made no mistake my brother and sister somebody's going to be hungry to desire a supernatural position in the Kingdom of almighty God they're going to be hungry for that and when you're hungry you'll find food the prophet of God said now just paraphrasing this that people that want ate from A Fine table amen when they're hungry enough we'll eat out of a dumpster and I'll tell you what it is when the word of God struck your heart my brother and sister there's no dumpster going to satisfy that amen there's no thing of this world going to satisfy that there's no such thing as denomination satisfying that it'll only be the pure word of God that can satisfy the hunger that the Lord Jesus Christ placed into you and so when we recognize that we got to recognize that God has given us a power to become Sons and Daughters of god let's not let's not just Waltz around this thing well I was predestinated I this I that no my brother and sister there's a hunger in you and if the hunger is not in you then you're going to starve and when you go into starvation mode you'll get real hungry then and it'll cause you to do something some people hunger for the world some people hunger for what denomination has to offer amen I got a lot of good friends I'll tell you how it is I got a lot of good friends I got a friend that him and his dad gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to their church when they built a new church and he basically made a statement like that's my insurance for what that money is insurance for nothing a hunger for the word of God satisfying the soul changing our position that's it there's where you start to see the plan that's right you know predestination some people refer to it as the insurance plan you know that's the plan but it doesn't have to do that God wrote your name on a book just so your name would be on a book so you could do whatever you wanted with your name on the book and live like you want wanted but knowing your name is on the book and as you live whatever you want to do and your name's on the book you feel satisfied satisfied and hunger are not the same hunger in your soul is what causes Sons and Daughters of God to get desperate Hallelujah hey how about I want to hurry up and close here what if we offer you a comfortable position as the defeated Christian we could buy better pews chairs whatever we could um boy some of you would say amen and some of you would be really upset um ice cream machine in the basement soda fountain and these are good friends these are people I know people that that I would say I respect boasting how their church now offers Donuts Sunday morning and they changed their rules and you can now have your coffee and your donut in the sanctuary during this service doesn't that sound good I mean imagine a great big apple fritter and they do churches are now putting recliners in and they don't want to disrupt your eating your donut and in your recliner so now they put a credit card machine on the back of the deal so you can just reach up there and swipe it sounds pretty good right brother David said no I want everybody to know Brother David said no yes this is Brother David if you don't know him but see what's happening see what's happening it it's just pulling them away an inch maybe a centimeter at a time just pulling them away pulling them away Lord that's not what I want to be no sir I don't want to be farther away from the Lord tomorrow than I was today that's right I don't I don't want to be you know farther away in a year and a year and a year you see how clever Satan is my brother and sister and we talk about it so that we can draw people in so that we can witness to them who Jesus Christ is my let me jump over a few things here look sometimes it seems like the Lord's just out to correct us all the the time right any of you ever have a struggles okay let's stop back up how many of you strong willed people that it seems like God's opposed to your program there was a few laughs here I'm assuming that that was an admission of guilt so if you are that person you see it's not a sin to be strong willed it's only a sin if you don't submit that will to God as far as the natural out here the guy that you know is just willing to Wade through the mud and the crud and the whatever to to you know I could tell you about my childhood when we were kids if there was no mud we just want to have a mud fight you just went out in the Corell and had a mud fight only that's not mud that's right some of you are cringing right now you see sometimes what will is what some are strong sister Carrie you just became a candidate is that okay sister car's been bucked off a horse and it hurt if that had been Paul that horse would have been in the next Parina bag that come out of the factory what' sister KY do licked her wounds cried may maybe got back on the horse that's right some of you would look at the horse and say they're dangerous I read that somewhere not touching it you see how we're all a little bit different you know it's like the joke about the guy comes home from work whining to his wife and she's like what's wrong honey and he's like I got a paper cut today that was a big deal to him so some people think God is just down on them I mean let's you don't have to lift a hand but there's more Believers that think God is angry at them than you would imagine now you might say it's their guilty conscience their iniquity that is working on them but it doesn't matter as long as they embrace the idea that God's angry at them but they miss the whole point my brother and sister that God is not angry at us God is Not punishing us God is leading us he promised he would and he is leading you and just so it happens to take you places you don't want to go circumstances you don't want to go through circumstan that seem that it's taking you away from God and we don't understand that God's quite willing to correct us amen that's [Music] ex quite willing but I want you just a quick example I want you to understand how God can do that sometimes times Abraham and Sarah not even realizing take this point that they were going through a body change God blinded their eyes to their own body change and a king comes along see Sarah she's so beautiful who's going to say that about a 90y old that's how black Ed Abraham and Sarah were to the change taking place in them now I want to ask you do you have a right to criticize what God's doing in your life God blinded Abraham and Sarah the world a Godly Man as the scripture shows us decides she's going to be my wife now I'm telling you Sarah must have been beautiful and Abraham does the lion see this this King I forget his name right at the moment help me brother yeah it it's it's quit laughing at me Jerry just lost it all the king wasn't wrong he looked out saw a beautiful young lady do you guys understand in the story beautiful young lady I want to marry her Abraham does the lion that's right and God makes the king do the apologizing that's right that's it oh think about how God works in our life my brother and sister God didn't even hold that against Abraham he made the king do the apologizing told them if you don't your Kingdom's done amen that's right amen now that's not ad ating that we do things that make everybody apologize for our Behavior but I tell you how much God guarded the promise that's it not promise it looked like punishment to the king but in the end God still blessed his kingdom because he followed the word of the Lord okay are you guys ready for me to be done you see my brother and sister people look at the scripture sometimes and think oh the preacher's preaching at me well if the preacher was preaching preaching at you and he was that carnal to preach at you now I'm going to put it in this strong of words if the car if the preacher was that carnal to say you know what I I I'm going to I'm just going to preach at you brother I'm just going to hammer you you know this way and that way and whatever things might be or I'm going to preach at you my brother and sister if that was the way you're doing then you're in the wrong Church anyhow that's right right but if the preacher comes along and says look that music that you've started listening to again the office party where they offered you a sip of Brandy and you took it is nothing but an open door to go back where you came from this little deal over here if I could speak strongly enough the prophet of God dealt with it my brother and sister so I feel I can deal with it we're wearing what we're wearing sisters because that's what they sell in the store look let's not judge what those skirts and dresses and whatever are appropriate because that's what they sell in the store we need to find what it is that reflects who we are in Jesus Christ we're not called to look like them we're not called to act like them and the prophet of God said if they don't have anything there they still sell goods and sewing machines amen let's stop and look at ourselves let's let's put the word of God in our own life in our own household and let's stand and let it reflect what we we really are are we the world right amen my goodness one foot in the world and one foot in glory how's that going to work it doesn't and I'm not preaching close clothline religion please don't misunderstand me but you see we got to stop and we got to look at ourself and say what am I reflecting and when God wants to deal with you don't think it's the preacher's opinion if it's in the word of God that's it amen H come on come on it's sometimes it's just time for us to come to a place and say do I look like a daughter of God or do I look like a fashion statement that's exactly right oh my my brother and sister you see even us Brothers you know I was joking brother Sergey can I throw you under the bus I was just sharing with brother Sergey that that um in our one shop over there uh i' I'm collected up all the things that we had around there I got a little weight bench and uh we have a treadmill and we have a little bicycle and uh I have blood sugar issues and I need to exercise more the doctors constantly exercise exercise I mentioned this to brother Sergey and he called me so so far off guard I was just like huh and he goes oh yeah brother Paul so you can work out Sunday mornings and come to the pulpit and your shirts all bold stop and you stand up there just like you see everything that I would do there desire to do wouldn't be wrong if I had that Spirit it would be horrible that's it need to deal with blood sugar that's fine deal with blood sugar want to look like that next thing you know I'll be wearing them skinny jeans with the knees wore out I hate flip-flop so I'll have to find some kind of sandal that that that works fine then I can come here and you know work out come to church hey everybody no time that's right yeah you see my brother and sister God will correct anything that doesn't fit his word right amen exactly right now there a moment don't lift a hand are you willing am I willing to accept that's it correction that's it that's exactly right young children Mark your ears I'm sorry my Bible says you're a bastard child if you won't that's it pretty strong words I don't want to be defined like that right sister Ruth comes so I will stop I just uh if you'll just start playing something real low Romans 9 want you to catch this 9 and 22- 26 what if God willing to show his wrath to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction you talk about an awesome God that we serve a patient God he's even patient with the unbeliever that's right I may be like no you're just a vessel of Wrath done God's patient with them example I'll cut out a little other notes Here amen Cain he's there he's angry and God says if you would back up a little bit Kan just do the right thing and I'll accept you that's it you realize what that was God offering r Redemption to a son of Satan exactly right that's how tell me that isn't love tell me that isn't love the world wants to twist the Bible oh if he loved if he really loved if God was love my brother and sister he offered Redemption to the seed of Lucifer if that isn't love amen if that isn't a patient caring loving God but you see the very nature of Cain would not allow him he had the opportunity that just shakes you and I that we would be there in our heart today we would say yes Lord I want that Lord but he's right there offered Redemption yes sir and he turns it down flat if you won't take me like I am you want to know that's a spirit of denomination today take me like I Am Lord in fact I'll add a few more tattoos and I'll do a little bit more of this and I'll go and you know there's that guy that sings with all those religious groups has got this long beautiful gray hair now it used to be brown and he's on some deal just talking about how the Lord told him that's what he should be that's not what the word said that's exactly right Cain coming back okay first off you got to reject Abel's offering y you realize if God would have compromised with Cain it wouldn't have been long he would have been demanding that Abel's offering would be unacceptable God didn't compromise no you come right back here to the word I'll spare you I'll give you life you can't do it amen let me just go along I skipped over a couple things but we're message Believers here today we can we can reach out and grasp this the word is telling us what is there for us does that make sense the word's telling us very clearly what is there for us you I mean is there's no misunderstanding what is there for us and you know what it's all so telling us the power he's gave you as Sons and Daughters of God there's more amen praise the Lord there's more to be released we haven't got the full uh the full uh uh uh amount amen I had another word there and I just can't grasp it we we're not not sitting here oh we've got it all we got it all no God's showing us Amen in other words I'm not using myself an example for anything more than the example what I've got right now Lord I want more that's it isn't that the daily life of a christianen lord I want more of you I want more of you Lord day by day Lord I need more of you see God moving on us in that fashion amen there has been Power released and there's more Amen to be released amen amen because the word shows us very clearly as we close the word has showed us very clearly that you have everything it takes for this age absolutely really amen back to my question earlier when you got up this morning did you feel like you had everything for this age no I'm pretty sure I can say this with authority yeah you didn't feel like you had everything that's right amen but God said it anyway amen that's right now mornings like this morning you just have to decide whether you believe the word or you believe yourself exactly right amen maybe after a couple three four five cups of coffee maybe it helped you come out of your lethargic position and realize oh it's Sunday I'm supposed to be happy that's come on Saints God's given his word his word holds amen it's faithful it's true amen amen hallelujah well we made it to the halfway point of the sermon in these scriptures right here it says that all creation is waiting for for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen you can't see out these windows right here but if we could you look right out there we're not waiting on them no they're waiting on us amen I heard a brother here some time back I think just a little misunderstood of what the scripture was and he was talking about like we the bride are waiting on them but do you realize my brother and sister God's not going to take an immature bride I take you if the bride was ready for the Rapture if God's timetable let me put it that way don't want to put it on any individuals if God's timetable was such Russia the Morning News would be Russia was in wherever taking over the oil wells just like the prophet prophesied all of these little things that we think we're waiting for would take place just like this I mean what's that to God what God is more concerned about is your character my character molded into His Image that's right amen we're not going to look like humans in Le oia although this form right Jesus Christ didn't come looking any different than you and I that's right so we understand what the physical form would be that's right but within that physical form is the form that is the reflection of the Perfection amen oh Lord I want to be the reflection of the Perfection Hallelujah let me stop I didn't realize I had so many notes Here I really truly only made it about halfway down the page Oh My Oh My Brother David why do we do this to ourselves okay Jesus on the authority of the word and then we're done you see all those scriptures I had never made it to you see what I mean others we could refer to but people Christianity and the way they have it today is so shallow 1954 it was shallow how much more shallow no wonder the unbeliever can hardly see how to believe Christianity that should we should have that in bold letters no wonder they don't see any difference between their life and Christianity because it's no more than a form but Christianity is real in its power and if it's just ceremonial any other any other ceremony would take its place I have nothing against lodges but masonry Odd Fellows or
