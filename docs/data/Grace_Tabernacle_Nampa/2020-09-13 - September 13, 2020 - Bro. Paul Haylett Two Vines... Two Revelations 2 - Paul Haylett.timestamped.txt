[48:43] after the service today let's turn in
[48:46] our bibles i want to speak to
[48:48] you uh once again on redemption's
[48:50] manifestation
[48:52] we want to talk about the two vines and
[48:54] the two revelations
[48:56] and we're going to take a slightly
[48:58] different course as it is today
[49:00] uh but we will did i give you those
[49:04] notes brother
[49:05] alex the revised version for today
[49:14] okay okay so i just felt a little led
[49:18] while we're going down this same path uh
[49:20] a little bit
[49:21] led of the lord to to just kind of go
[49:24] into
[49:25] another thought today and uh so
[49:28] while we're gonna look at this whole
[49:30] picture as we see right here
[49:33] we have our lord jesus christ and we
[49:35] know what the word says about him
[49:37] of lucifer one reference in scripture
[49:40] commonly called satan or the devil
[49:42] we know what the word says about him we
[49:44] see all these attributes and we'll be
[49:46] moving down through these lord willing
[49:49] uh in the next few weeks or a period of
[49:52] time
[49:53] and there is such a broad
[49:58] if i could put it that way a such a
[50:00] broad subject line
[50:02] in other words as we look at this right
[50:04] here uh
[50:05] saints there's uh i i don't want to
[50:07] exaggerate there's a thousand sermons
[50:09] here
[50:11] uh we just want by god's grace and
[50:13] leadership to be able to go
[50:15] into that and and uh bring out the parts
[50:18] that i believe
[50:18] by by uh the leadership of the lord that
[50:21] would be um
[50:22] beneficial to us as a body of believers
[50:26] uh let's go to matthew the fourth
[50:28] chapter
[50:29] uh verses one through eleven and um
[50:33] this i want to use as a foundation today
[50:37] uh as we would move forward matthew 4
[50:40] and 1 lovely
[50:43] lovely portions of scripture now saints
[50:46] i just want to share a little something
[50:47] with you
[50:48] i don't want to go in details but the
[50:50] devil has been assaulting
[50:52] you might say in a physical realm uh my
[50:55] family
[50:56] and uh it has to do with possessions it
[50:58] has to do with a robbery
[51:00] and uh i think about what the prophet of
[51:03] god talked about how that he just called
[51:05] the holy ghost on the scene
[51:07] and god laid that upon that man to
[51:10] return
[51:11] and we just have a need then i would ask
[51:14] for your prayers that
[51:15] god would just restore to us what is our
[51:18] rightful property
[51:19] and as we look at that we realize that
[51:22] satan is warring against us
[51:25] while the scripture says that we wore
[51:26] not against flesh and blood
[51:28] we realize the devil uses flesh and
[51:31] blood
[51:32] amen he's not afraid to anoint someone
[51:35] and that's why the scripture tells you
[51:36] and i that we should
[51:37] each day fortify ourselves in the word
[51:41] of god
[51:42] because satan comes in he anoints and it
[51:45] seems perfectly normal this is a thing
[51:47] that people miss saints
[51:48] is they can be anointed by a spirit but
[51:51] under the anointing of that spirit
[51:53] everything seems to be perfectly normal
[51:59] i feel the way i feel because of this
[52:01] this this
[52:02] this and this and i'm doing what i'm
[52:04] doing because of this this this and this
[52:07] and that is normal but under that
[52:10] anointing
[52:11] see the anointing is the only thing that
[52:14] makes that
[52:15] normal without that anointing on it
[52:18] people would say i would never say that
[52:20] i would
[52:20] never do that now i just want to go
[52:23] ahead and share this little idea
[52:24] on the way to church today this is a
[52:26] real live just happened event
[52:28] we're driving along and uh sister
[52:31] jerry's keen eye she goes look
[52:33] a coyote and i'm looking at the coyote
[52:35] he is a
[52:36] big beautiful coyote he's standing out
[52:39] in a pasture
[52:40] i'm focused on the coyote and i hate to
[52:43] admit this in church but i was thinking
[52:45] i could hit him from here
[52:48] and anyway sorry that was just my
[52:50] thoughts
[52:52] and so as we go by i said wow isn't that
[52:55] a coyote that's quite
[52:56] and jerry says did you see the sheep
[52:59] and i said sheep and she said yes
[53:01] they're all crowded up in the corner of
[53:03] the pasture
[53:04] so we do a u-turn and we go back and
[53:08] here is about a dozen sheep and they are
[53:10] crowded
[53:11] up into the corner all just pushing
[53:13] pushing pushing further into the corner
[53:16] and here is mr coyote out there in the
[53:18] deep grass of this pasture
[53:20] just moving along ever so slowly
[53:24] now look saints it's obvious the sheep
[53:26] are nervous
[53:28] they are now now just let me do this
[53:31] symbolically okay here
[53:33] they are okay sister sue
[53:36] i need you to just move a little closer
[53:38] to the coyote i'm just going to move in
[53:39] behind you
[53:41] and uh anyway i hope it works out for
[53:43] you
[53:48] no that's what they were doing they are
[53:50] pushing behind each other to the fence
[53:52] to getting in there
[53:53] and the one who got pushed to the
[53:55] outside said whoa why did that brother
[53:57] do that to me
[53:59] anyway we pulled up there and uh i
[54:02] jumped out and i
[54:03] started yelling at this coyote and he
[54:06] was so terrified he ran about 10 feet
[54:11] and he stopped and looked back and i
[54:14] decided i needed to do a little more
[54:15] than yell at him
[54:16] now imagine how i felt saints i got a
[54:20] tie on a dress shirt and i'm standing in
[54:22] the middle of the highway
[54:23] screaming go get hey and he runs 10 more
[54:26] feet and stops and looks at me
[54:28] finally i thought my goodness we're
[54:30] going to have to have a pentecostal
[54:31] revival to get this coyote out of here
[54:33] so i started screaming at the top of my
[54:36] lungs and jumping up and down and waving
[54:37] my
[54:38] arms imagine the people that lived in
[54:40] that house right there thought what kind
[54:41] of lunatic has stopped
[54:44] in front of our house today but you see
[54:46] it didn't take just a common
[54:48] okay now coyote
[54:51] saints we have the power of the word but
[54:54] you are going to have to put all of
[54:56] heaven behind it right seven sons of
[55:00] siva
[55:01] hey we don't even know who you are they
[55:03] beat them up and run them out
[55:05] amen if you want to chase off the devil
[55:07] saints you're going to have to be a
[55:09] hundred percent
[55:10] committed to chasing off the devil
[55:14] anyway we drove up it was pretty funny i
[55:16] have to share this side of the story i
[55:18] told jerry i said i need to tell these
[55:19] people this coyotes in the pasture with
[55:21] their sheep
[55:22] we pull up in there i knock on the door
[55:25] a man with a
[55:26] shirt white crisp white shirt and a
[55:28] black tie
[55:30] and cargo pants
[55:33] the shirt tail hanging out he opens the
[55:36] door he looks at me kind of smiles goes
[55:38] i'm on a zoom call
[55:42] and i was like okay well i'm on my way
[55:45] to church
[55:46] and i told him about the coyotes i got
[55:48] back in the car and jerry goes
[55:50] you know what i'm sure he's lds and
[55:53] he probably took his elder tag off and
[55:55] put it in his pocket when he answered
[55:57] the door
[55:58] because i'm telling you a white shirt
[56:00] untucked a tie hair combed
[56:03] cargo pants and flip-flops i don't know
[56:06] we live in quite a world don't we oh
[56:09] praise the lord
[56:11] you love the lord today amen matthew 4
[56:14] 1. amen then was jesus led up of the
[56:18] spirit into the wilderness to be tempted
[56:21] of the devil oh my goodness
[56:24] saints god would put you i hope you
[56:27] don't mind me including this in our
[56:28] vocabulary day
[56:30] god would put you in
[56:34] knowing that there could be a coyote
[56:39] right there whoa
[56:43] my god's not very nice to us
[56:47] imagine there was jesus led of the
[56:50] spirit
[56:51] not led of man not led of some priest
[56:54] but led of the spirit into the
[56:56] wilderness to be tempted
[56:57] of the devil and when he had fasted 40
[57:00] days and 40 nights
[57:02] he was afterward a hunger and
[57:05] when the tempter came to him he said if
[57:08] thou
[57:08] be the son of god and i don't mean to
[57:11] change
[57:12] scripture today saints but i just want
[57:13] you to catch where we're headed
[57:15] if thou be sons and daughters of god
[57:19] right it didn't end with jesus if thou
[57:22] be
[57:23] the son of god command that these stones
[57:25] be made bread
[57:27] and he answered and said it is written
[57:30] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[57:32] every word that proceedeth out of the
[57:34] mouth of god
[57:35] then the devil taking him up into the
[57:38] holy city
[57:39] okay see the correlation the tempter is
[57:42] the devil
[57:46] and said of him upon the pinnacle of the
[57:48] temple
[57:49] and saith unto him if thou be the son of
[57:53] god see satan don't give up easy you can
[57:55] rebuke him once for who
[57:57] who he weigh his vocabulary but he
[57:59] doesn't give up
[58:00] cast thyself down for it is written he
[58:02] shall give his angels
[58:04] charge concerning thee now i want to
[58:07] inject this right
[58:08] now my brother and sister the the law
[58:11] of the first fruits of the harvest
[58:15] we understand it right everything that
[58:18] applied to
[58:19] jesus christ applies to you and i
[58:24] in the proper context right
[58:27] so he didn't have one gift for himself
[58:31] and another gift for us amen
[58:34] in fact if we actually believe that god
[58:36] lives in us amen remember
[58:39] zipper steps in as brother jason watkins
[58:43] put it
[58:44] he wants to get in your car amen
[58:48] he wants you to take him downtown he
[58:51] wants you to
[58:52] take him somewhere amen
[58:55] so you look at this and see now saints
[59:01] he shall give his angels charge
[59:03] concerning thee can you just read that
[59:04] for yourself
[59:05] i'm going to stop for just a moment i
[59:07] want you to read that
[59:08] for yourself amen he shall give his
[59:11] angels charge concerning
[59:14] thee hallelujah
[59:18] my quiet this morning
[59:23] and in their hands they shall bear thee
[59:25] up left at any time thou shalt dash thy
[59:27] feet
[59:27] against a stone jesus said unto him it
[59:30] is written again thou shalt not tempt
[59:32] the lord thy god
[59:34] again the devil taking him up into
[59:36] exceeding high mountain and showing him
[59:38] all the kingdoms of the world
[59:40] and the glory of them and saith unto him
[59:43] all these things will i give thee you
[59:45] have to have in possession to give
[59:48] amen if thou wilt fall down and worship
[59:51] me
[59:51] then saith jesus unto him get thee hints
[59:54] satan
[59:55] for it is written thou shalt worship the
[59:58] lord thy god and him only
[1:00:00] shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth
[1:00:02] him and behold
[1:00:04] angels come and minister unto him
[1:00:07] father we ask for your leadership today
[1:00:10] lord just as we speak your word
[1:00:12] father lord let it only be your word
[1:00:15] your thoughts we pray lord we bind to
[1:00:17] every contrary
[1:00:19] thought and spirit and lord just the
[1:00:22] saints could be
[1:00:22] a free father to worship you today lord
[1:00:26] we thank you let the spirit of
[1:00:27] sleepiness
[1:00:28] lord the spirit of distraction all of
[1:00:30] those be bound in the name of jesus
[1:00:32] christ
[1:00:33] amen amen and amen you may be seated
[1:00:38] as we look at this saints we see a
[1:00:41] formula put in place
[1:00:43] it is uh often times i'm i i look at
[1:00:46] things kind of analytically
[1:00:48] and uh you know i look sometimes for
[1:00:52] for the key words that would unlock a
[1:00:55] things that follow them sometimes the
[1:00:58] keyword actually
[1:00:59] follows what is to be unlocked we get an
[1:01:02] idea
[1:01:03] then we see the key is available to us
[1:01:06] and so here this formula was put in
[1:01:08] place
[1:01:09] one jesus answered and says it is
[1:01:12] written
[1:01:13] amen our one and only position that we
[1:01:15] want to take
[1:01:16] is not i think i feel i want
[1:01:20] but it is written amen so when we can
[1:01:23] come to the place
[1:01:24] we identify with the word of god without
[1:01:28] having to
[1:01:29] adjust it as one brother says some
[1:01:31] people
[1:01:32] like to massage the word of god amen
[1:01:35] slowly molding it into what they believe
[1:01:38] it should say but we're not there we're
[1:01:40] going to stick with the written
[1:01:41] word amen it is written man shall not
[1:01:44] live
[1:01:45] by bread alone but by every word that
[1:01:47] proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[1:01:49] and as we look through this scripture
[1:01:51] this would be maybe homework uh for you
[1:01:53] or something to preach on at another
[1:01:55] time but when you look through the bible
[1:01:58] you will find
[1:01:59] a very uh uh uh strong
[1:02:02] uh continuum of idea or thought about
[1:02:05] being fed
[1:02:07] amen god over and over speaks to us
[1:02:10] about the word the carcass uh the bread
[1:02:14] of life
[1:02:14] all of these things and so we could
[1:02:16] recognize or take a position that as
[1:02:18] sons and daughters of god
[1:02:20] we don't just get saved we don't just
[1:02:22] get the holy ghost
[1:02:24] and then just go on as though nothing
[1:02:26] happened
[1:02:27] we are fed we we have to come back just
[1:02:30] as it is in the natural
[1:02:31] we have to come back to the word of god
[1:02:34] and feed over and over and over again
[1:02:38] now my brother and sister i i don't have
[1:02:40] a problem if you like things like mac
[1:02:42] and cheese and
[1:02:43] and you like some of that stuff you know
[1:02:45] i know believers good
[1:02:46] strong i think they're real christians
[1:02:48] that actually eat snack ramen
[1:02:50] and so you look at these kind of things
[1:02:52] my brother and sister
[1:02:54] we're not trying to take it in a context
[1:02:56] but i will tell you that if you
[1:02:58] quit eating or your diet is made up of
[1:03:01] things that have no
[1:03:03] real uh nutritional value now some
[1:03:06] people don't like us speaking on this
[1:03:07] but i believe that it's necessary
[1:03:10] that we we kind of have a reminder
[1:03:12] because there's spirits in the land
[1:03:14] my brother and sister if you want to
[1:03:16] have a diet of god sent a prophet
[1:03:18] i i have to say amen to that i'm so
[1:03:21] thankful i can't even tell you
[1:03:23] how thankful i am but the scripture says
[1:03:26] that we're going to go where the carcass
[1:03:28] is
[1:03:28] and the carcass is the word amen now
[1:03:31] without a prophet
[1:03:32] to lead us or point to the carcass we
[1:03:35] would be lost we would still be
[1:03:37] catholics and baptists and methodists
[1:03:39] and whatever or maybe just
[1:03:41] nothing at all but you look at this and
[1:03:43] realize that
[1:03:44] in that god did not want us to just stop
[1:03:47] and focus that he sent a prophet
[1:03:49] amen that is actually kind of looking
[1:03:52] back from our position today
[1:03:54] in a historical thing now that god sent
[1:03:56] a prophet now look at the supernatural
[1:03:58] let's just stop for a moment
[1:03:59] look at this supernatural things uh that
[1:04:02] happened in uh uh well it wouldn't be
[1:04:05] some of you's generation but uh
[1:04:07] in most of us here today's generation
[1:04:10] amen the 20th century look at the
[1:04:12] supernatural things that were happening
[1:04:14] they were hearts discerned minds
[1:04:18] discerned see there's a difference there
[1:04:20] amen there was healing and there was
[1:04:23] supernatural power
[1:04:24] amen i knew there was something there
[1:04:27] that's the color of sister jerry's hair
[1:04:29] my look at that um there was
[1:04:31] supernatural events that took place
[1:04:34] and uh in our midst i'm going to put it
[1:04:36] in a present tense
[1:04:38] in our midst supernatural can someone
[1:04:40] say amen
[1:04:41] it wasn't just some superficial but it
[1:04:44] was supernatural
[1:04:46] it was in a sense other than being a
[1:04:48] christian
[1:04:49] uh unexplainable how a little girl could
[1:04:52] be there having had uh
[1:04:54] uh it passes my mind right now just have
[1:04:56] the image in my mind
[1:04:58] but there she is in her braces it was
[1:05:00] like polio or whatever
[1:05:01] and and you know the picture i would
[1:05:03] call it around the message as being
[1:05:04] famous
[1:05:05] there's the mother and she's there and
[1:05:07] there's that little girl
[1:05:11] it's not superficial saints that that
[1:05:15] little girl who was committed to her
[1:05:17] life
[1:05:18] to be on those braces
[1:05:21] walked again without any support
[1:05:24] that is not something that we can just
[1:05:26] brush to the side and say oh that's
[1:05:28] wonderful that is the supernatural
[1:05:32] coming down my brother and sister you we
[1:05:35] can sit here today and say well praise
[1:05:37] the lord that was for the prophet
[1:05:39] no it wasn't i can take you clearly in
[1:05:41] the word of god
[1:05:42] that's for sons and daughters of god in
[1:05:44] our generation
[1:05:46] to have that kind of authority in the
[1:05:49] word of
[1:05:50] god amen it's satan like that sneaky
[1:05:53] little coyote today
[1:05:55] that's cornering the sheep in the corner
[1:05:57] and they are there going i just hope i
[1:05:59] survive later to see a much less be
[1:06:02] some phenomena as it were of laodicea
[1:06:05] to speak the word i'm just hoping i can
[1:06:07] just hold on
[1:06:09] well hallelujah maybe god brother jason
[1:06:11] and i joke for just a second you know
[1:06:13] amen maybe god will just send a pastor a
[1:06:15] preacher evangelist a teacher
[1:06:17] that will come out and stop and stand in
[1:06:19] the middle of the road
[1:06:20] and say devil get out of here
[1:06:24] we are sheep we are not of your kind we
[1:06:28] are not of your world
[1:06:30] we are sons and daughters of god
[1:06:34] oh we can get excited kathleen i don't
[1:06:36] mean to set you up but we can get
[1:06:37] excited about that
[1:06:38] but what about the bride of christ
[1:06:41] getting into her position
[1:06:43] looking out and seeing that old devil
[1:06:45] and saying
[1:06:46] in the name of jesus christ i blind you
[1:06:49] satan
[1:06:50] amen it's one thing to give it to a
[1:06:51] great man of god a powerful prayer
[1:06:54] warrior
[1:06:54] give it to a man that god has manifested
[1:06:56] to but i want to ask you what about you
[1:07:00] did god call you just to sit on a pew
[1:07:02] twice a week
[1:07:03] did god call you just to look through
[1:07:05] your bible a few times a week
[1:07:07] no he didn't he called you to be
[1:07:10] warriors
[1:07:11] amen to recognize the enemy and know the
[1:07:14] ground that the enemy would approach you
[1:07:16] on
[1:07:17] you say what ground is that brother paul
[1:07:19] i say each one of us has a weakness in
[1:07:21] the flesh
[1:07:22] the prophet of god told us when you
[1:07:23] recognize that weakness in your life
[1:07:26] cover it up with the blood don't just
[1:07:28] say well i i just hope or i pray or
[1:07:31] i think or whatever no take the blood
[1:07:34] cover it up and then walk with
[1:07:37] confidence as sons and daughters of god
[1:07:39] hallelujah what satan would like to do
[1:07:41] is get us to where we're afraid
[1:07:43] oh saints listen to me he'd like to get
[1:07:46] us to the place that we're afraid to
[1:07:48] stand up
[1:07:49] and take a stand because we're afraid
[1:07:52] how loud he'll roar
[1:07:54] the next day
[1:07:59] well go ahead satan roar
[1:08:02] you might even have a bike you might
[1:08:04] even get a bite
[1:08:08] but you won't be victorious
[1:08:11] the word says amen it is written
[1:08:16] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:08:18] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:08:20] mouth of god
[1:08:21] our second part of the formula it is
[1:08:24] written
[1:08:25] again thou shalt not tempt the lord
[1:08:28] thy god now my brother and sister i'm
[1:08:31] going to apply this in a slightly
[1:08:32] different fashion
[1:08:33] you cannot go out here and flirt with
[1:08:36] the devil
[1:08:36] and expect god to run to your rescue
[1:08:39] every single time
[1:08:40] amen you get to the place that you want
[1:08:43] to flirt with the devil
[1:08:44] you're walking on thin ice anyhow amen
[1:08:47] and you come to the place that just time
[1:08:49] and time again
[1:08:50] you'll go out here and flirt with these
[1:08:51] things of the world you'll immerse
[1:08:53] yourselves in the things of the world
[1:08:55] oh hallelujah i'm preaching to you amen
[1:08:58] i'm not talking to just you i'm talking
[1:09:00] to me too you can't go
[1:09:02] out there and just keep flirting with
[1:09:04] that and not expect to leave
[1:09:06] some kind of a bite in your life
[1:09:09] satan will leave his mark will god
[1:09:11] forgive you will god heal you from that
[1:09:13] yes he will but you go out there my
[1:09:15] brother and sister and you give him the
[1:09:17] opportunity to bite you he'll bite you
[1:09:19] hallelujah
[1:09:21] amen the third part of the formula get
[1:09:24] the hints
[1:09:24] satan amen we're not standing at the
[1:09:27] door inviting him in
[1:09:29] we are chasing him out
[1:09:33] get thee satan once again look at this
[1:09:36] for it is written amen hallelujah
[1:09:39] thou shall worship the lord thy god and
[1:09:41] him only shalt thou
[1:09:42] serve amen now verse 11
[1:09:45] come down and said the devil leaveth him
[1:09:48] and behold the angels came and
[1:09:49] ministered unto him
[1:09:50] now saints i'll tell you what in the
[1:09:52] time of struggle the time of trouble
[1:09:54] if we'll just cry out to the lord if
[1:09:56] we'll call him
[1:09:58] on the scene if we'll resist the devil
[1:10:00] i'm i'm
[1:10:01] telling you now uh using this type here
[1:10:04] the angels will come down
[1:10:05] and minister to you but you've got to
[1:10:08] stand up you've got to have some kind of
[1:10:09] resistance
[1:10:10] and say you know what satan it is
[1:10:12] written i may not have the authority to
[1:10:14] as it were to cast you out satan
[1:10:16] i might not have many things that we see
[1:10:19] in our lord jesus christ or in a
[1:10:20] prophet's ministry
[1:10:22] but i'm a daughter of god i'm a son of
[1:10:24] god and i'm telling you get out of here
[1:10:27] i'm going to stick with the bible i'm
[1:10:28] going to stick with the word
[1:10:30] amen and i want you to get out of here
[1:10:32] and when you'll stand with that kind of
[1:10:34] resistance this is not something a big
[1:10:36] chess beating
[1:10:38] satan leave
[1:10:41] no just stand in your humble position as
[1:10:45] a daughter or son of god
[1:10:46] and say you know what i i've been sealed
[1:10:49] by the blood of jesus christ
[1:10:50] and satan you've got nothing to fear
[1:10:52] from me but the word
[1:10:54] that is within me you can't overcome
[1:10:58] see we got to get the word from being
[1:11:00] external to get it internal
[1:11:02] some people struggle with that they're
[1:11:04] like well i don't know you know
[1:11:05] the idea well the holy ghost is in me
[1:11:08] and and but no
[1:11:09] no my brother and sister the prophet of
[1:11:10] god said it was all god
[1:11:13] i've got god in me amen i don't have
[1:11:15] just some form i don't have some
[1:11:17] ideology i don't have some verbage i've
[1:11:19] got god
[1:11:21] and when we recognize that it's actually
[1:11:23] god in
[1:11:24] us amen we do believe the prophet's
[1:11:26] message don't we
[1:11:28] amen i'm not just talking from my hat
[1:11:31] amen he said god
[1:11:32] is in you amen now you don't have to
[1:11:36] stand and scream and holler
[1:11:37] if you've got god in you amen and
[1:11:39] lucifer has been trying
[1:11:41] all these generations to overcome god
[1:11:44] but the word declares that in the end he
[1:11:46] failed anyhow
[1:11:48] and so what he's got to do is before you
[1:11:50] get to the end of the book
[1:11:52] he's got to convince you that you're not
[1:11:58] you know saints i i'm a terrible person
[1:12:00] i love to read
[1:12:02] sisters who bless her heart has bought
[1:12:04] me a lot of books through the years and

[1:12:31] realize is god anointed you

[1:12:46] prophet was

[1:12:56] about you this and you that and you can

[1:13:02] god

[1:13:52] mentality was

[1:16:08] i hope you don't mind we just backtrack
[1:16:10] a little bit
[1:16:11] amen revelations 2 24 25 but unto you
[1:16:14] i say and to the rest of tatara as many
[1:16:17] as have not this doctrine
[1:16:18] and which have not known the depths of
[1:16:21] satan
[1:16:22] as they speak i will put on you none
[1:16:24] other burden
[1:16:25] but that which ye have already hold fast
[1:16:28] till i come
[1:16:29] now before we go into the promise let me
[1:16:31] show you again that the church as spoken
[1:16:33] of by the spirit in this book
[1:16:35] has two vines whose interwinding
[1:16:38] branches compose it now my brother and
[1:16:41] sister do you catch that it's
[1:16:42] interwinding
[1:16:43] in other words as we are going to come
[1:16:45] here now this is just a time nobody take
[1:16:47] to this
[1:16:47] when we come here we're not going to be
[1:16:49] able to come right out in the
[1:16:50] congregation amongst the body of christ
[1:16:52] with as it were even a spiritual hatchet
[1:16:54] and just start hacking away
[1:16:55] amen the word will do that man don't
[1:16:58] need to men don't need to come and
[1:17:00] condemn you
[1:17:02] the word is the two-edged sword
[1:17:05] amen in fact it's sharper than a
[1:17:08] two-edged sword
[1:17:09] now i've seen those little swords these
[1:17:11] guys like to make them
[1:17:12] i've seen one of those where the guy
[1:17:14] says let me show you this and he took
[1:17:15] that thing it was about that long sword
[1:17:17] gleaming
[1:17:18] all embedded with all kinds of gold and
[1:17:20] had some real precious gems in it
[1:17:22] and he said just hold up a piece of
[1:17:23] paper and i'm like i ain't holding up no
[1:17:25] paper with you swinging that thing
[1:17:26] around
[1:17:27] he said i ain't swinging in anywhere i
[1:17:28] held up a piece of paper he let the
[1:17:30] weight of the blade come down on that
[1:17:31] paper and it just went
[1:17:33] zip through it not a wrinkle not a tear
[1:17:38] cut that paper perfectly
[1:17:41] you think about it sharper
[1:17:44] sharper than that oh
[1:17:47] hallelujah so while this thing is
[1:17:49] interwinding itself into the body of
[1:17:52] believers into the church that we call
[1:17:54] the body of christ
[1:17:55] amen that sword is there my brother and
[1:17:57] sister and in the right season
[1:17:59] that sword will start to carve those
[1:18:01] things out
[1:18:02] and cut it away but i say unto you and
[1:18:06] unto the rest and thy tire as many as
[1:18:08] have not this doctrine there it is
[1:18:10] he is speaking to the two groups one has
[1:18:12] a doctrine
[1:18:13] another house not there they are now i
[1:18:15] don't want anybody to misunderstand
[1:18:17] my brother and sister we're not pointing
[1:18:19] this in anybody but it's my job
[1:18:20] to lay a groundwork that you as a son or
[1:18:22] daughter of god know where you stand
[1:18:25] amen we're not here to throw stones
[1:18:27] because if we was i would put right up
[1:18:29] on this screen
[1:18:30] the quotes of what people said and
[1:18:32] things that were done
[1:18:33] and then we would just bash that but
[1:18:35] that's not what it's about i want to see
[1:18:36] you make a rapture
[1:18:38] and now if god anoints us to have to
[1:18:41] deal with
[1:18:41] issues do you want me to shirk my duty
[1:18:44] amen so we're not throwing stones at no
[1:18:47] one so i i don't want that spirit to
[1:18:49] take root here that brother paul's
[1:18:50] throwing stones because
[1:18:51] you know i was a pretty good pitcher in
[1:18:53] high school and i don't need to just
[1:18:55] like lob the stone i can throw it pretty
[1:18:56] straight
[1:18:58] amen as many as how that's not there it
[1:19:02] is he's speaking to
[1:19:04] two groups one has a doctor and another
[1:19:05] house not there they are scattered
[1:19:08] abroad across the nation with each one's
[1:19:10] doctrine opposing
[1:19:11] the other one is of god knowing his
[1:19:14] depths the other of satan
[1:19:16] knowing the depths of satan i will put
[1:19:19] upon you none other burden
[1:19:20] the word for burden is weight or
[1:19:23] pressure
[1:19:24] amen so whatever pressure is present in
[1:19:26] your life is because god
[1:19:28] allowed it to be there god said this
[1:19:30] pressure
[1:19:31] is necessary for paul haley to make a
[1:19:34] rapture
[1:19:36] whoa but i could sit in my room and say
[1:19:40] oh
[1:19:40] woe is me or i can say thank you lord
[1:19:44] that you're so mindful of me you put
[1:19:47] just the right amount of pressure on me
[1:19:52] oh hallelujah oh
[1:19:55] my i could give you about a hundred
[1:19:57] examples that are relevant to that but
[1:19:59] we
[1:19:59] don't have that time amen now look the
[1:20:03] pressure of the dark
[1:20:04] ages was either bend or be broken that
[1:20:06] pressure
[1:20:07] is still present amen
[1:20:11] bow or die it was the inquisition the
[1:20:14] power of the empire backing up satanic
[1:20:16] worship
[1:20:17] i'm telling you my brother and sister
[1:20:18] you can't pray in school
[1:20:20] but you can bring all kinds of satanic
[1:20:24] symbols
[1:20:26] you can't have a cross of calvary and
[1:20:28] walk your child walk into a public
[1:20:30] school
[1:20:30] but a child can walk in with a satanic
[1:20:33] symbol on a t-shirt
[1:20:34] and no one says anything
[1:20:37] young people remember music manipulation
[1:20:40] they're symbols they're signs there's
[1:20:42] things it's all relevant
[1:20:44] and it's there those kids walk in there
[1:20:45] my brother and sister they walk into the
[1:20:47] schools with t-shirts on
[1:20:48] that have skulls dripping blood from big
[1:20:51] teeth and all this kind of stuff
[1:20:52] no problem walk in there with a picture
[1:20:55] of the crucifixion of jesus christ and
[1:20:56] they expel them
[1:20:58] tell me it's not the day my brother and
[1:21:00] sister tell me it's not the day amen
[1:21:03] each age had its pressures for example a
[1:21:07] great burden of the last age is the
[1:21:08] pressure of riches
[1:21:10] now you know what not one of us here
[1:21:11] today i touched on this the other day
[1:21:13] but not one of us here would say we're
[1:21:14] rich
[1:21:16] but let me take you to different part of
[1:21:18] the world let me take you around the
[1:21:21] other side of the world just go ahead
[1:21:22] and pinpoint yourself on the globe on
[1:21:24] the other side of the world
[1:21:26] and you'll find out that we as americans
[1:21:27] are rich
[1:21:29] whether you think so or not the pressure
[1:21:33] of riches well i've got a lifestyle i've
[1:21:36] got to maintain it i have to work my 60
[1:21:38] 70 80 hours to live this lifestyle and

[1:21:46] need you to work on sunday okay no
[1:21:48] problem i'll go work on sunday because
[1:21:50] wow is that a blessing from almighty god

[1:21:57] satan's
[1:21:58] slippery amen
[1:22:01] pressure of riches soft living and
[1:22:04] nervous tensions
[1:22:05] in a complex age now i know none of you
[1:22:08] are ever nervous but there's times i
[1:22:10] find myself so nervous
[1:22:12] i had a brother say oh brother paul you
[1:22:13] look so calm when you walk up to preach
[1:22:15] that's because all my bones have turned
[1:22:17] to jelly

[1:22:20] along
[1:22:22] as i head to the pulpit yeah i know
[1:22:25] there's no nervous walking because jelly
[1:22:27] doesn't get nervous

[1:23:14] offend anyone your child is a
[1:23:17] fifth grader or so in school and they
[1:23:21] want to teach them
[1:23:22] the intimacies of life at that age
[1:23:27] that's complex no longer can children be
[1:23:31] children children or an object and the
[1:23:34] more
[1:23:34] children we control that means we've won
[1:23:37] or lost
[1:23:38] no my brother and sister ten thousand
[1:23:41] worlds ten thousand worlds ten thousand
[1:23:43] worlds
[1:23:43] it's not a matter of who we are and what
[1:23:46] we control
[1:23:47] it's a matter of putting it in the right
[1:23:49] perspective
[1:23:53] we seem unfitted to live in i say amen
[1:23:58] this fourth age this is this is not even
[1:24:00] talking about our day saints but
[1:24:01] remember how the prophet god showed us
[1:24:02] these spirits carry right on
[1:24:04] a man seems to have a clear-cut burden
[1:24:06] it was to defy rome stand up for the
[1:24:08] word even unto death
[1:24:09] they have not known the depths of satan
[1:24:11] it seems that this verse has been left
[1:24:12] out by the commentators
[1:24:13] for they were not able to figure out
[1:24:15] what doctrine or what experiences are
[1:24:17] meant by this phrase
[1:24:18] actually it is simple to know what is
[1:24:20] men let us first know what is the depth
[1:24:23] of god is
[1:24:24] what the depth of god is oh my saints
[1:24:27] come on i want you to do sometimes we
[1:24:29] preach about
[1:24:30] negative things i don't mean to set an
[1:24:32] atmosphere about negative things like oh
[1:24:34] brother paul's always just hammering on
[1:24:36] that
[1:24:36] but my brother and sister as we press
[1:24:38] into the word of god
[1:24:39] we have a prayer life we read our bibles
[1:24:41] can we say amen to that
[1:24:43] we're pressing into the things of god we
[1:24:46] start to realize
[1:24:47] the depth of who god is and the more
[1:24:50] grace that you know the more grace you
[1:24:52] can bestow
[1:24:54] hallelujah if you've never known grace
[1:24:56] then you don't know what grace is
[1:24:57] but when you have fallen and god has
[1:25:00] poured grace out upon you
[1:25:01] it's a lot easier to look at someone and
[1:25:03] say god just please
[1:25:04] touch them amen there's no eject button
[1:25:08] there's no dump button there's no throw
[1:25:10] em out button
[1:25:10] because by god's grace you realize if
[1:25:13] without his grace that would be you
[1:25:16] hallelujah but you look at this and the
[1:25:18] prophet of god is taking this example
[1:25:20] saints
[1:25:21] that you cannot know the depths of satan
[1:25:24] unless you have come to the depths of
[1:25:27] god
[1:25:27] now let me put it a little stronger to
[1:25:29] you if god is a superficial element to
[1:25:32] you
[1:25:32] then satan will be a superficial element
[1:25:35] to you
[1:25:36] if you have by the grace of god knowing
[1:25:38] the power of almighty
[1:25:40] god and seen the supernatural you will
[1:25:42] recognize that that equal or opposite
[1:25:45] force
[1:25:46] satan is there and he will be just that
[1:25:49] little nothing in the side of the pit
[1:25:51] but he isn't there now
[1:25:55] people who trivialize him now pay the
[1:25:58] price
[1:25:58] for trivializing him
[1:26:02] now saints the word says we'll put him
[1:26:05] under our feet
[1:26:07] that doesn't mean he's trivial
[1:26:10] that means it shows the massive
[1:26:12] incredible awesome
[1:26:13] glorious power of my god
[1:26:18] that holds him under your feet
[1:26:22] as a conquered as a vanquished enemy
[1:26:25] it's a powerful god he's not just a
[1:26:27] little wiggle wiggle down there and
[1:26:29] you've got a foot on him
[1:26:31] he's powerful but the power of god is
[1:26:33] promised to be displayed
[1:26:35] in the bride of christ through the word
[1:26:37] of god revealed in this hour
[1:26:39] it would come and manifest that the word
[1:26:42] is
[1:26:43] all revealed the word is all-powerful
[1:26:46] the word is capable
[1:26:50] oh pardon me for not having better
[1:26:54] vocabulary but we just have to realize
[1:26:57] see you can't know the depths of satan
[1:26:59] without knowing the depths of god
[1:27:03] that's why my brother and sister we live
[1:27:05] in a world where people do satanic
[1:27:07] worship and they do all these kind of
[1:27:08] things and think nothing of it they're
[1:27:10] just like oh i know it's just no
[1:27:11] different
[1:27:12] i mean i could have been a buddha
[1:27:15] you realize why they can say that it
[1:27:17] stumps us especially as older generation
[1:27:19] stumps us
[1:27:20] is how they can be so just just you know
[1:27:23] nothing just now i mean go to the occult
[1:27:27] or become a buddha or become a whatever
[1:27:30] no big deal you know why they do that
[1:27:33] because they don't know the depths of
[1:27:34] god
[1:27:35] they have no clue what they're dealing
[1:27:38] with
[1:27:39] no clue at all now i told you about that
[1:27:42] video clip about how
[1:27:43] they're just showing this showing these
[1:27:45] kids if your parents make you
[1:27:47] make your bed and clean up your clothes
[1:27:49] that you just take something from your
[1:27:50] room something special to you
[1:27:52] go find a place in the woods go lay that
[1:27:54] down and offer it
[1:28:00] yeah yuck is right but you see what
[1:28:03] they're doing did they ever say you know
[1:28:04] what
[1:28:05] got a problem with your parents turn to
[1:28:07] jesus
[1:28:09] no no and they play with that
[1:28:13] because they have no idea of the depths
[1:28:15] of god so they have no idea of the
[1:28:17] depths
[1:28:18] of satan
[1:28:26] there's about 10 avenues to go off of
[1:28:28] that and most of you wouldn't like me to
[1:28:30] even venture down the first one much
[1:28:31] less get to number 10. so
[1:28:33] we'll just move on here you see my
[1:28:36] brother and sister ephesians 3 16 says
[1:28:39] that he would grant you
[1:28:40] according to the riches of his goal to
[1:28:42] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[1:28:46] on the flesh
[1:28:52] no because the prophet of god said you
[1:28:54] can be anointed on the flesh all the
[1:28:55] days of your life and go to hell
[1:28:57] this anointing's going to make it down
[1:28:59] into the inner man
[1:29:00] you know what i want to do hallelujah i
[1:29:02] hope you all don't mind here under my
[1:29:04] tie i got a zipper
[1:29:05] and i'm just going to go ahead and unzip
[1:29:06] this here and i'm just going to invite
[1:29:09] the lord in
[1:29:12] got you all nervous somebody's like
[1:29:14] what's he doing
[1:29:16] but you got to do that you got to do
[1:29:18] that saying you got to unzip that and
[1:29:19] say lord come in
[1:29:21] the inner man it's not going to do on
[1:29:22] the outside we can jump shout sing we
[1:29:25] can sing like angels and we can sing all
[1:29:27] night my brother and sister
[1:29:28] that won't make the holy spirit move
[1:29:32] in fact as i have been a little bit
[1:29:34] vocal about that bale pior was one giant
[1:29:37] concert
[1:29:38] god never forgave him for it
[1:29:41] study it out see that's the problem
[1:29:44] people don't even bother to study it's
[1:29:45] just another chunk of scripture this
[1:29:47] flake right over it like no big deal
[1:29:48] that was a long time ago
[1:29:50] i'm sorry that spirit never died they
[1:29:52] went down there and worshiped together
[1:29:54] god said you don't belong there i don't
[1:29:56] want mixers i want separators
[1:29:58] amen now people don't like that
[1:30:00] preaching they think you're defending
[1:30:01] turf no
[1:30:01] saints i'm going to be a little rough
[1:30:03] with you for just a moment you go to
[1:30:05] church where you want to go to church
[1:30:07] you have no obligation to come to this
[1:30:09] building or sit under this ministry
[1:30:11] but i'm telling you right now you need
[1:30:13] to know what your friends
[1:30:15] believe because they can believe all
[1:30:18] kinds of things
[1:30:20] and just not speak it to you and then
[1:30:23] you go along all chummy tummy and then
[1:30:24] you wonder why chaos and all hell if you
[1:30:26] don't mind me saying that word has come
[1:30:28] to your life
[1:30:29] amen we'll touch on that in just a
[1:30:31] minute i actually have a quote
[1:30:33] that wasn't an accident that was
[1:30:34] intentional in case anybody wanted to
[1:30:36] know
[1:30:38] hallelujah am i being too mean
[1:30:41] saints i want to see you make a rapture
[1:30:44] i i don't want you to be out here
[1:30:45] playing
[1:30:46] namby pamby whatever with the devil and
[1:30:48] then wonder why you missed the rapture
[1:30:51] i want you to buckle down have a little
[1:30:53] grit be real men
[1:30:54] real women and say you know what even
[1:30:57] though it hurt the word says it i'm
[1:30:59] going to stand with it
[1:31:00] amen hallelujah because people i
[1:31:04] don't go into any greater detail but
[1:31:06] people quit church because they're
[1:31:07] offended for their friend
[1:31:10] we don't even know if the friend was
[1:31:12] offended they're just offended for their
[1:31:13] friend
[1:31:14] and they quit come on saints prophet of
[1:31:18] god said that the word can't offend the
[1:31:19] word
[1:31:20] the word in you cannot be offended by
[1:31:22] the word be preached
[1:31:24] oh that doesn't mean that a man can be
[1:31:26] mean and ugly about it and then
[1:31:27] retreat to the word and call it his
[1:31:29] excuse
[1:31:30] we're talking about the word preached in
[1:31:32] love
[1:31:34] amen see when a man experiences the
[1:31:36] depth of god in his life it's an actual
[1:31:38] personal experience of the spirit of god
[1:31:40] indwelling him
[1:31:42] now this is something here again i've
[1:31:44] already started down this path i guess
[1:31:45] i'll just kind of trot down it just a
[1:31:46] little further
[1:31:47] my brother and sister i preached it
[1:31:49] before i preached in a
[1:31:51] a different church and people got
[1:31:53] offended but
[1:31:54] you see my brother and sister if we're
[1:31:56] not careful we're going to go back to
[1:31:57] being a people
[1:31:58] that are looking to stories and looking
[1:32:00] to icons
[1:32:02] and looking to as it were historical
[1:32:04] events
[1:32:05] amen that spirit is amongst us amen
[1:32:09] i have a good friend i love the man he
[1:32:11] looked at me one time i've set in
[1:32:12] brother branham's rocking chair
[1:32:14] well praise the lord i never have never
[1:32:16] have and i doubt if i'll ever be invited
[1:32:18] to sit in that rocking chair
[1:32:20] but i i wanted to ask him i kind of did
[1:32:22] in a way what did it do for you
[1:32:26] now we know that being thrown in on a
[1:32:27] prophet's bones amen i'm not saying that
[1:32:29] something wouldn't happen there saints
[1:32:31] but you see i'm not looking for an icon
[1:32:35] i'm not looking for something like that
[1:32:37] amen i'm not insulting this man i
[1:32:39] actually love this man
[1:32:40] i could tell you the story how far it
[1:32:42] goes back goes right back into my
[1:32:43] childhood
[1:32:44] i love this man but my brother and
[1:32:45] sister i'm sorry i don't care if you sit
[1:32:47] in that rocking chair every sunday
[1:32:49] afternoon for the rest of your life
[1:32:50] you still got to be born again you got
[1:32:52] to feed on the word of god you've got to
[1:32:54] pray for revelation
[1:32:55] and you've got to stand up and confess
[1:32:57] it from the heart that i
[1:32:59] am a believer see this is nothing about
[1:33:03] it amen
[1:33:04] i i was thrilled years ago we got to go
[1:33:06] down to tucson go through brother
[1:33:08] branham's house
[1:33:08] they weren't letting people go through
[1:33:10] the house at that time but
[1:33:11] you know that's i guess kind of maybe
[1:33:13] privilege or whatever
[1:33:15] i don't mean to put it that way but you
[1:33:16] know we were invited to go ahead and
[1:33:18] walk through the house and
[1:33:19] we got to go through the library and we
[1:33:21] got to have a little more personal side
[1:33:23] of
[1:33:23] of a visitation there my brother and
[1:33:25] sister that was neat i lapped it up you
[1:33:27] might say just like everybody else did
[1:33:29] oh my look at this brother brown's guns
[1:33:31] here's his trophies there's a caribou
[1:33:33] here's a bear but in the end i have to
[1:33:36] have the holy ghost
[1:33:39] i've got to have a prayer life i've got
[1:33:40] to read my bible
[1:33:42] amen
[1:33:47] look i don't mean to make light of this
[1:33:48] but nobody's going to walk in that day
[1:33:50] to the white throne judgment and say
[1:33:51] i saw the bear yeah that's right they
[1:33:54] ain't going to do it
[1:33:56] hallelujah okay i'll try to be kinder
[1:33:59] for the rest of the service
[1:34:01] maybe time we leave some of you will
[1:34:02] smile at me
[1:34:06] but look at this i'm kind of jumping
[1:34:08] around forgive me but the depths of
[1:34:10] satan will be in that he will attempt to
[1:34:11] destroy this
[1:34:13] see what god wants is to have the spirit
[1:34:15] of god himself
[1:34:17] indwelling and his mind be illuminated
[1:34:19] by the wisdom and the knowledge of god
[1:34:21] through the word but the depths of satan
[1:34:24] will be that he will attempt to destroy
[1:34:26] this what will he do he'll take it back
[1:34:28] you know what my brother and sister do
[1:34:30] you know i'm capable of preaching
[1:34:31] sermons i know you guys some of you will
[1:34:33] be shocked
[1:34:34] i'm capable of preaching sermons that
[1:34:36] you all walk out with this warm
[1:34:38] fuzzy feeling oh
[1:34:41] my that was so wonderful hallelujah
[1:34:48] come on anybody want to be warm and
[1:34:50] fuzzy today we can finish the sermon
[1:34:52] that way
[1:34:54] but i can assure you that warm and fuzzy
[1:34:55] won't get you in a rapture
[1:34:58] when you got an adversary standing right
[1:35:00] outside well brother brown said he comes
[1:35:01] to church so he's sitting somewhere on a
[1:35:03] pew around here
[1:35:04] hey man that warm and fuzzy ain't going
[1:35:06] to do it amen i want you to be real
[1:35:09] warriors
[1:35:10] goes back and study uh part of the 101st
[1:35:13] airborne going to vietnam
[1:35:15] uh they're they're training the the uh i
[1:35:17] think he was a captain at that time
[1:35:19] uh training guys they were down there in
[1:35:21] georgia in the sweltering swamps and he
[1:35:24] ran them guys till they collapsed
[1:35:26] and he run them and he did stuff and
[1:35:28] finally in the very end he took them out
[1:35:30] there
[1:35:30] and wire and mud and real machine gun
[1:35:33] bullets over their head just
[1:35:34] just barely where they had to crawl with
[1:35:36] their face in the mud and they're all
[1:35:37] like we hate you
[1:35:39] but did you know that that particular
[1:35:40] unit or brigade or whatever it was gets
[1:35:43] to vietnam had the lowest casualty rate
[1:35:46] of any unit that went to vietnam and
[1:35:48] when they were there
[1:35:50] i hope you see the spiritual side of
[1:35:52] this when they were there they started
[1:35:54] coming to him when they
[1:35:56] saw other units being just wiped out and
[1:35:58] they come and they started to thank him
[1:36:02] i say to you i hope someday we can stand
[1:36:04] together and this sounds a little
[1:36:05] selfish but i hope you can look at me at
[1:36:07] that time and say i understand it now
[1:36:09] brother paul
[1:36:10] i understand it amen we don't want
[1:36:13] casualty rates here
[1:36:15] amen we want every son and daughter of
[1:36:16] god in this building this morning
[1:36:18] to make a rapture stand in the presence
[1:36:20] of almighty god
[1:36:21] hallelujah and we don't want to lose the
[1:36:23] one some people just take this idea
[1:36:25] where we lost some here and we lost some
[1:36:27] here no big deal
[1:36:28] no it's real to me saints i don't i
[1:36:30] don't want to see it
[1:36:32] amen he's going to make a substitute for
[1:36:34] the reality of god now wednesday night
[1:36:36] we preached on those things
[1:36:38] real realization amen partial versus
[1:36:43] complete

[1:36:49] knowledge of the truth of god
[1:36:52] saints i want you can i can i be
[1:36:54] forceful this morning

[1:37:02] a figurative form okay so you don't

[1:39:22] and i can show you right there god said
[1:39:24] i'll never forgive them
[1:39:28] what the prophet of god say he says sin
[1:39:30] will take you further
[1:39:32] than you wanted to go
[1:39:36] i'm not anti-nothing saints i have no
[1:39:39] problem
[1:39:40] i could sit down and eat a meal with
[1:39:41] anybody
[1:39:43] but when it comes to the house of god
[1:39:45] and worship
[1:39:47] i'm sorry there's some places i ain't
[1:39:49] going
[1:39:51] and i don't care how much advertising
[1:39:53] bail pior's got
[1:39:55] amen that's a little rough and i saw
[1:39:58] some of you are probably feeling like
[1:39:59] i'm skinning on you
[1:40:01] and i'm sorry but just please just
[1:40:02] understand accept it as is god speaking
[1:40:06] because uh you come down here when we
[1:40:08] come to the place
[1:40:10] see he said substitute the personal
[1:40:12] christ he'll do it as he calls israel to
[1:40:14] do the same
[1:40:15] a man they respected they loved said hey
[1:40:18] it's going to be good for
[1:40:19] all of us after all we can trace our
[1:40:22] lineage right back
[1:40:24] and we're all one
[1:40:27] well i'm sorry according to the word
[1:40:31] i'm not
[1:40:34] ouch
[1:40:39] by a human being reigning as king
[1:40:42] instead of going
[1:40:43] now i want to move on i'm laboring on
[1:40:45] something i never intended to labor on
[1:40:47] but my brother and sister when a man
[1:40:48] will look you in the face and says
[1:40:50] well as pastor as a priest as a
[1:40:53] i think you should do this and this and
[1:40:55] this it would be good for your church
[1:40:58] good for you people fellowship is good
[1:41:00] for all of us
[1:41:01] brother paul
[1:41:15] it says here to have true fellowship
[1:41:19] light doesn't have fellowship with
[1:41:20] darkness
[1:41:25] now when i go with the one who tells me
[1:41:28] that that fellowship will be a blessing
[1:41:30] to my church
[1:41:33] who did i listen to
[1:41:41] yeah by a human being reigning as king
[1:41:46] instead of god
[1:41:49] now saints i want to clarify this you go
[1:41:52] where you want to go
[1:41:53] you do what you want to do if you feel
[1:41:56] like brother paul is too hoarse
[1:41:58] then i'm offended in myself not you
[1:42:01] offending me
[1:42:03] i never intend to be harsh but i do
[1:42:05] intend
[1:42:06] to be able to stand one day and hear
[1:42:09] well done
[1:42:10] my good and faithful servant
[1:42:13] amen i don't need the pleasure of man
[1:42:16] here and i would hope that you didn't
[1:42:18] either
[1:42:19] amen but you see the born-again
[1:42:21] experience will be
[1:42:22] rejected in favor of a church joining
[1:42:24] amen
[1:42:25] okay we'll move on this has got some of
[1:42:27] you looking sad i don't want you to
[1:42:28] leave sad today
[1:42:30] hallelujah hallelujah you know
[1:42:33] saints now sometimes these things are a
[1:42:36] little personal okay and
[1:42:38] we're human but i find it interesting
[1:42:41] when
[1:42:42] people who don't agree with you are
[1:42:44] telling you
[1:42:46] why you're actually preaching that
[1:42:49] you preach that because you feel
[1:42:51] insecure
[1:42:54] okay i preach it because i feel insecure
[1:42:57] for them
[1:43:04] ouch as long as god is calling
[1:43:09] it's got to be some formula wonder why i
[1:43:12] used the word formula a little bit ago
[1:43:14] i kind of cheated it's right here in
[1:43:15] this quote it's got to be the same
[1:43:17] formula not shake hands repeat it
[1:43:20] creed be baptized but be baptized
[1:43:23] by the holy ghost and to the body of
[1:43:25] jesus christ
[1:43:26] that's the way the christian church is
[1:43:28] to be run
[1:43:30] not by creeds not by denomination not by
[1:43:32] education not by theology
[1:43:35] but by the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:43:38] to lead men and women he
[1:43:42] will never lead you away from the word
[1:43:44] of god he'll lead you
[1:43:46] right to the word of god because man
[1:43:48] shall not live by bread alone
[1:43:51] but by every word of god that proceeds
[1:43:54] out of the mouth of god
[1:43:56] amen so you know saints i don't want to
[1:43:58] sound like just you know blowing steam
[1:44:00] to you
[1:44:00] the prophet of god stands right behind
[1:44:02] it i am standing right
[1:44:04] in that anointing where he come as a
[1:44:07] prophet to an age
[1:44:08] amen i got no reason you know look
[1:44:10] saints what good would it do for a man
[1:44:12] honestly let's think about it what good
[1:44:14] would it do for a man to go out here and
[1:44:16] build up a following so we can all fail
[1:44:18] together
[1:44:22] i read an interview one time in forbes
[1:44:24] magazine now sorry i like to read this
[1:44:26] kind of things interview of a man
[1:44:27] now he went on to start a business that
[1:44:30] actually was successful
[1:44:31] but it was that he was interviewed by
[1:44:33] forbes magazine
[1:44:35] and uh it was when his business he
[1:44:37] started is just raking in the millions
[1:44:40] of dollars
[1:44:40] and right away the man bought a jet and
[1:44:42] he built a big office building and all
[1:44:44] kinds of stuff
[1:44:45] and then it was about a year or so less
[1:44:48] than a year actually
[1:44:49] after forbes magazine lifted this guy up
[1:44:51] as one of the smartest business managers
[1:44:53] on the face of the earth
[1:44:54] that it turned out that he had bled his
[1:44:56] business dry
[1:44:57] expanding it with money he didn't have
[1:44:59] so almost like a ponzi scheme
[1:45:01] every dime he took in he leveraged that
[1:45:03] to build this business up and he created
[1:45:05] an
[1:45:06] image but it was hollow
[1:45:10] and when someone pulled you know what it
[1:45:12] what is that uh
[1:45:14] conga kanga changa
[1:45:17] when someone pulled that little block
[1:45:19] out boom it's all gone
[1:45:22] but the man later in years come along
[1:45:24] and says that was the hardest lesson i
[1:45:26] ever learned
[1:45:27] i thought i was smarter
[1:45:30] than everyone else let me interject that
[1:45:34] i thought i was more spiritual
[1:45:37] than everyone else well you know what i
[1:45:40] don't need to come out here and try to
[1:45:42] build something saints i'm not here to
[1:45:44] count numbers in fact
[1:45:46] some of you you know i kind of
[1:45:48] understand the comment i don't like it
[1:45:50] if people say
[1:45:50] paul's church it ain't paul's church
[1:45:52] paul didn't build this church paul
[1:45:53] didn't attract you here paul doesn't
[1:45:55] heal you paul doesn't
[1:45:56] come in the midnight hour and give
[1:45:58] relief to you
[1:45:59] amen doesn't give you the strength to
[1:46:01] press on paul didn't do none of that
[1:46:02] paul's right on board with you you look
[1:46:04] over somebody's got a shoulder on the
[1:46:05] wagon you're going to see paul
[1:46:07] there
[1:46:08] i don't want to be sitting in the seat
[1:46:09] up front saying push harder saints
[1:46:13] no paul's land down there in the mud i
[1:46:14] walk the same life that you do
[1:46:16] amen but my brother and sister we got to
[1:46:18] do it by the book
[1:46:20] and that man admitted later as he went
[1:46:22] ahead and built a successful business
[1:46:24] they said well how did you do this you
[1:46:25] have a good business he said i went back
[1:46:27] to what you would call
[1:46:28] the book of business and i built it on a
[1:46:31] sound foundation
[1:46:32] and i followed the rules i thought
[1:46:35] praise the lord that's how it works
[1:46:37] let's do what the lord wants amen
[1:46:40] hallelujah now i i don't think i gave
[1:46:43] this to brother alex in the notes there

[1:46:46] 12 says for we wrestle not against flesh
[1:46:48] and blood
[1:46:49] but against principalities against
[1:46:50] powers against the rulers of darkness of

[1:54:08] these spirits
[1:54:09] they're subtle they put words on the
[1:54:11] table and they're willing to leave them

[1:54:19] see the bride will have what does the
[1:54:22] word have to be
[1:54:23] mean have an option
[1:54:30] i think that means it's complete
[1:54:34] the bride will have to be the rest of
[1:54:36] that body
[1:54:38] and the two in the same car or separate
[1:54:40] living in the same house and roof
[1:54:42] make the body again no no no

[1:54:48] sister i heard her brother put it like
[1:54:49] this once
[1:54:50] he said you may not know what he said
[1:54:51] but when god led me to my wife
[1:54:53] that's a minister he said when when god
[1:54:56] led me to my wife here she was this
[1:54:58] beautiful girl i think she said she was
[1:54:59] about 16 or 17 when they met
[1:55:01] got married when they were like 23 or 24
[1:55:03] took him four or five years to convince
[1:55:04] her
[1:55:06] to marry somebody like him but he said
[1:55:09] what she hadn't caught was a revelation
[1:55:12] that out in
[1:55:13] the heavens her adams and my atoms had
[1:55:17] already crashed
[1:55:20] and you couldn't separate them it just
[1:55:24] took time for her to get that revelation
[1:55:29] that's the way i reason i remember that
[1:55:31] and think about it that's the way i
[1:55:32] always felt about jerry she's like i'm
[1:55:33] marrying that guy
[1:55:35] and i'm like yep um she's going to marry
[1:55:37] me just to me a matter of time
[1:55:39] you know i'll wear her down

[1:55:54] happened is in that coming together
[1:55:57] the true church of christ the bride
[1:56:00] is sold out to him
[1:56:05] oh not there in a resistance not there
[1:56:08] in a pushing back
[1:56:09] not there in a dragging her feet she
[1:56:11] sold out
[1:56:12] hallelujah reminds me of another
[1:56:14] minister and i know him and his wife
[1:56:16] and uh one day you know he started
[1:56:18] preaching at a younger age i think 17 18
[1:56:20] years old and he was about 23 or 24
[1:56:23] and he's preaching at some meetings and
[1:56:25] i think there were youth-oriented
[1:56:26] meetings and
[1:56:27] and this little girl she wasn't the
[1:56:28] prettiest there in fact forgive me to
[1:56:30] even phrase it this way but she's a
[1:56:32] little on the short side a little on the
[1:56:34] side and she's sitting there in church
[1:56:35] amen and she's a listener this young man
[1:56:38] preached
[1:56:38] and she was like lord if you love me let
[1:56:41] me marry him
[1:56:45] and she said the lord loves me
[1:56:51] sounds strange isn't it
[1:56:53] [Music]
[1:56:55] but let me turn that when you
[1:56:59] oh hallelujah brother chris was
[1:57:01] preaching the other day and i'm going to
[1:57:02] ruin a future sermon here
[1:57:04] but my brother and sister
[1:57:07] when rebecca rode up on that camel
[1:57:11] she didn't go over there and say eliezer
[1:57:14] is it all right
[1:57:16] if i get off this camel and go
[1:57:19] see if isaac is the one
[1:57:24] what did eliezer do he painted
[1:57:28] a picture for days maybe weeks
[1:57:31] maybe months this is the man
[1:57:35] you love this is who
[1:57:38] he is this is his nature this is his
[1:57:42] character he is the perfect man rebecca
[1:57:46] can you repeat after me
[1:57:48] he's the perfect one
[1:57:53] and rebecca rides up and she gets that
[1:57:57] old camel to kneel and she jumps off
[1:57:59] that camel
[1:58:00] and she starts running and she went way
[1:58:03] out there
[1:58:04] and she come right back and turned
[1:58:06] around and run right back to that camel
[1:58:08] oh camel thank you for bringing me here
[1:58:11] i thank you for everything you've done
[1:58:12] for me camel you've been so good to me
[1:58:15] you carried me through deserts you
[1:58:16] carried me here
[1:58:20] no i wrote it down i probably ruined it
[1:58:23] for myself but
[1:58:25] my camel's behind me i left my camel
[1:58:28] behind
[1:58:29] it did a job it brought me to my
[1:58:31] bridegroom
[1:58:32] amen i'm not going to be worried about
[1:58:34] what happens to the church grace
[1:58:36] tabernacle they might make a warehouse
[1:58:37] out of it or maybe a dentist office
[1:58:40] i don't care hallelujah
[1:58:43] i see my isaac i see my bridegroom i'm
[1:58:45] gone michael's behind me sings
[1:58:47] i don't need that camel to take me
[1:58:49] anywhere else i've made it to my
[1:58:50] bridegroom
[1:58:51] hallelujah hallelujah see the others
[1:58:55] pregnanted by the word of god and will
[1:58:56] bring forth the body the finished body
[1:58:58] which is the bride and the two together
[1:59:00] i'm jumping right down here
[1:59:02] make one body again like adam was at the
[1:59:05] beginning man his wife are one
[1:59:07] now she the true bride so
[1:59:10] sold out to him that she used no mind of
[1:59:13] her own
[1:59:14] his mind of course is his will and his
[1:59:16] will is his word
[1:59:18] now saints i'll tell you what i'll just
[1:59:20] throw this out now i love my sisters
[1:59:22] around here i hope this doesn't sound
[1:59:23] creepy to anybody here or on the
[1:59:24] internet
[1:59:25] i love you sisters so much it might
[1:59:27] shock you how much i love you
[1:59:29] amen in the proper context
[1:59:33] i die for you i believe
[1:59:36] i do much anything i could do for you
[1:59:39] but see you're somebody else's wife
[1:59:41] you're somebody else's daughter
[1:59:44] we have to have the proper context so
[1:59:46] when we'll look at this my brother and
[1:59:48] sister
[1:59:49] when we as wives now say i can take this
[1:59:53] position
[1:59:54] because i can step into it spiritually
[1:59:57] when we as wives will completely
[2:00:00] serve our husband
[2:00:03] well praise the lord he hasn't taken me
[2:00:05] on a date six months i ain't cooking his
[2:00:07] breakfast
[2:00:10] well praise the lord why don't you cook
[2:00:12] that breakfast
[2:00:14] you butter him up until he's like that
[2:00:16] jelly
[2:00:17] then you can just kind of dress him up
[2:00:20] and just kind of move him along to the
[2:00:21] car
[2:00:23] and he'll wake up and realize he's
[2:00:24] sitting in a nice restaurant somewhere
[2:00:26] looking at the love of his life natural
[2:00:29] life
[2:00:30] come on but anything less than complete
[2:00:35] selling out breeds resentment
[2:00:40] and resentment breeds what
[2:00:46] oh my praise the lord hallelujah i'm
[2:00:49] burning up all your guys's time
[2:00:52] now look at this
[2:00:55] look at jesus defense
[2:00:58] when he was dealing with the devil jesus
[2:01:01] defense was not words such as
[2:01:03] don't you know who i am
[2:01:08] reminds me of a little video a clip i
[2:01:10] seen it was taken by some other patron
[2:01:12] some really fancy restaurant this man
[2:01:14] drives up in a
[2:01:15] very high dollar car i don't remember
[2:01:17] now what it was but like you know very
[2:01:18] high dollar
[2:01:20] and him and his wife girlfriend whatever
[2:01:22] get out and he goes up to the
[2:01:24] the man in the restaurant and the man
[2:01:26] says uh
[2:01:28] seating for two and the man says sir do
[2:01:30] you have a reservation
[2:01:32] and he goes no i don't he says well sir
[2:01:35] we are
[2:01:36] we're filled up and he says don't you
[2:01:40] know who i
[2:01:40] am and this young man it's being filmed
[2:01:44] by somebody
[2:01:44] as you know it's all bobbly and whatever
[2:01:46] they're around people he says don't you
[2:01:48] know who i
[2:01:49] am this young man without breaking a
[2:01:51] face says yes sir i do
[2:01:52] you're a man without a reservation
[2:02:01] come on i'm making my reservations
[2:02:04] you're making your reservations
[2:02:06] we're not going to show up and say hey
[2:02:07] don't you know who i am i i'm the bride
[2:02:09] no i don't have a reservation i don't
[2:02:11] know who you are
[2:02:12] amen we're making our reservations
[2:02:14] hallelujah and you could see other
[2:02:16] people because it was
[2:02:16] there was actually a couple deals there
[2:02:18] and you could see these other couples
[2:02:19] all dressed up real nice and come on up
[2:02:21] there
[2:02:21] and they kind of did a little bird and
[2:02:23] blopped out the names you know but
[2:02:25] here's this other couple man walks his
[2:02:26] wife elderly older couple
[2:02:28] brother david's sister diane's age
[2:02:32] and they were walking up there and they
[2:02:34] said well
[2:02:35] our name is and they bleep that out you
[2:02:37] know so that
[2:02:38] and the man takes and gets everything
[2:02:41] and escorts him right in
[2:02:44] god have a name you gotta have a
[2:02:47] reservation
[2:02:48] you gotta have that my brother and
[2:02:50] sister
[2:02:51] amen because she's so sold out
[2:02:56] lord help us now sisters i'm not doing
[2:02:59] this in any behest of any brothers
[2:03:01] amen but i'm telling you take it
[2:03:03] spiritual we got to be completely sold
[2:03:05] out
[2:03:06] jesus didn't come and say don't you know
[2:03:08] who i am amen
[2:03:10] you see if that had been so my brother
[2:03:12] and sister then we would show up dealing
[2:03:14] with the devil and say
[2:03:15] don't you know who i am he'd say that's
[2:03:17] right you're trash
[2:03:21] study what the prophet of god said he
[2:03:23] said the devil knows the bible a lot
[2:03:24] better than you do
[2:03:25] better than you ever will and he
[2:03:28] believes it
[2:03:32] so we can deal with the devil don't you
[2:03:34] know who i am
[2:03:35] yeah you were a drug addict last week
[2:03:38] and you're here still sloppy you're
[2:03:40] lusting in the flesh yesterday you did
[2:03:42] this you did that you stole the gum
[2:03:44] yeah i know who you are
[2:03:49] yeah that's how it works
[2:03:52] that's not usable for a babe in christ
[2:03:56] now maybe somewhere down the road a
[2:03:59] mature christian
[2:04:00] would be able to say don't you know who
[2:04:02] i am the word said i'm a daughter of god
[2:04:04] i am the other half of jesus christ
[2:04:08] amen i have a word for that i have
[2:04:10] scripture for that
[2:04:11] i have a word of thus saith the lord of
[2:04:13] a prophet for that
[2:04:15] but you see that won't work for a babe
[2:04:18] a baby's got to be able to say well uh i
[2:04:21] i don't know uh uh why do you believe
[2:04:23] what you believe
[2:04:24] you're foolish you're you're fanatic now
[2:04:26] you well
[2:04:29] it's written i i got no defense i'm not
[2:04:33] smart enough
[2:04:34] i don't have the intellect but but it
[2:04:36] it's written
[2:04:39] you don't have to be some intellectual
[2:04:40] giant to take that some
[2:04:42] boastful person hey don't you know who i
[2:04:45] am no no
[2:04:46] it looks look devil it's written
[2:04:52] hallelujah and you see later as a mature
[2:04:56] christian we can come to the place that
[2:04:57] we can stand on
[2:04:58] our feet as it were and say no
[2:05:00] hallelujah i've experienced i've been
[2:05:02] behind the veil
[2:05:04] amen i have adele i've met him face to
[2:05:06] face
[2:05:07] i've been filled with the holy ghost
[2:05:09] amen the word has been made real it's
[2:05:11] being manifested in me
[2:05:12] satan you're mistaken you can howl all
[2:05:15] you want
[2:05:16] but i'm not who you say i am i
[2:05:19] am who he says i am
[2:05:24] so that's why god made the word
[2:05:27] the gold standard you know what
[2:05:30] because you see the word being the gold
[2:05:33] standard usable by
[2:05:34] every christian in every age
[2:05:38] you didn't have to come back and
[2:05:39] re-establish a gold standard again
[2:05:41] and again and again he said take it back
[2:05:43] to the word take it back to the word and
[2:05:45] people will say but we have the message
[2:05:47] of the hour
[2:05:48] the prophet of god didn't say take it
[2:05:50] back to my message he told us take it
[2:05:52] back
[2:05:53] to the word there's the gold standard
[2:05:57] right there
[2:05:57] take it back to the word take it back to
[2:06:00] the bible
[2:06:05] come on saints
[2:06:09] then it's usable at every stage no
[2:06:10] matter where we are in our christian
[2:06:12] walk oh hallelujah
[2:06:15] i've got so much stuff and some of this
[2:06:18] is so good sister emmy will you come
[2:06:23] hallelujah oh my
[2:06:27] you see the other three quarters of this
[2:06:29] sermon is quite long
[2:06:31] amen oh praise the lord you love the
[2:06:35] lord today saints
[2:06:37] now look i want to say this i'm not
[2:06:38] feeling condemned i'm not feeling bad
[2:06:40] but i want to tell you
[2:06:41] i'm not trying to condemn or push down
[2:06:43] on any individual
[2:06:44] but i'll tell you what i don't like i
[2:06:47] don't like the spirits
[2:06:48] that come in our pasture and try to
[2:06:51] corner the saints
[2:06:53] and tell them that they are meat
[2:06:56] for the devil no i won't stand still
[2:07:01] i'll tell you what i'll do just like
[2:07:03] that man said once a long time ago
[2:07:06] you know about getting the holy ghost
[2:07:07] and i'll tell you what i'll do i'll
[2:07:08] chase that devil around the pasture
[2:07:10] and when i catch him if i ain't got no
[2:07:12] teeth i might be old i'll gum him to
[2:07:14] death
[2:07:14] [Music]
[2:07:15] because we're not going to put up with
[2:07:16] that no spirit's going to come in just
[2:07:19] have free reign because we don't want to
[2:07:20] offend nobody
[2:07:22] saints the word the word will rightly
[2:07:25] divide it
[2:07:26] and you can say well that's offensive
[2:07:28] but my brother and sister if
[2:07:29] it's man then it can be offensive amen
[2:07:33] if it's god it's a two-edged sword and
[2:07:36] you better listen to it
[2:07:38] hallelujah sheep
[2:07:41] let's pray for the security lift one
[2:07:43] another you see a hole in the fence
[2:07:45] don't pass it by and say that's the
[2:07:47] ministry's job you stop you fix that
[2:07:49] hole in that fence
[2:07:51] you start praying for that need you
[2:07:52] start praying for god to do something
[2:07:55] amen because we're not going to get
[2:07:56] there and say my where all the sheep go
[2:07:59] and look back and all you see is
[2:08:00] glistening bones in the sunlight
[2:08:03] and then say oh that's too bad
[2:08:07] no sir you want the spirit of unity
[2:08:11] unite around this word
[2:08:14] here's where the life is here's where
[2:08:16] the security is
[2:08:17] here's where the strength is oh
[2:08:20] hallelujah
[2:08:22] hallelujah oh my
[2:08:25] oh my brother's listening a song or two
[2:08:28] brother jason would you come
[2:08:30] i just want to sing a song just these
[2:08:32] you know sometimes saints
[2:08:34] i don't have no deal just like maybe
[2:08:36] when i'm studying a song comes to me and
[2:08:38] i find myself humming it or singing my
[2:08:41] tractor version of the words and
[2:08:43] and you know i oftentimes just put those
[2:08:45] down and
[2:08:46] be something i feel led to to just sing
[2:08:50] i believe saints no matter what our
[2:08:51] condition is today
[2:08:53] the fountain's still open amen
[2:08:56] and it's not just any old fountain it's
[2:08:58] a fountain in the house of david
[2:09:00] amen and that fountain oh praise the
[2:09:02] lord it's so deep
[2:09:04] that you can jump in and it will
[2:09:06] completely cover your life
[2:09:09] and it's so shallow our babies
[2:09:12] can climb in and walk through it and
[2:09:15] receive the blessings of it oh
[2:09:18] isn't that incredible but you've got to
[2:09:20] get
[2:09:21] in the fountain hallelujah
[2:09:24] reminds me we were kids long time ago we
[2:09:27] were out on the lake
[2:09:29] a friend of ours had a motorboat we're
[2:09:31] out on the lake water skiing and i'm too
[2:09:33] blind i never i never have enjoyed water
[2:09:35] skiing because you see i couldn't even
[2:09:36] see the back of the boat
[2:09:38] it's like where'd the boat go i have a
[2:09:40] rope in my hand but oh
[2:09:41] there it is this young man said hey
[2:09:46] hey guys guys is it possible to water
[2:09:49] ski without getting in the water
[2:09:51] [Music]
[2:09:56] it's probably possible and then lo and
[2:09:59] behold time goes on they invent things
[2:10:00] like youtube and you see the guy on the
[2:10:02] dock and
[2:10:03] the boat does its little thing and you
[2:10:05] know all the rest of them and the boat
[2:10:06] goes straight away these guys get their
[2:10:08] arms ripped off right
[2:10:09] but something about that when the boat
[2:10:10] curves away so that the rope is pulling
[2:10:13] through the water
[2:10:14] [Music]
[2:10:15] are you with me
[2:10:19] it doesn't jerk their arms off but they
[2:10:21] just slide right off of the dock and
[2:10:23] they're on their ski and
[2:10:24] they're going then you can watch that
[2:10:27] same man
[2:10:28] ride his water ski in right down the
[2:10:30] side of the dock and
[2:10:32] right when it goes to settle he sits
[2:10:35] down on the dock
[2:10:37] and everybody's like that's incredible
[2:10:40] but that's not us
[2:10:44] we can't have a spiritual relationship
[2:10:46] without getting wet
[2:10:49] amen that's that's for somebody that's
[2:10:51] for
[2:10:52] that's for the mega church man
[2:10:53] [Music]
[2:10:55] the rest of us gonna get in the water
[2:10:58] and you know what we might as well just
[2:11:00] [Music]
[2:11:01] lay down
[2:11:02] let it cover us frolick in it
[2:11:08] amen that reminds me do you know right
[2:11:10] there on the ohio river where brother
[2:11:11] branham
[2:11:13] was baptized and when the spirit of the
[2:11:14] lord come down did you know that just a
[2:11:17] little farther out
[2:11:18] in the river right there it's a very
[2:11:21] area that brother brown was baptizing
[2:11:22] him
[2:11:24] and he's baptizing these folks and and
[2:11:26] it's all good the angel of the lord
[2:11:28] comes down god speaks to him lovely time
[2:11:30] a lot of people
[2:11:31] like to be baptized there there's
[2:11:32] something special now when i talked
[2:11:34] earlier about that i'm not saying my
[2:11:36] brother and sister is not something
[2:11:37] special about these places there's
[2:11:38] something special
[2:11:39] angel of the lord come down god almighty
[2:11:42] himself come down
[2:11:43] you can't tell me that's not sacred
[2:11:45] ground

[2:12:30] they're splashing and sputtering
[2:12:32] and got up there he said you know what
[2:12:34] brother

[2:12:41] than i baptized the rest of them
[2:12:44] because we made it all the way to the
[2:12:46] bottom
