[35:39] we're thankful for this god bless you
[35:41] tonight if you have your Bibles wherever

[35:46] the scriptures in 1st Corinthians
[35:49] chapter 10 we'll begin and a little
[35:52] service a little bit unusual here and
[35:54] we'll just go into this and feeling that
[35:59] this is the day we're in a day of
[36:01] certain uncertainty to the world
[36:04] uncertainty to the politics everything
[36:06] is uncertain but we have a certain we
[36:09] have a certainty and that certainty is
[36:11] the Word of God it's a certainty that we
[36:16] have it's a certainty that is unmovable
[36:19] it's unmovable we have a faith that's
[36:21] been given to us we're so thankful that
[36:23] we can say that I have I can say this
[36:26] tonight that I have the confirmation of
[36:28] his own life in me identifying and trust
[36:31] you can say the same thing that we have
[36:33] the identification living in us the
[36:35] confirmation of his word to identify his
[36:37] faith and we have the faith it'll
[36:39] conquer every enemy and besides that we
[36:41] say tonight who is coronavirus it's the
[36:45] enemy it's the
[36:46] and it's the spirit trying to work and
[36:49] but we're thankful that God conquered
[36:52] him at Calvary for us amen
[36:54] so I'd like you to turn if you would in
[36:57] 1st Corinthians chapter 10 and we'll
[37:01] read here starting with with well I'll
[37:06] just skip around here a little bit but
[37:07] let's start with the fifth verse let's
[37:11] start with the fourth verse and this is
[37:14] when the the children of Israel on their
[37:15] journey in the wilderness and they did
[37:18] all and did all drink the same spiritual
[37:20] drink for they drank of that spiritual
[37:23] rock and verse three said they all ate
[37:25] the same spiritual meat so it it puts us
[37:28] all as the believers of the message of
[37:29] the hour we're here and we have been on
[37:32] this spiritual journey and where did
[37:34] we're eating the same spiritual meat we
[37:36] drink the same spiritual drink for they
[37:39] drank of that spiritual rock that
[37:40] followed them and that rock was Christ
[37:42] but with many of them God was not well
[37:45] pleased for they were overthrown in the
[37:49] wilderness many of them not all of them
[37:51] but many of them God was not pleased
[37:53] because they were overthrown in the
[37:56] wilderness now that didn't mean God
[37:57] wasn't with them God was with them but
[38:00] they needed to do it well they needed to
[38:02] be dependent on that God to lead them
[38:04] and they got sidetracked and we want to
[38:07] be careful in this day that we're not
[38:08] sidetracked because right here at the
[38:10] last at the very end day that we have
[38:12] brother branham in the message that he
[38:14] was preaching where he saw the preview
[38:16] of the bride he said of the few not at
[38:18] the beginning but in the end toward the
[38:19] end they got a little sidetracked they
[38:21] began to they began to look at things
[38:24] that were happening around him began to
[38:25] see the church that was falling away and
[38:28] we read I hear for many of them God was
[38:30] not pleased for they were overthrown in
[38:32] the wilderness now God was seeing the
[38:33] bride but they got separated they got
[38:36] sidetracked and by doing that but he saw
[38:39] them getting back in line so God is
[38:41] allowing these things we know these
[38:43] allowing these things to happen for a
[38:45] purpose and we don't want to get
[38:46] sidetracked we don't want to be
[38:48] sidetracked on the politics we don't be
[38:50] sidetracked and what this one's doing in
[38:52] politics and all these things but we
[38:54] want to keep focused
[38:56] I appreciate our pastor preaching that
[38:57] message of keeping focused
[38:59] and preaching the messages on
[39:02] distraction but we must stay focused
[39:04] because the word said we look not at the
[39:06] things which are seen that's in 2nd
[39:08] Corinthians 4:18 we don't look at the
[39:11] things that are seen but the things that
[39:12] are not seen for the things which are
[39:14] seen are temporal and that look there is
[39:17] focus and we look not or don't focus at
[39:20] the temporal things but we're looking or
[39:21] focusing on the unseen things the unseen
[39:24] things are the eternal things and that's
[39:26] where God is is I believe that trying us
[39:29] and he's testing us he's getting us to
[39:31] see if we're focused he's gonna see if
[39:33] we're we're gonna follow him he's gonna
[39:35] see that no matter you're gonna watch us
[39:37] we're being tested
[39:38] we're being tried and I believe we're
[39:40] being tested I believe love is being
[39:42] tested I believe our love for him is
[39:44] being tested and I believe it's a time
[39:46] of tests and God doesn't do things with
[39:49] just to be doing them he's allowed these
[39:51] things to come on the bride but all
[39:52] things work together for good to them
[39:55] that love God we got to remember that
[39:57] that no matter what happens we can look
[39:58] at this in a different attitude than
[40:00] most can look at it but we see these
[40:02] things happening to us and God's not an
[40:05] author of confusion God's not an author
[40:07] of he doesn't do things to to just be
[40:11] doing them and the word I want to use is
[40:14] he doesn't he's not he's not doing it to
[40:16] be an author of frustration he's not
[40:18] trying to frustrate us he's got a
[40:20] purpose in it just like he had a purpose
[40:22] in law job to go through what he went
[40:23] through and everything has a purpose so
[40:26] if we just turn our focus and it's not a
[40:28] time to lose to lose to not press in
[40:32] it's not a time to get sidetracked I
[40:34] said but to press more than ever press
[40:36] and press in press into the word press
[40:39] into prayer press into the to the
[40:41] messages of the hour and continue to
[40:43] feed and continue to eat upon the open
[40:45] book and we just and and we just want to
[40:49] do that it's not a time to just relax
[40:51] and let go and I've got something here
[40:54] we want to haven't given a title yet but
[40:55] we'll see in just a minute what I'm
[40:57] saying it's not a time to get focused
[40:59] other places but focus on the eternal
[41:01] God and they that are born again and the
[41:04] little bride to focus on Christ that's
[41:06] in them Christ that's in you amen
[41:08] because there's your strength
[41:10] there's your refuge it isn't lay out
[41:12] here doesn't lay in polity
[41:13] suddenly everywhere else it lays in the
[41:16] revealed word it lays in Christ in you
[41:18] and so as we continue to read here with
[41:20] many of them God was not pleased for
[41:22] they were overthrown the wilderness now
[41:24] these things were our examples that to
[41:27] the intent we should not lust after evil
[41:29] things as they also lusted verse seven
[41:31] neither be ye idolaters as were some of
[41:34] them as it is written the people sat
[41:36] down to eat and drink and rose up to
[41:39] play my text this morning is this and I
[41:43] haven't reached it in the scripture but
[41:44] I'll give it to you my title is this
[41:47] flee idolatry flee idolatry and it's I
[41:52] want to I want to bring light as a Holy
[41:54] Spirit as has put this on my heart for
[41:56] about about a month now I'm bringing
[41:59] this light to this and caught it in the
[42:02] word to uncover that spirit of idolatry
[42:05] which is fear the whole motive of all
[42:08] that Satan tries to do is bring fear and
[42:11] he's doing that to try to get you to
[42:13] focus on other things than the word to
[42:16] draw your attention to other things and
[42:18] give over and bow down or worship or
[42:20] give over to something else that you can
[42:24] that will become an idol because it will
[42:26] come to this definition a minute but
[42:28] anything that stands between you and God
[42:30] is an idol and so I'm not calling people
[42:34] idolaters I'm not calling you idolaters
[42:36] and but we've all come to this place we
[42:38] all make those mistakes but I believe
[42:40] God wants to uncover that spirit of
[42:43] idolatry and it's very prevalent and
[42:45] we'll see here as we continue to read
[42:47] neither be dollar ters as some of them
[42:49] is written the people sat down to eat
[42:51] drink and rose up to play they got they
[42:53] got Aaron to make them a calf of gold
[42:57] he took the jewelry and everything he
[42:58] says and make him a calf and and and God
[43:01] him said we don't know what happened to
[43:02] this this Moses because we put our trust
[43:05] in him he was our leader instead of
[43:07] putting their trust in the one that was
[43:08] leading Moses and speaking through him
[43:10] they begin to put their trust upon upon
[43:13] the man instead and the man become their
[43:17] idol man became their leader now we
[43:19] don't know what's happened to Moses so
[43:20] here Aaron you make us a god we can
[43:23] worship and we can bow down to and it'll
[43:24] lead us back into
[43:26] Egypt and so they were idolaters because
[43:29] they put something ahead of God the word
[43:31] which God had already proven himself to
[43:34] them over and over again that he was
[43:36] with them he was leading them they had
[43:38] the pillar fire before them and so they
[43:41] were and neither could let us commit
[43:42] fornication as some of them committed
[43:44] and fell in one day three and twenty
[43:46] thousand the stop to verse 10 neither
[43:50] murmur ye as some of them also murmured
[43:52] and were destroyed of the destroyer now
[43:55] all these things happened unto them for
[43:56] examples and they and to unto them for
[43:59] examples and they are written for our
[44:02] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[44:04] world come wherefore let him that
[44:06] thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
[44:08] fall there hath no temptation or trial
[44:11] or tests taken you but such as common to
[44:14] man but God is faithful aren't you glad
[44:16] for that God is faithful who will not
[44:19] suffer you to be tempted above what you
[44:21] are able but with the but with the temp
[44:24] table with the temptation also make a
[44:27] way of escape that you may be able to
[44:29] bear it
[44:30] wherefore my dearly beloved flee from
[44:33] idolatry and so Paul is saying here he
[44:37] said beacon very very clear he said my
[44:39] dearly beloved he's not speaking to
[44:41] unbelievers he's speaking to his dearly
[44:43] beloved he's speaking to the bride he's
[44:45] speaking to those that he loved with all
[44:46] of his heart he's speaking to those
[44:48] believers too said flee from idolatry
[44:50] take the example don't let nothing come
[44:54] between you and God Amen I'd like to go
[44:56] to a scripture real quick and and in
[44:58] first John chapter 5 just reading here
[45:02] starting with verse 20 and 21 and we
[45:05] know that the Son of God has come and
[45:08] have given us a revelation or
[45:09] understanding to discern that we may
[45:12] know him that is true and we are in him
[45:15] that is true even in His Son Jesus
[45:18] Christ this is the true God and eternal
[45:21] life verse 21 little children keep
[45:24] yourselves from idols
[45:26] amen amen
[45:29] in in in the message here
[45:37] of I just had to follow my note here
[45:44] just a moment and and yeah in the
[45:47] message be certain of God our prophet
[45:51] says this he said yes sir
[45:53] our nation is it all its greatly covered
[45:56] over with idolatry
[45:58] we might not worship wooden animals and
[46:00] so forth as we want to think of idolatry
[46:02] remember in the Old Testament they made
[46:05] animals they made they made high places
[46:07] they made images they they had images
[46:09] they made out of their own thinking out
[46:11] of their own mind they reasoned it to be
[46:13] this or that they worship those images
[46:15] they had an altar they would make
[46:16] sacrifice to that and and every King
[46:20] that came on the scene that believed God
[46:22] followed God destroyed those images
[46:25] destroyed those high places was blessed
[46:27] by God in his kingdom prospered and
[46:29] those that came along and did not follow
[46:32] the Lord did not give him preeminence
[46:34] and allowed that idolatry their kingdom
[46:37] suffered and was destroyed many cases
[46:39] and so and so we see that that was in
[46:42] the natural what is it in the spiritual
[46:45] we can see that anything and brother
[46:47] Branham goes on to say he says we might
[46:49] not worship wooden animals and so forth
[46:52] as we want to think of idolatry but
[46:54] that's not all idolatry consists of we
[46:58] sometimes make our automobiles our
[47:00] clothes and things that we'd put on or
[47:04] we put as and sand and the things that
[47:07] and the things that we put as idols
[47:09] anything between you and God is an idol
[47:14] sometimes we make our churches idols we
[47:17] should never do that God is the only one
[47:19] we should worship Amen or we should
[47:24] serve or we should bow to Amen it
[47:27] shouldn't be something else and we're
[47:29] gonna get into a few of those things but
[47:30] but there's many many things too
[47:32] numerous to mention here tonight but
[47:34] what could be your idol that you can
[47:37] make an idol but I believe the Holy
[47:40] Spirit in us will identify that and give
[47:43] us a choice when those things are
[47:45] presented because Satan in order to do
[47:48] that is going to use the tactic of fear
[47:50] to
[47:51] make you either to bring a fear over
[47:53] feelings senses and on and on we could
[47:57] say if you allow that to become a head
[48:00] over the Word of God or add to the word
[48:03] or take something and place it in front
[48:05] of that then that becomes an idol
[48:07] you've now now you're now your absolute
[48:10] has changed to that Idol Amen so so we
[48:15] must realize that our absolute anything
[48:19] our listen I'll just say it this way
[48:21] your absolute is going to be your God
[48:25] your absolute is your God
[48:28] so if your God's the word your absolutes
[48:30] the word Amen and I'm glad we have an
[48:33] advocate that's paid the price sent the
[48:35] life it to us and gave us the life
[48:37] inside of us to keep us because we would
[48:40] all be idolaters amen and I'm not even
[48:46] men itself I'm a many the word and I
[48:49] trust you can say Amen out there so so
[48:52] we we realize that that is where we are
[48:55] that God's the only one of worship and
[48:59] then also we we realize here that that
[49:04] that's what it is your absolute it
[49:08] should be the word
[49:10] now you're gonna fear now anything
[49:13] brother Graham says anything that stands
[49:15] between you and God is an idol so I just
[49:20] make it clear we could go over and over
[49:22] what he said about that but anything
[49:23] that stands between you and God if you
[49:27] and God or you and the word because God
[49:29] is the word is an idol it takes it takes
[49:32] a place of God why call you me Lord and
[49:35] then and means ownership and then not do
[49:37] what I say why call me Lord and then not
[49:40] do as I command
[49:42] so if he's your Lord then he's your
[49:44] absolute he's the final word he's the
[49:46] absolute he's the final say he's in
[49:48] every situation in every case in every
[49:51] sense in the past and and in the end
[49:54] complexes everything we we can you can
[49:56] give place to all of those things and we
[49:58] all have but as we grow up God's
[50:02] uncovering and more in a battle we
[50:04] realize
[50:04] in a battle we realize we're not on a
[50:06] picnic every day we are making choices
[50:08] every day we're facing this this this
[50:12] this thought of well do I make this what
[50:15] do I give in to this no you have one
[50:16] thing that your absolute you don't have
[50:19] to add to it or take from it is that
[50:21] flawless Word of God and the faith of
[50:23] God will anchor in the Word of God the
[50:27] Word of God is unmovable the Word of God
[50:29] doesn't need our opinion because your
[50:31] opinion can be your Idol but God doesn't
[50:34] need your opinion we want to put God
[50:38] many times in a box and think he's got
[50:39] to do this he's got to do that no God is
[50:42] gonna do just what he wants to do he's
[50:44] sovereign but he has a purpose in it all
[50:46] just like he did with Joe be at a
[50:48] purpose and Jobe didn't come around and
[50:50] make that and make what was happening
[50:52] around him say well if that's the way
[50:53] God's gonna do I'll just turn away from
[50:55] him and then create that and his own
[50:57] thinking and his own judgment says I'll
[50:59] he said no God giveth and he taketh away
[51:01] blessed be the name of the Lord amen he
[51:05] didn't bow to that even not even his
[51:07] wife his wife no matter and as much as
[51:09] as his wife meant to job job did not bow
[51:13] to his wife when it said you you look
[51:14] like a wretch job you look miserable why
[51:17] don't you just curse God and dive in and
[51:19] die the death he said you speak like a
[51:21] foolish woman
[51:22] hey man I'm not gonna bow to that spirit
[51:25] I'm not giving in to that I'm not going
[51:28] to give in to that fear I mean a job was
[51:31] to look at how he felt that job was to
[51:33] consider what was around him if job was
[51:35] gonna consider what was given to him
[51:37] which wasn't true and and his and his
[51:39] and those that were trying to help him
[51:41] of his own church if he looked at that
[51:43] and gave place to that he would have
[51:44] given place to an idol but he knew God
[51:46] existed he knew he was real and he
[51:49] believed him and that's a real believer
[51:52] Amen that'll take God at His Word and
[51:54] stand there so anything that we put
[51:56] ahead of God is an idol amen
[52:02] and so we don't want to do that we want
[52:04] to be sure that nothing stands in our
[52:07] way
[52:08] amen now
[52:15] I'll tell you what if you and will just
[52:17] get into this scripture other scripture
[52:18] in just a moment but here the message of
[52:21] grace and the message of grace he
[52:23] preached here he says the grace of God
[52:26] reached over in Noah's time Noah just an
[52:28] ordinary man he and his family but
[52:30] because Noah feared God now this is a
[52:32] different kind of fear no irreverence
[52:34] Noah reverence and respected and held
[52:36] God and esteem as being absolute so Noah
[52:40] feared God Noah feared God and that's
[52:43] not the fear we're speaking of but it is
[52:45] but in this case Noah feared God now
[52:48] listen to what he says he believed
[52:49] because he feared God he believed God
[52:53] watch what he says now you can't fear
[52:56] God without believing him hey men you
[53:01] can't fear God because how can you fear
[53:03] something you don't believe so how can
[53:07] you fear something you don't believe so
[53:10] if you're gonna fear it it shows you
[53:12] believe it now I want you to turn with
[53:16] me to the to a said for a second Timothy
[53:19] a moment if you'll turn to be the second
[53:23] Timothy and your Bibles 2nd Timothy
[53:26] chapter 1 and we'll read verse 7 they're
[53:34] familiar scriptures for God we're
[53:37] speaking now God God is the spirit God
[53:39] is life God is the word God doesn't
[53:41] change for God hath not in OT not given
[53:46] us the spirit of fear God has not given
[53:49] us the spirit of fear but of power what
[53:53] has he given us he's given us power
[53:55] whose power his own power his own
[53:58] authority he's given us that authority
[54:00] through what himself through his Spirit
[54:03] through his word but he's given us power
[54:05] and of love and of a sound mind he has
[54:09] not given us the spirit notice the
[54:12] spirit of fear so this fear we're
[54:14] talking about is of the devil and it's
[54:16] the spirit and it's his spirit and
[54:18] everything I don't care what is
[54:21] presented to you and try to get you and
[54:24] try to sway you over to believing that
[54:26] instead of the word it's a spirit
[54:29] Amen it's a spirit and it's the spirit
[54:32] of fear because because you're going to
[54:35] believe what you fear and if you fear it
[54:38] it's just like just like the Prophet
[54:40] talking about the woman that was frying
[54:41] bacon and the snapped over and God in
[54:43] her hand but she didn't fear it and if
[54:45] she didn't fear it it can't hurt her job
[54:48] feared something would take place and
[54:50] things came upon him but God knew what
[54:52] was in his heart and God allowed that to
[54:55] take place for a purpose see but how
[55:00] many taught us how many of us have found
[55:02] out the same thing something happens we
[55:05] fear it and guess what
[55:07] things begin to transpire because we put
[55:09] that allow that to rule over the word so
[55:13] we're not so what we do not want to do
[55:15] is let fear govern we don't want to let
[55:18] this devil of fear or the spirit of fear
[55:22] govern or control our battleground we
[55:27] don't want to let it control our spirit
[55:29] realm amen
[55:30] that little that man that you are on the
[55:32] inside is spirit inside of that's a soul
[55:34] we understand the Scriptures so we want
[55:40] to look at here is this he said you'll
[55:48] never you'll never you'll never look at
[55:50] one of them until you first have to let
[55:52] God or let Satan in there you have to
[55:55] let him in now before we read that
[55:58] before we read that I would like you to
[56:00] turn with me to 2nd Corinthians 10:5 if
[56:03] you on the line online have your Bibles
[56:05] I hope you do following along in 2nd
[56:08] Corinthians 10 and verse 5 very familiar
[56:13] scriptural to start with verse 3 for we
[56:17] walk for though we walk in the flesh we
[56:20] do not war after the flesh for the
[56:26] weapons of our warfare are not carnal
[56:28] are not carnal but mighty through God to
[56:32] the pulling down of strongholds a watch
[56:35] casting down imaginations something
[56:39] that's presented to you that you imagine
[56:41] something looks reason
[56:42] or something that Satan presents to your
[56:45] mind something it's not courting to the
[56:48] word brother-sister imagination
[56:50] reasoning memory conscience those are
[56:52] fine as long as they agree with the word
[56:54] but if they don't agree with the word we
[56:57] are to cast them down so we cast down
[56:59] anything imagination an imagination an
[57:03] image now Satan is going to try to
[57:04] present you an image I mean I mean we
[57:07] know that's true I mean you can agree
[57:10] with me that Satan on the battleground
[57:12] will present an image that will that
[57:15] will bring fear over the word amen he's
[57:22] trying to do that for a purpose and
[57:24] we'll get into that just a moment
[57:26] so he's casting down imaginations and
[57:29] every high thing that exalteth itself
[57:33] against the knowledge of God that's the
[57:37] Word of God and bringing into can that's
[57:40] the mind of God also the mind of God is
[57:42] the word against the knowledge of God
[57:45] and bringing into captivity bringing
[57:47] into captivity every thought to the
[57:51] obedience of the anointed word Christ so
[57:57] we must be ready we must be we must be
[58:00] vigilant over these things daily every
[58:04] day and so we and watch how he does this
[58:12] he says now you'll never you'll never
[58:15] look brother Brown I'm saying you'll
[58:16] never look at one of them until you
[58:18] first have to let Satan in here what's
[58:22] he saying in that thought in the mind in
[58:26] the battleground you have to let him in
[58:28] then when he gets in he's got control
[58:31] then what does he do what does he do
[58:34] what does this spirit of fear do he
[58:36] begins to use the conscience he begins
[58:38] to use this begins to use this outlet
[58:41] what is it see taste feel smell hear
[58:46] imagination conscience memory reason
[58:48] affections he begins to use all those
[58:51] different little channels and as long as
[58:54] he can get in
[58:55] above this one here what's the brother
[58:57] I'm saying as he's got to first get in
[58:59] above the word in the control room of
[59:03] your soul if you're born again the word
[59:05] is in there but you're going to have to
[59:08] take the word will the word you're going
[59:10] to take that word and you're gonna put
[59:13] it on the battlefield and he's got to
[59:15] come above that one first he's got to
[59:17] come above that one see we're realizing
[59:19] now who we are and the authority we have
[59:21] he's got to come above that in other
[59:23] words he's got to bind the strongman of
[59:25] the house before he can rule the house
[59:28] he's got to bind the strongman who's the
[59:32] strongman of your house it's the word
[59:35] the strongman of you of your house is
[59:37] the word Amen if he's in you living he's
[59:40] the word and he's he's wanting you to
[59:42] come and that's why I believe things are
[59:44] happening because God wants us to depend
[59:47] upon him he wants us to depend not
[59:50] become independent but to depend upon
[59:52] him and he's going to see what we're
[59:55] gonna do in these things when we have to
[59:56] stay home and when we can't go here and
[59:58] we can't travel maybe as much as we did
[1:00:01] or can't go into jobs and this and that
[1:00:03] what are you going to come back to what
[1:00:05] are you gonna do are we going to get
[1:00:06] lakhs are we gonna press it harder are
[1:00:08] we going to become lakhs are we gonna
[1:00:09] just give in to these things
[1:00:11] no we're not going to give in we're
[1:00:13] going to press in God's wanting to see
[1:00:16] if you're really going to trust him he's
[1:00:18] gonna see if you really got trust and
[1:00:20] can give yourself over completely to his
[1:00:23] trust and trust him with your body trust
[1:00:26] him with your feeling trust him with
[1:00:28] your finances trust him with your home
[1:00:30] trust him with all these things can we
[1:00:32] trust him can we put the word first are
[1:00:35] we going to allow him to come above this
[1:00:37] word over here and and listen to our
[1:00:40] conscience listen to what we see taste
[1:00:42] feel smell hear allow them to become the
[1:00:44] idols in our life are we going to give
[1:00:46] way to seeing are we gonna give way to
[1:00:48] feeling are we gonna give way are we
[1:00:50] gonna give way to the word What did he
[1:00:52] say what did he promise that's our
[1:00:56] absolute that should be our absolute not
[1:00:58] let him in above the word but he's got
[1:01:00] to come above there in order to take
[1:01:02] over your mind to come in your mind
[1:01:04] first he has to come above the word and
[1:01:07] then you have to
[1:01:09] so you've got a decision to make you've
[1:01:12] got a choice to make and we realize by
[1:01:14] realizing who we are we're recognizing
[1:01:15] our authority and what we say in the
[1:01:18] decisions we make and what we confess
[1:01:20] God is a high priest of that confession
[1:01:23] and will stand behind that confession
[1:01:25] hallelujah and there and we'll waiting
[1:01:28] and many things and we'll get into in a
[1:01:30] minute here he's waiting on us to make
[1:01:32] that decision and every day we're
[1:01:34] looking we're making those decisions
[1:01:36] because we must deny yourself daily
[1:01:39] Jesus said if you're gonna follow me
[1:01:41] you've got to know yourself you can
[1:01:43] allow yourself to be your idol your own
[1:01:45] self is your Idol you can make your own
[1:01:47] self your own thinking your own feelings
[1:01:49] your Idol but that's not our Idol that's
[1:01:54] not our absolute amen we're not bowing
[1:01:57] to that we won't worship that we will
[1:01:59] refuse to serve that we're gonna serve
[1:02:01] the word all right so so he's got to
[1:02:06] come above it he's got to come in your
[1:02:08] mind first and you have to accept it
[1:02:10] listen it can batter against you but it
[1:02:13] can't get to you until you accept it you
[1:02:18] can't it can batter against you and you
[1:02:20] and we all have weaknesses we all have
[1:02:22] something in our life that that's an
[1:02:24] open and it can be an open door that
[1:02:27] unless you keep it covered by the word
[1:02:28] Satan is going to try to use that
[1:02:30] against you
[1:02:31] we all have every one of us got that
[1:02:33] little place and you're gonna try to use
[1:02:35] that against you to work against you and
[1:02:37] that's the part you've got to keep
[1:02:38] covered by the word because you've got
[1:02:41] to recognize he can't just come sliding
[1:02:43] in you've got to let him and when God
[1:02:46] identifies that and you see that's the
[1:02:48] devil then don't let him hold to the
[1:02:52] word don't accept fear because Satan to
[1:02:54] trying to get you to fear your
[1:02:56] conscience fear your senses fear your
[1:02:58] imagination fear your memory fear your
[1:03:01] reasoning fear these fear of the past
[1:03:02] something happened in the past Satan
[1:03:04] brings it up he knows there's a weakness
[1:03:06] there you don't fear that past you don't
[1:03:08] fear the complexes you don't fear what
[1:03:10] other people say or do man it's not your
[1:03:13] absolute the word is your absolute Amen
[1:03:17] so what we must not do we must not lay
[1:03:21] down our soul
[1:03:23] Satan is trying to anoint you he's
[1:03:26] trying to get you to bow he's trying to
[1:03:28] what he's trying to do let me just say
[1:03:35] it like this he's trying to get you to
[1:03:36] lay your sword down don't let Satan try
[1:03:39] to anoint you with fear that your sword
[1:03:42] or your weapon is not strong enough to
[1:03:44] withstand him or to destroy him or or
[1:03:46] other words to defeat him or put him
[1:03:50] down don't let the devil tell you don't
[1:03:52] let him get you to fear something in
[1:03:54] order what's he trying to do anoint you
[1:03:57] what's he trying to anoint us with that
[1:03:58] for what do we battle with this every
[1:04:00] day our enemy is our own carnal mind our
[1:04:03] enemy is laying right there and Satan
[1:04:04] knows how to to use these senses and
[1:04:07] brother Branham said don't you give in
[1:04:09] to what Satan and how and anything he
[1:04:12] offers you through your senses he said
[1:04:14] that greatest battle ever fought don't
[1:04:16] you let him do it
[1:04:19] and you're gonna see we're gonna cover a
[1:04:21] lot of things about you letting you not
[1:04:23] letting you letting or not letting he
[1:04:25] said but you are to destroy your enemy
[1:04:28] the Prophet said before your enemy
[1:04:30] destroys you in other words you undo him
[1:04:32] first John 3:1 said the Son of God was
[1:04:35] manifest to destroy the works of the
[1:04:38] devil and so and so other words to undo
[1:04:41] it we don't have to yield to it we can
[1:04:43] destroy it and because Satan wants you
[1:04:46] to do under work under his anointing he
[1:04:50] can't create but he knows you can and
[1:04:52] he's wanting to inspire you to do that
[1:04:55] and create something that's not
[1:04:57] according to the word Amen so so we
[1:05:00] realize Satan's tactics as it becomes
[1:05:04] unveiled to us his Spirit has this this
[1:05:08] this spirit of idolatry is strong no
[1:05:11] wonder Paul said flee it no wonder he
[1:05:13] said little children John said little
[1:05:15] children fleeing he told the brother to
[1:05:17] flee it because it's more than just
[1:05:20] idols and wooden idols it comes into the
[1:05:22] spiritual working here on our mind and
[1:05:25] we must recognize that and not give in
[1:05:28] to it
[1:05:29] what are we going to do put the word
[1:05:30] there first okay we got a ways to go
[1:05:34] here so we just want to keep moving on
[1:05:36] now he said in order he said no man no
[1:05:43] woman can disbelieve the devil's lie
[1:05:45] until you they have disbelieved God's
[1:05:48] truth now let's just let's just eat on
[1:05:52] this a minute here he said he said he
[1:05:55] said no man no woman can believe the
[1:05:57] devil's lie until they have first
[1:05:59] disbelieved God's truth that's not
[1:06:02] saying you're disbeliever an unbeliever
[1:06:03] but there is that he's trying to anoint
[1:06:05] us with the spirit of unbelief and we're
[1:06:08] either gonna get many times he'll try to
[1:06:10] trip us up and we find where we did but
[1:06:13] thank God we have an advocate thank God
[1:06:14] we have the blood thank God we have a
[1:06:16] keeping power that we can come back to
[1:06:18] and and realign our self with the word
[1:06:20] and go right on because we must deny
[1:06:24] yourself daily no I just deny yourself
[1:06:27] take up our cross daily and follow him
[1:06:31] so because you have to disbelieve God's
[1:06:35] truth so you see you see even Adam where
[1:06:38] it places us this morning which places
[1:06:40] us under the same thing having a choice
[1:06:43] in order to disbelieve the devil's lie
[1:06:45] you have to ignore God's truth first the
[1:06:48] Prophet said before you can believe the
[1:06:50] devil's lie he said have you ever
[1:06:53] thought of that have you you have to
[1:06:55] deny the truth first before you can
[1:06:57] believe a lie right you have to deny it
[1:07:00] in other words you have to turn away
[1:07:02] from it you have to give in to one or
[1:07:04] the other
[1:07:05] amen but to the believer that tonight
[1:07:10] the believers the believers out here
[1:07:12] hearing your absolute is the word your
[1:07:16] absolute is not a history your absolute
[1:07:18] authsub your absolute is the I am that's
[1:07:20] present with us now it's in you now that
[1:07:24] will that believes the word the
[1:07:25] believers on the inside of your soul
[1:07:27] that's who the believer is that faith in
[1:07:29] you is the believer that word revealed
[1:07:32] as a believer amen so first Kings 18:21
[1:07:37] I won't go to there but yes I will first
[1:07:40] Kings 18:21 let me read what Eli just
[1:07:44] said one up there in Mount Carmel when
[1:07:46] he challenged those those idol
[1:07:49] worshipers
[1:07:50] verse 21 first Kings 18:21 and Elisha
[1:07:54] came unto the people and said how long
[1:07:56] halt ye between two opinions if the Lord
[1:08:00] be God if the Lord be God if he's your
[1:08:03] object of worship if he's your absolute
[1:08:06] serve him follow him but if Bale then
[1:08:10] follow him and the people answered him
[1:08:13] not a word Amen but here it is tonight
[1:08:17] why halt we between two opinions we're
[1:08:20] gonna go out here we're gonna face the
[1:08:22] devil well we're gonna go out here we've
[1:08:24] been eating the book and it's sweet in
[1:08:25] their mouth but we begin to digest it
[1:08:27] it's become bitter in our stomach it's
[1:08:29] become bitter we have to we have to face
[1:08:31] reproach we have to face persecution we
[1:08:34] have to face the reproach of the enemy
[1:08:36] because we're bearing his life in our
[1:08:38] flesh and it's not easy but we must but
[1:08:42] we have the Advocate we have the word we
[1:08:44] have the keeping power we can we can go
[1:08:46] back to the word refused to give the
[1:08:48] devil his place through fear amen amen
[1:08:54] so so John 14:27 said Paul Jesus said my
[1:09:00] peace I give unto you my peace I leave
[1:09:03] with you let not your heart be troubled
[1:09:05] let it not be afraid amen John 14:27
[1:09:11] Colossians 3 and we'll just go to that
[1:09:15] one now Colossians 3 Colossians chapter
[1:09:22] 3 and verse set a verse 15 starting and
[1:09:28] let here again we let there's a word let
[1:09:32] and let we must let the peace of God
[1:09:35] rule or other words umpire have the
[1:09:40] absolute say have the final word have
[1:09:42] the ultimate word we must let it rule in
[1:09:45] our hearts amen
[1:09:49] to the which also you are called in one
[1:09:53] body and be ye thankful let hear again
[1:09:57] let the word of Christ dwell in you
[1:09:59] richly in all wisdom
[1:10:03] teaching and admonishing one another in
[1:10:05] Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[1:10:08] singing with grace in your hearts to the
[1:10:11] Lord and whatsoever you do in word or
[1:10:14] deed do all in the name of the Lord
[1:10:17] Jesus giving thanks to God and the
[1:10:19] Father by him
[1:10:21] what's Satan presenting to us why is he
[1:10:23] wanting us to bow down to these things
[1:10:25] because he hates the manifestation of
[1:10:27] the word for the hour and that's why
[1:10:31] we're here that's why we're on this
[1:10:33] earth because we are the message living
[1:10:35] we're the message of the seventh angel
[1:10:37] we're the message sent forth living out
[1:10:40] in human flesh and Satan knows if he can
[1:10:43] get u-turned if he can get you away from
[1:10:45] from from that solid word and can come
[1:10:48] over above it and come down into that
[1:10:50] battlefield and you let him then he's
[1:10:53] gonna try to govern and what's he gonna
[1:10:54] do what's that what's that feel what's
[1:10:56] that battleground governed it's your
[1:10:58] it's your physical being it's what you
[1:11:01] do and think and say it's what you do
[1:11:03] and so because the spirit controls the
[1:11:05] body that's not that's not the Spirit
[1:11:07] Holy Spirit that's your spirit controls
[1:11:10] the body and Satan knows we get to
[1:11:12] control the body he can stop that word
[1:11:14] maybe for a season for a little bit from
[1:11:16] being manifested but you are on this
[1:11:19] earth for a purpose and that's to
[1:11:20] manifest God for this hour that's what
[1:11:24] you're called to that's what your
[1:11:25] position is here to do you're called
[1:11:27] here to manifest God for the season
[1:11:30] hallelujah for the hour and Satan's
[1:11:32] trying his best to get you sidetrack to
[1:11:35] get your focus off of the things that
[1:11:37] are eternal and which you are and who
[1:11:40] you are Jesus told us Jesus said I give
[1:11:43] you power Luke 10:19 he said I give you
[1:11:46] power over all the power of the enemy I
[1:11:50] give you authority I give you power
[1:11:53] and-and-and-and here God is saying to us
[1:11:56] I've not given you the spirit of fear
[1:11:58] but I've given you power I've given you
[1:12:01] love I've given you whose love I've
[1:12:04] given you my power I've given you my
[1:12:06] love and I've given you my mind I've
[1:12:10] given you a sound mind you can lean on
[1:12:12] that you can trust in that you can walk
[1:12:15] in that and
[1:12:15] I will honor it and I will back it up
[1:12:18] amen
[1:12:19] that's it we must recognize why we're
[1:12:22] here and why and God's allowing us to go
[1:12:25] through this time to glorify Him
[1:12:27] hallelujah nothing can come your way he
[1:12:30] said I will provide all of your needs we
[1:12:34] serve a living God we serve a
[1:12:36] resurrected Savior we serve we his he
[1:12:39] has risen he's here right now today just
[1:12:41] as as powerful and just the same as he
[1:12:44] ever was he hasn't changed his word is
[1:12:47] the same his power is the same his love
[1:12:49] is the same and his love can't fail if
[1:12:52] we just recognize people that his love
[1:12:55] can't fail and so what is love do it
[1:12:59] puts trust you can't have love you can't
[1:13:02] have God's love without having God's
[1:13:04] faith because they go hand in hand if
[1:13:06] you have the love of God you have the
[1:13:08] faith of God
[1:13:09] what's God wanting us to see us use it
[1:13:12] you're growing up now children you've
[1:13:14] grown up now I want to see you use the
[1:13:16] word the word my word of faith my word
[1:13:19] revealed in you my self my word is in
[1:13:22] your mouth you confess it and act upon
[1:13:25] it you confess the same thing I said let
[1:13:28] it be in your mouth let that word of
[1:13:29] faith of faith be in your mouth and I
[1:13:32] will perform it because that's not you
[1:13:34] that's my word and he has to honor that
[1:13:38] word just as certain is the honor to
[1:13:40] yesterday he has to honor it again
[1:13:42] because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:13:44] yesterday today and forever
[1:13:46] and this new birth on us and the whole
[1:13:48] person of who we are is Jesus Christ
[1:13:51] revealed hallelujah praise the Lord Amen
[1:13:56] I love the word here brother Branham
[1:13:58] says if you want deity in your midst
[1:14:00] then welcome and receive the word if you
[1:14:05] want deity how many I know and you
[1:14:07] people on the on the streaming here we
[1:14:09] could raise your hands with me as I want
[1:14:11] deity in my midst I want deity here I
[1:14:14] want to see God working I want to see
[1:14:16] God manifesting himself I want to see it
[1:14:18] more than I've ever had I need more of
[1:14:20] him and I'm coming to his word and I'm
[1:14:22] feeding on that open book that I might
[1:14:24] be that ministry that voice in this hour
[1:14:26] that God has appointed me to be that I
[1:14:29] we'll be and then I'm that I will go out
[1:14:31] and and and as the Bible said prophesy
[1:14:34] again because what the prophet
[1:14:37] prophesied under our messenger we become
[1:14:39] that voice we become the final voice to
[1:14:42] the to the people to the world God
[1:14:44] they're hearing from God again but Satan
[1:14:47] is trying to present through fear
[1:14:49] something that you take instead of the
[1:14:51] word he's going to use fear that's his
[1:14:53] major assault that's his major thing is
[1:14:56] fear if he can get you to fear it then
[1:15:00] he can get you on that side if he can
[1:15:02] just stop it for a little he's trying he
[1:15:04] knows he knows the word will stop him
[1:15:06] the word will not do it and what are we
[1:15:08] saying this for tonight for us to
[1:15:10] realize that spirit is very subtle that
[1:15:14] spirit trying to work that spirits
[1:15:16] trying to trying to work in our myths
[1:15:18] trying to work through the people he has
[1:15:21] no other channel Satan cannot just come
[1:15:23] in and do something without you allowing
[1:15:25] it he's got to he's got to present
[1:15:27] something he's got to present an image
[1:15:29] something in your mind you're either
[1:15:30] gonna let it ruse your they gonna let
[1:15:32] you are they gonna accept it or you're
[1:15:34] gonna reject it amen look at look at
[1:15:37] what he he says the Prophet says over
[1:15:39] here let me finish that quote if you
[1:15:42] want deity in your midst and welcome and
[1:15:44] receive the word don't ever let anyone
[1:15:47] or anything come get between you and
[1:15:51] that word now you can see you can see
[1:15:54] why Paul said he's made a way of escape
[1:15:56] you got your trials you've got your
[1:15:58] temptations you can see that but he and
[1:16:00] every one of those things he's not going
[1:16:02] to allow you to go more than what you
[1:16:03] can bear and with the temptation he's
[1:16:05] gonna make a way of escape and it's
[1:16:09] right there for us it's laying right
[1:16:10] there in the word we are called in
[1:16:12] command to wait on God expect on God not
[1:16:15] just try to step out ahead of him wait
[1:16:17] on him wait for him to quicken his word
[1:16:19] wait for him to show you that place of
[1:16:22] escape that you can escape it you have a
[1:16:24] way out of it hallelujah
[1:16:27] you've been given that way out amen
[1:16:30] watch what he said and greatest battle
[1:16:32] ever fought again he says see it's your
[1:16:34] mind that opens the door we realized
[1:16:37] that Roman in Romans 7 and verse 25
[1:16:41] Paul said I serve God by the inward
[1:16:43] man on 22nd verse 25th verse he said I
[1:16:47] serve the Lord Jesus Christ with my mind
[1:16:50] I'm just I'm not reading I'm just
[1:16:52] quoting it to you go back and pick it up
[1:16:54] but he said but with my mind whose mine
[1:16:58] Paul wasn't talking about his carnal
[1:17:01] mind when he said I serve God with my
[1:17:03] carnal mind because that's an enemy of
[1:17:05] God but he said I don't serve God that
[1:17:07] way I serve God with the mind he's given
[1:17:09] me with the Holy Spirit in me I serve
[1:17:11] the Living God with my mind Paul said we
[1:17:17] have the mind of Christ amen
[1:17:20] he's given us his mind born again you
[1:17:22] have his mind you have his leadership
[1:17:25] you have his spirit you have his faith
[1:17:27] you have his love and faith which
[1:17:30] pleases God operates by love that's why
[1:17:34] love can't fail that's why I love if you
[1:17:36] have love you're going to trust you're
[1:17:38] gonna be trusting him
[1:17:40] it's our trust in him that he's looking
[1:17:42] for in this hour
[1:17:43] it's our trust how are we going to trust
[1:17:45] him how are we going to stand the storm
[1:17:47] isn't going to get easier as the days go
[1:17:49] by is going to get stronger we are
[1:17:51] facing a body change we are facing it
[1:17:54] now where it's right upon us brother
[1:17:56] sister how much longer I don't know but
[1:17:59] we know we're in the time we know we're
[1:18:00] in the season and we got to we've got
[1:18:03] the stabilizers have been put on the
[1:18:05] ship you've got to hold steady just keep
[1:18:07] right on walking hold to that word and
[1:18:09] don't just casually come in we must
[1:18:13] press in how we gonna press in by the
[1:18:15] word by eating the book by feasting on
[1:18:18] the word for the season for the hour
[1:18:20] because through that comes life if we
[1:18:24] feast on the word for the season we're
[1:18:25] coming underneath that blood and in that
[1:18:27] blood is life and we must have life and
[1:18:30] that life comes through the word for the
[1:18:32] season amen and so and so there's only
[1:18:37] he said now listen it's your mind now
[1:18:39] he's talking so I'm not he's not talking
[1:18:41] about the mind let me let me go over to
[1:18:43] Roman's just a minute six the sixth
[1:18:46] chapter here so I just read something
[1:18:49] else here Romans the sixth chapter
[1:18:55] and I had that written down didn't know
[1:18:56] if I'd read it or not but we'll just
[1:18:58] take that time six verse 12 now here
[1:19:07] again let you notice God's saying to us
[1:19:11] tonight
[1:19:11] don't let he's trying to show you you
[1:19:15] have authority over the spirit of fear
[1:19:19] to not let do not let anything become
[1:19:23] above me you he's given us you you say
[1:19:27] how come how can that be brother David
[1:19:29] because you're his offspring you're his
[1:19:31] seed you're his life you're the one
[1:19:35] you're here you're here because God's
[1:19:38] wanting to see through you take your
[1:19:40] authority as a son you've been given
[1:19:42] authority through his spirit against
[1:19:45] these devils you but you are a king and
[1:19:47] you have rulership over the world and
[1:19:48] over sin and over darkness and over and
[1:19:51] over the devil's and Satan knows that as
[1:19:53] long as you stand with that word there
[1:19:55] and recognize who you are and holding
[1:19:57] that word for there's not one thing he
[1:19:59] can do because you're because my love
[1:20:01] you're holding that word in faith and
[1:20:03] you're applying the token and he's
[1:20:06] helpless we're gonna get into this just
[1:20:09] a minute and further six chapter verse
[1:20:13] 12 let not sin therefore reign in your
[1:20:15] mortal body that you should obey it in
[1:20:18] the lusts thereof because your body your
[1:20:23] human body your human mind is not born
[1:20:26] again and it will gravitate toward the
[1:20:28] negative it will gravitate toward the
[1:20:30] senses it will always pick up that so
[1:20:33] your cart your warfare is not with
[1:20:36] carnal weapons your warfare is the
[1:20:39] Spirit of God it's the Word of God in
[1:20:41] you written here amen made alive in you
[1:20:46] hallelujah that's your that's your
[1:20:49] weapon neither yield your members as
[1:20:52] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin
[1:20:54] but yield yourselves unto God as those
[1:20:58] that are alive from the dead and your
[1:21:00] members as instruments of righteousness
[1:21:02] unto God hallelujah alright so going
[1:21:08] back to this
[1:21:08] here in greatest battle ever fought it's
[1:21:11] your mind that opens up the door now the
[1:21:14] door to what the door to the battlefield
[1:21:17] the door to what comes in there and what
[1:21:20] doesn't the door to that channel see
[1:21:22] it's your mind that now that that mind
[1:21:25] is not your carnal mind
[1:21:26] it's the spirit the mind of Christ it's
[1:21:29] your mind that opens up the door or
[1:21:31] closes the door and listens to your
[1:21:33] conscience listens to your memory
[1:21:35] listens to your affections but when your
[1:21:37] mind closes itself to these things and
[1:21:40] let God the spirit of his word come in
[1:21:45] it blows the rest of the stuff out every
[1:21:49] doubt is gone every fear is gone every
[1:21:51] sensation of doubt is gone every feeling
[1:21:53] is gone there's nothing standing there
[1:21:56] but the Word of God and Satan cannot
[1:21:58] battle against that no sir he cannot
[1:22:01] battle against it now we know that's
[1:22:03] true but give God's Word the first place
[1:22:07] amen you give it the first place you
[1:22:11] give it headship you give it the place
[1:22:13] just like a wife would give her husband
[1:22:16] authority over her body you give it you
[1:22:18] give your husband authority amen you
[1:22:22] give the word the authority over your
[1:22:25] affairs over your circumstance you put
[1:22:29] the word over it and Satan cannot batter
[1:22:31] he cannot stand he cannot break through
[1:22:34] that word there's one thing Satan cannot
[1:22:36] do Jesus defeated him by the word he
[1:22:38] said it's written it's written it's
[1:22:41] written he didn't come and argue with
[1:22:43] the devil he said it's written that's
[1:22:45] what he did he just simply went back to
[1:22:47] the word of what was written of him and
[1:22:49] said it's written amen that's where our
[1:22:52] that's where our defense is that's where
[1:22:54] we defeat the devil is right back to the
[1:22:56] word it's written amen and so as we go

[1:27:28] stand you either gonna let or not let I
[1:27:30] don't care what the circumstances lose

[1:27:37] doing that well if I lose my job then I

[1:28:11] dunno what are we doing with our time
[1:28:13] God's many times right now God's given
[1:28:15] us more time probably we've had in a
[1:28:17] long time he's given us some time what
[1:28:21] are we doing with it
[1:28:22] are we taking time to press into the
[1:28:25] word more we're speaking oh I'm thinking
[1:28:28] to myself we're speaking every one of us
[1:28:30] I'm speaking to all of you out there are
[1:28:32] we giving the time to God are we giving
[1:28:35] over to him are we allowing him to feed
[1:28:38] us a what he's wanting to see what are
[1:28:40] we gonna do what's our what's our action
[1:28:45] toward this are we caught up under the
[1:28:48] the news media are we caught up under
[1:28:50] the panic are we come up into this well
[1:28:52] that this one got it this one's been in
[1:28:54] the message and he's come down with
[1:28:55] coronavirus what are we gonna do are we
[1:28:57] gonna fear it now because someone else
[1:28:59] did then immediately you've produced an
[1:29:01] idol you've made an eye you've given
[1:29:03] over to one but what the word say I will
[1:29:07] keep thee I will lead thee I will
[1:29:11] control where you go and what you do are
[1:29:13] you just follow me that doesn't mean we
[1:29:16] just go out here and buck all the
[1:29:17] government as long as they as long as we
[1:29:20] do things that's not contrary the word
[1:29:21] then we use we still use Sensibility
[1:29:24] God's given us reasoning God given a
[1:29:27] sense but if those things leave the word
[1:29:29] leave it amen so we must stay in the
[1:29:34] word but God's gonna see what we're
[1:29:36] gonna do with it
[1:29:38] amen so we must give God first place
[1:29:42] he doesn't want second place he wants
[1:29:45] the first place you see God wants the
[1:29:48] first place
[1:29:54] he doesn't want the second I'm gonna I
[1:29:57] want to get this over here we don't have
[1:29:59] free thinking you say I do my own
[1:30:01] thinking
[1:30:02] you ain't got no free thinker you're no
[1:30:04] free thinker there's no free thinking
[1:30:06] let the mind that was in Christ being
[1:30:08] you God must have first place in your
[1:30:11] heart first place in your life first
[1:30:13] place in everything that you do or what
[1:30:16] you are God must have first place
[1:30:19] he doesn't want second place he doesn't
[1:30:21] deserve second place he deserves the
[1:30:23] best he deserves the first and all that
[1:30:25] you got he deserves it not what men say
[1:30:28] it's not what the church says it's not
[1:30:30] what the but what the will of God is all
[1:30:33] we need to seek the will of God not the
[1:30:35] favor of your neighbor not the favor of
[1:30:36] your children not the favor of your
[1:30:38] husband or your wife but seek the will
[1:30:40] of God and do that first then everything
[1:30:42] else the will of the wife the will of
[1:30:44] the children will fall right in line
[1:30:46] with it place God first hole brothers
[1:30:50] sister the most important thing in our
[1:30:52] lives to entertain Jesus Christ give him
[1:30:55] first place in worship first place in
[1:30:57] your life first place in your dressing
[1:30:59] first place he deserves the first place
[1:31:02] put it over put it over your clothing
[1:31:04] put it on our wheat doors our Idol our
[1:31:06] clothes and how we look is our Idol the
[1:31:08] opinions of others what is that Idol
[1:31:11] that Satan is trying to use he's trying
[1:31:14] to get you to bow to that thing well as
[1:31:17] I said we can make anything an idol
[1:31:19] Satan can take anything and put it ahead
[1:31:21] of the word if you allow it to be a head
[1:31:24] of a word you're making an idol amen
[1:31:28] we must hold to that little wheel in the
[1:31:30] middle of the wheel let it stabilize
[1:31:32] every move in every motion you make
[1:31:34] every thought you have may it be
[1:31:36] controlled by this power on the inside
[1:31:38] of you because God is setting God is
[1:31:41] setting right in his word and of this
[1:31:46] hour in the evening light and showing
[1:31:48] forth that light so let that little
[1:31:50] wheel it's in your soul that little
[1:31:52] wheel in the middle of the wheel let it
[1:31:55] stabilize every move in every motion
[1:31:56] that you make whatever you do in word or
[1:31:59] deed do it all the name of the Lord
[1:32:01] Jesus Christ amen so let it have first
[1:32:06] place
[1:32:07] you let it as I said Satan has got to
[1:32:10] get you he can't just come in he's first
[1:32:12] got to get you to agree with his will
[1:32:14] before he can do anything and so what is
[1:32:19] God asking for agreement with his will
[1:32:23] amen
[1:32:25] just take its word and that is going to
[1:32:27] determine what's inside of you
[1:32:29] Amen in your soul that's what we want as
[1:32:32] believers that's all we want and so
[1:32:34] Satan say no I mean the Lord saying okay
[1:32:36] let me uncover this a little bit further
[1:32:38] to you
[1:32:39] let me uncover that spirit how it's all
[1:32:41] right around you what it's trying to do
[1:32:43] and that sounds a little harsh and say
[1:32:45] well now you're bowing to an idol but
[1:32:47] that's exactly if you allow that to come
[1:32:49] that's what it is that's what it becomes
[1:32:52] Amen so see flee it flee it and every
[1:32:56] day and every time you come under
[1:32:58] situations and circumstances don't you
[1:33:01] listen don't you allow anything to
[1:33:03] govern you and control you but the word
[1:33:05] yes it's hot and heavy yes the battle's
[1:33:07] heavy it's probably not going to get any
[1:33:09] easier as we go along but that but the
[1:33:12] harder it gets the more true the word
[1:33:14] becomes because it's because God's gonna
[1:33:17] see to it that he's gonna meet your need
[1:33:19] he's gonna face that when you have need
[1:33:21] of it he's got it he's gonna raise a
[1:33:23] standard against it
[1:33:24] is that right you're gonna lift up that
[1:33:26] standard that's what he's doing today
[1:33:28] amen amen all right so God expects his
[1:33:34] children to be dependent upon him
[1:33:36] overcoming look at what he says
[1:33:38] overcoming or to overcome means to
[1:33:40] recognize the devil in every one of his
[1:33:43] tricks he said a lot of people think
[1:33:46] there is no devil it's just a thought
[1:33:48] don't you believe that there's a real
[1:33:49] devil he's just as real as you are
[1:33:51] anybody a real devil and you must
[1:33:53] recognize him real you must know he's
[1:33:56] the devil
[1:33:56] then at the same time you recognize him
[1:33:59] notice what the Prophet says overcome
[1:34:01] means to recognize him in every one of
[1:34:03] his tricks you must recognize him and
[1:34:06] know that he's a devil and he's against
[1:34:08] you then Rose who's he against my
[1:34:11] brother he is he doesn't care about
[1:34:13] David he's against the word that lives
[1:34:15] in me he's against the word that's
[1:34:17] living in you people amen
[1:34:19] he's against that word
[1:34:20] that's what he's against that's what the
[1:34:24] battles about see but you're not you
[1:34:27] don't let them rule over you you let the
[1:34:30] word rule over you
[1:34:31] Amen you you rule over them you're not
[1:34:33] letting him rule over you you rule over
[1:34:35] the over him or over them over these
[1:34:38] things that he's trying to get you to
[1:34:40] bow to maybe like I said it's reasoning
[1:34:42] or conscience or memory or your past or
[1:34:45] your complexes or something that happens
[1:34:48] something that you're going through
[1:34:49] whatever it may be you lay on that word
[1:34:52] you hold that word right steady with it
[1:34:54] maybe you're not feeling well put the
[1:34:56] word over it
[1:34:57] amen amen don't let your senses govern
[1:35:00] what you do don't let that become your
[1:35:02] idol all right so to recognize him you
[1:35:08] must recognize that God that the God in
[1:35:11] you is greater you must recognize his
[1:35:14] against you than to overcome you must
[1:35:16] recognize that the God in you the word
[1:35:19] in you is greater and mightier than he
[1:35:22] is that the one that's in you has
[1:35:24] already overcome him by His grace do we
[1:35:28] realize that he's already overcome and
[1:35:31] God's has already defeated him already
[1:35:34] stripped him of every legal right
[1:35:35] against you and you rest recognize that
[1:35:38] and take a hold of that word and
[1:35:40] recognition of that you must you must
[1:35:43] then how to overcome he must realize
[1:35:45] that he that is in you has already
[1:35:47] overcome him already defeated him that
[1:35:49] makes you more than a conqueror that
[1:35:52] makes you a possessor then of what God
[1:35:55] has conquered for you and God's
[1:35:57] expecting you to take the land amen now
[1:36:01] bow to the not bow to the idols of the
[1:36:03] land now bow to the idols of the flesh
[1:36:06] but bow but bow to the word and take the
[1:36:09] land and so he that sinew has overcome
[1:36:12] him and by his grace you are more than a
[1:36:14] match for him that's real overcoming
[1:36:17] when you recognize amen hallelujah and
[1:36:22] be too far here and we'll be closing
[1:36:24] amen so no free thinking you know a free
[1:36:28] thought coming in God doesn't need your
[1:36:29] opinion
[1:36:30] don't let your opinion become your idol
[1:36:34] amen it's not your opinion about it it's
[1:36:37] what God said about it and act upon that
[1:36:41] if we recognize it to be his word than
[1:36:44] act upon it
[1:36:48] amen
[1:36:58] praise the Lord
[1:36:59] all right let's go to first John four
[1:37:06] first John four four and then move down
[1:37:12] here diverse about 16 but first John
[1:37:14] turn to first John four
[1:37:28] you are of God little children and have
[1:37:33] overcome them because greater is He that
[1:37:37] is in you than he that is in the world
[1:37:41] jump down here to verse and having now
[1:37:45] let me just say this having the same
[1:37:46] spirit in us that was in him then we
[1:37:50] have the same spirit of faith 1st 2nd
[1:37:54] Corinthians 4 said we have the same
[1:37:56] spirit of faith we believe and therefore
[1:37:59] speak I hope we catch that I hope we
[1:38:02] understand that that we have that same
[1:38:04] spirit of faith because the spirit that
[1:38:07] was in him as in us it may be a
[1:38:09] different body outward but the same
[1:38:11] spirit is in us the same word the same
[1:38:14] power the same Authority it's Jesus
[1:38:16] Christ the same amen we have the same
[1:38:20] spirit of faith then in back in 1st John
[1:38:23] 4 he says this verse 17 herein is our
[1:38:29] love let me back up 16 and we have known
[1:38:33] and believed the love that God hath to
[1:38:36] us god is love and he that dwelleth in
[1:38:41] love dwelleth in God other words if
[1:38:44] you're dwelling in God you're dwelling
[1:38:46] in love and God in him herein is our
[1:38:51] love made perfect
[1:38:53] I hope we're seeing that herein is our
[1:38:57] love made perfect that we may have
[1:39:00] boldness in the day of judgment because
[1:39:03] as he is and that's the day we're in
[1:39:06] because as he is so are we in this world
[1:39:11] right now right at this present time
[1:39:14] there's a people in the land there is
[1:39:17] those that dwell in God and God in them
[1:39:19] and as he is so are we in this world
[1:39:24] there is no fear listen to this there is
[1:39:28] no fear in love there is no fear in love
[1:39:37] it's just not there it's not there
[1:39:40] there's no fear in love
[1:39:44] but perfect love that's god's love
[1:39:47] perfect love agape love perfect love
[1:39:50] casteth out fear because fear hath
[1:39:56] torment he that feareth is not made
[1:40:00] perfect or complete in love we love him
[1:40:05] because he first loved us so what is
[1:40:09] love do and I'm gonna close here with
[1:40:11] these next few comments I believe love
[1:40:21] has no fear this is on the token Dallas
[1:40:24] Texas love has no fear love casts out
[1:40:27] fear and I noticed in my meeting so much
[1:40:30] that when I come in into the people one
[1:40:33] of the great things I find among them is
[1:40:35] fear and what makes fear is lack of
[1:40:39] confidence or lack of trust lack of
[1:40:41] faith or other words it's the lack of
[1:40:44] love it's a lack of confidence if you
[1:40:49] lack confidence
[1:40:50] it'll make you fear but if you love it
[1:40:53] casts away that fear Amen and though and
[1:40:59] that's the way God wants his church not
[1:41:02] so many as charter members he wants
[1:41:04] members that's loyal and loves and
[1:41:07] believes and has confidence in him all
[1:41:11] of the great holy church only realized
[1:41:14] its power to do these things but there's
[1:41:18] so much doubt and fear and trembling
[1:41:23] wonder if it will could it happen as
[1:41:28] long as that exists the church can never
[1:41:31] stand upright and when every talk of
[1:41:34] fear is vanished and the holy spirit is
[1:41:37] completely in control of the church then
[1:41:42] all fears are gone and that church has
[1:41:47] the power see why they have everything
[1:41:50] that heaven owns behind them they're
[1:41:53] ambassadors of the throne
[1:41:55] solutely an ambassador of Christ has the
[1:41:58] authority and everything that Christ
[1:42:00] owns belongs to that ambassador he's
[1:42:03] purchased it for you
[1:42:05] God's wanting us to recognize it and
[1:42:08] take it as your own and don't let the
[1:42:13] devil come in and bring fear on your
[1:42:16] situation or whatever it may be and you
[1:42:19] make and yet let him put that as an idol
[1:42:21] of before you and you place that before
[1:42:23] the word god help us god help us to
[1:42:25] recognize this enemy's tricks amen all
[1:42:32] right now he says and he said go ye into
[1:42:37] all the world you are my and witnesses
[1:42:40] after the Holy Ghost has come on you and
[1:42:42] what does a witness is an ambassador is
[1:42:44] to come and witness something the whole
[1:42:46] powers of heaven is right in your hands
[1:42:48] or why do we set and the churches barren
[1:42:52] and we set dormant is because we don't
[1:42:54] recognize these things what is it a lack
[1:43:01] of it's probably a lack of feeding on
[1:43:04] the word as we should be we're giving
[1:43:07] over to other things because faith comes
[1:43:09] by hearing and hearing by the word
[1:43:12] that's where the church is you're always
[1:43:15] scared it's not going to happen
[1:43:17] now brother sister God's church is
[1:43:19] growing that's why God's opening up more
[1:43:24] and more to the enemies see he send them
[1:43:26] covered that's what Satan hates he hates
[1:43:28] preaching like this he hates to be able
[1:43:32] he hates himself uncovered he said
[1:43:38] that's the reason it don't happen
[1:43:40] because you're scared it's not going to
[1:43:42] happen when that fear he said love cast
[1:43:46] out fear and when you got love listen to
[1:43:49] him when you got love fear is gone but
[1:43:52] as long as you got fear love cannot
[1:43:55] operate what is this fear that Satan
[1:43:59] presents to us it's panic it's terror
[1:44:01] it's dread it's worried it's anxiety go
[1:44:05] on and on this spirit of fear is
[1:44:07] timidity or be
[1:44:09] timid other words a lack of courage or
[1:44:11] confidence easily frightened
[1:44:14] apprehensive
[1:44:15] you're a coward your cowardice a lack of
[1:44:18] bravery faint-hearted that's what the
[1:44:21] fear he's given us every one of us every
[1:44:27] one of us faces that almost every day
[1:44:33] he's going to get you to reason he's
[1:44:36] gonna try to get you to think it through
[1:44:42] or put you before it or the situation
[1:44:45] every Cedric center I think I think you
[1:44:47] fully understand I'm closing here
[1:44:49] there's only two faculties that govern a
[1:44:54] human and one of them is faith which
[1:45:00] brings results and the other is fear
[1:45:04] which has no value in it at all faith is
[1:45:09] of God fear is of the devil fear makes
[1:45:11] you weary faith makes you our fear
[1:45:14] excuse me fear makes you worry and fear
[1:45:17] makes you wonder we have faith look at
[1:45:23] what we have I hope you can say Amen out
[1:45:27] there because what do you have if you're
[1:45:30] in Christ you have faith and we have
[1:45:32] love if you're dwelling in God but if we
[1:45:34] but if we had love we have faith in
[1:45:37] other words one can't work without the
[1:45:39] other they both go together for that is
[1:45:42] perfect love casteth out all fear and
[1:45:45] when fear is gone listen to the
[1:45:48] statement I'm closing when fear is gone
[1:45:51] faith is perfect you're scared he won't
[1:45:57] keep his word but I believe that he does
[1:46:00] what is your faith say this evening what
[1:46:03] does your what does your heart say what
[1:46:06] is your faith what does that believer
[1:46:08] say in your word I believe his word his
[1:46:12] word is perfect it's flawless he can't
[1:46:14] make a mistake his ways are perfect and
[1:46:17] he's leading me perfect and he's
[1:46:19] controlling me perfect and no matter
[1:46:21] where I go or what I do he's had
[1:46:22] allow it he must allow it Satan can't
[1:46:25] come walking in unless he allows it so
[1:46:26] we are being tried we are being tested
[1:46:29] we were being tried by these things he's
[1:46:33] allowing Satan to do that to see what
[1:46:35] we're doing to teach us to train us to
[1:46:37] let us see we don't have to come under
[1:46:40] this we can cast it out when fear is
[1:46:45] gone faith is perfect you're scared it
[1:46:47] won't keep his word but I believe he
[1:46:48] does no need of being scared the worst
[1:46:51] thing the devil can put upon you is fear
[1:46:55] amen so we need to cast down the idol of
[1:46:59] fear
[1:47:00] amen amen trust that this has helped you
[1:47:05] out on the line tonight Trust has been a
[1:47:09] blessing to you and God expects his
[1:47:15] children to trust him God expects his
[1:47:20] children to trust him
[1:47:21] for everything they have but we want to
[1:47:24] trust the hand of man don't trust the
[1:47:29] hand of man don't trust jobs don't trust
[1:47:32] nothing but truck don't trust money
[1:47:35] don't make money your idol don't make
[1:47:37] money your criteria whether you do or
[1:47:39] don't whether you serve God or don't
[1:47:42] don't let riches don't let money don't
[1:47:44] let lands don't let houses don't let
[1:47:46] parents or children don't let family
[1:47:48] don't let your clothes don't let your
[1:47:50] your what you see what you feel reason
[1:47:52] memory constants we can go on and on and
[1:47:55] on
[1:47:56] don't let these things govern put the
[1:47:59] word first he doesn't deserve second
[1:48:02] place brother Graham said many make sex
[1:48:06] appeal their idol of worship amen
[1:48:09] he said you need maybe you need new
[1:48:12] clothes that's legitimate but when you
[1:48:14] but when you make that your idol how of
[1:48:18] how you must be so and span all the
[1:48:21] time maybe it's your home maybe it's
[1:48:23] something else has taken that place of
[1:48:25] that thirst and calling it ought to be
[1:48:28] God God is that everlasting satisfying
[1:48:31] portion see we put too much emphasis on
[1:48:35] think we allow even the
[1:48:36] LITTLEST of things to move us away
