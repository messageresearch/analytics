[43:33] how
[43:34] how precious it is uh brother jason made
[43:37] a comment and i want to expound upon
[43:39] that just
[43:40] a little bit the dire condition
[43:44] now by brother and sister we could
[43:46] probably go to
[43:47] every continent and find
[43:51] sons and daughters of god the bride of
[43:53] jesus christ
[43:54] that's in dire circumstance and
[43:57] and uh certainly there would be
[44:00] so many needs individually i mean even
[44:04] sometimes within this just the north and
[44:06] the south and the east and the west of a
[44:08] of a county or a country or continent
[44:11] there would be these needs but just as i
[44:14] bring this
[44:16] uh to your attention i just want to
[44:19] share that
[44:20] we have sent an offering on your behalf
[44:22] right we
[44:24] we our grace tabernacle
[44:27] not one individual not one family not
[44:31] we are the family amen so we have sent
[44:34] an offering on your behalf
[44:36] there is an avenue by which a limited
[44:38] amount of supplies can be shipped into
[44:40] venezuela
[44:42] and it's not something that can be done
[44:46] in an extensive way
[44:48] but you know as the reports come back
[44:52] how god just knows where to distribute
[44:55] how to do it and
[44:56] and for a season it was closed down but
[44:59] it appears that the
[45:00] door has opened again or not appears it
[45:02] is open again
[45:04] for for you know a pallet or two here
[45:07] and there to be sent
[45:09] in and saints says the reports come back
[45:12] if you can only imagine someone crying
[45:15] and thanking god for the simple fact
[45:17] that one little thing came to them
[45:22] get this yes to brush their teeth with
[45:26] real toothpaste
[45:28] after a year or two
[45:32] something special to them so we have
[45:35] sent
[45:36] an offering on your behalf
[45:39] for the saints there in venezuela
[45:43] it is so bad that the military in
[45:45] colombia
[45:46] and peru and brazil have now blockaded
[45:49] the borders with their military
[45:52] to keep venezuelans from crossing
[45:55] a mass exodus
[45:58] one brother that has a church very close
[46:00] to the border of venezuela
[46:02] has reported back that the streets the
[46:06] alleys
[46:06] every vacant place in their village has
[46:10] people
[46:10] sleeping on the ground they have no work
[46:12] they have no food
[46:14] many of them only the clothes on their
[46:16] back and they're begging
[46:18] and thus in the natural it is also
[46:21] tearing down the structure of colombia
[46:24] peru
[46:25] brazil because of the flood of people
[46:28] and many of them are believers
[46:31] and we know that god has everything in
[46:33] control
[46:34] so i just ask you to lift it up we think
[46:37] that it's bad
[46:39] here sometimes but god
[46:43] knows and god guides and so just
[46:46] remember them
[46:46] in your prayers amen hallelujah
[46:50] once again i say it's good to be in the
[46:51] house of the lord today
[46:53] i'd just like to speak to you this
[46:55] morning
[46:56] on redemption's manifestation
[46:59] there is light in the valley amen
[47:03] and i've preached on this subject before
[47:05] but saints just as uh
[47:07] we're sometimes have ups and downs in
[47:10] our lives and
[47:11] as i was just reading my bible amen did
[47:14] you like that little video this last
[47:15] sunday
[47:16] just a reminder of the direct benefit of
[47:19] reading
[47:20] our bible amen not just once or twice or
[47:23] three times isn't that interesting how
[47:24] that was brought out
[47:26] you know once no perceptible difference
[47:28] twice no perceptible difference three
[47:30] times
[47:30] no perceptible different four spikes up
[47:34] five spikes up six spikes up
[47:37] hallelujah just think if we just listen
[47:39] to what brother branham encouraged
[47:42] and read our bible every single
[47:45] day wow hallelujah
[47:48] amen oh my i get a shiver from that
[47:52] hallelujah there is light in the valley
[47:54] let's stand and turn to the 23rd psalm
[47:57] amen what a beautiful piece of scripture
[48:00] that is there
[48:00] my brother and sister uh just uh
[48:04] um well let's read it together
[48:08] hallelujah instead of just the preacher
[48:10] reading something to you
[48:11] let's let's read it together okay
[48:16] the lord is my shepherd
[48:20] i shall not want he
[48:23] maketh me to lie down in green
[48:26] pastures he leadeth me beside
[48:30] the still waters he restoreth my soul
[48:35] he leadeth me in the path of
[48:37] righteousness
[48:38] for his name sake yea
[48:41] though i walk through the valley of the
[48:44] shadow of death
[48:45] i will fear no evil for thou
[48:49] art with me thy rod and thy staff
[48:52] they comfort me thou preparest a
[48:56] table before me in the presence of mine
[48:59] enemies
[49:00] thou anoint us my head with oil
[49:03] my cup runneth over surely
[49:07] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[49:10] the days of my life
[49:12] and i will dwell in the house of the
[49:15] lord forever
[49:17] amen lord we ask for your blessing upon
[49:20] the word of god and its blessing that it
[49:22] shares to us
[49:23] in the name of jesus christ amen you may
[49:26] be seated
[49:28] you know as we would look at this my
[49:29] brother and sister we can read this as a
[49:32] beautiful passage of scripture
[49:34] uh an encouraging line or we can read it
[49:38] as it were
[49:38] as a storyline of our lives and if we
[49:41] read it as a story line of our lives and
[49:43] we will identify with each and every
[49:45] every uh verse it is not my brother and
[49:48] sister
[49:49] uh let me just put a clarity of what's
[49:51] rumbling through my mind
[49:52] many times in scripture we refer to
[49:55] chapter and verse
[49:56] but you see it was man now i believe by
[49:59] inspiration but it was
[50:00] men who put the place that the break
[50:04] and the stop and the period and the
[50:06] verse number you see god's
[50:08] word is one continuous story amen
[50:11] it isn't broken as it were like we break
[50:13] it up
[50:14] but yet you can read it as one
[50:16] continuous we have a reference point
[50:18] verse this verse that
[50:19] but to read the thing as a complete
[50:22] story to you and i
[50:24] and we'll touch on that in just a little
[50:26] bit so as we read this
[50:28] uh 23rd psalm as a storyline of our life
[50:32] right we have to identify with this
[50:34] in our own life and you know just for
[50:37] the sake of
[50:37] example this morning i would just take
[50:40] at this point
[50:41] amen the lord is paul's shepherd i shall
[50:44] not want
[50:45] he maketh paul to lie down in green
[50:47] pastures
[50:48] he leadeth paul beside the still water
[50:51] see if you read it in that context
[50:53] and identify yourself in the scripture
[50:56] that this is not god just speaking to
[50:59] someone
[51:00] uh many years ago but this is god
[51:02] speaking to you
[51:03] today amen that's how you need to take
[51:06] the bible
[51:07] approach it is god speaking to me
[51:10] today and insert your name into the word
[51:13] of god when you read it
[51:15] now you know we've talked about this
[51:16] many times in the past
[51:18] there's not everything that's written in
[51:20] the bible is for the believer
[51:22] right we are not being thrown into the
[51:24] pit right we are not
[51:25] uh considered adulterers or iniquity or
[51:28] unrighteousness
[51:29] so there's many portions of the
[51:31] scripture that don't identify with us
[51:33] but my brother and sister according to
[51:35] the word every promise
[51:37] that is given to a son or daughter of
[51:40] god
[51:40] as a scripture in revelations 19 that we
[51:43] are his wife
[51:44] and that's why we identify as the bride
[51:46] of christ right because the bride and
[51:48] the wife
[51:49] are parallel and so as the bride of
[51:52] christ we
[51:52] are identified in the word and so we
[51:56] stand today
[51:57] and insert ourself now some people might
[51:59] think that that is presumptuous i've
[52:01] been told before
[52:02] that to put our pla ourselves into that
[52:04] is presumptuous but
[52:06] the prophet of god told us to identify
[52:08] ourselves
[52:09] in the word of god and so by identifying
[52:13] ourself
[52:14] into that i say i am the bride of christ
[52:17] amen i
[52:18] i'm revelations 19 5 6 7 8
[52:21] 9 amen that's who i am and and i
[52:25] identify that and now if people are just
[52:27] looking for a place to feel good
[52:29] right and this is an issue that we have
[52:31] in the day that we live in
[52:32] when you are talking with someone and
[52:34] they say well
[52:35] i go to church because it makes me feel
[52:38] good well that's wonderful i go to
[52:40] church because it makes me feel good too
[52:41] but the reason i come to church and the
[52:43] feeling good
[52:44] is the fact that i recognize the word is
[52:47] changing me
[52:48] amen i'm not just here to feel good and
[52:50] go home
[52:51] amen now look i just don't don't get
[52:54] bent out of shape over this eating ice
[52:56] cream makes me feel good
[52:59] but it won't save me in fact it will
[53:01] tear me down
[53:03] so feeling good is irrelevant right the
[53:06] scripture
[53:06] says that your heart would deceive you
[53:09] so you can feel good about things
[53:11] and it not be on a foundation that will
[53:13] give you eternal life
[53:15] now i want to just go back for a moment
[53:17] just through the scripture and
[53:18] you know as i said here i want to just
[53:20] identify this
[53:22] when we come to the place my brother and
[53:23] sister that you will make an emphatic
[53:25] irreversible statement
[53:28] and that is where you come to a place
[53:30] that it is a statement though seemingly
[53:32] contradictory
[53:33] you will not take it back you will not
[53:35] recant
[53:36] upon that statement amen and i would
[53:38] like you to as we just touch on this for
[53:40] a moment
[53:41] to make these irreversible statements
[53:45] on your part amen that you cannot recant
[53:47] from you cannot go back you cannot step
[53:49] away from
[53:50] amen the lord is my shepherd amen that
[53:54] leaves with that kind of a approach that
[53:56] leaves
[53:57] there is simply no other
[54:00] statement can take that statement's
[54:03] place are you with me
[54:06] there's not room for another shepherd
[54:10] there's not room for another form of
[54:12] leadership
[54:13] regardless if it makes you feel good or
[54:15] not
[54:17] my my brother and sister when the 70
[54:20] were with jesus they were quite
[54:21] convinced my brother and sister that
[54:23] there was something supernatural there
[54:25] but when he looked them in the face and
[54:26] said you must eat my flesh and drink
[54:28] my blood they said well he's went over
[54:31] the edge
[54:32] but you see there were some as it was
[54:34] and he said well will you leave me too
[54:36] oh don't you love those beautiful words
[54:39] where
[54:40] would we go there is no place
[54:44] for us to go
[54:47] some said oh we're going back to our
[54:49] church we're going back to our old ways
[54:51] we're going
[54:52] back to this and back to that but there
[54:54] was some oh hallelujah there was some
[54:56] that stood there and said
[54:57] where would we go
[55:00] i've got nowhere else to go
[55:05] and it wasn't based on an emotional
[55:07] thing
[55:08] because they still had houses and lands
[55:10] fathers and mothers sisters and brothers
[55:13] but their soul was what was crying out
[55:16] we've got
[55:17] nowhere else to go
[55:20] hallelujah aren't you glad today
[55:24] amen i shall not want
[55:28] look i tell you what my brother and
[55:29] sister we live in laodicea we live in an
[55:32] age that
[55:32] and that look we're all guilty i don't
[55:34] mean to demean or speak down to anyone
[55:36] but we're all guilty
[55:37] of saying i want this
[55:41] now this is not to take away from the
[55:43] human element that there are certain
[55:45] things we want
[55:46] we were just talking brother jason
[55:48] sister emmy uh uh uh
[55:50] we're we're there at the house for a few
[55:52] minutes and we were just talking and
[55:54] we're telling them
[55:55] when the day is appropriate we're gonna
[55:57] buy us a four-door chevy pickup for a
[56:00] family car
[56:02] hallelujah long as i don't bankrupt
[56:05] myself and i don't backslide to own one
[56:07] what's wrong with owning a four-door
[56:09] pickup for a family car
[56:11] hallelujah it's a real man's family car
[56:18] thank you hallelujah
[56:22] you see but we have to temper what our
[56:24] wants is because you see
[56:26] want very easily and i'm not going to
[56:28] speak on this topic i'm just going to
[56:30] touch on it move on
[56:31] but want can very easily move over into
[56:34] the lust
[56:35] of the flesh
[56:36] [Music]
[56:39] so we have to leave that in god's hands
[56:42] ask for his leadership lord if you want
[56:44] you know i just share this just a
[56:45] personal note and i am sidetracked
[56:48] when i was in high school and then on
[56:52] up and got married to sister jerry and
[56:54] years after that
[56:56] i always wanted a yellow corvette
[57:01] that's just the other side of me in case
[57:03] you didn't know i could see myself
[57:06] you know oh that's me oh look at that
[57:08] one i'd settle for a red one
[57:10] oh i would take a black one too but the
[57:13] day came
[57:15] when i probably could own one
[57:18] and i realize it's not that important
[57:21] any longer
[57:23] you see that's when we start to submit
[57:25] ourselves to the will of god
[57:27] we can say i would like this i still
[57:29] like corvettes when one goes down the
[57:30] road i'm like
[57:33] nice hallelujah
[57:38] i'm not totally off on my own am i
[57:43] but you see i realize of the things in
[57:46] life
[57:47] that's not very high on the list any
[57:49] longer
[57:52] and if i never own a nice
[57:55] totally loaded leather seats
[57:59] chrome wheels running boards
[58:02] four-door pickup for a family car
[58:07] my life won't go down the drain
[58:11] but i stand here to make my point and
[58:13] say i want one
[58:16] but is that the want the scripture is
[58:19] talking about
[58:22] no it's not you see
[58:26] the thirst of the soul becomes a
[58:30] preeminent factor
[58:31] in the life of a son or daughter of god
[58:35] when the soul starts crying out i could
[58:38] bring you many references today
[58:39] according to the words of the prophet
[58:41] but my brother and sister when the soul
[58:44] cries out
[58:45] for the things of god when the soul
[58:48] yearns
[58:49] when the soul speaks out in the midnight
[58:51] hour
[58:52] when the soul is hungry god said i will
[58:55] fill
[58:56] it and i will satisfy it and in that
[58:59] sons and daughters of god
[59:00] the words start to come in preeminence
[59:03] to them they start to
[59:04] hunger for it they start to cry out to
[59:07] understand it
[59:08] and to see it manifested in their life
[59:11] and god said you won't want
[59:14] amen if you are sincere and you cry out
[59:17] to the lord
[59:18] you will not find your soul hungry
[59:21] you will find yourself satisfied in the
[59:25] things of god
[59:26] hallelujah my brother and sister i could
[59:30] go on into many things that go with this
[59:31] but it would take too long
[59:33] but i want you to understand if you feel
[59:35] a yearning in your soul remember the
[59:37] prophet of god said the deep calleth to
[59:39] the deep
[59:40] make sure what you're crying out for is
[59:42] the correct thing
[59:44] otherwise the want will continue to
[59:48] exist or remain in your life
[59:50] now i like verse 2 he maketh me to lie
[59:53] down in green
[59:54] pastures now you know that would almost
[59:57] sound like he just
[59:58] forced you to go he maketh but when you
[1:00:01] go
[1:00:02] and you research this and look into it
[1:00:04] and you don't have to look very deep
[1:00:06] the the basic uh simplistic definition
[1:00:08] of maketh
[1:00:09] comes to a cause to happen
[1:00:13] so he would cause us oh my brother and
[1:00:15] sister it's not of a parent
[1:00:17] that's angry at their unruly child in
[1:00:19] church that grabs them by the
[1:00:21] back of the neck and walks them out of
[1:00:22] church you know that kid could say my
[1:00:25] daddy maketh me go into the basement
[1:00:29] hey man i remember a child once sister
[1:00:32] jerry shares his testimony
[1:00:34] up misbehaving in church and and all
[1:00:37] this and his daddy grabbed a hold of his
[1:00:39] packing him out of church and the little
[1:00:40] kid leaned over his daddy's back that's
[1:00:42] a real story
[1:00:43] leaned over his daddy's back and goes
[1:00:45] church pray for me
[1:00:51] daddy maketh but you see this is not the
[1:00:54] case he maketh me
[1:00:57] to lie down in green pastures is not god
[1:01:00] grabbing you by the nap of the neck
[1:01:01] and taking you down into a green pasture
[1:01:04] somewhere and saying stay here
[1:01:05] but he is causing bringing the effect
[1:01:08] that causes us to
[1:01:10] go a yearning of hungering a desire
[1:01:13] and something that leads us right down
[1:01:15] into that green pasture
[1:01:16] because he knows what's in that pasture
[1:01:19] is necessary for you and i and he puts
[1:01:22] that hunger
[1:01:23] in the soul to say lord i submit to your
[1:01:26] leadership
[1:01:27] i submit to your will not the grand a
[1:01:29] hand of a great big father
[1:01:31] forcing you but because you are sons and
[1:01:35] daughters of god
[1:01:36] predestination as it were he leads you
[1:01:40] he inspires you he puts a hunger in you
[1:01:43] a desire is there to go there
[1:01:47] hallelujah you see this can also be
[1:01:50] brought when you research this out
[1:01:52] maketh is caused to happen in simplicity
[1:01:55] uh maketh to cause to happen amen versus
[1:01:59] leaving to chance amen
[1:02:03] he by chance
[1:02:07] no my brother and sister god don't
[1:02:08] operate that way
[1:02:10] not a god that knows every
[1:02:13] hair on your head not a god that knows
[1:02:17] everything about creation
[1:02:19] did not leave to chance you
[1:02:22] coming to his word he never left it if
[1:02:26] they stumble into my word i'll heal them
[1:02:28] i'll save them i'll preserve them no
[1:02:32] he didn't do that it was by divine
[1:02:35] leadership oh my brother and sister by
[1:02:38] divine leadership
[1:02:40] he calls to happen that we would desire
[1:02:43] to be there in that green pasture
[1:02:45] and to be at those still waters oh
[1:02:49] hallelujah he restoreth my soul that
[1:02:52] means our soul was fallen
[1:02:54] you can't restore something that's not
[1:02:56] separated
[1:02:57] he restoreth my soul
[1:03:01] oh hallelujah i think we could just
[1:03:03] close down right now just have a little
[1:03:05] prayer and worship
[1:03:06] and just stand up and praise the lord
[1:03:07] for the next hour he restoreth my soul
[1:03:11] i was lost i was undone i had fallen
[1:03:14] away
[1:03:14] i had got cold on god
[1:03:18] amen
[1:03:21] come on
[1:03:25] you know some natural things type
[1:03:27] spirituals so closely
[1:03:30] just looked at a headline the other day
[1:03:32] brother jason brought it up which
[1:03:33] stirred my mind
[1:03:34] in the in the back room
[1:03:38] seven days to a healthy habit
[1:03:45] seven days to being cold
[1:03:48] on god
[1:03:51] what works forward works in reverse amen
[1:03:55] read your bible and pray every single
[1:03:57] day
[1:03:58] right even research i'm going to look
[1:04:00] back in that video figure out who those
[1:04:02] people are and see if they have more
[1:04:03] stuff
[1:04:05] i was interested but my brother and
[1:04:07] sister
[1:04:08] if it takes your bible four times
[1:04:11] reading your bible
[1:04:12] four times a week to spike something in
[1:04:14] you as a nature
[1:04:16] my brother and sister then and it
[1:04:18] multiplies he said it didn't just ramp
[1:04:20] up
[1:04:21] it it's spike that's the word i'm
[1:04:24] looking for
[1:04:25] it's spiked up hallelujah
[1:04:28] now what is the reverse what is the
[1:04:31] reverse i want you to think about that
[1:04:33] amen i'm gonna i'm gonna do what they
[1:04:36] call a
[1:04:38] reverse theoretical
[1:04:41] analysis
[1:04:44] okay just a little psychology for you i
[1:04:46] know you're all into that
[1:04:51] last week i read my bible seven times
[1:04:53] praise the lord felt inspired
[1:04:55] this week i read it six times
[1:04:58] the week after that i read it five times
[1:05:02] the week after i read it four times
[1:05:05] then three then two then one
[1:05:08] then zero you know what
[1:05:12] the reverse theoretical analysis shows
[1:05:14] you
[1:05:17] i read it once nothing really changed
[1:05:20] twice nothing really changed three times
[1:05:21] nothing really changed
[1:05:22] four five six
[1:05:26] seven but in a reverse theoretical
[1:05:29] analysis
[1:05:31] it will be seven
[1:05:34] six five
[1:05:40] four three two
[1:05:44] one zero
[1:05:52] praise the lord
[1:05:55] think about it who do you want to be
[1:06:01] let me tell you a little story i
[1:06:02] recently read about a man who was
[1:06:04] sitting among some school
[1:06:06] kids i think they were in high school
[1:06:09] the man was very successful
[1:06:10] a businessman was very
[1:06:14] committed to the community he was trying
[1:06:17] to encourage these young men so he sits
[1:06:18] down amongst these kids
[1:06:20] like i said high school kids and he says
[1:06:22] um
[1:06:23] as he starts through the kids what do
[1:06:25] you want to be i i want to be
[1:06:27] a plumber like my dad everybody's like
[1:06:29] oh plumber
[1:06:33] i want to be this i want to be this i
[1:06:34] want to be a dis i want to be a doctor
[1:06:36] why do you want to be a doctor doctors
[1:06:37] are rich
[1:06:40] one kid just cut to the chase i don't
[1:06:42] want to work i just want to be rich
[1:06:47] the man looked at all these kids and he
[1:06:49] come back and he says
[1:06:50] who's most likely to succeed in this
[1:06:52] class
[1:06:56] and a lot of the kids said well the one
[1:06:57] that wants to be a doctor the one that
[1:06:59] wants to be a lawyer they make the most
[1:07:00] money they'll be successful he said no
[1:07:02] you're wrong the plumber will be
[1:07:04] because the plumber is willing to work
[1:07:06] for what he has and as he labors he will
[1:07:09] be
[1:07:10] a a um steward
[1:07:13] he'll be a steward because he labored or
[1:07:16] are you with me
[1:07:17] he'll be a steward because he labored
[1:07:19] for what he got
[1:07:22] and therefore he'll take care of it but
[1:07:25] the one who would be given the wealth
[1:07:27] will squander it because easy come easy
[1:07:30] go
[1:07:32] my brother and sister that's why god's
[1:07:34] making you labor
[1:07:36] imagine if god just said oh you come up
[1:07:37] here and and touch the whatever or do
[1:07:40] this or do that you'll have the holy
[1:07:41] ghost and just go
[1:07:42] now you know there's no effort involved
[1:07:45] do you ever notice the direct
[1:07:46] correlation young people
[1:07:49] that if you sweat for that first vehicle
[1:07:51] you ever own
[1:07:52] you won't be jumping curbs you won't be
[1:07:54] driving through the bar ditch
[1:07:56] you won't be burning out the tires
[1:07:59] because you'd be there like if i ruin
[1:08:00] these tires i'm gonna have to sweat and
[1:08:03] labor
[1:08:03] for more
[1:08:08] if the holy ghost was just something now
[1:08:10] look the holy ghost comes from the
[1:08:11] laying on of hands
[1:08:12] you realize that's scriptural right come
[1:08:15] from the laying on of hands but did you
[1:08:17] realize
[1:08:17] the hands never got laid until the
[1:08:19] vessel was ready
[1:08:21] god didn't just randomly run out on the
[1:08:23] streets and the highways and byways
[1:08:25] just laying hands on everybody giving
[1:08:27] them the holy ghost that person had
[1:08:29] labored
[1:08:29] and they had moved forward and they had
[1:08:31] got themselves into a position
[1:08:33] and the laying on of hands that
[1:08:35] anointing for god to come down
[1:08:37] into their atmosphere and give them the
[1:08:39] holy ghost
[1:08:40] was actually the identifier of the
[1:08:43] preparation that brought them to be a
[1:08:45] vessel ready to receive the holy ghost
[1:08:49] if not in the carnal element right we
[1:08:51] see it in the scripture hey uh
[1:08:52] what would it cost me to have this gift
[1:08:55] i would like that gift also i'll write
[1:08:57] you a check i'll put gold in the
[1:08:59] offering i'll do whatever give me the
[1:09:00] gift
[1:09:02] amen hallelujah
[1:09:06] i want to just touch on verse 5 before
[1:09:07] we go on
[1:09:10] god loves you so much of all the places
[1:09:12] he could prepare a table for you
[1:09:15] he went down and found your enemies and
[1:09:18] he put the table right there in the
[1:09:19] midst of your enemies
[1:09:23] and set that table for you i've said
[1:09:27] this before
[1:09:29] i'll say it again that brother
[1:09:33] that sister that preacher
[1:09:36] that you don't like so much they were
[1:09:40] god's special gift
[1:09:41] to you
[1:09:45] but i don't like them that's all right
[1:09:49] god set you with that table amen
[1:09:52] hallelujah well some of you ought to
[1:09:55] really be saying well thank you lord
[1:09:56] that be a revelation to you
[1:09:59] yeah why because we need to be sharpened
[1:10:09] all this mind moan manners this morning
[1:10:16] we look here in isaiah i want to move
[1:10:19] forward
[1:10:19] my brothers and sisters as we would look
[1:10:21] here as we see this
[1:10:23] line in the storyline you might say in
[1:10:25] the 23rd psalm
[1:10:27] showing us so clearly how uh god has set
[1:10:30] the stage
[1:10:31] he knows how to take care of us he knows
[1:10:33] how to lead us can i get an amen on that
[1:10:36] amen and everything he has done for us
[1:10:39] is for our goodness and and i should
[1:10:41] just touch on verse six real quick
[1:10:43] for surely goodness and mercy shall
[1:10:45] follow me all the days of my life
[1:10:47] now look saints i'm going to speak real
[1:10:48] blunt to you for just a second here
[1:10:50] if you cannot right now say i
[1:10:53] say amen to verse 6 that surely goodness
[1:10:56] and mercy
[1:10:57] shall follow me all the days of my life
[1:10:58] you need to find an altar
[1:11:00] because if you just had one inkling of
[1:11:03] what satan desire to do to your life
[1:11:06] amen to realize what level he could
[1:11:09] debase you
[1:11:10] if he had been given free reign what his
[1:11:13] desire
[1:11:13] to you what he wanted to do to you
[1:11:18] if you just could recognize that you
[1:11:20] would realize that surely goodness and
[1:11:22] mercy has been
[1:11:23] following you amen and for you to be
[1:11:27] able to say you know what surely
[1:11:28] goodness and mercy
[1:11:29] shall see it's not might but shall
[1:11:32] follow me all the days of my life and i
[1:11:35] come on can you put your name in there
[1:11:36] this morning
[1:11:37] and i will dwell in the house of the
[1:11:40] lord forever
[1:11:41] you have to reach out and claim that as
[1:11:43] that goes by
[1:11:45] hallelujah oh my my brother and sister
[1:11:48] how beautiful that
[1:11:49] is now we go to isaiah the ninth chapter
[1:11:52] nevertheless the dimness shall not be
[1:11:55] such as was in her vexation
[1:11:58] when at the first he lightly afflicted
[1:11:59] the land of zebula in the land of
[1:12:01] nephthali
[1:12:02] afterward did more grievously afflict
[1:12:04] her by the way of the sea beyond jordan
[1:12:06] in galilee of the nations
[1:12:08] the people that walked in darkness
[1:12:12] hallelujah the people that walked in
[1:12:16] darkness
[1:12:17] have seen a great light
[1:12:20] oh hallelujah i want you now some of you
[1:12:22] might not recognize this and i'm not
[1:12:24] because it's broke here that works out
[1:12:25] perfectly for me
[1:12:27] amen i'm not going to bring this right
[1:12:29] down to you my brother and sister
[1:12:30] right at this very second but i want you
[1:12:32] to recognize the people that walked in
[1:12:35] darkness have seen a great light
[1:12:37] they that dwell in the land of the
[1:12:40] shadow
[1:12:40] of death upon them hath the light
[1:12:44] shined amen tie this right back to the
[1:12:47] 23rd
[1:12:47] psalm and you realize though the lord
[1:12:50] would lead you
[1:12:51] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:12:53] death it
[1:12:54] is not death it's merely the shadow
[1:12:57] and where there is a shadow there has to
[1:12:59] be light behind it
[1:13:01] or there would be no shadow and in that
[1:13:04] valley that place that season that time
[1:13:07] of the shadow of death god come along
[1:13:10] and says i won't even have you walking
[1:13:12] in a shadow
[1:13:13] in this valley this valley i have
[1:13:16] brought you
[1:13:17] into and don't even have a single shadow
[1:13:20] because i have come and brought a great
[1:13:24] light
[1:13:25] amen we're not here in this day this
[1:13:28] hour this season of time of history
[1:13:31] we're not here my brother and sister to
[1:13:33] be walking in his presence out of his
[1:13:35] presence in his presence
[1:13:37] out of his presence the light has come
[1:13:39] to our valley
[1:13:40] i don't care how deep your valley is you
[1:13:42] say i haven't been on a mountaintop in a
[1:13:44] long time
[1:13:45] well i want you to go back and read this
[1:13:46] scripture again and again and again
[1:13:48] because there's now light in the valley
[1:13:52] hey man you don't have to get on a
[1:13:53] mountaintop some euphoric high
[1:13:55] i got a great job i got a great wife i
[1:13:57] got great kids i drive a great car i
[1:13:59] live in a great house
[1:14:00] i go to a great church oh i'll be
[1:14:03] presumptuous got a great pastor
[1:14:08] i didn't even get an amen out of that
[1:14:11] i got a chuckle i got your attention i
[1:14:13] guess that's as good as an amen
[1:14:16] but look in this valley my brother and
[1:14:18] sister
[1:14:21] there's light i don't care how deep you
[1:14:25] think your valley is
[1:14:27] he didn't send light halfway down the
[1:14:29] mountain he didn't send light two-thirds
[1:14:31] the way down the mountain
[1:14:32] he sent light to the very floor of the
[1:14:36] valley
[1:14:37] in the very hole in the floor of the
[1:14:39] valley where you think your life has
[1:14:41] fallen in
[1:14:42] there's light there oh
[1:14:46] see upon them upon them what is it the
[1:14:49] people
[1:14:52] that's right paul walked in darkness has
[1:14:56] seen a great light
[1:14:57] paul that dwelt in the land of the
[1:14:59] shadow of death
[1:15:01] upon paul hath the light shined
[1:15:04] hallelujah come on read your name in
[1:15:06] there make it real to you
[1:15:10] well i'm just not i'm just not happy
[1:15:12] just seems like everything is such a
[1:15:14] struggle
[1:15:14] i just wished it was easier i thought
[1:15:16] that you know that god would be so good
[1:15:18] to me and everything would be a picnic
[1:15:21] you know what happens when you eat too
[1:15:22] many picnics
[1:15:24] i don't even need to tell you amen
[1:15:28] they're cold carbs
[1:15:35] you know what carbs is called empty
[1:15:38] worship
[1:15:41] praise with no content
[1:15:46] song with no spirit
[1:15:50] soul with no foundation
[1:15:55] the picnic
[1:15:59] as i was thinking about this this
[1:16:00] morning hopefully you're not all shocked
[1:16:04] sitting in my office i just turned the
[1:16:06] computer on
[1:16:08] and i went over and
[1:16:11] i typed in lyrics to a certain song
[1:16:15] and as i was looking for the words of
[1:16:17] that song never did find him
[1:16:20] there was another song there so i
[1:16:22] clicked on it
[1:16:26] and there it was probably 5 000 people
[1:16:31] big coliseum the camera is moving
[1:16:35] then it got darker and darker
[1:16:38] and then the blue lights and the red
[1:16:40] lights and the orange lights and the
[1:16:42] yellow lights
[1:16:43] started moving and the first thing on
[1:16:46] the video
[1:16:48] was this shaggy-haired dog with his
[1:17:00] drumsticks
[1:17:03] you know young people you know what took
[1:17:04] me back to
[1:17:07] remember what was his name
[1:17:16] elton john singing his songs playing his
[1:17:20] music
[1:17:21] until he's exhausted the sweat dripping
[1:17:23] off of him
[1:17:24] and he goes off the stage goes in and he
[1:17:26] sets down and they're like are you all
[1:17:28] right he's like
[1:17:28] i can't go any further i can't go any
[1:17:30] further
[1:17:32] i can't go any further any shaggy-haired
[1:17:42] dog
[1:17:48] and he's there and you can see out in
[1:17:49] john's face
[1:17:52] pretty soon he gets up goes out there
[1:17:54] sets down
[1:17:58] only this was a church
[1:18:04] how do we huh how do we how do we
[1:18:07] what's the word i'm searching for
[1:18:11] how do we draw the holy spirit what's
[1:18:14] the scripture say
[1:18:18] draw nigh unto me draw nigh unto me and
[1:18:21] i'll draw nigh unto you
[1:18:25] you see we don't draw the holy ghost by
[1:18:27] beating on drums or playing a certain
[1:18:29] beat
[1:18:30] we draw the holy ghost by drawing nigh
[1:18:33] unto him what is he
[1:18:36] the word we draw nigh into the word
[1:18:40] he draws nigh to us but you see in a
[1:18:43] religious spirit realm
[1:18:45] they're not actually calling on the holy
[1:18:47] ghost they're saints
[1:18:49] and then they come out there and they
[1:18:51] sing their songs and i looked at that
[1:18:53] and i thought there it is
[1:18:54] right here it's so obvious it's right
[1:18:56] out in the face of everyone
[1:18:58] it's not even hid
[1:19:05] come on not even hid
[1:19:08] it's right in their face oh my
[1:19:12] the people that walked in darkness have
[1:19:14] seen great light
[1:19:16] they dwelt in the land of the shadow of
[1:19:18] death upon them half the light shine
[1:19:20] reminds me of a lady i'm sad she didn't
[1:19:22] come back and visit she actually had a
[1:19:23] very nice spirit about her here
[1:19:25] probably a year ago come set in the
[1:19:27] service i spoke to her afterwards she
[1:19:29] said she was just
[1:19:30] so blessed so good and she said i'm so
[1:19:32] glad to see you guys had the lights on
[1:19:34] because i'm not a mushroom
[1:19:41] hallelujah well
[1:19:44] mushrooms probably do grow in the light
[1:19:47] at some point in
[1:19:48] time i guess i don't know never
[1:19:51] set out to grow a mushroom but
[1:19:55] have you ever noticed that sons and
[1:19:56] daughters of god they they like the
[1:19:58] light
[1:20:00] they like light shining on them
[1:20:03] oh those he loves he chastens well it
[1:20:05] hurts to be chastened yes but we love it
[1:20:09] we love it amen oh my let me go on
[1:20:13] the house multiply the nation and not
[1:20:15] increase the joy the joy before the
[1:20:16] according to the joy and harvest
[1:20:18] and as men rejoice when they divide the
[1:20:21] spoil
[1:20:21] now this scripture really leaped out to
[1:20:23] me saints and i might not make it
[1:20:24] through today i thought i would but my
[1:20:26] time just flies
[1:20:27] but look at this i want you to think
[1:20:29] about this thou hast multiplied the
[1:20:31] nation and not increased the joy
[1:20:33] they joy before thee according to the
[1:20:35] joy and harvest
[1:20:39] and they have joy as men rejoice when
[1:20:41] they divide the spoil
[1:20:44] but do you realize what they're actually
[1:20:46] saying there
[1:20:48] when you have a joy that's in the joy of
[1:20:50] the harvest
[1:20:53] it only lasts for a season
[1:20:56] when you have joy that is those that
[1:20:59] divide the
[1:21:00] spoil it only lasts
[1:21:03] as long as there is spoil to be divided
[1:21:08] but we as sons and daughters of god
[1:21:11] hallelujah now we're human we have good
[1:21:12] days and bad days right
[1:21:14] come on are you with me we have days
[1:21:16] that we are discouraged we have days
[1:21:18] that we are overjoyed
[1:21:20] but my brother and sister the joy of the
[1:21:22] soul
[1:21:24] the joy of the soul let me say that and
[1:21:25] get your attention the joy of the soul
[1:21:29] is not dictated according to the
[1:21:31] temporal things of this life
[1:21:33] the joy of the soul is the steadfast
[1:21:36] realization
[1:21:37] that i belong to jesus christ and
[1:21:40] he belongs to me oh that is a steadfast
[1:21:45] joy
[1:21:46] hallelujah you can be burning money like
[1:21:48] confetti
[1:21:49] you can be having health troubles you
[1:21:51] can have all kinds of things going on
[1:21:53] and when you finally stop to breathe you
[1:21:56] know
[1:21:56] praise the lord i belong to
[1:21:59] him amen i don't belong to the banking

[1:22:13] belong to jesus christ
[1:22:15] oh hallelujah oh what it makes such a
[1:22:19] difference
[1:22:20] for thou hast broken the yoke of his
[1:22:22] burden in the staff
[1:22:24] of his shoulder the rod of his oppressor
[1:22:26] as in the day of midian
[1:22:29] for every battle of the warrior oh i

[1:25:21] increase of his
[1:25:22] leadership see you can have government
[1:25:25] that
[1:25:25] doesn't have leadership think natural
[1:25:29] united states the year 2020
[1:25:32] you can have government with no
[1:25:34] leadership
[1:25:36] but look what he's speaking here of the

[1:25:39] government leadership and peace there

[1:25:49] you guys have all played jungle
[1:25:52] you know what i'm talking about the
[1:25:54] little wood blocks that are crisscrossed
[1:25:56] and you sit there and you pull one out
[1:25:58] here and your opponent pulls one out
[1:26:00] here and you pull one out here and you
[1:26:01] pull one out there
[1:26:02] you pull one out over here and pretty
[1:26:05] soon
[1:26:05] there's nowhere to go but down
[1:26:10] because it comes to the place there's no
[1:26:12] other
[1:26:13] little jungle stick to pull out
[1:26:17] and you know i've i used to like to play
[1:26:19] that
[1:26:20] until even my grandkids and others would
[1:26:24] whip me time after time i gave up
[1:26:28] because you see it comes to a time that
[1:26:32] this scripture must be fulfilled
[1:26:36] wouldn't it be easier just to stop and
[1:26:38] say let's our government no one do
[1:26:39] nothing say nothing
[1:26:41] nothing else happen but you can't
[1:26:45] the spirit of the age prophecy of the
[1:26:48] word
[1:26:50] says the next play
[1:26:53] must be played
[1:26:57] and you start tugging and it wobbles try
[1:27:00] another one
[1:27:00] tug wobbles pretty soon
[1:27:04] there's nothing you can do but pull it
[1:27:07] out
[1:27:08] and watch it fall hallelujah had no idea
[1:27:12] jungle was a spiritual
[1:27:14] thing was did you it is it types it
[1:27:17] types spiritual things perfectly
[1:27:19] hallelujah it's a game of tearing down
[1:27:22] not building up
[1:27:24] but the scripture prophecy for this
[1:27:26] world my brother and sister
[1:27:27] removes everything until the prophecy
[1:27:29] comes to pass
[1:27:31] of the increase of his government peace
[1:27:32] there shall be no end never stop upon
[1:27:34] the throne of david upon his kingdom
[1:27:36] to order it to establish it with
[1:27:38] judgment and with justice
[1:27:39] from henceforth even forever the zeal
[1:27:43] of the lord of hosts will perform this
[1:27:47] oh hallelujah i'll tell you i just felt
[1:27:50] like the lord was just kind of kind to
[1:27:52] me and that just reached out
[1:27:53] as i was studying this it just reached
[1:27:55] out and grabbed me the zeal
[1:27:56] you know saints i shared with the young
[1:27:58] people a little bit about
[1:28:00] music and how it affects people and
[1:28:01] whatnot but i i can just relate to you
[1:28:04] as a young man
[1:28:05] i was just totally zealous about riding
[1:28:07] a dirt bike i was serious i
[1:28:09] i had bodily injury i had different
[1:28:11] things you'd think man you're crazy you
[1:28:13] know
[1:28:14] dislocated ankles and knees and elbows
[1:28:16] and shoulders and broken collar bones
[1:28:18] and
[1:28:19] all of this stuff and as soon as you're
[1:28:20] healthy go do it again
[1:28:22] so you know i i think i understand what
[1:28:24] it is to be zealous about
[1:28:26] something and so you look at this and
[1:28:28] realize my brother and sister
[1:28:30] the uh definition amen webster online
[1:28:33] a strong feeling of interest and
[1:28:35] enthusiasm for makes someone
[1:28:37] very eager or determined to do something
[1:28:41] eagerness and ardent interest in pursuit
[1:28:44] of something
[1:28:45] fervor fervor amen
[1:28:48] synonym passion
[1:28:54] you know how much god wants you to make
[1:28:55] the rapture can anybody give me an idea
[1:28:59] amen we don't even have a way to measure
[1:29:02] it
[1:29:02] amen what we would measure as zeal what
[1:29:05] we would look at and say oh the passion
[1:29:08] they talked about the passion of christ
[1:29:10] they made a movie about it
[1:29:11] we as human in our element don't even
[1:29:15] know
[1:29:15] the zeal of god we don't know the
[1:29:18] passion of god
[1:29:19] we can't understand we can't think in
[1:29:21] that broad of terms amen
[1:29:24] so all that is brought out in this
[1:29:26] prophecy of our lord jesus christ
[1:29:29] amen when that anointing come he closed
[1:29:31] it out the zeal of the lord of hosts
[1:29:34] will perform this oh i'll tell you what
[1:29:37] my brother and sister
[1:29:38] how much we could just put it in our
[1:29:40] human terms amen how much the zeal of
[1:29:43] god would come down it would stir your
[1:29:45] heart
[1:29:46] it would turn your life upside down it
[1:29:48] would remove
[1:29:49] obstacles it would want god wants you to
[1:29:51] go another direction
[1:29:53] he locks the door how many have been
[1:29:55] there before
[1:29:56] amen there was a time of my life i
[1:29:58] wanted to be right
[1:29:59] i wanted to do the things of god but i
[1:30:01] didn't quite have the willpower
[1:30:03] poor sister jerry had to live with me in
[1:30:05] that season and i can tell you it wasn't
[1:30:07] a very
[1:30:08] happy time in the household but i'll
[1:30:10] tell you what god did
[1:30:11] because i wouldn't listen to him he just
[1:30:13] simply locked the door
[1:30:15] blew up the bridges
[1:30:19] and i come to the bridge and it's
[1:30:20] nothing but smoldering ashes
[1:30:22] and i'm like well i got a choice now i
[1:30:24] guess i have to go this way or this way
[1:30:26] i start to go this way i can't get the
[1:30:28] door open
[1:30:30] i guess i'll go this way you know my
[1:30:32] brother and sister i'll tell you i
[1:30:33] didn't stop and think lord what is your
[1:30:35] will
[1:30:36] thy will be done i was just going
[1:30:40] i was just going going going going going
[1:30:43] faster the better partly because you see
[1:30:46] i didn't
[1:30:47] want to look back at what i'd left
[1:30:50] behind me
[1:30:50] that's called carnage
[1:30:54] so i just ran forward but they
[1:30:58] that weighed upon the lord
[1:31:03] shall do what renew their strength
[1:31:08] don't run to your weary don't run until
[1:31:11] you've collapsed don't run until there's
[1:31:12] not an open door and not hardly a bit of
[1:31:14] life left in you and then you say oh
[1:31:16] lord
[1:31:17] why stop
[1:31:20] wait on the lord if the door's locked
[1:31:24] stop and say lord is the door locked
[1:31:26] forever
[1:31:28] or is it locked for a season or a reason
[1:31:32] lord the bridge just burnt down lord
[1:31:36] i'm going to believe that you either
[1:31:38] want me to build a bridge by your word
[1:31:40] and that was satan or i want you to
[1:31:42] reveal to me lord

[1:34:08] quotes if you think brother paul's been
[1:34:09] kind of harsh lately

[1:34:51] hosts my brother and sister
[1:34:53] what is the zeal god's desire
[1:34:57] lord thy will be done the zeal
[1:35:00] titus 2 14 let's just give a little
[1:35:02] reference there
[1:35:04] who gave himself for us talking for our
[1:35:06] lord jesus christ
[1:35:07] that he might redeem us from all
[1:35:09] iniquity not most inequity
[1:35:11] not some iniquity not the iniquity we
[1:35:13] want to get rid of
[1:35:15] all iniquity and purify unto himself
[1:35:18] a peculiar people zealous
[1:35:22] of good works their whole desire their
[1:35:25] motivation
[1:35:26] what grips them oh hallelujah can i
[1:35:29] emphasize this enough
[1:35:30] a strong feeling of interest and
[1:35:33] enthusiasm that makes someone very
[1:35:35] eager and determined
[1:35:38] to do good works but yet we're not
[1:35:41] talking
[1:35:42] works gospel right but the gospel in you
[1:35:45] will bring about good works hallelujah
[1:35:49] oh come on we're preaching about light
[1:35:52] in the valley
[1:35:53] saints we're talking about down in the
[1:35:55] where the dry ditches were according to
[1:35:57] scripture
[1:35:58] we're down amen where the amalekites and
[1:36:00] the midianites and everybody else hung
[1:36:02] out
[1:36:07] and you can live in laodicea and do good
[1:36:10] works
[1:36:12] well i don't need an excuse about how
[1:36:15] the lord knows my heart
[1:36:17] why don't your heart show on the outside
[1:36:19] because the scripture says from the
[1:36:21] abundance of your
[1:36:22] heart you speak amen now i'm being
[1:36:25] presumptuous okay just forgive me here
[1:36:27] but if you can from the abundance of
[1:36:29] your heart speak
[1:36:30] then i believe it's possible from the
[1:36:32] abundance of your heart
[1:36:34] to live
[1:36:41] but i make mistakes yeah
[1:36:44] there was only one perfect one
[1:36:47] hallelujah
[1:36:48] but what is the heart doing amen the
[1:36:51] heart always
[1:36:52] takes you back to an altar the heart
[1:36:54] always takes you back to the light
[1:36:57] the heart draws you into the presence of
[1:37:00] god
[1:37:01] can someone say thank you lord the heart
[1:37:04] my brother and sister
[1:37:05] because the word is in our heart he
[1:37:08] wrote it on the table of our heart
[1:37:10] hallelujah
[1:37:11] so i don't have to have a book i don't
[1:37:13] have to have nothing
[1:37:14] he wrote it on the table of my heart and
[1:37:16] if you end up in a prison somewhere
[1:37:18] you know i just uh some brothers well
[1:37:20] you know some some people have just
[1:37:23] unique ideas
[1:37:24] and it could be true i don't know i'm
[1:37:25] not speaking down on them but we got
[1:37:27] some brothers around the message
[1:37:29] that think one of them uh you know camps
[1:37:31] that they fenced in areas they found way
[1:37:33] up in the wilderness in
[1:37:34] in alaska is is for us
[1:37:40] yeah yeah that's they're going to hurt
[1:37:42] us all together and they're going to
[1:37:43] haul us up in the middle of the
[1:37:44] wilderness throw us in one of those
[1:37:46] camps
[1:37:48] okay
[1:37:55] it's not what the word says
[1:37:58] not what the prophet said that's right
[1:38:07] when this life is over i'm going
[1:38:11] to a camp in alaska
[1:38:20] no no amen
[1:38:24] you see you might come to that
[1:38:26] conclusion if down in the valley
[1:38:28] under that shadow it's hard to read
[1:38:32] because there's not enough light amen
[1:38:34] right
[1:38:35] what does it say
[1:38:38] step out in the light amen go till you
[1:38:41] find the light
[1:38:42] amen what does it show you then
[1:38:46] a little bit different story my brother
[1:38:48] and sister
[1:38:49] reminds me of an old grandfather he was
[1:38:51] getting quite aged had cataracts
[1:38:54] refused he said i'm too old to go do
[1:38:55] that surgery stuff i don't want to go
[1:38:57] through it
[1:38:58] and so his grandkids he would sit there
[1:39:03] and he would read stories to his
[1:39:04] grandkids
[1:39:06] and he would share this story and his
[1:39:09] grandkids oh grandpa thank you for
[1:39:11] reading but his grandkids are getting
[1:39:13] older
[1:39:14] and older they're starting to learn
[1:39:16] their alphabet and they're starting to
[1:39:17] learn
[1:39:18] words and one day his grandson gets up
[1:39:21] after grandpa's read a book to him
[1:39:23] and he goes in the kitchen to his mama
[1:39:25] is this mama
[1:39:27] what does this book really say
[1:39:33] and grandpa had to admit sweethearts
[1:39:36] ever since i held you
[1:39:38] i've just made the stories up papa bear
[1:39:41] and mama bear and the big bad wolf and
[1:39:44] the sheep and the pigs and everything
[1:39:46] because you see i couldn't read
[1:39:50] and another year goes by and grandpa's
[1:39:53] still reading stories to the kids and
[1:39:54] the kids have now come to realization
[1:39:56] grandpa just makes him up as he goes
[1:39:58] but god laid something an anointing on
[1:40:00] his grandson
[1:40:01] and he comes up to grandpa one day
[1:40:04] and he says grandpa would you go have
[1:40:06] eye surgery and he goes oh i'm too
[1:40:08] old for that he goes no you don't
[1:40:09] understand grandpa
[1:40:11] i don't need you to get eye surgery for
[1:40:14] you
[1:40:15] right i need you to get eye surgery
[1:40:18] for me because grandpa
[1:40:22] i want to know the true story amen
[1:40:26] you see saints just assuming what it
[1:40:28] meant
[1:40:29] making it up as we go amen why
[1:40:33] it's darkness you can't read in the
[1:40:36] darkness
[1:40:37] amen you know it's an old wives tale we
[1:40:39] tell our children
[1:40:41] don't read in the dark it'll make your
[1:40:42] eyes bad i tried that on aliyah here
[1:40:45] recently and she just looked at me and
[1:40:46] went
[1:40:49] you know after a while because you see
[1:40:53] as they come of age i'm going somewhere
[1:40:55] with this
[1:40:56] honestly there's a point
[1:40:59] as they come of age
[1:41:02] parents church preachers elders
[1:41:07] our children start to read for
[1:41:09] themselves
[1:41:10] but not everything's on the written page
[1:41:13] they learn
[1:41:14] to read what's right and wrong
[1:41:18] what's honest what's fair they learn to
[1:41:21] read
[1:41:22] our natures they learn to read all kinds
[1:41:24] of things
[1:41:26] amen if we've been reading out of the
[1:41:28] darkness come on church
[1:41:30] if we've been reading out of the
[1:41:31] darkness one day our children will
[1:41:34] realize
[1:41:35] we've been making up the story
[1:41:38] we're here in the light it's the valley
[1:41:41] we don't need to make it up it's real
[1:41:44] god's present
[1:41:45] god's here he's still saving he's still
[1:41:47] healing
[1:41:48] he's still delivering he's still giving
[1:41:50] the holy ghost we don't need to make up
[1:41:52] a story
[1:41:53] we don't have to come up with a fairy
[1:41:55] tale or something that would would
[1:41:57] attract them because you see sooner or
[1:41:59] later they will come to the place they
[1:42:00] can read the story for themselves
[1:42:02] and if our story and the real story
[1:42:04] don't match
[1:42:10] let's not fall into this category right
[1:42:12] here okay would you agree
[1:42:14] with me you haven't even read it yet but
[1:42:15] let's not fall into this category can
[1:42:16] you trust me
[1:42:17] hey man we don't want to fall in this
[1:42:19] category right here
[1:42:21] now we notice these things trouble comes
[1:42:23] up all at once
[1:42:24] oh the devil looked over and said uh-huh
[1:42:26] they've gone off on a tantrum
[1:42:29] i want to be in a tantrum this kind of
[1:42:31] tantrum yeah
[1:42:34] they're just out there jumping up and
[1:42:35] down shouting having a big time
[1:42:37] you know what right now is my time to
[1:42:38] think them i'll get even with them now
[1:42:41] so he raised up over the hill and began
[1:42:43] to blow his poisonous breath
[1:42:46] days of miracles has passed after all i
[1:42:48] believe these people are just
[1:42:49] nervous i think they ought to have a
[1:42:51] mental test before they go to the
[1:42:53] foreign fields
[1:42:58] remember the prophet of god met them
[1:43:00] young people
[1:43:01] over in africa they'd been there for
[1:43:04] months
[1:43:05] and led a single person to the lord
[1:43:11] go look it up see what the prophet of
[1:43:12] god said about it
[1:43:15] he said you ought not even be there
[1:43:16] unless you've got the holy ghost
[1:43:19] don't even go and play on that field
[1:43:21] because it's a rough playing field
[1:43:23] yeah gospel rugby
[1:43:26] hallelujah in an age where more and more
[1:43:29] people are out there in their creased
[1:43:30] pants and their little polo shirt
[1:43:32] hitting a golf ball no
[1:43:33] no slight to anyone who plays golf but
[1:43:35] we're talking in the age of that
[1:43:38] you've still got these people that play
[1:43:41] rugby
[1:43:43] sister jerry's got a cousin jeff
[1:43:47] quite good went on to coach or is
[1:43:49] coaching a rugby team that's
[1:43:51] traveled the world because of their
[1:43:53] abilities
[1:43:55] but jeff has scars
[1:43:58] his one lips all mangled right here what
[1:44:00] happened oh
[1:44:02] i dove on a ball and got cleated oh wow
[1:44:05] did you have to go to the hospital for
[1:44:06] that no i finished the game
[1:44:10] wow why would you do that what do you
[1:44:11] mean we were winning
[1:44:15] what's his scar here what's this car
[1:44:16] pull up his shirt
[1:44:18] big scar on his back what happened there
[1:44:20] well this is what happened there
[1:44:23] wow why did you do that i love it
[1:44:29] contrary to the guy with the creased
[1:44:41] this just doesn't feel right
[1:44:44] put mr rugby and mr golfer in the same
[1:44:47] room
[1:44:49] see who comes out we're in warfare
[1:44:54] hallelujah we're not here this doesn't
[1:44:56] feel right
[1:44:58] we're here i don't care i'm winning
[1:45:03] oh excuse me i'm off on a tangent
[1:45:06] now hey they've gone off on a tantrum
[1:45:09] jumping up and down shouting having a
[1:45:11] big time you know what right now is my
[1:45:13] time to sink them i'll i'll get even
[1:45:15] with them now so he raised up over the
[1:45:16] hill and began to blow his poisoned
[1:45:18] breath whoo
[1:45:19] the days of miracles has passed after
[1:45:20] all believe these people are just
[1:45:22] nervous
[1:45:23] i think they ought to have a mental test
[1:45:24] before they take the foreign fields
[1:45:26] pentecostals uh-huh see his poison
[1:45:29] breath killing the word
[1:45:30] oh i think it's something else i believe
[1:45:32] it see going
[1:45:33] right straight back like all the rest of
[1:45:36] the denominations did
[1:45:37] just exactly the road they're walking
[1:45:40] now it kills it the very hour you
[1:45:43] organize it
[1:45:44] that kills it it always has
[1:45:47] it always will it will never rise again
[1:45:51] amen now saints you know i just reading
[1:45:54] this morning now pardon me that somebody
[1:45:55] will probably not like this but
[1:45:56] sorry uh you know the prophet of god as
[1:45:59] i was reading there
[1:46:00] and uh church ages and he says now let
[1:46:02] me put in a word for my ministry
[1:46:05] well that must have been a turn off to a
[1:46:06] lot of people here he is taught in his
[1:46:08] deal
[1:46:09] but you see my brother and sister the
[1:46:10] prophet of god many times said you know
[1:46:12] i don't have a ministry jesus christ has
[1:46:14] got a ministry
[1:46:15] amen so let me just put a word in for my
[1:46:17] ministry
[1:46:18] amen that you will look here and my
[1:46:21] brother and sister as long as i have
[1:46:23] breath in my body and you have
[1:46:24] confidence in me
[1:46:26] this church will never take the path
[1:46:28] where it falls down and never
[1:46:30] rises again you can drag my carcass out
[1:46:34] throw it in the parking lot you can do
[1:46:36] whatever you can silence my voice you
[1:46:37] can bring gorilla tape and gorilla glue
[1:46:40] but as long as i've got lungs and i've
[1:46:42] got a voice i will not
[1:46:44] allow this church to go the route we
[1:46:46] become dead
[1:46:48] hallelujah amen but the spirit's there
[1:46:51] it wants us to become dead it wants to
[1:46:53] subdue
[1:46:54] us it wants to hog tie us but my brother
[1:46:56] and sister someone's going to stand up
[1:46:58] but let's just go beyond that because
[1:47:00] what prophet of god is talking about
[1:47:02] nicolaitan spirits
[1:47:03] he's talking about how my brother and
[1:47:05] sister that the nicole attender ministry
[1:47:07] leadership conquered the laity the
[1:47:09] people but look i want to remind you
[1:47:12] this just a reminder
[1:47:13] that the people won't be conquered
[1:47:15] unless they allow it
[1:47:17] as long as the people are in the word
[1:47:20] seven days a week
[1:47:22] amen and they've risen up into that
[1:47:24] plateau as it were not plateau but that
[1:47:27] mountaintop
[1:47:28] where they're in the word the word is in
[1:47:29] them it's life you
[1:47:31] will never be conquered by a nicolaitan
[1:47:34] spirit
[1:47:34] because you will look at that and say
[1:47:36] that doesn't line up
[1:47:38] i can't accept that amen but it's when
[1:47:42] the people lay down
[1:47:44] but did you know i want to give equal
[1:47:45] blame where equal blame is due
[1:47:47] that it's actually the people who
[1:47:48] conquer themselves
[1:47:51] because did you know when that first
[1:47:53] little weed of that spirit stuck its
[1:47:55] head up
[1:47:56] we had a choice to root it out
[1:48:00] or be kind because the prophet of god
[1:48:02] said we needed unity
[1:48:04] so i'm going to have unity with this
[1:48:07] thistle
[1:48:13] i'm going to have unity
[1:48:16] with this wolf
[1:48:19] because i read in the scripture at one
[1:48:21] point the wolf's going to lay down with
[1:48:22] the lamb
[1:48:23] and we're just working on bringing that
[1:48:25] together
[1:48:30] okay i'm over my grumpiness we'll move
[1:48:32] on
[1:48:35] it'll never rise again it's never been
[1:48:37] known in history in this lasting church
[1:48:39] age christ was on the outside of the
[1:48:41] church knocking trying to get in
[1:48:43] they just can't stand it they can't
[1:48:45] listen
[1:48:46] to it so you know what
[1:48:49] if they don't want to listen to it
[1:48:51] they'll first try to get you
[1:48:53] to change your vocabulary
[1:49:01] my that was pointed paul
[1:49:07] see they just can't stand it can't
[1:49:09] listen to it now we find the hour we're
[1:49:11] living
[1:49:12] trouble is set in and then we begin to
[1:49:14] find out miracles
[1:49:16] isn't taking place no more like they
[1:49:19] were
[1:49:20] come on that's right i'm not preaching
[1:49:22] down to you church
[1:49:24] this is what we don't want to become
[1:49:26] this
[1:49:27] is what we are becoming the anti-type of
[1:49:30] right the opposite of make sure i make
[1:49:33] clarity there
[1:49:34] the miracles isn't taking place no more
[1:49:36] like they were the six
[1:49:38] go home sick it isn't because of god
[1:49:42] now i've heard people around what we
[1:49:45] believe well you know god's just not
[1:49:46] moving like he said no i'm sorry
[1:49:48] i hold this quote up in defense of that
[1:49:51] amen
[1:49:52] it isn't because of god it's because of
[1:49:54] the lack of revival among the people
[1:49:57] there is no revival now i hope this
[1:50:00] isn't any of you
[1:50:01] they sit and listen and go home and say
[1:50:04] well
[1:50:05] i guess that was pretty good uh-huh
[1:50:18] now if you've done that or maybe you're
[1:50:21] even doing it right now
[1:50:24] repent amen
[1:50:28] well god's not really moving i'm just
[1:50:29] not really having an interest to go to
[1:50:31] church because god's not really moving
[1:50:32] and the pastor is to blame hallelujah
[1:50:36] the pastors to blame i'll be along with
[1:50:37] my
[1:50:41] breaching tool and come to your house
[1:50:44] see you this afternoon if i'm to blame
[1:50:47] because you see
[1:50:48] i want to fix what i'm not doing right
[1:50:51] in your house hallelujah and i've got a
[1:50:55] big old dump trailer so all i got to do
[1:50:56] is get it out the door
[1:50:58] throw it in there if i'm to blame
[1:51:02] oh come on saints someone smile at me
[1:51:05] please
[1:51:07] wait ain't nobody to blame
[1:51:11] for the condition of this house
[1:51:15] but the operator or owner
[1:51:18] of this house yeah i quit serving god
[1:51:22] because the pastor of that church i went
[1:51:24] to
[1:51:25] really what a cough out amen what a
[1:51:28] cough out
[1:51:28] you wouldn't let the pastor come and fix
[1:51:30] it
[1:51:32] why would you blame him for it amen
[1:51:35] praise the lord i'm a great fixer honest
[1:51:38] at least i'm good at starting projects
[1:51:46] the six go home sick it isn't because of
[1:51:49] god it's because of the lack of revival
[1:51:50] among people
[1:51:51] there's no revival they sit and listen
[1:51:53] go home and say well i guess that was
[1:51:55] pretty good
[1:51:55] see they're not even confirmed it was
[1:51:57] good or bad
[1:51:59] i want to use this as a lead-in to what
[1:52:00] the lord i think is laid on my heart for
[1:52:02] this next sunday
[1:52:04] well i guess it's pretty good you see
[1:52:07] they're not committed
[1:52:10] they're not hot that was good they're
[1:52:14] not cold
[1:52:14] it was a waste of my time there
[1:52:21] lukewarm
[1:52:25] anyway i know it's hard in a message
[1:52:27] church to talk about three kinds of
[1:52:28] believers
[1:52:33] i guess that was pretty good uh-huh see
[1:52:35] there's not that zeal
[1:52:38] as we leave church today the brothers
[1:52:40] will meet you in the hallway and we have
[1:52:43] six cc's of zeal for each one of you it
[1:52:46] stings a little bit as it goes in your
[1:52:48] left arm but you'll appreciate it later
[1:52:52] don't you wish it was that easy brothers
[1:52:55] preachers don't you wish to is that easy
[1:52:58] i i cringe at a needle but i could get
[1:53:00] used to it to give somebody a little
[1:53:02] zeal
[1:53:03] hallelujah you know
[1:53:09] yeah you think there's something wrong
[1:53:11] with me you know back when i worked on a
[1:53:13] cattle ranch
[1:53:14] i got injected with just about
[1:53:15] everything we injected cattle they jerk
[1:53:17] their heads they jump and bash around
[1:53:19] the chute
[1:53:19] next thing and go i've just been
[1:53:21] dewormed
[1:53:24] oh no now i don't have to worry about
[1:53:25] getting black leg
[1:53:28] oh i don't have to worry about getting
[1:53:29] wooden tongue
[1:53:32] huh brother ivan would you prepare the
[1:53:36] tray and the needles
[1:53:41] see there's not that zeal there's not
[1:53:44] something in the people that should be
[1:53:46] there
[1:53:47] sister emmy so i'll quit preaching
[1:53:49] halfway on time here would you come
[1:53:52] hallelujah look saints
[1:53:56] my personal desire that's all i can
[1:53:58] speak of is the lord i want to be
[1:54:00] zealous
[1:54:01] i want to be on fire for you but only
[1:54:04] you can speak
[1:54:05] those words but i can assure you
[1:54:08] if you will allow it you'll find there's
[1:54:12] a lot of light
[1:54:13] in the valley you don't have to be
[1:54:15] lukewarm
[1:54:17] you don't have to let one single thing
[1:54:19] be a barrier
[1:54:21] to your life do you realize satan now
[1:54:23] the prophet of god said satan will kick
[1:54:25] he'll he'll put logs and rocks and
[1:54:27] sticks and all kinds of things in your
[1:54:29] pathway
[1:54:30] to get you to stumble the only way
[1:54:33] you'll stumble over those is if you
[1:54:35] decide
[1:54:36] there's not enough light in your valley
[1:54:38] in other words saints almost say one
[1:54:40] last blunt statement and then we're
[1:54:41] going to sing a few songs
[1:54:44] you will decide whether you
[1:54:47] want to be zealous or not i don't care
[1:54:51] what
[1:54:51] your excuses
[1:54:54] [Music]
[1:54:56] the same amount of energy
[1:54:59] physical and mental it takes to decide
[1:55:03] there's a discouragement and obstacle in
[1:55:06] your life the same amount of physical
[1:55:08] and mental energy
[1:55:09] will decide that you can speak up and
[1:55:11] say
[1:55:12] that won't stop me it's all comes down
[1:55:15] that simple
[1:55:17] how much light is in the valley more
[1:55:19] than enough
[1:55:21] for us to walk the length and the breath
[1:55:24] of the valley amen don't tell
[1:55:27] god amen this isn't a quarrel between
[1:55:30] paul and you
[1:55:32] this is not a quarrel between you and
[1:55:33] the message
[1:55:35] are you and the prophet this is a
[1:55:37] quarrel between you and the devil
[1:55:42] will i or won't i can i or can't i
[1:55:46] do i want to or not make up your mind
[1:55:50] make up your mind the lights here in the
[1:55:53] valley

[1:55:57] to finish the race

[1:56:37] it doesn't destroy it
[1:56:40] and they clocked him on the final
[1:56:41] stretch to the finish line
[1:56:43] going like 160 miles an hour
[1:56:46] on the rim
[1:56:50] afterwards they said wasn't that a
[1:56:51] little dangerous he said are you kidding

[1:58:03] be for me
[1:58:04] let me let me receive whatever it was
[1:58:08] he wandered on both sides of his topic
[1:58:10] and got sidetracked and i just got lost
[1:58:12] lord forgive me
[1:58:13] but if it was for me i'm here lord i
[1:58:16] just receive it
[1:58:18] don't judge what god's doing for you by
[1:58:20] the man behind this pulpit
[1:58:22] don't judge by the person down the pew
[1:58:25] from you or the one in the back
[1:58:26] don't judge by those things saints judge
[1:58:29] by
[1:58:29] opening yourself and saying lord speak
[1:58:32] to me there's light lord you promised i
[1:58:35] read the scriptures today that brother
[1:58:37] paul brought
[1:58:38] there's light in my valley oh

[1:58:45] that light hallelujah after all if i
[1:58:48] could get you in the rapture

[1:59:07] talking about the prophet john
[1:59:09] and all that god promised as god is
[1:59:12] speaking forth zacharias
[1:59:14] filled with the holy ghost starts to
[1:59:15] prophesy amen
[1:59:18] oh let's go to verse 74 just
[1:59:24] to shorten this up that he would grant
[1:59:26] unto
[1:59:27] us that we being delivered out of the
[1:59:30] hand of our enemies
[1:59:31] might serve him without fear amen
[1:59:35] that's what god's calling us to do serve
[1:59:37] him without any
[1:59:39] kind of fear the fear
[1:59:42] of help or the fear of being lost
[1:59:47] or the fear of whatever satan would try
[1:59:50] to anoint you with
[1:59:51] no fear to serve him without fear

[2:01:13] further
[2:01:16] god calls me back i marry a lovely woman
[2:01:20] young girl 17 years old made a decision
[2:01:25] she'd trust me i wasn't trustworthy
[2:01:27] [Music]

[2:01:32] life
[2:01:34] things start to happen but not all of
[2:01:35] that was good because you see i was
[2:01:37] rebellious
[2:01:38] and when god said i want you to do this
[2:01:40] i said i ain't doing that
[2:01:42] and life got worse
[2:01:43] [Music]
[2:01:49] one day light
[2:01:52] came to my valley it didn't matter that
[2:01:56] this brother had light in his valley and
[2:01:57] sister had light in their valley but one
[2:01:59] day light
[2:02:01] came to my valley
[2:02:05] oh can someone say thank you
[2:02:08] lord
[2:02:10] [Music]
[2:02:11] anyway back to the book
[2:02:15] you know what you're going to find when
[2:02:16] you look in the book
[2:02:20] hallelujah is it all right to act like a
[2:02:22] little pentecostal here
[2:02:24] hallelujah all you're gonna find in that
[2:02:27] book is he served me
[2:02:29] all the days of his life
[2:02:33] there's no dark stain there's no
[2:02:35] ugliness there's no record there's
[2:02:37] nothing
[2:02:38] there he says he was my son
[2:02:41] from the beginning to the end but there
[2:02:44] is no
[2:02:44] end so he's been my son for eternity
[2:02:48] oh hallelujah eternity saints
[2:02:52] that's what the book says oh
[2:02:56] we've got something something
[2:02:59] to give light to them that sit in
[2:03:01] darkness in the shadow of death
[2:03:03] to guide our feet into the way
[2:03:07] of peace thank you lord
[2:03:10] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:03:14] my i got more scripture and i've got
[2:03:16] more quotes one more quote can i read
[2:03:18] one more quote
[2:03:20] i'm telling you the truth i shrunk the
[2:03:22] plate down it looks like a dime
[2:03:29] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[2:03:35] just the title alone ought to get us
[2:03:38] excited
[2:03:39] now here's one thing that i've found the
[2:03:41] people
[2:03:43] [Music]
[2:03:44] what does this say living
[2:03:48] faith see you can't get
[2:03:52] living faith from dead letter
[2:03:56] and living faith will not produce dead
[2:03:58] letter
[2:04:00] but here's one thing that i found the
[2:04:01] people with a living faith but
[2:04:03] they have absolutely caught a hold of
[2:04:05] something
[2:04:08] god out there that gives them a new
[2:04:10] birth that puts god
[2:04:11] into the person now that's
[2:04:15] difficult one right there my brother and
[2:04:16] sister because if people don't have an
[2:04:18] understanding of the godhead
[2:04:19] they're going to take the holy ghost and
[2:04:21] put him right out here and put him in a
[2:04:23] position
[2:04:23] and put him in a position put him
[2:04:24] position and when the prophet of god
[2:04:27] come along and said now it wasn't the
[2:04:28] first person
[2:04:29] and it wasn't the second person it
[2:04:31] wasn't the third person it was god
[2:04:32] himself
[2:04:35] some people go hmm that can't be right
[2:04:38] but you see
[2:04:39] [Music]
[2:04:42] they miss this part that puts god into
[2:04:45] the purpose
[2:04:46] no no brother paul that's the holy ghost
[2:04:48] go see what the prophet god said
[2:04:50] he said it's all god whatever office he
[2:04:53] is there
[2:04:54] in morphe he puts on the mask he changes
[2:04:56] the mask
[2:04:57] he's in the play he comes in a different
[2:04:59] way in a different season in a different
[2:05:01] time
[2:05:02] it's all god hallelujah
[2:05:06] oh god amen
[2:05:09] that makes him that puts god into the
[2:05:11] person
[2:05:12] that makes him hmm maketh
[2:05:15] maketh huh you realize
[2:05:21] same word this extended
[2:05:25] all those english people all you people
[2:05:27] understand that you know you
[2:05:28] ones that can write out what a noun and
[2:05:30] pronoun an adjective
[2:05:31] amen i was in school i told the teacher
[2:05:33] i understand what being an agitator is
[2:05:35] she said not an agitator paul an
[2:05:37] adjective
[2:05:38] [Music]
[2:05:44] gives him a new birth that puts god in
[2:05:46] the person makes him believe in the
[2:05:47] supernatural
[2:05:48] now if you're not born again you do not
[2:05:50] believe in the supernatural and if you
[2:05:52] do not believe in the supernatural you
[2:05:54] haven't been born again that's boy
[2:05:55] that's
[2:05:56] i think he made his point because when
[2:05:58] you're born again you become a son of
[2:05:59] god
[2:06:00] and he will being a son of god your
[2:06:02] nature of god
[2:06:05] now saints if any of you got a buzz saw
[2:06:08] nature here today
[2:06:10] come on i'm not stepping on your toes i
[2:06:12] step between your toes
[2:06:14] that means i got really close to you if
[2:06:15] i stood between your toes
[2:06:18] if you got a buzz saw in nature here
[2:06:20] today don't let the devil fool you
[2:06:23] that everything's okay that you can have
[2:06:25] the holy ghost and a buzz saw nature
[2:06:28] come on saints i love you i'm not
[2:06:31] speaking ill of you
[2:06:33] just recognize if you got a buzz on
[2:06:35] nature that you got something to work on
[2:06:38] you got something to go to the altar and
[2:06:40] say god take this
[2:06:42] away from me
[2:06:44] [Music]
[2:06:47] and he will being a son of god your
[2:06:49] nature of god and then you take on the
[2:06:51] things and you want to see the moving of
[2:06:52] god see god move
[2:06:54] because you're his son and you're made
[2:06:56] in his image and you're born of his
[2:06:58] spirit
[2:06:59] you're a part of him oh this last line i
[2:07:03] read all of that to get down to this
[2:07:04] last line
[2:07:05] and those of you that skipped ahead i
[2:07:07] don't know how to stop you from doing
[2:07:09] that
[2:07:10] amen
[2:07:13] and then you've got faith
[2:07:16] for anything not faith for just a
[2:07:19] toothache
[2:07:21] not just faith for this not just faith
[2:07:23] faith for anything
[2:07:24] look i don't care what you face in your
[2:07:26] life when the light has come to the
[2:07:28] valley and god has revealed himself
[2:07:30] completely
[2:07:30] in your darkest hour in the deepest hole
[2:07:34] that you can dig
[2:07:35] for your life god comes right down in
[2:07:37] that my brother and sister he gives you
[2:07:39] a living word
