[10:46] hallelujah amen want to welcome our
[10:49] visitors God bless you amen and
[10:54] uh I I I think that uh sister Rachel
[10:58] you're no longer a visitor so amen we
[11:03] just accept you as our own
[11:06] Hallelujah quite a little list uh
[11:11] I brother Alex like I didn't remember
[11:13] that list well I wouldn't if it wasn't
[11:15] all written out here but uh we just have
[11:17] a lot of needs you know Satan certainly
[11:20] is just rising up uh he he just wants to
[11:23] hinder he wants to discourage cuz he
[11:26] knows if he can discourage us we will
[11:29] not enter into the promise amen that's
[11:33] what happened many of those in the
[11:35] wilderness they had not sinned they had
[11:38] come to a place of discouragement and
[11:41] quit and now you could say they they did
[11:44] sin because unbelief is sin but still it
[11:48] was a discouragement that brought them
[11:50] to a place they listened to many
[11:52] voices uh you know as it was those
[11:55] ministers that were there in in the body
[11:59] of Israel at that time is just the same
[12:02] as today there was people that respected
[12:05] them they had maybe been a benefit to
[12:07] their life and when Dayan stood up and
[12:11] made his statement and Kora backed it up
[12:14] these people come in a quandry just as
[12:16] they have in this day of who do I
[12:20] believe Moses talks of a promise but
[12:23] what we have as a Wilderness Dayan and
[12:25] Kora are telling us the reality of it
[12:30] but we don't live in that reality we
[12:32] live in the promis and so it was in that
[12:35] promise God said look to me in my promis
[12:40] and you know those voices of that day
[12:42] caused many to get discouraged and step
[12:45] away and so we just want to you know our
[12:49] sister April uh without going into
[12:52] detail here uh you know where she's at
[12:55] you know the labor she's doing her heart
[12:57] desire and and uh so we just want to
[13:01] remember her in prayer uh I as I get
[13:04] older you know I I find myself with less
[13:07] concern about words sometimes and you
[13:10] embarrass or maybe put your foot in your
[13:12] mouth but I I I don't want to do that
[13:15] intentionally uh but sister ulia uh soon
[13:20] uh to uh bring forth a baby into the
[13:24] world to deliver a baby let's lift her
[13:26] up in prayer amen we want to just hear
[13:29] this lovely news of um unnamed
[13:35] baby uh coming healthy and uh sister
[13:39] Julia healthy and and brother Sergey I'm
[13:41] on your team I want you to be healthy
[13:44] amen I made the mistake once of making a
[13:47] statement to my wife right after she'd
[13:49] had a baby that it was just as hard on
[13:51] me as it was on her I've never lived
[13:54] that statement down and uh so uh it is
[13:59] and I see somebody laughing over here
[14:01] that just we don't normally do this but
[14:03] I'll just put it this way 40 years ago I
[14:07] became a
[14:09] father
[14:11] yeah yeah
[14:16] 40
[14:18] anyway so anyway let's remember the
[14:22] Saints on the East Coast uh many
[14:25] Believers uh just been tremendously
[14:28] impacted
[14:29] uh Brothers sharing pictures um major
[14:32] highway bridges destroyed and
[14:35] Backcountry Road Bridges completely gone
[14:38] as though there was never an Evidence of
[14:39] of a bridge there ever uh so we want to
[14:43] just remember them not just the
[14:45] Believers but mankind amen are there
[14:48] people are suffering people are dying
[14:50] families are affected and just lift them
[14:53] up before the Lord and this morning um
[14:57] uh we had a wonderful opportunity
[15:00] uh even in the sadness of it to to lay
[15:03] our hands on brother
[15:09] Bob what a paradox of
[15:12] life one of the happiest moments in our
[15:16] lives would be to pass in the presence
[15:18] of God and one of the saddest moments is
[15:22] to see a LED one
[15:24] pass but we were there and and um just
[15:27] had that opportunity I I felt encouraged
[15:30] here's a
[15:31] man that has served
[15:34] God more years than the average man
[15:38] lives think about
[15:40] it what a
[15:42] testimony what a
[15:45] testimony our sister Ruth is there with
[15:47] her grandfather today and so just
[15:49] remember Sister Ruth also
[15:53] now uh we have and it's been mostly Paul
[15:59] looking at too many circumstances but
[16:01] we've always uh in the past tried to do
[16:03] communion on the first Sunday of the
[16:06] month and uh trying to get back on track
[16:09] of that why we chose the sixth but we're
[16:12] going to move that to the 13th because
[16:14] there is uh many families a
[16:19] circumstance uh that they will not be
[16:21] here on the 6th so we're going to move
[16:23] communion to October
[16:25] 13th and uh I I say this with a little
[16:29] humor that is set in stone that one's
[16:32] set in stone so communion 5:00 October
[16:36] 13th here at the church amen hallelujah
[16:39] good to be a Christian amen good to know
[16:42] the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal
[16:44] savior Amen to know that your life is in
[16:47] his hand amen we are secure hallelujah
[16:51] hallelujah let's turn in our Bibles I
[16:54] want to speak to you this morning a a
[16:56] title on the days of The Voice
[16:59] and um it's a a lovely time that we get
[17:02] to just look through the scripture we
[17:05] get to see the day that we're living in
[17:07] my brother and sister if you are living
[17:10] there in in a country uh Ukraine Israel
[17:14] uh the ongoing genocides in Africa and
[17:18] these kind of circumstances you wouldn't
[17:21] think that there would be something to
[17:22] be happy about but the scripture tells
[17:25] us that when we see these signs look
[17:28] look up amen we're not to look down not
[17:32] to be frowning not to be discouraged but
[17:35] that's the time to look up and rejoice
[17:39] because the coming of the Lord is near
[17:41] amen and I we're looking for the coming
[17:44] of the lord we we know it's imminent he
[17:46] promised it he never fails a promise
[17:49] amen Hebrews the 3D chapter verses
[17:52] 1-7 and um just uh trust that today just
[17:57] a little something here might stir the
[17:59] hearts of the people
[18:02] amen Hebrews 3
[18:11] 1-7 I love how the word lays things out
[18:14] the small uh I won't get this correct
[18:17] those of you that you know English makes
[18:20] sense to you um but uh I I just love how
[18:26] the word speaks where
[18:29] therefore holy Brethren amen amen not
[18:33] just a bunch of people assembled in a
[18:35] building calling it church but holy
[18:39] Brethren partakers of the Heavenly
[18:42] calling consider the Apostle and high
[18:45] priest of our profession Christ Jesus
[18:49] who is faithful to him that appointed
[18:51] him as also Moses was faithful in all
[18:55] his house for this man was counted
[18:57] worthy of more Glory than Moses in as
[19:00] much as he who hath builded the house
[19:03] hath more honor than the house see we've
[19:07] seen the skewering of Mankind's thinking
[19:10] today my brother and sister in a world
[19:13] the prophet talked about and said that
[19:16] they're building they're talking about
[19:18] the coming of the Lord and building
[19:19] greater and greater and greater and
[19:22] you'll see this right here the counter
[19:24] type of this that they actually are
[19:26] worshiping what they
[19:29] have built amen not worshiping what God
[19:33] is doing but worshiping what they are
[19:36] doing Lord help us not get caught in
[19:38] that
[19:39] amen
[19:41] and is as much as Heath builded the
[19:44] house hath more honor than the house for
[19:46] every house is builded by some man but
[19:48] he that built all things is God and
[19:51] Moses verily was faithful in all his
[19:53] house as a servant for a testimony of
[19:56] those things which were to be spoken
[19:58] after but Christ as a son over his own
[20:01] house whose
[20:02] house are we amen oh my this house being
[20:06] built right now Hallelujah the finished
[20:09] work the the final touches are are being
[20:12] placed upon this house amen and it's God
[20:16] doing it if we hold fast confidence and
[20:19] the rejoicing of the Hope firm Until the
[20:21] End wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith
[20:24] today if ye will hear his voice amen
[20:28] Heavenly Father we ask for your
[20:30] blessings today in the name of Jesus
[20:32] Christ amen you may be
[20:43] seated I just want to put a a
[20:46] little uh statement for things to come
[20:50] here but you know sometimes as we'll
[20:53] look we'll we'll find that we're we're
[20:55] having a question a little Clarity uh is
[20:58] is always good and uh we have questions
[21:01] and one by one God is answering those
[21:04] questions you know the prophet told us
[21:05] if you would put things on the shelf and
[21:08] leave them there till God chooses to
[21:10] answer it and he is answering one by one
[21:13] and we just look forward as the opening
[21:15] of the word is taking us into the final
[21:17] stretch of time my brother and sister
[21:20] I'm sure that you guys uh uh are aware
[21:22] of that that uh you know Russia Putin
[21:25] said um any country that attacks that is
[21:29] a friend of a country with nuclear power
[21:31] it is considered the same and so we're
[21:34] seeing the bars being removed of of the
[21:37] Restriction as it would be to annihilate
[21:40] mankind it will be that we now consider
[21:43] nuclear weapons as a fair weapon to use
[21:46] in defense and my brother and sister we
[21:49] know that it is total Annihilation it is
[21:51] going to upset the very balance of the
[21:54] earth and and it's there and and we
[21:56] could be so worried about that could
[21:58] look at these things and say uh you know
[22:01] my I'm terrified but my brother and
[22:04] sister it don't matter if you're not
[22:06] here that's
[22:08] right and if we are here you got more to
[22:10] worry about than a nuclear
[22:12] weapon so it's there that we look to the
[22:16] one Refuge that we have and that is our
[22:19] Lord Jesus Christ and when we're in
[22:21] Christ my brother and sister I'm not
[22:23] talking about this natural flesh but
[22:25] when we're in Christ we're balm proof
[22:27] amen amen the the devil can drop every
[22:29] nuclear device that he has he can do
[22:32] everything he can but when we are sealed
[22:34] in Christ Jesus amen he cannot get to
[22:38] you he will not destroy you he can try
[22:42] he can afflict you he can do a lot of
[22:44] things my brother and sister but he's
[22:46] already lost and we say thank you Lord
[22:48] amen so it's there I want to go on into
[22:51] acts 22 and we're talking about the
[22:54] voice and here we're looking at Paul in
[22:58] his journey and starting in verse 7 and
[23:01] he said and I fell into the ground and
[23:03] heard a voice saying unto me Saul Saul
[23:06] why persecutest thou me and I
[23:09] answered see he doesn't even know who
[23:11] he's talking to but there was something
[23:13] there he said who art thou Lord giving
[23:16] preeminence already even though he
[23:18] doesn't know exactly what has happened
[23:21] and he said unto me I am Jesus of
[23:23] Nazareth whom thou persecutest and they
[23:26] that were with me saw saw indeed the
[23:29] light and were afraid but they heard not
[23:32] the voice of him that spake to me oh my
[23:35] brother and sister I hope today we can
[23:37] actually make the emphasis that will
[23:39] touch your heart and I said what shall I
[23:42] do Lord and the Lord said unto me arise
[23:44] and go to Damascus and there it shall be
[23:46] told thee of all the things which are
[23:48] appointed for thee to do you see God
[23:51] already had the list of Paul's future he
[23:55] already had the appointment book had
[23:57] been over opened already and the
[24:00] appointments had been written in the
[24:02] book and and God is now telling him I
[24:05] have this they're going to come and
[24:07] reveal to you of the things you are
[24:10] going to do now my brother and sister I
[24:12] know this is not foreign to us but we
[24:14] are here today and our book has already
[24:17] been appointed amen and we're not
[24:20] looking or hoping I I I read a little
[24:22] deal well I'm just looking and waiting
[24:24] for for what God would write in my book
[24:27] your book is already written amen as
[24:30] Sons and Daughters of God he already
[24:32] knows you he he knows everything about
[24:34] you he's already appointed the time of
[24:37] your birth and he's appointed the time
[24:38] of your death and we say I got saved in
[24:41] this certain year and we understand that
[24:44] but my brother and sister we were in
[24:45] Christ before the foundation of the
[24:47] world there's not a day that I came to
[24:50] him but it was before the foundation of
[24:52] the world how can I write that on a
[24:54] calendar and say I was saved in this day
[24:58] it was manifested in that day but you
[25:00] were already in Christ amen and so you
[25:03] look at this and as Paul is now speaking
[25:06] he's giving this account and I really
[25:08] want to focus there for a moment on
[25:11] verse N9 and they saw the light indeed
[25:14] they saw the light my brother and sister
[25:16] it's easy enough to see the light
[25:19] there's many people they would look and
[25:21] say I acknowledge Jesus Christ as Savior
[25:24] amen I acknowledge Calvary but my
[25:27] brother and sister there was a voice
[25:29] that came with that light and without
[25:31] that voice they had no idea what was
[25:34] going on with Paul amen they saw Paul
[25:37] fall in the dirt blinded they saw Paul
[25:40] there moving entirely from the course
[25:43] that he was in that journey to fulfill
[25:46] he moved he shifted my brotherr entirely
[25:49] and they must have thought what is Paul
[25:51] doing but you see they saw light they
[25:53] saw the gospel as it were they saw all
[25:56] these things they built a church but if
[25:58] the church is not filled amen then it's
[26:02] just a building and so Paul is there and
[26:05] God is speaking to him and Paul makes
[26:07] this acknowledgement in Acts 22 but they
[26:10] heard not the voice of him that spake to
[26:16] me amen aren't you glad today that you
[26:19] can say there's been a voice my brother
[26:21] and sister it's not a voice of this
[26:24] preacher or of that preacher it's not a
[26:27] voice we can say here today and say yes
[26:30] God has sent a messenger into this day
[26:33] my brother and sister but I want to tell
[26:35] you you can hear that voice and you can
[26:39] see light but not hear the voice you
[26:42] need to hear that's it now some people
[26:44] would think that I was on treading on
[26:46] thin ice right there my brother and
[26:48] sister but if everyone had heard the
[26:50] voice was saved today why we'd all have
[26:53] to build a bigger church because there's
[26:55] a lot of people heard the voice but what
[26:57] voice did they here amen if you hear a
[27:00] voice of a man that's good amen it's
[27:02] scriptural the the the five-fold
[27:05] ministry the offices in the church
[27:07] scriptural but if there's not something
[27:09] deeper in there than just hearing that
[27:12] man's voice it has to be that voice that
[27:15] Paul heard amen and acknowledged amen
[27:19] you see you can see the
[27:22] light and have no depth of
[27:26] understanding in other words acknowledge
[27:28] this Bible is true right but no
[27:31] Revelation to live it in hard
[27:33] times no Revelation to live it that's it
[27:37] I'm not talking about the Great
[27:38] Tribulation but no Revelation to live it
[27:40] in
[27:42] Tribulation no Revelation to live it in
[27:46] almost a more difficult
[27:50] time you know what it's almost more
[27:52] difficult than
[27:55] tribulation live it in the time of
[27:58] prosperity that's right exactly right
[28:01] amen amen people call out cry out to God
[28:05] Lord my children are
[28:07] hungry our elders are suffering help us
[28:11] Lord and God come on this scene but
[28:14] where is that voice am when the coffers
[28:17] are full and the food is full and
[28:20] overflowing and prosperity has
[28:22] surrounded us my brother and sister God
[28:25] didn't call the bride of Christ to only
[28:27] hear his voice in in the hard times he
[28:29] called us to hear his voice when we are
[28:33] doing so well financially better than we
[28:36] ever have in our life amen he called for
[28:38] us to still hear that voice amen that's
[28:43] right desperation my brother and sister
[28:45] brings desperation but what does
[28:47] prosperity
[28:51] bring lukewarm Church lukewarm
[28:55] Believers so they see the light but
[28:58] there's no depth of understanding you
[29:00] don't see a one of those
[29:04] called and revealed to them what their
[29:08] calling was amen just
[29:11] Paul amen but they could testify I saw
[29:15] the
[29:16] light and you could create a whole
[29:18] church a whole movement a whole religion
[29:21] out of I saw the light that's it that's
[29:23] exactly right but where's the voice
[29:26] that's it right exactly got to be a
[29:28] voice amen amen because you see when it
[29:32] comes my brother and sister each one
[29:34] could interpret the light according to
[29:36] what they
[29:37] saw some might describe it as a glow
[29:40] some might say it's an orb some might
[29:42] say it's this and say that my brother
[29:44] and sister but when a voice speaks to
[29:46] you that voice speaks to you amen you
[29:50] will know who you are in Jesus Christ
[29:53] amen there'll be no question there won't
[29:55] be no man interpret that to you if it
[29:58] will be God himself interpreting to you
[30:01] his voice calling you amen amen now we
[30:06] live in a day so many voices if you
[30:08] don't think so just go on the
[30:10] internet you know it just do a little
[30:13] bit of research and type in the right
[30:15] words into something like YouTube and
[30:17] they'll come up and there'll be somebody
[30:19] that that um I don't want to go too deep
[30:22] or get negative on that but you know
[30:24] this person will say God spoke to me but
[30:27] everything about their life and their
[30:28] demeanor is contrary to the word that's
[30:31] it right contrary to the voice and they
[30:34] say God spoke to me and revealing and
[30:37] you know what's interesting is when they
[30:39] speak and they say this is going to
[30:41] happen on this day it shakes people up
[30:44] the people listening to that voice get
[30:47] All Shook Up but those days those times
[30:50] those events pass without being
[30:51] fulfilled and nobody they shrug their
[30:56] shoulder because as you see they've saw
[30:58] light but there's no real voice behind
[31:01] it they
[31:03] want they want my brother and sister but
[31:07] can't really understand that's
[31:11] right but there's a still Small Voice
[31:13] that
[31:14] comes that voice doesn't have to quote
[31:16] Doctrine to you it doesn't have to be
[31:18] deep subjects my brother and sister that
[31:21] voice when it just comes in a midnight
[31:23] hour and says you are my own amen amen
[31:28] you're mine I purchased you and there
[31:31] does something that just settles in the
[31:34] heart and soul that when hard times come
[31:37] you can say I Heard a Voice that told me
[31:39] who I am it wasn't the pastor that told
[31:42] me it wasn't the Evangelist that told me
[31:45] it was God himself speaking to me and I
[31:47] know who I am and I will stand amen amen
[31:52] some people say that sounds boastful but
[31:55] my brother and sister when you heard the
[31:57] voice you know you will stand you're not
[32:00] going to falter and fall away you know
[32:03] that it's God dealing with you amen amen
[32:07] there was so many
[32:08] voices they're calling
[32:11] come calling come I've shared it here in
[32:14] the church before down where my son
[32:17] lives my son even though he claims no no
[32:21] real claim to be serving God right now
[32:24] but I tell you what he can't outrun this
[32:27] the scripture that's right he was raised
[32:30] correct that's right it was taught to
[32:32] him it was placed in position in his
[32:35] life and what's amazing to me is he'll
[32:38] tell me on the phone Dad I was talking
[32:41] to this man over here and he made a
[32:43] statement and I said you got a Bible
[32:46] Well no I don't well I've got one on my
[32:47] phone here let me just show you what
[32:50] there the scripture what it really says
[32:53] and and it's interesting right someone
[32:55] who says I I'm not even I'm not really
[32:57] serving God right now you know I know
[32:59] that and I know I should but I'm not and
[33:02] yet something in him will not let uh uh
[33:05] those things that are not true
[33:08] Prevail he has a
[33:11] friend the man attends a mega church
[33:14] when I talk about Mega I'm talking
[33:17] Mega
[33:19] amen and there's lots of attention
[33:22] placed on on churches in Arizona I mean
[33:24] in Texas and what of Mega but these
[33:27] churches are everywhere my brother and
[33:28] sister some just don't want a great
[33:30] profile but you know if you're going to
[33:32] pick a church without knowing the
[33:35] voice then pick one that's got a soccer
[33:37] team a baseball team a basketball team a
[33:40] football team a golf team a tennis
[33:45] team and a dance
[33:48] yeah you see if you're not going to have
[33:50] truth then go for everything that's
[33:53] represented
[33:59] sounds harsh to some doesn't
[34:01] it but find a golf
[34:04] club in the
[34:11] Bible find the evidence of knowing god
[34:14] because you can bowl a perfect 300
[34:19] yeah see none of that is even relevant
[34:22] to the
[34:24] gospel it's just a matter of attraction
[34:29] amen
[34:31] amen I don't want to go down that
[34:34] road but see there's a lot of voices
[34:37] some calling saying come and others
[34:39] saying stay and and voices that approved
[34:42] Paul's persecution of the
[34:45] church and no doubt voices that said
[34:47] Lord why is Paul persecuting us Saul
[34:52] persecuting us but you see one day
[34:54] because God is faithful can someone lift
[34:56] a hand and say because God is faithful I
[35:01] Heard a Voice one day that spoke not to
[35:04] my ears but to my heart and my soul
[35:07] because my God is
[35:10] faithful amen he wouldn't leave us
[35:12] begging bread my brother and sister he
[35:15] wouldn't offer us a stone because he is
[35:18] faithful amen amen and one day because
[35:22] God is faithful he was faithful to Paul
[35:25] but he was being faithful to you and I
[35:28] also because the very gospel that he
[35:31] gave to Paul that changed Paul's life
[35:33] revelated Paul gave Paul a bold approach
[35:36] to preach the gospel under persecution
[35:39] was our gospel my brother and sister and
[35:41] God said I'm faithful to you
[35:45] Generations a on a time down the road
[35:48] I'm faithful to you because I'm going to
[35:50] give you a word that stands this
[35:53] test amen
[35:57] amen but they didn't hear God's words to
[36:04] Paul because they
[36:13] couldn't I want to know does it break
[36:15] your
[36:16] heart when you
[36:18] witness to
[36:20] friends you've known for decades
[36:24] yes and they look you in the face and
[36:26] say you know I've seen you
[36:29] change but I just don't get what you see
[36:34] that's
[36:36] it breaks your
[36:41] heart friends that over time turn maybe
[36:45] a tad bit
[36:49] mocking hey preacher
[36:54] Paul what's happening now
[36:59] well last I knew you had a Bible in your
[37:02] house and I don't want to sound like I'm
[37:04] being mocking but you have a Bible in
[37:07] your house if You' read it you know
[37:08] what's happening right now it's right
[37:11] there it's in that book amen it's
[37:15] revealed but you see while they can't
[37:18] hear God's voice to you they cannot hear
[37:20] God's
[37:21] voice I mean God's voice to Paul they
[37:24] can't hear God's voice to you amen you
[37:27] see it's the same circumstance now I
[37:30] want to just this might sound uh like
[37:32] I've went off a left hook
[37:36] here do you know modern medicine has
[37:40] proven how important hearing is to us
[37:43] yes Alzheimer's dementia many other
[37:48] things are all connected to the hearing
[37:51] amen and so when your hearing
[37:56] diminishes I hope you you don't mind
[37:57] just a moment of humor sister Jerry
[38:00] leaned on me very hard here couple years
[38:03] ago and uh I do have a little something
[38:06] you know it's kind of like turning
[38:07] Reverb or something up on my left ear
[38:10] but I went to the hearing
[38:12] doctor and did all these tests and he
[38:16] says Paul's hearing is just
[38:19] fine now this ear doesn't hear the same
[38:22] as this ear if I have a preference I
[38:24] want you to talk to my right ear
[38:27] but he turned to
[38:29] Jerry I found great humor in this I hope
[38:32] you don't mind but he turned to Sister
[38:34] Jerry and said there's nothing wrong
[38:36] with your husband's hearing he just
[38:37] can't hear
[38:42] you and then he said it's a man
[38:48] thing but you
[38:50] see did you know because I've been
[38:53] through this experienced it
[38:55] personally vertigo
[38:58] is not a heart
[38:59] issue vertigo is not uh you know an
[39:03] arthritis or a this or that vertigo is a
[39:07] hearing issue that's right because your
[39:11] hearing has been impaired by various
[39:16] things and your
[39:18] balance is therefore hear me well please
[39:22] and just think spiritually your balance
[39:25] is connected to your hearing amen and we
[39:28] wonder why the churches are out of
[39:31] balance my brother and sister because
[39:33] they're not hearing the word of God Amen
[39:37] they're hearing voices educated voices
[39:40] articulate voices voices that are
[39:43] powerful but they're not really hearing
[39:45] the voice and their balance is out
[39:48] because their hearing is out amen and so
[39:52] it's there that we now have so many
[39:54] conditions in the church today is
[39:56] because there's no balance because
[39:58] there's no correct hearing amen and
[40:02] mental health believe this or not people
[40:03] want to shove mental health under the
[40:06] carpet somewhere and act like it don't
[40:08] exist my brother and sister we'll get if
[40:10] the Lord will get me there we'll get
[40:12] there to understand how this comes my
[40:14] brother and sister mental health today
[40:16] many facets of mental health are
[40:19] connected with hearing amen amen and
[40:22] look where the church is at we can be
[40:24] what we want to be we can name ourselves
[40:26] we can do this and God doesn't care
[40:29] that's because they're not hearing amen
[40:31] because he's already spoke his word and
[40:33] his word says and to a real believer a
[40:36] real Christian that word is absolute and
[40:39] when you hear that word something in you
[40:42] says amen that's what God wants but if
[40:45] your hearing is not hearing that's it
[40:50] correctly
[40:51] amen Mental Health
[40:57] you know what the prophet said about all
[40:59] the pills to wake up pills to go to
[41:01] sleep just go find you a a health
[41:05] journal and read
[41:08] it staggering numbers of people exist by
[41:13] something to wake up and something to go
[41:15] to sleep exactly right we're not
[41:17] speaking don't misunderstand me I'm not
[41:18] speaking down on that that's right but
[41:20] it just shows you the day the time the
[41:23] place that we're coming to amen amen and
[41:26] did you know that social
[41:28] health is also connected to our hearing
[41:32] yes
[41:36] sir amen how you
[41:39] feel in a group of
[41:41] people and because I know that I do have
[41:44] some some kind of hearing thing I hear
[41:47] uh correctly in that and pass all the
[41:49] hearing tests but you know you feel a
[41:52] little bit out when we have a fellowship
[41:55] or we are somewhere and you're constant
[41:57] L asking people will you repeat that
[41:59] yeah what did you say becomes maybe not
[42:03] to them but to you it becomes a stigma
[42:05] amen you know so what you do you know
[42:09] this is why sometimes you might say man
[42:11] why did he nod his head yes to that
[42:14] that's because your response when you
[42:15] didn't understand and you don't want to
[42:17] embarrass yourself you
[42:18] just exactly right that color looks ugly
[42:22] on
[42:25] you yeah
[42:27] cuz we want to get away from the stigma
[42:30] so they say fake it till you make it
[42:33] until yeah you can't fake it anymore and
[42:38] I'll tell you what faking it till you
[42:39] make it there was a missionary went to
[42:41] China many many years ago he was trying
[42:44] to to uh uh evangelize the Chinese and
[42:47] and he was a very smart articulate man
[42:50] and he thought he was catching the words
[42:52] and they're on a
[42:53] rooftop and and he he's pretty sure he's
[42:56] got the words correctly and he just
[42:59] keeps repeating these words because what
[43:01] he thought it meant uh uh was would be
[43:04] beneficial for the people to respond to
[43:06] and and so he just keeps repeating these
[43:08] words and and these Chinese are looking
[43:10] at each other and finally two of them
[43:12] stood up and threw him off the roof and
[43:15] when he come climbing back up the stairs
[43:17] what did you do that for you told us
[43:24] to so it can become a stigma yeah
[43:29] let me give you a brief
[43:31] example be therefore holy yeah because I
[43:35] am Holy but if you don't hear that
[43:38] correctly your version of Holiness is
[43:41] not going to match God's version of
[43:45] Holiness and we could offer up many many
[43:48] many examples my brother and sister but
[43:50] we're not here I don't want to be
[43:51] sounding judgmental today maybe maybe
[43:54] strong or a little forceful but not
[43:56] judgmental amen amen but you see when we
[44:00] take this in the spiritual realm the
[44:03] word of God says Revelation comes by
[44:05] hearing that's right and if you don't
[44:07] hear where's your Revelation that's
[44:10] right what are you going to do when God
[44:13] wants to speak to you but you can't hear
[44:17] right or we interpret what we
[44:22] heard Romans 101
[44:25] 12-18 there's no difference Jew and
[44:27] Greek the same Lord
[44:30] overall is Rich unto all that call upon
[44:33] Him amen Lord amen we're here today to
[44:36] call upon you amen we're not going to
[44:38] stand here and act Pious and we're not
[44:40] going to stand here and act like we are
[44:42] some kind of special the only reason we
[44:45] would be special is because God made us
[44:48] special amen for whosoever shall call
[44:51] upon the name of the Lord shall be saved
[44:53] thank you Lord how then shall they call
[44:56] on him in whom they have not believed
[44:59] and how shall they believe in him in
[45:01] whom they have not heard Hallelujah see
[45:06] there's got to be a hearing first for
[45:09] there to be a response yes my brother
[45:12] and
[45:15] sister I'm trying to be concise lots of
[45:17] things going through my head I'm
[45:21] sorry whom they have not heard and how
[45:23] shall they hear without a preacher
[45:27] you know there's certain doctrines out
[45:30] there that you wonder how they're going
[45:33] down the path they're going down it's
[45:35] because they won't listen to the
[45:36] preacher we don't need him any
[45:40] longer oh did I step off into something
[45:44] that's too squishy for
[45:49] us and how shall they preach except they
[45:52] be sent and it is written how beautiful
[45:54] are the feet of them that preach the
[45:55] gospel of peace being Glad Tidings of
[45:58] good things but they have not all obeyed
[46:01] the gospel for Isaiah saith Lord who
[46:04] hath believed our report so then verse
[46:07] 17 our real goal here so then Faith
[46:10] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[46:12] word of God amen amen we can preach
[46:16] anybody we want to preach into heaven
[46:18] you can declare oh God loves you John
[46:22] 3:16 you can lay all of this out my
[46:25] brother and sister but unless God speaks
[46:28] John 3:16 to them it's just a scriptures
[46:31] a preacher spoke and made them feel good
[46:35] I want God to speak to you and I today
[46:38] and every day lip to ear that there is
[46:41] no interpretation and no
[46:44] misunderstanding of exactly what he is
[46:46] saying to
[46:51] us amen are we
[46:54] okay Amen in the resume of the
[47:02] ages so we conclude the seven Church
[47:05] ages saying only what the spirit said to
[47:08] each
[47:09] age God I love how this all ties
[47:12] together amen God doesn't have to cut
[47:15] the string to wrap it all up amen he
[47:18] just takes it and he puts it in the
[47:20] right place and takes it around until
[47:22] it's all brought together in continuity
[47:25] but he said un age he that hath an ear
[47:29] amen it doesn't say to him that hath an
[47:31] eye or him that hath a hand or him that
[47:35] hath ha an ear Amen Let Him hear what
[47:39] the spirit saith unto the churches I
[47:41] sincerely believe that the spirit of
[47:44] God has been speaking to us not only
[47:47] teaching us the truth of the ages but he
[47:49] has been Faithfully dealing with hearts
[47:52] that they may turn to him amen right let
[47:54] me tell you I got in tears
[47:58] sorry this might be a little bit much
[48:00] but I got in tears you
[48:02] see in my life starting 15 years
[48:07] old I always put a carrot out on the end
[48:11] of the stick and I said when this
[48:14] happens in my life I'll serve you
[48:17] Lord one of those
[48:20] come that when my dear little daughter
[48:22] is
[48:23] born Lord I'll serve you
[48:28] not too hard to do the math at a
[48:31] point but did you know my beautiful
[48:34] daughter being
[48:36] born didn't do one thing to
[48:42] Paul every problem I had was still there
[48:46] and yet I had told God when my daughter
[48:48] is born I'm going to get faithful and
[48:51] serve you
[48:52] Lord my brother and sister I don't know
[48:55] how many carrots you got on your stick
[48:57] but it's time to get rid of them amen
[48:59] and if you can't quite reach the carrot
[49:00] to get rid of it then start whittling on
[49:02] your stick amen and when you get the
[49:04] stick down to where you can take those
[49:06] carrots and make a salad out of them
[49:08] amen and simply make your mind up I was
[49:10] called to serve God I will serve God I
[49:13] don't need a stick and I don't need a
[49:15] carrot amen we get all kinds of excuses
[49:18] well when I get a little older Lord when
[49:20] I get this and when this happens and
[49:22] whatever happens over here I'll do it
[49:24] then Lord my brother and sister the word
[49:26] has called called for us when we hear
[49:28] the word and we acknowledge the word we
[49:31] are called to do the word amen when we
[49:34] know to do and won't do it we have
[49:36] iniquity in our life amen and let's just
[49:39] Purge that iniquity that's right amen
[49:41] let's just get that out of the way amen
[49:44] I believe the spirit of God's been
[49:46] speaking to us not only teaching us the
[49:48] truth of the ages but he has been
[49:50] Faithfully dealing with hearts Can
[49:52] someone say Amen that they may turn to
[49:54] him that is the reason for all the
[49:56] preaching and teaching for it is in the
[49:58] preaching and teaching of the word that
[50:00] the Sheep
[50:09] see the scripture backs it up and says
[50:11] we don't live by sight that's exactly
[50:14] right CU if we're living by sight my
[50:16] brother and sister I'm going to say God
[50:18] bless you all today and I'm going to go
[50:20] home and I'm going to go to bed because
[50:21] this boy's exhausted and all I see in
[50:24] front of me is more exhaustion and so I
[50:26] need my sleep more than I need anything
[50:28] else but I'll tell you what does away
[50:29] with exhaustion is the presence of the
[50:32] holy spirit amen when you have God
[50:34] dealing with you whether it's in the cab
[50:36] of your truck in your car in your
[50:38] tractor uh wherever it's at when God is
[50:41] present my brother and sister there's no
[50:43] such thing as
[50:44] exhaustion there's inspiration there's
[50:47] anointing there's Revelation but not
[50:50] exhaustion amen amen God knows how to
[50:52] deal with that so if you're suffering
[50:54] from exhaustion today in that s amen
[50:57] what you need to do is just get in the
[50:58] presence of God and let him the Prince
[51:01] of Peace amen will take away everything
[51:04] that's keeping you from
[51:07] accomplishing amen but he's been
[51:09] Faithfully dealing with hearts that they
[51:11] may turn to him that is the reason for
[51:12] all the preaching teaching for is in the
[51:14] preaching and teaching of the word that
[51:16] the Sheep that's me that's it can
[51:18] someone say that's me amen hallelujah
[51:21] you got to identify with it amen this
[51:23] isn't to look down the Pew to see if
[51:25] there's a sheep on your PE amen and is
[51:28] not to be like greedy and say I'm the
[51:30] only sheep on the Pew but for us to
[51:33] recognize that we are part of a body
[51:35] that's right they hear the voice of God
[51:39] hear the voice of God and follow him for
[51:42] not one moment this is a very familiar
[51:44] uh quote it's been used for a lot of
[51:46] different reasons not for one moment do
[51:48] I bring a message to the people that
[51:50] they may follow me or join my church or
[51:52] start some fellowship and organization
[51:55] I've never done that and never will do
[51:57] that now amen amen isn't that incredible
[52:01] I have no interest in those things but I
[52:04] do have an interest in the things of God
[52:06] and people now look I I I'm just going
[52:08] to Bear my heart maybe speak a little
[52:10] bold I have no other I have no other
[52:13] reason myself personally to be here my
[52:15] brother and sister I have never thought
[52:18] that I could attain some status or some
[52:20] kind of privilege or something by doing
[52:22] this when God caught my heart amen when
[52:25] God spoke spoke to me and I started to
[52:28] realize who I was and why I faced the
[52:31] battle I faced is because Satan hated me
[52:34] because he saw who I was when I couldn't
[52:37] see who I was he saw who you are when
[52:40] you couldn't see who you are and he's
[52:43] fought you over that he's gave you
[52:45] complexes over that he's hindered you
[52:47] over that robbed your confidence over
[52:50] that because if he could do that you'll
[52:53] never step out and take a hold of that
[52:55] promise you'll never go there and stand
[52:58] boldly Before the Throne of God if
[53:00] you're not sure who you are but when you
[53:03] know that God called you before the
[53:05] foundation of the world there's no devil
[53:07] in hell is going to be able to keep you
[53:09] from coming to your promise Hallelujah
[53:11] that's right
[53:13] Allelujah Hallelujah one
[53:16] thing I can accomplish this one thing
[53:18] I'll be Satisfied that one thing is is
[53:20] he established a true spiritual
[53:23] relationship between God and Men wherein
[53:26] men become new cre creations in Christ
[53:29] filled with his Spirit live according to
[53:31] his word I would
[53:34] invite takes a
[53:37] voice plead and warn all to hear his
[53:40] voice at this time yield your life
[53:42] completely to him that's it that's it my
[53:45] brother and sister the scripture says a
[53:47] double-minded man yes sir I'm not going
[53:49] to identify with that I'm not going to
[53:52] be wavering like the sea my brother and
[53:54] sister that one day I'm I'm a Son of God
[53:57] and the next day I don't even know what
[53:59] I'm doing here I'm going to stand here
[54:01] and say you know what the word says He
[54:04] said that he would call his own he
[54:07] wouldn't lose a one he would not forsake
[54:09] us I stand on that promise call me a
[54:13] fool that's fine amen amen I'll be a
[54:16] happy one amen amen sorry to sound
[54:19] strident I'm just it's just bubbling
[54:22] inside of me
[54:24] am plead and warn to hear his voice
[54:27] yield your lives completely even as I
[54:29] trust in my heart that I have given my
[54:31] all to him that's it God bless you and
[54:34] may his coming Rejoice your heart
[54:38] amen you know it's an amazing
[54:41] thing I've met in the last couple years
[54:45] several people that opened up not old
[54:48] people either and we'll tell you I'm
[54:51] afraid of dying
[54:56] yes sir only one reason to be afraid of
[54:58] dying yes sir is that you're not a new
[55:00] creation in Christ that's exactly right
[55:03] and when you're New Creation from Christ
[55:05] you can say thank you Lord for the
[55:06] promotion yes sir thank you Lord for
[55:09] just bringing me into your presence
[55:11] there's nothing to be afraid of amen
[55:14] hallelujah now let's move on here isn't
[55:17] time so
[55:18] fleeting it is I'm going to get brother
[55:21] Isaac to wire up all the clocks so I can
[55:24] adjust them up here
[55:30] amen we should have an appreciation for
[55:32] Spiritual ears you know that yes sir I
[55:35] think every one of us ought to just stop
[55:37] and say you know what thank you Lord yes
[55:39] sir that that I I can hear that I hear
[55:43] your word and it it's not just hearing
[55:45] words as words but you're hearing Christ
[55:49] himself which is the
[55:51] word so I know this might sound a little
[55:55] crazy but imagine we actually have the
[55:58] opportunity to just sit
[56:02] down and say Lord can I talk to you for
[56:06] a moment it
[56:08] Am Lord I'm discouraged
[56:12] today I woke up feeling
[56:15] weak and it's not got any
[56:19] better I don't know if I can make it to
[56:21] the end of the day Lord
[56:29] you know preachers are supposed to
[56:31] always sound like they're the most
[56:32] spiritual in the
[56:37] building maybe it's not the place to
[56:40] talk about carnal
[56:45] things but as
[56:47] humans
[56:50] yeah things
[56:52] happen and one minute you're happy
[56:57] and then next you feel
[57:01] crushed now we can do a lot of things to
[57:03] try and get over
[57:04] that that's why beer wine whiskey all of
[57:09] that kind of stuff they're selling more
[57:10] of it than ever in
[57:12] history because people are coming to the
[57:15] place they're
[57:24] crushed of the stories we could tell oh
[57:29] yes but you're
[57:31] there in the
[57:35] moment and a voice
[57:38] says I am your Refuge
[57:41] that's I am your peace that's it amen
[57:45] come to me that's
[57:47] it amen amen and at the end of the day
[57:51] my brother and
[57:52] sister everything
[57:57] everything is taken care of now when I
[57:59] use the phrase at the end of the day it
[58:01] might not be the end of that 24
[58:02] hours but at the end of the
[58:07] day God's took care of every drop of
[58:12] it amen you see God knows what he's
[58:15] doing our biggest problem is I I don't
[58:18] know take it any way you please okay I
[58:20] don't mean that aggressively but if you
[58:22] don't want to trust
[58:24] God then don't trust him that's it but
[58:27] don't open your mouth and complain
[58:30] either amen amen that's the trth that's
[58:34] exactly right either trust him that's it
[58:39] or go I don't
[58:43] know yeah one or the other that's it oh

[58:50] not insulting

[58:53] appreciation for God's blessings to us
[58:56] right amen you know we live in an age of
[58:58] counterfeit religion yes sir we do my
[59:01] brother and sister church after church
[59:02] after church is trying to outdo the next
[59:04] church until now we have zip lines and
[59:07] we have theaters and we have all kinds
[59:09] of nonsense we have marching bands like
[59:12] you would expect to see I'm talking
[59:13] about you know the little boots and the
[59:15] little short thing and they're doing
[59:16] their thing in the church it's not a
[59:19] house of God anymore it's a house of
[59:21] Hollywood exactly amen and so it's there
[59:24] in that realm my brother and sister
[59:26] counterfeit amen amen look what the word
[59:29] of God said about uh uh uh Ahab and
[59:32] Jezebel amen they had uh you know well
[59:35] not Jezebel but Ahab had good roots
[59:38] raised in
[59:44] church let me shift gears a little
[59:47] bit how many's happy that the Lord has
[59:50] brought the carcass to you amen amen cuz
[59:54] where the carcass is the eagle will be
[59:56] gathered amen and God was gracious
[59:59] enough to you and I to bring the carcass
[1:00:01] to us and placed it right in our laps
[1:00:04] place it right in our presence and then
[1:00:07] anointed the seed that was in there to
[1:00:09] take a bite out of the carcass not to
[1:00:12] just say that looks like the carcass not
[1:00:15] to take someone's word that's the
[1:00:16] carcass but to anoint you and I to go
[1:00:19] and take a bite out of their carcass and
[1:00:22] when we took that bite we found
[1:00:24] something so irresistible in us that we
[1:00:26] had to take another bite amen hallelujah
[1:00:30] amen exactly I've decided you know
[1:00:32] Sister Jerry sorry to throw you on the
[1:00:34] bus honey but sister Jerry's always like
[1:00:36] I don't make pies because Paul eats the
[1:00:37] whole pie well if it didn't taste so
[1:00:39] good I wouldn't eat the whole pie amen
[1:00:42] I'm just following an instinct eat it
[1:00:45] because it's good and when the caret was
[1:00:48] there and God put that anointing in your
[1:00:50] heart you took one bite you had to take
[1:00:52] another bite you had to take another
[1:00:54] bite and you couldn't stop eating and
[1:00:57] when you thought you would pick that
[1:00:58] carcass right down to the bone another
[1:01:00] carcass appears Hallelujah and then when
[1:01:03] we take a bite out of that one it's
[1:01:06] there and it's coming and we're raising
[1:01:08] up we're raising up and we're doing and
[1:01:11] pretty soon my brother and sister we
[1:01:13] realize our life is not in us our life
[1:01:16] is in the carcass hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:21] hallelujah oh
[1:01:23] my Hallelujah that's right I want to ask
[1:01:27] you a question here and then we're going
[1:01:28] to
[1:01:31] close cut man out of
[1:01:34] this I tell you my brother and sister I
[1:01:36] don't know I just maybe I got a
[1:01:39] complex when something happens something
[1:01:42] good happens people say oh brother Paul
[1:01:45] Brother David brother Chris that was my
[1:01:48] brother and
[1:01:49] sister they were just the conduit it
[1:01:52] yeah that's it it was God that's exactly
[1:01:55] right and God poured it in amen it had
[1:01:58] to come out that's right amen if you put
[1:02:00] something in the pipeline and the
[1:02:01] pipeline goes nowhere the pipeline blows
[1:02:04] up amen so it's God putting it in the
[1:02:07] pipeline the conduit and he's sending it
[1:02:09] out and he's giving distribution to you
[1:02:12] yes sir amen so how many of you maybe
[1:02:16] You' just be gracious to me and lift a
[1:02:18] hand how many of you have come to church
[1:02:21] not talking about just here talking
[1:02:23] about going to church serving
[1:02:24] God and you went to church with a
[1:02:27] question and God come right down gave an
[1:02:32] answer I think we have to every one of
[1:02:34] us lift a
[1:02:38] hand wasn't that preacher so
[1:02:43] clever no sorry the preacher didn't have
[1:02:47] a clue amen and if he does have a clue
[1:02:50] and he preaches it in some fashion like
[1:02:51] it's Revelation
[1:02:53] then run
[1:02:57] but you see we're talking Faithful
[1:03:00] Men and God says I'll pour it
[1:03:04] in and they'll let it out amen and it
[1:03:08] will answer questions in lives changing
[1:03:11] those lives now my brother and sister if
[1:03:13] God deals with you direct I'm sorry this
[1:03:15] will be a little blunt if God deals with

[1:03:20] go blaming the church don't go blame the

[1:03:33] steak and then telling your body to
[1:03:35] reject everything that's
[1:03:37] contained in that stake yeah that right

[1:04:03] devil that's trying to put the smoke
[1:04:05] screen up right amen he's the one that's
[1:04:07] trying to block it all out so that we

[1:07:52] there and and start sorting out our
[1:07:55] different es of how we see God you go
[1:07:59] there and stand and people say well

[1:08:38] language and they give up speaking God's
[1:08:41] language to speak their language amen

[1:09:07] what we're a convert
[1:09:11] to are we converts to just
[1:09:14] religion because if we are we'll hear
[1:09:17] and obey our

[1:09:43] your lens but when you have
[1:09:48] grown-ups that give you all kinds of
[1:09:50] reasons why we should all be afraid
[1:09:54] [Music]
[1:09:56] I'm afraid of the direction our nation
[1:09:58] is going I'm not it's already
[1:10:02] prophesied couldn't change it if I
[1:10:04] wanted
[1:10:05] to I'm not afraid of that no sir if
[1:10:09] there would be pardon me to put it this
[1:10:10] way if there was anything to be afraid
[1:10:12] of is that the devil would keep me from
[1:10:14] being ready that's right but if I submit
[1:10:19] myself Hallelujah I'm not going to throw
