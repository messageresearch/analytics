satisfy the hunger within give us guidance Give us directions Lord from the word give us answers Lord that's what we're looking for father everything we need Lord is in you and father that's where we want to seek first father Lord to seek you first Lord knowing that you promised that everything else would be put in its proper place we thank you Lord we bless your Holy Name tonight hallelujah hallelujah amen good to be together with you tonight see each and every one of you amen always just seems like summertime becomes a busy time amen and I think also we need to remember our sister April I think is going to be sharing some time with family so we want to remember her as she travels also amen just uh we'll post a reminder once again on the WhatsApp but brother George will be sharing his testimony Friday evening uh 7 30 a little bit later because there'll be those that work and need time to go home and refresh themselves and we'll just have some simple Refreshments afterwards amen and brother George's testimony just so you'll know I ask him specifically for the spiritual content not how he met sister Rebecca and you know how that she sat in the closet with the phone stretched out and those kind of things I want to hear what it was when God dealt with brother George you know if you know him very well you know a portion of his testimony born to missionary family and these kind of things and just want to I just want to have us experience and hear what it was for him uh coming in and the blessing that God has been and and uh not to make something too much out of it but um certainly God has blessed us with a lovely friendship with brother George and um uh he's a great encouragement to me um just uh all that he saw and God has kept him in balance and that is a beautiful thing on the backboard uh uh Brothers at Cloverdale bibleway sent a little letter and a flyer a couple Flyers concerning online schooling they just ask if we would post that and so there is that letter and those little pamphlets there on the board amen let's turn in our Bibles thank you sister Ruth brother Isaac amen are musicians it's just uh always stirs my heart does me good to see these young people sharing the gift that God has given them with us amen and uh always want to be appreciative of the um the the surrender of their gift to us to just uh help us Amen to worship and first Peter the second chapter verses one through ten it's actually very familiar scripture uh to us giving as it is directive to start out with and we're going to just draw a little thought uh tonight and part of my instinct says this will be short tonight and I know better than to declare that so um we just look here first Peter second chapter verses 1 through 10. wherefore laying aside all malice an old guy and hypocrisies and envious in all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby if so be have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious can we say Amen to that but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner Ace and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient wherein to also they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy Heavenly Father we just ask you to bless Lord the reading of your word let it come to life with us tonight and Lord bless this time together those who could not be here tonight ask your father just to reach out May your presence touch each one we would ask this in your precious name amen you may be seated as we would look at these scriptures I always really appreciated this because it starts out laying out the fact that to accomplish what we want to accomplish or desire in our heart amen and we know that the desire that's in our heart is not our desire it's God's desire manifested in us and so we lay aside the malice the guile hypocrisies envies the speakings and we put all of that to the side and we approach the word as newborn babes and and when we approach that my brother and sister it is there we're coming with a hunger but that we desire to grow and you know as it is we have our young people our youth our children and we see them growing you know I just was going through some photos and how quickly the years pass and and those some here tonight amen that we're just little babes and now they're growing up into lovely young people and how quickly this passes and these desire them that God has placed in in uh Sons and Daughters of God to come to the word as a newborn babe with this desire that we could grow now we know even though the scripture here isn't dealing with it we know that the Babe must move on to solid food must move on to the meat to really grow we can't simply be fed um milk our whole life but it comes a time amen as the scripture says wherever the carcass is amen it doesn't say we're The Milk Jug is it doesn't say we're the easy things are but where the carcass is and the carcass my brother and sister as I have personally got to witness uh in in Africa you watch the vultures and they have to start first by tearing through the the skin to get to the the meat of the carcass and and they have to work at it and you'll see and oftentimes if a hang mean or something will come they'll just scatter without any contest at all one they cannot compete against them but two they're going to let the hyena or the Jackal tear through the hide to get to the meat and my brother and sister the problem with that of letting someone else do it for you if you could just bear with me using kind of these direct words is when someone else tears it open for you it's been contaminated by their idea amen that's why God called the Eagles amen the Bride of this day to come to the carcass and it's there that we as Eagles Approach it as an eagle would approach it not as a jackal or a buzzard or something else but we approach it from an ego point of view and my brother and sister we know that Eagles lack fresh meat amen so here God is giving us these words of encouragement and he's telling us here in verse 3 that uh if I could put it in my words tonight if you don't mind if it'd be that ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious and I would change that to say we have tasted and it is good amen God is gracious that we have an appetite for the open word we have an appetite for the open book amen and we can testify tonight by God's grace that he is gracious to us and we see also that while they did not recognize who Jesus Christ was in their presence amen and they put him to the side it did not change God's plan at all it did not uh disallow Jesus Christ for his uh calling and my brother and sister even today that men have taken this message they are doing their best some making a career out of uh making their their statements and digging up and they're innuendos and my brother and sister you can read things and we won't go into that but I want to make the point that you'll have these people I'm going to call them Talking Heads because really what they're looking for is YouTube hits because YouTube pays them to do this my I mean you see people talking about the most ridiculous things because advertisers flock to those with many hits and so you've got men that my brother and sister they're as much motive to tear the message down is to make income while they do it so they are getting a double dose of judgment there because it's there but it does not matter and I that's why I didn't want to focus on this but it does not matter how much negative attention that they project the bride of Christ is not a buzzard amen she's an Eagle amen so he's not going to feed on all this dead stuff of innuendo and of this and of that and they were associated with these people that went on to do this and do that and it's all very loose my brother and sister but what they're trying to do is just cast a shadow and amen my brother and sister the word says that yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'm going to interpret this for you tonight too I'm not going to worry about it because there wouldn't be a shadow if the light was not present amen so while the Shadows are all around and Satan's trying to make us look at the shadow amen it is not going to be our focus of the bride of Christ amen now I I kind of jumped ahead of myself here let me Reign myself in amen I titled this tonight chosen to go beyond amen and that's what we are tonight we're chosen to go beyond we're not chosen my brother and sister to just Coast we're chosen to actually be Trail Breakers uh uh to blaze a trail not with a new word not with a new life but us blazing our way through all the unbelief all the shadow all the struggle and God has given us a desire to continue to push through this to come to a completion of the plan of God Amen now we'll get along a little later here in and I'll sum it up really short and sweet by God's grace now we look at this as it's telling us that our Lord Jesus Christ being that stone which was disallowed that stone become a stumbling Stone my brother and sister when Jesus Christ was there you studied the history you you're there in Israel you see this face to face while the presence or Ministry of our Lord Jesus give Liberty to others it actually caused some to blaspheme it caused some to become murders and to become very vile in their behaviors and and this is the way it's always been the very word of God that has come in our hour has caused people to find Liberty and find out who they are and to be able to stand and say thank you Lord for this message that you have sent me and it's causing others to bring themselves into judgment amen and I'm not talking about judging yourself daily but I'm talking about judgment amen and so we'll find that The Stumbling stone is still present amen but to you and I it has become the head of the corner it is the all in all it's what peace is it all together it's what's holding it and everything being fitly joined by the word is giving you and I a confidence and I'm a little bit ahead of myself but I'm just going to go ahead and step out there this my brother and sister is not an accident that we believe amen we didn't just stumble upon something and we looked around and said well I guess this is just as good as anything else I'll believe this my brother and sister it goes so much deeper than that amen now the chosen isn't it you know I I focus quite a bit on that in the last while but my brother and sister the chosen or the called out let me put it like this you are the chosen or the called out of a generation to be the generation that carries the word to the coming of the Lord amen so it is as brother Branham describes it at calling a church out of the church amen God is calling you and I out of the generation that's going to see by the word the coming of the Lord and this is irrelevant my brother and sister if we grow old and gray and you bury us that's why I feel relevant of how that all fits God's timing is God's timing and I want to be in God's timing I don't want to be on my time because I'm actually an impatient guy I hate to admit that but it's the truth phone rings twice Jerry needs to answer oh don't tell me some of you don't have that problem yeah you call people and they should just already have a phone in their hand and maybe even holding it to their ear but you know it's a it's the age that we live in and it's the spirit of the age and everything needs to happen right now including God needs to answer my prayer right now amen so it is that we are the chosen of the generation that's going to carry the word to the coming of the Lord and God's going to teach us patience he's teaching me today I had a great dose of patience amen I wasn't happy to get that dose of patience I wanted everything to work differently today but I won't even go into that but look my brother and sister it's not going to be you and I that carry the word to the coming of the Lord but it's Christ in US amen aren't you glad otherwise the burden of the word now we don't often think about the word being a burden to us but remember we are human and humanity and laodicea there's pressure and so carrying the word is actually a burden because what it does as the words being revealed in you the pressure of laodicea is then being focused on you and brother Isaac didn't even realize really what he was saying but he was sharing with me a little something about the little personal submarine that went down deep and imploded here recently amen and he was talking about uh brother he's just sharing this in the back with me about how it is that as you go down deeper and deeper and the pressure builds up and he likened it and I was just sitting there I did give him a hint where we were at but my brother and sister the burden of carrying the word in this age is not an easy burden don't act like oh I just brushed this off I'm the bride no problem my brother and sister Satan has put a Target on you and he would like to implode you he don't need you to go and blow up he wants to implode you that people would then say well that's what it is when they serve as they serve they can't handle it well my brother and sister the truth is I cannot handle it but Christ in me Amen brother Isaac you summed the sermon right there because he gives the analogy of how God made these fish to be able to go swim all the way down there and why because I'm going to plagiarize your little mini sermon why my brother and sister they're not trying to hold their breath amen they become a part of the environment that they're in amen and if we as Sons and Daughters of God get in the environment of laodicea Amen then we don't fit there and we can't handle that but as we get in the environment of the Supernatural and we move into that as the pressure comes on Christ in US Rises up and pressurizes back against the things of laodicea the spirits of the age and we are here not of our own accord not of our own ability every time that we come into our own flesh man I can do this we fail amen it's just how it is I've I've been in this position before I can do this well our best thing is to say last time Lord I was in this position you bailed me out so I'm just coming into this position and Lord I'm already crying out Lord I need you amen because we were called to deal with the pressure amen now you look at this as Christ in you amen how can you compare Christ the Holy Spirit in you to the world there's really no way my brother and sister to to compare the two it's just simply not an equal thing and you look and this will sound a little judgmental if you'll forgive me but you'll find as Satan has worked his way into the religious world into the church world and over time you'll see the denominations just recently uh there was another uh it didn't really make the news but another uh uh old denomination is now splintering and there's just on the East Coast 57 churches that belonged into the Lutheran movement said we're no longer associate because the Lutheran Church as a denomination has went so far off we can't go there so what's happened now get this what would the what the prophet told us amen they will now become a denomination to themselves so they didn't get deliverance from a denominational Spirit they just will become a denomination to themselves now I want you to bring that closer to home that we see little isms and schisms coming around and well we don't agree here and we don't agree there well what we need to do is find the Altar and all pray together and come to the agreeance with God's word amen not with a group of men or women amen but to come in agreeance with the word of God but you'll see that then those things become another denomination and they will be and I'm sad to say it this way will be doomed to fail because they never went back and correct the original problem that caused it to be what it is now my brother and sister the moment they got away from the word amen that seed of denominationalism was planted and it come now to bear fruit and split it right down now I don't know if you're familiar with this I've been in houses before sister Jerry and I looked at a house right over in the to Nampa here that well I guess it's out that way that we were looking out to buy as property for a church kind of wished we had in a way amen several Acres an old house big concrete shop we could have done wonders with that amen wouldn't have been in the city too wouldn't that been awesome but my brother and sister there was a tree that was planted too close to close to house and The Roots had asked actually worked their way through the foundation and appeared inside the basement and they watered the lawn through a ditch and just flooded it and just get this now and when they flooded the yard the water filled up a foot or two deep in the basement so the tree never got thirsty but why wouldn't you the very thing that's trying to break the thing you value why would you not deal with it was the tree more important than the house but you see that's the spirit of denominationalism we we we're going to let our tree we plant to destroy our house but we can't do anything about the tree so you look and see now I hope that made sense to you that we cannot compare the holy spirit with the spirit that's in the world and all sometimes we'll look at this we've had conversations of nice people good people sincere people with good words and words of truth and how do we compare and how do we look that my brother and sister what we got to come back to does it line up with the word there that's the that's the very Crux the hard judgment as it would be is not as hard as we might think amen now as we look at this and compare the spirit that's upon the bride of Christ in this last day and the spirit that's upon the world we read or listen however you like to do that a brother Brown speaking about the astronaut age amen and I'm just going to paraphrase through this so we're quite quick amen but he's talking about how we progressed man walking from the horse to the buggy to the car to all of these things we come to the jet age and in the culmination even beyond the jet age is the astronaut age amen and so what we created now I think it's just awesome uh to be able to get on a jet airliner fly to Israel fly to South Africa fly to Asia wherever it might be and man's figured out how to pressurize this aluminum capsule and put you inside of of it and you're able to fly I think the highest I've ever seen on this screen that I've been in an airplane was 41 000 feet and that's just pretty high amen time enough for you to actually think you can fly your own self but you see when you're in that Capsule that's a temporary time and space and it comes to an end but the prophet of God said this bride this this placed in Christ pressurized against the spirits of the age is able to move through the atmosphere amen amen a power able to move Beyond present atmosphere now if we are in the astronaut age my brother and sister should we not be able to power through the present atmosphere that we are in amen I'm not talking about being in the presence of God I'm talking about laodicea and we have to go to work we go to the grocery store we go whatever but we see my brother and sister that God said I'm not going to have you just sit here and wallow and struggle to get through this I'm going to put you as an astronaut and power you through this or power you beyond this atmosphere and that's why we as Sons and Daughters of God can exist in this present world and be Overcomers we do not have to say well I if I was here I could have I could have served God if I was here I could have served God if this had been different I could have served God no my brother and sister we've been anointed to power through that atmosphere and to say I was called to serve God and I will and by God's grace I am serving God Amen so as we'll look at this we'll see now of the power to Beyond this present atmosphere now look at this as you get higher the gravitational pull gets less the atmosphere is thinner I think you see where I'm going so it's when we're down here clucking with the chickens gravity has a tremendous impact on us the atmosphere there as as many bars of gravity as can be listed amen unless you're way on top of mountain clucking with chickens amen but that's still not going to get you away from the chickens but you look at this and so as we get higher in Christ amen as we are moving up the pull of this present World becomes less aren't you glad I say thank you Lord amen and so the gravitational pull of the laodicean spirit starts to fall away and that's why as Sons and Daughters of God we need to make the effort to climb up into Heavenly places not to be bound by all of laodicea and all of the struggle of laodicea Amen you know finding the right girl the right guy amen getting married starting a family buying a house all of these things are a great actual strain we Face them in increments so after a while we don't notice the pressure that's on us but the truth of it is I'm sorry to tell you young people you move beyond your youth and it's only at that stage do you start to realize what God has given you Godly moment down a home that you're secure in all of these things suddenly not having a job is not an option suddenly light bills in gasoline and cars and groceries and all of this thing starts to come in but that is really the least of the things that we become pressurized in this day and we start coming and working in in you know for businesses and they make decisions that come right down gravity pulls it right down to your level and you have to deal with the influence of their decision sometimes my brothers and sisters the decisions and the words and the conversation of others are more damaging to you as a Christian and then if somebody just called you names you know they just come and they're undermine and they're doing their best to erode but God says you know what I've called you beyond this I'm raising you umpire I've taken you through this and when you get up into Heavenly places you'll look at this and recognize that's just the devil and now you don't go to that person you know I I don't recommend you walk up to your boss and say that decision you made you're just a devil now that's probably not wisdom but you need to realize that it was the devil that anointed them to make a decision that impacted you in such a fashion now if we look at this in this point and say these people then you're missing the point it's Satan doing his very best to pull you back out of heavenly places and ground you in laodicea and hold you there amen and it affects our lives as such now as we look at this getting Beyond this gravitational pull of laodicea now you know we have many wonderful examples Amen brother Bud Southwick believed that's just a simple truth of it he believed but he still had a cigarette habit how can you be a believer in Smoke that's a filthy habit brother Brian I'm just going to go out and check the horses now brother bud this is how Satan Works he gets us down in gravity and influences they're honest brother Bud didn't go upwind of the tent no sir go out here got to have that little nicotine fix just lights that cigarette and a prophet of God speaks these words brother bud when did you quit smoking but you see what God was doing he was breaking Bud Southwick away from the gravitational pull of laodicea and God honored his very words when he made the statement just now and never smoked again you see God was pulling him that doesn't seem too Supernatural does it I mean there wasn't you know like lightning crossed the heavens there wasn't any Thunder That Shook everything there was an angel come down that anybody saw doesn't seem really spiritual doesn't seem Supernatural but I'm telling you tonight that was a supernatural event because as those words anointed in him come out of his mouth just now what he could have done is he could have said no brother Branham I still have this filthy habit I can't break it but something inside of him Broke Free from the gravity of laodicea and he said just now this Supernatural took place and I'm stepping into that now I want to bring this to you if you can step here with me how many times has God offered you and I the opportunity to speak and step into that and Satan's right there to pull us down and it says you know that if our heart condemns us not then we have confidence in God and Satan man he can bring those thoughts back quick and some would say amen he can bring him right in there some of you haven't thought about in a long time bring it right in there and it checks you and what God wants us to do is break that gravitational pull and say Lord you've delivered me Lord You've healed me I'm confessing it and I'm stepping into that right now people say but I have this problem for a long time I need to do this this and this my brother and sister what we need to do is take a moment like that and break the bonds of a spiritual gravity amen an antichrist gravity and come and break that and step up into the heavens because we're not land lovers we're astronauts Hallelujah so what do we do when we get beyond the spirit of laodicea and we're Sons and Daughters of God does it not get easier can someone agree with me or not am I on the wrong path when we break through that we suddenly realize you know what this is the devil anointing My Flesh my mind my spirit and when I can break that anointing and get under this anointing here amen I can rise up into Heavenly places and and I feel a liberty to pray I feel a confidence to pray amen what my brother and sister this scripture is so boldly declares to you and I that if we will pray and we don't pray amiss he'll give it to us amen Lord help us to cut all the little extra Frills out you know years ago Toyota tried to a marketing gimmick little Toyota pickups would show up on the car lot and um they had them all set up over here but you know you start well I just need a pickup to work in okay how come this one doesn't have a bumper it's extra oh okay how come everybody has a driver's side mirror passenger side's extra there's no radio extra no intermittent wipers extra what were they doing now some people would say I don't care I'm bumper ain't gonna stop anything anyway it's made out of tin foil and I don't need a radio and I don't care if I can't see them on that side why do I need to look a mirror and see it but what they were doing is they were leading the customer who come in and says I can afford 200 a month you can tell I'm from another generation 200 a month that's all I can afford well I would like a bumper on it and I would like mirror and I would like a radio and they have signed the papers and walked out with a 350 a month payment why because they were LED the whole plan they started sending a car salesmen to academies to teach them how to lead people into debt and Satan was the one who anointed those programs and how that he works and he comes and as the prophet of God said my brother and sister and this is no direction to no people but he said here we are looking at the coming of the Lord just read this the other day we're looking at the coming of the Lord and we're building multi-million dollar churches as though we're going to be here forever see how this all kind of comes along now I don't point that in anybody's Direction don't misunderstand but you see that is what Satan's doing while he's binding the church down amen we're trying to be free but we're binding ourselves and so God is coming to unbind us if the church has a payment well I don't mean the people inside are going to be spiritually bound but there are certain obligations that must be met amen if that makes sense to you and I say thank you Lord for giving us a church very economical amen so when we get taken beyond the the atmosphere of laodicea I I want to ask you what is beyond we preach about this of how we get Beyond this we move Beyond this but what is beyond I think sometimes we need to come and quantify some of these little things that we preach about to to actually teach would be as it were our young people or whoever just what is beyond like we say get the Holy Ghost but my brother and sister a young person has an experience with God and God deals with them and they feel like they've changed but what happens in the very first time that they come to what you might say a a a a a pretty severe mistake or they come to a real challenge what does Satan do you got the Holy Ghost for sure I'm here to encourage you you got to look no what does he do you never had it you just had an emotion you just had something so what is beyond is the Holy Ghost an emotion I stand here to tell you tonight the Holy Ghost is an emotion amen if you've got the Holy Ghost there's some emotion in there somewhere but it's not now this sounds like I'm talking out of both sides of my mouth but it is not an emotion you feel literal the spirit of God anointing you it's an emotion there's something there that you're just so happy it's life-changing but if Satan has come and brother Branham says that Satan can impersonate every gift that there is in the church so if Satan can come and anoint this and impersonate this gift of the Holy Ghost then people have the Holy Ghost but they go on not much has changed in their life but they're convinced I got the Holy Ghost I felt the emotion this is why the prophet of God said the word must be attached to every single thing that we do it whether we're talking baptism must be attached to the word we're talking about the gift of the Holy Ghost must be attached to the word if we're talking about the gifts in the body speaking in tongues etc etc they must be attached to the word everything comes back and attaches to the word and my brother and sister we were chosen to be the manifestation of the evidence that God is in the midst of the church amen you say boy brother Paul uh we we just come across as one critic of the message said those message people are so arrogant my brother and sister I'm not arrogant if I had five dollars in my pocket and I tell you I have five dollars amen that's not arrogant I'm giving you facts and let's raise that up to where it might make a difference uh 5 000 in my pocket if I have 5 000 in my pocket that's not necessarily arrogance but if I'm boasting that I have it and you don't that's arrogance and we are sitting here today my brother and sister not as boasters but as the very literal manifestation of these scriptures in Peter that is declaring that you are the one amen this stone is a stumbling block to them but to you it is not what does that mean there's someone who comes to that stone and recognizes what that stone is Amen to them they wanted to push it out of the way they wanted to ignore it but to The Chosen they come and said this is nothing less than our Lord Jesus Christ coming to me amen it's life-changing amen so what is beyond for us well I tell you what my brother and sister there is a realm Beyond this right here it's called the supernatural and the world is exploring and constantly looking of what is this Supernatural what the events that are taking place uh you know they're trying to figure out what what is this element that's out here that we know is there now are you guys into UFOs UFOs are quite interesting when you have an airline pilot flying over the Pacific Ocean 38 000 feet 565 miles an hour and something flies up by the window in their cockpit they can't see anybody's face they're not looking in there some guy with pointy ears but it flies up beside them and it goes up and disappears but what it did is it went up and it circled the planings right back to that same spot again and all of these movements that were there until finally it just is a flash of light and it's gone and you have sane people saying we saw this you have all the people in the cockpit of an airliner saying we saw the same thing well you know that wasn't crafted in Hollywood now this might seem silly example but this is how man crafts things you have Spider-Man crawling up the side of a 10-story building he's really crawling on the floor of something that's 40 feet long duplicated again and again and again digitally well what is that I hope you are with me that is a carefully devised fable because what is being presented to the people is not anywhere close to reality of what it is so God has come and he's moving in the midst of a bride in this day he's not offered her some carefully devised Fable he's not offered her something that can be just duplicated it can be impersonated my brother and sister but not duplicated amen so we look Beyond this amen so we're looking the realm of the supernatural deep things don't you love deep things I love deep things I'll tell you how much I like deep things I like deep things like a mom being able to enter behind the veil for her family into the very presence of almighty God and intercede for the needs of her children or her husband and be able to do I like those kind of deep things amen you don't need to know my brother and sister how it was God's thought was when he created the Milky Way it doesn't matter the Milky Way exists and God's thoughts are God's thoughts but I like the Deep things amen that causes young people teenagers and young people in the day that we live in when everything right down to the most pitiful of thoughts is projecting in our children and the Deep things of the Holy Spirit sealing them in this wicked day and holding them and carrying through them this world and people say your family there's something about them I'll tell you what that is it's the presence of almighty God the Holy Ghost surrounded around those children and walking with them and a mother and a father and a church body saying Lord be with our children and keep them in this wicked day I like those deep things I like those things that are life-changing we don't need to have a doctrine that when Church gets out and nobody can explain it we don't need doctrines that when we get home we look at each other and say did you understand what the preacher said I didn't understand a word that's not deep my brother and sister are deep is what anoints Sons and Daughters of God to do like our brother Bud Southwick and when we have an issue in life to stand up and say just now Lord just now I'm stepping out of my circumstance into the promise of the word and believing it not going to stop brother Bud didn't go buy another carton of cigarettes just in case my brother and sister I'll tell you what amen I like the Deep things of teenagers filled with the Holy Ghost I like the Deep things of young people knowing god is real amen we say well that just happens uh my brother and sister are that's Supernatural amen that's the power of God that's right here in this day that we're living when all of hell is focused to destroy our young people because he wants another kind of training and he'll start in slow and patient he'll go slow and patient my brother and sister amen I like deep things like a church that's seeking out more of Christ I like that kind of Deep thing not religion not just us coming and we come so our presence we go home we're here we're there we show up at birthday parties and this kind of party in a fellowship my brother and sister I say the Deep thing is when a body of Believers can be anointed to desire more of Christ amen and want to hold on to a standard not letting that standard the song Amen give me the word let that be a mantra that is not just words but let it be something deep in her heart that we say just give me the word I might sound old-fashioned I might not sound too exciting but I tell you what just give me the word because this word is what will take us right out of laodicea and I'm telling you my brother and sister you'll break every bond that Satan amen has tried to put on you you'll break every law of nature you'll break everything when God calls you home amen there'll be nothing stop you amen verse 5 going back ye also has some old dead letter Stones laying in the bottom of the creek no sir that's Lively stones are built up a spiritual house no one ever built a house without exerting effort amen we're Lively stones we're built up my brother and sister we're a holy priesthood and why to offer up a spiritual sacrifice that is acceptable amen we're not looking for religion and we're not asked asking our headquarters if we sing this song like this is that okay if we clap is that okay if we sing loud is that okay if we have three violins in church is that okay four or five or six would be we're in an age of the building up if you study the message of the hour with an open mind a clear heart you'll find nothing in there they said brother Brown was a woman hater but if you look through the message with an open mind and a clear heart you'll see the foundation has been laid and the spiritual house is being built that's right now I'm going to plagiarize this off of a minister in the message that was a live service tonight that I just have to be listening to when I finished up my notes brother Donnie says this when you look back through time you will see Oral Roberts left a university Billy Graham left libraries and schools and different things and he names off several ministers of what they left a legacy and he says but we look around do you see any buildings no William Branham theological Library do you do you see much of anything that he did you know brother Brian didn't want his name on The Tabernacle that was man doing that brother Brown didn't want his name on there I liked how brother Donnie put it he said these guys leave libraries and this and that and endowment funds and all this stuff what did what did Brother Brown leave us the word what a legacy my brother and sister not a building some of our kids you know if we we were in their denomination would maybe never have the funds to go to Oral Roberts University never have the funds to go over and go here or go there of these great things but one of the things about it rich and poor Every Nation every Kindred every tongue been left the word oh thank you Lord amen how precious God is amen he give us the word and that word is more than enough for us Hallelujah so brother Branham tells us that that Satan can impersonate all the signs and so because he could not take as it were the veil in the temple now you have to look at this through spiritual eyes because anyone could take the cloth and reproduce that Veil but he could not uh impersonate or reproduce the veil in the temple amen because it wasn't the cloth my brother and sister it was the blessing or anointing upon the veil are you with me otherwise why would you build a tabernacle out about your skins other than he was tearing our height off and hanging it on the walls of the Tabernacle because we're by and large a bunch of badgers leave us alone and we'll only growl at you Pocus and with scratch and bite amen so you look at this he couldn't do that so what did he do he his Recreation was a veil of intellectualism so there's no Veil for them to go behind now as it were into the holiest of holies because now they have an intellectual understanding of what's behind there so they come in there they talk about the baptism of the Holy Ghost they talk about the gifts they talk about all these things but they're talking from an intellectual point of view it is not Revelation it's not real it's not alive amen there is not a god behind their Veil amen well there is he's just the God of this evil age amen so it is he cannot reason he did not go there is he cannot and I'm going to jump over this so I hope you catch and look over my naughtiness amen but it's their see he could not operate behind the veil in the presence of God I want you to think about Satan of all the things he do he said I'm going to rise up above he's still attempting but what he couldn't do was go behind the veil in the presence of God and operate there see he come to Jesus right when Jesus comes from the Wilderness he come to him Jesus did what we should be doing instead of trying to explain it all just take it back to the word and he didn't give him 42 scriptures there's a whole list my brother and sister somebody has studied it out a whole list of the scriptures Jesus could have gave but he gave two and they were effective so Satan couldn't operate behind the veil amen so in an age of the building up of the spiritual house now I'm talking about for the bride of Christ right took us from denominationalism legalism all these things building up the house and the age of that Satan is doing his best just to redefine the house if you can't build the house you redefine the house you you change what the image that people have and so you know it simply has come back to and I'll keep it simple here uh bigger is better and not Satan's whole program bigger is better so it doesn't matter the content right amen just like the old phrase would you rather have ten thousand counterfeit dollars or one real one but you see what the book is open Can someone say thank you Lord the book is open now any of you that have ever framed houses amen cookie cutter houses you don't even need a blueprint I mean they they are just you could actually you can actually just look at them and they can just tell you the info and you can go Frame It Up but a real house you need a blueprint and the book is open amen the blueprint is before us the blueprint has been revealed and we don't need to go ask Satan how he wants our house to be built we know what we're supposed to be building up amen and so it's there as we do this now this seems a strange thing and I hope you can follow me because these thoughts are all trimmed up here but look at Thomas remember Thomas anybody ever meet Thomas we'll all say you have because you've met me I'm a Thomas now some people would say whoa whoa whoa whoa you're really cutting down on yourself but I'm here to tell you tonight I believe I could be wrong every one of us needed a vindication we as humans needed some evidence that this is real and so every one of us in reality is a Thomas amen so you know when I first come across this kind of studying and looking at that and I started looking at Thomas In a Different Light because I was Thomas or Thomas was me or however that was as a young man coming up and looking at all of this I had my season and I want to focus on this but I had my season that I questioned whether this was truth or not sister Jerry would know and I won't bore you with all the details but God can be really gracious to you when you're working and God speaks to you not an audible voice God speaks to you and says tomorrow at church this and this will happen and you go to church the next day and you're like was that just my brain playing tricks with me and then nothing that Paul did I'm Mr oblivious but everything the Lord spoke to me you start to think that was incredible but it happened again and again and again what was he doing go ahead Thomas go ahead find out for yourself Thomas confirm it yourself don't take it as a carefully devised fable it's right here Thomas everybody's like I'm doubting Thomas You Don't See Jesus tear him up over that I mean why didn't Jesus say Thomas thou of little faith and whatever just depart and tell you you know no no because Thomas was a different kind of believer and I'm glad God had Grace for him because I'm That Kind of believer I needed the Lord to show me this was real are you with me I don't want anyone to be confused so he could be called doubter but he wanted a Vindication amen and I think there's probably a lot more Thomases around than we like to admit amen amen so he didn't he didn't want to carefully devise Fable he wanted fact and uh I tell you what I don't want to carefully devise fable I'm telling you I know this seems like a strange thing to say uh but if uh if I found out this was a fable all you would see is dust I'd be gone but I tell you my brother and sister it's just the way I am who I am I study I study all kinds of weird things and I look at all kinds of different things because I'm looking at them from a certain angle and my brother and sister you're watching everything that even resembled holiness collapsing falling apart coming apart at the seams whether it's at the bottom working its way up through the hierarchy or it's at the top working its way down or in the middle working its way out you'll find that it's coming apart prophecy fulfill amen but if you don't tell the story my dad is a young boy my dad I lied to him got my eye just whooped off of me I mean our practice had to go looking around for a spare hide somewhere to put on because he whooped it right off of me my dad drilled it into me he says son if you tell the truth you never have to remember the story hmm I learned that one people say you know it's maybe not the best way to deal with your children but I tell you what whenever you can drive A Life Lesson down in about 10 minutes it's probably not a bad lesson yeah a lesson that you stop the rest of your life when the devil would tempt you and you'd be like nope not going there you still feel that all the way connected from the posterior to the depths of the core of your brain you feel that and you're like tell the truth even if it makes you look foolish oh my God proved himself didn't he I don't think we'd be here tonight if he hadn't proved himself amen we have the vindication that we needed to believe amen now I'm going to jump back to this other deal before we move on and close other people they've got their story didn't they miss the vindication Maybe they never looked for it in the beginning they liked the story God sent a prophet novel something new let's let's be part of this but when God started tearing the height off of them they said correction Begins the house of God but not in my church my church God is a loving gracious grandfather he loves everybody John 3 16 is one of their favorite scriptures for a reason but they're not going to stand up and say Lord if I'm wrong correct me because they believe they have the answer the Fable if I could be this bold the fable fits their life so there's no contradiction and without contradiction we never pursue truth when you come to contradiction my life doesn't match the word some people say well the word doesn't match my life I can't accept that but they got that backwards our life has to match the word and when we come in contradiction and my life doesn't match the word there's something in me says you're wrong Paul go said it right amen so God moving that way okay let's go to the unveiling of God here brother Gideon amen notice we then we become part of him as and I didn't elaborate on the veil as much as I intended forgive me so if it seems like there's a little dysfunction there we become part of him as you are the veil that veils him isn't that incredible my brother and sister the veil that was in the temple was rent but God says no problem I've got another Veil that I'm going to bring on the earth to hide the glory of God and you are going to be the veil that veils Christ amen and I just read that and my heart leaps because God didn't need to go back and build another Tabernacle out of badger skins and all of these fine Linens and all of these things he come and he said I've got some people then I'll just use them to be the veil now amen and so you are a part of him as long as Christ is in you as Christ was of God because God was in him made him God and as Christ is in you the hope of glory you become part of Christ amen he that believeth on me in the works that I do shall he also amen see you become part of the Christ as long as Christ is hid in you then it's veiled to the unbeliever but you know he is in you amen now people say how do you know that you've got the Holy Ghost well if I could just type it to you this kind of way tonight sorry it might come across a little foolish but if you remember the day that Christ come and stepped inside of you there is no way he stepped inside of you without you knowing he'd done that No More Than Anything Could Be oh I'm at loss for words there's just no way that that can take place and you not know it not an emotion but it'll bring emotion not intellectual but you'll be able to look at the word and realize what happened amen God's stepping into the people and as long as Christ is hid in you and then it's veiled to the unbeliever right as they come well brother Brown I don't believe this I love that brother Brown says okay I'm not going to argue with you it's not for unbelievers amen so as long as you're not the unbeliever but you know he's in you you are do you like that I love brother branham's English I I I we might have even went to the same school you are templing Christ what's a good substitute word for that we know what he meant I don't think we need another word we are templing in other words God said here let me show you the Tabernacle and what he would do is show us the bride and there she would be and he would say this is my Tabernacle this is the blueprint that I gave them to build a tabernacle for me in this day amen we're not going back to a tabernacle built in the wilderness we're God going back to a tabernacle built in Jerusalem amen we are the Tabernacle that God said here's the blueprint of what we're gonna build in this day oh Hallelujah I want to be a templing amen of the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen it's veiled to the unbeliever but you know he's in you you are templing Christ behind the veil the skin that makes it real personal Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life Hallelujah he's there but you know if we just go ahead and take these commas you've still got to deal with the skin he's behind it but what you all see is me and what I see is you and you don't like what you see and I don't like what I see if they would only this why did they do that they shouldn't have said that they should have done this what is it skin but let's not forget a prophet's words that said he is inside this Temple inside this skin oh thank you Lord hallelujah I look in a mirror and all I see is a man that makes so many mistakes when the prophet of God said you backslide daily I have to shout amen but then I remember he's in me then we because if you want to be one of those that thinks you have to have every part of every hesitation behind because of this Veil this Veil again in human flesh hides God the word from the unbeliever now I want to just we're actually I am closing do you know that if you'll just catch what I'm saying here you're the reason the unbeliever can't see that's right and the devil would like to make you think that it's your fault but a prophet of God says that it was God inside of you that was veiling this from the unbeliever what the scripture say I won't be able to quote the exact scripture maybe you guys could help me but I'll paraphrase it if they saw I'd have to heal them and I have to save them so there's more to this so don't start feeling bad that you're reading this and the prophet of God saying the reason the unbeliever can't see it is because of you you're actually doing the will of God instead of looking at you saying sisters young ladies mothers wives here why are you like they are instead they look with derision they look like they come out of a different century they look haggirly was one brother shared he's walking behind his wife and somebody made a comment look at that woman she looks so haggardly dressed like that and the brother is like I'm not going to make a contest with these people inside of a store but he's like huh haggardly don't look bad the beauty was in the eye of the beholder and God said right here Prophet says this amen that it's there now we'll close out on this once you come sister Ruth that'll force me as it is written see written you are written Epistles the Bible said now what is an epistle it's a written word and you are the written Can someone say thank you Lord other words you read it like this you it said you are written Epistles or you are the word that has been written made manifest nothing can be added to it you can't say I'm a written epistle and living some other kind of something but what this has already wrote brother Branham patches Bible because nothing can be added or taken away this is why now sisters you are the perfect example of the believer of the church and this is why God's anointed you and to have a heart to be who you are because nothing can be added and nothing can be taken from you or we are a denomination because then if something's added to you sister see don't let the devil convince you I need to do this and this to look pretty [Music] come on it's a hard spirit I see it happen all the time and it starts with a little something here now I hope I don't offend nobody but it can start with just a little blush now brother brother Brown said it was okay you know you had a little acne or something you can cover a lemon but I'm telling you the Devil comes and says you look so much better and if that made you look better well if a little Works how about a whole lot and then the devil's got another Avenue to work on see we're the bride of Christ nothing I know I'm stretching this please forgive me for that but nothing needs to be added or taken away we don't need to add it Saints bride we don't need to add it let's just be the word amen let it be manifested because we were chosen to rise right up out of this amen let's just stand and sing a song or two amen we were called to go beyond Saints we're not called to lay stay here amen I've never watched any of that but they had all of those Left Behind series amen you know a lot of those people they were called to be left behind but this bride wasn't it amen that's the whole reason God said I'll come and Shake Heaven and Earth for her because I am not leaving her behind amen she's the one I come for and she's the one I will take with me amen hallelujah what a contradiction I just read a little deal guys like when are they going to make another left behind story well I tell you what their version it was just a story but God as a bride that he's calling she's chosen he's not leaving her behind Hallelujah oh my Hallelujah got enough life left in sing a song or two amen I'm running for my life 696. KFC it says sister I'm running for my life I'm running for my life I'm running for my life I'm running for my life my body asks you what's the matter with me tell them I'm saved and Sanctified Holy Ghost Field and I've been baptized I've got Jesus on the inside and I'm running for my life trusting in God's grace frosting in God's grace trusting in God's grace [Music] anybody asks you what's the matter with me tell them I'm trusting in God's word believing everything I've read and heard won't give up trusting in God's grace you know all the way in all the way going on all the way anybody ask you what's the matter with me and there's nowhere else Hallelujah yield to Satan no I've got God's word in my soul I'm going all the way turn home with me won't you come on home with me won't you come on home with me anybody ask you what's the matter with me Tell them I've got the Original Seed going to meet my step on into eternity won't you come on home with me hallelujah amen I just felt like that song was real fitting amen all it is I'm just got the word you know I don't know if any of you ever in school way back when ever ran a relay [Music] it's pretty amazing a lot of strategies and really some say we'll start off fast hope we can hang on to the end but it seems like the winning strategy is you start off pretty fast does something to the opponent then you run the endurance Runners two of them in the middle the ones that literally can run lap after lap the same speed never slow down amen They Carried the word right on through the Dark Ages never stopped just kept going and then you save your best runner for last I'm glad you're part of God's relay he saved the best for last and you've got the word and you're running with it and the devil's going to try and tell you that he's keeping up with you but I'm sorry he's losing he's falling farther and farther behind as the bride Rises up into Heavenly places he just can't keep up Hallelujah come plead complete amen I just read a quote where brother Brown says now the song leader shouldn't preach and the preacher shouldn't lead songs and I thought what am I doing here we have a song leader we have so many LED songs tonight maybe maybe we ought to post that quote so we can all see why amen hallelujah 695 amen you know sometimes you read those things when you're studying and you're like I'm guilty I'm guilty I should not be leading songs oh it's not by works of righteousness but highest grace alone it's not by words of righteousness but by his grace alone it's not my works of righteousness by his grace alone and we are completely complete complete complete in him we are complete in him completely complete in him oh we are completely there's nothing more Hallelujah for Jesus Paid It All there's nothing more that I could do before Jesus Paid It All there's nothing more than I can do for Jesus Paid It All completely complete complete in him oh we all complete in him oh completely complete complete in him [Music] the [Music] fullness [Music] oh completely complete complete in him oh we are completely oh completely complete complete in him [Music] there's now no condemnation to them who are in Christ [Music] oh complete complete complete in him oh we are complete in him complete complete in him take it personal oh complete complete complete in him oh I am complete in him oh completely complete complete in him oh I am completely and let's give him just a little praise Hallelujah Lord thank you Lord we can stand tonight and testify that we are complete oh Father not by our
