[27:02] amen we're just kind of old-fashioned
[27:04] but don't we love the lord

[27:07] comment i said we should sing
[27:09] i like the old time way uh i like the
[27:12] old time singing shouting
[27:15] [Music]
[27:30] i like the old time
[27:36] i like the old time singing

[28:56] [Music]
[29:03] say amen amen praise god well
[29:06] let's get ready to turn the service to
[29:07] our pastor to brother paul i said we
[29:10] went home and studied
[29:12] and uh number 407
[29:15] and we changed the key so we all can
[29:17] sing it in christ alone
[29:19] so i know he's been wanting to say we've
[29:20] always just sing the course
[29:22] we figured out what he would probably
[29:23] serve as best if it's still a little too
[29:26] high for you just open your mouth and
[29:27] pretend
[29:28] [Music]
[29:29] but uh it's a beautiful and i agree with
[29:32] our pastor the verse
[29:33] the verses are just beautiful let's sing
[29:35] this as we get ready to receive him
[29:38] in christ alone will i
[29:42] glory for i could pride myself
[29:47] in battles one
[29:51] for i've been blessed beyond measure
[29:56] and by his strength alone i'll
[30:00] overcome
[30:04] oh i could stop and
[30:07] successes like diamonds in
[30:12] my hands but those trophies could not
[30:16] equal
[30:18] to the grace by which i
[30:22] stand in christ
[30:26] alone i place my
[30:30] trust and find my glory in the power
[30:36] of the cross
[30:39] in everything torrey
[30:43] let it be said of me
[30:47] my source of strength
[30:51] my source of hope
[30:54] is christ alone
[30:59] [Music]
[31:02] in christ alone do i glory
[31:06] for only by his grace i
[31:09] am redeemed for only
[31:13] his tender mercy
[31:16] could reach beyond my weakness
[31:19] to my knees
[31:23] and now i seek no greater honor
[31:28] in just to know him more
[31:33] and to count my gains but losses
[31:37] to the glory of my lord
[31:45] in christ alone
[31:48] i place my trust
[31:52] and find my glory in the power
[31:56] of the cross
[32:07] my source of strength
[32:11] my source of hope is christ
[32:16] the lord
[32:19] oh in crime let's say
[32:22] christ alone
[32:25] i place my trust
[32:29] and find my glory in the power of the
[32:34] cross in every victory
[32:40] let it be said of me
[32:44] my source of strength
[32:48] my source of hope is
[32:56] can we say amen to that amen hallelujah
[32:59] we have no other place of refuge
[33:01] amen no other no other hope
[33:06] you know we look and it's interesting
[33:09] just the nature of man i was looking a
[33:10] little article
[33:12] and uh these scientists are just sure
[33:16] that uh there's got to be life somewhere
[33:19] else
[33:20] you know out in the universe and
[33:23] i'm thankful today that we can say here
[33:25] today and say
[33:26] the life we're searching for is right
[33:29] here in jesus christ
[33:30] we don't have to go find some other
[33:32] place and
[33:34] amen god bless you to our visitors today
[33:36] amen as
[33:37] as christians as believers there's never
[33:39] a visitor in the body of christ we're
[33:41] we're all one amen happy father's day
[33:45] god bless you my brothers uh just
[33:48] the very plan of god this deceit
[33:51] and uh you know as i was studying this
[33:53] out i thought you know
[33:55] it it doesn't matter you know you say
[33:57] father's day
[33:58] so it's only for fathers but you know
[34:00] god's grace
[34:01] every young man uh every everyone
[34:06] is being trained up into that position
[34:09] amen and
[34:10] we look for that quite a few not here
[34:12] today so we just want to remember each
[34:14] and every one of them in prayer
[34:18] brother isaac and sister kristen if
[34:20] you'll it all worked out well no one was
[34:22] hurt but on their way to church this
[34:23] morning a young lady pulled out in front
[34:25] of them and
[34:26] they were in an accident so um uh
[34:30] poor little girl she was following uh
[34:34] her her father and her father turned in
[34:36] there at the lake and she didn't even
[34:37] look she just turned in behind him and
[34:39] just
[34:39] drove right in front of them and
[34:42] poor little girl her hearts broke her
[34:45] first car and
[34:46] now it's dinged we all know what that
[34:48] feels like right you know so
[34:51] anyway just remember them so hallelujah
[34:54] um brother rich sends his greetings uh
[34:58] you know uh uh brother chris come to me
[35:01] with the
[35:02] um uh thought or something burden that
[35:04] was on his heart you know for the
[35:06] uh the coming uh
[35:09] church weekend camping trip um and as
[35:12] far as i know brother rich is on board
[35:14] right to that i hadn't heard
[35:16] any different and so we just definitely
[35:18] want to be praying for
[35:19] brother rich sister charity and the
[35:20] family look forward to
[35:23] all that can make it up there and i know
[35:25] some will be saying well we don't have a
[35:26] camper we don't have a tent we're not
[35:28] camping out folks but
[35:29] it's not such a bad drive and i just
[35:32] want you to think about it
[35:33] maybe you know if you can't make it
[35:35] otherwise just get up a little bit
[35:37] earlier sunday morning and
[35:38] drive up to the mountains and have
[35:40] church with with everyone
[35:43] amen let's just uh let's just
[35:46] stand as it would be i want to speak to
[35:48] you this morning
[35:49] amen uh once again in redemption's
[35:52] manifestation
[35:54] uh this whole plan of redemption my
[35:55] brother and sister is being played out
[35:58] in front of the whole world and you know
[36:00] increasingly
[36:01] as i i just look and study and follow
[36:04] these things we
[36:05] we're seeing the numbers climbing of
[36:07] young people and not just young people
[36:10] but more so in young people they're
[36:12] not even sure that there is a god
[36:14] there's been no foundation laid in their
[36:15] life that god is real that god is
[36:17] present and
[36:18] and so they've come to a stage now it's
[36:21] obviously
[36:22] uh being taught in in our uh
[36:25] our schools in higher education uh
[36:28] and uh so it's creating an atmosphere
[36:31] where in times of need people they have
[36:34] nowhere to reach out to
[36:36] they they feel uh more and more isolated
[36:39] just reading
[36:40] an article this was done uh you know
[36:43] psychology the science of the mind uh
[36:46] you know is interesting because the
[36:49] scripture
[36:50] and now i'm not doing away with the need
[36:52] for those things but the scripture
[36:54] says that we would find the mind of
[36:56] christ
[36:57] and so as we look in a world that's
[36:58] becoming increasingly caught up and
[37:01] and we're searching for answers a
[37:03] psychologist telling you
[37:05] you know this childhood memory this
[37:07] thing here this thing here this is what
[37:09] is causing this in your life
[37:11] but we serve a savior right we serve a
[37:14] god
[37:14] who said you know what i can come along
[37:16] and i can take away the pain
[37:18] of the past i can take away the hurts
[37:20] the sorrows
[37:21] i can take away the sin and and uh
[37:24] increasingly as people say well there is
[37:27] no god
[37:28] increasingly they're stepping away from
[37:32] this whole world that we have to just
[37:35] put it before the lord and trust him to
[37:38] let it go
[37:39] to let him do the work in our life and
[37:41] and so we're finding
[37:42] what is happening in the day is people
[37:44] have no release and the pressure
[37:46] is is building up you know and now i'm
[37:49] certainly believe in law and order i
[37:51] have many friends that are in law
[37:53] enforcement so i don't want this sound
[37:54] derogatory
[37:55] but when the pressure gets great that
[37:57] the police are starting to be the
[37:59] culprits in road rage
[38:01] we are over pressurized as a people and
[38:04] uh and so we're seeing that because no
[38:06] one's exempt
[38:07] and um so we're here in this day and
[38:10] and we're looking for what god would do
[38:12] and
[38:13] and uh we're seeing the signs of
[38:15] manifestation we're seeing judgment come
[38:17] on the earth
[38:18] and not making light of no one but my
[38:20] brother and sisters
[38:21] certainly what man calls a solution
[38:24] is just dig the hole deeper and it's not
[38:27] a real solution so
[38:29] i want to you know on mother's day we we
[38:32] spoke on a mother's call to action and
[38:34] today i wanted to balance that with a
[38:37] father's
[38:37] call to action and uh we want to look in
[38:41] romans the fourth
[38:42] chapter and uh we will take from that
[38:47] lay little pattern here this morning
[38:51] by god's grace we can move through
[38:53] quickly i'll leave a little bit of the
[38:55] homework to you today to go back and
[38:57] read your scriptures and and study this
[39:00] out
[39:01] so what we have here in romans the
[39:04] fourth chapter
[39:05] is the new testament foundation laid out
[39:10] of what god did to
[39:13] and through abraham now remember abraham
[39:16] himself as
[39:17] abram was just a man and he had certain
[39:21] strengths he had certain weaknesses
[39:23] but god doesn't look and say i'm going
[39:25] to choose you to be a part of
[39:27] my body or a christian because you have
[39:30] this strength
[39:32] god chose you because he chose you
[39:36] that's all that comes down to it we
[39:37] didn't have to be able to say
[39:39] well i'm a christian because
[39:42] we're christian because god chose us
[39:45] because he said
[39:46] you are my son you are my daughter you
[39:48] are my
[39:49] family and so i think that we just have
[39:52] confidence in that
[39:54] and say you know what i'm here i want to
[39:56] serve the lord because he called me
[39:58] and by god's grace something in me
[40:00] responded to that call
[40:02] isn't that beautiful hallelujah oh good
[40:04] to see brother isaac
[40:05] i see him just step in the four year
[40:07] there so happy they're here today
[40:10] let's turn in our bibles romans 4 and 1
[40:13] to start
[40:16] what shall we say then that abraham our
[40:18] father as pertaining to the flesh
[40:20] right now paul is speaking to the romans
[40:22] he's a jew
[40:24] amen pertaining to the flesh hath found
[40:27] forth abraham were justified by works
[40:31] he hath whereof to glory but not
[40:34] before god for what saith the scripture
[40:37] abraham believed god and it was
[40:40] countered unto him
[40:41] for righteousness now to him that
[40:43] worketh is the reward not reckoned of
[40:46] grace
[40:46] but of debt but to him that worketh not
[40:49] but
[40:50] believe us see god always puts a
[40:52] quantifier in there
[40:54] so it's not that we sit back and say you
[40:56] know what i don't believe in works i'm
[40:57] not gonna i'm just gonna sit back i'm
[40:59] gonna trust god
[41:00] but see you have to believe on him you
[41:04] have to
[41:05] have a faith in the work of god
[41:08] not in our own work so it's not that we
[41:10] just set back you know with our lemonade
[41:13] as it were we joke about sitting in the
[41:14] recliner with
[41:15] with our bunny slippers on and just say
[41:17] well if god wants it to happen
[41:19] it'll happen no sir my brother and
[41:22] sister you
[41:23] and i are called to fulfill our
[41:26] portion of the word of god but it won't
[41:29] be our
[41:30] works that does it because our
[41:34] works in jesus christ is actually our
[41:37] faith in his spoken word there's where
[41:40] our works is manifested
[41:42] so it's not how many tracks we hand out
[41:44] now you know there used to be a lady
[41:46] come by the house and
[41:48] and uh you know one day i kind of put a
[41:51] question to her i said so
[41:52] so tell me what what is this and she
[41:55] said well in our faith what we believe
[41:57] you know it's kind of
[41:58] uh credited to us
[42:02] by this work and so we we try to reach
[42:05] out as many people
[42:07] as we can with these tracks because it's
[42:10] and i'm like works and she goes well we
[42:12] don't view it as works
[42:14] then who's counting
[42:18] if it's not works we don't count we
[42:21] don't say i did this i did this i did
[42:23] this
[42:23] we simply look in the word of god and
[42:26] allow it to work through
[42:28] us now to him that worketh his reward
[42:32] not reckoned of grace but of debt
[42:34] but to him that worketh not but
[42:37] believeth
[42:38] on him that justify the ungodly his
[42:41] faith is counted for righteousness
[42:43] even as david also describeth the
[42:46] blessedness
[42:47] of the man unto whom god imputeth
[42:49] righteousness without works
[42:51] saying blessed are they whose iniquities
[42:54] are forgiven
[42:55] and whose sins are covered blessed is
[42:58] the man to whom
[42:59] the lord will not impute sin and i say
[43:03] truly blessed is that man
[43:05] heavenly father we just ask you lord
[43:06] jesus to come this morning
[43:08] lord this thought lord this little
[43:10] burden upon our heart we just ask you
[43:12] lord help us to express it
[43:14] that it might be a blessing to your
[43:15] people and encouragement lord
[43:17] as we press to the mark of the high
[43:19] calling lord we know that
[43:21] lord the life that we're living is your
[43:24] life lord we know that the works that we
[43:26] do are your works
[43:27] for father we simply lord are the
[43:30] ungodly
[43:30] and lord we have no ability within
[43:33] ourself but what you have placed there
[43:35] and lord i say this morning that gives
[43:38] us
[43:39] great ability because you are an awesome
[43:41] god a great god and
[43:42] father not weak lord but you have
[43:45] overcome all things and you have poured
[43:47] your very spirit your very mind into
[43:49] this body of believers
[43:50] lord that we can stand upon the word
[43:52] full of faith believing confessing and
[43:55] acting on the word of god
[43:56] that you might receive glory father ask
[43:59] you to be with those here this morning
[44:01] and lord those that are on vacation and
[44:03] traveling and family and whatever
[44:04] circumstance might be
[44:06] lord bless them all we ask and bless our
[44:08] visitors in the name of jesus christ
[44:10] amen you may be seated now i have quite
[44:14] lengthy scripture today and i hope you
[44:16] don't mind as we will
[44:18] look into that i just want to as i said
[44:21] speak to you
[44:22] on a father's call to action and to see
[44:25] how the foundation is laid god always
[44:27] gives us a godly example
[44:30] you know we are not my brother and
[44:31] sister as the scripture says there's
[44:33] nothing new
[44:34] under the sun so we are not treading uh
[44:37] on
[44:37] on a new gospel we are just coming and
[44:41] the gospel is being made applicable to
[44:43] the day that we live in
[44:45] now you know science says that there was
[44:47] great things happened in the days of the
[44:49] pyramids you know
[44:51] they keep saying that we don't have the
[44:53] technology in the day that we live in
[44:56] to to build the pyramids as they are
[44:58] built and
[44:59] so we look at that and realize the great
[45:02] things that are happening
[45:03] in the day that we live uh are not the
[45:06] greatest
[45:07] things that have ever happened man tends
[45:09] to think that we have
[45:10] reached a pinnacle but if we actually
[45:13] had reached a pinnacle
[45:14] then our nation would truly from top to
[45:17] bottom
[45:18] east to west would be entirely serving
[45:21] god we would not have
[45:23] uh the debauchery and all of the things
[45:25] that are in the world today on
[45:27] in our nation today if we had reached a
[45:29] pinnacle in fact
[45:31] i won't quote who this minister is you
[45:33] would probably recognize his name
[45:35] he said while man is touting his
[45:37] accomplishments
[45:38] god is looking at his failures and
[45:41] uh so we look at that and realize that
[45:44] in the failures of man
[45:46] what does it come down to well we know
[45:47] that the failures of man is our failure
[45:50] to be obedient to the word of god
[45:52] and when man is committed or completely
[45:55] subservient to god now god's not looking
[45:58] for people that serve him
[46:01] 50 of the time or 75 percent of the time
[46:05] or 80 or 90 or 99 god's looking for
[46:08] people that serve him
[46:09] 100 of the time and and so
[46:12] you know you look at that and i thank
[46:14] the lord as we look in the scripture
[46:16] today
[46:17] amen that uh you know we look here and
[46:20] realize
[46:21] that uh god does not impute sin to
[46:24] you and i and our iniquities are
[46:26] forgiven and our sins are covered
[46:29] and i i have to just say thank you lord
[46:31] for that because i know that
[46:34] while we can talk in a realm of uh we're
[46:37] all perfect and we're all whatever
[46:39] as far as i know we're all still human
[46:41] and so
[46:42] humans make mistakes but um thank the
[46:44] lord today for his grace and mercy
[46:46] that covers our mistakes amen i want to
[46:49] go on into verse 9
[46:51] and and we'll finish up and go into our
[46:53] thought today cometh this blessedness
[46:55] then upon the circumcision only or upon
[46:58] the uncircumcision also
[47:00] for we say that faith uh was reckoned to
[47:03] abraham
[47:04] for righteousness how was it then
[47:06] reckoned when he was in circumcision or
[47:09] in uncircumcision
[47:10] not in circumcision but in
[47:12] uncircumcision
[47:14] so when god was dealing with abraham it
[47:16] was not after his life was perfect
[47:19] god dealt with abraham in his base human
[47:22] nature his position
[47:24] and god says you know what i'm a great
[47:26] enough god and i know who you
[47:28] are amen can someone say amen this
[47:31] morning
[47:31] he knows who you are and god says i'll
[47:34] come and deal with you wherever because
[47:36] i truly know who you are
[47:38] not in the image we see ourself in the
[47:40] mirror in the morning
[47:42] but in the image that god looks at us
[47:44] and we know that god looks upon the
[47:45] hearts and
[47:46] so as we see our failures and we see our
[47:48] circumstance
[47:49] god looks beyond all of that and says i
[47:51] know who you are just as he looked at
[47:53] abraham and said abraham
[47:54] i know who you really are amen how was
[47:57] it then reckoned when he was in
[47:58] circumcision
[47:59] no uncircumcision amen thank you lord
[48:02] and he received the sign of circumcision
[48:05] a seal of the righteousness of the faith
[48:08] which he had yet being uncircumcised
[48:10] that he might be the father of all them
[48:13] that believe and isn't this beautiful
[48:15] how we can see
[48:17] the promise it was given in the old
[48:18] testament there in genesis
[48:20] how that he was promised to be the
[48:22] father and that his seed would be as
[48:24] seeds uh sands of the shore and and my
[48:28] brother and sister some people say well
[48:30] you know the world's not covered up as
[48:32] it were with millions of jews or
[48:34] but you see it moved from just a
[48:37] a lineage of a nation or a bloodline or
[48:41] a people
[48:42] and it moved into a spiritual realm of
[48:44] sons and daughters of god and
[48:46] so that he is now in the realm of faith
[48:50] amen in the realm of of uh coming into
[48:53] righteousness he is the father uh
[48:56] by faith of every believer on the face
[48:59] of the earth today
[49:00] and so it's there though they be not
[49:02] circumcised that righteousness might be
[49:04] imputed unto them
[49:06] also and the father of circumcision to
[49:09] them who are not of the circumcision
[49:11] only
[49:12] but also who also walk in the steps of
[49:14] that faith
[49:15] of our father abraham which he had
[49:18] been yet uncircumcised for the promised
[49:22] that he should be the heir of the world
[49:26] was not to abraham or to his seed
[49:31] through the law
[49:36] i had a cousin many years ago i was very
[49:40] happy that she
[49:41] finally found her way from that mountain
[49:44] but she
[49:44] joined a group and
[49:48] the basic premise of this group was that
[49:52] to really follow god have to go back
[49:55] and we have to follow every law
[49:59] through the old testament and suddenly
[50:02] they were not wearing these clothes and
[50:04] not eating this and not doing this and
[50:06] not doing that
[50:07] and yet you know as i tried to speak to
[50:09] my cousin i did speak to her but to
[50:12] get her to see that we are not bound in
[50:16] the law
[50:17] the the scripture so plainly says jesus
[50:19] said this he goes uh
[50:21] i didn't come to do away with the law
[50:24] but i come to magnify the law and the
[50:27] law being magnified my brother and
[50:29] sister
[50:30] was not the law itself the purpose that
[50:33] god had for you and i
[50:34] and what he was doing was as the
[50:36] scripture also declares to us
[50:38] he was moving away now the ten
[50:40] commandments so i won't be mis
[50:42] understood this morning the ten
[50:44] commandments are just as applicable this
[50:46] morning as they ever were
[50:47] but it went away from something written
[50:50] as it were on tables of stone
[50:52] or written on a page and god said i'm
[50:54] going to write this
[50:55] on the tables of your heart and so we
[50:58] sit here today with this written on the
[51:00] table of our heart
[51:01] not that we have to pack around some
[51:04] kind of rule book but it becomes a very
[51:06] nature of the individual the believer
[51:09] when he
[51:10] sees the world in its condition and he
[51:13] recognizes that by the word of god he
[51:16] has been
[51:16] pulled or separated from that can
[51:19] someone say thank you lord for the
[51:20] separating of the word
[51:22] amen because otherwise we would be just
[51:24] caught up in the same religious spirits
[51:26] under the same thing basically just
[51:28] saying oh
[51:29] we believe jesus christ exists we
[51:32] believe in god so therefore we're
[51:33] christians
[51:34] my brother sister the word of god says
[51:36] we'll take on his nature
[51:38] we'll take on his mind that will have
[51:40] the very heart of god and when you think
[51:42] about that my brother and sister
[51:44] this is a side note you can study out
[51:46] you think about that now the word of god
[51:48] shows us how the very nature of god
[51:51] god's own
[51:52] heart
[51:56] and then he says david was a man after
[51:59] my own heart this was not something he
[52:03] was fond i you know i like his response
[52:05] in crisis
[52:06] i like his management his leadership
[52:08] abilities i like the way he dresses i
[52:11] like no my brother sister that's not
[52:12] what he's talking about
[52:13] he was talking a man who had been tapped
[52:15] into the very spirit of god
[52:17] and he got so into that now we can look
[52:20] at our bible and recognize
[52:22] david was not without failures david was
[52:24] not without mistakes david was not
[52:26] without things
[52:27] that we would look at and say that looks
[52:28] like sin to me but you see he had tapped
[52:31] into the very
[52:32] nature and he knew and god looked down
[52:34] and said david's heart
[52:36] longs and is like my heart
[52:39] oh god help us this morning to have that
[52:41] very nature and heart of almighty god
[52:43] amen to be able to tap into that and god
[52:46] then when david tapped into that he was
[52:49] able
[52:50] oh my goodness we look at bathsheba and
[52:52] we look at all of that
[52:53] look at a prophet coming to david and
[52:55] saying you know david
[52:56] there's this man and he has come and
[52:59] while he had many sheep he has
[53:01] desired and coveted and taken the sheep
[53:04] the only sheep
[53:05] of another man and david's heart didn't
[53:08] say oh my well that's life
[53:11] david's heart went that man deserves
[53:14] judgment
[53:15] that man tell me who he is and we'll
[53:17] meet out judgment to him and a prophet
[53:19] says david it's you
[53:20] and he doesn't say well i'm justified
[53:22] i'm the king
[53:24] he goes oh god forgive me you see there
[53:27] was the heart
[53:28] there's where he tapped into the very
[53:30] spirit of god it wasn't
[53:32] a defensive hey look i'm justified in
[53:34] doing this i'm the king i'm important
[53:36] i'm special
[53:36] i'm no it was there he recognized oh god
[53:39] forgive me this wasn't right
[53:41] but you see he got caught in the spirit
[53:42] of the day he got caught in the spirit
[53:44] of the occasion
[53:45] and bathsheba i don't think she probably
[53:46] was some ugly woman right
[53:48] so he got caught up let's just say it
[53:50] like it is in the lust of the flesh
[53:51] and he looked at her but when he
[53:53] realized how wrong he was
[53:56] his heart come out and said god forgive
[53:59] me
[54:03] lord help us to have that kind of heart
[54:07] help us lord to be able to stand on the
[54:09] word and
[54:10] when the word corrects us right now this
[54:13] is a little deviation more homework if
[54:15] you want to look it up
[54:16] amen the scripture says that the lord
[54:19] chastens those
[54:23] he loves he doesn't give any other
[54:26] reason he doesn't say i chasten those
[54:28] that go to church faithfully
[54:30] i chasten those who give a lot of tithe
[54:32] i chasten those that this and memorize
[54:34] and do all of these things
[54:36] he said i chasten those i love
[54:40] so what is it god pouring his own heart
[54:42] out to you and i
[54:43] and he comes and because he loves us and
[54:46] he's pouring his own heart
[54:47] into us his own nature his own spirit he
[54:50] says then i'm going to chasten you
[54:51] because i want you to line up
[54:53] i want you to be a part of my word i
[54:55] want you to be the picture perfect
[54:58] image of who i am see
[55:01] we can hold her hand up my brother and
[55:02] sister is this a picture-perfect image
[55:06] no it isn't but you see
[55:10] i hope this is something that resonates
[55:12] with you
[55:13] you can't just be following christ and
[55:16] be a picture perfect image
[55:18] you realize that i hope you i hope you
[55:20] see this you can't just follow christ
[55:22] and be a picture-perfect image
[55:23] it's only when you turn and have a
[55:26] face-to-face
[55:28] personal relationship with him
[55:31] that you then become the picture-perfect
[55:33] image of god
[55:36] but so many people say but i'm following
[55:38] i've been our family
[55:39] has been in this church and in this
[55:40] church in 40 years 50 years 75 years
[55:44] my brother and sister just following
[55:46] going to church isn't going to do it
[55:48] it's that face-to-face relationship
[55:50] that brings us into the perfect image of
[55:52] jesus christ
[55:54] and so we live in a world increasingly
[55:56] and yes this is
[55:59] kind of direct
[56:04] we can count numbers of which the
[56:07] scripture actually speaks again
[56:10] counting the numbers and we can boast of
[56:13] the numbers
[56:18] but are they just followers
[56:21] or have they had a relationship
[56:27] i tell you you take this back to the
[56:30] military i love to read military history
[56:34] a man was a navy seal
[56:38] and he made a statement
[56:42] give me seven men who are bonded
[56:46] together
[56:48] and we will accomplish more than 150 men
[56:53] that have no unity
[56:57] think about it seven holy ghost-filled
[57:00] people will do more
[57:02] than a whole church full of people who
[57:04] are there for a program or there because
[57:06] it's the social or
[57:07] it's there because of whatever and you
[57:10] look at this
[57:11] now i better get moving along here i
[57:13] mean it's father's day and we can't
[57:15] can't keep you all day right amen
[57:21] you know i have to be honest with you
[57:22] you know i am talking on the phone to a
[57:25] brother the other day and he goes
[57:26] man brother paul that was a really good
[57:28] service you preached but it was kind of
[57:30] long
[57:31] ah look you guys are supposed to have
[57:35] grace and mercy on me i can't help it i
[57:37] get excited about these things and
[57:38] there's more things to
[57:40] pile on the table imagine if i was the
[57:42] one doing the buffet
[57:43] and you didn't leave until you'd eaten
[57:45] every portion
[57:47] you might want to bring a pillow blanket
[57:49] with you
[57:51] amen so as we look at this let me
[57:55] just focus right here real quick
[57:58] for the promise that he should be heir
[58:00] of the world was not
[58:01] to abraham or to his seed through the
[58:04] law
[58:05] we'll never accomplish that through the
[58:06] law but through the righteousness of
[58:09] faith for if they which are of the law
[58:12] be heirs
[58:13] faith is made void and the promise made
[58:17] of none effect now you're probably
[58:19] wondering brother paul this doesn't
[58:20] sound like a father's day sermon well it
[58:22] really is my brother and sister because
[58:24] here he is abraham accounted to be the
[58:27] father of the nations god laying out
[58:29] this very foundation
[58:31] of faith and presenting it to the world
[58:34] through a man that he said
[58:35] would be a father of nations look at
[58:37] paul's account of abraham's spiritual
[58:39] position
[58:40] abraham there as a young man he gets
[58:43] married
[58:44] and uh he's he's going through life and
[58:46] then god calls him out
[58:47] now look we all know that it's this hard
[58:50] sometimes to break
[58:51] away from those things which are
[58:53] comfortable we we have our little
[58:55] patterns of life right and we come and
[58:58] you know it's kind of like hey dad has
[58:59] his favorite chair
[59:01] and the children know that when dad
[59:03] comes in the room if you're sitting in
[59:04] dad's chair you have to get up and move
[59:06] and and so we have a deference to these
[59:09] things and
[59:10] and we see how that abraham as a young
[59:12] man he's starting out in life he has a
[59:14] beautiful wife
[59:15] and uh he's he's there and then god
[59:18] calls him out
[59:18] and if we're not careful saints we will
[59:21] find ourselves in the time of life
[59:23] thinking that sometimes god has called
[59:25] you to a a
[59:27] difficult task or called you to
[59:28] something that uh
[59:30] seems to be laborious it seems to be a
[59:32] struggle
[59:33] but i'm telling you if god called you
[59:35] out then he provided a way for you
[59:38] amen and so it's there being called out
[59:41] is something we should say amen to we
[59:44] should say thank you lord i'm called out
[59:45] would one of you
[59:46] acknowledge that's the truth that we
[59:48] need to say thank you lord i'm called
[59:50] out
[59:51] because we could still be out here
[59:52] drunks in an alley or just caught up in
[59:55] all the things of the world
[59:56] not even knowing god but god loved you
[59:58] so much he says i'm going to call you
[1:00:00] out of that
[1:00:01] and i'm thankful for the spiritual
[1:00:02] pattern that was laid before us because
[1:00:05] if you
[1:00:06] look into abraham's life abram's life
[1:00:08] actually be technical at that stage
[1:00:10] and you look at that my brother and
[1:00:12] sister he was a man quite
[1:00:14] accomplished he he was gathering up
[1:00:17] things you might say
[1:00:18] becoming wealthy in the things of the
[1:00:20] world and
[1:00:21] ultimately in the end god never took
[1:00:23] that from him but what he did is he
[1:00:25] required a greater commitment from abram
[1:00:28] and as he's calling to abram abram
[1:00:30] actually did not
[1:00:31] in the beginning completely listen to
[1:00:34] god but god used
[1:00:35] those things to mold him and ultimately
[1:00:39] brought him to a place that he
[1:00:40] wanted what god was and what i'm
[1:00:42] speaking about there is lot because
[1:00:44] god told him to separate himself
[1:00:46] completely from his family
[1:00:48] but you know abram had a a affinity for
[1:00:51] lot and
[1:00:52] he takes him with him but as the years
[1:00:55] go on there becomes a friction
[1:00:57] and i say thank you lord sometimes hard
[1:01:00] for us to really
[1:01:01] accept that but there are people that
[1:01:03] are detrimental in our life there are
[1:01:05] things that are detrimental in our life
[1:01:07] and god starts to create a friction in
[1:01:10] that
[1:01:10] that causes a separation and while abram
[1:01:13] felt committed to
[1:01:15] lot to help take care of him god allows
[1:01:17] that friction to come to a place because
[1:01:20] god's prophecy or god's word for for
[1:01:22] abram abraham
[1:01:24] to to come to pass he had to come into a
[1:01:26] certain position
[1:01:27] the friction is there one day it comes
[1:01:30] such that they stand there and they look
[1:01:31] down into the well-watered plains and
[1:01:34] they look out into the dry dusty lands
[1:01:36] and
[1:01:37] abram says you know what lot you take
[1:01:39] your position
[1:01:40] whatever you will do i will do the
[1:01:42] opposite but that really my brother and
[1:01:44] sister was
[1:01:44] easier for abraham to say than we think
[1:01:48] because he in his heart knew
[1:01:51] what lot would choose
[1:01:55] would he choose the harder way
[1:02:02] now this sounds judgmental but the word
[1:02:04] bears it out
[1:02:06] lot was actually a sunday christian
[1:02:12] he could deal his relationship with god
[1:02:16] he could fill that relationship up on
[1:02:18] sunday
[1:02:21] some might say well that's incredible
[1:02:22] that's awesome that's good that's my
[1:02:24] kind of
[1:02:25] but you see god was looking for someone
[1:02:27] that wanted a everyday relationship
[1:02:30] he was looking for someone that would be
[1:02:32] dependent enough
[1:02:34] to say you know what i don't just need
[1:02:36] god on sunday i need him
[1:02:37] every day of the week amen so it was
[1:02:40] there that this spiritual pattern is now
[1:02:42] laid out for us
[1:02:44] now look my brother and sister we see
[1:02:46] this promise coming down
[1:02:47] a promised child that was promised to
[1:02:49] abraham and sarah
[1:02:51] and in that you look at that and realize
[1:02:53] now this is about a child and
[1:02:55] and those that families that desire to
[1:02:58] have children
[1:02:59] can't uh certainly would be able to
[1:03:02] relate to this much more maybe than some
[1:03:04] of us would
[1:03:05] but you look at this and realize my
[1:03:07] brother and sister as god made a promise
[1:03:09] to abraham and sarah
[1:03:10] now it's there that we find that was
[1:03:13] abraham just flawless in his following
[1:03:16] of god from that day on
[1:03:17] no my brother and sister he comes down a
[1:03:19] king looks upon his wife she's fair
[1:03:21] what it is is we saw body change taking
[1:03:24] place
[1:03:25] now abraham is here living with his wife
[1:03:29] and he's missing the fulfillment of the
[1:03:32] promise of god it was so
[1:03:33] subtle and so slow just like the things
[1:03:37] god is doing in your life
[1:03:38] he is changing us sometimes so slowly
[1:03:42] we as an individual don't even recognize
[1:03:44] what god is doing
[1:03:45] and so we're going along saying lord
[1:03:47] help me i have certain things maybe i'm
[1:03:50] impatient maybe i have this maybe
[1:03:52] whatever it but we don't recognize that
[1:03:54] god is
[1:03:55] changing us but others on the outside
[1:03:58] are
[1:03:58] and i'm telling you when you have a king
[1:04:00] that looks in an old lady
[1:04:03] it's kind of kind of blunt way to put it
[1:04:04] isn't it a king looks at an old lady and
[1:04:06] says she's so beautiful i want to make
[1:04:08] her my wife
[1:04:09] he was seeing something different than
[1:04:11] abraham was
[1:04:13] oh i'm telling you what my brother and
[1:04:15] sister you go out here in the world
[1:04:17] today
[1:04:18] and they will look at you and might say
[1:04:19] well you're just a christian you're a
[1:04:21] little fanatical you pray you read your
[1:04:23] bible
[1:04:23] you live different than everyone else
[1:04:26] but god's looking down and he's seeing
[1:04:28] something different than the rest of the
[1:04:30] world is seeing
[1:04:31] god's seeing a bride by the word of god
[1:04:34] by revelations 19
[1:04:35] being transformed she's making herself
[1:04:38] ready and god says that's
[1:04:40] beauty in my eyes the world sees a bunch
[1:04:42] of religious freaks that are well there
[1:04:44] they're just
[1:04:44] we don't understand that what do we need
[1:04:46] a god for let's go have fun
[1:04:56] but every one of us that god has called
[1:05:00] made a promise to us every one of us
[1:05:04] the spiritual pattern has been laid upon
[1:05:07] us
[1:05:08] you realize my brother and sister this
[1:05:10] spiritual pattern of the word has been
[1:05:11] laid upon us
[1:05:12] and everything that's outside of the
[1:05:14] pattern of god's word
[1:05:16] god is cutting it away slow but sure god
[1:05:19] is cutting it away
[1:05:20] because we will be in the image of
[1:05:22] christ the perfect image not close
[1:05:25] we joke my brother and sister that it's
[1:05:27] not about china's ability to innovate
[1:05:30] but it's about their ability to
[1:05:32] impersonate
[1:05:35] and you look in the world today you can
[1:05:37] give china
[1:05:38] anything anything
[1:05:41] and they will build you the replica of
[1:05:44] it
[1:05:46] and if they wanted to the replica could
[1:05:48] be just as good as the original
[1:05:51] but they don't really have a desire to
[1:05:53] build something good
[1:05:55] they have a desire to replicate it
[1:05:58] mass produce it and distribute it
[1:06:02] everywhere
[1:06:03] now if you all forgive me this morning i
[1:06:06] just want to liken that you say brother
[1:06:07] paul why are you talking about china and
[1:06:08] what they build
[1:06:10] because satan has that same pattern that
[1:06:13] he's replicating people
[1:06:14] that look walk and talk and he's filling
[1:06:18] it up he's flooding it over the world
[1:06:20] and the scripture says that they have a
[1:06:22] form of godliness
[1:06:24] they're not a mass a a aberration from
[1:06:28] a christian they have that form my
[1:06:31] brother and sister but they deny the
[1:06:32] power thereof so therefore
[1:06:34] they're just close it's not the original
[1:06:36] it's not the real thing
[1:06:38] it's just close and what god is looking
[1:06:40] for is the original seed
[1:06:42] in you and i is looking for original
[1:06:44] life in us
[1:06:46] hallelujah he's not looking for just
[1:06:48] filling the building
[1:06:50] he's looking for those people that will
[1:06:52] follow day and night good and bad and
[1:06:54] when the sun is shining and when it's
[1:06:56] cloudy and whatever it is and
[1:06:58] and so we see now as abraham coming to
[1:07:01] this place
[1:07:06] you see there's something special about
[1:07:07] being able to look to the promise
[1:07:11] now this would be personal with each one
[1:07:12] of you you'll have different
[1:07:13] circumstances
[1:07:14] but i just want to ask you this morning
[1:07:16] have you ever come to a place in your
[1:07:18] life
[1:07:19] that god started dealing with you on
[1:07:21] something
[1:07:22] and you knew that word was for you
[1:07:27] you know not pitchfork religion right
[1:07:29] where we sit here and go
[1:07:31] well lucy the pastor just said this
[1:07:35] i think that applies to them
[1:07:40] oh that was blunt yeah
[1:07:43] that belongs over here
[1:07:48] come on oh smile at me
[1:07:51] you've fought it you've thought it
[1:07:55] i hope brother so and so i hope sister
[1:07:58] so and so
[1:07:59] i hope they caught that
[1:08:02] well you didn't because you didn't have
[1:08:04] your hands out to catch it
[1:08:06] you were just gonna pass it along to who
[1:08:08] you thought it applied to
[1:08:12] whoa hallelujah
[1:08:16] i saw from the looks on all your faces
[1:08:18] that you were saying amen even though
[1:08:19] you didn't voice it
[1:08:25] but you see what we got to do my brother
[1:08:27] and sister is not just look and say oh
[1:08:30] god is good and god will do this and god
[1:08:32] will do that and god thomas says
[1:08:34] but you got to be able to look to that
[1:08:36] promise yourself
[1:08:37] and it might be blunt straight to your
[1:08:39] face
[1:08:40] amen like one man said once he says some
[1:08:42] of these christians sitting in church
[1:08:44] need a hatchet to the forehead i was
[1:08:48] like
[1:08:48] wow that's blunt and he said but some of
[1:08:52] you are so
[1:08:52] hard-headed that's what it would take to
[1:08:55] get your attention
[1:08:59] amen amen
[1:09:02] amen amen amen
[1:09:06] brother ivan bring the box of hatchets
[1:09:15] will we be honest this morning and say
[1:09:17] sometimes looking to the promise
[1:09:19] could be pretty hard
[1:09:22] the promise is right in front of us
[1:09:25] god said it maybe it's our healing maybe
[1:09:28] it's deliverance from something in our
[1:09:29] family
[1:09:30] maybe we have children or a parent or a
[1:09:34] spouse
[1:09:35] that's not serving god we look at that
[1:09:38] and it just appears that nothing's
[1:09:40] changing
[1:09:42] nothing's changing
[1:09:45] what is the promise of the word say them
[1:09:48] do we sit here and
[1:09:50] do nothing do we sit here and just
[1:09:54] hope or
[1:09:57] do we look to the promise now when we
[1:10:00] look to the promise my brother
[1:10:02] and sister that doesn't mean that we
[1:10:03] just obliterate everything else and we
[1:10:05] don't do this
[1:10:06] you know it reminds me of a man that i
[1:10:09] knew a brother
[1:10:10] had cancer and and people were like oh
[1:10:13] brother
[1:10:13] it don't seem like you believe for your
[1:10:15] healing because this brother talk about
[1:10:17] his cancer all the time he's like yeah
[1:10:19] the doctor says it's moved from here to
[1:10:21] my liver and now it's going to move to
[1:10:23] here
[1:10:23] and and you know that's what the doctor
[1:10:25] says there's nothing they can do about
[1:10:27] it
[1:10:28] amen but what they failed to recognize
[1:10:30] he as a man was talking about the
[1:10:32] circumstance he didn't take
[1:10:34] and put his head in the sand over here
[1:10:37] and say
[1:10:38] now no i have no cancer i have no cancer
[1:10:40] he was acknowledging that
[1:10:42] it's demon as it were that's what the
[1:10:44] bible calls it this demon cancer
[1:10:47] was in his body he wasn't hiding the
[1:10:49] circumstance
[1:10:50] he was doing that amen he didn't deny
[1:10:53] the circumstance by putting his head in
[1:10:55] the sand
[1:10:56] but he chose by faith this brother i can
[1:10:58] speak of this
[1:10:59] god healed him he chose by
[1:11:03] faith to look beyond yeah most people
[1:11:05] are like well he sure seems caught up in
[1:11:07] talking about his cancer yeah the doctor
[1:11:09] said this and this is
[1:11:10] they got this x-ray and they did this
[1:11:11] mri and they did this and they did this
[1:11:13] and blah blah blah and they're like oh
[1:11:14] my goodness oh my goodness
[1:11:16] he needs to have faith see they failed
[1:11:19] to understand that him acknowledging
[1:11:21] there was a certain thing right here
[1:11:23] you know kind of reminds me there's a
[1:11:25] man i haven't seen
[1:11:27] anything from him uh posted or or
[1:11:29] whatever for a long time
[1:11:31] but he would be there and he was talking
[1:11:33] about faith and he was talking about
[1:11:34] those things that are as though they are
[1:11:36] not and those things that are not as
[1:11:38] though they are
[1:11:39] and as he's speaking he reaches over and
[1:11:41] pulls off his fake arm
[1:11:44] and he says sometimes and he holds up
[1:11:46] this stub sometimes you've got to
[1:11:49] acknowledge
[1:11:50] those things that are not
[1:11:57] and then he turned right around and says
[1:12:00] but i serve a god who's a healer whether
[1:12:03] you believe
[1:12:04] in that or not that's the god i serve
[1:12:08] this brother i was telling you about he
[1:12:10] was talking about yeah
[1:12:11] yep this cancer this this and people
[1:12:13] question this
[1:12:15] and then the brother comes along one day
[1:12:18] and he makes a declaration
[1:12:20] he says above and beyond
[1:12:24] all else my god
[1:12:28] is a healer now speaking
[1:12:32] revelation to his soul not i hope he is
[1:12:35] or the word
[1:12:36] says he is now you want to catch the
[1:12:37] difference right words
[1:12:40] the significance of words my god
[1:12:43] is not the word says he is or someone
[1:12:46] else says he is
[1:12:47] my god possessive right forget my
[1:12:50] english it wasn't very good
[1:12:52] but it was possessive my god
[1:12:55] is a healer
[1:12:58] and people are like boy that brother
[1:13:00] shouldn't even talk about he shouldn't
[1:13:01] even acknowledge he has cancers he
[1:13:03] he's like giving glory to the devil or
[1:13:05] something you know he shouldn't do that
[1:13:07] no what he was doing was saying i have
[1:13:08] this but my god's a healer this is what
[1:13:11] i really have
[1:13:12] this is what i have is faith i have
[1:13:14] faith that my god is a healer and i have
[1:13:16] faith that my god is perfect and i have
[1:13:18] faith that god's will
[1:13:20] be done and one day he goes to the
[1:13:22] doctor and the doctor says we're going
[1:13:23] to do another test on you
[1:13:25] and he's like oh my the devil tried to
[1:13:26] inject into him oh
[1:13:28] what's wrong what's wrong what's wrong
[1:13:29] they're doing another test and the
[1:13:31] doctor comes back
[1:13:32] and says do you mind we want to do an
[1:13:33] extensive test on you
[1:13:35] and we want to open you up and go in and
[1:13:37] take another biopsy
[1:13:38] and the devil trying to inject that oh
[1:13:41] my this cancer probably blew up
[1:13:43] or something and he was like nope i
[1:13:45] refuse to accept that see
[1:13:46] he had a balance in there he says i
[1:13:48] refuse to accept that because my body is
[1:13:50] a healer
[1:13:52] and ultimately the doctors come back and
[1:13:54] say we cannot explain this
[1:13:56] but you are cancer-free
[1:14:02] and then he moved into an opposite realm
[1:14:05] and people are like
[1:14:06] what happened well i was praying and i
[1:14:11] know sir my god is a healer
[1:14:15] how god healed me what god did
[1:14:19] i don't need to know what i know is he
[1:14:22] healed me so
[1:14:23] you see you can acknowledge the
[1:14:25] circumstance that is around your life
[1:14:27] look my brother and sister if you have
[1:14:29] anger you don't have to act like you
[1:14:30] don't have anger
[1:14:31] if you have a a temper you don't have to
[1:14:34] act like you don't have a temper
[1:14:36] you might as well stand up this bible
[1:14:38] says confess your faults one to another
[1:14:40] you might as well stand up and say
[1:14:41] hey church pray for me i have a temper
[1:14:45] church pray for me i have this problem
[1:14:47] church pray for me i have this problem
[1:14:49] but you see we're still too proud
[1:14:52] and while we only are fooling ourself
[1:14:54] because we have our head in the sand
[1:14:57] our circumstance is still there you can
[1:14:58] embrace your circumstance
[1:15:01] are you with me maybe maybe that comes a
[1:15:04] different way than you're used to
[1:15:05] hearing it
[1:15:06] you can embrace your circumstances i
[1:15:08] need god to touch me i have a blood
[1:15:10] sugar issue
[1:15:11] amen i probably don't help it you know
[1:15:13] sometimes you know if there's like a
[1:15:14] cinnamon roll
[1:15:16] or something and i hear it calling me oh
[1:15:18] paul
[1:15:20] oh paul and sister jerry goes out in the
[1:15:25] garage and i can't help it to the cyrene
[1:15:28] song and i go over there and i'm like
[1:15:30] honey these cinnamon rolls are
[1:15:32] so good and she's like get out of it
[1:15:34] that wasn't for you
[1:15:37] i couldn't help myself
[1:15:41] but i'll tell you even standing here
[1:15:43] this morning my god is a healer
[1:15:46] i am healed in the name of jesus christ
[1:15:50] prick my finger and the little digital
[1:15:51] thing will give you a number that you'll
[1:15:53] all go
[1:15:54] ah paul
[1:16:01] but that has nothing to do with the fact
[1:16:02] my god is a healer
[1:16:06] you see abraham's getting old sarah's
[1:16:09] getting old
[1:16:14] couldn't forget that
[1:16:21] i find humor in this sister jerry i'm
[1:16:23] honestly i'm not throwing my wife under
[1:16:24] the bus but
[1:16:26] i looked this morning i was looking in
[1:16:29] the mirror
[1:16:31] and i i was like oh my
[1:16:34] oh my lord help us i told sister jerry i
[1:16:37] said i wouldn't be in this condition if
[1:16:39] you would quit having birthdays
[1:16:42] see it wasn't my fault it's her fault
[1:16:44] she's the one having the birthdays
[1:16:48] but none of that changes my brother and
[1:16:49] sister because you see we can
[1:16:52] not try and hide the circumstance not
[1:16:53] deny that's
[1:16:55] head in the sand but we choose by faith
[1:16:59] to look beyond that circumstance
[1:17:03] my sister deborah walker passed away
[1:17:07] breaks my heart she was a unique lady
[1:17:10] amen she was of a rugged personality you
[1:17:14] might say
[1:17:16] you know australians and you know
[1:17:18] they're just a
[1:17:19] different kind of people so you know
[1:17:22] they
[1:17:22] they lived in australia and new zealand
[1:17:25] so you taken
[1:17:26] hybrid an aussie with a kiwi and
[1:17:29] you end up with people that will tell
[1:17:31] you what they think
[1:17:32] you ought to hear whether you like it or
[1:17:34] not
[1:17:35] and they won't hesitate to tell you what
[1:17:37] they think you need to hear
[1:17:40] but god bless her because she stood
[1:17:42] right here in these last moments when
[1:17:44] people were
[1:17:45] were saying oh this is so terrible and
[1:17:47] she's like what do you mean terrible
[1:17:49] i'm right on the doorstep of looking my
[1:17:52] savior face to face i'm right on the
[1:17:54] doorstep of glory
[1:17:56] and you're telling me this is terrible
[1:17:59] i'm sorry i'm looking at this picture
[1:18:01] differently than you are
[1:18:05] god help us to be able to look at the
[1:18:06] picture in the correct fashion
[1:18:08] help us to be able to look at that and
[1:18:10] get our head out of the sand and realize
[1:18:12] that
[1:18:13] our faith is what matters it's not our
[1:18:15] circumstance at all
[1:18:17] amen now let me repeat this to you
[1:18:21] you have to i have to look to the
[1:18:23] promise
[1:18:25] because your circumstance will overwhelm
[1:18:28] you
[1:18:32] for christian we have no other place to
[1:18:35] look
[1:18:37] okay right we're preaching to the
[1:18:39] fathers this morning aren't we
[1:18:43] hallelujah well
[1:18:47] i'm going to skip over some of this kind
[1:18:48] of quickly here
[1:18:51] because you know me i get started and
[1:18:53] somebody stole the time already
[1:18:55] because the law worketh wrath for where
[1:18:58] no law is there is no transgression
[1:19:00] therefore it is of faith that it might
[1:19:02] be by grace
[1:19:03] to the end that the promise might be
[1:19:05] sure to all the seed
[1:19:07] not that only which is of the law but
[1:19:09] also to that which is of faith of
[1:19:11] abraham
[1:19:12] who is the father of us all
[1:19:15] as is written i've made thee a father of
[1:19:17] many nations
[1:19:18] before him whom he believed even god who
[1:19:21] quickened the dead
[1:19:22] and called those things which be not as
[1:19:25] though
[1:19:25] they were now in the world we live in
[1:19:27] today my brother and sister
[1:19:29] there is a term that is used i think it
[1:19:32] is used way too extensively
[1:19:34] and often oftentimes the people are
[1:19:36] using it it applies to them and they
[1:19:37] fail to realize that
[1:19:39] and that is cognitive dissonance and
[1:19:41] cognitive dissonance is basically in
[1:19:43] just laymen terms
[1:19:44] you failing to recognize what is in
[1:19:47] front of you
[1:19:48] and so the world would say today you
[1:19:50] know what you suffer from cognitive
[1:19:52] dissonance
[1:19:53] because you're denying this that and the
[1:19:54] other well my brother and sister
[1:19:56] i have a scriptural uh uh directive
[1:20:00] to deny what is in front of me i look in
[1:20:03] this my brother and sister
[1:20:05] and as we see our nation dissolving into
[1:20:07] chaos
[1:20:08] now we live here in treasure valley
[1:20:10] we're here
[1:20:11] and we say my what is happening some of
[1:20:13] this is overdone
[1:20:14] but you know if you live in other cities
[1:20:17] seattle portland detroit chicago
[1:20:20] baltimore milwaukee
[1:20:21] et cetera et cetera they have a whole
[1:20:23] different reality i say thank you lord
[1:20:25] for the state of idaho
[1:20:27] amen i thank you lord for where you
[1:20:28] called us to because my brother and
[1:20:30] sister you see
[1:20:31] the chaos that's taking place in the
[1:20:34] world around us
[1:20:35] is the fulfillment of the word of god
[1:20:38] but you and i
[1:20:39] are also fulfilling the word of god this
[1:20:41] morning because we are standing here
[1:20:44] saying amen and so be it to the word
[1:20:47] and the word is transforming us we're
[1:20:48] not the same person
[1:20:50] and so as we'll see here what god was
[1:20:52] doing in abraham
[1:20:54] is going through all of these
[1:20:56] circumstances that he had to go through
[1:20:58] he had to go down he had to watch lot go
[1:21:00] down and
[1:21:01] end up in sodom he had to go rescue lord
[1:21:04] he had to do all of these things and
[1:21:06] they weren't just something we look at
[1:21:08] the page and say oh my look god did this
[1:21:10] god did this got this i want you to
[1:21:12] recognize this morning
[1:21:13] it's real it was just as real to them
[1:21:17] as every circumstance of your life is
[1:21:20] real to you
[1:21:21] today i don't got enough money to pay
[1:21:23] the mortgage
[1:21:24] it was just as real to them i don't have
[1:21:26] this my chariot broke
[1:21:28] down just as real to you amen all of
[1:21:30] these things are happening
[1:21:32] were applicable of the day but it is in
[1:21:34] that that god is fulfilling his call in
[1:21:37] your life
[1:21:37] and so it's there that is he is a father
[1:21:40] of nations
[1:21:40] he was there laid out now we're talking
[1:21:42] in the spiritual sense
[1:21:44] he was laid out to every circumstance
[1:21:46] but the word of god was sufficient
[1:21:49] in every circumstance in abraham's life
[1:21:53] not once did abraham come up and say god
[1:21:55] where art thou
[1:21:56] you forsaken me
[1:22:00] it was all just israel
[1:22:05] call those things which be not as though
[1:22:08] they were
[1:22:09] who against hope believed in hope that
[1:22:11] he might become the father of many
[1:22:12] nations according to that
[1:22:14] which was spoken now you want to take
[1:22:16] what was spoken
[1:22:18] go home if you want to cheat use google
[1:22:22] see what the bible says to the true
[1:22:24] believer
[1:22:25] you will overwhelmingly find hundreds
[1:22:29] upon hundreds of scripture
[1:22:31] that tells you who you are in jesus
[1:22:33] christ
[1:22:35] you see it's already been spoken saints
[1:22:37] it's a matter of you and i saying yeah i
[1:22:39] believe that
[1:22:40] that's me i'm gonna i'm gonna take that
[1:22:42] oh
[1:22:44] oh i miss david i had lust of the flesh
[1:22:47] but i repented god said you're after my
[1:22:49] heart
[1:22:50] oh i had a struggle here david wanted to
[1:22:53] do something for the lord
[1:22:55] he steps out into a position that's not
[1:22:57] his does
[1:22:58] god strike him dead no but god let
[1:23:00] someone else die so that david could
[1:23:02] realize he was out of line
[1:23:05] doesn't seem right does it but god's
[1:23:08] plan
[1:23:09] must be fulfilled because it's written
[1:23:11] because it's written saints
[1:23:18] hallelujah
[1:23:20] so shall thy seed be and being not weak
[1:23:23] in faith he considered not his own body
[1:23:25] now dead when he was about a hundred
[1:23:27] years old
[1:23:27] neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb
[1:23:30] and verse 20 says he staggered not at
[1:23:32] the promise of god
[1:23:34] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:23:35] giving glory to god
[1:23:37] and being fully persuaded what he had
[1:23:40] promised he was able to perform i want
[1:23:42] to ask you this morning are you fully
[1:23:43] persuaded
[1:23:44] amen we ought to be fully persuaded this
[1:23:47] morning there ought not be one doubt if
[1:23:48] you're a real believer a christian
[1:23:50] amen not one doubt that what god
[1:23:52] promised he will perform
[1:23:54] therefore it was imputed to him for
[1:23:56] righteousness
[1:23:57] people are doing all kinds of things for
[1:23:59] righteousness sake
[1:24:01] you know my brother and sister i was
[1:24:03] just looking at this
[1:24:04] article the other day it's been around a
[1:24:06] long time no doubt you're aware of this
[1:24:08] but there's people who so believe in the
[1:24:11] crucifixion of jesus christ
[1:24:12] this takes place in lower mexico that
[1:24:15] they literally
[1:24:16] line up they volunteer and one of them
[1:24:18] is chosen
[1:24:19] they literally nail them to a cross
[1:24:23] and drag that cross through this city
[1:24:25] and that individual they're suffering
[1:24:28] many times crippled for life afterwards
[1:24:32] but so wanting to identify
[1:24:38] aren't you glad god just gave you the
[1:24:40] opportunity to go into his word
[1:24:42] and identify with him you see
[1:24:45] that right there that kind of work will
[1:24:48] not save that man's soul
[1:24:50] will not change him his confession in
[1:24:52] jesus christ
[1:24:53] his repentance his baptism his his
[1:24:56] faithfulness to god
[1:24:58] is what will save his soul but being
[1:25:00] nailed to a cross
[1:25:01] and erected up in the city square will
[1:25:03] not save that man but they're so
[1:25:05] committed to that
[1:25:10] believing
[1:25:15] i want you to just go ahead and do the
[1:25:17] homework of the rest of these scriptures
[1:25:21] you realize the scripture imputes this
[1:25:23] to us also
[1:25:25] says this is imputed to you
[1:25:29] not your works your faith
[1:25:35] now look in genesis 22.
[1:25:40] look at that very first verse right
[1:25:41] there
[1:25:43] and we all want everything to go good
[1:25:45] for us we want it to all be so
[1:25:47] cushy and cozy dads come on dads
[1:25:50] we want it to be cushy cozy we want it
[1:25:52] for the best for our family
[1:25:54] we make all kinds of sacrifices for our
[1:25:56] family and it came to pass after these
[1:25:58] things that god did
[1:25:59] what did he do to abraham the father of
[1:26:02] our faith
[1:26:03] father of nations a spiritual example to
[1:26:06] us
[1:26:06] god tempted him in the context of
[1:26:09] scripture
[1:26:10] it was god put him to a great test
[1:26:16] but what did abraham say behold here i
[1:26:19] am
[1:26:20] he said now take my son and we'll just
[1:26:21] go through this really quick take thy
[1:26:23] son
[1:26:23] i want you to go out i want you to take
[1:26:25] him up on the mountain i want you to
[1:26:26] offer him as a sacrifice
[1:26:28] you know how hard that would have been
[1:26:30] fathers can you imagine
[1:26:33] amen i i don't just single any one of
[1:26:35] you out but we have several young
[1:26:37] boys in our in our church imagine taking
[1:26:40] uh
[1:26:40] you know samuel uh declan uh
[1:26:44] sean you're a little big but you're an
[1:26:46] only son
[1:26:48] hallelujah and and we take them
[1:26:51] and god says take them on the mountain
[1:26:52] and offer them for sacrifice
[1:26:54] fathers could we do it could we
[1:26:58] so trust god enough be so committed
[1:27:02] because you see abraham had an
[1:27:04] understanding that when god told him he
[1:27:06] said i'm through your own flesh
[1:27:08] through your own blood cell i'm going to
[1:27:12] deliver a people would we have enough
[1:27:15] faith in the hour we live in my brother
[1:27:17] and sister
[1:27:18] my my fathers would we have enough faith
[1:27:20] to trust god when he said take your son
[1:27:22] upon the mountain and offer him as a
[1:27:24] sacrifice
[1:27:24] we go down in this scripture and here we
[1:27:26] see it is
[1:27:28] that how his son even understood that
[1:27:31] and it's there he looks at this and he's
[1:27:33] got in the
[1:27:35] verses here he's got the wood and he
[1:27:37] laid it
[1:27:38] upon isaac makes isaac carry the very
[1:27:41] wood
[1:27:41] that he will lay him on for a sacrifice
[1:27:44] amen and he's got this and they went
[1:27:46] together and
[1:27:46] isaac spake and to abraham his father
[1:27:50] and said my father here am i my son
[1:27:53] he said behold the fire the wood
[1:27:57] where's the lamb see the boy's been
[1:28:00] trained well enough he knew there had to
[1:28:01] be a lamb
[1:28:03] now we weren't looking for some any old
[1:28:05] thing when we weren't throwing a book we
[1:28:07] aren't throwing a
[1:28:07] uh carving we're not throwing or
[1:28:09] whatever it's coming to a place my
[1:28:11] brother and sister
[1:28:12] he knows there has to be a lamb and
[1:28:14] abraham
[1:28:15] what's he do he so believes in god's
[1:28:17] word that he just says you know what god
[1:28:19] will provide the lamb
[1:28:21] we're going to go but i want to let me
[1:28:23] paraphrase this and shorten it so we
[1:28:25] don't get too far along here
[1:28:26] when we get to the point my brother and
[1:28:28] sister that abraham has
[1:28:30] bound isaac and laid him on the altar
[1:28:34] this wasn't a make-believe like
[1:28:36] abraham's there now okay i've got the
[1:28:37] knife in my hand
[1:28:38] and i i'm just gonna i'm just gonna wait
[1:28:41] here
[1:28:42] because there's like no way there's no
[1:28:43] way i'm offering my boy
[1:28:46] there's no way god promised me
[1:28:50] there's no way
[1:28:54] fathers do we have this kind of faith
[1:28:59] god had to stay his hand speak to him
[1:29:01] and stay his hand
[1:29:03] he believed what god spoke to him
[1:29:06] so strongly that he was
[1:29:09] fixing to offer his own son
[1:29:14] that is faith
[1:29:18] that is faith
[1:29:22] i don't think he was there thinking god
[1:29:23] was going to give him an isaac
[1:29:25] the second we'll have another child
[1:29:31] he didn't look for an explanation of how
[1:29:33] god was going to do this
[1:29:35] he believed what god told him
[1:29:40] oh my i want to be that kind of father i
[1:29:43] want to be that kind of man
[1:29:46] i want to be that my son god will
[1:29:49] provide himself for lamb for burnt
[1:29:50] offering
[1:29:51] so they both went together now let's
[1:29:54] just look at this quotation here
[1:29:56] certainly god provided god's provided
[1:29:59] lamb god's provided sacrifice said now
[1:30:01] wait moses
[1:30:02] i'll make you a type and he took the
[1:30:03] blood of this lamb killed it in the
[1:30:05] evening notice all the elders of israel
[1:30:07] had to witness to it
[1:30:08] they witnessed the death just as they
[1:30:11] did up there
[1:30:12] they said let his blood be upon us right
[1:30:13] speaking of jesus christ
[1:30:15] and he died in the evening time jesus
[1:30:17] died at three o'clock
[1:30:18] and they took the blood of the lamb with
[1:30:20] hyssop and sprinkled it upon the
[1:30:22] doorpost now this talking back in egypt
[1:30:24] uh sprinkled upon the doorpost and on
[1:30:26] the lintel did you notice
[1:30:28] not on the floor it's
[1:30:31] not to be looked down to see what's
[1:30:34] happening in our world today
[1:30:37] a young man who say i don't drink i
[1:30:39] don't smoke i don't go out here and do
[1:30:41] these things you know fornication all
[1:30:43] these things i don't do this
[1:30:44] because i'm a christian this somebody
[1:30:47] said man that's good you've got to stand
[1:30:48] no sir what do they do they're ridiculed
[1:30:50] they're looking down and it's not that
[1:30:53] young man because he can't hold himself
[1:30:55] to that in the age that we live in
[1:30:56] can i speak just really blunt girls are
[1:30:59] more beautiful than ever
[1:31:01] i like the point brother brown makes
[1:31:02] about how any old school girls better
[1:31:04] looking than what that one
[1:31:06] actress lady was that was considered the
[1:31:08] most beautiful woman in the world
[1:31:09] time back in the 30s and any old school
[1:31:12] girls better looking than she is
[1:31:13] so we're living in a day my brother and
[1:31:15] sister for a young man or a young woman
[1:31:17] to hold themselves as sons and daughters
[1:31:19] of god hold themselves in purity
[1:31:21] that's not this flesh because the spirit
[1:31:23] of the age promotes everything
[1:31:25] under the sun right down there teaching
[1:31:27] it right down into the grade schools now
[1:31:29] and that's what it is but you see we
[1:31:31] have a revelation that it's not to be
[1:31:33] looked down
[1:31:34] on amen it's to be looked up to and
[1:31:37] notice on the doorpost and on the lintel
[1:31:40] perfect
[1:31:40] the cross that was a blood god said when
[1:31:43] i see the blood
[1:31:44] i'll pass i'll pass over you when i see
[1:31:46] the blood god's provided way
[1:31:48] how are we going to escape the death he
[1:31:50] says i'll watch
[1:31:51] for the blood now look i want you you
[1:31:54] know this is right here in scripture but
[1:31:56] we're taking this kind of preaching this
[1:31:57] out of this quotation
[1:31:58] my brother and sister right down in in
[1:32:01] egypt and god said you know what i'm
[1:32:02] going to judge
[1:32:03] egypt and every household that doesn't
[1:32:05] have a blood over the doorpost
[1:32:07] i want you to you know i want you to
[1:32:09] recognize i want you to place a value
[1:32:11] this has to happen
[1:32:12] and there that night out and let's take
[1:32:15] a little drama
[1:32:16] i can notice the father of course in the
[1:32:18] old testament was the priest of the
[1:32:19] house
[1:32:23] some people think that died in the old
[1:32:25] testament
[1:32:26] but i'm telling you god's got a revival
[1:32:28] in the land that fathers
[1:32:31] are standing up and saying i'm going to
[1:32:32] be the priest of my house again
[1:32:34] i'm going to show my family not tell
[1:32:36] them to serve god i'm going to show them
[1:32:37] how to serve god
[1:32:39] i'm going to be the example in front of
[1:32:41] them and i'll we'll make mistakes can we
[1:32:43] say amen brothers
[1:32:45] amen but i will stand as an example and
[1:32:48] when i need to repent i'll repent and
[1:32:50] apologize when i need to apologize
[1:32:52] and i'll say i love you and i will
[1:32:54] create an atmosphere that my family
[1:32:56] will know that god is real in our house
[1:32:58] not just words
[1:33:00] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:33:08] priest of the house now he's a
[1:33:11] figurehead
[1:33:13] now he goes down and puts on the door in
[1:33:15] little post and when it come about that
[1:33:17] night i can see all the young girls
[1:33:19] down there come out tell the hebrew
[1:33:22] girls
[1:33:22] come on we're going out to the dance why
[1:33:26] they say
[1:33:26] we can't go we're under the blood
[1:33:34] look at the difference when a father
[1:33:37] would create such an atmosphere in his
[1:33:40] house
[1:33:41] and literally take as it were that blood
[1:33:44] and put it on the doorpost and the
[1:33:46] lintel
[1:33:47] and his children seeing it so real
[1:33:51] no one has to say now daughter of mine
[1:33:54] if you sneak out and go dancing
[1:33:57] i'll take your phone away
[1:34:00] daughter of mine if you sneak out and go
[1:34:03] dancing
[1:34:04] you won't get keys to the car
[1:34:09] but imagine an atmosphere that's been
[1:34:11] created in a home
[1:34:13] of a father who took the word took the
[1:34:15] blood of jesus christ and put it over
[1:34:17] the door of his house
[1:34:20] and have a daughter that would say
[1:34:24] i can't go out and go dancing i can't do
[1:34:26] that
[1:34:28] because my daddy said so no sir
[1:34:32] you catch the significance
[1:34:35] because i little girl speaking
[1:34:38] because i am under the blood
[1:34:43] not our church says not the pastor says
[1:34:46] not daddy says
[1:34:47] not mama says but a little girl herself
[1:34:51] saying i am under the blood i can't do
[1:34:54] that
[1:34:56] that's when we see a change
[1:35:00] in a church that's when we see a change
[1:35:04] in lives they say that rules without
[1:35:07] respect
[1:35:08] equals rebellion my brother and sister
[1:35:11] i'll change it to this right here
[1:35:13] rules without example will lead to
[1:35:16] rebellion
[1:35:18] there's got to be an example there's got
[1:35:20] to be a father
[1:35:23] and when i speak to this i speak in the
[1:35:24] context of the family
[1:35:26] there's got to be a father stands up and
[1:35:28] says children
[1:35:30] this is what the word of god says this
[1:35:33] is what we're going to do
[1:35:40] hallelujah
[1:35:42] let's have a good time
[1:35:45] we're under the blood what a type we're
[1:35:47] coming in god's provided way nonsense
[1:35:49] with that religion
[1:35:50] whoever thought that blood would do
[1:35:52] anything come on out let's have a good
[1:35:54] time
[1:35:54] but they stayed under the blood and god
[1:35:57] said when you go under the blood stay
[1:35:58] there
[1:35:59] not in and out in and out stay there
[1:36:02] after a while
[1:36:03] come midnight great dark roaring cloud
[1:36:05] come up
[1:36:06] i can look back look how this is
[1:36:08] dramaticized here
[1:36:09] i look coming back over yonder i can see
[1:36:12] two big black wings
[1:36:13] spread out across the nation here it
[1:36:15] comes i can hear the priest of the
[1:36:16] family the father say
[1:36:18] what was this i hear the priest of the
[1:36:20] family got their own
[1:36:21] private priest right there in their home
[1:36:23] they don't have to get in the car drive
[1:36:24] down the street knock on the door and
[1:36:26] walk in and ask for a priest
[1:36:27] they got a priest in their home they've
[1:36:29] got someone who is there
[1:36:30] intercessing intermingling bringing the
[1:36:33] word of god living it out in flesh
[1:36:36] filled with the spirit the very life of
[1:36:38] god i read a very beautiful
[1:36:41] very beautiful beautiful uh uh
[1:36:44] memorial here a few days ago of a father
[1:36:47] passed away a grown daughter
[1:36:51] children of her own wrote this memorial
[1:36:54] of her father
[1:36:56] and she said when i was a little girl my
[1:36:58] father was an alcoholic
[1:37:03] and life was difficult in our home
[1:37:07] but one day my daddy met jesus christ
[1:37:13] and he not only met him he became him
[1:37:19] and since that day i've had a living
[1:37:22] example
[1:37:22] of jesus christ in my life
[1:37:27] is that not a beautiful testimony
[1:37:29] memorial of a man
[1:37:31] life was difficult but my daddy met
[1:37:34] jesus christ and become
[1:37:36] him not just talking about it
[1:37:39] but he literally she testifies as though
[1:37:43] he'd been
[1:37:44] and does not the scripture say christ in
[1:37:46] you

[1:37:53] who's
[1:37:54] strove with all of his might to be jesus
[1:37:57] christ
[1:37:58] representation to his own children
[1:38:04] hallelujah god help us to be that kind
[1:38:06] of father
[1:38:09] i can hear the priests of the family the
[1:38:10] father say there's a death angel
[1:38:12] sweeping the land now

[1:43:24] what do you care what they say out here
[1:43:26] quite honestly you serve god you pray
[1:43:29] over your food
[1:43:30] i read a comment the other day where a
[1:43:33] guy was talking about how he was in a
[1:43:34] restaurant
[1:43:36] and he prayed over his food and some guy
[1:43:38] walked by him and says
[1:43:39] you still do that nonsense
[1:43:45] yes i do hallelujah
[1:43:48] because i wouldn't trade everything
[1:43:50] you've got for everything
[1:43:52] i've got or as one man said i wouldn't
[1:43:55] trade everything you got
[1:43:56] for a sliver of what i've got
[1:44:00] see we don't care what's the world my
[1:44:02] brother sister it's producing what they
[1:44:03] wanted it to produce
[1:44:06] i don't care what the world's got to say
[1:44:08] about call you a fanatic if they want to
[1:44:10] as long as you know the blood's applied
[1:44:12] all right he said there's no danger
[1:44:14] isn't it beautiful look i want to speak
[1:44:17] for our fathers here today because i
[1:44:19] believe we have an
[1:44:19] awesome group of fathers i want to speak
[1:44:22] for it
[1:44:23] you know what the answer
[1:44:26] is in the blood but it's not just to
[1:44:29] talk about the blood
[1:44:30] it's the blood applied
[1:44:34] he could have said no son here we we we
[1:44:37] slew the lamb
[1:44:38] we offered the lamb and we've got the
[1:44:40] blood right here
[1:44:41] we got the blood right here do you know
[1:44:44] if he'd just had that blood in that dish
[1:44:46] that bowl that death angel would have
[1:44:47] swept in there wrapped its arms around
[1:44:50] the house and his boy would have died
[1:44:51] that was a promise to egypt
[1:44:53] that was a promise in the hour so it
[1:44:55] wasn't just we have blood we have blood
[1:44:56] oh we got the blood of jesus
[1:44:58] so many beautiful songs there is
[1:44:59] concerning the blood of jesus christ
[1:45:01] we've got the blood we've got the blood
[1:45:03] we've got the deal but there is a song
[1:45:04] that i just love listening to some some
[1:45:06] pentecostal lady charity gayle sings
[1:45:08] that
[1:45:09] thank you lord for the blood applied the
[1:45:12] whole secret if you haven't listened to
[1:45:13] it i encourage you to go to
[1:45:15] to to something like youtube or whatever
[1:45:17] and listen to it
[1:45:18] because really there's depth in that
[1:45:20] song thank you
[1:45:22] jesus for the blood
[1:45:26] applied
[1:45:29] stand at the window and hold the bowl up
[1:45:31] and say death angel we've got the blood
[1:45:34] no sir it had to be applied
[1:45:39] and then when you come there you see my
[1:45:41] brother and sister
[1:45:43] and first thing you know those big black
[1:45:44] wings swept down towards that house
[1:45:48] he's seen the blood and just passed on
[1:45:51] over it
[1:45:53] how marvelous fathers
[1:45:58] let's not be delinquent let's not be
[1:46:00] tardy
[1:46:02] but let's apply the blood to our houses
[1:46:06] for the saving of our own souls for the
[1:46:08] saving
[1:46:09] you know it's interesting that scripture
[1:46:10] lays a foundation that a wife will never
[1:46:12] answer
[1:46:14] for her husband but husband will answer
[1:46:17] for his wife children will never answer
[1:46:21] for their father but a father
[1:46:24] will answer for his children
[1:46:28] have i got you all sad now
[1:46:31] some of you look like i've got you sad
[1:46:36] i want to ask you this as we come to
[1:46:38] close
[1:46:40] where will you ever find a reference in
[1:46:42] the scripture
[1:46:44] that god asked abraham to take the easy
[1:46:46] route
[1:46:51] never once did god ask abraham take the
[1:46:54] easy route
[1:46:56] he tempted abraham that's what it says
[1:46:58] put him to the test
[1:47:01] brothers fathers would we have courage
[1:47:04] enough this morning to lift a hand and
[1:47:06] say lord
[1:47:07] for the sake of my family for the future
[1:47:10] of my family
[1:47:11] i stand here and say lord test me
[1:47:16] try me prove me lord prove me
[1:47:19] that i would be able to prove jesus
[1:47:22] christ
[1:47:23] to my family but you know we got saints
[1:47:27] now i say this kind of lightly i didn't
[1:47:29] come across as lighthearted as i felt
[1:47:30] when i studied this i'm sorry this
[1:47:34] morning
[1:47:37] what we got today this is really kind of
[1:47:40] a slam on manhood and i believe in
[1:47:42] physical fitness
[1:47:44] i i'm not you know the bible says it
[1:47:46] profiteth
[1:47:47] very very very can i emphasize to some
[1:47:50] of you young people

[1:47:54] very very very
[1:47:55] very little

[1:48:50] for a father to be able to stand and
[1:48:51] look at his daughter and say honey

[1:48:58] when you're 30 years old you'll say i'm
[1:49:00] so glad i was there
[1:49:01] and so i know you're going to be angry

[1:49:24] he gave her
[1:49:26] no sir a real father says i'm not
[1:49:30] looking to raise a good child
[1:49:32] i'm looking to raise a good adult i'm
[1:49:34] looking to raise a son or a daughter
[1:49:36] that at 30 years old will be able to
[1:49:37] look in their children
[1:49:38] and say look at your grandfather and
[1:49:40] look at your daddy
[1:49:42] this is what is the right thing to do
[1:49:44] and our family does
[1:49:46] the right thing but what are we getting
[1:49:49] the opposite
[1:49:50] great big macho men post all over social
[1:49:53] media
[1:49:54] deadlifted 575 pounds
[1:49:58] ran 30 miles i did i got the biggest
[1:50:02] fish i shot the biggest deer and their
[1:50:04] children
[1:50:05] iraq why
[1:50:08] because they don't understand the value
[1:50:11] of the blood on the doorpost and the
[1:50:14] lintel
[1:50:16] that's what makes a real father when he
[1:50:19] says
[1:50:19] i'm here to lead my children not tell
[1:50:22] them to go to church right brother brown
[1:50:24] said don't don't send your kids to
[1:50:25] church

[1:50:28] families we have parents here that don't
[1:50:30] just send their kids to church they they
[1:50:31] take them to church
[1:50:33] now i want to close on this sister emmy
[1:50:35] would you come so that way i will be
[1:50:37] forced to close
[1:50:40] every son and daughter must be tempted
[1:50:42] right is that not the scripture
[1:50:44] god says every time he's ever called you
[1:50:48] he'll make the way for you
[1:50:50] yeah now look we can find this
[1:50:54] scriptural reference right here
[1:50:55] find it as a scriptural reference i
[1:50:57] should say and john was one of those men
[1:50:59] that did not hold back any punches
[1:51:04] i've been studying john and i want to be
[1:51:05] a preacher like john so you guys hang on
[1:51:07] right because we're just gonna quit
[1:51:09] you know we're just gonna not pull any
[1:51:11] punches
[1:51:13] he just let her fly it made no
[1:51:14] difference to him if his head off it was
[1:51:16] head off that's all just like elijah
[1:51:18] it is right out forward with what he had
[1:51:20] to say what was right was right and it
[1:51:23] was wrong it's wrong
[1:51:24] god we need more like that today men who
[1:51:27] will stand
[1:51:28] on a real genuine convictions of the
[1:51:31] word of god
[1:51:32] speak it and don't hold your peace speak
[1:51:34] it out
[1:51:36] fathers god bless you i love every one
[1:51:38] of you
[1:51:39] i love what i see happening in your
[1:51:41] families
[1:51:43] speak the truth in your family even oh i
[1:51:46] know this is so hard i forgot to stop
[1:51:48] and buy band-aids
[1:51:51] even if your children might say wait dad
[1:51:54] you just said this
[1:51:57] you can look them in the face come on
[1:52:00] you can look him in the face and say i
[1:52:02] know dad didn't do that
[1:52:04] but dad knows and he's trying and this
[1:52:06] is what is right
[1:52:08] even if dad didn't line up to it can we
[1:52:11] be men like that
[1:52:12] where we would actually judge ourselves
[1:52:14] in front of our own family and say i've
[1:52:16] come short
[1:52:18] but i don't want to be short and i'm not
[1:52:20] going to raise another generation of
[1:52:21] people coming short because i'm
[1:52:23] embarrassed that i came short what i'm
[1:52:25] going to do is stand up like a man
[1:52:27] i got what a real father
[1:52:30] and say i didn't do what i was supposed
[1:52:32] to do children but while we know what we
[1:52:34] should do
[1:52:35] and i want to do it i want to live it i
[1:52:38] want to be this kind of man
[1:52:40] god help us i want to be that kind of
[1:52:42] man
[1:52:43] man i tell you what if i gave you a list
[1:52:45] of the mistakes i made as a parent
[1:52:48] you guys would be calling child
[1:52:49] protective services and saying well his
[1:52:51] youngest is in her 30s but you should
[1:52:53] still take away from him
[1:52:55] [Music]
[1:52:56] i made those kind of mistakes but here i
[1:52:58] am today and this is me
[1:53:00] practicing what i preach i can stand
[1:53:02] here today and tell you
[1:53:03] what not to do because
[1:53:06] i did that and it don't work but i can
[1:53:10] also stand here today by god's grace and
[1:53:12] mercy
[1:53:12] and tell you what works and fathers i've
[1:53:15] got just simple words
[1:53:16] for you on what works apply the blood
[1:53:21] on the doorpost
[1:53:24] and it'll all work out just fine
[1:53:27] hallelujah
[1:53:28] i love you saints i know i've been on a
[1:53:30] cranky mood lately some of you just
[1:53:32] frowning at me in church like oh my
[1:53:34] goodness he's just ripping her height
[1:53:36] off right and left
[1:53:37] but you know what i i just wanna i wanna
[1:53:40] see look we're not gonna have church
[1:53:41] where i tell you right now
[1:53:42] now look for every hundred dollars you
[1:53:45] put in the offering
[1:53:46] god's gonna give you a 500 percent
[1:53:49] increase
[1:53:50] and so if you'll just empty your savings
[1:53:52] account and throw it in mice's word
[1:53:54] it's not a reward for the greatest giver
[1:53:58] right or there's no reward reminds me
[1:54:01] and i'm not making lie to this i thought
[1:54:03] it was quite an accomplishment
[1:54:04] read a deal this church is in the
[1:54:05] midwest and and
[1:54:07] um this lady was
[1:54:10] 55 i think received award
[1:54:14] has not missed a church service
[1:54:18] since she was 10 years old
[1:54:23] i think that must be an
[1:54:27] isaiah somewhere because otherwise i
[1:54:30] can't find a scripture where he says
[1:54:32] blessed are they that never
[1:54:36] miss church
[1:54:36] [Music]
[1:54:41] if you find that scripture please let me
[1:54:43] know because i don't want to misquote it
[1:54:47] but he does say blessed are those
[1:54:50] who what
[1:54:52] [Music]
[1:54:54] let me paraphrase it those who
[1:54:58] serve me those who live
[1:55:01] those who obey those
[1:55:04] who look to righteousness
[1:55:08] those are the ones he says you know
[1:55:11] sister jerry sent me a very interesting
[1:55:12] little deal the other day
[1:55:13] and i appreciate that it says well done
[1:55:16] my good and faithful and
[1:55:18] has a whole list of these things the
[1:55:20] little line through
[1:55:22] but down there at the bottom servant
[1:55:26] not well done my good and faithful
[1:55:30] leader ceo encourager
[1:55:33] this that's this no servant
[1:55:37] oh god help us hallelujah
[1:55:40] if somebody wants me to quit say amen
[1:55:46] [Music]
[1:55:50] so it is today i didn't even hear a
[1:55:51] single amen can you imagine that
[1:55:54] and so it is today my brother and sister
[1:55:56] let me disclose on these words
[1:55:57] fathers we have a holy calling
[1:56:00] in an age look at this some people say
[1:56:03] oh oh you know it's just kind of
[1:56:04] overblown
[1:56:05] no it's not we're at war
[1:56:08] on our fathers we're at war on the men
[1:56:11] because you see when a man gets out of
[1:56:13] his position nowhere in scripture
[1:56:15] and i'm not a what do they call them
[1:56:17] sexist or whatever you know when the man
[1:56:18] thinks he's dominant
[1:56:21] chauvinist yeah whatever the words are
[1:56:24] but you won't find in the scripture wife
[1:56:27] go kill a lamb
[1:56:29] go put blood on the doorpost in the
[1:56:30] lentil no sir it was the man's job
[1:56:34] it was a man's job to stand up according
[1:56:36] to the word put the blood on it
[1:56:38] why what we're doing we're turning it
[1:56:40] all around we're turning it upside down
[1:56:42] the scripture says those things that are
[1:56:43] good they'll call evil those things that
[1:56:45] are evil they'll call good
[1:56:47] amen i like that when the portland
[1:56:49] police
[1:56:50] chief you know is talking about how
[1:56:53] down there in downtown portland car
[1:56:55] dealership there with about 500 cars on
[1:56:57] it new cars
[1:56:58] 500 cars there they bashed the windows
[1:56:59] out every one of them and the portland
[1:57:01] police chief said well the kids are just
[1:57:03] expressing themselves
[1:57:05] now call evil good
[1:57:09] hallelujah and i want you to look here
[1:57:13] look here fathers we have a holy calling
[1:57:17] once again the testing is taking place
[1:57:21] once again revival is coming in the land
[1:57:25] revival is coming to the people fathers
[1:57:27] counted up and saying you know what
[1:57:29] i'm going to stand for the word of god
[1:57:30] and i'm going to tell the world i'm
[1:57:32] going to let the world know i'm not
[1:57:33] perfect but i'm trying
[1:57:35] i'm going to be there and let god deal
[1:57:36] with me and i'm going to do this
[1:57:39] and the word is restoring the priest
[1:57:41] back in the home can you brothers say
[1:57:42] amen to that
[1:57:44] the word is restoring it's not us brute
[1:57:46] force take it back but the words
[1:57:48] restoring our place
[1:57:51] men are not afraid to stand on the word
[1:57:53] of god
[1:57:56] not afraid to stand for the word
[1:57:59] and to stand openly you know i'm a
[1:58:02] ferocious reader saints and sometimes i
[1:58:04] just get caught up in reading
[1:58:08] we're just reading recently a man in a
[1:58:10] political office
[1:58:12] when he was called out now usually when
[1:58:15] they use the word somebody being outed
[1:58:17] they're talking about sexual orientation
[1:58:19] you know they were
[1:58:20] outed but this man was outed in his
[1:58:23] state legislature
[1:58:26] for being a christian and i thought what
[1:58:29] a shame that we have to be outed
[1:58:30] [Music]
[1:58:32] that we were a christian in other words
[1:58:33] nobody knew nobody could figure this out
[1:58:35] it was a secret it was a mystery
[1:58:38] where is it that men would stand up and
[1:58:39] say i don't care what you think
[1:58:42] my god's first my family's second and
[1:58:45] everything else can follow along behind
[1:58:47] that
[1:58:48] but what is it this man was embarrassed
[1:58:51] and actually apologized to his
[1:58:53] fellow legislators for
[1:58:56] for being a christian i say they ought
[1:58:59] to strip him publicly of the name
[1:59:01] christian because christ like you never
[1:59:03] seen jesus
[1:59:04] here he is coming the backside of
[1:59:07] bethany
[1:59:08] [Music]
[1:59:14] let me pray for you bless you
[1:59:20] no sorry come and he let him know
[1:59:26] you think the priests were excited he
[1:59:29] showed up in town
[1:59:31] not at all but he didn't hide and
[1:59:34] neither will any man whose
[1:59:39] how would i word that filled with the
[1:59:42] spirit
[1:59:43] any man anointed by the word any man
[1:59:46] that's
[1:59:46] confessed that jesus christ is lord and
[1:59:50] savior
[1:59:51] you see it's an anointing to stand
[1:59:53] openly in the hour we live in
[1:59:55] you might not agree with tim tebow's
[1:59:57] doctrines or whatever you believe but
[1:59:58] there's a man who's went to the highest
[2:00:00] level of sports in our nation
[2:00:02] and stood there and told them i'm a
[2:00:04] christian and they have
[2:00:06] mocked him in every way a man can be
[2:00:10] mocked they have mocked him
[2:00:12] and you know what he says he says i'm so
[2:00:15] thankful that god allowed them to do
[2:00:17] that
[2:00:18] because i had to decide whether
[2:00:21] playing sports was first or god was
[2:00:24] first
[2:00:26] and i chose god and they chose sports
[2:00:31] well hallelujah thank you lord
[2:00:34] amen well
[2:00:42] oh my brother jason
[2:00:46] come lead us in some songs i'll let you
[2:00:50] get all the people out of their
[2:00:51] sorrowful state
[2:00:53] dad i want you to stand up
[2:00:57] for what is right don't compromise
[2:01:01] don't look at your own failure don't
[2:01:03] look at your own struggle and just stand
[2:01:04] up and say you know what i'm going to do
[2:01:06] what the word
[2:01:06] called me to do even if i have to
[2:01:10] back up and repent to my family you know
[2:01:12] what's hard
[2:01:13] men i'm just talking to you the rest of
[2:01:14] you plug your ears not no sisters no
[2:01:17] wives
[2:01:18] listen isn't it so hard sometimes to
[2:01:21] acknowledge
[2:01:23] to our family we've made mistakes it can
[2:01:26] it can be difficult it's kind of a man
[2:01:28] pride thing
[2:01:29] to be able to say you know what i i
[2:01:31] didn't react right
[2:01:35] and i don't want this to be too personal
[2:01:36] to any of you so i'll keep it close to
[2:01:38] home
[2:01:41] i married this girl and some days i
[2:01:45] think she says i wonder what this button
[2:01:48] does
[2:01:53] now what we'd like to do is blame the
[2:01:55] wife
[2:01:56] for the button she pushed
[2:02:00] but it has nothing to do with the wife
[2:02:02] and the button she pushed
[2:02:04] it has all to do with how we respond to
[2:02:07] it
[2:02:08] and we can say him yes
[2:02:12] that is my defensive guilt button and
[2:02:15] normally i would be angry and tell you
[2:02:17] i wouldn't have done that or said that
[2:02:19] except for you said this and you did
[2:02:20] that and then your mama and then it was
[2:02:22] this and
[2:02:23] [Music]
[2:02:28] how about we get to the place brothers
[2:02:32] the devil can't push the button
[2:02:36] wife can't push the button kids can't
[2:02:39] push the button
[2:02:41] god's the only one that could push the
[2:02:44] button
[2:02:46] and then there's where we have harmony
[2:02:49] in our homes there's where the holy
[2:02:50] spirit moves in our midst
[2:02:52] there we're not ashamed to walk out on
[2:02:54] our front step
[2:02:55] and the neighbor across the road going
[2:02:58] hey paul what
[2:02:59] what are you doing well the word said
[2:03:03] slay the lamb and put the blood on the
[2:03:06] doorpost

[2:03:08] worry we go to church together we're all
[2:03:10] christians what are you talking about
[2:03:11] that's fanaticism
[2:03:14] and when a man can come to the place he
[2:03:15] can say i know but that's what the word
[2:03:17] said and
[2:03:18] he puts the blood
[2:03:21] and he walks back in the door and says i
