[39:18] brother
[39:20] hallelujah
[39:22] hallelujah hallelujah
[39:24] thank you lord
[39:26] just got a couple things i'd like to
[39:27] touch on before we go into the service
[39:30] don't forget communion it's on the board
[39:32] back there we're gonna try and be more
[39:34] faithful to get things on the board
[39:36] and uh for those of you that would have
[39:38] a desire to help in some fashion
[39:41] with sunday school we also have a sheet
[39:43] there for you to look at and of course
[39:46] we all know there's a fellowship after
[39:47] the service today
[39:49] brother george texted me very early this
[39:52] morning
[39:53] just desiring your prayers he's in
[39:55] africa the lord is blessing the services
[39:58] and he's just going to be some traveling
[40:00] now and
[40:01] and just was asking the church to
[40:04] remember him amen and of course we
[40:08] i believe brother sergey was necessary
[40:11] we talked to him the other evening and
[40:13] he would like to have been here today
[40:14] but it was necessary for him to be on
[40:17] the road today so just remember him in
[40:19] prayer and anyone who is not here today
[40:21] just as you look around and say i see
[40:24] brother or sister pray for them amen we
[40:26] never know the circumstance and just
[40:28] lift them up to the lord
[40:30] amen i want to speak to you
[40:33] on our position of strength and
[40:36] you know very simple thought today i
[40:38] pray the lord would just bless it but i
[40:40] want to speak to you on preserved
[40:43] amen i believe both of the special songs
[40:46] that we had today are a testimony of the
[40:48] fault that we had
[40:50] to speak today because you see
[40:52] there is no ability within ourselves
[40:56] there's nothing that we can do
[40:58] in the time of trouble when the enemy
[41:00] comes in like a flood we do not raise
[41:03] the standard even though it could be
[41:05] said that we're part of that process but
[41:07] it is not us that raises a standard but
[41:10] it is our lord jesus christ and so as we
[41:13] look at this all through our life if you
[41:15] just stop for a moment
[41:17] young and old and just ponder what god
[41:19] has done for you
[41:21] everything my brother and sister
[41:24] that is good in our life you say but the
[41:26] world out here they have the same things
[41:29] but you have to understand that satan is
[41:32] not going to fight as it were against
[41:34] his own even though he tends to try to
[41:37] punish his own because it's his nature
[41:39] right he can't be nice to anyone and uh
[41:42] but typically you'll find that the
[41:44] minute you start proclaiming as a son or
[41:46] daughter of god
[41:47] that the word is open to you that the
[41:49] life of christ has been poured into you
[41:52] that god's dwelling in you satan then
[41:54] comes and he pushes against that and a
[41:57] whole barrage of fiery darts of the
[42:00] enemy then rained down upon the bride of
[42:02] christ and so we recognize that that it
[42:05] is god that's keeping us it's the holy
[42:07] ghost that is preserving us in the hour
[42:10] that we live in amen and so as we look
[42:12] at this you know truly this is why i
[42:16] thought it was special sister alice of
[42:17] your song because you see if we have not
[42:20] strength of our own to stand in this
[42:23] hour and i think we can say amen to that
[42:24] it's not our strength and if we don't
[42:26] have strength of our own to stand in
[42:28] this hour then there must be some
[42:30] strength and where did it come from amen
[42:33] it's god pouring his preserving power
[42:36] which we could identify today as the
[42:37] holy ghost and he's pouring his uh
[42:41] power into us a holy ghost into us that
[42:44] we're able to stand in the worst of
[42:46] times amen now the prophet of god said
[42:48] that the day we're living in is the most
[42:51] wicked of all the ages it's the
[42:53] accumulation of all wickedness of the
[42:56] days it's brought down and you say but
[42:58] they had this in that day and they had
[43:00] that in that day that's right so there's
[43:02] nothing new under the sun but they
[43:04] didn't have a computer they didn't have
[43:06] an ipad and they didn't have you might
[43:08] say such a liberal spirit upon the world
[43:12] to pour it out upon even our little
[43:14] children talking to a man the other day
[43:16] he made a statement he says you know uh
[43:19] you go to school to pick up your little
[43:21] granddaughter and uh you're a little bit
[43:24] early but you walk in get a collector
[43:26] right
[43:27] at the classroom
[43:28] and you can't believe your ears
[43:31] that's the age we live in
[43:33] with no recourse
[43:35] and i'll try and tie this by god's grace
[43:37] then because
[43:38] you see
[43:40] the world doesn't look at that school
[43:42] system and that teacher is fanatical
[43:45] they look at you
[43:47] as a fanatic
[43:49] that you actually care
[43:51] about the heart and soul of your
[43:52] children grandchildren
[43:54] what's wrong with you aren't you
[43:56] progressive
[43:57] well my brother and sister not to get
[43:59] into politics but you see that's what
[44:01] the devil was
[44:02] in the garden
[44:04] preaching a progressive message to eve
[44:08] by which she could circumvent the word
[44:10] of god by twisting the words
[44:14] or
[44:15] leaving them out
[44:19] right back to eden
[44:20] again that's what the prophet taught us
[44:22] we're right back to eden again
[44:25] coming right into the house of god
[44:28] trying to preach a progressive
[44:31] message or the lack of
[44:35] but god by his grace and mercy said
[44:37] i've already put
[44:39] the preservative
[44:41] amen i've already done everything it's
[44:44] necessary
[44:45] to keep my own amen aren't you glad this
[44:47] morning let's stand and go into the word
[44:49] of god
[44:53] i want to turn to second timothy the
[44:55] fourth chapter verses 16
[44:57] to 18.
[44:59] and in this i i actually it's verse 18
[45:02] but i just wanted to catch a little bit
[45:05] of the groundwork now this is a letter
[45:07] of paul to timothy
[45:10] and uh you know paul's ministry was not
[45:12] without controversy not without conflict
[45:15] not without
[45:16] persecution and not without blessing
[45:20] amen
[45:21] second timothy 4 16
[45:24] at my first answer no man stood with me
[45:27] so here's paul
[45:29] as it is standing alone on the word of
[45:31] god
[45:33] but all men forsake me forsook me
[45:36] i pray
[45:37] god that it may not be laid to their
[45:39] charge
[45:40] now this my brother and sister let me
[45:42] just interject when people come against
[45:44] you
[45:45] they besmirch your name
[45:48] they speak all manner of evil the
[45:50] scripture says against you
[45:52] the word does not say retaliate
[45:56] the word says
[45:58] to paraphrase lift them up
[46:02] to the presence of god
[46:04] amen
[46:05] now do you realize they may never change
[46:07] but it will change you
[46:09] and sometimes that's actually what
[46:10] prayer does it doesn't change the
[46:12] situation but it brings us peace and
[46:15] understanding and compassion within the
[46:17] situation
[46:20] [Music]
[46:21] that's good
[46:23] you know jesus said he's without
[46:26] sin cast the first stone and i want to
[46:28] say he who's without attitude
[46:30] be the first to judge
[46:33] yeah
[46:34] so we've all been there
[46:36] but by god's grace we're being able to
[46:39] step beyond it
[46:41] amen
[46:43] notwithstanding the lord stood with me
[46:45] can someone say amen
[46:47] and strengthen me
[46:49] that by me the preaching might be fully
[46:52] known and that all the gentiles might
[46:54] hear now that the world we live in today
[46:56] in its totally all boundaries and all
[46:59] guidelines are gone
[47:01] there are now preachers
[47:03] on the face of the earth
[47:05] that are saying we don't like paul's
[47:08] attitude
[47:10] imagine this many years from when this
[47:12] was preached
[47:14] now they have a crisis of paul's
[47:16] attitude because we're now believing
[47:18] that paul might have been narcissistic
[47:23] yeah
[47:24] it was all about paul
[47:27] hallelujah but do you catch these saints
[47:31] they're totally in this day missing
[47:33] the fact that god has always
[47:36] use man
[47:40] we think about how difficult it is
[47:42] imagine how it is for the lord wouldn't
[47:44] it been simpler for him just simply to
[47:46] appoint it a people
[47:47] you you you you you you
[47:52] you're in the millennium
[47:54] but it saved god a lot of time and
[47:55] hassle also wouldn't it
[48:00] but god says you know what satan imagine
[48:02] they're having a friendly conversation
[48:05] i'll prove to you
[48:07] satan i will prove to you
[48:11] that i can have a people and call them
[48:13] out
[48:14] and keep them amen
[48:16] and hold them and lead them and guide
[48:18] them a people
[48:20] not by their own ability but capable
[48:24] this is what paul is saying
[48:26] that's what paul's saying it was by this
[48:28] that god has made me capable to preach
[48:31] this gospel that it would come from the
[48:34] jews to the gentiles and hold them in
[48:37] that that the gentiles might hear and i
[48:39] was delivered out of the mouth of the
[48:40] lion
[48:41] and the lord shall deliver me from every
[48:44] evil work and i would like you to repeat
[48:46] that with me and the lord shall deliver
[48:50] me from every evil work
[48:53] and
[48:55] will preserve me into his heavenly
[48:58] kingdom
[48:59] to whom be glory forever and ever amen
[49:04] can we just give a little thanksgiving
[49:05] to the lord hallelujah
[49:08] amen i believe this word
[49:11] i claim this word
[49:13] amen the lord shall deliver me do you
[49:16] know that the word shall actually is is
[49:19] a very interesting word because it is
[49:21] past present and future
[49:24] amen and that's what it is jesus christ
[49:27] the same yesterday today and forever
[49:29] heavenly father we just ask you to bless
[49:31] this time together lord just bless our
[49:34] our dear little dionna father
[49:37] lord jesus just touch her all the days
[49:39] of her life lord give wisdom to her
[49:41] parents
[49:42] lord and just strengthen that family as
[49:45] a unit father we pray in your name amen
[49:48] you may be seated saints
[49:50] hallelujah
[49:54] you know i heard the brother put it this
[49:55] way once as he was dedicating a baby he
[49:58] said this is just the prelude
[50:01] of the privilege we'll have to baptize
[50:03] her in the name of jesus christ
[50:05] this is step one to baptism amen i liked
[50:09] that amen
[50:11] now look at this paul's letter to
[50:13] timothy
[50:14] uh is is there despite all the
[50:17] opposition and all the trouble uh it was
[50:20] it was a a solid word right it's so
[50:24] solid that when uh brother branham is
[50:27] now there speaking and he's on the
[50:29] beyond the curtain of time
[50:31] it wasn't hey do you believe genesis it
[50:33] wasn't uh what about this over here but
[50:36] the comparison come down to paul's
[50:39] ministry and it was that my brother and
[50:41] sister that will work for us today as
[50:43] message believers you know what i'm
[50:45] talking about and so brother branham was
[50:47] assured or give confidence there that if
[50:50] paul's ministry would bring forth a
[50:52] people that would make it amen then by
[50:55] preaching that same gospel we can have
[50:58] confidence today and so as we look at
[51:00] this we realize that that paul did not
[51:03] have as it were you might say some
[51:06] comfortable kind of ministry but god
[51:08] made him in a sense go as it were to
[51:11] start in in the backside of the desert
[51:14] and truly my brother and sister god
[51:16] started paul's ministry he didn't just
[51:19] convert him as it were as a child but
[51:21] allowed him to come out of false
[51:24] doctrine and come into the light of the
[51:27] truth and he come as a one a man taking
[51:31] the lives by his word right his command
[51:34] taking the lives of the saints to bring
[51:36] him to a place that he give his life
[51:40] for the saints
[51:41] and so we see how lovely that is because
[51:44] this is a life completely surrendered to
[51:47] christ amen this was not a life that was
[51:49] just a ministry
[51:51] and and could say for the years i
[51:53] preached but truly a man who gave his
[51:55] entire life to be consumed for the
[51:58] gospel and i want to build upon a
[52:00] foundation if we'll go into psalms here
[52:03] and it is now a beautiful thought my
[52:06] brother and sister the chief musician is
[52:08] psalm of david the servant of the lord
[52:11] the transgression of the wicked saith
[52:13] within my heart that there is no fear of
[52:16] god before his eyes for he flattereth
[52:20] himself in his own eyes now look i i
[52:22] know a lot of you do social media stuff
[52:25] and i'm not going to speak against that
[52:26] today and that's up to you between you
[52:29] and the lord what you what you watch
[52:31] your content how much time you do but i
[52:33] want you to understand that the reason i
[52:36] chose this scripture is because it is a
[52:38] very clear reflection
[52:40] they shall be abundantly satisfied with
[52:43] the fatness of the house
[52:45] and thou shall make them to drink of the
[52:47] river of thy pleasures
[52:49] for with thee there is a fountain of
[52:51] life and in thy light
[52:54] shall we see light
[52:57] oh continue let this verse 10 be a
[52:59] prayer oh continue thy loving kindness
[53:02] unto them that know thee and thy
[53:04] righteousness to the upright in heart
[53:08] you know that song stirs my these these
[53:10] words the psalm i mean
[53:12] serves my heart enough i just want to i
[53:14] just want to shout and sing here is the
[53:17] here's the whole breakdown my brother
[53:19] and sister of what god is doing and and
[53:21] all through scripture
[53:23] we see the two sides right brother
[53:25] branham speaks he says now we see the
[53:27] two spirits in the framework of the
[53:30] christian church
[53:32] now we see all through the scripture
[53:34] these two sides this struggle of the
[53:36] spirits right and we could put it in
[53:38] simple terms
[53:40] as i said this will be a simple thought
[53:42] today simple terms of good and evil but
[53:45] you see sometimes it's not just good
[53:47] enough to be good
[53:50] because there are family saints on the
[53:51] face of this earth that are raising good
[53:54] children
[53:55] that know not the lord
[53:57] there are families that are good people
[53:59] give to charity and help and kind and
[54:02] compassion but know not the lord so it
[54:04] is not simply a matter of being good or
[54:07] being kind but there has to be this
[54:10] other understanding of the struggles of
[54:13] the spirits of the day that we live in
[54:16] and how as the prophet of god said how
[54:18] that satan would desire to come in to
[54:20] destroy you
[54:22] and then he comes in he doesn't always
[54:24] come in in a flood sometimes he comes in
[54:26] so subtle
[54:28] we'll have things creep into our lives
[54:30] that we don't even realize that is
[54:32] happening it is degraded
[54:38] you know you can
[54:40] you can have a laptop and
[54:42] it can just get slower and slower so
[54:44] slow in fact that it won't perform
[54:47] but you realize it does it so slow
[54:51] that you don't realize
[54:53] it doesn't perform
[54:54] until maybe you have a son-in-law that
[54:56] comes in and says hey
[54:59] that should have loaded by now oh no
[55:01] that's just how it works
[55:04] this is the way it's always been well
[55:06] that still don't make it right
[55:08] that's how subtle satan is right he
[55:11] comes in and he degrades in such a
[55:14] fashion that we find ourselves churches
[55:16] now look i'm not i'm not defending or
[55:18] boosting myself or brother david or
[55:20] brother chris
[55:22] not at all but i'm telling you that's
[55:24] why god would place men in our midst
[55:26] this is scriptural place men in our
[55:28] midst and they themselves need to tune
[55:30] up but when god keeps them tuned up
[55:32] they'll look out and they'll want to see
[55:34] you tuned up and so then sometimes hard
[55:37] things are preached direct things are
[55:38] preached forceful things are preached
[55:40] and love is preached and compassion is
[55:43] preached because we have to be balanced
[55:45] and if not we would just slowly come
[55:47] down and this is where the prophets get
[55:50] filled with the fire of almighty god
[55:53] almost wanted to ask the girls to sing
[55:55] that song again this morning i just love
[55:58] that i got fire in my bones
[56:00] amen it's not anointed on my wallet it's
[56:03] not anointed on my business it's not an
[56:05] anointed it's down in my bones it's
[56:07] christ all the way down in the depth of
[56:10] who i am
[56:12] everything that i am is christ
[56:16] and i couldn't do it on my own
[56:19] oh but he said this work i have began in
[56:22] you
[56:24] amen and from the first moment he
[56:25] started to anoint us maybe as a child
[56:28] right to the place that we are right now
[56:31] wait brother paul i backslid yeah i know
[56:33] what you're talking about but i'm
[56:35] telling you he had already placed the
[56:37] ember he had already placed the seed
[56:40] he'd already placed the life and he said
[56:42] i'm not worried oh mama's worried
[56:45] grandma's worried maybe the preacher is
[56:47] worried god said i'm not worried
[56:50] i know what i have begun in them
[56:53] hallelujah but look at this my brother
[56:55] and sister and i say grace tabernacle
[56:58] let us not ever come to the place that
[57:00] lukewarm is an acceptable position in
[57:04] our church in our lives in our families
[57:08] don't accept it in your ministry don't
[57:10] accept it in any position any time or
[57:13] any place
[57:15] but you see it even gets worse
[57:18] than that
[57:20] when the subtle line says you know if
[57:22] you just as i said already got ahead of
[57:24] myself come to church
[57:26] pay your tithes
[57:28] we don't sign books
[57:31] we tend to sign it by hey they come
[57:33] they're faithful
[57:34] everything's all right
[57:38] my family come out before they come in
[57:40] the message come out of a methodist
[57:42] church
[57:44] my dad was good friends with the
[57:45] minister and later in life i became good
[57:47] friends with him
[57:48] on the basis of preaching funeral
[57:54] this man spoke to my dad and said david
[57:58] you were doing really good your family
[58:00] was faithful in church and you got a
[58:02] good family
[58:04] isn't
[58:05] or wasn't
[58:06] that enough
[58:10] come on that's right
[58:14] we could make a declaration this morning
[58:16] that's enough
[58:18] but what would it do
[58:22] it would destroy your church and i'm not
[58:23] talking about this building i would be
[58:25] talking about our souls and our position
[58:27] in the lord
[58:29] just doing this is enough no my brother
[58:31] and sister it's not enough
[58:33] if we're not on fire nothing short of
[58:35] being on fire is sufficient
[58:38] but satan would bring it that we would
[58:40] get to the place i'm faithful in church
[58:42] everything's cool
[58:44] i give i support
[58:46] my family or
[58:47] whatever it might be
[58:51] do you know in the age you'll see this
[58:55] in this interesting
[58:57] we see a lot of celebrity type people on
[59:00] the earth today becoming christians
[59:08] it's cool
[59:10] your eyes it's cool to be christian but
[59:11] you want to see where the real
[59:12] foundation of this is satan has made it
[59:15] cool to be a christian but you don't see
[59:17] their life change
[59:20] so now what it projects is satan very
[59:23] clever
[59:24] what he's projecting is you can be a
[59:25] christian without any kind of change
[59:28] well i can tell you you can be cold
[59:30] without any kind of change but you can't
[59:32] be a christian without any kind of
[59:34] change
[59:35] now you look in the world that we're
[59:36] living in today and it is actually cool
[59:40] to be cold
[59:41] or turn that around
[59:43] cold is cool
[59:52] responsible to nothing
[59:54] is a new norm
[59:58] think about it
[1:00:00] and everybody says oh this
[1:00:03] is the age of the identity
[1:00:06] they forgot to put the word crisis on
[1:00:08] the end of that
[1:00:09] this is the age of the crisis
[1:00:13] we're being an island come on saints
[1:00:16] we don't want to get satan satan will
[1:00:18] bring you to a place where this actually
[1:00:20] will apply to you and if you're not
[1:00:22] careful you won't even recognize it
[1:00:23] where being an island to oneself is seen
[1:00:26] as normal
[1:00:29] if you want i can take you in the word
[1:00:30] of god that says we were called to a
[1:00:32] body
[1:00:33] and you didn't leave your arm at home
[1:00:35] today because it annoyed you you didn't
[1:00:37] leave your leg at home because it didn't
[1:00:39] want to get in the car you didn't do all
[1:00:41] of that we're a body and if you want to
[1:00:43] do we can go write in the message we can
[1:00:44] go right into scripture if you need that
[1:00:46] reminder that we're a body and one part
[1:00:49] of the body cannot isolate itself from
[1:00:51] the rest of the body and say all is well
[1:00:57] i hope that didn't hurt anybody's
[1:00:58] feelings
[1:00:59] but we're in a world where being an
[1:01:02] island to oneself is considered normal
[1:01:05] and self-identity
[1:01:07] is considered to be brave
[1:01:11] think about what's going on in a world
[1:01:13] they're they're such heroes
[1:01:16] i just listened to deal the other day i
[1:01:17] was like why in the world paul did you
[1:01:19] even listen to that thing
[1:01:21] they were explaining
[1:01:23] why this new generation of people under
[1:01:25] this they don't use the word anointing
[1:01:27] or spirit because they don't really
[1:01:28] think there's anything there
[1:01:31] but they're so
[1:01:36] brave i'm not trying to
[1:01:39] mock or just do something for humor
[1:01:42] but in an interesting sense how you have
[1:01:44] all these people that say i i've got my
[1:01:46] own identity
[1:01:47] i don't want to be i don't know got my
[1:01:49] own identity but when you see this
[1:01:53] oh thank you lord
[1:01:55] you don't think this is all relevant
[1:01:56] saints
[1:01:58] a prophet of god sees a vision beyond
[1:01:59] the curtain of time and what does he see
[1:02:01] he sees the saints of the ages and
[1:02:03] they're coming and they're walking in
[1:02:05] orderly fashion and they're marching to
[1:02:08] onward christian soldier but there's
[1:02:10] another group who thinks they have their
[1:02:13] own identity but they don't realize
[1:02:16] they're walking in an order with another
[1:02:18] group and they're just like them amen
[1:02:24] you know
[1:02:25] there was this man asked a young man all
[1:02:27] respect he says sir young man can i ask
[1:02:29] you a question
[1:02:31] and he said sure actually very polite
[1:02:32] young man but serious
[1:02:34] why do you dress like you do right
[1:02:37] bright red bloomers with his pants
[1:02:40] cinched underneath his bum
[1:02:43] why do you dress like that
[1:02:47] it's my identity
[1:02:50] he said here i've been walking on the
[1:02:52] streets of the city today and i just
[1:02:53] want you to go through here and just
[1:02:55] count these pictures of all these people
[1:02:57] that have the exact same identity you
[1:02:59] have
[1:03:04] my belt is different
[1:03:07] okay
[1:03:08] no problem
[1:03:10] we can do that
[1:03:11] but you see what has happened the spirit
[1:03:13] of the age
[1:03:14] all caught up
[1:03:16] but the greatest factor of this is the
[1:03:18] crisis
[1:03:19] that goes with it
[1:03:22] am i boring you to death
[1:03:24] amen so look at this now
[1:03:27] this is an age we live in
[1:03:29] that
[1:03:31] the program has replaced the power
[1:03:36] we have great programs come on sir
[1:03:39] church we we if we're not careful we say
[1:03:42] well we're we're separated from them no
[1:03:44] if we're not careful we'll give a
[1:03:47] program have a program that will replace
[1:03:50] and i say there is no replacement for
[1:03:53] the fire of god there's no replacement
[1:03:56] for the holy ghost in our life but we
[1:03:58] can have a program that will work
[1:04:03] you know vacation bible school they just
[1:04:05] touted it here some time back of how
[1:04:07] many years that it's been around and how
[1:04:09] effective it is but my brother and
[1:04:10] sister year after year vacation bible
[1:04:13] school is teaching the interpretation of
[1:04:18] the bible according to the people who
[1:04:20] are teaching it
[1:04:25] and i'm not saying all of that is evil
[1:04:26] don't misunderstand me
[1:04:28] but you realize
[1:04:30] train up a child
[1:04:35] what
[1:04:36] get them when they're young
[1:04:38] get them when they're young and they
[1:04:40] will not depart out of the teaching
[1:04:46] unless the holy ghost comes
[1:04:48] amen
[1:04:49] i'll tell you i still to this day
[1:04:51] rejoice of the preaching of our brother
[1:04:53] gideon retief when he was talking about
[1:04:55] breaking the cycle
[1:04:57] hallelujah you cannot get no don't get
[1:05:00] old in a tizzy saints that you know we
[1:05:02] come out of this we come out of that
[1:05:04] what about our children i'm telling you
[1:05:06] we serve a god that's here to break the
[1:05:08] cycle you say here and say well our
[1:05:10] family is like this right here break the
[1:05:12] cycle let god break the sign our family
[1:05:16] is dysfunctional break the cycle
[1:05:19] don't perpetuate it don't claim it don't
[1:05:22] make it a declaration my family's
[1:05:24] dysfunctional my family's this my family
[1:05:26] is that break that cycle
[1:05:29] and we can do that by stepping into the
[1:05:31] word and my brother and sister the
[1:05:33] refining fire comes down and it burns
[1:05:36] the dross out of you and i we don't have
[1:05:38] to say well i'm sorry i carry my family
[1:05:41] heritage with me no step in the fire let
[1:05:44] the fire burn that off of you
[1:05:47] the holy ghost will take that out it'll
[1:05:50] take away an old irish temper it'll take
[1:05:52] away a family that is easy to give up
[1:05:55] well we can't do this it'll break that
[1:05:57] speaker where you can stand up and say
[1:05:59] you know what it's not by my family
[1:06:01] heritage i'll make a rapture it's not by
[1:06:04] my grandpa or what he was or what has
[1:06:06] been down from the 1600s 17 18 19 2000
[1:06:12] it's not that it's going to put you in a
[1:06:13] rapture it's the power of almighty god
[1:06:16] our father our father that's the
[1:06:19] heritage
[1:06:20] that god is calling us why because he
[1:06:23] promised in his word he would preserve
[1:06:25] you and where the seed is he's made the
[1:06:28] promise i will preserve that seed and i
[1:06:31] will bring forth a people as he's
[1:06:34] speaking to abraham i'll bring forth the
[1:06:36] people as
[1:06:37] and people say well israel is not that
[1:06:39] big he wasn't talking about israel he
[1:06:41] was talking about a spiritual seed and i
[1:06:44] serve a god that would cause our eyes to
[1:06:46] turn from our own earthly carnal things
[1:06:50] and turn to the word of god and say i'm
[1:06:53] a son of god i'm a daughter of god i
[1:06:55] believe that i confess that i'm gonna
[1:06:58] project that
[1:07:00] i'm not going to project defeated to
[1:07:02] make a rapture because the word said and
[1:07:06] i believe that the word spoke to me
[1:07:09] amen
[1:07:12] you know brother brown said he's walking
[1:07:14] from the well with a bucket of water
[1:07:16] buckets of water
[1:07:18] and he got there at the tree in a
[1:07:19] whirlwind in a tree and a voice spoke to
[1:07:21] him
[1:07:23] and people would say that's utter
[1:07:24] nonsense
[1:07:26] that's just so outlandish
[1:07:30] maybe it's not a bucket of water in your
[1:07:32] hand and maybe it's not even a tree
[1:07:35] but to those of you that god has spoken
[1:07:37] to amen in the depths of your soul
[1:07:40] somebody say i don't believe in such
[1:07:42] nonsense
[1:07:43] you have to come to realization don't
[1:07:45] don't lower yourself
[1:07:46] right you know with the old phrase they
[1:07:48] say you know don't argue don't wrestle
[1:07:49] with a pig
[1:07:51] you'll both get dirty and he liked it
[1:07:55] don't go down there
[1:07:57] if they can't believe
[1:07:59] don't go down there
[1:08:01] but that don't take away from me what i
[1:08:03] know what god did for me
[1:08:05] they don't take away from me what god's
[1:08:06] done in my soul and what he spoke down
[1:08:08] in the very depths of my soul it only
[1:08:10] changed one iota god never spoke to them
[1:08:13] amen never move them in the spirit then
[1:08:15] my heart aches for them i'm not going to
[1:08:17] criticize them but my heart aches for
[1:08:19] him because we as a people have been led
[1:08:22] by the spirit of god
[1:08:24] amen and where the word has been made
[1:08:26] alive revelation the spirit of god is
[1:08:29] there to guide his people
[1:08:31] amen without that leadership hey what
[1:08:34] are we just another religion
[1:08:36] i'm not interested in religion
[1:08:39] amen
[1:08:41] look
[1:08:43] program replaces power
[1:08:45] or cold and formal is seen as
[1:08:47] sophisticated
[1:08:49] now you know some of you might think oh
[1:08:51] paul you must waste a lot of time and i
[1:08:53] might
[1:08:54] but sometimes it spurs me on
[1:08:59] reviews of a church
[1:09:03] how many of you looked up at church and
[1:09:05] looked at their reviews
[1:09:07] how many of you are just crazy enough
[1:09:09] waste your time that way
[1:09:12] when someone declares a church as
[1:09:14] sophisticated and they mean it as a
[1:09:16] compliment
[1:09:19] kind of makes you wonder
[1:09:22] how many sophisticated is there amongst
[1:09:24] us today
[1:09:26] those of you that come out of the
[1:09:27] highway
[1:09:29] and the byway
[1:09:31] and the alleys
[1:09:33] you miss the church lesson on
[1:09:35] sophistication
[1:09:38] i did too
[1:09:40] because after looking at that thought i
[1:09:41] couldn't find it
[1:09:43] because god chose only one you might say
[1:09:46] this is not actual drive it down home
[1:09:49] but
[1:09:51] my
[1:09:51] tax collector
[1:09:53] actually kind of sophisticated
[1:09:55] he had to be able to deal with the
[1:09:56] authorities
[1:09:58] at the same token
[1:10:00] he had to get tough with those people
[1:10:03] like gabriella
[1:10:05] yaomi
[1:10:07] 17.62 cents
[1:10:09] pay up in the name of the lord
[1:10:12] oh she just used a tap
[1:10:14] card
[1:10:16] good i guess you're paid out
[1:10:21] you see
[1:10:22] we're not called to be sophisticated
[1:10:24] in fact quite the opposite they come out
[1:10:26] of the upper room
[1:10:27] staggering around
[1:10:29] everybody says they're drunk on new wine
[1:10:32] well they were drunk all right and i
[1:10:33] want to get drunk like that
[1:10:35] i want to live in that world where i can
[1:10:37] get in the spirit of god so much that
[1:10:39] i'm not dependently isn't this once
[1:10:42] again the two spirits identified right
[1:10:45] in the word and then we have to decide
[1:10:47] whether you want someone to ste what joy
[1:10:50] in life you have but you notice what the
[1:10:52] devil says he says you go to church and
[1:10:54] man they just they're no fun they steal
[1:10:56] all the joy out of life what's your
[1:10:58] version of joy what's your version of
[1:11:00] life
[1:11:02] right
[1:11:04] but even then the devil will come and
[1:11:05] steal it
[1:11:07] [Music]
[1:11:09] i love history
[1:11:11] i was reading some history of man
[1:11:14] but they would partake in a vice like
[1:11:16] smoking a cigar
[1:11:18] and die early in their life from throat
[1:11:20] cancer
[1:11:23] so the devil anoints them to use their
[1:11:24] knowledge for warfare in this case he
[1:11:26] was a general in the army
[1:11:29] to do great things to write books on
[1:11:31] tactics of the enemy
[1:11:33] are you with me
[1:11:36] and then he himself fall
[1:11:38] to a tactic
[1:11:40] of the enemy
[1:11:42] come on saints let's not get it to where
[1:11:44] we can testify of god sent a prophet
[1:11:46] this is this this is that serve god do
[1:11:48] this but not a seed that's been
[1:11:50] hybridized but a seed that is back to
[1:11:53] the true original word of god amen that
[1:11:56] seed god said i will preserve amen he's
[1:12:00] speaking to abraham i'll preserve your
[1:12:02] seed
[1:12:04] your seed's not going to make it to the
[1:12:06] 21st century to the age we call laodicea
[1:12:09] it's not going to make it to a time of
[1:12:11] the great deceit and fall away then i
[1:12:15] will preserve your seed your seed will
[1:12:17] be there at the coming of the lord
[1:12:20] hallelujah let me hurry along here amen
[1:12:23] so we see the contrast
[1:12:26] amen now look what a contrast that is in
[1:12:28] the day we live in
[1:12:30] it is not how much knowledge we possess
[1:12:33] do you realize saints now i'm not
[1:12:34] speaking down on myself
[1:12:37] most of you think oh brother paul's just
[1:12:39] okay brother paul's dumber than a rock
[1:12:42] and i'm not degrading myself
[1:12:44] i'm telling you you know you know how
[1:12:46] you know i've done this before and felt
[1:12:48] embarrassed you know you're out after
[1:12:50] church you know
[1:12:51] it's like oh praise the lord you know
[1:12:53] somebody's like now brother paul that
[1:12:55] scripture now what was that scripture
[1:13:02] i don't remember
[1:13:03] you know how you feel my old age brother
[1:13:05] david problem was i was 40 when i
[1:13:07] started that
[1:13:11] but do you realize saints god didn't say
[1:13:13] i'm going to save you because you have a
[1:13:14] memory
[1:13:16] i'm not going to save you because you're
[1:13:17] smarter than the average bear
[1:13:19] i'll save you because you have this or
[1:13:21] you have that i'll save you because i
[1:13:24] jesus christ amen lord god almighty
[1:13:26] jehovah el shaddai place the seed down
[1:13:29] in you and i'll save you because that
[1:13:31] seed had life and it's my life i placed
[1:13:35] in you before there ever was even an
[1:13:37] earth a foundation of the earth was
[1:13:40] hallelujah i used to be embarrassed
[1:13:42] about that but i realized i don't care
[1:13:44] whether people think i'm smart or not
[1:13:46] don't think whether i can this or i can
[1:13:48] that what i know hey come on there's a
[1:13:50] few things i know and one thing i know
[1:13:53] is it work that god began in me he has
[1:13:56] promised to finish
[1:13:58] hallelujah i can stand on that i can
[1:14:01] hang my soul and the soul of my family
[1:14:04] and of my children and my grandchildren
[1:14:06] and of the saints of almighty god that
[1:14:08] this work he said i'm going to preserve
[1:14:11] you
[1:14:13] now we're not being preserved like a
[1:14:14] bunch of old pickles
[1:14:17] sit in a jar
[1:14:22] and everybody that's close to me is
[1:14:23] going to frown when they're all done
[1:14:25] they're going to pucker up when they're
[1:14:26] done i'm proud of this i contain great
[1:14:30] pucker power
[1:14:33] no sir
[1:14:35] we ought to be living such a life saint
[1:14:38] that when people get close to you
[1:14:40] something if they're struggling a little
[1:14:42] bit something in them comes to life
[1:14:45] something comes up and says you know
[1:14:46] what
[1:14:47] my god is real
[1:14:49] i see god working in them and i know the
[1:14:51] same god is in me that is in them and
[1:14:54] lord let it come to life and when it
[1:14:56] comes to life it's life-changing
[1:14:59] hallelujah why because he said i would
[1:15:00] preserve you amen and he didn't promise
[1:15:03] to do it with formaldehyde
[1:15:05] he promised to do it with the holy ghost
[1:15:08] he promised to do it with the power of
[1:15:10] his very life
[1:15:13] his life in you and i is our
[1:15:16] preservative
[1:15:18] oh hallelujah it's not how long our
[1:15:20] church has been to church
[1:15:23] come on i'll tell you the silliness
[1:15:24] that's even around our ranks
[1:15:27] is somebody said well we had a new
[1:15:28] family moved to town and i said oh they
[1:15:30] go to your church
[1:15:31] no
[1:15:32] they went over to the other one
[1:15:36] and i don't know why they would because
[1:15:37] we've been around in this city for 50
[1:15:39] years
[1:15:41] that other church has only been there
[1:15:42] for a couple
[1:15:46] i felt so bad because these thoughts in
[1:15:48] my head were like
[1:15:50] someday i need to visit this other
[1:15:51] church
[1:15:53] yeah
[1:15:54] because you're living
[1:15:56] like a rubbernecker
[1:15:59] when did your church start
[1:16:01] where we laid the first stone on this
[1:16:02] day at this time
[1:16:04] we laid the next stone at this time
[1:16:07] and we did this at this time
[1:16:10] okay
[1:16:12] when was the time that the holy ghost
[1:16:14] fell in your church
[1:16:17] 1978.
[1:16:20] i'm going to the other church
[1:16:23] that's right now i say that jokingly
[1:16:25] saints
[1:16:26] but let not grace tabernacle be the kind
[1:16:28] of church that's looking back of what it
[1:16:30] was we came from here and we did this
[1:16:32] and we are this and we've done that and
[1:16:35] our family knew this and our family knew
[1:16:37] them and come on i want a god that's
[1:16:40] present this morning i want a preserving
[1:16:43] power to fall in this building this
[1:16:45] morning and touch our children and touch
[1:16:47] our old people that we can stand and say
[1:16:49] you know what this message i believe
[1:16:52] this is a ever-present god in the time
[1:16:55] of my trouble and that means he's right
[1:16:57] here
[1:16:58] oh hallelujah
[1:17:00] i'd like to say it a little blunter but
[1:17:02] i don't think i will
[1:17:03] hallelujah what is it
[1:17:06] a very present god the fire of the holy
[1:17:08] ghost what does it do it turns a church
[1:17:12] on fire
[1:17:13] it burps the dross out it burns all the
[1:17:16] little false ideas well you know i was
[1:17:18] taught the prophet says this and said
[1:17:20] that and that's what we built our church
[1:17:22] on i'll tell you what i want to do i
[1:17:24] want to build my church that i go to not
[1:17:26] my church as it was but you know what
[1:17:28] i'm saying i want to build it on this
[1:17:31] hallelujah and it's ever present
[1:17:33] in other words if you're kind of feeling
[1:17:35] bummed you've got some hard things in
[1:17:36] your life
[1:17:38] and you say but i don't know i just kind
[1:17:41] of depressed i don't say this lightly
[1:17:43] saints
[1:17:46] and i don't know which way to turn and i
[1:17:47] don't know what to do and
[1:17:50] turn back to the fire
[1:17:53] go back to the fire
[1:17:55] do you realize that if they had called
[1:17:57] shadrach and meshach up the next week
[1:18:00] and made the same offer to them
[1:18:03] they would have went back to the fire
[1:18:06] and the next month
[1:18:08] and the next year
[1:18:10] of all the days of their life
[1:18:12] they would have been made that offer
[1:18:14] forsake him
[1:18:16] they just said
[1:18:18] send us to the fire
[1:18:19] you realize the devil
[1:18:22] you realize the devil's using all these
[1:18:24] things as it were a threat against you
[1:18:26] you're not a very good christian you had
[1:18:28] an outburst
[1:18:29] anybody had an outburst lately
[1:18:32] oh well a few of you are courageous amen
[1:18:34] i pray the lord give some more of you
[1:18:37] courage
[1:18:39] [Laughter]
[1:18:41] amen sister diane i love an honest heart
[1:18:45] i i managed sister diane just barely in
[1:18:48] time to bite my tongue
[1:18:50] it was just right there just
[1:18:57] but sometimes we miss
[1:18:59] and we don't get our tongue bit
[1:19:05] the devil

[1:19:09] i know you were on fire for the lord a
[1:19:11] year it too hallelujah well i'm telling
[1:19:14] you i'm not worried about it saints

[1:22:19] [Music]
[1:22:22] something that is undefiled that doesn't
[1:22:26] fade away

[1:22:54] and it tarnishes
[1:22:56] some of the finest metals on earth most
[1:22:58] anti-corrosive metals on earth but you
[1:23:01] put them out in the weather
[1:23:03] and over time
[1:23:04] it tarnishes
[1:23:07] [Music]
[1:23:10] but god called you and he called you out
[1:23:13] filled you up and sealed you
[1:23:16] and then he buried you in a bomb
[1:23:18] shelter no sir what did he do he sent us
[1:23:22] right back out
[1:23:25] and he said saints if you just give me
[1:23:27] this
[1:23:29] he said
[1:23:30] you wouldn't be corrupted
[1:23:33] and you wouldn't be defiled
[1:23:35] and you won't fade away
[1:23:38] no apathy
[1:23:40] in the bride

[1:23:47] heaven
[1:23:49] for you

[1:23:53] reservation
[1:23:54] amen it didn't come down we're not delta
[1:23:56] airlines hoping that the next flight's
[1:23:58] gonna go
[1:23:59] we're not there wondering if this is
[1:24:01] going to be walking in the grocery store
[1:24:03] remember the great things of the
[1:24:04] pandemic
[1:24:05] you know walk in the grocery store 42
[1:24:08] times burnt 200 worth of gas going to
[1:24:11] the store to find one package of toilet
[1:24:13] paper
[1:24:17] do you realize these spirits are all
[1:24:18] systematic of the world we live in
[1:24:21] people
[1:24:23] oh this is going to sound kind of
[1:24:24] judgmental as we close
[1:24:27] people going to
[1:24:28] church over
[1:24:31] and over
[1:24:32] and over again
[1:24:35] they're looking for something
[1:24:40] but they can't find it
[1:24:44] but the word of god said
[1:24:48] whatever your expectation is
[1:24:52] now look at this
[1:24:55] didn't put it on necessarily what the
[1:24:57] church had
[1:24:58] didn't put it on how good the preacher
[1:25:00] preached
[1:25:01] and long-winded or short or how
[1:25:03] confusing he was
[1:25:05] prophet of god said what you get
[1:25:08] will be your expectation
[1:25:10] [Music]
[1:25:12] come on if you know you're going to be
[1:25:14] blessed you're going to come
[1:25:16] looking for a blessing
[1:25:18] if you're looking to mark an attendance
[1:25:20] record you can mark your attendance
[1:25:22] record if you're looking to be part of
[1:25:23] the program and you're not worried about
[1:25:25] power you can satisfy that what is it we
[1:25:28] want
[1:25:29] what is it i tell you the holy ghost has
[1:25:31] preserved us
[1:25:32] and we're here and i believe just
[1:25:34] reading prophet of god talking about
[1:25:36] what the future would be and how some of
[1:25:38] these things had come and i just love
[1:25:40] this when the prophet of god said may
[1:25:42] these young men lord
[1:25:44] pick up this message
[1:25:46] come on
[1:25:47] somebody going to pick it up when he
[1:25:49] uses men remember what
[1:25:51] brother stephen brought it out so
[1:25:53] beautifully as a reminder when he said
[1:25:55] men
[1:25:56] it was inclusive
[1:25:58] right it's not just men
[1:26:01] you say but
[1:26:02] our sister's picking up the message
[1:26:04] i sure hope so
[1:26:07] because if they don't pick it up there's
[1:26:08] no hope for our children
[1:26:10] there's no hope for as the scripture
[1:26:12] says the elder women teaching the
[1:26:14] younger women there's no hope for those
[1:26:16] things to be fulfilled so god brought
[1:26:18] this word down and laid it out that
[1:26:20] there's going to be some people can
[1:26:21] somebody say i think i'm a people
[1:26:23] amen are you bots or people
[1:26:27] going to pick it up
[1:26:29] what did that do required effort
[1:26:31] required energy
[1:26:33] required desire
[1:26:35] and they're going to carry this
[1:26:37] right down to the coming of the lord
[1:26:40] i told brother chris the other day i
[1:26:41] hope i don't embarrass him
[1:26:45] told the other day chris
[1:26:48] just keep going doing that i won't go
[1:26:50] into our conversation but just do that
[1:26:52] because you see there'll come a day
[1:26:54] could come a day
[1:26:55] i know this sounds a little crass
[1:26:57] forgive me
[1:26:58] come a day he might be throwing dirt on
[1:27:00] my face
[1:27:02] committing my soul to the lord
[1:27:05] who's going to carry the word then
[1:27:08] who's going to pick it up and say we
[1:27:09] have a standard to carry
[1:27:11] we have a torch to light we've got a way
[1:27:14] to walk in and a confession to make and
[1:27:16] a word to fulfill

[1:31:17] up a
[1:31:18] jar
[1:31:19] you turn it around you look at the label
[1:31:21] now i'm not speaking ill of this
[1:31:23] [Music]
[1:31:26] some salt
[1:31:27] doctor says sodium's bad
[1:31:30] until it isn't

[1:31:43] it's got sugar in it
[1:31:45] [Music]
[1:31:49] you know what the devil's trying to do
[1:31:52] get you to take this word

[1:31:59] [Music]

[1:32:44] level
[1:32:46] [Music]
[1:32:48] don't become what we would really call a
[1:32:49] fanatic

[1:32:54] [Music]
[1:32:55] but by the same token
[1:32:58] don't put that on the shelf
[1:33:01] because i would be ashamed if god got a
[1:33:03] hold of me
[1:33:05] and i lifted my hands and i cried out
[1:33:07] and i screamed and i shouted
