[27:26] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah blessed
[27:32] be the name of the Lord hallelujah
[27:36] hallelujah I just want to say this
[27:39] evening now sometimes things slip our
[27:41] mind we just want to lift up our brother
[27:46] Isaac before the Lord this coming Friday
[27:52] he is scheduled to have a throat surgery
[27:57] they're going to go in there and take
[28:01] his tonsils and whatever out because
[28:06] he's just been having struggles they
[28:08] they did a sleep test I don't know if he
[28:10] shared this he probably didn't they did
[28:12] a sleep test and I don't remember the
[28:15] exact numbers but it was an astounding
[28:17] amount of times that he would stop
[28:20] breathing every night and the doctor
[28:23] said that sometimes the gap would be
[28:26] long enough they said that that would
[28:30] almost be enough for you just to stop
[28:32] breathing forever and so we just want to
[28:35] lift him up before the Lord they you
[28:39] know part of it I hope this doesn't
[28:42] sound bad but sometimes you know the
[28:46] doctor said we can give you a CPAP and
[28:49] brother Isaac said to cut on me
[28:53] he didn't want to have to spend every
[28:55] night the rest of his life you know or
[28:57] believing Lord would healing but to have
[28:59] this machine that goes our sister
[29:05] Dorothy oh I love her amen
[29:12] sister Joanne sister she's been many
[29:15] times to the church here an absolute
[29:18] sweetheart maybe I love her for the
[29:20] wrong reasons but she I never see her
[29:23] but what she's right there telling me
[29:26] brother Paul keep pressing on preach it
[29:29] don't don't veer from it stand on it be
[29:32] faithful she's always just speaking to
[29:35] me in that fashion and and we just want
[29:38] to lift her up before the Lord we were
[29:40] trying to figure out how to correctly
[29:41] pronounce that but her artery right here
[29:44] is carotid is is plugged I think was it
[29:50] 60% and so she had kind of you might say
[29:53] a mild stroke from that er no stroke
[29:58] wonderful amen praise the Lord lift our
[30:02] sister up before the Lord so amen thank
[30:07] you Lord and we want to remember brother
[30:10] Alex sister Ullaeus brother brother Alex
[30:15] will be driving this coming weekend
[30:18] leaving I believe Friday and traveling
[30:22] out west it's been a little bit of a
[30:26] process brother Alex has as you know
[30:32] voiced for quite some time his desire to
[30:35] come to Idaho and he's a young man of
[30:40] great faith determination and so let's
[30:45] remember him also in prayer so our
[30:47] brother Isaac our sister Dorothy our
[30:49] brother Alex and and I was just texting
[30:52] a little bit with brother Sergey he's in
[30:56] Wyoming headed west so just keep him in
[30:59] your prayers amen amen
[31:02] well with this thank the Lord you know I
[31:04] want to speak to you once again on
[31:05] preparations of the
[31:07] man now my brother and sister we can do
[31:09] a lot to take care of the outer man as
[31:11] we have spoke before we can take him to
[31:13] the fitness center we can give him
[31:15] vitamins we can get him to exercise and
[31:18] all of that's good we won't we won't
[31:19] speak ill of those things amen
[31:22] but what is the true importance as we
[31:26] know is what preparation we give the
[31:28] inner man and when the inner man is
[31:31] prepared well the Lord will take care of
[31:33] the outer man amen now you know I love
[31:36] this and and forgive my humor tonight
[31:38] but I remember one time brother Donnie
[31:40] just kind of speaking out to a situation
[31:44] and he said you know people come and you
[31:49] know they say oh I I have this issue
[31:51] brother Donnie would you pray for me and
[31:53] brother Donnie says and of course that's
[31:55] our job as ministry we pray for them and
[31:57] we believe God will touch them but he
[31:59] says you have to leave the Pepsi and the
[32:02] Cheetos and the chips and that other
[32:04] stuff alone amen so don't be eating
[32:07] those and then go to church and say pray
[32:09] for me
[32:09] amen so we have a responsibility to take
[32:12] care of this vessel and and we just
[32:15] believe the Lord knows our hearts and
[32:18] takes care of it let's stand to the
[32:19] reading of the word we'll go to 2nd
[32:21] Timothy amen I want to just continue
[32:24] kind of my thought on confidence in the
[32:27] finished work now as we spoke to you
[32:30] last week my brother and sister when we
[32:33] have confidence that brings trust now we
[32:38] understand that trust is often time
[32:40] based upon relationship right if you've
[32:43] come to a complete stranger you might
[32:46] have a more difficult time to trust them
[32:48] but you know there's been many times
[32:50] that God has allowed complete strangers
[32:53] to to do things in our lives and
[32:56] somewhere along the line we have to
[32:59] believe that God is in control and so as
[33:03] we look to what God is doing in our life
[33:05] we have to start trusting him and we see
[33:09] now that trust and confidence are tied
[33:11] together and trust confidence and faith
[33:13] are all of the same vein amen so you
[33:17] can't say I have faith but you don't
[33:19] trust God you
[33:21] say I have confidence but you won't
[33:23] trust or you won't have faith so those
[33:26] really go down this same vein and now we
[33:28] have in the natural we have a certain
[33:31] degree of faith confidence trust how
[33:34] many of you well hopefully nobody's
[33:36] driving a car like that but how many of
[33:38] you tonight
[33:39] just got in your car you put the key in
[33:41] the ignition you didn't think twice
[33:43] right
[33:44] you didn't say oh I hope this will start
[33:47] at different times of our lives with
[33:49] driven cars like that but there's just
[33:53] an innate value in humanity that we are
[33:57] shocked when it fails when we turn the
[34:01] key and nothing happens we're shocked in
[34:03] fact I've helped two people on the side
[34:06] of the highway before and you know just
[34:10] you pass them in the semi and they're in
[34:13] the middle of nowhere and you think that
[34:15] is not good looks like a you know when I
[34:17] say young that's relevant young woman
[34:20] children in the car they're 40 or 50
[34:22] miles from any kind of services and you
[34:26] just can't bring yourself to keep
[34:27] driving and so you pull over and I've
[34:30] walked almost a half a mile back up the
[34:32] freeway before to help people and you
[34:34] walk up there and the lady sitting in
[34:37] the car continually turning the key
[34:39] hearing this Illinois going click click
[34:41] click and getting weaker and I and she
[34:44] wouldn't roll the window down but I
[34:45] finally convinced her ma'am
[34:47] the car is not going to start so you
[34:50] need help and she's like well there
[34:53] there's no services here and I said I
[34:55] know so you're gonna have to just allow
[34:57] someone else to help you and you know
[35:01] they they have a hard time hard time to
[35:03] unlock the door hard time to allow
[35:06] someone to to have interaction with them
[35:09] and it's there because there's a fear so
[35:14] as sons and daughters of God if we will
[35:17] not trust God then ultimately down
[35:20] somewhere in the midst of all of that
[35:22] there's a fear there is a doubt there is
[35:25] something hindering and so my brother
[35:29] and sister sometimes what we got to do
[35:31] is not sit here and preach about you
[35:32] must have faith you must have faith
[35:34] you must have faith we need to stop and
[35:36] examine our life go back what is it
[35:40] we're afraid of when we figure out what
[35:44] it is we're afraid of
[35:45] now sometimes we're afraid because we
[35:47] were taught at some stage in our life we
[35:50] were taught to fear God not with
[35:52] reverence but with actual fear and I
[35:56] have encountered in times churches that
[36:00] were actually afraid of their pastor now
[36:04] my brother and sister how are you going
[36:05] to grow and move forward when you are
[36:09] afraid of where this is going what is
[36:12] going to happen is he preaching truth or
[36:15] is he not well do you know that that's
[36:17] really not the pastor's fault if you
[36:20] don't know whether he's preaching truth
[36:21] or not are you with me because we have
[36:25] laid at our fingertips every reference
[36:28] and every bit of the Bible we have all
[36:33] of that at our fingertips but what we
[36:36] have beyond that is the fact we've been
[36:39] given an unction the prophet of God
[36:42] spoke this and it should register with
[36:45] us that we can pray for revelation and
[36:47] our revelations not just oh I feel it in
[36:51] my heart right now I don't mean to speak
[36:54] ill but the the LDS the Mormons say well
[36:58] if you feel a burning in your in your
[37:01] heart or you know in your chest now
[37:03] that's a sign of the Holy Ghost my
[37:06] brother and sister that is not you'll
[37:08] not find anywhere in there the scripture
[37:11] says that our hearts are not to be
[37:13] trusted our hearts are deceitful amen
[37:17] scripture teaches us that it's not by
[37:20] education or theology that we confirm
[37:23] that but the scripture shows us that it
[37:26] is that personal relationship you
[37:28] praying for revelation praying for the
[37:32] Holy Ghost praying for this and God
[37:35] coming down and confirming it not with
[37:38] how we feel but by his word amen let's
[37:43] turn in second Timothy the first chapter
[37:45] verses 7 through 14
[37:48] sorry to keep you standing amen want to
[37:56] take a little bit of this just as
[37:58] foundational as we move forward
[38:00] you know sometimes the things that we
[38:04] think are common or have become common
[38:07] to us actually contain a great measure
[38:10] of benefit when we fully understand what
[38:13] we're reading and Timothy the first
[38:15] chapters seventh verse for God hath not
[38:19] given us the spirit of fear so first off
[38:23] let's well let me just read the
[38:25] scripture and not keep you standing for
[38:27] God hath not given us the spirit of fear
[38:29] but of power and of love and of a sound
[38:32] mind be not thou therefore ashamed of
[38:35] the testimony of our Lord nor of me his
[38:38] prisoner but be thou partaker of the
[38:41] afflictions of the Gospel according to
[38:44] the power of God who hath saved us not a
[38:48] question mark a statement who has saved
[38:52] us and called us with an holy calling
[38:56] not according to our works and I have to
[38:58] say thank you Lord but according to his
[39:01] own purpose and grace which was given us
[39:04] in Christ Jesus before the world began
[39:07] oh my but is now made manifest so
[39:11] started before the world amen but now is
[39:14] being revealed thank you Lord by the
[39:18] appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ who
[39:21] hath abolished death and hath brought
[39:23] life and immortality to light through
[39:26] the gospel where until I am appointed a
[39:29] preacher an apostle and a teacher of the
[39:31] Gentiles for the which cause I also
[39:34] suffer these things nevertheless I am
[39:37] not ashamed for I know who I am
[39:40] I have believed now when I take this and
[39:43] just make an emphasis for a minute
[39:45] he knows whom he has believed not heard
[39:48] of not been told about knows amen
[39:54] personal relationship amen
[40:02] Ronn know whom I have believed and am
[40:05] persuaded that he is able to keep all
[40:07] keep that which I have committed unto
[40:10] him against that day hold fast the form
[40:13] of sound words which thou has heard of
[40:15] me in faith and love which is in Christ
[40:18] Jesus that good thing which was
[40:21] committed unto thee keep by the Holy
[40:23] Ghost which dwelleth in us Heavenly
[40:27] Father we ask for your blessings upon
[40:28] the word tonight father for those that
[40:31] are part of the body Lord our brothers
[40:33] our sisters Lord unable to be here
[40:35] tonight working or whatever the
[40:37] circumstance might be father we just
[40:39] send your Holy Spirit out to each and
[40:41] every one lord give us unction father
[40:44] give us a rejoicing in our hearts and
[40:46] soul Lord to know that we have been
[40:49] called and Lord you have provided Lord
[40:52] we thank you for this in the name of
[40:53] Jesus Christ amen you may be seated I
[41:03] want you to just start there in verse 7
[41:05] and just touch on a few things quite
[41:07] quickly we move forward for God hath not
[41:10] given us the spirit of fear now remember
[41:13] one of the greatest gifts brother
[41:15] Branham speaks about that God would give
[41:17] us salvation is a great gift amen giving
[41:20] the Holy Ghost to us is a great gift and
[41:23] God was not obligated remember if there
[41:26] is any obligation that has been placed
[41:28] God put himself under obligation it was
[41:32] not something that that he did because
[41:34] he felt sorry for us but he knew exactly
[41:37] what he was doing so we are here and as
[41:40] we were just speaking in our preamble of
[41:42] the service tonight my brother and
[41:44] sister you see we've not been given the
[41:46] spirit of fear so if fear is something
[41:48] that has come in some segment of our
[41:51] life that has caused us to pull back or
[41:53] not completely trust God then we can
[41:56] recognize by the Word of God that this
[41:58] did not come from God amen so it's there
[42:01] that Satan watching us studying us as
[42:04] our greatest adversary he has come and
[42:07] he studied what it is and you can look
[42:09] in the world today and you can recognize
[42:10] the power of fear
[42:12] I was sitting today in a piece
[42:14] equipment for quite a few hours and
[42:16] after a bit there I had turned on the
[42:19] radio to listen for a little bit and
[42:22] people were calling into a radio station
[42:25] and he had asked them what they thought
[42:28] would be coming in the state of Idaho in
[42:31] the next little bit and you we heard
[42:34] everything from our governor is a tyrant
[42:37] and is trying to take over the state -
[42:40] he didn't do enough and all kinds of
[42:43] things and there was a common theme in
[42:45] the voices that I was hearing from the
[42:48] radio and I really felt like the Lord
[42:50] just kind of give me that unction to
[42:52] listen because it kind of fit with what
[42:54] we're speaking tonight and you hear in
[42:57] probably nine out of ten people there is
[43:00] fear there people are saying I'm so
[43:03] afraid some of them very vocal I'm so
[43:04] afraid of what will happen with our
[43:07] children I in the future what will
[43:09] happen with this what will happen I'm
[43:11] afraid and we have people moving here
[43:13] that have different ideas than what
[43:16] Idaho was founded on and I'm afraid of
[43:18] what our state is turning into I'm
[43:20] afraid of my job I'm afraid for my
[43:22] investment I'm afraid for my retirement
[43:25] and at this fear my brother and sister
[43:28] as it is spoken there would be people
[43:30] then call in and say yes as that person
[43:32] said I feel the same way and pretty soon
[43:35] you can feel a little spirit of
[43:37] oppression coming down you know that
[43:40] there was and finally I almost called
[43:42] the radio station myself amen but
[43:45] finally there was a man come on and said
[43:47] well I don't know what's gonna happen
[43:48] with everybody else but we have my wife
[43:51] and I have charted a course we have set
[43:54] a deal we have set ourself in a position
[43:56] that we will not be afraid we are not
[43:59] going to be controlled by fear we are
[44:01] living our lives our life is too short
[44:03] anyhow we will not give it up to this
[44:05] kind of a thing and and you know the
[44:07] radio commentator kind of I think
[44:10] playing as it were the devil's advocate
[44:12] said well what if and the guy said I
[44:14] don't care about your what if Amen
[44:17] hallelujah well my brother and sister
[44:19] what if the devil is roaring like a lion
[44:22] tonight
[44:23] amen he can't get into our position
[44:26] because our say
[44:27] she is in Jesus Christ and if he could
[44:31] defeat that then it's all a lost call
[44:33] but the Word of God has showed us and it
[44:35] is clearly proven that the name of the
[44:38] Lord is a strong tower and they believer
[44:40] a man sanctified amen justified
[44:43] sanctified washed in the blood it's in
[44:46] that strong tower and Satan cannot get
[44:50] into him amen so we are not going to be
[44:52] controlled by the spirit of fear
[44:54] we have questions amen I think it's fair
[44:57] to have questions brother Branham in
[44:59] several places says well I don't know
[45:01] you know this is not exact words but I
[45:03] don't know about tomorrow I don't know
[45:05] what will happen I don't know what's
[45:06] going to happen with my ministry but my
[45:09] brother and sister you didn't seem throw
[45:11] his hands up and say well if the devil
[45:13] will allow he always said Lord willing
[45:16] hey man it has nothing to do with Satan
[45:18] willing the devil willing amen all of
[45:21] Hell willing it's what the Lord said
[45:23] amen Lord willing hallelujah
[45:26] so it's there as we put into this we
[45:28] have not been given the spirit of fear
[45:31] if fear is on our doorstep if fear is in
[45:33] our home fear is in our mind my brother
[45:35] and sister it's time right now we don't
[45:38] need another time we stop right now and
[45:40] say Lord spirit of fear away from me
[45:43] Amen people I don't know will I have a
[45:45] job I thought it was interesting after
[45:48] all the city or the state of New York
[45:50] has been through I'm thinking was a city
[45:52] you know and they're recovering and and
[45:54] their mayor and their a governor of made
[45:56] these statements that are just so
[45:58] outlandish you know God didn't have any
[46:00] part of this we did this ourself and all
[46:02] of this stuff and now right when they're
[46:05] talking about we're gonna have a
[46:06] recovery they make an announcement that
[46:08] probably probably this fall they'll have
[46:12] to layoff 20,000 municipal workers what
[46:18] is it another spirit of fear they've
[46:23] removed God from the equation they're
[46:26] filling the void with fear now my
[46:30] brother and sister you know what will
[46:31] happen every municipal worker that
[46:34] thinks his job might be at risk I'll go
[46:38] into a state of absolute
[46:41] fear and if you don't think that they
[46:44] won't make their co-workers look bad to
[46:46] look good to keep their own job it is
[46:49] now they'll start being cannibals and
[46:51] feeding upon one another pushing each
[46:53] other so to speak under the bus because
[46:55] well I've got a mortgage I need it more
[46:58] than they do and it's there but my
[47:00] brother and sister why would you
[47:01] announce it probably will have to lay
[47:03] all these people off when they're
[47:05] talking months and months and months in
[47:07] advance what they should do is say you
[47:09] know what we might all want to tighten
[47:10] our belt or not and we might all need to
[47:12] just be as efficient as we can be but we
[47:15] can press forward and overcome this
[47:17] instead they offer up to the people the
[47:19] platter of fear oh my my brother and
[47:22] sister that will be a recipe straight
[47:24] out of the pits of hell amen well I'll
[47:27] tell you sometimes we we hear some of
[47:29] the preaching of different people
[47:31] different avenues and they're there
[47:33] preaching fear to their church amen you
[47:36] know look my brother and sister I'm
[47:38] sorry to just be kind of blunt but the
[47:40] devil and I aren't getting along lately
[47:41] we've been fussing quite a bit him and
[47:43] hey man he's been trying to do things
[47:45] and I've been kicking him in the teeth
[47:47] and I can't you know I just keep
[47:49] stomping on his fingers and you know you
[47:51] just get kind of a certain attitude
[47:52] about that you know you see some of them
[47:54] old slimy fingers creeping up over you
[47:56] might say the window seal there and I'm
[47:58] just keep chopping him off hey man I'm
[48:01] just tired of dealing with him I'm tired
[48:03] of talking to him I'm tired of dealing
[48:04] with the aftermath of what he's done
[48:06] when he comes tearing through there
[48:08] ain't man so you look at this the spirit
[48:10] of fear I'm sorry I won't embrace am I'm
[48:12] gonna stand upon this very verse right
[48:15] here ought to be enough to fundamentally
[48:18] put us in a position to claim every
[48:20] promise of God amen we should be able to
[48:22] claim every position that God has given
[48:24] right off of this via verse right here
[48:26] because he's not giving us can we say
[48:28] he's not giving me hey man he's not
[48:32] giving me the spirit of fear but he's
[48:34] given me hey man what is it in context
[48:37] now look I've out basically flunked out
[48:39] of school I'm not the brightest boy
[48:40] maybe we can put this in context he has
[48:43] not given me the spirit of fear so we're
[48:45] talking about giving is actually I don't
[48:47] have the right words for it but that's
[48:48] really what the the context of us coming
[48:50] down he gave a gift what was the gift it
[48:53] wasn't fear
[48:54] but it was of power hey men he gave me a
[48:57] gift of power oh we're not a church to
[49:01] sit back and say you know what I just
[49:03] hope and maybe this and maybe that I got
[49:05] a child not serving God a husband not
[49:07] serving God a wife not serving God
[49:08] whatever it might be and I and I hope no
[49:11] my brother and sister not of fear Amen
[49:14] but of power he gave me a gift he gave
[49:17] me a gift gave me a gift of power now
[49:19] the prophet of God we have to clarify
[49:20] this amen
[49:22] not just go off thinking we got the
[49:23] prophet of God said we don't actually
[49:25] have the power we've been given the
[49:27] authority to take the power of God and
[49:31] put it to work Amen well my brother and
[49:34] sister if you have the power you have to
[49:36] maintain it
[49:37] but if you just have authority to use
[49:39] the power then God Himself is obligated
[49:42] to maintain the power are you with me
[49:45] hey men and he says he's also given us a
[49:48] gift of love hallelujah you know how
[49:51] hard that can be sometimes come on
[49:58] doesn't feel like love when you slap
[50:02] somebody silly doesn't feel like love
[50:06] when you you're tense and you're
[50:08] struggling and all kinds of things are
[50:10] happening around you and all right are
[50:12] you with me
[50:13] amen but you know I just shared with you
[50:16] I should included this I thought about
[50:18] it but you know we just shared with you
[50:20] in a previous service here and that God
[50:22] would chasing us or write but didn't he
[50:26] say I chasing those I love amen
[50:31] sometimes getting whooped on and getting
[50:32] shook up a little bit and having oh I
[50:35] hope you get this oh I should have took
[50:37] that message book sister Jerry just
[50:38] shared with me
[50:39] it's going to sidetrack me and it just
[50:41] did but my brother and sister let just
[50:44] sister Jerry him that to me amen I've
[50:46] got to read that and Louise let me find
[50:48] that portion right here amen
[50:52] this is in perfect faith page 4 if you
[50:56] want to look at it that way paragraph 19
[50:58] now faith is based on forgiveness
[51:04] Oh hallelujah there are so many good
[51:07] things right here if I'm not careful
[51:08] I'll just breach that not what I was
[51:10] going to but my brother and sister faith
[51:12] is based on forgiveness and if we can't
[51:15] forgive then you're not going to see
[51:18] faith growth you are not going to be
[51:21] able it can come down to something
[51:22] totally in the carnal here but if you
[51:24] can't forgive on that you will never be
[51:27] able to trust God many people I hope
[51:30] this isn't with those here tonight but
[51:33] many people actually go through a stage
[51:36] of their life a season of their life
[51:38] angry at God and not trusting him now
[51:42] they say well if this would have been
[51:44] this if that would have been that and
[51:45] you know God's in control so why and
[51:48] they come to a place they don't trust
[51:50] God they're actually angry at God and
[51:53] they feel like God has betrayed them
[51:55] feel like God left them short you might
[51:57] say out in the wilderness and and so now
[51:59] they have something my brother and
[52:01] sister they have no hope I'm telling you
[52:04] they have no hope they will not trust
[52:07] humanity they will not trust God or turn
[52:11] it around vice versa if you won't trust
[52:14] God you won't trust humanity and so
[52:16] there comes a time that forgiveness is
[52:18] part of the faith that we need to have
[52:21] expressed in other words we believe God
[52:24] would take that anger or bitterness
[52:26] that's down in our heart from some
[52:28] portion of our life some circumstance in
[52:30] our life and that God can and will come
[52:33] and set that in order now if you don't
[52:35] believe that you will carry that all the
[52:38] days of your life never believing that
[52:40] God ever had your best interest in mind
[52:42] so you look at that and realize whether
[52:44] you're talking spiritually or naturally
[52:47] forgiveness is a key and so if you to
[52:50] grow spiritually there's brother Jason
[52:53] and I are talking in the back room for
[52:54] just a minute my brother and sister this
[52:56] time of year right now you want beans to
[52:58] grow it's starting to get hot beans are
[53:00] still little there's moisture in the
[53:02] ground you would think we'll sit back
[53:04] just let them they'll do it fine but you
[53:06] know what happens the best way to grow
[53:08] good beans is you don't irrigate them
[53:10] and then you go out and cultivate them
[53:12] and all of that surface moisture that
[53:15] was right there that all them little
[53:17] feeder roots were
[53:18] eating on you stir that up you get
[53:20] oxygen in there the moisture leaves and
[53:23] the beam cries because now it's sitting
[53:26] in what used to be a perfect environment
[53:30] but now it's mostly dry but you know
[53:33] what happens when it got stressed it's
[53:37] got two choices wither up or dig deeper
[53:44] well hallelujah thank you lord we're
[53:48] gonna dig deeper we're not gonna wither
[53:50] up we're not gonna blow away we're gonna
[53:52] dig deeper so you stir that dirt up I
[53:55] was in fairness for brother Jason you
[53:57] stir that dirt up and you just wait a
[53:59] few days don't go rushing back there to
[54:01] irrigate them you wait a few days those
[54:03] beans will double in size and you go the
[54:06] route my brother and sister that sitting
[54:08] in a wet ground will be about that deep
[54:11] and the route that is in dry ground will
[54:13] be about that deep hey man we got to get
[54:15] rooted down hey man we're not going to
[54:18] be tossed around by every wind of
[54:19] doctrine we're not going to get tossed
[54:21] around by every little thing that blows
[54:23] through the church yeah it might have
[54:25] tossed us for a moment but we're gonna
[54:26] be able to stand up and say the anchor
[54:28] holds hey man we're not we're not
[54:30] quitting we're not going away we're not
[54:32] giving up amen we're gonna call on the
[54:34] Lord amen and he said all that would
[54:36] call on the name of the Lord you draw
[54:38] nigh unto me I'll draw nigh unto you
[54:40] hallelujah oh look at that so we come my
[54:44] brother and sister and you know verse 9
[54:46] stirs my heart who has saved us this is
[54:48] a past tense and called us with a holy
[54:52] calling Amen not just not just any old
[54:54] kind of calling Amen we're not called to
[54:57] just live any old kind of life this was
[54:59] a holy calling a man not to be members
[55:02] of a church but to be part of this great
[55:05] kingdom of God amen
[55:07] which I thank the Lord see it's not
[55:09] according to our works but according to
[55:11] his own purpose and grace which was
[55:14] given us in Christ Jesus before the
[55:16] world began now look at this what was it
[55:19] now I know some people come along and
[55:21] they think you know you're messed up on
[55:23] the Godhead my brother and sister if we
[55:25] get so technical that we can't figure
[55:27] out brother Branham says you know it's
[55:29] all God
[55:32] you can call it the holy ghost you can
[55:34] call it the Sun you can call it the
[55:36] father you can call it creator you can
[55:38] call it Savior it's all gone
[55:41] amen so you look at this and realize my
[55:44] brother and sister met as God has come
[55:47] he chose to bring this redemptive power
[55:51] to you and I through Jesus Christ right
[55:54] now we know that all things were made
[55:56] for him and by him so Jesus Christ is
[55:58] not just a sideline it's not just
[56:01] something else but it is another
[56:03] expression of God himself as we've been
[56:06] taught and we believe amen that is his
[56:09] name has a name he chose to be
[56:12] represented in amen the name of Jesus
[56:15] Christ so as we look at that we realize
[56:18] now that this redemptive power this a
[56:20] word that has come this holy calling was
[56:24] brought to us which was given us in
[56:26] Christ Jesus so you're not going to find
[56:29] it right you're not going to go out and
[56:31] there's no other power that's going to
[56:33] bring us into the right position but
[56:34] Jesus Christ and so as we move forward
[56:37] into that to realize that as God through
[56:40] the word had come down john 1 and come
[56:43] down and revealed himself my brother and
[56:45] sister contained in that word was ever
[56:48] redemptive key that was already given us
[56:53] to loose it in our life so without that
[56:59] my brother and sister we can say well
[57:01] the Bible says and we'll touch on that
[57:03] just a few minutes the Bible says the
[57:05] Bible says but says it was now made
[57:07] verse 10 now made manifest by the
[57:10] appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ who
[57:12] hath abolished death and hath brought
[57:15] life and immortality to light through
[57:17] the gospel now remember when we talked
[57:20] about this go ye into all the world and
[57:22] preach the gospel the prophet of God
[57:23] said that's not going out in just
[57:25] preaching the word but it's preaching
[57:27] the life that is in the word amen so if
[57:30] we don't preach the life if we just read
[57:32] letter and we just talk about letter or
[57:34] we read quote we talk about quote my
[57:36] brother and sister if there's no life in
[57:38] that then it will be completely
[57:40] ineffective that's where we come to the
[57:42] place where brother Branham says I'm
[57:43] afraid we're getting people to church
[57:45] and not to Jesus Christ amen we don't
[57:48] want to get people just to church we
[57:49] want to get them to Christ hallelujah
[57:52] amen
[57:53] but it's now made manifest I love this
[57:56] you know my brother and sister it's been
[57:57] kind of a pet subject to mine for many
[58:00] years things being made manifest Amen
[58:02] you know it's there that you you get to
[58:06] see what has been spoken you get to see
[58:08] what has been promised you get to what
[58:10] has been revealed all coming forth we
[58:13] are seeing right now we could if we had
[58:15] absorbed ourselves into the day's news
[58:17] today I believe without a shadow of a
[58:19] doubt we would have been able to look at
[58:21] what is happening in the world today and
[58:23] correlate it back to the scripture and
[58:25] seeing prophecy made manifest in the day
[58:28] that we're living amen but you know just
[58:30] like every age were raising our children
[58:31] working a job we're doing this we're
[58:33] doing that and the very fulfillment of
[58:36] prophecy is slipping by so much so that
[58:38] they come one day and says wasn't Elias
[58:40] supposed to come see they completely
[58:44] missed it amen lord help us help us Lord
[58:50] don't let us don't let us have now now
[58:52] look I say this so nobody will be
[58:54] offended probably if I was a child today
[58:56] they would declare me a DD now that's
[58:58] fine I don't mind that own bother at all
[59:00] cuz you go look back through history all
[59:02] the guys that accomplished something had
[59:03] a DD but anyway my brother and sister
[59:06] you look at the world we're living in
[59:07] today they think we're a DD about this
[59:12] well praise the Lord
[59:14] I almost preached you tonight maybe
[59:16] we'll preach at another service almost
[59:17] preach to you tonight about the bride is
[59:20] a prepper y'all know what Preppers all
[59:24] right there the guy with well if you're
[59:26] a true prepper ammunition comes a B
[59:29] comes before F so if you're a true
[59:32] prepper and used to start through the
[59:34] alphabet hey man you'll come to
[59:36] ammunition before you'll come to a house
[59:38] sleeping bag food everything on the list
[59:41] so a true prepper always has lots of
[59:44] ammo but my brother and sister this
[59:45] Bride of Christ is a true prepper amen
[59:49] you know revelations 19 6 and 7 for the
[59:53] Lambs wife has made herself ready she
[59:55] has got every last thing that our Lord
[59:58] Jesus gave her on the lid
[59:59] to be ready and she has come down that
[1:00:01] list if you would and she's went through
[1:00:03] there and said M praise the Lord thank
[1:00:05] you Lord check that when does she become
[1:00:08] complacent because she's went through
[1:00:09] the list nope she goes right back and
[1:00:11] says Lord less I've missed something let
[1:00:13] me go back let me clean my lamp Lord let
[1:00:16] me make sure it's got oil let me make
[1:00:19] sure it's trimmed Lord because I'm not
[1:00:21] gonna miss this amen so as we look at
[1:00:24] this and realize what God is doing he is
[1:00:26] causing us to come into a place that we
[1:00:29] are now shifting from the things of this
[1:00:32] earth the focus of this earth amen now
[1:00:35] in verse 12 he says for which cause I
[1:00:37] also suffer these things nevertheless
[1:00:40] I'm not ashamed for I know whom I have
[1:00:43] believed so whatever the suffering that
[1:00:46] took place did not bring you know it's
[1:00:48] like to say well I'm an overcomer and be
[1:00:51] going through the hardest trial of your
[1:00:53] life the world out here says now how can
[1:00:56] you say you are an overcomer you are
[1:00:58] victorious and you're going through
[1:01:00] great physical problems great mental
[1:01:03] problems great financial problems maybe
[1:01:05] even some spiritual problem but my
[1:01:07] brother and sister whatever it is
[1:01:09] brother Kristin I was visiting for a few
[1:01:11] minutes last night
[1:01:12] it's whatever and this is proven my
[1:01:14] brother and sister not just a Prophet's
[1:01:15] quote but my brother's sister whatever
[1:01:17] you confess
[1:01:18] amen is what you will ultimately take a
[1:01:21] whole tub if you keep telling yourself
[1:01:23] that you're stupid you're foolish you're
[1:01:25] this you're that you're weak whatever it
[1:01:27] is you will find yourself manifesting
[1:01:30] that position that's why the prophet of
[1:01:32] God told us what you need to do is not
[1:01:34] speak the devil's language you need to
[1:01:36] stand up and say I'm a good Christian
[1:01:38] I'm filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:01:39] I'm an overcomer because ultimately that
[1:01:42] will propel you into claiming that
[1:01:44] position if you say a failure oh I tell
[1:01:47] you away too many brothers and sisters
[1:01:49] sitting around you know and they look at
[1:01:51] things in their life and they say well
[1:01:52] I'm a failure well my brothers sister
[1:01:54] you say that enough and you will
[1:01:56] manifest the desire and the expression
[1:01:59] of a failure but if you all set there
[1:02:01] regardless I don't care you know as it
[1:02:03] is that you fell I fell on your face you
[1:02:05] got mud on your face if you'll stand up
[1:02:07] and say Lord forgive me I am a son of
[1:02:10] God I am a daughter of God
[1:02:12] and you move forward my brother and
[1:02:14] sister well the word says he didn't do
[1:02:17] it because of your works so why would
[1:02:20] you halfway through the journey start
[1:02:21] measuring it by your works hey man I'm
[1:02:24] not talking about these people that are
[1:02:26] like praise the Lord I smoke drugs and I
[1:02:28] do this and I drink and I dance and I
[1:02:30] whatever but I'm a Christian no there's
[1:02:32] going to be a life to back it there's
[1:02:34] going to be an evidence that backs it up
[1:02:36] but don't let the devil short-circuit
[1:02:38] you halfway through and you start
[1:02:39] looking at your works trying to measure
[1:02:41] it up to it
[1:02:42] amen hallelujah now as we look at the
[1:02:45] word my brother and sister look at these
[1:02:46] promises that he has promised to us amen
[1:02:49] but we want to look at what he's not
[1:02:51] giving us and I want to go right back to
[1:02:52] the first verse here and as this
[1:02:54] reference and then we'll move on I want
[1:02:56] you to look at what he hasn't promised
[1:02:58] us he hasn't promised us that we would
[1:03:02] have a spirit of fear
[1:03:03] he hasn't promised us that would be
[1:03:06] powerless he hasn't promised us that we
[1:03:08] would have no love he hasn't promised us
[1:03:12] that our mind now you see that's one of
[1:03:16] the things that our nation people are
[1:03:18] struggling with right now it's a great
[1:03:19] big argument people are angry over the
[1:03:22] sound mind talking about mental illness
[1:03:24] my brother and sister we are not exempt
[1:03:26] right the Old Testament tells us that it
[1:03:28] happens to the rich and the poor and the
[1:03:30] righteous and the unrighteous but we
[1:03:32] don't have to accept Satan's verdict hey
[1:03:35] man that's the difference the Bride of
[1:03:37] Christ does not have to accept Satan's
[1:03:39] verdict and we can come and we can
[1:03:41] struggle in the flesh and some people
[1:03:43] they just get to a nervous they don't
[1:03:45] want to talk about it but my brother and
[1:03:47] sister now remember being a sound our
[1:03:49] unsound you might say mental illness is
[1:03:52] a more beautiful thing oh yeah beautiful
[1:03:55] brother Paul I don't understand well you
[1:03:57] could have a heart full of fear amen you
[1:04:00] might be troubled on one side but
[1:04:02] believe the Word of God you'll believe
[1:04:04] yourself brother wrong Spencer I love
[1:04:06] brother Ron's position he's there he's
[1:04:09] actually preached some services he's
[1:04:10] pressing forward he has good days he had
[1:04:13] bad days but he'll lean right over the
[1:04:15] pulpit and will declare to the people
[1:04:17] I'm going to preach myself right into a
[1:04:20] deliverance now the new me I'm not going
[1:04:22] to sit on the couch sit on a chair sit
[1:04:25] under a bench under a tree and go
[1:04:26] is me so I'm gonna preach myself right
[1:04:29] into a healing I'm gonna preach myself
[1:04:32] right into a deliverance
[1:04:34] come on preachers come on preachers come
[1:04:37] on family amen we can speak ourselves
[1:04:41] right into it because he didn't promise
[1:04:43] that these things would be absent from
[1:04:45] us he promised that these things would
[1:04:47] be given to us we can kick the spirit of
[1:04:49] fear out we can claim the spirit of love
[1:04:52] and of power and of a sound mind
[1:04:55] hallelujah this is the word this is
[1:04:57] God's promise to us now I hope that's
[1:05:00] not too blunt to you some people like I
[1:05:02] said get nervous about that but my
[1:05:04] brother and sister I'm telling you it's
[1:05:05] time we over all the sugar-coated it's
[1:05:09] time we get all the frosting off ain't
[1:05:11] been a good frosting won't hide a bad
[1:05:13] cake Oh it'll look pretty my brother and
[1:05:17] sister but the first bite will tell
[1:05:19] whether it's real or not

[1:06:31] to come in house of God and I want God
[1:06:33] to bless us that we come in here and we

[1:06:56] watered down calling amen

[1:07:01] Oh hallelujah think about it he wasn't
[1:07:04] looking at me he looked at his word and
[1:07:07] he is his word so he actually you might
[1:07:09] say looked at himself and said no matter
[1:07:11] what they are where they been where they
[1:07:14] come from or whether the devil's trying
[1:07:16] to take him I am more than sufficient to
[1:07:18] redeem them hallelujah and so I'm just
[1:07:22] going to call him redeemed amen even
[1:07:25] before the price was paid right before

[1:12:42] take this and you're gonna find that the

[1:15:43] that boat into a big ol rock and a
[1:15:45] Rapids you know and and had the the over
[1:15:48] rep Hertz on the boat just screaming and
[1:15:51] some guy says sir there's something
[1:15:53] wrong and he said I've got it all under
[1:15:54] control
[1:15:55] and now over rev limiters her just going
[1:15:58] and we just barely climbed up that
[1:16:02] Rapids and got out on top and we've also
[1:16:07] went back to went down that same chunk
[1:16:09] of river and one of the lowest points
[1:16:11] they said had been in 25 or 30 years and
[1:16:14] you know them rocks we were dodging that

[1:16:30] God is all there sometimes it's hid but
[1:16:37] did you know the human nature will cause
[1:16:39] us when the blessings of God are pouring
[1:16:41] overflowing we'll gripe and when it
[1:16:45] doesn't seem like there's any blessings
[1:16:47] of God we'll gripe
[1:16:51] did you know they've recently figured
[1:16:53] out that they're certain euphoric like
[1:16:57] enzymes released in humanity for certain
[1:17:01] things and when something is done did
[1:17:05] you know you can actually and I hope you
[1:17:09] catch the humor of this I I was like
[1:17:11] that's the truth they said there's
[1:17:14] certain things that will come to pass
[1:17:15] like you can put certain food down in
[1:17:19] front of somebody and they mentioned ice
[1:17:21] cream and the person not even touch it
[1:17:25] just see it and start salivating what is
[1:17:32] that it actually is some kind of little
[1:17:36] something that's released in you and
[1:17:38] your body responds and they said it can
[1:17:41] be so great that a person can just think
[1:17:44] a thought about something and a
[1:17:47] stimulation will come into their body
[1:17:49] over that font will half a part 3

[1:26:52] enjoying we are still veiled to them
[1:26:55] Outsiders I want you to think about the
[1:26:58] significance of that people say we don't
[1:27:01] understand why you believe what you
[1:27:03] believe we don't understand why this
[1:27:05] causes you to do that or why you put
[1:27:09] such emphasis on this well I'm telling
[1:27:14] you we're just simply veiled oh wait the
[1:27:18] Prophet just touched that in the next
[1:27:19] line if I just went on wouldn't it
[1:27:21] they think we're crazy enough again see
[1:27:24] see that's right but we who are in here
[1:27:27] in Christ baptized into him first
[1:27:30] Corinthians 12 into him we are partakers
[1:27:34] we're not just sitting here with this
[1:27:37] glory floating around Amen we're
[1:27:40] partakers I can tell you now I just want
[1:27:43] to put it in this way so you'll fully
[1:27:44] understand it you guys know me well
[1:27:46] enough if there's ice cream on your
[1:27:48] counter you don't have to ask me if I
[1:27:50] want some I'm a partaker oh how are you
[1:27:56] with me hallelujah
[1:27:58] so the Holy Ghost has come now the
[1:28:01] supernatural God unveiled himself to us
[1:28:05] and come down and said Here I am in your
[1:28:08] presence and now I want you to see that
[1:28:12] you are in me and I am in you and the
[1:28:15] glory of Almighty God is in me and if
[1:28:18] you're in me the glory of Almighty God
[1:28:20] has to be in you we're not sitting back
[1:28:23] and saying I hope so I hope so lord
[1:28:25] please let it be
[1:28:27] it's in you hallelujah God's not gonna
[1:28:31] give you revelation and then starve you
[1:28:34] to death hallelujah
[1:28:37] oh my brother Paul you understand my
[1:28:39] life I do understand your life do you
[1:28:42] understand the word he didn't do it on
[1:28:46] your merit he didn't do it on your works
[1:28:47] he did it because he claimed you before
[1:28:50] the foundation of the world and said hey
[1:28:52] I'm pouring my glory well Lord your
[1:28:56] glories just not enough to move me you
[1:29:00] better get afraid right there because
[1:29:03] the glory of God will either send you
[1:29:05] straight to heaven or send you straight
[1:29:06] to hell and when the glory of God you
[1:29:09] say glory of God yes it is my brother
[1:29:11] and sister the word will be our judge
[1:29:12] and the prophet of God said his word was
[1:29:16] his glory
[1:29:17] hmm well hallelujah had y'all excited
[1:29:23] now you're all frowning
[1:29:27] okay I wanted to hear that I wanted you
[1:29:31] to refute me you're wrong brother Paul I
[1:29:35] might have been quiet for a moment but I
[1:29:38] have not gave up nothing hallelujah
[1:29:44] whoa we are partakers of this glory see
[1:29:48] but not on the outside you're still
[1:29:50] looking in denying it see problem is we
[1:29:53] got way too many people that made it to
[1:29:55] the message but they never made it to
[1:29:56] Christ so now we are inviting into him
[1:30:01] to be partakers of all that he is were
[1:30:03] invited into him which is hid to
[1:30:06] unbelievers by the veil of human flesh
[1:30:09] they know that glory they read of it
[1:30:13] it's in the word here the glory of God
[1:30:16] and things like that it's just word to
[1:30:20] them but this is not word as in the word
[1:30:23] this is just we read it huh well if we
[1:30:29] knew the Arabic and understood what this
[1:30:35] word meant in the Hebrew come on I've
[1:30:39] had message believers tell me that well
[1:30:41] brother Paul we'd can't fully grasp that
[1:30:42] unless we was to go study Hebrew and the
[1:30:45] brother told me he says I've ordered a
[1:30:46] home study course on Hebrew I patted him
[1:30:49] on the back said god bless you brother
[1:30:51] study the Hebrew I think he probably
[1:30:53] thought I gave him permission but what
[1:30:55] he didn't realize is I started just
[1:30:57] distancing myself just in case that
[1:30:59] would rub off on me cuz one can you see
[1:31:03] brother Paul can't even get English
[1:31:04] right imagine him trying to do Hebrew I
[1:31:07] might as well just go out and become a
[1:31:09] drunk because I'd never make it through
[1:31:12] the Hebrew to understand God but you see
[1:31:16] that wasn't what my prophet told me he
[1:31:18] told me to pray for Revelation pray for
[1:31:20] it more than anything else
[1:31:22] and so I pray for Revelation I sent a
[1:31:25] loader I set an attractor I set in a
[1:31:27] drug lord please show yourself to me
[1:31:28] open your word to me Lord break live to
[1:31:31] me Lord I might not be the smartest
[1:31:33] knife and sharpest knife in the drawer
[1:31:35] but Lord I am a son of God I
[1:31:38] I'm cold I've been redeemed hallelujah
[1:31:44] they read it the glory of God things
[1:31:46] like that it's just word to them to us
[1:31:48] it's a manifestation oh my Bible tells
[1:31:53] me that I was in him before the
[1:31:55] foundation of the world
[1:31:56] hallelujah poured I've known you all my
[1:31:58] life Oh hallelujah see it's no more a
[1:32:03] word it's a reality God said let there
[1:32:07] be light that was the word oh I hope
[1:32:10] there's some stumble you I had to read
[1:32:11] this a lot of times before I started to
[1:32:13] recognize what was being said let there
[1:32:15] be light that was the word but now there
[1:32:18] is light it ain't the word did you catch
[1:32:25] that my brother and sister people are
[1:32:28] like we're waiting for prophecy to come
[1:32:30] to pass for the bride to be lifted up
[1:32:32] because a prophet of God said that we'd
[1:32:34] move beyond this it's not like a whole
[1:32:36] nother church age but we're moving
[1:32:37] beyond this into the bride age and we're
[1:32:39] waiting for that to be manifested and
[1:32:41] I'm there but what are you talking about
[1:32:43] I'm already living in it amen I've
[1:32:47] already been blessed I'm in the bride
[1:32:49] age the word has been opened amen the
[1:32:53] third pole is not a cliche Amen the
[1:32:56] opening of the seals is not a cliche
[1:32:58] Amen I get a live it it's a
[1:33:02] manifestation hallelujah so it's no
[1:33:06] longer let there be light the light has
[1:33:08] come Oh hallelujah the light is here it
[1:33:13] ain't a word is so light see what I mean
[1:33:15] now it isn't just a written word to us
[1:33:19] it's reality see we can sit back and say
[1:33:24] oh praise the Lord the Prophet said this
[1:33:25] the Prophet said that I was reading my
[1:33:27] Bible my brother and sisters someone on
[1:33:29] the face of the earth is a manifestation
[1:33:32] of a prophets message someone is living
[1:33:36] that life it's coming out of them it's
[1:33:40] being drawn right out of them Oh
[1:33:44] hallelujah somebody doesn't gotta go out

[1:34:13] just written word to us it's a reality
[1:34:15] we are in him now I know some folks
[1:34:20] around the message that would criticize
[1:34:22] me and say brother Paul you believe
[1:34:23] parousia well I don't know what your
[1:34:26] deal is but the problem with those kind
[1:34:28] of things is is people won't tell you
[1:34:31] their opinion but they want to hear
[1:34:32] their opinion come out of your mouth
[1:34:35] well I'm sorry Perugia is not all

[1:34:47] shortcut pilgrims progress kids how did
[1:34:52] that shortcut work it didn't now it
[1:35:02] isn't just a written word to us it's a
[1:35:03] reality we are in him now we're old sour

[1:39:46] they give you all this stuff and at the
[1:39:49] end of the Vacation Bible School all you

[1:39:53] it was like seven I had some reason it
[1:39:55] was seven but hey I'd be able to recite
[1:39:57] seven it's just Scripture
[1:39:59] [Music]
[1:40:00] and I remember the Vacation Bible School
[1:40:03] teacher chastising me in front of the
[1:40:06] other kids because I messed up my verses

[1:40:14] I've set night after night and read them
[1:40:16] and read them and read them I just
[1:40:20] couldn't remember she was like no that's
[1:40:24] not the second verse that's the fifth
[1:40:25] one I don't know maybe my mind just took
[1:40:29] me to the ones that were important to me
[1:40:31] I don't know but I don't need to be able
[1:40:35] to quote the encyclopedia of the word I
[1:40:38] don't need to be able to tell you every
