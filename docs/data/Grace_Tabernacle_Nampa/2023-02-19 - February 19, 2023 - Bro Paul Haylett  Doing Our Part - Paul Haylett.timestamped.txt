[31:47] hallelujah hallelujah
[31:50] amen
[31:57] just want to remember the grams sir
[32:03] just having a little time remember our
[32:06] sister April
[32:08] work schedules
[32:10] you know one of the trickiest things
[32:12] that Satan never did in this day and age
[32:16] was to try and turn the world into a
[32:18] 24-hour a day
[32:21] he took an
[32:23] distracted it it now becomes a world
[32:26] where jobs and different things just
[32:28] require us to
[32:30] you know as it were participate
[32:34] but as we speak today I just trust that
[32:37] we can just look into this and and catch
[32:39] a little bit
[32:40] amen I want to bring
[32:44] uh
[32:47] prayer request brother mellow I have not
[32:50] met him I'm going to try to this coming
[32:53] week see if I can get together with him
[32:57] um they're refugees I guess it'd be the
[32:59] status to put that and uh
[33:03] they are in my correspondence with them
[33:05] they're living in a motel and uh doesn't
[33:08] sound like they're being able to expand
[33:11] out as it were to find a home they don't
[33:13] have a car
[33:15] um so we just want to remember brother
[33:17] Mello and family in prayer God would
[33:21] just come on their behalf they've
[33:23] expressed if they can find a way to to
[33:26] come to church uh that they would desire
[33:31] to do that I bring greetings to you from
[33:34] the Ashdown family and uh just texting a
[33:38] little bit with brother Jason this
[33:40] morning
[33:41] and so uh we just share that greeting
[33:45] and um
[33:47] I don't know how many are going to be a
[33:49] bible study this evening
[33:52] amen
[33:54] I think our number is going to be small
[33:56] and and brother Sergey has offered to
[34:01] host the Bible study at his house and
[34:04] that way the children will have a little
[34:06] bit of a place to kind of move away from
[34:09] the Bible study so let's just make that
[34:13] official that Bible studies at five
[34:15] o'clock at Brother sergey's house and I
[34:18] don't know if Sister Yulia knows that or
[34:20] not but I guess she knows it now amen so
[34:25] um let's we'll just take up this offer
[34:27] from our brother Sergey sister Dorcas
[34:30] shared such a lovely testimony with me
[34:34] um
[34:35] that um we had prayer requests and we've
[34:39] been praying about that for Ella's eyes
[34:43] um for several months now
[34:46] um that you know the doctor's concerned
[34:48] her eyes being but sister Dorka shared
[34:51] that Ella's eyes are now improving to 75
[34:56] percent
[34:57] and uh my brother and sister I say thank
[35:00] you Lord for that let's just thank the
[35:02] Lord for that
[35:08] so let's not stop praying until her eyes
[35:12] are 100 percent amen we serve a God that
[35:17] does the supernatural there shouldn't
[35:19] even be a flicker of doubt in our minds
[35:23] that God will do this amen you know I I
[35:27] just I don't want to go into a slightly
[35:29] different subject but just in my studies
[35:31] coming across these different things
[35:33] that brother Branham said
[35:35] and he says you know if we would just
[35:38] believe that in all sincerity it would
[35:42] happen
[35:43] right now
[35:44] now insincerity my brother and sister
[35:46] would mean that part of our sincerity
[35:48] would have to be rooted in faith
[35:51] amen not just a whim not just a wish not
[35:54] a hope
[35:55] but rooted in faith and us a hundred
[35:59] percent believing that I say we have
[36:02] needs in this assembly amen would we
[36:05] just raise as it were our level our
[36:08] commitment just a little bit raise that
[36:11] up that we could come to a place that
[36:13] God would come and would honor every
[36:16] need that we have as a body of Believers
[36:19] amen we're not over here just hoping
[36:22] that God will do this but believing
[36:25] absolute God has already promised and he
[36:28] will deliver amen hallelujah
[36:33] and so as we just go
[36:37] turn into our our thought today I want
[36:40] to
[36:41] just speak to you on doing our part
[36:44] and uh so in this it's kind of rooted in
[36:48] a uh another thought bleeding over in my
[36:53] studies but if we'll turn to Matthew 22
[36:57] 1-4
[36:59] uh we'll just uh take this portion of
[37:03] scripture
[37:04] and draw our
[37:06] main thought from from this
[37:12] Matthew 22 1-4
[37:24] and Jesus answered and spake unto them
[37:27] again by parables
[37:29] aren't you glad today that God revealed
[37:31] the parable to us
[37:33] we're not sitting here in a question
[37:35] what does it all mean but God has opened
[37:37] his word to us that the parable has
[37:40] actually moved from Parable to life
[37:44] and we recognize it in life
[37:48] the Kingdom of Heaven is likened to a
[37:50] certain King which made a marriage for
[37:52] his son and sent forth his servants to
[37:55] call them that were bidden to the
[37:57] wedding and they would not come
[37:59] again he sent forth other servants
[38:01] saying tell them which are Bid and
[38:03] behold I have prepared my dinner my oxen
[38:07] and my fatlings are killed and all
[38:10] things are ready
[38:12] come unto the marriage Heavenly Father
[38:15] we just ask for your blessings this day
[38:18] father in this service Lord for many are
[38:21] not with us father traveling or feeling
[38:23] ill we just pray Lord that you would
[38:25] just reach out to every single one
[38:28] father and just touch their hearts their
[38:30] bodies strengthen them Father in spirit
[38:32] and Lord may they wherever they're at
[38:35] today just be able to Feast upon the
[38:39] word of God Amen to come into your
[38:41] presence Lord that the word would come
[38:44] and bring life to them let it be the
[38:46] substance father that strengthened them
[38:48] today as we move forward father to
[38:52] finish this race that you have called us
[38:54] to we ask this in the precious name of
[38:56] Jesus Christ amen
[38:59] you may be seated
[39:01] Hallelujah
[39:03] I like this as this come forth out of
[39:06] verse 4. to recognize
[39:10] the um the time that we're in my brother
[39:13] and sister it's not a time of a
[39:15] preparation as it were it's not a time
[39:18] to look far off in the future but as
[39:20] Matthew 22 as Jesus is speaking he says
[39:24] then I the the the dinner has been
[39:27] prepared the fatlings are killed all
[39:30] things are ready come unto the marriage
[39:32] now we're not trying to make a point for
[39:34] a timeline today my brother and sister
[39:36] we're wanting you to just understand the
[39:39] calling that God has placed into lives
[39:41] it is there the great invitation amen we
[39:45] look in Matthew 22 14 and it says for
[39:48] many are called but few are chosen and
[39:52] as we'll look at this and realize my
[39:54] brother and sister that the the calling
[39:57] it is there we'll look around the world
[39:59] today there are many people who are
[40:02] drawn to the things of the lord they're
[40:05] drawn to this scripture they're Drawn to
[40:08] Life and there's something that stirs
[40:10] within their heart but my brother and
[40:12] sister it is there in that that we
[40:15] recognize by this scripture that few are
[40:18] chosen and sometimes it comes down that
[40:20] people would say why did God not move or
[40:23] why did God not do this or that but
[40:25] you'll find often times that God lays
[40:28] something into the heart of humanity and
[40:32] some are that that uh anointing that
[40:35] comes upon them causes them to press in
[40:38] more than others and you'll see my
[40:41] brother and sister then in the whole
[40:43] Natural Life we'll find that there are
[40:46] those who are have dedicated their whole
[40:48] life to certain callings
[40:51] whether it be something of the nature of
[40:53] a missionary or a pastor or a a help or
[40:58] whatever it would be in the church or a
[41:01] scientist or whatever it might be and
[41:03] they just pour themselves in it and
[41:05] others they kind of work at it or at the
[41:08] fringes but never completely sold out to
[41:11] what this would cost them to to become
[41:15] this desire or this uh unction that is
[41:18] in them and so it is at time my brother
[41:22] and sister that the uh all things are
[41:24] ready and I I believe that right now we
[41:27] could honestly say all things are ready
[41:29] there is manifestations that need to
[41:31] take place there is uh uh part of the
[41:34] word that must still be fulfilled and
[41:37] maybe I could put it like this maybe
[41:39] it's even me that has got to be
[41:42] perfected a little bit more uh you know
[41:44] not to throw it off on somebody else
[41:46] like when you get ready we'll go in a
[41:48] Rapture maybe it's me that needs a
[41:51] little more refining but it is is that
[41:54] we press into that and it is we either
[41:56] choose my brother and sister the whole
[41:58] thing just studying in the message
[42:00] brother Brown talking about free moral
[42:02] agency you look at that and realize my
[42:05] brother and sister that even in the
[42:07] garden God did not come after the garden
[42:09] and say I'll give free more agency that
[42:11] the very establishment of the garden
[42:15] there was free moral agency
[42:17] and so it is in that there was a desire
[42:20] my brother and sister and we don't need
[42:23] to go into it this morning we all
[42:24] understand that but you see there had to
[42:27] be a desire to live what Jesus Christ
[42:30] has called us to live there it can't be
[42:33] from Form and Function I don't sound
[42:35] like judgmental or legalist but we look
[42:38] around us and we have quite a long
[42:41] history in this Valley uh amongst the
[42:43] Holiness people of knowing them
[42:45] acquainted with them rubbing shoulders
[42:47] from even my childhood and Jerry and I
[42:50] early marriage all the way to this day
[42:52] and my brother and sister we can look
[42:55] and see a slow but steady decline in the
[42:59] desire to live a Holiness type life and
[43:02] there's compromise in all of these
[43:04] things coming and we'll see this we
[43:07] could kind of I don't know we could make
[43:09] points but I don't think they're
[43:11] necessary and we see how there's been
[43:13] this steady decline and uh so as things
[43:16] are coming to be ready
[43:19] there's called to a marriage and my
[43:21] brother and sister you know there would
[43:23] be different outlooks on this and I'm
[43:24] not trying to make a Doctrine but my
[43:26] brother and sister the marriage
[43:29] in vow form
[43:31] has already taken place
[43:36] are you with me
[43:37] you say but we we haven't come to that
[43:40] my brother and sister understand it in
[43:43] The Vow
[43:44] the prophet of God come along and that's
[43:46] why he said we need to teach our young
[43:48] people from the word of God that this is
[43:51] not a game it's not something to play
[43:53] around at because the vow has power to
[43:56] it it's a binding force and so here we
[43:59] are my brother and sister in the hour
[44:01] that we're living in and we have not
[44:03] seen a Rapture yet but the Rapture is
[44:06] taking place are you with me amen it's
[44:08] not an event as a snapping of a finger
[44:11] but it is a catching away and God is
[44:14] catching his people out of this world
[44:16] that we live in and slow but sure is
[44:20] transforming them and bringing them into
[44:22] a place that they are no longer a
[44:24] creature of this Earth or its atmosphere
[44:26] but they're creatures of heaven and I
[44:29] say thank you Lord this might sound
[44:31] presumptuous because we all make
[44:33] mistakes but my brother and sister I'm
[44:35] here to declare to you this morning that
[44:37] we are closer to creatures of Heaven
[44:39] than we are creatures of Earth amen God
[44:42] is catching us away pulling us up out of
[44:45] the atmosphere that makes up this world
[44:48] today and so it's there as in verse 20
[44:51] uh 14 I mean chapter 22 verse 14 many
[44:55] are called but few are chosen and I want
[44:58] to make a declaration this morning I
[45:00] believe we are called and chosen amen
[45:03] that we are not just here to abide for a
[45:06] season until we become weary in
[45:08] well-doing and Fade Away into the sunset
[45:12] to be a distant memory my brother and
[45:14] sister I believe but we are in a time
[45:16] that God having chosen us is going to
[45:19] Manifest this choosing in a greater
[45:22] fashion each and every day but I've got
[45:25] to let him
[45:26] amen I've got to stand still long enough
[45:29] to be Washed by the Water of the word
[45:31] I've got to stand still long enough to
[45:33] be corrected
[45:36] if we're not careful we just get so busy
[45:38] go go go with life I've been there I can
[45:41] talk with authority but it is there my
[45:44] brother and sister at this calling and
[45:46] this choosing that God is changing our
[45:48] nature changing our desires it is no
[45:51] longer as it would be just to be
[45:53] successful
[45:54] now I want you to look for a moment this
[45:57] morning just how blessed we are
[46:01] brother and sister truly we are amongst
[46:04] the Most Blessed people on the face of
[46:06] the Earth today but you say but brother
[46:09] Paul there's some that are sick that's
[46:11] just an Earthly thing amen there's
[46:13] financial troubles that's just an
[46:16] Earthly thing my brother and sister
[46:18] there's all kinds of things that we
[46:20] focus on they're just Earthly things we
[46:24] get so caught up in this as though maybe
[46:26] this is a sign of what you know is a
[46:29] state of our spiritual world because
[46:31] we're having difficulties my brother and
[46:33] sister nowhere does it say that we'd be
[46:36] free from difficulties but what he did
[46:38] say is that we would be victorious in
[46:41] Jesus Christ amen the Earthly things if
[46:44] they are enough to distract us then by
[46:48] free moral agency we also have chosen
[46:54] God help us today to make the right
[46:56] choice
[46:57] not to be choosing the things that are
[47:00] Earthly sensual but to choose the things
[47:03] that are spiritual and uplifting drawing
[47:06] us into the presence of God
[47:09] I'll just Sidetrack for just a moment
[47:11] the Rich Young Ruler is such a to me the
[47:15] more I read it the more I study it the
[47:17] more phenomenal it is to me because my
[47:19] brother and sister it is almost a basic
[47:22] human instinct to try to gain and gather
[47:25] more a little more of this a little more
[47:28] of that and that is fine if God blesses
[47:31] you and you can buy a little bigger
[47:33] house or a little nicer car and do all
[47:36] these things there's no problem that is
[47:38] not a sign of a spiritual Decay but when
[47:41] that becomes our Focus there's the sign
[47:44] of spiritual decay
[47:46] amen but you look at how God is doing
[47:49] and we are coming and have been offered
[47:52] free moral agency every single day of
[47:54] Our Lives
[47:56] but we can come and you say but I've
[47:58] made a mistake or two brother Paul hey
[48:00] don't you thank the Lord for the blood
[48:02] today amen it's come down it's washed us
[48:05] from every mistake now mistakes are not
[48:08] what defines us amen it's where we stand
[48:12] when it's all said and done amen when
[48:15] it's all finished and we are blessed my
[48:18] brother and sister God didn't just call
[48:20] us to be part of a movement
[48:23] amen you can fly around the world as we
[48:26] just had to approach here a few weeks
[48:28] ago you know to go to Israel and then go
[48:30] on to South Africa and visit several
[48:33] churches in South Africa my brother and
[48:36] sister you can look around and and you
[48:39] just go around the Earth as it were and
[48:41] you get off a plane and someone picks
[48:43] you up and they take you and you start
[48:45] to interact and in just a little bit you
[48:48] feel like you've known this person
[48:50] forever but you could do that if you're
[48:52] a Baptist
[48:55] you can do that if you're Nazarene
[49:01] we're not called to a movement
[49:04] we're part of a movement but we weren't
[49:07] called to the movement
[49:09] amen
[49:10] amen we're not just part of a church
[49:13] it's human nature somebody says where do
[49:15] you go to church well I'm part of Grace
[49:19] well that's good nice identity
[49:22] but my brother and sister that's not
[49:24] really Who We Are
[49:26] Grace is a group of people that have
[49:30] been called and chosen amen it is not by
[49:34] accident God places us around the earth
[49:37] into positions or uh to occupy a place
[49:40] and have friends and rub shoulders as it
[49:43] were but my brother and sister that
[49:45] wasn't what God called us to amen he
[49:47] called us to the word and the word is
[49:49] what brings the family together
[49:52] it's a word that brings the body
[49:54] together it's a word that brings friends
[49:57] together
[49:59] amen it's not us Gathering and then
[50:01] trying to find the word it's just
[50:03] exactly the opposite amen but I want you
[50:06] to think about this how it is to be
[50:09] invited
[50:11] my brother and sister there are things
[50:13] that I call General invitations
[50:17] a general invitation would be to someone
[50:20] maybe you're halfway around the world
[50:22] and I would say this I try to be careful
[50:25] not to
[50:26] I would say if you're ever in Idaho
[50:29] brother come preach for us
[50:32] the odds of him ever being in Idaho are
[50:35] somewhere so close to zero
[50:38] that's a general invitation but when you
[50:41] have a real invitation that's when you
[50:43] say brother can you come I don't know
[50:46] the dates but can you pray and can you
[50:49] give us an answer and commit yourself to
[50:52] come and preach for us that is a
[50:54] specific invitation and the world today
[50:57] my brother and sister takes John 3 16
[50:59] and says we have been given the
[51:01] invitation but I want to tell you my
[51:04] brother and sister God got a lot more
[51:06] specific than that God come and said I
[51:10] have personally given you an invitation
[51:13] to come
[51:15] oh it's not just a general invitation my
[51:18] brother and sister because the word
[51:19] itself says that already God knew that
[51:22] many would not accept the invitation
[51:24] would not believe it enough to press
[51:26] into it now when I say believe it enough
[51:29] to press into it my brother and sister
[51:31] if it is
[51:33] a plane ticket
[51:35] and a brother says I'll come
[51:38] but he wakes up the day he's supposed to
[51:39] get on the plane and just says I don't
[51:41] feel like flying today
[51:45] that he didn't really
[51:47] fully accept the fullness of the
[51:50] invitation
[51:52] because when you accept the fullness the
[51:55] impatient
[51:57] my brother and sister you wake up
[51:59] unfortunately four or five hours early
[52:03] and you pack and repack and pack and
[52:05] repack and you scour the house from end
[52:08] to end ceiling to floor making sure you
[52:11] have everything you need and when you
[52:12] can't pick up the suitcase you unpack
[52:15] and pack it again
[52:17] and there's something there that you use
[52:19] like I'm gonna go I'm gonna be a part of
[52:21] what God is doing I'm going to speak and
[52:23] God's gonna answer amen and that's our
[52:26] heart's desire
[52:28] reminds me of a story once that was
[52:30] shared and these were two brothers the
[52:33] wives standing there
[52:37] so it wasn't anything behind someone's
[52:39] back and one brother says yeah my wife
[52:42] and I going to Hawaii
[52:44] I ask and he kinda turns his head a
[52:48] friend of mine if him and his wife
[52:49] wanted to come
[52:52] but they never
[52:53] pursued
[52:55] going
[52:57] the other brother looks at the floor
[52:59] and goes I didn't think you were serious
[53:06] is this the kind of invitation we've
[53:08] been given today that we would sit here
[53:10] today and say well I wasn't sure that
[53:13] the King was serious when he invited me
[53:16] to the wedding supper but what it would
[53:19] be that we would just have a absolute
[53:22] unrelenting faith in the word that has
[53:25] come to us and if the invitation has
[53:28] been expressed I'm gonna accept it I'll
[53:31] tell you what my brother and sister that
[53:33] makes you think that if anybody ever
[53:35] looked you in the face and says hey go
[53:37] to Hawaii with us maybe you should just
[53:40] say yes
[53:42] work out the details later
[53:48] but to not believe it was serious
[53:51] enough
[53:52] to show up this is what the scripture is
[53:56] sharing here the invitation was given
[53:58] but they never considered it serious
[54:01] enough
[54:02] to show up
[54:04] therefore the invitation was actually
[54:06] null and void to them
[54:08] now the word was spoken are you with me
[54:11] the word was spoken the invitation was
[54:15] spoke right you might say out into the
[54:17] ether
[54:18] but there had to be someone there that
[54:20] was sincere and believed it enough to
[54:23] say I accept that
[54:27] and obviously they didn't
[54:33] we have received a personal
[54:37] invitation from the King
[54:41] Can someone say yes
[54:43] yes I've received a personal invitation
[54:46] I didn't receive an invitation of an
[54:49] evangelist of a pastor of a message as
[54:53] it were my brother and sister I received
[54:55] a personal invitation from Jesus Christ
[54:59] amen him speaking to me lip to ear and I
[55:03] am here to say yes Lord yes
[55:06] Hallelujah
[55:08] you say well brother Paul what is this
[55:10] invitation
[55:11] well I tell you how the invitation was
[55:13] delivered
[55:15] right here
[55:17] in the word
[55:20] we didn't even know that we would be of
[55:23] quality
[55:25] of gentry enough
[55:28] to go to the King's house
[55:31] to a marriage supper
[55:36] but the invitation did not have any
[55:38] place to fill out to say I'm qualifying
[55:41] all it had if you would understand in
[55:44] the modern day that we live in
[55:47] a place
[55:48] to RSVP
[55:52] in other words your signature is
[55:54] sufficient enough
[55:57] to claim
[55:59] the reservation
[56:01] of the invitation
[56:08] Lord help us
[56:10] Lord help us
[56:13] the invitation's been given my brother
[56:15] and sister and
[56:19] I think too many times
[56:22] we're looking for some greater thing
[56:25] so holy spirit moves through the church
[56:29] maybe the Lord just moves upon your
[56:31] heart to lift a hand
[56:38] do we accept the invitation or decline
[56:40] it
[56:47] sometimes the preaching of the word
[56:49] stirs to
[56:51] maybe find an altar
[56:56] do we accept or decline
[57:01] the word asks for more of our time
[57:04] do we accept
[57:06] or decline
[57:09] more heartfelt
[57:12] worship
[57:14] my brother and sister I think sometimes
[57:16] we get a little confused
[57:19] of what worship really is
[57:22] it's it's lifting hands
[57:24] it's singing songs it's giving praise
[57:28] but we can do all of that mechanically
[57:32] real worship
[57:33] is from the very depths of one's soul
[57:38] giving praise to God
[57:41] will we accept or decline
[57:44] we can put it on the basis of I work
[57:46] hard I'm tired it's hard to do that it
[57:49] is but my brother and sister it's hard
[57:51] to look across the gulf and look and see
[57:53] Lazarus laying in the bosom and we are
[57:56] realizing we missed an opportunity
[57:59] that's what I would call hard
[58:03] the Rich Young Ruler my brother and
[58:05] sister is he's there looking and
[58:07] realizing a beggar who laid on the
[58:09] streets with sores that he himself could
[58:13] have solved that problem
[58:17] but unwilling because he didn't receive
[58:21] or accept that invitation
[58:25] I know I've shared this with the church
[58:27] many times but I believe it with all of
[58:29] my heart
[58:30] that the Rich Young Ruler in that
[58:32] situation my brother and sister if he
[58:34] would have simply answered Jesus and
[58:36] said I will sell everything I have I'll
[58:38] give it to the poor and I will follow
[58:41] you my brother and sister Gibson uh
[58:44] callings are without repentance and I
[58:46] don't believe the Rich Young Ruler could
[58:48] have outgiven God he would he would have
[58:50] sold something and God would have
[58:52] blessed him somewhere else and he would
[58:54] have by that natural ability been given
[58:56] become a conduit to do things for the
[58:59] gospel but all he could think about is
[59:01] if I have to sell my nice house my nice
[59:03] cars my airplane this that and the other
[59:06] all everything I've worked for I can't
[59:08] do that but what he didn't realize is
[59:11] God was just asking him surrender amen
[59:14] Just Surrender just give yourself up
[59:16] that's all I need you to do I already
[59:19] put these gifts in you I'm not stripping
[59:21] the gifts away from you right gifts and
[59:24] callings we always just look in the
[59:25] spiritual but my brother and sister it
[59:27] applies a natural typing spiritual and
[59:30] that gift was right there all the time
[59:32] God's not going to strip that gift from
[59:34] him God wanted free let me get let me
[59:37] stop here get my mind right God wanted
[59:39] permission
[59:41] to use the gift that he had gave him
[59:45] he wanted permission and if he would
[59:47] have said Lord whatever it is it's yours
[59:50] he would have still been able to live a
[59:51] good life and imagine the blessings that
[59:54] he had done and he would not have ended
[59:55] up in the Gulf looking across and seeing
[59:58] Lazarus laying in the bosom of Abraham
[1:00:01] wouldn't have happened
[1:00:02] but you see it come down my brother and
[1:00:04] sister that he had
[1:00:06] a personal invitation
[1:00:10] from the King
[1:00:12] and I want you to know that in one sense
[1:00:14] that was even more personal than your
[1:00:16] invitation and I only say that because
[1:00:18] it was literal face to face
[1:00:22] an invitation doesn't get any more
[1:00:24] personal than that it can come in a nice
[1:00:26] embossed envelope with all kinds of
[1:00:29] Scrolls and all kinds of whatever Swirls
[1:00:32] and whatever on it and you can open that
[1:00:33] up and your heart pitter-patters because
[1:00:35] you're invited to this wedding you're
[1:00:37] invited to this you're invited to that
[1:00:39] but my brother and sister nothing gets
[1:00:41] more important and personal than to
[1:00:43] stand face to face with the king of
[1:00:45] kings and be invited
[1:00:48] but by the word my brother and sister we
[1:00:50] have to understand the appearing and the
[1:00:52] coming of Christ and we understand my
[1:00:54] brother and sister that he has literally
[1:00:56] stood in front of you and I and invited
[1:00:58] us to a higher life invited us to a
[1:01:01] higher calling it is not my brother and
[1:01:03] sister just some thought out there in
[1:01:05] the in the ethernet but it is there a
[1:01:07] personal invitation and the word has
[1:01:10] become our invitation
[1:01:13] now look when the word comes
[1:01:15] I think you can say Amen to this I can I
[1:01:18] don't want to be too demonstrative to
[1:01:21] you but when the word comes it stirs up
[1:01:24] things we never knew was in US
[1:01:30] I remember a man one time saying praise
[1:01:33] God
[1:01:34] I'm living such a life I haven't had to
[1:01:37] repent for years over anything
[1:01:40] and I'm like
[1:01:43] well I'll tell you what on this
[1:01:44] teeter-totter of life I am on the
[1:01:46] absolute opposite end and I am repenting
[1:01:50] every day from everything from wanting
[1:01:54] well anyway we won't go there amen but
[1:01:56] now on this end of the teeter-totter and
[1:01:59] now you're on this end saying praise God
[1:02:01] the message has put you in a position
[1:02:03] you don't ever have to repent my brother
[1:02:06] and sister all I can do is fall back and
[1:02:08] the prophet of God said you should
[1:02:09] repent every single day
[1:02:11] amen so it's there then I I don't know
[1:02:14] what to say I don't know the man's life
[1:02:16] I just remember being stunned speechless
[1:02:19] by your statement such as that but I
[1:02:22] tell you my brother and sister the word
[1:02:23] when it comes stirs up things in us that
[1:02:25] we never knew was there let me take it
[1:02:28] on one side here that is the word has
[1:02:30] come and dredges all these little things
[1:02:33] out of our life that God says this is
[1:02:36] not going to be any good to you on the
[1:02:37] other side so we're going to take this
[1:02:39] out of your life and then on that we
[1:02:41] could really focus a lot but you're with
[1:02:43] me amen God dealing with us cleaning it
[1:02:46] out the spring is boiling all of the
[1:02:49] sticks and the trash out and on the
[1:02:51] other side my brother and sister would
[1:02:53] say I never thought that I would ever be
[1:02:55] doing this or be in this position or
[1:02:58] whatever and God sowing things that was
[1:03:01] in us that we never knew was there gifts
[1:03:05] that he wanted us to offer to the
[1:03:07] assembly to offer to him Gifts of helps
[1:03:10] and Gifts of service and Gifts of
[1:03:13] preaching the word or leading songs or
[1:03:15] being a prayer Warrior wow one of the
[1:03:18] most understated gifts that God has put
[1:03:21] in the church is the service of a prayer
[1:03:23] Warrior
[1:03:24] everybody's looking all we'll look at
[1:03:26] their position look at their position
[1:03:28] but what about the position that's
[1:03:30] behind closed doors and no one ever sees
[1:03:33] that but it's Faithfully served
[1:03:36] oh Hallelujah
[1:03:39] amen
[1:03:40] I think we can say Amen to this this
[1:03:43] morning that it serves up a hunger
[1:03:44] inside of us that we never knew existed
[1:03:50] cleaning house
[1:03:53] I think it's funny
[1:03:55] don't take this no one especially my
[1:03:58] wife
[1:04:00] but I think it's funny Human Nature
[1:04:02] we live in our houses don't we can a
[1:04:05] sister say Amen
[1:04:08] but you're going to have a lot of
[1:04:09] company
[1:04:11] and suddenly a whirlwind goes through
[1:04:12] the house
[1:04:14] talking this there and that there and
[1:04:16] these things here closet
[1:04:20] we clean house
[1:04:23] when the Holy Ghost comes and says you
[1:04:25] know what I'm taking you in a rapture
[1:04:28] that reaction that we have my brother
[1:04:30] and sister is he's coming
[1:04:32] we start going through the house and we
[1:04:34] start cleaning up the house amen it's
[1:04:37] just a human nature it's what God made
[1:04:39] us to be that way in the closer we get
[1:04:41] to the coming of the Lord my brother and
[1:04:43] sister is the more that it means to us
[1:04:46] amen it calls us a start with a little
[1:04:48] list of things
[1:04:50] and you'll find that in God's economy
[1:04:53] God's program nothing's too small for
[1:04:55] him to correct nothing's too small for
[1:04:58] him to sweep it you know the old phrase
[1:05:00] and literally I had a grandmother that
[1:05:02] was this way amen she would kick up one
[1:05:05] corner of the rug with a toe and if it
[1:05:07] was just a feather from the feather
[1:05:09] pillow or whatever yes sweep it under
[1:05:12] the rug
[1:05:17] hello
[1:05:20] yeah
[1:05:22] are any of us experienced
[1:05:24] and sweeping it under the road
[1:05:30] I should apologize
[1:05:34] a day or two goes by I would have
[1:05:36] apologized
[1:05:38] a few more days I would apologize if
[1:05:41] they would apologized
[1:05:44] a few months
[1:05:47] they deserved it
[1:05:50] what are we doing
[1:05:52] lifting it up with our toe
[1:05:55] sweeping it under the rug
[1:06:00] and then God comes along
[1:06:02] and says I want to take a good look at
[1:06:04] your house
[1:06:08] and because we are Sons and Daughters of
[1:06:10] God
[1:06:12] we're like Lord forgive me I've been
[1:06:14] sweeping stuff under the Rock
[1:06:16] father I didn't really mean to and I
[1:06:19] knew it wasn't right help me Lord
[1:06:24] and we clean these things out
[1:06:26] and our lives change
[1:06:28] the prophet of God said sometimes these
[1:06:31] things there's not healings there's not
[1:06:33] deliverances there's not all of these
[1:06:35] things because there's just little
[1:06:38] things
[1:06:40] now we can put that as unconfessed sins
[1:06:43] my brother and sister but that sounds so
[1:06:44] harsh so we're going to be polite this
[1:06:46] morning and just say you've got a lot of
[1:06:49] feathers under the rug
[1:06:51] it's not even dirt it's feathers
[1:06:55] but it has the same effect of hindering
[1:06:57] or life that we're not moving forward to
[1:07:00] see the supernatural now look at this it
[1:07:03] causes us to clean the littlest of
[1:07:04] things and you know our desire to be
[1:07:07] immersed my brother and sister is the
[1:07:09] same desire to be baptized in the name
[1:07:12] of the Lord Jesus Christ is this same
[1:07:15] desire to be immersed in the washing of
[1:07:17] the water of the word every single day
[1:07:19] in other words a Believer comes to a
[1:07:22] time in his life that he wants to be
[1:07:24] baptized because he's going to let the
[1:07:26] world know and let the Lord Jesus know
[1:07:28] I'm going to serve you Lord and that is
[1:07:31] that same anointing my brother and
[1:07:32] sister that comes at 12 years old 14 25
[1:07:37] 40 50 70 90. it's the same anointing
[1:07:42] that comes on there I want to be
[1:07:43] immersed I want to be put down
[1:07:46] underneath this I want to testify I'm
[1:07:49] serving you Lord and the word of God my
[1:07:52] brother and sister comes washes over us
[1:07:54] immerses us in the presence of God and
[1:07:57] then suddenly the little specks and the
[1:08:00] little feathers and the little dirt
[1:08:01] under the rug starts to fade because
[1:08:04] we're cleaning it up
[1:08:06] now
[1:08:08] are we making sense enough for you to
[1:08:10] follow me this morning
[1:08:12] in the sermon things that are to be
[1:08:15] brother Brown says now how am I going to
[1:08:18] teach them algebra when they won't even
[1:08:21] learn their always believe Christ I mean
[1:08:23] ABCs
[1:08:25] when they won't even do the common thing
[1:08:27] see the natural thing how are you going
[1:08:29] to tell them high things when you won't
[1:08:32] even start when you want to get on top
[1:08:35] the ladder before you hit the first and
[1:08:38] I'll finish this for him rung
[1:08:40] and now look at the Spirit of the world
[1:08:42] we live in let me just deviate all off a
[1:08:44] little bit
[1:08:46] parents worked for
[1:08:48] 30 years
[1:08:49] raise their children
[1:08:51] finally have a decent house and drive a
[1:08:54] nice car
[1:08:55] we have a generation now that is also
[1:08:58] causing this influx of debt that is
[1:09:01] binding and hindering
[1:09:03] people because they get out of college
[1:09:06] they get offered a good job
[1:09:08] they go buy a house bigger than mom and
[1:09:11] dad ever had
[1:09:12] and they drive new cars and then they
[1:09:15] call Dave Ramsey and say Dave Ramsey I
[1:09:18] make a hundred and forty thousand
[1:09:19] dollars a year
[1:09:21] and I'm broke
[1:09:24] that's just a natural example
[1:09:28] o children
[1:09:31] parents
[1:09:33] there's nothing wrong
[1:09:36] with being frugal
[1:09:39] hmm
[1:09:40] we could get in technicalities and
[1:09:42] realize you go buy a brand new car and
[1:09:44] before you get home it's a used car
[1:09:47] you turn around drive it back to the
[1:09:48] dealer they'll offer you ten thousand
[1:09:50] less dollars than that what you paid
[1:09:52] driving it off the lot and so we look at
[1:09:55] this now I want to bring this back into
[1:09:57] a spiritual element that it is there my
[1:09:59] brother and sister how that people would
[1:10:02] come and they get and they they get this
[1:10:05] and they come and they get saved
[1:10:08] overnight
[1:10:10] they're an authority
[1:10:13] on how to live the message
[1:10:19] now I want you to understand the
[1:10:20] disappointment they feel
[1:10:24] when they fall down the first time
[1:10:26] you notice I didn't say when they fall
[1:10:28] down it's just the first time
[1:10:32] because what God is doing is seasoning
[1:10:34] us
[1:10:35] this is nothing don't misunderstand this
[1:10:37] is not against him spiritually or as an
[1:10:39] individual this is the journey that God
[1:10:42] is taking us on and as it is we are
[1:10:45] being trained my brother and sister a
[1:10:47] free moral agency training that when we
[1:10:50] fall down God says now what are you
[1:10:52] going to do
[1:10:54] what are you gonna do and we've seen
[1:10:56] many people get up and walk away they
[1:10:58] said well if this is what it's like
[1:11:00] serving God I'm not going to do it but
[1:11:02] there's something of a predestinated
[1:11:04] seed that when they fall down and the is
[1:11:07] there Satan's saying yep see you can't
[1:11:09] do it the predestinated seed gets up and
[1:11:12] says thank you Lord for the lesson thank
[1:11:15] you Lord I'm going to do my best and I'm
[1:11:17] going to press on and they start moving
[1:11:19] forward and the devil wants to show them
[1:11:22] and make them it look as though they're
[1:11:24] not real Christians
[1:11:26] but I'm telling you my brother and
[1:11:28] sister this is the process that God
[1:11:30] brings so they want to get on top the
[1:11:33] ladder before you hit the first that's
[1:11:35] the reason you fall
[1:11:37] see they're putting this is nature of
[1:11:39] humanity they're putting themselves up
[1:11:42] here where they cannot support it with
[1:11:45] the word and character
[1:11:47] it's not enough just to have word my
[1:11:49] brother and sister
[1:11:50] many people have carried the word and
[1:11:53] failed miserably we need the word and we
[1:11:57] need character and in here I'm using the
[1:11:59] word character but we need the Holy
[1:12:01] Ghost and the Holy Ghost has promised to
[1:12:04] purge us Amen to walk to burn out all
[1:12:07] the dross and that is what molds a
[1:12:10] character into Sons and Daughters of God
[1:12:12] that we couldn't stand there should be
[1:12:14] no shame my brother and sister in US
[1:12:16] walking and having things that we
[1:12:18] stumble over but we want to appear
[1:12:22] amen we want to appear as though we have
[1:12:25] this Firm Foundation
[1:12:27] so then as we look at this
[1:12:30] see I Never Promised You today and make
[1:12:32] you all shout and be happy
[1:12:34] begin at the bottom
[1:12:37] and climb right on up as God leads you
[1:12:41] up
[1:12:42] see
[1:12:44] cope your life and ever follow every bit
[1:12:48] of the word that God has ordained for
[1:12:51] you to do now this word cope my brother
[1:12:53] and sister is to deal effectively
[1:12:57] so let me just read it to you that way
[1:12:59] amen begin at the bottom climb right on
[1:13:02] up as God leads you up see deal
[1:13:05] effectively with your life and ever
[1:13:07] follow every bit of the word that God
[1:13:09] ordained for you to do amen don't just
[1:13:12] say well praise God and toss it off to
[1:13:15] the side take it and deal effectively
[1:13:23] reading an article the other day of a
[1:13:26] very large I think it's a Fortune 100
[1:13:29] company
[1:13:32] and they were having young men and young
[1:13:34] women
[1:13:35] whose resumes were perfect
[1:13:38] they had
[1:13:39] Masters and phds in business
[1:13:44] and their resumes were perfect that they
[1:13:47] should be able to perform this job
[1:13:49] and literally this company the HR
[1:13:52] Manager for this company was saying we
[1:13:56] have these people and we realize the
[1:13:58] universities are not teaching them what
[1:14:02] is necessary at this level of business
[1:14:08] like graduates from University be given
[1:14:11] positions to manage things that require
[1:14:14] the management skill to deal with
[1:14:17] hundreds of millions of dollars
[1:14:19] which reminds me if you ever see
[1:14:21] hundreds of millions of dollars you
[1:14:23] don't know what to do with it just start
[1:14:25] subtracting the zeros off the end and if
[1:14:28] you can't manage a hundred dollars don't
[1:14:30] dare try managing a hundred million
[1:14:34] and finally this company says we're no
[1:14:37] longer hiring from resumes we interview
[1:14:39] people and we evaluate them what oh
[1:14:44] catch this word what is their character
[1:14:49] and we found that we can teach them what
[1:14:52] we need to teach them if their character
[1:14:54] is solid
[1:14:56] wow all them tens and hundreds of
[1:14:59] thousands they spent to get a masters
[1:15:01] and a PhD means nothing if you don't
[1:15:04] have
[1:15:09] wow
[1:15:12] I thought it was an interesting article
[1:15:16] went Holmen
[1:15:18] looked at things around our house and
[1:15:20] was going to take some zeros off and
[1:15:21] realized we were already there
[1:15:30] hmm
[1:15:32] now think how that God we should behave
[1:15:35] ourselves and act like Christians our
[1:15:37] conducts should be like Christians
[1:15:39] because we are aliens here this is what
[1:15:42] I was referring to earlier this is not
[1:15:44] our home no we're just put here
[1:15:47] temporarily
[1:15:48] now some people's temporary is a little
[1:15:51] more temporary than others
[1:15:54] I'm telling you my brother and sister
[1:15:56] I'll speak openly of it I still I've
[1:15:58] watched part of brother Gideon's funeral
[1:16:00] this morning and set my office and cried
[1:16:04] a man with so much I'm going to use the
[1:16:07] word talent I don't mean it that way
[1:16:09] but so much to give to the body of
[1:16:11] Believers has such an impact
[1:16:15] and at 62 years old or three what is it
[1:16:18] four
[1:16:20] gone
[1:16:23] a huge void
[1:16:26] so some of us temporary is more
[1:16:28] temporary than others temporary some
[1:16:32] temporary might be 90 years old brother
[1:16:34] Bob sister Joanne
[1:16:36] but it still comes down it's still
[1:16:38] temporary
[1:16:39] this world is not our home this is not
[1:16:41] what God called us to do God help us
[1:16:44] that our Focus could move amen my
[1:16:46] brother and sister you don't go spend
[1:16:48] your life's fortune on a house you're
[1:16:50] going to live in temporarily
[1:16:54] you spend it on what matters
[1:16:57] now look at this this is not our home
[1:16:59] we're just put here temporarily we've
[1:17:01] got to go every one of us tonight now
[1:17:04] think if God in his Mercy has the mother
[1:17:07] before the little baby is born is
[1:17:09] craving some vitamin the mother's word
[1:17:12] speaks forth dad I want cantaloupe you
[1:17:15] Brothers will know what brother Brown is
[1:17:17] talking about I want cantaloupe or I
[1:17:19] want watermelon I want something or
[1:17:21] another it's out of why he'll do
[1:17:24] everything he can to get that because he
[1:17:26] knows that he wants his child born as
[1:17:29] perfect as it can be see he'll do
[1:17:31] everything that he's able to do to get
[1:17:34] it how much more Abel or I like that I
[1:17:38] love brother branham's English how much
[1:17:40] more abeler is he to get it he's a
[1:17:43] Creator now think how able he is to
[1:17:46] prepare us a body to live like his own
[1:17:49] glorious body if we want to live
[1:17:52] oh how much more abler hallelujah amen
[1:17:58] there is something in US calls to live
[1:18:02] amen amen this is that invitation from
[1:18:04] the word my brother and sister God
[1:18:06] didn't have to come down and roll it out
[1:18:09] and pamper us all he had to do is put
[1:18:12] forth and what was already placed in US
[1:18:15] starts to respond to that amen because
[1:18:19] there's something we want and we want to
[1:18:22] live amen there is something in us that
[1:18:25] calls to do right then God will call
[1:18:28] somebody on the platform or the pulpit
[1:18:30] that will preach the absolute truth why
[1:18:33] see it shows you then if you're a real
[1:18:36] child of God you begin to cry out my
[1:18:39] brother and sister we got to get away
[1:18:41] from this babysitting Believers that
[1:18:44] we're doing where we're going to Pat him
[1:18:46] on the back and tell them now you know
[1:18:48] God's going to take this away from you
[1:18:50] someday how about there be a believer
[1:18:53] that would stand and cry out and say
[1:18:56] Lord deliver me from this I need
[1:18:58] deliverance from a spirit I need
[1:19:01] deliverance from a addiction or
[1:19:03] something I need it Lord not be given an
[1:19:07] opportunity well just whenever patty
[1:19:10] cake along but we're coming to A Time my
[1:19:13] brother and sister the clock is ticking
[1:19:15] down we're coming to a Time the games
[1:19:18] should be over
[1:19:20] we should be able to stand and say Lord
[1:19:22] I need deliverance and I'm not gonna I'm
[1:19:26] not gonna step away until I have what I
[1:19:29] need Lauren
[1:19:30] now you're a real child of God you begin
[1:19:33] to cry out God take it away from me
[1:19:35] circumcise me from this take these
[1:19:38] things away from me now my brother and
[1:19:40] sister we don't speak down every one of
[1:19:43] us has and we'll face in our life times
[1:19:45] that we will come to situations like
[1:19:47] this that God's bringing us what is it a
[1:19:50] test a free moral agency a time what do
[1:19:53] you want more you want loud to see a
[1:19:55] more or do you want me more just as he
[1:19:58] stood there before those temples there
[1:20:01] amen the headwaters of the Jordan River
[1:20:04] and he speaks to Peter and there's the
[1:20:07] backdrop of all these temples and he's
[1:20:10] looking at Peter and he's saying Peter
[1:20:13] who do you say I am
[1:20:17] Peter didn't look have to look up there
[1:20:20] well they offer nicer fellowships a
[1:20:23] bigger Church a choir they offer they
[1:20:26] offer no sir something down in the heart
[1:20:31] Jesus didn't want to know what everybody
[1:20:33] else said he wanted to know what we say
[1:20:36] he wants to know today what we're going
[1:20:39] to say about our circumstance in life
[1:20:41] you say brother Paul my circumstance is
[1:20:43] pretty hard and maybe I would say yes
[1:20:45] brother it's pretty hard but what is it
[1:20:48] you want what is the desire of your
[1:20:51] heart and if you want deliverance from
[1:20:54] that then cry out Lord circumcise me
[1:20:58] amen circumcise me from this Lord I want
[1:21:02] Deliverance
[1:21:04] God take it away not pastor
[1:21:07] not someone else speak to the Lord
[1:21:12] why
[1:21:14] it's needed for your heavenly home that
[1:21:17] you're going to
[1:21:18] where he's gone to prepare
[1:21:21] you got to be a real word bride of
[1:21:24] Christ
[1:21:25] now I want to put this two ways my
[1:21:28] brother and sister there's things that
[1:21:29] we have
[1:21:30] that we will not need on the other side
[1:21:34] God's asking us to free will allow him
[1:21:36] to take this away from us
[1:21:40] and there are things that we need on the
[1:21:42] other side
[1:21:44] that God is here Desiring to give to us
[1:21:46] more than we even desire to have it
[1:21:53] think about it
[1:21:56] you say well brother Paul life is hard I
[1:21:59] agree it is hard
[1:22:01] it is hard
[1:22:04] but how much harder it is
[1:22:07] without the full manifestation of Jesus
[1:22:10] Christ
[1:22:15] Life as a Christian can we say Amen Life
[1:22:17] as a Christian is hard
[1:22:20] but my brother and sister it's much
[1:22:21] harder without him
[1:22:23] much harder it looks like these people
[1:22:25] have an easy time but I tell you what my
[1:22:28] brother and sister I won't go into this
[1:22:29] it's kind of grisly but I'm telling you
[1:22:31] people think oh if I just had a few
[1:22:33] million dollars all my problems would be
[1:22:35] over I tell you if you had a few million
[1:22:37] dollars your problems would just be
[1:22:38] starting
[1:22:41] amen
[1:22:42] now this sounds harsh but there's a lot
[1:22:45] of Believers my brother and sister that
[1:22:46] would crash and burn if they suddenly
[1:22:48] had a few million dollars
[1:22:51] and God knows our nature you say brother
[1:22:53] Paul are you judging them no I'm just
[1:22:56] looking at character
[1:22:58] statement of facts we're just looking at
[1:23:01] character my brother and sister and it
[1:23:03] comes down that it is a situation this
[1:23:05] might sound a little harsh forgive me if
[1:23:07] it does but here again if you can't
[1:23:09] manage that hundred dollar bill
[1:23:12] why would you ask God to give you tens
[1:23:16] of thousands or Millions
[1:23:23] hmm
[1:23:31] stewardship
[1:23:34] stewardship
[1:23:39] wow
[1:23:40] I think we'll just move on real quick
[1:23:42] here
[1:23:44] you see God didn't give us a
[1:23:46] manufactured response Saints
[1:23:48] every response that comes from
[1:23:50] misunderic daughter of God that's
[1:23:51] anointed by the word of God is an
[1:23:53] organic response and there's some things
[1:23:55] abilities right that are brought out by
[1:23:57] the word the Deep calling as the prophet
[1:24:00] of God showed us the Deep calling
[1:24:01] there's a deep responding and if there's
[1:24:03] nothing in there to respond to the call
[1:24:05] then what are we going to do we can
[1:24:07] manufacture but brother and sister the
[1:24:10] Deep calls to the predestinated it may
[1:24:13] take some time right we look out and see
[1:24:15] people that don't seem to be living
[1:24:17] right and people don't you know they
[1:24:18] kind of say well they must not be no my
[1:24:20] brother and sister don't judge them just
[1:24:22] let God do the work amen what the word
[1:24:25] will do is come down upon them a word
[1:24:29] here and a word there right this line
[1:24:31] upon line precept upon precept Works in
[1:24:33] a multitude of ways not just one
[1:24:35] singular way and they'll be out here my
[1:24:37] brother and sister and it might be out
[1:24:39] of respect that they'll bow their head
[1:24:40] when somebody prays for the food and
[1:24:42] there'll be something that was said in
[1:24:44] that prayer that registers with them and
[1:24:46] then they go on as though nothing is
[1:24:48] happening and people are like woe unto
[1:24:50] us our children or siblings our parents
[1:24:52] or whatever it might be but God is
[1:24:55] working and he'll be stocking up that
[1:24:57] word in such a fashion and one day it
[1:25:00] starts to affect them amen I want to get
[1:25:02] into this uh much this way but you know
[1:25:05] my brother shared this certain uh
[1:25:07] natural pill that he takes it helps your
[1:25:09] blood circulation and uh he even gave me
[1:25:12] a bottle that's not super expensive I
[1:25:14] don't think but you know he says no Paul
[1:25:16] you know you take this I believe in it
[1:25:19] enough I'm going to give this to you and
[1:25:21] then he says now look hey Paul
[1:25:24] um I'm not buying you another bottle I'm
[1:25:26] not giving you no more of this but it
[1:25:27] might take more than just what that time
[1:25:29] is or that one bottle to affect you
[1:25:33] but it works
[1:25:36] he's standing there in front of me
[1:25:37] personal testimony it works
[1:25:41] okay good
[1:25:44] good it works
[1:25:46] I'm patiently waiting
[1:25:48] for it to work
[1:25:53] are you with me
[1:25:55] patiently waiting
[1:25:58] I know it's something we don't often do
[1:26:01] is pray for patience
[1:26:04] but God help us
[1:26:05] that when these things start to build
[1:26:08] line upon line amen that we don't say
[1:26:10] well I spoke to him about this and they
[1:26:13] didn't respond no don't worry about it
[1:26:15] just come and when God anoints you pile
[1:26:18] something else on top of that and then
[1:26:20] one day something starts to stir in
[1:26:22] their heart and they get tired of being
[1:26:24] unhappy amen they get tired of feeling
[1:26:26] lonely they get tired of feeling like
[1:26:29] they're living in a vacuum and one day
[1:26:31] something happens amen and it starts to
[1:26:33] affect them and then they start to have
[1:26:36] a response to the word and I don't know
[1:26:38] if this will go out and I don't mean any
[1:26:39] ill by this but maybe I'll just censor
[1:26:42] the names but there's been a young
[1:26:44] sister she's no longer young got
[1:26:47] children growing up and getting married
[1:26:48] that has been away from the word of God
[1:26:51] for years now and people are like well
[1:26:53] you know she's a preacher's daughter
[1:26:55] when's she gonna get her life right my
[1:26:57] brother and sister there was a testimony
[1:26:59] it's in God's hands it's in God's time
[1:27:02] and the time has come and she gave her
[1:27:05] heart back to the Lord and then the
[1:27:07] naysayer said is it real
[1:27:11] God didn't give you a title of judging
[1:27:13] whether it's real or not God gave us the
[1:27:16] title of believer oh let that be
[1:27:20] manifested from us I'm a Believer maybe
[1:27:23] they're in a rocky place and they
[1:27:25] haven't shed all the habits but I
[1:27:27] believe maybe they're in a more mature
[1:27:29] place but still have something I believe
[1:27:31] maybe they're coming into another
[1:27:33] position and the word is opening for
[1:27:36] them and they don't quite unders I
[1:27:38] believe
[1:27:41] God didn't offer us a selective unbelief
[1:27:43] option
[1:27:45] amen
[1:27:46] it may take time and you say brother
[1:27:49] Paul are you confident yes I am I'm
[1:27:51] talking about real Believers because the
[1:27:52] word said it can't return void
[1:27:55] amen just let the word cast The Bread on
[1:27:58] the water let the word go let the word
[1:28:00] do the work that the word is supposed to
[1:28:03] do I can't do it you imagine if God give
[1:28:06] us an ability to just bring everyone in
[1:28:09] we would be spending our last dime on
[1:28:12] airline tickets flying wherever our
[1:28:14] family was at and we would be pulling
[1:28:16] them in and pulling them in and pulling
[1:28:18] them in and we wouldn't care because
[1:28:20] they would be serving God but God says
[1:28:23] You cast your bread
[1:28:24] you put your prayers before the throne
[1:28:27] my word cannot return void
[1:28:30] amen we've got to do our part my brother
[1:28:33] and sister and our part is not to
[1:28:36] condemn our part is to live amen
[1:28:39] Hallelujah
[1:28:42] oh and when it starts to affect them
[1:28:44] they start
[1:28:48] the prophet of God said paraphrasing
[1:28:50] this
[1:28:51] the word will never lead you away from
[1:28:54] the word
[1:28:55] aren't you glad amen let's do our part
[1:28:58] amen amen I encourage you Saints feed on
[1:29:01] the word
[1:29:02] let this Living Word change us
[1:29:05] yes sir amen boldly pursue as our
[1:29:07] brother Stephen these aren't his exact
[1:29:09] words but a foundation he laid let's
[1:29:11] boldly pursue the leadership of the Holy
[1:29:13] Ghost
[1:29:14] amen amen
[1:29:16] now look I'm going to touch on something
[1:29:17] that might seem a little bit judgmental
[1:29:19] but I don't believe it to be judgmental
[1:29:24] in the news if you follow anything at
[1:29:27] all there's been a great Revival at a
[1:29:29] college back east
[1:29:31] now my brother sister Webster's
[1:29:34] definition of a Revival
[1:29:36] is a comeback
[1:29:38] Reviving again bringing them back to
[1:29:42] something
[1:29:45] what will they come back to
[1:29:49] now don't take this judgmental
[1:29:51] what will they come back to
[1:29:55] is this of God
[1:29:57] only time will tell
[1:30:01] what will it produce
[1:30:04] only time
[1:30:05] will tell
[1:30:13] if you watch the video
[1:30:16] you see everything
[1:30:18] that we would consider wrong
[1:30:21] about worship
[1:30:24] the clothes
[1:30:28] young men
[1:30:31] that are there with their
[1:30:33] I don't know when time changed Saints
[1:30:35] but you know if you roll your bowl Cap
[1:30:38] you're out of fashion
[1:30:41] now you got to wear your ball cap with
[1:30:43] the brim perfectly flat
[1:30:45] and that little sticker that's on the
[1:30:47] bill that says a genuine whatever hat
[1:30:50] has to stay on there you can never take
[1:30:52] that off
[1:30:56] and they're standing there
[1:30:58] in their Sports
[1:31:00] their tank tops
[1:31:02] the young men with their hats
[1:31:08] everything that's contrary
[1:31:12] to us
[1:31:17] there can't be anything good there
[1:31:21] some of their leadership
[1:31:24] talking about how a Triune God
[1:31:29] the father has come and stirred them by
[1:31:31] the spirit
[1:31:33] and everything we're just like what
[1:31:37] but one thing I want to remind you
[1:31:40] if there is one
[1:31:42] son or daughter of God
[1:31:46] that the fire gets lit
[1:31:49] and God puts an unction of a deep coin
[1:31:54] and that goes out we can be critical
[1:31:56] we're message Believers we know the word
[1:31:59] we've been taken back truth truth we can
[1:32:01] take it back to the Bible we can dice it
[1:32:03] up and we can put it all back in its
[1:32:05] place but my brother and sister God
[1:32:07] works in ways beyond our understanding
[1:32:11] do we call it a Revival in the sense
[1:32:13] they would call it a Revival probably
[1:32:15] not but if there be just one son or
[1:32:18] daughter of God that finds himself
[1:32:21] standing in that Auditorium with hands
[1:32:23] lifted saying forgive me Lord I need you
[1:32:26] Lord Jesus my brother and sister God
[1:32:29] said it would be ten thousand worlds
[1:32:31] worth
[1:32:35] but to balance this we also realize that
[1:32:38] they would come out of the scripture
[1:32:41] that there would come a time of
[1:32:43] worshiping of Satan believing they're
[1:32:47] worshiping God
[1:32:48] that's hard
[1:32:50] see it's not even me that's being harsh
[1:32:52] here this is just the word
[1:32:55] but I tell you my brother and sister
[1:32:57] lest I would
[1:32:59] patty cake this thing
[1:33:01] let us make sure that we
[1:33:04] are not worshiping
[1:33:05] something besides what we believe we're
[1:33:07] worshiping
[1:33:09] let us make sure that we are worshiping
[1:33:12] a one true and living God our Lord Jesus
[1:33:16] Christ
[1:33:17] Hallelujah
[1:33:19] amen
[1:33:21] oh Hallelujah you see this revival my
[1:33:25] brother and sister one last comment
[1:33:26] about this revival if this revival is
[1:33:29] genuine it will lead these young people
[1:33:31] back to the word
[1:33:33] and if our Revival
[1:33:35] are we having a Revival
[1:33:39] come on I'm not trying to trick you are
[1:33:41] we having a Revival
[1:33:42] if we're not we better go find a Revival
[1:33:46] because this is God's word calling us
[1:33:49] back to the word amen this is his word
[1:33:53] calling us back to him
[1:33:55] we should be having a Revival every
[1:33:58] single day it shouldn't have to have a
[1:34:00] banner in front of the church and
[1:34:02] highlights and flyers in the
[1:34:03] neighborhood it shouldn't be advertised
[1:34:05] on the internet it shouldn't have to be
[1:34:07] done it should be burning in the hearts
[1:34:10] of Sons and Daughters of God every
[1:34:12] single day revive Me O Lord bring me
[1:34:16] back to my rightful position I was in
[1:34:19] you before the foundation of the world I
[1:34:21] was placed here in this day not my
[1:34:24] residence but just place here for a
[1:34:27] period of time and Lord I want to go
[1:34:30] back and you say I want to go back lord
[1:34:32] I don't want to stay here I want to go
[1:34:35] back where I come from
[1:34:37] want to go back in your presence
[1:34:40] oh Hallelujah
[1:34:43] sister Ruth if you'll come
[1:34:47] and the sermon doors in a door
[1:34:57] a sheep has wool
[1:35:00] that's the only thing it has it it can't
[1:35:02] manufacture that wool
[1:35:05] we're not asked to manufacture the
[1:35:07] spirit of the fruit of the spirit but to
[1:35:11] Bear the Fruit of the Spirit
[1:35:13] see one is external one is internal
[1:35:19] and as long as it's a sheep it'll bear
[1:35:22] amen aren't you glad saints that we can
[1:35:25] lift a hand today and say thank you Lord
[1:35:27] I will
[1:35:29] manufacture no
[1:35:32] no bear
[1:35:34] I will bear the fruit of the spirit I
[1:35:37] will bear the very word of God is going
[1:35:40] to come right back out of me it's not
[1:35:42] all about what is put into me but it is
[1:35:46] also what comes back out of me
[1:35:51] I don't have to manufacture the glands
[1:35:53] and everything in it is sheep it'll make
[1:35:57] wool because the inside of him has the
[1:36:00] glands and the adrenaline and all this
[1:36:01] stuff it takes to make wool and when you
[1:36:04] are a Christian
[1:36:05] you'll
[1:36:07] cope
[1:36:09] hmm
[1:36:11] yes do we remember what cope is
[1:36:14] I just want to make sure I get it right
[1:36:17] amen I want to put this back to you
[1:36:20] well I just passed over it
[1:36:23] I want
[1:36:25] to deal effectively
[1:36:28] with the word
[1:36:30] think about that
[1:36:32] when you deal effectively with the word
[1:36:35] is when you
[1:36:37] do the word
[1:36:42] it is not me dealing with the word it's
[1:36:45] actually the word dealing with me to
[1:36:48] bring the word manifest
[1:36:51] it's never been us
[1:36:53] it will never be us
[1:36:56] it's him
[1:36:58] but we have to do our part
[1:37:01] God called us to worship Him
[1:37:03] God called us to serve him God called us
[1:37:07] to take the word and eat the book
[1:37:10] amen didn't ask you you know to go find
[1:37:12] some spiritual tongues he didn't ask you
[1:37:15] to go find some way to get around this
[1:37:17] he asked you to eat the book Lord help
[1:37:21] us oh we even in the things that are
[1:37:23] hard can we say sometimes it's hard
[1:37:25] Saints amen even when it's hard just
[1:37:29] keep eating the book
[1:37:31] Hallelujah I use that little analogy
[1:37:33] about that Nitric or whatever acid stuff
[1:37:37] that expands your blood vessels supposed
[1:37:39] to help your your blood pressure go down
[1:37:41] and and whatnot that it's just kind of
[1:37:43] this natural thing and and you know and
[1:37:47] it takes time
[1:37:52] got high blood pressure I'm gonna go to
[1:37:53] the doctor here in about 10 minutes I
[1:37:55] think I'll take one of these pills
[1:37:57] I haven't taken one in a month but I
[1:37:59] think I'll take one right now and by the
[1:38:01] time I get to the doctor's office surely
[1:38:02] I'll have good blood pressure
[1:38:04] no my brother and sister eat the book
[1:38:07] every
[1:38:08] single day
[1:38:11] you say but I'm trying to serve the Lord
[1:38:13] and I don't seem to be changing how
[1:38:15] often do you eat the book
[1:38:18] eat the book every single day
[1:38:22] and it will change you I can guarantee
[1:38:25] you'll cope with the word I don't care
[1:38:27] what anybody else says you don't have to
[1:38:30] work up nothing
[1:38:31] bring down nothing pull pump up you're a
[1:38:36] Christian you just automatically bear
[1:38:38] the fruit of the spirit see see and
[1:38:41] that's the way it is amen see Hallelujah
[1:38:45] I'll tell you what my brother and sister
[1:38:47] there's times
[1:38:48] I don't feel very Victorious
[1:38:53] there might even times my voice says I'm
[1:38:56] not Victorious
[1:38:58] but God always brings some form or some

[1:48:52] Heavenly Father
[1:48:54] Lord this simple thought today I pray
[1:48:58] father we just recognize Lord we're here
[1:49:00] to do our part
[1:49:03] Lord to worship
[1:49:05] when this whole flesh
[1:49:07] feels discouraged or tired
[1:49:10] [Music]
[1:49:12] to eat the book
[1:49:15] when it seems so hard
[1:49:19] but probably Lord the hardest part for
[1:49:22] us as humans
[1:49:25] it's just to let go and let you have
[1:49:29] your wonderful way in US
[1:49:32] to let go of our thoughts and our
[1:49:34] emotions and our flesh
[1:49:37] to let go of our intellect
[1:49:41] and just trust your word
[1:49:43] Trust You Lord
[1:49:46] would be my prayer today Lord that as we
[1:49:50] do our part father
[1:49:52] it's not about how smart we are
[1:49:57] how we can
[1:49:58] recognize the definitions of big words
[1:50:03] but it will be the sons and daughters
[1:50:07] that you call the father
[1:50:10] Lord just stepping in
[1:50:12] to their position
[1:50:14] I think about when the prophet saw that
[1:50:18] Vision Lord
[1:50:20] the worldly Church
[1:50:23] going down and out of sight
[1:50:26] that's not who we are Lord
[1:50:28] [Music]
[1:50:29] that's not who we were called to be Lord
[1:50:32] Jesus
[1:50:34] but then the prophetess hearts breaking
[1:50:37] he cries out to you and then he hears
[1:50:40] that anthem
[1:50:42] Onward Christian Soldier
[1:50:45] [Music]
[1:50:48] and he sees a brine
[1:50:52] a bride recognized by her
[1:50:54] even the very country she come from
[1:50:58] [Music]
[1:51:01] our part Lord Jesus
[1:51:05] stay and step with your word
[1:51:09] not to get out of step and offer an
[1:51:12] excuse
[1:51:14] not to get out of Step
[1:51:16] and Justified
[1:51:22] that the work that you called us to Lord
[1:51:24] is to obey a prophet's voice
[1:51:26] [Music]
[1:51:28] for us to give back in step to get back
[1:51:31] in line
[1:51:32] I pray father no matter what the
[1:51:34] circumstances are of the lives that are
[1:51:36] here today or might hear this
[1:51:39] father let's just recognize that's
[1:51:42] our job

[1:51:46] help me Lord
[1:51:48] to stay in step with your word
[1:51:51] help me Lord
[1:51:54] to stay in Step as it were with the
[1:51:57] bride of Christ
[1:52:00] she was the manifestation
[1:52:03] of the word in this hour
[1:52:06] that's the way Lord you chose
[1:52:10] to express it
[1:52:13] now my part Lord
[1:52:16] is just to be obedient to your calling
