on the 9th of september there we go september 2nd uh through to september 5th on the bulletin board brother craig boyer he's going to be the speaker his end time message tabernacle is hosting so if

we have to start again but it just keeps getting better and better and better more precious more powerful amen as the shackles of sin doubt brother trevor i'm telling you there's a time that fear strikes the heart of every man but this fear that we would feel preparation might be another word for it we feel in the flesh is not what's associated with our soul amen reminded me of a time many years ago our kids were little we visited the grand canyon you know how kids are they just go trucking up there and they and i can remember i'm still about 10 feet away and it's like and then when they turn around go dad isn't it beautiful you're like well that's not what our soul should experience our soul should be able to say it's mine morning new night no matter what's happening it's mine amen amen now sister sophie i believe is is it joshua come and visited us okay okay is he related to you somehow distant do you claim him anyway he asked me to uh if we as a church would just remember him in prayer amen had a nice little conversation with him the other day seems like a fine young man just pray he was going to take a a trip i don't know what happens here what the deal is but he said he was going to go to africa because there was some girl that he was attracted to or something and so just desired our prayers amen i just don't know how that goes now i don't know how to word this because i don't want to just blurt it all over the internet but sister tomah's brother brother roman was staying with a brother in germany and the brother in germany contacted him and says i don't feel good so if you were planning to go to the airport tonight to see brother roman don't don't knock you might call because that won't matter but anyway just uh there's there's the possibilities and whatever and so brother vasily called me this afternoon and said please just uh because he knew sister jerry and i was going to drive to the airport tonight to greet him he's like please no one come so anyway we'll just leave that at that okay everybody got the message amen well isn't it good to be in the house of the lord tonight amen somebody said amen amen amen so as we look at this i want to speak to you once again a continuation of what we spoke on thank you musicians i appreciate that so much you know the other day sunday just was thinking about how beautiful it is we have talent we only have two instruments because sister heidi is a wall on the job and um but anyway i remember the days when when we sang a cappella a lot and i thank the lord for the musicians in our midst and the beautiful voices amen i want to speak to you once again tonight on our present circumstances and if i would title this tonight drawing this out uh of the scriptures uh i would i would give a title to it god hath chosen and uh you know isn't it wonderful when we realized that it wasn't us making these decisions we we feel like it was we want to say it was and and it's interesting on one part you got people on the far of the spectrum saying and i and i and i and i and they mean it literally like as though they accomplish something then the other end of this spectrum is is it couldn't possibly be i but we have to find the balance and the prophet of god come laid a balance out for us aren't you glad tonight we can have balance amen we don't have to fall off amen happy to see our brother scott i know he's here the other day but you know just this whole covert thing it's kind of like being out in the world right everywhere you go you're going to rub shoulders with the world but we as believers can just claim deliverance from this protection from this amen you know this might not be as fearful as what daniel experienced in the lion's den and then that brings up a whole deal did daniel experience fear in the lion's den i'm going to say that he did that there is that human element that when a lion roars it would cause us to shake but did you know that sometimes and and i won't go into this tonight it's not our topic but did you know that sometimes god allows us and i would say a lot of times let me put the god allows you to experience first and then faith kicks in we don't walk into the situation i'm untouchable no sir we walk into that we're human we walk into that but when the lion roars when the circumstances come then faith kicks in and we realize i have no other alternative but to trust the lord and that in itself i believe is a great revelation that when you have a multiple we'll be talking about some decisions tonight when you have a multitude of decisions to make to be able to stop and single them out and say my decision is to trust the lord my decision is to believe the word that is a great revelation my brother and sister because we've been given in the world we live in tons and tons of options but the bride of christ always chooses her bridegroom never chooses another she's not looking i'm getting ahead of myself amen let's just go here and look at this now i want to say this this kind of a repeat from last wednesday as we speak on these present conditions we're not going to look at or focus as it were on the condition of the world we have the sideline of the condition of what the world is we see how the scripture and we're seeing how it's manifested and it all it isn't always manifested the same way we thought it would be but god's doing it anyhow amen and then we see and we're not looking at what the nations are doing my brother and sister we're we're seeing how that the nations are being tossed and driven as it were and the winds upon the sea and a nation says we're not and then something happens and they do and so that goes both ways where we're not looking grace tabernacle tonight is not looking at what other churches in the message are doing can't say well they seem spiritual will follow in their footsteps we need to be prayed through saints that we as grace tabernacle not a different vision than the word has but we as grace tabernacle have our vision that we are on track in the mind of god moving forward not always playing follow the leader as it were and we'll also talk about leaders but you look at this my brother and sister that we were called as a sovereign body of believers to find our own entrance into the throne room of almighty god to find our own place that we stand face to face with the revealed word and it coming forth and my brother and sister it is not a time that god says nope nope all of the things that's left in the word must have an interpretation do you realize the interpretation is given because the word is of no private interpretation so the word's already been broke open it's already been broke open and then we as the eagles of the age know what to do with the word that's been revealed to us we don't sit there and look at it you know brother brown talking about the buzzards sitting on the limb looking down you know of what that is waiting for it to get cooked enough on the highway but we as the bride know when the word's been opened to us what to do with it now we're going to preach on that tonight oh my we got a lot to preach on i better get going hallelujah amen but what we as believers are doing in this present age is what we need to focus on that's what's important to us not what they're doing but what are we doing and i say lord let us dig into the word amen let us oh i hope this doesn't sound grotesque to you but let us dig in so deep that when we raise our head back up we have got the blood all over us not dainty eaters not dainty eaters my brother and sister let's dig into the word of god hallelujah hallelujah ephesians the fifth chapter and this is the same scripture we used last wednesday just want to to build upon that a little bit i love this i love ephesians five it's uh it's a wonderful piece of scripture that speaks to the heart let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience in other words replacing the pure word with vanity and vanity in this case would be the preacher singular plural whatever it might be ministry making you feel good about yourself while ignoring the glaring air in other words looking in the mirror of god's word and say don't worry about that go by your emotion do you feel like a christian well let's not answer that because i could tell you some days leave you not even feeling like a christian so the vanity side says oh you know everything's fine-tuned you know and so perfect and oh and this and make you feel good a little chuckle and a little humor and a little something and and half of those people sitting there in that crowd they don't know if they're in or out up or down but when they go there a good motivational speech have you have any of you ever gone to a motivational speech i'm telling you you can see these multi-level marketing deals those guys have mastered that and you walk in they're a skeptic and you walk out saying wow i only had to give them 1200 and i'm gonna be a millionaire six months later they can't even find the literature the wife has thrown it out the kids have scribbled on it and they could care less don't ever mention uh mlm to me ever again and the guy who became a millionaire was the guy who was standing up front but for that moment they all felt like they could conquer they're going to convert everyone at work every one of their relatives everyone in their coldest sac forget the cul-de-sac this whole subdivision but then door after door and rejection and all these issues and they realize that they hate speaking to people and they are not going to spend the rest of their life inviting 20 people at a time to their house for tea and crumpets but yet that spirit invaded the church okay i better get going be not therefore partakers with them for years sometimes darkness but now can someone say now but now are ye light in the lord walk as children of light what an instruction right there just start walking but walk as children of light for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth proving what is acceptable unto the lord and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them isn't it amazing though sometimes in the public realm we and i include myself oftentimes feel compelled to just be silent and the devil comes along and says see you don't have any courage but did you know the atmosphere you put off it's the atmosphere you put off did you know it's the atmosphere you put off is why you can touch the screen of your smartphone and cause it to react to each key it is sensing i don't know the right term so forgive me if i don't have it but it's sensing the energy in you it's it's drawing an energy to you that connects it to that key because how can you have a piece of glass over the key uh the face of your phone and be it like you're dimpling it no it's not it's the energy so you have energy in you and if your energy is there submitted to the lord and these things are happening your energy will then be fighting but it's not you it's the lord that fights the battle it's not us that has to make a statement but it's god in us that is there declaring and pushing back against laodicea thank you lord i love that amen and have no fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret but all things that are reproved sorry about that brother alex but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepless and i say that tonight let's awake church and if we're not on fire for god let's get on fire for god let's let's not be taking a nap as it were but let's be on fire and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time so one of the things of wisdom is redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is and i would just ask a question is it not our hearts desire to do the will of god to know the will of god walk in his will live in that in this world to live in the will of god heavenly father we thank you tonight lord just help us to be concise lord and clear bless the saints i pray today in your name amen you may be seated now i read the definition of circumspect the other day but i just want to um just touch on it again very quickly thinking carefully about possible risks before doing or saying something it is also careful to consider all circumstance and possible consequence to be prudent to be cautious now my brother and sister do think carefully is something that we can do and you know sometimes satan comes and anoints people you know they they have tried for years to place this overall uh title or umbrella over the message calling it a cult and and you know people then when they go to the internet i have dealt with some people before that they're like hey i went and looked up your church and i think you're really fine people but and you know because everything on the internet is true in fact i mean george washington said so so it's there that we look at this that sometimes people become so cautious because they're afraid of the consequence of being tied to something but aren't you glad by the grace of god that we have found a liberty to look into the perfect word of god and it bringing the liberty in fact it has brought so much liberty that we are not looking my brother and sister for a deliverance as it were from a physical body but we as a sons and daughters of god are looking for a deliverance in the spirit realm to our spirit being the spirit of god desires to be united back together again and it's not a uniting that makes us come and give some unwavering support for some kind of a building or a program or a man or a personality as some kind of group but it's there that god is working upon us as individuals now if you can be in a cult and think and act as an individual that's not a very strong cult in fact i've said it before i say it again this is a worse managed cult on the face of the earth they have they're just doing a terrible job about forcing everyone to follow their ideology but when we come into a place and i'm a little ahead of myself but it'll be fine we come to a place that there's another leadership in our life there's something that's stirring us there's something that's drawing and we use the word compel but sometimes the word compel can be used in actually the opposite effect so we'll kind of just waver on the use of the word compel but we'll touch again here in a minute my brother and sister now look at this we're not moved by the fear of being wrong that's right amen we're not moved by the fear of being wrong because the word of god said i will lead you and guide you okay if we have a leader we're in the wilderness or we're in the jungle and we've got a leader that knows where it's going knows where we need to go and knows the best way to get us there and we have full confidence that and he said i will lead you so our job then is not to question that leadership our job is to follow our job is to not get so far away from him that he turns right or left or a crook in the trail and we're there then lost no my brother and sister we've already been redeemed from being lost now what we got to do is follow and i say lord help us to just stay as close as we can to you lord that you would lead us and guide us into all truth and my brother and sister if we can believe there's a rapture and if we can believe that there is a word for our hour then we should be able to believe and stand with full confidence in the fact that god through the leadership of the holy spirit will lead us and guide us to all truth my brother and sister it is a spirit of fear when people come and they're afraid they're afraid well you know there's going to be wolves in sheep's clothing how about you just turn your wolf detector on there's going to be those seducing spirits turn on your seducing spirit detector there's going to be those that twist the word then turn on your twisted word detector amen this is called the holy ghost amen this is not something manufactured by somebody this is something that god didn't even it's not even manufactured in you you know that it was deposited in you amen god didn't come along and say i need a little of this and i need a little of this and i need a little of this god said i have placed in you as a prophet put these words everything you need to make the rapture amen so we don't got to go through life well i need to run over here because they've got a new startling doctrine i need to run over here because they've got a profound statement over here i need to run down here because this person has personality i need to run over here because they're flamboyant no you got to run to the one that said i'll lead you and when you get in that presence you don't have to worry about getting lost in a jungle in a desert in a mountain place or a canyon you don't have to get lo worry about getting lost in the avenues of laodicea he's there hallelujah and we have a spirit that's come upon the message my brother and sister it's a spirit of fear people are afraid well i don't know i don't understand that so instead of we were discussing this the other day instead of putting this on the shelf and saying lord you'll reveal it they just get afraid of it and run that's right and when they run from my brother and sister they never seek the mind of god for the revelation of what that is because you know most of the time what these doctrines are are truth with just a little bit of seed of discrepancy throat in there now imagine some people will throw 99.9 percent truth out because they're afraid of the one-tenth of the discrepancy instead of going into the word and saying lord reveal this to me and when you see the discrepancy it will never move you in the wrong direction ever again in your life you have nothing to be afraid of but people say well well i don't know i'm afraid of this i'm afraid of that they never preached this to me when i was a youngster i've never heard that preached before well my brother and sister i'll tell you how that works i was up in a place one time hold some meetings and i was really tired we traveled and and i'm in a room and i i simply just had no energy and i said lord you know what um i just need you and the lord led me to a scripture we won't go there tonight but the lord led me to a scripture and i'm there on my knees with my head on the bed and and i i just was thinking and it was like open up your bible open my bible the lord led me to a scripture i preached it that night it stirred people's hearts not paul doing it the holy spirit doing that and then the response of some that were there was i looked it up while you were speaking and brother branham never once preached on that scripture okay was it real or not was it true it was scripture there was another paul that wrote it but it wasn't this paul but you see people get so caught up are you with me so caught up it's relevant if they can find it in a sermon in a quote in a word phrase and they'll believe that but if it's the word and it's not there then they are not going to touch it even though it come directly from their bible spirit of fear coming in amen ruled by this spirit of being wrong afraid of being wrong and i understand that we want to be right tonight don't we amen but we have a spirit of liberty and i've got a father who has said i will open my word to you and the mystery of christ will be revealed before his return and so i have no fear because i have a guide who said don't go that way come this way don't do that and will come and take scripture and show you because people say well i don't know i think that scripture might not be right hello no all scripture is given all scripture is given it's our interpretation it's our understanding how we view it so we don't need to pray that the scripture would be added or taken away we need to pray lord give me your mind so i can see what you were saying here amen you see because we don't want to be constrained by the word now the word constrain in the dictionary actually has a very short definition it means forced we don't want to be forced by the word that's not what it's about my brother and sister being forced oh oh oh the bible says i can't lie i guess i have to stop lying that's being constrained that person will not survive the test of time in laodicea sounds judgmental i don't mean it to be but if you're constrained by the word my brother and sister then you were forced into conforming to something and that's oftentimes it sounds a little critical but i'm just going to say it anyhow that's where you see some of these testimonies well i was raised in a message home young people please listen i was raised in a message church in a message home and i was forced never a relationship with the lord never a mention about god stirring their heart god leading them to truth it's i was forced i was forced and soon as i could i was 18 i broke free from that so that i could act like the rest of the world you see not to be constrained by the word or by man i pray never comes across and i say this here again tonight especially to our young people i want you to never think brother paul is trying to force you what i want you to do is volunteer yourself to the lord and say lord open and shine the light on me because the light is what makes all things manifest it's the light that makes it all real my brother and sister we can go you know it's um it i won't go there no that's not good don't go there paul but but you look at this see we're not looking for the forcing in fact the prophet of god said the holy spirit is a gentleman and so the gentleman would never force you now this is a funny but not so funny story this man was raised as a gentleman he spent a lot of years in the military once again they reinforced that behavior and he's walking into a building had a big heavy glass door and as he walks in his wife is with him he opened the door for her to pass through sees this lady coming and he's holding the door and this woman starts in on what i guess you would call a feminist rant and she's like why would you think i need you to hold a door for me and he thought about it a second and just stepped through and let go of the door only while she said one thing she acted on another anyway she got crunked in the head and squeezed between the two big glass doors and then she was angry because you did that on purpose and he says no i was responding to your words that you didn't need me i didn't come as and it's quite profound i didn't come as the man in your life i come as a gentleman in the life of my wife but it didn't stop at my wife broke the heel on her high-heeled shoes that's why sisters y'all not wear them things you'll bust them in the door i could say some more words there but i'll just choke them back down you see compelled is a very similar word denoting a certain degree of force but my brother and sister who we are no matter what the circumstance of our age is who we are is a people that is moved by the presence of almighty god we are a people that are moved by the holy ghost that is not what should move us emotion is present when the holy spirit is moving but emotion should not be the factor that moves us it should be the presence of almighty god just as i spoke to you here a few weeks ago i don't remember exactly when but you can have a day that you don't want to relive a day that everything goes wrong you have a headache your back hurts your this that and the other and you go and somehow you walk in the doors of the church and you sit down and your thought is i should have stayed home until the presence of almighty god moves around you and suddenly you have a revival going on suddenly that spirit that was tormenting you all day over something you said or did or somebody said and did to you is suddenly gone why because we've come into the presence of almighty god and he is a prince of peace and we know that presence when it comes and settles upon us we can honestly without a single person people say well i just noticed not church these are real words of critics i just notice in that church it's when the song leader or the preacher says do you feel the presence everybody's like they're just puppets well i'll tell you what it is can i be real tonight what it is is we're sitting there the presence of god is working on us working on us and what went wrong today this broke and that broke and this didn't work and this problem and the children are misbehaving got a smile out of them but we walk in here and the presence of god starts to wash and scrub and maybe the minister or the song leader does say do you feel the presence of the lord let's worship him but all that is is a catalyst like a key that causes us to just go ahead and break that last bit of bondage and lift our hands but you see people that have never been there don't know all they can do is take that back and place it in a carnal realm and say this is what i've experienced you know like at a ball game not that i go to them haven't been to one or watched one or done much but you know the ball game they look out in the stands and all the fans you know well what do they do that let's do a wave all of a sudden an announcer is like let's do a wave you've got 25 000 people that are watching their favorite team be beat up but they still got something in them yes a wave and they jump up yes knock over their popcorn their hot dog and everything else that they're doing trip and fall over the seat backwards but i wasn't that so nice but the holy ghost comes give it liberty we don't have to say let's have a wave you know that might be something we ought to introduce let's start right over here and right after we get up from the altar we'll give a wave oh forgive me my terrible humor but you see what happened people don't they don't understand because they're used to being constrained they're used to being kind of led into this but you see the redeemed come to a place that the word is alive to them and something starts bubbling up inside of them maybe it is the preaching of the word that's doing it but that's irrelevant because they're recognizing christ is here the holy ghost is moving in our myth and he wants to be manifested in me and i want him to be manifested in me and i'm gonna i'm gonna react to that moving of the holy spirit and so we start to come because you see my brother and sister we have a present circumstance can you say amen to that and it's either going to be we're in the circumstance of laodicea or in the circumstance of a revealed word that has come in our hour and we're going to choose what circumstance becomes our guiding light becomes our our governing force amen so you look at this my brother and sister it's a dynamic the leadership of the holy spirit moving in our midst is a dynamic the world can understand in fact it's a dynamic that many people with the title of christian don't understand they get excited we had a visitor one time i was always sad she never came back she said i will see you in a couple weeks she drove truck for a living i'll see you in a couple weeks she said i so enjoyed the sermon today it touched my heart i just been reading a scripture and she said and one of the best things about this church and this atmosphere here is the lights were on and i was in a mushroom growing in the dark but why is that spirit my brother and sister what spirit likes darkness what moves in the darkness now the holy ghost can move anywhere anytime any place but we're looking at the overall picture what is the spirit that likes darkness and what does the word testify of and that's where all of our churches are going darkness light strobes and all of this kind of stuff i i clicked on a deal the other day i just thought well i want to see where where this church is going well i didn't have to look very far to figure out where they're going my brother and sister i didn't know if it was church or a rock concert that's how far they've gone that's right here in this valley amen now look did you know that all christians are followers now we live in a world that everybody's saying i want my own identity now pardon me i don't mean to make fun of this but it's a good example they're wearing their shirt untucked with a t-shirt underneath and kind of a flannel shirt with either the sleeves cut off or rolled up and their belt now this is a miracle they they must have you know kind of like oh i shouldn't even say that anyway but they must have some kind of inner hidden suspenders because their belt is wrapped right here and i just watched the other day i stopped and got gas and the the deal that wouldn't work right i had to go inside the store and i got quite an eye opening in there and uh here's a man big burly muscular guy and and he stand there at the counter nice he nodded his head smiled at me i was a lot better than a big guy growling at you and um anyway so he gathers up he had some i don't remember soda pop and some different stuff and some chips and he gathers that out and he goes over and he makes it as far as the door and he has to stop and go and then he went out and his pickup was parked down the parking lot and as he starts that direction he keeps having to stop and do that and then he drops one of the bottles and finally he's just holding this real precariously and just holds his pants up and just walks over there to his pickup i wish i'd had a video of that and i would have loved to have shown it to him in a moment of sanity a grown man my brother and sister so the spirit of the day see is anointing people to come in a condition that a grown man i say growing up i'm talking chronological age uh it would come and present himself in public like that now i want to take this a step further that we have those kind of spirits invading the church people are coming into the house of god no i would never wear pants cinched around my bottom with my bloomers showing i would never do this no what they will do is come into the church in flip-flops beach shorts a tank top with their little i wish that was in maui sunglasses and they believe they're honoring the house of god do you realize that man with his underwear showing dragging his pants along on the floor has just as much respect in the eyes of god as a man with million dollars coming to church and flip-flopping shorts see how darkness come in it just come in a different avenue the shadow is long over here it's short and dark over here and people say well i've got a little light my revelation well my brother and sister we're not looking for a little light we are looking for the light we are looking for the life that goes with the light hallelujah amen no christians are followers now you can look in your bible make a reference jesus repeatedly said follow me follow me follow me kind of paraphrasing it because the words are a little bit different but the apostle paul said follow me as i follow christ i think as the niv says imitate me as i imitate christ and people would say whoa that don't sound right but you got to get to the context they didn't really miss it that far whatever i'm doing in christ you do in christ if i put him as preeminent you put him as preeminent if i worship him you worship him if i ask him for healing you ask for healing it's not that far off to say the imitate part right but we're not talking about just being imitators we're talking about being real we're talking about having the substance of jesus christ amen so it's there jesus said follow me will we follow this advice we have a choice my brother and sister we have a choice in in the day in our present circumstance we live in the darkest age that was ever on the face of the earth my brother and sister and it's here that we have the option to follow to the minute degree of jesus advice follow me follow me follow me amen now some people would say well we believe that the bible is just an encouragement well to my heart it was a command it wasn't an option it wasn't uh you know maybe this will encourage you follow jesus in my heart i'm not going to speak for your heart you have to speak through your heart in my heart it was a command follow me and my heart responded oh you know what it is i mean i didn't give my heart back to the lord as a teenager i wasted a lot of years that if i could redeem that time i would pay the price to redeem that again but i can't but you look at that and i look at those things and i say oh lord that if i would have just followed you if i would have just followed you if i would have listened to my heart instead of man's words if i would listen to my heart instead of my peers if i'd listen to my heart instead of my worldly friends well paul you're a special case i'm sure i am sometimes they put the word basket in front of case but what i know is i won't trade what i've got for what they've got first corinthians 11 says be followers of me even as i also am of christ so as paul is speaking to the corinthians he's he's encouraging them you know in the day and age we live in people would be like now just another preacher i ain't going to follow a preacher i don't need a preacher some voices in the land say the preachers are the problem well there are some preachers that are a problem but my bible says that he would send these men for the perfecting of the saints of the body so if god said that they were part of a perfecting i'm not going to look at the false ones over here i'm going to look for the real i'm going to look for the one that has something of intrinsic value to offer to me that is not expecting to be lifted up and just shouted to the heavens of what a wonderful man they are and glorious they are and we ought to give them this and that and buy them a jet airplane no you look for the one that has a compelling uh uh uh not a compelling i i i was not wanting to use that word but okay you understand where i'm coming from one that is compelled in a way it is forced man i tell you what i've seen a lot of people brother branham summed it up this way the ones that want to be the preacher are not called and the ones that don't want to be or call so there is a compelling there is a compelling on that but the apostle paul would be so bold in this day i don't know if people could deal with him he would be out here telling them just follow me because i'm following christ you just go ahead and just follow me and people would be like oh cult cult cult cult huh except for those that have true understanding would look and say you know what i see christ in that man and it don't have to be the preacher okay let's just move beyond that i see christ in that sister i see christ in that man what is it you're seeing the evidence of the word that said he would be manifest in this day he would have been manifest in this multi-member body that he calls his bride it would be manifest in them it wouldn't be a cloak that covered them but it would be a life inside of them amen now let's look here in ii peter the first chapter once again going forth as followers ii peter 1 for we have not followed cunningly devised fables a man could sit down this will sound harsh but you want a cunning devised fable how many of you have read the book of mormon in so many portions it parallels the bible but you see the word says if you add one word or you take one word away so they write a parallel book and then they say it's just as divinely anointed and ordained as the bible is and there's like 17 million people on the face of the earth that agree with them because there's 17 million people it must be true no it's cunningly devised and i'm not faulting them i have many many members of our extended family that's in that and they're good people but i haven't found the scripture said that because we were good we were going to make it that's right when we made known unto you the power and the coming of our lord jesus christ but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty now my brother and sister this is a point that i really want to drive home but quickly it's not that my mama told me daddy told me i heard somebody this preacher that's my favorite internet preacher he said but this is a word of god that is declaring to you what is valid is the eyewitness amen you know as that song goes how's that brother jason i don't know i was there or something yes i was there when jesus saved me see not not somebody telling you you're now saved but being there when he saved you now the devil will bring confusion right remember the young man that was searching for the holy ghost went here went there when what comes to the prophet of god brother branham just turns him right back and says when you were first introduced to the gospel you know what happened right there and he tells him something inside of me and i cried out to the lord and brother brown says that's when you received the holy ghost he made this huge circle the devil kept brushing him off but you see it's there we should know the experience that we have and here again i'm sorry young people not to pick on you but our experience shouldn't be i was at camp and all the kids did it and so i guess i've got it too our experience should be i met god if the whole camp didn't meet god i met god it was a personal experience to me and it changed my life no i've never went out and never danced and i've never this and i've never done that none of these things but i was prone to take a cookie and lie about it i was prone to say it wasn't my fault they did it i was prone to all these little things like that but something happened something changed me hallelujah amen oh i'm lost i don't even know where i'm at for he received from god the father honor and glory when there comes such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased and this voice which come from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount i'm telling you that is resurrected and brought to life right here in this day when we are with him in that holy presence amen you're going to hear god speaking and it's not going to be a voice that says well the lord told me to do this and a year 2 10 later nope i'm doing this over there i would like to corner some of these people and take them back in remembrance to the day when they said the lord spoke to me and told me to do this now god's either a liar or you are and i'm not going to vote for you i mean i'm not going to vote against god you get this amen so you see what's happening this voice i'm just going to kind of preach these scriptures not read all of it but you see it's this voice that we have and it's got to be the original voice it can't be something that's been watered down and it isn't a voice that has to come through 10 people to get to you it's not even a voice that has to come through the preacher to get to you and so it's there my brother and sister and the voice came from heaven when we were with him in the holy mountain we have also a more sure word of prophecy i'll touch on that in a minute if i can just get to it where until you do well that you take heed as unto light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day start arise in your heart and my brother and sister and maybe i sound a little strident tonight i don't mean to but the problem is we got way too many people who have never seen the day star they have never seen that they are following a message because their family did or it just seemed right it was better than any church they ever experienced but that isn't the answer you've got to see the day star you've got to meet him face to face and you're gonna trust him enough that you would let him lead you out of your present circumstance hallelujah amen knowing this first that no prophecy of the scriptures of any private interpretation for prophecy come not in old time by the will of man but holy man of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost now i want to just throw something out there just i'm just going to do it i'm not going to justify myself we see these spirits going around the land that are justifying well marriage and divorce when brother branham preached it many people didn't understand and i'll say amen to that because brother branham himself told people they didn't understand it but it's there my brother and sister they come now and say but we have an interpretation we have people who were at the prophet we've been this and we've been that and we've studied that we've analyzed the very words that brother branham said in this paragraph and and brought it back through and it's a revelation it is but the prophet of god said it needs to be a sure word and he said and if you want to know what it means you take it back to the written word of god not to an interpretation of a man here or a man there but take it back to the written word of god and that word is not up for interpretation amen i'm sorry do i sound strident tonight okay i'll maybe make fun of brother andrew but my ear mic is just a little messed up my left ear is kind of plugged for the prophecy come not in old time by the will of man my brother and sister 65 years ago is a long time 70 years ago it's a long time that was not the will of a man that was not the will of a man amen that was god coming and taking his own understanding and him declaring this that i understood in a certain way god come and corrected me that's not the understanding of a man because you know what it does it makes a man look like he doesn't know what he's talking about when he's got recorded words saying this means this and come back later and say i was wrong that means this but when you're letting god then you don't care you're able to just move on and say this is what the lord showed me now to be circumspectly verse 15 of our original scripture see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wives now let's look at this did you know that research shows that humans make how many decisions a day at least one and some days that decision should be i should have just pulled the pillow over my head stayed right where i was at 35 more than 35 000 decisions a day now in that they are counting the decisions your body makes in motor skill right how many of us well if you ever see me sometimes i've fallen off of the steps of this platform but my body just made decisions right the whole coordination of this but 30 more than 35 000 decisions a day so the reason i bring that up is because you see that we are influenced by incredibly amount an incredible amount of outside influence is brought to bear upon us and so it's there and and i don't want to belabor this too long but i want to ask you what's your influencer right exactly what is your influencer there's influence into the decisions you make every single day what is the influencer who is the influencer you see we even get to make a decision of who or what is going to be our influencer uh you know on the on all the social media those of you that are adept at that kind of stuff they have a status now that they've raised up that they give to people that have a certain amount of followings or or comments or i don't know what that is and now they've given them the title of influencers well i'll tell you what i come across the deal the other day and i'm embarrassed to admit it but it maybe the lord led it for a reason and so you just like okay who are these influencers and i'm scrolling through that and i'm thinking i wouldn't want any one of these people to influence me until i come to one he was a farmer but i don't know what kind of man he is he might be a blasphemer i have no idea so do i decide because he's a farmer i have a i have something in common with him brother trevor do i do i just then accept his influence no sir this is when the prophet was talking about giving it the word test not the one where people went when i was a kid oh i tell you what talk about being embarrassed gabriella when i was about your age you know there was such a spirit was on the church that was over there in greenleaf that they would be in the grocery store and they had to ask somebody god sent a prophet you believe that and they'd go i don't know nothing about it you're satan's seed i was like i don't think i'm hanging out with these people any longer because even without the holy ghost in my life at that age i knew that wasn't the right way to do it and i'm telling you even to this day the message has a black mark among some old families in that area and you know why because just virtually every one of them was told that they were satan's seed you know what's even worse the people who told them that don't even serve the lord today see how those spirits can be you know what that is that's a proud spirit that's a selfish spirit so what is happening is we're coming into a day that god said i'm going to come down i'm going to live in you and then i'm going to let my life and you be what's manifested and when that is manifested you won't have to tell your neighbor at all you're a christian they're going to say this person's different there's something here and you won't need to go through the neighborhood telling them all going to hell unless they believe you yeah tough picture isn't it who's the influencer what is the influencer that's right you see i'm going to put this and i believe you'll understand what i'm saying if someone is not walking in heavenly places then please do not let them become an influencer in your life you say well i don't know brother paul not all these people you know financial advisor he might not be a christian but he knows investment that's right but just keep searching and praying and you'll find one that's got the holy ghost and does financial advising then you can trust that man hmm y'all quiet tonight well just hold on while i restring my weed eater here see if they're not walking in heavenly places how can they ever give you advice that have never been there themselves you cannot count upon the advice of someone that would talk about how good and how glorious and what this means and whatever if they've never been there themselves i remember one time taking a tour of a submarine vancouver british columbia and the river there i believe that was a russian submarine like from the end of world war ii korea era i think maybe korea era and i remember we took this my brother-in-law took me for a tour through this boat and uh i was just amazed that you know they didn't waste anything on polishing they didn't waste anything on making somebody feel comfortable you didn't find a recliner you didn't find a feather mattress you found bunks that were about that far apart and only about five feet long you found a deal where they had to feed the people in a series because the dining room was just this little single table that was there and they put the food under the deal and you didn't ask the cook or tell the cook i want another piece of fried chicken you ate what they served you and there was a man in the boat there and he was going on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on about this and i thought man you're annoying we're we're on a you know a tour through this boat you're just annoying why don't you shut up and there was a man in front of him three or four people in front of me and he he finally just stomps it might have helped that he was a great big guy but he stops he turns around he looks at this man and he says i take it that you must have served on one of these submarines the guy's like no but i read a book my brother and sister there's only one book only one book that would give you the kind of experience that you could boast about but the real experience god wants us to have is the experience by experience the experience by experience is the one that the devil cannot take away from you that is the one that when your children see the experience by experience that they won't be looking at it they can see mama and daddy oh maybe i'm getting on the wrong turf here but they can see mommy and daddy fuss at each other a little bit and know that they still have christians for parents when they can come to a place that everything around them seems like there's this great degree of hypocrisy because everybody's being buffeted but they can look at that and realize i'm in laodicea and the devil's doing everything he can to disrupt lives and destroy and come in the midst of the church and cause chaos but what i do see is they are not shifted as though they are unsifting sand but they are standing solid even in the struggle they have of the day they're still standing they still get up in the morning and they still want god to lead them they get up in the afternoon as it were and they still are saying thank you lord for blessing this day and they come to the evening time and they're able to say lord you were with us today and we thank you once again and they come and what does that do it helps stabilize that young person when they realize i don't have to act like some perfect little statue i don't have to be that i can live i can live and my god understands and i'm come in my heart and say lord forgive me of my shortcomings today and the voice of god will come down in your heart and soul and say i understood your circumstance i lived it that's it i lift it i understand and he comes and gives us then more strength for the day oh hallelujah now look my brother and sister there's enough carnal advisors out here you don't even have to look for them they'll volunteer what we're looking for is something like out of first corinthians here for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness talk about a word test is this foolishness to you i don't need advice from you if this is foolishness to you because where i'm going you've never been so you can't possibly give me advice about what to do to get there that's the problem the scripture says the blind leading the blind scripture also says they stand in the door won't go in themselves and won't let anyone else go oh what we want is an open door an open door i believe when when esther was wanting to go see the king there were those that would have stood in the door for her but they didn't know how to defy the queen and not face the consequence and so they had to let her go but they wanted to they wanted to hinder they wanted you to believe that you don't need true repentance this might be a little deep young people but i want you to catch this they want you to believe that you have two souls they want you to believe that you are not going to have to get on fire for god until the prophet comes back they also want you to submit your access to the throne and give it to them and they'll go to the throne for you not recognizing that's nothing more than a laodicean catholic spirit never forfeit what god has given you stand on that yes my brother and sister i have two souls get you all shook here oh no our pastor believes in two souls i have the one that was unconverted and it died and i have one now you've got to go with me figurative okay because that's not the dynamic but i got one that was cast down as it were it was lost it was filled with darkness it was covered with black all over and i've got another one that stands today before the throne of almighty god that's been washed by the water of the word amen i'm not packing two souls with me when the devil rares his head up the whole unction of the holy ghost is right behind that to say you need to correct that paul you need to stop paul you need to repent of over that can you say amen amen so that but see how these spirits are they come in they want to present this in such a way but the the preaching of the cross to them that perish foolishness but unto us is there any us here but unto us which are saved it is the power of god for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world my brother and sister and that's why we got way too many scholars in the message they've got it all figured out in an intellectual realm for after that the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching right you know when uh some many times after i preach i have to come read this because that reminds me okay this is the way god wanted it i sure feel foolish i'm not trying to boo-hoo might have sounded like it but i didn't mean it honest please believe me i meant that jews require a sign the greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ we've got no other message my brother and sister we preach christ amen christ crucified and used a stumbling block in the greek's foolishness but unto them which are called see how beautiful this is to them that are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god because the foolishness of god is wiser than man and the weakness of god is stronger than man for you see your calling can someone say i see my calling for you see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh and not many mighty men not many noble are called wow how incredible it is to be called now if i could put this in this kind of a type then that there had to be someone that had a knowledge of who to call most of us you know have some kind of contact whether it's at the house whether it's with stuff you know a case of emergency called great and ethel and a phone number they know who to call god come along and through the opening of the book now i want to only say this figurative no doctrine please don't misunderstand me but you see my brother and sister in that book figuratively here i'll put it to you in the front of that book that had all the names the lamb's book of life there was a little note up front when the lamb slain call these do you follow me the lamb is slain it ain't going to be a cell phone in your pocket it was something down inside started buzzing something that caught your attention and while i come back and double back on the words that i spoke it started to compel you but not in the force that goes with the english definition of the word compel there was something the deep don't you love how the prophet laid that out so simple the deep the really deep calling into the deep and that changed us because that calling we couldn't do away with can i have just a couple more minutes rush along here amen so you look at this what has happened verse 26 see not many noble are called but god and this is my title but god has chosen see it didn't just happen saints it didn't just stumble upon this god chose the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and the base things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen oh i hope you're catching this tonight and things which are not to bring to not those things that are what was it god chose those things they didn't just come about god chose them just as he chose you and i to be in the lamb's book of life to receive the seed of life now my brother and sister it's there this gets real tricky because it's in the verbiage but you see every man is born with a soul that soul comes in that baby everyone has a soul and so some would say well i got saved at this point of time but it kind of defies the what the scripture says that he chose you before the foundation of the world but i want you to understand my brother and sister it takes a activation of the holy ghost to bring to life in you the seed if that seed can be there some people say they don't have a seed they don't have a seed they have a seed but it never was dermatized but god placed in you the life that could be dermatized and then he chose to dermatize it oh thank you lord amen thank you lord hallelujah so you look at this the things god's chosen the foolish things and god had chosen weak things look at this i'm a fool my brother and sister i just say you know i make so many decisions that are just i look back on them i think that was ridiculous why did i make that decision the wife agrees on the ridiculous part and i look at that oh why what why did i do that but at the moment i was under anointing and often times it's anointing of the carnal let's look for something to blame on somebody i love dirt bikes i want one really bad i'm an old man i'm gonna have to put training wheels on it i don't know but brother trevor buys one and it just makes it worse brother titus rides one and i hear him describe how much fun it was it takes me back to his age gideon he goes out crash and burn everywhere wide open just go let's do this titus technical and i look at every one of those and say yes oh i forgot brother adam he's like yeah gideon went down the trail titus went down the trail i never caught up with him i kept crashing i know those days too but but but i can't follow this brother i can't follow that brother i can't follow that brother i've got to follow what the holy spirit leads me and how many times i'm making a point here i hope you catch this how many times i followed the flesh and never followed the leadership of the holy spirit and you know what praise the lord i'm here i look good don't i well i didn't mean it that way don't even answer but you know what brought me here it wasn't paul wasn't paul i had to follow leadership i had to look at this and say you know what the lord has chosen foolish things and i'm one of those that's amongst the foolish things and weak i'm so weak saints it scares me i think oh how to be a mighty christian by now but do you understand god chose us to be weak so that he could prove how mighty he is because when we are strong we can do it ourselves and can someone say amen so god wants us to be weak so that we have to cling to him that we have to trust him and we come in our own eyes as foolish that we won't even trust ourself any longer and we have to say lord i need you to show me i need you to lead me i need you to guide me because i'm foolish and then what he did he says okay now that i've placed you in that position i'm going to take those things which are despised things which are not to bring to not the things that are oh if i can just refer back real quick here all those ladies imagine in the in the in the i don't know what you call that i can't remember my brain scramble all those young ladies want to be king and i can see them in there saints maybe i'll over dramatize this but i can see him i've got notice i go to the king tomorrow down to the salon they're in the chair and they're rocked out it's all right brother they're rocked back in the chair you know some of you ladies know what i'm talking about and they're washing the hair and they're curling it and they're putting on their eyebrows they got their hands up there they're like you know i don't know if he likes long nails or not but i like them so give me some that look like eagle's claws don't forget my toes but don't make them nails so long i've heard this on good advice don't make them so long because they'll cut your nylons your stockings but i want enough i want enough there that they'll notice and i was looking at the latest issue of vogue for believers and you know we can't scoop out our dresses because that goes against what we believe so no problem just prop the dress up right there and i'll leap off the balcony into it and then when they're invited into the temple they're up there they think they look really good but really the truth is all they're trying to do is stay on their feet because they're wearing these ridiculous ridiculous shoes that the king's doctor told them will break the bones in your feet and make you crippled in your old age but they were like all i got to do is impress the king and then they're back because you guys realize oh i hope you catch this spiritual you realize when they cycled through the presence of the king and they weren't chosen they come back into a position they're not oh catch this they're not happy in the king's house and they're not happy in the world and they literally spend the rest of their life miserable and that's where esther she said you know what i think now mr chamberlain what is the king like well believe it or not he's very conservative no one else asked no one else cared but she did if he was my king my husband what would he want well there was a little advice you know this man had been in the message i mean he'd been in the king's house long time he's very conservative i know he likes white and i know he likes this and he loves hair like yours long and beautiful you see esther didn't go in there saying i've got this figured out i've got this covered you just wait and see all dazzling she went in there with a meek and a contrite spirit and what happened it was the base things of the world which was despised imagine you're the only girl going to go see the king who's not gussied up in the fashion of the day i imagine they mocked her a little bit until they woke up one day and they were like i sure hope she don't remember that i sure hope that she won't but that's all right because you see the bride is going to be there she's not going to have vengeance on her mind she's going to have and she's going to have grace and mercy but she's not going to be emotional about it and i got sidetracked there amen god hath chosen now uh first peter 1 18 just to 25 readed his homework it's actually beautiful scripture amen the precious blood of christ as of the lamb without blemish without spot now i want to just come here and i want to very quickly close this out and standing in the gap if uh um let's see go like that let me go like that is this okay just one more quote my look at all the stuff i skipped over amen now look at this now above this you're gonna find that brother branham is talking about um uh uh the prophecy that was spoken uh and and it was there my brother and sister that you see danny henry i was anointed uh of god speaks out and here is victor ledoux and this in the previous paragraph right there and he was a a a full-blooded frenchman and he speaks this now as he's speaking these words uh he's making this declaration now realize my brother and sister there's a lot of prophecy concerning you and i there's a lot of prophecy in the word that we don't even recognize this prophecy but it is prophecy we see isaiah is clear full of it amen ezekiel is clear full of it ecclesiastes it gives so many references that we look at and it you can read it as simple scripture but with the enlightening don't try and manufacture but with enlightening of the revelation of the holy ghost you'll look in that word and realize that we're talking about you and i in this day where we are standing right now and people are like well we we don't believe in all this stuff well okay but god spoke the same thing through a prophet in this day that he spoke through those prophets in that day and tied them together wove that together perfectly okay so as we look at this these words now if i could just do these are words that were spoken over brother brown and brother brahms sharing these but these words these very words can be yes sir or are words for us words to attain to words to live for and he says now here is what it said speaking of the prophecy the voice because thou has chosen the narrow path it's decision time saints decision time or what path are we going to choose big wide whatever comfortable you know the bigger the road the bigger the gutters and the more trash there is to be found because thou has chosen the narrow path the harder way i'm trying brother alex to only read one message book at a time but i just read the other day where the prophet of god i would call it prophecy said the churches will make it easier and easier no wonder they don't like us no wonder they don't like us no shortcuts around here you don't get free biscuits and gravy just because you come yeah so look at this a narrow path a harder way that has walked in your own choosing no compelling no forcing come on saints i believe that these words that were prophesied over the prophet and interpreted weren't just for the prophet all that was in christ was born to the church and all was in the church was poured into you and i amen so this was not just strictly a word for the prophet that's what i believe i'm sorry if i'm wrong correct me but it's there so what is this it's coming down a narrow path a hard way that we chose wait i'm sorry i'm not strong enough i'm foolish i'm weak i can't choose that so what happened my choosing was god working in this coming around in such a fashion that a craving a craving as it were if you'll just bear with me on this thought a craving that must be satisfied a longing that must be fulfilled and it was not god strong-arming us it was not god dragging us to an altar by our ear it was god allowing us to sit in our pew to sit in our easy chair and say lord this is what i want i want to serve you lord i want to be closer to you i want to live this life lord give me the strength give me the courage lord give me the desire to live this life and we would sit there and say well i no we can't say i did that yes we made the the the effort you might say we pick up our bible we pray we study but it was christ in us there is our hope in glory and is not in our self it is christ in us that is our hope in glory if you don't mind me changing those words hallelujah amen now i can see that moses had to make his choice too see thou has picked the precise and correct way amen precise i'm going to go over here and if that don't fit me i'm going to go over here and if that don't work i'll come back here and if it won't i'll just go start my own church i see it happen i see it happen you've thou hast come on i want you to take this like god was speaking to you tonight now has picked the precise and correct way correct decision and it is my way amen underlined my way these brother brahms words here underline my way the holy spirit speaking back there was an emphasis there oh if god could come down in our midst tonight my brother and sister god would be making an emphasis to you you are choosing the right way you are living the right life don't stop don't get distracted don't peel to the right or left just keep going in the precise way not sloppy christians but in precision because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven awaits you awaits thee what a glorious decision now listen close what a glorious decision thou hast made and i want to emphasize it tonight if i could if you could just receive that from my lips tonight that you have made a glorious decision and god has vindicated it to you god has made it real that this is the life you were called for this was what you were manufactured for hallelujah right you're gloriously and wondrously made amen this is what god put you together for was to be the one to stand here as a vessel of honor washed by the water of the word and he said that's good i've got you washed i've got you steadied and now i'm going to fill you up oh hallelujah and then we get all nervous oh god's asking me to pour out and i don't know no let him let him he's got more to pour in he's got more to pour in if he asks you to pour out you've got more he's got more to pour in you oh what a glorious decision what a glorious decision that has made this in itself is that which will make and come to pass the tremendous victory in the message of our opinion that's what i told you god never fails jay that song right there speaking of love speaking of the divine amen see what it is not a victory and i've memorized the doctrine it's not a victory and we can hold tighter reign on the people than any other church it's not what we have done it's what he has done in us all saints i don't know if that made sense i skipped over some stuff there i actually thought i could get that preached and if i could just stay in the middle of the road i could but look at this the lord has chosen you know what he chose he chose you to come make bring to pass a tremendous victory tremendous victory amen this bride is not a defeated bride she's not a bride that is going to just make it in by the skin of her teeth sister ruth as you would come i've got to stop otherwise i'll be going back and preaching what i skipped over because it all ties together so beautifully hopefully i didn't butcher it up too bad for you tonight saints but i'm telling you there's so much that ties in here it is so beautiful because you look at that what is our present circumstance well brother paul you know a brother asked me here recently asked me a question and he said how's farming brother paul and i said well it's good no really tell me the truth well you want to hear a bunch of negative stuff or what no tell me the truth how's farming he was baiting me saints if i told you who this brother was you'd all go yep i can see it he was baiting me he's like come on say it paul say it paul i'm like i ain't saying a word come on paul say it take it and make it positive say it and i was like yeah when he asked me what farming was really like there's not one drop of that was positive and he was trying to get me to look into my circumstance and find come on saints find the positive anyway where am i my circumstance we got a crazy man for a president and a crazy woman following him around muddying to herself we got politicians all over the earth fulfilling prophecy that said that they would be in utmost confusion yeah we're talking about a government that's so confused that they said if we have more inflation that will help pay off the debt hmm okay we've got we've got everything that you can think of going wrong wars and rumors of wars we've got the earth shaking the sea is rolling roaring how is your day how is your day saints my present circumstance i've got a god that created me in his image i've got blood that covers every fault and failure i've got i've got grace complete and not only that i've got revelation and i've got the love of almighty god that's leading his dear children along how about our day amen what is our day life what do we have to fear my brother and sister scripture asks us that question what do we have to fear i've got a god and he's come along and said this decision that you've made right isn't that what it says what a glorious decision thou has made it's that decision that we were influenced by the holy ghost to make that's bringing us into position we're the most blessed people on earth okay i gotta stop i gotta stop hallelujah oh yeah just one more quote oh my i'm sorry that's bad humor amen let's just stand sing a song or two no i'm serious i i just have i have stuff i never even gave to brother alex i was afraid to i'd be tempted to to do that but saints if we dig in the word yeah we're digging the word you know can i just draw one last conclusion for you my cartoon [Music]

a pick starts digging the tunnel and he starts digging and they depict him has sweat coming from him and he's digging and he's digging and he's digging and now he's creating another mountain behind

into the mountain you know this is small it'd be like the next day digs a little less the next day a little less the next day a little less and in one week he's there and it shows him swinging the pick [Music] and the pick stays right there and he walks out [Music] and at the tip of the pick they represented this great big chunk of gold [Music] sister sue [Music] you've worded it right we have
