[37:14] see hallelujah it's good to be here this
[37:20] morning Saints god bless you each and
[37:22] every one those here in the building
[37:24] with us and those that are listening you
[37:27] know it's just a wonderful time when we
[37:30] realize what's happening in the world
[37:32] around us we can get all concerned about
[37:35] what is happening and we don't take
[37:37] these things lightly right we're not to
[37:39] tempt the Lord but you know I I'm just a
[37:42] last couple days here I just had a you
[37:47] might say a little health event you know
[37:49] and just woke up in the middle of the
[37:51] night with the chills and turns out I
[37:55] had a bit of a fever didn't feel good
[37:58] through that day and next day felt
[38:00] better and feeling just fine today and
[38:03] sister Geri and I was driving to church
[38:05] this morning and we was just discussing
[38:07] these things you know it's like how it
[38:10] would come upon you you know they say
[38:11] these virus starts with a little fever
[38:14] and this that and the other and how
[38:16] Satan you know he would just give you
[38:18] something and just expect you to to
[38:20] accept it but you know hit a little fun
[38:24] I was kind of preaching to sister Geri
[38:25] as we're driving to church this morning
[38:27] and I said look what this is now
[38:29] whatever little virus or bug comes upon
[38:31] you the body then fights against that
[38:35] and our body was designed to overcome
[38:39] the influence of whatever that bug was
[38:42] that was doing that God made us that way
[38:44] and and the thought struck me and I said
[38:47] and you know speaking to her I said you
[38:49] know this is what God designed also we
[38:52] were ordained I used that word our body
[38:54] was ordained to overcome these these
[38:56] viruses and these things and that's the
[38:59] body of believers that's the son or
[39:01] daughter of God
[39:02] this Satan would pour out these things
[39:04] and the Bride of Christ is ordained to
[39:07] overcome it now you know it might not
[39:09] hurt us if we'd have a spiritual fever
[39:11] in other words
[39:12] get hot on fire for God let our let our
[39:16] fever rise up and just say you know what
[39:18] I'm overcoming this whatever it might be
[39:19] I'm going to overcome this because I was
[39:22] ordained to do that amen and you know I
[39:25] just lovely time to serve the Lord
[39:29] because as we see everything upon us you
[39:31] know we can cry we can cry we can cry
[39:34] but some time or another the prophet of
[39:37] God preached that why cry speak and we
[39:40] just want to speak the word I just want
[39:42] to encourage everyone to just kind of
[39:45] watch the website for some you know
[39:50] announcements that were proud becoming
[39:52] the state is adjusting its guidelines
[39:55] and we will be talking to the brothers
[39:57] deciding how that we will be able to
[40:01] comply with the state's wishes and still
[40:05] come together and worship they're saying
[40:07] that on May 1st which would be next
[40:09] Sunday that the churches could reopen
[40:12] but they want the guidelines that they
[40:15] have put in place to be maintained so we
[40:17] will we will put forth some guidelines
[40:23] of our own some direction in this coming
[40:26] week if we would just stand this morning
[40:29] I'd like to turn to the word I want to
[40:31] speak to you once again here this
[40:33] morning redemptions manifestation part 2
[40:37] he is here Amen I didn't bother to count
[40:41] it but if you go into the message you
[40:44] will find that the prophet of God used
[40:46] the words now not talking about an
[40:48] individual because there are quotes
[40:49] where brother Bram says now brother
[40:51] so-and-so or whatever he is here but
[40:54] we're talking about those that he's
[40:56] talking about the Lord Jesus and over
[40:59] and over and over again
[41:00] he speaks those words he is here amen
[41:05] and we believe that today so we just
[41:07] want to go into John the fifth chapter
[41:10] and just read these scriptures down to
[41:14] first through eighth verse amen
[41:18] what a lovely time praise the Lord got
[41:21] things I'd like to share with you but
[41:23] we'll just wait a few days a week or
[41:26] - maybe we'll share those things with
[41:28] you amen after this there was a feast of
[41:32] the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem
[41:35] now there is at Jerusalem by the Sheep
[41:38] market a pool now do you catch the irony
[41:42] of this my brother and sister it wasn't
[41:44] by the hog market it wasn't by the steer
[41:47] market it wasn't by the donkey market it
[41:51] was by the sheep market amen which is
[41:57] called in the Hebrew tongue Bethsaida
[42:00] having five porches and these lay a
[42:03] great multitude of impotent folk of
[42:06] blind and halt and withered waiting for
[42:08] the moving of the water for an angel
[42:11] went down at a certain season into the
[42:13] pool and troubled the water whosoever
[42:15] then first after the troubling of the
[42:18] water stepped in was made whole of
[42:20] whatsoever disease he had and a certain
[42:23] man was there which had had an infirmity
[42:25] thirty and eight years now we don't know
[42:29] how long that he had set or been here we
[42:34] don't have any idea how many days weeks
[42:36] months maybe even years but he had this
[42:42] infirmity a long time when Jesus saw him
[42:46] live and knew that he had now a long
[42:49] time in that case he saith unto Him will
[42:52] thou be made whole oh my my brother and
[42:56] sister he'd been a long time in that
[42:59] case a long time under that affliction
[43:03] the impotent man answered him sir I have
[43:07] no man when the water is troubled to put
[43:10] me into the pool but while I am coming
[43:13] another step a--the down before me jesus
[43:17] saith unto Him rise take up thy bed and
[43:20] walk
[43:22] Heavenly Father we ask for your
[43:24] blessings this morning Lord to be with
[43:26] the Saints wherever they might be this
[43:28] morning father at home or some distant
[43:32] place father Lord we would just ask that
[43:34] you would just come move nigh on to us
[43:36] today Lord may your Holy Spirit
[43:39] we have individual needs but yet as a
[43:41] body of believers we all have the same
[43:44] needs for we are one body and Lord we
[43:46] ask you to come down father wherever we
[43:49] would be separated as it were physically
[43:51] this morning we have come in one mind
[43:53] and one accord to worship you to receive
[43:56] from You Father and we ask now speak
[43:59] freely
[43:59] to us Lord coming or mits Lord speak
[44:02] freely
[44:03] may our hearts be opened father to
[44:06] receive we ask for your blessings and we
[44:08] give praise and glory and honor to you
[44:10] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[44:14] you may be seated you know I just want
[44:16] to say that this last week you know
[44:19] things are timely and you know sometimes
[44:23] we can get in a condition where if we're
[44:26] not careful all we see is the problems
[44:29] you know we can see the flaws we can see
[44:32] what is lacking and I sure enjoyed our
[44:35] brother Chris's sermon this last Sunday
[44:37] my brother and sister it's time for us
[44:40] to be a people that are grateful it's
[44:42] time for us to voice from our hearts
[44:44] thank you Lord for saving me it struck
[44:48] me you know that the other day I've been
[44:50] having a tremendous pain in my foot
[44:52] I hadn't even mentioned it to sister
[44:55] Jerry and I was just kind of struggling
[44:57] with that when I would get out of bed in
[44:59] the morning sometimes it would hurt so
[45:01] bad I couldn't hardly take that first
[45:03] step sometimes by the time the day was
[45:06] over all I could think about was sitting
[45:08] down in my easy chair and the other
[45:10] morning I woke up and I was laying there
[45:12] in bed and I went to get out of bed and
[45:16] I stretched forth my leg and you know I
[45:18] thought something's different but it
[45:20] didn't quite register and I got out of
[45:22] bed and I walked and got ready for work
[45:25] and and before I made it out of the
[45:28] house it struck me my foot doesn't hurt
[45:30] and I just thank the Lord that I was
[45:33] able to just stop and say thank you Lord
[45:36] for taking this pain away and then
[45:39] brother Chris comes right along a couple
[45:41] days after that a few days after that
[45:44] preaches on gratitude and it struck me
[45:46] deep in my heart Lord we're not thankful
[45:49] enough we need to open our mouth and say
[45:52] Lord no matter what our circumstances
[45:53] answer is a rich-poor this that the
[45:56] other Lord to be able to say thank you
[45:59] Lord for saving my soul - thank you Lord
[46:01] for having called me out of Darkness
[46:04] amen into the light of the gospel amen
[46:08] Oh hallelujah you know as we look in
[46:11] this thought this morning my brother and
[46:13] sister
[46:14] you know once again as I said my title
[46:16] he is here and I believe with all of my
[46:19] heart because the Word of God said that
[46:21] this morning here in this building here
[46:23] at the church even though there just be
[46:25] a few with us here in the building this
[46:28] morning we as a body join together
[46:30] around the Word of God that we are a
[46:34] great body amen we are the body of
[46:37] Christ amen but the prophet of God told
[46:40] us that this body amen that our Lord
[46:43] Jesus is half and we are half and he is
[46:45] not complete without us and certainly we
[46:48] recognize we are not complete without
[46:50] him and so I say thank you Lord for
[46:53] including bringing into this a great
[46:56] body of Christ someone like me
[46:58] amen you know as Jesus come into the
[47:02] pool there Bethsaida you know this great
[47:05] number of people now we don't have an
[47:07] exact count but my brother and sister a
[47:09] multitude it says a multitude is a great
[47:13] number of people not a handful not a
[47:15] dozen or two but a great number and you
[47:19] know if we was to get really into our
[47:21] research we could probably figure out
[47:23] the size of the area that was there but
[47:26] in my mind and as excuse me for making
[47:30] an assumption but in my mind whatever
[47:32] that area was it was full in my mind I
[47:36] see a great need and the reason I say
[47:38] that is because we look around the world
[47:40] we live in today and the hospitals are
[47:43] full the rehabs are full there's many
[47:46] people in their homes suffering from
[47:48] afflictions and so I just believe that
[47:50] there would have been a great group of
[47:52] people that would be gathered there at
[47:55] the at this Pool of Bethesda and you
[47:58] know they were there waiting they had
[48:00] something they were desiring and you
[48:02] know we look and we can see obviously
[48:05] what the prophet of God said about it
[48:07] just look to your Bible and you will
[48:09] recognize where this come from
[48:11] that Jesus walked in the midst of this
[48:14] great group of people he didn't just
[48:16] come to the fringe and and find someone
[48:20] and talked to them but he walked right
[48:21] through the midst of them
[48:23] and he was right there present many did
[48:26] not even recognize him many had no
[48:28] acknowledgement of his existence but he
[48:31] walks in the midst of them until he
[48:34] finds the one that he is anointed to
[48:38] speak to now my brother and sister later
[48:40] in this same scripture our Lord Jesus
[48:43] says these words that I do nothing but
[48:45] what I see the father now this was
[48:47] brother Branham clarifies this and says
[48:49] this is he didn't hear the father he
[48:52] didn't catch this or catch that he
[48:54] didn't get a note didn't get a letter
[48:56] but what he saw the father do amen
[49:00] imagine my brother and sister how
[49:01] beautiful this is and tied to our
[49:04] generation that it's not a matter of
[49:06] hearing the word but you have to be able
[49:09] to see it and that's why the day that
[49:11] we're living in me many people say well
[49:13] I heard the message I wanted you know
[49:16] this and I heard that and I heard the
[49:18] prophets say but do you see the plan of
[49:21] God do you see God in your midst do you
[49:24] see God working do you see God opening
[49:27] his word because it's not just by
[49:30] hearing alone my brother and sister so
[49:32] we look at this and see how that he come
[49:35] and he's there and he comes and he moves
[49:38] through the great multitude of people
[49:39] and he comes to one man who's had an
[49:42] affliction for a long time one man who
[49:46] might not look in the natural outer
[49:48] appearance any different than literally
[49:51] dozens or maybe hundreds of other people
[49:53] and we don't know exactly what his
[49:56] affliction is but we do recognize that
[49:59] this affliction kept him from easily
[50:02] moving to the pool now you could see my
[50:05] brother and how this I just want to move
[50:07] off and clarify this now these people
[50:10] were there because there was a history
[50:13] as it were a testimony that when the
[50:16] angel comin troubled the water those
[50:18] whom that one who may
[50:20] in the water first was healed this was
[50:23] not a story this was not something that
[50:25] someone had told somebody I heard
[50:28] somebody said but my brother and sister
[50:30] these people were there because this was
[50:32] real and I say God help us with our
[50:35] young people and those around us let
[50:37] them see something real don't let it be
[50:41] we said that sometime 50 years ago God
[50:44] was in the church and moving let God be
[50:47] in the church today and moving so that
[50:51] they can see it is real also hallelujah
[50:54] amen so everyone my brother and sister
[50:57] that was there was there because they
[50:59] had a heart's desire to at some point
[51:02] sometime be able to get into the water
[51:05] and receive their healing now you say
[51:08] well he went through all that multitude
[51:11] to come to one well 2nd Timothy 2 and 19
[51:15] we see the scripture says nevertheless
[51:17] the foundation of God standeth sure
[51:20] having this seal the Lord knoweth them
[51:24] that are his amen
[51:27] it wasn't random he didn't wander
[51:29] through that multitude of people until
[51:31] this guy looked like a nice man someone
[51:34] I should probably help God searched out
[51:37] that day at the pool that that was his
[51:41] and he brought Redemption healing to
[51:44] that man amen hallelujah and let
[51:47] everyone that nameth the name of Christ
[51:49] depart from iniquity Amen I say amen to
[51:54] that scripture now brother Branham
[51:57] clarifies and we can just simply take it
[51:59] back to our Bible but just to put in
[52:02] that context brother Branham shows us or
[52:04] speaks how that God has made healing
[52:07] available in every age right now the
[52:10] reason we can put that foundation even
[52:13] though someone might say now where was
[52:15] healing at this time where was healing
[52:17] at that time it's Jesus Christ the same
[52:19] yesterday today and forever and what God
[52:22] is today he was yesterday and will be
[52:25] tomorrow amen
[52:27] I am THE LORD thy God and I change not
[52:30] amen
[52:31] so we see how that a healing
[52:33] has been available in every age and I
[52:36] believe that might not hurt us this
[52:38] morning to lift a hand if you would so
[52:40] choose and say he is my healer Amen to
[52:43] make the claim for the day that we live
[52:45] in that you believe right in this hour
[52:48] and I God is still my healer amen I'll
[52:52] tell you my brother and sister God is
[52:54] moving we're living in a day that
[52:56] technology is allowing things that
[52:58] happen in other nations allowing a
[53:00] things that happened on the other side
[53:02] of our own nation wherever might be to
[53:04] come and be available and we're starting
[53:07] to see a with the use of technology
[53:10] healings that have taken place in
[53:12] families diabetics being healed people
[53:15] with cancer being healed eyes that are
[53:19] losing their vision cataracts and things
[53:22] like that being healed my brother and
[53:24] sister and so as we look in this hour we
[53:27] realize that God is still moving with
[53:29] the same power the same authority now as
[53:33] we look at this I want to shift a little
[53:34] bit just take a little bit of a corner
[53:37] you might say you know back when Israel
[53:40] was in the wilderness and and they were
[53:42] moving along see they when they left
[53:45] Goshen they come right down
[53:47] God didn't waste much time proving what
[53:50] was in their hearts and they come right
[53:52] down to the Red Sea and a doubt and fear
[53:55] no look at the age we're living in this
[53:58] Cove at 19 they're telling us already
[54:00] voices saying well it's going to come
[54:03] back this next winter and it'll be worse
[54:05] well my brother and sister I still
[54:07] believe there would be those saying now
[54:09] now don't you be claiming that that
[54:12] you're sealed from this because there's
[54:14] believers that have caught it and passed
[54:16] away while my brother and sister there
[54:18] might be believers that they said they
[54:21] had this and they might be passed from
[54:23] us but before the foundation of the
[54:25] world God had put a day a time a minute
[54:30] a second that that brother or sister
[54:32] would be called home no kovat 19 took
[54:36] them God took them home if there hadn't
[54:39] been a virus God would have taken them
[54:41] home regardless
[54:42] either that or God's not in control so
[54:47] as we look upon this and realize my
[54:49] brother and sister well you say brother
[54:51] Paul what it what if you get that well
[54:53] I'll just trust the Lord hey man I have
[54:56] shaken well maybe I shouldn't say this
[54:58] because I shook some of your hands this
[54:59] morning but my brother and sister I
[55:01] shake hands with people amen I'm not
[55:04] afraid of what the devil's got to offer
[55:06] amen
[55:07] I tell you we were doing some stuff here
[55:10] at their church yesterday brother Isaac
[55:12] and I'm picking up some stuff cleaning
[55:15] it up taking it away and a man was out
[55:17] in the parking lot and and you know he's
[55:20] out there and and his little kids he
[55:22] says they live a couple three houses
[55:24] down here they got no place but the
[55:26] street for his children two cute little
[55:29] girls to ride bicycles and and he said
[55:31] they often come down here in the evening
[55:34] time and his little girls love to ride
[55:36] over the speed bumps now my brother and
[55:39] sister this man he by most standards
[55:41] would look like pretty rough character
[55:43] but he had these cute little girls and
[55:45] look at that all I want to offer to him
[55:48] I'm not concerned what he could offer
[55:50] back to me what I want to offer to him
[55:53] is Christ now if we're too afraid to
[55:56] engage my brother and sister then we
[55:58] might as well isolate ourselves we might
[56:00] as well just find a hole and crawl in it
[56:03] I'm not afraid my God is in control
[56:06] hallelujah everything that's happened to
[56:08] me now we know God's permissible will
[56:10] let's not get confused here you go out
[56:13] and take a hammer and hit your hand
[56:14] that's not God's plan but my brother and
[56:17] sister you realize we're not afraid of
[56:19] what is coming amen
[56:21] our God's already made a plan for us
[56:24] amen so he made healing available in
[56:26] every age now look when they're going
[56:29] through the wilderness Israel brought
[56:31] this judgment upon themselves because
[56:34] they refused to trust God they refused
[56:36] to believe the word that God had spoken
[56:38] when he said that he would take them
[56:40] into a land a land that was flowing with
[56:43] milk and honey
[56:43] a land that was beyond as it were their
[56:46] imagination and truly it was because
[56:48] they could not fathom in their mind what
[56:51] God was giving to them and I believe we
[56:54] suffer the same affliction today that
[56:57] people do not fathom they don't have an
[56:59] idea of the
[57:01] the blessings that God would like to
[57:02] pour out hey men the inheritance that is
[57:05] laying there for us my brother and
[57:07] sister is beyond our human comprehension
[57:10] and so Israel's unbelief brought them to
[57:14] a place their constant murmuring their
[57:16] constant complaining their constant just
[57:19] dragging their feet on this plan of God
[57:21] and so in that God brought a judgment
[57:24] upon them and so they are there in the
[57:26] Serpent's rised up raised up and and are
[57:29] abiding them and they are dying and God
[57:32] raised up a brazen serpent now my
[57:35] brother and sister we won't go into the
[57:37] whole context of the brazen serpent but
[57:40] the prophet of God simply says that it
[57:42] was sin judged amen and so it was there
[57:45] as the people looked to the brazen
[57:48] serpent and believed brother Branham
[57:50] shows us how that become a point of
[57:53] contact they looked at that and when
[57:55] they looked at the brazen serpent and
[57:57] believed they were expressing that in
[58:00] their heart was faith that God had come
[58:03] to deliver them and so those that looked
[58:06] my brother and sister lived but look at
[58:08] this now the brazen serpent was right
[58:10] there in their myths and people will
[58:13] still dying
[58:14] that means someone didn't believe enough
[58:17] to even raise their eyes and look at the
[58:20] brazen serpent and let that become their
[58:23] point of contact my brother and sister
[58:26] that anointing is still relevant it's
[58:27] still fresh it's still here that people
[58:30] would deny there is a God but yet they
[58:32] can't even explain the reason of their
[58:34] existence but they will not give the
[58:37] acknowledgment of the existence of a God
[58:39] amen and so all they had to do is look
[58:42] up and believe now look here in gifts
[58:45] and callings are without repentance
[58:47] later on after the days of the serpent
[58:49] God sent an angel down from heaven
[58:51] trouble of water on a pool called
[58:53] Bethsaida and ever who stepped into the
[58:55] water first having faith see there's the
[58:58] ingredient someone couldn't just jump in
[59:01] and say okay I jumped in the water here
[59:03] worse the healing oh my brother and
[59:06] sister they tested brother branham that
[59:08] same way you know let's cut this baby
[59:10] let's hurt this baby and you heal him oh
[59:13] I'll tell you what
[59:14] prophet of God explains it maybe not in
[59:16] exact words but that's a sick mind
[59:18] that's a sick mind that would hurt a
[59:21] baby and use that as a way to try to
[59:23] prove whether God is real or not
[59:25] well one that wouldn't take place
[59:27] because their unbelief amen but look at
[59:30] this now after the days God sent an
[59:33] angel down from him in trouble water on
[59:34] pool called Bethsaida and who stepped in
[59:37] that water first having faith was healed
[59:39] of whatsoever disease they had into the
[59:42] waters now the brass serpent done no
[59:45] healing it was their faith in what God
[59:47] had done by the brass serpent is that
[59:51] right the water done no healing it was
[59:54] the angel of God on the water that done
[59:57] the healing the water couldn't say see
[1:00:00] I'm healing water this is where the
[1:00:03] Catholics got all confused right they've
[1:00:05] got this water they blessed the water
[1:00:06] they sprinkle it on everything my
[1:00:08] brother and sister they they think that
[1:00:10] was the cure it's not the water you
[1:00:13] can't bless as it were carnally blessed
[1:00:15] the water and the water do it it's when
[1:00:18] the angel of God is on that water Amen
[1:00:21] see I'm healing water no it was the
[1:00:23] angel doing the healing when the angel
[1:00:25] left the water was water now to go a
[1:00:29] little farther the prophet of God not
[1:00:30] writing this message about the prophet
[1:00:32] of God said when God would use a man
[1:00:34] when he would call a man and bring him
[1:00:36] to a place that that man was fully sold
[1:00:38] out fully committed to God and has just
[1:00:42] present himself and God would use that
[1:00:45] man he would anoint that man and use him
[1:00:47] to fulfill the things of God but when
[1:00:50] the Spirit of God would leave that man
[1:00:52] he is just a man so we look and find
[1:00:54] that it's not just who we are some
[1:00:57] people say well we got a great pastor we
[1:00:59] got a great ministry we got this we got
[1:01:01] that but my brother and sister we know
[1:01:03] that it is the angel of the Lord or in
[1:01:05] our day amen the Holy Ghost has come
[1:01:08] down and there's where the anointing is
[1:01:10] at amen so you look at that and realize
[1:01:13] the brazen serpent the water in the pool
[1:01:15] of bethsaida and you look at all these
[1:01:17] things that God is using now my brother
[1:01:19] and sister this scripture tells us mark
[1:01:21] 16 and if we would believe Amen anoint
[1:01:24] them with horror
[1:01:24] lay our hands upon them they'd be healed
[1:01:26] is their healing hand
[1:01:28] no my brother and sister it's people
[1:01:30] with faith joining together just
[1:01:32] fulfilling the Word of God and God
[1:01:34] honors that fulfilling and manifestation
[1:01:37] and brings forth the promise and so as
[1:01:39] we look at that we recognize that God
[1:01:42] can anoint anything you want you know
[1:01:44] you want to take that a little bit
[1:01:45] further amen God used a donkey to talk
[1:01:48] to Balaam amen my brother and sister
[1:01:50] that there's no such thing as a talking
[1:01:52] donkey amen but you see God knew God
[1:01:55] spoke he used the unusual the abnormal
[1:01:58] to trying to catch his attention amen
[1:02:01] now look in this Oh my brother and
[1:02:05] sister I just get excited this morning
[1:02:08] excuse me hallelujah Oh in the sermon
[1:02:13] identification talking about now a point
[1:02:16] of contact a sir sir man identification
[1:02:19] let our lives be so salty that others
[1:02:23] can watch the way we act and live that
[1:02:25] they'll want to live that way too now my
[1:02:28] brother and sister when we go to witness
[1:02:30] the problem we make sometimes now I was
[1:02:33] talking to an individual the other day
[1:02:34] and they said brother Paul am I am I am
[1:02:36] I making a mistake by speaking to these
[1:02:40] people and not mentioning brother
[1:02:42] branham I said no absolutely because
[1:02:44] brother Branham was pointing to Jesus
[1:02:45] Christ and we are pointing to Jesus
[1:02:48] Christ and many people will then just go
[1:02:50] to their computer and type in william
[1:02:51] branham and go all these people are
[1:02:53] crazy my brother and sister what you do
[1:02:56] is you present Jesus Christ to them you
[1:02:58] present the life that is in the word you
[1:03:02] present that to them and when they are
[1:03:04] so hungry and they go out and they can't
[1:03:06] find that anywhere else they'll come
[1:03:09] back and say what is it you've got and
[1:03:11] then the door is open amen we look at
[1:03:14] that and present that we want to be so
[1:03:17] salty that they want to live that way
[1:03:19] too you know Jesus said you're the salt
[1:03:21] of the earth but if the salt has lost
[1:03:23] its testimony now its savor its drawing
[1:03:29] power then it can no longer know no more
[1:03:32] heal or save salt saves when it contacts
[1:03:36] and this is part of this what I said
[1:03:39] earlier my brother and sister if we as
[1:03:41] believer
[1:03:42] isolate ourself I think it's an
[1:03:44] affliction that is upon message
[1:03:46] believers that we isolate ourselves from
[1:03:48] the whole world because we act like
[1:03:51] we're afraid of whatever the world's
[1:03:52] God's going to get on us like a virus
[1:03:55] and somehow we're going to fall my
[1:03:57] brother and sister if we're no stronger
[1:03:59] spiritually then to be able to do that
[1:04:03] then we're in trouble already
[1:04:05] amen we are stronger amen greater is he
[1:04:08] that is next to you in the church you go
[1:04:11] to no greater is He that is in you than
[1:04:14] he that is in this world and so if we're
[1:04:17] afraid to have any contact with the
[1:04:19] world my brother and sister what kind of
[1:04:21] testimony you can have a perfect
[1:04:23] testimony if there's no one to tell it
[1:04:25] to then well you just have a perfect
[1:04:29] testimony that's untouched and unshared
[1:04:32] oh my salt saves when it contacts we
[1:04:38] must be God's contact God's expecting us
[1:04:43] my brother and sister now you take a it
[1:04:46] used to be back in the days when they
[1:04:48] had those fuses and stuff you had a
[1:04:50] little brass bar a little boss bar and
[1:04:52] you had to swing that down and engage it
[1:04:55] in the other side to get the current -
[1:04:58] we live in a day now we just flip a
[1:04:59] breaker to achieve the same thing but my
[1:05:02] brother and sister if there's no contact
[1:05:04] there's no power a man has to be a
[1:05:06] continuity to pass the current through
[1:05:09] and so by God's grace amen we must be
[1:05:13] God's contact that means we must engage
[1:05:15] we must be in contact to share the power
[1:05:19] of God we are his point of contact as
[1:05:24] brother Roberts many times refers to
[1:05:27] putting his hand on the radio or
[1:05:28] something for a point of contact now if
[1:05:30] you're not familiar with this I believe
[1:05:32] y'all would be it's part of the message
[1:05:34] brother Brown speaks of it more than
[1:05:35] once but Oral Roberts used to in his
[1:05:38] radio broadcasts would be speaking and
[1:05:40] he would encourage the people to reach
[1:05:43] out if they believed what was being
[1:05:45] preached reach out lay your hand on the
[1:05:48] radio now people would be like that
[1:05:50] seems weird but you see he had tapped
[1:05:53] into knowing that in the human element
[1:05:55] we need a point of contact oh my brother
[1:06:00] and sister so brother branham does not
[1:06:02] go man or Roberts who's way off
[1:06:04] no brother branham talks about how the
[1:06:07] point of contact is and we need to be
[1:06:10] that point of contact hallelujah so we
[1:06:14] look at that and we'll see now now
[1:06:16] someone might say well brother Paul in
[1:06:17] this story you're sharing with us this
[1:06:20] morning
[1:06:20] obviously our Lord Jesus Christ is the
[1:06:23] point of contact yes my brother and
[1:06:25] sister but I've got Christ in me you've
[1:06:27] got Christ in you so it's not us trying
[1:06:31] to assert a position Jesus when he was
[1:06:34] standing there dealing with all those
[1:06:36] doubters and Sadducees Pharisees and all
[1:06:39] of them and when he said I and my father
[1:06:41] are one they were angry because they
[1:06:45] thought he was a surfing a position of
[1:06:46] authority he didn't have but little did
[1:06:49] they know hey man that this was
[1:06:52] literally God incarnate in flesh right
[1:06:55] in their myths and Jesus could say that
[1:06:57] because he saw what his father was doing
[1:07:00] so this flash here was speaking of what
[1:07:03] the Word was fulfilling oh my brother
[1:07:06] and sister how beautiful that is
[1:07:08] amen so it's here that is saying he that
[1:07:12] we are the point of contact now at the
[1:07:14] pool of the Sailor
[1:07:15] look God provided a point of contact for
[1:07:19] the people now we're not talking about
[1:07:20] Jesus being there we're talking about
[1:07:22] the pool itself God provided a point of
[1:07:25] contact these people were there my
[1:07:27] brother and sister because they saw
[1:07:30] literally themselves they saw the water
[1:07:34] being troubled nobody was out there with
[1:07:38] a boat paddle or stick stirring the
[1:07:40] water saying oh Gideon you'll get healed
[1:07:43] none of this you might be but when the
[1:07:46] angel come now the scripture says in the
[1:07:48] season so there was a season no man knew
[1:07:52] this season right the scripture tells us
[1:07:54] that no man knows the day or the time of
[1:07:56] the hour and God still working in that
[1:07:58] same Channel he didn't come and though
[1:08:00] people regular as clockwork at 12:01
[1:08:03] today the water will stir my brother and
[1:08:05] sister they would align the sides of the
[1:08:07] pool and
[1:08:08] as the water started to be troubled they
[1:08:11] would have dived in fell in been pushed
[1:08:13] in whatever was necessary but you see it
[1:08:16] was in an unsuspecting time an unknown
[1:08:19] time that the Spirit of God the angel of
[1:08:22] the Lord would come down in the midst of
[1:08:25] the people and people would be like well
[1:08:28] you know I went to church service after
[1:08:30] service it seems like our pastors
[1:08:32] struggling and he has sometimes my
[1:08:35] brother and sister and you say well I
[1:08:36] just leave Church feeling uh nanou inton
[1:08:39] I just don't know but my sister will
[1:08:42] touch on that I'm a little head of
[1:08:43] myself there but you'll see my brother's
[1:08:45] sister no one knew when that angel was
[1:08:47] going to come down and stir that water
[1:08:48] no one would do there but look what
[1:08:51] happened here you come and you know that
[1:08:54] the angel of the Lord is present and the
[1:08:56] water starts to be troubled and the
[1:08:59] angel of the Lord is there and people
[1:09:02] knew my brother and sister once again I
[1:09:05] want to say there had been many healings
[1:09:07] there had many testimonies that if you
[1:09:10] got in that water no matter what
[1:09:13] affliction that you had if was healed
[1:09:16] and I believe I could say that it would
[1:09:19] have been every single affliction just
[1:09:22] like the leper that went away with the
[1:09:23] ten he come back to worship the Lord
[1:09:25] Jesus amen because he caught a
[1:09:28] revelation that when he was to show
[1:09:30] himself to the priest that his he was
[1:09:32] walking with his friends something
[1:09:35] struck him it might not have come with
[1:09:37] clarity problem we have many times as we
[1:09:39] need every I dotted every comma every
[1:09:42] punctuation and if we can't see that so
[1:09:45] perfectly then it couldn't be of God but
[1:09:47] I believe is that leper was walking away
[1:09:49] something stirred his heart you need to
[1:09:52] go back and you need to give praise to
[1:09:54] him you need to give thanks to him and
[1:09:57] what was it he was manifesting the very
[1:09:59] words that Jesus had told him the
[1:10:02] commandment was to go and show yourself
[1:10:04] to the priest and he caught a revelation
[1:10:06] whether he fully recognized it or not
[1:10:09] that the priest he was to show himself
[1:10:11] and give praise to was not in front of
[1:10:14] him in a temple but was there in the
[1:10:16] wilderness with no pillow amen no place
[1:10:19] even call his own he will
[1:10:21] back those got healed of leprosy the
[1:10:24] word says he was delivered set free from
[1:10:27] every affliction oh you my brother and
[1:10:31] sister God is here he's real he's
[1:10:34] powerful and he's offering this very
[1:10:37] same offering to you and I hallelujah
[1:10:40] amen
[1:10:42] so these healings was there attracting
[1:10:45] the people to come in Oh imagine the
[1:10:48] stories that had been told maybe someone
[1:10:50] had been there maybe they weren't
[1:10:51] afflicted they were healthy but maybe
[1:10:53] they had a relative they had a friend
[1:10:55] they had helped get them down to the
[1:10:57] pool and they're walking down the street
[1:10:59] and they would see someone and they tell
[1:11:01] him did you know that just a couple days
[1:11:03] ago down here at the pool of bethsaida
[1:11:05] that someone was healed when they
[1:11:07] stepped into the water after the
[1:11:09] troubling of the water that person would
[1:11:12] be there really if they wanted to be
[1:11:14] delivered if they really had a desire
[1:11:16] now I want to be set free from my
[1:11:18] bondage and my brother and sister this
[1:11:20] morning I want to say that bondage is
[1:11:22] not always physical and sometimes it's
[1:11:25] in the soul sometimes it's in the mind
[1:11:27] amen but whatever the bondage is if you
[1:11:30] really want to be set free and then you
[1:11:34] will go and you will pay attention amen
[1:11:37] hallelujah Oh many stories are what
[1:11:41] God's done in the past and we have that
[1:11:43] today I've been criticized probably be
[1:11:46] criticized again for for talking about
[1:11:50] these things where we're constantly
[1:11:51] looking back my brother and sister I I
[1:11:54] look back I won't I won't deny that I
[1:11:57] look back but I'm also looking forward
[1:11:59] and I'm also looking right into the day
[1:12:01] that I'm living right here knowing that
[1:12:04] God comes when God wants to move God
[1:12:06] will move amen I don't have to look back
[1:12:09] and say look what brother Branham what
[1:12:11] happened in this meeting in 1959 well
[1:12:14] that's good my brother and sister but it
[1:12:16] struck my heart thank you Lord it's the
[1:12:19] same God hallelujah the same God that
[1:12:23] was there in those meetings delivering
[1:12:25] people is right here with us today
[1:12:27] inside of Grace inside of your home
[1:12:31] today inside the cab of your truck
[1:12:33] where
[1:12:34] you might be it's the same god that's
[1:12:37] here today and if you will not respond
[1:12:40] with the same God here today then I say
[1:12:43] God help you because there's no other
[1:12:46] avenue to connect with you then through
[1:12:48] God's word and his word is alive and
[1:12:51] well today hallelujah amen oh no doubt
[1:12:56] my brother and sister amount these
[1:12:57] people imagine here they are around the
[1:12:59] pool and no doubt much talk you know as
[1:13:02] people are gathered together there and
[1:13:04] and you know I personally this is just
[1:13:06] my own understanding of it I don't
[1:13:08] believe these people got up every
[1:13:10] evening and went back and went back to
[1:13:12] their house some of them would not have
[1:13:14] had as it were transportation would not
[1:13:16] have had the ability but there also
[1:13:18] would have been if you ever got a spot
[1:13:20] right on the side of the pool you
[1:13:23] wouldn't want to lose that to go and so
[1:13:26] I believe what happened is the people
[1:13:28] started to congregate there originally
[1:13:30] and it just kind of grew inhale it come
[1:13:33] to a place that people were just there
[1:13:35] around the pool all the time and they
[1:13:37] were kind of just started living there
[1:13:39] and you know they were talked about the
[1:13:43] healings that had taken place and you
[1:13:45] know how that they would be healed if
[1:13:47] they got to the water first they start
[1:13:50] to share you know if I could if this
[1:13:52] would if this would happen I could be
[1:13:55] healed my brother and sister in fact I
[1:13:58] tell you I just maybe it's my vivid
[1:14:00] imagination you don't agree well forgive
[1:14:02] me I won't press upon you but look at
[1:14:05] this my brother and sister I believe
[1:14:06] that they made friends there I believe
[1:14:08] they were there by the pool I believe
[1:14:10] that they were there and they started to
[1:14:12] know these people started to know their
[1:14:14] family started to know all of these
[1:14:17] different circumstances and they got
[1:14:19] real comfortable kind of like going to
[1:14:20] church hallelujah it just became what we
[1:14:25] do this is where we go this is where our
[1:14:26] friends are these when we know they know
[1:14:28] the story of their life we know this we
[1:14:30] know that my brother and sister I
[1:14:31] believe they got there made their
[1:14:33] friends shared their stories they got
[1:14:35] comfortable in their surrounding oh I'll
[1:14:38] tell you what I'll be the death of many
[1:14:39] a person they got comfortable in church
[1:14:41] I'll tell you what we didn't bring here
[1:14:44] and we didn't bring you here anyhow but
[1:14:46] we didn't bring you here
[1:14:47] to get you comfortable maybe I'll tell
[1:14:49] you if we believe Tozer and Spurgeon in
[1:14:51] them if we haven't made you angry and
[1:14:53] haven't fussed you up we didn't do our
[1:14:55] job hallelujah
[1:14:57] but what is it we got the opposite twist
[1:14:59] today that if I go to church and the
[1:15:01] preacher don't make me happy I'm gonna
[1:15:03] find a different church well hallelujah
[1:15:06] we didn't call you here or God that
[1:15:07] means I'm sorry God didn't call you here
[1:15:10] to make you happy
[1:15:12] God called you here to set you free amen
[1:15:15] and I'll tell you what when you look at
[1:15:17] some of the scale that can get attached
[1:15:19] to humanity
[1:15:20] sometimes it takes a lot of washing of
[1:15:22] the water to get that off of them amen
[1:15:25] hallelujah any of those that feel
[1:15:27] scuffed and skinned right now forgive me
[1:15:29] amen but I'll tell you my job is not to
[1:15:32] make you happy amen it's God's job to
[1:15:36] make you happy I can't make you happy I
[1:15:38] won't be able to make you happy and I'm
[1:15:41] losing my desire to make you happy
[1:15:43] amen I've got a great desire to preach
[1:15:46] the gospel I just don't have much desire
[1:15:48] left to make you happy no I hope that
[1:15:50] don't offend anyone amen you see what
[1:15:55] happened they started losing sight they
[1:16:01] started going blind while they're there
[1:16:03] by the pool of the real purpose of why
[1:16:08] they were there oh I hope that soaks in
[1:16:15] my brother and sister the word tells us
[1:16:18] not to forsake the assembling of
[1:16:19] ourselves together especially as we see
[1:16:22] that time approaching but you see the
[1:16:25] house of God is not our social club the
[1:16:28] house of God is not our place we can
[1:16:31] express ourselves if you've got a gift
[1:16:33] thought is given to you and you've
[1:16:35] committed that to the Lord and the Lord
[1:16:37] lays it on your heart then you give the
[1:16:39] gift back to God but my brother and
[1:16:42] sister we oftentimes we view church more
[1:16:45] as an extension of our personal house
[1:16:47] and our personal family and it's become
[1:16:50] more of that than it has a house of God
[1:16:53] amen in the word says that a house of
[1:16:56] God is a house of correction amen Oh
[1:16:58] hallelujah they lost
[1:17:01] what they'd come for in the beginning
[1:17:04] they were there my brother and sister I
[1:17:08] believe I can say with assurance that
[1:17:10] many times people were talking to their
[1:17:12] neighbor to their friend to someone a
[1:17:15] family member that had come to bring
[1:17:17] provision to them and the angel stirring
[1:17:19] the water and they are completely
[1:17:22] distracted they completely miss it until
[1:17:25] someone starts to shout and holler and
[1:17:27] someone there's a splash and someone
[1:17:30] comes out of that water now my brother
[1:17:32] and sister the word doesn't say if they
[1:17:34] as soaked or marinated in that water for
[1:17:36] a while that then they were healed
[1:17:38] I believe my brother and sister they got
[1:17:40] in that pool and they got right back out
[1:17:42] and they were healed and that would
[1:17:44] catch the attention but what if you were
[1:17:46] sitting there and while this happened
[1:17:49] you were focused entirely on something
[1:17:51] else and when your attention is drawn
[1:17:54] Mac it would be something happened all
[1:17:57] my brother and sister I know of
[1:17:59] testimony I know of testimony that that
[1:18:02] you might call it the transgressor has
[1:18:04] testified that they were in church and
[1:18:08] their mind being somewhere else
[1:18:10] amen their thoughts their hearts
[1:18:12] somewhere else and find out that God had
[1:18:15] healed and delivered in the very service
[1:18:18] that they were bored to death in all I
[1:18:22] want you to think about that this
[1:18:24] morning the very service that they wish
[1:18:26] they were somewhere else God come down
[1:18:29] in the midst
[1:18:30] amen and we'll touch a little bit more
[1:18:32] on that hallelujah amen
[1:18:35] what your circumstance can become your
[1:18:39] way of life Hey
[1:18:42] how long you been here four years I've
[1:18:46] been going to grace I've been going here
[1:18:48] I've been going there for years have you
[1:18:51] got the deliverance that you're seeking
[1:18:53] no I haven't but this is where I go to
[1:18:57] church oh my brother and sister I'll
[1:19:00] tell you what we got way too much
[1:19:03] religion and not enough of God amen and
[1:19:07] I say Church don't let your current
[1:19:09] condition become the benchmark of your
[1:19:11] life this is the place in my life where
[1:19:13] I hit
[1:19:14] pinnacle my brother and sister my
[1:19:17] pinnacle if God would so granted is
[1:19:19] going to be standing in front of the
[1:19:21] throne of Almighty God it's not going to
[1:19:24] be an office it's not going to be a
[1:19:25] position it's not gonna be if I was no
[1:19:28] longer pastor of grace my brother and
[1:19:30] sister I'm still a son of God and I will
[1:19:33] still serve Him with a capacity that God
[1:19:36] has put me in there it's not because of
[1:19:38] an office that we would come and say we
[1:19:41] are spiritual amen but you see they
[1:19:44] found comfort and just being there now I
[1:19:48] have to tell you Saints when I don't
[1:19:50] make it to church I get antsy to be in
[1:19:54] church I want to be in church in fact
[1:19:57] there are some that well I'll just mind
[1:20:01] my own business hallelujah let's just
[1:20:06] say sometimes a little rebellion is
[1:20:08] probably good but the angel went down at
[1:20:15] a certain season verse 4 into the pool
[1:20:17] troubled the water and the first one in
[1:20:20] was made whole of whatsoever disease he
[1:20:23] hadn't I want you to think about this
[1:20:26] you got a disease maybe it's taking your
[1:20:28] life you're right there at the pool or
[1:20:32] within a step or two of the pool but
[1:20:37] you've built such a life that the pool
[1:20:41] is actually only the location or place
[1:20:46] of transaction of your life your life
[1:20:50] was not so focused that for day in and
[1:20:53] day out you looked for the pool now I
[1:20:57] don't know maybe there was rules maybe
[1:20:59] there's a handrail maybe there's a fence
[1:21:00] around the pool I have no idea but if
[1:21:03] there wasn't you would think that one
[1:21:06] would practically live on the edge of
[1:21:10] the pool and would desire enough to be
[1:21:14] delivered from their affliction that
[1:21:17] they would spend their life studying the
[1:21:21] pool and at the moment now pardon me I'm
[1:21:25] just a person that has to express things
[1:21:27] and the moment that the water stirred on
[1:21:32] the pool you would throw yourself in the
[1:21:34] pool turns out it was just an easterly
[1:21:38] breeze you might be wet but you'd climb
[1:21:41] out of the pool saying you know what
[1:21:43] I'll wait again for the water to be
[1:21:46] stirred but you see there come a life
[1:21:49] associated with the pool a life that had
[1:21:54] nothing to do with deliverance or
[1:21:57] healing it became a culture it became a
[1:22:01] tradition
[1:22:03] I'm afraid many of our churches have
[1:22:06] become as a pool of bethsaida we come
[1:22:11] there maybe not for the right reasons
[1:22:15] oh my you see being there didn't do one
[1:22:25] thing for their condition not one thing
[1:22:34] whether we're at home today or whether
[1:22:37] we were all gathered together in this
[1:22:38] church sitting on these pews this
[1:22:40] morning just being here or there
[1:22:45] wouldn't mean one thing my brother and
[1:22:47] sister it won't change you won't change
[1:22:49] me
[1:22:51] amen just being there doesn't do it you
[1:22:54] see they had to focus they had to pay
[1:22:55] attention they had to watch for the
[1:22:58] stirring of the water and it wasn't as
[1:23:00] though that they could just easily go
[1:23:03] over and climb in at their own will but
[1:23:05] they had to be committed to what God was
[1:23:07] doing because God had set the condition
[1:23:10] as the first person now we understand my
[1:23:13] brother and sister the day that we live
[1:23:15] in it's no longer about being about one
[1:23:17] or being the first but there is a
[1:23:19] certain condition that has to be brought
[1:23:22] to pass and is not just simply sitting
[1:23:25] in this church and this might sound a
[1:23:26] little harsh and I don't want to offend
[1:23:28] you but I've witnessed it right here in
[1:23:31] this church to come down to the ends of
[1:23:33] a service and see people before we're
[1:23:35] even dismissed picking up their car keys
[1:23:38] picking up their Bibles grabbing their
[1:23:40] coat
[1:23:41] all this stuff they're getting ready to
[1:23:42] leave they're collecting their stuff
[1:23:44] because they've got leaving on their
[1:23:46] mind and so as they're coming here the
[1:23:49] service is now over I've got places to
[1:23:52] go I've got people to see I've got
[1:23:54] things to do my brother and sister I
[1:23:57] hope this disturbs you I hope it don't
[1:23:59] make you angry I hope it stirs you
[1:24:00] because their mind is already somewhere
[1:24:03] else and while their mind is somewhere
[1:24:06] else
[1:24:06] I have many times witness the Holy Ghost
[1:24:09] coming down in the church and stirring
[1:24:13] people and see people crying out to God
[1:24:15] while others are out in the foyer
[1:24:17] talking about work last week next week
[1:24:20] this week not week whatever it might be
[1:24:23] now maybe it wasn't for them I couldn't
[1:24:25] say my brother and sister that sometimes
[1:24:27] things are just for an individual but I
[1:24:30] can assure you my brother and sister
[1:24:31] that I'll speak to you from my heart
[1:24:33] that many times the person that is ready
[1:24:36] to leave never engaged in this service
[1:24:40] the whole whole time they thought being
[1:24:43] in church was sufficient
[1:24:45] well good gather around the pool make a
[1:24:48] life there do whatever you want to build
[1:24:51] a tent to get a pillow get a blanket get
[1:24:54] your stereo get everything you want sit
[1:24:57] there at the pool for the rest of your
[1:24:59] life you'll never be healed you had to
[1:25:02] watch you had to look you had to pay
[1:25:04] attention you had to know when the
[1:25:07] moving of the Holy Spirit when the angel
[1:25:09] come down and stirred the water it was
[1:25:11] your job God didn't send a memo and say
[1:25:15] in 10 minutes I'll be at the pool be
[1:25:18] ready for me God said when I come if you
[1:25:21] look for me you will find me
[1:25:24] people say well our pastor preached kind
[1:25:27] of a very boring service well that's
[1:25:29] good God said he would be here and if
[1:25:32] you looked for him you would have found
[1:25:34] him oh my brother and sister you say
[1:25:37] brother Paul you're being harsh no I'm
[1:25:39] being honest I'm being honest because I
[1:25:41] love you because we got to break the
[1:25:43] tradition of religion and get back to
[1:25:46] serving God amen so you know what you
[1:25:49] got people they got this now look I want
[1:25:52] to speak kind of you might say I
[1:25:54] here you know we've got people there
[1:25:57] collecting their stuff got car keys in
[1:25:59] their hand and they're already standing
[1:26:01] at the end of the Pew I'll tell you now
[1:26:03] you might say well brother Paul I think
[1:26:05] you're talking about somebody no I'm not
[1:26:06] I'm talking about spirits but my brother
[1:26:08] and sister if the service is not over
[1:26:10] and you're already pointed to the door
[1:26:12] you didn't get what you should have
[1:26:15] gotten service we're not here my brother
[1:26:18] and sister to take a token portion and
[1:26:21] leave we're here to worship God and
[1:26:24] where is the worship the worship the
[1:26:27] true worship is not in the beginning of
[1:26:29] the service that sets us in a condition
[1:26:31] to hear the word and then the word
[1:26:34] brings a deliverance and it's the end
[1:26:36] that we truly worship my brother and
[1:26:38] sister at the opening of the word it
[1:26:40] stirs us just as the angel of the Lord
[1:26:43] stirred the pool there my brother and
[1:26:45] sister the Word of God serves the heart
[1:26:47] of a son or daughter of God and causes
[1:26:49] them to come to a place to worship and I
[1:26:51] can assure you my brother and sister let
[1:26:53] those that step down in the pool and
[1:26:55] receive their healing didn't get up and
[1:26:57] say good now I can go on with my life
[1:26:59] they knew they had experienced the
[1:27:01] supernatural they had experienced but
[1:27:04] they had to sit there day in and day out
[1:27:07] service after service all pardon me
[1:27:10] service after service they had to look
[1:27:14] for the stirring of the water they had
[1:27:16] to be ready because they knew there was
[1:27:19] a promise in the word that said where
[1:27:21] two or three are gathered in my name I
[1:27:23] will be in their building no in their
[1:27:28] midst oh my brother and sister Oh
[1:27:31] hallelujah
[1:27:33] well I still love you I hope you still
[1:27:36] love me amen
[1:27:38] you see what happens in those moments
[1:27:41] you see God's not predictable God comes
[1:27:44] in his season I've seen this happen but
[1:27:47] God used it to teach me a lesson one
[1:27:49] time in far southern Chile preaching in
[1:27:53] a church service there and just seemed
[1:27:55] like everything was wrong it just the
[1:27:57] translator was struggling to to speak
[1:28:00] the words that I was speaking and I knew
[1:28:03] it was just the devil because he's a
[1:28:05] he's a fluent he's he's capable
[1:28:07] oh but he's just stumbled and he
[1:28:10] struggled and he kept asking me you know
[1:28:12] what did you say I didn't understand and
[1:28:14] when the service is over the people just
[1:28:16] looking and and I was like oh Lord and
[1:28:19] and I went in the office is in the back
[1:28:21] corner of the church and I went in the
[1:28:23] office and I was sitting there in the
[1:28:25] dark and I'm ashamed to admit this but
[1:28:27] it's good confession is and I sitting in
[1:28:30] there and I was like service was a bomb
[1:28:33] I wished up isn't even here and then
[1:28:36] there was a knock on the door and one of
[1:28:38] the Deacons spoke to the translator and
[1:28:41] he said brother Paul they want you and I
[1:28:44] thought Maya what do they want me for I
[1:28:46] stepped down to the door and half of the
[1:28:48] churches in the altar crying out to God
[1:28:50] my brother and sister you see we put too
[1:28:52] much on what we think what we see how we
[1:28:55] feel and God comes in an unpredictable
[1:28:58] time in an unpredictable way what seemed
[1:29:01] like a totally flat service something
[1:29:03] there's total confusion and chaos but
[1:29:05] God said I'm pleased and there's someone
[1:29:07] here that needs a deliverer is someone
[1:29:10] in the congregation looked and saw the
[1:29:13] stirring of the water and they said I'm
[1:29:16] getting in because the angel of the Lord
[1:29:18] the Holy Ghost is here I'm gonna get in
[1:29:21] my life will be changed and their lives
[1:29:23] are changed to this day hallelujah God
[1:29:27] has allowed us to remain friends with
[1:29:29] with many of those that were in that
[1:29:32] service and that time and their lives
[1:29:34] have been forever changed not because of
[1:29:36] me me I too went out the door got in a
[1:29:39] car and went back to the place we were
[1:29:40] staying
[1:29:41] but God was there to do business my
[1:29:44] brother and sister and God said I'll
[1:29:46] when you preach a great service I'll
[1:29:51] come down and deliver when you do this I
[1:29:57] know my brother and sister the angel
[1:29:59] came when the angel was sent by God the
[1:30:03] angel came at the Angels timing and
[1:30:07] stirred the waters oh I'll tell you what
[1:30:11] there's more than one testimony my
[1:30:14] brother and sister of simple simple
[1:30:17] services and God coming and doing the
[1:30:20] miraculous
[1:30:22] because someone was sitting at the edge
[1:30:25] of the pool are you with me someone
[1:30:29] sitting at the edge of the pool saying I
[1:30:31] need you Lord I'm at my edge Lord I met
[1:30:36] my end I met my ability Lord has come to
[1:30:41] an end I need you and the Holy Spirit my
[1:30:46] brother and sister I'll guarantee you
[1:30:48] God moves more in the sub to moving in
[1:30:51] the church than he does of the people
[1:30:52] falling over under the anointing of the
[1:30:54] Holy Ghost but we miss it because about
[1:31:01] that time we decided to take a nap I
[1:31:06] don't know why people come to church to
[1:31:08] take naps or you might think I'm being
[1:31:11] mean no I just wanna I just want to
[1:31:14] bring it right out in the open Saints I
[1:31:16] love you maybe we need to go to bed
[1:31:20] before midnight on Saturday night so
[1:31:24] when we come to the house of God we can
[1:31:25] watch for the stirring of the pool and
[1:31:28] not fall asleep oh lord help us lord
[1:31:41] help us
[1:31:45] so we see the holy spirit moving and
[1:31:46] stirring hearts see we have in the same
[1:31:49] service the same time at the pool two
[1:31:53] entirely different experiences taking
[1:31:59] place at the same time you know I often
[1:32:02] find humor when I think about this when
[1:32:04] I read it and I'll just cut right down
[1:32:06] to the barren necessity of the statement
[1:32:09] and that is those that walked out of
[1:32:11] church and one says well he called me a
[1:32:14] buzzard and the one walks right out
[1:32:16] behind him hallelujah he called me an
[1:32:19] eagle two different experiences in the
[1:32:24] same place
[1:32:26] think about the pool my brother and
[1:32:28] sister some spent years there never
[1:32:31] received their healing maybe went and
[1:32:34] and and passed away and were buried
[1:32:36] never received it and there would have
[1:32:39] been some so intent on what their hearts
[1:32:41] desire was that they with intent watch
[1:32:44] for the stirring and oh I missed it
[1:32:47] today as it were but Lord if you would
[1:32:50] so grant it tomorrow I will see the
[1:32:54] troubling of the water and I will invite
[1:32:56] you in I will be healed or my brother
[1:33:00] and sister I tell you I've missed it
[1:33:03] myself I set in a truckstop one time
[1:33:06] lonesome for home been out on the road
[1:33:09] gone and just not very happy sitting in
[1:33:13] a truck stop eating some food and
[1:33:15] waiting for a shower my shower number to
[1:33:18] be called for those of you don't have
[1:33:19] experience of that in the evening time
[1:33:21] there'll be so many trucks come in there
[1:33:23] they give you a number someone will use
[1:33:26] the shower they'll they'll clean it and
[1:33:27] another use the shower and the number
[1:33:29] will slowly come until they call your
[1:33:31] name and so sometimes you might sit
[1:33:33] there I've set in truck stops for an
[1:33:35] hour and a half you know just waiting
[1:33:37] and every 10-15 minutes somebody who's
[1:33:40] taking a shower in that particular
[1:33:41] shower and you got to wait your time and
[1:33:43] I'm sitting there and a man comes and
[1:33:45] sets in the booth across from me and
[1:33:50] this starts talking to me like I was his
[1:33:52] friend and at the time I was I'll just
[1:33:56] be honest with you I was annoyed
[1:33:58] I'm homesick I don't really want to hear
[1:34:00] about this guy who's from West Virginia
[1:34:02] and how his wife is just threatened him
[1:34:04] on the phone that she's going to divorce
[1:34:06] him and their children caught on drugs
[1:34:08] and their life is under chaos and the
[1:34:12] man pouring this all out and I'm kind of
[1:34:14] like okay I got my own problems I got my
[1:34:17] own problems I don't want to hear yours
[1:34:18] oh my brother and sister if I could have
[1:34:21] been sensitive if I could have been
[1:34:24] sensitive that something was nudging me
[1:34:27] speak to me home but you see I was so
[1:34:31] caught up in my life beside the pool and
[1:34:39] to this day it haunts me then I never
[1:34:43] spoke to him oh god if I could have been
[1:34:46] sensitive enough to realize that might
[1:34:49] have been you stirring the water and
[1:34:52] that man trying to respond and out of a
[1:34:56] hundred hundred and fifty people stuffed
[1:34:58] in a truck stop he chooses to sit down
[1:35:01] in front of me and I ignored God's
[1:35:05] origin Saints it's not a game it is not
[1:35:09] a game I can still see that man's face
[1:35:12] and I still pray Lord let that man
[1:35:15] somewhere in his life run into someone
[1:35:18] would have spoken to him Oh hallelujah
[1:35:22] my brother and sister a whole nother
[1:35:26] world had taken place I hope that other
[1:35:28] world that's living outside the edges of
[1:35:31] the pool is not called grace I hope
[1:35:34] grace is found in the pool hallelujah
[1:35:39] amen
[1:35:41] one looking for the troubling of the
[1:35:43] water you know you see when Jesus speaks
[1:35:50] to him now my brother and sister an
[1:35:52] impotent man is one without strength
[1:35:55] they have no ability to to fulfill or to
[1:36:00] do you know it's it's interesting and
[1:36:03] when you look at that one that is
[1:36:07] impotent just there there's no strength
[1:36:09] there's nothing they cannot
[1:36:11] to accomplish the goal they cannot you
[1:36:15] look at that and you realize my brother
[1:36:17] and sister that a heart's desire might
[1:36:20] be there to be in the pool but maybe a
[1:36:24] slightly misguided maybe my brother and
[1:36:27] sister as he was sitting there waiting
[1:36:30] he says sir I have no man to help me get
[1:36:34] in the pool we don't know the
[1:36:37] circumstances I'll only speak this just
[1:36:40] in context when I would have done has
[1:36:43] found me a man there would have helped
[1:36:46] me get to the edge of the pool lord if I
[1:36:52] have to fall in your presence if I have
[1:36:55] to roll into your presence if I have to
[1:36:58] be shoved as it were into your presence
[1:37:01] but he says I have no man Lord that when
[1:37:05] when the angel stirs the water and I try
[1:37:08] to get into the pool and someone would
[1:37:10] come and even try to help me someone
[1:37:12] gets there before me aren't you glad we
[1:37:15] live in a day that every heart every one
[1:37:17] that desires something from the Lord can
[1:37:19] just enter right into his presence
[1:37:20] aren't you glad the veil has been rent
[1:37:23] and were no longer waiting on the edge
[1:37:25] of a pool somewhere to find a
[1:37:27] deliverance to find something from God
[1:37:28] that we can simply come out and cry out
[1:37:31] to him and he is there to answer it oh I
[1:37:34] tell you what stirs my heart thank you
[1:37:36] lord thank you lord thank you Lord
[1:37:39] hallelujah amen he says you know I have
[1:37:41] no man amen well I'll tell you what my
[1:37:44] brother and sister we live in a day God
[1:37:46] rich in mercy I was just listening to
[1:37:48] not the other day brother branham
[1:37:50] preaching and he lays out every one of
[1:37:52] those you know what I'm talking about
[1:37:53] lays out of them but God rich in mercy
[1:37:55] and goes right into it but God rich in
[1:37:58] mercy and I tell you it strikes me but
[1:38:00] God rich in mercy we're sitting here
[1:38:03] waiting for some man right under the
[1:38:05] spirit of denomination we'll need some
[1:38:08] man to lead somewhere but God said I am
[1:38:11] gonna come and I'm gonna bring a word in
[1:38:14] your hour and I'm gonna restore
[1:38:16] everything back to its rightful position
[1:38:18] and I'm an anoint you Holy Ghost and I
[1:38:22] myself will lead you and guide you into
[1:38:24] all
[1:38:24] truth all we don't have to sit and wait
[1:38:27] for the man no longer a men the man
[1:38:29] Christ Jesus is come he's here he's on
[1:38:33] the scene hallelujah what we got to do
[1:38:36] is sit there we're no longer looking at
[1:38:39] the troubling of the water as it were to
[1:38:41] find it but Jesus Oh hallelujah he's
[1:38:44] here brother branham preach that sermon
[1:38:45] look away to Jesus we don't got to look
[1:38:48] down here in this carnal things here but
[1:38:50] we can look away to Jesus here's the
[1:38:53] answer to my need here's the answer to
[1:38:55] my situation I don't have to let my
[1:38:57] situation define me I am greater than my
[1:39:00] situation not us in our flesh but Christ
[1:39:03] in us amen Oh hallelujah
[1:39:06] see once again I already mentioned this
[1:39:08] we don't gotta wait for the man to
[1:39:10] preach the perfect sermon to stir our
[1:39:12] hearts we don't have to come and say
[1:39:14] well if I just if I'd have been the one
[1:39:17] that would say I would have presented it
[1:39:18] like this or or you know I would have I
[1:39:21] would have you know made sure that I
[1:39:24] read that quote word-for-word I wouldn't
[1:39:26] have used a paraphrase or I would you
[1:39:29] know I would have my brother sister
[1:39:30] forget that nonsense you're looking at
[1:39:33] the man why don't you look for the
[1:39:34] troubling of the water why don't you say
[1:39:36] we're all in the same game this is not
[1:39:39] us trying to deceive you but the problem
[1:39:41] is is people get to the place they're
[1:39:43] looking for what's wrong and not for
[1:39:45] what's right they're looking for the
[1:39:47] circumstance they're not looking for the
[1:39:49] deliverance and I say it's time for us
[1:39:52] to look beyond that and realize my
[1:39:54] brother and sister that God is here and
[1:39:57] God said if there's an heir I'll correct
[1:39:59] it and if the word is being presented my
[1:40:02] brother and sister that the power of God
[1:40:04] God will honor his own word the prophet
[1:40:07] of God said God's his own he doesn't
[1:40:11] need us to interpret the word and then
[1:40:13] how does he or I love this how does he
[1:40:16] interpret his word by bringing it to
[1:40:19] pass hallelujah how do I know that this
[1:40:22] message is the truth my brother and
[1:40:24] sister because it is producing exactly
[1:40:28] what the word said it would produce Amen
[1:40:31] it's not producing a denomination it's
[1:40:34] not producing a cult it's four
[1:40:36] deucing sons and daughters of god that
[1:40:39] are being washed by the water of the
[1:40:40] word by the Spirit amen no longer
[1:40:44] sitting looking for that man that will
[1:40:47] bring us all people are like well
[1:40:49] there's a man over here there's a man in
[1:40:51] India there's a man over here in Africa
[1:40:54] there's a man over here in North America
[1:40:56] there's a man in Europe my brother and
[1:40:58] sister I'm not interested I'm interested
[1:41:00] in the man Christ Jesus because that
[1:41:03] other portions you might save the word
[1:41:05] have been fulfilled the restorations
[1:41:07] been made the prophet of God said we're
[1:41:09] moving into the bride age where the
[1:41:12] bride is being brought to complete
[1:41:14] maturity and in that maturity she
[1:41:17] becomes the other part of Jesus Christ
[1:41:20] to make oh oh hallelujah hallelujah Oh
[1:41:27] makes me think of the words of the song
[1:41:30] open the eyes of my heart Lord I don't
[1:41:34] want to just hear this word my brother
[1:41:36] and sister I want to see it alive I want
[1:41:39] to see it alive in you I want to see it
[1:41:40] alive in me let the mirror of God's Word
[1:41:44] come and stir us hallelujah hallelujah
[1:41:49] Amen sister Ruth will you come you know
[1:41:54] over and over I have to admit I never
[1:41:58] read every one of the quotes there's a
[1:42:00] Myron of things he's dealing with
[1:42:02] brother Browns talking about about
[1:42:03] people you know one of them is that
[1:42:06] brother that brother is he here I'm
[1:42:12] paraphrasing us is he here
[1:42:14] and there's some response he is here
[1:42:17] okay we discount that we just that's
[1:42:19] just phraseology but you follow through
[1:42:22] that you study the quotes I didn't have
[1:42:25] time enough to go through more than
[1:42:26] about 30 or 40 of them this morning you
[1:42:30] study the quotes the prophet of God
[1:42:31] starts out my brother and sister talking
[1:42:34] about what God's going to do and then a
[1:42:36] shift in his ministry and he starts
[1:42:38] talking about he is here he is here he
[1:42:41] is here here we're not looking my
[1:42:47] brother and sister Oh people say well
[1:42:49] you believe parousia that
[1:42:51] well good I don't know how you determine
[1:42:53] it and I don't know when you got in my
[1:42:55] mind to understand what I think but if
[1:42:59] you want to call it peruse you you call
[1:43:00] it peruse you know I'm gonna call it the
[1:43:02] word and he promised I'll be with you
[1:43:04] even in you that means he's here oh but
[1:43:07] that was words good you take the words
[1:43:09] I'll take the content I don't care how
[1:43:14] you want to explain it I know what I
[1:43:15] feel I know what God's done I know what
[1:43:18] God's changed in my life I know what the
[1:43:20] focus that he's given me and I say he is
[1:43:22] here and I can look back in my life and
[1:43:24] tell you at the time you say well that's
[1:43:26] just the Holy Ghost good to find that
[1:43:27] however you want to but I can see the
[1:43:32] time in my life that it changed and I
[1:43:34] started to change but you see there was
[1:43:37] another change after I got saved and
[1:43:39] after I had the Holy Ghost there come a
[1:43:41] day that will another change and this
[1:43:43] message no longer no a message I was
[1:43:45] following the message became my life it
[1:43:51] became Who I am I thought it was
[1:43:55] interesting maybe my brother Adam would
[1:43:57] would like this I seen a little deal
[1:44:01] that said religion is when the man is in
[1:44:04] church thinking about fishing
[1:44:07] relationship with God is when a man is
[1:44:09] fishing thinking about God I thought
[1:44:12] that was lovely I don't want to have
[1:44:15] religion I don't want to be fixing my
[1:44:17] farm
[1:44:18] feeding the cows on the crops in church
[1:44:24] but I do enjoy spending a lot of time in
[1:44:27] a tractor cab thinking about God you see
[1:44:30] my brother and sister it's time for us
[1:44:32] to quit looking at all the world and
[1:44:33] start looking at the stirring of the
[1:44:35] water stirring of the presence of Holy
[1:44:38] Ghost in our life that God would have
[1:44:42] Liberty to do what he wants
[1:44:47] you see if he's not here we have to
[1:44:52] start tearing the pages out of our Bible
[1:44:55] that would be in conflict with that you
[1:44:59] go right ahead I'm not willing I'm not
[1:45:03] going to change this message to fit me
[1:45:05] I'm going to change to fit this message
[1:45:08] Oh hallelujah he's telling us to rise
[1:45:14] take up your bed and walk you know we
[1:45:19] won't get into it this morning we're
[1:45:21] finished
[1:45:22] but in just a few scriptures down Jesus
[1:45:26] comes to this man and tells you've been
[1:45:30] delivered you've been healed now go and
[1:45:34] sin no more lest something worse would
[1:45:39] come upon you you see jesus heals this
[1:45:45] man with not one even reference to him
[1:45:50] being the Messiah the Son of God
[1:45:54] anything he simply comes and hunted up
[1:45:58] that one man
[1:46:00] just like he hunted up you and I hunted
[1:46:04] up that one man come to him but you see
[1:46:08] for a Redemption to make a full circle
[1:46:10] it comes back to this man and he lays a
[1:46:15] groundwork those words were simple but
[1:46:18] you see when our eyes have been opened
[1:46:22] in our ears have been opened prophet of
[1:46:26] God clearly shows us it's right in the
[1:46:29] scripture he draws it out you see my
[1:46:32] brother and sister the redeemed they'll
[1:46:36] hear and they will see Amen you can't
[1:46:42] give it to him and you oh thank you Lord
[1:46:45] can't take it away from them
[1:46:48] but Jesus comes back to this man and
[1:46:50] tells him your he'll go and sin no more
[1:46:56] that man right there I believe in my
[1:46:59] when I read the scripture just
[1:47:01] understanding that man was a sheep might
[1:47:05] have been the only sheep in the whole
[1:47:08] porch best SATA but he'll go for one
[1:47:14] just like he come for you and I and that
[1:47:16] beautiful I thank the Lord today oh lord
[1:47:21] help us as you would come and stir the
[1:47:23] waters as it were of grace Tabernacle
[1:47:25] that we would be here watching not just
[1:47:30] going to church day in and day out
[1:47:31] that's called by rote when you do
[1:47:34] something my brother and sister the
[1:47:36] Catechism they take that I've been
[1:47:39] around it I've been around people I've
[1:47:41] been on an airplane as a matter of fact
[1:47:42] I've been on an airplane and and
[1:47:45] thunderstorms in the plane jerking
[1:47:46] around and trays flying on the floor and
[1:47:48] pop flying off of the service cart and
[1:47:50] whatever else and a lady a row up and
[1:47:53] over from us across the aisle man first
[1:47:55] thing that flies out everybody else is
[1:47:57] like trying to grab their soda pop and
[1:47:59] their crackers and whatever thing she
[1:48:01] lets her splash she's got a rosary out
[1:48:02] and she's just Mormon right what is that
[1:48:06] it's by rote she was trained that if I
[1:48:09] was going to deliver her I'll take
[1:48:11] brother on Peterson's approach they
[1:48:13] ought to be thankful we were on the
[1:48:15] plane hallelujah amen

[1:48:19] it to happen you ought to be thanking us
[1:48:21] we're on the plane with you hallelujah
