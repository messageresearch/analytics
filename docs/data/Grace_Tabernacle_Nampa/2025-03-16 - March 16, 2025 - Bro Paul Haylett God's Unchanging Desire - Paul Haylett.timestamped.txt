[40:13] prayer what what was you saying after
[40:16] the prayer often times we can put this
[40:19] with with sickness you know uh I prayed
[40:22] that God would heal me or touch my body
[40:25] but this seems to be worse than it was
[40:27] before that's not the confession that we
[40:29] should be having we we need to come to a
[40:32] place where we ask for for loved ones
[40:35] children uh uh parents um spouses we're
[40:39] asking for the Lord to come and do a
[40:41] work back up what we
[40:45] ask have faith in
[40:48] God back it up with words that show we
[40:52] have faith now we're human and I
[40:55] understand there's times that that it's
[40:57] just a human element but my brother and
[41:01] sister the prophet of God so clearly
[41:03] through the message has showed us we're
[41:06] called Beyond this human element amen th
[41:09] this is not supposed to be our control
[41:11] tower no it isn't we can acknowledge
[41:13] that you know you have an ache or a pain
[41:16] and you know you can acknowledge that
[41:18] we're getting older and things are
[41:19] getting more difficult or we we can
[41:21] acknowledge that we're taking tests and
[41:24] studying for things in in high school or
[41:27] well any level of education and it's
[41:30] hard it it it wearies us we you can
[41:33] speak those things but behind all of
[41:35] that you have to have faith in
[41:39] God and
[41:40] ultimately as it is we're talking about
[41:43] schooling talking about tests what's
[41:46] your
[41:48] confession I'm probably going to fail
[41:51] this you probably will
[41:54] yeah the Lord's going to come and meet
[41:56] me there as I take this
[41:58] test and I'm going to pass
[42:01] it you
[42:04] will because you will rise to the level
[42:08] of your
[42:10] confession that's for Natural
[42:14] Things therefore I say unto you what
[42:17] things soever ye desire When you pray
[42:21] believe that you receive them and you
[42:23] shall have them do we believe this word
[42:26] this morning amen and when you stand
[42:29] praying forgive if you have odd against
[42:32] any that your father also which is in
[42:35] heaven May forgive you your trespasses
[42:38] but if you do not forgive neither will
[42:41] your father which is in heaven forgive
[42:43] your trespasses Heavenly Father we just
[42:46] ask you to be with us this morning Lord
[42:48] just open the word Let It Be Alive
[42:51] living in US father and we can stand
[42:54] here with the confidence father that
[42:56] what you have said will come to pass we
[42:59] ask this in the name of Jesus Christ
[43:01] amen you may be
[43:03] seated now I I believe my brother and
[43:06] sister that as we are here this morning
[43:09] that uh just everyone but maybe the
[43:12] littlest of children has some form of a
[43:15] mountain that we're facing in our life
[43:19] and and we Face these mountains
[43:21] sometimes uh uh you know we we can
[43:24] buckle under the pressure of that and
[43:26] you you know it is there that uh uh you
[43:29] know we we each one experience certain
[43:32] stresses in our life and how they affect
[43:35] us because this is the way God made us
[43:37] and and if we uh uh uh hold on to those
[43:41] things you know uh as a song says cast
[43:44] all your cares unto him and you know if
[43:46] we hold on to those pretty soon the
[43:48] burden is so great it it overwhelms us
[43:52] and uh and we come here and it's time my
[43:56] brother and sister
[43:57] we are so many years beyond the prophet
[44:02] being here on the earth something in the
[44:04] 70 year range and and and it really the
[44:07] prophet of God said back then
[44:10] 1965 uh we're just waiting everything's
[44:13] in place we're just waiting for the
[44:14] coming of the Lord and so my brother and
[44:17] sister it's not the politicians and it's
[44:19] not all these things uh the Lord's not
[44:22] going to take a bride in a Rapture until
[44:24] she's completely ready now each one of
[44:27] these equations as you'll look you
[44:29] you'll find you look to what's happening
[44:31] in Israel you look to what's happening
[44:33] in all the other parts of the world uh
[44:35] look at economies and all of these
[44:38] things everything has to be in place uh
[44:41] and I I bring that as example remember
[44:43] when the prophet went to the house to
[44:45] pray for the baby and you know he gets
[44:47] ready he wants to pray for the baby
[44:49] wants to see this baby be healed but yet
[44:52] he realizes God deals with him and the
[44:54] mother-in-law is not there and then and
[44:57] when she shows up he's anxious again but
[44:59] the hat is not in the right place now
[45:02] please take what I'm saying there and
[45:04] realize that whatever is happening in
[45:06] the world uh the bride of Christ we say
[45:09] here and say well the bride must not be
[45:10] ready well my brother and sister there's
[45:12] a lot of ways to look at this maybe the
[45:14] world's not
[45:15] ready Sodom has got to come to its
[45:18] fruition and as wicked as we think the
[45:21] world is maybe sodom's not ready but
[45:24] that doesn't mean that God's not going
[45:26] to Contin continue to perfect the bride
[45:29] don't get the idea that we must not be
[45:31] ready we might have already met the
[45:34] standard in us the bride of Christ that
[45:37] God would require to take us in Rapture
[45:40] my brother and sister but that will not
[45:42] stop God from continuing to perfect this
[45:45] bride amen so while everything is there
[45:49] amen when they go for the oil when they
[45:52] when they go to occupy Jerusalem as it
[45:55] is the Temple Mount being f finished
[45:57] when we see that uh the Catholic Church
[46:00] disrupts uh Israel and the economics uh
[46:04] we see all of these things must come to
[46:06] place when God is here perfecting a
[46:09] bride and so that doesn't give us an
[46:11] excuse to sit down and say well I think
[46:13] I'm ready for the Rapture I say God
[46:16] places that desire in you that you want
[46:19] to be uh closer to him you want to be
[46:22] perfected to a greater so that we don't
[46:24] sit down and stagnate imagine if we we
[46:27] realized this morning that that we had
[46:29] met God's expectation for the Rapture
[46:32] that it would be very hard to maintain
[46:36] uh our our Readiness you might say you
[46:38] know the military that's why they train
[46:40] train train no conflict that they need
[46:42] to go to but to be ready they have to
[46:45] continue to train and God's got you and
[46:47] I here today and he wants us to be ready
[46:50] for the Rapture and he's going to
[46:52] continue to train us and sometimes
[46:55] training is actually as hard as the real
[46:59] Combat and so we look at this and
[47:01] realize today that God is uh uh bringing
[47:05] us to a place that we actually can speak
[47:08] to this mountain amen you know it won't
[47:10] do us any good if if we speak to the
[47:12] mountain but we're not prepared to speak
[47:14] to the mountain so God wants you and I
[47:17] to come to a place of trusting in Him
[47:20] and when we do that we have to recognize
[47:22] what is God's desire for you and I
[47:25] that's why we as belie Bel my brother
[47:27] and sisters should be able to come to a
[47:29] place that in good days bad days
[47:31] whatever the circumstance we would look
[47:33] to it and say you know what this is
[47:35] perfectly in God's plan even when you
[47:39] step a little out of line it's still
[47:42] perfectly in God's plan and so Satan
[47:45] would try to say you're slipping you're
[47:47] falling away you're getting lukewarm but
[47:50] God knows the cycle of humanity this not
[47:53] psychology my brother and sister this is
[47:55] how God Made You you and I and when we
[47:58] get ourselves to the place that we can
[48:00] come and actually have enough
[48:04] trust which can be tied together linked
[48:07] perfectly with faith when we have enough
[48:10] trust to just trust God for everything
[48:13] then we'll realize when a mountain comes
[48:15] in your life now often times you know I
[48:18] know I just speak for myself when I was
[48:20] young I thought they were literally
[48:22] talking about a mountain out here that
[48:24] we needed to move but most of the
[48:26] mountains are right here and right here
[48:29] and there is God coming down telling you
[48:32] when you speak to this mountain it will
[48:36] move see you can't come to
[48:39] Deliverance without the Mountain Moving
[48:41] do you realize each and everyone here
[48:43] today that God has moved a mountain in
[48:46] your life amen but we're waiting for
[48:48] something over here on the backside
[48:51] somewhere some Supernatural event as it
[48:53] is but every time you find Victory in
[48:56] Jesus Jesus Christ a mountain has moved
[48:59] and so I just not to belabor that but
[49:03] remember the prophet shows us very
[49:05] clearly how in the beginning that God
[49:07] cannot be God without worship and God
[49:09] didn't come and just say I'm looking for
[49:11] people just to worship me he actually
[49:13] was searching for Fellowship he wanted a
[49:16] wife he wanted to have someone that he
[49:18] could commune with and and as it is he's
[49:21] there and we know the first Eve fell and
[49:23] we know that Satan has come in this last
[49:26] day and has uh uh very clearly
[49:28] integrated himself into the spiritual
[49:31] world now into the religious world and
[49:34] my brother and sister God's still
[49:36] wanting fellowship and God will have
[49:38] Fellowship because he has created a
[49:41] chosen people now it's not that when I
[49:43] say to chosen people we need to
[49:46] disregard that we're talking about you
[49:48] and you and you and you we need to put
[49:51] it into the concept or or a place that
[49:54] God was looking for a bride and and when
[49:57] it come down before the foundation of
[49:59] the world he didn't say you know I I I'm
[50:02] just going to select anyone I I'm just
[50:04] going to just grab whatever as so to
[50:06] speak the star dust floats through the
[50:08] you know I I'll just grab a little here
[50:10] I'll grab a little there but you see God
[50:12] come down and says you know what I'm
[50:14] going to have a c certain circumstance
[50:16] on the earth in a certain time a certain
[50:18] season and it's going to take a certain
[50:21] personality to be able to express that
[50:24] so I'm going to place a seed into this
[50:26] this individual and that individual is
[50:28] going to come in the right time in the
[50:30] right place in the right circumstance
[50:32] and be the right personality and they're
[50:34] going to be able to come and receive the
[50:36] Holy Ghost receive the word of the hour
[50:39] and be able to fill that place that God
[50:41] said needs to be filled now God has come
[50:44] by the word and has reached out into the
[50:47] world today and I have shared this with
[50:49] the church a lot hope you don't mind one
[50:51] more time at the wide Throne judgment
[50:53] there'll be no excuse no one can appear
[50:57] at the white Throne judgment and God's
[50:58] going to say oh I guess I missed your
[51:01] circumstance so that means in the bride
[51:04] of Christ there's going to be an
[51:07] individual face every single
[51:10] circumstance of
[51:12] life
[51:14] amen and the unbeliever says I couldn't
[51:17] serve a God that could judge like that I
[51:21] couldn't serve a God that was so
[51:24] cruel but you see that's not the way God
[51:26] look looks at it God says I've placed in
[51:30] a bride the very desire for fellowship
[51:35] and she will amen she's not going to be
[51:38] hindered by any kind of form of what we
[51:41] would call sin or disability or whatever
[51:44] circumstance nothing's going to hinder
[51:47] this bride from fellowship amen that
[51:50] means that you are a unique rugged
[51:53] people that are able to stand in the age
[51:56] that we live in and overcome Can someone
[51:59] say I'm an overcomer amen because that's
[52:02] what God has created you to be that is
[52:06] his desire amen he didn't want just a
[52:09] crowds of people to to uh uh stand there
[52:13] and say oh bless God bless God and then
[52:16] leave and go do whatever they want to do
[52:17] he wants a people that want Fellowship
[52:20] he wants a people that want to worship
[52:22] him and he has them that's right amen
[52:27] and so we look at this my brother and
[52:28] sister what is
[52:32] fellowship we've heard brother Brown Put
[52:34] it out two fellows in the same
[52:37] ship let me get a little
[52:39] more
[52:43] intellectual real
[52:44] Fellowship is manifesting the word
[52:49] amen because you can put those two
[52:51] fellows in the ship and if they're not
[52:54] manifesting the word they're just two
[52:55] fellows in a ship amen so it comes down
[52:59] to the point that what God was looking
[53:01] for is a people that coming together
[53:04] with each other and coming together with
[53:06] our Lord Jesus Christ are opening up
[53:09] manifesting fellowshipping around the
[53:12] word bringing the word to pass now you
[53:14] know as well as I do when we sit down
[53:16] and talk about the word of God there is
[53:18] a presence that comes there is an
[53:21] atmosphere that changes when we talk
[53:23] about the word and so as we look at this
[53:26] we'll realize that God wanting
[53:28] Fellowship wasn't just hey how's the
[53:31] weather God wanted a people that come
[53:34] and said you know Lord your word is true
[53:37] you are faithful we just sang the songs
[53:39] that's what I was saying about the song
[53:41] service brother Alex just chose the Lord
[53:43] led him to the right songs and and see
[53:46] we're we're not there just to talk about
[53:48] the weather as it is God's there saying
[53:51] hey how is how is my bride amen and we
[53:54] take a uh uh you know Esther as an
[53:57] example you know she was just like you
[54:00] and I afraid to come before the
[54:05] king I I can't do this morai anointed
[54:09] said this is what you come into the
[54:11] world for a moment such as this it's
[54:14] time for you to stand up because you
[54:16] won't be spared just because you're
[54:19] scared that's
[54:21] right that rhymed didn't it wow
[54:26] see so we come my brother and sister
[54:28] there's got to be someone because the
[54:30] word said that they would be those
[54:32] living Epistles right read of all men
[54:35] I'm claiming that position I don't
[54:37] always do the best job of being a living
[54:39] epistle but I I'm I'm Desiring I I'm
[54:43] pressing into that because that's what
[54:45] the word says I will be and I believe
[54:47] what the word says when it's speaking of
[54:49] me and so as we're there living Epistles
[54:52] and you know these are just basic things
[54:57] Fellowship being a living epistle just
[55:00] basic things of what the Lord's Desiring
[55:02] of usen he comes along he he doesn't put
[55:05] this List of Demands that you know says
[55:08] you know once you give your heart and
[55:10] you get filled with the Holy Ghost
[55:11] you're going to face face face face
[55:13] struggle face trials all all this we as
[55:19] babies wouldn't be able to handle it we
[55:22] would burst under the pressure that's
[55:24] right but as we press
[55:27] along we move farther and we're learning
[55:30] to trust God we're facing things today
[55:34] we could not have
[55:36] faced 12 15 years ago right amen and you
[55:40] say but it seems like it's one great big
[55:42] battle well praise the lord it's one
[55:44] great big battle but we are already
[55:47] declared
[55:48] Victorious amen this is what the word
[55:50] says my brother and sister and I think
[55:53] as we're coming to a time that we need
[55:55] to understand God's desire we need to
[55:58] understand what God's expectation of us
[56:00] and you know the prophet when he was
[56:01] talking about those little hot bed
[56:04] Greenhouse flowers my brother and sister
[56:07] oh you know that's interesting brother
[56:08] Brown said that he was actually
[56:10] preaching a very deep thought to the
[56:13] bride of Christ that God's not looking
[56:14] for little hot house uh you know hot bed
[56:18] flowers he's looking for someone who's
[56:20] rugged who can stand you know uh uh the
[56:24] the the frost can stand freezing
[56:27] temperatures can stand the heat of leoda
[56:30] can stand all the trials that's what
[56:32] God's looking for he uh he hovers the
[56:35] word shows us how he he hovers the Holy
[56:38] Spirit hovers over us my brother and
[56:40] sister but that hovering is God's
[56:42] presence or fellowship with us it is not
[56:45] to keep every little temptation of leoa
[56:48] away from you God wants you to be able
[56:50] to face leod deia I don't always uh do
[56:54] such a good job myself uh I find myself
[56:56] impatient I know that some of you would
[56:58] say Amen this morning and we find
[57:01] ourselves a little little bit uh you
[57:03] know anxious a little bit of this and a
[57:05] little bit of that but what is happening
[57:07] God is changing you he is changing you
[57:10] you're not staying the same otherwise I
[57:13] would tell you if you were the same Hot
[57:16] House flower that you was years ago that
[57:19] you had withered up and blowed Away by
[57:21] now but God has made you into a rugged
[57:23] son or daughter of God because he is
[57:26] moving forward to create by the
[57:29] atmosphere our faith in God our trust in
[57:33] God Amen so we get these mountains in
[57:36] our lives and we declare them
[57:39] impossible but the word shows us that
[57:41] nothing's impossible with God so you can
[57:45] look at your mountain or you can look at
[57:47] God that's
[57:48] right and if you look at I I loved how
[57:51] that was brought out sometime back I
[57:53] think brother Isaac brought that out
[57:55] amen
[57:56] if you put your circumstance right here
[57:58] you cannot see God that's right but if
[58:01] you put God right here you can't see
[58:03] your
[58:04] circumstance so when we get God right in
[58:06] front of us front and center we don't
[58:08] even see our Mountain we will just keep
[58:11] walking and realize we have conquered
[58:13] the mountain that's right now in verse
[58:17] 24 is expressing God's desire therefore
[58:21] I say unto you whatsoever things you
[58:23] desire so God's desire is that ye would
[58:27] desire now we're not talking about
[58:29] carnal things we're not talking about
[58:31] Sin and the lust of the flesh but God is
[58:34] saying my desire is that ye would desire
[58:38] and so I say my brother and sister if
[58:40] we're going to church just to go to
[58:41] church if we're coming to church just
[58:43] because we do recognize that God sent a
[58:46] prophet if you're coming for that reason
[58:48] it won't be sufficient but if you're
[58:50] sitting here this morning because
[58:52] there's a desire in you and you are
[58:55] willing to Express that desire in other
[58:57] words put your feet in action put your
[59:00] hands in action your voice in action put
[59:02] your faith in action then God is looking
[59:05] down saying my desire is expressed amen
[59:09] amen so there it is coming before us and
[59:12] so we look at that and uh you know
[59:15] whatsoever you desire When you pray
[59:17] believe that you receive them and you
[59:19] shall have
[59:20] them does that work yes it
[59:24] does that's kind of a redundant typee
[59:27] question isn't
[59:28] it but only about a tenth of you
[59:34] responded it really should be 100%
[59:36] that's right
[59:38] right we have faith in God Amen you know
[59:42] Victory my brother and
[59:44] sister is many times more like an
[59:47] endurance race than it is you know David
[59:50] cutting the head off of Goliath that's
[59:52] exactly right we're expecting a David
[59:55] and Goliath moment in our lives in leoda
[59:58] and actually the scripture in Revelation
[1:00:01] tells us he who endures to the end now
[1:00:04] the word endure is not talking about
[1:00:07] ease and comfort and flowers and all
[1:00:09] good things the word endure is to go
[1:00:13] through hard trial that's
[1:00:17] right that's rightly
[1:00:21] right amen exactly right come on we
[1:00:25] should be able say
[1:00:27] Lord hard trial that's what it takes
[1:00:30] amen a mountain if that's what it takes
[1:00:33] dark valleys if that's what it takes I'm
[1:00:36] going to endure to the
[1:00:37] end and as we get that change in our
[1:00:41] thinking see the problem I hope youall
[1:00:43] don't get offended this morning but the
[1:00:45] problem we had we come to the message we
[1:00:47] realize it's truth it's scriptural we
[1:00:48] realize it's what God's plan is and we
[1:00:51] somehow think that coming to the message
[1:00:53] is our salvation
[1:00:59] it's
[1:01:01] actually moving through and becoming the
[1:01:04] message that's right is our Salvation
[1:01:08] that's right amen that's right it's not
[1:01:10] coming to it no it's becoming it that's
[1:01:14] that's exactly and when we become it my
[1:01:16] brother and sister then we know we have
[1:01:18] Victory amen and that's why Satan fights
[1:01:21] it so much has all kinds of opponents I
[1:01:23] won't go too far into this but just uh
[1:01:26] some interaction uh with with some uh uh
[1:01:30] uh people that were in the message you
[1:01:32] know years ago walked away two two
[1:01:35] different events on two different sides
[1:01:37] of the country in just the last couple
[1:01:41] weeks of people that were like I know
[1:01:44] this is the truth I know I need to come
[1:01:47] back I know I need to live this I know
[1:01:49] this is correct and in some cases they'd
[1:01:51] be but there's all this criticism that
[1:01:54] says this is this and this is this my
[1:01:56] brother and sister I'll tell you what
[1:01:58] the Bride of Jesus Christ will climb
[1:02:00] that mountain and Conquer it she will
[1:02:03] recognize that she is a daughter of God
[1:02:06] that she is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:02:09] and it doesn't matter how much Wikipedia
[1:02:11] it doesn't matter how many critics there
[1:02:13] are out there she will climb over that
[1:02:16] mountain and Conquer it because what she
[1:02:20] is is not defined by Wikipedia no sir
[1:02:24] amen not defined by the definitions of
[1:02:26] men who don't even have the Holy Ghost
[1:02:29] that's it that's
[1:02:30] right but we listen to them yes
[1:02:34] sir and we respond oh my I've got a
[1:02:38] giant question mark
[1:02:41] now so did
[1:02:45] Cain Cain had his own Vision version I
[1:02:49] mean of Wikipedia
[1:03:04] I'm going to preach it one of these days
[1:03:05] I just haven't got it fully fleshed out
[1:03:09] deception hidden in
[1:03:11] truth yes
[1:03:13] sir the day we live in my brother and
[1:03:15] sister they can make truth into
[1:03:18] deception right absolutely right that's
[1:03:21] why the word of God is here today and
[1:03:22] why the prophet of God said go back to
[1:03:25] the word every single time know the word
[1:03:28] forward know the word backwards and then
[1:03:31] pray about it let the Holy Spirit lead
[1:03:33] you to the correct answer cuz it's not
[1:03:36] what this man says and it's not what
[1:03:38] this man
[1:03:39] says but it's what the Holy Ghost leads
[1:03:42] to that's right see so as we do this we
[1:03:46] we see we're moving forward in verse 24
[1:03:50] as I said the word is expressing God's
[1:03:52] desire that whatever you desire now when
[1:03:55] you are filled with the Holy Ghost can
[1:03:57] you have any other desire than God's
[1:04:01] desire if we say we have the Holy Ghost
[1:04:03] and have a desire different than the
[1:04:06] holy spirit's leading the word then we
[1:04:09] don't have the Holy
[1:04:11] Ghost but there's a lot of religious
[1:04:13] people stand I I I I can I just looked
[1:04:16] into a little brief glimpse of a deal I
[1:04:19] knew it existed and it hasn't changed
[1:04:22] and you know what um for mere $33,000
[1:04:26] God's going to answer your
[1:04:29] prayers make the checks payable to
[1:04:34] me you know what
[1:04:37] sound people do it they believe that's
[1:04:40] what God's desire
[1:04:46] is my what limitations can I be just
[1:04:50] straightforward this morning what
[1:04:52] limitations have you placed on God
[1:04:56] that's it I've got a mountain that's it
[1:05:00] but what limitations have you placed on
[1:05:02] God concerning your
[1:05:04] Mountain it's time for us to wipe out
[1:05:06] all the
[1:05:08] limitations amen because the word is so
[1:05:10] straightforward says believe trust and
[1:05:14] speak too simple we can't do that it's
[1:05:19] too simple but you see my brother and
[1:05:22] sister God dwells in simplicity
[1:05:26] amen you know I I've said that at times
[1:05:29] here in the church you know brother
[1:05:30] Brown said in the sermon God in
[1:05:33] complexity and he may as well have
[1:05:35] preached it because that's what people
[1:05:36] turn it
[1:05:38] into but I toss that out to the Saints
[1:05:41] there in Sarasota or MAA
[1:05:46] City there was some of them just most
[1:05:49] dumbfounded
[1:05:51] look husbands turning to their wives and
[1:05:54] they're like
[1:05:57] and then
[1:05:58] ding
[1:06:00] busted but you see the problem is God
[1:06:03] didn't make it complex we did
[1:06:06] amen and Satan's right there dig a
[1:06:10] Little Deeper dig a Little Deeper dig a
[1:06:13] Little Deeper make it a little more
[1:06:16] complicated but God in Simplicity said
[1:06:19] only believe that's right only believe
[1:06:22] God said it believe it now and speak to
[1:06:25] your
[1:06:26] M too simple
[1:06:32] right so the required action I received
[1:06:35] a letter from the US government a few
[1:06:37] days ago and inside that letter it says
[1:06:40] uh uh there is a required
[1:06:43] action use those exact words very brief
[1:06:46] to the point required action here so now
[1:06:50] in this case I won't go into that but
[1:06:51] just the the words you know strike you
[1:06:54] um they expect
[1:06:57] response and um so here again I'm being
[1:07:00] redundant but I I feel led to be uh this
[1:07:03] requires an action you got to have faith
[1:07:05] that's it you got to believe you got to
[1:07:08] pray you got to forgive and God says
[1:07:11] I'll do it but if you don't pray you
[1:07:15] don't believe you don't forgive I won't
[1:07:18] even forgive you right boy that's pretty
[1:07:21] direct my brother and sister that seems
[1:07:22] to go against John 3:16 but and I don't
[1:07:25] care John 3:16 does not Trump the rest
[1:07:28] of the word that's right or man's
[1:07:31] interpretation of John 3:16 does not
[1:07:34] Trump the rest of the world now we see
[1:07:37] God's desire expressed in the word we'll
[1:07:39] go to First Peter here uh the second
[1:07:42] chapter and um I'm okay it says here 1
[1:07:48] Peter 2:1 wherefore laying aside all
[1:07:50] malice and all guile and hypocrisies and
[1:07:53] envies and all evil speakings
[1:07:56] as newborn
[1:07:58] babes now I don't want to sound too
[1:08:00] personal
[1:08:01] whatever we all understand that we have
[1:08:04] some babies here in the church I've got
[1:08:06] grandbabies and I literally don't want
[1:08:10] to make it sound crass but I'm going to
[1:08:13] tell you as newborn babes desire the
[1:08:16] sincere
[1:08:18] milk yeah I was holding my little
[1:08:20] grandson the other night for very brief
[1:08:23] time
[1:08:25] and he's turned his head and started
[1:08:27] trying to suck on my
[1:08:30] collar I'm not the brightest guy around
[1:08:32] but I'm like I don't think he's wanting
[1:08:35] Grandpa he's hungry amen can we get that
[1:08:40] hungry for the word yes sir we should be
[1:08:43] that hungry for the word that we're
[1:08:45] going to start searching for the word
[1:08:47] we're going to start within our limited
[1:08:49] ability turning here and turning there
[1:08:52] that we need fed amen right
[1:08:56] but instead Satan has come in leoa and
[1:08:59] he's G us a thousand distractions to
[1:09:01] feed that hunger that should have been
[1:09:03] focused to our Heavenly Father amen that
[1:09:07] baby now leave a baby bottle out of the
[1:09:09] picture that baby's not going to be
[1:09:11] satisfied with anything but nursing his
[1:09:16] mother and here we are to come and feed
[1:09:19] upon the word of God nothing's going to
[1:09:23] satisfy oh we can fill things in there
[1:09:25] my brother and sister I've seen a
[1:09:27] t-shirt recently said uh uh uh chocolate
[1:09:30] solves everything but I tell you what
[1:09:32] you won't show up the white Throne
[1:09:34] judgment with the whole world full of
[1:09:35] chocolate and it solve that problem amen
[1:09:38] so chocolate doesn't solve everything
[1:09:41] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[1:09:43] you may grow thereby
[1:09:48] amen I kind of wonder sometimes pardon
[1:09:50] me for being so straightforward but I
[1:09:53] kind of wonder if we're growing at the
[1:09:54] rate that God wants us to
[1:09:57] grow amen we're we're we're we're eating
[1:10:01] we're not completely
[1:10:02] malnutritioned but I wonder if we're
[1:10:05] where we should be that's
[1:10:07] it if so be tasted that the Lord is
[1:10:10] gracious to whom coming as unto a living
[1:10:13] Stone disallowed indeed of men but
[1:10:15] chosen of God and precious ye also he's
[1:10:19] talking to you also as Lively stones are
[1:10:22] built up a spiritual house a holy
[1:10:25] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:10:27] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[1:10:31] Christ amen see nothing else my brother
[1:10:33] and sister except what being offered is
[1:10:36] acceptable you can offer all you want if
[1:10:39] it's not acceptable you're not being
[1:10:42] built up
[1:10:49] amen I don't mean to sound harsh it's
[1:10:52] not in my heart
[1:10:56] but I think we got to break the hold of
[1:10:59] leoda yes sir we've got way too many
[1:11:03] things that we're accepting as the
[1:11:06] substitute that's exactly right amen
[1:11:11] right that's that's EXA I'll let you
[1:11:13] pray through and decide in your life I
[1:11:15] won't walk around and say I think you
[1:11:17] got this I think you got that it's not
[1:11:19] my job my job as I read in the scripture
[1:11:22] this morning is to stir up your pure
[1:11:24] mind
[1:11:25] now you want to know what God's desire
[1:11:27] to you was he didn't say you're filthy
[1:11:29] you're corrupted you're evil he said
[1:11:31] you're pure mind amen that's how God's
[1:11:34] looking is your pure mind and you should
[1:11:37] look at yourself in that same fashion
[1:11:39] amen amen so you know we're here in the
[1:11:43] house of God this morning to express
[1:11:44] this scripture we're here to put into
[1:11:47] action the message sent To Us by God
[1:11:50] that's right and and it's not to debate
[1:11:53] my brother and sister now I believe I
[1:11:55] believe in correct Doctrine I don't
[1:11:56] believe we just kind of just fumble our
[1:11:59] way through Doctrine and say well God
[1:12:01] will correct it God has corrected it
[1:12:03] it's here the correct Doctrine is been
[1:12:06] presented it's alive it's well but my
[1:12:10] brother and sister we need to come to
[1:12:13] the place that we actually can put this
[1:12:16] message into action amen that's it
[1:12:19] that's the I think the bigger problem we
[1:12:22] we are preaching on deep deep things
[1:12:25] that that people uh uh they grasp that
[1:12:28] and I I would make a kind of an
[1:12:30] assumption cuz I don't want to make a a
[1:12:33] declaration but um the deeper things
[1:12:36] that are preached I would dare to say
[1:12:38] that most Believers in the end of the
[1:12:41] day will never use
[1:12:46] it you're not going to be in the
[1:12:51] workplace and some Temptation struggle
[1:12:54] there
[1:12:58] and you're going to start quoting the
[1:12:59] seals and that's going to take your
[1:13:01] Temptation away your
[1:13:05] struggle might disagree with me and
[1:13:08] that's
[1:13:13] fine we've placed so much emphasis on on
[1:13:16] all of these things right here
[1:13:19] and there's nothing to back it up
[1:13:29] what do you mean brother Paul I meant
[1:13:31] just what I
[1:13:32] said we can quote it we can explain it
[1:13:37] where's the action yeah that's right
[1:13:40] where's the word that backs it
[1:13:45] up I'll give you a little brief Glimpse
[1:13:48] here's ago Jerry and I kids were little
[1:13:50] we were in financial financial
[1:13:53] trouble and um
[1:13:55] I knew that I knew that I had to do
[1:13:57] something different and I went and got a
[1:14:00] job working in a wood molding plant for
[1:14:02] the
[1:14:03] winter and I I went in there as just a
[1:14:07] temp the only job lower than what I had
[1:14:10] was pushing a broom and I would have
[1:14:13] been happy to push the broom because the
[1:14:15] guy leaned on it most of the time they
[1:14:17] didn't do anything about it would have
[1:14:18] been such an easy job instead as molding
[1:14:22] would come out of a a molding machine
[1:14:25] and it come out and it was cut into
[1:14:27] links and and um I had the really hard
[1:14:30] job of standing in the same exact spot
[1:14:33] for 8 hours a day grabbing the molding
[1:14:37] and putting it on a
[1:14:39] cart this what I did all day
[1:14:45] long and you'd
[1:14:47] think wow you got it made easy job
[1:14:55] until some little I'll be polite some
[1:14:58] little girl was assigned to work at that
[1:15:02] station with
[1:15:08] me an easy job turned into a hard
[1:15:14] job because by the second day she's like
[1:15:16] would you like to get a drink after
[1:15:19] work if you don't go to bars you could
[1:15:21] come to my house I'm married that
[1:15:24] doesn't matter to me
[1:15:27] I really don't want to work with you
[1:15:29] tough luck I'm
[1:15:32] here and I want to be your
[1:15:38] friend I'll tell you what you do you go
[1:15:41] lean on something over there I'll do the
[1:15:42] work just stay out of my
[1:15:45] way I tell sister Jerry my
[1:15:48] goodness what have I got myself
[1:15:51] into I need the
[1:15:53] money I go back to
[1:15:56] work finally the little girl gets the
[1:15:59] message oh she was very
[1:16:02] pretty but I'm sorry this is kind of
[1:16:04] blunt
[1:16:05] language
[1:16:07] um that is Satan zeden that's
[1:16:16] right finally one day second third day
[1:16:20] in first thing in the morning I need to
[1:16:22] use the restroom fine with me
[1:16:26] five six hours
[1:16:27] later superintendent Foreman whatever
[1:16:30] you call him comes around and goes
[1:16:31] where's your helper I say she's using
[1:16:33] the restroom I didn't say it was five or
[1:16:35] six hours ago cuz she can go hang out in
[1:16:38] the restroom if she wants I don't need
[1:16:41] her I don't want her around but you see
[1:16:44] my point being is you go try to get an
[1:16:47] honest job and Satan's already got a
[1:16:51] minion waiting for you MH
[1:16:55] yeah it happens in grocery stores it
[1:16:57] happens in whever place that you want to
[1:17:00] describe Satan's already got a minion
[1:17:03] amen waiting for you I'll tell you one
[1:17:06] last thing and concerning that little
[1:17:07] story I was working on a different
[1:17:09] machine one day and and the man says hey
[1:17:12] um what do you think of our our our our
[1:17:14] foreman our our crew leader what do you
[1:17:17] think of her and I I don't know she
[1:17:18] seems like a nice lady man she is so
[1:17:21] weird she is just over the toop weird
[1:17:24] you need to stay away from her and I was
[1:17:25] like what what's weird about her and he
[1:17:28] goes uh I I I just uh she just too weird
[1:17:31] she just over the top so I went into
[1:17:34] lunch that day they had a weird thing
[1:17:35] there where you you took two breaks you
[1:17:38] didn't really have lunch and I went into
[1:17:40] the morning break and I sat down at a
[1:17:41] table I prayed over my food started
[1:17:43] eating and this weird boss comes in and
[1:17:46] sits down pretty close to me opens up
[1:17:48] her lunchbox pulls out a Bible lays it
[1:17:50] down and starts reading her Bible and I
[1:17:53] was like there it is it is she's
[1:17:57] weird you see to Leo deia that's weird
[1:18:01] that's right but to us I just turned and
[1:18:03] I said it's probably a redundant
[1:18:05] question but are you a Christian and she
[1:18:07] says thank the Lord he saved me and uh
[1:18:11] then after that every break time she was
[1:18:13] my boss every break time we sat pretty
[1:18:16] much the same spot talked about
[1:18:18] scripture come Friday I turned in my
[1:18:21] hours that they have to sign them off to
[1:18:23] to the deal there and the man's like
[1:18:25] looking forward to it Paul I'm put in
[1:18:27] already for you to become a full-time
[1:18:28] employee and that gets you like a $4 an
[1:18:30] hour raise and I said don't bother I
[1:18:34] quit because you see I realized whatever
[1:18:38] that had in that building one Christian
[1:18:42] and 300 employees yeah and I hope you
[1:18:46] follow me it wouldn't be real correct
[1:18:49] for me to Chum up even if she was a
[1:18:53] Christian I'm like
[1:18:55] out of
[1:18:56] here you know my brother and
[1:18:59] sister the moment that God calls you to
[1:19:03] be a
[1:19:04] witness the moment that God says you
[1:19:07] know what I want you to stay with my
[1:19:13] desire sorry to be a little crasp not
[1:19:16] the desire of the world not desire for
[1:19:18] those people not desire for their life
[1:19:21] desire for him he is is our
[1:19:26] husband Lord help us to be faithful and
[1:19:28] keep that in mind now look so we got to
[1:19:32] put this message in action and and you
[1:19:34] know the thing is is the too many people
[1:19:38] have come and and they believe they're
[1:19:39] following the right thing but you see
[1:19:41] they never made The Message personal and
[1:19:44] when they come into a time and a place
[1:19:46] that they come into hard struggles they
[1:19:48] come into this time and the message is
[1:19:51] not personal my brother and sister now I
[1:19:53] I just I won't say who but just
[1:19:55] listening to a brother I respect he's
[1:19:57] actually passed away now but uh you know
[1:20:00] listening to him preach and he put it he
[1:20:02] because says you know people don't even
[1:20:04] really understand what the relationship
[1:20:07] he's meaning about the message what the
[1:20:09] relationship is because they're
[1:20:11] paralleled to the world and the world is
[1:20:13] just all giddy about oh we're standing
[1:20:16] here today you know and oh I'm getting
[1:20:19] married and this is so lovely I'm so in
[1:20:21] love and in less than three years they
[1:20:23] hate each other and standing there
[1:20:25] screaming at one another and how much
[1:20:28] they hate and never no my brother and
[1:20:30] sister this is the thing when you have a
[1:20:33] personal relationship you can never fall
[1:20:37] out of love in a personal
[1:20:40] relationship it's not what God can do
[1:20:42] for you and I it's not how beautiful the
[1:20:45] message is it is when you come down and
[1:20:47] realize the part of me that was missing
[1:20:51] is right here this is who I am I can
[1:20:54] know no more leave it than I can leave
[1:20:57] myself and when it comes to that
[1:20:59] position we can stand on that and and we
[1:21:02] we come to this place that we accept it
[1:21:04] on a personal
[1:21:07] basis and then we start to realize at
[1:21:09] that point we're now experiencing God's
[1:21:13] desire amen as long as it's a religious
[1:21:16] following that's not God's desire but
[1:21:19] it's when it becomes a personal basis
[1:21:22] that we realize I cannot live with
[1:21:24] without this amen I tell you we can quit
[1:21:28] I I I I mean I don't want to Spook

[1:21:34] being a preacher I've quit so many times
[1:21:38] and and I'm just done I'm not doing this
[1:21:40] no more and then a thought will come and
[1:21:42] I have to rush in the house or in the
[1:21:44] office and write it
[1:21:47] down you see Satan anoints that to cause
[1:21:51] it to move from a personal to an
[1:21:53] impersonal relationship in other words
[1:21:56] facts Malachi 4:5 Revelations 10 all of
[1:22:00] these things Point yes we acknowledge
[1:22:02] that is it
[1:22:05] personal are you experiencing God's
[1:22:09] desire you guys are all kind of quiet
[1:22:15] today and it must be acted on on a
[1:22:18] personal basis that's right amen I'm not
[1:22:21] throwing sister Jerry under the bus it
[1:22:24] just looks like a
[1:22:30] bus you know the other day she just made
[1:22:32] a
[1:22:34] comment that just threw me for a
[1:22:37] loop and I thought how can she say
[1:22:42] that I stopped and thought about it and
[1:22:44] I said what am I going to
[1:22:46] do so I went and hugged
[1:22:50] her end of end of conversation yep end
[1:22:55] of conflict y I thought about it
[1:22:58] literally it might even have been my own
[1:23:00] voice I heard I don't know I can either
[1:23:05] turn this into something or I can turn
[1:23:07] this into something
[1:23:09] amen and when we come to this place my
[1:23:12] brother and sister Hard Times Hard
[1:23:14] trials struggles we think God should
[1:23:17] have made it smooth before us we got a
[1:23:19] choice amen
[1:23:25] Let It Be
[1:23:26] impersonal or make it personal and
[1:23:30] personal is not insults anger throwing
[1:23:34] things personal is when you say I
[1:23:37] realize I love them more amen than
[1:23:40] anything else amen we have a personal
[1:23:44] relationship with Jesus Christ you can't
[1:23:47] be driven away from the
[1:23:50] word that's actually God's desire you
[1:23:53] are not a Hot House Christian you are
[1:23:56] Sons and Daughters of God of the Lord
[1:23:59] most high he made you rugged amen we
[1:24:02] look back through it I I can't think of
[1:24:04] quite the words of that song uh uh
[1:24:06] something on the order of uh a never
[1:24:08] promised or whatever that is you know
[1:24:11] that it'd be easy it'd be cold you'll be
[1:24:13] hot you'll be all those things if you
[1:24:15] remember what that song is I can't quite
[1:24:17] grasp the words of it but you know I'm
[1:24:20] going to say right now just for the sake
[1:24:21] of time it's time to get over your
[1:24:24] flawed human thinking amen it's time to
[1:24:28] not let our flawed thinking direct our
[1:24:31] spiritual directions that's right it's
[1:24:34] time for us to put our flawed thinking
[1:24:36] to the side and say I'm just going to
[1:24:39] blindly follow the word and people say
[1:24:41] I'll blindly follow nothing then you
[1:24:43] would not have been a disciple that's
[1:24:47] right come
[1:24:49] on any disciples here this morning amen
[1:24:54] we have to blindly follow God cuz you
[1:24:57] can't explain the
[1:25:02] cosmos you can't do it there's always a
[1:25:05] question out
[1:25:07] there why don't we embrace the Lord's
[1:25:10] desire for us now I've got to hurry
[1:25:12] along otherwise today's going to be
[1:25:14] really
[1:25:15] long if God be with us then where is all
[1:25:18] the Miracles and that sermon right there
[1:25:20] my brother and sister I've heard it more
[1:25:22] than once used as why people quit the
[1:25:25] message where is all the Miracles we're
[1:25:28] not seeing what was
[1:25:30] promised well it's interesting they're
[1:25:32] not really quitting the message they're
[1:25:33] actually quitting serving God because
[1:25:36] the message is God that's right and
[1:25:39] they're expecting miracles to be like
[1:25:41] this and when they're not like that then
[1:25:43] they're saying there's nothing happening
[1:25:45] but I'll tell you my brother and sister
[1:25:47] I've seen I I give you just a brief
[1:25:49] story if you don't mind amen h h a young
[1:25:53] man his family moved to a church and he
[1:25:55] stayed where they lived and um he was
[1:25:58] there and he met a girl at the gym now I
[1:26:02] I struggle myself with with you know
[1:26:05] message uh uh men women uh hanging out
[1:26:10] in fitness centers I honestly do I mean
[1:26:12] they have hardly a dress code there and
[1:26:14] you go in there you can say well I I'll
[1:26:16] look at the floor well you can't hardly
[1:26:18] do nothing in a place like that looking
[1:26:20] at the floor and but you know we'll look
[1:26:22] at this and and and we'll wonder what
[1:26:24] God's doing sometimes and this young
[1:26:26] man's uh meets a girl at the fitness
[1:26:28] center and they are attracted to each
[1:26:30] other and and uh even uh as the parents
[1:26:34] are back and forth moving he introduces
[1:26:36] this girl to his parents and his parents
[1:26:38] immediately go into nervous mode and um
[1:26:41] they're they're just struggling what is
[1:26:43] our son done this is a wonderful girl
[1:26:45] she's nice she's polite in a world we
[1:26:47] live in reasonbly uh modest but I tell
[1:26:50] you what happens God knows what he's
[1:26:51] doing and and he finally decides he's
[1:26:54] going to move uh to the church his
[1:26:55] parents moved to and this young lady
[1:26:58] comes to visit and she's sitting in a
[1:27:01] service and she's sitting there in a
[1:27:03] service and something took place
[1:27:05] something that you and I could not say
[1:27:08] uh uh uh you know it will or it won't
[1:27:10] you just you just don't
[1:27:12] know and at the end of this
[1:27:14] service she goes up front the minister
[1:27:17] comes down Pastor comes down and she
[1:27:19] says I believe everything you said today
[1:27:21] I want to be baptized right now
[1:27:25] right there she gave her heart to the
[1:27:30] Lord could you see that
[1:27:36] coming but we probably will doubt her
[1:27:38] experience because it just happened too
[1:27:44] simple when God does a work God does a
[1:27:48] work and the desire that was in her
[1:27:51] didn't come in that service it was there
[1:27:55] before the foundation of the world that
[1:27:58] was God's desire and how he fulfilled it
[1:28:01] well would make I think even a
[1:28:03] pastor
[1:28:07] nervous let me just put it on
[1:28:10] notice if you're going to go to fitness
[1:28:12] center workout co-ed thing please don't
[1:28:14] tell me about
[1:28:18] it that's
[1:28:22] right okay God be with us then where's
[1:28:25] all the Miracles if that isn't the
[1:28:27] picture of the church today just as soon
[1:28:29] as it gets out of one twist and right
[1:28:31] into another when it goes uh but time
[1:28:34] had come for action and that's the same
[1:28:36] now the time has come for Action the
[1:28:39] time had come when playing church had
[1:28:41] come to a halt with God there's no more
[1:28:45] playing Church H can can we hold on to
[1:28:50] that grasp that we're no more playing
[1:28:53] Church it's time come for Action amen
[1:28:57] there's no more playing church we must
[1:28:59] get down to business and I trust that
[1:29:01] the same God will place this upon the
[1:29:04] heart of the people tonight that it's
[1:29:06] time for a halt of playing Church
[1:29:09] playing religious playing righteous and
[1:29:12] now it's time for action and I was
[1:29:14] speaking this morning upon the subject
[1:29:16] of what the new birth was and how we
[1:29:18] come to it and surely that still sinks
[1:29:21] into your heart now the time has come to
[1:29:24] act upon what you know to be the truth
[1:29:27] you cannot act with faith until first
[1:29:29] you know what you're
[1:29:31] doing oh isn't that the truth this is my
[1:29:35] brother and sisters sorry to be blunt
[1:29:37] this is not good enough to say God sent
[1:29:39] a prophet you need to know what you're
[1:29:42] here for you need to know what God
[1:29:44] called you to do it's not just an
[1:29:48] acknowledgement but you need to
[1:29:51] know you got to first know what you're
[1:29:53] doing before you can have faith to do it
[1:29:56] some said to me uh said someone said to
[1:29:58] me once a noted doctor was talking about
[1:30:01] a miracle that happened among a sick
[1:30:03] person and he said preacher don't you
[1:30:04] believe if you told them people to go
[1:30:06] out and touch a tree or a pro the same
[1:30:08] thing would take place and I said no sir
[1:30:11] I said because you cannot have faith in
[1:30:13] touching a tree or a post faith is not
[1:30:17] that loose
[1:30:20] amen it's got to be based upon some
[1:30:23] noted fact you got to know something
[1:30:25] about what you're having faith in before
[1:30:27] you can have faith in it so we first
[1:30:30] must know how and what and what God's
[1:30:34] desire is
[1:30:36] amen not quoting scripture not quot and
[1:30:40] quotes that's right you must know
[1:30:46] yourself what God's plan is and how to
[1:30:49] approach God by that plan and then we
[1:30:52] can talk up boldly walk up boldly to the
[1:30:55] throne of grace and plead what the plan
[1:30:57] is promised us my brother and sister I
[1:31:00] tell you when Caleb's
[1:31:01] daughter when she come that day and ask
[1:31:04] her dad for the upper and lower pasture
[1:31:07] and the water of the upper and lower you
[1:31:09] know where her example line right there
[1:31:12] in her own father she got to watch him
[1:31:15] come one day and say where is my
[1:31:21] Mountain Caleb come and he was anointed
[1:31:24] of God and I want you to just catch this
[1:31:26] today my brother and sister here's a
[1:31:29] daughter no doubt special to Caleb but
[1:31:31] she's sitting here as it were looking up
[1:31:34] at her father and seeing her father come
[1:31:36] boldly I want to use this as a tip
[1:31:38] boldly to the throne and saying where is
[1:31:41] my Mountain where is my promised land
[1:31:45] and she something registered down in her
[1:31:47] heart and she got old enough she got
[1:31:49] married and she's there and she says I
[1:31:52] have a promise go my father are you with
[1:31:56] me has given me a promise and I have an
[1:31:59] example before me and I'm going to hold
[1:32:01] to the example because I saw God honor
[1:32:04] the example when my natural father went
[1:32:07] and claimed what was rightfully his I
[1:32:09] saw the example and it registered in my
[1:32:12] heart and now I'm a married woman and I
[1:32:15] have a promise and I'm coming now but
[1:32:18] this promise is no good without the
[1:32:21] water of the washing of the water of the
[1:32:25] word the Holy Ghost that's right and she
[1:32:28] come boldly to claim what was hers
[1:32:31] that's right amen not sitting back
[1:32:33] saying if God wants to give it to me but
[1:32:37] boldly asking amen
[1:32:42] why take this in a spiritual context she
[1:32:45] knew her father's
[1:32:48] desire it was her father's desire to
[1:32:51] give it to her more than she she even
[1:32:54] wanted it herself
[1:32:56] amen oh boy Lord help us that's right
[1:33:06] yeah first we must
[1:33:08] know that's
[1:33:10] it and what God's desire right
[1:33:16] is I'll just be blunt is it okay I'm a
[1:33:19] few days older speaking of getting older
[1:33:21] we had some of our young people had
[1:33:23] birth
[1:33:24] happy
[1:33:25] birthday just imagine what that's going
[1:33:27] to feel like for the Lord terries 40
[1:33:29] more years
[1:33:32] yeah you see you look at this and when
[1:33:36] we
[1:33:37] realize that something has to
[1:33:41] happen Saints forgive me I hope I don't
[1:33:44] sound harsh or
[1:33:46] anything we've set on the Pew quoting
[1:33:49] the quotes long enough
[1:33:52] amen it's it's time for us to start
[1:33:54] expressing God's desire right that's
[1:33:56] right it's time for us to start saying
[1:33:59] you know what if I'm a living epistle
[1:34:02] it's time for me to be a living epistle
[1:34:05] that's right amen if I am the word made
[1:34:08] flesh amen it's time for this flesh to
[1:34:11] start walking that's right amen that's
[1:34:14] right Hallelujah we can sit around and
[1:34:17] talk about it for a long time that's
[1:34:19] right but it's time for us to actually
[1:34:21] manifest it now in perfect strength by
[1:34:23] perfect weakness I'm going to be a a few
[1:34:26] minutes over so I hope yall are good
[1:34:28] we'll Rush right through
[1:34:30] this when we are insufficient ourselves
[1:34:34] that's it then we are subjects to yield
[1:34:37] to God's spirit that's exactly right as
[1:34:39] long as we think that we can do it then
[1:34:42] we can't do it but when we get to the
[1:34:45] place we know we can't do it then we
[1:34:49] yield oursel to God and he does it so
[1:34:52] then if it's trying to do it we'll fail
[1:34:56] but if we'll just yield oursel to God
[1:34:59] then God can't fail uh there's only one
[1:35:02] thing that God cannot do and that's fail
[1:35:05] he can do anything else but fail he
[1:35:07] cannot fail I think the prophet wanted
[1:35:09] to drive that home so as long as we're
[1:35:11] trying in ourselves and depending on our
[1:35:14] own abilities and so forth we'll do
[1:35:18] nothing but when we get to a place where
[1:35:20] we know we're nothing then God can use
[1:35:23] us
[1:35:24] amen the important thing one of the
[1:35:26] important things that we must
[1:35:29] Master am now remember this and
[1:35:32] especially you young preachers sir lay
[1:35:35] members alike there's one thing that
[1:35:36] we've got to master if we expect to
[1:35:39] fulfill God's desire in our
[1:35:44] life I think every one of us here this
[1:35:47] morning wants to fulfill God's desire in
[1:35:49] our life that is we have to master the
[1:35:52] thought of human
[1:35:55] ability that's it well praise God I've
[1:35:59] got a certain mountain in my life I'm
[1:36:02] going to remove that mountain I'm going
[1:36:05] to speak and the Mountain's going to go
[1:36:08] if God doesn't anoint your voice that's
[1:36:10] it the word from your mouth that
[1:36:13] Mountain's going nowhere that's exactly
[1:36:16] and people get discouraged because I've
[1:36:18] rebuked this I have done this I've
[1:36:20] experienced in my own life I've
[1:36:23] experienced I I I think I'm almost
[1:36:25] qualified to talk about it you know it
[1:36:27] comes to the point that we think we're
[1:36:29] going to get this out of here oh I I got
[1:36:31] faith enough to kick this thing out of
[1:36:32] my life and then it just remains and
[1:36:34] then we get discouraged and then it
[1:36:36] comes back and boomerangs on us and and
[1:36:38] then you look at this and you realize
[1:36:40] you know what I I was doing this I was
[1:36:42] thinking that I had enough to to do this
[1:36:46] but what God's wanting us to do is say
[1:36:48] Lord I believe this word and you said
[1:36:52] that if I would believe and I would
[1:36:54] confess and I would act upon this that
[1:36:57] the mountain would move now Lord I'm
[1:36:59] standing here believing
[1:37:02] this and maybe on the back side of that
[1:37:05] mountain one little
[1:37:09] Pebble started rolling down the mountain
[1:37:11] exactly
[1:37:12] right but in a month I guess the Lord
[1:37:16] didn't hear my
[1:37:18] prayer knowing a month it'd be the time
[1:37:20] to say Lord I believe it now more than
[1:37:22] ever that's right
[1:37:24] I believe Lord this is your
[1:37:26] word Amen brother Brown preached it in
[1:37:28] time tested Memorials of God God doesn't
[1:37:31] throw up a memorial my brother and
[1:37:32] sister with a 24-hour expiration date on
[1:37:37] it they'll
[1:37:42] Ser but as long as you're trying in
[1:37:44] ourselves dependent on our own ability
[1:37:46] so forth well we'll do nothing but when
[1:37:48] you get to a place where we know we're
[1:37:50] nothing then God can use us the
[1:37:53] important thing is one of the important
[1:37:55] things that we must Master now remember
[1:37:57] this I'm reading this again just bear
[1:37:59] with me now remember this and especially
[1:38:01] you young preachers and lay members
[1:38:03] there's one thing we've got to master if
[1:38:05] we expect to fulfill God's desire in our
[1:38:08] life that is we've got to master the
[1:38:10] thought of human
[1:38:12] ability you ever get to the spot where
[1:38:15] we think we can do it with our own
[1:38:16] intelligence our own abilities we've got
[1:38:19] to master that in such a way that we can
[1:38:22] get rid of the thing and lay it aside so
[1:38:24] that God can use us that's right am make
[1:38:27] a complete surrender we cannot use one
[1:38:30] ability youve got to make a complete
[1:38:33] surrender and come to God you've got to
[1:38:36] surrender to him both soul body Spirit
[1:38:39] everything that you are has to be
[1:38:41] surrendered to God in order that he can
[1:38:43] work his will in you and in me amen what
[1:38:47] do we looking we're looking through the
[1:38:49] prophet's words God's desire to you and
[1:38:52] I I want want you to just up and
[1:38:56] surrender
[1:38:57] everythingall give it all up oh that
[1:39:01] doesn't mean you see my brother and
[1:39:02] sister the the issue the Rich Young
[1:39:04] Ruler now maybe I'm pushing boundaries
[1:39:06] in the scripture but the Rich Young
[1:39:08] Ruler the reason he could not say yes to
[1:39:13] Jesus was as he looked out and all he
[1:39:16] had amassed by his ability that's it
[1:39:21] right now this is theorem
[1:39:23] okay this is Paul's
[1:39:25] opinion there was a man who knew how to
[1:39:27] make
[1:39:28] money knew how to Rally people around
[1:39:31] make it happen if he just said Lord I
[1:39:35] give it all to you I give up do you
[1:39:38] realize that the Lord would have used
[1:39:40] him the orphans on the corner those that
[1:39:43] were sick would have had a hospital
[1:39:45] there would have been a food bank God
[1:39:46] would have used him in a fashion like
[1:39:48] that I'm not saying exactly how it would
[1:39:50] be but that was the ability God gave him
[1:39:55] y but he was
[1:39:58] looking I did
[1:40:01] this I did
[1:40:03] this I did
[1:40:06] that and he goes further down in
[1:40:08] scriptures and says I've got so much
[1:40:11] wealth I better tear down my
[1:40:13] Barns and he thought that he was
[1:40:16] preparing himself for another season of
[1:40:20] prosperity but he come into a season
[1:40:22] that God said time for you to go home
[1:40:25] uhhuh
[1:40:27] right that's it I don't want to get
[1:40:31] sidetracked spiritual growth my brother
[1:40:34] and sister comes true spiritual growth
[1:40:38] comes when we yield to the Lord's desire
[1:40:41] for our
[1:40:46] life that's right rust is intellectual y
[1:40:49] emotional Etc amen but truth spiritual
[1:40:54] growth amen is when we lay ourself on
[1:40:56] the Altar and say Lord that's it that's
[1:41:00] right here I am that's exactly right use
[1:41:03] me

[1:41:14] according as his divine power hath given
[1:41:17] unto us all things that pertain unto
[1:41:19] life and godliness through the knowledge
[1:41:22] of him that hath called us to glory and
[1:41:24] virtue whereby are given unto us
[1:41:27] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:41:29] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:41:31] a divine nature having escaped the
[1:41:34] corruption that is in the world through
[1:41:36] lust look it our Lord's desire to you
[1:41:40] and I amen we're walking in that desire
[1:41:44] today I believe amen we walk in the word

[1:41:52] and I I want to put it to to you this
[1:41:53] way as I close sister via would you come
[1:41:56] musicians I want to put it to you this
[1:42:00] way we don't even
[1:42:04] understand God's plan for our life
[1:42:07] that's
[1:42:10] right that's right we don't even
[1:42:12] understand it we'll try to explain it
[1:42:15] we'll try to tell everyone what it
[1:42:18] is we don't understand
[1:42:21] it let go that's it and let God that's
[1:42:24] it have his way that is right ex the
[1:42:27] perfect plan of God is yours amen if you
[1:42:31] will allow him to reveal it in you that
[1:42:35] is the key right it's not what we say it
[1:42:37] is it's what he says it is amen amen his
[1:42:43] divine power has been given to us amen
[1:42:45] unto a life and
[1:42:48] godliness my brother and sister this
[1:42:51] world's not your home sir
[1:42:53] it's time for us to just let go and let
[1:42:57] God Express his desire in us what He
[1:43:01] longs to
[1:43:05] do
[1:43:08] amen one more
[1:43:10] quote thank
[1:43:12] you unwelcomed
[1:43:16] Christ Jesus said your children of the
[1:43:19] light walk in the light and you won't
[1:43:21] walk in darkness he that walks in
[1:43:24] darkness doesn't know where he's going
[1:43:26] he can't see where he's going but a man
[1:43:28] that's walking in light knows where he's
[1:43:30] going you might have a lot of stumbles
[1:43:34] but we're Homeward Bound that's one
[1:43:36] thing sure you know where you're going
[1:43:39] because you're walking in the light amen
[1:43:42] amen amen praise the Lord I hope this
[1:43:44] made sense today you know Saints we look
[1:43:48] at this and realize God's desire to us
[1:43:54] I know the thoughts I have toward
[1:43:58] you such an
[1:44:02] expression can we really trust God yes
[1:44:05] sir can
[1:44:07] yes you know the prophet made a
[1:44:10] [Music]
[1:44:12] statement it's going to take desperation
[1:44:15] yes he did to drive us into the Rapture
[1:44:17] amen right
[1:44:20] now I want to ask you
[1:44:23] is our interpretation of that
[1:44:26] quote what the prophet meant or what God
[1:44:32] meant see we don't know that's
[1:44:37] right
[1:44:40] internal drive us to desperation
[1:44:43] external drive us to
[1:44:46] desperation I think it will be both I
[1:44:49] think some God will have to use
[1:44:51] circumstance out here that's exactly
[1:44:54] some in their soul are going to say Lord
[1:44:58] I've got to be ready that's right I'm
[1:45:00] going to be ready I want to be ready
[1:45:03] Lord and they will then be expressing
[1:45:07] God's perfect desire God did not want I
[1:45:11] this is just as Paul's opinion God
[1:45:13] didn't want to have to use us a Dark Age
[1:45:16] type example to get us into desperation
[1:45:20] he wanted his word right to come come
[1:45:23] and bring us to
[1:45:26] desperation but if we're too stubborn
[1:45:28] too distracted too something or other
[1:45:31] then the Lord will use whatever it is cu
[1:45:34] you see this was a theoretical question
[1:45:37] that come out after the Dark Ages were
[1:45:40] those people that were eaten by the
[1:45:42] Lions burnt by the Flames thrown from
[1:45:44] The Cliffs fed to the wild dogs and
[1:45:49] Hogs were they really God's chosen
[1:45:55] leave it to a theologian to come up with
[1:45:57] a question like that after all we
[1:46:00] believe
[1:46:01] God and that didn't happen to
[1:46:10] us we're not in that age
[1:46:16] that's anybody have mind battle this
[1:46:18] last week yes
[1:46:21] sir maybe you're not
[1:46:25] saved cuz you had a mind battle
[1:46:28] amen or maybe it's closer to proof that
[1:46:32] you
[1:46:34] are because Satan's attacking
[1:46:38] you but I say that that sounds awkward
[1:46:41] but forget all of that mind battle no
