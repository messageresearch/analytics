[26:52] that this morning amen to know that our
[26:56] hope is not
[26:58] in economics of this world it's not in
[27:01] all of the things that the world would
[27:03] offer
[27:04] but it's in our lord jesus christ amen
[27:07] unshakeable
[27:08] the rock that can't be moved amen
[27:11] that we would be as trees planted
[27:15] by the river of living water amen
[27:18] not something that's going to pass away
[27:21] i just want to announce um well in
[27:24] advance here
[27:25] i have we haven't placed an exact time
[27:29] but july the 4th is a sunday
[27:32] and it would have been our normal
[27:35] communion time
[27:37] and instead of changing that
[27:40] erratically to a different week
[27:43] i just want to announce that we will be
[27:46] having communion here
[27:48] at the church at the tabernacle here
[27:51] at june the 3rd which is a saturday
[27:55] evening
[27:56] and so that way i just wanted to kind of
[27:59] make it nice
[28:00] as it were for those who wanted to maybe
[28:02] enjoy the fourth of july
[28:05] um as as the time if you're into
[28:08] fireworks or barbecuing or whatever and
[28:11] so that that that sunday afternoon which
[28:13] would be actually the fourth of july
[28:15] will
[28:16] be open so communion
[28:20] i wrote june 3rd down here it's july 3rd
[28:26] yes communion was a couple days ago
[28:30] no july the 3rd it'll probably be
[28:34] around we'll kind of sort this out but
[28:37] 5 6 o'clock on that
[28:41] saturday evening is it good to be in the
[28:43] house of the lord saying it's good to
[28:45] see each one of you
[28:47] amen you know
[28:51] for the yannick sister sharon did you
[28:53] get that honeymoon business all settled
[28:56] yes wonderful wonderful good to
[28:59] have that let's just go to our thought
[29:01] this evening
[29:02] or today i mean i'm not going to preach
[29:04] that long
[29:07] redemptions manifestation you know just
[29:09] stuff that
[29:10] just keeps speaking to me saints of of
[29:13] uh what was promised to us
[29:16] and it has to come to pass so we we are
[29:18] witnessing
[29:20] the very manifestation of redemption
[29:23] amen and and we're seeing it god's
[29:26] mercies
[29:27] god's grace uh we see that no man ever
[29:30] was saved because of
[29:32] his good deeds or uh kindness of his
[29:36] heart
[29:36] or those kind of things but we recognize
[29:40] and i'm taking this from a quote but we
[29:42] recognize
[29:43] it is god's tender mercy is the reason
[29:47] that we are saved today and
[29:49] and uh i just thank the lord so much
[29:52] because of his tender mercies and
[29:54] as it was here our brother isaac and his
[29:57] prayer as he's
[29:58] there how gracious our god is to us
[30:02] how many times in our life that he has
[30:06] come down and very present and uh
[30:10] we may be not even aware of that but uh
[30:13] god
[30:14] knowing who we are what we are and why
[30:16] he called us
[30:17] amen so i want to speak to you today on
[30:20] the opening of the door the closing
[30:22] of the door uh you see my brother and
[30:25] sister
[30:26] that no matter what position we take
[30:29] spiritually
[30:30] no matter what place we are in life
[30:33] there's an opening and a closing
[30:35] and so we'll see that uh
[30:38] hopefully i can lay that out to you
[30:40] clearly today let's just stand as we go
[30:43] into the word to the
[30:44] book of ephesians the first chapter and
[30:48] um very familiar scripture to us uh
[30:51] and i just pray lay a little foundation
[30:54] uh to realize once again just an
[30:57] encouragement right we have nothing new
[30:59] to offer
[31:01] but we have the word to be reminded of
[31:03] to stir up our
[31:04] pure minds and and uh you know it's
[31:07] there
[31:08] that regardless of what our situation is
[31:11] you know you can
[31:12] you know i i am a ferocious reader uh
[31:15] and sometimes that's probably a
[31:17] detriment because then you
[31:19] you read and read and read and read and
[31:21] read and
[31:22] sometimes you need to actually mow the
[31:24] lawn and take out the trash but
[31:26] um you know you look at this and we
[31:28] realize
[31:29] in the day that we're living in saints
[31:31] that that
[31:32] uh the doors that are being opened
[31:36] uh prophecy to be fulfilled right that
[31:38] door can't remain
[31:39] closed and the prophecy
[31:42] be fulfilled so so doors open in seasons
[31:46] uh and i don't mean to politicize this
[31:48] but
[31:49] i i just still struggle with the idea
[31:52] that the
[31:53] best that we as a nation could produce
[31:56] as a president is what we have now
[31:58] so you look at that and realize saints
[32:01] that within
[32:02] the world we live in uh and i mean right
[32:05] here in idaho we could take men that
[32:08] would be more qualified and do a better
[32:10] job
[32:10] but you see when the door of prophecy
[32:12] opens and
[32:13] certain things must come to pass
[32:17] do you realize it was not the citizens
[32:20] of the united states that put
[32:22] this man in the office of president
[32:25] it was almighty god and he's in that
[32:29] office to fulfill
[32:31] certain things and so we can
[32:34] we can talk about how terrible this is
[32:37] we can talk about this
[32:38] you realize you're just wasting your
[32:40] time when you get in these great
[32:41] political debates of what and why
[32:44] what we need to do is just focus that
[32:46] and say you know what my god's in
[32:47] control
[32:49] and if we this morning cannot say god is
[32:51] in control
[32:52] then we this morning should be very
[32:55] nervous you should start digging your
[32:56] bunker
[32:58] and filling it full of concrete and then
[33:00] inside that concrete shell you'll need
[33:02] guns and ammo
[33:03] and food and this and that but wait
[33:08] my god is in control
[33:13] hallelujah now it's hard sometimes i
[33:16] remember many years ago we were
[33:18] kind of shopping for a car and uh found
[33:21] this little car
[33:22] and and i was like i'm buying this and
[33:25] sister jerry just is like
[33:26] paul go home and pray about it i'm like
[33:28] honey this is such a good
[33:30] deal i'm buying it please go home and
[33:33] pray about it
[33:34] i bought the car the motor blew up about
[33:38] 30 days later
[33:42] and i was like go home and pray about it
[33:46] paul please
[33:47] paul please listen go home and pray
[33:49] about it
[33:51] and there's a whole saga that goes with
[33:53] this because we then had the motor
[33:55] rebuilt and it blew up again
[33:58] and at the end of the day you know god
[34:01] has a way you say this is horrible
[34:03] brother paul i
[34:04] i wasted so much money on this car
[34:07] saints
[34:09] and i look back on it and all god was
[34:12] doing
[34:13] paul i'm going to send you to college
[34:15] university however you want to term it
[34:17] and you're going to take a class on
[34:19] praying about things
[34:21] before you buy them i had to pay the
[34:25] tuition
[34:27] huh amen i had to pay the tuition
[34:34] but god's still in control
[34:39] you know i say this jokingly no one get
[34:41] upset
[34:42] maybe the preacher had said a hundred
[34:45] times
[34:46] before you do these things go home and
[34:48] pray about it
[34:49] but hey who listens to the preacher
[34:53] [Music]
[34:54] so how many of you have paid tuition
[35:00] yeah yeah
[35:03] ephesians the first chapter 10th verse
[35:06] then in the dispensation of the fullness
[35:09] of
[35:10] times that means
[35:14] the complete not in the beginning
[35:17] and the end the fullness of times he
[35:20] might gather together
[35:22] in one all things in christ
[35:25] both which are in heaven which are on
[35:27] earth even
[35:28] in him in whom also we have obtained
[35:32] an inheritance being predestinated
[35:34] according to the purpose of him
[35:37] who worketh all things hmm
[35:40] imagine that worketh all things after
[35:44] the counsel
[35:45] of his own will that we should be
[35:49] to the praise thank you brother isaac
[35:52] for what god laid on your heart there to
[35:55] give him glory
[35:56] give him praise give him honor today we
[35:58] don't want the rocks crying out saints
[36:00] we don't want all of nature to have to
[36:03] cry out to worship him that's our job
[36:06] that's what we were called for don't
[36:07] leave that for someone else so well
[36:10] i don't want to call attention to myself
[36:12] well i we're not about ourself
[36:14] if we're giving praise to him it's about
[36:16] him
[36:17] amen that we should be to the praise of
[36:21] his glory who first trusted in christ
[36:23] in whom ye also trusted after that
[36:27] ye heard the word of truth the gospel of
[36:30] your salvation
[36:31] in whom also after that ye believed
[36:35] you were sealed with that holy spirit
[36:38] of promise now if the lord will be
[36:41] gracious to me we'll tie
[36:43] that in here in just a few minutes
[36:46] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[36:51] now i was just studying and i just read
[36:55] a quote that put it in this context
[36:59] in the presence of almighty god
[37:02] the glorious things he has done for us
[37:06] and this is just the down payment
[37:11] this is just the foretaste
[37:18] you know many years ago saints i was
[37:21] foolish
[37:21] i hurt myself and i had surgery and
[37:26] my knee was always hurting and then the
[37:28] lord as i've testified here in this
[37:30] church the lord healed my knee
[37:32] then i was trying to act like a young
[37:34] person and we were playing volleyball at
[37:36] the park out there
[37:38] along the orchard and there's a little
[37:40] plastic box there
[37:42] and um you know i i tried to chase down
[37:46] the ball and i tripped and fell down and
[37:47] drove my knee on that plastic box
[37:50] and then my knee started hurting again
[37:53] and uh you know you're just like okay
[37:55] okay
[37:56] and then you stomp and you say but just
[37:58] a second
[37:59] my healing is already purchased i don't
[38:03] have to go back
[38:04] for another anointing of healing
[38:08] i have to lay hold of the healing that's
[38:11] already
[38:12] given me
[38:18] and then god goes on the scene once
[38:19] again
[38:21] and delivers from the pain
[38:25] and the agony of it you see my brother
[38:27] and sister it's not about what he's done
[38:30] it's about what you're going to do with
[38:32] what he's done
[38:34] there's where it comes down which is the
[38:37] earnest
[38:38] or the down payment of our inheritance
[38:40] until the redemption
[38:42] of the purchased possession
[38:45] unto the praise of his glory heavenly
[38:48] father we ask you lord this morning just
[38:50] to come and speak to our hearts and
[38:52] lord you know our prayers and father our
[38:55] desire to
[38:56] you lord and to your people just ask you
[38:59] father come and move in our midst and
[39:01] father lay the foundation there'll be
[39:04] some here today lord that are in the
[39:06] midst of a trial
[39:07] uh lord there'll be some that have just
[39:09] come out of a trial there'll be some
[39:11] that will be just going into a trial
[39:14] so lord you're always on time and you're
[39:16] always present in the stages of our
[39:18] lives and
[39:19] we ask you this morning to come and
[39:21] speak to our lives father
[39:23] let us not look at father something that
[39:25] that is about the past
[39:27] or that is about the future but let us
[39:29] look at every bit of your word
[39:31] father as applicable to us today
[39:35] father we thank you for this and ask in
[39:37] your precious name
[39:38] amen you may be seated saints
[39:42] so as we are looking here i chose this
[39:45] title i actually kind of struggled i
[39:48] have to admit to title it
[39:50] uh but if we will by god's grace come
[39:54] along and see
[39:56] that for every door that is opened
[40:00] there is a season that it is open and
[40:02] then a season will come
[40:04] that it will close and for every door
[40:07] that is closed in your life at this time
[40:09] will be closed for a season but will be
[40:12] opened and
[40:13] so we want to be cognizant of the
[40:16] seasons
[40:17] what is going on in our life now i'm
[40:20] going to take a little left-hand turn
[40:21] here so i hope you follow me for just a
[40:24] moment
[40:24] as we've been reading this scripture
[40:27] here
[40:28] it is so real to us my brother and
[40:30] sister
[40:31] or at least i should say i trust that
[40:32] it's so real to you that
[40:34] you are identified here in ephesians 1.
[40:37] this is not about someone else this is
[40:40] about god coming down and in the end
[40:42] time
[40:42] gathering together in all things in
[40:45] christ and
[40:46] and it's here my brother and sister we
[40:48] can look at what's in the heavens
[40:50] we can look at what's in earth and we
[40:52] can look at what is in him
[40:53] and we are in him and so we have
[40:56] received this inheritance
[40:58] uh and it is my brother and sister a
[41:01] very precious thing
[41:03] now sometimes there is little fusses and
[41:05] fights about what this is that and
[41:07] what's that but
[41:08] uh brother branham and there's many
[41:10] quotes so i don't think any of us here
[41:11] today will be contesting that
[41:13] but brother branham says the bible is
[41:16] our absolute
[41:17] he didn't put it off as some other thing
[41:19] as some other idea or some
[41:22] doctrine or denomination or some counsel
[41:25] and he said the bibles are absolute so
[41:28] we certainly
[41:29] want to come and sometimes people can
[41:31] take people's words just had someone the
[41:34] other day
[41:34] come to me and say now i thought you
[41:37] said this
[41:37] and this and i said yes i did say
[41:41] that and that but you missed this over
[41:44] here which
[41:45] quantified all of it so words sometimes
[41:48] can be
[41:49] taken and put around but we have the
[41:51] word of god and
[41:52] you know we're looking at this scripture
[41:55] as i said in ephesians 1 and
[41:57] we see this beautiful story of of the
[41:59] word
[42:00] coming and how it is uh given that we
[42:03] have an
[42:03] inheritance now my brother and sister
[42:05] you won you had to be named in the will
[42:08] and there had to be something to give to
[42:10] you
[42:11] for there to be an inheritance and we
[42:14] were named in the will before the
[42:15] foundation of the world when he wrote
[42:17] our name in the lamb's book of life and
[42:18] said these are all that are going to
[42:20] inherit
[42:21] my character my nature and my life
[42:24] and so we're named in the will and so
[42:27] there has to be something to give and
[42:30] you know people want to contest over
[42:32] some things and
[42:33] they might say well you know we don't
[42:35] believe the seventh seal is opened
[42:37] we we don't see that but my bible says
[42:39] that it is
[42:41] and we would see all of the things that
[42:43] come and
[42:44] i liked how brother david had put that
[42:46] and said you know
[42:48] he did not see the seventh seal as being
[42:51] a doctrine it is a biblical foundation
[42:54] not doctrine my brother and sister to be
[42:56] interpreted but it is
[42:58] the word of god and so we'll see how's
[43:01] this the
[43:01] seventh seal is what if we go and break
[43:04] it down in simplicity
[43:05] and uh my dear wife kind of put it the
[43:08] other day she said you know
[43:09] i thank the lord for certain things that
[43:11] happened because it caused us to go
[43:13] and dig into something we knew we
[43:15] believed but why and
[43:17] what was the foundation and so you look
[43:19] at that and realize the seventh seal
[43:22] is the plan of redemption now my brother
[43:25] and sister if god has opened
[43:27] up the word to bring redemption he's not
[43:30] going to
[43:30] shut the word to the believer concerning
[43:34] redemption so it was as it is for
[43:37] the world today there is a season right
[43:40] uh that god gives uh to mankind to
[43:43] receive him
[43:45] a time i will hit a scripture here in
[43:47] just a little bit to kind of lay that
[43:50] in in a foundation but we'll see my
[43:53] brother and sister if we're not careful
[43:56] we can look around us and what we start
[43:58] to do is we start to focus
[43:59] on the evil and we start to focus on
[44:03] what seems to be
[44:04] the most obvious and you look at this
[44:07] and realize that that
[44:09] things must come to pass in such a
[44:11] fashion
[44:12] that the word of god would be fulfilled
[44:15] and
[44:15] so you know we look out here and we can
[44:18] say my
[44:18] and i look on on the computer uh
[44:22] you know at the news sometimes i try
[44:24] i've tried to i kind of go in cycles and
[44:26] i try to listen uh just to kind of see
[44:29] what's going on i try not to really get
[44:31] into the depths of it
[44:32] but the statistically speaking uh
[44:36] violence in our largest cities in
[44:38] america
[44:39] is skyrocketing we have had these events
[44:42] that have taken place uh
[44:44] seemingly out of nowhere and let's
[44:46] forget about race my brother and sister
[44:48] you and i are sons and daughters
[44:50] of god it didn't divide us by our skin
[44:53] color or what continent we come from
[44:55] we are simply born of him and we'll
[44:58] return
[44:59] back to him amen so the idea
[45:02] that the race is something that even
[45:04] christians a little article this
[45:06] well even christians have to deal with
[45:09] race and racial tension
[45:11] i was like nope they're not listening to
[45:13] the word of god because
[45:14] if they are listening to the word they
[45:17] don't see
[45:18] a different color they see their brother
[45:21] they see their
[45:22] sister in christ amen and so it's there
[45:25] the scripture says that we give no
[45:27] preference to man
[45:31] and if we give no preference then we
[45:33] give no difference
[45:37] now you have to kind of look that up
[45:38] maybe to see what it is because
[45:40] you see if we're not careful we tend to
[45:43] favor that
[45:46] don't we that's how they invented the
[45:49] best friend
[45:52] they had favor over this person
[45:56] and this person i'm not saying you do
[45:59] away with the best friend but you see we
[46:00] have to be careful
[46:02] because sometimes what we think is best
[46:04] friend is not really best for us
[46:08] imagine that you got to be about 60
[46:11] years old to figure that one out
[46:16] but we look around us and what seems to
[46:17] be the most obvious is that the world is
[46:19] very wicked and very violent
[46:22] everywhere we look wickedness has
[46:24] pervaded
[46:25] everywhere we look violence has pervaded
[46:27] now look we'll go right here into
[46:29] genesis 6
[46:30] 11 and see now my brother and sister
[46:32] please don't i'm not speaking down so
[46:34] don't misunderstand me but just see if
[46:36] you can
[46:36] make a comparison to the day that we
[46:38] live in and that is here it is the earth
[46:41] also was corrupt before god and the
[46:44] earth was
[46:45] filled with violence now this was spoken
[46:48] in 2021
[46:52] well it's relevant for our day amen
[46:57] and god looked upon the earth and behold
[46:59] it was corrupt
[47:02] now i don't know how much you pay
[47:04] attention to the news
[47:06] but all you have to do is look in the
[47:08] news they're charging this
[47:09] ex-government official with this and
[47:12] this one's with this and this one's with
[47:14] that
[47:14] and this one over here laundered
[47:16] hundreds of millions
[47:17] out of his government and he hid it
[47:20] amongst his friends and
[47:21] and this one no my brother and sister
[47:23] it's corrupt
[47:24] for all flesh had corrupted his way upon
[47:27] the earth
[47:28] and god said unto noah oh okay this gets
[47:30] us back in timeline we're talking to
[47:32] noah
[47:34] the end of all flesh is come before me
[47:36] for the earth is filled with violence
[47:39] through them
[47:40] and behold i will destroy them with the
[47:43] earth
[47:44] now my brother and sister if we could
[47:46] change that and put it at the end of the
[47:48] book of revelation
[47:50] it would fit perfectly for this day but
[47:53] it has
[47:54] because it says as it was in the days of
[47:58] right it's also taken my brother and
[48:01] sister and applied directly out of this
[48:03] time
[48:04] that the earth was corrupt it was filled
[48:07] with
[48:07] all of this and violence and all of that
[48:10] and it come and god pronounced a
[48:13] judgment on it
[48:14] god said you know what i'm going to
[48:16] destroy this
[48:17] and people look at that and say well we
[48:19] we don't know
[48:20] a lot of people don't even the people
[48:22] who claim to be christians aren't sure
[48:24] that the anteluvian destruction
[48:26] actually took place and and you know if
[48:28] there's an ark we should have our hands
[48:30] on it and
[48:31] if there's this and if there's that my
[48:33] brother and sister that's fine
[48:35] we don't have to believe it but don't
[48:37] call yourself christian if you don't
[48:38] believe your bible
[48:40] amen if you don't believe your bible
[48:42] call yourself
[48:43] anything but christian
[48:48] no i'm not promoting you call yourself
[48:50] something else
[48:52] but you see christians believe the bible
[48:55] now we're going to step right here real
[48:57] quick
[48:58] and we look now oh i know what the
[49:01] problem
[49:02] is i didn't write this one down i
[49:04] realized i didn't write this down so
[49:06] luke 17 25 and 26 and then jumping to
[49:09] verse 28
[49:10] but first must he suffer many things
[49:14] and be rejected of this generation
[49:20] so there's going to take place there
[49:22] must become a rejecting
[49:25] you realize amongst college students in
[49:28] america today
[49:29] the number is escalating quickly of
[49:32] those who don't even believe
[49:35] there is a god and if there is a god
[49:37] he's not concerned with them
[49:41] it's not a number the number has been
[49:43] creeping up for years
[49:45] but now the number is escalating
[49:49] a wholesale rejection
[49:52] of jesus christ and look at this my
[49:56] brother and sister
[49:59] we've got some college students here
[50:01] some that have been to college finish
[50:03] college going to college
[50:10] we live in a world
[50:13] where families teach families
[50:17] church and serving god is optional
[50:21] a college education is mandatory
[50:26] and they start promoting that as early
[50:29] as the
[50:30] seventh and eighth grade in school you
[50:32] must go to college
[50:35] imagine america as it were that by
[50:38] sixth or seventh or eighth grade the
[50:41] teachers were standing there saying
[50:43] you need to find a church you need to
[50:45] find a group of people
[50:46] that you can gather together with have
[50:49] confidence in
[50:50] worship together what a different world
[50:53] we'd have
[50:54] but you see we reject god and embrace
[50:57] knowledge and their knowledge is
[51:00] destroying them
[51:02] because it doesn't knowledge does not
[51:04] produce character
[51:07] no matter how you look at this and where
[51:08] you go and am i against college no
[51:10] just young people please have the holy
[51:12] ghost when you go
[51:14] because they're just uh they're just a
[51:16] wicked place
[51:17] that has professor after professor that
[51:20] are now
[51:21] boldly the number is also increasing of
[51:24] the amount of professors in the united
[51:26] states that are
[51:27] boldly proclaiming their beliefs
[51:30] and it is typically anti-christian
[51:34] so they uh can boldly declare that i'm
[51:37] an
[51:37] atheist and i teach from that platform
[51:41] and no one cares but yet there's a small
[51:43] university back east where a professor
[51:46] one day and no doubt a time of um
[51:49] inspiration uh stood up and
[51:52] on the subject and said i'm a christian
[51:55] and i will teach
[51:56] this from that platform he was no longer
[51:59] a professor there
[52:00] at the end of that week because you see
[52:03] it was unacceptable for them
[52:05] to receive a man who would teach it from
[52:08] a biblical platform
[52:10] but it's also acceptable or it is
[52:13] acceptable to teach it from
[52:15] a atheistic
[52:20] but first must he suffer many things and
[52:24] be
[52:24] rejected of this generation
[52:27] as it was in the days of noah so shall
[52:31] also in the days of the son of man
[52:33] jumping in verse 28
[52:35] likewise also as it was in the days of
[52:37] lot they did eat
[52:38] they drank they bought they sold they
[52:40] planted they build it
[52:42] now you know that scripture and it goes
[52:44] on you see so we're laying a platform
[52:46] once again my brother and sister
[52:48] for genesis 6 the very judgment right is
[52:51] it not jesus christ the same yesterday
[52:53] today and forever
[52:55] so if he rejected them for their corrupt
[52:58] and violent ways they're perverse in
[53:02] ways
[53:04] then he must reject it again
[53:11] but you see we could focus on that and
[53:13] we could
[53:14] preach service after service all we'd
[53:16] have to do is watch
[53:17] fox news or or any of the other online
[53:21] type things and
[53:22] and you would always have a sermon about
[53:23] what was going wrong in the world
[53:25] but you realize saints this isn't about
[53:27] what's going wrong
[53:28] in this world it's about what's going
[53:30] right in this world right now
[53:32] you realize that god has always dwelt
[53:34] with a despised few that's scripture
[53:37] he has never been in the majority he's
[53:39] always been
[53:40] in the minority he's always been as it
[53:43] were to put it in terms the underdog
[53:46] it has always been that there is just no
[53:49] way
[53:49] people will serve god in this day take
[53:52] your fox book
[53:53] or martyrs and you read that and you
[53:56] will find my brother and sister
[53:58] that the spirit of the dark ages
[54:00] especially amongst the wealthy
[54:02] was simply go along to get along
[54:05] but my brother and sister the bride of
[54:07] jesus christ their pocketbook
[54:09] never determined their spiritual
[54:12] position
[54:13] to be richer or poor right the marriage
[54:15] vows to be richer or poorer
[54:18] sons and daughters of god also take that
[54:20] vow to the lord jesus christ
[54:22] lord if you prosper me i'll serve you
[54:24] lord if i'm in poverty
[54:26] i will serve you it is not relevant to
[54:29] what the pocketbook or the investment
[54:31] account declares and
[54:32] so many people get caught up in that
[54:34] spirit to judge things
[54:35] as i would be by those things my brother
[54:38] and sister that's not what it's about
[54:40] it doesn't matter if there's eight or
[54:42] eight hundred or eight thousand
[54:44] if the holy ghost is moving in our midst
[54:46] then it's good
[54:47] and it doesn't matter if it's eight or
[54:48] eight hundred or eight thousand if god
[54:50] is absent
[54:51] we are god we have ichabod written over
[54:54] our door
[54:55] and so god has never viewed it in that
[54:58] realm
[54:58] of numbers amen but he's always viewed
[55:01] it in the quality of those people
[55:04] and so as we look at an ever increasing
[55:06] i bring this out to you this morning
[55:08] to let you just catch a glimpse that we
[55:11] are headed back to the very things that
[55:13] brought about
[55:14] judgment in the beginning has come and
[55:17] it is right here
[55:18] we're not hiding it's not our head in
[55:20] the sand
[55:21] we recognize in the world today we are
[55:24] moving back
[55:25] into that same atmosphere and the same
[55:29] spirit that brought it then
[55:31] is here now and so it must manifest the
[55:34] very same thing
[55:35] and as you look at that we want to be
[55:38] aware we want to
[55:39] not live in fear we don't want to put
[55:42] our plans on hold i'm not going to do
[55:44] nothing because
[55:45] the lord's coming that's not right
[55:48] either that will taint your thinking
[55:50] that will taint the way you approach
[55:52] life if you try to hunker down and just
[55:54] hide out till the lord comes
[55:56] that's not living life my brother and
[55:58] sister and god
[56:00] has told us through the scripture that
[56:02] he's all about life
[56:07] amen but i want to focus on you my
[56:10] brother and sister
[56:12] i want to focus on the purchased amen as
[56:14] we go back to our
[56:16] original scripture until the redemption
[56:19] of the purchase
[56:20] possession now look i want you to
[56:22] understand as we look in this scripture
[56:25] you realize my brother and sister that
[56:27] the purchase has already taken place
[56:30] we are now just simply looking at the
[56:32] redemption
[56:34] of that the actual physical
[56:37] claiming so the purchase
[56:42] the transaction all of that has taken
[56:45] place
[56:48] we look and we see how
[56:52] it was there in the scripture that enoch
[56:58] takes a rapture takes a body change
[57:01] disappears
[57:03] i can see it now through the
[57:05] neighborhood gossip chain
[57:07] it appears enoch's left his wife and
[57:10] children
[57:12] it appears enoch abandoned his church
[57:16] and has not spoken to a single friend
[57:19] since their last prayer meeting
[57:23] i always knew there was something wrong
[57:25] with enoch
[57:33] but what's the word say enoch
[57:37] pleased god and was not
[57:41] hallelujah if we could just be
[57:45] a church full of enochs
[57:48] that we wouldn't worry about pleasing
[57:50] this person and pleasing that person and
[57:53] pleasing this person
[57:54] and we would all not just singular at
[57:57] one or two
[57:58] but all put our priority on i want to
[58:00] please god
[58:02] and if i please god i know that my life
[58:04] would be pleasing to my wife and my
[58:06] children
[58:07] i know that my life as a pastor would be
[58:09] pleasing to the church
[58:10] if i'm pleasing god and if each one of
[58:14] us was to take that position i i'll
[58:16] i'm going to be pleasing to god i know
[58:18] i'll be pleasing to my husband as a wife
[58:20] i'll be
[58:21] pleasing as a mother and children saying
[58:23] i know if i please god
[58:24] that i will be pleasing to my parents
[58:27] and i it's just
[58:28] it's just an ever uh growing
[58:31] ever-encompassing thing
[58:32] and it all starts with the idea or the
[58:35] premise of pleasing god and
[58:37] the action that it would take my brother
[58:39] and sister and you know what
[58:40] the scripture tells us that there is
[58:42] nothing that's too hard for the lord
[58:44] so if we've got the holy ghost there's
[58:47] nothing you will face
[58:48] in this life that will be too hard for
[58:51] you
[58:51] amen you don't come and say i just can't
[58:54] do that brother paul
[58:55] i can't make that sacrifice i don't
[58:57] think i can i don't think i've got it
[58:59] within me to do that
[59:00] get down get serious before god put your
[59:03] heart on the altar
[59:04] let god pick your heart up and cleanse
[59:06] it for you and put it back
[59:08] and it will be there full of strength
[59:10] and courage oh my brother and sister
[59:12] that you'll be able
[59:13] because simply the word does not lie and
[59:16] there is nothing too hard for the lord
[59:18] amen
[59:19] hallelujah so we're talking about some
[59:21] people that the word says have been
[59:23] purchased amen
[59:24] and these are a people that right here
[59:27] in this age that we live in this time
[59:29] that we live in
[59:30] are finding favor we're not going to
[59:32] speak in a future tense we're speaking
[59:34] right now
[59:35] in very present tense are finding favor
[59:38] with almighty god amen god hears their
[59:42] prayers
[59:42] god answers their prayers and that's not
[59:45] even proof my brother and sister because
[59:47] i know
[59:47] i've seen the documentation of people
[59:50] that prayed for things
[59:51] they were not necessarily spiritual
[59:54] things they were actually probably
[59:55] closer to carnal things
[59:57] and they prayed for things they prayed
[59:59] for a good car they prayed for a good
[1:00:00] house
[1:00:01] they prayed for a good job and they say
[1:00:03] well that's kind of the evidence god's
[1:00:05] hearing my prayer
[1:00:06] but my brother and sister what a real
[1:00:08] son or daughter of god desires is more
[1:00:10] of christ
[1:00:11] amen that's what ought to be at the top
[1:00:13] of our list of our prayers
[1:00:15] lord i want more like you i want you
[1:00:17] father
[1:00:18] if i don't have anything of this life
[1:00:21] right here
[1:00:22] i have to have you and if
[1:00:25] god blesses you with a good house good
[1:00:26] car good job whatever
[1:00:28] so be it but my brother and sister put
[1:00:30] that relationship with jesus christ
[1:00:32] at the top of your prayer list
[1:00:35] hallelujah
[1:00:37] but there's a people oh isn't somebody
[1:00:40] happy this morning there's a people on
[1:00:42] the earth today
[1:00:42] finding favor with god amen we're not
[1:00:45] sitting here as a bunch of people down
[1:00:47] in the mud of the trenches
[1:00:49] just go ho ho being a christian boo who
[1:00:51] is so hard
[1:00:52] i don't know if i want to do it the
[1:00:54] world's having so much fun
[1:00:55] the world is going to hell
[1:01:01] in the handbasket yeah
[1:01:06] hallelujah so what do we want to focus
[1:01:09] on my brother and sister will preach to
[1:01:11] the borderline believer
[1:01:16] but you realize the borderline believer
[1:01:17] in their present state
[1:01:19] right remember i preached room for
[1:01:20] growth here recently
[1:01:22] so we're not speaking in permanent tense
[1:01:26] but we are speaking in present tense the
[1:01:29] borderline
[1:01:30] believer
[1:01:34] is this too hard paul
[1:01:38] okay it's not definitely not the
[1:01:40] borderline believer
[1:01:42] in his present tense is sold out to
[1:01:43] laodicea
[1:01:45] he's more worried about his personal
[1:01:47] pleasure his personal comfort his
[1:01:49] personal you can name it
[1:01:51] that's what he's worried about more
[1:01:53] worried about what is going to affect me
[1:01:55] i want life as good as possible
[1:01:57] i want to be popular you know
[1:02:01] popularity didn't work so well
[1:02:12] i don't want to go down that anvil
[1:02:14] avenue
[1:02:19] imagine dad
[1:02:26] i don't want to stay here on the farm i
[1:02:28] don't want to stay here dad i don't want
[1:02:30] to be
[1:02:31] expected to go to church
[1:02:34] i don't want to be expected to have to
[1:02:36] pray and
[1:02:37] so dad can you just divvy up what would
[1:02:40] be mine and
[1:02:42] just give it to me so i could do
[1:02:46] with mine as i desire
[1:02:53] do you realize how deep of a holy
[1:02:55] ghost-filled story that
[1:02:57] really is
[1:03:01] he received that check
[1:03:04] now we're going to adjust that for
[1:03:06] inflation
[1:03:08] he got his 1.2 million dollars from his
[1:03:12] daddy
[1:03:15] he went down to the city
[1:03:18] and he was wildly popular
[1:03:22] he had more friends than he ever thought
[1:03:25] he would have
[1:03:27] until the one morning
[1:03:30] he wakes up hungry and the
[1:03:34] only thing offered to him
[1:03:37] is the husks that have been dumped
[1:03:40] to the pigs where's his friends now
[1:03:45] where's his popularity now
[1:03:49] i don't remember who the man was that we
[1:03:51] could find the quotation if we do this
[1:03:53] just come to me spontaneously here
[1:03:56] but a man was quoted many years ago
[1:03:58] making a statement
[1:03:59] if you have one true friend in your life
[1:04:02] count yourself blessed
[1:04:06] oh what a friend we have
[1:04:10] in jesus oh hallelujah
[1:04:14] right my brother and sister you'll find
[1:04:16] though
[1:04:18] you'll see i don't remember where you'll
[1:04:20] find it but you'll talk about you know
[1:04:21] brother i'm talking about life story and
[1:04:23] how they were looked down on they were
[1:04:25] scoffed and mocked and whatever
[1:04:27] degraded and yet as he's there he
[1:04:30] he he looks out and he's lonely as a
[1:04:32] young man doesn't have a friend and then
[1:04:34] he says and here i am and by god's grace
[1:04:36] all that's changed in my life all that's
[1:04:38] happened and i come here
[1:04:40] and now i have to go hide from my
[1:04:42] friends
[1:04:43] imagine so we got a correlation that
[1:04:46] you've got friends out here in the world
[1:04:47] as long as you've got money
[1:04:49] and yet here in the body of believers
[1:04:51] the family of god
[1:04:53] you'll have so many people that care and
[1:04:55] love for you that if you oh
[1:04:58] you know what the word of god is not so
[1:05:00] fulfilling
[1:05:04] do you know that some of you are looking
[1:05:07] at me like
[1:05:08] [Music]
[1:05:09] this is very suspicious
[1:05:12] very suspicious our pastor just said the
[1:05:14] word of god is not
[1:05:20] self-fulfilling
[1:05:24] the scripture says seek ye
[1:05:27] first the kingdom of god god didn't say
[1:05:31] i'll go find the kingdom for you and
[1:05:32] bring it back to you
[1:05:35] you got a seeker you got to have
[1:05:36] something in your heart
[1:05:38] the scripture says also repent
[1:05:42] another action that must be taken place
[1:05:45] god didn't just say i know they really
[1:05:46] would repent if i ask them to
[1:05:48] but i'll just say i'm just going to act
[1:05:50] like they did that's a problem we have
[1:05:52] in church sometimes
[1:05:53] we act like everyone has
[1:05:56] just got everything just right
[1:05:58] everything is good come on saints you
[1:06:00] got sin
[1:06:00] in your life you need to repent amen you
[1:06:03] want closer to god seek it
[1:06:06] you see the word of god is not
[1:06:08] self-fulfilling
[1:06:10] god wrote his word put it down in the
[1:06:12] bible for you and i
[1:06:13] to be able to take those promises apply
[1:06:16] them to our
[1:06:18] life hallelujah
[1:06:21] you know one time i bought this
[1:06:22] container of wax and i set it on the
[1:06:24] hood of my pickup
[1:06:25] and i left it there overnight and i got
[1:06:27] out in the morning and that lazy old wax
[1:06:29] had never applied itself
[1:06:34] but it promised it would save the paint
[1:06:36] on my pickup
[1:06:37] and make my pickup shine and make all
[1:06:39] the bugs this wash right off it promised
[1:06:44] that
[1:06:46] come on hallelujah
[1:06:51] now tonight put this on your nightstand
[1:06:57] and tomorrow morning you'll wake up
[1:07:00] just like you went to bed
[1:07:05] but you take this and start applying
[1:07:09] pardon the expression let's start
[1:07:11] applying
[1:07:12] right start putting on the whole armor
[1:07:15] of god
[1:07:17] and all of a sudden the word of god
[1:07:19] starts coming to pass
[1:07:20] starts fulfilling itself right in our
[1:07:23] lives right before
[1:07:25] us right in our families and and then
[1:07:27] it's a miraculous thing my brother and
[1:07:29] sister
[1:07:30] but it's not self-fulfilling it's not
[1:07:31] going to just you go to bed a sinner and
[1:07:34] wake up a saint
[1:07:35] it doesn't work that way you've got to
[1:07:37] come we're not believing in works gospel
[1:07:39] but you've got to apply the word of god
[1:07:41] to you
[1:07:43] hallelujah amen you see the borderline
[1:07:47] sold out to laodicea
[1:07:49] but there is a sold out people my
[1:07:51] brother and sister they're sold out to
[1:07:53] jesus christ
[1:07:54] hallelujah they've come to a place that
[1:07:57] they have taken and they believed the
[1:07:58] word
[1:07:59] and they said you know what of this
[1:08:01] whole world take this whole world
[1:08:03] but give me jesus amen
[1:08:07] because they're taking an action amen
[1:08:09] now we are here
[1:08:11] as i said uh take heed acts 20 28 take
[1:08:15] heed therefore unto yourselves
[1:08:16] to over the flock over which the holy
[1:08:19] ghost hath made you
[1:08:22] overseers
[1:08:24] see he's talking to the preachers right
[1:08:26] here he's talking to preachers
[1:08:29] the holy ghost made you overseers we're
[1:08:31] talking about real preachers dedicated
[1:08:33] to the church of god
[1:08:35] to the body of christ amen the overseers
[1:08:38] to feed the church of god
[1:08:43] in that interesting it says to feed them
[1:08:45] not fleece them
[1:08:48] it says feed them not boss them around
[1:08:51] feed them not extort them feed them not
[1:08:55] control them
[1:08:58] oh praise god there's still some real
[1:08:59] preachers on the earth
[1:09:01] all they care about is seeing some happy
[1:09:03] sheep some saints of god
[1:09:05] that are feeding on the word of god but
[1:09:07] look at this my brother and sister
[1:09:09] this last line right here is what really
[1:09:11] i focus to
[1:09:12] which he hath purchased it don't belong
[1:09:15] to the preacher
[1:09:16] it don't belong to the church it belongs
[1:09:19] to jesus christ
[1:09:20] he's the one that purchased them
[1:09:23] hallelujah
[1:09:25] with his own blood so there there we
[1:09:28] have this foundational
[1:09:30] laid out so we look my brother and
[1:09:32] sister and realize we've already been
[1:09:33] purchased
[1:09:35] amen now it's time to show
[1:09:38] what the lord jesus christ bought
[1:09:44] what did he buy did he buy a church full
[1:09:47] of lukewarm people
[1:09:49] he did not did he buy a church full of
[1:09:52] unbelievers only long enough for them to
[1:09:55] be revealed
[1:09:56] as real believers hallelujah you see he
[1:10:00] didn't buy
[1:10:00] a church he bought a people
[1:10:04] amen so it's there what is it now
[1:10:07] all we can do my brother and sister if
[1:10:08] we sit here today and say you know what
[1:10:10] yeah i've been purchased can can we say
[1:10:12] that let me let me back
[1:10:13] up here i'm getting ahead of myself a
[1:10:15] little bit can we say i've been
[1:10:17] purchased by his own blood
[1:10:19] amen so if he has already
[1:10:22] purchased you and i if he has already uh
[1:10:25] laid this claim out before us then you
[1:10:28] know what that means
[1:10:29] it means you are sold out it means
[1:10:32] you're not for sale again
[1:10:34] just had some guy calling you know it's
[1:10:36] the thing that's the rage now you know
[1:10:38] they just call your house
[1:10:39] at dinner time uh you own this will you
[1:10:42] sell it to us
[1:10:43] and i i at first would be just like
[1:10:45] don't bug me is there a for sale sign
[1:10:47] and i'm i'm like what are you thinking
[1:10:48] paul
[1:10:50] yes sir it's for sale
[1:10:53] oh well mr haylett we would really like
[1:10:55] to buy that from you
[1:10:56] i said yes the first 7.4 million
[1:11:00] can have it
[1:11:03] i said don't even bother doing the math
[1:11:06] you're not willing to pay the price
[1:11:09] i mean i would sell them a farm if they
[1:11:12] gave me a hundred and fifty thousand
[1:11:13] dollars an acre for it
[1:11:16] i mean wow
[1:11:20] but you see my brother and sister when
[1:11:22] you've been purchased
[1:11:25] you're no longer for sale
[1:11:30] hallelujah you see or jesus christ is
[1:11:33] not a real estate broker
[1:11:36] he doesn't pick you up here and offer
[1:11:38] you somewhere else for slightly
[1:11:41] more he's kind of
[1:11:46] i don't know how do i word this i hope
[1:11:49] you don't
[1:11:50] mind that i feel a little light-hearted
[1:11:52] this morning
[1:11:54] but he's just one of those people that
[1:11:56] just
[1:11:58] oh i know what some of you call it he's
[1:12:00] a hoarder
[1:12:03] he has collected of such a body of
[1:12:07] believers
[1:12:08] and he's not letting go of a single
[1:12:12] one oh it doesn't get your heart excited
[1:12:16] amen i mean wouldn't that just just
[1:12:19] break your heart to get up one morning
[1:12:20] and realize that god
[1:12:22] had put a for sale sign on you
[1:12:25] no no see
[1:12:28] now's the season as i already said to
[1:12:30] show what he bought
[1:12:31] we are here my brother and sister
[1:12:33] purchased of his own precious blood
[1:12:35] and i so love him for purchasing me i so
[1:12:38] love him for giving his own blood for me
[1:12:41] that i'm gonna show the world the value
[1:12:44] of the blood
[1:12:45] that was given for me hallelujah it is
[1:12:47] also if you would call it
[1:12:49] now i'm a person and i know it's a
[1:12:51] figure of speech but don't misunderstand
[1:12:53] me
[1:12:53] i'm a person that believes in having
[1:12:55] pride because if we don't have
[1:12:57] a measure of pride we become slobs
[1:13:02] so god didn't want you to be prideless
[1:13:04] he didn't want you to just be debased to
[1:13:06] the point that you don't care if you
[1:13:08] brush your teeth
[1:13:08] comb your hair or wear clean clothes no
[1:13:11] sir
[1:13:12] this bride of jesus christ has
[1:13:14] recognized the value of the blood of
[1:13:17] jesus christ
[1:13:18] and when she recognized that value she
[1:13:21] said
[1:13:21] i'm going to live up to what he paid for
[1:13:24] me
[1:13:24] i'm going to live up to the value he
[1:13:27] placed on me
[1:13:28] he said i'm a son he said i'm a daughter
[1:13:31] he said i'm a jewel
[1:13:33] he said i am a treasure oh hallelujah
[1:13:36] and i'm going to live up to his
[1:13:38] expectation
[1:13:40] oh praise the lord praise the lord
[1:13:43] hallelujah
[1:13:45] now look my brother and sister not
[1:13:47] everyone
[1:13:48] thinks that they have sold out not
[1:13:51] everyone
[1:13:52] some think they can come now pardon my
[1:13:55] words
[1:13:56] but some think they can come to church
[1:13:58] and make love to jesus christ
[1:14:00] and go right out here and make love to
[1:14:02] the devil
[1:14:04] no problem god help us
[1:14:07] we're not placing much value on the
[1:14:09] blood and i'll tell you what
[1:14:11] you go into the parable and you can see
[1:14:13] right there my brother and sister
[1:14:15] that when it come time amen to pay a
[1:14:18] price
[1:14:22] the near kinsman redeemer
[1:14:25] you know the one the word says was
[1:14:27] closer than jesus christ
[1:14:30] this is why we were born in sin shaped
[1:14:32] in iniquity
[1:14:35] and he said i'm not laying down my life
[1:14:41] it might mar my inheritance you know why
[1:14:45] one thing lucifer didn't have was a
[1:14:47] revelation
[1:14:49] of eternal life he was
[1:14:54] excuse me he was there going if i lay my
[1:14:56] life down
[1:14:57] will i be able to raise it up
[1:15:03] i'm not marrying my inheritance for them
[1:15:08] so what i'll do instead instead of
[1:15:10] paying the price for them
[1:15:13] boaz what'd he do it was a custom of the
[1:15:14] day
[1:15:16] took his shoe off put it right there
[1:15:21] and it become the token of the evidence
[1:15:23] that everything he had
[1:15:25] research a little bit if you have time
[1:15:28] if you don't take the time just trust me
[1:15:30] it's right there in the scripture took
[1:15:32] the shoe off and when he placed that
[1:15:34] shoe he was promising
[1:15:36] everything he had to back up
[1:15:39] this vow this promise
[1:15:43] isn't that amazing hallelujah
[1:15:47] you know i've spoke to the church here
[1:15:49] about about that time or two trying to
[1:15:50] make a point
[1:15:51] now look you can have a mortgage on your
[1:15:53] house and you sign that and times got
[1:15:55] tough
[1:15:55] i mean like really tough and it fell
[1:15:57] apart they just come and take your house
[1:15:58] from you
[1:15:59] but when you sign your name and your
[1:16:02] name is ensuring that no matter what and
[1:16:04] what you possess
[1:16:06] will fulfill this obligation they don't
[1:16:08] just come take your house they come and
[1:16:10] take your car
[1:16:10] you'll pick up this and that and that
[1:16:12] and that and that until they're
[1:16:14] satisfied
[1:16:15] my brother and sister the lord jesus
[1:16:16] christ said no my blood will be
[1:16:19] sufficient you notice he didn't have to
[1:16:20] offer any other price
[1:16:22] for our redemption but his blood his
[1:16:24] blood had such value
[1:16:26] he knew that when he gave his blood for
[1:16:29] you and i
[1:16:30] it would cover every sin every unbelief
[1:16:33] every factor of our life
[1:16:35] for now until we are redeemed and gone
[1:16:38] in a rapture
[1:16:39] he didn't have to say i'll give another
[1:16:41] and if i need more i'll come and give
[1:16:43] more
[1:16:43] if there's another i can do no my
[1:16:45] brother and sister
[1:16:46] he said i'll shake heavens and earth for
[1:16:49] my little bride
[1:16:50] i'll shake heavens and earth because
[1:16:52] i've already bought them
[1:16:54] they're mine and they are the purchased
[1:16:57] possession
[1:17:00] hallelujah oh i tell you what this ought
[1:17:03] to make us walk out of here today with
[1:17:05] our shoulders back
[1:17:06] saying thank you lord i'm worth more
[1:17:08] than i thought i was worth
[1:17:10] hallelujah now look i want you to
[1:17:13] understand this warfare it goes on right
[1:17:15] the devil he's always trying to make
[1:17:17] us look like we have no value make us
[1:17:20] feel
[1:17:21] oh feelings why did i bring up
[1:17:24] feelings why did i
[1:17:28] bring up feelings
[1:17:32] i told jerry this morning i feel so
[1:17:34] tired
[1:17:35] if i wasn't the pastor i would stay home
[1:17:38] and stream
[1:17:39] today
[1:17:42] feelings
[1:17:49] look what the devil's doing all the time
[1:17:50] he's trying to get you to feel like
[1:17:52] you're not worthy
[1:17:54] can you show me one place in the
[1:17:56] scripture that the redeemed
[1:17:59] are ever declared unworthy
[1:18:02] can you show me one place where the
[1:18:04] redeemed are ever declared
[1:18:06] unrighteous or unholy
[1:18:10] no my brother and sister the word shows
[1:18:12] us quite clearly
[1:18:13] that when he said you will be righteous
[1:18:17] because i am righteous you will be holy
[1:18:21] because i
[1:18:22] am holy you will be redeemed because i
[1:18:26] am the redeemer he didn't say how you
[1:18:30] feel about it but you see the devil's
[1:18:32] constantly trying to
[1:18:33] get the feelings in there get the
[1:18:35] feelings in there
[1:18:36] hallelujah amen
[1:18:43] shut off the transparency app paul
[1:18:47] you realize the one who bought judas
[1:18:51] is the same one who bought elvis
[1:18:56] thirty pieces of silver is all judas
[1:18:59] needed
[1:19:01] a fleet of cadillacs and a hundred
[1:19:04] million dollars is what it took to buy
[1:19:06] elvis boy inflation's a terrible thing
[1:19:11] but i want you to look at this judas's
[1:19:14] world
[1:19:15] of influence his sphere of influence
[1:19:19] was quite small
[1:19:22] and elvis with a gift
[1:19:26] the devil looked at the potential and
[1:19:29] said
[1:19:30] i'm willing to invest millions
[1:19:33] into this one because his life
[1:19:37] will impact millions
[1:19:44] is elvis's sin any greater than judas
[1:19:48] no sin is sin
[1:19:52] but look at this this ought to make
[1:19:55] somebody happy this morning the same one
[1:19:57] who bought
[1:19:59] purchased the 120 in the upper room
[1:20:03] is the same one who bought purchase
[1:20:06] the bride of this day hallelujah
[1:20:11] 120 became
[1:20:14] as it were millions my brother and
[1:20:15] sister in 120 in an upper
[1:20:18] room god said you know what i purchased
[1:20:20] them
[1:20:21] and they will have an impact on the
[1:20:23] whole world
[1:20:24] and i'm going to purchase a bride in the
[1:20:26] last day
[1:20:28] amen and she's going to impact a whole
[1:20:30] world
[1:20:31] and you know what he paid the exact same
[1:20:34] price
[1:20:35] for a hundred and twenty as he has paid
[1:20:37] for millions
[1:20:39] because the value of the blood of jesus
[1:20:41] christ
[1:20:42] was more than sufficient he said my
[1:20:45] grace is
[1:20:46] sufficient hallelujah
[1:20:49] hallelujah oh my
[1:20:52] i'll tell you i just i can't help it i
[1:20:55] get excited about this when i
[1:20:57] i feel like god didn't come and say you
[1:20:59] know paul haylett
[1:21:00] you being not so much i'm just going to
[1:21:02] give just a little bit for you
[1:21:04] and the apostle paul the other paul that
[1:21:06] i have in my life
[1:21:07] the apostle paul oh look at the impact
[1:21:10] he had
[1:21:11] i'm going to pay a greater price for him
[1:21:14] no my brother and sister his blood was
[1:21:16] sufficient
[1:21:17] and his blood is sufficient hallelujah
[1:21:20] we don't have to go look for another
[1:21:22] add-on
[1:21:23] we don't have to have penance we don't
[1:21:24] have to have some kind of servitude we
[1:21:26] don't have to have any other add-on to
[1:21:28] it the blood is sufficient
[1:21:30] oh hallelujah i think that ought to get
[1:21:33] somebody excited this morning
[1:21:35] god paid full price for me now there's a
[1:21:39] downside of that and the devil will
[1:21:40] remind you that yeah you had a lot of
[1:21:42] sin to pay for
[1:21:44] you had a lot of sin to pay for ah
[1:21:49] we ain't murdered nobody i won't send
[1:21:52] anybody to prison
[1:21:54] so i think the apostle paul had a
[1:21:56] greater debt
[1:21:59] i hope you didn't agree with me
[1:22:04] the lost is lost the redeemed
[1:22:07] is redeemed the blood is sufficient
[1:22:12] the price was paid willingly
[1:22:17] not grudgingly now look saints if you
[1:22:19] have a grudging christian spirit on you
[1:22:22] this morning
[1:22:23] i want you just to bow your head in your
[1:22:24] heart right here this morning
[1:22:26] and ask god to forgive you there should
[1:22:28] be nothing
[1:22:29] grudging in your life god called you
[1:22:32] you say but brother paul our life is
[1:22:34] difficult well that's right and my heart
[1:22:36] goes out to those people
[1:22:38] who done but my brother and sister some
[1:22:40] people's battle is in the flesh
[1:22:41] as in laboring and struggling to live
[1:22:44] some it's in the flesh being burnt up
[1:22:46] with the lust of the flesh and pride of
[1:22:47] life
[1:22:48] some people's greatest battle is right
[1:22:50] here in their mind
[1:22:51] and they struggle over and over on that
[1:22:53] same battle
[1:22:54] my brother and sister there's no one
[1:22:56] going to get out of here without
[1:22:58] battle scars no one's going to get out
[1:23:00] of here with a free pass go past 200
[1:23:02] collect the reward
[1:23:03] my brother and sister every one of you
[1:23:05] will fight for everything that you want
[1:23:08] everything you desire as a son or
[1:23:09] daughter of god you're going to fight
[1:23:11] for it
[1:23:11] and that's why i say and once again go
[1:23:14] back to reiterate that
[1:23:15] the word of god is not self-fulfilling
[1:23:19] you will fight for every promise
[1:23:22] that you see and believe and confess
[1:23:25] in the word of god and you might as well
[1:23:27] get rid of that grudging christian
[1:23:29] spirit
[1:23:30] of woe unto me and stand up and say
[1:23:33] the blood of jesus christ has redeemed
[1:23:35] me and my
[1:23:37] life will become his life and his life
[1:23:40] will be my life
[1:23:41] and i will stand and show the world that
[1:23:44] serving jesus christ
[1:23:45] is worth it not that grudging woe
[1:23:49] unto me spirit that's the devil in
[1:23:51] disguise
[1:23:52] why because you'll have low expectation
[1:23:56] and low result and then you won't blame
[1:23:59] it on you
[1:24:00] i did all i could do that's right
[1:24:04] but you didn't do all he could do
[1:24:07] through you there's the difference
[1:24:11] you got to open up let go and let god
[1:24:15] are we doing all right hallelujah
[1:24:18] somebody stole the time already amen
[1:24:22] now look
[1:24:26] door open door closed
[1:24:30] now look at this here i hope are are you
[1:24:32] following me
[1:24:34] sometimes you know see we put we put
[1:24:36] thoughts that have been rattling around
[1:24:37] in our head and our heart and notes and
[1:24:39] whatever
[1:24:39] you know from from days and weeks and
[1:24:41] whatever and put them all together here
[1:24:43] and well in the early hours of the day
[1:24:46] or late hours of the night or whatever
[1:24:47] it all makes perfect sense to me
[1:24:50] but i don't know that it does to you now
[1:24:53] look
[1:24:53] then this person that was did not want
[1:24:56] now talk about the jubilee
[1:24:58] did not want to go free could had to be
[1:25:00] sealed
[1:25:02] now you're going to understand i hope by
[1:25:04] god's grace here why i'm talking about a
[1:25:05] door opener door closed
[1:25:09] did not want to go free could had to be
[1:25:12] sealed
[1:25:12] a beautiful type today of the sealing of
[1:25:14] god or the marking
[1:25:16] of the beast which has been so much
[1:25:19] disputed now let's just dispute that for
[1:25:22] a minute
[1:25:23] my brother and sister look in the world
[1:25:24] we got today
[1:25:26] you don't have to look very far out here
[1:25:28] in the world
[1:25:29] i'm going to call it social media even
[1:25:30] though i really don't do social media
[1:25:33] but you know bill gates is the
[1:25:35] antichrist
[1:25:39] barack obama was the antichrist and
[1:25:42] george bush was the antichrist and
[1:25:44] this person's the antichrist and this is
[1:25:46] the antichrist
[1:25:48] you know why they're doing that because
[1:25:50] they're standing
[1:25:51] like way too far from the dartboard
[1:25:55] and they're going there's got to be
[1:25:56] antichrist
[1:26:02] oh my neighbor
[1:26:09] come on they don't have a clue it's the
[1:26:10] reason you understand what they're doing
[1:26:12] the old phrase they're fishing in the
[1:26:14] dark and you can catch something fishing
[1:26:16] in the dark if you bait the hook
[1:26:19] but they're not even beating the hook so
[1:26:20] they don't have a clue the world today
[1:26:22] all over go on youtube go all over the
[1:26:24] social media
[1:26:24] go all over the internet and look at
[1:26:26] what the antichrist what the answer here
[1:26:28] is what
[1:26:29] what does the bible say it's not too
[1:26:31] hard it's on seven hills
[1:26:33] trace its roots right back to the dragon
[1:26:36] it's not too hard but you see
[1:26:38] if your eyes can't see and your ears
[1:26:40] can't hear
[1:26:41] and you cannot understand
[1:26:44] it's hid from them it should be really
[1:26:47] obvious my brother and sister you've
[1:26:49] been blessed of god
[1:26:50] to see so look at this
[1:26:55] this much disputed the people have you
[1:26:58] ever noticed let me throw this in
[1:26:59] have you ever noticed the people they
[1:27:01] hate
[1:27:02] or the antichrist and the people they
[1:27:06] like
[1:27:07] always have the holy ghost
[1:27:11] human nature but i tell you what it is
[1:27:15] if you're for the word believe the word
[1:27:17] confess the word live the word
[1:27:19] or you dispute the word push away from
[1:27:21] the word
[1:27:24] imagine
[1:27:28] what it was now faith cometh by hearing
[1:27:30] hearing of the word of god
[1:27:32] and when we hear that we are free
[1:27:36] and refuse to act upon our freedom
[1:27:44] hmm
[1:27:51] did you hear
[1:27:54] yeah i heard
[1:27:57] it's jubilee season
[1:28:01] i know but i'm comfortable
[1:28:05] i've been a deacon in our church for 20
[1:28:07] years
[1:28:08] i have a good job and i've got
[1:28:10] retirement i've got a house and
[1:28:14] i just wanted to stay like it is
[1:28:17] i'm comfortable here
[1:28:31] do you go there or not paul
[1:28:36] another day excuse me i'm just
[1:28:40] holding a conversation with myself
[1:28:44] and when we hear that we are free
[1:28:48] and refuse to act upon our freedom
[1:28:51] then we will be sealed to my
[1:28:54] opinion to be sealed away from god
[1:28:58] is to receive the mark of the beast
[1:29:01] for to hear is to receive and when we
[1:29:04] hear that we are free
[1:29:05] then we can accept it and be free and
[1:29:08] when the hearer heard the jubilee sound
[1:29:11] and if he didn't want to be free come on
[1:29:14] saints there ought to be something
[1:29:15] rejoicing in your heart
[1:29:17] that god put down in you the desire i
[1:29:20] will be free hallelujah i will break
[1:29:24] away from those things those chains
[1:29:27] they've been cut i am free
[1:29:31] oh hallelujah and when we hear that we
[1:29:35] are free then we can accept it and be
[1:29:38] free do you realize it's all up to you
[1:29:40] the word of god's not gonna come down
[1:29:42] here and it's not gonna force you
[1:29:44] to live in a liberty in jesus christ
[1:29:47] he's not gonna force you
[1:29:49] to leave the spirits that have bound you
[1:29:51] and left you unhappy
[1:29:52] he's not going to force that off of you
[1:29:55] you've got to stop and say
[1:29:56] it's the year of jubilee i've heard the
[1:29:59] word and the word said
[1:30:01] i am free and he who is free is free
[1:30:04] indeed
[1:30:04] i'm free i'm free of bitterness i'm fear
[1:30:07] of remorse
[1:30:08] i'm fear of condem free of condemnation
[1:30:11] i'm just free from this
[1:30:12] because i've heard the voice declared
[1:30:16] in my day i am free
[1:30:19] but you'll see people they'll hold on to
[1:30:21] spirits they'll hold on to attitudes
[1:30:23] they'll hold on to views that they have
[1:30:25] and all my brother and sister
[1:30:27] and they wonder and get more bitter and
[1:30:29] get more angry and get more whatever
[1:30:31] because they see a people moving forward
[1:30:34] into liberty
[1:30:36] and they're over here standing
[1:30:39] at the post at the temple
[1:30:43] saying i don't know how they can do that
[1:30:45] where's their security
[1:30:48] where is their where's their concern
[1:30:50] where's their
[1:30:51] what are they doing what are they doing
[1:30:54] how can you be happy in the world we
[1:30:56] live in today
[1:30:57] how can you be happy in these fiery
[1:30:59] trials how can you be happy
[1:31:02] because i heard didn't you hear didn't
[1:31:04] you hear the voice
[1:31:05] i'm free i'm no longer bound by sin
[1:31:08] by chain and by attitudes and spirit i'm
[1:31:11] no longer bound by
[1:31:12] church tradition i've been set free
[1:31:16] oh hallelujah the word said i'm free and
[1:31:19] i believe the word over anyone
[1:31:22] hallelujah now when they hear heard the
[1:31:24] jubilee
[1:31:25] sound and if it didn't want to be free
[1:31:30] then he had to be sealed as it is today
[1:31:34] that when men and women hear this
[1:31:36] marvelous gospel
[1:31:37] the lord jesus christ and of the baptism
[1:31:39] of the holy ghost you're a place where
[1:31:41] you
[1:31:41] have to make a choice
[1:31:44] now see this seems so subtle or i mean
[1:31:47] seems so open but it's very subtle
[1:31:50] because my brother and sister people
[1:31:51] will confess
[1:31:53] that they're saved by the gospel of
[1:31:54] jesus christ
[1:31:57] they'll confess that they have the holy
[1:31:59] ghost
[1:32:03] but i'm also a fighter pilot and a
[1:32:06] billionaire
[1:32:08] just ask me i'll tell you
[1:32:11] sounds absurd doesn't it i hope you
[1:32:13] catch the point
[1:32:15] just because they say doesn't mean they
[1:32:17] are
[1:32:19] right you know they come up with that
[1:32:22] term
[1:32:23] many years ago rhino republicans in name
[1:32:25] only
[1:32:26] and they touted that it was like a slur
[1:32:28] ah you're a republican name only
[1:32:31] that means you're not a real republican
[1:32:33] and there's been quite a few years and i
[1:32:34] went probably a good decade before i
[1:32:36] ever heard somebody else repeat this
[1:32:38] but one day i was just there looking and
[1:32:39] i thought that's right there's chinos
[1:32:43] christians in name only
[1:32:52] and today that when men and women hear
[1:32:54] the marvelous gospel of the lord jesus
[1:32:56] christ know the baptism of the holy
[1:32:57] ghost you're a place where you
[1:32:59] have to make a choice
[1:33:03] you can never hear it and be the same if
[1:33:06] you accept it you receive christ
[1:33:08] if you refuse it you're sealed away from
[1:33:11] christ and it makes a difference of your
[1:33:14] attitude towards a hearing
[1:33:15] of the word
[1:33:19] my are we all right
[1:33:23] okay i just need just a few short more
[1:33:25] minutes here
[1:33:28] and i was speaking this morning in a
[1:33:29] wonderful place here in the city at
[1:33:30] tabernacle i was speaking on this very
[1:33:32] subject that god wants his church to be
[1:33:34] free
[1:33:35] many things has happened during these 50
[1:33:38] years
[1:33:40] many people
[1:33:44] you see that next word many people
[1:33:48] believers has been caught and taken
[1:33:50] captive
[1:33:52] by the world so these were people my
[1:33:55] brother and sister
[1:33:56] they said right in the house of god they
[1:33:57] heard the preaching of the word they
[1:33:59] said amen to the word of god
[1:34:00] they live that but the enemy come in
[1:34:04] broke down the gate crept in
[1:34:10] i just say this for just a minor
[1:34:12] emphasis
[1:34:14] if you're in bed at night and you hear
[1:34:17] crashing of wood and breaking of glass
[1:34:22] now i know i'm a true blue
[1:34:26] born in idaho
[1:34:29] which means to prove your real true
[1:34:31] loyalty to
[1:34:33] the character and nature of idahoans i
[1:34:36] have guns
[1:34:36] stuffed everywhere and that that's kind
[1:34:40] of what proves your dedication
[1:34:44] okay somebody's got a sense of humor you
[1:34:47] hear glass breaking you hear wood
[1:34:48] crunching
[1:34:49] you're probably not going to say i think
[1:34:51] it's the cat
[1:34:55] but you know that's not the way the
[1:34:56] devil works you've never seen the devil
[1:34:59] once come
[1:35:01] and take a big battering ram and knock
[1:35:03] down the front door
[1:35:05] what the devil does is he drops a flyer
[1:35:08] in your mailbox
[1:35:10] and then the devil somehow gets the
[1:35:12] preset on your radio
[1:35:14] to a different station and you realize
[1:35:16] that's the same song i listened to
[1:35:19] when i was 16.
[1:35:22] oh such lovely memories
[1:35:28] and then pretty soon you start acting
[1:35:29] like you're 16 and
[1:35:31] dressing like you're 16 and listening to
[1:35:34] the music of 16 and
[1:35:36] the attitude of 16.
[1:35:41] and then people go i just don't know
[1:35:42] what happened over the years i just
[1:35:45] i just realized now that being a
[1:35:46] christian is not all
[1:35:48] i was taught it was no especially when
[1:35:51] the devil's doing the teaching
[1:35:53] when the devil's the tutor my brother
[1:35:55] and sister christianity is never gonna
[1:35:57] be what you thought you were taught
[1:35:59] and you can see this now you say brother
[1:36:01] paul you sound a little harsh or a
[1:36:02] little critical no
[1:36:03] but i'm telling you i've seen this over
[1:36:05] and over again of people
[1:36:06] i personally know and watch the
[1:36:09] transition and i have spoken words to
[1:36:11] them
[1:36:11] and i have begged them and i've tried to
[1:36:14] encourage them and i've tried to bring
[1:36:16] them back to a place
[1:36:17] open your eyes and see what you're doing
[1:36:19] and they start reliving their life in a
[1:36:21] different world my brother and sister
[1:36:28] and all of a sudden
[1:36:32] well i think
[1:36:36] we're all going to heaven it's just a
[1:36:39] matter of where you'll be in heaven
[1:36:45] okay i want to be up in the cascades of
[1:36:49] heaven not in the bronx of heaven
[1:36:58] many people believers has been caught
[1:37:00] and taken captive by the world many
[1:37:02] people denomination barriers sometimes
[1:37:04] separated fellowship and draw barriers i
[1:37:06] was singing here not long ago someone
[1:37:07] asked me brother branham what church do
[1:37:09] you belong to
[1:37:10] i said there's really only one church
[1:37:12] the church means
[1:37:13] the call now hallelujah i belong to
[1:37:17] church
[1:37:18] hallelujah i'm called out ah thank you
[1:37:21] lord
[1:37:22] hallelujah now as we look at this my
[1:37:25] brother and sister see what's happened
[1:37:26] right here
[1:37:27] we'll look as we go back and i won't go
[1:37:29] back in the quote but we'll look at this
[1:37:31] my brother and sister what's happening
[1:37:32] a door opens we're invited to step
[1:37:36] through it but when that door
[1:37:39] of the holy spirit then closes
[1:37:44] it seals you in
[1:37:48] and there are people my brother and
[1:37:49] sister people say well they have the
[1:37:52] holy ghost and they backslid and
[1:37:54] don't serve god now they had an
[1:37:57] anointing
[1:37:58] on this old guy right here because
[1:38:01] we see clearly in the word of god when
[1:38:03] the holy ghost comes
[1:38:05] and seals you it seals you to the day
[1:38:08] of your redemption you can see the devil
[1:38:12] right out there
[1:38:13] and i don't know if you know how to pick
[1:38:14] a lock i used to kind of experimented
[1:38:16] that stuff
[1:38:17] and but you know i realized i had no
[1:38:20] business doing that because why would i
[1:38:22] be doing that but you know you can take
[1:38:24] a
[1:38:25] small thin spring wire and a flat
[1:38:28] thin piece of metal that's flexible and
[1:38:31] you take and slide the metal
[1:38:33] flat one in there it goes at a slight
[1:38:35] taper and you keep working it until you
[1:38:37] push the pins up
[1:38:39] and then you use the spring wire to hold
[1:38:41] that pin up
[1:38:42] while you move on to the next pin and
[1:38:45] press it up i know you all want to know
[1:38:46] how to do this
[1:38:50] but did you know they make locks that
[1:38:53] can't be picked
[1:38:56] and god put one of them on the door of
[1:38:58] your heart
[1:38:59] god didn't put some cheap little five
[1:39:02] dollar walmart kmart whatever kind of
[1:39:04] lock on the door of your heart
[1:39:06] god put a lock on the door of your heart
[1:39:09] and i can see the devil out there
[1:39:11] morning noon and night and he's holding
[1:39:13] that thing and he's sliding that wire
[1:39:15] and pushing that thing and sliding it
[1:39:17] and he's spending hours doing that and
[1:39:19] he hears them
[1:39:27] then the holy ghost which is the guard
[1:39:28] dog of our life
[1:39:30] comes out of the backyard and the
[1:39:32] devil's like oh my goodness they're
[1:39:33] praying again
[1:39:35] i gotta get out of here i can't deal
[1:39:37] with this atmosphere
[1:39:38] they start to pray and i tell you what
[1:39:40] it just it's hard on me
[1:39:42] it's hard on me i just can't do it and
[1:39:43] they flee
[1:39:45] but you know what he'll be back the next
[1:39:46] night or the next week once again
[1:39:49] knelt down at your door trying to pick
[1:39:51] it
[1:39:52] but god has put an impeccable lock
[1:39:55] called the holy ghost
[1:39:57] in your life oh hallelujah
[1:40:00] aren't you glad god's got a lock that
[1:40:03] can't be picked
[1:40:04] and he seals you to the day of your
[1:40:07] redemption
[1:40:09] and i'll tell you what my brother and
[1:40:10] sister it makes my heart break but i see
[1:40:12] people
[1:40:12] that that the devil's picking the lock
[1:40:15] to my door i'll just make it easy for
[1:40:17] him

[1:40:23] do that they're going to be there it's
[1:40:24] like look the devil's knocking on the
[1:40:26] door of my family knocking on the door
[1:40:27] of my life

[1:40:41] hearing and receiving
[1:40:45] the door is then closed and you're
[1:40:48] sealed in
[1:40:50] hearing and rejecting the door is then
[1:40:54] closed
[1:40:55] and you're sealed out
[1:40:58] the door is opening and the door is
[1:41:01] closing
[1:41:03] it happens in every individual's life
[1:41:07] there is none all this only for these
[1:41:08] it's only for those no i'm sorry
[1:41:11] the door opens and the door closes it
[1:41:14] all depends on which side
[1:41:15] of the door you want to be in
[1:41:19] do you realize in the old days you know
[1:41:22] right after the jews started coming back
[1:41:24] you know right
[1:41:24] uh and uh actually before world war ii
[1:41:27] really got started right the british
[1:41:29] controlled palestine
[1:41:31] and and jews were starting to come back
[1:41:33] that anointing was starting to work
[1:41:35] starting to move they were starting to
[1:41:36] come back to their land
[1:41:38] and and uh you know they did all they
[1:41:40] could do to keep these people out they
[1:41:41] didn't want they didn't want them there
[1:41:43] they didn't want them there and and you
[1:41:45] know what what happened is
[1:41:47] is that people were so desirous were so
[1:41:50] anointed my brother and sister that they
[1:41:53] would do
[1:41:54] almost anything imaginable
[1:41:57] some chose the route of the del desert
[1:42:00] only to be
[1:42:00] caught up with a army patrol and and
[1:42:03] rounded up to be
[1:42:04] we're going to send you back and they
[1:42:06] just did everything they could do
[1:42:08] and some my brother and sister so
[1:42:10] desperate
[1:42:12] oh i hope you get this some become
[1:42:16] so desperate
[1:42:20] they prayed
[1:42:23] some marched through deserts some swam
[1:42:25] some did this some did that
[1:42:26] some tried to be smuggled in some and
[1:42:29] some prayed
[1:42:31] lovely stories of whole families in
[1:42:34] prayer
[1:42:34] lord you know we feel anointed to go
[1:42:37] back to the holy land to go back to our
[1:42:39] land to go back to our home
[1:42:41] oh god this is our horse desire and they
[1:42:43] come there
[1:42:44] and the british authorities are like
[1:42:46] okay why did you come here
[1:42:48] and the man's then anointed anointed
[1:42:51] telling the truth
[1:42:52] anointed he doesn't come to say i just
[1:42:54] want to return back to the holy land i
[1:42:56] want to come back to my
[1:42:57] land of my nation of my people the man
[1:42:59] comes and says i want to come here and
[1:43:00] start this certain kind of business a
[1:43:02] bakery
[1:43:03] and they're like we don't have enough
[1:43:05] bakeries come
[1:43:10] god opens a door
[1:43:14] god closes a door
[1:43:17] when god seals you and by the way that
[1:43:20] man's family is alive and well and
[1:43:22] prospered in israel
[1:43:23] all these years
[1:43:27] god opens the door the devil can't close
[1:43:29] it
[1:43:30] god closes the door the devil
[1:43:33] can't open it what we need
[1:43:37] is to go home and pray about it
[1:43:40] amen that's what our real need is
[1:43:44] pray about it lord if the door's
[1:43:45] supposed to be open you will open it if
[1:43:47] the door is supposed to be closed lord
[1:43:48] you will close it
[1:43:50] but also be cognizant saints
[1:43:53] the word shows us very clearly god opens
[1:43:55] the door for a season
[1:44:00] and there'll come a day prophet of god
[1:44:02] says
[1:44:03] the very seat that is the mercy seat
[1:44:09] is becoming the judgment seat
[1:44:13] and we'll be preaching on that here in
[1:44:14] just a little bit i want to go into that
[1:44:16] series after we just wrap a couple more
[1:44:18] things here but i want you to understand
[1:44:19] the prophet of god also gives a very
[1:44:21] clear picture
[1:44:22] that in the heart of the true believer
[1:44:25] god is
[1:44:25] always on the mercy seat
[1:44:28] don't be afraid oh god's turning into a
[1:44:31] judge he's turned into a judge what are
[1:44:32] we going to do
[1:44:34] well get inside that door get filled
[1:44:37] with the holy ghost
[1:44:39] let him put his lock on the door and
[1:44:42] then
[1:44:43] he'll always be on the mercy seat for
[1:44:45] you
[1:44:46] hallelujah amen i'm just going to cut
[1:44:49] off the last of my thought here
[1:44:51] i think i've made it as best as i will
[1:44:53] sister emmy if you would come
[1:44:57] but this is so good
[1:45:02] we'll catch it again another sunday
[1:45:06] amen
[1:45:14] now i try to
[1:45:17] be very careful about what i listen to
[1:45:19] for music
[1:45:20] can you all say the same okay i hope so
[1:45:24] because the prophet of god said that
[1:45:26] music has a direct entrance right
[1:45:29] but these were parts of a song i think a
[1:45:33] pentecostal lady
[1:45:34] sing the song i thought it i thought it
[1:45:36] was just
[1:45:37] nice to think about these words holiness
[1:45:41] has a name and it's jesus
[1:45:45] victory has a name and it's jesus
[1:45:49] healing has a name and it's jesus
[1:45:53] redemption has a name and it's jesus the
[1:45:58] word
[1:45:59] has a name
[1:46:02] and it's jesus hallelujah
[1:46:05] i wish more of the world had a
[1:46:07] revelation of john 1
[1:46:09] you know that just helped a lot of
[1:46:11] people out
[1:46:12] help a lot of people have them you know
[1:46:16] i don't know that this is the right
[1:46:17] number i had it scribbled on a piece of
[1:46:19] paper and it just struck me this song
[1:46:21] the blood will never lose its power i
[1:46:23] have 563 i don't know if that's actually
[1:46:26] what it is or not
[1:46:27] amen i know at one time we changed books
[1:46:29] or something like that
[1:46:31] and brother jason converted this to a
[1:46:34] book had much much more
[1:46:37] songs in it and so it changed the
[1:46:39] numbers or whatever
[1:46:40] there we are hallelujah let's just stand
[1:46:43] and sing a song or two before we go this
[1:46:45] morning
[1:46:46] i pray my brother and sister as the door
[1:46:49] of the word
[1:46:51] has been opened to you and i step
[1:46:53] through it
[1:46:54] receive it act upon it declare it
[1:46:58] hallelujah then let that door of the
[1:47:00] holy spirit close behind you
[1:47:04] oh my brother and sister
[1:47:05] [Music]
[1:47:07] i don't want to overemphasize this but
[1:47:09] if you're shopping
[1:47:11] for a convenient inexpensive
[1:47:16] spirit to seal you
[1:47:19] you will find one
[1:47:22] but if you're willing to go to the real
[1:47:25] locksmith the one
[1:47:26] that opens hearts
[1:47:29] changes lives if you're willing to do
[1:47:33] that
[1:47:33] he will seal you with a lock
[1:47:36] on the door of your life
[1:47:40] that the devil no matter how hard he
[1:47:42] tries
[1:47:44] can't pick it oh doesn't the word give
[1:47:47] you joy when you read that that you're
[1:47:49] sealed into the day
[1:47:51] of your redemption it just makes my
[1:47:53] heart just
[1:47:54] tingle to realize that god in his
[1:47:57] infinite grace and mercy
[1:47:58] could put a paddle lock called the holy
[1:48:00] ghost on our life and lock it up so
[1:48:03] tight
[1:48:04] that the devil can go around and around
[1:48:07] in the year
[1:48:07] after the year after the year after the
[1:48:10] year
[1:48:10] and not make one bitter progress of
[1:48:13] getting in
[1:48:14] and changing you thank you lord
[1:48:18] oh hallelujah you know part of the
[1:48:20] reason god did that just like they had
[1:48:22] you know like 12 layers of security at
[1:48:24] fort knox
[1:48:25] the reason god did this is because he
[1:48:28] knows the value
[1:48:30] of the blood and when the blood was
[1:48:33] deposited in you
[1:48:34] the word the life he said i'll lock it
[1:48:37] up tight
[1:48:38] nothing will corrupt we could go into so
[1:48:40] many scriptures
[1:48:41] about moth and corrupt and whatever that
[1:48:44] we touch
[1:48:45] but you see it can't get in there can't
[1:48:46] change it same holy ghost
[1:48:48] that god's given to you just as good
[1:48:51] tomorrow
[1:48:53] as it will be if the lord tarries and
[1:48:55] you're 99 years old
[1:48:57] it'll be just as good in that beautiful
[1:49:00] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:49:05] the blood that jesus
[1:49:24] [Music]
[1:49:34] [Music]
[1:49:40] it's
[1:49:44] [Music]
[1:49:52] [Music]
[1:49:54] and
[1:50:01] [Music]
[1:50:06] that gives me strength
[1:50:18] [Music]
[1:50:22] is
[1:50:25] [Music]
[1:50:39] [Music]
[1:50:42] the blood that gives me strength
[1:50:52] it will never
[1:50:56] lose its power
[1:51:02] for it reaches
[1:51:12] [Music]
[1:51:18] hallelujah
[1:51:24] that gives me strength
[1:51:36] [Music]
[1:51:39] can we just thank the lord hallelujah
[1:51:42] lord thank you father this redeeming
[1:51:46] blood lord never lose its power lord
[1:51:48] he'll never come a day father
