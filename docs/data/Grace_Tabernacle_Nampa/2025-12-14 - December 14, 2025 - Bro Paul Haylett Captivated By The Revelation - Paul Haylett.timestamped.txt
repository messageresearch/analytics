[28:23] audience with you, Lord.
[28:26] Lord, I I can't even
[28:32] It's not possible that I could remember
[28:34] all of these requests, Father. There's
[28:35] so many.
[28:37] It can be overwhelming, Lord Jesus. And
[28:39] yet, everyone is so important. It's very
[28:42] important. There are people whose lives
[28:45] are changed, Lord. There are people
[28:47] whose hearts are broken.
[28:51] Father, there's so many needs for health
[28:55] and for comfort, for peace, Lord.
[28:59] Lord, to lose a child, Father, is is a

[29:27] church, Father.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; Despite our mistakes, despite our
[29:31] failures, Lord Jesus, it's not us. It's
[29:33] you. We are sitting in heavenly places
[29:36] in Christ Jesus. Father, we have all
[29:39] spiritual blessings, Lord. We just ask
[29:42] you, Father, to touch her, Father, and
[29:44] that she will certainly be healed, Lord.
[29:48] Lord, definitely we ask for your perfect
[29:50] will in all these matters. Sister Lily.
[29:52] Lord, we ask that you'd touch her,
[29:53] Father, and and just heal her of this
[29:56] kidney infection, Father.
[29:59] Lord, there's many families up north,
[30:01] Brother Adrian, Sister Ada, and the
[30:05] saints up north there in Idaho and
[30:07] Eastern Washington, Father Montana.
[30:13] Oh Lord Jesus,
[30:16] I have an my own need, Father, and I
[30:18] lift my hand.
[30:21] Desperate need, Lord.
[30:25] Lord, we're a needy people, Father.
[30:30] We ask, Father, for your grace, for your
[30:32] mercy. Father,
[30:36] touch every heart, Lord.
[30:39] deliver the afflicted, we pray, Lord.
[30:43] Lord, we ask you to just to be present
[30:46] in the remainder of this service,
[30:48] Father. We have needs. You know our
[30:52] needs better than we do, Lord Jesus. And
[30:54] we just ask that you speak to our hearts
[30:56] and that we have a heart to receive it,
[30:58] Lord Jesus. Give us ears to hear, Lord
[31:01] Jesus, is our prayer.
[31:03] Eyes to see and give us the uncction of
[31:05] the Holy Ghost to live your word,
[31:08] Father.
[31:13] I just ask all the saints to forgive me
[31:15] for those who are those petitions who
[31:19] are very important to you that I've
[31:21] forgotten.
[31:24] Just bless each one, Lord.

[43:08] and greatly
[43:10] to be praised. I sing praises. Amen.
[43:14] Just worship him this morning. Praises
[43:17] to your name,
[43:20] oh Lord.
[43:23] Praises to your name,
[43:27] oh Lord,
[43:30] for your name is great
[43:33] and greatly
[43:35] to be praised.
[43:41] I sing praises to your name,
[43:46] oh Lord,
[43:48] praises to your name,
[43:52] oh Lord,
[43:55] for your name is great
[43:59] and greatly to be praised.
[44:04] We give glory.
[44:07] Want to give glory to your name,
[44:12] oh Lord.
[44:14] Glory to your name,
[44:18] oh Lord,
[44:21] for your name is great
[44:25] and greatly
[44:27] to be praised.
[44:33] I give glory to your name,
[44:38] oh Lord.
[44:40] Glory to your name,
[44:44] oh Lord,
[44:47] for your name is great
[44:51] and greatly
[44:53] to be praised.
[44:59] Amen.
[45:01] Hallelujah. Lord Jesus,
[45:07] Lord, the heart of the believers, the
[45:08] heart of your saints is to worship you
[45:10] this morning. Lord God, we give you
[45:11] thanks. We give you glory. We give you
[45:15] worship, Lord Jesus.
[45:18] Love you, Lord God.
[45:22] Amen.
[45:26] God bless you.
[45:30] Amen. and saints, if you'd be seated for
[45:32] just a moment.
[45:35] Amen. We just this morning
[45:38] just want to remember all of those who
[45:41] are not able to be here with us today.
[45:44] Um the Lord knows their hearts and we
[45:47] certainly believe that they have a
[45:49] desire to be here. Amen. Um just a few
[45:54] things we want to remember. Uh, one I
[45:57] don't I don't think it's a secret, but
[45:59] we're looking forward to Brother Persant
[46:00] and Sister Koncha being here with us for
[46:02] Christmas time. So, that'll be wonderful
[46:05] to see them to be able to meet. I think
[46:09] Sister Carrie, you're the only one
[46:10] that's met Isaac. Yeah, man. What a
[46:14] privilege. Amen. But they'll be coming
[46:16] and and it'll be a wonderful time to see
[46:19] them in person again. And we want to
[46:21] remember our sister Rachel. Um the due
[46:25] date uh is coming up very soon and we
[46:28] want to lift her and the baby up in
[46:30] prayer. Just want to have mom and baby
[46:33] to be healthy and and strong and be
[46:36] able. I remember a brother one time made
[46:40] a statement to me. He said um I don't
[46:42] know and I'm not making a doctrine of
[46:44] this but possibly could it be the church
[46:46] is just going to grow from within. And
[46:49] um however the Lord chooses to grow the
[46:52] church, we say thank you, Lord. So just
[46:55] lift Sister Rachel up in prayer. Now,
[46:57] this is a part that's going to be a
[47:00] little shocking to someone. Uh but
[47:02] they'll get over it in time. Uh Sister
[47:05] Melody uh feels led of the Lord to move
[47:08] to Ohio and um we haven't been able to
[47:12] change her mind. We've made threats.
[47:14] We've tried small forms of bribery. Uh
[47:18] but none of that has changed her mind.
[47:20] And so we definitely want to lift our
[47:23] sister Melody up in prayer for this
[47:26] major change or move in her life. And
[47:29] we're actually going to invite her to
[47:30] come up this morning. I know she's still
[47:32] going to be here on Wednesday night, but
[47:35] uh we're just going to uh just ask some
[47:37] of the brothers to come up. We're going
[47:39] to lay our hands on Sister Melody. No,
[47:41] we're not trying to change her mind.
[47:44] Amen. We just want to just ask the Lord
[47:46] to give her traveling mercies and uh be
[47:49] with her. She needs to She's got
[47:51] short-term plans, but she needs a place
[47:53] to live. She needs a good job. Amen.
[47:55] It's not just to have a job, but she
[47:57] needs a good job. And we want the Lord
[47:59] as as uh she is following the leadership
[48:02] of the Lord. We just want the Lord to
[48:04] pour his blessings out upon her uh that
[48:07] the way would be smooth as the scripture
[48:09] said, he would make the rough places
[48:11] smooth before us. And so, amen.
[48:14] Brothers, would you just come and let's
[48:17] lay hands on our sister Melody. And um I
[48:20] love my niece very very much. Um she's
[48:24] very special girl to me. And uh it's in
[48:27] that that I am actually heartbroken that
[48:31] she feels led to move. I'm I'm thinking.
[48:34] But you see what we know is that
[48:36] sometimes we need to make a shift so we
[48:39] can have spiritual growth. Sometimes the
[48:41] Lord's just asking us to take a step a
[48:43] little further, a step of trust.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; And so we want to commit this time a
[48:50] travel mercies future of my dear niece
[48:53] uh to the Lord that the Lord would just
[48:55] bless her. He's done such incredible
[48:58] things.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Excuse me while I cry a little bit.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; He has answered our prayers.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We see this and I believe he'll
[49:11] continue to answer our prayers. Amen.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord, we come before
[49:17] you this morning with thanksgiving in
[49:19] our hearts. Lord, sorrow and joy at the
[49:22] same time, Lord. Father, the joy, Lord,
[49:25] to see you doing this mighty work in
[49:28] Sister Melody's life. Lord, how you've
[49:31] come. You've proven yourself to her
[49:33] again and again and again. Now Lord,
[49:36] we're believing Father that as you are
[49:38] guiding her on this journey, Lord, you
[49:41] will make the way smooth before us,
[49:43] Father, traveling mercies, Lord, as she
[49:46] travels to Ohio, Lord, that you would
[49:49] just bless her with a good job, a good
[49:51] place to live, Lord, that there would be
[49:54] those saints that would become her
[49:55] cherished friends, that they would be
[49:58] encouraers, mentors, father, friends
[50:00] like no other. Lord, we would just ask
[50:03] for your hand of mercy upon her. And
[50:05] Lord, as she would be there, Father, let
[50:08] the ministry just touch her life,
[50:10] Father, that spiritual growth would just
[50:12] come abundantly, it would be poured out
[50:15] abundantly in her life, Father. Lord, as
[50:18] you draw her close, Father, we thank
[50:20] you, Father. Lord, that she recognizes
[50:23] and is standing solid as a daughter of
[50:26] God. May the word just come and the
[50:28] promises of your word be fulfilled in
[50:31] her life, Lord. Bless her steps, Father.
[50:34] Bless the work of her hands, Lord. Bless
[50:36] her praise, Father, as it comes to the
[50:38] throne, Lord, that you would just be
[50:40] with her, Lord, even in the most
[50:42] difficult of times, Father. She would
[50:44] know without a doubt that you are there
[50:46] with her. Father, we ask for this
[50:48] blessing in the name of Jesus Christ.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[51:04] Amen. Good to be in the house of the
[51:06] Lord today.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm just so thankful for
[51:10] what the Lord gives to us. We see so
[51:12] many I won't go into detail on it, but
[51:14] we see so many incredible things how the
[51:16] Lord just comes and and he speaks to us
[51:20] and it's in season.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. We We're not the one in control.
[51:24] God's the one in control and he speaks
[51:26] to us and and it's not just he singles
[51:29] one single person out to speak to them
[51:32] but he's speaking to a body. I come
[51:34] across a quote the other day. I wished I
[51:36] would have included it. Brother Brandham
[51:38] saying this is the same Holy Spirit
[51:40] moving all around the world. Amen.
[51:42] Aren't you glad to be a part of that to
[51:45] see that what God is doing here he is
[51:47] doing other places. Thank you musicians.
[51:49] Sorry distraction here. Oh wait I'm
[51:52] preaching on distraction. So anyway,
[51:54] look at this, my brothers and sisters.
[51:56] How that we are such a blessed people
[51:58] sometimes all the cares of life we kind
[52:01] of forget a little bit, but uh I say
[52:03] today, thank you Lord for for what
[52:05] you've done. Let's just stand for the
[52:07] reading of the word and um just uh want
[52:11] to speak to you this morning. Now, I
[52:14] struggled to really put I had a whole
[52:15] list of titles and and felt like I I
[52:20] would more drawn to this one. Um,
[52:24] captivated by the revelation. And we
[52:27] understand the word captivated uh is
[52:30] talking about how that we are drawn to
[52:33] uh and uh uh focused upon and kept in
[52:38] that focus. So, a captivation is not
[52:41] just a passing whim. It's not just
[52:42] something that came today left tomorrow.
[52:45] But to be captivated is that and we know
[52:48] that to be captivated is uh very
[52:51] important. There's a lot of things uh in
[52:53] our relationships, marriage, etc. It's
[52:56] it always pays to have a captivated
[52:58] marriage versus an indifferent one.
[53:01] Amen. And as Christians to have a
[53:04] captivated relationship versus an
[53:07] indifferent one. and and there's a lot
[53:09] of things that if you're an employer,
[53:12] you want a captivated employee, not an
[53:14] indifferent one. Amen. So, we'll see the
[53:17] in influence of this. Amen. So, let's
[53:20] just turn in our Bibles to Psalms, the
[53:22] 27th chapter. Maybe seems like a little
[53:25] bit different uh uh scripture to use for
[53:28] a thought like this, but this is David
[53:33] expressing
[53:36] who the Lord is to him. Right.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; He's basically saying he's my
[53:40] everything.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; He He's what He's what's drawn me. He's
[53:45] what's keeping me. Amen. The Lord is my
[53:49] light and my salvation.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the
[53:54] strength of my life. Of whom shall I be
[53:58] afraid? When the wicked, even mine
[54:00] enemies and my foes come upon me to eat
[54:03] up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. And
[54:07] I want to ask you today, I pray, I pray
[54:10] you can say yes to this, but do you have
[54:12] an evidence in your life that your
[54:14] enemies have come, stumbled, and fell?
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe as a Christian, as
[54:19] believers today, we have evidence that
[54:22] our enemies have stumbled and fell. They
[54:25] have not overcome us. They've not
[54:26] conquered us. Amen. We are not captive
[54:29] to Satan's plan. That's right.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Though a host should encamp
[54:34] against me, my heart shall not fear.
[54:37] Though war should rise against me, in
[54:39] this will I be confident. One thing have
[54:43] I desired of the Lord, that will I seek
[54:47] after, that I may dwell in the house of
[54:51] the Lord all the days of my life. Amen.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; To behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[54:57] inquire in his temple. For in the time
[55:00] of trouble he shall hide me in his
[55:02] pavilion. In the secret of his
[55:04] tabernacle shall he hide me. For he he
[55:08] shall set me upon a rock. Amen.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; And now shall my head be lifted up above
[55:13] mine enemies. Round about me. Therefore
[55:16] will I offer in his tabernacle
[55:18] sacrifices of joy. I will sing. Yay. I
[55:22] will sing praises unto the Lord. Here, O
[55:25] Lord, when I cry with my voice, have
[55:28] mercy upon also upon me, and answer me.
[55:32] When thou saidest, seek ye my face, my
[55:37] heart said unto thee, thy face, Lord,
[55:41] will I seek.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we lift a hand this morning
[55:44] and say, Lord, thy face will I seek.
[55:48] Amen. For he's speaking to a bride. He's
[55:50] calling out to this bride and she's here
[55:53] to say, "Yes, my Lord. Yes, my Lord."
[55:56] Heavenly Father, we just ask you this
[55:59] morning, Lord, to just come in our
[56:00] midst. Lord, many distractions of the
[56:03] week, of the days, Father, little things
[56:06] in our health, a cough, a a sore throat,
[56:09] a this or that. Father, all these things
[56:12] would be there to try to keep us from
[56:14] giving praise to you. But this morning,
[56:16] Lord, we lift our voices and say, Lord,
[56:19] we love you and we thank you this
[56:21] morning for your grace and for your
[56:23] mercy that you have so freely poured out
[56:25] upon us, Lord. How we appreciate what
[56:29] you've done for us. And I ask you this
[56:31] morning, Lord, as you come, move in our
[56:33] midst. Speak to our hearts, Lord, that
[56:36] we would be able this morning just to
[56:38] open up, Father, and let our hearts be
[56:41] able to speak. And Father, we're not
[56:43] looking, Father, at this flesh. We're
[56:45] not looking at failure. We're looking at
[56:47] a promise. And the promise is coming to
[56:50] pass right before our eyes. And we thank
[56:53] you for that. Lord, I ask for your
[56:55] blessing on the saints today in the
[56:57] precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You may be seated. God bless
[57:03] you, brother Daniel. Good to see you, my
[57:05] friend.
[57:06] Amen.
[57:08] Each and every one of you, good to see
[57:10] you today. Praise the uh Lord for for a
[57:14] wonderful group of people to fellowship,
[57:16] to worship with. Amen. And it's here in
[57:19] this age that we're living in that um
[57:22] it's getting harder and harder, saints.
[57:24] You know, just look at the natural side
[57:25] of life. Amen. I just saw a little
[57:28] report. You know, there's a whole issue
[57:30] in the farm community uh of uh what's
[57:34] happening economically. And uh connected
[57:37] to that was this little graph of what it
[57:39] took to buy a house uh 50 years ago. And
[57:42] and uh it does make my heart ache a
[57:45] little bit for our young people because
[57:47] we're moving into a time that that it's
[57:49] almost become an impossibility for many
[57:53] young couples uh to to go out and and be
[57:56] able to get started on a solid footing.
[57:59] But yet I can tell you this just in my
[58:01] youngster age here that um it's never
[58:06] been easy. And the scripture tells us
[58:08] that we're living in the darkest time
[58:10] there is in history. And yet my brother
[58:13] and sister we might in oursel look back
[58:15] to the dark ages and say my you know
[58:19] we're not going through what they're
[58:20] going through but you are. Amen. those
[58:23] same spirits of fear and anxieties,
[58:25] depressions, and all of these things
[58:27] that were there in that day that caused
[58:30] many people in the in Fox's book of uh
[58:34] mortars. I said that for my wife's sake,
[58:37] martyrs. Amen. that um it it it accounts
[58:41] to that how many people come to points
[58:44] in their life that they had served God
[58:46] for seasons and then something clicked
[58:49] and they said it's too hard. My brother
[58:52] and sister, I'm telling you, it's no
[58:55] harder today for the day we live in than
[58:59] it has been in any other age. Because
[59:01] there's an anointing has come down in
[59:03] this hour of the word to anoint you and
[59:06] I. If we will receive that anointing, we
[59:09] will be overcomers. Amen. So don't look
[59:13] and say, "We're living in the worst
[59:15] time. I can't do it." No. Receive the
[59:18] anointing of the hour. And that
[59:20] anointing is sufficient to get you
[59:23] through the challenge of our day.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the world we live in today is
[59:28] full of things to captivate us. You
[59:30] know, it doesn't matter what you have an
[59:32] interest in. There's enough information,
[59:36] uh, enough things to get a hold of our
[59:38] attention that, uh, it's sports,
[59:40] politics, uh, you know, I would put it
[59:42] this way. There's a magazine for
[59:44] everything. There's a book for
[59:46] everything. Uh, there's just so many
[59:48] things we can go into information
[59:50] overload. And sometimes my brother and
[59:53] sister, I don't know about you, uh I
[59:55] know brother Barry has spoke quite a bit
[59:57] extensively on AI and its impact and
[1:00:00] what is coming and we'll see that. But I
[1:00:03] have decided in a very short time that I
[1:00:06] don't like AI. I don't like my phone
[1:00:08] trying to finish my sentence for me. I I
[1:00:11] don't want my computer telling me you
[1:00:13] don't want to look for this. You want to
[1:00:14] look for this. Amen. So we'll see this
[1:00:17] artificial intelligence that is out
[1:00:20] there. Now think about what that is in a
[1:00:22] carnal world. Now think about what it is
[1:00:25] in a spiritual world. Amen. Satan coming
[1:00:28] down saying, "You want more of God? This
[1:00:31] is what you need. You want more of God,
[1:00:33] do this." My brother and sister, while
[1:00:36] Google might be accurate for most
[1:00:37] things, I'm not going to trust my life
[1:00:39] to Google. And I'm certainly not going
[1:00:42] to trust the devil for my spiritual
[1:00:44] leadership. I'm not going to trust him
[1:00:46] to do what's best for me or for you.
[1:00:49] Amen. So, we sit here today and realize
[1:00:52] in the world of information overload,
[1:00:54] now I'm just I hope you don't mind me
[1:00:56] bringing this on a personal level. I
[1:00:58] have had to push back on this. I am
[1:01:01] offered and still offered just literally
[1:01:04] dozens of free magazines to do with
[1:01:06] agriculture. They just they want you to
[1:01:09] take it. I quit filling out their renew
[1:01:11] for free cards about five years ago and
[1:01:14] I still receive them. They want you to
[1:01:16] have this so bad. And and as I said say
[1:01:19] to sister Jerry, you know what? I could
[1:01:22] take this same month uh five years ago
[1:01:24] and the articles are just rewarded, but
[1:01:26] they're the exact same thing. There's
[1:01:28] nothing new that is written in those
[1:01:31] magazines. What they're there for is a
[1:01:33] distraction to consume the time of Sons
[1:01:36] and Daughters of God. Amen. Now look,
[1:01:38] some of you that just love to decorate,
[1:01:40] you're crafty, all of this. I promise
[1:01:43] you, if you will go back and look
[1:01:44] through all those things, you'll see the
[1:01:47] scripture says nothing new under the
[1:01:50] sun. All it is is Satan trying to
[1:01:53] distract you and I because that's the
[1:01:55] one thing we only have a limited amount
[1:01:57] of time is time. Amen. We cannot go and
[1:02:01] create more time. And so Satan's come,
[1:02:04] he's trying to convince us that these
[1:02:07] things are necessary parts of their
[1:02:09] life. Amen. And so you look at this and
[1:02:12] realize it doesn't matter what point
[1:02:14] you're doing. It doesn't matter. I would
[1:02:16] say the about the only thing, this is an
[1:02:18] opinion, the only thing there is on
[1:02:21] earth that is not redundant is the word.
[1:02:24] And we could preach the word on the same
[1:02:26] subjects over and over, year after year,
[1:02:29] and God is always on time. It's always
[1:02:32] in a season that comes and touches
[1:02:34] something in our life. The word will
[1:02:37] never be redundant. The rest of the
[1:02:39] information on this world here, it in a
[1:02:42] sense is redundant. Now, is there
[1:02:43] breakthrough? I'm not saying there's no
[1:02:45] more things coming forth. Uh it is
[1:02:47] there. My brother and sister, we know
[1:02:49] that there is. But we're talking about
[1:02:52] in an overall picture. And the word is
[1:02:54] the one thing that is guaranteed to
[1:02:57] change you and I. Amen. And we have uh
[1:03:00] not a magazine as it were, but we have a
[1:03:03] book. And I said, you know, they have a
[1:03:05] book for everything. Well, let me turn
[1:03:07] that phrase, if you can pull this
[1:03:09] thought with your mind, we have a book
[1:03:12] for everything. Amen. It doesn't matter
[1:03:14] what's going on in your life, this book
[1:03:16] has answers. Amen. It will change our
[1:03:19] life if we won't get distracted from
[1:03:22] this book. Amen. So, we look at this.
[1:03:25] No, I love a good bit of history. I I
[1:03:28] love studying history uh and and those
[1:03:31] kind of things, but those should just be
[1:03:33] placed as a a sideline as it were. Now,
[1:03:36] I spoke a few years ago here at the
[1:03:38] church on uh several sermons on a
[1:03:41] distracted generation. And uh so, you
[1:03:44] know, you look at that and realize what
[1:03:46] is happening in the day that we live in.
[1:03:48] Now, I I believe any of us who have any
[1:03:51] kind of smart device or iPad, a
[1:03:53] computer, etc., you you go to check your
[1:03:56] email and then there's something else
[1:03:58] and you go to it for a moment and then
[1:04:01] that leads you to something here for a
[1:04:04] moment and then it leads you here to a
[1:04:06] moment and then pretty soon you're like
[1:04:09] oh my an hour's gone by
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; but I wasn't done reading that article
[1:04:13] so I got to finish reading the article
[1:04:15] and then that's how Satan robs our time
[1:04:18] and often times he's inserting in all of
[1:04:21] this information that we would not norm
[1:04:24] normally digest, but because it's in
[1:04:26] something we're focusing on, you know,
[1:04:29] you will see how that in the world we're
[1:04:31] living, excuse me,
[1:04:35] the world that we're living in, as we
[1:04:37] would say,
[1:04:40] that the word of God,
[1:04:43] nothing happens by chance, right? Every
[1:04:45] bit of word of God is is for our life,
[1:04:48] for a purpose. Now I want you to
[1:04:50] understand Satan studied the plan of God
[1:04:53] so thoroughly everything that Satan does
[1:04:57] is not by chance. It is for a purpose.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; So when we come face to face with these
[1:05:04] struggles, these challenges in our lives
[1:05:06] and we'll look at that and we first off
[1:05:08] need to recognize that it's not God
[1:05:10] doing this but it's Satan, we'll realize
[1:05:12] what he's trying to do and and he's
[1:05:15] trying to to cause something to happen.
[1:05:18] and he's trying to plant a seed. He's
[1:05:20] trying to encourage a seed that's
[1:05:22] already been planted. Maybe a bit of
[1:05:25] discouragement is in your life and you
[1:05:27] think, "Well, this doesn't matter." He's
[1:05:29] there to reinforce it. Doesn't matter.
[1:05:31] Amen. If there's something there that's
[1:05:33] trying to turn you away from the word of
[1:05:35] God, then he's there to bring evidence
[1:05:38] that you need to just leave the word
[1:05:40] alone. Life is just fine. Look at all
[1:05:42] these people out here driving new cars,
[1:05:44] living in nice big houses, taking
[1:05:46] wonderful vacations that don't even
[1:05:48] believe in a god. Why do you need a god?
[1:05:51] And so you see how Satan would work on
[1:05:53] this. And we'll be there and and realize
[1:05:55] that we could talk forever just on that
[1:05:58] thought. But my brother and sister, we
[1:06:00] are living in a distracted time, a time
[1:06:03] that is is got so much information
[1:06:06] overload. Uh if you dare waste your
[1:06:09] time, you can go on the computer and
[1:06:11] find out that's one of the greatest
[1:06:13] challenges corporate America has today
[1:06:15] or uh and uh business in general has
[1:06:18] today is distraction in the workplace.
[1:06:22] And it's not just the employees out here
[1:06:24] that are, you know, these uneducated,
[1:06:27] not too valuable people. It goes all the
[1:06:30] way up to the highest office in the
[1:06:31] skyscraper of how much distraction there
[1:06:34] is in their life. And it was there that
[1:06:37] one man, a reporter, uh, wrote in there.
[1:06:40] He said, "So many executives make
[1:06:43] statements such as, "One of the things I
[1:06:45] dislike about my job is a lack of time
[1:06:48] with my family." And then they dive into
[1:06:51] that and figure out that they could save
[1:06:53] sometimes up to four hours a day in
[1:06:57] wasted time. And they could go apply
[1:06:59] that four hours to their family. But see
[1:07:02] how it's eroded? It's there. It's
[1:07:04] digging it out. And we feel like
[1:07:06] whatever we're doing is justified. It's
[1:07:08] necessary. This is who we are. This is
[1:07:10] what we do. But yet, Satan is stealing
[1:07:12] that time from us. Amen. People will
[1:07:15] say, "I don't have time to pray." Well,
[1:07:17] we need to stop and look at where we are
[1:07:20] spending our time. Because if we spend
[1:07:22] our time on things that are of no
[1:07:24] profit, then how do we expect that to
[1:07:28] reward us or benefit us? So you look at
[1:07:31] this now and uh we have to remember this
[1:07:35] is the age this is a season the final
[1:07:37] closing chapter or uh curtains of the
[1:07:40] play that is there and and we need to
[1:07:43] remember what we were called to focus
[1:07:45] on. Amen. It's here my brother and
[1:07:48] sister. Now it's always such a t touchy
[1:07:51] subject amongst Christians you know to
[1:07:53] talk about money but I I'm here just to
[1:07:55] keep it real simple. If you have no
[1:07:57] relationship with Jesus Christ, your
[1:08:00] money's going to burn. If you do have a
[1:08:03] relationship with Jesus Christ, your
[1:08:05] money's gonna burn.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; So what is the common theme of that?
[1:08:11] Your money burning.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; But it's whether you have a relationship
[1:08:14] with the Lord or you don't. That's it.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; So it doesn't change anything here on
[1:08:19] the earth or this position. The money's
[1:08:21] going to burn. Amen. The nice house
[1:08:23] going to burn. The car is going to burn.
[1:08:25] All of these things are going to burn.
[1:08:27] What we need to focus on is a
[1:08:29] relationship with Jesus Christ.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in that there has to be an
[1:08:35] attraction.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I'll put it this way. People
[1:08:39] have this idea that God chose you. He's
[1:08:41] just going to force you to serve him.
[1:08:43] Not so, my brother and sister. But the
[1:08:45] law of attraction, if you study it out,
[1:08:47] God has placed something in you. Now, we
[1:08:49] can go down and say, "Look, there's a
[1:08:51] seed in the soul or the heart of man,
[1:08:53] and that seed's going to respond." But
[1:08:55] I'm telling you, it goes deeper because
[1:08:57] this relationship with Jesus Christ is
[1:09:00] in essence, don't don't think I'm
[1:09:02] discarding the seed. It's very
[1:09:04] necessary, but this is a law of
[1:09:07] attraction that Christ is looking for a
[1:09:10] bride. Now, every man that's ever looked
[1:09:13] for a wife, every woman that's ever
[1:09:15] looked for a husband, the potential
[1:09:17] that's there, there has to be an
[1:09:20] attraction. Amen. There has to be
[1:09:22] something beyond she has money, he has
[1:09:24] money, she's good-looking, he's
[1:09:26] good-looking. It has to go beyond that.
[1:09:28] The prophet of God told us that you look
[1:09:30] for someone with character in your life.
[1:09:32] Now, I want you to take this over into
[1:09:34] the spiritual realm here and look what
[1:09:36] it is. When Christ looked at you, he saw
[1:09:40] character. He sees character in you that
[1:09:43] you don't even see in yourself. But he
[1:09:46] sees the potential of this coming and
[1:09:49] being revealed. And when you look to
[1:09:52] Jesus Christ, when you are sick and you
[1:09:54] need a healer, you don't look to the
[1:09:56] devil. Amen. He's a killer. Amen. But
[1:09:59] our Lord Jesus Christ is a savior. He's
[1:10:02] a healer. So, we're looking to character
[1:10:04] to bring this relationship as a
[1:10:06] Christian down to a more natural
[1:10:10] relationship as we look at this because
[1:10:12] after all, we were created in his image
[1:10:15] and this is who we are.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; So, that means we're reflecting as
[1:10:19] believers his image or his character.
[1:10:23] So, we look for that character and he's
[1:10:26] looked for that character in you and I.
[1:10:28] And it's there that that is one of the
[1:10:30] things that captivates us as sons and
[1:10:32] daughters of God is here's someone who
[1:10:35] is willing to die for me. Sister Sue
[1:10:38] bought me a book some time back here of
[1:10:40] some military history and these men 50
[1:10:44] years after going in combat. The man
[1:10:46] remembers to the inth detail of the man
[1:10:49] who saved his life. And he says, "And I
[1:10:52] remember him and pray for him every
[1:10:55] single day." Amen.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; That is just natural, my brother and
[1:10:59] sister, of a man who would save a man's
[1:11:01] life. Amen. Now, look at where we are at
[1:11:04] as sons and daughters of God. Our lives
[1:11:07] have been saved. Can someone say amen?
[1:11:09] Our lives have been saved. And so, every
[1:11:11] day we should be lifting our voice to
[1:11:14] say, "Thank you, Lord, for saving me.
[1:11:17] Thank you, Lord, for what you've done
[1:11:19] for me. I would be dead and lost, but
[1:11:22] will you come and spared my life?" Amen.
[1:11:26] That's the kind of attraction that
[1:11:28] should captivate us that we would look
[1:11:31] at and say, "I can never forget who I
[1:11:33] used to be, but I was washed in his
[1:11:36] blood and I know who I am today by the
[1:11:38] promise of the word."
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, do I make mistakes? Do I come short?
[1:11:42] Do I have failures? I do. But my brother
[1:11:45] and sister, I cannot forget what he has
[1:11:48] done for me.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's there that this day that
[1:11:53] we remember Jesus Christ is our main
[1:11:56] thing.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; You hear that phrase out in the world.
[1:11:59] You know, I I've come across several
[1:12:01] little things recently here. You're in a
[1:12:03] store and somebody's like, "Oh, I've
[1:12:06] never met your husband before." And
[1:12:08] they're proud. They turn, "This is my
[1:12:10] main thing. This is the main man."
[1:12:13] You're thinking, "Is there another one?"
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; No. What they're saying is this the only
[1:12:17] one that's important right here.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. and they made an introduction.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; And I've also heard a little ahead of
[1:12:22] myself, but I've also heard recently
[1:12:24] Jesus is the reason for this season.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Well, my brother and sister sister, it
[1:12:29] doesn't start with a season. Doesn't end
[1:12:31] with the season. He is the main thing.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is who we are, what we are, why
[1:12:39] we live. The very essence of our life is
[1:12:42] Jesus Christ.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you look at that. I would go as
[1:12:46] far as to say
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; anything outside of that,
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; is a distraction.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Some distractions necessary. Scripture
[1:12:54] says if man doesn't work, he doesn't
[1:12:56] eat. But that job is a distraction.
[1:12:58] Let's face it.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; I mean,
[1:13:02] some of us are maybe certified
[1:13:04] workaholics,
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; but at my age, I've realized if I could,
[1:13:09] I would live without working.
[1:13:12] Do I get any amens?
[1:13:15] See, it it's there. It's it's what but
[1:13:18] we're so trained in the culture.
[1:13:22] Now, the scriptures wasn't really
[1:13:24] talking about Leodysia when he says that
[1:13:26] if you don't work, you don't eat. He's
[1:13:28] talking about breaking a spirit of being
[1:13:31] slothful, lazy, etc. A man who wouldn't
[1:13:34] care for his children, his wife, his
[1:13:37] household. Amen.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Right? That man is a repbate. That's
[1:13:41] according to the word.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Right? But it's not saying that we have
[1:13:45] to make a god out of work.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; So, we got to put work where it belongs.
[1:13:50] And it's actually quite a ways down the
[1:13:53] ladder. Amen. Of what God's called us to
[1:13:56] be or who he identifies us as. Now, I've
[1:14:00] been guilty, very guilty of that in my
[1:14:03] life. Amen. So, you know, sometimes
[1:14:05] we'll look at this and anything outside
[1:14:08] of our Lord Jesus Christ is a
[1:14:10] distraction.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Evil is a distraction. Amen.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; What is keeping us sometimes from
[1:14:15] actually having an overcoming life?
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Oursel.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say it kind of bluntly.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Ourselves.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Have just as many attributes expressed
[1:14:28] of evil.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; As they do of good.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Born in sin, shaped in iniquity. Yes,
[1:14:35] sir.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Come into the world lying, cheating, and
[1:14:37] stealing. Had a good time with the kids
[1:14:39] at Grace Kids. Amen. a fun time and we
[1:14:43] talked about this serpent brazen serpent
[1:14:45] in the wilderness had a few little
[1:14:47] rubber snakes and the kids got into that
[1:14:49] biting each other anyway. So, but it was
[1:14:53] fun. I I believe they got to the point.
[1:14:55] But you see, inherently we ourselves, we
[1:14:58] can't stand and say, "Oh, praise God.
[1:14:59] I'm such a good person."
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Because without the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:15:04] without the values that he placed in us,
[1:15:06] we would just be like the world. Amen.
[1:15:09] And you know sometimes good things can
[1:15:11] be so focused on we can focus so
[1:15:15] intently on them that good things can
[1:15:18] become a distraction.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; We we can be just doing the best things.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; And if they're not in balance,
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; it becomes a distraction to us.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. I remember many
[1:15:32] years ago, I don't speak ill of this
[1:15:34] man, but he made a decision that his
[1:15:36] wife could work while he stayed home and
[1:15:38] prayed and read the Bible. Amen. Sounded
[1:15:41] good on paper,
[1:15:44] just not on the page in the Bible,
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; So really what it was is he found an
[1:15:51] excuse not to go to work. So he focused
[1:15:53] on prayer and the Bible and forsook the
[1:15:56] other truths that were in the very book
[1:15:58] he was reading. The very truths of what
[1:16:00] he was doing to his wife to push her out
[1:16:03] there. Amen. Make her support the family
[1:16:06] while he stayed home
[1:16:09] and mowed the grass.
[1:16:12] And there was only I don't know three or
[1:16:14] four of them. The family. He made a big
[1:16:16] deal. Sisters don't throw things. He
[1:16:18] made a big deal about how he vacuumed
[1:16:21] the floor and washed the dishes. Now, he
[1:16:24] was using that as a justification to
[1:16:26] push his wife out of the house. Are you
[1:16:29] with me?
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; So, he was actually while he thought he
[1:16:33] was doing something good, he's actually
[1:16:34] pushing her out into a position God
[1:16:37] never called her to be in.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Now, we all know, let's not get into the
[1:16:42] whole sisters working thing. We know
[1:16:43] what the prophet of God said about that.
[1:16:45] But you see when that is caused by
[1:16:47] someone who just doesn't want to work
[1:16:49] himself,
[1:16:51] you'll see that that actually becomes
[1:16:52] evil.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; It becomes a distraction. Amen. And so
[1:16:57] these good things sometimes focused on
[1:16:59] incorrectly can also be to a distraction
[1:17:03] to us in our life. Now, brother Brandham
[1:17:05] says here in the sermon,
[1:17:08] looking for Jesus.
[1:17:15] Now, we want to speak uh as every
[1:17:17] meeting about Jesus Christ. And he's the
[1:17:20] center of our worship. Can we say as a
[1:17:22] church amen to that?
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; The center of our attraction, the center
[1:17:26] of our life, all that we have and want
[1:17:30] are and will be is based upon him.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we cannot when you take this a
[1:17:37] a as this phrase is nature abhores a
[1:17:40] vacuum right. So when we were intended
[1:17:42] to be worshippers and to serve the Lord
[1:17:45] Jesus Christ but yet we remove him it
[1:17:48] creates a vacuum there that vacuum will
[1:17:51] not remain empty. Something will fill
[1:17:54] that point. something will come in and
[1:17:57] it will then not cause a blessing in our
[1:18:00] life, but it actually is a little
[1:18:03] serpent. And that's why I brought up the
[1:18:04] the kids.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not every one of those serpents
[1:18:09] that were out there in the wilderness
[1:18:10] looked like some great big huge snake
[1:18:13] with huge fangs. There was some little
[1:18:14] ones.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; And some of those little ones I I I'm
[1:18:18] sorry. I just had kind of just a chuckle
[1:18:20] out of the kids. You know, they were
[1:18:23] expressing that they understood what I
[1:18:24] was talking about. Take that little
[1:18:26] snake and it's like
[1:18:31] then you ask the kids, "So, what is the
[1:18:34] snake bite?"
[1:18:36] You know, they got right down home. I
[1:18:38] mean, they didn't spare themselves at
[1:18:40] all.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; When we lie,
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; we've been bit by the snake, the
[1:18:45] serpent.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; When we And we went right down through
[1:18:48] the list. They didn't even spare
[1:18:50] themselves. I was so proud of them. Now,
[1:18:52] they might not have fully comprehended
[1:18:54] what they were saying, but I really
[1:18:55] honestly believe. Now, I'm going to go
[1:18:58] overboard here, not so much more so, but
[1:19:01] little brother Samuel stood right there
[1:19:02] and says, "Brother Paul, Brother Paul,
[1:19:03] Brother Paul." And he says, "What it was
[1:19:08] is the serpent when he bit." Now, this
[1:19:10] is the same serpent connected back to
[1:19:12] the Garden of Eden. The same one that
[1:19:15] was lying to Eve and deceived Eve and it
[1:19:19] was there. It doesn't say bitter, but he
[1:19:21] did, didn't he?
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah, he sure did. Yes, sir.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, look how these little things
[1:19:27] can come in our life. We say, "Praise
[1:19:29] God, I I'm serving the Lord." We got to
[1:19:32] watch out for the little serpent.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; We got to watch out for the little
[1:19:36] besetting sin that creeps in. Also, God
[1:19:40] help us. I lift my hand and say, "Lord,
[1:19:41] help me.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord." Because it's these
[1:19:44] little things, the little foxes that
[1:19:46] spoil the vine. And so we have a whole
[1:19:49] picture that God is wanting us to look
[1:19:52] at. Not just look at deep revelations.
[1:19:54] Oh, praise God. I can explain the
[1:19:56] thunders and the seals and the vials and
[1:19:59] I I can No, my brother and sister. This
[1:20:01] the serpent might be biting. Your legs
[1:20:03] might be just punctured full of holes
[1:20:05] and you still be able to explain those
[1:20:07] things. It won't do you a bit of good.
[1:20:10] No.
[1:20:12] So
[1:20:14] all that we have and want are and will
[1:20:17] be is based upon him. He was the one who
[1:20:19] came and gave his life for us, came down
[1:20:21] from God out of glory and was made
[1:20:23] flesh, dwelt among us and taken upon us
[1:20:26] upon him the sin of us all, the sickness
[1:20:29] of us all. Right there, my brother and
[1:20:32] sister, you can actually tie that right
[1:20:33] back to a brazen serpent.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. He took the sickness of the bite
[1:20:39] of Satan. Amen. The serpent, he took
[1:20:42] that and he took it away from us because
[1:20:45] I'll make a bold statement to say there
[1:20:47] wouldn't be one of us here this morning
[1:20:49] living if he did not take away the bite
[1:20:52] of the serpent.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. That bite has been nullified. The
[1:20:56] antivenenom, the word has come and left
[1:20:59] us living. Amen. Instead of dead.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:07] Bore it away to Calvary and there paid
[1:21:09] the price. He's worthy of all praise
[1:21:12] that be can be given him.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, sometimes when the song
[1:21:18] leader, maybe a minister, somebody says,
[1:21:19] "Hey, let's just worship the Lord. Let's
[1:21:21] give him praise." It's not about
[1:21:24] edifying what the man behind the pulpit
[1:21:26] is doing. It's about fulfilling this
[1:21:29] word that he is worthy of all of our
[1:21:33] praise. Amen. All that we can give him,
[1:21:36] he is worthy of that. It's not about
[1:21:39] who's right, who's wrong, who's more
[1:21:41] spiritual, who's more this, who's more
[1:21:44] that. It's about you and him and you
[1:21:47] recognizing I have no life but him.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; And I say thank you cuz I want to live.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; I want to rise up. I want to be what God
[1:21:58] called me to be.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; I kind of got ahead of myself. It's a
[1:22:05] time of year we hear this. Jesus is the
[1:22:07] reason for the season. He's the reason
[1:22:10] for every season in our life.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Spring, summer,
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; fall, winter. Amen. Take all of those to
[1:22:18] the seasons of your life. Not nature out
[1:22:21] here. To the seasons of your life, in
[1:22:24] the renewal time as you come in a
[1:22:27] maturity, as we start to fade away and
[1:22:30] the hard struggles that the winter can
[1:22:32] bring to us, he's there for us all the
[1:22:35] time. Amen. Our God is not a seasonal
[1:22:38] God.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; He is the very reason for our season.
[1:22:44] And what is our season, saints?
[1:22:46] The prophet of God clearly shows us that
[1:22:48] this season right now is a season of the
[1:22:51] maturing of the bride. She's coming into
[1:22:55] that season, into that place that she's
[1:22:57] no longer a babe, but now she can move
[1:23:01] away from the milk and she's now
[1:23:03] starting to get into a real diet. Amen.
[1:23:07] And it's not just a natural meat they're
[1:23:09] talking about, but it's talking about
[1:23:11] spiritual meat. And we're coming now.
[1:23:13] This is not something that requires, oh,
[1:23:15] they got to be this old to get into this
[1:23:18] spiritual meat. It is a spiritual
[1:23:20] maturity that brings you and I to a
[1:23:23] place that the word speaks to us. You
[1:23:25] can read that scripture and you can read
[1:23:27] it for years, but one day God says,
[1:23:29] "This is a season. This is a time. This
[1:23:31] is your trial. This is your
[1:23:33] circumstance. This is your desperation.
[1:23:36] This is your need." And the word comes
[1:23:38] alive to you and you say, "Thank you,
[1:23:40] Lord. I needed that right now." And the
[1:23:43] Lord would be here if he wanted to speak
[1:23:44] to you and say, "I know that.
[1:23:47] That's why I gave it to you. That's
[1:23:48] right.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Right now.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; So, this maturity bringing us to this
[1:23:53] place, what is it doing? It's moving us
[1:23:57] more. Now, God obviously, look at us
[1:23:59] today, saints.
[1:24:01] God obviously doesn't when he talks
[1:24:03] about his image talk about one facial
[1:24:06] profile.
[1:24:09] If so, who do we choose?
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; The only thing we can choose is his.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Otherwise, you
[1:24:17] know, if it was all this brother, this
[1:24:19] sister, this
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; No, no.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; But the word is coming molding the one
[1:24:25] thing that is of value.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Studying the scripture, my brother and
[1:24:31] sister, and then going back seeing what
[1:24:33] the prophet of God said about it. So,
[1:24:35] people have different ideas about burial
[1:24:37] and what will happen. But the prophet of
[1:24:39] God says, you know, those bones laying
[1:24:40] at the bottom of the sea.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; When he calls them,
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; they will come back. Amen.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; God don't care where those bones are.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; He's not redeeming bones.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. But what they are associated with
[1:24:56] or tied to, God's redeeming that. And
[1:24:58] it's God that is the restorer of all
[1:25:00] things. He's the one that restored our
[1:25:02] souls to him. He's the one that put us,
[1:25:04] brought us, created us. So, we don't
[1:25:06] need a natural image that we try to
[1:25:08] follow. But my brother and sister, now
[1:25:10] we all understand in the book uh uh uh
[1:25:13] talking about Shadrach, Meshach, and
[1:25:15] Abednego and the image that they were
[1:25:16] called to worship. I believe we should
[1:25:18] all understand that that image was
[1:25:20] Daniel,
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; right? There was a prophet and that was
[1:25:23] the image that they were being called
[1:25:25] was to worship the image of the prophet.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; And they said, "We won't do it." No.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Now, you'll never find nowhere where
[1:25:34] Daniel himself said, "Guys, there'll
[1:25:37] come a day just worship me."
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Daniel, a man of wisdom, led by the Holy
[1:25:44] Spirit, guided by God, a man of wisdom.
[1:25:47] He pointed the people constantly to God.
[1:25:51] Constantly to Jehovah. Constantly
[1:25:53] Jehovah. Now, I want to bring it right
[1:25:55] down. In the day we're living in, my
[1:25:57] brother and sister, we had a prophet of
[1:25:59] God that put it as words to the page and
[1:26:02] said, "I've never come to draw you to
[1:26:04] myself." Amen. I've always just wanted
[1:26:07] you to have a relationship with Jesus
[1:26:10] Christ. That's who I want to introduce
[1:26:12] you to is Jesus Christ. So you see the
[1:26:16] very same spirit that was there that was
[1:26:19] trying to get Shadrach and Mach to uh uh
[1:26:22] worship that image, that same spirits
[1:26:24] appeared in this day, my brother and
[1:26:26] sister. A little bite
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; of the serpent.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, but brother Paul, they live good
[1:26:35] lives.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; So the foolish virgin.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; I know that's kind of straightforward,
[1:26:41] but I think I think we ought to just
[1:26:43] face the truth. I think we ought to just
[1:26:45] face what the reality of the day we're
[1:26:47] living in.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; We're living in a day that those things
[1:26:50] that were typed in Joseph
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; are coming to pass today.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; So, it's there. We should be captivated
[1:26:59] in the revelation of the word for our
[1:27:02] day to realize God won't let you worship
[1:27:07] a false image.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. He's calling you as the
[1:27:12] bride of Jesus Christ to worship the
[1:27:15] true image which is him.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing else.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Now, I hope that wasn't offensive to
[1:27:22] anybody, but sometimes we just have to
[1:27:24] deal with these things because it's the
[1:27:26] truth. We have a perfect type right
[1:27:29] there in scripture. Brother Brandham
[1:27:30] even makes reference to it.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:27:35] we're looking here.
[1:27:39] Let's just go ahead and go to what is
[1:27:41] the attraction on the mountain mountain.
[1:27:43] God then what was he doing?
[1:27:46] What is that attraction up there on the
[1:27:49] hill?
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; It's God making history and God
[1:27:53] fulfilling prophecy.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; So twofold taking place right there,
[1:28:00] right? God is coming here. He's making
[1:28:03] history. You want to know saints this
[1:28:06] morning you are sitting here in the
[1:28:07] house of God. Whatever God's dealing
[1:28:09] with in your life, how your prayer life
[1:28:11] is, how you spiritually feel, all of
[1:28:13] this, you are making history today.
[1:28:17] Amen. And God's right here. He promised
[1:28:18] to be in our midst. Is he? I I think he
[1:28:21] is.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; I think he promised it and it'll happen.
[1:28:23] Amen. So, it's also prophecy being
[1:28:27] fulfilled that we'll sit here today and
[1:28:30] realize that the word prophesied the
[1:28:32] position we're in today. Amen.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes our own words, how
[1:28:36] many of you prophesy?
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; I think every single one of you ought to
[1:28:41] be lifting a hand. Amen. Amen. Your body
[1:28:44] will obey your confession. And your
[1:28:46] confession says, "I'm an overcomer."
[1:28:48] Then you're prophesying your future as
[1:28:51] an overcomer. If you say, "I am defeated
[1:28:54] or I can't do it." Your body will obey
[1:28:58] your own prophecy of the position you
[1:29:01] choose to take. Amen.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; And then people will say, "Well, later
[1:29:04] they'll say, "I knew I couldn't do it."
[1:29:06] Well, of course you prophesied you
[1:29:08] couldn't do it.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; But if you'll stand here today and say,
[1:29:11] "The word of God says, not me, not the
[1:29:14] preacher, no one else. The word of God
[1:29:16] says I'm an overcomer. I've got a seed
[1:29:19] gene in me. I've got his nature. I've
[1:29:22] got his character. I've got his
[1:29:23] attributes. I've even got his DNA in me.
[1:29:26] I will overcome."
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's it. Though all
[1:29:30] hail assail me, I shall not be moved.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; We can't do that in this flesh, saints.
[1:29:37] But I tell you, the word coming out of
[1:29:38] your own mouth will set you in a
[1:29:41] position that you can come and in the
[1:29:43] darkest of hours say, you know what?
[1:29:46] I've got a reason to be excited. I've
[1:29:48] got something. Because a revelation came
[1:29:51] to me and it wasn't a passing
[1:29:53] revelation. I was captivated by that
[1:29:55] revelation. God said it. I believed it.
[1:29:58] And I made it my own revelation. I made
[1:30:01] it my own confession and it captivated
[1:30:04] me. It caught my attention and it kept
[1:30:07] my attention.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; I don't care. Offer me a fleet of
[1:30:12] Cadillacs.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; I tell you, it's kind of interesting.
[1:30:18] So, Brother George Smith was down in
[1:30:19] Phoenix. He was there with brother Ron
[1:30:22] Peterson and they he was giving his
[1:30:23] testimony.
[1:30:25] And uh, of course, I I've had the
[1:30:27] privilege to know Brother George well
[1:30:28] enough to know testimony, not in its
[1:30:31] entirety, not to say boastfully I've got
[1:30:33] the whole thing, but I've heard a lot of
[1:30:35] it and I've heard it multiple times.
[1:30:38] Never changes. So, I'm kind of assuming
[1:30:40] it's the truth.
[1:30:43] I shouldn't have worded it that way. It
[1:30:44] is the truth. I don't have to assume.
[1:30:48] But brother George even addresses the
[1:30:49] Cadillac
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; and he says, "You know, Brother Bannon
[1:30:54] was embarrassed."
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; By that car.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; And he put it off to the side for the
[1:31:00] longest time until it wasn't the latest
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; fashion styling, whatever. And
[1:31:10] ultimately has a car. It's sitting
[1:31:13] there.
[1:31:14] It was comfortable. It was quiet. was
[1:31:17] all these things and he finally starts
[1:31:19] to drive it.
[1:31:23] Do you realize saints by brother Brown's
[1:31:26] testimony he could have had a fleet?
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; He was embarrassed to drive one that he
[1:31:34] let it sit around till it was aged.
[1:31:36] That's right.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; And he was embarrassed to drive it. He
[1:31:38] could have had a fleet.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You know that businessman that
[1:31:42] his wife got healed and he just tells
[1:31:44] Brother Brown, "You tell me what to
[1:31:46] write on this check."
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; And Brother Brown says, "I'd rather you
[1:31:49] not."
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; You see, my brother and sister, it
[1:31:52] wasn't for worldly gain.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; That he was coming. He was coming
[1:31:57] because there had to be a message that
[1:32:00] was trumpeted to the world today. But
[1:32:03] you know what? The trumpet is not that
[1:32:05] I'm just paraphrasing the scripture. The
[1:32:07] trumpeting of the trumpet is no
[1:32:09] importance if there's no one to hear the
[1:32:13] trumpet.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're here today. It's been
[1:32:16] trumpeted and we are hearing it and we
[1:32:18] are seeing it and it's coming to pass
[1:32:21] and our lives are reflecting it. And let
[1:32:23] me just put it this strongly. You don't
[1:32:25] have to say, "Well, I'm a believer." Cuz
[1:32:27] my brother and sister, we can stand here
[1:32:29] today and say, "I'm a believer." Because
[1:32:31] the very word that they said would come
[1:32:33] to pass is coming to pass in me. Amen.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; I don't have to look out here. I don't
[1:32:38] need to look at brother Brandham. I
[1:32:40] don't need to look at George Smith,
[1:32:41] Donnie Reagan, or anybody else. I can
[1:32:44] look right here at me and see the word
[1:32:47] coming to pass.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; And we should, every one of us, be able
[1:32:52] to say that that's what's happening to
[1:32:54] me. I actually see God dealing with me,
[1:32:57] God changing me, God raising me up into
[1:33:00] heavenly places.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:04] Amen.
[1:33:09] Then what was he doing? The attraction
[1:33:11] up there on the hill. God making
[1:33:12] history. God fulfilling prophecy. And
[1:33:14] that always causes an attraction.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; How many times mothers
[1:33:21] I mean I don't know. I just we saw this
[1:33:23] happen when we were raising our children
[1:33:27] in a restaurant. People would say, "You
[1:33:29] have the best behaved children
[1:33:33] we've ever seen." And you almost want
[1:33:36] like really
[1:33:41] you just caught them at a good moment.
[1:33:44] Maybe you weren't looking at my
[1:33:45] children.
[1:33:48] But you see, even and my point I want to
[1:33:51] make, even down into our children,
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; there's a reflection of Jesus Christ.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's become so common
[1:33:59] to us,
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; we maybe don't even recognize it in our
[1:34:04] children, in our wife, in our husband,
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; in our fellow church members.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Bram said, "When a
[1:34:13] church loses its love,
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; that's the finish of that church."
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Saints, until the Lord comes, I'm not
[1:34:20] ready for Grace Tabernacle to be done
[1:34:22] away with, become cold, dead, formal.
[1:34:25] Let's fall in love with one another
[1:34:27] correctly, of course. Let's let's be in
[1:34:29] love with one another, lifting each
[1:34:30] other up before the Lord. Amen. Caring
[1:34:33] about what's happening in the lives of
[1:34:35] those around us. That's what makes a
[1:34:37] live, vibrant church.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Not who wears the best clothes or drives
[1:34:43] the best car.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; So, it's there you see
[1:34:55] that always calls an attraction. It
[1:34:56] brings all the critics up, the vultures
[1:35:00] in parentheses of this morning's
[1:35:02] message.
[1:35:04] Praise God. I hope none of you are that
[1:35:05] hard on me.
[1:35:07] And the eagles also may come together to
[1:35:10] find out what's going on. Some coming
[1:35:14] for curiosity.
[1:35:16] Now look, I don't know who's going to be
[1:35:18] the bride of Christ and who isn't.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; But we've had our share of the curious
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; pass through our church.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; So much so, maybe I'll boast on the
[1:35:31] preacher for just a moment. You guys
[1:35:32] don't mind if we boast on the pastor of
[1:35:34] the church.
[1:35:36] I've literally after this service, most
[1:35:38] everyone's left, had people speak to my
[1:35:41] face and say, "You're the most
[1:35:43] incredible pastor I've ever heard. I'll
[1:35:47] see you next Sunday."
[1:35:49] What I realized later, Brother Trevor,
[1:35:52] is next Sunday,
[1:35:55] depends on where you're on the calendar
[1:35:57] here.
[1:36:00] So, what do those words mean?
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:36:05] So somebody saying, "I'm so blessed."
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Really doesn't mean much.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; It's what it actually does to them
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; that makes the difference.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not how they emotionally felt at
[1:36:18] the moment.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; But how they felt deep down inside
[1:36:24] in their time alone.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; And God dealing with them. See, so they
[1:36:29] come together. Some for curiosity. Some
[1:36:32] coming to find fault, others coming
[1:36:35] criticize. There's all kinds gathered.
[1:36:37] As we said this morning, believers make
[1:36:39] believers, unbelievers, what's on the
[1:36:41] mountain. And this is my real focus of
[1:36:44] this quote. Prophecy is being fulfilled.
[1:36:48] Now, we'll see what takes place.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Prophecy
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; being fulfilled.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Exactly.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; What takes place.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. The real bride of Christ says,
[1:37:05] "That's who I always thought I was
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; and now I see that's who I am."
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It went from a thought to a
[1:37:16] reality. Amen. And when that reality
[1:37:19] come and was expressed, we don't stand
[1:37:21] up and say, "Praise God, I'm such a good
[1:37:23] Christian. I'm such a good believer."
[1:37:25] No, we say, "Oh Lord," we humble
[1:37:28] ourselves. Lord, thank you. What you've
[1:37:30] done for me, Lord. I couldn't have done
[1:37:33] it. It's a prophecy of your word. It's
[1:37:35] what your word for foretold is coming
[1:37:38] out in me.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; And we could say, I'm not even
[1:37:44] trying to make it happen.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; That's it. Exactly.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; It's just happening.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my, my brother and sister, how
[1:37:52] beautiful that is.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:57] See, prophecy fulfilled. The word
[1:37:59] prophesied it would call out a people.
[1:38:01] Amen.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I would ask you this morning, is
[1:38:05] there some here today that have a
[1:38:07] conviction that you were called out?
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not just here by chance.
[1:38:12] There's a conviction down in our heart.
[1:38:14] There's something solid down in our
[1:38:16] heart that says, "I know I was called
[1:38:20] out."
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know it was that voice. Amen. as
[1:38:24] the eagle and the and the the mama eagle
[1:38:26] and the young eagle. Amen. He always
[1:38:28] wondered, can you imagine what it'd be?
[1:38:30] I one day I just sat there and listened
[1:38:32] to some chickens, you know, and there
[1:38:34] was two or three kinds uh my daughter
[1:38:36] Kristen had there and there was these
[1:38:38] little guys that had their hair all
[1:38:40] whipped up in a wave, you know, and they
[1:38:42] just strutdded around like they were
[1:38:43] just the best little but they were just
[1:38:45] little guys.
[1:38:47] And then there was a big guy that was
[1:38:49] kind of ugly. walked around crowing,
[1:38:52] crowing, crowing like I'm the king of
[1:38:54] this roost, but he was kind of ugly,
[1:38:59] you know. And as the brother Brian Jones
[1:39:02] would say, your eagles aren't even real
[1:39:05] message eagles.
[1:39:07] What?
[1:39:09] Yeah. Look at him. Look at our eagle.
[1:39:12] He's talking about a man. He's got legs
[1:39:16] on all the way down to his feet. Your
[1:39:19] American eagles are running around in
[1:39:21] shorts. They're not even real eagles.
[1:39:26] Well, good revelation, brother Brian. He
[1:39:28] if you go there today, he'll tell you
[1:39:30] that. I guarantee you that's something
[1:39:32] he holds to. We don't even have a real
[1:39:34] eagle. They have the real eagle. Amen.
[1:39:37] So, you look at that, you see, my
[1:39:38] brother and sister, what image are we
[1:39:40] being molded to? What are we being
[1:39:42] drawn? Are we forced by the preaching
[1:39:45] here in the church to be a certain way?
[1:39:48] Or is there something calling,
[1:39:52] something pulling,
[1:39:54] something that you can't resist?
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; I can assure you, you can resist
[1:39:59] whatever I would speak. But when God,
[1:40:02] the Holy Spirit starts to deal with your
[1:40:04] life, you can't resist.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word is captivating you. Amen.
[1:40:09] It's the Holy Spirit that's drawing you
[1:40:11] in.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's the word that's held your
[1:40:14] attention.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My brother and sister, I
[1:40:18] tell you, it's it's so interesting how
[1:40:20] it is. I remember from my childhood some
[1:40:23] of the first words, first time my
[1:40:25] family, they ever come went sat down to
[1:40:27] listen to a tape. And you got to
[1:40:29] understand, we were pretty wild,
[1:40:31] rambunctious kids. And I remember my
[1:40:33] dad, I'm not defaulting on my dad, but
[1:40:35] just the words that he said, "If you
[1:40:36] boys don't behave, I'll whip you when we
[1:40:38] get home." Amen. That was enough. He
[1:40:41] knew how to whoop a kid. Amen. But I
[1:40:43] remember sitting on a floor in our
[1:40:45] friend's house and hearing those words
[1:40:47] for the first time. Good morning,
[1:40:50] friends.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; That's it, sir.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Now, that echo is still in my mind to
[1:40:54] this day.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; And back then, I was just a kid. It
[1:40:58] didn't register. Now, I realize
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; he was talking to me.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; I'm a friend of the Lord.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when I get to glory, I'll be
[1:41:10] able to say, I'm a friend of the
[1:41:11] prophet.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Because I am a friend of the
[1:41:14] word.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's there that God is using
[1:41:17] this to put us in the right place. Amen.
[1:41:20] So the word attracted you. The word held
[1:41:23] your attention. Was it a single
[1:41:24] doctrine? Was it baptism that caught
[1:41:27] you? Was it the thunders that caught
[1:41:29] you? Thunders caught a lot of people but
[1:41:31] caught them. They kind of caught them in
[1:41:33] the tail or, you know, the fin or
[1:41:36] whatever because they're not really
[1:41:38] caught.
[1:41:41] Oh. Oh, what could it be that caught
[1:41:44] you?
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Christ himself.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Even when you go back in scripture and
[1:41:52] you see that they told them you'd be
[1:41:53] fishers of men.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the apostles catching them.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; It was the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:42:00] catching them.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if if it had been Peter
[1:42:04] that caught them, then ultimately Peter
[1:42:07] would have lost them. Cuz Peter, you got
[1:42:09] to remember, was pretty rough around the
[1:42:11] edges. Amen. Sooner or later, he'd have
[1:42:13] said something that would have offended
[1:42:15] them and they'd have said, "This guy's
[1:42:16] too much."
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; But when you ever get caught by the
[1:42:20] gospel,
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; the word of God in your hour,
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; you are so so so captivated.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; It has caught your attention and it's
[1:42:30] kept a hold of you and you can't get
[1:42:32] away from it. And I say that here not to
[1:42:35] be on a negative side, but how many
[1:42:37] times have we through the years said, "I
[1:42:38] don't think I can go any further. I just
[1:42:40] can't do this. I'm going to quit." Amen.
[1:42:43] I know that's a pre we call it preachers
[1:42:45] flu. Ah, worst sermon I ever preached.
[1:42:48] I'm quitting.
[1:42:49] And then Wednesday night, you got more
[1:42:51] notes than you can possibly preach
[1:42:53] again.
[1:42:55] And then after Wednesday night, you have
[1:42:57] preachers flu again.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; It's a good deal that flu don't kill
[1:43:00] you. Amen. But you see what it is is we
[1:43:04] are in this battle of the spiritual
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; and the flesh.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; That's exactly
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; spiritual flesh. Every one of you faces
[1:43:11] this battle. Spiritual flesh. Spiritual
[1:43:15] flesh.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:19] But imagine now you've heard me say this
[1:43:22] before. It's and I'm not the first to
[1:43:24] ever preach it. When the prophet of God
[1:43:27] saw, he hears this onward Christian
[1:43:29] soldier and he sees this church coming
[1:43:32] and she's dressed horribly.
[1:43:35] Go read
[1:43:37] what brother Ram's talking about that
[1:43:38] vision
[1:43:40] how he describes it.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; That's today.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; When he preached that,
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; they'd arrested somebody for dressing
[1:43:52] like that in public.
[1:43:55] But there they are. I don't want to go
[1:43:57] in depth too much. Barely covered,
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; indecent.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Uh just horrible.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; And now that can be seen on any street
[1:44:07] in any city in any country.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; I'll give you an idea about that, my
[1:44:14] brother and sister. I will share this
[1:44:15] enough. A few years ago, Argentina, we
[1:44:18] drove down into the far reaches of
[1:44:20] Patagonia. We went out there. There was
[1:44:23] some believers that had people had been
[1:44:25] introduced to the message, lived out
[1:44:26] there. And so we went there, rented the
[1:44:29] town hall. We held services there. And I
[1:44:32] was had this just crazy idea that we're
[1:44:35] so far out in the boonies that that it
[1:44:38] won't be, you know, anything. It'll just
[1:44:40] be somehow different.
[1:44:43] We walked into the little market. The
[1:44:45] girl behind the cash register looked
[1:44:48] like she belonged in Nampa, Idaho at
[1:44:50] Circle K.
[1:44:52] I didn't mean to defame you, Circle K.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; See, it's the same spirit.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; It is.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; And the music coming through the
[1:45:00] speakers
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; was the same exact music that would be
[1:45:03] coming through the speakers right here.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; So, just as the Holy Spirit's moving all
[1:45:09] around the world, the antichrist spirit
[1:45:12] has reached every back eddy, every place
[1:45:15] there is to reach because no one's going
[1:45:17] to be without excuse on that day. You
[1:45:20] will not have an excuse. You'll either
[1:45:23] be in Christ. Amen. Captivated by the
[1:45:25] word or you're going to be outside.
[1:45:27] That's exactly.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's just a simple fact of it. I
[1:45:30] don't say that judgmental because I'm
[1:45:32] still working on making sure that my
[1:45:34] salvation is secure. Amen. We're not
[1:45:36] looking down our nose at anybody. But
[1:45:38] we're still doing what God asked us to
[1:45:41] do.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, look at this. We don't want to
[1:45:44] be distracted, right? You are part of
[1:45:46] this prophecy. Don't get distracted from
[1:45:49] that. I don't understand this. I don't
[1:45:51] see this. I struggle here. Don't get
[1:45:53] distracted. You are part of this
[1:45:55] prophecy. And this prophecy must come to
[1:45:58] pass.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; You see, can we cut it right down to
[1:46:03] super simple?
[1:46:06] What this book told us
[1:46:10] is that Christ wanted a bride.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want a girlfriend.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. A girlfriend implies that
[1:46:21] she can be set aside.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; And another one can be drawn in to take
[1:46:28] her place.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; This is how the boyfriend girlfriend
[1:46:32] relationship exists in the world today.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Now, let let me just deviate from this
[1:46:37] so I don't leave the wrong thought in
[1:46:39] kids' minds. We don't court. We don't
[1:46:43] date for fun.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; We have already prayed. We have already
[1:46:48] sought God. We have already asked God,
[1:46:50] is this the right one?
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; And then when you have the law of
[1:46:55] attraction, remember we talked about
[1:46:56] that earlier. I know it was a long time
[1:46:58] ago today, but we talked about that
[1:47:00] earlier. Amen. There's got to be a law
[1:47:02] of attraction.
[1:47:04] Oh, she has the most beautiful blue
[1:47:07] eyes. Now, those of you have blue eyes,
[1:47:09] don't be offended.
[1:47:12] She's meaner than a bag of tom cats.
[1:47:17] that she has the most beautiful blue
[1:47:20] eyes. I could just stare into them eyes
[1:47:24] until the tom cats get loose.
[1:47:28] That ain't going to work.
[1:47:32] Oh, he's got such beautiful curly hair.
[1:47:38] And then you wake up one day, he has no
[1:47:41] hair.
[1:47:43] Those
[1:47:46] are not the reasons
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; that we're attracted that we're
[1:47:50] captivated by that person. The prophet
[1:47:52] makes it so clear. You're captivated
[1:47:54] because I see Christ in that young
[1:47:56] woman. I see Christ in that young man.
[1:47:59] And yes, I have an attraction to them.
[1:48:01] They are beautiful. And not always is it
[1:48:04] in the flesh, right? Character is so
[1:48:06] incredible. Character can make a average
[1:48:09] girl, I'm going to get in trouble for
[1:48:10] this, but character can make an average
[1:48:13] girl beautiful.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And character will make a
[1:48:17] run-of-the-mill, you know, pugnosed, you
[1:48:20] know, two small ears, two big ears guy
[1:48:23] be the greatest husband ever on the face
[1:48:25] of the earth. Character will do that.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what age will do though.
[1:48:31] We won't even go there. Yeah.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:37] Yeah.
[1:48:39] So,
[1:48:41] Christ wants a bride. He wants a wife,
[1:48:43] not a girlfriend.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; And this wife is going to be so
[1:48:47] captivated by the revelation of him.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Now, let's get down to the root word of
[1:48:53] revelation. What is that? The revealing
[1:48:56] of him.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Not the idea of what he can give me.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; That's exactly
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; what he can do for me. but who he really
[1:49:05] is. Amen. Being poured out. And this
[1:49:08] bride is being captivated by someone he
[1:49:11] can love. Even me.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. He cares about even me.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; He will save even me. He will heal even
[1:49:22] me. He will give even me a sound mind.
[1:49:26] He will come and do this even for me.
[1:49:28] Can someone say even for me? Amen. And
[1:49:32] he'll do this even for you.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And she's captivated by that. Not
[1:49:39] by who she is.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; But who she is in him.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; I come across a deal some time back. I
[1:49:48] had to read it out of curiosity.
[1:49:52] And the article was written,
[1:49:55] "Why do beautiful women
[1:49:59] marry ugly men?"
[1:50:03] Wouldn't that catch your attention to
[1:50:04] read the article? I mean, I'm just like,
[1:50:07] "Okay, I'm a sucker. I'm I'm hookline
[1:50:09] and sinker.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Why Why do beautiful women?" And they
[1:50:12] weren't implying beautiful as in the
[1:50:15] sexy, flashy, whatever, but they were
[1:50:16] just talking about women with natural
[1:50:18] beauty. And it wasn't but a few days
[1:50:20] after I read that article, Sister Jerry
[1:50:22] and I are in town and uh it was the
[1:50:24] opposite.
[1:50:26] Here is this tall, very
[1:50:28] athletic-looking, handsome man. And I'm
[1:50:32] going to get in trouble for put saying
[1:50:33] it this way, but he was married to a
[1:50:35] wife who registered as 44,
[1:50:38] four feet tall, four feet wide.
[1:50:51] And I'm like,
[1:50:56] the children look like him
[1:50:59] and her. Yeah, that's definitely his
[1:51:02] wife.
[1:51:04] And he come back with some things in his
[1:51:06] hands in the store.
[1:51:08] Sis Sister said, "Well, Jerry's right
[1:51:10] here. This won't be so awkward." He
[1:51:13] comes back with some things in his hands
[1:51:14] down the aisle. I got these sweetheart
[1:51:22] and I thought this man is totally in
[1:51:26] love with his wife.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; He was I'm I I'm just describing, you
[1:51:34] know, here's this guy. He's like 6'2 or
[1:51:37] three, just well built, good-looking.
[1:51:41] And I thought, there it is.
[1:51:45] Why do beautiful women marry ugly men?
[1:51:50] You know what they summed the whole
[1:51:51] thing up? They could have used the
[1:51:53] prophet's words.
[1:51:56] Character.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; That's it right there.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; What that beautiful woman married him
[1:52:02] for was his character.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what that man married, that
[1:52:09] wife that I saw with my own four eyes.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Character.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Want to drive this home. What does this
[1:52:20] bride see in her husband?
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Character.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; And what does the Lord Jesus Christ see
[1:52:28] in his bride?
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Character.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. You see, my brother and
[1:52:33] sister, not the flashiest, not the
[1:52:35] smartest, not this, not that, but
[1:52:37] character.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; And imagine now
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; when we're young,
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; brothers, young men,
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; we're too dumb to recognize
[1:52:50] what we're actually marrying.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; That make sense?
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; We don't have a clue.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Here's the girl here. Again, not to
[1:52:58] offend anybody, Sister Jared. just
[1:53:01] I didn't even figure out she was
[1:53:02] left-handed till we'd already said I do.
[1:53:05] Not that that would have stopped me from
[1:53:07] marrying her, but
[1:53:10] but then look at your life as you go on.
[1:53:12] There was something in you. The little
[1:53:14] boy eating the pedal off the bicycle, he
[1:53:17] didn't even know he needed sulfur, but
[1:53:18] he was looking for sulfur. And when you
[1:53:21] have a marriage that is sanctioned of
[1:53:23] God, you didn't even realize everything
[1:53:27] I'm deficient of.
[1:53:30] in the natural is in her.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; And everything she's deficient of
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; is in me.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Now, let's take this out into our
[1:53:39] spiritual relationship.
[1:53:41] The Lord Jesus wanted someone to love
[1:53:44] him.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; He wanted someone to look at him and
[1:53:47] say, "You're so beautiful. You're so
[1:53:49] wonderful." Someone who would give him
[1:53:51] praise and honor. He's not narcissistic.
[1:53:54] He's not egotistical
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; no more than we love it when the Lord
[1:53:59] Jesus comes down and deals with us.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; And he's expressing, "I love you."
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I will give you even to the half
[1:54:10] of my kingdom.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Go back, reread Esther. Read it from a
[1:54:14] different point of view. You'll realize
[1:54:16] God was laying out right in front of you
[1:54:19] and I our relationship with Jesus
[1:54:21] Christ. Approach me at any time. You've
[1:54:24] got half of my kingdom. What can I do
[1:54:27] for you? You ask this. Your position is
[1:54:30] given.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother and sister, there's what
[1:54:34] God's doing. No, we get into this. I'm a
[1:54:37] Christian. I'm trying to serve God. I
[1:54:39] fail him. I'm hoping he he loves me. I
[1:54:42] hope he I don't lose I hope I don't
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Come on. Get over it.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Get over your carnal self.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Get to a place that you are
[1:54:54] captivated by your bridegroom.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not getting rid of you.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; He's not going to forget that he owns
[1:55:02] you. Or well, I shouldn't use it that
[1:55:04] word, but he does have the title deed.
[1:55:07] Okay, so you'll understand. Amen. Forget
[1:55:09] that. It's a love affair.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Are we reciprocating?
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Are we in a love affair?
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's Or are we just trying to be
[1:55:20] good little Christians towing a mark
[1:55:24] trying somehow to believe please a God
[1:55:27] that we think is judgmental
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; that called us to watch us fail called
[1:55:33] us to watch us fall.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; That's not my God.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; He's captivated with you.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; And we should be captivated with him.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Alex, save me. Help me.
[1:55:49] Amen.
[1:55:54] Now, I'm going to do a complete shift
[1:55:55] here if you don't mind. Um, super sign.
[1:56:00] The age that we live in,
[1:56:05] such an interesting thing.
[1:56:08] United States is now attacking Venezuela
[1:56:13] because they have drugs on a boat.
[1:56:16] They've had drugs on boats for 40 years.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Why now?
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; There's rare earth minerals. There's oil
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; influence.
[1:56:32] And Putin stands up and says,
[1:56:36] "I won't put up with it.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; We will stop that."
[1:56:43] those dreaded communists.
[1:56:46] Oh my
[1:56:48] saints. I can give you a 1-800 number a
[1:56:50] company that makes bunkers. If you got
[1:56:52] enough backyard, you can have a bunker
[1:56:53] in your backyard.
[1:56:56] Or we could read this quote and see
[1:56:57] really what we need to worry about.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; And you people, I've got to say this.
[1:57:03] Don't you let anybody poke something
[1:57:05] down your back about communism.
[1:57:08] Communism is nothing. Amen.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; It's just a tool in God's hands.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; That's it. Amen. That's right.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, Mr. Trump, the last Trump, he's
[1:57:21] going to save America. No, I'm sorry.
[1:57:24] He's just a tool
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; in God's hands.
[1:57:30] I want any Bible reader, any prophet to
[1:57:32] stand and show me where the Bible ever
[1:57:34] says that communism will rule.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; It isn't communism that's going to rule.
[1:57:39] It's Romanism that's going to rule.
[1:57:41] According to the Bible, let me say this
[1:57:44] in closing. There's three great curtains
[1:57:46] today. One of them is the iron curtain.
[1:57:49] The other one is a bamboo curtain. So,
[1:57:51] we we see here uh Russia iron curtain.
[1:57:55] China bamboo curtain. Amen. And the
[1:57:58] other one is a purple curtain. You wash
[1:58:01] that one. That's the one that's going to
[1:58:03] rule. Can't you see the whole thing
[1:58:05] facing right into it? the church getting
[1:58:08] unless there comes a falling away,
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; the man of sin can't reveal himself.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Look what God's doing.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Saints, don't be worried about you. Oh,
[1:58:19] I'm not a good enough Christian. Just be
[1:58:22] a Christian.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; God will place in you. The word already
[1:58:27] says that he's given every man their
[1:58:31] measure of faith.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't sit here and say, "If I just
[1:58:34] had more faith." Just say, "Lord, let
[1:58:36] the faith that's already in me. Lord,
[1:58:38] let that faith come out. Let it be
[1:58:40] expressed. Let that faith come alive in
[1:58:43] me cuz it's already in me.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; I'm not out here searching for faith. I
[1:58:49] need to search for a position where I
[1:58:51] can humble myself before the Lord and he
[1:58:54] will reveal himself."
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. That's right.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. The church getting unless
[1:59:00] there come a falling away, the man of
[1:59:01] sin can't reveal himself. The
[1:59:03] communists, the lukewarmness of the
[1:59:05] church, the insignificant
[1:59:07] walk around God have mercy. Said in that
[1:59:11] day, he'd send a super sign among them.
[1:59:14] Amen.
[1:59:17] A super sign.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Wow. You know, we need to all run off in
[1:59:22] the desert. You see how how old this
[1:59:24] story is? You guys need to come with me
[1:59:27] now. If you trust Brother Paul, we've
[1:59:29] got to go live out here in the Aahes in
[1:59:32] the desert, and that's the only place
[1:59:34] God's going to meet us.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. Let me gather this crowd. We're
[1:59:38] going to go over here and live in this
[1:59:40] wilderness.
[1:59:41] No, sir. No, sir. God said, "I want you
[1:59:44] to go right down in the middle." Look at
[1:59:46] the Apostle Paul. He could have run and
[1:59:49] he hid. And instead, he let himself be
[1:59:52] taken right down into Rome.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:56] because he knew he could live and shine
[2:00:00] and overcome.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; In the midst of Rome.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Said in that day he'd
[2:00:07] send a super sign among them. He'd call
[2:00:10] a people for his name's sake. That's it.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; There's the super sign. Oh my brother
[2:00:16] and sister, that calling,
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; of those people for his name's sake. You
[2:00:21] are the reflection
[2:00:23] of a super sign. that has come to pass.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; Not a doctrine to run to a wilderness
[2:00:29] with, but the word being made known and
[2:00:32] a people who are being brought into a
[2:00:36] state of complete adoration, complete
[2:00:40] love, being completely captivated by the
[2:00:43] word for this hour.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can go back and study what Paul
[2:00:47] said. Brother Brandham says, "I'm
[2:00:48] preaching what Paul preached." But
[2:00:49] brother Brandham actually expounded what
[2:00:52] Paul preached. Amen. He didn't have a
[2:00:54] new gospel, but he expounded it. Amen.
[2:00:57] You know, after all, the atom, you know,
[2:00:59] the cell
[2:01:01] has always been with us.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; But one day, they revealed it.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; The seed gene of Jesus Christ has always
[2:01:10] been with us.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; And now it's being revealed.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand. God bless you. Thank
[2:01:17] you for your patience this morning.
[2:01:20] Hopefully, I wasn't too excited.
[2:01:24] Amen. I still have a whole bunch to
[2:01:25] preach here. I was going to preach the
[2:01:27] 27th Psalm all over again and make it
[2:01:29] real for our day right here. Amen.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. That we could stand here and not
[2:01:33] read it as a scripture, but read it
[2:01:35] present tense.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; The Lord is my light.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; And my salvation.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Whom shall I fear?
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; We could go through it, but you can take
[2:01:46] it home. If you believe in homework from
[2:01:48] church, just take it home, reread it,
[2:01:50] put yourself directly in there. Amen.
[2:01:53] Let it be real to you today. Hallelujah.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Absolutely right.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. Amen.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; 24 brother Isaac, peace of God, cover
[2:02:04] me.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad? Hallelujah.
[2:02:11] Peace of God, cover me.
[2:02:19] Oh, cover me.
[2:02:25] Cover
[2:02:26] me. Just let him cover you today.
[2:02:31] Peace of God, cover me.
[2:02:39] All through the storm.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, cover me.
[2:02:50] Peace of God, cover me.
[2:02:58] Oh, cover me.
[2:03:04] Cover me.
[2:03:10] Peace of God, cover me.
[2:03:18] Oh, through the storm.
[2:03:23] Oh, cover me.
[2:03:29] Only in you I am saved.
[2:03:38] Only in you I'm secure.
[2:03:47] Only in you I find peace.
[2:03:54] So cover
[2:03:56] me. Just let the Lord know that your
[2:03:59] heart
[2:04:00] cover me.
[2:04:05] Cover me when I am hurting.
[2:04:10] Cover me when I'm not strong.
[2:04:14] Cover me when I am going through the
[2:04:20] storm.
[2:04:23] Cover me when all seems hopeless.
[2:04:28] Cover me when my faith is gone.
[2:04:32] Let the peace that passes all I
[2:04:37] understand.
[2:04:41] Cover
[2:04:43] me.
[2:04:48] Oh, cover me when I am hurting.
[2:04:53] Cover me when I'm not strong.
[2:04:58] Cover me when I am going through the
[2:05:04] storm.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Cover me when all seems hopeless.
[2:05:12] Cover me when my faith is gone.
[2:05:16] Let the peace that passes all I
[2:05:21] understand.
[2:05:25] Cover me.
[2:05:30] Cover me.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; You know what it's saying? Lord, I just
[2:05:36] need you to cover me all the time.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. 890. Brother Isaac. Amen.
[2:05:44] Hallelujah.
[2:05:47] You know, as I was studying this
[2:05:49] thought, this song took on a little more
[2:05:51] meaning to me.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. That's exactly right.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; When I grow cold,
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; you ever have that time? It's like you
[2:06:00] get up in the morning, it's like, I need
[2:06:02] to read my Bible.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; I'll read it at lunchtime.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; That little iceberg
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. floating in there saying, "It's
[2:06:14] not important enough to do it now."
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; I'll do it later.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; But you know, lunchtime comes, the
[2:06:22] wheels have fallen off the wagon, the
[2:06:24] cows jumped over the fence,
[2:06:27] and you're laying your head on the
[2:06:28] pillow.
[2:06:30] I didn't read my Bible.
[2:06:34] Oh
