[0:31] [Music]
[1:53] Oh yeah.
[1:55] [Music]
[4:11] Heat. Heat.
[4:15] [Music]
[7:54] This is your house.
[8:00] Father, come and
[8:04] dwell. This is your
[8:09] house, a holy house of
[8:14] prayer, where the lost and the
[8:19] lonely bring their burdens and their
[8:24] cares. This is your house.
[8:29] [Music]
[8:30] This is your
[8:33] [Music]
[8:34] house. Come and
[8:39] dwell.
[8:41] Amen. Good to be here this evening.
[8:43] Amen. Good to see sister Andrea, Sister
[8:46] Alice. God bless you. Good to see you
[8:49] guys. Sister April, it's good to see
[8:50] you, too. I guess it's been a
[8:54] while. Nice to have visitors with us
[8:56] today.
[8:57] God bless each one of you. Amen.
[9:00] Hallelujah. I'd like to start with uh on
[9:02] Christ the solid rock. I was just
[9:04] singing that today in the
[9:11] car. My hope is built on nothing less
[9:17] than Jesus blood and righteousness.
[9:22] I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but
[9:28] holy lean on Jesus
[9:32] name. On Christ the
[9:36] soly rock I stand. All other ground is
[9:42] sinking
[9:43] sand. All other ground is sinking sand.
[9:51] When darkness seems to hide his face, I
[9:56] rest on his unchanging grace. In every
[10:03] high and stormy gale, my anchor holds
[10:09] within the
[10:11] veil. On Christ the
[10:14] solid rock I stand. All other ground is
[10:20] sinking
[10:22] sand. All other ground is sinking
[10:28] sand. His oath his
[10:32] covenant and his blood support me in the
[10:38] whelming flood. Then all my round my
[10:43] soul gives way. He then is all my hope
[10:48] and
[10:49] stay. On Christ the
[10:53] solid rock I stand. All other ground is
[10:59] sinking
[11:00] sand. All other ground is sinking sand.
[11:07] when he shall come with trumpet sound.
[11:13] Oh, may I then in him be found, trust in
[11:19] his
[11:21] righteousness alone, faultless to stand
[11:25] before the
[11:28] throne. On Christ the
[11:31] solid rock I stand. All other ground is
[11:37] sinking
[11:39] sand. All other ground is sinking
[11:45] sand.
[11:47] Amen. Amen. I know when I go hiking, I
[11:51] like to have firm footing.
[11:53] Amen. Definitely in my spiritual life.
[11:56] Hallelujah. Amen.

[20:25] [Music]
[20:27] done. Amen. Do you believe that this
[20:30] evening? Praise the Lord. Amen.
[20:34] I wanted to give a little little
[20:37] testimony here before we go to prayer
[20:38] this
[20:39] evening. I um we've been having some car
[20:43] trouble.
[20:45] And you probably don't know this, but I
[20:48] love working on cars. I say that very
[20:50] sarcastically. Um working on cars makes
[20:54] me think very not very nice thoughts
[20:55] about the people that make cars and
[20:57] people that design cars.
[20:59] And so I I don't really like working on
[21:02] cars.
[21:04] Um, our Escape broke down a while back.
[21:07] The steering went out in it and uh um
[21:11] sometimes can be a when it comes to
[21:13] working on cars because I don't like
[21:14] working on cars. I am a bit of a u
[21:17] Debbie
[21:18] Downer. Oh, it's toast. Get rid of
[21:21] it. But I don't like spending money
[21:24] either. So,
[21:27] um so when the steering went out, I was
[21:30] like, "Well, we should probably get rid
[21:31] of it. I looked it up on, you know,
[21:35] Google and
[21:37] uh, oh, you know, that part's a couple
[21:40] thousand bucks or whatever it was and
[21:42] that car is not worth that to me. Let's
[21:44] get rid of it. And then I waited and I
[21:46] talked to the neighbor and he's kind of
[21:47] a mechanic guy. He's like, I think it's
[21:48] probably the sensor. It's probably just
[21:49] a sensor. Sensor is only $50. I'm like,
[21:51] oh, okay. Get on there, look look some
[21:54] things up. Yeah, I could probably fix
[21:55] that. Well, it had been parked all this
[21:57] time. This has gone over months now. And
[21:59] the
[22:00] uh so I go out there to start it up and
[22:04] battery is dead. Okay, battery's dead.
[22:06] Great. Okay, go get a new battery. Put
[22:08] the battery in there. Everything looks
[22:11] like it's going to fire up now. It won't
[22:12] start now. Okay.
[22:17] Um,
[22:19] so it sat probably another month or two
[22:22] in the meantime and
[22:26] uh I uh we I started looking at cars
[22:29] again and we went me and my wife went
[22:32] out and looked looked at cars and I'm
[22:33] like, man, I don't really feel like
[22:34] spending 20 or $30,000 on a new car. You
[22:37] know, I just drive this thing till the
[22:39] wheels fall off. And uh that was uh that
[22:43] was Friday night. go home Friday night
[22:45] and I got up that morning
[22:47] and I said I thought to myself, you
[22:50] know, get up in front of the saints at
[22:52] church and I talk about faith and
[22:54] praying and trusting in the Lord, right?
[22:57] So I said to myself, you
[22:58] know, I'm just going to commit it to God
[23:02] and then I'm going to walk and I'm going
[23:05] to commit it to him and as I you know,
[23:08] I'm going to pray about it until I have
[23:09] peace about it. And I did that and I
[23:12] felt inspired to go work on the
[23:14] car. That's strange for me, but I did.
[23:17] So I went out and I worked on the car
[23:19] and I got it started. Well, I figured
[23:21] out what the problem was the next day.
[23:22] The part showed up and I got it started
[23:24] and I was like, "Yes, hallelujah. Praise
[23:26] the Lord." That was Sunday night. And
[23:29] then um I wasn't feeling well Monday, so
[23:32] I still had to fix the steering, right?
[23:35] And
[23:37] um Tuesday night when I got home from
[23:39] work, I felt a lot better and I'm like,
[23:40] I'm going to go out there and fix the
[23:41] steering. Going to have a car
[23:43] again. I took everything went swimmingly
[23:49] smooth. I didn't I don't think I banged
[23:51] my knuckles once. Um but when I got
[23:56] done, steering didn't work still. I
[23:59] tried to be I tried to, you know, I was
[24:01] like, I'll take it for a drive. It's
[24:02] probably I'm probably just imagining it,
[24:04] you know, trying to be positive. And by
[24:08] the time I got home, I was a little bit
[24:10] I was a little bit upset and probably a
[24:11] little grumpy cuz I'd been working on
[24:13] cars and the car still didn't
[24:15] work. But I woke up woke up that morning
[24:19] and I was a
[24:20] little sorry, you know me, I get a
[24:22] little thinks about the
[24:24] Lord. But I woke up that morning and I
[24:27] was still a little upset.
[24:32] and I opened up to
[24:34] Hebrews and I just read the like I don't
[24:38] remember which one it is in Hebrews, but
[24:39] he says, "I'll never leave thee nor
[24:40] forsake thee." You know, and I thought,
[24:43] you know, Lord, you're so good to me.
[24:45] And I was getting ready for work and I
[24:47] was just going to drive the car anyways.
[24:49] No power steering. I thought
[24:51] I'm I'll just not take the freeway or
[24:54] anything crazy, right? So, I
[24:57] um got as I'm walking out the door,
[25:00] something said to me, "My scanner was
[25:02] sitting there." I said, "Grab your
[25:04] scanner." And I grabbed my scanner and I
[25:06] got in the car and I started it up and I
[25:08] wait a minute. So, I turned it off,
[25:10] hooked the scanner up, turned turned the
[25:12] key again, turned the scanner on. I
[25:15] thought I should clear the codes. So, I
[25:16] cleared the codes, started it back up,
[25:19] and it worked perfectly fine.
[25:22] And as I was driving to work, I just
[25:25] felt felt the presence of the Lord. He
[25:27] said, "You know, you committed it to
[25:30] me. I'm going to take care of it for
[25:34] [Music]
[25:36] you." He's faithful. He's
[25:40] faithful. When we give whatever it is in
[25:42] this life over to
[25:44] him, maybe we don't like the outcome or
[25:47] the outcome doesn't happen quite like we
[25:49] thought it would, but he's going to take
[25:52] care of it. He's going to take care of
[25:53] it. Praise him. Amen.
[25:58] [Music]
[26:01] Hallelujah. Let's just sing that chorus.
[26:03] Change my heart, oh God. As we get ready
[26:05] to go to
[26:07] [Music]
[26:13] prayer, change my heart, oh
[26:20] God, make it ever true.

[26:33] God. May I be like
[26:41] you. You are the
[26:46] potter. I am the clay.

[26:56] make

[27:03] [Music]
[27:05] pray. Change my heart, oh
[27:10] [Music]

[36:08] true.
[36:12] There's a race that I must run. There
[36:18] are victories to be won. Give me power
[36:25] every hour to be
[36:31] true. Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me
[36:41] true. Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me
[36:51] true. There's a race that I must run.
[36:57] There are victories to be won. Give me
[37:03] power every hour to be
[37:10] true. Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me
[37:23] true. Lord Jesus, keep me true.
[37:31] There's a race that I must run and there
[37:36] are victories to be won. Keep me
[37:42] true every hour to be
[37:49] true. Amen. That reminds me of the
[37:52] little story about the little girl.
[37:55] She approached her dad and she said,
[37:57] "Daddy, they said in church about
[37:59] serving the Lord Jesus all the days of
[38:01] your life." And she said, "That just
[38:04] seems like an awfully long
[38:07] time." And her dad said,
[38:10] "Well,
[38:12] sweetheart, maybe you could just serve
[38:14] him for a year." And she said, "Oh,
[38:16] Daddy, a year is a long, long
[38:19] time." He said, "Well, maybe,
[38:21] sweetheart, you could serve him for six
[38:23] months." And she said, "Oh, I can't even
[38:26] imagine." And they bring it all the way
[38:28] down for the little girl. Can you just
[38:32] serve him minute by minute? Amen. And we
[38:37] look at this whole picture of how
[38:39] gracious the Lord is. Keep me true, Lord
[38:42] Jesus. Amen. We don't have to try to
[38:46] look off and say, "Well, well, to the
[38:48] coming of the Lord, I want to remain
[38:49] faithful." Let's just be faithful right
[38:53] right now. Amen. Ain't that wonderful?
[38:56] Amen. Hallelujah. Well, some pleasant
[39:00] surprises. Amen. God bless you. Amen. So
[39:04] happy to have each and every one of you.
[39:06] I I hope this is not too personal, but I
[39:08] was just listening as we're harvesting.
[39:10] I was just listening to the prophet and
[39:13] I couldn't even tell you now what
[39:14] service it was exactly because I just
[39:16] been listening to a bunch. and and he
[39:18] was talking about brother Neville. And
[39:20] when he started talking about what a
[39:22] blessing brother Neville was to the body
[39:24] and so faithfully teaching the people
[39:27] and supporting them, I just thought of
[39:29] your family and I just said prayers for
[39:31] you because you know God has a way of
[39:34] just carrying those things right on
[39:36] down. And when I think about that and I
[39:39] think about Brother Neville, I just
[39:41] think about what a godly legacy is in
[39:44] your family, Sister Alice. And you know,
[39:46] I got two daughters that are just uh oh,
[39:50] so faithful and on fire for the Lord.
[39:53] That just stirs my heart. Amen.
[39:56] Hallelujah. And uh Sister Carrie, we
[39:59] will forgive you over time that you have
[40:01] held little Isaac before all the rest of
[40:04] us even get to see him. Uh but we are so
[40:08] happy for brother Persant, Sister Acha.
[40:11] Uh what a handsome little man. Amen. And
[40:14] I just really look forward to that. Um,
[40:16] brother Pashant, Sister Koncha, if
[40:18] you're listening, uh, please bring him
[40:20] to us. Amen. And, uh, we just look for
[40:24] that. Also, I want to just, uh, uh,
[40:28] encourage you to continue to remember
[40:30] brother Donnie in South Africa. Uh, you
[40:33] want to talk about the Lord doing
[40:36] things. uh he uh you know his chest
[40:39] started hurting uh right after he just
[40:42] preached some wonderful services. They
[40:44] had uh I think seven baptisms and three
[40:47] or four more that that um were not
[40:50] prepared for that for that weekend. And
[40:53] then he comes back home and and uh chest
[40:56] hurts and they said, "Well, your lungs
[40:58] are clear full of blood clots." And um
[41:01] you know so they they wanted to keep him
[41:04] in the hospital but you know literally
[41:05] uh in a very short time they said well
[41:07] you might as well go home uh take this
[41:10] medicine it's going to take time for it
[41:12] to work you probably will not preach for
[41:14] 6 months. He
[41:17] preached just here Sunday evening and he
[41:20] didn't hold anything back. Amen. So,
[41:23] just continue to pray for for brother
[41:25] Donnie. You know, the Lord's healing
[41:27] him. And uh I don't see sister Ulia, but
[41:30] I think Sister Vika had some wisdom
[41:32] teeth pulled. And uh is she doing okay?
[41:36] Yes. Yes. I can only imagine. Amen. But
[41:39] anyway, let's remember Sister Vika.
[41:41] Let's just stand as we go. Uh I sure
[41:44] appreciate the song service. you know,
[41:47] our musicians, God blesses us that we
[41:50] and um even uh you know, maybe with
[41:53] limited attendance and we we've got uh
[41:57] uh still a beautiful atmosphere for song
[42:00] service. Amen. And we thank the Lord for
[42:03] that. I want to just take something from
[42:05] the scripture uh and uh when I start to
[42:09] read it, you'll see. But I want to title
[42:11] this, be careful for nothing. Now, that
[42:15] seems like a pretty big order, right, to
[42:17] come that that we would just not there's
[42:20] nothing here that would intimidate us.
[42:22] Uh nothing here that would stop us. Now,
[42:25] we've all been there. We've been
[42:26] intimidated. We've been stopped. The
[42:29] devil shows up like a giant and and we
[42:32] kind of tend to cower just a little bit
[42:34] in that. remember Israel there and they
[42:37] looked out there and they were like, "Oh
[42:39] my, not only is the average Philistine a
[42:42] big guy, but Goliath is just above and
[42:46] beyond." And so I've got a giant in my
[42:48] life and it's holding me back, but the
[42:51] word tells us, "Be careful for nothing."
[42:54] Amen. So those giants are subject to the
[42:57] word of God. Just like a little devil,
[43:01] Amen. A big devil still subject. Amen.
[43:05] And every one of those, the word says,
[43:07] have been placed under our feet. So, we
[43:10] don't have to look at the size of the
[43:12] situation and say, "That's that's too
[43:15] much, my brother and sister." Kind of
[43:16] like, you know, how the prophet showed
[43:18] us there's no degrees of sin, right? So,
[43:20] it's not a little sin and a big sin.
[43:23] It's just sin. There's not a big devil
[43:25] and a little devil. It's just a devil.
[43:27] Amen. And so, we don't have to be
[43:29] careful. Sorry, my nose is itching here.
[43:31] This is driving me crazy. Uh we don't
[43:34] have to be careful for nothing. Amen.
[43:36] Now let's just turn in our Bibles to
[43:38] Philippians the 4th chapter verses
[43:41] 4-9. And um we will see this here where
[43:45] I was uh uh uh moved to name or title
[43:51] this tonight. Rejoice in the Lord
[43:54] always. And again I say rejoice. You
[43:57] know, we could stop right there and go
[43:59] home and say, "We were blessed to be in
[44:01] the house of God." Let your moderation
[44:04] be known unto all men. The Lord is at
[44:08] hand. Be careful for nothing, but in
[44:11] everything by prayer and supplication
[44:14] with thanksgiving. Let your requests be
[44:16] known unto God. Now, I just want to put
[44:19] a footnote here real quick. often times
[44:22] the bigger or uh uh uh uh seemingly
[44:26] insurmountable situation is there. We
[44:29] don't find ourselves coming to the Lord
[44:31] saying, "Thank you for this trial. Thank
[44:34] you for this situation." We tend to find
[44:36] ourselves intimidated by the size of
[44:39] what we're facing, the the overall what
[44:42] we view it. God looks down and says,
[44:44] "Ha, nothing. Nothing. Just one word and
[44:48] that's settled." And we're saying, "Oh
[44:50] Lord, the world has come to an end. What
[44:52] do we do?" But it's telling us, in
[44:55] everything, can we repeat that? In
[44:58] everything, Amen. by prayer and
[45:01] supplication with thanksgiving, let your
[45:03] requests be made known unto God. And the
[45:06] peace of God which passeth all
[45:09] understanding, Amen. There's not
[45:11] anything that's beyond that
[45:13] understanding, right? Shall keep your
[45:15] hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
[45:18] Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are
[45:20] true, whatsoever things are honest,
[45:23] whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
[45:25] things are pure, whatsoever things are
[45:28] lovely, whatsoever things are of good
[45:31] report. If there be any virtue, if there
[45:34] be any praise, think on these things.
[45:37] Those things which you have both learned
[45:40] and received and heard and seen in
[45:45] me. Space of time, not just blended in,
[45:50] right? We just hurry right on through
[45:52] it. Do
[45:54] we're given an action as a command, an
[45:58] action. these things that you have heard
[46:00] and you have received and uh you you've
[46:04] seen. Amen. Aren't you glad we get to
[46:07] actually see the word of God lived out?
[46:09] And it's it's not that we have to look
[46:11] back in history and say, "Oh, look at
[46:12] the Apostle Paul. Look at Matthew, Mark,
[46:15] Luke, John." We can look right in our
[46:17] own midst. Amen. We can look right here
[46:20] this evening. I just Sorry, I don't mean
[46:22] to be too forward, but we've seen God
[46:24] come on the scene and heal. Amen. We're
[46:27] not looking hoping someday to see a
[46:29] testimony that God is a healer. When we
[46:31] were singing the songs and stuff there,
[46:33] it just struck me. We have witness right
[46:35] here in our midst of doctors saying, "We
[46:38] don't know what we can do about this.
[46:41] It's this." And then God comes and says,
[46:42] "Just remember, trust me. I'm your
[46:45] healer.
[46:46] I'm your healer and I'm on the scene."
[46:48] Amen. Ain't that beautiful? We're not
[46:50] looking for a God of history. And we're
[46:52] not looking for the God of the future.
[46:54] We're looking for a God that's in church
[46:55] with us tonight. Amen. Hallelujah. Those
[46:59] things which you have both learned and
[47:00] received and heard and seen in me do.
[47:03] And the God of peace shall be with you.
[47:06] Heavenly Father, we just ask you for
[47:08] your blessings tonight. May the word,
[47:10] Father, come and just touch our hearts.
[47:12] I mean it tonight, Lord, in my heart as
[47:14] an encouraging word that we would bring
[47:17] tonight. and just ask, Father, that you
[47:19] would come move as you would, Father, on
[47:21] the midst of your people. Touch each
[47:23] heart according to their need. Guide
[47:26] each one, Father, for those that are not
[47:28] here tonight. We ask for your tender
[47:30] hand of mercy, Lord, to be with each and
[47:32] everyone. May the word be open to us.
[47:35] May revelation flow that we can walk
[47:37] out, Lord, reminded that we are already
[47:40] a victorious people. We thank you now in
[47:43] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may
[47:46] be seated.
[47:47] Amen. You know, I
[47:49] uh I just uh one of the notes I just
[47:52] wrote down here as I was putting all of
[47:55] this together is that we need to apply
[47:58] this scripture every day of our lives.
[48:01] Amen. The things of good report. Amen.
[48:05] The prophet of God, you know, reminds
[48:07] it's not part of my sermon, but just
[48:08] struck me. He reminded us that uh when
[48:11] we say that we're not very strong and we
[48:14] can't do it, you know, we're speaking
[48:15] the devil's language. And I certainly
[48:18] don't want to go on record as as being a
[48:20] supporter of Satan's uh language. Amen.
[48:24] It's uh it's not who we are. Amen. So,
[48:27] as we're looking at this scripture, if I
[48:29] can just uh dive right into it, uh I
[48:33] want to know, my brother and sister, are
[48:34] we bold
[48:36] enough? The word of God is right here.
[48:39] It's telling us that to be careful.
[48:42] Amen. For nothing. And we would desire
[48:46] that um we would come and the scripture
[48:50] of verse five, let me just back up a
[48:52] little bit.
[48:53] Let your moderation. Now, we can take
[48:56] this several different variations of
[48:58] this definition of moderation, but I'm
[49:01] going to bring it in this fashion right
[49:03] here that God wants us, my brother and
[49:06] sister, to take the word and apply it to
[49:09] our life. He doesn't want us to plow the
[49:11] ditch on the left. He doesn't want us to
[49:13] plow the ditch on the right. But we want
[49:15] to be known by the balance that we have
[49:18] in our life. and you know to do all
[49:20] things in moderation to live a gospel
[49:23] the life of Jesus Christ in moderation
[49:26] that the people would see who we are by
[49:30] our action by how we live out the word.
[49:34] In other words, if I could just be so
[49:36] strong to say it tonight, my brother and
[49:38] sister, we don't want to be known as it
[49:41] would be liberal as believers, but we
[49:44] also don't want to be known as the
[49:45] legalist of believers. We want to find
[49:48] that center road. The gospel is there.
[49:51] You know, we look at those things. You
[49:53] would look at Peter just for an example
[49:55] for a moment tonight. Look at Peter as
[49:59] as he is speaking and he is acting out.
[50:02] Now Jesus looks at him and says, "Satan,
[50:06] get thee behind me." Now that I I I have
[50:11] to admit I believe that would be
[50:13] something that having that spoken to us
[50:15] would be would be crushing. It it would
[50:19] be as though like oh my. But you see
[50:22] what Jesus was doing was taking Peter
[50:25] who if we were there might have behaved
[50:27] exactly the same way. And he was
[50:29] centering Peter up. And the final touch
[50:32] you might say on that is when he
[50:34] declares that you're going to deny me
[50:36] and Peter says never. But yet it is
[50:39] there. I was just looking through some
[50:41] pictures a few days ago of our time in
[50:44] Israel. And remember we're there in the
[50:46] statue and there is Peter sitting and
[50:49] there's the tree and there is the
[50:51] rooster on top of it. And it so struck
[50:54] me as we're looking at that to realize
[50:56] that Peter while in his heart was fully
[50:59] committed. I would never never deny my
[51:02] Lord Jesus. and the moment how that must
[51:05] have crushed his spirit uh when that
[51:07] rooster crows and and it's there in that
[51:10] situation but you see God was allowing
[51:13] Peter to be centered he come back to
[51:16] actually see I can fail I am not
[51:20] invincible I can fail I need this gospel
[51:24] more than I ever thought and I would say
[51:26] tonight that I'm coming to a realization
[51:30] I need this gospel more than I've ever
[51:32] thought I needed it. Amen. I find myself
[51:36] saying, "Oh, you know, here I am in this
[51:38] situation and you're tossed and and
[51:40] tempted and things are coming in such a
[51:42] fashion and you find yourself maybe not
[51:45] angry in the sense we typically relate
[51:47] it, but you find yourself having a great
[51:50] emotion and then you realize, oh Lord,
[51:52] help me." That's, you know, one more
[51:54] step that might have been a temper. Uh,
[51:56] and you know, things that happen and we
[51:59] realize what's happening. Uh I I just
[52:01] listened to a brother. I won't mention
[52:03] his name. You would know it if I if I
[52:05] shared it. But he was preaching here
[52:08] recently and he made a comment. He says
[52:11] these things that God is doing in our
[52:14] lives, what he is doing is exposing us.
[52:19] Oh my, my brother and sister, I say,
[52:21] Lord, expose me tonight. Amen. I don't
[52:24] want to be exposed as an unbeliever.
[52:26] Amen. or the makebeliever, but the
[52:28] things that are in our life expose them.
[52:31] Amen. That's how we get them out. Not by
[52:34] covering it up, not being told it don't
[52:36] matter, but by the word of God coming
[52:39] and showing us this needs to leave my
[52:42] life. Amen. So, as we look at this, we
[52:45] realize that it's our moderation uh to
[52:48] be known unto all men. The Lord is at
[52:51] hand. be careful for nothing, but in
[52:54] everything by prayer and supplication
[52:57] with thanksgiving, let your requests be
[52:59] known unto God. And it really struck me,
[53:02] and I I just want this, as I said, to be
[53:04] an encouraging thought tonight to be
[53:06] able to apply the scripture uh every day
[53:10] in our lives. And you know, we find
[53:12] ourselves sometimes in the midst of
[53:14] trials. Maybe this is just more of a
[53:16] personal thing, but we find ourselves
[53:18] approaching God almost more like beggars
[53:21] than we do uh uh boldly. We find
[53:24] ourselves, oh Lord, you know, I did this
[53:26] wrong and I did that wrong and Lord, can
[53:28] you please just come and do this, can
[53:30] you do this? But that's really not the
[53:32] way that the word here is speaking uh to
[53:36] the Philippians. you know, he's he's
[53:38] telling them there that you need to be
[53:40] uh not to be careful for nothing. You
[53:42] need to come boldly. And it's in that
[53:45] realm that we find that what God is
[53:47] doing, he's bringing us to a place and
[53:49] and that's why my nose is going to drive
[53:51] me crazy. I don't know what it is uh
[53:54] that I put this down in words. Are we
[53:57] bold enough? Now my brother and sister,
[53:59] there comes a time and a place that we
[54:01] would come and and we know my brother
[54:03] and sister that we want to submit
[54:05] everything in our life for God's reveal.
[54:09] We we want to just submit it. We want to
[54:11] come We don't want to ask him to fix it
[54:14] after we've messed it up. We want him to
[54:17] lead us before we get to that. And so
[54:20] it's in that place that that we want to
[54:22] submit everything for the Lord's review.
[54:25] And no matter how small, you know, it's
[54:28] kind of interesting, my brother and
[54:30] sister, that that uh sometimes we get
[54:32] this idea that that uh the little things
[54:35] of life, we we just don't need to worry
[54:37] and bother the Lord with it. But he
[54:40] really cares about every aspect of our
[54:43] life. Now, I did not go this avenue
[54:45] tonight because Lord willing, we won't
[54:47] go as long as that would have taken. But
[54:50] uh some lovely quotes coming to the fact
[54:53] that uh our Lord Jesus is not complete
[54:56] until he is married to his bride. The
[55:00] prophet of God lays that out beautifully
[55:03] my brother and sister. And the bride is
[55:05] not complete until she is married to her
[55:09] bridegroom. And so we look at this the
[55:11] whole picture to be complete must come
[55:14] to a place that it is in a fullness. the
[55:18] action has taken place and we're not
[55:20] looking into the future that we will be
[55:22] the bride but the prophet of God uh uh
[55:25] said you know I now call you bride.
[55:29] Amen. So there is a junction of time
[55:33] that God is is uh conveying to us that
[55:37] it's no longer we'll in the future
[55:39] somewhere identify ourselves as the
[55:42] bride of Christ but we now can stand
[55:45] here even tonight and make the
[55:47] declaration we are the bride of Jesus
[55:51] Christ. Amen. That means that there's
[55:54] something been closed. The loop has been
[55:56] closed and there is something that is
[55:58] finished. Amen. It has come to a
[56:01] fullness and here it is that in essence
[56:04] can be with with uh that with confidence
[56:07] laid out that this is a seventh seal uh
[56:10] revealed right now. We're no longer
[56:12] looking to be bride one day. But the
[56:14] prophet of God said I now call you
[56:16] bride. Now you could say, "Oh, that was
[56:18] just terminology." I like the
[56:20] terminology. Okay. I like the identity
[56:23] terminology. To say I'm saved is
[56:26] terminology. to say I'm forgiven is
[56:29] terminology. So we can look at that in
[56:32] that sense or we can look at that and
[56:34] say God's word will never return void.
[56:37] So therefore when he said I am the bride
[56:39] of Christ, I am now the bride of Jesus
[56:42] Christ. And we can stand on the word and
[56:45] hold to that. Amen. Now we know that our
[56:48] desire I I'm I'm speaking very positive
[56:51] to believers tonight. We know that our
[56:54] desire is pure. Amen. we're coming to
[56:57] the Lord. I I would just have to say I
[57:00] would trust that none of us have uh some
[57:02] ulterior motive. Uh we don't we don't
[57:05] have a desire to to be known in the
[57:08] world or to to rise above our peers as
[57:12] it were, but our our desire is pure and
[57:14] our motive is pure. And so God is
[57:18] granting to us in that position a bold
[57:21] entrance to the throne. Amen. When he
[57:25] tells us to come boldly to the throne of
[57:27] God, he didn't put any quantifiers
[57:30] there, a certain date, a certain time,
[57:32] and only if this happens, come boldly to
[57:35] the throne. But we come to a place at
[57:37] the opening of the word. And in that
[57:39] that opening of the word, that boldness
[57:41] comes with identity. When there's
[57:44] identity crisis, there is no boldness.
[57:47] Amen. But when we know who we are, we
[57:50] can then come boldly to the throne of
[57:52] God. And when we read the word, as we've
[57:55] made reference here, and the word says,
[57:57] "I'm your healer," we can come boldly to
[57:59] the throne because we know that was
[58:02] speaking to me, was speaking to you.
[58:05] Amen. And I I just put this this bold
[58:08] interest to the throne. I want to have
[58:11] an Esther kind of boldness. Amen. They
[58:14] all said, "Now, if you go in, Esther,
[58:17] and he does not hold the scepter out to
[58:19] you, that you would be banished and you
[58:22] will never come before the king ever
[58:24] again in your life." Now, my brother and
[58:26] sister, if you were just worried about
[58:29] your own position, you would say,
[58:31] "There's a high risk. I better not take
[58:34] it." But Esther had a higher calling.
[58:36] Amen. As a bride to the king, Amen. She
[58:40] knew that she actually had an
[58:42] obligation. Mori put it in pretty strong
[58:45] words to her. He said, "It's for this
[58:47] occasion, for this time, for this
[58:50] purpose that you have come, been called
[58:52] into the kingdom." And my brother and
[58:54] sister, this is the age that God said a
[58:57] bride would rise up. Amen. The prophet
[58:59] speaks of this. A bride would rise up in
[59:02] this day and she would bring glory to
[59:05] her God. Amen. Bring glory to her
[59:08] savior. Amen. She would then come and
[59:11] edify her bridegroom. Amen. And there's
[59:14] nothing like having your wife, Amen,
[59:18] represent you in such a fashion. What a
[59:20] glorious thing. Now, I'm going to keep
[59:22] this simple, okay? But to to be married
[59:25] and to have a wife that that is spoken
[59:28] highly and even just our sisters, it
[59:30] doesn't really have to come down to be a
[59:32] wife. That that it is there's a
[59:34] representation that is there spoken
[59:36] highly of. Amen. What does that do? It
[59:39] brings glory without the horns blown and
[59:42] confetti and everything. It brings
[59:44] glory. Now, I'll just share this with
[59:46] you. Talking to a brother here the other
[59:48] day. Amen. And he made a comment to me.
[59:51] He says, "You know, Brother Paul, you're
[59:53] really blessed." And and I wasn't
[59:54] feeling too blessed that day. Amen. I I
[59:57] was feeling very stressed. Not blessed.
[59:59] Amen. They're spelled pretty close,
[1:00:01] right? But not quite the same. And And
[1:00:03] I'm feeling a little stressed. And he
[1:00:04] says, "You know, Brother Paul, you're
[1:00:05] really blessed." And I said, "Yes,
[1:00:07] brother. I I believe so." And he says,
[1:00:09] "Well, I'm talking about the church. You
[1:00:12] got a church full of wonderful people
[1:00:14] that love the Lord." And and you're
[1:00:15] really blessed as a pastor because I
[1:00:18] preach a lot of places and not every
[1:00:20] church is welcoming and open and
[1:00:22] receives the word. Uh and and you you
[1:00:24] are blessed. And I got to thinking about
[1:00:27] that. You know what? Amen. Here it is.
[1:00:29] I'm getting the compliment from this
[1:00:31] minister, but it is you that brings it
[1:00:34] to a place where the compliment means
[1:00:36] something. Amen. It wasn't he said,
[1:00:38] Paul, you are such a great guy to preach
[1:00:40] to. He's talking about the body. Amen.
[1:00:43] The believers and here it is that we as
[1:00:46] that and Esther, you know, she had that
[1:00:49] relationship with her with her husband
[1:00:51] and there's what separated it wasn't
[1:00:54] just she's married to the king. That's a
[1:00:56] very good term, a very good position to
[1:00:58] be in. But that kind of position, my
[1:01:01] brother and sister, would never bring
[1:01:03] you because Vashi, she was just married
[1:01:06] to the king. Amen. She didn't have a
[1:01:09] relationship with him or she would have
[1:01:11] never disrespected him like she did. She
[1:01:14] was just married to the king and she
[1:01:16] thought, you know what? I I'm just as on
[1:01:19] solid footing as the queen. I can do
[1:01:22] what I want. The prophet of God brings
[1:01:23] this and says that was a spirit that has
[1:01:26] come into the churches of this day
[1:01:29] because they believe they're on equal
[1:01:31] footing. Amen. As a dominant as the wife
[1:01:34] being dominant, they believe they're on
[1:01:36] equal footing with the king. Amen. And
[1:01:40] God says, uh, nope. That that's not how
[1:01:42] it works. That's not going to work. God
[1:01:44] wants a bride, a wife that has that
[1:01:48] brings honor, brings that respect,
[1:01:50] brings that praise. And you know, the
[1:01:52] the uh carnal mind comes and says,
[1:01:55] "Well, I I don't know that I want to
[1:01:57] serve a God." I just read this the other
[1:01:59] day, a man making these comments. I
[1:02:01] don't know that I would serve a God that
[1:02:03] I had to constantly give him
[1:02:05] praise. And I thought, boy, you would be
[1:02:07] a great person to be married to. You
[1:02:10] know, I mean, it it's a component that
[1:02:13] we have to to have as humanity, right?
[1:02:16] God made us in this image so that we
[1:02:18] could relate to who we are in our
[1:02:20] relationship to him. And I I don't know
[1:02:23] of anybody that's normal. Let me put it
[1:02:25] that way. Capital normal. Uh but that
[1:02:27] that doesn't like to hear a compliment,
[1:02:29] doesn't like to be lifted up and have
[1:02:31] something nice said. And and you know,
[1:02:34] uh somebody would say, "I wouldn't want
[1:02:35] to serve a God that I had to constantly
[1:02:37] praise." You know, uh does he have, you
[1:02:40] know, a problem with self-confidence?
[1:02:41] And I thought, man, you're going to hear
[1:02:43] those words echo one day and you're
[1:02:45] going to say, have confidence when God
[1:02:47] says, "Depart from me." There won't be
[1:02:49] any argument then about who's in
[1:02:51] authority and who's in control. And so
[1:02:54] Esther kind of bold and it's there that
[1:02:56] you look at this. They're trying to talk
[1:02:58] Esther out of it. Esther, you you you
[1:03:00] know, you don't realize what you're
[1:03:01] doing cuz if he doesn't accept you, then
[1:03:05] you will never see the king again. But
[1:03:07] the thing was is Esther knew, right?
[1:03:10] This is the kind of bold that I'm
[1:03:12] talking about. Esther knew that the king
[1:03:15] would respond to her voice. And when God
[1:03:18] said, "Come boldly to the throne." Amen.
[1:03:22] He knew. He was already declaring, "I
[1:03:25] will hear your voice. I will receive
[1:03:28] you. It's not going to fall on empty
[1:03:31] ears." And you know, Esther says, "Hey,
[1:03:34] I have to do this." Now my brother and
[1:03:36] sister, you imagine that all of those
[1:03:39] chamberlains and all of those maids that
[1:03:41] had fallen in love with Esther that they
[1:03:44] were there, they cared about her. She
[1:03:45] was a different kind of of a bride, a
[1:03:48] different kind of a person, and they
[1:03:50] cared about her. And and uh they had
[1:03:53] procured the best. She didn't want max
[1:03:55] factor. She didn't want all these other
[1:03:57] things. She just wanted to be who God
[1:04:00] made her to be. And she wanted to
[1:04:02] present herself. and she presented
[1:04:05] herself in simplicity. And uh I I won't
[1:04:08] go into that, but I knew a man uh uh
[1:04:11] that years ago used to love the phrase
[1:04:14] simple elegance. And I think we can all
[1:04:16] relate to to that. You don't have to
[1:04:19] have, you know, everything gussied up,
[1:04:22] you know. And as a deal, I I I hope you
[1:04:24] don't mind me saying this. I I read a
[1:04:27] deal some time back here. Uh, and the
[1:04:30] guy was talking about exotic sport cars
[1:04:32] and and he makes a comment. He says,
[1:04:34] "You'd have to wonder about the
[1:04:36] mentality of someone who had put a
[1:04:38] bumper sticker on a
[1:04:40] Maserati." And so, it's there that you
[1:04:43] think about that. Amen. We don't need a
[1:04:46] bumper sticker saying, "I'm a
[1:04:48] Christian." Amen. Who we are says
[1:04:52] boldly. It shouts it to the heavens that
[1:04:55] we believe. Amen. that the word is
[1:04:58] preeminent in our life. We don't have to
[1:05:00] run around telling everybody, "I'm a
[1:05:02] Christian. I'm a Christian." Because it
[1:05:05] shows. Amen. And so, it's there that
[1:05:07] Esther knew she had to do this. She knew
[1:05:10] that's what she had called Mordei and
[1:05:12] planted that in her. But Morortei didn't
[1:05:14] wait till she was needing to go before
[1:05:16] the king. He had started from a little
[1:05:18] girl. Amen. when he adopted her into his
[1:05:22] family, such a lovely type there, he
[1:05:24] started planting the idea of who she was
[1:05:28] and what she was when she was a little
[1:05:31] girl. He didn't come to the crisis and
[1:05:33] then say, "Wait, wait, you're a daughter
[1:05:35] of God. Wait, wait, you should this.
[1:05:37] Wait, wait, you should do that." But it
[1:05:39] was already something in her and it was
[1:05:42] there. Now, John 14 and 12. Amen.
[1:05:47] Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
[1:05:49] believeth on me, the works that I do
[1:05:51] shall he do also. Greater works than
[1:05:54] these shall he do because I go unto my
[1:05:57] father. Now, I was just listening and
[1:05:59] brother Brandham lays this out and he
[1:06:02] says, now it's really shouldn't say
[1:06:05] greater. It should say more. Amen. So,
[1:06:08] we're not going to do something greater
[1:06:10] than our Lord Jesus Christ did as far as
[1:06:12] magnificent and whatever, but we're
[1:06:15] going to see the word come. And what the
[1:06:19] prophet lays out here is it's not going
[1:06:22] to be confined in one place. like I'm
[1:06:25] sorry I just been uh on on a little deal
[1:06:27] here some stuff. But but my brother and
[1:06:30] sister, we don't need a prophet to come
[1:06:31] back so that we can have healings and
[1:06:34] deliverances and people receive the Holy
[1:06:36] Ghost and and all of these things, the
[1:06:38] word be open to us. We don't have to go
[1:06:40] back there because the prophet showing
[1:06:43] us that when God's in the church, when
[1:06:45] the Holy Spirit is in the midst of the
[1:06:47] people, these signs shall be and they
[1:06:51] will happen. They're happening in
[1:06:53] Africa. They're happening in Europe,
[1:06:55] South America. They're happening
[1:06:57] wherever in the world that the believer
[1:06:59] is gathered. These things are happening.
[1:07:02] Amen. We had that sister. Amen. There in
[1:07:05] in South Africa. I don't know, maybe you
[1:07:07] guys wouldn't have heard this testimony,
[1:07:09] but we're right there at a f a Saturday
[1:07:12] evening fellowship. A and uh it was
[1:07:15] really incredible because a sister
[1:07:17] stands up. She says, "I I have a a
[1:07:20] testimony." And uh so she stands up and
[1:07:24] she says it was in the midst of the
[1:07:26] service. Now I don't say this that
[1:07:28] because I was preaching but it shows to
[1:07:31] me that God is present when faith is
[1:07:34] there. And so she says, "Brother Paul
[1:07:36] was preaching. Here it is in the Friday
[1:07:38] evening service." And brother Paul is
[1:07:41] preaching and I'm looking up there and
[1:07:43] brother Paul goes blurry and the the the
[1:07:46] screen and whatever it goes blurry and
[1:07:49] she's like, "Oh my, what is happening to
[1:07:51] my eyes?" And she took her glasses off
[1:07:54] to rub her eyes and she could see
[1:07:57] perfectly. Amen. The blurry was because
[1:08:00] God had healed her in that moment and
[1:08:03] her eyes did not need what we would call
[1:08:06] correction. Amen. and God healed her and
[1:08:09] f uh Saturday evening they had a
[1:08:12] fireside uh testimony and song service
[1:08:15] and whatnot and she shared that and and
[1:08:18] uh brother uh Tim Dods was actually
[1:08:21] there and he just or no that was brother
[1:08:23] Dale wasn't that just challenged her uh
[1:08:26] read the screen and they had a music
[1:08:28] screen uh for the music out on the end
[1:08:30] of the thing there read that and then
[1:08:33] sing it amen and she just can see it
[1:08:35] perfectly now my brother and sister we
[1:08:37] weren't preaching about healing. We
[1:08:39] weren't preaching about having faith. We
[1:08:41] were just preaching about believing the
[1:08:43] word and whatever was going on in her
[1:08:46] life, her prayer life. She was called
[1:08:48] just like Esther, she was called for
[1:08:50] that moment. And she responded in that
[1:08:53] moment. And Lord, I believe and you are
[1:08:56] my healer. And so, it's there that it
[1:08:59] God come on the scene. And she was just
[1:09:02] as important for that moment as Esther
[1:09:05] was for her moment. Oh my, how beautiful
[1:09:08] this is. Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[1:09:11] he that believeth on me, the works that
[1:09:13] I do shall he do also, and greater works
[1:09:16] than these shall he do, because I go
[1:09:19] unto my father, and whatsoever ye shall
[1:09:22] ask in my name. What a what an
[1:09:24] ingredient here. Let's grip this, my
[1:09:26] brother and sister. That will I do that
[1:09:29] the father may be glorified in the son.
[1:09:32] Amen. And so when we ask and we come
[1:09:36] boldly to the throne of God, not not
[1:09:39] coming passively, not coming as it is
[1:09:42] just as a beggar, not just hoping
[1:09:45] somehow this might be, but we come as
[1:09:48] sons and daughters of God. I believe
[1:09:50] this promise. I believe this word. It
[1:09:53] was spoken and I say amen to it. And he
[1:09:56] says, when you ask in my name, that will
[1:09:59] I do. Can we possibly saints not have
[1:10:02] had a high enough expectation?
[1:10:05] We have that, oh Lord, if we we we will
[1:10:08] spend more time praying if it's your
[1:10:10] will, Lord. It has to be his will or he
[1:10:13] wouldn't have put it in his word. Amen.
[1:10:16] He's not running like a a lottery and
[1:10:19] the thing is spinning and a little ball
[1:10:20] falls out every once in a while. I'll
[1:10:23] just heal one. My brother and sister, I
[1:10:25] honestly I I'm just preaching from my
[1:10:27] heart. I think that we have had way too
[1:10:29] low of expectation of what God will do
[1:10:32] in our midst. And and he's trying to
[1:10:35] encourage us. Come on, just claim
[1:10:37] everything. Whatsoever you ask in my
[1:10:40] name, Amen, that will I do. And I think
[1:10:43] we need to come more bold to the throne.
[1:10:46] Amen. Now, God expects a life behind
[1:10:48] this, right? But the prophet of God,
[1:10:50] remember he's speaking and he says, you
[1:10:52] know, people wonder how it is that a
[1:10:55] real saintly daughter of God would come
[1:10:57] and and she doesn't receive her healing.
[1:11:00] And some young woman, maybe not
[1:11:03] everything quite right in her life,
[1:11:04] comes off the street and as she's there,
[1:11:08] she says, "You know what? They said that
[1:11:10] he's my healer and I believe that he's
[1:11:13] my healer and God heals him." You know
[1:11:15] what the problem is? That woman didn't
[1:11:17] have any more sense than to just believe
[1:11:19] God was her healer. And we as
[1:11:21] Christians, as believers, are over here
[1:11:23] saying, "If I can get to this place, and
[1:11:25] if I can do that, and if I can get this
[1:11:28] straightened out and I can praise God
[1:11:30] enough, he'll heal me." He said he is
[1:11:33] our healer. Amen. And simple faith will
[1:11:37] bring that to pass. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:11:42] Now, I just say this for reference. You
[1:11:45] can find it. Uh it's not even on the
[1:11:47] won't be on the screen. Uh at uh and thy
[1:11:50] seed shall possess the gate of the enemy
[1:11:51] 62 01 January 121 or I mean January uh
[1:11:57] the 21st
[1:11:59] 1962. These are the direct words, but
[1:12:01] just pulled right out. I'm going to tell
[1:12:03] you right now, they're just pulled right
[1:12:05] out. They
[1:12:07] fail that still small voice of the word.
[1:12:14] still small
[1:12:16] voice. The word keeps you balanced to
[1:12:20] the cross. That's where it lays. That's
[1:12:22] why we don't have genuine prophets in
[1:12:24] the church today like Agabus. Now, go
[1:12:27] look this up. I encourage you take the
[1:12:28] note, look it up on the screen after the
[1:12:31] fact. But you see what happens is is
[1:12:33] God's here. And that's why I draw this
[1:12:35] out, but I just want to be fair to give
[1:12:37] you the
[1:12:39] reference. the still small
[1:12:42] voice. Is it finished? God was done
[1:12:46] speaking or we're waiting for somewhere
[1:12:48] in the future for God to speak
[1:12:50] again. That still small voice is right
[1:12:53] here. And the prophet of God is making
[1:12:56] the point that it's in the word. Yes. So
[1:13:01] people are like, "We're looking for the
[1:13:02] supernatural in our message, church.
[1:13:05] We're looking for this great thing for
[1:13:07] God to speak to us." and yet here is his
[1:13:10] word and they miss it because they're
[1:13:13] looking for something else. Or they
[1:13:16] would come to a place that they would
[1:13:18] misapply and say, "Well, that isn't
[1:13:20] quite what the prophet
[1:13:23] meant." H
[1:13:26] okay. They fail that still small voice
[1:13:29] of the word. It's here speaking.
[1:13:32] Now, we're a small group tonight, but I
[1:13:34] can just ask you, has that voice been
[1:13:36] speaking? Yes.
[1:13:38] Amen. I think I think we could lift a
[1:13:40] hand and really acknowledge it. That
[1:13:42] voice is speaking. We're not sitting
[1:13:45] here without hearing from the Lord.
[1:13:48] Amen. When we are faithful to read our
[1:13:51] Bible and study the message, amen, that
[1:13:54] voice is speaking to us through the
[1:13:56] word. This is a little bit of what the
[1:13:57] prophet was talking about when he was
[1:13:59] talking about reading between the lines.
[1:14:01] It's not just the letter on the page.
[1:14:03] That won't do it for us, my brother and
[1:14:04] sister. But when we are reading it and
[1:14:07] the voice is coming out of the word and
[1:14:10] speaking to us. Amen. And the world out
[1:14:13] here is saying, "Well, uh, you really
[1:14:16] have no right to to interpret what the
[1:14:19] prophet said." We're not interpreting.
[1:14:20] It was a voice that was speaking. Amen.
[1:14:23] I didn't create the voice. Amen. But God
[1:14:26] did give me ears to hear the voice. And
[1:14:29] so when the word starts to speak, the
[1:14:32] bride of Christ actually hears a voice
[1:14:35] speaking to them. Oh, and it changes.
[1:14:40] That still small voice. Amen. And that's
[1:14:43] where the val balance is found is in
[1:14:46] that voice. See, if the word
[1:14:50] Amen. The letter
[1:14:53] kleth, but the spirit giveth life.
[1:14:57] So, if we just read it, here we are. You
[1:15:01] know, I remember one time sitting in a
[1:15:03] church service and I I saw a brother
[1:15:06] beside
[1:15:07] me. He had a little plastic ruler. I
[1:15:10] couldn't figure out for a little bit
[1:15:11] what he was doing, but as they're
[1:15:13] reading this scripture, he's sliding it
[1:15:15] down his Bible, you know, and and I I
[1:15:18] realized what he's doing. As I get
[1:15:19] older, you know, sometimes you're
[1:15:21] reading and you just skip a whole line
[1:15:23] or, you know, something. and and he just
[1:15:25] had this little plastic ruler and he's
[1:15:27] just sliding it down the page, you know,
[1:15:29] and uh something struck me about, you
[1:15:32] know, the thing is is that little ruler,
[1:15:34] that little line that's drawn right
[1:15:35] there might be imaginary as it were, but
[1:15:38] it it's crossing over between the lines.
[1:15:42] Every bit that it goes down, it's
[1:15:45] crossing between the lines.
[1:15:48] Now, whether that speaks to us or not is
[1:15:51] how we approach it.
[1:15:58] I could get sidetracked real easy at
[1:16:00] that point right
[1:16:01] there. Um, James 4 and three says, "Ye
[1:16:05] ask and receive not because you ask a
[1:16:08] miss, you may consume it upon your
[1:16:10] lusts."
[1:16:12] Now, as we look at this uh uh uh we
[1:16:15] understand, my brother and sister that
[1:16:17] lust isn't always a a sexual or or a
[1:16:21] physical type of a lust. It can be in
[1:16:24] our spirit. It can be in our approach.
[1:16:26] Uh we might want to be better known,
[1:16:29] better dressed, better, you know, better
[1:16:32] vocabulary,
[1:16:33] uh more articulate. There's all kinds of
[1:16:36] things where these things come in and
[1:16:38] anoint that. Amen. But it's there that
[1:16:41] because we are not there with a clean
[1:16:44] open heart as we were speaking earlier
[1:16:46] we we have uh different motive we have
[1:16:49] different objective we have something
[1:16:51] behind it and uh you know we can ask but
[1:16:55] I want you to just think about this for
[1:16:57] a
[1:16:58] moment did the prosperity gospel
[1:17:01] flourish in America because they asked
[1:17:03] for wealth and no wealth showed up.
[1:17:08] It prospered in America and is deceiving
[1:17:12] millions because they asked for wealth
[1:17:16] and God let them have wealth. In other
[1:17:18] words, he granted to them the desires of
[1:17:21] their hearts.
[1:17:23] And have I told you that I've been
[1:17:25] praying to be wealthy?
[1:17:33] I
[1:17:35] want every nugget of the word. Amen. I
[1:17:40] want it possess it. I wanted everything
[1:17:43] to come and I wanted to impact my life
[1:17:46] because you see I I have my notes here.
[1:17:49] Uh the rich young
[1:17:50] ruler naturally rich spiritually poor.
[1:17:55] Now my brother and sister, we're not
[1:17:57] called to fulfill the rich young ruler's
[1:18:00] position. Amen. We might be naturally
[1:18:04] poor, but we want to be spiritually
[1:18:07] rich. Amen. And what a heritage. A
[1:18:10] little bit of the thought that touched
[1:18:12] earlier last time. What a heritage it is
[1:18:14] that God said, you know what? I'm going
[1:18:16] to put it to your family and your family
[1:18:18] and right on down. Amen. From age to age
[1:18:22] to age, I'm going to pour this in. Tell
[1:18:24] me who's rich. Amen. Not these not this
[1:18:27] prosperity gospel of the world, but sons
[1:18:30] and daughters of God that said, "Lord, I
[1:18:31] want more of you." Amen. I need more of
[1:18:34] you, Lord. I I want I want to I know
[1:18:36] your Holy Spirit. I want to know you,
[1:18:39] Father. I want to see you and I want to
[1:18:41] have a conversation with you and I want
[1:18:43] to to be personal. As the scripture
[1:18:45] says, "Depart from me. I never knew
[1:18:47] you." And we know because it's been
[1:18:49] preached for years. But we know that
[1:18:51] that word noob means more of a
[1:18:53] intercourse or a a very personal
[1:18:56] relationship that is there. So it's
[1:18:58] there. Depart from me. I never had a
[1:19:00] real relationship with you. And yet they
[1:19:04] were saying, didn't we do many mighty
[1:19:06] works? Amen. They wouldn't say those
[1:19:08] words if nothing had ever happened.
[1:19:10] That's right. But we take that oh as a
[1:19:13] sign that God was uh approval of what we
[1:19:17] were doing. But my brother and sister,
[1:19:18] God said, "Look, I did that because
[1:19:20] somebody in the audience had faith and
[1:19:22] they needed to be lifted up by the word.
[1:19:24] They needed some encouragement. They
[1:19:26] needed a deliverance. I did it for them.
[1:19:29] I didn't do it for you because you don't
[1:19:31] even know me." Oh my, what a just almost
[1:19:35] brutal position to be in as a preacher.
[1:19:38] Amen. That there would be deliverance
[1:19:40] something come to the people and deliver
[1:19:42] the people because their faith rising up
[1:19:45] just listening to the prophet. And he
[1:19:47] says, "Now look at that. I'm seeing now.
[1:19:49] Look at that. It's moving. It's moving
[1:19:51] across the uh the audience." Oh. And now
[1:19:54] it's now fallen on that little black
[1:19:57] sister right there. And you hear the
[1:19:59] sister on the tape crying
[1:20:04] out. And he says, "Oh, there it is now
[1:20:07] falling on that sister." And my brother
[1:20:09] and sister, they weren't there just in
[1:20:12] some emotional realm, but God moving so
[1:20:15] powerfully. Amen. But then the prophet
[1:20:17] of God also says, "Now look, see how
[1:20:20] that spirit, that spirit there, it needs
[1:20:22] help. It's crying out to this other
[1:20:25] spirit." And people would be like, "Oh,
[1:20:27] you know, I was so glad there was
[1:20:29] somebody else felt the same way I did in
[1:20:33] church." Hallelujah. What a what a what
[1:20:36] a position it would be in. Now, look at
[1:20:40] this once again. Make sure I want to
[1:20:42] clarify this. There'll be people
[1:20:44] listening to this maybe, possibly. Amen.
[1:20:48] I've just just like you, Lord, I realize
[1:20:51] I need more of you. Amen. I need you to
[1:20:54] make a a deposit in me, but Lord, I I
[1:20:57] need to make sure that I'm worthy as it
[1:21:00] were. Now, I'm not talking about worthy
[1:21:01] like in works, but just Lord, my life
[1:21:04] cleaned up a vessel of honor. You know,
[1:21:06] we've went through this, preached this
[1:21:07] quite a few years ago. For a vessel of
[1:21:10] honor to be clean inside and outside,
[1:21:13] that means somebody's got to be serious
[1:21:15] enough. They didn't just look at the
[1:21:16] vessel for what it looked like, but they
[1:21:18] were willing to reach down inside of the
[1:21:21] vessel. Are we willing to reach down
[1:21:23] inside of our vessel? Amen. And reach
[1:21:26] down inside of that vessel and clean the
[1:21:29] inside so that the inside is just as
[1:21:32] clean as the outside. Because we're not
[1:21:34] here for a show. Amen. We're here to be
[1:21:37] a vessel of honor. Amen. Now, Brother
[1:21:40] Brham says in the sermon, "Why Little
[1:21:42] Bethlehem?" He says, "Nice to be here
[1:21:45] this morning." And now, I believe we're
[1:21:47] going to have a special. Brother
[1:21:49] Williams was telling me by someone from
[1:21:51] his
[1:21:52] church. A sister sings, "Fill my cup,
[1:21:55] Lord." That's what we're here for this
[1:21:58] morning. Raising up our cups. Amen. Can
[1:22:01] we lift up our cup tonight? Amen. Fill
[1:22:04] it, Lord. This is the only time that
[1:22:06] we'll have the opportunity to ask this.
[1:22:09] There'll come a time where we'll be on
[1:22:11] the other side, we won't have that
[1:22:14] opportunity. So, while we do have it,
[1:22:17] and in our right mind, I just love how
[1:22:21] he's putting that. Come a time, we're
[1:22:24] here, the opportunity. We're on this
[1:22:27] side of the threshold. We're on this
[1:22:30] side
[1:22:31] of, as one brother I know puts it, we're
[1:22:34] on the proper side right now of the
[1:22:37] dirt.
[1:22:39] Yeah. We won't have that opportunity.
[1:22:41] So, while we do have it, and in our
[1:22:43] right mind, I think one of the most
[1:22:45] sensible things that anyone can do while
[1:22:48] God has given us the opportunity to do
[1:22:50] so is to do it. Get our cups filled now.
[1:22:54] Amen. With his love, Amen. and mercy.
[1:22:59] Oh my. You see, we've been given this
[1:23:03] opportunity as it
[1:23:05] is to come with a confidence born of the
[1:23:09] word, a boldness that is not a carnal.
[1:23:13] You know, you meet people, I always find
[1:23:15] this interesting, believers that were
[1:23:18] just born.
[1:23:20] Um, you know, two brothers that I know,
[1:23:23] one brother says of the other one, he
[1:23:25] could sell a horse a glass of water. And
[1:23:28] the other brother makes the comment and
[1:23:30] says, "I couldn't even beg a horse to
[1:23:33] come drink my water." Two so different
[1:23:37] natural personalities.
[1:23:40] One just works for somebody and the
[1:23:43] other guy is his big bold I've got a
[1:23:45] business and you're going to buy from me
[1:23:47] kind of a guy. Amen. two opposite kind
[1:23:50] of
[1:23:51] personalities. But that's not the kind
[1:23:53] of boldness God's looking for. Amen.
[1:23:56] They are both good believers, good,
[1:23:58] solid men. Amen. So God uses both. But
[1:24:02] the one who is the very more timid type
[1:24:04] of a brother, he just does, I heard the
[1:24:07] brother make a comment that um boy, I've
[1:24:10] done all this work on this and I I sure
[1:24:14] hope my boss is happy.
[1:24:17] That's not a bold
[1:24:19] approach. The other guy, the other
[1:24:22] brother is kind of like, I'll just
[1:24:24] convince them that this is as good as it
[1:24:26] gets and they want it. And so you see
[1:24:30] two opposite. But you see it, it's not a
[1:24:32] confidence born of flesh. This is a
[1:24:35] confidence born of the word. Amen. Not a
[1:24:38] carnal boldness. Amen. You can be that
[1:24:41] meek brother of faith and God answers
[1:24:44] prayer. Amen. But you you come and you
[1:24:47] look at that that God uses the
[1:24:48] personality. And I'll tell you where the
[1:24:51] bride where she gets her boldness. It
[1:24:53] comes from the open word that's been
[1:24:55] revealed to the bride. There's where her
[1:24:58] boldness is. She is not here arrogant,
[1:25:01] boastful, proud. She's here saying, "I
[1:25:05] see clearly who I am in Jesus Christ. I
[1:25:09] see it. I don't have to question it. I
[1:25:13] see it. And thank you, Lord, I had the
[1:25:16] ears to hear the word. And thank you,
[1:25:18] Lord, that I had an open heart to
[1:25:20] receive the word. And thank you, Lord,
[1:25:23] that I had a boldness to declare the
[1:25:26] word. In other words, this is my word.
[1:25:30] Malachi 4:5, behold, I send you. Amen.
[1:25:35] There's got to be a people out there
[1:25:36] that read that that aren't saying, "Oh,
[1:25:38] that was for this or for that." My
[1:25:40] brother and sister, I read that. I thank
[1:25:42] the Lord for many, many years. I read
[1:25:44] that and say that's right. God sent a
[1:25:46] prophet to this age for me. Amen. And
[1:25:50] that's not arrogant. That's not
[1:25:51] boastful. That's not proud. It's
[1:25:53] understanding who you are that God loved
[1:25:57] us so much, my brother and sister, that
[1:26:00] he would send a prophet to come down and
[1:26:02] give us the word that we could receive
[1:26:05] it and stand and say, "Lord, now I have
[1:26:07] revelation to come boldly to your
[1:26:10] throne.
[1:26:11] I have children not saved. Lord, I'm not
[1:26:14] going to back up. I believe it. I have
[1:26:18] needs, Lord. I have needs in my body,
[1:26:21] needs in in whatever it might be, the
[1:26:23] family in general. I have needs. Not to
[1:26:26] come as the beggar. Please, Lord, you
[1:26:28] said please, but to come and say, Lord,
[1:26:31] I've done all that you asked me to do.
[1:26:33] I've stood on the word. I'm living the
[1:26:35] word. I want to be that example. is my
[1:26:39] boss. I think I shared it at the church.
[1:26:41] Maybe not. One of the young men in South
[1:26:43] Africa, he he contacts me uh um every so
[1:26:47] often, not not super regular, but he
[1:26:50] just had to share with me uh how it was.
[1:26:53] And he's in the university kind of
[1:26:55] finishing up and and uh so there is um I
[1:27:00] don't know how you say this. I just I
[1:27:02] just look at it this way. It's all
[1:27:03] black, brown, white. Amen. So in Africa,
[1:27:06] you're either black, colored, or white.
[1:27:09] That that's just plain and simple. They
[1:27:11] they don't have all this weird vibe
[1:27:13] about what color they are. And so here
[1:27:15] he is, a colored young man's colored uh
[1:27:18] and uh and uh he's in the university and
[1:27:22] uh there's this black girl that uh he uh
[1:27:25] uh has a lot of interaction with and he
[1:27:27] started to witness to her and uh they
[1:27:30] would oftent times on their lunch break
[1:27:32] from school uh go sit in the cafeteria
[1:27:35] and they would talk about the Bible and
[1:27:37] he started witnessing to her and he
[1:27:40] asked her would would you read something
[1:27:41] I give it to you and she said And so he
[1:27:44] starts giving her some message material.
[1:27:47] Next thing he knows, that little girl's
[1:27:49] friend has picked up her literature
[1:27:51] because she's curious about what her
[1:27:53] friend is reading. And uh so then the
[1:27:56] one girl, the first girl decides, you
[1:27:58] know what? I believe this and I'm going
[1:28:00] to get baptized. And she shares it with
[1:28:02] her friend. I'm going to get baptized. I
[1:28:04] I believe this. I believe it's in the
[1:28:06] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is
[1:28:08] makes sense to me. It's what I've been
[1:28:10] searching for. And her friend says,
[1:28:12] "Well, I I was a little embarrassed, you
[1:28:14] know, because I thought you might kind
[1:28:16] of look at me, but I actually when I
[1:28:18] first picked it up and started reading,
[1:28:20] I I just was like, "Wow, wow, this makes
[1:28:24] so much sense. I go to church and they
[1:28:25] talk about this tradition and talk about
[1:28:27] that and it don't make any sense." And
[1:28:29] then they had a third friend that's
[1:28:30] like, "What's going on with you guys?"
[1:28:32] Amen. I'll just tell you here just
[1:28:34] recently, they baptized all three of
[1:28:36] them. Amen. And you see God is still
[1:28:38] working. And he doesn't have to have
[1:28:40] some perfect formula that we got to drag
[1:28:43] them to church and we got to shove a
[1:28:44] prophet down their throat. My brother
[1:28:46] and sister, it's that seed that's
[1:28:48] inside. And when we come and present it
[1:28:51] correctly, God will come and shine
[1:28:54] light, but the seed's got to be there
[1:28:56] first. Amen. You can have the sun shine
[1:28:59] on these fields all you want, but if
[1:29:02] there's no seed in that field, it's not
[1:29:05] going to grow.
[1:29:07] Amen. So, you'll find, I just say this
[1:29:09] as a matter of note, you'll find that in
[1:29:11] the system of America, Amen, that things
[1:29:14] change like the Midwest, things change
[1:29:17] so much. They go from too wet to too
[1:29:19] dry. They go from too dry to too wet.
[1:29:22] The market goes from too cheap to high.
[1:29:24] And it can do it all in a matter of
[1:29:26] time. And you will find farmers in the
[1:29:28] Midwest will tell you, "If the seed's
[1:29:30] not in the ground, you'll not have seed
[1:29:34] in the bin."
[1:29:35] And so that's why people are like, why
[1:29:37] are they out there planting in bone dry
[1:29:40] ground? Because more often than not, the
[1:29:43] rain will come and they will have a
[1:29:46] bountiful harvest. Amen. And so it
[1:29:49] doesn't matter that we are here. We
[1:29:52] shouldn't be careful, my brother and
[1:29:53] sister, about what will the world
[1:29:55] thinks. my oh I I I'll probably you know
[1:29:58] shouldn't be quite so bold but you know
[1:30:01] it's interesting that we're now in the
[1:30:03] last little very brief period of time
[1:30:07] this whole prophecy of the papacy
[1:30:11] and people are coming out very boldly a
[1:30:14] man just come out the other day he's a
[1:30:16] minister lead pastor in a very large
[1:30:19] church and he says let's face the
[1:30:23] facts Catholicism is not
[1:30:27] Christianity. That's pretty bold
[1:30:29] statement in the world we live in. Amen.
[1:30:31] But here's a man that's basically not
[1:30:33] using these exact words, but saying,
[1:30:36] "Look, it's the truth and it may as well
[1:30:38] be spoken because this means if the
[1:30:41] prophecy of the papacy, it has any truth
[1:30:44] to it all, there is nothing beyond what
[1:30:48] this is." Now, remember, this pope could
[1:30:50] serve another 20 years. So, let's not be
[1:30:53] thinking that it's all over tomorrow,
[1:30:55] next week. But you see, my brother and
[1:30:57] sister, how it is. We're coming down to
[1:30:59] a time it won't matter. Those that are
[1:31:01] timid can remain timid. Amen. Those that
[1:31:04] are are
[1:31:05] are, you know, filthy remain filthy, and
[1:31:09] those that are holy remain holy. Amen.
[1:31:11] But you look at that. Amen. We want to
[1:31:13] have a boldness of the word. Not a
[1:31:15] carnal boldness, but we want it to come
[1:31:17] from the open book. We want to be able
[1:31:20] to look in here and say, "You know what?
[1:31:22] Here it
[1:31:23] is." Amen. And you know what separates
[1:31:27] this? This boldness coming from the open
[1:31:29] word. The bride believes every word.
[1:31:33] Amen. I love how Brother Brandham puts
[1:31:35] that out there. He says, you know, this
[1:31:37] is going to be a sign. She's going to
[1:31:40] believe every word. She's going to say
[1:31:42] amen to every word of God.
[1:31:47] Oh my. Okay, we're getting close to
[1:31:50] being done here. And that's good because
[1:31:52] it's nine o'clock and the seven church
[1:31:55] ages. Amen. Revelation of Jesus
[1:31:58] Christ. Now, where will the gentile
[1:32:00] church be while Jesus is making himself
[1:32:03] known to his brethren? Remember that the
[1:32:06] bride of Joseph with the two children
[1:32:09] were in the palace. For Joseph had
[1:32:12] commanded, "Let everyone leave me. put
[1:32:15] them all out from before me. So the
[1:32:18] gentile bride was hidden in the palace
[1:32:20] of Joseph. Wh where will the gentile
[1:32:24] church go in the rapture into the
[1:32:27] palace? The bride will be taken off the
[1:32:30] earth. She will be caught up before the
[1:32:32] great tribulation to meet her Lord in
[1:32:35] the air. Amen. Let's not be bashful.
[1:32:39] Let's be bold. Thank you Lord. Oh my. So
[1:32:42] many misunderstandings. So many
[1:32:44] misinterpretations. A few things popping
[1:32:46] up here just in the last few days and
[1:32:49] people are saying, "Well, you know, when
[1:32:51] the tribulation comes and they take our
[1:32:54] churches away from us and all of this
[1:32:56] happens, we're going to be prepared
[1:32:58] because we have stored up the food in
[1:33:01] our
[1:33:06] house. Where will the gentile bride be?
[1:33:10] Not in our house.
[1:33:12] Amen. will be in his house. That's
[1:33:14] right. And so these kind of
[1:33:16] interpretations, what it is, I'll just
[1:33:18] be bold and blunt about it. It's
[1:33:19] fear-mongering. It's causing the people
[1:33:22] that what are we going to do when they
[1:33:23] slam the doors? You know, I really don't
[1:33:25] care, my brother and sister. Uh they
[1:33:27] they come and one day would have
[1:33:30] barricaded the doors of this church
[1:33:32] because I see what the prophet said and
[1:33:34] he said it would be something that would
[1:33:36] drive us into desperation.
[1:33:39] So even if they're not hunting or
[1:33:40] pursuing or or causing that, you know,
[1:33:44] uh it it's all there. It wouldn't
[1:33:46] matter. We're believers in the good
[1:33:48] times and in the bad times in the valley
[1:33:53] and on the mountaintop. Sister Ruth,
[1:33:55] would you come? Sister Vanessa. Amen.
[1:33:58] You see, we are the
[1:34:02] bride and he has claimed us and he's
[1:34:05] already got a home for us. That's right.
[1:34:08] Amen. You know, I won't say where, but I
[1:34:11] find this interesting how certain
[1:34:13] ministers have a way of approaching
[1:34:14] things. Had a brother tell me here
[1:34:16] recently, a young man come to him,
[1:34:18] expressed interest. He said, "Uh, I I've
[1:34:21] done it all correct, pastor, and um so,
[1:34:24] you know, I've spoke to her father and
[1:34:28] um he's given me permission to to court
[1:34:31] and then I've spoke to her father and he
[1:34:34] gave me permission to speak strongly to
[1:34:36] her and I've spoke strongly to her and
[1:34:39] she has, you know, in essence given me
[1:34:42] permission to take that next step." And
[1:34:45] the pastor said, "Stop right there. I
[1:34:48] don't want to hear another word out of
[1:34:49] you until you have a house to take her
[1:34:52] to. And the young man told the pastor,
[1:34:55] "But that might be years." And he said,
[1:34:58] "That ought to motivate you to work hard
[1:35:01] and
[1:35:01] fast." And I thought that might be a bit
[1:35:04] extreme, but I know the brother and his
[1:35:07] his approach to it. He was referring to
[1:35:10] this. Amen. You got a bride, you got to
[1:35:12] have a house to take her to. And that
[1:35:14] brother caught that young man offguard
[1:35:16] and he's like, "I'll never get married."
[1:35:18] And he says, "No, this is your
[1:35:20] motivation." Amen. And lo and behold,
[1:35:24] within three months, the young man found
[1:35:26] a nice little house on a reasonable
[1:35:28] price, got a raise at work, put money on
[1:35:32] the house, and then he come back to the
[1:35:33] pastor, "Do I have your permission?" And
[1:35:36] he said, "You even amazed me." Amen. So,
[1:35:39] you look at that, my brother and sister.
[1:35:42] God's already got it all settled. We got
[1:35:44] a home to go to. We're not going to be a
[1:35:46] homeless bride. Amen. We've got a home
[1:35:48] to go to. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's just
[1:35:52] stand and and sing a song or two if you
[1:35:54] don't mind. Amen. Just kind of struck
[1:35:57] me. I'd like to sing
[1:35:59] 580.
[1:36:00] Amen.
[1:36:02] Amen. We don't want to sit back and act
[1:36:04] like that. We just uh we just got to
[1:36:07] wait. We just got to endure. No, this is
[1:36:10] a battle. We're soldiers. We're
[1:36:12] fighting. Amen. We're going to defeat
[1:36:14] the enemy. We're going to stand up. You
[1:36:17] see, when David killed
[1:36:20] Goliath, that wasn't the last time that
[1:36:23] he had a battle. Amen. And we look at
[1:36:26] all the scriptural, spiritual types, you
[1:36:29] know, of five. Amen. Jesus and faith,
[1:36:33] all of these things through the word, he
[1:36:35] had to keep right on applying it. Amen.
[1:36:38] Oh, killing Goliath put him in a
[1:36:40] position of notoriety. Everyone knew who
[1:36:43] David was after that. But my brother and
[1:36:45] sister, just because you're known. Oh,
[1:36:48] they're a believer. Good, faithful
[1:36:50] people. Doesn't mean the battle's over.
[1:36:52] Amen. We got to fight. Amen. Am I a
[1:36:58] soldier of the cross, a follower of the
[1:37:05] lamb?
[1:37:07] And shall I fear to own his cause or
[1:37:13] blush to speak his
[1:37:17] name? And when the battle's over, we
[1:37:22] shall wear a crown. We shall wear a
[1:37:25] crown. Yes, we shall wear a crown. And
[1:37:30] when the battle's over, we shall wear a
[1:37:34] crown in the new
[1:37:37] [Music]
[1:37:40] Jerusalem. I'll wear a
[1:37:43] crown. I'll wear a
[1:37:46] crown. Wear a bright and shining crown.
[1:37:53] And when the battle's over, we shall
[1:37:57] wear a crown in the new
[1:38:03] Jerusalem. Must I be carried to the
[1:38:10] skies on flowery breads of
[1:38:15] ease? While others fought to win the
[1:38:21] prize and sail the blood is
[1:38:26] seas. And when the battle's over, we
[1:38:31] shall wear a crown.
[1:38:34] We shall wear a crown. Yes, we shall
[1:38:38] wear a crown. And when the battle's
[1:38:42] over, we shall wear a crown in the new
[1:38:50] Jerusalem. Wear a
[1:38:52] crown. Oh, wear a
[1:38:56] crown. Wear a bright and shining crown.
[1:39:02] And when the battle's over, we shall
[1:39:07] wear a crown in that new
[1:39:13] Jerusalem. Are there no place for me to
[1:39:19] face? Must I not stem the flood?
[1:39:26] Is this vow world a friend to grace to
[1:39:32] help me on to
[1:39:36] God? And when the battle's over, we
[1:39:41] shall wear a crown. Oh, we shall wear a
[1:39:45] crown. We shall wear a crown. And when
[1:39:50] the battle's over, we shall wear a
[1:39:54] crown. In the new
[1:40:00] Jerusalem, wear a
[1:40:03] crown. Wear a
[1:40:06] crown. Wear a bright and shining crown.
[1:40:13] And when the battle's over, we shall
[1:40:17] wear a crown in the new
[1:40:23] Jerusalem. Sure, I must fight if I would
[1:40:30] rain. Increase my courage,
[1:40:35] Lord. I'll bear the toil,
[1:40:39] endure the pain.
[1:40:42] supported by thy. Now, let's make it
[1:40:46] personal. And when my battle's over, I
[1:40:51] shall wear a crown. Yes, I shall wear a
[1:40:55] crown. Yes, I shall wear a crown. And
[1:40:59] when my battles over, I shall wear a
[1:41:04] crown in the new Jerusalem.

[1:41:15] crown. Wear a bright and shining
[1:41:21] crown. And when my battle's over, I
[1:41:26] shall wear a crown in the new
[1:41:32] Jerusalem. God bless you, saints. Amen,
[1:41:35] brother Isaac. Hallelujah.

[1:44:45] Amen. Amen. Just that song came to my
[1:44:48] mind, you know, just thinking about
[1:44:50] Israel coming into Canaan's land. Do you
