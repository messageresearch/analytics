[32:28] Hallelujah good to see our brother David
[32:31] Nash
[32:32] amen glad you're back again amen each
[32:35] and every one of you tonight
[32:37] amen I think this is a wonderful time
[32:40] tonight I'm already excited I uh
[32:43] speaking on our journey
[32:45] uh you know sometimes you have a hard
[32:48] time
[32:48] uh putting a title to things
[32:52] and uh taking from what the prophet had
[32:55] said I
[32:56] had
[32:59] titled this tonight a true expression of
[33:01] faith
[33:03] and then as brother Trevor was just
[33:05] speaking
[33:06] there and he spoke out the word
[33:08] interrupt just struck me
[33:11] that maybe was a title that should have
[33:12] been interrupted on the road
[33:14] amen Hallelujah let's turn to mark five
[33:19] you know the Book of Mark thank you
[33:21] musicians is wonderful
[33:23] Amen brother Alex
[33:25] amen
[33:27] the fifth chapter of Mark is such a
[33:30] power pack
[33:31] it's such just got so much in it that I
[33:36] think uh sometimes maybe Overlook it a
[33:39] lot of stories as it were if you want to
[33:42] use those words
[33:43] but we're going to just go to the 22nd
[33:46] verse
[33:48] and we're going to talk about gyrus for
[33:51] a few minutes uh this evening by God's
[33:54] grace
[33:55] amen
[33:59] Mark 5 22.
[34:02] and behold there cometh one of the
[34:04] rulers
[34:06] of the synagogue Jairus by name
[34:09] and when he saw him he fell at his feet
[34:11] and besought him greatly saying my
[34:14] little daughter lieth at the point of
[34:17] death
[34:18] I pray thee come
[34:21] and lay thy hands on her
[34:23] that she may be healed and she shall
[34:27] live
[34:29] that is
[34:30] a strong statement of faith amen
[34:35] and Jesus went with him and much people
[34:38] followed him and thronged him
[34:41] Heavenly Father we just ask you to come
[34:43] and help us father as we just go through
[34:46] your scripture your word tonight let it
[34:49] speak to our hearts we ask in the name
[34:52] of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated
[35:02] we see here
[35:04] that Jesus
[35:06] as Jairus comes to him we recognize that
[35:09] there was something that compelled
[35:11] Jairus now my brother and sister you'd
[35:14] say well it was maybe the sickness or
[35:16] illness incurable that his daughter had
[35:19] but my brother and sister there's many
[35:21] people on the Earth today who's had
[35:23] family members even children that were
[35:25] to the point of death that never sought
[35:28] the face of God so we recognize that
[35:31] there was something even greater that
[35:32] was moving Jairus and it even caused
[35:35] Jairus to come to a place that he he had
[35:38] to move against even the tenets of his
[35:41] own church of his own teaching but there
[35:44] was a desire there was something down in
[35:47] his soul and so he speaks to Jesus these
[35:51] very positive words and declares that if
[35:54] you'll just come and you lay the hands
[35:56] he isn't even asking for prayer just lay
[35:59] your hands on her and she will be healed
[36:02] and will live and and so Jesus is moved
[36:07] by this and I believe this was just a
[36:09] Divine appointment that was a a place
[36:12] you might say in time that God Blocked
[36:15] out to even come into the religious
[36:18] world and to reach out to one in that
[36:22] world and and and still something in
[36:25] them to just show my brother and sister
[36:27] as we were speaking on Sunday the Great
[36:30] and the small uh or the small and the
[36:33] greatest how the scripture placed it you
[36:34] see God is going to reach now the
[36:37] intellectual as the scripture says is is
[36:39] going to have a hard time seeing the
[36:41] Revelation and they they look into it so
[36:45] deep they actually look past the very
[36:47] move of God but it's there that God is
[36:50] going to call those men of great
[36:52] intelligence of great positions for the
[36:55] small and the great amen and so it's
[36:57] there that as Jairus starts and he's
[37:00] going down the road now towards as Jesus
[37:04] starts down the road to jairus's house
[37:06] you know sometimes my brother and sister
[37:08] we have to recognize distractions are
[37:11] part of God's plan
[37:13] we sometimes think oh I was started in a
[37:16] certain way and got distracted but you
[37:18] know sometimes distractions are are in
[37:22] God's plan amen but we need to know the
[37:24] difference amen because Satan's
[37:27] distraction turns our Focus away God's
[37:30] distraction just puts things in God's
[37:33] time amen sometimes we get ahead of
[37:36] God's plan a little bit and God allows
[37:39] us to be distracted a little bit my
[37:41] brother and sister look at how it was
[37:43] brother branham's there the plane is
[37:45] grounded the Holy Spirit starts to deal
[37:47] with him he goes and now the holy
[37:50] spirit's telling him turn here walk down
[37:52] this street and here's Aunt Jemima
[37:54] leaning on the gate post with the Dew
[37:56] upon her now you might say well brother
[37:58] Branham had places to go he had things
[38:01] to do you know this plane being grounded
[38:04] for the moment was a distraction was it
[38:06] or was it just part of God's plan to put
[38:09] brother Branham at the sidewalk at Aunt
[38:12] Jemima's house amen and to see years
[38:15] later a young man as a bell there in the
[38:19] railroad station to say you know what
[38:21] that was a time and thank you I gave my
[38:23] heart to God and life is good and so we
[38:26] can sometimes get so caught up in the
[38:29] moment of time to not really see the
[38:32] leadership that God is bringing and so
[38:35] you know as we'll look now into going
[38:38] back to the scripture verse 25 and going
[38:40] down we're we're going to leave this for
[38:43] another time but you'll see 25 through
[38:46] 34 is a story of the woman with a blood
[38:49] issue and and we're not going to touch
[38:51] on that other than to say here was
[38:54] another or a distraction amen that come
[38:58] and and I didn't State the first one and
[39:00] the first one is the scripture says that
[39:02] the crowds were thronging Jesus
[39:05] and so there was this distraction of all
[39:08] of this going on all these things around
[39:10] him and there was that distraction yet
[39:13] the door was open for Jairus to come and
[39:16] pour out his heart to our lord Jesus and
[39:19] it's there as he starts to gyrus's house
[39:22] we see the woman the sister we we would
[39:25] type it I guess that has a blood issue
[39:28] and then this becomes as a another you
[39:32] might say distraction but is there
[39:34] anyone coming
[39:36] to be touched by our God a distraction
[39:40] amen
[39:41] my brother and sister it never is God's
[39:44] plan is perfect he places each one of us
[39:46] you and I in the right place at the
[39:49] right time amen you know you read
[39:51] stories so Through the Ages and and you
[39:54] kind of Wonder are stories like there
[39:56] was a time of an altar call in a church
[39:58] an on message church but an altar
[40:00] calling a church and there was a young
[40:02] man in a great struggle of life and and
[40:04] he was struggling when you when you
[40:07] share that brother Trevor it it touches
[40:10] on me to this story and here was here
[40:13] was a young man sitting in the back of
[40:15] the church and and he in his heart
[40:17] saying I know I need to go up and give
[40:19] my life to Christ but this and but that
[40:22] and you know relatives in the church and
[40:24] all kinds of things and it was when God
[40:27] finally moves upon him and he comes to
[40:30] the front the preacher was done
[40:33] never prays for him
[40:35] when the young man got up from the altar
[40:37] that day
[40:39] the only thought he had because of some
[40:42] wrong teaching was God failed to meet me
[40:45] here
[40:46] because he believed the preacher needed
[40:49] to come and lay hands on him to make it
[40:52] all worthwhile
[40:53] but with the right teaching to realize
[40:56] that it was God Amen the Holy Spirit was
[41:00] who is meeting him here and it's there
[41:03] that we need to have that understanding
[41:04] how that anchored that God always keeps
[41:08] his appointments amen and it was many
[41:11] years the reason the story is a story it
[41:13] was many years ago before the young man
[41:16] no longer a young man was moved again of
[41:19] the Holy Spirit to give his heart to God
[41:22] years were wasted because a preacher
[41:24] decided the service was finished
[41:30] and he gives his heart that time God put
[41:32] someone in his life that said if we have
[41:35] to stay here all night
[41:38] God will meet you here if we have to
[41:41] stay all night
[41:46] my
[41:48] God keeps his appointments
[41:51] so as we look at that we realize in the
[41:53] story
[41:55] the Lord
[41:57] needed to meet her
[41:59] also amen amen now let's move on to
[42:03] verse 35.
[42:05] while he yet spake in other words
[42:07] telling this daughter thy faith had made
[42:09] the whole go in peace and be whole of
[42:12] that plague amen so it's there that as
[42:15] while he yet spake there come from the
[42:18] ruler of the synagogue's house certain
[42:20] which said that daughter is dead why
[42:23] trouble is thou the master any further
[42:27] well they certainly had the dialogue
[42:29] correct to call him Master amen and you
[42:33] know my brother and sister it seems like
[42:35] in every move of God there's always a
[42:39] messenger that shows up that just has to
[42:42] throw the wet blanket on what God is
[42:45] doing amen so no doubt this messenger
[42:48] that come from the house had good
[42:51] intentions but was not very spiritual
[42:53] still maybe trained up in the church as
[42:56] he's coming from jairus's house and the
[42:59] church really didn't look for the
[43:01] supernatural the church had its mind
[43:03] already made up what God was going to do
[43:05] and how the Messiah was going to come
[43:08] and everything had to fit in its little
[43:10] box now my brother and sister putting
[43:12] things in boxes is good that's called
[43:15] organization amen not in the sense of
[43:17] men over men but organization outside of
[43:21] chaos or disorganization so it's nice to
[43:24] put things in a box right we can in a
[43:27] sense say well we've come and by God's
[43:30] grace we recognize baptism and we can
[43:34] figuratively put it in the box that we
[43:36] by God's grace see baptism we get to see
[43:39] the deity of Christ we're going to put
[43:41] that in the Box do you follow me amen so
[43:43] to be organized in our thinking instead
[43:46] of chaotic is wonderful but here comes a
[43:49] messenger from the house and and he has
[43:52] I believe probably good intentions of
[43:54] hey she's dead it's it's finished we
[43:57] we're we're done here you might as well
[43:59] just let Jesus go off and and and uh you
[44:02] know deal with other things or rest or
[44:04] whatever so why bother him but my
[44:07] brother and sister you know sometimes
[44:09] God works in spite of our lack of
[44:13] spiritual understanding in fact of our
[44:16] lack of Revelation in fact our lack of
[44:19] reverence a lack of attention we could
[44:22] go through several of those adjectives
[44:24] that would describe our lack but my
[44:26] brother and sisters will look at this
[44:28] God would be in this situation and he's
[44:32] in control can you say amen I don't care
[44:34] what your day was today God was in
[44:37] control amen so you know I would just
[44:40] put this as we would go to move on here
[44:42] Lord help us to be the right kind of
[44:45] messenger amen even if a day is tough a
[44:49] situation is tough Lord let the words
[44:52] that come from my mouth let the words
[44:54] that pass from my lips be the kind of
[44:56] words that will not be negative
[44:59] I tell you I have to work on that Saints
[45:02] it's not an easy thing sometimes to to
[45:04] just be able to speak the positive all
[45:07] the time I just read a deal I won't go
[45:09] in it because I'll butcher it but it was
[45:11] talking about how the the pessimists and
[45:14] The Optimist are common and I think I'll
[45:17] go ahead and say it the pessimist says
[45:19] things couldn't get worse and the
[45:22] Optimus says oh yes they can
[45:27] oh my
[45:29] God but The Optimist wasn't really
[45:31] giving an optimistic message he thought
[45:34] he was
[45:35] oh no don't worry it can get worse my
[45:39] brother and sister Lord help us to be
[45:41] the right kind of messenger now in the
[45:44] sermon amen that we look here real quick
[45:48] uh in message law amen we'll come
[45:53] go ahead and bounce that forward their
[45:55] brothers
[45:56] amen right there
[45:59] now Paul speaking here of the valley
[46:03] or the shadow rather the law being the
[46:05] shadow of good things to come and could
[46:08] never make the worshiper perfect then he
[46:11] goes on to show what Perfection is
[46:13] aren't you glad that it's been revealed
[46:15] to us what Perfection is amen otherwise
[46:18] we would hear by works be trying to be
[46:23] perfect not not by just simple uh uh uh
[46:27] service to the Lord but literally by
[46:29] works I must do this and I must do that
[46:31] and I must do that my brother and sister
[46:33] that's why you can go to Nepal and
[46:36] you've got people sleeping on Stone beds
[46:38] with no window in the window in the
[46:40] winter time and freezing and suffering
[46:43] in their 40s and already stove up
[46:46] completely because they believe they
[46:48] must suffer like that to be perfect in
[46:51] Christ
[46:54] but Jesus says suffer the little
[46:56] children to come a whole different kind
[46:59] of suffering
[47:01] give opportunity for Make Way for them
[47:04] bring them
[47:06] amen so it's there that God has a
[47:08] different idea Jesus
[47:11] learned obedience by the things that he
[47:14] suffered
[47:15] many trials my brother and sister many
[47:18] things that he suffered but the bride of
[47:20] Christ today we are here tonight as
[47:23] Believers Suffering amen amen now we
[47:27] might go home and climb at a very
[47:28] comfortable bed with plenty of blankets
[47:30] to pull up and and sleep nice and cozy
[47:33] tonight but we find my brother and
[47:35] sister met with the day that we are
[47:37] living in this laodicean age with a
[47:41] constant bombardment from Satan trying
[47:44] to deceive and turn and discourage that
[47:47] the bride of Christ also is learning
[47:49] amen character by suffering she's also
[47:53] learning what it is to be a follower of
[47:55] Christ
[47:56] amen he goes to show what Perfection is
[48:00] now it's a strange thing that this is so
[48:02] much thought of people they say well I'm
[48:04] weak my faith is not very much I'm not a
[48:08] very good Christian oh have we ever said
[48:11] that amen that's just what the devil
[48:13] wants you to say you're just talking his
[48:16] language right then see you mustn't
[48:19] never say that now I don't care my
[48:22] brother and sister were the emotion of
[48:24] the struggle and the battle is and the
[48:26] strain and the weariness and all of
[48:28] these things let's obey the prophet's
[48:31] words and keep those things from our
[48:33] lips Amen to be able to say I I know I
[48:37] failed the Lord today and I know that I
[48:40] can do better but by God's grace I am a
[48:45] Son of God I am a daughter of God and I
[48:48] will overcome amen don't never let your
[48:51] testimony be negative let it be positive
[48:54] all the time I am saved I have God in my
[48:58] heart I believe him with all my heart do
[49:01] you believe in Divine Healing with all
[49:04] my heart
[49:05] amen and I put that quote because I
[49:09] wanted to counter as it is the negative
[49:11] aspect of a servant who probably with
[49:14] good intentions come but said you know
[49:17] what your daughter's dead just leave him
[49:19] be let him go we'll just go home and
[49:22] we'll mourn and we'll do what we must do
[49:25] and I'm here and your other servants and
[49:27] those from the church are here to
[49:29] comfort you but my brother and sister
[49:31] wasn't looking for Comfort was looking
[49:34] for a supernatural Deliverance the
[49:37] supernatural visitation in my house in
[49:41] your house amen not to be comforted
[49:46] but a divine intervention of almighty
[49:49] God to come down that's what we're
[49:51] looking for
[49:52] Hallelujah
[49:55] amen
[49:56] now look at this if we're turned to
[49:58] verse 36 brother Gideon take us back to
[50:01] verse 36.
[50:03] amen
[50:04] now an interruption on the road right
[50:06] there but we're back now amen
[50:09] as soon as Jesus heard the word that was
[50:12] spoken
[50:14] you get that as soon as he didn't say
[50:17] well we'll just let this all shake out
[50:19] and we'll show them otherwise but the
[50:22] point that the prophet of God was
[50:23] speaking in that sermon is right here
[50:26] and the moment amen as soon as Jesus
[50:29] heard the word that was spoken he saith
[50:32] unto the ruler of the synagogue Jairus
[50:34] Be not Afraid only belief what was he
[50:39] doing that spirit that come unwittingly
[50:42] may be out of the mouth of that
[50:44] messenger Jesus was there and he stopped
[50:47] it he put a halt to it right there and
[50:51] he declared to them amen Be not Afraid
[50:54] why my brother and sister it wasn't
[50:57] mourning that come into his heart first
[51:00] thought it was a fear my daughter is
[51:03] actually dead
[51:05] and Jesus says Be not Afraid
[51:09] stop the spirit of fear have you ever
[51:11] noticed how fear comes in many forms and
[51:14] Fashions into our life
[51:17] the man whose paycheck is not big enough
[51:19] is afraid of dealing with the reality of
[51:23] what he has to set down to and so then
[51:25] he becomes wasteful and frivolous
[51:27] because he can't deal with the stress
[51:29] and so he finds himself doing something
[51:31] silly and we find people in all kinds of
[51:34] situations unable to face the fear of a
[51:38] coming or pending event
[51:44] Jesus is here
[51:46] be not afraid
[51:48] only believe
[51:51] oh don't sit there and say but but but
[51:54] take the fear bind it in the name of
[51:57] Jesus Christ believe the promise of God
[52:01] believe that word that God has given
[52:04] amen I say it was relevant then how much
[52:07] more it is relevant to the Bride of
[52:09] Jesus Christ today
[52:11] amen now look my brother and sister you
[52:15] can find I just gonna paraphrase off of
[52:17] this there's lots and lots of quotes
[52:19] where brother branham's talking along
[52:20] this line but I'm telling you my brother
[52:22] and sister we've seen it over and over
[52:24] Through The Years amen that Satan always
[52:27] comes and tries to quench the moving of
[52:30] the spirit we'll have a supernatural
[52:33] service we'll have the moving of God and
[52:36] it's like it don't have to be Monday it
[52:38] can be Wednesday or whatever it be and
[52:40] Satan always comes in and tries to
[52:43] quench that moving of the spirit because
[52:46] if the fire ever gets burning Satan is
[52:50] not a very good fireman
[52:53] hmm
[52:54] he's not at all no he does not know how
[52:57] to put the fire out or there would be no
[52:59] fire in hell
[53:00] if Satan knew how to put the fire out
[53:03] and there would be no lick of fire
[53:05] stirring the hearts of Sons and
[53:07] Daughters of God if Satan knew how to
[53:09] put the fire out
[53:11] but he tries
[53:13] we have to give him some credit he tries
[53:15] to quench the moving of the spirit but
[53:17] look what Jesus is doing Jesus doesn't
[53:19] sort into a dialogue about teaching and
[53:22] this and that what Jesus does is
[53:24] quenches the negative thought he cuts it
[53:27] off when it comes out of the lips of
[53:28] that messenger he quenched the anointing
[53:32] that was on those words he quenched it
[53:35] right there amen a fiery Dart of the
[53:39] enemy amen quenched it right on this
[53:42] spot
[53:43] thank you Lord
[53:45] Hallelujah why
[53:47] only belief
[53:49] only believe he doesn't give him a
[53:50] dialogue of who I am what is happening
[53:53] what the prophet said what this is here
[53:55] what is that and it all speaks of me in
[53:58] this day and no he just speaks to
[54:00] something I hope you catch this
[54:02] something that was already in jairus's
[54:05] heart
[54:06] it was already inside there something
[54:09] that was believing that's what got him
[54:12] out of the chair that's what got him out
[54:14] of the door that's what got him on the
[54:17] road and to come down to find where
[54:19] Jesus was at is because it was already
[54:22] something in there that believed and
[54:25] Jesus was just reminding him of what he
[54:29] had already placed in him
[54:31] oh it was there from the foundation in
[54:34] the world can someone say thank you Lord
[54:36] and he's just reminding us
[54:39] don't let that fiery Dart get you yes it
[54:42] might strike you but I'm here to quench
[54:44] it only believe
[54:47] and the devil's there going no if you
[54:49] can't believe but something inside of
[54:52] you says Jesus said it I believe it I
[54:55] will believe
[54:58] I hope you don't mind if I get excited
[54:59] tonight
[55:01] Hallelujah now look what happens here my
[55:04] brother and sister
[55:05] we look in these next verses 37 38 39.
[55:11] and if you just read that you might say
[55:13] in a sense from a carnal point of view
[55:17] you'd think that Jesus was going to just
[55:19] exclude right he's he's only going to
[55:21] just take his his disciples take some
[55:24] men that were of Faith take them with
[55:26] him to the house
[55:29] but what we realize is
[55:32] when he gets to the house
[55:36] he's in the house
[55:40] death has to fleece
[55:47] yeah
[55:50] amen
[55:54] so he takes Peter and James and John
[55:57] might as well have a power packed group
[56:00] when you go somewhere
[56:02] hmm
[56:04] and he comes to jairus's house
[56:07] and what does he come he comes to chaos
[56:11] something that's loud
[56:13] it's it's a a Brazen sound it's it's
[56:17] just chaos is taking place there and and
[56:20] no doubt my brother and sister the grief
[56:23] the mother is there and and friends and
[56:27] families aunts and uncles and whatever
[56:29] and they were they were weeping and and
[56:32] they were wailing I have been there my
[56:35] brother and sister in the very presence
[56:37] of people when a loved one unexpected as
[56:40] it were you know you look at this and
[56:42] now don't misunderstand me when
[56:44] someone's 95 years old we realize
[56:46] they're living on God's time on Grace
[56:49] but you know a child 12 years old we we
[56:52] do not expect that and and how the shock
[56:55] of that I've been there when a person or
[56:58] a young person has died and to see the
[57:01] utter shock of it slamming into the
[57:03] emotion of a mother and of a father and
[57:06] it's no small thing and we won't speak
[57:08] lightly of that but my brother and
[57:10] sister when Jesus walks into this chaos
[57:13] we would be thinking oh my what will he
[57:16] do she's already dead now we get to look
[57:18] at it from hindsight we see what God
[57:21] chose to do but if we had been standing
[57:23] there on the threshold of the door and
[57:26] seeing Jesus come up and the door being
[57:28] open and see a mother maybe other
[57:30] siblings and aunts and uncles in their
[57:33] grief of oh Lord she died they went to
[57:36] get the master nothing happened
[57:39] but I'll tell you what it is it's times
[57:42] like that that reveals what's really
[57:45] inside of you and I
[57:48] amen could we say I hope I never face
[57:51] that I hope you never face that but I
[57:53] would say by God's grace could we stand
[57:55] and say the lord giveth and the lord
[57:57] taketh away the way of the Lord is
[58:00] perfect our heart may be breaking but we
[58:03] know God's in control
[58:05] but when you've been taught
[58:08] by the church
[58:11] and there's no real anchor
[58:15] that grief is overwhelmed there's no way
[58:17] to just accept
[58:20] I remember many years ago I've shared it
[58:22] here in the church here a young man in
[58:23] Chile
[58:25] he come to the front of the church
[58:27] during the service their port is heart
[58:29] out to the Lord
[58:31] we were praying for him
[58:34] I could not have even told you the words
[58:36] that I spoke over him
[58:38] but we were vocal and there were others
[58:41] close around deacons other ministers
[58:44] some say it was a prophecy
[58:47] to me it was nothing more than just a
[58:49] prayer for a young teenager that was
[58:51] caught up with you know tons and tons of
[58:53] bracelets and rings on his fingers and
[58:55] necklaces raised in a house amen a
[58:58] grandpa who is a pastor a father who is
[59:00] a minister and my heart's breaking for
[59:03] this young man and I just poured my
[59:04] heart out and only a short time later
[59:07] this young man is there in the streets
[59:10] of Santiago and gets hit by a city bus
[59:13] and he's laying there on the street
[59:15] blood coming out of his eyes out of his
[59:18] nose out of his ears and he's not
[59:20] breathing and the Supernatural is going
[59:24] to take place because God cannot fail
[59:28] hey man he had an appointment with a boy
[59:30] that Witnesses said he's dead but the
[59:34] young man that was with him dialed the
[59:37] phone called the Deacon and said Pedro
[59:40] has been hit by a boss and he's dead and
[59:43] that brother being a man of God says put
[59:46] the phone to his ear and he put the
[59:49] phone to his ear and he said in the name
[59:52] of Jesus Christ rise up
[59:56] then all of a sudden his body created a
[59:59] great he
[1:00:02] and he set up and he says what happened
[1:00:04] had no realization of what happened my
[1:00:07] brother and sister they later said oh it
[1:00:09] was a prophecy well my brother and
[1:00:12] sister we won't never put ourselves or
[1:00:14] insert ourself in there but it wasn't
[1:00:16] anyone remembered but that young man did
[1:00:19] when God restored him up and said there
[1:00:21] was something spoke over me and they
[1:00:23] searched back through their Church tapes
[1:00:25] until they came to that service and it
[1:00:28] was there plainly caught on a microphone
[1:00:30] and what was it my brother and sister as
[1:00:33] those brothers were there were
[1:00:34] recognizing that was not brother Paul
[1:00:36] that was God speaking Paul couldn't even
[1:00:40] know my brother and sister and I want
[1:00:42] you to catch this tonight that when it
[1:00:45] comes God has the right words at the
[1:00:48] right time and he'll use the right
[1:00:50] Messenger to give a message of Hope to
[1:00:53] you a message of life to you a message
[1:00:56] of strength to you
[1:00:58] God chooses a messenger a man cannot
[1:01:01] make himself that messenger god does the
[1:01:04] choosing and it might be as the prophet
[1:01:06] of God said one time in that man's life
[1:01:09] that God would use him like that it's up
[1:01:11] to God
[1:01:13] but I tell you what God's got the word
[1:01:15] my brother and sister amen he's got the
[1:01:18] things that he wants to speak at that
[1:01:19] time and I hope you follow my train of
[1:01:22] thought there and when Jesus came in
[1:01:24] amen verse 39 when he came in he saith
[1:01:28] to them will I make ye this Ado and weep
[1:01:32] they bustle thought he was crazy
[1:01:35] here's the bed here's a little girl 12
[1:01:38] years old she's laying there she's dead
[1:01:40] what do you mean weeping and making it a
[1:01:43] do you must be out of your mind
[1:01:46] a daughter a granddaughter
[1:01:49] a niece whatever she might have been
[1:01:52] she's dead
[1:01:54] but I tell you what they didn't
[1:01:55] understand my brother and sister the
[1:01:57] power of the word that had come in their
[1:02:01] hour and I wonder sometimes if we
[1:02:04] understand the power of the word that
[1:02:07] has come in our hour
[1:02:09] the prophet of God encouraging a mother
[1:02:12] a housewife you lay your hands on them
[1:02:15] and pray the prayer of faith do we
[1:02:17] understand that power Amen to be
[1:02:20] consecrated and stand on the promise of
[1:02:23] God and speak it out and declare it my
[1:02:26] brothers do we understand the power God
[1:02:29] has given us
[1:02:35] the damsels Not Dead
[1:02:38] but sleepeth
[1:02:42] I can tell you what those waning moments
[1:02:45] of her life must have been life for
[1:02:46] those people
[1:02:49] Once Upon a Time
[1:02:51] in the wee hours of a morning come
[1:02:53] across the car wreck out in the desert
[1:02:55] out here in Oregon
[1:02:58] I got their three little children into
[1:03:00] my truck
[1:03:02] I couldn't convince the man and his wife
[1:03:04] they said no help will come quickly and
[1:03:06] I'm thinking where do you think you're
[1:03:07] at
[1:03:12] the lady went into shock
[1:03:15] her eyes rolling up in her head
[1:03:17] breathing become very ragged
[1:03:20] I had to go out in the cold myself cross
[1:03:22] a barbed wire fence and climb up a hill
[1:03:23] and stand at the top up there on my cell
[1:03:25] phone
[1:03:28] where's the ambulance
[1:03:31] after I called this lady so many times
[1:03:34] she would answer the phone
[1:03:36] it's going to be all right Paul
[1:03:39] 9-1-1 operator yeah no call of 9-1-1
[1:03:43] what can we do for you she recognized
[1:03:46] the number This Guy's in the middle of
[1:03:47] nowhere
[1:03:49] my brother and sister as I watched life
[1:03:52] ebb from that woman's body
[1:03:56] I myself became frantic
[1:04:01] I told the 911 operator if she dies in
[1:04:03] my truck I'll never forgive you
[1:04:09] four hours for an ambulance to show up
[1:04:15] and I watched her slowly fade
[1:04:18] and I can assure you you can't hold your
[1:04:20] breath long enough
[1:04:22] to match her breathing
[1:04:28] here's my little girl
[1:04:31] my little niece
[1:04:34] my granddaughter
[1:04:38] she's fading
[1:04:41] it's dying
[1:04:44] gyro said he was going to get the master
[1:04:45] where is the master
[1:04:54] stress building
[1:04:57] chaos starting to ensue in the house
[1:05:01] no doubt there were voices crying out to
[1:05:03] God but my brother and sister they had
[1:05:05] never laid the right foundation to cry
[1:05:08] out to God they never laid the right
[1:05:10] foundation their faith was in their
[1:05:13] Church
[1:05:15] it wasn't in God it was in their Church
[1:05:19] now the prophet encourages us we should
[1:05:22] belong to a church that's what the word
[1:05:24] says but our faith can't be in the
[1:05:26] church amen unless you're talking about
[1:05:28] you brought your faith tonight with you
[1:05:31] and it's in this building here tonight
[1:05:33] but to have it just in the church we
[1:05:36] cannot place our faith in that church
[1:05:39] right
[1:05:41] and so there it is when Jesus speaks
[1:05:43] these words and says you know what uh
[1:05:46] she's not dead but sleepeth
[1:05:49] there's much it's much deeper than what
[1:05:51] we read on the surface here amen we know
[1:05:54] that there would been some in the house
[1:05:56] would not have received this is not
[1:05:58] according to what our church teaches
[1:06:00] what we need to go now is start mixing
[1:06:02] up the herbs and all of the oils and we
[1:06:05] need to get the swaddling cloth and we
[1:06:07] need to wrap her up and we we got to do
[1:06:09] this because she's dead they totally
[1:06:11] missed the supernatural event my brother
[1:06:14] and sister when the prophet of God's
[1:06:16] talking about the second indictment on
[1:06:19] the church my brother and sister he is
[1:06:22] already talking to a people that have a
[1:06:24] mentality that we're embalmed already we
[1:06:28] are this is what we are this is all the
[1:06:31] hope there is just go to church your
[1:06:33] name on the book everything is fine
[1:06:35] that's all God expects there were some
[1:06:37] that were ready to bury that little girl
[1:06:39] because their expectation ended right
[1:06:41] there but I'm telling you my brother and
[1:06:43] sister when you look at this scripture
[1:06:45] right here I hope I can bring it out
[1:06:47] correctly amen because some wouldn't
[1:06:50] have received it anyhow but there was
[1:06:52] some that had a desire amen they had a
[1:06:54] desire to believe but when you've got
[1:06:57] somebody saying don't bother the master
[1:06:59] any longer it was something that
[1:07:01] quenched that little bit of faith that
[1:07:03] they had that maybe we are just
[1:07:05] bothering the master maybe this is just
[1:07:07] all done this is the Lord's will
[1:07:08] whatever it might be amen but they had a
[1:07:11] desire to believe
[1:07:13] but too much negative influence yeah
[1:07:16] too many Messengers had come to them
[1:07:21] now how many times I I didn't even
[1:07:23] bother to try and put the quotes
[1:07:25] together because it's it's just all
[1:07:27] through the message brother Branham
[1:07:28] talking about that uh son or daughter of
[1:07:31] God will say Amen to the word
[1:07:33] now when the word stood there in their
[1:07:35] midst and said don't worry she's only
[1:07:39] sleeping see if they'd had a revelation
[1:07:42] of who was speaking the word they would
[1:07:45] have said amen to it
[1:07:48] but he's already been identified
[1:07:52] and they couldn't accept the
[1:07:53] identification
[1:07:55] look at the world we live in today my
[1:07:57] brother and sister
[1:07:58] if I had come out here in a giant stiff
[1:08:01] robe with gold gilding and a stick and a
[1:08:04] hat on my head and I would have come out
[1:08:06] here and tapped it and done all whatever
[1:08:08] some people would say that is a sign of
[1:08:11] a real minister
[1:08:12] where is that my brother and sister the
[1:08:14] word of God says a real Minister knows
[1:08:17] rightly divide the word of God that's
[1:08:19] God's sign of a real minister is one
[1:08:22] that can get into the word and actually
[1:08:24] see the mind of God and speak it out
[1:08:28] not what kind of deal we're wearing
[1:08:30] whether our cross we have around our
[1:08:32] neck is solid gold
[1:08:37] the unbeliever
[1:08:39] the make-believer my brother and sister
[1:08:42] they will find themselves at times able
[1:08:45] to say Amen to the word
[1:08:47] but many times
[1:08:49] and as the pressure gets greater more
[1:08:51] and more they're actually unable to say
[1:08:55] Amen to the word
[1:08:58] come on
[1:09:02] I have a dozen examples in my head but
[1:09:04] they're pretty blunt and straightforward
[1:09:06] and I'm trying to curb that blunt
[1:09:08] straightforward thing
[1:09:10] amen but they find themselves unable to
[1:09:13] say Amen to the word there are certain
[1:09:14] times and certain words they just simply
[1:09:16] cannot acknowledge
[1:09:18] and in that realm my brother and sister
[1:09:20] you'll find that what's really down in
[1:09:22] the heart
[1:09:29] when the word says
[1:09:32] Christ in you that's it the hope of
[1:09:36] glory
[1:09:38] and someone's response is if God's in me
[1:09:41] where's he at
[1:09:46] you realize
[1:09:48] there's some false teaching
[1:09:50] some poor teaching
[1:09:52] some misdirection
[1:09:54] maybe lack of teaching altogether
[1:09:57] no revelation
[1:10:00] do you believe saints that we is more or
[1:10:03] less focused to adults could take our
[1:10:05] Bible
[1:10:06] and literally sit down and show
[1:10:09] that God intended for us to recognize
[1:10:11] that he's in US
[1:10:15] shouldn't be too hard for us
[1:10:17] amen
[1:10:19] right I don't want to get distracted
[1:10:22] that's not my main thought but see I
[1:10:24] want you to understand that people in
[1:10:26] the house
[1:10:28] weren't able to accept what was taking
[1:10:30] place because they had no Foundation
[1:10:34] to accept it from
[1:10:36] they had no place to go that's why and I
[1:10:39] I certainly not like promote myself
[1:10:41] don't misunderstand me tonight but my
[1:10:43] brother and sister I believe that's why
[1:10:44] we just need some good old-fashioned
[1:10:47] fundamental it don't need to be great
[1:10:49] flowery preaching it needs to hit on
[1:10:51] these points that we recognize who we
[1:10:54] are and what God intended for you and I
[1:10:57] amen what is it the prophet of God chose
[1:11:00] us clearly example after example that
[1:11:03] God intends for you and I in the time of
[1:11:05] trouble to cry out for life
[1:11:08] people are like well I didn't know what
[1:11:10] to pay I've been told this to my faith I
[1:11:12] I didn't pray because I didn't know what
[1:11:14] to pray maybe God was taking them the
[1:11:16] word shows us God wants you you and I to
[1:11:20] cry out for life God will make the final
[1:11:22] decision and we need to accept that
[1:11:24] decision but our first impulse should be
[1:11:27] lay hands on that little girl and we
[1:11:30] start praying for her and God will raise
[1:11:32] her up because God is a supernatural God
[1:11:35] and he is the creator of Heaven and
[1:11:38] Earth and he's the one that spoke it all
[1:11:40] in existence and he can do anything he
[1:11:42] wants and I'm going to claim life
[1:11:45] amen
[1:11:47] amen but instead chaos reigned
[1:11:51] have you ever noticed
[1:11:53] I said I didn't want to be blunt but I'm
[1:11:55] just going to speak this out have you
[1:11:57] ever noticed that religious Spirits get
[1:12:00] angry
[1:12:01] when you don't agree with them
[1:12:06] religious spirits
[1:12:09] a believer
[1:12:11] is tolerant
[1:12:12] you know that in an age where tolerance
[1:12:14] is abused
[1:12:16] and we get spooked about being tolerant
[1:12:19] but did you know a real believer is
[1:12:21] tolerant yes
[1:12:23] if you don't agree amen what does a real
[1:12:27] believer do
[1:12:30] praise for you
[1:12:33] that's what a real believer does
[1:12:36] they don't slam doors they don't call
[1:12:38] names
[1:12:40] they don't say that you're lost
[1:12:43] if they really believe you're wrong
[1:12:45] they'll go home they'll pray for you
[1:12:48] and we believe they're not in the right
[1:12:50] position we pray for them and if you say
[1:12:53] brother Paul where do you get that well
[1:12:55] just go read that simple little silly
[1:12:57] story where the prophet of God talked
[1:12:59] about drawing this circle bigger
[1:13:02] he never once stopped and said you're
[1:13:05] now outside of my circle
[1:13:09] he drew this circle bigger
[1:13:12] because he didn't need you the force of
[1:13:15] personality
[1:13:16] to conquer someone
[1:13:19] he let the Holy Spirit do the Conquering
[1:13:22] amen
[1:13:24] before I get off on the wrong subject
[1:13:26] we'll just move away amen
[1:13:28] so you know uh
[1:13:31] oh I will throw this out I did have a
[1:13:33] little footnote here religious spiritual
[1:13:35] argue my brother and sister when it's
[1:13:37] black and white
[1:13:39] in the word that's right
[1:13:41] that's right they'll argue with you
[1:13:43] of what it means
[1:13:46] [Music]
[1:13:51] and they laughed him to scorn
[1:13:54] have any of you ever been laughed out to
[1:13:56] the level that it would be called left
[1:13:58] to scorn
[1:14:00] where it is so derisive
[1:14:03] so anointed
[1:14:07] that they literally by their laughter by
[1:14:11] their Persona presentation is telling
[1:14:15] you that
[1:14:17] your intelligence your integrity
[1:14:20] everything is just less than dirt
[1:14:24] here's a little girl
[1:14:30] this might shock you
[1:14:36] I would never
[1:14:37] refuse the prayers
[1:14:42] of a man who was sincere
[1:14:45] who did not agree with me
[1:14:51] when you agree with me come back and
[1:14:53] pray for me
[1:14:55] no
[1:14:58] no I didn't really want to identify
[1:15:00] anybody but when you got a friend that
[1:15:03] you got friends that are Baptist and
[1:15:05] they say we pray for you
[1:15:07] I don't say well I don't know if I can
[1:15:10] accept thank you
[1:15:12] thank you for your prayers
[1:15:15] why weren't these people inside the
[1:15:18] house
[1:15:19] saying Jesus is here
[1:15:22] we don't know what he's going to do
[1:15:24] maybe he's just going to pray over her
[1:15:27] get back everyone give him opportunity
[1:15:28] to
[1:15:30] eat but it threw them for a loop because
[1:15:32] their faith was limited catch this o
[1:15:36] message people catch this their faith
[1:15:39] was limited to the ritual they had been
[1:15:43] taught they could approach God from
[1:15:48] let's be real careful we don't put
[1:15:50] ritual
[1:15:51] in front of a relationship
[1:15:54] we have a method we have a program yeah
[1:15:57] yeah my brother and sister
[1:15:59] we need to be careful
[1:16:05] but you know there there's always going
[1:16:07] to be the scoffer isn't that correct
[1:16:10] come on Saints
[1:16:12] this is going to be blunt and forgive me
[1:16:14] if it's too blunt but we've had them
[1:16:15] pass right through this church
[1:16:20] scoffers are going to be present amen
[1:16:23] will the scoffer stop the bride no
[1:16:26] hmm
[1:16:27] well the one that scorns when he stopped
[1:16:29] the bride
[1:16:31] oh so what do you do
[1:16:33] he put them all out
[1:16:35] now this is not in context that you're
[1:16:38] now kicked out of the church and you're
[1:16:39] kicked out of the church and you're
[1:16:40] kicked out of the church not talking
[1:16:41] about that kind of putting them out he
[1:16:44] just simply said I'm not gonna I'm not
[1:16:45] gonna let the atmosphere
[1:16:48] be contaminated by your unbelief but I'm
[1:16:51] going to read a quote to you in a minute
[1:16:53] that might or might not change your
[1:16:55] point of view because you see the reason
[1:16:57] Jesus put them out of there was not so
[1:17:00] that Faith could raise up the little
[1:17:02] girl amen he didn't put them out because
[1:17:06] they were a hindrance to her coming back
[1:17:09] to life he put them out I believe just
[1:17:12] simply because he wanted to change the
[1:17:14] atmosphere and he didn't need those
[1:17:17] openly doubting openly scorning it was
[1:17:20] almost as though they were a nuisance to
[1:17:23] him
[1:17:26] are you following me
[1:17:28] we get the idea that he put them out
[1:17:30] maybe
[1:17:32] because they're unbelief and I got to
[1:17:34] get them out here for something to
[1:17:36] happen
[1:17:39] and I could take you back in the message
[1:17:43] where the prophet of God
[1:17:45] preaching
[1:17:48] Iowa is a perfect example
[1:17:51] Des Moines Iowa
[1:17:54] the prophet of God said
[1:17:56] it was hard for Faith to rise in the
[1:17:59] building
[1:18:00] because there was so much unbelief
[1:18:06] but people walked out of that Coliseum
[1:18:08] that night
[1:18:10] delivered
[1:18:12] and healed
[1:18:15] so as the prophet of God dealing with
[1:18:18] getting the unbelief out of the way so
[1:18:20] that God could work
[1:18:22] no you see the unbelief or the spirit of
[1:18:24] unbelief did not affect God it affects
[1:18:27] you and I
[1:18:30] so Jesus kicks them all out to create an
[1:18:33] atmosphere in the room now look at this
[1:18:35] my brother and sister the only people
[1:18:37] that it is he taketh the father and the
[1:18:39] mother of the damsel and them that were
[1:18:42] with him amen his disciples and inereth
[1:18:45] where the damsel was lying amen so what
[1:18:48] was it my brother and sister he's going
[1:18:50] in there now with Jairus and his wife
[1:18:53] mother of the child and now we already I
[1:18:57] believe addressed the fact that Jairus
[1:18:59] was a believer
[1:19:02] his whole prestige
[1:19:04] remember the prophet of God talks about
[1:19:06] those those uh those priests those uh uh
[1:19:10] that there there they have um their
[1:19:13] their retirement their whole life is
[1:19:15] tied up in the church Jairus would have
[1:19:17] been no different he's there walking out
[1:19:20] there getting Jesus bringing Jesus in
[1:19:22] the public to his house may have well
[1:19:24] just done away with his whole
[1:19:26] church-funded retirement might have done
[1:19:28] away with his whole uh prestige in the
[1:19:31] community just done all this but
[1:19:32] something down in his heart I can see
[1:19:34] Jairus if you just pardon me just a
[1:19:37] moment I can see Jairus and his wife
[1:19:38] sitting there saying our little girls
[1:19:40] getting sicker and sicker we've had the
[1:19:42] best doctors in this city and she's
[1:19:45] getting sicker and sicker and we hear
[1:19:47] look at this over here remember the lady
[1:19:50] that had the little deal down there in
[1:19:51] the market she was healed
[1:19:54] and did you hear the man running down
[1:19:57] the street saying so and so was
[1:19:59] delivered
[1:20:01] there's something going on Jairus you
[1:20:04] know you and I have prayed we've been
[1:20:06] devoted to God you know something's
[1:20:08] happening we believe and their little
[1:20:10] girl gets sick my brother and sister it
[1:20:12] was not a time that they decided to be
[1:20:15] Believers because of desperation they
[1:20:17] were already Believers the seed was down
[1:20:20] in the heart and it was there it may
[1:20:22] have took a time of desperation to
[1:20:24] scrape the dirt off the top and let the
[1:20:27] sun shine on it but they believed
[1:20:30] and it's there that Jesus Takes the
[1:20:32] disciples with him and takes Jairus and
[1:20:35] his wife in there and it's there my
[1:20:37] brother and sister I believe sometimes
[1:20:39] just as the prophet of God talks about
[1:20:41] this that God in this end time here it's
[1:20:44] not going to be a public work it's a
[1:20:47] private work it's a secret War it's a
[1:20:50] opening of the seals my brother and
[1:20:52] sister the personal revelation of Jesus
[1:20:55] Christ to you and I
[1:20:57] it's not on public display
[1:21:00] and Jesus is in there and they have a
[1:21:03] big rumpus and he shouts and kicks some
[1:21:06] chairs around
[1:21:10] he says
[1:21:12] arise amen
[1:21:14] arise
[1:21:17] oh my brothers
[1:21:21] look what the prophet said
[1:21:24] that spirit of fear Saints these are my
[1:21:26] words that spirit of fear hit him
[1:21:29] I believe that I'm on the right track
[1:21:33] because it says he joined himself
[1:21:38] with the unbelievers
[1:21:40] he went from having enough Faith to go
[1:21:43] out of the chair out the door down the
[1:21:45] road get Jesus
[1:21:51] my girl's dead
[1:22:00] but all the time
[1:22:05] I don't know about you tonight Saints
[1:22:07] I've had my ups and downs in life
[1:22:10] I've had my times I've said under the
[1:22:13] stars and said Lord
[1:22:15] what is wrong
[1:22:18] why Lord
[1:22:21] but down inside
[1:22:24] I have all the time of my life wanted to
[1:22:30] believe amen Jesus
[1:22:33] from my very youth there was something
[1:22:37] that always cried out
[1:22:40] Lord I need you
[1:22:43] I've got to serve you
[1:22:46] Hallelujah
[1:22:48] amen so there it is he's moving forward
[1:22:52] the prophet of God says in another
[1:22:54] sermon
[1:22:56] Jairus had true faith
[1:22:59] that's quite a statement
[1:23:01] see in spite of his position he believed
[1:23:05] amen amen the mother believed also
[1:23:08] and they got to see the fruit
[1:23:11] let me make this emphasis right here
[1:23:13] before we move on real quick got to see
[1:23:15] the fruit
[1:23:16] of their believing
[1:23:20] that's what God intends for you and I my
[1:23:22] brother and sister for us to see the
[1:23:24] fruit of believing his word
[1:23:27] we don't have a Barren tree this gospel
[1:23:30] that we call the message is not a Barren
[1:23:32] tree my brother and sister it's
[1:23:34] producing fruit
[1:23:38] Hallelujah
[1:23:40] oh my let me go on here
[1:23:43] in the sermon proving his word
[1:23:47] but in the face of all these I believe
[1:23:50] he's probably going to say unbelievers
[1:23:52] but uh unbelief or doubting ages and
[1:23:55] things that we have went through and
[1:23:57] live in today the worst of all in the
[1:23:59] face of all this doubt God does go right
[1:24:03] on proving his words to be right
[1:24:07] as he does in every age as he has in
[1:24:10] every age he unbelief doesn't stop God
[1:24:13] it doesn't hinder him I don't care how
[1:24:17] much the world unbelieves it's still
[1:24:20] going to happen
[1:24:23] unbelief doesn't do nothing but condemns
[1:24:26] the unbeliever the unbelief will send
[1:24:29] the unbeliever to Hell it'll Rob him of
[1:24:31] Every Blessing God has promised to him
[1:24:33] but it doesn't hinder God from going
[1:24:36] right on with the believer see unbelief
[1:24:40] doesn't stop God it only stops the
[1:24:42] unbeliever
[1:24:44] oh thank God we can stand at the door
[1:24:46] come in come in speak my Lord speak
[1:24:51] we've got the dead talking spiritually
[1:24:54] that need raised back to life Lord just
[1:24:57] speak the word tell them rise amen and
[1:25:01] claim their position my brother and
[1:25:03] sister
[1:25:04] amen Hebrews 11 is not considered the
[1:25:08] faith chapter because it's presumptuous
[1:25:10] my brother and sister it is the faith
[1:25:12] chapter because it is reality in print
[1:25:21] my
[1:25:22] now look at this I gotta close here
[1:25:25] verse 41 he took the damsel by the hand
[1:25:28] and said unto her
[1:25:29] talitha Kumar which is being interpreted
[1:25:33] damsel I say unto thee arise
[1:25:37] you know what that voice was
[1:25:41] the same voice of creation
[1:25:47] that was the voice of creation
[1:25:52] was she dead yes she was dead but when
[1:25:57] he told her to arise that vessel of
[1:26:01] creation had to respond to the voice of
[1:26:05] creation and produce what the voice of
[1:26:08] creation declared and it had to rise up
[1:26:11] there was not a chance that she could
[1:26:14] not rise up when the voice spoke oh I
[1:26:18] say my brother and sister if you'll go
[1:26:20] through your Bible you and I go through
[1:26:22] our Bible we will see all through the
[1:26:25] word come come come
[1:26:28] arise speak go believe all of these
[1:26:33] words that are commands and they come
[1:26:35] from the one who is the voice of
[1:26:38] creation and it's not speaking to you if
[1:26:41] you feel like it if it's convenient if
[1:26:44] that nothing opposes it it's speaking
[1:26:46] directly to you to come and believe and
[1:26:49] live and overcome and possess ever
[1:26:52] everything my brother and sister and is
[1:26:54] coming from the voice of creation
[1:26:58] oh hallelujah look at this he tells her
[1:27:01] arise and I want to ask you this
[1:27:04] question whose vessel is this anyhow is
[1:27:07] it Jairus in his wife's vessel
[1:27:10] no sir is it their daughter's vessel no
[1:27:13] this was God's chosen vessel that he
[1:27:18] chose to manifest and live in oh my
[1:27:22] God what is it in the scripture a vessel
[1:27:25] is a temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:27] amen that little girl my brother and
[1:27:29] sister God was not speaking to flesh I
[1:27:32] hope you follow me here he wasn't
[1:27:34] speaking to flesh for flesh to obey he
[1:27:36] was speaking to the spirit for the
[1:27:38] spirit is what is the life
[1:27:41] he spoke to the spirit in that little
[1:27:43] girl and told the spirit in her arrives
[1:27:46] and you and I my brother and sister the
[1:27:49] word is speaking to the spirit in you
[1:27:51] and I not for us to the be the letter of
[1:27:54] the law for the law amen the book
[1:27:57] killeth but the spirit giveth life and
[1:28:00] he's speaking to the spirit telling you
[1:28:02] and I rise up and possess the land amen
[1:28:06] he's not talking to Old tired flesh he's
[1:28:08] not talking to those that we're weary
[1:28:10] and the things of this law he's speaking
[1:28:13] to the spirit if he was speaking to
[1:28:15] flesh my brother and sister there'd be a
[1:28:17] time our flesh could not respond but I'm
[1:28:19] telling you as long as there's breath in
[1:28:22] these bodies the spirit will respond to
[1:28:25] the voice of creation
[1:28:27] oh Hallelujah I'm sorry I'm getting
[1:28:29] excited tonight
[1:28:30] amen it shouldn't have been a surprise
[1:28:33] God said it
[1:28:35] we should expect it to come to pass
[1:28:37] oh my what was happening you know
[1:28:40] what Spooks us is we're getting a
[1:28:42] glimpse of another dimension
[1:28:46] and I'll just say on my behalf so that
[1:28:49] no one will feel offended
[1:28:52] I have a hard time grasping
[1:28:55] this dimension
[1:28:58] much less stepping
[1:29:00] into another dimension
[1:29:06] but as it was once it was death
[1:29:09] to go behind the veil
[1:29:11] now it's death
[1:29:13] to not go behind the veil
[1:29:16] did he say you'd always feel comfortable
[1:29:20] did he say it would be easy
[1:29:23] no
[1:29:25] he just said
[1:29:26] you'll go
[1:29:29] and I
[1:29:30] will meet you there amen oh isn't that
[1:29:33] beautiful Saints that is so beautiful he
[1:29:36] invited us and then he promised I'll
[1:29:38] meet you right there inside the Veil
[1:29:40] oh my
[1:29:42] amen sister vika will you come
[1:29:46] Hallelujah Isaiah Isaiah 60.
[1:29:53] you know I believe Saints Justice sure
[1:29:56] as Jesus speaking to the damsel
[1:30:00] the little girl
[1:30:02] I believe these words spoken by the
[1:30:04] prophet Isaiah
[1:30:06] contain the same power
[1:30:09] of The Voice
[1:30:11] of creation
[1:30:14] arise
[1:30:20] oh my
[1:30:22] God
[1:30:22] [Music]

[1:30:27] enough time off
[1:30:29] when life's comfortable
[1:30:31] your children are the most obedient in
[1:30:33] church
[1:30:35] when your prayer life is just Supreme
[1:30:38] [Music]
[1:30:40] I don't see any quantifiers
[1:30:43] other than it's telling us to arise and
[1:30:45] shine
[1:30:46] for our light amen our light
[1:30:50] has walked through
[1:30:53] the door
[1:30:55] and come
[1:30:59] we had to go to him
[1:31:01] Jairus had to go to him
[1:31:04] that's how God ordained it
[1:31:08] when all hope was gone for Jairus
[1:31:11] and he didn't have to come
[1:31:16] he'd already been given me out
[1:31:18] let the master go she's dead
[1:31:23] and when he didn't have to come to you
[1:31:25] and I
[1:31:26] because we were dead
[1:31:29] and trespass
[1:31:33] he come in he didn't have to grab us he
[1:31:36] didn't have to shake us
[1:31:38] he didn't have to quote all the
[1:31:40] scripture to us
[1:31:42] something spoke down in the depths of
[1:31:44] our soul

[1:33:02] and we could hear it to the depths of
[1:33:04] our soul
[1:33:07] and respond to it
[1:33:09] not just talk about it but respond to it
[1:33:13] [Music]
[1:33:14] Lord I want to arise
[1:33:17] for the light has come and I can claim
[1:33:21] that as my light

[1:33:53] out of our life
[1:33:55] that we can change the atmosphere
[1:34:00] that the voice of creation can speak to
[1:34:05] sons and daughters
[1:34:07] the voice of creation can change the
[1:34:10] atmosphere
