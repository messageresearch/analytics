[35:36] love you lord we thank you in jesus name
[35:38] we pray
[35:39] amen
[35:41] uh if you have your bibles uh john
[35:43] chapter one
[35:51] i put on one but it's supposed to be
[35:53] john chapter three
[35:55] john chapter three sorry
[36:02] john chapter 3
[36:10] there was a man of the pharisees named
[36:12] nicodemus a ruler of the jews
[36:14] the same came to jesus by night and said
[36:16] unto him rabbi we know that thou art a
[36:18] teacher come from god
[36:20] for no man can do these miracles that
[36:22] thou doest
[36:24] except god be with him so he had a
[36:27] knowledge of christ
[36:29] intellectually
[36:31] they were putting two and two together
[36:32] hey nobody can do these things
[36:35] except they be of god so he comes to
[36:37] jesus jesus answers him and right out of
[36:39] the gate jesus says very verily i say
[36:40] unto thee except a man be born again
[36:43] he cannot see the kingdom of god that
[36:46] statement to nicodemus was similar to
[36:48] the statement jesus made to
[36:51] the disciples when he said unless you
[36:53] drink my blood
[36:54] and eat my flesh you have no part with
[36:56] me it was the word
[36:59] speaking now it was the miracles and the
[37:01] healings and all these things that they
[37:02] saw but then nicodemus comes to him and
[37:05] jesus speaks the word which is what
[37:07] divides
[37:08] between
[37:09] the
[37:10] uh make believer and the true believer
[37:13] it's the separation right see the
[37:15] healings and those things
[37:17] are our promises but in the ministry of
[37:18] jesus they were the attraction but then
[37:20] when the word came so the word so jesus
[37:22] right out of the gate
[37:24] brings the word
[37:26] which was
[37:27] well i'll get ahead of myself so
[37:28] nicodemus says unto him how can a man be
[37:31] born when he is old can he enter the
[37:33] second time into his
[37:34] mother's womb and be born jesus answered
[37:37] verily verily i say unto thee accept a
[37:38] man be born of water and of the spirit
[37:41] he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
[37:43] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[37:45] and that which is born of the spirit is
[37:46] spirit marvel not that i said unto thee
[37:49] you must be born again
[37:51] the wind bloweth where it listeth and
[37:53] thou hearest the sound thereof but can't
[37:55] not tell what whence it cometh and
[37:57] whether it goeth so is everyone that is
[37:59] born of the spirit
[38:01] nicodemus answered and said to him how
[38:03] can these things be it's a hard saying
[38:06] which is uh similar to what those
[38:08] disciples 70 that walk no more with him
[38:11] they said how how can we accept this he
[38:13] just answered and said unto him art thou
[38:15] a master of israel and know us not these
[38:17] things
[38:18] in other words it's in the word why have
[38:20] you not seen it
[38:22] verily rarely i say unto thee we speak
[38:24] that we do that we do know and testify
[38:27] that we have seen and ye receive not our
[38:30] witness
[38:31] if i have told you
[38:33] earthly things and you believe not how
[38:35] shall you believe if i tell you of
[38:37] heavenly things and no man hath ascended
[38:40] up to heaven but he that came down from
[38:42] heaven even the son of man which is in
[38:45] heaven and as moses lifted up the
[38:47] serpent in the wilderness even so must
[38:48] the son of man be lifted up that
[38:50] whosoever believeth in him should not
[38:52] perish but have eternal life
[38:55] he's preaching
[38:57] to nicodemus redemption story
[39:00] how can you be born again unless the son
[39:03] of man be raised up like moses did with
[39:06] the serpent he says verse 16 for god so
[39:08] loved the world that he gave now he's
[39:10] still speaking to nicodemus for god so
[39:12] loved the world that he gave his only
[39:13] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[39:16] him
[39:17] should not perish but have everlasting
[39:19] life for god said not his son into the
[39:22] world to condemn the world but that the
[39:24] world through him might be saved he that
[39:26] believeth on him is not condemned but he
[39:29] that believeth not is condemned already
[39:31] because he hath not believed in the name
[39:33] of the only begotten son of god and this
[39:35] is the condemnation that light has come
[39:37] into the world and men loved darkness
[39:40] rather than light because their deeds
[39:42] were evil
[39:43] for everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[39:46] light
[39:46] neither cometh to the light lest his
[39:48] deeds should be reproved
[39:52] oh that church makes me feel
[39:54] judged verse 21 is where we draw our
[39:57] text tonight but he that doeth truth
[40:00] cometh to the light that his deeds might
[40:03] be may be made manifest that they are
[40:06] wrought in god
[40:08] and then the story moves on
[40:12] what happened to nicodemus
[40:14] we don't know
[40:16] we don't hear of him again that i'm
[40:17] aware of
[40:20] i i see it in my head as he just puts
[40:22] his head down and walks away couldn't
[40:25] accept it
[40:29] too hard of a saying
[40:31] or
[40:31] later on down the road he be converted
[40:35] verse uh galatians doing for in due
[40:38] season we shall reap if we faint not
[40:43] it is not a sin to become weary
[40:46] in well-doing
[40:47] it is what happens because we still have
[40:50] inhabit a fleshly tabernacle
[40:52] this body is is of death and it will
[40:55] return to that but as the spirit within
[40:58] us that will go on for eternity can in
[41:00] connection with arthinophthiophany
[41:04] sometimes we get we get tired
[41:07] sometimes we get wore down sometimes it
[41:10] gets hard to continue on in well doing
[41:14] that's why the scripture is there
[41:17] because
[41:18] god knew it would happen
[41:20] it had happened
[41:21] no doubt paul experienced that weary and
[41:25] well doing
[41:26] first corinthians 15 58 paul again
[41:28] therefore my beloved brethren be is
[41:30] steadfast
[41:33] unmovable
[41:35] always
[41:36] always abounding in the work of the lord
[41:39] for as much as you know that your labor
[41:41] is not in vain the well-doing you're
[41:45] doing is not in vain
[41:50] continue to stand
[41:52] fast stand
[41:54] strong like the tree planted by the
[41:56] water is not movable
[42:01] stand fast in what truth
[42:05] continue to be
[42:07] a doer of truth
[42:10] now tonight i i started we would start
[42:13] when i started studying this out i
[42:15] thought i had it down and then you know
[42:17] at five o'clock today was like nope
[42:20] and changed it all around on me and then
[42:22] i was in the office back here and it
[42:24] just
[42:25] three three sermons just came together
[42:29] and that is that that we must be doers
[42:31] of truth
[42:33] and i had some notes put down some time
[42:36] ago
[42:37] from james james is a book of action
[42:41] james says
[42:42] i will show you my faith by my works
[42:46] in other words he's a man of action
[42:48] that's what that's what his anointing
[42:50] was
[42:53] everybody has the
[42:55] there's a group of gifts that everyone
[42:57] has but everyone has then their
[42:58] personality their their uh who they are
[43:01] who christ made them to be and their
[43:03] their um
[43:05] flavor of the truth not it's not
[43:07] different it's just the way they bring
[43:09] it out and james is the kind of man was
[43:11] a man of action you know i doubt he had
[43:13] was the kind of person growing up you
[43:14] know james sit down just sit still sit
[43:17] down
[43:18] you know he he wanted to be up and he
[43:19] wanted to be doing
[43:21] and so in in the book of james is a call
[43:23] to action
[43:24] james
[43:25] saying as a christian you must not be in
[43:28] action in action one word not doing
[43:31] anything
[43:32] you must be in action you must be a doer
[43:35] a worker of the faith in other words a
[43:38] doer of truth
[43:40] and jesus when he's speaking to
[43:41] nicodemus nicodemus he ends his sermon
[43:44] with he that doeth truth
[43:48] cometh to the light
[43:50] amen
[43:51] cometh to the light you say i need the
[43:54] light start doing the truth
[43:57] well what is truth what do you find in
[43:59] truth you find liberty victory
[44:01] deliverance
[44:03] freedom
[44:04] of the uh victory over depression
[44:07] victory over anxiety all these things
[44:09] you find free where the spirit of the
[44:11] lord is
[44:13] amen
[44:16] so
[44:17] truth
[44:19] is the embodiment of our relationship
[44:22] with christ
[44:24] you cannot trust the truth unless you
[44:28] have a relationship with the truth you
[44:30] can't be a man or a woman that is a doer
[44:34] of truth unless you know truth
[44:38] unless you know truth
[44:41] um perfect strength by a perfect
[44:43] weakness i told you
[44:45] some of us build
[44:47] it upon intellectual conception oh that
[44:50] this know-it-all this man's a trained
[44:52] scholar we should train our people and
[44:54] school them
[44:56] the next one bases it upon some
[44:58] sensation sensation of movement i like
[45:00] how he takes this both sides right
[45:02] because you have people that say oh you
[45:04] know
[45:05] you know
[45:07] i don't
[45:08] this i hope it doesn't sound derogatory
[45:10] but you know praise god i'm not so smart
[45:12] but you know we don't want to be smart
[45:14] it's pretty much how they say it
[45:17] pretty much they say if you if you're
[45:18] smart intellectual world well you're out
[45:20] of luck that's how i've heard it
[45:22] interpret it
[45:23] right but that's not what the scripture
[45:25] said but but what i'm saying here
[45:27] there's two sides of it there's the
[45:28] intellectual side and then there's the
[45:29] other side he
[45:30] says uh a sensation a movement shaking
[45:34] crying shouting dancing in the spirit or
[45:36] something some emotional outward work
[45:38] see you can find the set you say
[45:42] there's two you know
[45:43] well there's two sides of the roads and
[45:45] there's always people on both sides of
[45:46] the roads and people in the middle
[45:48] um and and you know people on the side
[45:50] you know you never know in church if
[45:53] they're getting it or not they're very
[45:55] stoic
[45:57] but guess what within that stoke people
[46:00] is people that are just wow inside
[46:02] they're just wow
[46:03] right and so
[46:05] if you're not careful you say well i
[46:06] don't see an outward ex there should be
[46:09] outward expression emotion
[46:11] but
[46:12] i'm talking across the board
[46:14] an average and then you see people
[46:16] they're shouting oh wow they must get it
[46:18] because they're shouting no you have the
[46:19] same amount of people if you will within
[46:21] the shouting
[46:23] that are within the intellectual that
[46:24] just aren't getting it
[46:27] it's the other it's the two extremes but
[46:29] we want to find balance in the center of
[46:31] the road
[46:33] if you know me you know i love to
[46:34] express
[46:36] so
[46:37] how loud
[46:39] but some have anyways the next one bases
[46:41] it upon okay simpson station if the
[46:43] devil can't get you on this side he'll
[46:45] push you off that side but the thing
[46:47] with this is having nothing that you can
[46:49] depend on in your own self or anything
[46:52] that you can do just a complete total
[46:55] surrender of your weaknesses
[46:58] unto god and say here i am have nothing
[47:01] no ability that
[47:02] you can trust it
[47:05] for a long time on my sermons the way
[47:07] they the way they sit in in my ipad i
[47:09] have a cover so i know
[47:12] i had i have a cover now it says the
[47:14] title so it's easier to find but before
[47:15] i had the cover that said god doesn't
[47:17] call the qualified he qualifies the call
[47:22] see god doesn't want your qualifications
[47:25] in in the sense of of of the flesh
[47:29] you better be qualified by the scripture
[47:34] right but god's looking for
[47:36] he says i think it's in this sermon
[47:38] where he says you know they um well let
[47:40] me just finish reading the quote because
[47:41] it's probably in here search back
[47:43] through the scripture and find out yeah
[47:44] as i got the scriptures written out here
[47:46] i'm referring to some some back through
[47:48] the scriptures we find out that god
[47:50] always used the nobodies to become his
[47:52] somebody he always taken those that the
[47:55] world had rejected the modern age had
[47:58] rejected and that's the kind that he
[47:59] picked up to use
[48:01] consider the apostles think about peter
[48:02] the fisherman not enough education to
[48:04] write his own name john the ignorant and
[48:06] unlearned those men
[48:08] he bypassed the nobles and the educated
[48:10] priests and the celebrities of them days
[48:13] the scholars the church members
[48:15] and got them people who thought
[48:18] uh
[48:19] then people who thought they were
[48:20] somebody and picked up those who were
[48:21] nobody and used them
[48:24] now somebody can become one of his
[48:26] people
[48:30] god can use them if they are ready to
[48:32] forget that they are somebody see
[48:34] nobody's left out
[48:35] see the bible says it is
[48:37] hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom
[48:40] of god not impossible
[48:44] god can use it if they're ready to
[48:45] forget they are a somebody if you are
[48:47] ready to forget that you're at somebody
[48:49] and become a nobody
[48:51] then god can use you and make a somebody
[48:54] out of you it's a bit of a tongue
[48:55] twister see but you've got to forget
[48:57] that you're so important
[49:02] you've got to forget that you're so
[49:04] important listen you'll stumble over
[49:06] your feet trying to be a doer of the
[49:08] truth if you think you're somebody
[49:09] that's right
[49:11] but as in your perfect weakness
[49:13] that
[49:14] is your finest hour
[49:18] so nicodemus had a an intellectual
[49:21] knowledge and some of the youth will
[49:22] probably pick up on this because we
[49:23] talked about this
[49:24] youth meeting you have nicknames had an
[49:27] intellectual knowledge of christ see
[49:28] whether what the man says come to the
[49:30] saving knowledge of christ but he also
[49:33] talks about knowledge as being an
[49:35] intellectual
[49:36] but the scripture says come to the
[49:38] knowledge of truth
[49:41] so knowledge can be
[49:43] knowledge of the heart is a revelation
[49:45] of christ knowledge of the head is an
[49:47] intellectual understanding so nicodemus
[49:49] him and the pharisees they they put two
[49:51] and two together this man is is doing
[49:53] things of the scripture so he has to be
[49:55] from god
[49:56] but they couldn't say that in public
[49:58] because that would just dismantle their
[49:59] whole religion and their position so
[50:01] they come to him by night hey
[50:03] you appear to be
[50:05] right of god because of these things you
[50:07] do so they had an intellectual
[50:08] understanding and you've met those
[50:10] people that can just say it just right
[50:14] but you see no expression from their
[50:16] heart
[50:18] something in their heart isn't round up
[50:20] they have an intellectual knowledge but
[50:22] you need a
[50:24] heartfelt knowledge of christ
[50:27] so
[50:29] jesus
[50:30] christ recognizes this in nicodemus
[50:35] now he begins to call nicodemus in a
[50:38] spiritual realm to be a doer of truth he
[50:40] finishes the sermon off but he that
[50:42] doeth truth cometh to light nicodemus
[50:45] you're looking for the light
[50:47] here's the truth
[50:49] become a doer of truth and you will come
[50:51] to the light
[50:53] and so nicodemus is received so what i'm
[50:55] trying to say is he recognized that
[50:57] nicodemus had an intellectual
[50:58] understanding but he needed to transfer
[51:00] that knowledge down to his heart that
[51:03] song goes from my head down to my heart
[51:05] the word of god so he begins to speak
[51:07] the word and it's the word of god
[51:10] that separates it's the word of god that
[51:13] brings that
[51:15] that which you know down into your heart
[51:18] some not everyone
[51:20] that comes to to know the lord didn't
[51:23] know nothing
[51:24] previously a lot of people had you know
[51:26] kind of an understanding of the bible
[51:28] and all this stuff or they grew up in a
[51:30] church or a catholic church so they had
[51:31] an intellectual understanding
[51:33] but it was when the truth right because
[51:36] it takes the right vehicle to bring the
[51:40] word of god in as truth
[51:43] god has anointed
[51:45] some of the anointed you as a bride of
[51:47] christ to be an expression be truth
[51:50] presented so when you go and you witness
[51:52] to somebody you're saying the same
[51:54] scriptures that the denominations might
[51:56] use but you are a vehicle of truth and
[52:00] you're presenting that truth and that
[52:02] will shed the light
[52:04] onto that person's life that was that
[52:06] woman was free
[52:08] the word so the word came to nicodemus
[52:11] to bring him into the knowledge of the
[52:13] truth but he couldn't accept it
[52:16] the deep there was no deep to respond
[52:20] so truth presented brother madam says in
[52:22] the quote
[52:23] the seal of christ
[52:25] now over in the book of ephesians we
[52:27] read now what the seal of god is we see
[52:30] what the seal of the devil is
[52:34] in hebrews 10 first we go to the seal of
[52:36] god for if we
[52:38] disbelieve
[52:39] willfully after we have received the
[52:41] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[52:44] no more sacrifice for sin
[52:47] the knowledge of truth see
[52:48] if the truth this is underlined okay
[52:51] good if the truth has been presented
[52:55] jesus christ came to earth to present
[52:57] truth
[52:58] and not only present truth he was the
[53:01] truth
[53:03] you are the truth
[53:08] i mean everyone we should be saying amen
[53:10] to that one
[53:13] if you but see you can only be the truth
[53:16] i love how
[53:17] i this is me this is my personal opinion
[53:21] i guess
[53:22] put that little footnote in there
[53:25] growing up in the message
[53:27] i always looked as soon as the preacher
[53:29] started talking about the seals i looked
[53:31] at that as the deep part
[53:33] of the of the thing
[53:34] but then once god gave me a revelation
[53:37] of the word
[53:38] yeah i was in
[53:39] i grew up in the message it wasn't until
[53:40] i was about 18 years 19 years old i
[53:43] caught a revelation no other than that
[53:45] you're married called a revelation of
[53:47] the word
[53:48] i had a revelation to follow christ but
[53:50] the full open word i didn't catch
[53:52] revelation until i was much older and it
[53:54] was when i called revelation i realized
[53:57] you begin to talk about the seals and
[53:58] some people look oh they kind of get
[54:00] glassy eyed and it gets it gets into the
[54:02] deep part if you will but you see right
[54:04] here i just preached the seals
[54:07] he was the truth
[54:09] you are the truth there you go opening
[54:12] of the word right there
[54:14] because you can't know christ
[54:17] unless those seven seals are opened
[54:19] that's right
[54:20] you cannot be a doer of truth without
[54:22] the open word
[54:24] because you need all the truth today
[54:27] where we live today you need all the
[54:29] truth christ smiled upon it in the ages
[54:32] past but today
[54:34] all truth is required
[54:38] travel id passport vaccine
[54:43] natural type is spiritual
[54:45] okay anyways i don't know where that
[54:46] would go but um
[54:48] it's all required today
[54:51] you have to be
[54:54] so if you want to be a doer of truth you
[54:55] have to know christ who is truth
[54:58] and he says he goes on to say and the
[54:59] religious people of that day said now we
[55:01] know that he is
[55:03] and has mental telepathy
[55:05] you know they always have a they always
[55:07] got to figure it out
[55:09] right
[55:11] i've i've you've heard people explain
[55:13] something sometimes you're like you have
[55:14] no idea what you're saying
[55:17] and just in general life you know people
[55:20] try to explain and they use words that
[55:22] don't have the right meanings and you're
[55:23] like okay you're just trying too hard
[55:26] these uh pharisees were just
[55:28] oh mental telepathy right did they even
[55:33] because we realize that he's reading
[55:35] their minds out there but we believe
[55:37] that all of his healings and things and
[55:39] then now go ahead brother cephas
[55:42] caiaphas
[55:43] did that oh they would say that was god
[55:45] because he's part of their denomination
[55:50] but as soon as jesus does it
[55:53] no not i don't know if caiaphas did it
[55:55] but just
[55:56] dear let it theoretically jesus does it
[55:58] he's not paul we can't that's my
[56:00] telepathy that's beelzebub that's
[56:03] of the devil
[56:05] and this is right here he says um but we
[56:07] believe that all of his healings and
[56:08] things that he does is only by the devil
[56:10] because he don't agree with our
[56:11] denomination so they said he's a devil
[56:15] now he says denomination
[56:18] but
[56:19] today we need to move that
[56:22] into the message because that's where we
[56:24] are today
[56:26] the ministry when weatherman was alive
[56:28] the ministry was come out of the
[56:29] denominations and come into the truth so
[56:31] there was
[56:32] that
[56:33] what he was dealing with we're dealing
[56:35] with now today in the message
[56:38] because it's a separation time
[56:41] so
[56:42] they say oh that's of the devil or they
[56:44] say
[56:45] that church isn't on the on the word per
[56:48] se or they're we don't because they
[56:50] don't agree with us
[56:52] they didn't do what we thought they
[56:54] should do or or what what have you it's
[56:57] the same spirit what is that spirit that
[56:59] spirit of of division
[57:01] you see but then there's a pro that's so
[57:04] then
[57:05] then you have a perverted spirit of
[57:08] unity
[57:12] and so they say oh well
[57:15] they want to they want division over
[57:17] here but then
[57:18] they want unity but only
[57:20] if you you know cut this off and don't
[57:23] talk about this and
[57:25] these things over here
[57:27] but you see what's lacking is
[57:31] the saving knowledge of christ
[57:36] they're not doers of truth
[57:40] they're not doers of truth
[57:42] the statue of a perfect man brother
[57:44] branham says and then thirdly you add
[57:46] knowledge knowledge now that don't mean
[57:49] worldly knowledge because that's
[57:50] foolishness to god but knowledge to
[57:52] judge judge what right from wrong
[57:55] and then the filter the thinking man's
[57:57] filter is the holy spirit truth is the
[57:58] holy spirit knowledge of christ would be
[58:00] the holy spirit a revelation of christ
[58:03] you can't have that unless you're born
[58:05] again
[58:06] nicodemus you need to be a doer of truth
[58:08] but first you must be born again amen
[58:12] and guess what nicodemus it's because
[58:14] god so loved the world
[58:18] god so he nicodemus knew exactly what
[58:21] jesus was talking about when he said as
[58:23] moses lifted up the serpent in the
[58:24] wilderness nicodemus was a scholar of
[58:27] the of this of the of the old testament
[58:28] or the the torah or whatever they called
[58:30] it at that time
[58:32] the scrolls there he was a student so he
[58:35] understood exactly what jesus was saying
[58:37] and no doubt when the prophet because we
[58:40] don't as far as i know there's nothing
[58:41] more about nicodemus so when they go
[58:43] through and they i'm going to take
[58:45] liberty they begin to put jesus on trial
[58:48] no doubt nicodemus begin to think about
[58:49] this night
[58:51] and how jesus said the son of man must
[58:53] be lifted up upon the
[58:55] just like the serpent on the on the on
[58:57] the the pole the moses lifted up the
[58:59] serpent
[59:01] realizing what was happening but at that
[59:03] point in time you know powerless to do
[59:05] anything well he would have been in
[59:06] anyways
[59:08] so you want to be nicodemus you want to
[59:10] be a doer of truth
[59:12] we must be born again and that knowledge
[59:15] that you have intellectually must
[59:17] transfer down to your heart
[59:22] praise the lord
[59:23] so that's nicodemus
[59:26] but what about you and i
[59:28] god has called us to be doers of truth
[59:31] now what does that mean does that mean
[59:32] doers of truth when the skies are
[59:34] beautiful and sunny and
[59:36] everyone around you is a christian as
[59:38] well
[59:40] or when everything's going well
[59:44] you understand sometimes you know things
[59:47] as a preacher but you just have to trust
[59:49] i got to preach what god laid on my
[59:50] heart
[59:54] we go through things that are difficult
[59:58] but god is calling us in those moments
[1:00:01] of time in those that section of our
[1:00:03] life to still stand up and be a doer of
[1:00:06] truth
[1:00:10] when when you're on the the the right on
[1:00:14] the edge not the edges and you're going
[1:00:16] to quit serving god but you're on the
[1:00:17] edge
[1:00:18] everything's just
[1:00:20] strung out
[1:00:22] you're stressed you're weary and well
[1:00:24] doing
[1:00:24] see
[1:00:26] not on the edge of the world but you're
[1:00:27] weary in what you're doing
[1:00:31] you must be
[1:00:32] a doer of truth
[1:00:35] you must take courage you must have god
[1:00:37] i need you to strengthen my faith
[1:00:41] you have faith as we said at the
[1:00:42] beginning you have faith but you say god
[1:00:44] i need you to strengthen my faith
[1:00:46] because i'm going to have to walk this
[1:00:48] way
[1:00:49] you see
[1:00:50] he was singing that song waymaker
[1:00:53] so in in the way that we sing that song
[1:00:55] and i know i said this but already but
[1:00:57] in the way that we sing that song it's
[1:00:58] it's that god's making a way
[1:01:00] but the other way is the way you walk as
[1:01:03] a christian god made that way already
[1:01:05] before the foundation of the world
[1:01:08] and he has called you to walk that way
[1:01:12] and no matter how hard that way gets
[1:01:19] it'll be your finest hour
[1:01:22] when it's darkest when things are the
[1:01:24] most difficult that is your finest hour
[1:01:28] there's a man in the bible by the name
[1:01:29] of shamgar
[1:01:31] is there anything else written of him
[1:01:35] besides the ox goat
[1:01:37] and slaying of the philistines no that's
[1:01:38] it
[1:01:39] that's all here but the man probably
[1:01:41] lived 40 70 however many years
[1:01:44] a lifetime of service
[1:01:46] because he i think he was a judge
[1:01:48] when i read the church that's how i
[1:01:50] understand it a lifetime of service but
[1:01:53] all you read about is shamgar now that
[1:01:55] moment in time in shamgar's life was his
[1:01:58] darkest hour
[1:02:00] it was the worst time for him
[1:02:03] well if adam puts it this way he looked
[1:02:06] over and there's his wife her clothes
[1:02:08] all ragged
[1:02:10] sunken eyes sucking cheeks
[1:02:12] kids
[1:02:13] too skinny
[1:02:15] sick pale needing nourishment and says
[1:02:19] he looked at his family and said they
[1:02:21] will not survive the winter
[1:02:24] things were as bad as they could get for
[1:02:26] shamgar
[1:02:28] but if we read the scriptures today
[1:02:31] we say that was his finest hour
[1:02:34] and that's dark time when he stepped
[1:02:37] forth as a doer of truth because he said
[1:02:40] i am but the man says he got angry
[1:02:45] he got angry the bible says be angry and
[1:02:48] sin nots
[1:02:51] righteous
[1:02:52] indignation we call it we like to put a
[1:02:54] fancy name to it but he was he was angry
[1:02:57] angry that these uncircumcised
[1:02:59] philistines were coming around his house
[1:03:01] stealing what rightfully belonged to him
[1:03:04] apply that to whatever situation there
[1:03:06] is in your life
[1:03:07] stand up and be a doer of truth how is
[1:03:10] he a doer of truth you say that
[1:03:12] scripture hadn't yet been written with
[1:03:14] jesus because he took within his hands
[1:03:17] the anointed word of god
[1:03:20] amen
[1:03:22] doing exactly what god wanted him to do
[1:03:25] god said told israelites stand and fight
[1:03:27] did that end no no
[1:03:31] as long as you're in the promised land
[1:03:32] you got to fight
[1:03:34] you have to keep fighting because guess
[1:03:36] what they drove them out
[1:03:37] now they're out kind to come back in
[1:03:40] you drive the devil out you say oh
[1:03:42] that's done that's taken care of nope
[1:03:44] here he comes
[1:03:45] trying to get back in
[1:03:47] you have to be a doer of truth you have
[1:03:49] to walk in the truth but it was shangri
[1:03:51] in that very dark time
[1:03:54] that was his finest hour
[1:03:57] but it took courage it took faith in
[1:03:59] god's word for him to be a doer of truth
[1:04:03] and you can only have faith
[1:04:06] and
[1:04:06] be and step into action if you know the
[1:04:10] truth
[1:04:11] and he knew the truth
[1:04:14] i am a circumcised
[1:04:16] israelite
[1:04:17] son of abraham isaac and jacob
[1:04:21] i come
[1:04:22] from god
[1:04:24] was what they were saying because god
[1:04:26] called abraham and so on
[1:04:28] so he had a saving knowledge of christ
[1:04:30] so he says let every man's word be a lie
[1:04:34] but mind be true see
[1:04:36] now you're getting
[1:04:39] knowledge that's
[1:04:40] i love this word supreme knowledge
[1:04:45] you don't have to have four degrees in
[1:04:47] some college or something like that to
[1:04:49] have it because all these virtues are
[1:04:51] given to you by god to place upon the
[1:04:53] foundation of your faith see notice
[1:04:55] notice the statue of perfect man starts
[1:04:57] with faith
[1:04:59] in order for you to build up into christ
[1:05:01] you have to have faith
[1:05:03] why because you have to know christ
[1:05:06] no man will build up into the statue of
[1:05:08] a perfect man unless he has met christ
[1:05:11] not an emotion
[1:05:13] although that will sometimes be part of
[1:05:15] it
[1:05:15] but he has met christ the word
[1:05:18] true and open to him you don't have the
[1:05:21] four okay that you might come to the
[1:05:23] full stature of a real real living man
[1:05:26] of god
[1:05:28] a real living man god
[1:05:31] add knowledge because knowledge of his
[1:05:33] word you must believe it in this way so
[1:05:35] he says believe it like this
[1:05:39] that the days of miracles is not past
[1:05:42] knowledge that what god said god is able
[1:05:45] to perform
[1:05:47] knowledge that what god said god is able
[1:05:50] to perform
[1:05:52] all things are possible with god nothing
[1:05:55] is impossible
[1:05:58] can you
[1:05:59] can you go ahead you can speak up in the
[1:06:01] congregation can you tell me what that
[1:06:04] excludes
[1:06:07] pick something pick anything
[1:06:09] if i asked you before saying that for
[1:06:11] you to pick the worst situation ever you
[1:06:13] would have something to pick up
[1:06:14] something to blurt out
[1:06:17] but you see nothing can argue with
[1:06:20] all things are possible
[1:06:24] lord strengthen our faith
[1:06:27] we are called to action not in action
[1:06:32] hebrews 11
[1:06:34] 32 you can turn there if you want i'm
[1:06:35] going to
[1:06:41] go back and read the whole chapter
[1:06:42] tonight if you want
[1:06:44] recommend it what shall i more say for
[1:06:46] the time would fail me to tell of gideon
[1:06:48] and of barack and of samson and the
[1:06:51] jephthah of david also and samuel and of
[1:06:54] the prophets who through faith subdued
[1:06:55] kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained
[1:06:58] promises stopped the mouths obtained
[1:07:00] promises is listed right up there with
[1:07:03] stop the mouths of lions
[1:07:05] it is no small thing for you to claim a
[1:07:07] promise in faith that god has given you
[1:07:10] amen
[1:07:13] quench the violence of fire escape the
[1:07:15] edge of the sword out of weakness were
[1:07:16] made strong waxed valiant in fight
[1:07:19] turned to flight the armies of the
[1:07:21] aliens women received their dead rays to
[1:07:23] life again and others were tortured not
[1:07:25] accepting deliverance that they might
[1:07:27] obtain a better resurrection others had
[1:07:30] trial of cruel mockings and scourgings
[1:07:32] yay moreover of bonds and in prison as
[1:07:34] they were stoned they were sown asunder
[1:07:36] were tempted were slain with the sword
[1:07:37] they wandered about in sheepskin and
[1:07:39] goatskins being destitute afflicted
[1:07:41] tormented next time you feel like you're
[1:07:43] having a bad day read the scripture of
[1:07:45] whom the world was not worthy
[1:07:48] they wandered in deserts and in
[1:07:49] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[1:07:51] earth and these all having obtained a
[1:07:53] good report through what
[1:07:55] faith
[1:07:56] received not the promise
[1:07:59] but god asked you to stand up against
[1:08:01] the intellectual demons of the world
[1:08:03] today against the spirits in the
[1:08:06] darkness in the principalities and the
[1:08:08] powers of the air to stand up against
[1:08:11] the ease of life
[1:08:13] and be a doer of truth a doer of truth
[1:08:17] is
[1:08:17] in the spiritual
[1:08:20] with muscle on it
[1:08:22] faith
[1:08:23] that what god has called you to do he is
[1:08:26] able to perform that
[1:08:28] through you
[1:08:30] because he you are
[1:08:32] you are
[1:08:33] god in flesh
[1:08:36] having received
[1:08:38] faith received not the promise god
[1:08:40] having provided some better thing for us
[1:08:43] that they without us should not be made
[1:08:46] perfect
[1:08:48] we
[1:08:49] they're they're the cloud of witnesses
[1:08:51] in the next chapter is calling out
[1:08:53] needing you to stand up and be a doer of
[1:08:56] truth
[1:08:57] if you're in a dark time in your life
[1:08:59] right now this is your finest hour
[1:09:04] oh how dare you say that how dare you
[1:09:06] take presumption
[1:09:08] it's not me
[1:09:10] that's right it's what god has
[1:09:12] told me to say
[1:09:15] you say wow you're just taking all the
[1:09:16] liberties tonight brother chris well hey
[1:09:18] it's time we did
[1:09:21] and it's the spring of 1940
[1:09:24] may 1940 this the springtime
[1:09:27] poland and norway denmark belgium the
[1:09:29] netherlands and france had fallen under
[1:09:31] nazi rule
[1:09:32] says world war one uh two
[1:09:35] the united states doesn't have the
[1:09:37] military power to enter the war great
[1:09:40] britain is left standing alone on the
[1:09:42] edge
[1:09:43] of the abyss of a new dark age
[1:09:46] it is in this crisis that the newly
[1:09:48] elected prime minister winston churchill
[1:09:50] finds himself in may of 1940.
[1:09:54] knowing this is a dire situation he
[1:09:56] stepped onto the floor of the house of
[1:09:58] commons on june 18
[1:10:00] 1940. he spoke for 36 minutes reassuring
[1:10:04] the people of britain of their military
[1:10:06] strength and their duty to stand up
[1:10:09] to fight on
[1:10:10] if necessary for years
[1:10:12] if necessary alone
[1:10:15] god calls us to fight alone sometimes
[1:10:18] forsaking father and mother and sister
[1:10:21] and brother
[1:10:24] alone
[1:10:25] in the flesh but not in the spirit
[1:10:29] to stand up to fight on if necessary for
[1:10:31] years if necessary alone he finished his
[1:10:34] speech with these words
[1:10:36] the battle of france is over i expect
[1:10:38] that the battle of britain is about to
[1:10:40] begin upon this battle depends of the
[1:10:42] survival of christian civilization these
[1:10:45] are his words upon it depends our own
[1:10:47] british life and the long
[1:10:50] continued continuity by our institutions
[1:10:54] and our empire the whole fury and might
[1:10:56] of the enemy must very soon be turned on
[1:10:59] us
[1:11:00] i hope your spiritual thinking caps are
[1:11:02] wrong hitler knows that he will have to
[1:11:04] break us in this island or lose the war
[1:11:07] if we can stand up to him all europe may
[1:11:09] be free and the life of the world may
[1:11:12] move forward into broad sunlit uplands
[1:11:15] but if we failed in the whole world
[1:11:17] including the united states including
[1:11:19] all that we have known and cared for
[1:11:21] will sink into the abyss of a new dark
[1:11:23] age made more sinister and perhaps more
[1:11:26] protracted by the lights of perverted
[1:11:28] science
[1:11:30] let us therefore brace ourselves to our
[1:11:32] duties
[1:11:34] and so bear ourselves
[1:11:36] ourselves that if the british empire and
[1:11:39] its commonwealth lasts for a thousand
[1:11:41] years men will still say this was their
[1:11:44] finest hour
[1:11:47] you talk about a dark time
[1:11:50] they were completely alone
[1:11:55] when france fell to nazi germany
[1:12:00] that was it it was them it was britain
[1:12:04] but it's but i believe winston churchill
[1:12:06] was anointed of god
[1:12:09] for that time in history
[1:12:12] as well as
[1:12:14] these words
[1:12:16] saints of god
[1:12:19] the whole fury and might of the enemy is
[1:12:23] turned upon you
[1:12:24] two hundred thousand thousand demons
[1:12:26] released at the rivers of river
[1:12:28] euphrates
[1:12:29] they say oh well
[1:12:31] how can we even have hope that's the
[1:12:33] brilliance of god
[1:12:35] he says i want to show i want to end the
[1:12:38] world in the crescendo so i want to show
[1:12:41] just what my bride is capable of doing
[1:12:46] because of his strength now you will
[1:12:49] never be a doer of truth and you will
[1:12:52] never stand strong like the british did
[1:12:55] because guess what we we say it did
[1:12:58] they had the victory and we say that was
[1:13:00] their finest hour
[1:13:02] you will never stand firm in your time
[1:13:06] of darkness in your position unless
[1:13:11] you can stand upon the truth
[1:13:14] of christ you say
[1:13:16] you already have the faith within you
[1:13:19] but you need god to come because it is
[1:13:21] your weakness
[1:13:23] you have no strength stop thinking you
[1:13:26] have strength
[1:13:27] start thinking you have faith
[1:13:30] because you do
[1:13:31] before the foundation of the world you
[1:13:33] are given the faith to overcome
[1:13:35] everything you will come into contact
[1:13:37] with
[1:13:39] god is here to strengthen that faith and
[1:13:42] to tell you be not weary in well-doing
[1:13:46] but stand fast unmovable
[1:13:50] knowing that what as god has called you
[1:13:52] to do in doing so it is not done in vain
[1:13:57] but god is looking down upon that
[1:14:00] and he's smiling in your darkness and
[1:14:02] that dark time they're going to and he's
[1:14:04] saying this is their finest hour
[1:14:08] as the world comes to a close the bride
[1:14:10] as we as the bride of christ as we begin
[1:14:12] to
[1:14:12] to put up with this darkness and it just
[1:14:14] gets darker and darker and darker
[1:14:17] as the bride as a whole this is her
[1:14:19] finest hour
[1:14:21] what will be written down of your life
[1:14:24] when you face the darkness
[1:14:26] what will be written down when you were
[1:14:28] faced with a trial or you were faced
[1:14:30] with a hardship or you were faced with
[1:14:31] something you could not overcome
[1:14:34] well i'll tell you because that's
[1:14:36] already be written down
[1:14:37] and they overcame him
[1:14:39] overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[1:14:42] and the word of their testimony
[1:14:44] because god has called you to be a doer
[1:14:47] of truth
[1:14:48] and it is by
[1:14:49] that your action based on god's word
[1:14:52] that you will find
[1:14:55] in your finest hour you know shortly
[1:14:57] after that uh germany began to bomb
[1:15:00] london england
[1:15:02] london and other key cities later in the
[1:15:04] fall they called it the blitz
[1:15:06] it actually had the opposite effect
[1:15:11] it
[1:15:12] angered the citizens
[1:15:14] it gave them greater resolve those that
[1:15:18] survived the bombings
[1:15:20] till people will just go about their day
[1:15:22] getting their bread and this that either
[1:15:23] while the alarms are going off and bombs
[1:15:25] are dropping
[1:15:27] they just
[1:15:28] want about their day they took up
[1:15:30] whatever they had and armed themselves
[1:15:32] in preparation for an invasion
[1:15:35] germany did them a favor by bombing them
[1:15:41] historians will tell you the same thing
[1:15:44] it would have been better
[1:15:46] because their people were in fear
[1:15:48] they were in fear they were afraid of
[1:15:51] what they would be afraid of
[1:15:56] you see the devil sometimes he comes
[1:15:57] whispering around you trying to get you
[1:16:00] to fear
[1:16:02] what's already been defeated
[1:16:06] what you already have the victory over
[1:16:09] but you see
[1:16:10] he just comes and whispers because he
[1:16:12] knows unlike the germans
[1:16:14] that if it actually happens you will
[1:16:16] find faith
[1:16:17] and you will stand strong so he begins
[1:16:19] to whisper what about this what if this
[1:16:21] happens what if that's the biggest thing
[1:16:23] when it comes to fear and anxiety what
[1:16:26] the what ifs
[1:16:27] look face it when it comes
[1:16:30] don't worry about tomorrow
[1:16:32] for the eve the the
[1:16:34] the evils of the present day are enough
[1:16:38] if germany had not bombed instead of
[1:16:40] and they would have just continued to
[1:16:42] threaten them
[1:16:44] they would have had greater luck
[1:16:46] greater
[1:16:47] advantage
[1:16:48] but when they started to bomb the people
[1:16:50] go oh
[1:16:52] i'm still alive the ones that survived
[1:16:55] right
[1:16:56] i'm still alive
[1:16:57] what do you got germany
[1:17:01] and it strengthened their resolve
[1:17:03] aroused within them
[1:17:05] a result so you say
[1:17:07] people say well why would god allow this
[1:17:09] to happen
[1:17:11] he's bombing off he's bombing the areas
[1:17:14] of your life
[1:17:16] that you don't need
[1:17:19] to give you a greater resolve
[1:17:21] to stand strong because when you go
[1:17:23] through the fire let me tell you let me
[1:17:25] ask you this
[1:17:26] if the children the shadrach meshach and
[1:17:28] abednego had to face the fire again
[1:17:31] what level of faith would they have in
[1:17:33] comparison to the first time
[1:17:37] they said hang on we'll walk in for you
[1:17:40] praise god you wanted to have church
[1:17:41] today anyways
[1:17:45] you walk through something
[1:17:49] god gives you a greater faith coming out
[1:17:52] the other side
[1:17:54] and he's coming back for a bride
[1:17:57] who overcomes how do you overcome so the
[1:17:58] bible says by the blood of the lamb and
[1:18:00] the word of your testimony but what is
[1:18:01] that all based upon your faith
[1:18:04] i keep saying it and it keeps coming to
[1:18:06] me

[1:18:10] claim the faith you have
[1:18:12] and say god strengthen it
[1:18:14] don't sit there saying oh i wish i had
[1:18:16] faith or i just don't have faith and
[1:18:18] lord give me faith no claim the faith
[1:18:21] that you have that she has been imparted
[1:18:23] unto you and say god i need you to
[1:18:25] strengthen my faith to stand the test
[1:18:29] strengthen my faith so that in time to
[1:18:32] come
[1:18:33] they or this or whatever they is would
[1:18:36] say
[1:18:37] that was their finest hour
[1:18:39] when we get to the other side and we
[1:18:40] meet the the the great men of god in
[1:18:43] history
[1:18:44] and scripture they're going to say wow
[1:18:46] you're the bride of laodicea
[1:18:50] and you go through days and you're and
[1:18:52] it's just it's hard and the race of life
[1:18:55] and the the modern technology and
[1:18:57] everything that just causes so much
[1:18:59] grief
[1:19:00] you think how you know we don't we don't
[1:19:02] face
[1:19:03] lions we don't face
[1:19:04] all this stuff
[1:19:06] but yet they're going to say how did you
[1:19:08] make it
[1:19:12] and that this is
[1:19:13] like i said your finest hour
[1:19:18] i'm going to read that scripture again
[1:19:20] real quick john
[1:19:37] but he that doeth truth
[1:19:40] cometh to the light
[1:19:41] that his deeds it may be made manifest
[1:19:45] that they are wrought in
[1:19:47] god
[1:19:49] see any time god calls you to action in
[1:19:51] the scriptures he reminds you
[1:19:54] it's not you
[1:19:56] it's him
[1:20:00] we talk about the priest how they how
[1:20:01] they put their foot into the river
[1:20:03] jordan
[1:20:04] and then it parted but what were they
[1:20:06] carrying
[1:20:07] the word of god yeah
[1:20:10] it wasn't their feet
[1:20:12] it was the word of god acting through
[1:20:15] them
[1:20:16] but they had they had they had to have
[1:20:18] faith
[1:20:21] john okay i just read that
[1:20:23] james 1 22-25 i just have it here so
[1:20:27] but be doers of the word and not hearers
[1:20:29] only deceiving your own selves
[1:20:33] for if any be a hearer of the word and
[1:20:35] not a doer he is like unto a man
[1:20:37] beholding his natural face in a glass
[1:20:39] for he beholdeth himself and goes his
[1:20:41] way and straightway forgetteth what
[1:20:43] manner of man he was but who so looketh
[1:20:47] into the perfect law of liberty what do
[1:20:50] you think that is
[1:20:51] truth
[1:20:53] and continue with therein he being not a
[1:20:56] forgetful hearer
[1:20:58] but a doer of the work this man shall be
[1:21:01] blessed in his deed
[1:21:03] john 14 12 very very i say unto you he
[1:21:05] that believeth on me the works that i do
[1:21:08] shall he do also
[1:21:11] and greater works than thee shall he do
[1:21:13] because i go unto
[1:21:15] my father
[1:21:17] you want to see light shed on the
[1:21:19] situation that you're facing start
[1:21:21] walking
[1:21:26] how's that song go start while i'm
[1:21:28] talking walking up the kings
[1:21:32] highway
[1:21:34] it is your feet forward
[1:21:38] footsteps is possession
[1:21:40] doer of the word
[1:21:42] having faith that if you put your foot
[1:21:45] forward spiritually speaking god will
[1:21:48] act upon his word because it was
[1:21:50] abraham's
[1:21:52] faith that god recognized
[1:21:55] that god gave him circumcision which was
[1:21:57] a sign of his faith which we know is it
[1:21:59] is a a type of the holy spirit
[1:22:02] so you want the holy spirit you don't
[1:22:04] have the holy spirit yet
[1:22:06] step forward in faith
[1:22:08] and god will recognize that faith that
[1:22:10] he he has by that's the thing he put the
[1:22:13] faith abraham had in abraham
[1:22:15] amen
[1:22:17] they say it's god god the whole way
[1:22:19] through
[1:22:20] in and out
[1:22:22] praise god musicians would come tonight
[1:22:26] we are called to be doers of truth
[1:22:31] and we can only do that if we're
[1:22:33] standing upon the truth
[1:22:37] through our faith
[1:22:38] in what god has called us to do
[1:22:42] just write that in your notes or on your
[1:22:44] door on your fridge do
[1:22:47] do what
[1:22:49] whatever god asks you to do
[1:22:53] pray that god
[1:22:55] you know because this is something i
[1:22:56] experienced in my own life so i can kind
[1:22:58] of it's kind of where i always come back
[1:23:00] to is that
[1:23:03] don't get it so figured out
[1:23:06] the path in front of you
[1:23:08] that you miss
[1:23:10] what god's trying to say
[1:23:12] you know that's that's the world oh you
[1:23:14] need to have figured out when you're in
[1:23:15] high school you need to have figured out
[1:23:17] what you're going to do for the rest of
[1:23:17] your life so you can take these classes
[1:23:20] in high school you can transfer into
[1:23:21] college
[1:23:22] ask me about college sometime you can
[1:23:24] transfer into college and you can go to
[1:23:25] college for this amount of time then you
[1:23:27] can do this and
[1:23:28] but that's not always how god works
[1:23:30] he doesn't want you to
[1:23:33] necessarily i mean you should i gotta be
[1:23:35] careful i say this because i don't want
[1:23:37] you should have some idea where you're
[1:23:39] going you can't just sit down and do
[1:23:41] nothing
[1:23:42] but don't have your life in front of you
[1:23:44] so figured out and fit in this little
[1:23:46] box
[1:23:47] that when god comes over here
[1:23:49] you're going where's god
[1:23:52] i don't see god he's over here you know
[1:23:54] shining bright flashing light to you
[1:23:56] where's god i don't see god in my life
[1:23:58] you know what where's the healing
[1:24:02] where's deliverance
[1:24:07] has your church put you in a box
[1:24:11] i pray this church isn't doing that yes
[1:24:14] has a ministry you've been feeding on
[1:24:16] put you in a box
[1:24:18] this is it this is god
[1:24:20] we haven't figured out
[1:24:22] but yet they preach oh don't put a
[1:24:23] period at the end of god don't put the
[1:24:24] period there don't put a period let god
[1:24:26] do you know be open to moving of god but
[1:24:29] but only in these contexts
[1:24:32] only in this context you need to pay
[1:24:34] attention to but this over here all that
[1:24:37] you know that's just that guy's idea
[1:24:38] that's this you know those churches are
[1:24:40] it's us here
[1:24:45] be careful that you and your spiritual
[1:24:46] walk with god that you don't say well
[1:24:48] you know
[1:24:48] i've been in the message 40 years
[1:24:51] i know the quotes i've read the seals
[1:24:52] i've read the church age book twice each
[1:24:55] each one read the bible through a bunch
[1:24:57] of times
[1:24:59] this is god
[1:25:01] so the spirit of the lord moves upon
[1:25:04] the the service and people begin to just
[1:25:07] worship and weep
[1:25:09] he's sitting there going oh they must
[1:25:11] have some sin
[1:25:13] within them because i have arrived
[1:25:16] it's funny saying to god but it's not
[1:25:18] because it's true
[1:25:20] people get that way
[1:25:24] always be open to god's word
[1:25:27] always say lord
[1:25:30] always say lord i wanna i wanna be
[1:25:33] whatever it is your will is
[1:25:35] 360 degrees
[1:25:38] it's eternity right god's will god has
[1:25:40] eternity god's will is one big thing all
[1:25:43] around it could be any direction lord
[1:25:44] help me to be focused on your will what
[1:25:47] you have but you see don't get all
[1:25:49] stressed and worked up about it because
[1:25:50] as soon as you do then the flesh takes
[1:25:52] over and
[1:25:53] you start reading the supernatural into
[1:25:55] everything and it just becomes
[1:25:56] superstition
[1:25:58] [Music]
[1:26:00] did you know that can happen you can get
[1:26:02] so supernatural it becomes superstition
[1:26:05] be careful balance it's all in balance
[1:26:08] praise god says god
[1:26:10] [Music]
[1:26:12] remember these things
[1:26:14] god has called you to action to be doers
[1:26:16] of truth
[1:26:18] when you find yourself in a dark dark
[1:26:20] time remember that it's your finest hour
[1:26:24] because it is you in complete weakness
[1:26:29] it is you in complete weakness
[1:26:32] and you can say god i am weary and well
[1:26:35] doing
[1:26:36] come let's bow our hands tonight lord
[1:26:39] there be some here tonight i believe i
[1:26:44] father the bible said that paul says
[1:26:46] when i was a child i spake as a child
[1:26:47] but then i became a man
[1:26:50] i speak i put away the childish things
[1:26:53] but i know tonight these are the words
[1:26:56] you wanted
[1:26:58] to say
[1:27:01] somebody is weary and well doing lord
[1:27:03] and we're asking you to come down and
[1:27:06] strengthen their faith
[1:27:08] whether they're here online watch it
[1:27:10] later whatever it's your in your hands
[1:27:12] but god somebody's weary
[1:27:16] lord i ask that you would come with your
[1:27:18] strength the faith that they always
[1:27:21] already have that they've had this whole
[1:27:23] time identify it within them lord and
[1:27:26] strengthen that faith so they could
[1:27:28] stand like shadrach
[1:27:30] and say i'll walk in the fire
[1:27:33] so they could stand like daniel and say
[1:27:35] all gold in the pit
[1:27:36] they could stand like shamgar and say
[1:27:39] i'll take the ox gold
[1:27:42] father you have called us to be doers of
[1:27:44] truth is that easy no it's not but
[1:27:48] that's the whole point lord for you have
[1:27:50] called us in our weakness
[1:27:52] god that your strength could be
[1:27:55] perfected lord jesus
[1:27:57] oh
[1:27:58] god i'm not caught up in emotions just
[1:28:01] to be in emotions i feel a moving lord
[1:28:05] you are calling us to stand in our
[1:28:07] weakness
[1:28:09] so that your strength could be perfected
[1:28:11] lord jesus
[1:28:13] i left my hands tonight
[1:28:15] those that would join me
[1:28:17] god we ask lord jesus strengthen our
[1:28:19] faith lord
[1:28:21] give us a greater resolve lord jesus to
[1:28:24] stand like shamgar and stand by gideon

[1:28:35] put his hand to the plow
[1:28:37] he put his hand to the pillars of doubt
[1:28:39] around him and he said god all i know
[1:28:43] is you are god so i'm gonna do what you
[1:28:46] call me to do and that's push
[1:28:49] god sometimes we don't understand what's
[1:28:51] going on around us but you have called
[1:28:53] us to push forward to press on toward
[1:28:56] the mark of the high calling in christ
[1:28:58] jesus you have called us to press on
[1:29:02] not to sit down and just wait
[1:29:06] but to be in action
[1:29:09] and it is in that action in your will
[1:29:11] that we find the strength of the lord
[1:29:15] not a carnal understanding of waiting
[1:29:18] but the true understanding of waiting on
[1:29:20] the lord
[1:29:22] oh god
