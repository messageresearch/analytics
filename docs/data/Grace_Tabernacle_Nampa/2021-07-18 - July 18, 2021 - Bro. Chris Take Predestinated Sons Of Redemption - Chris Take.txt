good to feel his presence glad to see our pastor his wife made it home hope your trip was okay praise the lord matthew chapter 1 the first gospel we're gonna read verse three and judas begot ferez and zara of kmar and the pharaohs begot ezram and ezram begat aram and darumba got a minidab and a minute we got nisan and nisan we got salman and salman we got boaz of reikob or rahab and boaz begot obed of ruth and obed we got jesse and jesse begat david the king and david the king begat solomon of her that had been the wife of uriahs verse 12 and after they were brought to babylon jehonias amen isaiah 43 verse 1. so but now let's say the lord that yeah i think it's i think it monitors a little loud up here on the platform but now thus saith the lord that created thee o jacob and he that formed thee o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by name thou art mine amen let me turn the monitor down a little bit i'm getting feedback it's now okay amen let's read that again sorry for the interruption but now thus saith the lord that created thee o jacob and he that formed thee o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by name thou art mine amen that scripture is for you as much as it is real let's bow our heads gracious heavenly father lord as we come before you this morning lord be we are unworthy lord but father who is but you lord jesus the father we ask that you would speak to our hearts this morning lord that you would take your word lord jesus the living breathing word of god though it is pinned upon pages and bound in leather father it is still alive lord jesus because it's not the form it takes on the page but it's the life it brings within our hearts lord jesus and father we're so grateful lord for it we're so grateful to know you lord grateful is such a little word lord compared to what you've done for us father lord just speak to us this morning may your presence be felt by each heart hear lord jesus may your word just touch us we ask you in jesus christ's name we pray amen praise the lord may lord bless you to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning yeah so we we uh heard wednesday night uh there in the service and our pastor touched upon boaz and ruth and i begin to think about boaz and how he was the son of rehab i think that he even mentioned whether paul even even might have mentioned that and begin to think about that and i thought you know there's others similar with a similar story and so my title this morning um is predestinated sons of redemption and my subtitle is called by name boaz was a son of redemption amen so before we get into it we're just going to read a couple of quotes here from brother branham and the message the breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals it's the same message for these few quotes here so now it's wrote mysterious because no man nowhere knows it god alone jesus christ see now but it is a book a mysterious book it's the book of redemption we'll get into that in a little while and now we know that this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood it's probe that through six church ages but at the end when the seventh angel begins to sound his mystery he winds up all of the loose ends that these fellows probed at and the mystery com mysteries comes down from god as the word of god and reveals the entire revelation of god amen then the godhead and everything else is settled all the mysteries serpent seed and whatever more is to be revealed so they couldn't figure it out in the first six church ages they couldn't because it wasn't opened yet john saw but the angel said seal it up he goes on to say he says now you see i'm just not making that up that's right maybe somebody in the congregation thought that when he said that it's thus saith the lord i'll read it to you out of the book the sounding of the seventh angel's message the mystery of god should be finished that's been declared by his holy prophets that's the prophets who has wrote the word at the sounding of the seventh church age the last church age all the loose sins that through these church ages has been probed at will be wound up together and when the seals are broke and the mystery is revealed down comes the angel the messenger of christ setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with the rainbow over his head now remember this now this is where many people fall off right now remember the seventh angel is on earth at the time of this coming praise god how could you marry him unless he came just as john was giving his message the same time that the that messiah came in the days john knew he would see him because he was going to introduce him amen catch that this morning again in the same message now we see that this seventh seal book now is the mystery of redemption it's a book of redemption from god again later on but with the divine promise that this book of redemption will be perfectly opened by the lamb and the seals thereof will be loosed by the lamb in the last days in which we're living now it's not made known until the lamb takes the book and breaks the seals because remember the book was being holded in the hands of him that sat upon the throne and the lamb comes to him that sits upon the throne and takes the book out of his right hand takes the book oh that's deep we'll try to solve it out if we can by the help of the holy spirit now we're depending on him and we will see later it is at the end time when time has run out but the mystery later on but the mystery of the whole book is in them seals from genesis to revelation the complete plan of redemption is revealed in these seven seals oh it's an important time if you study it out even more the book the book of redemption was sealed with seven seals so um redemption the cross is just a portion of their story of redemption the secular or sorry not the secular world the denominational world puts they tell the story of the cross and that's where they stop when it comes to redemption that's when you say redemption story to someone that's what they think of the life of christ when he was here on earth and his death and resurrection not discrediting that at all that is a portion of the story the bride needed redemption so christ could marry her the cross just opened the door the cross opened the door without redemption we can have no part with him but he really wanted us to have fellowship with him so he redeemed us i was sitting in my office yesterday studying and you know sometimes i i will uh strip away everything and just think about something and with no preconceived or no previous understanding and i and i was sitting there and i was contemplating and and meditating about why redemption is so important and why why is it the is it is it a mystery why is it a book of redemption that needed to be revealed and what was what was this was i missing something and the lord just began to deal with my heart and i realized that the book of redemption amen lord help me this morning christ cannot defy his laws we'll read the quote same message paragraph 166 but john wept here is what i think he went for because if no one was worthy and could open this book of redemption the whole creation was lost here is the book here is the title deed and it will be offered to the kinsmen redeemer that can meet the qualifications so before before if you will now all things are preordained and set in order before time began but if you will um before christ was ten to take the book a law was set a kinsman redeemer was the only one who could do it now christ in his in in his infinite wisdom knew he was that sacrifice but the law was set in place had to be a kinsmen redeemer and so the story of redemption is christ it's about you but it's about christ and this is what just broke me down is i realized it was about him he wanted you so bad his law said his law said no fellowship at all his law it was broken in the fall of the guard needed it was broken there was no fellowship but he needed you he wanted to be with you so much that he said in play in in in plan the plan of redemption and the only way you can come into fellowship with christ is through redemption the only way you can be redeemed is if you catch a revelation of christ to you amen that is why that is why it is the book of redemption that was sealed so you can't even be a part of christ unless you have revelation of redemption amen because that's christ he goes on to say here is the book here is a title deed and it will be offered to the kinsmen redeemer that can meet the qualifications i underline this here that's god's own law and he can't defile his law get defile defy his law rather so he meant to say defy his law god required a kinsman redeemer who was worthy who was able to do it who had the substance to do it god's law required a kinsmen redeemer to take the book taking the book saying to god is what redeemed you revealing that book is what gave you a revelation of redemption to redeem you so unless the seven seal book of redemption was open all creation would be lost christ had to take the book amen he had to take it he had to reveal himself to you and i am and for us to be in fellowship with him because the purpose of redemption was so that he could marry you amen amen if you want to turn with me to genesis chapter 38 so we read in the beginning isaiah and we read the matthew chapter 1 about the lineages of christ and we mentioned a few people there we didn't read the entire thing but we mentioned a few important people that we're going to my god's grace look at today genesis chapter 38 remember our title is the sun's predestinated sons of redemption or just the sons of prevention uh redemption excuse me tripping over my tongue genesis chapter 38 verse 6 if you verses here to read but bear with me and judah took a wife from her his firstborn whose name was tamar so same person we read in the genealogy his firstborn son he gives the wife his wife this girl tamar and ur judah's firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lord and the lord slew him and judah said unto onan the next down the line go in unto thy brother's wife and marry her and raise up seed to thy brother and onan knew that the seed should not be his and it came to pass that he went in unto his brother's wife and then that he spilled it on the ground lest that he should give seed to his brother and the thing which he did displease the lord wherefore he slew him also amen there was somebody else who couldn't take on the redeeming of our inheritance lest that mourn his he wasn't willing to take to make the sacrifice and the thing which he did displease the lord wherefore he slew him also then said judah to tamar his daughter-in-law remain a widow at thy father's house tell sheila be my son be groaned for he said lest per adventure he died also as his brethren did so out of fear judah withholds tamar's inheritance and tamar went and dwelt in her father's house and in the process of time the daughter of yeshua judah's wife died and judah was comforted and went up unto his sheep shearers to timnath he had his friend hira the adulamay and it was told tamar saying behold thy father-in-law goeth up to tim that to shear his sheep and she put her widow's garments off from her and covered her with a veil and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is by the way of timnath for she shot she saw that sheila was grown and she was not given unto him to wife when judah saw her he thought her to be a harlot because she had covered her face and he turned unto her by the way and said go to i pray thee let me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law and she said what will thou give me that thou mayest come in unto me and he said i will send thee a kid from the flock and she said look thou give me a pledge till thou s thou send it so he gives her his signet his bracelets and his staff his identification and uh she takes those things and she goes away and she goes puts her garments of widowhood back on and goes home and then three months later uh so then and then then uh judah sent the sheep back she wasn't there couldn't find her verse 24. and it came to pass about three months after that it was told judah saying tamar thy daughter-in-law had played the harlot and also behold she is with child by whoredom and judah said bring her forth and let her be burnt when she was brought forth she sent to her father-in-law saying by the man who's these are i am with child and she said dessert and i pray thee whose are these the signet and bracelets and staff and judah acknowledged them and said she had been more righteous than i because of that i gave her not to sheila my son and he knew her again no more in other words he withheld her inheritance but she by took an act of faith took a risk to preserve that inheritance and it came to pass in the time of her trail that behold twins were in her womb and it came to pass when she derailed that the one put out his hand and the midwest took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread saying this came out first and it came to pass as he drew back his hand that behold his brother came out and she said thou how hast thou broken forth this breach be upon thee therefore his name was called pharas which is breach afterward came out his brother that he had the scarlet thread upon his hand his name was zara so contrary to the way things should be the lineage continued with pharez not zara zara was considered the firstborn but just as joseph he crossed his ear jacob israel crossed his hands and blessed amen the younger of the twins manasseh or ephraim i can't remember which one and so the same thing happens here and and uh we could take it fairest was a type of christ who did took the breach amen he breached the gap for us amen but tamar she she took a risk to preserve her inheritance because judah was bound by the law to give her his next son but he didn't he held it back and the line had to continue through judah what she did whether or not we leave that god to judge how she did it but god needed that line to continue through judah and so she was sentenced to be burnt but because of the seed she carried because of what she identified as amen she was redeemed and she was allowed to bring forth her children and through that god continued the lineage of christ so so pharas excuse me carried on the line a son of redemption an act of faith on tamar's part to preserve redemption amen and so now we see that that sort of of of these and you can look and you can see how close and maybe if these people these men in the lineage knew their great great grandfather or so on and so forth but this is the story carried down through these generations the sons of redemption and so we come to a place in scripture where the israelites have have made an exodus from egypt they've been in the desert and then they wandered the desert for 40 years they uh refused to act upon faith and uh claimed their inheritance now there was a man named caleb and caleb amen is people grow up and and and the way they are who they are says a lot about how they were raised and the family they came from and here we have caleb standing firmly upon his promise and his desire to go over and take the land and um he had a brother named um well his name flips my mind now but praise the lord but he had a brother and through his brother we have the general solomon came from so um praise the lord so here we have the israelites at the river jordan now again there now they've come under the ministry of joshua and they have the opportunity to go over and take their promise amen take what their inheritance amen to redeem their inheritance and so in in joshua chapter two uh we'll we'll go over there real quickly here um praise the lord joshua chapter two and so joshua the first thing he does is he sends out these two spies he says hey we're going to cross over jordan i want you to go give me a description now perhaps within these uh within these spies was the remembrance that joshua takes the inheritance very seriously so they didn't want to come back with oh the walls are too big amen and joshua the son of none sent out of shedding two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even jericho and they went and came into a harlot's house named rahab and lodged there and it was told the king of jericho saying behold there came men in hither tonight of the children of israel to search out the country so and the woman took the two men and hid them and said thus there came men unto me but i wish not once they were and they came to pass about the time of the shedding of the gate when it was dark that the men went out whether the men went i won't not pursue after them quickly for ye shall overtake them so she hid them in her house and then she begins to testify that she says in verse 9 i know that the lord hath given you the land amen faith already speaking in faith living in sin a harlot but she receives these messengers and she begins to speak in faith look i know that you that the lord has given you the land i know the inheritance belongs to you now she steps out in faith a gentile and says i want to lay claim to the same inheritance given to you what was anointing her to speak those words the very fact that god had set in motion before time began rahab you belong in my lineage rahab i need you to carry the seed to bring forth the promised son does it matter that you're a gentile doesn't matter that you're a heathen that's your harlot it doesn't matter what your family or your parents i'm giving you the opportunity to lay claim to an inheritance that shouldn't be yours but before the foundation of the world god said rahab this is yours so faith moves within her heart a deep calling to the deep she had something within her to respond to that inheritance so she speaks out in faith and she begins to testify doesn't our lord love to hear us testify about his goodness even before it's come to pass and she says your terror has fallen upon us all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for we have heard how the lord dried up the red sea how the the you salute the two kings of the amorites how god give you strength here and god gave you strength there god made a way here and um we're we're done you have the land already amen amen now therefore i pray you swear unto me by the lord since i have shown you kindness that ye will also show kindness under my father's house and give me a true token that you will save alive my father my mother my brethren and her family so they say put the scarlet thread rope whatever out the window and by that testimony of the token what was it was the was the rope special no no did the rope if you got that rope would you be saved no the rope oh praise god testified of the faith that rahab had in her inheritance and had the faith and that red type redemption amen redemption for for rahab so she was laying claim to her redemption before it even happened he said you put this out your window you make this testament you make this testimony that god is going to redeem you you believe it yes sir that's it and god will spare you and same thing happened amen it was by the testimony of abraham's faith that was imputed to him for righteousness amen so amen she hit the hebrew spies she turns from prostitution and she marries a general in the army of israel amen that is a redemption story matthew 1 5 and salmon begot boaz of rahab rahab wasn't righteous but she accepted god's righteousness well the banham says in why little bethlehem 1958 and i might add here did you know she rahab typed the gentile church she was a gentile she was a type of the gentile church when they heard the message we were all out in spiritual prostitution committing spiritual fornications against the god of heaven and all kinds of stuff all kinds of denominations and religions but when we heard that there was a god that still lived that could perform miracles quickly receive the message quickly amen she didn't even give them a chance to speak she testified that she said no no hold on listen i want the token i'm going to read this next quote so i don't get ahead of myself ray have the harlot that we're all familiar with she uh this is uh god's rap gift 1960 ray have the harlot that we're all families with she being a young girl that was turned on the street by a heathen father and mother that put her on the street because she was beautiful and she was to bring an income to them on prostitution and yet down in this immoral girl that was turned on the street she had heard that there was a god who answered prayer and the first opportunity that she got to accept that god or do something for him she did it and god spared her life and saved her father and mother and her family she the bible says that they they went and came into harlot's house but doesn't tell you how they got there you know what i believe she went looking for them she went looking for her opportunity and then she heard about this and then she heard a rumor of she was a street girl word travels on the streets quickly the king found out after she found out she heard she said hey guys come i'll save you i'll protect you and then she was she was laying hold upon her inheritance and an active face he was stepping out in faith saying look i'll hide you guys risking her own life taking a risk and then by stepping out of faith that god recognized that faith in her heart she fell in love with the general in the army of israel he goes on to say we find in history and married this general and their courtship was wonderful and finally they settled down and lived at bethlehem oh i'm sure them women were gossiping oh my a general solomon did you see who he's courting people can talk but yeah let them talk you're always going to talk man it's not the critic that counts but it is the man in the arena and through this general she brought to the world a son i can't think of the general's name just now but i have it salman i was trying to thought i had his name down here but i don't i have her son's name but it was rahab's son to this general his name was salman not the solomon that's built the temple the son of david but another solomon and this salmon brought forth a son whose name was boaz and boaz oh we are all well acquainted with that wonderful story of boaz and ruth so salman's uh south salmon's great grandfather was caleb's brother um and salman means garment and we heard wednesday night that he uncovered us to reveal our sin and then he covered us amen salmon a garment covered rahab amen marriage redemption and marriage amen an act of faith on rahab's part to preserve redemption this is the household that brought forth boaz a son of redemption amen james 2 25-26 you want to see the grace of god read it right here set into the hall of fame of hebrews or excuse me said into the hall of fame in the new testament likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had set them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also she's also mentioned in hebrews chapter 11 by faith rahab see it was her faith that testified you think she just accidentally ended up in hebrews chapter 11. no god's showing you the power of his redemption taken from a harlot on the street amen to a by faith in the new testament oh you think you think about your past and the devil likes to bring it up and remind you amen but god has another story that he's written amen god i saw today a quote that a bad chapter is a bad chapter in your life is not the whole book and ain't that the truth for the believers we have chapters in our past amen that testify of a different person amen but you have been justified you have been sanctified you have been redeemed by the power of the holy ghost that is not who you are that is a different book that is a book of of lies that is not you at all because justified means you never did it in the first place amen praise god so we step from this into the boaz and boaz and ruth and we could go read it um and uh praise the lord we will rule chapter four i wasn't going to but ruth chapter four verse one actually now let's back up verse chapter three so naomi tells ruth listen uh he's winnowing barley tonight in the threshing floor go down there for six and she went down onto the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her and when boaz had eaten and drunk now who brought the gentiles message the jews that's right and the gentiles did all that they made her to do praise the lord and it came to pass verse 8 at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she answered i am ruth i am handmade spread therefore thy skirt over that hand me handmade for thou art a near kinsman stepping out in faith stepping out in faith that boaz could redeem her stepping on her faith because she recognized him as her kinsman from the message she received so she stepped out in faith they have heard good things about you i've heard you are the kinsmen redeemer will you redeem me 11 verse 11 and now verse 10 and he said blessed be thou of the lord my daughter for thou hast showed more kindness in the latter and then at the beginning and as much as thou followers not young men whether poor or rich and now my daughter fear not i will do thee due to the all that thou require us for all the city of my of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman and now it is true that i am thy near kinsman how be it there is a kinsman nearer than i tarry this night and it shall be in the morning chapter 4 and then when boaz up to the gate and sat him down there and behold the kinsmen of whom boaz spake came by unto him he said ho such a one turn aside sit down here and he turned aside and sat down and he took ten men of the elders of the city and said sit you down here and they sat down they said under the kids men naomi that has come again out of the country of moab selleth a parcel of land which was our brother emelex and i thought to advertise thee saying buy it before the inhabitants and before the elders of my people if thou wilt redeem it redeem it see you couldn't nobody could just buy it had to be a kinsman that was the law so he's like man yeah i'll take more land and then boaz says oh but you've got to take ruth and the kids miss out in verse six i cannot redeem it for myself lest i mar mine own inheritance redeem thou my right to thyself for i cannot redeem it for this was the manner in former time in israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing for to confirm all things a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor and this was a testimony in israel therefore the kinsmen said unto boaz buy it for thee so he drew off his shoe so boaz redeems naomi's inheritance taking ruth to wife i wish we knew more of of the the jews as as a whole you know preachers can study that to realize just how significant that exchange was this man wanted this inheritance but see the very thing ruth was the reason this first person could not make that redemption but that's what ruth needed ruth needed boaz to redeem her amen we were we would mar the inheritance of our nearest kinsmen but god put that little caveat in there because he wanted us see it's about god's desire for fellowship with you you sons of redemption you predestinated sons and daughters of redemption god had a desire so he called you thy name i have redeemed thee oh israel and i have called you by name and then he knew your name he knew the name to speak to catch your attention and then he knew what to do to catch your attention because he had a desire in his heart he loved you he loves you amen i drew on my board i have a blackboard in my office i used for work and i i ruined it i didn't ruin it i wrote all over it yesterday amen the the book of redemption was sealed and we had to have an understanding of the book of redemption the seven seals sealed the book of redemption inside amen but god came and revealed that book of redemption because he loves us amen that's the whole reason that's the whole thing amen that's all of it right there you sons of redemption oh no you're not a son of the world you're not a son of of i'm not a son of foot in the hand of take i'm a son of redemption amen i'm a son of jesus christ amen i was taken from this world and i was redeemed amen i was from moab amen look at the time of boaz uh salman is boaz's father so we're gonna just assume bo salman's still alive in his in his lifetime jericho was taken so israel is still a young country so is israel still very much aware of what happened in moab everybody knows they had they heard the stories of balaam and and then the the the uh all those men committing fornication with the daughters of moab and and um all that transpired in that story and yet you have a family of israel go and move to moab fresh in their minds it just happened they were very good at preserving history anyways but this just just happened a couple generations ago a few generations back you know their great great grandfather or their grandfather it could have been elimelech's you know great grandfather could have been one of the ones i don't know but they go to moab and so you have ruth a moabitus what was the talk of the town do you hate boaz is redeeming a moabite you remember what god did to those other ones that married those moabites he's what he burned in fire or something like that he killed him dealt with them and here boaz is how can that be a god if you're deeming of a moabite oh god this is because it's not about what we think it's not about what we say it's not about the laws that we bind god into we like to shove him in a box because we think we understand how he works but he says i'm sorry at this point in time he was giving them a foretaste of redemption amen praise god so boaz a man his his his his mother was rahab and look out look how blessed boaz was it appears he has a very wealthy and he's doing good with his his um land and everything god blessed him because of the sacrifices man god blessed him because rahab stepped out in faith amen salman took her to wife and then god was was was blessing that and so but ruth with an act of faith laying at the feet of boaz requesting him to redeem the lost inheritance of naomi amen it was an act of faith to preserve redemption but boaz and here's where we're starting to get to it when i when i was on my heart this morning boaz a son of redemption could catch the revelation of redemption he understood he heard the story of rahab shared her testimony of how she was redeemed boaz understood he didn't turn his nose up when god said when god said implant redemption he didn't turn like some people they want to turn their nose up because oh they're they're not good enough for it they don't understand it they don't have a revelation of redemption but boaz a predestinated son of redemption had a revelation and took ruth to wife that was foreordained of god to type christ and the bride boaz was acting on the will of god because of revelation that's the only way you can act upon god's will is if you have revelation and how can you have that revelation unless you are a son of redemption [Music] amen we we can read of a scandalous story in ii samuel 12 7 a and nathan said to david you are that man the judgment stood up and said brother david you are that man the judgment stood up and said brother silas you are that man amen but god had a plan of redemption amen and god came and david comforted bathsheba his wife and went in under her and lay with her and she bear a son and he called his name solomon and the lord loved him god through that union that started out amen that started out as a harlot relationship much like rahab started out as adultery contrary to god's word god said i have a plan of redemption through that god gave them solomon another son of redemption amen anointed king of israel the wisest man david's repentance amen david's repentance to god amen brought forth a promised son in the plan of redemption a son of redemption and just like through christ the promised son just like through christ the son of redemption solomon did what restored worship to israel amen god brought solomon along he built the temple he he told faced the temple and he prayed and god's presence came down and that avenue of worship was restored amen so what does a revelation of redemption come from a son of redemption amen brings a restoration of worship amen amen god had a plan from the very beginning god likes to oh i'm raising my voice because i'm excited amen god likes to send examples for us to see and in his own lineage saints of god he showed an example of redemption to bring the true provided place of worship for you and i amen it is because we are predestinated sons of redemption that we can have a revelation of redemption amen god restores worship with us through that amen he gives us a promise if you'll turn and humble your heart and seek my faith and face this place amen god will forgive you your sins and then because he knew we would be living in a fallen tabernacle amen so he restored worship but he gave us the ability to continually wash us amen and wash us to stand and walk in his grace and his purity amen praise the lord it takes the son of redemption or predestinated it's not a redemption to capture revelation of redemption he got to revelation amen and you can only he'll only call you by name amen if there's that seed within your heart amen we can read in ezra chapter 3 verse 8 i'm just going to turn there really quickly here i usually mark in my bible sort of quickly now in the second year of their coming under the house of god at jerusalem in the second month begins aruba the son of shaltil and yeshua the son of jose and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the levites and all that they they that were come out of the captivity unto jerusalem and appointed levites from 20 years old and upward to set forward the work of the house of the lord so zerubbabel was anointed of god to return to jerusalem from babylon jerubal was in the lineage of christ you think that was an accident what was the thing that zerubbabel did he went back and begin to restore worship amen an act of faith on his part there was enemies there they wanted to destroy them in an act of faith amen to preserve redemption reservable another son of redemption amen again through a son of redemption true worship was restored typing the restoration of worship amen coming through christ praise the lord so now we have restored worship amen amen praise the lord we have one last example in the scriptures amen the last man in the lineage of christ joseph now here we have joseph is a man of integrity a man a carpenter a man who understood the law understood what was right and what was wrong yet he knew the story of rahab he knew the story of tamar he knew the story of ruth these were his lineage these were his ancestors and he is a spouse to a young girl named mary all things are going well and he's a this beautiful girl he's going to marry her he's betrothed to her everyone is happy then mary goes on a little trip and she comes back she's obviously pregnant now joseph is is torn now joseph doesn't know what to do he's a man of integrity this is the law says oh there's so much states of god the law said but grace the law said put her away but see joseph was the son of redemption amen joseph understood the power of redemption how could he not you know the story of your grandfathers and great-grandfathers that fought in the war and you can tell their stories he could tell the story of rahab and salmon he could tell the story of ruth and boaz he understood redemption he could tell the story of david and bathsheba amen and the the solomon and he could tell these stories and he knew and perhaps will take the liberty to say so he was thinking upon these things when he found out when she got over the initial shock that his betrothed was pregnant out of wedlock wedlock and you can read it in matthew chapter 1 verse 18 amen and now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she was found the child of the holy ghost then joseph her husband being a just man see just just and not willing to make what willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privily but while he thought on these things while he was thinking about this he hadn't made the decision yet he was giving it careful meditation and thought thinking i'm taking the liberties this morning to god thinking about rahab thinking about ruth wow he knew these stories of redemption he understood it he was a son of redemption he he thought i i probably wouldn't be here if it wasn't for rahab i probably wouldn't be here if it wasn't for ruth i am i'm part gentile and while he thought on these things the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name emmanuel which is being interpreted is god with us then joseph being raised from sleep dead as the angel of the lord had bitten him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name jesus you do you really do you think that dream could have gone to any man in the same situation and they have done the same thing joseph does no no he had to have a revelation because you can read these scriptures point blank to somebody about the major things that we believe in the doctrines that we believe in the revelations that we have the mysteries that were tied up and they will look you in the face and say so it's a hat and it's as plain as day it took revelation on joseph's part to accept the message from the angel amen he came to him in a dream but because joseph was a son of redemption amen he had a revelation of redemption and he redeemed mary to be his wife and what did that bring forth the promised son jesus christ when you heard christ call your name amen because you're a son of redemption amen you caught a revelation of that message amen and god gave you seed to bring forth the promised son in your life amen do not think it by accident that these people were in the lineage of christ amen he caught the revelation and accepted mary in an act of redemption she says of god it goes much further than the cross amen it's all about you realizing christ as your husband amen it's you realizing christ as your friend because he really really really wanted to know you he really really really wanted to have fellowship with you but he could not do it hallelujah until you were redeemed amen and you could not be redeemed unless you were a son of redemption hallelujah praise god amen every one of these men were a part of the lineage of christ and what have you become amen by your redemption you become a part of the lineage of christ you are the sons and daughters of abraham amen the sons of redemption amen typing out the redemption story this is true restoration amen you have to be a son of redemption to catch a revelation of redemption amen oh john wept because john understood what i've said this morning john understood it took revelation from a son of redemption but he understood unless that was loose unless those were opened up we didn't have a chance those aren't my words saints it's in the bible all creation would be lost if it was not opened up but that book was not taken by the land amen how can we be redeemed in this last day and age unless it's open unless god has revealed it to us it's a love story saints of god it's god's desire it's god's heart desire to fellowship with you amen and when people shut the door they turn their back on god amen and god can have no fellowship with them their life cannot manifest amen what god desires for it to manifest because they cannot come and receive from christ amen the promised seed amen amen praise the lord it cannot be revealed to you unless you are a predestinated son of redemption you caught a revelation when he called you by name but you also caught a revelation of christ that's it you can't catch revelation of jesus christ to you unless you're a son of redemption next time the devil comes up and says hey you remember what you did sorry that wasn't me i'm a son of redemption sister you remember what you did sorry that wasn't me i'm a daughter of redemption amen who the son sets free is free indeed amen i have come to bring truth amen jesus met a woman in samaria he said listen our plans were to go to this city but i gotta stop by samaria for a little appointment you guys go in town and get the food i'm gonna sit here for a little bit and up comes a woman little did she know that day little did she know that day when she got up and she put her head down and she went in the heat of the day to get her water amen in pain and torment of the life she led that she would meet the son of redemption and then he would tell her everything she ever did and testify to her welcome to the lineage of christ welcome because you are predestinated daughter of redemption and then she caught a revelation you're the messiah he spoke to her he called her by name and she accepted the invitation because she was foreign before the foundation of the world to accept it as much amen you see these ain't so god it's a big picture but it's simple amen jesus christ loves you [Music] and he wants you to understand that amen he wants you to receive that love so he went to the cross then he loosed the seven seal book of day that's right because he wants you to be with him you're his wife a man and a woman in a true god-ordained relationship are inseparable amen because there's a love in their heart for one another god doesn't want god is asking us to stop following him in fear and start following him in love let him know amen let him know how much you love him next time a fear will come upon you or you would want to you will be tempted to do wrong remember you don't do it because you're in love with him you would it would hurt him for you to fall amen that's the relationship christ is looking for amen praise god but guess what you will do the right thing because you are amen a predestinated son of redemption called by name amen praise god if the musicians want to come this morning amen amen we're so thankful amen that god has given us the gift of redemption amen he didn't he didn't have to well i'm not going to say that he had to pick you you were predestinated oh saints of god i was thinking yesterday lord i want to know you more yes i wanted to be sober i was praying in my office i said you know how he will sometimes you come in and you know we did it at the office when i worked in phoenix you come in and you give someone some help or something you'd sit on the side of their desk and just talk to them the lord just come and steal the side of my desk share this moment with me i want to know you like that i don't want to pray to you as if you're some far off god in the universe somewhere outside of me i don't want to pray to you as if i have anything to hide i want to pray to you god like you're sitting next i wanna i wanna speak to you though that you're my true because you are my redeemer and and looking through this and studying this and then realizing again afresh god reminds you of things that the he redeemed us because he wants us he wants your heart saints of god he wants to he wants to sit down beside you and and he wants to walk with you and he wants to go to work with you and and he wants to go to bed with you and he wants to get up in the morning with you and drink coffee next to you and he wants to share your morning devotions but you have to let him do it amen we don't we don't mean we don't mean to push him aside but we get caught up in life we get caught up focusing on the wrong things things of god and when we forget to ask him will you come by our way it's that simple thanks to god next time you have devotion just lord come and sit back while i read you think of god this is not a book to be debated argued over the top of it put down and stuff on top of it collect us this is his love letter to us he loves you so much he wrote this book he loved you so much he had everything put in place perfectly thousands of years apart and yet people want to take it and say oh we don't need that we're going to make a new book we don't need that anymore in our schools we don't need that anymore in our government we we have it figured out thanks to god that we can point the finger out the world but when we're too busy for god we do the same thing we leave it sitting there on the shelf it's because we're in a fallen tabernacle saints you're going to do it from time to time god's standing there saying i love your son i love you daughter i don't care what what some other man has done to you or what your parents did to you or what your friend did to you they don't matter in you it's me and you [Music] god is calling out to you this morning son of redemption it's calling out to you to come surrender your life to him because our heads are supporting you i'm sorry saying i'm not getting emotional to try to work something up it's just the presence of god i just feel led to call out against honor redemption don't you realize who you are my head's bowed around my eyes are closed if you're that son of redemption raise your hand nobody's gonna see i'm not gonna see only god is going to see you heed as call the sworn as is you have hurts and you have pain in your past but god has come to redeem it you don't think rahab had hurts you don't think rahab had visions of her past she did but god gave her the strength to overcome them and become a lovely wife for some godly man daughter of redemption do not fear he won't hurt you he's a gentleman he'll take you in his embrace and he'll show you how to be a garth woman oh heavenly father i lift my hands to you this morning i'm emotional not because of trying to be dramatic
