dwelling on some past memories cause he's the same God who's living in me oh the same God who spoke to the woman at the well he's the same God is wonders to many same God departed in couraging Red Sea he's the same God living in me foreign God who created all the heavens and all the Earth came back in Jesus and there was power in his word but now when these last days are beginning to see that it's

at the well he is the same God his wonders to many times [Music] he is the same God for his living in me aren't you glad you can say Amen to that tonight hallelujah thank you Lord amen uh just a couple little announcements reminders uh Grace kids this coming Friday at 7. brother Sergey sister Julia's house and uh then Grace youth group meeting 7 p.m at brother Chris sister Christians so um look forward to that let's not forget one week from now Lord willing our brother Marcus Becker will be traveling through and uh looking forward to a wonderful Wednesday evening uh just hearing the gospel preached in brother Marcus's perspective and I I like brother Marcus's perspective I like his his approach to the word of God and so let's just remember share this maybe we'll put that on the WhatsApp to just get people reminded to come out make sure they don't miss this so let's just remember each and every one that uh for whatever reason might not be here tonight life gets busy I'll say that and sometimes whether we don't feel well or circumstance but just lift them up in prayer Also let's just stand I want to speak to you maybe on a a kind of a different title tonight and thank you you sister Ruth brother Jason he didn't even say a peep in the back room yeah my oh my brother Sean always enjoy the guitar I want to speak to you on the overall topic once again of our present circumstances and as we look at this my brother and sister anybody have a circumstance today yeah I don't think we can make it through a single day of life without a circumstance amen I want to greet our our visitor come back good to see you again sister and our brother Mitch amen it's just we had a lovely time with your parents and and Saints his mom is not named Kimberly his mom's name's Jennifer and uh so you talk about a serious need to eat some shoe leather uh uh and what's worse is I never even caught it I just would have made that history and uh sister Jennifer has quite a sense of humor and she sore spot where she rubbed that in but it's good to see your brother Mitch so as we look at this I want to take out of the scripture tonight uh just a view as it would be maybe a little different perspective paint a picture and we could stop and look at that picture speak to you on the season of the slipping away or the catching away you realize this is all the same season and so I'll just I'll just get right into my thought without pre-pre-preaching it will turn to Luke the 6th chapter verses 43 through 49 and you might say brother Paul how does this fit but you'll see that it's got the contrast of both sides here and in that there is a slipping away and a catching away taking place at the same time and I think you'll see that contrast in these scriptures right here for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit for every tree is known by his own fruit so we can't even say that our fruit is identified by the fact that we all go to Grace and that we all adhere to what we call the message see that's a problem that people sometimes you might say critics they have taken this brush and made a very broad swipe with the brush and everybody at that church is not nice an impossibility unless you have a really really messed up circumstance so we don't want to in life beyond this sermon tonight we want to be very careful about taking and painting things too broadly because we look this and now a good tree cannot bring forth corrupt fruit and neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit for every tree is known by his own fruit for of thorns men do not gather figs nor of a Bramble Bush gather they grapes a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh so that identifies every individual directly because I don't care how domineering maybe a Ministry might be in a church he never can speak for every person there and I don't care for how loving people can be they cannot speak for everyone so it is of the abundance of the good man's heart don't you love that it just stirs me amen a good Treasure of heart bringeth forth that which is good evil man out of the evil Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh and why call me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doeth them I will show you to whom he is like now I want to take this for just a second let's jump back to verse 46 if we call him Lord I believe this scripture just my point of view if we call him Lord that implies that we should be obedient to what he said otherwise it becomes a lip service we're saying oh Lord but we don't really care we're not elevating as the song says uh uh putting him in preeminence that's what we want to do let him have the preeminence in our life that's important amen amen so they hear these sayings and they do with them I'll show you whom he is like he is like a man which built a house and dig deep now I'm gonna just hold you first standing for just a second we get through this now we'll come back and visit it here's like a man who built a house and dig deep and laid a foundation on a wrong and when the flood arose the stream beat vehemently against that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a Rock Amen but he that heareth and doeth not as like a man that without a foundation built a house upon the Earth against which the stream did beat vehemently and immediately fell in the Rune of that house was great Heavenly Father we just ask you Lord as we look in your word tonight just bring it alive to us father let it not just be a time we came to church and we saw and we sang but father let it be something anchored deep in our souls Lord just help us father as we press into the circumstances of our days of our weeks months years whatever might be father that Lord we would truly be anchored father not in the ideas of this Earth but Lord in you father we thank you for this time to come together in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Saints now I want to go back on this and take this and and I just want to make some observations of this from the the level or realm of humanity the spirit of the age my brother and sister is slowly shifting and the Spirit uh if I could put it this way to you the spirit is changing the culture we oftentimes say the culture is changing the spirit but no it is the spirit the anointing that is on the earth is changing the culture of humanity and the spirit that is operating is being manifested in the culture so when we see a culture now that that does not line up with the word of God that tells you the spirit that has been anointing the culture and so in this we'll see now that is I want to just dissect this for a moment you see this man who is building his house uh that a man who obeys the word of God looks to the word of God makes that preeminent in his life you'll see that he digs deep and that my brother and sister is against the culture of the day that we live in I'm not going to speak to you judgmental tonight but I am going to dispute directly my brother and sister the place that it should start the scripture says judgment not self-confidence building not wealth building classes not a networking none of the things that seem to be being offered as a reason why in the day that we live in but judgment begins in the house of God but judgment does not actually have to be harsh the holy spirit moves upon you realize every time that God speaks to us now it corrects a little something in our life can can we relate to that and when God corrects something and that that is Judgment but it's not always a heavy hand many times I would say most of the time if we will heed what God is speaking it is a very loving hand and so it's showing us this is not the way to go come back to our doctrines our teachings our foundations yes and no if our doctrines teaching and Foundations are based in the Bible then absolutely a large yes but if it's just a culture the traditions of man the writing of man books that say we must if you're going to be a faithful whatever then you have to adhere to our doctrines I say Amen to that if the doctrine can fit in the framework of the Bible if it's outside of the framework of the Bible what obligation do we actually have my brother and sister to obey the dictates of the church if the church is not scriptural amen and so we see the foundation that's being laid here and the picture is that we being hearers and doers of the word are building a house and oftentimes that picture gets caught up it's it's a house you know it's out here it's on it's on the rock you know looking over the ocean I don't know um is that uh uh sister Jerry and I one time was up in Coeur d'Alene stayed in a a place and there is it's absolutely just stunningly gorgeous there what lake is it at Quarter Lane Ponderay I don't know Coeur D'alene Lake okay Coeur D'alene Lake ponderay's farther north right okay Coeur D'alene Lake when you get around on that backside it'd be the east side coming back around there there's a huge rock out in the lake and there's a house built on top of that now you notice no sandy beaches it wasn't a place made to you know go out and throw your your umbrella and whatever but I'm telling you my brother and sister they found something solid to build that thing on it's just a gorgeous place I've always remembered that when I tie it to this scripture right here in fact when we were there on that trip that time I sat there and read these scriptures because I thought there I believe would be a Perfectly Natural example we actually have a picture somewhere taken with a cheap camera from it seemed like three miles away so it's like that house that spot right there is built on a rock but you see we are here doing some building tonight we are here tonight building a house that is you might say the shelter for the Holy Ghost the shelter for the spirit of God a place that we want to as it would be as Sons and Daughters of God being spirit being in the presence of God right we don't come as carnal men or women into the presence of God we come as Spirit beings and and as we come into that realm right there God's saying you know what I I'd like you to build me a a place that I could fill up I don't want to just come and reside on the porch or have a little space in the entryway I want to fill this house I want I want to occupy every room and crack and crevice of this house and so because by God's grace in our life the revelation of the word coming to us we didn't go out and just scratch a little spot and the first tip of the rock that we hit my brother and sister many people are anointed by the spirit of Christ the Holy Ghost but it doesn't get any deeper than the flesh so this scripture is not referring to someone who went out and said I'm going to build a house here I'm digging ding okay we're done digging this is where we're building the house but they went into every crack and crevice and laid the blueprint down and they cleaned that off so that the whole house are you with me the whole house is built on the rock you see the scripture says A house divided is a house guaranteed to fall and so we can't put one half of the house on the rock leave the other house out on Sand it won't work as we've seen some of the video clip in the news and stuff of uh Yellowstone River you know and I think anybody that especially we I listen or look watch at the news on the internet and and um and you know you see that in somebody's beautiful house that at one time looked right down onto a beautiful River and must have been a lovely place but you see as the dirt is slowly eroding away eroding away those people must have recognized that everything they had in that house you know the authorities wouldn't let him back in you can't run in there and say I at least let me grab my family pictures at least let me grab my ten thousand dollars that was in the safe in the garage nothing it was all gone so when you look at this equation we start digging and we're preparing as the scripture says what house will you build me Lord I built one real quick for you no he wants one that lasts he wants one that endures every test of time and so we dig deep and now I want to if you'll just let me tonight move over into another realm here there is a time that we come into the trials of our life the circumstances that we seem overwhelmed and it seems like what we've been living and what we've been doing is just going to fall apart it's going to shambles but there's something that's been laid in the heart of Sons and Daughters of God it's a spirit amen coming down anointing the seed that was there and what do we do we don't give up we dig deep and when others say ow if the Lord really loved me he would have come on this scene and he would have changed this circumstance whether it be a loved one a friend or something personal financial whatever it might be in the family and people that say if God really cared he would have changed that but the real believer that's got a seed inside of him he gets his shovel back out and says I don't think that I'm anchored to the rock well enough Lord forgive me and we start digging and we dig deep because we know who we are in Christ we're not guessing it's not attached to the church and hoping the church is attached to Christ but we know who we are attached to and we dig deep and When Storms Shake us as a story of the oak tree and our roots are pulled and seemingly getting looser and swaying more but then when the storm ends The Roots have room to grow you see there's so much value in digging deep and I say even as we've announced the kid Grace kids in their youth group tonight there's Merit for us to put every bit of Labor that we can every bit of strength that we can to dig down a foundation for our children for our young people that they would come and will not be blown away by the things of this world my brother and sister I'm glad I'm a farmer I hardly ever go to town I hardly ever get a dose of Walmart I hardly ever get a dose of the grocery store but yet in a way it's not good because we're too sheltered sometimes and we don't really realize how good we have it God is good to us Saints God is so good to us we go to places not being judgmental but you can see that the impact of the spirit of this day is having upon people I just went today and got some parts for a truck saw a young man who was waiting on me and I don't know I don't say this judgmentally please believe me I say this in wonderment of why a man would get a tattoo on you might say his bicep reads and his arms were quite bigger than mine of a hideous demonic face why anointing Spirit of the age trying to set a foundation that when these people move forward in life the circumstances they face what way will they go they're being pre-anointed for the circumstance coming to them and have you ever noticed how I say this by God's grace have you ever noticed how you'll read your Bible you'll study a message you'll be listening you'll do and you'll be wow that's good that's good and this happens to me quite often maybe a day maybe not even a whole day but a little period of time and what you have read and heard is exactly what you needed a reminder pre-conditioning you to come to a place that when you face that trial you don't say oh I'm giving up you say no I've already been given the answer God has already come on the scene through his word and spoke to me and I'm able now to set it down and say let the storm blow I'm prepared I'm not blindsided I'm prepared and we look at this my brother and sister how that the man who chooses not to put the effort and I was going to say this and I don't want her to I don't want to paint everyone with the brush I do business with a lot of people and more and more no one want to put out any effort I want to serve God now don't misunderstand me because serving God shouldn't be something we have to as it were labor labor I'm going to force myself to do this so understand the context I'll serve God if I don't have to invest anything I'll serve God if all I got to do is you know burn and research even shows now that people are slowly it used to be people would drive going back in time people would drive up to 30 miles to go to church and it's shrinking now in bigger cities it's down to blocks why no longer an anointing to dig deep they want to have their ears tickled they want things convenient I don't know if you guys have seen it's kind of a pun against that stuff a couple going around interviewing churches and they've been to this church and you don't offer daycare I'm not going there and you don't have coffee and donuts they're not going to go to this one and then they finally come to the church and they're telling them our church has this and it does this and it does this and it does this and they said and we have um we have a service at 10 o'clock and they said stop you don't have a service later than 10. no we have church at 10. well we don't even get up on Sundays by 10. man and wife look at each other this one don't work either there's no desire sacrifice no desire to dig deeper no desire to say you know what I want to go I want to go to church where Christ is present I want to go to church with godly people and if I have to drive I'll drive if I have to get up early I get up early if this is the time church is I'll do that you see these things are fading away it's a world of convenience and you think that that's just happening I was just talking with a man the other day and he told me he says Paul he said I remember when a Circle K in our city was built and the shock wave that went through our city because it was going to be open on Sunday and he said it wasn't four or five months everything in their city was open on Sunday people want that they desire that and so we see that this man doesn't want to dig deep and so it's there that he just scratches out a foundation he doesn't really get down and ever say Lord what does this scripture mean never digs in and says Lord I want to understand your word even if I have to pray and I have to labor and I have to push into this I want to understand your word Lord you see that's done we're we're into the age that we never get deeper than the superficial of the word John 3 16 being one of the most famous and oft preached scriptures and they only scratch the surface never catching the depth of what's in the word for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and never get to the depth of it to catch the Revelation that Christ knew us yes Christ knew us from the foundation of the world you see to know that we were always in Christ we weren't Johnny come lately people say I got saved last year no you just come and I think this is funny because the devil likes to imitate everything God's doing they just came to an Awakening everybody's getting woke my brother and sister the Bride of Jesus Christ has been woke for Generations they know who he is and they want to be exactly like him and the words matter oh get this a school teacher already in this school season that just started put on suspension for not using the right what what do you call that pronouns or whatever for a seven-year-old should have been the pronoun little girl it was a little girl just go to the office little girl and the little girl insisted to be identified with ridiculous terms it and I don't remember what the rest were a seven-year-old my brother and sister somebody had to facilitate not child somebody that's Anointed with a spirit facilitated that child so as we look at this I don't get sidetracked here in fact I better shift into another gear you look at this and realize what is happening we're seeing because things were built on a shallow Foundation it's starting to crumble and it says that the fall of the house was uh after being beaten vehemently that's the spirit of the age my brother and sister and being immediately it fell in the Rune of the house was great but I don't want to circumvent scripture so don't misunderstand me but you see the fall of something doesn't mean that one day it's standing and we're talking in the context of Salvation or people serving God it's not a fall that one day it's standing and then it just falls down but my brother and sister Satan has a way of undermining and people will go and you know I talk to a man sorry to put this in a personal basis but I talked to a man that quit being a Christian if I mentioned his name many of you would know him and and I I I said what went wrong and he said I'll tell you what went wrong I quit reading my Bible and praying years ago scripturally it fell immediately and the destruction of it was great but the actual manifestation of that took time and because he knew my brother and sister this is the part I want to drive home we'll move on he knew that when he quit praying and he quit reading his Bible he knew that that was going to be a detrimental effect but he was anointed didn't have enough time in his life had more important things to do and oh Lord help us to place values where the values should be placed and one of those values is digging deep enough to be anchored to the Rock Amen now look as we look at this I want to I want to just bring Hebrews 11 and then I'm going to kick it in high gear here and really get going Hebrews 11 24 by faith Moses when he come to years come of age refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ's greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect into the recompense of the reward and so he's looking there my brother and sister and he had placed such great value on the reward that all of the the um uh instantaneous all of the things that instant gratification uh had no value compared to the position of the promise of of uh of serving God being part of the body of Christ and so he rather chose to be with God's people you know one of the greatest things that the devil I've been there as a young as a Young Man uh just an experience we had the other night uh I won't go into detail but uh you know God allowed me to recount my youth to an individual because this this young man was in a position he needed to hear he wasn't the only one that fell down on his face at a time in his life raised in church fell down and struggling suffering to to write himself as it were in the day that we're living and I actually had to say Thank You Lord that I got to experience that kind of a thing in my own life that I could speak to him in sincerity and say you have just as much hope today as any man on the face of the Earth you have just as much right to the word of God to the throne of God as anyone on the face of the Earth to sit there now you all know what it is Hunters fishermen hard-working brother Jason calls him knuckle draggers it's hard for a man like that to cry and yet the power of God moved upon him so strongly he longed if you'll follow me he longed to go back and dig deeper but the devil's telling him he can't it's too late but there was some of us brothers sitting there with him including your dad and we got to remind him and encourage him it's not too late to dig that old shovel and start digging down into the word of God now look at this my brother and sister I'm going to get a little direct and I'm going to be reading quite a bit here so I hope you don't mind but you see my brother and sister we have to reject the immediate gratification of laodicea to take a halt of the promise see Satan tries to make it look like it's unattainable and that you need to just be able to take what you can take right now right amen this little phrase has been around for years uh we want what we want when we want it and that's how car salesmen work people walk on the lot they want what they want when they want it and they can't walk away they give them oh here's a car in your budget doesn't come with a stereo doesn't even come with a back bumper well I want a car with a stereo and one with a back bumper okay let's move you to this one it just has vinyl seats but it has a stereo although just AM FM and it does have this cheap bumper well no my friends all Drive nicer Rigs and they move them if you've ever been around a car salesman you know I'm talking from experience and now fortunately we escaped but anyway they just keep moving you along you come in here to buy a car that's got a 200 payment and you leave with a car with a 400 payment why because they just lead those dear children alone because they want what they want when they want it and so that power is so great well if you'd like to know depending on who you check with repossessions on cars are up 17 percent already I just watched one being repossessed the other day yeah my brother and sister that's how it works because they wanted what they wanted but they never dug down deep enough to be able to accept what God wanted them to have and you say what's God got to do with cars the scripture teaches us to be good stewards and count the cost First so everything really in life comes right back to that now look at this Satan's plan you see is tying us tying people to immediate gratification now I don't want to get Christ tonight we have young people here but you can just run your minds right over that and you can know where I'm saying and you see this my brother and sister that people are just caught up in this and so this is so pervasive it even comes down and affects our prayer life let's be honest tonight are we honest people we're Christians right we're honest how many of us have prayed Lord I need you to do this and I need you to do this and I need you to do this and 8 A.M would work that Spirits he has come into our life and we want God to pave our way in front of us because the scripture promised to even make the way smooth before us and so our idea of smooth is that life would just be and we do what we shouldn't do because we never count the cost and we'll see this my brother and sister affecting in many many things it can be in the way we raise our children um hope we have no conscientious objectors tonight the scripture never said ground your children the scripture never said do all this to your children but neither did it say beat them and I'm not advocating you know people boast of the stick they used or the whatever that was there I'm not boasting of that but there has to be a form of Correction taking a child's phone away from them for 15 minutes is not correction but that's what we've come to in the world I've watched children be grounded from Electronics and look over 10 minutes later and the child has electronics and you know why because the parent didn't want to be bothered and so they gave the electronics back to the child you know kind of like a binky to a baby right don't want to hear them sniffling and crying so we give them the binky and then we wonder why they're five years old still packing a binky because we've gave it back to them and we've never weaned them you realize God wants to wean us he wants us to wean us from this flash that wants it like we want it he wants us to wean us to a place that we're willing to get down on our face and say Lord thy will not my will be done and there's times in our life and circumstances of our life that that is a very hard thing to do because we've become so accustomed and we just expect God to do this the way we want now you know what the Lord gives us unique opportunities in life and I just want to share this with you going to read out of this here he said in The Courier said now this is just in a context of a story and The Courier said speaking back into to to Jesus and the Courier said sir I'm sent to tell you that my master has honored you with an invitation he's going to have a feast a great banquet is going to be given he does it annually and he wants you to attend this feast look at this how could he say such a thing how could he standing in the presence of Christ for his first time and then to carry on some kind of business about his self-style religion oh I wished I could have stood there first thing I would have done would have been following my face before him and asked forgiveness of my sins but that's just about the trend of the day when people come face to face with him they got other things they got to talk about instead of about our sinful condition amen that's right let me just interject this before I go on this is not a my ideal it's a different minister he said this whole fat of what would Jesus do he said we would have just went and conversed with them and he plated a rope and chase them out of the temple off the porch when they talked about we caught a woman in the very Act of adultery we would have said she deserves it Jesus wrote something I think we almost all would have a curiosity of what that was maybe a time maybe a date maybe a name and then when she says I have no accusers he says neither do I go in sin no more are we really my brother and sister at a place we want to do and say what Jesus did and said I think as real Christians God's bringing us to the place that the only thing that matters but I want to just be real Frank with you tonight there's times and circumstances in our lives that we would struggle to do what Jesus would say and do it brings us to a stark reality because we're looking my brother and sister as my title would say tonight we're looking my brother a time of either slipping away or being caught away catching away there's a time that it has to be all of the word of God or it may as well be none of the word of God men come to him and said hey um you know we're Mighty Men as it were and we've done many mighty works in your name and Jesus didn't sit down and say hey just enjoy the banquet because you've done these Mighty Works in my name he said depart from me because you were workers of iniquity because you see he never took they never took the people to The Rock right the rock is Christ so he they never took uh the people to the Rock they took them to religion oh Saints you think why was brother Paul preaching this because the tentacles grow every day the tentacles are slipping in we need a reminder once in a while and that man I can imagine seeing her master watch the fellow with pity perhaps that he was passing the greatest opportunity that ever lay before any human being was to stand in the presence of Jesus Christ there he was but you see he'd come in God had come in the form of a man and he didn't know it and there he stood and Jesus with all of his busy schedule with thousands of places to go and all he had to do and I can see him in politeness and gentlemen like nodding his said head said tell your master I'll be there what do we learn here that he always comes where he's invited can we say Amen I have never seen God fail to come on this scene when we got down in a serious form not in sincerity not flipping not just spur of the moment but something that we would come and say Lord I need you to come I need you to come on this scene I need you to walk with me today he's always there people say but I don't know no trust me if he wasn't there with you brother and sister the world would have fallen apart around you but he's there and while we think there's still chaos in the world do you realize we're walking in the very presence of God as they say about that uh the the hurricane and whatever and and the tornado that there's an eye in the storm imagine my brother and sister oh I know some of you have faced great things in your life great challenges to your faith but I want to tell you God has kept us in the eye of the storm the world around us is nothing but chaos trying to destroy us and Satan's trying to navigate that to destroy you and God says I'll keep you in this eye of the storm because you're the apple of my eye I will keep you in that position and I will provide amen I will be your provider you don't need to look to the world out here to provide oh my tell him on such and such a day I'll be present on that day because he has invited me I will be there now and then after that The Courier must have turned his back and walked away and breathed a breath of satisfaction that he'd done something great what he had done he'd let slip away from him the greatest thing in all the world the opportunity to fall at the feet of Jesus now look where this goes I wonder if many of us don't do that maybe we've done it this week we might do it tonight turn your back on the opportunity to be saved to have eternal life then turn away from it some people sometimes come sick get healed then walk away thinking that they have achieved exactly the main thing that they came for people come for miracles I want to say this very guarded we have experienced that in this church just recently thankful for the supernatural to touch a son and deliver from an evil spirit but then it all comes down to what do you believe oh I don't know about that I say that kindly because I've not given up but you see my brother and sister if we just come for the Miracles there'll be a way that God lets the Miracles cease if we just come for the fellowship there'll be a day that the fellowship will cease if we come for any other reason than to fall at the feet of Jesus God will take this you say how do you know that these things will go away because I believe I'm talking to Sons and Daughters of God and God will purposely remove these things from our life to cause us to have to go into a state of desperation um people say but my God's a loving God that's right he loves you enough to keep you out of hell amen that's a greater love than there is any kind of love any human can ever comprehend amen I'm not too offensive tonight am I amen I I wonder maybe we've done it this week we might do it tonight turn your back on the opportunity amen see sometimes people not everyone comes to church with the same motive not everyone has the same agenda think about agenda study agenda oh my brother and sister agenda steep if you aren't if y'all ain't careful you're going to fall into my agenda let me just scare you a little bit if you aren't careful you'll fall into my agenda because with everything that's within me I want to see you on the other side and standing Before the Throne of almighty God I want to see you standing there worshiping the Lord and not to look over and say praise the Lord I was there Pastor I led them to the Lord or I this or I that but to be able just to stand and base in his presence and look and say these were the ones that God called me to walk with and live with and and be around and and we made it Hallelujah but not all agendas are the same not all motives are the same the best thing to come is for to find him as your savior is to know him who he is in your life have the Assurance right that Assurance come from digging deep people today are like people gone by years ago they tried to dodge the issue it's it's like the Loaves and Fishes he was a great prophet as long as he healed the sick and performed Miracles but when he began to tell him the truth they began to turn away from him he wasn't popular no more then now we find that this Courier turned his back upon the Lord Jesus as far as the scriptures doesn't give that he ever asks pardoning of his sins or anything and walked away back down to his master the Pharisee you see my brother and sister sometimes we get so caught up and what we think will be God's way for our life and we hold on to our plan remember the story about the man in the bar his buddies and they were saying there was no Christian women there was no Christians and the man says no my wife's a real Christian no there's not it's a sham goes there you know the story he demands that she fixed some food and she fixes it and she throws he throws it on the floor man I'll tell you what you could hear the McCullough fire up in the kitchen come raging out there and attack them no should come right out there in the meekness of the Holy Spirit and cleaned it up and them three men wept because they had actually experienced the impact of a real Christian oh Lord I want to have that kind of impact I don't want to just be a mouth that talks about being a Christian I want to have a life that is so impactful that people would say whatever it is I may not even agree with him but it's true there's something happens there amen now there's something wrong with this story there it just doesn't make ends meet there's something wrong those Pharisees had no fellowship with Jesus they were at odds at one another and Jesus had no fellowship with him he told them uh you can pass seas and make one proselyte and then he's twofold more a child of Hell than he was before you blind leaders of the blind he said why did Isaiah speak to you you got eyes and can't see ears and can't hear how he rebuked them and balled them out and then one of them invited him to dinner isn't that kind of different somebody tried to undermine you but hey we have him for dinner we'll be able to tell everybody what we've done put it in the street expression we know there's a trump up the sleeve somewhere extra somewhere he's holding something because they had no fellowship with one another amen so I want to just move on here real quick as we look at this amen here again modern events let's go forward here there we go are we okay tonight Saints amen said my son called me over there today looked at television supposed to be a singing Bee where people come a bunch of little rickies we understand the terms especially from my day you would understand that term standing there shaking around like this rock and roll and singing them hymns it's a disgrace to Jesus Christ there's no more help me yes I said that word 50 times so I could stand here in front of you and say it correct and I just fell down on my face they're no longer solemn in church at all it seems like it's all become a rock and roll something in a fashion show instead of the Church of the Living God where Jesus Christ can manifest himself in power seems to me there's something wrong somewhere they're slipping away now I'm not preaching I want you to get this tonight let me set one thing straight maybe I should have started I'm not preaching to any people out there right I'm preaching to us inside these walls right here we're not out to say these people are all bad I don't I absolutely do not mean it that way but this is like a wake-up call for us to realize how easy things can creep in and my brother and sister it just slips in and then it comes down as it is here see there's something wrong they're slipping away amen the church slipping away we we start to lower our standard we don't want to offend anybody and this isn't that bad and whatever what we want to do is find that position where the holy spirit says I'm comfortable I want to be inside the walls of this church I want to be in your natural house I want to be in you but you see we can't look like the world act like the world live like the world and expect God to be pleased and I'm telling you what my brother and sister you don't have to go very far to go on something like you too and see people that are in the news over here for committing adultery and and uh uh breaking their marriage vow and then they're over here singing gospel songs oh I know that sounds harsh but is God going to bless someone who has just disregarded blatantly laid down ignored and walked all over the word and they say we're so blessed no let's not fool ourselves Saints God does have requirements amen amen oh no this is not a Works gospel we're not going to work our way to heaven but did the Ten Commandments ever get null and void no The Ten Commandments have never went null and void seems to me there's something wrong someone there slipping away and the Bible said it would be that way see look where you're at be careful wake up before it's too late if I could I we would make this look where you're at I'll have it highlighted in my iPad look where you're at God help us tonight Saints not a judgmental thing but just to stop little things creep in her life I'll raise my hand and just admit little things creep in and we start to just that's kind of normal kind of normal but it's not what does God do I say thank you tonight in all sincerity thank you Lord that he comes down and opens our eyes and says look where you're going you're no longer on the road you're driving down the grass on the side and the next step is a ditch but he says I love you and he draws us back into that straight and narrow way I put it this way in my notes I've been pondering this thought for a bit what happens it becomes common sounds common things in fact laodicea this age seventh Church age they're in Revelations 3 has become entirely too common the age we're living in has come entirely too common you know when I was a young man young people listened to me because the devil will do this to you if you can when I was a young man I had all kinds of desire to serve God and I had all kinds of music hid under the seat of my pickup and the music under the seat of my pickup and serving God were not on a parallel track but it becomes so common to me I could hear what the pastor the preacher said and go out and before I made it home be listening to that music and that in itself became a common thing and at first I thought that's not right but I overrode it long enough it was no longer even a voice saying I'm sorry this music here does is not compatible with being a Christian so we can become common to these things and it can become such a a powerful influence in our life because as something gets more common the more comfortable we become and we can become so comfortable with things that just a rudimentary look in the word of God would show us it's sin and where the spirit of it come from but we're comfortable you know I say this in a bit of humor because I'm not pointing the finger at you and pointing at me I sometimes struggle I walk into a store and the music in the background is something from my childhood and I buy what I'm going to buy and I get in the pickup and I'm driving down the road headed back maybe to the house of the farm and I find myself no no no no no and I'm like no sorry I first took all that I ain't got any Chevies to leave on the Levee you know very common popular thing in my day but you see how strong Satan is that he just gives a little bit of that and it embeds there and we go and if we're not careful what we got to do is we got to stop as it were and we've got to shed that we got to make a conscious effort to shed that and say Lord forgive me you say but I didn't do anything wrong it doesn't matter that spirit's right there put that out Lord forgive me I don't that's not my music that's not who I am I want to sing Amazing Grace is what I want to be singing I don't want to be singing that amen so look what's happening the Bible itself and we recognize that right that the Bible itself said there'll be a slipping away a falling away in this last time right so as we look at this I just want to go ahead and lay a couple more uh things out to you so these these common things these common sounds become so common they're actually rocking a world to sleep you know how some my wife I'll throw her under the bus I'm trying to cure that but she did something terrible to me many many years ago and that was she introduced a sound machine into our bedroom and I used to say I can't go to sleep because your thing is making noise now I can't go to sleep unless the thing is making noise so you see it become common that when it's shut off I hear a car go slowly down the road and I must get up and see what they're doing only by the time I get up the car going so slowly is nowhere in sight but I don't hear that car if we have our precious little sound machine and it's become so common to us we can't live without it are you with me Satan is trying to make things so common to us we don't think we can live without hey you know this good preaching sami's saying amen yeah bless you Sammy yeah so look at this my brother and sister I just this is the reason tonight you probably think brother Paul must have taken some kind of sedative because he's just like in first gear creeping along but I want to drive this home how Satan so cleverly has made it to where now the things that are not the attributes of a Christian and it's crept in where we feel like I can't live without this it's the way of the world being rocked to sleep that's what the devil's doing remember now I'm going to throw this in and we'll just we'll just call it quits here because I'm so far from a Finish Line tonight we would never make it there what's the scripture say about the wise and foolish virgin they slumbered and slept or we could get real Technical and say now now the bride she can't know the scripture said they all did the difference that's going to matter is how deep you dug that Foundation do we have oil have we made our preparation have we done what we know we should have done have we set our life in order have we done all we can do because spiritual Slumber and sleep my brother and sister is something that the spirit scripture says that if he didn't cut the time short that All Flesh would be lost yeah no flesh saved so what are we looking at our time to set it in order is now in our life here today laodicea now remember slumbering and sleeping in the context of scripture is you did not lose your salvation you did not lose your position or your uh reward with Christ that didn't go away because you see in that Parable they were able to stand up and get their lamp trimmed and clear they had a little homework to do before the bridegroom come but they had everything in order oh Lord don't let us be frantically looking for a shovel to dig down to the Rock and have a relationship with him then let's have our relationship anchored right now now I've got a couple more things I want to allude to you as it were to bring out amen if you mind I want to share this one last thought right here I'm not even getting to the good stuff yeah you know how it is we're just like you know I think I remember the one of the last times Brother David preached he just preached and preached and preached and preached and he said wow I got a half a page it's like Maya he's holding like 10 pages in his hand but that's how it works look at this this is a prayer dear heavenly father oh sometimes it hurts to be rude and hard but Lord God Pentecostal dollars has fed my children put clothes on them and when I see the church slipping away into worldliness God my heart burns because I'm zealous of that church the Lost hope that we have and yet I see your Bible says it'll be that way and this is why I'm going to go ahead and just call it quits right here because you see all that I've laid on foundation for the slipping away tonight I have that much for the catching away and so we'd be here for quite a while if we went ahead and dealt with the catching away so y'all just hold your breath amen and don't let the thoughts slip away and we'll get back to the catching away but but but but but but what does butt do negates everything in front of it but there'll be an elected called out of there for those he foreknew he called and those he called he justified and those who he justified he has already glorified look at this now I love this statement right here as we'll close on this sister Ruth you come please father that's the ones that we're pleading to tonight amen you see the one that doesn't care just formal religion I used to joke about this my brother and sister and Lord forgive me if I ever was offensive but on her way to church way that we used to drive to church you know you drive by some Churches and you'd see these families dad mom children climb out of there vehicle with a big ski boat behind it and walk into church with little short shorts [Music] and flip-flops and my heart used to ache or still does but we don't drive by there anymore they're going into Church yes church is a hospital but it's also a place we're called to meet God and that's how far things have slipped Saints I'm not judging them people trust me trust me that's how it's far walk into church with muscle shirts you know what I'm talking about just the shoulders a man your muscles are little short shorts and flip-flops going into the house of God to come and present himself to God the wife dressed very similar the children very similar you say oh that's terrible brother Paul but I'll tell you tonight Saints if it wasn't for the grace of God if it wasn't for the fact that the blood has come to us in God's grace those people were looking at would be us but I say I want to reverence the house of God I want to let the Lord know I care how I present myself to him I care about how I present myself in my prayers right we we can even pray incorrectly have the right intention have you ever done this oh well let me just rephrase that when you did this [Music] Lord we thank you for a lovely day give me a good night's sleep father let me get a lot done tomorrow and you know what that I want to do and I'm going to foreign how God must feel we don't even tell him we love him we don't say thank you appreciation for the word we're acting almost as though God is our servant instead of us being his servant but do you notice how this works Saints it just slips so carefully so casually [Music] prophet of God said we should be so in love with Jesus we can't wait to be in the house of God but look how things [Music] Lord help us now I don't want to sound judgmental on that because I'm fixing to start the season tomorrow morning and I will be worked and I could use the excuse I've got an ox in the ditch but the problem is is I hired that ox God's got Grace but let's keep our eyes open tonight [Music] of the things that the devil's trying to slip into our lives and if I would have just summed it up at that point 30 minutes ago we would have had the whole point the devil trying to slip that into our life and then we call it common and accept it let's not accept the comment let's hold to the word you love the Lord tonight amen hallelujah [Music] oh my oh my [Music] god brother Jason will you help me come to my soul Precious Jesus do you know that song sister [Music] let's just stand Worship the Lord for just just a moment Hallelujah come to my soul Precious Jesus my Lord hear me [Music] and cleanse me Lord give me [Music] let's just sing it again oh come to my soul Precious

don't have to make it up we don't have to try and manufacture it it's just something that's down in the depths of our soul and all I can say is this thank you Lord you place that there lord it's not something we did oh Hallelujah we got a moment for one more song can I buy an amen I was studying this and I kept finding myself singing the Days of Elijah and I just don't want to go home and have to sing it to myself again amen saw the Days of Elijah declaring the word of the Lord and we've heard the voice of the seven Angel righteousness being restored and all these are days of great trials a famine and darkness and souls till we've heard the forts in the desert crying away he comes shining like the sun and at the trumpet fall if your voice it's a year hear our design [Music] s and these are the days of your servant Elijah rebuilding defeater of praise and these are the days of the Harvest of fields are wise [Music] we are the laborers [Music] [Music] and do salvation there's no God like Jehovah there's no God like to hold up there's no problem to hold on there's no God like Jehovah there's no God like Jehovah there's no God like your whole life there's no not like Jehovah God on the ground goes Shining my voice [Music] [Music] [Music] let's just give the Lord a little thank you tonight oh thank you Lord Jesus oh thank you Lord that we can serve you in spirit and in truth thank you Lord for grace and mercy Thank You Lord For Your Precious Blood Hallelujah God bless your Saints amen pray for one another lift one another up amen whatever way that works for you but as I've told you many times what works for me is I just have to start on one end of the valley and I have to turn on this street I have to drive up there I go by the Graham's house I don't say this to both this is just how I do it I drive into town and I go by brother Bob and sister Joanns I go over a street or two whatever it is I don't even remember their names I just have to drive by Braille and I drive up the road and I turn in by Brother David sister Diane sister Ruth and I go up and I just do that and weave my way across the valley I go over there I heard somebody say this and I don't get offended oh eagle that's where the rich people live and I think brother Trevor and sister Carrie and I think just how rich they are they've got a treasure greater than any other treasure there is on the face of the Earth and we weave our way right through the neighborhoods and while she's not here yet I've already found myself driving out to our sister April's turning into that praying there wind in my way in case I missed someone Hallelujah those y'all left out that was just for sacred time I didn't leave you out so pray for one another lifted up in sincerity it's a wonderful thing this body of Christ this family of God it's it's beautiful you know I made a statement on the pulpit the other day probably shocked a few of you I saw eyebrows raised when I told you about how I had a love affair with sister Sharon [Music] I have a love affair with sister Sharon because I'm loving the fact that God is moving in her life and she is responding there's the love affair I'll give Clarity to that I just love what God is doing it's beautiful it's wonderful it's life-changing and I love it I love it I'm just in love God bless you Saints we'll see you Sunday amen [Music] foreign [Music]
