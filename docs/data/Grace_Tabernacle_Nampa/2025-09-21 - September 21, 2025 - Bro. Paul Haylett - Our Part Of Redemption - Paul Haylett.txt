TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] God bless you this Morning. Amen. Good to be gathered together again. Another opportunity to lift our voices, our hands, and our hearts in praise and worship. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. I'd like to start with number 472. This world is not my home. [Music] Four. Yeah, there you go. Sorry. Amen. Can you agree with me there? It's getting uncomfortable down here, isn't it? This world is not my home. I'm just a passing through. My treasures are laid off somewhere beyond the blue. The angels beckon me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Look, you know I have no friend like you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do? The angels beckon me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. They're all expecting me. And that's one thing I know. I fixed it up with Jesus many years ago. I know he'll see me through. Though I am weak and poor and I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do? The angels beckon me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Just over in glory land. We'll live eternally. The saints on every hand are shouting victory. The songs of sweetest praise drift back from heaven shore and I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do? The angels beckon me from heaven's open door and I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Amen. Amen. Number 158. Bless the Lord, oh my soul. [Music] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me. His holy name. That's the Lord. Oh my soul and all that is within me, bless his holy name, for he has done great things. [Music] He has done great things. He has done great things. Bless his holy [Music] name. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me. Bless his holy [Music] name. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me is his holy name. For he has done great things. He has done great things. He has done great things. Bless his holy name. Amen. Amen. He is doing great things. Amen. We need to recognize that in our situation. Hallelujah. It's not what he has done or what he's going what he word says he's going to because he's doing it now. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's just stand. I'd like to sing that chorus. Uh Lord, you are so precious or you're more precious than silver. I wrote the wrong one down. 185. Sorry. [Music] Oh, more preious [Music] than silver. Lord, you are more costly than gold. [Music] Lord, you are more beautiful than diamond. And nothing I desire compares to you. Lord, you are more preious than silver. Lord, you are more costly than gold. Lord, you are more beautiful than diamonds and nothing I desire compares to you. One more time. Hallelujah. Let's just tell him, Lord, you are [Music] more preious than silver. Lord, you are more costly than gold. Lord, you are more beautiful than diamond. Nothing I desire compares to you.

Let's just give him the glory that's due unto him. May he just be found in our praise and worship this morning. As we lift the words of this song up, just cry out to him.

Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, help me, Lord God. I feel like I hold back sometimes, Lord God. Hallelujah. [Music] Amen. We have a number of requests this morning. [Music] Take before the Lord. We'll ask our brother David to come here. uh talked to brother Sergey before the service. Um want to remember sister Julia, sister Julia's mom. Sister Julia be traveling to uh Ohio. I I believe Tuesday is when they said um her mom's going to have surgery. They found a tumor in one of her breasts. Uh it's close to, if I understand everything correctly, it's close to the blood vessel. They're doing a biopsy, but they're not sure the situation there. So, we just pray for sister Julia and the boys as she travels. Amen. Pray for her mom. Pray for a good report. Amen. Hallelujah. Um, my cousin Elizabeth's been back to the doctor. They've found cancer again and attacking her spine and close to her spinal cord. now um just asking asking for a healing. It's been a long battle for her. Amen. Just pray the Lord be with them in that situation. My brother, I remember him in prayer. some things at work, some situations very difficult. I can imagine he's all torn up about it and I would be. But uh just pray for him in that situation that the Lord would just have the preeminence. Amen. Just hold him up in prayer. Our brother Pashant and sister Koncha, little baby Isaac has been very sick. So we want to hold them up in prayer. knows a I think one of the worst things in life is got a little little guy like that. They can't talk to you. They can't they can't speak. You don't know what they're going through. Just pray for them. Amen. Pray for them as parents and pray for the boy, little Isaac. Amen. I like him just cuz I share his name, but I never met him. But just just pray the hand of God. They would just see the hand of God that situation. Amen. I don't have anything else written down, but if you know of a need, if you have something in your life, a situation, a sickness, whatever it is, lift your hand and praise him because he's already said, he's already provided a way. Amen. Amen, brother David. [Music] How great is our God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How wonderful, how precious he is to us. He brought you here this morning. I wonder if you will allow the great diamond to shape his diamonds this morning. It takes another diamond to cut a diamond. I'm thankful we have a diamond to cut us, mold us to manifest him in this hour. The word of promise for the hour. You know, you're the promise manifested. Let's bow our heads in prayer before him. Oh great God, our King, our Lord, our Lord Jesus Christ, how we love you with all of our hearts. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; We can't speak those words seemingly they just Lord through human vessels is inadequate. But you know our heart, oh God, we have come to meet you. We have not come Lord to hear from a man. We've come to hear you speak through a manes &gt;&gt; that the word would do its work in each of our lives personally as it is. It's been said it's doing it. It's being performed. Lord, let us raise up daily. Deny our enemy of self and take up our cross and follow you. Lord Jesus, we present these needs to you in the name of Jesus Christ. They've been brought before your bride. And now you're looking to what your bride will say and what she will speak. For you said, "If you abide in me and my word in you, it shall say what you will and it shall be done." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know that's not human vessels. That's the word veiled behind skin speaking. Lord Jesus, we are expecting here to leave raised to a higher plane &gt;&gt; because of your mercy to give us your word. &gt;&gt; Lord, let us not add to and take from that. But let us take you at your word and only believe. Father, we ask for the healing of our little brother, the word, the prayers have gone up for little Isaac. We say in the name of Jesus Christ, that little boy is healed. We proclaim it and we expect to hear the response and knowing that he's well and be for your glory and your honor. We pray give Aona and brother Pashant peaceord Jesus &gt;&gt; strength in this time not looking to what they see but looking to a divine promise. We have faith for that little brother Lord. We have faith for him and declare him well and for your service and purpose. Now Lord be with our sister Julie as she goes back with her mother having surgery. We ask for that lump to disappear. We just ask Lord that if she must go through that surgery then Lord let it be absolutely perfect and ordered according to your desire. Be with her on the road. Be with our sister Lord and the family. And Lord Jesus we just pray for the sister's cousin Lord that you have that she's gone through much struggle. We know that these struggles aren't by chance for your believing pe children. Nothing can happen by chance for believing children, your seed. It's all ordered of God. We ask that through this all that she would be closer drawn to you and may the word of God be fulfilled. And Lord Jesus, there's other needs, I'm sure, that I may not remember, but Lord, you remember every one of them. Therefore, we ask for thy divine purpose and desire to be done, even the hands that been raised. May you fulfill every purpose according to your perfect will. And let it be done right now that it's settled in the heart. The heart is fixed, Lord, that your word is perfect and flawless. It cannot pass away as we receive it. It's in action. We give you praise now. We give you thanks expecting you to be magnified and glorified as you have been already in our worship. We're not here to worship other. We're not here to be seen of others. We're here to meet you. And this we have done and will do more and more as your word is unfolded. But Father, we know that the path of the just is a shining light that groweth more and more to that perfect moment of our body change. We thank you now and give you praise which you're worthy of it in Jesus Christ's name. And we'll give you glory and praise by saying amen to the word. Amen. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. [Music] Good to see each one of you here this morning. God bless you. Amen. Number 368. Above all, [Music] above all power, above all kings, above all nation, and all created name above all wisdom and all the ways of man. You were here before the world began. Above all kingoms, above all thrones, [Music] above all wonderers the world has ever known. above all wealth and treasures of the earth. There's no way to measure what your word crucified laid behind a stone. He live to die. Rejected and alone like a road trampled on the ground. You took the fall [Music] and you thought of me above all. Above all powers, [Music] above all kings, above all nation and all created things, above all wisdom and all the face of man. You were here before the world began. Above all kingom, above all throne, above all wonder the world has ever known. above all wealth and treesures of the earth. There's no way to measure what your word crucified, laid behind a stone. You live to die. rejected and alone like a road trampled on the ground. He took the fall and thought of me above all. [Music] Hallelujah. Amen. As we ask our brother Paul to come, let's just stand. that the words of that last song, for whatever reason, they inspired me to sing this song. But so thankful that we have a God that is above all powers, above all kings. He's above all the ways of man. Hallelujah. And because we have a God that is above all these things, and because we have a God that dwells within us, I can sing, "It is well with my soul." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Just sing it out to him this morning. Hallelujah. When peace like a river [Music] attendeth [Music] my way. When sorrows like sea below roll. Whatever my Lord, thou has taught me to know. It is well. It is well with my soul. It is well with my soul. It is well. It is well with my soul. [Music] Oh, Satan should buff it. Though trial should come, let this bless control. Hallelujah. that Christ hath regarded my helpless stay and hath shed his own blood for my soul. It is well with my soul. [Music] It is well. It is well with my soul. I sing hallelujah the bliss of this glorious thought. I sing not in part but the whole is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, oh my soul. It is well with my soul. It is well. It is well with my soul. And Lord, haste the day when my face shall be sight. The clouds be rolled back as a scroll. The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend. Even so. It is well with my soul. It is well with my soul. Oh, it is well. It is well with my soul. What Lord is for thee. For thy coming we wait. The sky not the gray is our goal. Oh shout of the angel. Voice of the Lord. Blessed home. Blessed rest of my soul. It is well with my soul. It is well. It is well with my soul. [Music] It is well with my soul. It is well. It is well with my soul. God bless you. I would like to give Lisa the church age book. Could you see that that would happen today? Let's just sing that chorus again. [Music] It is well [Music] &gt;&gt; with my soul. &gt;&gt; with my soul. It is well. It is well with my soul. &gt;&gt; Could we just lift our hands today and just say, Lord, thank you. Thank you, Lord, that we have a rock that we are anchored to. That we can say today, it is well. We're not here with doubts and fears, but with a certainty. Oh Lord, we just lift our hands in our hearts to say thank you for a word that's come, a lifechanging word, Father, that has come and anchored us, Lord, today. We're not blown by every wind, every storm, every idea of man, every circumstance of the world, but Father, we're anchored in you today. And we can say thank you. Thank you for the confidence Lord that you place in our hearts. Oh, we still face trials. We still face struggles Lord. We still have our days Lord. But Father, we are overcoming this flesh. And Father, in the overcoming of this flesh, we are gaining in a spiritual man, gaining our rightful position, Father, that you called us to. Lord, just bless our time today. we ask Lord in your name. Amen. Amen. Amen. We just like to ask you I I I [Music] kind of told Brother Isaac, it's like I got something I can't remember, but my granddaughter Aaliyah, if you would just lift her up in prayer. uh she has I don't know that I would call it a blood issue but a blood imbalance that has left her um very weak uh with no strength and um we're just desiring for the Lord to just touch her. So please remember uh Jolyn and Aaliyah today as they are home and just ask the Lord to come and and touch them and any other needs that we might have here today. Just uh take a moment and just to just remind yourself God knows your need, but he wants to hear it from you. He wants to hear you say, "Lord, I have this need and you can touch my need." Amen. Is it good to be here today? Amen. I would like to speak to you this morning. God bless you, brother Cody. Oh, Sister Sammy, Sister Lois, God bless you. Good to see you guys. Um, I want to speak to you on our part of redemption. Now, we can look at this plan and say, you know, it's it's God that redeemed us and everything else is taken care of. But, you see, we actually have a part. God bless you musicians. I appreciate the song service was beautiful and the music. Amen. God has given you and I a part in the plan of redemption. Now the prophet of God puts it out in this fashion. He says you have to receive the promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so if we have a promise and it's never received, remember the story of the man who would not receive his pardon. It was given to him. Abraham Lincoln had signed that pardon, but he thought they were just mocking him. And he did not receive it. And it went to the courts. And the court says, "A pardon is not a pardon unless it is received as a pardon." And I say today, a blessing of God is not a blessing of God unless you will receive it as a blessing. And some people on the earth today, what you as a believer, as a Christian, would say, "God is blessing me." Now, you might see this a little different light than I do. You say, "God is blessing me." And other people say, "It sure looks like God doesn't love you." Because the scripture says that you're going to go through fiery trials. Amen. And we don't think fiery trials are blessings, but fiery trials are blessings. Amen. So, may the Lord just bless you. I pray today. Turn in your Bibles if you would uh as we speak on this our part of redemption. and um Matthew 19 16- 22 very very familiar uh uh piece of scripture uh maybe I'm using it in a slightly different context today but uh you will find it a very familiar scripture Matthew 19 vers 16 through 22 pardon me for a moment And behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life? And he said unto him, Why callst thou me good? There is none good but one, that is God. But if thou wil enter into life, keep the commandments. And he saith unto him, which and Jesus said, "Thou shalt do no murder. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness. Honor thy father and thy mother, and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." And the young man said unto him, "All these things have I kept from my youth up. What lack I yet?" And Jesus said unto him, "If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, come and follow me." &gt;&gt; When a young man heard these sayings, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. Heavenly Father, we just ask you to come, Lord. Just speak to each and every heart today, Lord. We didn't come to be seen. We didn't come to be heard. Lord, we come even as a man, I come with my own burdens today, Lord. Just asking you, Father, Lord, to move on every life, every heart, every circumstance, Lord, to speak to us the words of life that we need for another day. Father, we know that your word has said that you desire to bless us. May we receive that blessing today. Let us not put limitations of I'm not worthy or I have circumstance, but receive the blessing, Lord. That's what you want us to do. And we come today to receive that. If that blessing looks like correction from the word, Lord, we receive it. If it comes to answer a question, Lord, we receive it. If it comes, Lord, just to fill us a little fuller in our spirit, Lord, we receive it today. Whatever you would desire, Father, we want to receive it. And we receive it now in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated. Amen. this young man having seemingly done everything that was necessary. We'll look at that, my brother and sister, and um I I think now don't take this in the wrong context, but I think if he was sitting in our midst, we would have thought that he was a stellar Christian. We would have thought that here's a young man that just does everything just according to the word of God so perfectly. But you see, it is there that there was something uh that was missing. And God discerned that. Amen. He believed the message. If I could put it to you this way, he believed the message, but there was a great big butt behind that. He he had a little something there. And and of course, we can see by the scripture that it was by his possessions, the lands, and the prosperity that he'd been granted. And as I have said, this is just a personal outlook. You've heard it many times here in the church. I believe if he had given $5,000, God would have blessed him with 10. Amen. Because what God was wanting him to do was surrender himself. It wasn't about his money. It wasn't about his lands. It wasn't about his prestige. God wanted him. Amen. And if we'll ever surrender ourselves to him, then God can truly bless us in the fashion that he desires to bless us. It's it's not about, let's face it, saints, if we're real Christians, real believers. It's not about our bank account, our houses, our lands. It's not about any of that. It's about us yielding to Jesus Christ. It's about what we give back to him. Because, as the scripture says, he has the cattle on a thousand hills. And you know, especially if you go to the grocery store lately, you'll realize those cattle on a thousand hills are worth a lot of money. Amen. So, he doesn't need our money. Amen. It's not about our money. People get all caught up. The preacher just wants our money. If you have surrendered to the Lord, you don't care because your money is his money and he gives you his money when he sees you need it. Amen. So, we look at that and realize what God is doing. So, he believed the message, &gt;&gt; but that's right. &gt;&gt; There was a little something. Now, Hebrews 4:12, it says here, "For the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to dividing a sunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." And here the rich young ruler is standing before Jesus. And uh Jesus doesn't say, "Uh, I remember a time when you didn't hold this commandment. I remember a time when you come short here. Jesus discerned right to the intent of his heart and said, "You know what? I see what it is that's hindering you." That's right. &gt;&gt; See, if he had come with a different approach, if he had had a different uh outlook upon what Jesus was saying, he would have said, "Oh, so Jesus, you're saying the issue in my life is actually my possessions. I give them to you, Lord. Here they are. What do I do with them?" And and I share this just as a an opinion if you might call it that if he'd have started in that approach and said, "Lord, I just give it all to you today. I have nothing." You see, God gives gifts. Some of you are good farmers, brother Cody. Some of you are good barbers. Some of you good this that and the other. I don't know, you know, to go through every occupation. But God gives you gifts, right? His gift was the ability to make money. His ability as a businessman. And he had that ability. It was something in him that he understood. And I I'm completely convinced if he would not have put the butt up there, right, which negates whatever's in front of it, if he'd have just said, "Lord, I give it to you today. I surrender it to you today," then God would have used him. There wouldn't have been a Lazarus laying on the street corner in rags and in sickness. There wouldn't have been many issues like that. But you see, it really come down. And and although there's no absolute connection between this scripture and uh the man laying uh there and begging for them to have Lazarus dip his finger and bring it over to him to quench his thirst. But you'll see as it is in the time that his barns were full. His prosperity had reached its maximum capacity that God said, "It's time. I call on your soul." And and none of that did him any good. He might have gave his offerings and paid his tithes, but God wanted him. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was what it really come down to. And and so, you know, uh, every one of us, if if this is a little straightforward today, then I just have to say, so be it. But every one of us has an issue that hinders us, that holds us back. Every one of us has something that we battle with. Every one of us has something that Satan wants to use to keep you from going forward. He wants to keep you from reaching your full potential in Jesus Christ. And he can just use that and anoint that. It might be a complex. It might be a little bitterness. It might be a hurt that you've had. And I'm not delegitimizing the fact that when we get hurt, we can be hurt, my brother and sister. But if you're holding on to that, Satan is using whatever happened in your life. You say, "But brother Paul, you don't understand how seriously that affected me." No, but I understand how thorough the blood of Jesus Christ is. And when we would come with that approach and say, you know what, that happened in the past, but the blood of Jesus Christ is covering me and I do not have to be controlled by last year, last decade, last century, whatever it might be. I don't have to be controlled. It doesn't have to be my previous pastor, previous friend, previous whatever. that God is in control. I'm going to let go of that and I'm just going to freely give myself to God, not going to hold myself back. Amen. Because you see, my brother and sister, if we allow Satan to use whatever little something happened in our life, Amen. If we allow him to use that, we'll go no further than it is theoretically, if you would say, or figuratively is what I mean to say. The dog on the leash, on the chain, only goes as far as the master gave him length of the chain to go. And this is going to hurt. Amen. If you've got a hurt, a bitterness, a complex, something holding you back, you are not in control. And God is not in control. Oh, my God is in control. Right? That leash that Satan put on you with a complex is actually what's in control of you. You're going to go as far as he does. And when he tugs on that, Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember Johnny Crow? &gt;&gt; Amen. He still had wings. He still had strength. He could still fly. But he had been tied up for so long. He didn't think he could fly. He just hopped around in the same circle he lived in. And if you like that circle, help, forgive me for being blunt. If you like the circle that you have been living in, then don't don't push out. Don't don't stretch out. Don't reach for more. Don't ask for more. Don't look for deliverance. Just keep hopping around in your circle. But if you're a son or daughter of God today, you're not earthbound. You're not called to be constrained by the spirit of this world, the politics of this world, the economics of this world. You are called of God to live in a heavenly kingdom and to rise up into heavenly places. That's where God called you to be. It's time, little church. It's time for us to spread our wings and say, "God has given me liberty through the word of God. I am not going to be bound by the principles of this world. I'm going to fly in heavenly places. The word is set me free and I will be free. Amen. Because what the word has done, my brother and sister, has broken every feder and has broken every circumstance, chain of circumstance that Satan wanted to use to keep you bound. It's time for us &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; to accept it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's time for us to say, "This is my day of deliverance. This is my day of moving forward. This is my day, you might say, of letting bygones be bygones." That things in the past that that uh bring such emotion and hinder me. Amen. We'll see marriages. We see relationships. We see friendships. We see all of these things and relationship with the Lord all bound by chains of circumstance. My brother and sister, the chain is broken today. God has given us liberty in Jesus Christ. Amen. So you see this young man had been given at that time. Now I'm not trying to imply that because someone does not react at a certain time or place that the window or the door is closed on them. I'm not implying that. But this young man had been given an aotted time to lay hold on eternal life. Now I want to emphasize this point. You can be laying hold on eternal life today or you can lay hold on your circumstance. You can lay hold on the problems you have of of uh things of the past, current things. You can lay hold of that, but have you ever watched I actually thought about bringing a prop today, but I didn't want to come across as some kind of a a show as it were, but I'm telling you my brother and sister, if you've got both hands full, you can't pick up or hold on to anything else. &gt;&gt; That's right. And over here, I've got a complex. And over here, I have a bitterness. I have something I I either I I know I should ask for forgiveness or I should give forgiveness. And my hands are full. And God's saying, "Lay hold on eternal life." What What are you going to do? &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants you to let go of this. He wants you to let go of this. And he says, "Lay hold on eternal life. You got to let go of this, to take this, to accept this." And Satan says, "No, I'm going to give you something to hold on to because if your hands and your heart and mind are full, you will not be able to lay hold on eternal life." &gt;&gt; That's why people go through life with all kinds of things in their life. They look back and tell you the time, the place, the second, even the very words that were spoken with accuracy. My brother and sister, what they don't realize is Satan has fooled them to holding on to something that has no eternal value. Nothing going to replace letting go of that. Nothing's going to to come by holding on. It's going to be well, do I accept this and lay hold on eternal life or do I keep a hold of what do I got? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; You know, my brother and sister, this been when I was a kid, but you know, they used to have that show. I don't even remember its name. I want to say it was Price of Right. They had Price is Right. They had doors and people would be there and they would say, "Here's $10,000." Now, if I was on that show and they said, "Here's $10,000." I'd say, "Thank you." And they'd hear a door slam. But they'd say, "Would you like to trade your $10,000 for what's behind door number one?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Door number two, &gt;&gt; door number three. &gt;&gt; You say, "What kind of silly analogy is this?" Well, I want to tell you, God's already given you eternal life. Satan's trying to get you to trade it for something that's behind an unknown door. We as the bride of Jesus Christ have a promise of the word. What he has promised us, it is in our hand. It's been given to us. It's time for us to lay hold on that and say, "I'm not going to trade it for some promise that Satan's got going to make me a millionaire, going to make me a this, going to make me a that." No, I'm sorry, Satan. I'm not trading my promise in the word of God for something unknown result. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. I have something. I got eternal life. And God's telling us today, don't let it pass you by. Lay hold on that. Keep a hold of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had a moment that was allotted to him to receive. &gt;&gt; All it took was a few words, saints. It wasn't about words. &gt;&gt; No, that's right. &gt;&gt; It was about something in the heart. &gt;&gt; And he actually while he had followed uh you don't don't lift your hand, but how many of you have followed every commandment every day of your life? And I put it that way to drive home the point. This was an extraordinary young man. He declares to Jesus, I've lived this From my youth up, I have lived this. And I'm not driving home to condemn anyone, but to drive home the point here was an extraordinary young man. But &gt;&gt; you see, what he should have done is let go of that and laid hold of eternal life. &gt;&gt; But, &gt;&gt; and I want to ask you today, a little straightforward. Do you have a butt in your life? Is there something that you need to let go of? I want to break the ice for you. &gt;&gt; I'll lift my hand first. &gt;&gt; Got things need to let go of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because as long as I'm holding on to these things, &gt;&gt; that's it. &gt;&gt; I can't lay hold on eternal life in the fashion that God wants. You might hold on with one hand. &gt;&gt; That's right. You know, reminds me of a story. I hope you don't mind me sharing this. It's a little morbid, but there was a a young man who was this extraordinary uh uh ability, agility, strength. And even as just a child, he he got into rock climbing and and there was pictures of him at some spot where the the the path up the rocks goes. And it's literally an overhang and it had little shelves in it. And you had to hold on with your fingers, not hands, fingers, and go out and then go around the corner of the rock to climb up. And this young man, my brother and sister, had such an ability that he would climb up there. And he would do chin-ups with his fingertips in the cracks of these rocks and do chin-ups. But you see, those who followed, who didn't have the same ability and tried to do such things, fell hundreds of feet in the rocks below and died a tragic death. Now, my brother and sister, if you don't mind me putting it this way, you are an extraordinary people. You've been called from before the foundation of the world. You've been given an ability to live in Leodysia. Not just live, but to thrive in Leoa. not to just exist as Christians, but to do this super and exceeding and above measure that God has called you to. And my brother and sister, don't look down on those who can't live this. And don't look down on yourself when you have a butt moment. &gt;&gt; But God's still talking to you. He's still calling you. He's still telling you, "Come up a little higher. Come up a little higher, my brother and sister." You know, I I I I'll share the sermon here one of these days. I almost preached it today, but a little lack of preparation. But there's a there's a mountain. It's not really a mountain. It's a great rock spire. And and many people have tried to climb it. And these guys said, you know, somebody someday is going to climb that. And we're going to be the ones. Amen. My brother and sister. And that's as far as I'm going to go to ruin that sermon. But look at that, my brother and sister. See, they didn't look at that a rock spire. Many people have tried to live the word in Leodosa, but I guess it can't be done. No, there is something in the bride of Jesus Christ that says somebody's going to live this word. Somebody's going to take a rapture. Somebody's going to fulfill this scripture. It might as well be me. &gt;&gt; It's going to be me. I'm going to be the one that does it. And so I let go and I let go. And my childhood, maybe it wasn't the greatest. I let go of that. A relationship maybe not the greatest. I let go of that circumstance in church and days gone by. I let go of that. My own complex, I let go of that. My fear, I let go of that because I'm going to climb into heavenly places. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be one that's going to live the life. I'm going to live this gospel. I'm going to live the word. I'm going to stand there before them and they're going to say, "How did you live in Leodosia?" And you're not going to say, "Well, I did this and I did that." You're going to have to say, "I really honestly don't know other than my Lord Jesus was with me. He walked with me and he talked with me. And when I was weak, he was my strength. And when I had no understanding, he was my knowledge. And when I had no love, huh, &gt;&gt; that's the one none of us admit &gt;&gt; that we can lose our love." &gt;&gt; That's right. We get to the place we look at people, family, friends, relationships more like a tolerance. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I said vows to them, but now I just tolerate. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's it. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, my brother and sister. That's not what the word called us to. &gt;&gt; Let go of it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let go of it. We're not here to tolerate. &gt;&gt; I go to church with some believers. &gt;&gt; Well, how do you like them? &gt;&gt; I tolerate them. No, that's not what the word's talking about. &gt;&gt; You got to come to the place you can let go. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Let go. &gt;&gt; Let go. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let go. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He had his moment to lay hold on eternal life and we are living ours right now. &gt;&gt; This is our moment, saints. Don't Don't let it be history to you. Don't let it be a day gone by that you would say, "Oh, I had." No, &gt;&gt; don't have had. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Have &gt;&gt; possess, &gt;&gt; lay hold on eternal life right now. You see, this is our part of redemption. &gt;&gt; Hope you don't mind a little dehydrated this week. You see, as I said already, Satan will do anything he can to keep you from completely letting go. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Now, I hope you don't mind. This is here again something maybe some people would find a little morbid, but you want to go trap a raccoon. You don't need an elaborate trap. You don't need all kinds of scents. You don't need all kinds of things. You need a drill bit. That's right. and you bore a hole in the log. Then you drive a nail at an angle. And then you put the lid out of a can in the bottom and it's nice and shiny. And the raccoon puts his hand in there, his little paw in there to get a hold of the shiny lid of the can. And because he's too stubborn to let go, and he can't pull it out past the nail, he has trapped. Did you trap him? &gt;&gt; He trapped himself. Yeah. &gt;&gt; See what Satan's trying to do, saints? &gt;&gt; He puts these things out here. We take a hold of this. Oh, I I I had to apologize. As I've shared with the church, I used to think I had a bunch of German blood in me, but it's so small. I can't use it as an excuse no more. But I used to say I'm stubborn because I'm German. And then I found out I wasn't German. So, I have to recognize I'm just stubborn. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And as long as I had German as an excuse, I could hold on to that &gt;&gt; and say, "I can't help it. I am what I am. I was born this way." Well, it was. I was born in sin and shaped in iniquity. I came into this world speaking life. But I have been promised and you have been promised a deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's let go of that shiny lid. Let go of those things because they say, "Well, the devil did it." No, you're doing it under an anointing from the devil. But as long as you won't let go of it, you're trapped. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; It's time to let go. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let go and let God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, 1 Timothy the 6th chapter 11- 21. Lengthy reading here. But thou, oh man of God, flee these things and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. fight the good fight of faith. Now, if you've ever been around period of my life as a young man, I I wasn't serving God and I hung out in mall parking lots and theaters and stuff like that. Some things we won't go into details. Um, but I can just remember one time some high school kids from two different schools. And uh, the one boy had a pretty girlfriend and the other boy is basically trying to convince her that ditch him. I'm better looking and I got more money. I drive a better car. Ditch him. This other young man got so mad he goes out after this young man and all he hits is air. and the other kid and it's over. You see, you don't fight the good fight going out screaming, "Devil, I bind you. I'm a Christian. I'm a believer of the message. I'm a No, that's &gt;&gt; that's exactly right. &gt;&gt; And then the devil will come and &gt;&gt; and it's over. Then you go to church and say, "Pastor, I don't know what went wrong." &gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you, you weren't fighting the good fight of faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. The good fight of faith is what? Standing inside the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We get inside the word. We don't have to take and start throwing all kinds of things at the devil. We can just stand there and say, &gt;&gt; "But the word says &gt;&gt; the word says. The word says. The word says, &gt;&gt; not my pastor says." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now, this might hurt some of you, but not even the prophet said. That's right. &gt;&gt; You've got to come to the relationship. Your position is where the pastor I mean the prophet said, "I want to introduce you to Jesus Christ." What is that? A transfer. I've done a few weddings. I have yet to go home with the new bride and groom. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Rebecca said, "Eleaser, I've got my Isaac. Come live with us." No, she was content that Eleazar brought her &gt;&gt; to her Isaac. Amen. Did she have an appreciation? Did they have an appreciation for Eleazar? Of course. But you see, that wasn't Eleazar wasn't saying, "When you build the new house, build my suite. I'd like a nice master walk-in closet, my own kitchenet. No, no. Once the introduction is completed and I would say that the word has come in this hour and has completed the introduction and we stand here today with a relationship as it is with our Isaac. &gt;&gt; Amen. With our Lord Jesus Christ. Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold on eternal life. Now, I'll tell you this. Uh when this thought caught a hold to me in my notes, I had that very boldly underlined. lay hold on eternal life wherein to thou art also called. So this is not a whim. This is not just I felt like. This is a calling. This is something God said, you know, I've called you into eternal life. I want you to lay hold on to what I've called you. I want you to receive it. I want you to believe it enough that you're going to go out and take a hold of this thing. And I'm not going to let go of it. Now, this is when the nature of the raccoon moves from being stubborn to determined. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? He wouldn't be a raccoon if he just said, "Oh, cute." And walked off. It's got to have that nature &gt;&gt; that says, "I got a hold of this thing. I'm not letting go." &gt;&gt; So remember the fine line, the page. One side stubborn spirit, &gt;&gt; the other side determined. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's how close these two go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A stubborn spirit will bring you trouble. A determined spirit says, "I'm not quitting until I make it in the rapture." Well, and then you're not quitting. It's a fulfillment. &gt;&gt; So, look at this. Lay hold on eternal life, where to thou are also called and has listened to the preacher say that you were called from before the foundation of the world. That's right. &gt;&gt; No. No. You professed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You professed it. You stood up on your own and said, "You know what? I was in him from before the foundation of the world. That's who I am. You want to know when I became a Christian? Well, it's a little farther back than the anthropologists can even quite reach. You know, it's a few million years. It might be. I don't know what it is that it's there. There's no way to measure. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; So, you have a good profession, in other words, a positive profession before many witnesses. &gt;&gt; In other words, not ashamed of the gospel. &gt;&gt; That's right. I give you charge in the sight of God who quickenth all things and before Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession. Now remember Jesus just had to recent and they would have gave him life. &gt;&gt; All he had to have done is said there's been a grand mistake. &gt;&gt; He could have defended himself. &gt;&gt; He could have followed Satan's suggestion and called 10,000 angels. And the reason Satan wanted him to call those angels is because then it would prove that Jesus Christ himself and the word in him was insufficient. &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word &gt;&gt; and the word was with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the word was God. Amen. &gt;&gt; He would have had to deny those scripture &gt;&gt; if he was not capable. &gt;&gt; And Satan would forever say, "I don't care, brother Trevor, if you've got the word. I have defeated the word before. You've got no security." But that's not how it works. The word bound Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan did not bind the word. They say there was a failure on Jesus' part that he was crucified. I say today it was the absolute fulfillment of the perfect word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where would we be today if he had chose to walk free? &gt;&gt; Amen. We'd be here today just like our government. You notice the government never says the government's debt is trillions. The government breaks it down and says, "You as citizens of the United States now owe $39,64210 a piece." I'm sorry I didn't sign for that and I have no obligation to pay that. And so you see how Satan's constantly trying to put that issue back on the individual. But Jesus said, "Nope, I will pay the price." Do you realize I'm going to go off track for just a moment, okay? But do you realize there's actually something invading the nominal Christian church now? That men stand in the pulpit in their churches and make statements like the blood is no longer sufficient. &gt;&gt; Well, I want to know what is. &gt;&gt; If the blood is not sufficient, what is going to cover? &gt;&gt; There's nothing out there. That's right. &gt;&gt; Not knowledge, &gt;&gt; not ideas of man. &gt;&gt; If it's not the blood of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; we're doomed. &gt;&gt; So, let me put it this way, and it sounds blunt. The man who's making that statement's got an evil spirit on him. That's not a Holy Ghost-filled minister of the gospel. That's a demon &gt;&gt; preaching a demon's gospel. &gt;&gt; That the blood is no longer sufficient. So people will trust in the church. Now if you want to know where I why I say that, I'll put it to you this way. Because the word in this day has to be fulfilled &gt;&gt; and they have to make the word of God to none effect. It has to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; So they're in church believing they're worshiping God, but the blood's no longer sufficient. But our church is good. We'll believe in the church. They have to make the word of God to none effect. &gt;&gt; Scriptural prophecy. &gt;&gt; Okay, let me stay on track. that that thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, which in his times he shall show, who is the blessed and only potentate, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, who only hath immortality, dwelleth in the light, which no man can approach into, whom no man hath seen, nor can see, to whom be honor and power ever and everlasting. Amen. charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high-minded nor trust in uncertain riches. So, taking this back to our opening scripture, you can't trust in your bank account. &gt;&gt; Amen. Go on the internet. I did this morning just as a reference. You've got a reference over here saying if your money is in your sock drawer, inflation is eroding it. It's going down. Go take it to the bank and earn interest on it so you can gain. And then over here on the other side is a man saying, "You can't trust the bank. We can have another great depression and your money in the bank will be seized, locked up, and you'll never see it again." &gt;&gt; Now, I'm assuming you all have just substantial savings accounts. Sock drawer, bank, sock drawer, bank. Oh, neither. Wow. Come on. 1977. &gt;&gt; Many a preacher. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Said, "You're not going to take it with you. Give it to me." &gt;&gt; Can I interest you guys in a brother deal? No. You see what the deceiving spirit is? Why did they care about the money? Why did the preacher care about the money? Why did the people care about the money? It's not about the money. &gt;&gt; Amen. It should be lay hold on eternal life, saints. We're here today to lay hold on eternal life. All the rest of this is going to burn up. Going to go back into the elements. Amen. And look at this here. It says that we're going to walk out on the ashes of the wicked. And people have this idea. They're going to be walking up to our ankles or our knees through all of these ashes and ash stains everything. My brother and sister, do you understand? The fire burns everything and releases it back into its original element. When you're going to walk out on the ashes, it's not going to be this ugly ashes and piles and stumps everywhere. Everything going back to its original element and you're going to walk upon it. Amen. See, let's not get all caught up in little details about how this works. God, let God be in control. Let's take hold on eternal life. That's our one singular issue we need to worry about today. Amen. Is to take a hold of that. Amen. Trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God who giveth us richly all things to enjoy, that they do good, that they may rich be rich in good works. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm a rich man. Well, I want to be anyway. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I want to live a life of good works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I want to be a rich man. Anybody want to be a rich person today? Hallelujah. To be able to have good works, be able to fulfill the word of God, to to do these things and have the word declare you're rich. &gt;&gt; Or you could have a million dollars in the bank and have the same fate as a rich young ruler. We get to decide, don't we? ready to distribute, &gt;&gt; my help somebody out, &gt;&gt; get a better job, work harder, work longer, eat less. No, my brother and sister, sometimes the body is called to nourish &gt;&gt; the body. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, this sounds morbid. Forgive me. I don't accept the diabetes diagnosis. I believe I'm healed in the name of Jesus Christ. That's what the word of God says. &gt;&gt; But you know, one of the things that really kind of gets you, you know, is your body's so connected and when you have diabetes and your blood sugar is out of control, very rarely does a doctor come and say, you know what, we're going to cut your ears off because you have diabetes. &gt;&gt; But there's a part of your body that needs nourish that gets ignored. It's at the bottom of the food chain and they just cut your feet off and then they cut your legs off. You see, I want I know this is morbid, but I want to drive the point home. I want every portion of this body to be nourished. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just a select portion of it. I'm fine. They cut my legs off. I still have hands. No, my brother and sister, by the grace of God, we nourish every portion of the body of Christ and bringing it all into full subjection to the word that it's all healthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank the Lord for that. We can be completely healthy. Amen. Laying us up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal life. Now, unless I'm reading this incorrect, everything above this is connected to laying hold on eternal life. I've got the message. I believe the message. I believe every word of the message. I'm not going to help them get a better job, live on less, turn your thermometer down, you know, blah blah blah. I can't help it. They have no education. I can't. No, my brother and sister. You want to lay hold on eternal life. You're going to nourish the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, I'm not talking a welfare state. No, &gt;&gt; you're not going to buy a brand new car and call brother Paul to make the payments. &gt;&gt; Understand? Let's get that clear so nobody misunderstands me. But if you're in a situation, we're here. We're part of the body. If nothing else, as one brother told me one time, people come to me, "Brother, I have a need." Almost said his name. I have a need. And he's like, "I'll pray for your need." They were looking &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; for this And he says, "But the prophet of God says, the greatest thing I can do for you is to pray for you." &gt;&gt; Oh, puts it all in a balance while the same brother then went and made their house payment. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, let me get back on track. They may lay hold on eternal life. Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science. Even in those days there was some scientific evidence of things not happening or what it would be. Amen. So you look at that so-called which some professing have aired concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen. First of Timothy was written from Leodysia which is the chiefest city of some of those words I can't pronounce. So as you look at this my brother and sister, we see the encouragement that is given that we must lay hold on eternal life. Amen. So let's not be high-minded. Let's not trust in something uncertain. I trust in my own knowledge in certain things. I'll tell you a knowledge I trust in. If I lay my thumb on this counter and I hit it with a hammer, I can tell you it's going to hurt. You don't trust me? Come here. Yeah. See, we all can understand that level right there. But what would it be to you if in the service of the Lord your hand would be crushed and you felt no pain? Could you believe that &gt;&gt; that God would care so much? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Could you believe as it is in the fox's book that one could be burnt at the stake and praise God as the flames consume them? &gt;&gt; See, we serve a supernatural God. &gt;&gt; It's time to lay hold on eternal life that we could be fireproof &gt;&gt; in an age. Amen. Now, look at this. I need to hurry. Now, maybe I'm making this a little too fine of a line today, saints, but I see a difference myself between accepting and laying hold on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can say here today and say, "I believe the message. I believe the scripture. I believe &gt;&gt; accepting." &gt;&gt; That's it. Such a fine line right there because you can say, "No, I I've accepted." But to accept it means you fully receive it. &gt;&gt; That's it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't halfway accept. &gt;&gt; You know, thank you. Thank you for the fine gift, but I only want half of it. Do you have a saw? What kind of nonsense would that be? &gt;&gt; Right? The Lord's going to bless me, but I I'm not worthy of a full blessing, so I'm just going to accept a half of a blessing. &gt;&gt; Sounds ludicrous, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; But we do it all the time. &gt;&gt; We do it all the time, saints. I'm not being judgmental this morning. I want to stir up your pure minds in remembrance. We do it all the time. God promises great things &gt;&gt; going to raise us up in heavenly places. And we're satisfied just to overcome the last issue of our life. &gt;&gt; We're satisfied to overcome our struggle at work, our struggle in the family, our struggle with children, struggle with economics. We're we're satisfied if the Lord will just come give me a 25 cent an hour. I figured it out. If he gives me a 25 cent an hour raise, you know, I I can I can make this all work. Or you could fully accept the promise of God and commit yourself &gt;&gt; to that promise and then watch God bless you. That's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I could share story after story of people that have shared with me through the ages, through the years of how that they come to a moment in their life, and this is not a prosperity thing I'm talking about. It was a commitment thing. And they come to a place in their life and they're in desperation and they finally just was like, "Lord, I got to give this to you." and they give their whole circumstance to the Lord and in a matter of weeks it's completely reversed itself and they know they didn't fix it. God fixed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God was waiting. And you'll see here in a minute if Paul ever gets going. Amen. I'm glad I've got you warmed up for the service now. &gt;&gt; Now you see, look at this. If we have an intellectual understanding versus a real solid faith in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can understand in our mind that we're healed. But there's quite another when we come to the place that we accept absolute I'm healed in the name of Jesus Christ. This here is lying vanity. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This here, my brother and sister, is nothing more than a lying vanity. The word says. And when you can fully accept that the word is what is correct and not the lying vanity, then you're moving forward from just acknowledging the word says he's your healer. Amen. So there's a difference. Intellectual understanding versus real solid faith. Something makes sense versus all senses are surrendered to. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, that makes sense. How about you just surrender it all &gt;&gt; to that and let God fulfill that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A difference between acknowledgement and action. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, years ago, sorry, I don't mean to take so long, but years ago, we we had uh some guys uh come out to the farm and they were we were growing a specialty seedbean and the company wanted every last weed out of the field. So, we had a tractor with a a rack on the back and one of the one of the guys says, "Hey, I'll drive the tractor." And we're like, "You know how to drive a tractor?" "Yeah, I know how to drive a tractor. Anybody can drive a tractor." He goes, gets on the tractor. He started it. Does not push in the clutch. What's wrong with this tractor? You see, my brother and sister, just because you say you understand, &gt;&gt; doesn't mean you can put it into action. &gt;&gt; And it's no good to you until you can put it into action. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lay hold on eternal life. Yes. Yes. That's what I'm do. I believe the message. There's a lot of difference between believing the message and laying hold on eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Genesis 32:es 21-31. Uh, so we look at that. Um, we're now talking about Jacob to drive home a few points and and just pray the Lord will help me be very concise here. Um, so Jacob's there and and uh he's he's coming he's going home as it were. Amen. Just like we're going home. He's coming home. and uh he knows that he's done some things. His surppler nature has got him in a little bit of trouble. His own father-in-law, you know, threw the stick in the water, swindles him out of a a a bunch of cattle, uh the whole issue. But he had justification. Anybody votes for Jacob? Yeah. &gt;&gt; After all, he got deceived out of the girl he loved &gt;&gt; and had to marry her very pretty sister. But he didn't love that sister as much as he loved his wife. And so I'm justified to taking a sharp stick to my father-in-law because he deceived me. So I'm going to deceive him. They offended me so I can offend them. &gt;&gt; They did this to me so I can do this to them. &gt;&gt; Sound like a human thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let go of it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let go of it. &gt;&gt; So now he's moving. I want to just kind of preach this scripture out. Be on the screen there if you would, uh, Brother Isaac, and just scroll it forward. Now look at that. He comes and he's afraid that when he sees his brother that it's going to be trouble. He's already in his mind thinking he's going to, you know, take the women, young daughters, the animals. He's going to kill the young men. He's going to just do all this trouble. He He's going to get vengeance on me for what I did years ago. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to split my flock up here in these pieces and I'm going to start sending peace offerings to him. I'm going to I'm going to, you know, cuz after all, money fixes everything &gt;&gt; except relationships and friendships and spiritual relationships. &gt;&gt; Money won't work on those. &gt;&gt; And so, he's doing all this stuff and no peace comes. He's concerned. So, he's got his wife, he's got all of his his family, he's got all this stuff. And finally he's like, "Huh, he's coming closer and closer and closer. What am I going to do?" So he realizes, you know what? It's not my wife, not my children, not my handmmaids that he doesn't have any axe to grind with them. I'm going to separate them off. See how God works? He is doing the separating by a carnal reasoning. Understand? Vengeance. I'll separate myself and if he chooses to exert vengeance, it'll just be on me. Not upon my wife, not upon my children. God had another plan. Anybody had your plan and then God had his plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you love it that God's got a plan that's not absolutely connected to our plan? Our plan's got all this. Now, if I say this, they'll say this. If I do this, they'll do that. And then I'll do this, and I'll do that. And if they get rowdy, I if I get them in a headlock first. Yeah. And then they'll be like, I just wanted to come talk to you. Oh. Oh, you wanted to have a Bible study with me and just, "Yeah, I realized I was wrong. You thought you were wrong. I knew I was wrong, but you think you're wrong. No. Don't let the devil get in your head. Okay? &gt;&gt; There shouldn't be four or five rooms in your head. Amen. Should be just one space. Your brain God so possesses that. So it comes, they all go. Jacob's alone. Do you see it? God wants us alone. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Doesn't want a crowd. &gt;&gt; Doesn't need you and the pastor. &gt;&gt; Doesn't need you and the husband or wife or best friend. Doesn't need you and the theologian or the smartest person you ever went to school with. Doesn't need you with anybody. He wants you alone. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And so here he is. Poor old Jacob, man. He's going in this throws he's just oh what am I going to do and here is an individual comes there and however it comes about they get in a wrestling match and something we would call it revelation starts to come and so he sends them verse 23 over the brook and they go he's left alone and there at that place he wrestles with a man until the breaking of the day now this is quite a wrestling match it's like why is he anointed to wrestle with this. My brother and sister, we should all have spiritual discernment to understand why the wrestling match took place. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it wasn't collective. He had no Amen. Now, Jacob would have had his own group of strong young men that were willing to fight, but he had sent them away with the peace offering. &gt;&gt; He had all these people that would have stood up for Jacob. He's justified. Don't you get your hands off it. They were all sent away. There was no sorry sisters, no wives to say, "Leave my husband alone by himself." And here comes an angel of the Lord comes down and he starts to wrestle with him. Well, I pray every day. I try to at least give the Lord a couple minutes. Break in a pie chart. be a little line. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that will be your day. No, my brother and sister, you see, he wrestles all night long. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This was a real travail, a real struggle that he was in. He wrestles all night long. So much so, the angel says, "Hey, uh the breaking of the day and and when he sees, you know, that he uh uh is not going to prevail." Now, pardon me. There's different uh different uh opinions on exactly what it was, but the angel touches him here in the hip or groin region and he is immediately crippled. &gt;&gt; So, when he touches him, he immediately is now at a handicap and it should be time to say uncle and and be done. But Jacob is now, you see what's happening, my brother and sister? He's moving from the suppler to the one who has met God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And when he got determined to meet God, he was no longer the give up easy kind of person. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I tried serving God. I prayed that the Lord would do this and the Lord would do that and he didn't do it. So, I just quit. I don't even know if there is a God. I couldn't tell you. I've got a list of people who have told me such that I tried to serve God, but he never answered my prayer. He never answered it like you wanted it answered. He never answered it in the timing that you wanted it be like. Lord, let it be yesterday. Amen. And let it be just like this, this, and this. But look at Jacob now. Still Jacob at this moment. His name is Serpliner, but he's losing that. It's falling away from him. the challenge and the care of life and the struggle is falling away from him and he's coming to a place I want God to bless me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen this morning? I want God to bless me &gt;&gt; and I'm going to keep holding on. I'm going to keep wrestling until he blesses me. And the angel of the Lord touches him there and his thigh is growing and he's now crippled. That is something he carried the rest of his life. the rest of his life in a physical element. He had a He walked with this limp, my brother and sister. And when that took place and he did not give up, the angel come. Amen. And he said unto him, "What is thy name?" And he said, "Jacob." And he said, "Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel, for as a prince hath power with God and with men, and hast prevailed." Amen. And what did God do? He come and he gave him a new name. Now, I'm not making a doctrine, so nobody misunderstand me here, but the scripture in Revelation says that we'll be given a new name. And I'm telling you, if you make a connection through scripture, it's only going to be those that wrestled with the angel all night long that are going to get a new name. It's not going to be the guy. I believe I believe I believe my brother and sister, you're going to have to get a hold of the angel of the Lord, the word. And you're going to have to wrestle all the way through. And when you prevail, not when you say, "I tried." Not when you say, "It's too hard. Not when you say, "I don't understand." Pray for revelation. Amen. You pray for revelation. God will give you revelation. But he prays. Amen. He's holding on to this angel wrestling. Amen. Probably trying to remember now. He's got a hold of me this way. If I can get my hand slipped around like this, I can get him into this and I can do that. And it just go went on and on and on and on and on and it's there, my brother and sister. Or was it the kind of wrestling we think? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; We have it. An angel and a grown man wallowing in the dirt. Well, praise God. I known a few men in the past stood me right in the foyer of a church and said, "I should break your knee." And why would you do that? Cuz you don't agree with our pastor. At least till I can get out the door, I'm going to agree. Okay. No. Is that the right spirit? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Wrong motive, wrong objective, wrong presentation. Now, you wonder why I bring that up. I want to tie this around. You're going to take that 25, 30, 40 years ago. Deacon representing the pastor said, "I'm going to break your leg for you, your knee for you. It's why I don't go to church anymore. Really? You're going to let one knad? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Keep you from laying hold on eternal life. &gt;&gt; One absolutely anointed of the devil individual was all Satan had to insert. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Into your life. And you're done. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If there's a counterfeit out there, there's true. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. If someone with the wrong spirit approaches you and they are rude and they are mean and they are all these things that we just &gt;&gt; forget that. Let go. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Go start searching. Lord, &gt;&gt; if there's a counterfeit here, where's the real, Lord? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a real here. Show me the real. There's a real word out here. If there's a false word out here, there's a real word out here, Lord. And I'm going to lay hands lay holds on eternal life. Point me to the real. Give me an angel. Give me a representation. You see what that angel was? He wasn't there of his own accord. He was a scent emissary of God himself. So you understand this when it says that Jacob met God face to face and live. You see that angel was an absolute living representation just the same as this Bible is a living representation of Jesus Christ today. Amen. When you get in this word and you pray for revelation and God speaks to you, you can actually make the statement, I've met God face to face. I met him right here in his word. And this is him in his word. It's not an interpretation. It's not an abstract something that was presented. It is him himself. Which means if you believe this, you believe him. And when you speak to the word, Amen. the word speaks back to you. Can someone say amen? And we know that that is God speaking to us. It's not a preacher. It's not this man or not that man. It's God speaking to you. &gt;&gt; If you look only as far as a man, you will see men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the problem. You look just as far and it goes right down into our relationships, marriages, and friendships and everything. If all you see is what's wrong, that's all you will see. that if you'll look beyond that and let go and say, "Lord, come and fix my situation." And then look what followed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jacob now goes and meets Esau. And he comes to him a humbled man. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; No longer walking like the bandy rooster, &gt;&gt; but he comes. &gt;&gt; Something changed in Esau. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had compassion. &gt;&gt; He had understanding. Because you see, God dealt with Esau &gt;&gt; while he was dealing with Jacob. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I knew a brother. He said, "I I got to the point I hated to go to work." He said, "I was like a little kid having a nervous breakdown on a day for testing at school." And he said, "Lord, there's no other jobs. I mean, like, there's zero jobs around here. If I leave this job, I'm unemployed. Lord, what do I do? No praise to the pastor, but a pastor's there on a Sunday and drives home. You need to change your situation. Tell me about it, but expect God to answer your prayer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's okay, right? Sympathetic ear here, &gt;&gt; but the only thing that's going to change your circumstance is God. &gt;&gt; That's it. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; He gets to praying about it. And then one day, the same man who's persecuting him comes and says, "Remember that time you tried to give me that book of your religion, he's on the defense." Yeah. Well, what about it? I finally read it. Can I get more? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I read the other books you gave me. Can I come to your church? I come to your church a few times. You think somebody like me that your pastor would baptize them? &gt;&gt; Do you think someone like me could actually receive the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; My brother and sister or we can fight fire with fire &gt;&gt; and we can declare that the guy is just a devil. How come you guys are so quiet? &gt;&gt; You don't look sleepy. &gt;&gt; What are we doing? Do you realize that when you lay hold on eternal life? &gt;&gt; Of all the people in this room that should know, Brother Luke would know cuz he works with high voltage. Brother Luke, what happens if I come down here and you are 440 and I grab you? &gt;&gt; Yes. Can I Can I? And the only smoke coming out of my ears is my brain cooking and I can't let go. Do you realize what God's doing? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you get a hold of eternal life and then God leads you to reach out and get a hold of someone, what do you do? You become a conduit. It's not you. &gt;&gt; You get a hold of eternal life. God might be using you. You'll receive your reward. Let's forget about this pay me in advance thing. &gt;&gt; You know, Lord, do you do you do Vimo or whatever that is? No. But I want to be a conduit. I'll tell you right now, my brother and sister, I'm speaking from my heart. I don't want to stand here. I don't need recognition. I don't need accolades. I don't need nothing. But I want to be a conduit. I want to be a conduit to each one of you, especially young people. my heart. I want to be a conduit, but I can't be a conduit if I don't have a halt of anything. &gt;&gt; But if I ever get a hold of Jesus Christ, I can be a conduit. He can work through me. &gt;&gt; And then I have nothing to boast &gt;&gt; other than to say, "Thank you, Lord, that &gt;&gt; you saw fit to use me." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And to be able to help someone else see. &gt;&gt; That's right. You see my brother and sister. I want to close right here. Sister Vika, would you come? Otherwise, I got equivalent about two or three more pages here. And uh so you be no more called Jacob, but Israel. Amen. I want to know someday it'll be revealed what our new name is. We can speculate here. We can say it's going to be Jesus Christ, Mrs. Jesus Christ. We can put all kinds of different things. But I tell you what I want to do. I want to hear him say &gt;&gt; my new name. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to hear him declare to me what my new name is. So to do that, I've got to lay hold on eternal life to make it there to be that one to do. And you know, sometimes we'll find out that we had more impact on someone than we ever dreamed we would. Another little story I'll share with you. Back east, there was a minister, small church, I think I have it tough sometimes working, but this pastor worked the graveyard shift in a sighting vinyl sighting factory. He worked he chose the graveyard shift because that allowed him to preach Sundays and Wednesdays and he went in at I don't know it was like 11:00 at night. So, he didn't certainly have any long Wednesday night services, but you know what I mean? He he just, you know, but he'd preach and then he'd just go home and go to work. And he worked with this man. And uh they're working at this station making sure the machine didn't clog up, just spitting out sheets of vinyl siding. It's pretty much your job. You stood there like that all night long and washed the siding. [Music] And this man, he asked this guy working with him, "Are you a Christian?" And the guy told him, "If I want to talk religion, I would talk religion. I don't want to hear it." That ain't what I ask you. I ask you if you were a Christian. No, I'm not a Christian. Well, I'm not going to tell you what you should do, but you should be. &gt;&gt; Don't you just love how God gives a boldness to him? Six months of that. Now I get to hear the other side. Huh? So it gives away the story. The other brother has hands like dinner plates. And he said, "I can't tell you how many times about 2:00 in the morning, I wanted to reach over and grab that guy by the neck and just throttle him." But there was something that wouldn't let me. And there was something told me this is true. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And what it was, he just wore me down. He wore me down until I was like, "Okay, if you got something special, then tell me why it's special." And he starts preaching to him. And he said, "And now the minister brother says, "Oh, you'd be surprised how quick an 8 hour shift can go when you're preaching. You guys are like, "That was a two-hour service." And the preacher's like, "Where did that 10 minutes go?" Ultimately, he gives his heart to the Lord. Now, my brother and sister, there is the conduit. One has laid hold on eternal life, and he's looking for someone else that he can pass it through. Pass it to. Now, I want to know Jacob becoming Israel. God blessed, right? That's what the word says. I'm closing. and he walked with a the rest of his life. &gt;&gt; Who wants that kind of blessing? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's what it took &gt;&gt; for Jacob to receive the blessing he was looking for. &gt;&gt; When God touched him, it left him marked forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, just bless my bank account. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Just bless my deal. Bless this. Bless that. No, I don't want to have to give up what I've got. Just bless me. &gt;&gt; But God would like something in exchange. Now, don't misunderstand what I'm saying. He just wants you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's your sacrifice. He just wants you. Amen. I want I want that kind of blessing. Amen. Hallelujah. Let me beat you to the punch. Oh, I didn't. Okay, man. I've got so much more here, saints. I tell you, I would just love to share it this morning. But someday I'll actually I'll actually be able to stay in high gear and not get distracted. Let's stand. Worship the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. You love the Lord today. &gt;&gt; Just like to hear it out of your voice. Yes, we do. Amen. Hallelujah. [Music] When Jacob met the Lord upon that lonely night and wrestled there alone until the morning light, he won a princely title to gird him for the right. I want that kind of blessing. Oh, I want I want that kind of blessing that saves and keeps. Oh, satisfies the soul. I want I want &gt;&gt; salvation to &gt;&gt; of heaven war. Israel at last came into Canaan's land. The Lord his riches gave so full on every hand. He drove their foes before them and dwelt a happy band. I want that kind of blessing. I want I want that kind of blessing that saves and keeps and satisfies my soul. I want I want that full salvation till of heaven or me roll. This is the day of grace. The comforter is here. We are a chosen race. Our God is drawing near. He's waiting to be gracious. The prayer of faith to hear and then he'll send the blessing. Oh, I want I want that kind of blessing that saves and keeps. Oh, satisfies the soul. I want I want of salvation till the lose of heaven or me. Hallelujah. Now I'd like to put something out to you. You got a loved one, husband, a wife, a child, a parent that's not serving God. Got something in their life. Got addictions. We got witness right here in this assembly of God taking addictions away in a heartbeat. Amen. We've got right here in this assembly the witness of God coming and delivering from spirits and things that are taking place. And now my brother and sister, you got a loved one, you want to see them saved. Don't let go. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's exactly. &gt;&gt; Don't let go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I pray for them occasionally. &gt;&gt; I pray for them a little bit. My brother and sister, Jacob could have stopped and said, "U, let's take a break here. I'm tired. I've heard so many, now this might bite some of you, but I've heard so many people say, "I can't do this and this for the Lord because I just don't have the strength." I want to ask you, have you prayed for strength? God will answer your prayer when you will pray for strength. Amen. You need healing. Don't just say, "Well, my symptoms are worse today than they were yesterday." My brother and sister, do not let go. God said, "I've healed you. You believe it. Amen. You claim it. You stand on that." And I tell you, my brother and sister, these many things that Satan has used to bind us will fall away if we will come in real faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. This is the day of grace. We earth is going near. He's wanting to be gracious. The prayer of faith to hear and then he'll send the blessing. Let's sing that whole verse. Go back. This is the day of grace. The comforter is here. We are a chosen race. Our God is drawing near. He's waiting to be gracious to hear the he'll send a blessing. I want my kind of blessing that seeks and keeps or satisfies my soul. I want I want at full salvation tillers of heaven all the earth. Can we just give a little praise offering to the Lord? Hallelujah. Lord, help us. Hallelujah. Help us, Lord, to just let go. Get everything out of our hands. Be able to lay hold on eternal life. Hallelujah. 8:35 if you would, Brother Isaac. Hallelujah. Amen. F. Holy words, long prisoner [Music] for our walk in this world. They resound with God's own heart. Oh, let the word of God impart. Words of life, words of hope. Oh, give us strength. Help us close in this world where we're on the world. Oh, thank you Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. The word of God ever true changing me and changing you. Oh we have come with open hearts. Oh, let the word of God impart. Holy words of our faith handed down to this age. Come to us through sacrifice. Oh, look at that. The faithful words of Christ. Holy words long preserve for our walk in this world. They resound with God's own heart. Let the word of God impart. Word of God. Oh, believe it saints. Changing me. He's changing you. We have come with hearts. Let the word of God impart. Word of God ever true changing me. He's changing you. Oh, we have come with open hearts. Oh, let the word of God above all. Amen. Verse one. Holy words long preserved for our walk in this world. laying sound with God's own heart. Oh, let the word of God in part. Look at this. Words of life, words of hope. Give us strength. Oh Lord, help us go home. In this world where we're wrong, a word of God will guide us home. All words of life, words of hope, changing me, changing you will arise. Oh, let the word of God. [Music] That's all right. Hallelujah. Amen. They didn't read my mind. Hallelujah. Saints, I pray today maybe something just touched your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's time for us to let go of every little petty thing Satan's placed in our way. We're human. Don't think that I'm judging you. We're human. But let's not be the little raccoon that just won't let go of it. Let it go. You see, I don't mean to go on preaching, but you see what Satan's doing. When we take a halt of these things and we can't let go of them, our spiritual growth stops right there. Cuz that little will starve to death over that shiny little lid. His growth stopped right there. Let go and let God have his way in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Understand? I just study and brother Brandham speaks about this. some spots direct, some spots in reference. But that's what Satan's job is to stop you from feeding on the word of God, &gt;&gt; to stop you from growing spiritually. He'll do anything he can do &gt;&gt; to get you to stop, &gt;&gt; to come to a standill. &gt;&gt; That's it. If I could plead with you, if that's too strong a words, if I could ask you emphatically, let go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And take hold. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; On eternal life. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; we love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Lord, help us to conquer this human side, to let go of everything that keeps us from laying hold on eternal life. Lord, come. So many things. We are so complex Lord. But you being the one who created us, you know how to take those complexes, the complexity of the human nature and to take those things from bad and turn it to good. To take those things that would hinder and bring it to us for a great spurt of spiritual growth. Lord, I lift my own hands. Father, help me. Lord, let go of myself and cling only to you. Lord, deal kindly, Father, just as you discern the heart of the rich young ruler. Lord, may you come and discern our hearts and speak to us the words of life, words of encouragement, words of hope. for your word has long been preserved and restored back to its original condition for us in this day. We ask this from the deepest of our heart. Lord, grant to us, Father, the Saints of Grace tabernacle, a time, not a a limited time, but a time of spiritual growth. Father, as we lay hold on his eternal life and we let go of this world, bless the saints and their patience today. Lord, I pray be with them, lead them, guide them. Father, I would be so bold to say, Father, please Lord, directly lay upon their hearts those things that need let go of and bring healing and restoration in every one of our lives in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. Oh, thank you Lord for saving my soul. Thank you Lord all for making me whole. Thank you Lord for giving to me. Thy grace salvation so rich and free. I want to thank you Lord for saving my soul. Oh, thank you Lord for making me whole. Thank you Lord for giving to me. Oh thy grace salvation so rich and free. God bless you saints. Amen. [Music] Oh, Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Mhm. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Thank you. [Music]
