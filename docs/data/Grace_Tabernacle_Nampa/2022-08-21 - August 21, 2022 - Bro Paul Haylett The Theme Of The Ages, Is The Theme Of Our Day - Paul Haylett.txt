school today and if i'm still winded the kids wore me out i need to go to training again cardio but uh it was so cute helena she goes i've got a song i said what is it just the names of songs that's a good song and so we sing that song she goes i have another song i said that's a great song how do you know all these songs i've done sunday school before it's like perfect you can help me sing but parents we are going to start and we start at 10 o'clock today we're gonna start how we've done before quarter to nine now that's sorry no quarter nine's better chris is like amen i get my old sermon out quarter to ten quarter ten so nine forty five now you don't want to be that parent where your kids come in at 9 45 that's when we start so please have your children on time and in their seats at 9 45 because time is very precious so i think i've made that pretty clear and uh so that's that's all i need i think we need to say about that amen well i'd like to like to try an old hymn as we get ready to turn the service to brother paul number 623 god leads us along amen in shady green pastures so rich and so sweet god leads his dear children along where the water could flow based away from one's feet god leads his dear children along some through the waters some through the flood some through the fire but all through the blood some through great sorrow but god gives a song in the night season and all the day long sometimes on the mount where the sun shines so bright god leads his dear children along sometimes in the valley in darkness of night god leads his dear children along some [Music] but all through the blood some through great sorrow but god gives a song in the night season and all the day long [Music] sorrows befall us and say to of course god leads his dear children along through grace we can conquer defeat all our foes god leads his dear children along who [Music] but all through the blood great sorrow but god gives a song in the night season and all the day long away from the mire away from the clay god leads his dear children along a way up in glory eternity's day god leads his dear children along [Music] through great sorrow but god gives a song in the night season and all the day long hallelujah amen how many have been through the water lately amen amen you know the water is always what's necessary to create the flood but did you know if you'll go back and study through this scripture god has always used water coming out of egypt the very first challenge israel had was water but the deliverance and also the test in the middle of the wilderness you know if we could have picked any other name saints for the age we live in we are definitely traveling through the wilderness of sin and in the middle of the wilderness of sin a test that judged moses unfortunately had to do with water and a deliverance to the people was the very water that brought the test to moses floods are necessary the waters are necessary and water represents also spirit amen and we need to get in the water of the word the water of the presence of almighty god amen well i might not mention it but i have to say that uh this song uh just goes right along let's just stand and let's just dive into the word this morning just have quite a bit i want to share with you and um you know i you kind of read things sometimes and it spurs little thoughts in your mind and amen uh actually don't preach very long saints i know some of you think i'm a long-winded preacher but i really don't preach that long it's the unzipping of the word that takes so much time what i actually give to you is very condensed it's just the unzipping amen and you know your computer people all know what a zip file is you don't slip it in push the button and pull it back out you have to leave it for a while and so anyway i want to speak to you this morning on our position of strength once again because you see through the scripture there is many things our position of strength is not just one given thing that we can step into that position and say now i've got strength but there's many things that make up uh our position amen and i want to speak to you on a thought today the theme of the ages is the theme of our day and uh so as we'll just dive into this i would like for you to turn in the book of revelation to the second chapter and it will only take you a minute to catch uh the thought that we are are carrying forward as we go through this today now as we look at this these are several on the same page here we'll start in revelations the second chapter verse 11. now we know that this is in this scripture giving us the breakdown of the spirit and condition of the seven church ages and our young people having gone through the seven church ages i hope this rings very clear to them starting with revelations the second chapter verse 11 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death amen i'm telling you gives us motivation my brother and sister because the second death is spiritual death so it gives us motivation to be an overcomer amen let's turn down the page a little bit to revelations the second chapter verse 17. now we started off right there in the smyrnan church age now we're going to go into pergamus and we're going to find a continuity he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a white stone and in a stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it now people have turned this my brother and sister into a great mystery whole doctrines concerning the white stone and by god's grace maybe we'll be able to dig into that in another day to realize the outer simplicity of what it is to be there of what the white stone is and the new name now my brother and sister we could say oh this is too mysterious we can do without it well that might be fine but by god's grace we can come in and we can see what the prophet of god said and the corresponding scriptures that tie with that that touch these things that we won't set here in an ooh and in awe and walk away saying that's above my head you're the bride of christ can we say amen amen and he said that the mystery would be revealed so this is the bridegroom coming not bringing a secret into the marriage but the bride wants to know who her bridegroom is amen she doesn't just say well it's fine i want to be a christian she wants to know him and in fact that desire to know him causes her to move above and beyond what the rest of the world even has desire to participate in amen so now we've touched pergamos we'll go to thytyra and we'll see here in verse 26 and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations now we want to continue on in the third chapter verse 5 now as we look at this we'll look at this my brother and sister as it is that sardis each age had its very peculiar things that took place and in that we'll find that every one of them will will have a significant impact because you see this seventh age is a collection of the spirits of all the ages the catch-all you might say of the spirits of all the ages but it's also the catch-hall of the revelation of jesus christ our day so sardis was a time that it was their start of a great struggle this is a time that dark ages the spirit of the antichrist is gaining momentum gaining more and more control moving forward he says he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and we understand what happens when people turn away from the word of god god said i will blot their name out and he says and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life so something was there that was keeping these people in the good will if you had put it that way of god they had no fear of being blotted out of the book a trying time you know i just read yesterday the prophet of god somebody wrote him a question but i failed god so many times and the prophet of god i'll just paraphrase it to you he says if you are a son or daughter of god without seed in you you cannot fail god too many times i'll tell you what that just makes me really happy no we're not looking to just go live any all kind of life but somehow things just come face to face with you but i will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that overcometh verse 12 said he that overcometh here dealing with the philadelphian church age an age of enlightenment an opening of the word he says he that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god in the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name and once again people have taken that and made a doctrine that if you don't know what your new name is you're not really saved but my brother and sister now is not the time to delve into it once again though can we say we serve a god of simplicity not a god of complexity you know one time just trying to drive a point home speaking to the church some of you might remember i said now brother branham preached in the sermon god in complexity and i said that just trying to drive a point home but some of you are like and then you're like no see it's not a god of complexity it's a god of simplicity a god of simplicity that saves little girls like our sister vanessa saves those that are ready to cross over to the other side remember on the curtain beyond the curtain that little old lady holy spirit speaks to brother branham she got saved in her 90s but there she is on the other side in the vitality of youth oh i think i can serve a god amen that cares about me no matter where i'm at what age or my circumstance and now in laodicea verse 21 he said to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his in his throne heavenly father we thank you just ask your father open your word to us this morning lord just thinking of my brother jason's prayer in the back father how he prayed that lord you would even open my eyes as i speak these words this morning to see more than i thought i saw to seek speak more lord than than our studies or what our ideas have been and father i fully grasp that lord let our eyes be opened let our hearts be opened this morning lord father we want to receive you father not in portion but in the fullness of who you are father we come not as just a church but we come as your bride and we come today to be partakers of your word now lord reveal to us and speak to us we ask in the precious name of jesus christ amen you may be seated saints as we look today we see that being an overcomer or overcometh a common theme throughout the new testament now it is there my brother and sister that um we'll recognize that the overcomer uh in this hour scripture declares that the overcomer will see who jesus christ is they'll see him in his fullness see him in his power in his majesty and we know by the word of god that we will not be able to declare jesus the christ without the holy ghost and i say thank you lord that we could today declare jesus the christ amen it's not just a historical although we'll have a quote here in a little bit lord willing that kind of touches on that but this common theme now sometimes my brother and sister we we like to follow or catch the theme or the continuity of something that is preached and you'll see sometimes as you go down through the sermons that brother branham preached you'll find a continuity that carries one to the next and so it does pay as it were to follow that theme or follow that continuity because it's being built upon and so we often times you know see that uh we have maybe little distractions visiting ministers etc as as a minister i i like to be able to follow a continuity for for you know a certain period of time i heard a brother recently say no sermon is a single sermon in its own they're always connected there's always something that's tying it all together now uh we know that uh to overcome i i use these words here out of webster online to overcome overcometh is to win to conquer defeat or take control so as you look at that as we'll take my brother and sister back through all of these scriptures here in revelation i want you to apply those thoughts in other words of seven church ages god declared there was always a winner aren't you glad today we've been declared by the word of god to be winners amen and in that it's also there's conquerors now it's hard sometimes for people to grasp that you realize in the whole time of uh the roman empire uh christians being persecuted and uh being put to death uh throw to the lions throat from cliffs all of the things won't get into all of that uh sometimes it just kind of makes you shiver just a little bit to think about that and imagine in the minds of those roman leaders that they actually were the ones defeated the spirit of antichrist anti-god that was in them they thought they were the conquerors they thought they were the the the overcomer as it were the mighty men but in reality they had been conquered they had been defeated as you'll see as it was you know when the magi were coming and we see that spirit imagine it's the same spirit today only today they call it abortion and that day herod sent out to kill all of the children because there will be a seed somewhere a child somewhere that would serve god i'm speaking of our day and this anointing in the day that we live in is the same devil that was there in israel at the time of the coming of christ and so it's there wanting to kill every seed that they can kill but what they don't realize is god's ordained the seed to life and they are not capable of killing the seed can i hear an amen about that amen satan's tried to kill the seed in you he's tried to defeat you believing by defeating you he can do away with the seed but my brother and sister we are winners we're conquerors we have defeated our foe and we have taken control and you say but brother paul i still have troubles no you're here fighting that is a part of the flood the water that you must call to push through the things that you are called to overcome but you see we are not defeated until we have quit a synonym of conquer is to vanquish to defeat completely in war a battle to overcome in battle subdue completely to defeat in a conflict or a contest to gain mastery over i like this an emotion a passion a temptation you see my brother and sister it didn't save i got saved and now i instantly did this you will have to conquer the passion you will have to conquer the emotion you will have to conquer the temptation but god already declared us more than conquerors he already declared us victorious amen i want you to catch that my brother and sister oh it ought to just stir our heart to realize that when jesus on the cross said it is finished that he laid the groundwork that you and i can look to that and say regardless of what is my present circumstance now my brother and sister i think it's the very nature of humanity we wouldn't today want to have our thoughts or uh what's troubling us uh put upon the screen it would be embarrassing it would shame us we we would be uncomfortable or beyond that we would just simply shrivel up but god said you've already defeated that god already said that's un that's behind you you've conquered this and so we would be there in the realm of our own mind the troubles that we go through the thoughts that go through your mind in the middle of the night maybe the devil having anointed you to be troubled over a child might be troubled over a circumstance but what we got to do is rise up and say satan get behind me because i'm already conquering that and the devil will come and say i don't see it but the devil never did see revelation our victory is revelation my brother and sister because if you go by reality there's not too many victorious amongst us if we're willing to admit it but by revelation we can look to this and say you know what what bound me almost in complete control years ago oh the devil's still back scratching at the door you know sister nadia not throwing you under the bus but sister nadia gave us a cat a kitten years ago and it it's not sister nadia's fault but somehow our cat was anointed to climb to heavenly places whether it be the curtains the furniture the door jamb our cat liked being up there just a little higher than all the rest my brother and sister the cat's not cured the cat's not cured something in that cat likes to climb and you know cats are interesting the cat as you hear something and open the front door and the cat's looking you right in the eyes i actually had a moment of fear what does this cat desire to do to me does it want to scratch me or was it just getting up to my level so it could express its defiance i don't know come around our house almost every door jam on the exterior of our house has been marked by the cat you know you see it in the mountains written on a rock bob was here that's our cat that's what the devil's trying to do in our lives he's trying to leave that mark that says i was here hmm i'm glad god's not taking this flesh i'm glad that we can come enter in into this spirit of peace enter into his presence and all the cat scratch will get covered up no god leaves some of these things in her life as a reminder of what not to do and where not to go you know what it's hard to say thank you lord that we can remember the things we've done those things we were ashamed to have put on the screen but thank you lord that it reminds me of where i am not going to go back to i have found victory now my brother and sister we're not speaking of us of ourself but we're speaking of the grace of god and we will touch on that amen so we look at this a synonym of of vanquish vanquish is connected to conquer amen and conquer my brother and sister is not a half-hearted effort this is not a partial deliverance this is not a partial liberty amen the scripture says he who is free is free indeed can we say that together he who is free is free indeed amen not in a partiality not in just a symbolism not in a little bit my brother and sister but a complete liberty we ought to claim that this morning if the devil's tormenting you over something today i would ask you in your heart or even with a lifted hand to say lord i am free am i am not just here hoping it's not a vision of something way off in the far far horizon but i'm standing here today by the word to declare it is finished in my life i've been set free and i'm going to take what you've given me lord and i'm going to build upon that come on saints we weren't called to pack a shovel with us you say what's that got to do what's i got to do brother paul packing a shovel because some are anointed to bury their talent hey that that's actually a really good point isn't it brother jason some of you actually have some of you actually have talents come on be bold i wasn't thinking of talent that way i was thinking of the gift of god we bury it you know i don't want anybody at school young people you're in school i am ashamed to admit i did most everything i could do not to look too religious in school get on the school bus with my hair combed back see you mom get on the bus sit down stop sign comes in the door closes shirt come untucked pants oh this is not new pants pulled down get off the bus at school i'd be cool on the bus ride home turned on our road come on come on that's not a vanquished enemy at best that's a truce until that spirit overcome me and then i didn't care what my parents thought fight them over a haircut fight them over the way i wore my clothes spirit of rebellion boy i would to god that i'd had a revelation of that day to uprooted that spirit when it first got on me uprooted that when it still had no control over my life interesting you've got to be 60 years old in my case to understand fully the value of being a conqueror amen now hebrews 4 and one we got a break in the same chapter chapter four one and two says let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it so they heard the word of god and found no prophet in it my brother and sister but i would like to present to you today that we should put ourselves as it would be as sons and daughters of god in a position to profit from hearing the word of god not simply to come to church because parents make us do that not simply just doing this because it's convenient or it seems to be expedient but let us do this in the sense my brother and sister that for personal profit come on that almost sounds like you have a motive i do have a motive my brother and sister do you realize everyone has a motive you sitting here this morning have a motive but what are you going to do with this word is it going to come to you with no profit or is it going to be profitable to you and to be profitable you have to mix it with faith now it never gave us the amount of faith you have to have to mix it with it come on i want you to think about that how many of you say well if i was going to pray for healing for someone or deliverance for someone i must have a great great degree of faith for a prayer to be answered my brother and sister no what you got to do is take your burden and your desire what god has laid on your heart mix it with what faith you have and put it forth to the throne of almighty god don't wait until you feel like you are spiritually superior and up on the mountaintop for some of you that means you wouldn't plan on having a prayer answered sometimes for years come on let's be let's be honest brother donny reagan put it this way one time he said mothers with all the little babies spend a good portion of their early life backslid sounds like an indictment doesn't it but he said you notice every time that the word gets real intense the babies start to cry it's the devil drawing a mother's attention from the word to deal with a baby of course then brother donnie also said and you mothers who pinch your baby when the word starts coming now look at this let's jump down to verse 14 seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities see that's the spirit the devil's throwing on the earth today that god's this impassive grandfather sitting in the heavens somewhere that doesn't care and so if i i'm not going to serve a god like that well my brother and sister i happen to know that my god hears my prayers and he sees my infirmities can someone say amen to that amen so it's there we're going to hold fast our profession because just because we think god is absent i didn't say he was absent we think he is amen and he doesn't really care about our infirmities the devil will come down but you know sometimes we ought to be careful well we'll go praying well this is happening to brothers so and so sister so and so this family right here and we go to praying for their deliverance not realizing that god's allowed them to come into that position to move them you've heard me many times say this you know we're singing uh i shall not be moves many of you are in your heart singing this from the depths of your heart the devil's not going to move me off the word but then there's that one with the spirit of rebellion he's also singing i shall not be moved amen and no matter what is preached and what anointing flows through the building they're there they're not going to be moved they like their attitude they like their life they don't want nothing changed and it's there you wonder why are they here i used to believe that surely god had an exemption when it comes to three kinds of believers i was determined in my mind that grace tabernacle was free of that spirit but you see those spirits come and go and i'm not talking about as where individuals come and go but the spirit itself coming in that we can come now i hope you don't struggle over this but we can come to church we i'm talking about you and i are we here you and i are here and we can come to church with the spirit of an unbeliever and we can come to church and we want to call it pitchfork religion i would like to get norman rockwell to paint that picture imagine coming to the front row it's not for me are you ready gabriella amen it's not for me today i know this must be for gabriella so i'm just going to gather up gather up but did you realize those of you who used a pitchfork extensively a little bit is lost along the way so even in pitchfork religion there's the portion that we can't pass along oh i pray lord don't let us get even pitchfork religion just give me the full word give me the life of this give me give me a spirit lord of repentance and so we have a high priest that that feels our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin we can read that we can hear that preach you know our lord jesus was tempted what's wrong with you my brother and sister he planned it that way he said i am going to overcome not as an overcomer to condemn you but in life to show you it is possible it is there that you are able to take a hold of this word live this word believe this word profess this word and it will move you now look this whole thing of being perfect my brother and sister do you realize god is moving us by the word into perfection but this flesh there's no promise in the word that this flesh will be perfected god's not dealing in the flesh if he was oh no one be offended please if he was dealing in the flesh most of us wouldn't pass the flesh test we're not smart enough we're not good looking enough we're not slim and trim or athletic or this or that enough god didn't do a flesh test what he said is i'll plant this in your heart and you give this now saints you will bring the flesh under subjection to the word it will be you that decides what you do with this flesh it will not be as it were the church or a great minister not even a prophet but it will be you allowing the word to come to life and bring forth a conquering power in our own life what did the prophet say he said you create the atmosphere i will paraphrase this that you live in nobody else does well the preacher he said this and it just made me angry no you made you angry now it might be the preacher made you angry if he come down off the deal and slapped you some people say well i think it's obvious that they were preaching to me yeah well you know what my brother and sister i don't care if the preacher's standing on your toes and you would be there it's up to you to decide what am i going to do with this word do i repent from this word do i say forgive me lord do i get angry do i get bitter what do i do and no one will decide that but you oh hallelujah help me lord verse 16 let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need now i just want to bring to you just reference out of the sermon elijah brother brown preached this in 10 18 53 just making a reference he says oh father dear such a tremendous time we're living in the greatest time of all the ages i want you to think about as saints we're not living in the dismal of times you can look at this we can talk about the devil talk about how much power the devil has in our life how we are not able i just can't seem to live i can't live this life i'm a teenager it's too hard i'm a young adult it's too hard i'm young married whatever it's too hard no my brother and sister you see we are living in a tremendous time the greatest time of all the ages so don't let satan come and rob you with the idea that we're not up to the day we're living in it it is there clearly clearly placed before us that we can do this in our lord jesus he overcome by suffering we like to skip that part don't we and our lord jesus he was just an overcomer he come to conquer the devil but you realize he suffered along the way there that that body was man that body was flesh my brother and sister that body suffered reminds me of a brother in the message i mentioned something to him see how the flesh can be acclimatized i was talking to this brother and i said brother you ought to come and preach for us he said brother paul i'll come and preach for you and a heartbeat of course he let me know his schedule was pretty full for this year he said i come and preach free in a heartbeat just as long as it's hot when i get there i'm standing there looking him in the face with sweat dripping off my nose and thinking why would anyone like hot i think i'm going to invent a shoulder mounted air conditioner you know has its own little duck blowing on your head but you see i'm there suffering in the heat and he's thinking about what it would be like if it's cold suffering he wants heat i would prefer as it would be not ice cold but colder because the reason i say that is he said well i don't do well in anything below 60 degrees and i thought 60 degrees is perfect yeah i didn't get a single amen we're living in the greatest of all the ages how the prophets would have longed to have seen our day the announcing of the coming of jesus amen look at this my brother and sister now you would ask brother paul how can i overcome well as we look at these seven church ages each one declaring what the reward was of the overcomer and and it seems to be a challenge in our day that we have my brother and sister and and you know our real challenge is not to keep sin out of the church we can come here as i've said to you before we could put you know uh uh embolden our deegan to put a measuring device where you know measure your heel measure the length of your skirt the sleeves the this and the that and and you do all that my brother and sister we we can come and and implement you might say a legalistic form of keeping sin out of the church but sin is not in the shoe sin is not in this skirt sin is not in the sleeve sin is not in the cutting off of hair that is not sin the prophet of god showed us those are all attributes so how are we going to do are we going to have a heart scan a spirit skin what we need is the holy ghost in the church what we need is holy ghost on fire in our lives and these things will leave our life we don't have to come out and hammer and embarrass and shame and do this i say lord help us get more of the spirit get the fire of god in the church and the sin will not reside there whether it be young people or old people or whatever it is amen and we say how can we overcome i want to ask you do any of you does the devil throw things in your way and you seem to stumble over them you don't feel like an overcomer at that moment do you amen but god's given us an ability he declared already we're victorious we're the conquerors we're the winners so what are we going to do we're not going to look at the circumstance we're going to look at the promise brother branham said that god is bigger than his promise oh my brother and sister you look at that if i have a promise i received from the lord then i don't have to worry about that coming to pass he says that i will come in the time when satan would come in the flood i'll raise up a standard for you i will raise that up that you might overcome this my brother and sister do you realize what god is doing he is showing us how to be overcomers he didn't say i'm going to come and babysit you into an overcoming position i'm not going to write a whole big book about you being an overcomer i am going to give you the word i'm going to anchor it in your soul and as it comes alive in your soul it will start to bring this flesh in subjection you say but i don't know if i'm maturing well are you the same person you was a year ago five years ago amen because i want to put it to you kindly i'm getting a little aggressive here and i don't mean to i'm just excited but if you're in the same position you was a year ago or five years ago please don't leave the building without coming to the altar spiritual growth is not god wiping away all of our challenges spiritual growth is not god babysitting us and as it was in a generation past giving everybody a trophy for just showing up spiritual growth my brother and sister comes from warfare spiritual growth comes from fighting the battle pressing into that and coming to the place oh my brother and sister can you imagine we show up out of laodicea and we show up there before the saints of the ages and we are all there we not got not one drop of blood as it were not one scar not one ear that's been nicked and not one you know pain that we've suffered and to stand before the saints of the ages and say well my you guys look pretty good yeah god just came down he just took everything away from us all i had to do is just go to church you know what god would have to do i won't go where it is and how it is but the prophet of god lays out the platform that god would have to go back and apologize to them so if they were bloodied and they were we will be bloodied and we are but they were overcomers we are overcomers we will stand there and when we come into their presence my brother and sister little fontaine's wrote a song are you she i think most of you probably have heard that my brother and sister god has saved something special in the anointing for the age that we live because he knows the culmination of all of the spirits of the age has come down in this day and yes we got a great battle we have a great temptation it's at our fingertips amen all of it's around us that god has given us revelation like no generation has had revelation he has come and the opening of the coming of christ is before us and there's nothing like running a race and seeing the finish line i'll tell you my brother and sister you know you see a little video or maybe you witnessed it in the flesh and you know you'll see these young people kids whatever you want to call it and they're running and they're running and they're coming around the back stretch and you can see the pace is is kind of you know they're struggling maybe they're panting a little bit and you can see they're not running smoothly and they round that last corner and they look down the track and they see the finish line and all of a sudden you know it's it's kind of funny because you know the really fast people run standing up the rest of us lean forward and work at it but the really fast people actually actually they run almost upright a little back curve to their spine and the way they move their legs and their arms is actually faster than our good old-fashioned farm boy method of running and you'll see them around that corner and they're laboring and they're panting and they're struggling and then all of a sudden you'll see them their head comes up you know you can't run with your head down i'd like to challenge if you if you're going to actually take accept this challenge get somebody to video you and then just to prove my point we'll show it here at church natural spiritual you cannot run with your head down god didn't call you to come as a beggar a servant as a bomb god called you as sons and daughters of god he called you royalty do we have any royalty here this morning he called us royalty saints and royalty doesn't run with its head down defeated but you can see them as they round that corner that little curve in their back goes away and you know why you know why they run better do you need a real reason you don't breathe as efficiently in a slumped position and it's oxygen that makes the muscles function when their back is curved their chest expanded they breathe deeper more oxygen comes in the body flows to the muscle and the muscle responds but you see them when the finish line comes in view you never thought somebody could run so fast they literally pick the pace up to a degree you think wow wow that that's how fast they run when they started this race i hope you're with me that's how fast they ran that's how they ran when they started the race but there's a period of time around this track here where it's just it's labor is it not it's it's hard it's it's a struggle and we get our head down and we're not breathing like we should and we can't have vision if we're looking at the ground but when we come and recognize there's a finish line in front of us there's something about that that starts it and the prophet of god lays it out if you want to go search it out there is a little bit of reading between the lines if that's acceptable but you'll see this the prophet of god talking about to the end of the age and he says there is no revival yet i think you can use those very words there is no revival yet and the revival it is to come is a bride's revival not exact words it's a bride's revival you know what the bride's revival is we've rounded the corner and we see the finish line and something's anointing us oh lord my breath is deeper i got more voice to say oh lord come quickly because we're no longer caught in a rage to look at the flesh we're no longer caught in trying to establish ourselves as something of this world but we recognize i have a heavenly kingdom and god shared it he gave it to me and i claim that in the name of jesus christ hallelujah now look at this how can we overc how can we overcome it won't be our strength it won't be our knowledge right but did you know it will actually be an action are you with me oh non-action-like works gospel just told us right here in the scripture the action is to let us therefore come that's bold that's bold my brother and sister for us to think we can come boldly but this is what the word declared therefore come boldly into the throne of grace yes look i'm telling you sometimes my brother and sister we're alike i don't have to throw you under the bus so i don't have to throw myself under the bus we're humans but look at this what do we do we go into great trouble when travail and our spirits are depressed suppressed oppressed whatever kind of press you want to talk about and we do but you know what the devil does he brings us to a place we don't come boldly oh i said this i'd done this i looked at this i what i i oh my what do you do you cannot come boldly to the throne when you're under a spirit of condemnation you can't come boldly to the throne when you don't feel worthy you can't come boldly to the throne when you are struggling in that realm of the flesh but it's there that the word is telling us we have a high priest amen and he is touched with our infirmity and he was tempted he knows what you're facing and he says okay i know what you're facing now what i want you to do is come boldly to my throne i want you to get up out of your pity party i want you to get up out of your little thing you got going here and i want you to come boldly to my throne and this is not just a throne it's a throne of grace it's a place that grace resides is at that throne amen and then you obtain mercy and you find grace to help in the time of someone else's need possibly but he's actually speaking to you the time of your need prophet made statements like struggling with the devil how do you deal with that thank you lord how am i going to deal with the devil amen i need a tool chainsaw wouldn't be bad big sharp sword wouldn't be too bad a mortar machine gun no what did he say your position satan get thee behind me what is it when you hear the word and you mixed it with faith you actually realize i have the authority to say that satan get thee behind me but you see my brother and sister we need to come we need this action we need to to do this to come boldly and i want to drive this home to you if i can this morning it will be an action it's not figurative it's not an allegory it's an action it's an action of you taking your rightful position and saying lord forgive me for my thought for my deed for whatever it might be but lord i'm coming to your throne and i'm going to receive what i need and i am going to find grace in time of need you see coming boldly to the throne of grace at that throne my brother and sister there's where we obtain mercy and we find that in our time of need so as we need to overcome and we come and face the challenge of our day what the word of god is telling us is we need to become more and more dependent in fact some people are embarrassed to say well you know i had to go i had to go repent i'll tell you what god's doing in the life of the believer the true believer he's causing them to be so sensitive that every little thing that they do they're saying lord forgive me oh lord forgive me i i you know sometimes on the farm i justify this i justify this you know are we all justified i justify this it's okay to run a stop sign on a piece of farm equipment but not in your car justified justifying it takes so much effort to pick up speed again i'm justified my tractor is so slow it'll only go go go so i'm justified to not slow down but you know every time i run a stop sign on a tractor a voice speaks to me and i'm like lord forgive me but you know the next day i did it again and i don't really want to usually it's because sister jerry's got breakfast waiting for me right one excuse is as good as another right now i use that it's truthful and i do repent but you see my brother and sister god's given us a place for those little things those little foxes he's given us a place to deal with them imagine if you live a spotless life but you had a bad habit of speeding not speaking to you church but you know people like you in church you imagine the devil you'd show up there and the judgment and the devil would say yep i recorded i recorded 32 681 counts of them breaking the speed limit and one who is guilty of one law is guilty of them all you see am i coming across okay but god says you know what if you'll come boldly to the throne of grace you can obtain mercy and you can find grace to help you in the time of your need amen whether it's something in the mind whether it's something you struggle with amen hallelujah now it seems i don't know about you saints i'm not preaching to myself i don't think this morning totally and entirely but it seems that i have a need every single day of my life i have a reason to go back to the throne every single day of my life and you know there's an answer lord i need thee that song oh every hour i need thee oh could we just lift a hand and say lord i need thee i know my life is not not as such that i need you lord to get through this life lord i need this amen if we could make a theme maybe we could just claim that theme lord i need thee amen you know satan's had centuries to perfect his deception you know that i was just listening to a brother minister i love this brother's ministry i won't mention names but i was listening to this brother's ministry and and i loved how he put this point and and parents please hear me this brother made the point he says now you come you send your children to school they have six hours of schooling a lot of nonsense a lot of stuff indoctrination six hours that's 30 hours a week and we think two or three hours of church is going to offset that maybe i'll go ahead and quote the rest of what the brother said there is that all right plagiarize a good godly pastor in the message he said you parents that use electronics to babysit your children you think it's okay right now you will pay the price for that god did not create parents to let an electronic device be the babysitter you wonder what spirits are out there it's all there in their hand click click click click oh come on maybe that'll skin some of you but maybe it ought to amen god didn't give us the job for us to pass it off to some electronics and i'm telling you what i read some research most of the people who write these games write these programs don't even believe there's a god they're satanic worshipers all of this war stuff i watched a video this man was there and he's admitting they were actually interviewing him for this great creation of a war game that he had i don't remember even what it was called uh some kind of thrones thing or whatever and he said oh they said how did you write this most popular app or game of this in the whole world how did you write that he said well i was listening to some acid rock one evening and i was there and something began to formulate in my mind so i went and i i took a little bit of this and a little bit of that talking about drugs and he said then i just went into another dimension and when i woke up 30 hours later i oh woke up get this when i woke up 30 hours later i had written program this game and they said wow even the interviewer is like wow and the man's like i was anointed oh some of you will have played that game because it's all this warfare stuff kings and castles and this and kill oh come on get this kill conquer do this death oh yeah no problem it's just a game just like my life is just a game your life is just a game no i didn't get you all suppressed and subdued did i maybe to balance this out don't take paul's word for it go invest a few hours of prayer you know what they say i'm not making mockery it's a joke in our house kind of but you know they say if something's good for you hold it hold it up here like this and if your body likes it yeah some of you believe that stuff don't you because i'll tell you what i've done i've held up a hershey bar with almonds and just fallen all over myself on that thing it must be good for me i'm sure it was the almonds let me take another avenue for you if you'll take that whatever it is some game some book some whatever and you'll take that thing and you'll get a hold of that thing and you'll bow your head over it and say go on it's just going to feed me spiritually is this going to make my children go up in the fear and admonition of the lord or was this something written by a devil that's here to undermine and destroy and plant another kind of seed i challenge your parents i challenge you you don't just give it to your kid you take it to the throne of grace your own self first and give it a word test and let me just be bold enough to say if you'll take that garbage and you'll put it to a word test you'll never let your children touch it because you can't have something that was written by a devil anoint you to spiritual things oh it'll anoint you to spiritual things let me rephrase that to godly things okay is that okay y'all still love me yeah christ the mystery of god revealed brother brown says here you've got to make the picture look right it's god's great picture and there is only one way you'll see it that is when you see jesus christ there is the entire bible he is the principal theme of the bible now you realize that any of these places here you could take a text and it's just hard for a preacher to hold his peace and i say amen and he looked like he want to keep going with it but you've got to get back to what we're teaching on he is the principal theme of the bible he was in the prophets he was in the psalms it was in the history of the bible the bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love think about this in contrast to the world there was some atheists back east got elected to their state legislature and tried to put a law wrote a law and submitted it in their their state legislature to declare the bible a hate book yeah yeah i think i'll vote with the prophet amen hallelujah it's in the prophets in the psalms in history in the bible it's the things that is to come see was before until after did i skip over something i got lost somebody help me oh right there the very top line it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life and in there you find christ he was in the prophets he was in the psalms he was in the history he also in the bible is the things that is to come so he was before until after what does that make him then the same yesterday today and forever and you inject something in there that doesn't make him the same yesterday today and forever brother lee where do you go to you got an awful picture there for he was the history see he is the prophet he is the psalms he is everything and if you can't make him everything and the same where what's your picture look like do you see it all right amen oh is that the end of that i guess it is my i thought that quote when i was studying it was much longer excuse me i'm caught in a time warp here now look at this my brother and sister as you look at this i want you to catch this that you see the picture that's being presented brother george is preaching on the book of acts don't you like that he must be keeping notes because i don't know if a guy can remember what verse he left off on you know eight ten months later having a lovely conversation with brother george you know why he's preaching the book of acts saints he's trying to get us to see not what god did then to come to pass now he wants us to see what god did then is coming to pass now that's what he's trying to bring to life is not a vision of we hope someday to have this but my brother and sister we're seeing the dead brought back to life we're seeing the maimed and the crippled and the possessed being delivered you say brother paul i don't see it well i'll tell you what don't let what's happening in grace tabernacle or the neighborhood or your world dictates your thoughts of what god is doing around the earth god is saving my brother and sister muslims off the street hearing a prayer and you know in those countries where they hear those prayers like that you actually can be sentenced to death for praying in public but a muslim hearing a christian pray and saying there's something there there's something what is that i must have that in africa troubles my brother and sister over property believers wanting to use a property denominational church wanting to use a property in a big fuss the denomination making a such a big deal out of it and they're there broadcasting it these people are doing this and they're doing that representing it wrong and so there was a meeting my brother and sister i'm kind of butchering this a little bit there was a meeting a minister type meeting and this pentecostal pastor comes and he says can i and as they described it he was there in his very fine suit but befitting a pentecostal bishop of his position and he comes and says you're having a meeting can i come in and they said yes you can come in and he's basically like is there limitations no you just come and he comes in and he hears what's being spoken and before the meeting's over he calls he says i would like a moment to speak and they said speak and he said i have heard this and this is the truth and to punctuate my words that this is the truth i desire to be baptized right now oh no no gods no no god's not doing anything we're in a time warp just circling around if it is it's because you and i have put ourselves in that time war it's because you and i have not stepped out in the faith on the word and declared my god hears my needs my god knows what i need my god is going to come and answer my need and my greatest need saints i tell you this morning and i'm not ashamed to say it and my flesh is ashamed to say it but my greatest need is not more strength not more wisdom not more money not more lands i have need my greatest need is more of god more of the holy ghost is my greatest need today i am the limiting factor of paul's spiritual life oh lord help us he is everything brother branham here and christ the mystery of god revealed go listen to it beautiful sermon beautiful sermon amen but what is he doing he's showing us my brother and sister where our priority needs to be amen hebrews 13 8 it's not dead it's not gone god's alive he's well all is well he is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah i need to close here now look just for a moment can i have it just a few more minutes now we've had a glimpse of these other ages and we've all read enough history to understand we could share we could share things that we read of history too gory and too gruesome really to share in in church amongst congregation amongst children but a battle so great i'm often reminded my thoughts fox's book of mortars sorry i had to say that to torment my wife marchers she's like oh paul they weren't shooting at each other in there is the story of a man quite wealthy and somebody outed him maybe someone within his own family a servant or something they outed him that was a christian and they come and they say are you a christian he says yes i am they take him down where they're burning the christians at the state and as a moment as he's there they're tying him to the post and he's just watched a christian go up in flames and they said to you you repent and he says yes i recant in this flesh there was not enough strength in this flesh to watch someone chained to a post and set a flame in a giant pile of wood and burnt to death and he recants they turn him free he's recanted he's forsaken christ but all night long he's repenting have you ever had a night like that all night long he's repenting god forgive me forgive me lord forgive me lord forgive me you know the first forgiveness and the sincerity of the heart was sufficient but isn't there something interesting about the human nature that our heart condemns us our heart puts us in a place where it's almost like we don't believe that that first sincere prayer forgiveness is sufficient and we'll find ourselves in the middle of the night lord forgive me lord forgive me for you he got up bright and early the next morning went down to where they're already burning the saints at this stage and he says hey this is just my words you know what happened here yesterday yes i recant no you did that yesterday no i'm doing it today what i told you i recant and they're like do you realize your fine house your mansions your lands your servants your wife your children you realize you could have all of that and still live that just deny just step aside you're still serving god because after all we are the church you know it's strange how that persecution's still going on today you believe this doctrine after all we are the message believe that believe that deny this embrace that come on that spirit's not dead and they said so you're denying what you denied yesterday and he says yep i honestly cannot deny jesus christ and they're like you realize we're going to burn you at the stake he said this flesh just doesn't matter they went to time get these things you know they use chains because they've got to use them over and over again there's no way you're going to escape the chains they went to chain him and he says no no he said i i just i'm just i'm so committed you don't even need to chain me and they're like what he said yes give me one last wish and that would be you don't tie me to the tree fine you want to stand there get burnt no problem you know what happened they piled the wood up even higher they added all that fuel they lit it on fire and as the flames started to lick up against his flesh come on i want you to have a visual of this as the flame started to lick against his flesh he lifted his hands and they could hear his voice praising god declaring lord jesus i'm coming to see you i love you lord i give my life for you and they took sticks even as the flames are roasting his flesh they took sticks and tried to knock his arms down but they couldn't get his arms to go down and the memory that was seared in their visual is that this was a man with his mouth open and he died with his hands lifted praising god and they never ever allowed another man to not be chained because it smote them in their heart what was it saints he had already overcome a fear of the first death the night before he had overcome as it were the fear of the second death to the point he was willing to sacrifice his flesh to not be there oh god help us god help us oh we may never face a flaming we may never face those kind of things saints but we're going to have to die we're going to have to be more afraid of the second death than we are of the first death to be able to overcome it will be a place a thing that we will have to come and say you know what lord i'm willing to give amen i'll tell you it's there we're living in a day you know i want to can i give you a little homework would anybody do it if i actually was like a teacher children before class comes together again read proverbs 3. i encourage you incredible scripture incredible scripture now do i i that that other time didn't count against me right okay i am finished soon as we preach all these scriptures let's just go back and go through revelations 3 14 through 18. this is a word for our hour and into the angel of the church of the laodiceans right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works now this is an indictment saints this would be what a prosecutor would read in a court of law i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou wort cold or hot now as we go through this i want to to leave this in such a fashion do we have the answer to this yes come on saints do we have the answer to this verse amen amen it's because they've come they're neither cold or hot god said i'd rather you would be cold let's not call let's not claim that as an option but we have the answer to lukewarm god has given us in this hour a word that is the answer for lukewarm so if we remain lukewarm and i don't say this spitefully or judgmentally but if we uh stay or or stay in the position of being lukewarm my brother and sister that will not be god's fault it won't be the church's fault it won't be the pastor's fault it will be our fault because we have been given the solution to cold and lukewarm amen it is a position that god has given us that we could come and and not have be stuck there and say i can't do anything about it we've been given the answer to satan's question he says i'll spew you out of my mouth now some people will say that's that's figurative isn't it well we'll just take the stance of being figurative because the opposite of that will be well done my good and faithful servant now i want to ask you which one would you want to hear what is our choice cast into outer darkness weeping wailing gnashing of teeth or well done come on saints i'm not saying this in a negative fashion i'm just bringing this that we can recognize what satan's trying to do in our hour he's made the message a tradition because the scripture says it's because of tradition that the word has been made of no effect don't let this message be tradition let it be life let it be on fire let it be burning i you know believe it or not this morning never even struck me this way i just woke up with that little thought i almost asked our little sisters to sing that song up find my bones hallelujah i i like the beat of that i mean i like that you know because what it is my brother and sister is not firing my mind amen it's right down the very fiber of who we are let me hurry along here because thou saith i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked so we recognize my brother and sister to declare just simply to declare is not enough to simply say i've got the message i've got the holy ghost i've got all of these things look at the life god has given me that means nothing my brother and sister we've got to come to the place that we recognize i will not by god's grace because i'm going to come boldly to the throne of grace in my time of need i don't have to be wretched amen i don't have to be naked i don't have to be all of these things that would be a stigma because i have a throne that god's given me permission can someone say permission amen i've been given permission to come to this throne in the time of my need and if i am blind i have a need if i am naked i have a need if i am wretched i have a need amen so god says i'm opening the door to my throne because i have the solution the answer to your need but but brother paul you don't understand my situation i'm going to be rude if you don't mind you don't understand the power of a boldness to come to the throne that's what you don't understand is the power of the boldness you don't need any man's permission you don't need anything you just follow god gave it you take it you apply it and come boldly he says i counsel thee my of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with thy sound that thou mayest see what do i got to do brother paul to buy this gold well get away from the cardinal it's a good start you know i thought this was funny a well-known non-denominational preacher made a statement i read the little quotation of it he said there'll be no financial statements in heaven god won't care he doesn't care saints can i emphasize this he doesn't care what we have here yeah and then amazing i'm speaking to paul first so nobody offended isn't it amazing how much emphasis we save on a little more in our 401k a little more in our savings account a little more on our mortgage a little more here a little more there and god could care less as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come unto him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh amen we've already been over this verse but to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he the hath and ear let him hear with the spirit saith in the churches amen oh i'll just keep this last quote because i've just kind of kept begging you for time but it's a good one anybody want to eat dessert first today huh let me at least see let me see at least one hand so that i i can okay okay amen the testimony on the sea what happened when the dark hour come along that they realized that had not had him with them and the first thing you know here he come see and now little of this why this just stirred my heart thinking about what brother stephen preached to us and first thing you know here he come walking to them on the sea the only thing that could help them and what did they do they cried out they were scared of him imagine if some of our innermost emotion would ever get released okay i'll just say it you got to have somebody to blame i think most of us are just scared lord just really get aholds of us oh no it's not about the running and jumping and shouting that matters but when the spirit of god comes down on us most of us clamp on a leg iron and hook it to the pew oh no lord i wouldn't want to be the one in the aisle we'll be here i've heard it oh you know who told me this it's been more than one of you you know brother paul the service was good i felt like getting up and jumping and screaming and running up the aisle of the church yeah you did huh you felt like it that's all you had was feelings oh no brother paul that be a spectacle might be out of order might be out of order well i'll tell you what maybe just ask brother george next time you see him about the sister there in the tabernacle would get so excited she would get so filled with the spirit she'd jump up she carried a handbag that said samsonite on it and she would get so excited she'd get that hand back and handbag in her hand and she'd be there all prayers a lord and there went this and the car keys and then with tissue no wallet maybe a little money who knows the kids whatever do you ever hear on tape where they rebuked her sit down sister be quiet no they said she did it time after time and if you were lucky you were out of range of that handbag making that circle yeah come on saints could i challenge you challenge us as a church to not put the shackles on am i saying we got to get up and start running up down the aisles no i'm not saying that but maybe some of you can't even get a hand in the air some of you can't get a hallelujah praise the lord thank you lord amen out amen oh i'm not trying to tell you got to do these things i'm just telling you see god's not looking for us to remain all civilized and sophisticated that we can say i praise the lord the spirit moved today what did it move well it didn't move me but i mean i didn't lord move me enough to at least let me get my hand up move me enough lord at least let my back go back and my head go back and my lungs fill full of air cause i see the finish line and i'm here to declare hallelujah i see a finish line i see the race that i've been running and it's coming closer closer closer and the world today have you seen the headlines they are now saying we are so close to a nuclear holocaust as close as ever has been and we are afraid government officials we are terrified of what will happen if there's another step well i tell you what i'm not terrified because the next step has already been ordained of god the next steps in god's authority it's not even in man's authority some people say mr putin is a crazy man but i say my brother and sister that he's doing the work of god he's doing exactly oh do i do i justify that no i don't like that i'm not a man of confrontation but my brother and sister when the prophet of god said he saw america as a smoldering ruin was that an allegory are we going to say well that was just a symbolism spiritual destruction of this and that my brother and sister i believe it's true i believe it's true people are like well what about a california fallen in the ocean uh you know i used to drive truck i'd go down there at an individual i won't go into what the deal but they're like hey you must not believe the profit i'm like why because you're driving a truck you're going to california every week in a truck okay it's gonna fall in the ocean i got maybe a little bold to this brother i said brother if i am there when it falls in the ocean i got greater problems than my destruction of my flesh if i'm there oh but what about this and what about that my brother and sister our job is to not worry about the end of this earth our job is to see the end of the race and to run it get our head back quit looking at the ground quit walking as though we're depressed quit doing these things get our head up and run the race that has been set before us run it with strength run it with authority run it for the result you say run it for the result that's right you know my brother and sister a man i watched this little interview this guy had just been running i don't know if it's a marathon or a steeplechase or something and the man comes in a pretty close second but one of the commentators says we saw you coming in the backstress and we saw you running in the race and and you were running and then all of a sudden you started fading and they said what happened did you have a cramp did you have something and the man looks at the ground a little bit slumps his head down he goes well really the truth is i realized i couldn't beat him he was running neck and neck with him i couldn't beat him what happened faded right out of the race oh we come in second place that might be good enough won't it be brother trevor i almost won the race for the rapture sorry i hope you guys don't mind i know that's not the kind of race we're running but if you guys aren't careful i'll be kicking dust in your face because i'm going to run i'm going to run i'm going to run i'm going to run i'm going to run and if i can't run i will crawl hallelujah but you know i'm taking your time i'm sorry when i was first coming back to the lord imagine maybe i'll be a little symbolic here i can remember saints i can remember thinking lord if i could just crawl across the threshold of heaven i'll be happy lord if i could just be there i carried that testimony saints for years lord if i could just but her brother was preaching one day i was rejoicing we were in these services live i was rejoicing and i believe it was the lord speaking to me the brother made a comment on the order of and those of you that believe god called you to just crawl into heaven you need to get a revelation of what it is to be an overcomer i was delivered right there i was delivered of my own confession and i'm like oh okay praise the lord i'm not going to crawl into heaven you guys are going to see me i'm going to be loud i'm going to be obnoxious i'm going to stop across the line i'm going to shout i'm going to run around in circles i'm going to jump up and down i'm going to high-five everybody that's around me and i'm going to say thank you lord for grace thank you lord for mercy thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord i don't know if they've got a deacon there to quiet us down or not no sir amen i'm not quitting god help me by god's grace i'm going to start running with my head up a little bit more come on those of you that have temperamental emotions trying to find the right words that's a nice way to say those of you that are up and down like i am you know standing on the cloud the next day and hanging on the bottom of it you know now i know that's none of you but i tell you what god just studying this message right here god just like get your shoulders back boy you are marching with the king of kings i'm in the king's army i'm not a i didn't flunk boot camp i did have to go back a couple times [Music] reminds me brother donnie making a statement years ago he said you know god god's not going to move you along until you're ready to move along and he says some of you big old burly men are going to look really funny sitting in them little dinky dinky kindergarten chairs going back to school again and again and again well lord help me y'all invited to my graduation party now i might have to take first grade a few times to get beyond it but i will and second but i will and third but i will and forth and right on down the line i will because god called me hallelujah sister emmy come amen i should have said those words 30 minutes ago hallelujah that dark hour come along first thing you know he's coming to him they were afraid scared that the only thing that could help him because it looked spooky it's a spirit spirit walking on the water nothing could do that but a spirit ooh they were scared the only hopes they had and they was afraid of that's the same thing tonight the hope of the coming of the lord jesus is appearing amongst the people and when they see it they want to call it mental telepathy they want to call it fortune telling they want to call it every kind of devil that can be called it's the only thing that can help you what was the voice that come from him fear not come on saints today let's just take this let's hold to this fear not be of good courage it is i look kind of scary at first but it is i be not afraid now we've had a lot of testimony meetings and we see what's happening to the church don't be scared he's still god he's just as much god as he ever was do you believe that the same testimony he was one of them in that day we can believe that him being the same testimony to us today can't you believe that amen aren't you glad hallelujah oh church it's time for us get our confidence in the word of god god used the same theme through the ages he didn't come along you want to study a little bit towards that thought what is his name what is the new name prophet gives clarity to it people tried to turn it into a doctrine god just turned it into his word amen made it alive to his bride who we are what we're here for the purpose and the identity and you'll find eastern culture is very representative brother brown even mentions eastern culture you realize my brother and sister not every culture is this way but we take this take it in type or example the bride takes her husband's name hallelujah just think about that in a spiritual context [Music] let's sing that song of a child of the king [Music] amen [Music] okay i don't know that i know all of these brother jason you know all them verses you know saints i was just the other day listening to some preaching i was so rejoicing i felt so good myself when it was over so i found a pastor that sings as bad as i do [Music] i was like hallelujah that

that's running and the mountain lion is chasing it and the little thing's squealing in fear and it's climbed over the rocks and it's falling in the water it's floated down there finally it's exhausted and it comes up on the shore and there's there's a log there and it claws it up on the log and then it shows the mountain lion coming down the log to it and then the mountain lion suddenly gets a look and the little bear something anoints him puts his head back a whole hope you get it puts his head back you didn't see him go he put his head back reared up [Music] and the mountain lion looks gone then the camera goes out and right behind baby bear is mama hallelujah well i tell you what god's gonna stand behind you saints he's not gonna let this devil come in spite of him being a roaring lion
