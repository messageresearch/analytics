[53:05] here and if you salute your brethren
[53:11] only what do you more than others do not

[53:29] the reading of his word as you may have
[53:30] your seat this
[53:32] morning praise the Lord I'm not used to
[53:36] the this kind of
[53:39] microphone but it's fine all right so
[53:42] this morning by the grace of God we
[53:44] speaking
[53:45] about God's dwelling place we speaking
[53:50] about God dwelling
[53:52] place we know that uh our God is the
[53:58] great one he is the creator of every
[54:01] single things things visible and
[54:04] invisible he's the one who created us
[54:07] who the one who called us uh by his name
[54:11] so I'll read one quote here uh the
[54:13] prophet says I don't have that here says
[54:16] in the word of Separation it says all
[54:19] right water of Separation
[54:22] can uh we are here to hear the word it
[54:25] says here I pass through the city and
[54:28] see these big
[54:31] homes I appreciate that but there is
[54:34] none of you but live in a three room
[54:38] house that is all you can live in that's
[54:42] right you just live in a three room
[54:44] house when God was here he live in a
[54:48] three room house that is all you could
[54:51] live in the first is your kitchen that's
[54:54] it the next is your dining room or a
[54:57] living room and the next is your bedroom
[55:01] you may have three four bedroom or
[55:04] couple of dining rooms or something but
[55:07] really that is just extra
[55:10] rooms you come first to the
[55:13] kitchen where you
[55:15] eat after you come and eat like the
[55:19] church you sit you sit on bench to hear
[55:25] the
[55:26] word faith come by hearing and hearing
[55:29] from the word of God so faith cannot
[55:32] come by the news by listening to the
[55:35] news you can listen to the news you can
[55:38] listen to the podcast you can listen to
[55:40] anything but you don't receive Faith by
[55:43] doing so so because all these things can
[55:46] create fear all these things can create
[55:49] a lot of
[55:50] anxieties but when you come to listen to
[55:53] the word of God fath Faith come by
[55:56] hearings you know hearing the word of
[55:59] God because the word of God is powerful
[56:02] the word of God does have a power to
[56:04] transform the word of God does have a
[56:06] power to control the word of God
[56:09] controls situations you control event
[56:12] there's not event that can happen that
[56:14] God doesn't know God is not surprised by
[56:18] what is going on God is not surprised by
[56:20] your situations God is not surprised by
[56:24] any disease or any plagues that can
[56:27] comes on because every single things is
[56:30] controlled by the word of God and then
[56:33] when we come to hear the word of God the
[56:36] word of God is a seed as the Bible says
[56:40] the word of God is a seed and then when
[56:42] we listen to the word the word does have
[56:45] a power to do as the word says He will
[56:48] do because the word of God is not a word
[56:51] of a man it's the word of God Amen
[56:55] praise the Lord so he says that Faith
[56:58] come by hearing and hearing from the
[57:00] word of God then after you have eat the
[57:03] word then you come in the living room
[57:06] amen when you come the living room which
[57:08] is into fellowship with the rest of the
[57:11] church right exactly so you have eat the
[57:14] word and then now you come in the living
[57:16] rooms because men you there some people
[57:19] can have 16 bedroom or 16 bedroom and 20
[57:24] bathroom
[57:25] so but you cannot live on all those
[57:27] rooms you live only in three rooms you
[57:30] live in the kitchen in the living room
[57:32] and then the bedrooms and the prophet
[57:34] said the living room is where you come
[57:37] and fellowship when you fellowship with
[57:40] the Breen when you fellowship with the
[57:43] Believers and then then after that you
[57:45] go in the secret
[57:47] place amen I like that we go now in the
[57:50] secret place it's where in the bedroom
[57:54] is the secret place it says it where you
[57:57] go and kneel down amen that when you
[58:01] have fellowship with God that when you
[58:04] bring up your prayers that when you
[58:07] fellowship with him and then when God
[58:11] and you as in a secret place so you we
[58:15] see that God is living uh in you as a
[58:20] human being you living in three
[58:21] bedroomroom house and then we see as we
[58:24] read here the Bible says be therefore
[58:26] perfect as your heavenly father is
[58:29] perfect so that word perfect
[58:32] means having all the require I have to
[58:36] read this because I put this down he say
[58:38] have all the require or desirable
[58:42] element qualities yes or
[58:46] characteristics as good as it possibly
[58:49] to be that is being perfect that is
[58:53] being perfect it's
[58:55] we F
[58:57] fault it's Flawless
[59:00] amen so being perfect mean you are
[59:04] without fault amen hallelujah you are
[59:07] flawless amen so you have all the
[59:10] desirable characteristics that is
[59:13] required to be Hallelujah so you are
[59:15] flawless so as a human as a man what you
[59:19] can your your best effort that you can
[59:23] do every single thing that you can do as
[59:26] a human it's failure that's right that's
[59:28] right every single thing you can try to
[59:31] do it's a it's but a failure that's
[59:33] right you cannot be perfect by yourself
[59:35] that's right you can you can try you can
[59:38] try to come to church you can try to be
[59:40] to be religious but you cannot be
[59:43] perfect as heavenly father is perfect by
[59:45] yourself that's right but there God you
[59:48] need to have something special that is
[59:51] coming from God or God himself come
[59:53] dwell inside of you in order for him to
[59:56] live his own life because without God
[59:59] living his own life you can try but you
[1:00:02] cannot be perfect you cannot be like God
[1:00:05] you cannot be like God by yourself you
[1:00:07] you you can try to come to church you
[1:00:10] can try to sing you can try all these
[1:00:12] things but without God himself coming
[1:00:15] dwelling inside of you you are just as a
[1:00:18] failure as a failure can be amen amen
[1:00:22] praise the Lord so because the Bible say
[1:00:24] for all all have seen and come short of
[1:00:27] the glory of God Amen there's no one
[1:00:30] every single one every single one was
[1:00:33] come short the glory of God is that why
[1:00:36] in Revelation chapter 5 when they say
[1:00:38] who is worthy no one was worthy the
[1:00:41] Bible says there were no one worthy even
[1:00:43] to look upon the book there were no one
[1:00:46] worthy to call the prophet there were no
[1:00:48] Prophet that was worthy there were no
[1:00:50] there were no there were no preacher who
[1:00:52] was worthy there were no one was about
[1:00:55] the Lamb of God himself the Lord Jesus
[1:00:58] Christ was the one who was worthy to
[1:01:01] take the book and to break break the
[1:01:02] seals thereof they that the only one who
[1:01:05] was perfect because when he was on the
[1:01:08] earth he said who can accuse me of
[1:01:10] sin no one can accuse him of sin it was
[1:01:13] he was so perfect it was so perfect in
[1:01:16] this message called Perfections uh
[1:01:18] where's my time here okay just need to
[1:01:20] go very slowly slowly here okay in
[1:01:23] message called perfection the prophet
[1:01:25] says here now God in the beginning
[1:01:28] require
[1:01:29] Perfection Jesus when he come on the
[1:01:32] earth says be therefore perfect like God
[1:01:35] in heaven is perfect and the law having
[1:01:38] a shadow of things to come could never
[1:01:41] make the worshipper
[1:01:43] perfect you get the picture now let's go
[1:01:46] it let's go it into it again uh so you
[1:01:50] be sure to you cannot miss it say god
[1:01:53] require perfect
[1:01:55] Holiness no one can stand in His
[1:01:58] image with one little speck of sin Jesus
[1:02:02] witnessed the same and said be therefore
[1:02:04] perf is perfect now say and the Bible
[1:02:07] say the LA could never with it sacrifice
[1:02:11] make the calmer
[1:02:13] perfect then the LA could not perfect
[1:02:17] anything it was only a pointer this
[1:02:21] sacrifice made every year could never
[1:02:23] make the worshipper perfect so therefore
[1:02:27] no one under the law or keeping of law
[1:02:31] or under the shadow could be perfect
[1:02:34] hallelujah amen amen no one could be
[1:02:38] perfect under the law amen because God G
[1:02:41] say if you do this I will do this if you
[1:02:43] do this I will do this and no one can
[1:02:46] ever keep the law of God that's right no
[1:02:48] one could do as Lord want to do every
[1:02:50] single one every single time was just
[1:02:52] failing every single time time was just
[1:02:54] failing you see because no one could
[1:02:57] could have keep what God says because
[1:03:00] this great God give the law he said th
[1:03:03] shall not do this th shall not do this
[1:03:05] that shall every single one tries but no
[1:03:08] one could ever keep the laws of God but
[1:03:10] God require Perfections because the time
[1:03:13] of manifestations and to be manifested
[1:03:16] you need to be perfect because the time
[1:03:18] of adoptions is the time of blessing of
[1:03:21] sons it's the time when you need to be
[1:03:24] like your heavenly fathers you need the
[1:03:26] time that you see every single thing is
[1:03:28] maturing sin is maturing the worldly is
[1:03:32] maturing every single thing is maturing
[1:03:35] every single things is getting is
[1:03:36] getting to the manifestations the word
[1:03:39] of God also is getting to the
[1:03:41] manifestations the Believers also are
[1:03:43] coming much more closer and closer to
[1:03:46] God by the word of God not by yourself
[1:03:50] by yourself you cannot do it but by the
[1:03:53] word of God
[1:03:55] by the the spoken word of God that the
[1:03:58] only way you can come to maturity that
[1:04:01] the only way you can count Perfections
[1:04:04] amen praise the Lord amen I feel good
[1:04:07] now I was nervous now I feel good praise
[1:04:12] the Lord so now we see that God requires
[1:04:15] that because the Bible says being born
[1:04:17] again not of corruptable seed but for
[1:04:21] incorruptable seed by the word of God
[1:04:25] which lived and abide because the word
[1:04:28] of God is quicker it's sharper and then
[1:04:32] it's it's very quick is is doing a quick
[1:04:35] work so the word of God is very quick so
[1:04:38] when you receive the problem is just
[1:04:40] receive the word and believe the word
[1:04:43] don't reason with the word of God don't
[1:04:45] say how this will happen I don't know
[1:04:48] how this is impossible Mary didn't say
[1:04:51] this is impossible Mary say let it be
[1:04:53] done to me according to your word
[1:04:56] because the word of God does have a
[1:04:58] power it's so quick it's so effective
[1:05:01] actually the word of God is very
[1:05:03] effective amen when he comes he will do
[1:05:06] as the word says we just need to lay
[1:05:09] there we just need to lay we just need
[1:05:11] to believe he said Lord I believe Lord I
[1:05:14] trust in you amen praise the Lord amen
[1:05:19] you see
[1:05:20] now God says the most high God
[1:05:24] God doesn't dwell in hand in House made
[1:05:28] with hands that's right this the great
[1:05:31] God the creator of Genesis we created
[1:05:34] every single things amen and then the
[1:05:37] Bible says folks have alls and the bird
[1:05:40] of Heaven have next but the son of man
[1:05:44] does not have a place where he may lay
[1:05:46] his head amen this is the great God who
[1:05:49] created every single things things
[1:05:52] visible and invisible the Bible say
[1:05:54] every single thing was made by him and
[1:05:56] for him and for his glory but this great
[1:05:59] God this great hellim didn't have even a
[1:06:02] place to lay his head and then Solomon
[1:06:06] come says and as we read there say which
[1:06:08] out will you build me because the most
[1:06:11] high doesn't dwell in in buildings made
[1:06:14] with man's hand amen and then he he
[1:06:18] called Moses up he said Moses now I'll
[1:06:20] show you something in Exodus chapter 25
[1:06:23] verse
[1:06:24] 8 the Bible says here Exodus 25:8 it
[1:06:29] says and let them make me a
[1:06:31] sanctuary that I may dwell among
[1:06:35] them according to all I showed thee
[1:06:38] after the pattern of the Tabernacle and
[1:06:41] the pattern of all the instrument
[1:06:44] thereof and even so shall he make it so
[1:06:48] as we know that Moses didn't make the
[1:06:50] Tabernacle but Solomon comes and make
[1:06:53] the Tabernacle and when Solomon built
[1:06:55] that Tabernacle in first king
[1:06:58] 8:12 the Bible says here he
[1:07:01] says and it came to pass when the priest
[1:07:05] were come out of the Holy place that the
[1:07:08] cloud filled the house of the Lord so
[1:07:11] that the priest could not stand to
[1:07:14] minister because the cloud for the glory
[1:07:17] of the Lord has filled the house of the
[1:07:20] Lord right amen then listen then speak
[1:07:24] Solomon amen the Lord says that you will
[1:07:29] he will dwell in the thick Darkness amen
[1:07:34] this is the great God now the Bible says
[1:07:38] that in God there's no Darkness at
[1:07:41] all amen there's no Darkness at all in
[1:07:44] God but here the Solomon says the Lord
[1:07:47] has agree actually say I'll dwell in
[1:07:50] thick Darkness I'll come in your
[1:07:53] condition
[1:07:55] I'll come in your conditions when you
[1:07:58] cannot do it I'll come in that Darkness
[1:08:00] I'll come so down in your lowly
[1:08:03] conditions I come to the chiefest of The
[1:08:06] Sinner I will come in there I'll dwell
[1:08:09] with you I'll come to do my work in you
[1:08:13] it doesn't matter where you were it
[1:08:15] doesn't matter what condition you are in
[1:08:17] it doesn't matter what if you hav't gone
[1:08:19] farther away from God God says I will
[1:08:23] come I have choose to come to dwell in
[1:08:26] thick darkness in the in the thickest of
[1:08:30] all Darkness not only in darkness but in
[1:08:32] the thick Darkness amen amen amen praise
[1:08:36] the Lord in the Book of John 1 John
[1:08:38] chapter 1 verse 5 the Bible says and
[1:08:41] then this message which we have heard
[1:08:43] and declare unto you that God is light
[1:08:47] and in him there's no Darkness at all
[1:08:50] but this same God this same God has
[1:08:53] accepted to come in your conditions is
[1:08:56] accepted to come as is that say just as
[1:08:59] you are come just as you don't question
[1:09:02] just as you are come to
[1:09:04] God Amen and then he will take it from
[1:09:07] there he does have the power to
[1:09:09] transforms he doesn't have the power to
[1:09:11] change he doesn't have the power to give
[1:09:13] you courage to move forward amen praise
[1:09:17] the Lord isn't that good amen our God is
[1:09:22] tremendous you want he loves us so much
[1:09:25] he love us so much then he'll do every
[1:09:28] single thing it it takes to come and
[1:09:30] make us make sure that we make it make
[1:09:34] sure that we are perfect as he is
[1:09:36] perfect amen praise the Lord the book of
[1:09:40] uh Hebrews chapter 8 verse 6 the Bible
[1:09:43] says here but now this is Paul now
[1:09:47] picking it up he said but now that he
[1:09:50] obtained a more excellent Ministry but
[1:09:54] how much also is the mediator of better
[1:09:57] Covenant which was established upon the
[1:10:00] better
[1:10:01] promises amen you say for it that first
[1:10:05] Covenant has been thoughtless then
[1:10:08] should not Place have been sought for
[1:10:10] the second one because the first one no
[1:10:13] one could ever keep it that's it every
[1:10:15] single one was failure no one could ever
[1:10:18] keep the Covenant of God and then he
[1:10:20] says it says on verse eight it says for
[1:10:23] funding for with them he said behold the
[1:10:25] day come say the Lord when I will make a
[1:10:29] New Covenant with the house of Israel
[1:10:32] and with the house of Judah not
[1:10:35] according to to the Covenant that I made
[1:10:38] with their father in the day when I took
[1:10:40] them by the hand to lead them that's it
[1:10:44] it says because they continue not in my
[1:10:46] Covenant I regard them not said the Lord
[1:10:49] for this is the Covenant that I will
[1:10:51] make with the house of Israel
[1:10:54] after those days said the Lord I will
[1:10:59] put my laws in their minds Hallelujah
[1:11:02] and write them in their hearts and I
[1:11:05] will be them a God and they shall be me
[1:11:09] a people amen now God is putting his
[1:11:14] Covenant he putting his laws in our mind
[1:11:19] he putting his laws in our heart in
[1:11:22] order for us to be perfect as he is
[1:11:24] perfect in order for us to to stay with
[1:11:28] the word of God Amen because when God
[1:11:32] write those laws in our heart they enter
[1:11:36] in our
[1:11:38] wills and our choices yes in our
[1:11:42] affections yes now it's not as Paul say
[1:11:45] it's not me living but it's Christ
[1:11:48] Living in me that's because the laws now
[1:11:51] become our WIS that's it now it becomes
[1:11:53] now because they in our heart they start
[1:11:55] directing us where we can do what we can
[1:11:58] do is this according to God's word is
[1:12:00] this according to God's promises is this
[1:12:02] what god require for me to do because
[1:12:05] now God has put them in our hearts amen
[1:12:09] praise the Lord now when those laws are
[1:12:12] in our heart duty is transfer amen ah to
[1:12:18] delight and into spontaneous love
[1:12:21] service right it's not not again a duty
[1:12:24] to come to church right it's not a duty
[1:12:27] to serve the Lord right it's not a duty
[1:12:30] to sing and to say glory to God because
[1:12:33] now you are doing according to God it's
[1:12:37] not you it's God now it's God responding
[1:12:40] to his own words it's all God believing
[1:12:43] his own words it's God himself in you
[1:12:46] it's God inside working through the
[1:12:49] outside it's not you but it's God Amen

[1:13:13] Idols will I cleanse you amen a new
[1:13:18] heart also I'll give you and a new
[1:13:22] spirit will p
[1:13:24] within you I will take away the Stony
[1:13:27] heart out of your flesh and I'll give
[1:13:30] you a heart of Flesh and I'll put my
[1:13:34] spirit Hallelujah I'll put my spirit
[1:13:36] within you and now listen and cause you
[1:13:40] that's it Hallelujah cause you now it's
[1:13:44] not even you now it's God causing you to
[1:13:48] work in my
[1:13:50] statutes it's God who's doing it now and
[1:13:53] yes he SH now and you shall keep my
[1:13:56] judgment and do them amen amen now it's
[1:14:00] God doing it for you now it's him
[1:14:03] causing you to do that is him causing
[1:14:06] you to leave his own word amen praise
[1:14:11] the Lord Amen brother Bram says here in
[1:14:15] this message here why some people don't
[1:14:19] uh keep the victory amen I think that is
[1:14:22] the one he says
[1:14:23] here it
[1:14:25] says yes that's what need today it
[1:14:29] experience of the new birth amen now I
[1:14:32] want you to watch the order that Ezekiel
[1:14:36] brought it in he said I'll give you a
[1:14:39] new heart so I'll give you a new heart
[1:14:42] and I'll give you a new
[1:14:44] spirit and I'll put my spirit in you I
[1:14:48] want you to watch there is three of it a
[1:14:52] new heart
[1:14:53] I'll take the old Stony heart away that
[1:14:57] is what that all different heart you
[1:15:00] have I'll give you a new spirit now many
[1:15:04] times and there's been a terrible
[1:15:07] mistake the people has
[1:15:10] thought sometime that the new spirit was
[1:15:13] the Holy Spirit right but it's not the
[1:15:16] Holy Spirit that's
[1:15:19] right God give you a new spirit what
[1:15:23] should couldn't even because with your
[1:15:25] whole Spirit he says you cannot get
[1:15:28] along with
[1:15:30] yourself with your old Spirit you cannot
[1:15:34] get along with yourself how can you get
[1:15:36] along with the things of God it's
[1:15:38] impossible is that why God first come he
[1:15:41] give you a new spirit that new spirit is
[1:15:44] not the Holy Ghost but the spirit that
[1:15:46] you can get along with the things of God
[1:15:50] Amen I like the prophet you see it is re
[1:15:54] it is a revealer of the word of God and
[1:15:57] then he says he gives you a new spirit
[1:15:59] and then he says H with you all and then
[1:16:01] how could you go along with the Holy
[1:16:03] Ghost say God has to give you a new
[1:16:05] spirit so you could get along with his
[1:16:09] spirit amen and and then he goes I just
[1:16:12] go back says see new heart new spirit
[1:16:16] and my spirit
[1:16:18] amen three things he spoke of that's
[1:16:21] right amen gives you a new heart a new
[1:16:25] spirit now and his Spirit that's right
[1:16:28] amen because now when you have the
[1:16:31] spirit of God now you can understand the
[1:16:34] things of God that's right because
[1:16:36] without the spirit of God they can speak
[1:16:38] the things of God they will be just like
[1:16:41] this it doesn't make any sense it
[1:16:44] doesn't make any sense you see but you
[1:16:46] need and then when you have the new
[1:16:48] spirit your vision will change now you
[1:16:50] start seeing things as God sees them
[1:16:53] because now you become in the same
[1:16:54] channel with the word of God now that
[1:16:56] Spirit become become a a a Same Spirit
[1:17:00] like spirit of God you you become along
[1:17:02] with the spirit of God Amen praise the
[1:17:06] Lord you see that is what it takes amen
[1:17:11] for us to be perfect like God that's it
[1:17:14] amen now here God is building his own
[1:17:18] house amen God is building his own
[1:17:22] because the only one is not dwelling in
[1:17:24] the building made by men like this
[1:17:26] that's it that's right he cannot live in
[1:17:28] here that's right and then he says I'll
[1:17:30] build myself a building I'll build
[1:17:33] myself a church amen let's read in John
[1:17:36] 14
[1:17:37] verse1 of John chter
[1:17:40] 14:1 and then he says let your heart be
[1:17:44] no
[1:17:46] trouble because uh if you at this
[1:17:48] trouble you have so many issues with the
[1:17:51] heart with the heart heart there's so
[1:17:53] many issues yeah if your heart is not

[1:18:06] amen focus on God that's look at Jesus
[1:18:10] Christ the author and the finisher of
[1:18:12] the the

[1:18:16] have a lot of heart diseases and heart
[1:18:19] problems because the prophet says uh
[1:18:22] stress or if you have anxiety or all
[1:18:24] these things they're bringing a lot of
[1:18:26] sickness that's right amen they're
[1:18:29] bringing a lot of diseases they are but
[1:18:32] that what Jesus himself Our God come he
[1:18:34] say let not your heart be
[1:18:38] troubled if you see a event you see what
[1:18:41] wherever goes God is not surprised by by
[1:18:44] the event that is going on that's right
[1:18:46] God is not surprised by any
[1:18:49] situations God is in he he got all in
[1:18:53] control amen every single thing is in
[1:18:56] control he know exactly what he's doing
[1:19:01] he is God Amen he said let not your
[1:19:03] heart be troubles ye believe in me

[1:19:58] bunch of house up there made up with
[1:20:01] more da with paper hole painted on the
[1:20:04] oil I never believe that a supernatural
[1:20:08] being will have to live in a literal

[1:34:19] faithful Hallelujah the Tabernacle of
[1:34:21] God if with men and I will come and
[1:34:25] dwell with them now you see now we can
[1:34:28] find an answer to the scripture that we
[1:34:31] read he said what house will you build
[1:34:34] me now God will come and dwell in his
[1:34:37] people God will come and dwell in
[1:34:40] individuals in the brothers and sisters
[1:34:43] and God now can find a place of rest
[1:34:46] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can
[1:34:48] find out a place of rest go the prophet
[1:34:51] say
[1:34:52] God doesn't have other hand than your
[1:34:55] hand he doesn't have other feet than
[1:34:58] your feet now God is dwelling inside of
[1:35:01] us now you can see a brother or a sister
[1:35:06] is housing God am that's why the Bible
[1:35:08] says you need to discern the Lord's body
[1:35:11] that's right you need to discern the
[1:35:13] Lord body Discerning the brother and
[1:35:14] sister around you you never know what's
[1:35:16] going on with her or
[1:35:18] him she she or how's God he can be God
[1:35:23] it's say some will receive their reward
[1:35:26] just by being good to the Believers
[1:35:28] that's
[1:35:29] right because the the housing
[1:35:32] God God because we arriving a time of
[1:35:36] look at how sin is
[1:35:39] maturing look how all these things are
[1:35:41] maturing but you see the prophet said
[1:35:44] when you see the natural is a type of
[1:35:46] the spiritual or the spiritual is a type
[1:35:47] of the natural and then you see what's
[1:35:49] happening in the natural God it's
[1:35:51] already happened in the spir
[1:35:53] Supernatural because that way God is
[1:35:56] also bringing his people to the Capstone
[1:35:59] amen that's it he's bringing his people
[1:36:01] the Capstone to the maturity of the

[1:36:06] all from justification sanctification
[1:36:10] the baptism of the Holy Spirit the
[1:36:12] adoption itself that's right that's it

[1:57:13] God to dwell inside of me that where
[1:57:15] Solutions come that where you have that

[1:57:22] God when you are shut in with God Amen
[1:57:25] when you communicate with God from the

[1:59:37] time of
[1:59:38] adoptions time of maturity that's
[1:59:40] rightly God
[1:59:43] dwelling in his
[1:59:47] Believers that that's so simple but
[1:59:49] that's so true that's right that what

[2:00:05] maturity my brothers and
[2:00:07] sisters things are going will happen so
[2:00:12] rapidly so
[2:00:14] rapidly that if you are
[2:00:18] not
[2:00:21] careful if you are not having that
[2:00:24] relationship with God that's the key
[2:00:26] this is the moment amen this is the time

[2:03:55] this
[2:03:55] morning is on time and was intended for
[2:03:59] someone be taken to the heart for the
[2:04:01] scripture says that not one word would
[2:04:03] go forth and fall to the ground that
[2:04:06] every word has an intended resting place
[2:04:11] I would say this morning just take it
[2:04:13] deep in your heart and just say Lord let
[2:04:16] the word let the word find its resting
[2:04:20] place in me uh brother Gideon look up

[2:04:37] not applying to us amen you can be
[2:04:39] filled with the Holy Ghost and they talk
[2:04:41] about repenting it's just a reminder to
[2:04:44] Sons and Daughters of God that I'm not
[2:04:47] going to let that stay in my life I'm
[2:04:48] going to let God weed this out my
[2:04:50] brother and sister you know kind of the
[2:04:52] natural typing the spiritual we don't
[2:04:55] wait until the weeds are big in the
[2:04:57] garden you start when the weeds are
[2:04:59] little and they're easy to remove from
[2:05:02] the garden and these things are easy to
[2:05:05] remove from our life when we start at
[2:05:08] the revelation of that amen and say Lord
[2:05:11] that applied to Me Maybe I had a bitter
[2:05:13] Spirit maybe something's been creeping
[2:05:15] in and I just say myself this morning
