[54:49] here we are
[54:52] blessed when we come here

[55:03] Grace
[55:04] Tabernacle we receive
[55:07] Grace we receive Grace from
[55:10] God the reason I sing I wanted this song
[55:14] is because we want to be in The Presence
[55:16] of
[55:18] Jehovah every day of
[55:21] [Music]
[55:24] life because when you're in The Presence
[55:27] of
[55:28] Jehovah troubles
[55:31] vanish
[55:33] problems go
[55:39] [Music]
[55:42] away just being In The Presence of
[55:44] Jehovah you become a new
[55:47] person that's what we want to be in The
[55:50] Presence of
[55:52] Jehovah and the reason we are here today
[55:54] is because
[55:56] we don't want to be called Christians
[56:00] only it's because we are
[56:05] looking to meet
[56:08] Jesus on that
[56:12] day we we don't want to be just be one
[56:17] of any other
[56:21] church when God called Abraham
[56:26] he called him he wanted to have a
[56:29] peculiar
[56:32] people and and peculiar peculiar means
[56:36] different than the
[56:39] rest so you brother and sister You're A
[56:41] peculiar
[56:42] [Music]
[56:45] people that's why we act
[56:48] different
[56:51] because this is not our home amen
[56:56] I say thank you brother Paul for the
[56:58] confidence once
[57:01] again I always
[57:08] appreciate his love for my family and
[57:13] the church as well

[57:19] [Music]
[57:21] us I'm afraid that one day I might not
[57:24] want to leave this place
[57:26] move here I don't know but you know the
[57:30] good thing
[57:32] is the same God that you serve here is
[57:35] the same God we serve in Tri
[57:38] Cities
[57:40] and half of the congregation that is in
[57:42] tric City send you greetings to you the
[57:45] half is here so praise the Lord uh
[57:49] please continue prayers for us as we
[57:52] continue praying for you amen please
[57:55] before you sit down I know you're going
[57:57] to be sit uh for a little long
[58:02] so I'm not saying I'm going to be here
[58:05] too long so but uh let's go to the Book
[58:08] of
[58:10] Jeremiah thank you sister and
[58:18] brother has been pondering this for a
[58:21] long time I
[58:23] I Jeremiah 2
[58:35] Jeremiah 2 verse
[58:46] 13
[58:49] amen for my people have committed two
[58:53] evils they have forsaken me the Fountain
[58:56] of Living
[58:58] Waters and heal them themselves heal
[59:00] them out
[59:03] ssts broken ssts that can hold no water
[59:08] let's jump to Jeremiah
[59:23] 17133 it reads like this oh Lord the
[59:27] hope of
[59:28] Israel all that forsake the shall be
[59:31] asham and they that depart from me shall
[59:35] be written on the earth because they
[59:38] have forsaken the Lord the Fountain of
[59:41] Living
[59:42] Waters Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
[59:45] this
[59:46] opportunity father we come before you
[59:48] because you are the fountain Living
[59:50] Waters so we want to give we want to
[59:53] drink from you today
[59:56] father we ask you to come and speak to
[59:58] the people this morning help me to set
[1:00:01] aside myself father since I'm a useless
[1:00:05] man father but I just want to be your
[1:00:08] mouthpiece this morning Father so you
[1:00:10] can speak to your children in the name
[1:00:12] of the Lord Jesus amen you may be
[1:00:17] seated once again I want to say thank
[1:00:20] you to all of you for your kindness
[1:00:23] and and love
[1:00:27] towards us and
[1:00:29] I I
[1:00:33] always pray that the Lord help me to set
[1:00:37] aside myself
[1:00:39] because there's nothing good out of me
[1:00:43] but it's God the one who cares for his
[1:00:46] people amen and supplied all our needs
[1:00:50] amen
[1:00:51] amen so here the scripture is is uh
[1:00:56] telling
[1:00:58] us about the is is talking about Israel
[1:01:01] forsaking
[1:01:03] God
[1:01:07] now
[1:01:10] forsaken according to the dictionary is
[1:01:14] to depart
[1:01:15] from Leave
[1:01:18] Behind or live it
[1:01:20] alone
[1:01:22] abandon neglect to let loose
[1:01:26] set free or let
[1:01:29] go so we as human
[1:01:33] beings tend
[1:01:35] to to do
[1:01:37] what our heart leads us to to do but the
[1:01:42] Bible says
[1:01:43] that you can even trust on your heart
[1:01:46] that's
[1:01:50] right I think in Proverbs says as the
[1:01:53] man thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:02:00] and In this passage God is referring to
[1:02:03] the spring of Living
[1:02:05] Water he is the one who supplies all the
[1:02:08] needs to his
[1:02:11] people all people's needs we have read
[1:02:17] we have seen many of us we probably seen
[1:02:19] the Ten Commandments
[1:02:23] movie and how we we see the the the the
[1:02:26] the the lord gave to Moses the
[1:02:29] instructions he gave to Moses
[1:02:32] promises that he was going to
[1:02:37] fulfill and this journey was going to be
[1:02:39] a short
[1:02:40] Journey but because of the hardness of
[1:02:43] the heart of the people it turned
[1:02:47] into a
[1:02:50] generation now it's God's fault no it's
[1:02:52] not God's fault right it's because we
[1:02:55] have the the the free
[1:02:59] will you have the free
[1:03:01] will you willingly are here
[1:03:05] today or someone came here in
[1:03:08] handcuffs no
[1:03:11] one is your free will now the people of
[1:03:15] Israel they had the free will to trust
[1:03:18] in what Moses was
[1:03:21] saying but it's very difficult to trust
[1:03:24] a man to trust another man
[1:03:28] especially when when when you think you
[1:03:30] know
[1:03:31] most when you think you know everything
[1:03:33] right oh I read the Bible from cover to
[1:03:36] cover and and
[1:03:38] and I know the Bible yeah my brother R
[1:03:41] says do you know the author of The
[1:03:44] Bible that's the difference because a
[1:03:47] theologian can Comm and and and
[1:03:50] and recite the Bible to you from cover
[1:03:53] to
[1:03:53] cover but that doesn't mean
[1:03:58] you're getting out of something out of
[1:04:01] God because the word of God has to be
[1:04:04] revealed to you that's
[1:04:06] right the Revelation is the one is
[1:04:09] taking it taking you
[1:04:13] out from
[1:04:17] the pit of Mighty clay
[1:04:24] or you know you know Revelation is the
[1:04:26] one took my mom out of the
[1:04:32] Catholicism I was talking to a guy this
[1:04:34] week and I didn't finish the
[1:04:37] conversation I have to when I get back I
[1:04:40] have to take it take that conversation
[1:04:43] again because he was saying how come you
[1:04:46] he knows my brother how come your your
[1:04:48] brother is Catholic you're a
[1:04:52] Christian I said because he didn't go to
[1:04:56] to church when your
[1:04:59] mom started going to Christian church
[1:05:02] and say he was here by the time my mom
[1:05:05] start going to a Christian
[1:05:08] Church I said but how come you
[1:05:13] guys well I say you have to have
[1:05:18] Revelation and a lot of people a lot of
[1:05:20] Catholic people I hope not I'm not
[1:05:22] offend anyone today but a lot of
[1:05:24] Catholic people are Catholics choose by
[1:05:28] tradition my my my grand Grandpa was
[1:05:31] Catholic my grand great grandpa was and
[1:05:35] so on so and
[1:05:37] so what is the
[1:05:39] Revelation
[1:05:42] right and you know what we can become
[1:05:45] Christians just by tradition too right
[1:05:47] that's right absolutely the moment we
[1:05:50] start just
[1:05:53] letting letting ourselves be guide by
[1:05:59] someone and not going to the Fountain of
[1:06:02] Living
[1:06:03] Water which is the word of
[1:06:08] God we become traditional Christians
[1:06:13] there's there's a lot of people out
[1:06:14] there they call themselves
[1:06:18] Christians I know a lot of
[1:06:22] them but that's not the point amen
[1:06:39] God is refer to as the spring of Living
[1:06:42] Water who his people have abandoned
[1:06:45] tried to do things their own way how
[1:06:47] many times we tried to do things our own
[1:06:48] way how did I worked it
[1:06:52] out I heard many people the backslide
[1:06:56] and then when they come back they say
[1:06:58] you know
[1:06:59] what I'm not the same
[1:07:03] person because I got
[1:07:07] hurt the
[1:07:09] wounds that I got and then the scars
[1:07:12] stay there
[1:07:16] forever so it doesn't work out
[1:07:20] good when you abandon
[1:07:23] God they tried to do their their own way
[1:07:26] by digging their own sisters and turning
[1:07:29] away from the god this passage shows
[1:07:32] that God gave his people everything they
[1:07:35] needed yes right and he's the same God
[1:07:37] today he is the one who's given us the
[1:07:39] same the the the same
[1:07:42] promises whatever you
[1:07:44] need you have need
[1:07:47] of I heard a testimony of um uh American
[1:07:51] guy
[1:07:53] who the age of 13 15 start getting into
[1:08:00] trouble back and forth
[1:08:04] prison and finally when he did really
[1:08:08] really bad things that he deserved life
[1:08:12] sentence he got into in
[1:08:16] Max
[1:08:19] prison and in that prison he met a a
[1:08:23] guy and this guy guy was the son of a
[1:08:30] pastor so he knew he knew about God in
[1:08:34] his
[1:08:36] youth mom was praying for
[1:08:39] him dad was praying for
[1:08:42] him but he never
[1:08:45] listened he went out and and get
[1:08:49] involved with
[1:08:53] friends he got him in trouble
[1:08:56] so he gave his heart impr prison to
[1:09:02] God this Sons this pastor sons was his
[1:09:07] Pastor there in
[1:09:10] prison so everybody knew that he was
[1:09:15] going to be a life sentence he wasn't
[1:09:18] sentenced yet but for what he did I
[1:09:21] don't remember what he did
[1:09:25] certainly was going to be a life
[1:09:27] sentence and even the
[1:09:30] the
[1:09:32] cellmate or the guard whatever they call
[1:09:34] it there he
[1:09:37] said I don't know what you did or I
[1:09:41] don't know what happened to
[1:09:43] you but you're going to be a free man in
[1:09:46] a
[1:09:49] week even himself was in shocked
[1:09:56] when he gave his heart to
[1:09:59] God that's that's the kind of God we
[1:10:01] serve
[1:10:03] right and and when he gave his heart to
[1:10:06] God he said Lord I want to do whatever
[1:10:09] you called me to
[1:10:12] do and here that man was thinking is I'm
[1:10:15] going to be in prison all my
[1:10:18] life but you know what happened to
[1:10:22] him he went free
[1:10:28] in prison learned
[1:10:32] Spanish he moved to Mexico
[1:10:35] City and he had over 100
[1:10:39] churches as he's overseeing over
[1:10:44] there see that's the kind of God we
[1:10:47] serve when you stay faithful to him
[1:10:52] because God is not going
[1:10:54] to let you
[1:10:56] go he's always there for you amen his
[1:11:00] people the the Israel
[1:11:04] people
[1:11:06] they they
[1:11:08] had
[1:11:10] evidence what God did for them the
[1:11:14] mighty
[1:11:16] hand brought them out of
[1:11:21] Egypt but they
[1:11:23] forget yeah
[1:11:26] because we as humans we easily to forget
[1:11:28] the good things oh but someone does
[1:11:32] something wrong to us we never
[1:11:36] forget we have really good memory for
[1:11:38] those
[1:11:41] things you help
[1:11:44] someone they probably say thank you at
[1:11:46] the moment but he'll forget about what
[1:11:49] you what good you did for
[1:11:52] him oh but he comes back and asks you
[1:11:54] for help and you say sorry I can't he
[1:11:57] will never forget
[1:11:59] that that's a
[1:12:02] humankind what can you do about it only
[1:12:05] God can change those kind of
[1:12:10] Hearts let's continue here brother
[1:12:13] Branham and the broken sister says well
[1:12:15] we notice that think about sisters that
[1:12:18] is different from a well sister will get
[1:12:24] empty see one
[1:12:26] day running around away from
[1:12:30] God you will find out that you have
[1:12:33] nothing you'll find out that you're
[1:12:36] nothing you'll find out that you're
[1:12:39] you're you're always searching for
[1:12:41] something and that's something you can't
[1:12:43] find it out
[1:12:46] there you can really you can rely upon s
[1:12:49] a
[1:12:50] sister he has to rely on depend depend
[1:12:54] on on the
[1:12:56] rains because if if there is rain you
[1:12:58] have water in your sister if there is no
[1:13:00] rain your sister is
[1:13:06] empty depend upon the rains that fall in
[1:13:09] the summer or winter whatever it is
[1:13:11] usually in the winter time when the snow
[1:13:15] and rain
[1:13:16] comes then he runs water off of the
[1:13:20] SST he doesn't get water on its own
[1:13:27] and one at one point it's going to
[1:13:32] dry
[1:13:35] so if you leave that water set
[1:13:40] there you cannot drink that water
[1:13:44] anymore because frogs can get in lizards
[1:13:49] can get in
[1:13:51] snakes but a Fountain of Living Water is
[1:13:54] always coming out out clean in pure
[1:13:58] water you know when we lived in
[1:14:02] the in
[1:14:05] the jungle per se over there when I was
[1:14:08] a kid we had a a
[1:14:12] well but it wasn't a well like here that
[1:14:15] you have pump and all nice and fancy
[1:14:17] things or this this one war with
[1:14:20] gravity for some reason wasn't the up in
[1:14:23] the mountain
[1:14:26] inside the Rocks there was a
[1:14:29] little water fountain
[1:14:32] there so my
[1:14:35] parents they built a little bit of a a
[1:14:39] pond there when we we got we put some uh
[1:14:44] cloth like filtered water cloth in the
[1:14:48] in the hose and that water went by
[1:14:50] gravity all the way to the
[1:14:52] house and tastes good
[1:14:56] because we protected we covered that
[1:14:59] pond with
[1:15:01] with some kind of protection that
[1:15:06] it but there were some times when we had
[1:15:09] to
[1:15:10] work away from that area we couldn't
[1:15:12] have access to that
[1:15:16] water and we have to drink water from
[1:15:20] the
[1:15:22] creeks and some some some of this water
[1:15:25] it wasn't running water
[1:15:27] anymore it didn't taste the
[1:15:31] same
[1:15:34] why because was is Target
[1:15:36] water sat
[1:15:39] there he sat there for I don't know how
[1:15:42] long and it just tastes
[1:15:45] bad sometimes you see a little bit
[1:15:48] of I don't know how you call it that it
[1:15:50] has a little protection on top of the
[1:15:53] water you had to blow it out to separate
[1:15:56] that protection that water had and and
[1:15:58] drink I mean it was nasty water but I
[1:16:01] mean when you're
[1:16:04] thirst now I understand what David was
[1:16:08] talking
[1:16:10] about as the deer panted for the
[1:16:15] waters you know that's that's the kind
[1:16:17] of thirst we have to have for
[1:16:21] God because we understand that when when
[1:16:24] when we we lean to
[1:16:28] God he's going to be there to supply us
[1:16:31] every
[1:16:33] need in John 4 Jesus talking to the
[1:16:36] woman
[1:16:38] says if you know the gift of God and who
[1:16:44] it is that say to thee give me to
[1:16:51] drink you will ask for him and he will
[1:16:55] give you the living
[1:16:57] water and you know this woman as any any
[1:17:00] other human being is just thinking about
[1:17:04] carnal the first thing you say oh give
[1:17:06] me that water so I don't have to come
[1:17:08] here in the middle of the day with this
[1:17:11] heat I don't want to have to be exposed
[1:17:13] to the people that judging me all the
[1:17:15] time because the kind of life I
[1:17:19] have give me that
[1:17:21] water and other thing she said is says
[1:17:24] how you going to get it if if you don't
[1:17:26] have anything to draw the water out
[1:17:31] from Revelation that's right brother
[1:17:35] says what Jesus was doing there he was
[1:17:37] trying to get in touch with her spirit
[1:17:40] that's
[1:17:46] right and Isaiah 12:3 says therefore
[1:17:49] with joy shall ye draw water out of the
[1:17:52] wells of salvation amen I
[1:17:56] I my point here brother and sister is
[1:17:59] that there is no business for us out
[1:18:04] there you have no business out there
[1:18:07] that's right many people can come to you
[1:18:10] and try especially to the the young
[1:18:13] people they can come and talk to them or
[1:18:15] you're wasting your youth
[1:18:17] there you're I mean you have no
[1:18:21] life it's quite the opposite all right
[1:18:25] when you stay close to God you have
[1:18:32] life how do I know
[1:18:40] that listen Jesus in Matthew told the
[1:18:42] disciples not to go to Samaria
[1:18:46] remember but in this
[1:18:50] passage the Bible says that he needed to
[1:18:55] go
[1:18:56] through
[1:19:01] Samaria and these
[1:19:05] people they had a
[1:19:09] mixed belief the way they believe was a
[1:19:12] mix between
[1:19:14] idols and
[1:19:19] God although the road through Samaria
[1:19:22] was the shortest rout from Jerusalem to
[1:19:24] Galilee
[1:19:26] Pious Jews often
[1:19:29] avoided they did so because there was a
[1:19:32] deep distrust and dislike between many
[1:19:36] of the Jewish people and the
[1:19:39] Samaritans brother and sister that
[1:19:41] Spirit hasn't died yet that's
[1:19:45] right how
[1:19:47] many even message Believers are so
[1:19:52] legalist right
[1:19:56] but we have to understand
[1:20:00] that
[1:20:02] Holiness is one thing and legalist is
[1:20:06] another thing a legalist can be very
[1:20:09] legalist and things he can live
[1:20:13] for but he's weak in another way yeah
[1:20:18] good and because he's weak in another
[1:20:21] way he will never touch those points
[1:20:23] that's right
[1:20:27] see what I'm saying but
[1:20:30] Holiness is from A to
[1:20:35] Z sometimes it hurts it hurts us to live
[1:20:39] a holy
[1:20:40] life but if it's that what it is is
[1:20:44] required let it
[1:20:47] come so when the Assyrians conquer the
[1:20:49] Northern Kingdom of
[1:20:51] Israel they exhile almost all the Jews
[1:20:54] population removing them from the land
[1:20:57] all they left behind were lowest class
[1:21:00] of
[1:21:02] society 136 years later Babylon
[1:21:05] conquered the southern Kingdom of Judah
[1:21:08] and followed similar policy this ones
[1:21:10] left behind intermated with other
[1:21:14] non-jewish people who slowly came into
[1:21:16] region and the Samaritans emerged as an
[1:21:21] ethnic and religious group because the
[1:21:24] Mars had a
[1:21:25] historical connection to the people of
[1:21:28] Israel their faith was a combination of
[1:21:31] commands and rituals from the law of
[1:21:33] Moses put together with various
[1:21:36] superstitions most of the Jews in Jesus
[1:21:39] time despise them diserens disliking
[1:21:42] them even more than Gentiles because
[1:21:45] they were religious speaking half breeds
[1:21:49] who had an
[1:21:51] ethnic monog faith that Sam martinus
[1:21:54] build own Temple to Jehovah and the
[1:21:57] mountain jerim but the Jews turn it
[1:22:01] around in 128 BC this obviously made
[1:22:04] relations between Jews and Samar even
[1:22:06] worse but remember that what the
[1:22:08] religious Jewish people they always were
[1:22:12] trying to find the
[1:22:14] sin in
[1:22:19] others and when Jesus
[1:22:22] came he sat down with
[1:22:27] adulterers
[1:22:31] lepers
[1:22:34] publicans and all the eyes of the the
[1:22:37] senat there the priests and and and
[1:22:39] Pharisees and SES they were in Jesus
[1:22:43] look what he's doing he was just trying
[1:22:46] if they were not there they sent
[1:22:50] spies because when he healed the the the
[1:22:53] Blind Men
[1:22:55] the Bible says that people went to the
[1:22:58] Pharisees and Sadducees to tell them
[1:23:04] right
[1:23:06] and they come to confront
[1:23:09] him things that they will never be able
[1:23:12] to do
[1:23:14] right because they were full of
[1:23:18] religion but they never understood that
[1:23:22] the Living Word
[1:23:26] was made
[1:23:29] flesh the word of God was made flesh and
[1:23:32] was walking among
[1:23:34] them now when the when the when the word
[1:23:37] of God
[1:23:39] comes to people's
[1:23:42] hearts that heart is
[1:23:45] changed that heart is has to be changed
[1:23:49] because that's a
[1:23:50] promise brother BR says you cannot be
[1:23:53] the same person when you have an
[1:23:54] experience with the Lord Jesus
[1:23:57] Christ there is no
[1:24:00] way I mean there that that doesn't means
[1:24:03] he's going
[1:24:04] to uh take you up here so you don't
[1:24:10] stumble no we're still going to have
[1:24:12] fights struggles in
[1:24:14] life but you know what because that seed
[1:24:17] that is in your heart that's
[1:24:19] right that Fountain of Living Water is
[1:24:22] still there in your heart you stumbl you
[1:24:25] get
[1:24:26] up Shake
[1:24:28] Yourself get
[1:24:37] up he charged his disciples not to enter
[1:24:40] into any city of the samans in Matthew
[1:24:43] 10:5 you know the other thing I and this
[1:24:47] is probably just
[1:24:50] me but when Jesus went to meet this
[1:24:53] woman
[1:24:56] like I say forgive me if I'm wrong
[1:24:59] but I believe that the reason he sent
[1:25:01] the the disciples ahead to the city to
[1:25:04] buy
[1:25:06] groceries because the disciples were not
[1:25:09] been born yet right they were not born
[1:25:12] again
[1:25:14] yet and they were
[1:25:17] judgmental that's right so Jesus
[1:25:20] couldn't have the Liberty to speak to
[1:25:22] the heart of that woman
[1:25:25] yeah surrounded
[1:25:27] by Jewish Jewish people his disciples
[1:25:32] were
[1:25:33] Jewish and they were excited about the
[1:25:35] things that Jesus was doing
[1:25:37] but seeing him talking to this
[1:25:42] woman I can say forgive me if I'm wrong
[1:25:46] but Jesus wanted to have a
[1:25:49] heart-to-heart
[1:25:51] conversation that's what he's looking
[1:25:53] for you today that's right he wants to
[1:25:56] have a heart-to- heart conversation with
[1:26:00] you otherwise everything is going to
[1:26:03] pass
[1:26:05] right so the moment when the when the
[1:26:08] disciples were
[1:26:10] coming by that
[1:26:12] time she already
[1:26:18] received and she drop the water thing on
[1:26:21] the floor and run away
[1:26:24] because she received the Revelation that
[1:26:28] some finally someone didn't judge
[1:26:33] her someone loved
[1:26:37] her and remember this other woman he he
[1:26:40] pardon he said go and see no
[1:26:43] more so
[1:26:46] that's that's that's what he wants from
[1:26:50] you he wants you not to continue the
[1:26:53] same kind of
[1:26:54] life and you know these groups that are
[1:26:58] raising up these
[1:26:59] days oh don't judge me because I'm
[1:27:02] dressed like this I'm dressed like
[1:27:06] that the other day someone came up and
[1:27:09] say I feel like I'm a
[1:27:12] robot so I identify myself as a
[1:27:16] robot and then they ask her say so when
[1:27:20] you get sick you go to a shop or you go
[1:27:23] to a doctor
[1:27:25] see they're messed up
[1:27:29] here they're messed up and they don't
[1:27:32] know what to
[1:27:34] do that's the reason we are called to
[1:27:38] return Amen to the word of
[1:27:42] God we have to return to the Fountain of
[1:27:45] Living Water
[1:27:55] in John 7:37
[1:28:24] in the last
[1:28:27] day that great day of the feast Jesus
[1:28:30] stood up cried saying if any man thirst
[1:28:34] let him come unto me and
[1:28:38] drink he that belied on me as the
[1:28:41] scripture had
[1:28:43] said out of his belly shall flow rivers
[1:28:46] of living
[1:28:49] water thank you Lord so what are you
[1:28:51] doing here
[1:28:54] you are here to come fill up of this
[1:28:57] living
[1:28:58] water when that woman received that
[1:29:00] living water on
[1:29:02] her she wasn't the
[1:29:06] same she want and witness come and
[1:29:11] see this
[1:29:15] man that told me the kind of life I I
[1:29:21] live but he didn't condemn me
[1:29:26] he forgive me he loved
[1:29:32] me so it's hard for
[1:29:37] us to understand everybody's lives
[1:29:41] because we don't know what this their
[1:29:43] struggles
[1:29:46] are but you focus in your problem and
[1:29:49] they focus in their problems
[1:29:52] amen and when you when I say you focus
[1:29:55] on your problem is you bring your
[1:29:57] problem to Jesus
[1:30:01] Christ and he's the one who's going to
[1:30:03] give
[1:30:05] you
[1:30:08] the answer to your
[1:30:15] problem we see many
[1:30:18] people with struggles in
[1:30:22] life because because they just haven't
[1:30:24] surrendered their heart to
[1:30:26] God and even though we know we know the
[1:30:29] the the
[1:30:34] prescription we just don't go go out and
[1:30:37] and fill it
[1:30:39] up or sometimes we we got the the
[1:30:41] medicine and we refuse to take
[1:30:45] it
[1:30:48] why it's
[1:30:50] because people have a a happy
[1:30:54] life a temporary
[1:30:59] life but don't don't don't don't
[1:31:02] understand that at some point everything
[1:31:04] in this world will have an
[1:31:08] end so we
[1:31:12] have a very good life
[1:31:16] yes but it's a temporary
[1:31:21] life you know
[1:31:25] I been taking my kids to work these days
[1:31:29] and we're
[1:31:31] doing hanging doors and casing and
[1:31:35] baseboard and I say you guys do the the
[1:31:37] baseboard because my knees
[1:31:41] hurt and they're young they can go under
[1:31:44] their knees and get up and up and down
[1:31:47] up and down they're
[1:31:49] young but you know what that doesn't
[1:31:51] last
[1:31:52] forever I know for
[1:31:58] fact it doesn't last forever that's
[1:32:01] right so the same way you go
[1:32:05] out leave
[1:32:08] God you might have a good
[1:32:12] life but it's not going to last forever
[1:32:14] that's
[1:32:15] right at some point in
[1:32:20] life you're going to start missing
[1:32:25] the
[1:32:26] food and I'm not talking about your
[1:32:28] mom's
[1:32:31] food remember the prodigal son he
[1:32:36] remember he the Bible says he came into
[1:32:39] his
[1:32:43] sense so when you go out you leave God
[1:32:45] you're out of your mind simple as
[1:32:50] that people like the way they act
[1:32:52] because they're out of their mind
[1:32:56] amen because the Bible said it and this
[1:32:59] man being living far
[1:33:02] away he came into his hands what I'm
[1:33:05] doing
[1:33:07] here have you H have you lost conscience
[1:33:11] at least
[1:33:13] once I I did
[1:33:17] once I hit my head really
[1:33:20] hard and I just I the last thing I I
[1:33:23] remember was everything went
[1:33:26] black then when I came back I was
[1:33:29] like where am
[1:33:34] I when I came back to my sense that's
[1:33:37] right so this prodal son said what what
[1:33:41] I'm doing here eating from the pig's
[1:33:47] food when when I have everything
[1:33:51] there I never beg for good when I was in
[1:33:54] my house in my father's
[1:33:58] house and you know the the way the
[1:34:02] scripture the the way that we read the
[1:34:04] scripture most of the time we we focus
[1:34:06] and the bad things that
[1:34:09] this boy
[1:34:12] did and and we lost track of the
[1:34:15] religious brother that he
[1:34:22] had brother BR says there is no worse
[1:34:26] Spirit than a religious
[1:34:32] spirit so we have to pray
[1:34:36] hard so we don't get that
[1:34:41] cover of religion that's
[1:34:45] it we don't want to be that
[1:34:51] right you know
[1:34:54] I appreciate more a guy who comes and
[1:34:57] says I'm messed
[1:34:59] up I'm really messed
[1:35:02] up I know what I've been doing is
[1:35:05] wrong but I can't help it please pray
[1:35:08] for me I want to go back home
[1:35:16] amen than a religious person all popped
[1:35:20] up
[1:35:23] God help
[1:35:30] us Isaiah
[1:35:46] 58 verse 11
[1:35:57] and the Lord shall guide
[1:35:59] thee continually and satisfy thy soul in
[1:36:04] drought and make fat thy bones and those
[1:36:09] shall be like water garden and like a
[1:36:13] spring of water whose Waters fail not
[1:36:19] amen so we have all the medicine here
[1:36:23] what are you doing over there wandering
[1:36:29] around God
[1:36:32] is you know I
[1:36:37] heard when God wanted to plant a a
[1:36:42] tree he talked to the
[1:36:47] Earth and he wanted to create a fish he
[1:36:49] talked to the water produce the water
[1:36:53] produce the
[1:36:55] Earth but when when when he was going to
[1:36:59] create the man he talked to himself
[1:37:02] that's right let us
[1:37:08] make
[1:37:10] so the Earth without tree still
[1:37:16] Earth the ocean with a fish still an
[1:37:20] ocean
[1:37:23] god without man he's still God but a man
[1:37:27] without God is
[1:37:30] nothing so you plunk out a tree from the
[1:37:33] earth he going to die you take a fish
[1:37:35] from the ocean it's going to die so what
[1:37:40] are we doing up there wandering around
[1:37:43] that's right experiencing new
[1:37:46] things that you're going to regret down
[1:37:49] the
[1:37:50] road no you have no business over there
[1:37:53] that's right that's
[1:37:57] right right think in
[1:38:03] James let me see if I can find the
[1:38:05] scripture
[1:38:09] here but he
[1:38:11] says come

[1:39:21] this
[1:39:23] the food of the
[1:39:25] Kingdom he knew what was good for him

[1:43:56] disciples well when disciples came and
[1:43:58] say are you going to eat he says I
[1:44:02] already ate that's
[1:44:06] right and they said where what what did

[1:44:19] eat just take it to the physical to your
[1:44:23] physical
[1:44:24] body you quit
[1:44:27] eating see what
[1:44:29] happens the first sign some of us we
[1:44:31] turn bad mood oh
[1:44:36] amen well it doesn't do any good if you
[1:44:40] quit
[1:44:42] eating so just bring it to the spiritual
[1:44:44] you quit eating spiritual
[1:44:50] food I mean
[1:44:53] I I don't even want to go there
[1:44:59] but I'm closing with this Revelations
[1:45:02] 216
[1:45:23] and he said unto me it is done I am
[1:45:28] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[1:45:31] end I'll give to him that is a thirst of
[1:45:37] the Fountain of Water of Life freely
[1:45:43] amen he that overcometh shall inherit
[1:45:46] all things and I will be his God and he
[1:45:50] shall be my son
[1:45:53] so what do you need what is your need
[1:45:57] today
[1:46:00] right he's there to supply every
[1:46:04] need we
[1:46:07] need all all we need to do is come to
[1:46:12] him all you need to do is go to
[1:46:16] him he's there waiting for
[1:46:18] you he was there waiting for that woman
[1:46:24] you know when he was getting I believe
[1:46:27] was getting to
[1:46:31] Jerusalem he was walking in multitude of
[1:46:37] people putting pressure on him and and
[1:46:40] rubbing his shoulders against him
[1:46:43] and and there was one
[1:46:49] touch that woman
[1:46:55] you know
[1:46:58] that this woman in his in her
[1:47:02] situation she was despised by the Jews
[1:47:06] right rejected that's
[1:47:10] right cuz just a woman and in her period
[1:47:14] for the
[1:47:16] Jews you have to stay away from
[1:47:19] her so having this issue for so many
[1:47:23] years for her poor
[1:47:28] soul
[1:47:33] so she she felt so
[1:47:38] impure and
[1:47:40] unworthy to come
[1:47:43] before the
[1:47:47] master and she said if I just
[1:47:50] touch cuz I'm not worthy to perceive
[1:47:52] send myself in front of
[1:47:55] him if I just
[1:47:58] touch the edge of the Carmen that's
[1:48:02] right because all her life was she was
[1:48:05] being rejected by the
[1:48:09] Jews religious
[1:48:15] Jews and I believe she
[1:48:18] heard about this man the things he was
[1:48:21] doing
[1:48:24] isn't that Faith come by
[1:48:26] hearing and hearing the word of
[1:48:28] God well she heard
[1:48:34] news and praise God for that because
[1:48:36] back then there was no WhatsApp no
[1:48:38] Instagram no nothing like
[1:48:40] that so she had to hear from mouth
[1:48:44] that's right to
[1:48:47] ear isn't that
[1:48:49] amazing is not amazing when when you are
[1:48:54] in the deepest whole just just think a
[1:48:56] little bit about her
[1:48:59] situation how uncomfortable for
[1:49:02] her and not only being uncomfortable to
[1:49:06] herself but the rejection of all the
[1:49:10] people because I believe not only the
[1:49:12] man was treating it her bad but the
[1:49:16] woman
[1:49:17] too I mean there's all kinds of people
[1:49:21] three kinds of Believers brother br
[1:49:24] says but there was with this man and he
[1:49:28] and she thinking herself oh he's going
[1:49:31] to judge me so if I just touch the edge
[1:49:34] of the
[1:49:38] Garment what a
[1:49:41] difference so if you come to Jesus
[1:49:43] Christ your will never be rejected
[1:49:45] that's right you're not going to be
[1:49:50] judged he's going to come
[1:49:54] you're going to come to him he's going
[1:49:55] to wait for you with open
[1:49:58] arms welcome home my son amen welcome
