[17:09] i would just like to stop right now and
[17:13] take a moment just to pray for their
[17:15] andrea
[17:17] you know this is a very serious thing in
[17:19] the day that we live in right and
[17:22] we we just believe that our healing has
[17:26] already been purchased by his stripes we
[17:28] are healed
[17:29] and we just stand upon that and we as a
[17:32] body of believers are here for one
[17:34] another to lift
[17:35] these things to the lord so i want to
[17:38] just take that moment and lift this need
[17:40] that our sister felt led to share and
[17:43] and we want to just lift it up
[17:45] heavenly father we come before you this
[17:47] evening lord knowing
[17:49] that truly father by your stripes we are
[17:52] healed lord there is not one affliction
[17:55] father that is exempt from this as you
[17:57] spoke to the prophet
[17:58] and told him if he could get the people
[18:00] to believe that cancer would not even
[18:02] stand in his way
[18:03] lord and we know this was the spoken
[18:05] word the thus saith the lord coming
[18:07] forth
[18:08] now lord your word says that our healing
[18:11] has already been purchased
[18:13] and so lord we would just lift uh andrea
[18:16] up before you father
[18:18] lord that you would just come down
[18:20] father you know the situation you know
[18:22] the need
[18:23] you know every circumstance about it and
[18:26] so
[18:26] father we fully commit this healing lord
[18:29] to
[18:29] you and lord just believing father that
[18:32] you would just
[18:33] as your perfect will would be manifested
[18:35] bring forth lord your desire
[18:38] lord we know as the prophet has clearly
[18:40] showed us
[18:41] we pray for life and lord commit all
[18:44] things to you
[18:45] we ask father that you would deal kindly
[18:46] with the family
[18:48] kindly with this uh lady lord father we
[18:51] just asked now in the name of jesus
[18:54] christ
[18:54] amen amen and amen and amen
[18:58] hallelujah well thank you god bless you
[19:01] um
[19:01] just want to go this evening to uh
[19:05] the preparations of the inner man i
[19:07] would like to go into as it would be
[19:09] part
[19:10] three and i would like to speak to you
[19:12] tonight
[19:13] on the value of the soul now we know the
[19:16] word says that one soul is worth ten
[19:19] thousand worlds
[19:20] but my brother and sister what god
[19:22] places as a value we
[19:24] ourselves have to come to a place we
[19:26] place a value
[19:28] so it is here that in the maintenance as
[19:30] it were
[19:31] of of anything in life uh just talking
[19:34] to a gentleman today
[19:36] you cannot ignore something for years
[19:40] sometimes even months and expect it to
[19:42] remain the same
[19:44] so we just want to look as we know the
[19:47] time is
[19:47] is coming nigh we're looking at the
[19:50] preparation of the inner man
[19:53] knowing that there is a season as we'll
[19:54] touch on in a few minutes
[19:57] knowing there's a season a time uh the
[19:59] scripture
[20:00] says that he would come our lord jesus
[20:02] would come
[20:03] as a thief in the night and so
[20:06] we just want to be prepared for that day
[20:09] let's just stand for a moment a very
[20:11] short scripture reading in matthew
[20:15] and matthew 16 and starting with verse
[20:19] 25
[20:20] we'll take our thought from this for
[20:24] whosoever will save his life
[20:27] shall lose it and whosoever will lose
[20:30] his life for my
[20:31] sake shall find it for what is a man
[20:35] profited if he shall gain the whole
[20:37] world and lose his own soul
[20:40] or what shall a man give in exchange
[20:43] for his soul amen we'll just uh
[20:48] we'll stop right there for the moment so
[20:51] we'll just well we'll go ahead in verse
[20:55] 27
[20:56] excuse me for the son of man shall come
[20:58] in the glory of his father with his
[20:59] angels
[21:00] then he shall reward every man according
[21:03] to his works heavenly father lord we
[21:06] thank you tonight for your grace and for
[21:08] your mercy
[21:09] your hand upon each and every one of us
[21:12] lord for we know father as we look back
[21:14] and the saints of old
[21:16] through the dark ages lord through the
[21:18] trying times of history
[21:20] lord that uh the prophet of god clearly
[21:23] showed us that when the persecution
[21:25] come upon the church and lord we're not
[21:27] saying we're persecuted but certainly
[21:30] father there is uh circumstances that
[21:32] make it difficult
[21:33] but in the times of difficulty lord that
[21:36] it's
[21:37] always caused your people to get more
[21:39] fervent and lord i pray
[21:41] father that our hearts would just be
[21:42] burning within us
[21:44] regardless lord i would rather be able
[21:46] to look out as it were tonight
[21:48] right here in our midst but lord we're
[21:51] together
[21:52] and father i ask you just to stir the
[21:54] hearts of your saints tonight in your
[21:56] precious name
[21:57] amen you may be seated amen
[22:02] you know as we take our our thought
[22:04] tonight from verse 26 what is a man
[22:07] profited if he shall gain the whole
[22:09] world and lose his own soul
[22:11] or what shall a man give in exchange for
[22:13] his soul
[22:14] and this word profited means to
[22:18] gain or to benefit so what is it that a
[22:21] man would gain or benefit if he gains
[22:23] the world and loses his soul
[22:25] we live in a very materialistic age my
[22:28] brother and sister and
[22:29] and i think it afflicts all of us uh
[22:32] some maybe worse than others over
[22:34] over the years over time we just collect
[22:37] little things that have
[22:38] value to us sometimes it's nothing more
[22:41] than sentimental value
[22:43] and so in this very materialistic age
[22:46] that we live in
[22:47] uh we we would find that it fits or kind
[22:50] of falls into
[22:52] uh satan's plan of distraction because
[22:55] we would understand that the more that
[22:57] we have the more
[22:58] attention uh that we uh have to give it
[23:02] and uh so the more attention it requires
[23:05] and so as we would catch the things in
[23:07] this life
[23:09] we have a house we have a land we have
[23:11] cars we have these
[23:13] these possessions as it were and uh
[23:16] all of this requires attention and as i
[23:19] was speaking to a man today
[23:22] and he was talking about a property not
[23:25] being taken
[23:26] care of for 25 years and you realize you
[23:30] can't ignore as it were a house or a
[23:32] property for 25 years
[23:34] and expected to stay in pristine
[23:37] uh condition and uh you know as we were
[23:40] in this conversation it touched me that
[23:42] as sons and daughters of god we cannot
[23:45] ignore
[23:46] our spiritual house and expect it to be
[23:50] in pristine
[23:51] condition we we have to give care to
[23:54] that house and
[23:55] as a natural house has to have a good
[23:57] foundation
[23:58] and needs a good roof and and if you
[24:00] have a good foundation and a good roof
[24:03] mostly everything between it will remain
[24:05] in decent condition
[24:07] but the storms of life the the weather
[24:10] all of these conditions would be
[24:12] constantly taking a
[24:14] toll and so as it is uh we can look and
[24:17] uh you know back in my days
[24:19] uh of when i was in construction work i
[24:22] i had painted a house one time and
[24:24] and the folks went uh uh 20
[24:27] 22 i believe it was years before they
[24:30] painted their house again and
[24:32] you know they jokingly was talking about
[24:34] how much money it saved them
[24:36] but they did not look at the toll that
[24:39] it had taken
[24:40] upon the house itself and so we look at
[24:43] that my brother and sister
[24:45] we want to make sure that we expend you
[24:48] might say the energy and the time
[24:50] to maintain as it were a natural house
[24:53] but we want more than uh uh more than
[24:57] all or more than uh we would desire to
[25:00] to look at this spiritual house and make
[25:03] sure that
[25:04] day by day week by week month by month
[25:07] year by year as it is
[25:09] a time carrying on you know and when you
[25:12] think about that and the prophet of god
[25:14] now we do not question what what god has
[25:16] in store
[25:17] god's plans are perfect but you know the
[25:20] prophet of god
[25:20] makes a statement he says there's
[25:22] nothing left but the rapture
[25:25] but my brother and sister that was many
[25:27] many years ago and
[25:29] and so if we had ignored those that have
[25:32] been around those that come as children
[25:34] those coming through the years if we
[25:36] ignore the spiritual house
[25:37] and time continues to go on we could
[25:40] very well my brother and sister i don't
[25:42] see it
[25:43] but we could very well be facing another
[25:46] you know year or five or ten uh
[25:50] before the coming of the lord we don't
[25:51] know but you know what i don't want to
[25:54] know that the lord is coming tomorrow
[25:56] and my house is in disrepair i want my
[25:59] house to be taken
[26:00] care of i want it to be presentable i
[26:03] want it to be what god ordained it to be
[26:06] amen so we must give the house
[26:09] as it were the attention that it
[26:11] requires
[26:13] now as humans uh we are not of
[26:16] infinite resources we are not uh uh
[26:19] given we have uh just the same amount of
[26:22] time as it were
[26:23] every day has just 24 hours
[26:26] my brother and sister so we do not have
[26:29] an infinite
[26:30] resource of time and the time that we
[26:33] have the scripture says that we should
[26:35] redeem
[26:36] that time and if we are redeeming that
[26:39] time then that means that
[26:41] the portion of time that god would
[26:43] desire
[26:44] for a son or daughter of god to be
[26:46] allotted to
[26:47] the upkeep and the care of the spiritual
[26:50] house
[26:50] that we would devote that time that
[26:52] would be redeeming the time
[26:54] we cannot as it were ignore the house
[26:57] and then say well okay
[26:59] i'm gonna go out and trim the weeds down
[27:02] and and consider that good that's not
[27:04] my brother and sister giving the proper
[27:06] attention
[27:07] so in the time that we have we we ought
[27:10] to redeem that time we ought to
[27:13] use that time wisely and i certainly
[27:16] would have been
[27:16] guilty through the years and you might
[27:18] say even now be guilty sometimes of
[27:21] not using that time wisely sometimes
[27:24] finding ourselves so busy in life
[27:27] that maybe we're not giving the time to
[27:29] the study of the word
[27:30] or or even to just pondering maybe
[27:34] listening to uh music that would
[27:36] encourage us
[27:37] and and we need to focus to those things
[27:40] uh for satan truly would desire to
[27:43] to distract us and you know we having
[27:46] only
[27:47] in uh you know finite resources
[27:50] we'll find as we get a little older we
[27:53] only have so much energy
[27:55] and my brother and sister we have to
[27:57] choose what we are going to expend
[28:00] our energy on and and all of this kind
[28:03] of ties together in a sense because
[28:06] when when you have expended your energy
[28:09] on something that was really you might
[28:11] say of not so much of a consequence
[28:13] something
[28:14] not so important my brother and sister
[28:17] you cannot
[28:18] go and just redeem that energy
[28:21] now i do i will just interject this uh
[28:25] that there was a time in my life years
[28:27] ago
[28:28] that uh pastoring the church and working
[28:31] that i i just started speaking to the
[28:34] lord saying i i
[28:35] have enough energy lord to work every
[28:39] day
[28:39] and be able to preach on sundays and
[28:42] wednesdays
[28:43] i don't have enough energy and i was
[28:45] actually saying so i don't want to
[28:47] glorify this in any fashion but i was
[28:50] actually
[28:51] looking for you might say a little bit
[28:53] of a way out of this and
[28:55] you know one day i was just kind of
[28:57] speaking to the lord
[28:59] uh just uh bone i was weary to the bones
[29:02] and
[29:02] i just remember the lord speaking to me
[29:05] and saying you know what what you need
[29:07] to do
[29:07] is not complain about your energy you
[29:10] need to ask the lord
[29:12] for more and so i started saying lord
[29:16] i know that i have you know to work and
[29:18] and
[29:19] saints i i don't want you to
[29:20] misunderstand that this is not something
[29:23] for sympathy or
[29:24] anything of that nature but many times
[29:27] you know i would
[29:28] have to be working in the middle of the
[29:30] night and
[29:31] and uh when i would get off work i would
[29:34] get up and
[29:35] be home in the early hours of the
[29:37] morning maybe five or six and
[29:39] i would have to preach that sunday that
[29:42] that very morning
[29:43] and you know it would be easy to say i'm
[29:45] gonna give this to someone else or hand
[29:47] off the baton
[29:49] but there's something burning in your
[29:50] heart you want to share
[29:52] and while i would be there in the middle
[29:54] of the night working i would just say
[29:55] lord i want you to anoint me
[29:58] and my saint by brother and sister
[29:59] saints we we don't want to come to the
[30:01] place that we
[30:02] think we're acting spiritual when we
[30:05] start acting
[30:05] asking the lord for these things god
[30:08] wants us to claim what is rightfully
[30:10] ours
[30:11] we're not being overly spiritual we're
[30:14] not just anointed with some kind of
[30:16] religious spirit to stop and say lord i
[30:19] want you to anoint me today
[30:21] maybe even tonight maybe you're tired at
[30:24] home
[30:24] or whatever the day is you can stop you
[30:28] can
[30:28] stop saint and say lord i want you to
[30:31] anoint me tonight
[30:32] to be anointed with a spirit of strength
[30:35] the spirit of
[30:36] energy and spirit of focus lord because
[30:40] this is who i am and this is important
[30:43] amen
[30:44] and so it was there you know you only
[30:46] have so much energy
[30:48] what will we expend it on you know
[30:52] they're talking about the day and age
[30:53] that we live in they talk about the
[30:55] attention span as it was
[30:57] through the ages my brother and sister
[31:00] we
[31:00] are living in a day that the attention
[31:03] span of
[31:04] humanity is shrinking and you will find
[31:07] now i i just fortunately have my phone
[31:09] here because i read that prayer request
[31:11] off of it
[31:12] but my brother and sister you talk about
[31:14] a distracted generation
[31:16] when this little phone goes ding we
[31:19] are compelled by some kind of an
[31:21] anointing
[31:22] to see what it is we can't even wait a
[31:24] minute or
[31:25] five we must know why the phone went
[31:28] ding
[31:29] and so we are living in such a
[31:31] distracted time
[31:33] that our attention span is drawn in so
[31:35] narrow
[31:36] that it used to be an extensive amount
[31:39] of
[31:40] time and now we're down now some studies
[31:42] say
[31:43] it's not even to three minutes that
[31:46] there's an attention span
[31:47] my brother and sister this is satan's
[31:50] this is part of satan's trap
[31:52] to keep our mind constantly flitting
[31:54] from one thing to another
[31:56] never stopping to focus and it doesn't
[31:59] just stop when you pick up your bible
[32:02] it doesn't stop when you pray it's a
[32:04] spirit of the age
[32:05] but we are anointed by the holy ghost to
[32:09] claim the ability to focus on the things
[32:12] of god
[32:13] we don't have to let our minds bounce
[32:15] from here to yawn
[32:17] and believe that just uh 10 or 20 or 30
[32:19] seconds
[32:20] is sufficient amen so we're living in a
[32:23] day my brother and sister
[32:25] this resource our limited attention span
[32:28] which would be tied directly to this
[32:30] finite ability to focus now saints i
[32:33] realize the age that we're living in
[32:35] and i'm certainly not condemning anyone
[32:37] because we're all subject to these
[32:39] spirits
[32:40] but my brother and sister i've had
[32:42] believers
[32:43] good solid christians tell me brother
[32:45] paul i'm sorry
[32:47] i got distracted in the service my
[32:50] brother and sister
[32:51] we don't have to be we can claim we have
[32:54] been granted the authority
[32:56] to unleash the power of god's word
[32:59] and we don't have to let satan come and
[33:02] draw our thoughts on how you're going to
[33:04] make the house payment
[33:05] or what you're going to do at work
[33:07] tomorrow or what is this situation or
[33:09] what is that situation
[33:11] but we can stop and focus and say this
[33:14] is the time
[33:15] whether it's your prayer or reading your
[33:17] bible or listening to the message
[33:19] you can say this is my time that's
[33:21] focused to god
[33:22] i know believers my brother and sister
[33:25] good faithful christian believers
[33:27] that talk about how they have a hard
[33:29] time focusing
[33:30] the world says oh you've got an
[33:32] attention deficit disorder
[33:34] no my brother and sister we've got a
[33:37] satanic
[33:38] disorder it is satan just doing his very
[33:41] best to draw the believer his
[33:44] thoughts his actions everything away
[33:48] from the word of god from the presence
[33:51] of god
[33:52] i say lord help us to be able to stop
[33:54] and focus
[33:56] and we could be now my brother and
[33:57] sister we often hear people
[33:59] speak of priorities you must set
[34:03] priorities every day get up
[34:06] or before even the evening or afternoon
[34:08] before
[34:09] set the priority of tomorrow
[34:13] set the priority for what you know you
[34:15] must accomplish what you long to
[34:17] accomplish
[34:18] so we hear people speaking of priorities
[34:20] and
[34:21] certainly those would be a a variety of
[34:24] subjects my brother and sister
[34:26] uh i just happened to listen to a brief
[34:29] little deal
[34:30] of this lady talking about how their
[34:32] seminar would help
[34:34] business people be able to set and
[34:37] maintain
[34:38] and accomplish priorities now my brother
[34:41] and sister
[34:41] i think that's really good they are uh
[34:44] seemingly talking about helping
[34:47] they're seemingly doing about this and
[34:49] people only have to just give 750
[34:51] dollars for the literature
[34:53] and to be a part of this seminar my
[34:55] brother and sister
[34:56] all we got to do is give some time to
[34:59] the lord jesus and say lord
[35:01] i want to get my priorities right this
[35:03] is laodicea
[35:05] this is the hour that the word says that
[35:07] it would be lukewarm
[35:09] and we can set a priority lord
[35:12] in your word that you would come and
[35:14] anoint us that we would be
[35:16] able to do uh what you have called us to
[35:19] do
[35:19] to set our priorities on you
[35:23] not to set it on something of this world
[35:25] not upon some marketing scheme
[35:28] not upon some you know house flipping
[35:30] thing or some investment thing
[35:31] or day trading my brother and sister
[35:34] that is not
[35:35] our priority our priority as sons and
[35:38] daughters of god
[35:39] is to get ourselves ready for a rapture
[35:42] that's our priority not to get anchored
[35:45] and rooted into this laodicean world
[35:48] and be caught up in all the cares of
[35:50] this life but to loose ourself
[35:52] from laodicea to be caught up in the
[35:55] presence of almighty god
[35:57] amen i love that hallelujah now in uh
[36:00] john third uh third john uh one and two
[36:04] he says now
[36:04] look at this my brother and sister as we
[36:06] are speaking
[36:08] of priorities we're speaking of prophet
[36:11] profiting and
[36:12] and uh those things like that as we've
[36:14] touched on
[36:15] uh john uh iii john
[36:19] the first chapter of second verse
[36:20] beloved
[36:22] i wish above all things that thou mayest
[36:25] prosper
[36:26] and be in health as thy soul
[36:29] prospereth now look my brother and
[36:31] sister as i've been touching here today
[36:33] uh this evening there's a tremendous
[36:36] focus in the world today on prosperity
[36:39] now you know this is just personal so
[36:41] please don't think that i'm trying to
[36:43] make something out of this
[36:44] i happen to believe one of those people
[36:47] to be one of those people that that
[36:49] you can labor out here in the natural
[36:51] and you can
[36:52] gain as it were natural treasure as it
[36:55] were
[36:56] a house uh land a little money in the
[36:58] bank etc
[36:59] i'm one of those i don't think that you
[37:02] have to take some vow of poverty
[37:04] you know and just scrape by all the time
[37:07] to
[37:08] stay in your correct position with the
[37:10] lord but my brother and sister
[37:12] we got to keep everything as our brother
[37:15] george always
[37:15] puts the little level right here you
[37:18] know we got to keep things in balance
[37:20] and so what this tremendous of focus on
[37:23] prosperity
[37:24] uh i constantly get things in my inbox
[37:27] about
[37:27] how that you know if you'll just do this
[37:29] and do that you can increase your wealth
[37:32] well my brother and sister what kind of
[37:34] wealth are they talking about
[37:36] well if we look what john had to say
[37:38] here he says
[37:39] beloved i wish above all things so he's
[37:42] putting a
[37:43] high emphasis on this that thou mayest
[37:46] prosper so if we was just to cut short
[37:49] or take a hold of this
[37:51] we would realize john is telling the
[37:53] saints that i am placing a priority
[37:56] i'm placing something here that you
[37:58] would prosper
[37:59] you don't have to be uh uh you know in
[38:02] poverty
[38:03] you don't have to just be uh groveling
[38:06] as it were
[38:07] in the alleys and byways and he says
[38:09] here that you could be
[38:11] uh uh prospered you could be brought up
[38:14] you could do well
[38:15] and he says uh here also to be in health
[38:18] and
[38:19] their tremendous focus look at the world
[38:21] we live in today
[38:22] now there is this constant focus on how
[38:25] to make money
[38:26] and how to live healthier everywhere you
[38:29] go
[38:30] facebook those of you that do facebook
[38:33] you will find that things like facebook
[38:35] there is constantly this person with a
[38:37] diet this with a health food this with a
[38:39] supplement
[38:40] this with this this exercise this deal
[38:43] here
[38:43] health health health health health and
[38:45] we have also
[38:47] in there oh here here's how you can make
[38:49] more money you can have more time
[38:51] to be more healthy and you can do this
[38:54] and do this
[38:55] but you know what you don't find when
[38:57] you look on things like facebook
[38:59] is you don't find too much about how to
[39:02] build
[39:02] a closer relationship with god
[39:05] it's mostly on the carnal and the
[39:08] natural things of life
[39:10] so you look at this uh this focus is
[39:13] there but look my brother and sister
[39:15] he puts a comma and then he continues it
[39:19] on which to me
[39:20] is the quantifier or qualifier that puts
[39:24] it all
[39:24] in balance right god's word always puts
[39:27] everything
[39:28] in balance amen god will not leave you
[39:31] out of balance
[39:32] so he says here now beloved i wish above
[39:35] all things that thou mayest prosper
[39:37] and be in health we could stop right
[39:39] there and say amen
[39:40] and i believe we should that we want to
[39:43] prosper and be in health
[39:45] but he puts this quantifier on it even
[39:47] as
[39:48] thy soul prospers
[39:51] so we look at this and he's putting this
[39:54] this qualification on it
[39:56] this connection to the prosperity
[39:59] natural the the health natural
[40:02] needs to only be in proportion and the
[40:06] right balance
[40:07] to your spiritual prosperity
[40:10] now my brother and sister if we if we
[40:13] look and i've used this analogy many
[40:15] times through the years
[40:17] if we had like to say eight or nine or
[40:19] ten year old child
[40:21] and you know uh they they celebrate
[40:23] their 11th birthday
[40:24] and they haven't grown and they they
[40:26] can't do any higher
[40:28] uh qualification of education and they
[40:31] celebrate their 12th birthday
[40:33] and they're in the same spot they're
[40:34] 13th and they're in the same spot
[40:37] 14th are in the same spot somewhere
[40:39] along that line we're going to say
[40:41] we need to take our child and see a
[40:43] doctor see if there's some kind of a
[40:45] deficiency or
[40:47] some kind of disease or something that
[40:49] is causing our child to not grow both
[40:52] naturally and intellectually or
[40:53] knowledge wise
[40:54] whatever we we would go but i tell you i
[40:57] don't mean to be rude
[40:58] but we'll have people that will set in
[41:00] church for 20 or 30 years
[41:03] and not grow spiritually they are
[41:05] sitting in the same spot
[41:07] that they did 30 years ago and my
[41:10] brother and sister people think that all
[41:12] paul's got to do
[41:13] is spend time talking about well we're
[41:15] beyond god sent a prophet
[41:17] but my brother and sister if that's all
[41:19] the further
[41:20] someone has matured in 30 years
[41:23] there's an issue there is something
[41:25] wrong amen so the prophet of god even
[41:28] made the statement
[41:29] that when we recognize who we
[41:32] are we will become an invincible army no
[41:35] it's not my brother and sister that we
[41:38] become something special but we
[41:40] recognize who we
[41:41] are in the plan of god and as that plan
[41:44] is
[41:45] unfolding we are growing with it
[41:49] amen hallelujah i hope somebody out
[41:53] there said amen too
[41:54] amen so here it is see as the soul
[41:58] prospers so if the soul is not
[41:59] prospering
[42:00] but our health is good we're exercising
[42:03] spending all our money on vitamins and
[42:05] vegetables
[42:06] and our bank account is growing but the
[42:09] soul is not prospering we've got
[42:11] problems
[42:12] we've got a lot bigger problems than
[42:13] what's happening out here in laodicea
[42:15] with the government and everything else
[42:17] we've got bigger problems my brother and
[42:19] sister the sin
[42:20] question is a bigger problem amen than
[42:23] the financial question or the health
[42:25] question
[42:26] so you look at this and realize that
[42:28] this connection now
[42:29] if we prosper and we are in health and
[42:32] our soul is prospering
[42:34] then we have a balance my brother and
[42:36] sister i've said this for years i
[42:38] believe it
[42:39] you could give a believer a real holy
[42:42] ghost-filled believer
[42:43] you could give him any amount of money
[42:46] and by the leadership of the holy ghost
[42:48] he'd know what to do with it
[42:50] but you take one that might be just a
[42:52] make-believer
[42:53] you take one that might be the
[42:54] unbeliever and you
[42:57] hand them untold wealth all you got to
[42:59] do is go to the internet
[43:00] and type in lottery winners and you will
[43:03] see all these people
[43:04] that that money ruined them but if you
[43:06] got a real holy ghost-filled son or
[43:08] daughter of god
[43:09] and they come into wealth they would
[43:12] know what to do with it imagine the good
[43:14] things just like and we'll touch on it
[43:15] in a few minutes just like the rich
[43:17] young ruler
[43:18] amen see where he fit so you look at
[43:20] this
[43:21] amen but it's got to be in the correct
[43:23] proportion
[43:25] see we don't want to say well you know
[43:26] if i had an equal portion of my soul
[43:28] growing
[43:29] and my health and my natural prosperity
[43:32] but my brother and sister that's not the
[43:34] proportion that the word of god gives it
[43:36] to us amen
[43:37] that is not the balance not to divide it
[43:40] up as three portions equally
[43:42] but we have to come to that right
[43:44] balance now look my brother and sister
[43:46] there is
[43:46] this day right now i just talked to an
[43:49] individual today
[43:50] said that the stimulus check from the
[43:52] government has landed in their bank
[43:54] account and they were so happy
[43:56] amen they got twenty four hundred
[43:58] dollars them and their wife
[44:00] and uh it's now in their bank account
[44:02] right there and
[44:03] and they bank online and their phone
[44:05] went ding and said you've got to deposit
[44:07] showed it's from the u.s government
[44:09] i i think you know whatever that
[44:11] stimulus package
[44:12] you know all they're doing is adding to
[44:14] the debt and you have to understand
[44:17] the way they look at you uh bro our
[44:19] brother eugene one time preach a service
[44:21] that just baffled me until i really
[44:23] studied it out
[44:24] my brother and sister they have pledged
[44:26] you and i
[44:27] as citizens of the united states to
[44:29] labor to pay
[44:31] our portion you see we say it's the
[44:34] government's debt
[44:35] the government says no it's your debt
[44:37] you study how they
[44:38] speak it and they say every man woman
[44:41] boy
[44:42] and girl amen even a child that has just
[44:45] been born
[44:46] taking its first breath is now like i
[44:48] forget 60
[44:49] 70 80 000 in debt the minute they're
[44:52] born
[44:53] because that is how the government looks
[44:55] at it they have pledged that debt to
[44:58] that child
[44:59] to pay in their lifetime some
[45:01] contribution
[45:02] as it were in taxes or to the economy
[45:05] so you look at this this stimulus
[45:07] package is here to
[45:09] help everyone all they've done is just
[45:11] put it in uh
[45:12] the debt added it to what you owe amen
[45:15] now remember what brother branham said
[45:16] many years ago he said
[45:18] that they were not spending the money
[45:21] that would be
[45:22] paid with the taxes 40 years that our
[45:24] children 40 years down the road
[45:26] and so you see now how it is that they
[45:29] added my brother and sister in all this
[45:31] stimulus
[45:32] they added as much debt as the whole
[45:34] nation
[45:35] had just 20 years ago they added it in
[45:38] one stroke
[45:40] my but you see we also know that this
[45:45] nation must come to
[45:46] the place that it's bailed out it's got
[45:49] to come to the place that is so
[45:50] thoroughly
[45:51] bankrupted now my brother and sister
[45:53] bankruptcy sometimes can be merely cash
[45:55] flow
[45:56] or it's when your debts exceed your
[45:58] assets and when you realize what is
[46:00] happening my brother and sister
[46:02] they're spending we we say what is wrong
[46:04] with these people
[46:05] no praise the lord they're spending our
[46:08] nation into a fulfillment
[46:12] of scripture i say thank you lord even
[46:15] as much as we don't like it
[46:18] it must come to pass but remember my
[46:20] brother and sister the prophet of god
[46:22] clearly shows us that the bride of jesus
[46:24] christ
[46:25] will be raptured before tribulation the
[46:29] wrath
[46:29] hits this earth the bride will be
[46:31] raptured amen
[46:33] he uses many types through the scripture
[46:35] and we'll we'll not
[46:37] uh venture into that tonight so you look
[46:39] at that some people are like well
[46:41] are we in the tribulation uh what is
[46:44] happening now my brother and sister no
[46:45] this is birth pains
[46:47] this is not tribulation tribulation is
[46:50] when hell comes to earth
[46:51] amen this is birth pains the earth is in
[46:54] travail the bride of christ is in
[46:57] travail
[46:58] and the word is being brought forth or
[47:01] manifested amen for for the prophecy
[47:04] amen
[47:05] so this stimulus package here to help
[47:07] anybody but i'll tell you what we really
[47:09] need in this
[47:10] day what we need every man woman boy and
[47:12] girl
[47:13] in in the world today needs this but
[47:15] we're speaking right here in
[47:16] our church what we really need today
[47:19] is not to look out and say well praise
[47:22] the lord we got to you know
[47:24] uh we got a couple three kids you know
[47:26] so here we go a few thousand dollars
[47:28] uh maybe a husband and a wife you got
[47:30] you know twenty four hundred dollars
[47:32] you know that's that's good well i don't
[47:34] know about you but that's not going to
[47:35] change my world
[47:36] amen it's not going to make it all
[47:38] better it's not going to fix any
[47:39] problems
[47:40] amen but i'll tell you what we need
[47:42] today is we need a soul stimulus
[47:45] we need some to come down and to
[47:48] stimulate
[47:48] a bride of christ that she recognizes
[47:52] who
[47:52] she is because when she recognizes who
[47:55] she is
[47:56] she will become the invincible army
[47:59] hallelujah that's more important to me
[48:01] than a thousand or two in my bank
[48:03] account
[48:04] i say lord come down right here in grace
[48:07] lord come down and stimulate some souls
[48:10] lord shake us off and let us see father
[48:13] just who we are let us recognize
[48:16] what it is that you have brought us and
[48:18] placed us in this season for
[48:20] amen i'll tell you what my brother and
[48:22] sister our stimulus package
[48:24] the one that the bride of christ is
[48:25] looking for that is the holy ghost
[48:28] opening the word
[48:29] to you and i now when i say the word i
[48:31] want to express that tonight
[48:33] it is revealing amen revelation all
[48:36] people sometimes just by
[48:38] figure of speech say well the
[48:40] revelations my brother and sister
[48:42] there is one revelation and that is the
[48:45] revelation of jesus christ
[48:47] i say lord let this be a stimulation
[48:51] that would open up our hearts mind
[48:54] souls lord to re receive
[48:58] this revelation of who you are that we
[49:00] can find this revelation
[49:02] stimulation amen that would just stir us
[49:05] i'll tell you what you want to talk
[49:06] about something that stimulates you
[49:08] i tell you some corners of the world my
[49:11] brother and sister
[49:12] different ideologies and i'm not
[49:13] speaking that but some of them you
[49:16] can just do different things i have
[49:17] preached in the midst of these
[49:19] where you just say a couple words you
[49:21] could just say god is great the whole
[49:22] church jumps up and screams hallelujah
[49:24] now my brother and sister if that
[49:26] stimulation is from the soul
[49:29] then that's incredible but sometimes
[49:31] it's merely upon the flesh or in the
[49:33] mind
[49:34] that you can get so excited about
[49:36] something but you see if we don't make
[49:38] it out the door with that
[49:40] it only stimulated our flesh what we
[49:42] wanted to do
[49:43] is open us up amen that's why the
[49:46] prophet of god shows
[49:47] us how that in the music and the opening
[49:49] of a service
[49:50] it sets an atmosphere and the holy
[49:52] spirit can just come right in it's
[49:54] pleased with our worship
[49:56] comes right in but the prophet of god
[49:58] showed us so clearly
[50:00] how that the true stimulating power of
[50:03] god
[50:03] come from the opening of the word from
[50:05] the preaching of the word
[50:07] amen we can talk about the carcass we
[50:09] can talk about how eagles are going to
[50:11] be gathered around it
[50:13] but i say let's find the carcass amen i
[50:15] believe we have
[50:16] but let's find the carcass and we need
[50:19] to dig into that carcass not stand
[50:21] around as it were
[50:22] with our little wings crossed saying you
[50:24] know what this looks like the carcass
[50:26] this might be what they were talking
[50:28] about the carcass i'm going to examine
[50:30] it from every angle because i think it
[50:32] might be and it should be
[50:33] and the seasons right in the locations
[50:35] right no my brother and sister
[50:37] where the carcass is the word of god
[50:41] eagles will be found feeding amen not
[50:44] talking feeding hallelujah
[50:48] i just read a lovely quote i wished i
[50:49] had it right now i'd share with you
[50:51] lovely quote well prophet of god talks
[50:53] about we're we're not here just to talk
[50:55] about this
[50:56] we're not here to talk about the message
[50:58] we are here
[50:59] to become the message hallelujah i i
[51:03] love that amen
[51:04] i don't want to just talk about it i
[51:05] want to become it i believe it
[51:08] amen i've committed my life to it i've
[51:10] spent these years laboring
[51:12] from my heart as this little assembly
[51:15] here in this
[51:16] in this town because i believe this i've
[51:19] given
[51:19] because i believe this and so i don't
[51:22] want to just stand around and say well
[51:24] okay praise the lord
[51:25] we got a carcass here no i want to come
[51:28] i want you
[51:29] now pardon me for for uh putting it
[51:31] pardon me for putting it this way
[51:33] but my brother and sister well i want
[51:35] you to come and say hey brother paul and
[51:37] when i look up i want you to see food on
[51:39] my face
[51:40] hey man i want you to say hey hey what
[51:43] that must be good
[51:44] because he's he's got food on his face i
[51:47] tell you my brother and sister
[51:48] sometimes we so daintily sometimes we
[51:52] are so prim and proper
[51:54] well praise the lord if i i said amen if
[51:56] i really let this stimulation
[51:58] that's stirring my heart right now out
[52:00] what would people think brother branham
[52:02] blasts that
[52:02] he said if you don't let it out my
[52:04] brother and sister god will find
[52:05] somebody to let it out through
[52:08] well praise the lord
[52:14] hallelujah talk about some stimulation
[52:18] look here what the prophet of god's got
[52:20] to say question and answers on the seals
[52:23] he said now i encourage everyone any
[52:25] time any place that i ever post a quote
[52:28] or make reference to it we are not
[52:30] trying to isolate something
[52:32] to to twist or tweak your perspective
[52:35] but i don't believe that you want me to
[52:38] share the whole
[52:39] sermon on every quote every night
[52:42] you have notes it's on the internet you
[52:44] can go back if you don't want to take
[52:46] the notes
[52:47] i encourage you read every bit of this
[52:50] study these things don't think we're
[52:53] cherry picking
[52:54] amen because you can't cherry pick the
[52:56] carcass
[52:57] hallelujah now question answers on the
[53:01] seals
[53:02] brother brown says now but the bible
[53:04] said that he was slain
[53:06] before the world was ever created
[53:09] and your name when the lamb's book
[53:13] when the lamb was slain to redeem this
[53:16] book
[53:17] here is a great thing now
[53:20] now saints i just preached you know
[53:23] about the last
[53:24] 17 years
[53:28] on our name being in the book before the
[53:31] foundation the world
[53:32] you know different brothers have
[53:35] different topics or you might say a
[53:37] favorite thing that stirs them you say
[53:39] well
[53:40] uh now i'm not name-dropping and i
[53:42] certainly don't say this critical
[53:44] but you hear brother tim pruitt preach
[53:46] and brother tim
[53:47] loves the book of revelation he he digs
[53:50] in there he's pulling it apart
[53:52] and he comes and you'll see him coming
[53:54] back to certain points
[53:56] over and over again because he's trying
[53:59] to make an
[53:59] emphasis of what that scripture is
[54:03] and how it's relevant to us and and i
[54:05] put this in a context
[54:07] that through the years my brother and
[54:08] sister my heart has
[54:10] always rejoiced since the lord ever
[54:13] first took me to this
[54:14] is always rejoice to know my name
[54:17] was on that book before the earth that
[54:21] we are on today
[54:23] even had a foundation now that ought to
[54:26] be something to get us excited
[54:28] that's not something well i'm so glad
[54:30] you know i just slipped in before the
[54:32] rapture come
[54:33] my brother and sister how can that be
[54:35] when god placed you in the plan
[54:37] before the very earth we walk on had a
[54:40] foundation oh hallelujah
[54:43] oh my goodness i'll tell you that gets
[54:47] me excited
[54:48] now look what the prophet of god says
[54:49] about it if you think i'm overly carried
[54:51] away hear what the prophet of god says
[54:53] here
[54:54] here is a great thing now
[54:58] now my brother and sister the prophet
[55:00] was standing here with us tonight and
[55:02] and he was looking in the scripture and
[55:04] he said hey
[55:05] saints here is a great thing
[55:08] we wouldn't say oh yeah okay fine now
[55:12] are you with me amen
[55:15] here's a great thing now it might cause
[55:19] stimulation now many people don't get
[55:23] excited about that my brother and sister
[55:25] not is too mundane it's too too old news
[55:28] to them but i'll tell you what it still
[55:30] causes stimulation in me and i'm not
[55:32] saying that to boast i'm just telling
[55:34] you that when i read that
[55:36] and realize what god had done what he
[55:38] included me
[55:39] in included you in is so great he took
[55:42] it all the way back before the
[55:44] foundation
[55:45] hallelujah i like that amen look
[55:48] when when the lamb now remember the
[55:51] bible said the lamb's book of life was
[55:53] written
[55:54] before the foundation of the world
[55:57] well you know why i think it ought to
[55:59] excite some of us because some of us
[56:02] just balancing our checkbook almost feel
[56:05] backslidden
[56:07] some of us in dealing with our children
[56:09] feel backslidden
[56:11] some of us with uh problems of life
[56:13] maybe marriage problems
[56:15] you just think it's all coming apart at
[56:16] the same and you say oh woe
[56:18] is me woe is me what was me why don't
[56:21] you stop and focus
[56:23] on what the carcass is bringing to you
[56:25] and that is
[56:26] your name is here you are in this book
[56:30] you're a part of this plan you can deal
[56:32] with
[56:33] all of this you've got an issue in life
[56:35] you've got a health issue
[56:37] you've got something that's troubling
[56:38] you why do you let it control your life
[56:41] i'm preaching to you paul tonight why do
[56:45] you let it control your life
[56:46] god put you in the book he's got an
[56:49] answer
[56:50] just sit back and rest and ask him to
[56:53] give you the answer
[56:55] lord reveal the answer but maybe the
[56:57] answer is in the carcass
[56:59] and if we're not eating the carcass we
[57:01] won't find the answer
[57:03] oh hallelujah what we got to do is just
[57:06] simply get back into the word
[57:07] and make it a priority of our lives
[57:10] again
[57:10] amen oh it might cause stimulation i
[57:13] don't know about how you're doing saints
[57:14] but
[57:15] it's got me stimulated amen now remember
[57:18] the
[57:18] said the lamb's book of life was written
[57:20] before the foundation of the world
[57:22] and your name might have been possibly
[57:25] could have
[57:26] by accident placed in there
[57:30] hallelujah because after all god just
[57:31] deals in accidents right
[57:34] cosmic light striking cosmic matter
[57:37] caused something to happen come on
[57:39] saints god with intention
[57:42] amen now you know there's a brothers
[57:45] always
[57:45] always corrects me he's always reminding
[57:47] me brother paul
[57:48] brother branham said that jesus blood
[57:50] was not spilt
[57:52] because that sounds like an accident it
[57:54] was poured out which is intentional
[57:57] now my brother and sister i want to take
[57:58] that same intentionality
[58:01] if that's a word and i want you to take
[58:03] that and realize
[58:04] that's how your name ended up in the
[58:07] lamb's book of life
[58:09] god intentionally wrote our name
[58:12] in that book that ought to bring some
[58:14] stimulation to a believer somewhere
[58:17] amen hallelujah and your name was put in
[58:21] was in the book when the lamb was slain
[58:23] before the foundation of the world to
[58:25] redeem every name
[58:26] that was written in the book see you got
[58:29] it now
[58:30] see there ain't nothing out of order now
[58:33] if we'll take what the prophet of god
[58:34] said though
[58:35] there ain't nothing out of order then my
[58:38] brother and sister
[58:39] if nothing's out of order do we have a
[58:42] right
[58:42] to make chaos out of something god put
[58:45] in order
[58:46] do we have a right to sit back and say
[58:48] this is this is all a mistake
[58:50] this is a problem this is this this is
[58:52] that
[58:53] my brother and sister if god said it's
[58:55] in order we need to stand up and say
[58:57] what we think is chaos
[58:59] is in order and we need to trust one
[59:02] who said it in order or otherwise maybe
[59:05] we could readjust the tilt of the earth
[59:07] or we could adjust where the heavens and
[59:09] the stars would appear
[59:10] maybe we could change cosmic light to
[59:13] move and do whatever we would please it
[59:15] to do
[59:16] my brother and sister that wasn't the
[59:17] attention the prophet of god said
[59:19] our theme song is only belief
[59:23] that was not oh try to change it oh
[59:26] get worried about it oh get stressed
[59:29] about it
[59:30] oh backslide over it no he said
[59:33] only believe hallelujah
[59:37] oh i tell you i think some of us need a
[59:39] little more intentionality
[59:41] amen oh see there ain't nothing out of
[59:45] order
[59:46] it's working just exactly like god's big
[59:48] time pc
[59:49] like a moving right around your
[59:52] name was put in there
[59:54] before the foundation of the world when
[59:56] the lamb was slain to redeem what was in
[59:58] that book oh hallelujah
[1:00:00] that means i can say today i'm redeemed
[1:00:05] amen it's not we might be but there's a
[1:00:08] possibility of it
[1:00:09] we can today rejoice from the depths of
[1:00:12] our heart
[1:00:13] oh but brother paul if you knew the
[1:00:15] mistakes that i made
[1:00:16] you think god don't know the mistakes
[1:00:18] you were going to make
[1:00:19] you think god said well i'll redeem them
[1:00:22] until he makes a mistake
[1:00:23] god said i'm going to put his name in
[1:00:26] the book put her name in the book
[1:00:28] in spite of her mistakes or his mistakes
[1:00:31] my brother and sister that's how you got
[1:00:33] to look at it god
[1:00:35] chose you in spite of you oh hallelujah
[1:00:38] i hope i'm not too excited tonight amen
[1:00:41] i i sound strident but it's just a joy
[1:00:44] inside my soul tonight
[1:00:46] to know that god knew exactly
[1:00:49] who i would be my he didn't have this
[1:00:52] little boy
[1:00:53] born to to a parents on on a farm
[1:00:56] somewhere
[1:00:57] and go through everything that life
[1:00:59] would offer and disappointments and
[1:01:01] highlights and all of this
[1:01:03] so that i would just accidentally turn
[1:01:05] out to be something useful in the plan
[1:01:07] of god
[1:01:08] god knew hallelujah and he still said i
[1:01:10] choose you
[1:01:11] thank you lord thank you lord and now he
[1:01:15] comes forward and takes that book
[1:01:17] to claim his redemption now my brother
[1:01:21] and sister
[1:01:21] some would say that the opening of the
[1:01:23] book
[1:01:25] was the actual redemption but the actual
[1:01:28] redemption took place
[1:01:30] when the lamb was slain before the
[1:01:33] foundation
[1:01:34] of the world that's when the actual
[1:01:37] redemption took place
[1:01:39] what is this the opening of the book
[1:01:42] is the manifestation that's god
[1:01:45] loosing it to come forth to take place
[1:01:49] hallelujah amen
[1:01:54] once again i repeat this statement we
[1:01:55] hear people speak of priorities
[1:01:58] but matthew 6 33 34
[1:02:02] gives very clear clarity to us my
[1:02:06] brother and sister
[1:02:07] about priorities but seek ye first the
[1:02:10] kingdom of god and his righteousness
[1:02:13] and all these
[1:02:16] can i be presumptuous tonight nobody get
[1:02:18] too upset with me
[1:02:20] and all of this prosperity and
[1:02:24] health shall be added to you
[1:02:32] hallelujah i hope you see the
[1:02:34] correlation
[1:02:36] the continuity seek the kingdom of god
[1:02:39] so here
[1:02:40] john put it that you would prosper and
[1:02:42] be in health
[1:02:44] even as your soul prospers but here we
[1:02:47] see in matthew
[1:02:48] how it's turned the other way around in
[1:02:50] other words set in order
[1:02:52] that you seek the kingdom of god first
[1:02:54] and his righteousness
[1:02:56] and your prosperity and your health and
[1:02:58] these other things will be added to you
[1:03:00] take therefore no thought for to
[1:03:02] tomorrow for the morrow shall take
[1:03:04] thought for the things of itself
[1:03:06] sufficient until the day is the evil
[1:03:08] thereof my brother and sister
[1:03:10] if the stock market goes up tomorrow the
[1:03:12] stock market goes down tomorrow
[1:03:13] well hallelujah what's that got to do
[1:03:15] with you and i if they come out tomorrow
[1:03:18] and say that everybody's going to have
[1:03:20] the flu and everybody that's susceptible
[1:03:22] is going to
[1:03:22] or the virus and everybody that's
[1:03:24] susceptible is going to die
[1:03:26] what's that got to do with you and i
[1:03:27] because you can't die one second before
[1:03:30] god ordains it and you won't live one
[1:03:32] second longer
[1:03:33] amen we are the lords amen
[1:03:36] we have been given fully we belong to
[1:03:39] him
[1:03:40] amen we are as it were an esther coming
[1:03:43] to her king
[1:03:44] she is not a concubine she is
[1:03:47] the queen but as i preached to you here
[1:03:50] recently
[1:03:51] she did not look at him that's the king
[1:03:54] she looked at him and said
[1:03:55] that's my husband hallelujah
[1:03:58] and we are the bride of jesus christ we
[1:04:01] are not as it were
[1:04:03] just a possession we are not the
[1:04:06] concubine
[1:04:07] we are the wife let's look at him as our
[1:04:10] husband
[1:04:11] let's look at him oh he is our king amen
[1:04:14] he is all of those uh wonderful names
[1:04:17] that describe
[1:04:18] our god our lord jesus christ all of
[1:04:21] those names
[1:04:22] but we must come down to the simple fact
[1:04:25] he is our husband hallelujah
[1:04:29] now that's you know some people don't
[1:04:31] like that some people think that just
[1:04:33] way
[1:04:33] way too personal i want to serve a god
[1:04:36] well my brother and sister this god said
[1:04:39] that he would be
[1:04:40] to you as a husband amen
[1:04:43] he would be and we would be to him as a
[1:04:46] wife
[1:04:47] if that is too aki too yucky too
[1:04:49] personal
[1:04:50] my brother and sister then you're gonna
[1:04:52] have to get over it because you're going
[1:04:53] to have a real issue
[1:04:55] if you're going to hold god at arm's
[1:04:57] reach
[1:04:58] and then claim to be his bride
[1:05:02] well come on saints it's proven in the
[1:05:05] courts of this land
[1:05:06] that if a man marries a woman and that
[1:05:09] marriage is not consummated
[1:05:10] he has a right to walk away from her and
[1:05:13] that be annulled
[1:05:14] it's not even considered a marriage oh
[1:05:17] my brother and sister you say brother
[1:05:19] paul how's that relevant
[1:05:20] it's because this is all about
[1:05:23] relationship
[1:05:24] it is not this is my husband don't touch
[1:05:27] me don't speak to me don't do this don't
[1:05:29] do this
[1:05:29] no my brother and sister this is a
[1:05:31] relationship
[1:05:32] an intimate relationship as a husband
[1:05:35] and a wife and the scripture even brings
[1:05:37] that
[1:05:38] out to us oh hallelujah so he look as we
[1:05:41] would take this get our priorities right
[1:05:44] seek the kingdom first his righteousness
[1:05:47] and these other things
[1:05:48] added to you now people make plans don't
[1:05:51] they
[1:05:51] i've got so many plans well i possibly
[1:05:55] couldn't even fulfill them in the rest
[1:05:56] of my life i have so many plans
[1:05:59] i want to go back to africa i want to go
[1:06:01] to europe i want to go back to australia
[1:06:04] i would i wouldn't mind going to japan
[1:06:07] i i you know just all these things that
[1:06:10] are there and believe it or not i have
[1:06:11] invitations
[1:06:12] i just would need to commit
[1:06:16] and and take those and go but my brother
[1:06:18] and sister you see
[1:06:19] as we make plans as we we take these
[1:06:22] things and we say well i want to do this
[1:06:25] and i think these are lofty i think
[1:06:27] these are loyal we say well i want to
[1:06:28] buy a
[1:06:29] house oh i want to do this i want to you
[1:06:32] know progress in my career that's
[1:06:33] wonderful
[1:06:34] look what james said it says right here
[1:06:38] amen the fourth chapter starting with
[1:06:40] the 13th verse
[1:06:42] he said go to now ye that say today or
[1:06:45] tomorrow
[1:06:46] we will go into such a city and continue
[1:06:49] there a year and buy and sell
[1:06:51] and get gained so making plans voicing
[1:06:54] those plans is what we're going to do
[1:06:55] i'm going to set up a business i'm going
[1:06:57] to buy and i'm going to sell
[1:06:59] and i'm going to get gain what is this
[1:07:01] my brother and sister gain
[1:07:02] is equivalent or synonymous with profit
[1:07:05] amen so i'm going to go to a city and
[1:07:08] i'm going to do this work buy
[1:07:10] and sell and i'm going to get profit and
[1:07:12] the scripture told us
[1:07:13] amen what would it profit a man to gain
[1:07:16] the whole world
[1:07:18] so now we're setting the very paradox or
[1:07:20] the very box the matrix
[1:07:22] by which a man could enter in with plans
[1:07:24] to go to a city
[1:07:26] buy and sell and make profit whereas you
[1:07:29] know not
[1:07:30] what shall be on the morrow for what is
[1:07:33] your life
[1:07:34] it is even a vapor that appeareth
[1:07:38] for a little time then vanish away
[1:07:42] i'll tell you what there's nothing like
[1:07:44] i i don't consider myself old in fact i
[1:07:46] i just
[1:07:48] i just refuse to
[1:07:51] but where did the last 40 years go
[1:08:00] i can remember brother shawn when i was
[1:08:03] your age i just could not
[1:08:05] wait to get a driver's license 14 years
[1:08:08] old i got my first dirt bike
[1:08:10] oh the world had been set free to me but
[1:08:13] then i started hearing about these other
[1:08:15] places you could go ride a dirt bike
[1:08:17] beside some farm or canal bank or ditch
[1:08:20] bank or
[1:08:21] some interesting places
[1:08:24] i'll leave it at that
[1:08:29] and then i wanted a car and when i got a
[1:08:32] got my own pickup at 16 years old
[1:08:36] i thought i had the answer but there was
[1:08:39] always
[1:08:40] something else and then poof here i am
[1:08:43] standing tonight
[1:08:45] 58 and a half years old preaching to you
[1:08:47] and wondering where did the last years
[1:08:49] go
[1:08:50] they were like a vapor and i'm still
[1:08:52] living
[1:08:53] amen it is even a vapor that appeareth
[1:08:56] for a little time
[1:08:58] then vanisheth away for that you ought
[1:09:02] to say
[1:09:03] oh lord forgive me so many times i've
[1:09:07] i've not fulfilled this for that ye
[1:09:10] ought to say
[1:09:11] if the lord will we shall
[1:09:14] live and do this or that
[1:09:18] look what he's doing laying a foundation
[1:09:20] that we are actually telling god
[1:09:22] we want your perfect will lord we want
[1:09:26] what you
[1:09:26] want lord i have plans as a human i have
[1:09:29] plans as a man
[1:09:31] amen that lord i want to accomplish this
[1:09:34] i
[1:09:34] i want to build a house i want to
[1:09:36] remodel a house i want to buy the land
[1:09:39] i'd like to travel the world lord all of
[1:09:41] these things are my
[1:09:43] expression but when we come to the place
[1:09:46] we're willing to lay
[1:09:47] our expression out and then say lord
[1:09:50] whatever you will
[1:09:52] is what i really want amen see
[1:09:55] then you're putting your soul in a
[1:09:57] position that you
[1:09:58] bear your soul to god and let god put
[1:10:02] the circumstance or the blessing or
[1:10:04] whatever it might be in life in you
[1:10:07] not you trying to dictate to god amen
[1:10:11] but now you rejoice in your boastings
[1:10:17] i'm going to go do this i'm going to own
[1:10:21] this
[1:10:21] i'm going to build this i'm going to buy
[1:10:23] this
[1:10:26] see we just
[1:10:30] take it for granted
[1:10:33] but obviously by the scripture god is
[1:10:35] trying to compel
[1:10:36] us to put his will
[1:10:41] in front of everything that we're doing
[1:10:45] by putting his will in front of
[1:10:48] everything that we're doing
[1:10:51] we're telling god i'm willing lord
[1:10:56] if i never own a house a train or a
[1:10:58] plane
[1:10:59] or this or do that if i never go
[1:11:02] back to australia i never go to africa i
[1:11:04] never go to europe
[1:11:06] lord whatever you want i'm
[1:11:09] happy with you see we're not putting our
[1:11:12] own personal gain
[1:11:14] we're not putting what we think and feel
[1:11:17] and want
[1:11:18] ahead of god's will oh my
[1:11:24] but now you rejoice in your boastings
[1:11:26] and all such rejoicing
[1:11:28] is evil i don't think any one of us
[1:11:30] would say lord i want to just do this
[1:11:32] and be evil
[1:11:34] therefore to him that knoweth to do good
[1:11:36] and doeth it not to him it is sin
[1:11:38] i think verse 17 clenches this lord help
[1:11:42] every one of us
[1:11:43] because if we're to put it to god that
[1:11:46] his
[1:11:46] perfect will would take place and we
[1:11:49] don't put it to god that his perfect
[1:11:52] will take place
[1:11:53] it says right there in verse 17 him that
[1:11:56] knoweth do good and doeth it not it's
[1:11:58] sin
[1:11:58] so for us to put our own boasting our
[1:12:00] own hearts desires our own longing for
[1:12:02] whatever it might be my brother and
[1:12:04] sister are for us to put that ahead of
[1:12:06] the will of god
[1:12:07] is sin now some people would say well i
[1:12:11] disagree and
[1:12:12] that's good i'm not here to argue with
[1:12:14] you i just
[1:12:16] see it the way i see it and i can't see
[1:12:18] it any other way
[1:12:21] lord your perfect will when the lord
[1:12:24] first spoke to me about this
[1:12:26] it changed the way i pray i find myself
[1:12:29] even today saints
[1:12:31] praying for my brother jewel this
[1:12:33] desiring as he was going into this
[1:12:35] surgery
[1:12:36] this desiring that the surgeon's hand
[1:12:38] would be guided so perfectly
[1:12:40] that everything would be right but at
[1:12:43] the end of this prayer see it might
[1:12:44] sound like a paradox
[1:12:46] it might sound like paul is double
[1:12:48] minded but at the end of that
[1:12:50] prayer that i prayed earnestly for
[1:12:52] brother jewell's life
[1:12:53] i had to close that prayer out with lord
[1:12:57] thy will be done
[1:13:00] and we would look at from my brother and
[1:13:02] sister and we'd say
[1:13:04] oh oh if a brother passed away a sister
[1:13:06] passed away
[1:13:07] oh this is terrible this is terrible and
[1:13:10] some people my brother and sister are
[1:13:11] celebrating the death
[1:13:13] of uh aunts and uncles and and grandma
[1:13:16] and grandma
[1:13:17] grandpa and grandpa and moms and dads
[1:13:20] and they they're longing they're
[1:13:22] constantly looking back to this
[1:13:24] oh this terrible time this terrible time
[1:13:28] what we should be doing is saying lord
[1:13:31] thank you lord they've graduated they're
[1:13:34] walking
[1:13:35] on the streets of glory in the presence
[1:13:37] of almighty god
[1:13:38] you chose him lord you said the season
[1:13:41] that as
[1:13:42] a fruit as the first fruit they're ready
[1:13:45] to come in the presence
[1:13:46] of god we shouldn't be mourning that my
[1:13:48] brother and sister
[1:13:49] we should be saying hallelujah and lord
[1:13:52] i'm
[1:13:52] looking for the day to go visit mom and
[1:13:55] dad again
[1:13:56] to grandma and grandpa again lord to
[1:13:58] walk in your presence i'm looking
[1:14:00] for that day and that might come
[1:14:02] tomorrow for us
[1:14:03] it might not come for fifty years for us
[1:14:06] but whatever it is lord thy will be done
[1:14:09] otherwise we start trying to impose our
[1:14:12] will
[1:14:13] our ideas we we should rejoice
[1:14:19] and we rejoice when we should be
[1:14:21] mourning
[1:14:23] because this flesh is a conflict
[1:14:27] to the things of god
[1:14:31] oh my do you know in various forms
[1:14:35] i just want to make this not each one of
[1:14:38] these implies the same way that i'm
[1:14:40] preaching it tonight so don't
[1:14:41] misunderstand
[1:14:42] me but the prophet of god uses the words
[1:14:45] lord willing 959
[1:14:49] times in the message
[1:14:52] amen over and over and over
[1:14:56] again speaking lord willing
[1:14:59] my brother and sister i think that i
[1:15:01] think that might have meant something
[1:15:03] because he was compelled now look
[1:15:07] we're going to just go right here into
[1:15:09] leadership
[1:15:10] amen now look at this brother branham
[1:15:14] says
[1:15:15] now i i like this not intentional but i
[1:15:19] like this this was preached on my
[1:15:21] birthday i was
[1:15:22] four whole years old
[1:15:28] my hard to imagine isn't it
[1:15:31] my parents didn't hear about the message
[1:15:33] for another five years
[1:15:35] beyond this
[1:15:38] if you ever bought one of my tapes get
[1:15:40] this
[1:15:41] when i get when i get home
[1:15:45] the trail of the serpent so if you've
[1:15:48] ever bought one of my tapes
[1:15:50] he's saying get this when this one comes
[1:15:54] out
[1:15:54] you get this one
[1:15:58] when i get when i get home the trail of
[1:16:00] the serpent and you'll see where it's at
[1:16:03] see where this ends up at going home now
[1:16:05] to speak
[1:16:07] if the lord willing
[1:16:14] go study the foundations
[1:16:18] the few words that the prophet of god
[1:16:21] speaks about the trail of the serpent
[1:16:23] but brown was going to go back to
[1:16:25] jeffersonville because he wanted to
[1:16:26] preach it
[1:16:27] in his home church where the people
[1:16:29] would sit there and absorb that and
[1:16:31] support it and draw on it
[1:16:33] and brother branham was going to lay the
[1:16:35] rubber to the road
[1:16:37] my brother and sister do you know there
[1:16:38] was men that claimed
[1:16:41] friendship with brother branham claimed
[1:16:43] to believe what he bought
[1:16:45] and at the passing of brother branham
[1:16:48] did their best to divide the message up
[1:16:50] to claim their group of believers to
[1:16:52] claim their
[1:16:53] position in the whole thing men who did
[1:16:56] very politically oriented things
[1:17:03] if brother brown had preached the trail
[1:17:04] of the serpent
[1:17:07] i can only imagine saints if i could
[1:17:10] speculate this evening
[1:17:12] for just a moment i can only imagine
[1:17:17] what the prophet of god saw
[1:17:20] when he was around those groups
[1:17:24] i can only imagine i wouldn't even want
[1:17:27] the job
[1:17:29] you imagine that when someone comes up
[1:17:30] oh god bless you
[1:17:32] brother branham and he could tell right
[1:17:34] there just it wasn't mishawaka
[1:17:37] mishawaka here was a man filled with the
[1:17:38] holy ghost his whole hearts desire to go
[1:17:41] up
[1:17:41] and and that man was rejoicing and
[1:17:44] entering into the word but a man that
[1:17:46] was also interpreting the speaking of
[1:17:47] the tongues and entering to this
[1:17:49] had a whole other family by another
[1:17:51] woman i had an extramarital affair and
[1:17:54] was doing that but still anointed the
[1:17:56] rain falling on the just and the unjust
[1:17:57] right
[1:17:58] prophet of god go study the message how
[1:18:00] he talks about how he was out there
[1:18:02] cave and the wind blew that open again
[1:18:04] and blew it open again
[1:18:06] and uh god speaking to him about the
[1:18:07] rain falling on the jost and the unjust
[1:18:10] my brother and sister how this would be
[1:18:12] and here the prophet of god
[1:18:14] is talking about when i get home you'll
[1:18:16] see where it's at
[1:18:18] he would he was oh if we could only
[1:18:20] understand what he was saying here
[1:18:22] you'll see where it's at and you'll see
[1:18:25] where it ends up how
[1:18:26] and going home now to speak if the lord
[1:18:28] willing it's about four hours
[1:18:32] so i couldn't keep it at one of the
[1:18:33] meeting like this i have to go
[1:18:35] up there where the church suffers with
[1:18:37] me so long patiently and notice
[1:18:39] but now you can listen at the tapes
[1:18:42] sometime
[1:18:43] in your home amen so he's telling them
[1:18:45] when i preach this
[1:18:47] what does this tell me saints he had
[1:18:49] every intention
[1:18:50] of going home and just laying the whole
[1:18:53] thing right out
[1:18:54] and saying this is where this spirit's
[1:18:56] at this is where this spirit's at
[1:18:58] this is where this individual is and the
[1:19:00] spirit they're anointed with
[1:19:03] oh my goodness oh my goodness
[1:19:08] but you notice he quantified this
[1:19:13] lord willing
[1:19:19] oh my goodness
[1:19:25] and then the prophet goes from the scene
[1:19:28] well that's a shame he never got to
[1:19:30] preach that
[1:19:31] no saints god didn't want it preached
[1:19:36] god did not want that priest or it would
[1:19:38] have been preached it would be part of
[1:19:40] the message that we have
[1:19:42] recorded today oh
[1:19:48] notice this now we find out that he was
[1:19:50] great success
[1:19:51] then we find him later until he was a
[1:19:53] greater success until he was
[1:19:55] let's talk about the rich young brother
[1:19:57] until he said i've got so much boy he
[1:19:58] made a real genuine guy of this day
[1:20:01] amen i've got so much boy
[1:20:05] he'd have made a real genuine guy of
[1:20:06] this day wouldn't he
[1:20:08] even my barnes has swelled out there
[1:20:10] bursting i've got so much till i said oh
[1:20:12] soul take your rest
[1:20:16] but you see he got the formula wrong
[1:20:20] he didn't put value to the soul
[1:20:23] he put value to prosperity
[1:20:29] oh my oh my
[1:20:34] now look what the prophet goes on to say
[1:20:37] but what he done at the beginning he
[1:20:39] rejected
[1:20:39] the leadership of jesus christ
[1:20:42] so when he had accumulated this wealth
[1:20:45] that caused his barns to swell
[1:20:48] my brother and sister that was not when
[1:20:49] he rejected god
[1:20:51] he rejected god in the beginning
[1:20:55] so god did not hinder his prosperity
[1:20:59] now many times we'll see that people
[1:21:01] still in this day even after the prophet
[1:21:03] warned us about this people still
[1:21:05] put some kind of value to the fact that
[1:21:08] they're prospering
[1:21:09] is a blessing from god the rich young
[1:21:11] ruler the prophet of god says had
[1:21:13] rejected
[1:21:14] leadership of jesus christ he still
[1:21:16] prospered
[1:21:17] and he still was faithful in church amen
[1:21:20] because look at this
[1:21:21] and what he done at the beginning he
[1:21:22] rejected the leadership of jesus christ
[1:21:24] his church his intelligence his
[1:21:27] education
[1:21:28] and all led him to a success all the
[1:21:31] jews love him
[1:21:32] they gave he gave to them he helped them
[1:21:35] he might have done this
[1:21:37] that or the other but you see he
[1:21:39] rejected the leadership of jesus christ
[1:21:42] the eternal life and that the bible said
[1:21:44] he said thou
[1:21:45] fool tonight your soul is required now
[1:21:48] we find him the next place
[1:21:49] is in hell lifting up his eyes and
[1:21:52] seeing that beggar
[1:21:53] that he'd turned out to the street in
[1:21:55] the bosoms of abraham
[1:21:56] what a fatal my brother and sister the
[1:22:00] word fatal
[1:22:01] means death what a fatal mistake
[1:22:05] how that the churches had had had had
[1:22:08] had been all right in the way that they
[1:22:10] went
[1:22:10] but they still hadn't had eternal
[1:22:14] life you see what we're doing my brother
[1:22:17] and sister
[1:22:18] is coming to a place we have to put it
[1:22:22] in the right order
[1:22:23] i want to close sister emmy would you
[1:22:25] come amen
[1:22:27] see he profited tremendously
[1:22:30] at the expense of his soul see no matter
[1:22:33] what our wealth is
[1:22:37] god's been good to sister jerry and i
[1:22:40] i live in a paid for house
[1:22:45] i don't have to worry about paying the
[1:22:46] light bill tomorrow
[1:22:49] it doesn't matter what kind of wealth we
[1:22:50] have it don't matter what our ability is
[1:22:53] it don't matter what our talent is
[1:22:57] we cannot put those things above our
[1:23:00] soul
[1:23:01] we have to put our perspective
[1:23:04] correctly amen
[1:23:08] now look as we look at this
[1:23:11] my brother and sister in first
[1:23:14] corinthians 9
[1:23:15] 19 i think i'll just skip down for the
[1:23:19] sake of time to verse 24.
[1:23:24] know ye not that they which run in a
[1:23:26] race run
[1:23:27] all but one receiveth the prize so
[1:23:30] run that that ye may obtain
[1:23:35] all saints let's just keep pressing to
[1:23:37] the mark of the high calling
[1:23:39] just think of how glorious i don't
[1:23:40] expect you to jump up out of your seat
[1:23:42] and shout and sing
[1:23:43] but i think sometimes we as believers
[1:23:45] message believers
[1:23:46] have just got so jaded you might say
[1:23:49] we've heard it we've heard it and we've
[1:23:50] heard it and we understand it we believe
[1:23:52] it
[1:23:53] that it's lost the spark in our soul to
[1:23:56] realize
[1:23:57] how incredible the plan of god was that
[1:24:00] he would go before there was
[1:24:01] even a earth he would go and put our
[1:24:05] name
[1:24:05] in that book and then tell us uh place
[1:24:08] us in a time
[1:24:09] in a season he places in this and when
[1:24:12] you look at that
[1:24:13] when you look at hebrews 11 that they
[1:24:15] without us
[1:24:18] oh my goodness you realize what god did
[1:24:22] he placed us in a position that
[1:24:25] our position in the word will bring
[1:24:29] them also to be perfect what is it
[1:24:33] it's not you and i it's the word being
[1:24:35] fulfilled
[1:24:37] it's the prophecy the thus saith the
[1:24:39] lord
[1:24:40] bringing each one of us into our
[1:24:42] maturity
[1:24:43] in the season that god ordained and how
[1:24:46] that we as sons and daughters of god
