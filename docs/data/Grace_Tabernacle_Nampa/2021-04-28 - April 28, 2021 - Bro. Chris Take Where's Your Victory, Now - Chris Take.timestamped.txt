[36:24] father
[36:25] i pray lord that you would take these
[36:27] words lord been on a page by a man
[36:30] lord that you would bring the
[36:31] inspiration of the holy spirit behind
[36:33] them father
[36:34] that lord you could touch the hearts of
[36:36] your people tonight
[36:37] we love you so much lord jesus thank you
[36:39] for this opportunity tonight
[36:42] speak to us we pray in jesus name
[36:45] amen praise the lord good to be in the
[36:48] house of god tonight
[36:50] as always i don't remember a chance i
[36:53] got here and said man i wish i hadn't
[36:55] come
[36:57] why don't we stand tonight we're going
[36:59] to open our bibles up
[37:01] john chapter 20.
[37:07] john chapter 20.
[37:20] i don't know about y'all but it's a
[37:22] little warm up here
[37:26] john chapter 20 verse 24.
[37:34] the bible says but thomas one of the
[37:36] twelve called
[37:37] didymus was not with them when jesus
[37:39] came
[37:41] the other disciples therefore said unto
[37:43] him we have seen the lord but he said
[37:44] unto them
[37:45] except i shall see in his hands the
[37:48] print of the nails and put my finger
[37:50] into the print
[37:51] of the nails and thrust my hand into his
[37:54] side i will not believe
[37:56] and after eight days again his disciples
[37:58] were within
[37:59] and thomas with them so thomas came to
[38:02] church this time
[38:04] then came jesus the doors then then came
[38:07] jesus
[38:08] the doors being shut and stood in the
[38:09] midst and said peace be unto you
[38:12] then saith he to thomas reach hither thy
[38:14] finger
[38:15] and behold my hand and reach hither thy
[38:18] hand and thrust it into my side and be
[38:20] not faithless
[38:21] but believing and thomas answered and
[38:24] said unto him my lord and my god
[38:26] jesus saith unto him thomas because thou
[38:28] has seen me thou hast believed
[38:30] blessed are they that have not seen and
[38:32] yet have believed
[38:34] first john chapter 5
[38:44] first john chapter 5 and verse 4
[38:54] for whatsoever is born of god overcometh
[38:56] the world
[38:57] and this is the victory that overcometh
[38:59] the world
[39:01] even our faith amen may the lord have
[39:04] the blessing to the reading of his word
[39:06] may be seated tonight so my title
[39:09] tonight is
[39:10] where's your victory can you put it up
[39:13] because there's that comma is important
[39:15] where's your victory now amen
[39:18] and then my subtitle is the hands of
[39:21] christ
[39:22] so i kind of wanted to take a little bit
[39:25] of liberty
[39:26] some can disagree with me if you like
[39:29] but it's not contrary to the word of god
[39:31] to uh to uh stand on thomas's side
[39:35] tonight
[39:37] so thomas is known by everyone as
[39:39] doubting thomas the
[39:41] bible doesn't label him as doubting
[39:42] thomas the bible
[39:44] just calls him thomas amen what's
[39:47] written of you in the word of god
[39:49] is the ultimate truth we don't hear
[39:51] about abraham's struggles or his
[39:53] mistakes and we read of him in hebrew as
[39:55] we hear of how by faith
[39:57] abraham stood accepting the promise of
[39:59] god
[40:00] and what's written of you and glory is
[40:02] by faith
[40:03] brother paul by faith brother didier by
[40:05] faith for the david for the power
[40:07] stood the test of time and so what is
[40:09] written of you in the word
[40:11] is what we want to stand by i heard one
[40:13] time said do you want to believe what
[40:14] god thinks about you
[40:16] or do you want to believe what the devil
[40:17] thinks about you
[40:19] the devil's a liar anyhow so we have
[40:22] thomas here and now i i
[40:25] mentioned this and perhaps it you know
[40:27] we wonder where thomas was the first
[40:29] time
[40:30] if you go back and you look and and and
[40:32] as we get
[40:33] we look at who thomas was and um
[40:38] what kind of believer he was up until
[40:40] the death of jesus christ
[40:41] the crucifixion of christ and his
[40:43] resurrection if you go in john 11
[40:45] 16 it says where we we we begin the
[40:49] story of
[40:49] lazarus and and this is one of um the
[40:52] first mentions of thomas actually
[40:54] partaking in um the storyline if you
[40:58] will
[40:58] and um mary or martha one of them
[41:01] comes to jesus and says hey my brother
[41:03] lazarus is dying i need you to come
[41:06] but as we know not god could do nothing
[41:10] jesus could do nothing except the father
[41:12] willed it and so it was not yet
[41:14] time for jesus to go to lazarus
[41:17] lazarus had to pass away you never know
[41:20] the will of god but the will of god is
[41:22] always completely and totally perfect
[41:24] and so he jesus says okay lazarus is
[41:27] sleeping
[41:28] and uh but we'll we're waiting to go
[41:30] because it is for your benefit and
[41:32] you know the disciples say well if he's
[41:34] sleeping he must be fine and jesus says
[41:36] no no he's dead
[41:37] but now we'll go and they said you can't
[41:40] go
[41:41] because they're trying to kill you in
[41:42] judea and in john 11 16
[41:45] then said thomas which is called didimas
[41:48] under his fellow disciples let us
[41:49] also go that we may die with him so here
[41:53] we have thomas
[41:54] dedicated ready to give his life to
[41:56] stand beside
[41:58] the messiah he was totally convinced
[42:03] or so he thought he had it figured out
[42:06] that this was
[42:07] jesus if you knew thomas as one of the
[42:10] disciples you say this man is
[42:12] he's a one of the disciples he's a good
[42:14] man he's a strong man
[42:16] perhaps someone some said the same thing
[42:18] of judas
[42:20] and this is where it's important where
[42:22] we don't put our trust in men
[42:24] but we put our trust in god because by
[42:26] all accounts
[42:27] and appearances judas went out with them
[42:30] and preached the gospel and
[42:31] when jesus saw the devil fall like
[42:33] lightning from heaven
[42:35] judas was part of that revival but yet
[42:36] judas was destined to just
[42:38] to betray christ and so
[42:41] even even peter and his his zealousness
[42:45] went and betrayed uh or denied knowing
[42:48] jesus
[42:49] and so you you uh
[42:52] at this point in time you say thomas was
[42:54] a good solid believer
[42:56] and thomas goes with jesus and thomas
[42:59] witnesses
[43:00] the resurrection of lazarus have any of
[43:02] you ever seen someone come back to life
[43:05] some of you have i haven't
[43:09] well actually i'm looking at a whole
[43:11] church full of people that have come
[43:12] back to life
[43:16] but um in the physical it's it was a
[43:19] great phenomena
[43:20] here it is lazarus four days so his
[43:22] body's already started
[43:24] to decay and he stands up and walks out
[43:26] of the tomb
[43:27] and they have a nice supper afterwards
[43:29] um
[43:30] you know how was your day lazarus oh
[43:33] it's a whole lot better
[43:37] so this is what thomas is experiencing
[43:40] he's walking with jesus and he sees
[43:42] the miracles come to pass and and
[43:44] constant
[43:46] um reconfirming that jesus
[43:49] is the messiah one thing i'm going to
[43:52] bring out lord willing
[43:55] is you see thomas's desire to know
[43:58] that he knows the truth
[44:01] jesus presents something to the
[44:03] disciples in john chapter 14.
[44:06] i'm just going to flip there real quick
[44:07] so i have a reference for it
[44:13] he says let your heart not be troubled
[44:16] yea believe in god
[44:18] you believe in god believe also in me
[44:20] and my father's house are many mansions
[44:22] if it were not so i would have told you
[44:24] i go to prepare a place for you
[44:26] and if i go and prepare a place for you
[44:28] i will come again
[44:29] and receive you unto myself that where i
[44:32] am there you may be also
[44:33] and whether i go you know and the way
[44:36] you know
[44:37] they've never heard him talk about this
[44:38] till now and now he's telling them you
[44:40] know how to get there and they're saying
[44:42] so thomas instead of just and this is
[44:44] this is what i this is the
[44:45] the what we're getting at tonight thomas
[44:48] doesn't just sit back quietly with the
[44:50] rest of the disciples
[44:51] instead of pretending not his head like
[44:53] he understands
[44:55] those are the when you give somebody
[44:57] instruction they just say yeah
[44:58] yeah yeah yeah and nod their head and
[45:00] they go off and do something
[45:01] totally different i'd rather spend an
[45:04] hour and a half explaining a five-minute
[45:06] task to somebody and send them off
[45:08] knowing they're going to do it exactly
[45:09] how i asked them to do it
[45:11] because they're seeking the answers and
[45:13] people like that they have
[45:15] their whether what it is is they're
[45:16] they're in the game their heads in the
[45:18] game they want to know what's going on
[45:20] they
[45:20] they have skin in the game they want to
[45:22] know what's happening they want to fully
[45:23] understand what they're doing
[45:25] because they are fully partaking of it
[45:27] so thomas we already see his dedication
[45:30] let's go
[45:30] and and and i'll die with with our lord
[45:33] let's go to judea with with the lord and
[45:34] it will give our life with him
[45:36] he's dedicated he's completely sold out
[45:38] and so when jesus brings this doctrine
[45:40] they have not yet heard before
[45:41] he says he says um lord we know not
[45:45] whether
[45:46] thou goest how can we know the way
[45:49] we don't know where you're going lord so
[45:51] how how how are we gonna
[45:52] where where are we gonna get the
[45:53] information do you got a map i mean
[45:55] can you can i get an app on my phone to
[45:57] follow and then know where
[45:58] what what do i have to do to follow you
[46:01] in other words
[46:02] jesus said i'm going to go and you're
[46:03] coming with me and thomas says yes
[46:05] i want to go too thomas shouldn't just
[46:08] sit back and
[46:09] and pretend to be all spiritual and go
[46:11] yep
[46:12] amen right we know those people
[46:16] then they you know you you spend some
[46:17] time with them you fellowship with them
[46:18] and he said they're not understanding it
[46:21] and so but um so here here we have
[46:24] thomas and
[46:25] and and and so he he he seeks the truth
[46:29] he asks questions and he doesn't
[46:31] understand he seeks the truth he wants
[46:33] to know
[46:34] and so now we we we we we stand with
[46:38] thomas at the hill golgotha and we
[46:41] watched the
[46:42] the man that he has suffered and and and
[46:45] and walked long miles and spent late
[46:47] nights and
[46:48] and handed bread to thousands of people
[46:51] um
[46:51] and and seen miracles and and rode
[46:54] across the sea of galilee
[46:56] more than once and spent time and and
[46:58] blood and
[46:59] sweat and and tears into this ministry
[47:01] and now
[47:02] he's dying on the cross and thomas
[47:07] is full of questions
[47:10] he is questioning what's going on
[47:14] what did i what did i miss i knew this
[47:18] was the guy
[47:19] i knew this was the messiah now he's
[47:21] he's dying before my eyes my eyes aren't
[47:24] deceiving me
[47:26] i see him dying
[47:29] jesus is buried a couple days later or
[47:32] the next
[47:33] or the third day i believe it was when
[47:35] they get the first
[47:36] news thomas is there hey he's alive
[47:40] thomas if we read it here in the
[47:42] scripture he says look
[47:44] i watched him die but thomas you
[47:47] you saw all the miracles and and
[47:49] remember when he said this
[47:51] the temple being destroyed and risen
[47:53] again and and everything remember he
[47:55] said this thomas says
[47:57] not thomas could have said oh yeah
[48:00] praise the lord
[48:01] and buried his doubt behind a facade
[48:04] but thomas was what i call a real person
[48:08] he said i don't believe it
[48:11] i want to but unless i see him
[48:15] and put my hands in his hands
[48:18] i can't believe it thomas how how dare
[48:21] you
[48:21] but who was there in their midst who had
[48:24] the same doubt
[48:25] yeah who was there but they kept quiet
[48:30] who is here tonight sitting with doubts
[48:32] keeping quiet while the devil says
[48:35] thank you keep quiet you don't want to
[48:38] let them know
[48:39] you're not because you're not actually
[48:40] believer so if you if you ask that
[48:42] question or
[48:43] or you make that remark or you talk to
[48:45] that and you talk about
[48:47] they're going to know and they're going
[48:50] to ask you to leave
[48:51] or they're not going to want to be your
[48:52] friend or they're not going to talk you
[48:53] or it's going to be awkward
[48:55] who cares awkward is awkward
[48:58] it only lasts for a moment
[49:01] and so so so thomas is expressing his
[49:04] heart
[49:05] we are called as children of god to
[49:08] confide in one another
[49:10] say hey i need prayer we've heard it
[49:12] from our pastor why do we
[49:14] speak of our needs in the back and
[49:17] not request any prayer
[49:20] why are we seeking and why do why do we
[49:23] have people
[49:24] who who who who you talk to who have now
[49:27] every man is responsible for his own
[49:29] soul and they make their choices
[49:32] but why do we have people who after they
[49:34] leave say well
[49:37] i just i felt like i couldn't talk to
[49:39] anybody or
[49:40] whatever everyone has their own choices
[49:43] i don't want to
[49:44] say you need to feel like it's your
[49:46] fault someone left message it's not your
[49:47] fault
[49:48] they made their choice but let's not be
[49:51] guilty of how's that song who will be
[49:55] jesus to them
[49:57] will you be jesus will you be jesus to
[49:58] that strange man that walks in the back
[50:01] or that strange woman that walks in the
[50:03] back will you reach out
[50:05] the loving hand of christ or will you
[50:07] pick up a stone
[50:09] okay that's what i'm getting at so here
[50:11] we have thomas and
[50:12] and he expresses from his heart i i have
[50:14] doubts
[50:15] unless i see it i'm not going to believe
[50:18] it
[50:20] and um i need to go back to my spot
[50:27] so jesus came yes sorry i got the facts
[50:29] wrong jesus came and thomas wasn't there
[50:34] where was thomas is it funny how that
[50:37] one service you miss
[50:39] my goodness you should have been there
[50:42] brother
[50:43] it was a revival
[50:47] thomas was struggling he was down
[50:52] he saw the man he spit
[50:55] poured his heart and soul into die
[50:59] he saw what he believed in his eyes die
[51:03] he saw what he believed in dismantled
[51:08] but thomas had something in his heart
[51:13] something down inside him that brought
[51:15] him back
[51:16] he didn't go off said and say that's it
[51:19] never mind
[51:20] i was wrong and and go off and and do
[51:23] his thing no
[51:23] he came back to church he wasn't at
[51:27] church
[51:28] he was struggling but something in his
[51:30] heart said thomas
[51:31] you need to be there and that was the
[51:34] service
[51:34] that god had planned just for thomas
[51:37] because what's the first thing jesus
[51:39] does
[51:39] he appears he says thomas come here
[51:44] where is your victory now
[51:48] thomas says my victory is in the hands
[51:49] of jesus
[51:52] so now what is it it's faith
[51:56] see jesus says here he says he says now
[51:59] thomas you use
[52:00] believe me because you have seen but
[52:03] blessed
[52:04] are they that have not seen yet had
[52:05] believed but guess what
[52:08] now might be stretching it a little bit
[52:10] didymus
[52:11] means twain or twofold so there's a
[52:14] twofold meaning to this scripture
[52:16] you have to see jesus
[52:19] that's what jesus meant by believing
[52:22] here thomas walks up
[52:23] and we say oh thomas you know he needed
[52:25] more faith
[52:26] but thomas made sure he saw jesus
[52:31] instead of going and playing church you
[52:33] need to make sure
[52:34] you see jesus you need to make sure your
[52:38] victory
[52:38] is in the hands of christ where's your
[52:41] victory now
[52:43] because you're not going to find it now
[52:45] go listen to this sermon faith is our
[52:47] victory
[52:48] listen to it today my goodness
[52:51] it's only about an hour or so of
[52:53] preaching and then he has a prayer line
[52:54] and
[52:55] of course there's more preaching in
[52:56] there but that hour is just
[52:58] jam-packed with good stuff but
[53:01] faith is our victory so now
[53:05] uh you have to
[53:08] so thomas goes up and he he touches the
[53:11] hand and he makes sure of his faith
[53:14] so i had to find my spot again and so
[53:17] now
[53:17] thomas goes out from there nobody's
[53:19] going to tell him
[53:20] jesus didn't raise from the dead amen
[53:23] once
[53:24] you've seen christ
[53:27] nobody is going to tell you he didn't
[53:29] raise from the dead
[53:30] you say oh we all believe he rose from
[53:33] the dead
[53:34] yes but not everybody believes he rose
[53:36] from the pages of history
[53:37] in our day so the word is alive to you
[53:41] we have
[53:42] we have fellow believers who have
[53:46] not yet put their hands into the hands
[53:49] of jesus
[53:50] and they say oh you know yeah they're
[53:52] just nodding their head and they're
[53:53] agreeing and they've got some other
[53:55] thing they're following
[53:56] you know but
[54:01] i would rather say i need to put my
[54:04] hands
[54:05] in his palm i'd rather be real and
[54:08] honest and say look i gotta see jesus
[54:10] because guess what jesus says
[54:13] is blessed are those that have not seen
[54:16] but have believed
[54:19] but you can't have one without the other
[54:22] you have to see jesus to believe him
[54:26] you don't have to see him in the
[54:27] physical to believe him but you have to
[54:30] stand
[54:31] in front of him and reach out and touch
[54:34] him
[54:35] and then thomas jesus appeared before
[54:38] thomas and said thomas come see
[54:41] thomas still had an action to make
[54:45] he could have said oh this is a mirage
[54:46] and walked out the door
[54:48] we've seen people do that as hard as it
[54:50] is to believe
[54:51] but thomas took the steps forward
[54:54] reached out his hands
[54:56] and said now now i believe now thomas
[54:59] has a revelation which
[55:00] is what faith really is
[55:04] praise the lord he sought his answers he
[55:07] didn't hide his doubts
[55:09] and god the lord gave him that boost of
[55:12] faith
[55:13] and the lord
[55:16] took his doubt and replaced it with
[55:19] revelation
[55:20] revelation is faith you can't have
[55:22] revelation unless you have faith
[55:24] that what you're reading and living is
[55:26] the truth
[55:27] brother branham says in faith is our
[55:30] victory i'm going to be quoting from
[55:31] that
[55:32] if you'll only believe you can see the
[55:34] glory of god then
[55:36] faith overcomes death i really
[55:38] appreciated that song
[55:39] his undying love made me undying
[55:45] and that's faith so faith overcomes
[55:47] death faith is the victory over death
[55:49] faith is the victory over sin faith is
[55:51] the victory over sickness faith is the
[55:53] victory
[55:54] over worry faith is the victory over
[55:57] frustrations
[55:58] faith is the victory over the world
[56:01] we read that scripture in first john you
[56:04] say
[56:06] john when he wrote that he didn't he
[56:08] didn't have troubles he didn't have an
[56:09] iphone
[56:10] he didn't have the internet he did not
[56:12] have to deal with the folk that i deal
[56:14] with
[56:16] he did not have to go through the things
[56:18] that i do
[56:19] that's right we may not he may not had
[56:22] to deal with the same folk
[56:24] he may not had to overcome the same
[56:26] exact thing same thing
[56:27] but he never excluded them for he said
[56:30] this the faith is the victory that
[56:32] overcomes
[56:33] the world so whatever it is
[56:36] it fits that you've got it fits right
[56:38] there
[56:41] praise the lord the whole thing how is
[56:43] it get
[56:44] faith in it right above it when we have
[56:47] the written word of god
[56:49] laying before us and the holy spirit
[56:51] here performing and showing the
[56:52] resurrection of the lord jesus
[56:54] with the divine promises written here
[56:56] that whatsoever
[56:58] thing you desire when you pray believe
[57:00] you receive it and you shall have it
[57:03] maybe thomas was out praying
[57:06] maybe he was out seeking because he
[57:08] didn't know he didn't know jesus was
[57:09] going to show up
[57:10] they were just having supper maybe
[57:12] thomas was out seeking his answer
[57:14] get away from the crowd sometimes you
[57:15] have to do that so he goes on to say he
[57:17] says when we have okay
[57:19] what's everything you desire what do you
[57:21] have to do then
[57:22] have faith not just floating faith he
[57:25] says floating faith because
[57:26] prior to this he's talking about
[57:28] driftwood and he's like would you rather
[57:30] be driftwood floating down the
[57:32] the sea of the the stream of life or
[57:34] would you rather be a ship crafted by
[57:36] the hand of the master
[57:38] with a destination so he says not just
[57:41] floating faith
[57:42] not just a make-believe faith but a real
[57:44] faith
[57:45] now faith is a conqueror i really
[57:49] really like this here where he gets
[57:50] going here he says uh
[57:52] um it isn't it just isn't a peacemaker
[57:56] now he said well why did he drop that in
[57:57] there because sometimes faith disrupts
[57:59] the world
[58:00] amen do you think jesus made
[58:03] jerusalem with the jews and the romans
[58:06] more peaceful
[58:07] now he turned their world upside down
[58:09] and he turns you turn my world upside
[58:11] down
[58:12] amen thank you jesus that he did
[58:15] so he says now faith is a conqueror
[58:17] faith is an overcomer it just
[58:19] isn't a peacemaker it overcomes faith is
[58:21] the victory that overcomes the world
[58:23] what does it do what is faith what is to
[58:26] conquer
[58:26] conquer and victory is the same to
[58:28] conquer it means to beat down to
[58:31] override
[58:32] to handcuff to throw
[58:36] into prison it means that the sin once
[58:39] ruled you
[58:39] you rule it now it means that you have
[58:42] overcome it you
[58:44] you've whipped it i love the kentucky
[58:47] english
[58:48] you don't whooped it and handcuffed it
[58:50] and you put it in prison
[58:52] and now the devil says oh remember that
[58:54] sin you put in jail
[58:55] well you know what it escaped and it's
[58:58] come back
[58:58] and you say no no no no my victory now
[59:02] is in the hands of christ
[59:04] that thing doesn't exist anymore i'm
[59:06] sorry wrong number
[59:08] click scam you are greater than it is
[59:13] oh he says i feel religious right now do
[59:15] you kind of feel religious right now
[59:17] amen praise the lord thomas found his
[59:20] victory in the palms of jesus
[59:22] and then he found his revelation of who
[59:24] christ was
[59:25] and nothing nobody could tell him jesus
[59:28] didn't raise from the dead
[59:29] amen and this kind of reminds me of
[59:32] another man in scripture
[59:33] a man named job very familiar
[59:37] very long book i recommend you go and
[59:39] you read it
[59:40] if you have a school he'll tell you
[59:41] who's talking when and
[59:43] take your time and break it down it's an
[59:45] incredible story
[59:47] but i'm going to paraphrase it tonight
[59:49] so job loses
[59:51] everything he owned
[59:54] he lost his camels his donkeys his
[59:56] servants
[59:58] one after the other he got the news this
[1:00:01] is gone this is gone this is gone no
[1:00:03] more of this
[1:00:04] and then he gets the news your children
[1:00:06] were at a party the house fell down
[1:00:08] they all died so job is in a really
[1:00:11] really bad
[1:00:11] position he's defeated sitting there
[1:00:17] and we know the story about the devil
[1:00:18] speaking to god
[1:00:20] so he says well you know we didn't touch
[1:00:22] his body so you let me go down touch his
[1:00:24] body he'll curse you to your face
[1:00:26] he says go ahead i trust my servant job
[1:00:28] now how many times do you go through
[1:00:30] things in life
[1:00:31] and you think my goodness what's going
[1:00:33] on and it ain't the devil just
[1:00:34] i mean didn't jesus just bragging on you
[1:00:38] say you go ahead devil but i know my
[1:00:40] child
[1:00:41] and he or she is going to stand the test
[1:00:44] of that
[1:00:44] of that that trial so he gets boils from
[1:00:48] head to toe
[1:00:49] he's sitting on the ash heap being
[1:00:52] rebuked by his friends his three friends
[1:00:55] uh life has bill dad and one other one
[1:00:58] and they're telling look joe you're a
[1:01:00] secret center now how would you like it
[1:01:02] and they turned their backs on him for
[1:01:03] seven days they sat there in silence
[1:01:05] with their backs to him
[1:01:06] for seven straight days now if you had
[1:01:08] everything lost from you and i came over
[1:01:10] to your house
[1:01:11] and i just yelled at you for being a
[1:01:12] secret sinner and then i sat in your
[1:01:13] living room with my back
[1:01:14] turned in my arms folded for seven days
[1:01:17] would you feel comforted
[1:01:21] you would feel even worse you would feel
[1:01:23] even worse so here he is he's
[1:01:25] he's got the lousy while he moves and
[1:01:28] he's down
[1:01:28] he's scraping his boils in the ash heap
[1:01:31] and um
[1:01:32] he he's he's um well he's down okay
[1:01:36] but and thus skipping ahead i
[1:01:39] am i might have to preach a message i
[1:01:41] preached one time about ellie who
[1:01:43] because there's a lot there but
[1:01:45] uh god sends a man by the name of ellie
[1:01:48] who
[1:01:48] a young man and so brother bottom says
[1:01:52] there he was sitting out there trying to
[1:01:54] let the people this is in god perfecting
[1:01:55] his church
[1:01:57] trying to let the people see what a
[1:01:58] condition that man was in sitting out
[1:02:00] there
[1:02:01] everything forsaken him some of his
[1:02:04] church members come down and accuse him
[1:02:06] of being a secret sinner
[1:02:07] turn their back to him for seven days
[1:02:10] what a consolation
[1:02:11] what a bunch of brethren but the man
[1:02:14] knew that he hadn't sinned so
[1:02:16] god's under obligation to visit him so
[1:02:19] he sends
[1:02:20] elihu he says wish we had time to go
[1:02:22] into elihu's name to interpret and to sh
[1:02:24] and show you it was a representation
[1:02:26] representative
[1:02:28] of christ now we're just going to read
[1:02:31] it because i could not
[1:02:33] you read it and you i couldn't i
[1:02:35] couldn't uh
[1:02:36] paraphrase it it was just it was just
[1:02:38] too good so you bear with me
[1:02:40] job chapter 32
[1:02:45] so these three men cease to answer and
[1:02:48] if you read this chapter you get the
[1:02:49] impression that elihu is the one who
[1:02:51] wrote this chapter
[1:02:55] so he says these three men cease to
[1:02:56] answer job because he was righteous in
[1:02:58] his own eyes
[1:02:59] then was kindled the wrath of elihu the
[1:03:02] son of biracial the bazi
[1:03:03] of the kindred of ram against job
[1:03:06] with his wrath kindled because he
[1:03:09] justified himself
[1:03:10] rather than god so job was having a pity
[1:03:13] party
[1:03:14] also against his three friends was his
[1:03:17] wrath kindle because they had found
[1:03:18] no answer and yet had condemned job so
[1:03:21] they're sitting there condemning joe but
[1:03:22] they don't have any answer
[1:03:24] there's nothing they're just condemning
[1:03:26] job and it's not getting anywhere and
[1:03:27] job's sitting there and he's
[1:03:29] feeling bad for himself nellie who's
[1:03:30] just getting madder righteous
[1:03:32] indignation
[1:03:34] now only who had waited till job had
[1:03:35] spoken because they were elder than he
[1:03:40] when elie who saw that there was no
[1:03:42] answer in the mouth of these three men
[1:03:43] then his wrathless kindle
[1:03:45] and elihu the son of rachel the buzz
[1:03:47] light answered and said i am young and
[1:03:48] ye are very old wherefore i was afraid
[1:03:51] and thus not show you my opinion
[1:03:53] i said they should speak and multitude
[1:03:56] of years should teach wisdom but there
[1:03:58] is a spirit in a man and the inspiration
[1:04:00] of the almighty
[1:04:01] giveth them understanding
[1:04:04] great men are not always wise
[1:04:08] neither do the aged understand judgment
[1:04:11] so what he's saying is just because
[1:04:13] you're there's an older person
[1:04:15] in the church doesn't mean they have a
[1:04:17] revelation
[1:04:19] it doesn't mean nothing god is not a
[1:04:21] respecter of persons he doesn't care if
[1:04:23] you've been here for 30 years do you
[1:04:24] have
[1:04:25] a revelation of who christ is and so he
[1:04:28] says
[1:04:30] therefore i said hearken to me i will
[1:04:32] show mine opinion
[1:04:34] behold i waited for your words i gave
[1:04:36] ear to your reasons
[1:04:37] while she searched out what to say so
[1:04:39] you're looking for things to say and i
[1:04:40] could tell you were out of things to say
[1:04:41] but i still waited until you finished
[1:04:44] yeah i attended unto you and behold
[1:04:46] there was none of you that convinced
[1:04:48] job or that answered his words because
[1:04:50] job would come back
[1:04:52] with conversation and ask questions well
[1:04:54] where's god why is this happening what's
[1:04:56] going on here
[1:04:57] and they just stared at him with that
[1:05:00] deer in the headlight look
[1:05:02] um praise the lord yes lest he should
[1:05:06] say we have found that wisdom god
[1:05:07] thrusteth him down
[1:05:09] not man so he says god
[1:05:12] thrusted him down amen not man
[1:05:16] now he hath not directed his words
[1:05:18] against me
[1:05:19] neither will i answer him with your
[1:05:22] speeches
[1:05:23] job didn't condem job didn't get come
[1:05:25] after me
[1:05:26] or argue with me so i'm not going to
[1:05:29] answer him in that manner and i'm not
[1:05:31] going to
[1:05:31] do it the way you guys did it so now
[1:05:34] this is ellie who's speaking to us he
[1:05:36] says they were amazed they answered no
[1:05:39] more
[1:05:40] they shut up they left off speaking when
[1:05:43] i had waited for they spake not but
[1:05:45] stood still and answered no more
[1:05:48] i said i will answer also my part i will
[1:05:51] also will show mine opinion for i am
[1:05:54] full of matter the spirit within me
[1:05:56] constraineth me behold my belly is as a
[1:05:58] wine
[1:05:59] which hath no vent it is ready to burst
[1:06:01] like new bottles
[1:06:02] ellie who is sitting there listening to
[1:06:04] the the to the revelation of man
[1:06:07] listening to the doctrine of man
[1:06:09] but the spirit of christ is raising up
[1:06:11] within him and
[1:06:12] and he's just i want to speak
[1:06:15] i want to speak let me speak let me
[1:06:18] speak so he waits and he waits and he
[1:06:20] waits
[1:06:21] until god's ordained time amen
[1:06:25] there was something within you that was
[1:06:27] waiting to burst forth
[1:06:28] at god's ordained time amen so now
[1:06:32] excuse me i said i will answer also okay
[1:06:36] below my belly is as wine which have no
[1:06:38] vent it is ready to burst like new
[1:06:40] bottles
[1:06:41] i will speak that i may be refreshed i
[1:06:44] will open my lips
[1:06:45] and answer let me not i pray you except
[1:06:48] any man's person
[1:06:49] neither let me give flattering titles
[1:06:51] unto man
[1:06:52] god help us not amen to to
[1:06:56] to to water anything down they meant to
[1:06:58] make someone our friend
[1:07:01] let us speak the truth and always the
[1:07:03] truth
[1:07:04] amen he says for i know not to give
[1:07:07] flattering titles in so doing my
[1:07:09] maker would soon take me away amen
[1:07:13] his maker would soon take away his
[1:07:17] his effectiveness wherefore job i pray
[1:07:20] thee
[1:07:21] hear my speeches and hearken to all my
[1:07:23] words behold now i have
[1:07:24] opened my mouth my tongue has spoken in
[1:07:27] my mouth
[1:07:28] my word shall be of the uprightness of
[1:07:31] my heart and my lips shall utter
[1:07:32] knowledge
[1:07:33] clearly i imagine job is starting to get
[1:07:36] stirred up
[1:07:37] you ever been down and out and then you
[1:07:39] get around a brother who's just
[1:07:40] really feeling the spirit right then
[1:07:42] there and then something within you
[1:07:44] starts up
[1:07:45] to loosen up and you start to get a
[1:07:46] little bubbly filling down inside of you
[1:07:48] amen that's contagious for a child of
[1:07:51] god
[1:07:52] make someone else just get away and
[1:07:54] they're afraid of you so the spirit
[1:07:56] of god hath made me and the breath of
[1:07:58] the almighty
[1:07:59] hath given me life you can see job say
[1:08:02] amen amen if thou
[1:08:06] canst answer me job set thy words in
[1:08:09] order before me and stand up
[1:08:11] if you can answer me you stand up job
[1:08:14] just sits there quietly
[1:08:16] behold i am according to thy wish
[1:08:19] in god's stead amen
[1:08:22] i also informed out of the clay i am a
[1:08:25] man
[1:08:26] but i was sent here to give you a
[1:08:28] message from god
[1:08:30] [Music]
[1:08:31] um you might as well just go on a little
[1:08:33] further behold i am a court okay
[1:08:36] behold my terror shall not make thee
[1:08:38] afraid neither shall my hand be heavy
[1:08:40] upon thee
[1:08:41] and then god doesn't always come god
[1:08:43] doesn't come when you're down and out
[1:08:45] and slap you around he says come on son
[1:08:48] let me tell you who you really are and
[1:08:50] let me tell you who i really
[1:08:52] am and reveal myself to you it's what
[1:08:55] jesus did to thomas thomas walks up and
[1:08:57] jesus says here you go
[1:08:59] and then you probably took thomas into a
[1:09:00] a hug and say thomas
[1:09:02] you got this you got it there's
[1:09:05] something within you you got it
[1:09:07] take this now and tell the rest of the
[1:09:09] world about it

[1:09:23] reached out his hand to job
[1:09:27] and job reached out and put his hand
[1:09:30] and found his victory so now the devil
[1:09:34] comes around
[1:09:35] with with the doubts in his mind and and
[1:09:39] job says
[1:09:39] sorry says where's your victory now

[1:09:51] redeemer

[1:13:29] every curse of the devil faith is the
[1:13:32] victory
[1:13:33] faith in what not faith in your church
[1:13:35] not faith in your creed
[1:13:37] not faith in some man but faith in jesus
[1:13:40] christ
[1:13:41] who made the promise that's the victory
[1:13:44] what is it
[1:13:44] it is the victory say my arm is still
[1:13:47] crippered
[1:13:48] crippled but faith is the victory

[1:14:29] faith is the victory
[1:14:33] thank you lord jesus you still feel sick
[1:14:37] you still have doubts never mind go to
[1:14:40] church anyway
[1:14:42] thomas went never mind don't forsake the
[1:14:45] fellowship of the brethren
[1:14:47] thomas went anyways amen and god came
[1:14:50] and answered his questions
[1:14:54] praise the lord thomas didn't tell jesus
[1:14:55] he needed to put
[1:14:57] his fingers into his hands
[1:15:00] and the disciples didn't have a chance
[1:15:02] to talk to jesus before jesus talked to
[1:15:04] thomas
[1:15:05] jesus already knew thomas
[1:15:09] so in other words lord already knows
[1:15:11] your question
[1:15:13] that's right but is there some step you
[1:15:16] need to take
[1:15:17] is he standing there he's he is standing
[1:15:20] there
[1:15:21] with his arms out saying just walk up
[1:15:24] and put your hands
[1:15:25] right there that's it amen but you have
[1:15:28] to take that step of faith
[1:15:30] amen
[1:15:34] reach out in your doubt anyways
[1:15:37] that's that's what god help us
[1:15:41] it takes revelation that's right
[1:15:44] but the devil's not going to stop
[1:15:48] telling you you don't have it that's
[1:15:50] right amen that's right
[1:15:53] so let me ask you a question is the
[1:15:55] devil a liar
[1:16:00] if you didn't have it do you think he
[1:16:02] would feel the need to remind you of
[1:16:04] that
[1:16:07] if you weren't delivered do you think he
[1:16:09] would have the need to remind you of
[1:16:10] that
[1:16:12] no but see he comes around and he says
[1:16:17] no you're you don't have it
[1:16:20] that right there if you can find nothing
[1:16:23] else
[1:16:24] to base your faith on base your faith on
[1:16:27] the fact that he's telling you you don't
[1:16:28] have it
[1:16:29] because that probably means you got it
[1:16:32] amen he's going to come along and try
[1:16:34] to convince you otherwise but you just
[1:16:39] you say
[1:16:43] okay so so my social security is
[1:16:46] expiring
[1:16:50] my forgiveness of my sin is expiring
[1:16:54] why don't you talk to my husband
[1:17:02] amen don't even listen
[1:17:05] don't even give him a chance don't give
[1:17:07] him an ear
[1:17:10] just say well here talk to my
[1:17:13] talk to my husband
[1:17:16] amen god will replace that doubt in your
[1:17:20] life
[1:17:20] with revelation and then nothing
[1:17:23] can turn you aside musicians want to
[1:17:26] come tonight
[1:17:30] praise the lord amen it's
[1:17:33] your faith faith is our victory
[1:17:37] where do we get faith in the word of god
[1:17:42] more you read it even if you don't
[1:17:44] understand it you read it and god is
[1:17:46] going to give you
[1:17:46] revelation don't sit
[1:17:50] and hide in your doubt don't sit with
[1:17:53] your doubt hiding behind a facade
[1:17:56] i don't like fake people i understand
[1:18:00] that when you meet them i have a heart
[1:18:03] i want them to find jesus and find
[1:18:06] a way to to because many people build up
[1:18:09] barriers in their life because they've
[1:18:10] had
[1:18:11] issues they've been hurt or all this
[1:18:14] but with god with christ you have to
[1:18:18] bear everything you've got to take your
[1:18:21] bucket your suitcase of garbage and just
[1:18:25] dump it out and not be ashamed because
[1:18:28] god is looking down with eyes of grace
[1:18:32] god ha god is the lord jesus is your
[1:18:36] friend
[1:18:37] he's ready he says he says i've been
[1:18:39] standing here waiting for you to hand me
[1:18:41] that suitcase
[1:18:43] i'm strong enough you're not strong
[1:18:45] enough to carry it but i
[1:18:46] am let me have it put that
[1:18:49] put that burden it doesn't have to be a
[1:18:52] sin that you need to live or not just be
[1:18:54] a burden
[1:18:54] a burden for a loved one or a burden for
[1:18:56] your family
[1:18:58] or a burden of and that's that you just
[1:19:01] need to let go of
[1:19:03] you put in the hands of jesus
[1:19:06] who better to to take it and deal with
[1:19:09] it for you
[1:19:10] because let me ask you this have you
[1:19:12] solved it yet
[1:19:15] no you can't put it in the hands of the
[1:19:17] devil
[1:19:19] he'll just put it back in yours but you
[1:19:22] put it in the hands of jesus and
[1:19:23] he'll take it away from you
[1:19:29] and then you'll be out living life like
[1:19:32] thomas was fishing with peter on the
[1:19:34] lake
[1:19:35] [Music]
[1:19:38] excuse me and um
