amen it's it's just been a beautiful time on family night amen i look back on history see a mighty god unbelievable improving over and over that his work can never fail but i can't keep on dwelling on some past memory cause he's the same god who's living in me oh the same god too many to detect [Applause] he's the same god [Music] who created all the heavens and all the earth came back living in jesus and there's power in his word but now in these last days i'm beginning to see that it's the same god who's living in me yes the same [Music] too many contests [Music] he's the same god [Music] [Music] he's the same god whose wonders too many to tell the same god [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] living in me oh i look back on history see almighty god [Music] memory is the same god who's living in me can you scape into that for they've got to spoke [Music] same [Music] [Music] who's living in me can you say amen to that this morning hallelujah hallelujah have no doubt this morning saints that god is inside these walls amen he came with you amen he said i'll be with you and i'm going to guide you hallelujah how can we go wrong how can we go wrong hallelujah well i have just a couple little quick announcements here that i just want to put out before we go into scripture um praise the lord sister sharon sister christine all of the family god's blessed them with a house can we say thank you lord you know that's one of the things you know the prophet said just keep on planting your potatoes and that's a real real revelation to me even though we don't grow potatoes you've got to put the seed in the ground to get a harvest amen and god has blessed them they've bought a house we were blessed to dedicate that the other evening amen just a lovely time some laughter the presence of god come down just commit that house to be a house of the lord and so now that i've got you all excited and saying amen i need some brothers let's see some brothers some brothers brothers brothers brothers brothers brothers on this coming saturday when they shared with me that yes they have time to move in but they need to somehow get their beds upstairs and they need to get a washer and a dryer upstairs and chester drawers upstairs and i looked at that and i said this is not something that we as a church sit back and say hope you figured that out amen so i'm asking you brothers and sisters this coming saturday if you would be so gracious to help our sisters our brother joseph mary move into their new house and um then i promised them they could pay us back that we would give them a house warming amen at a little date after they got settled so please i ask you as your brother is your friend reserve some time this coming saturday and some of you and i say that saying myself also might have some limited time because of work but let's not hold back um uh i say it this way and i put it to myself if i can't give the effort will you please give the effort on my behalf amen and let's just get them moved out of their their rental i give them time to clean it up and get settled into their new home so i ask that as your brother i also would like to meet with the trustees for just a very short meeting after the service today let's turn in our bibles i want to speak to you uh once again on redemption's manifestation we want to talk about the two vines and the two revelations and we're going to take a slightly different course as it is today uh but we will did i give you those notes brother alex the revised version for today okay okay so i just felt a little led while we're going down this same path uh a little bit led of the lord to to just kind of go into another thought today and uh so while we're gonna look at this whole picture as we see right here we have our lord jesus christ and we know what the word says about him of lucifer one reference in scripture commonly called satan or the devil we know what the word says about him we see all these attributes and we'll be moving down through these lord willing uh in the next few weeks or a period of time and there is such a broad if i could put it that way a such a broad subject line in other words as we look at this right here uh saints there's uh i i don't want to exaggerate there's a thousand sermons here uh we just want by god's grace and leadership to be able to go into that and and uh bring out the parts that i believe by by uh the leadership of the lord that would be um beneficial to us as a body of believers uh let's go to matthew the fourth chapter uh verses one through eleven and um this i want to use as a foundation today uh as we would move forward matthew 4 and 1 lovely lovely portions of scripture now saints i just want to share a little something with you i don't want to go in details but the devil has been assaulting you might say in a physical realm uh my family and uh it has to do with possessions it has to do with a robbery and uh i think about what the prophet of god talked about how that he just called the holy ghost on the scene and god laid that upon that man to return and we just have a need then i would ask for your prayers that god would just restore to us what is our rightful property and as we look at that we realize that satan is warring against us while the scripture says that we wore not against flesh and blood we realize the devil uses flesh and blood amen he's not afraid to anoint someone and that's why the scripture tells you and i that we should each day fortify ourselves in the word of god because satan comes in he anoints and it seems perfectly normal this is a thing that people miss saints is they can be anointed by a spirit but under the anointing of that spirit everything seems to be perfectly normal i feel the way i feel because of this this this this and this and i'm doing what i'm doing because of this this this and this and that is normal but under that anointing see the anointing is the only thing that makes that normal without that anointing on it people would say i would never say that i would never do that now i just want to go ahead and share this little idea on the way to church today this is a real live just happened event we're driving along and uh sister jerry's keen eye she goes look a coyote and i'm looking at the coyote he is a big beautiful coyote he's standing out in a pasture i'm focused on the coyote and i hate to admit this in church but i was thinking i could hit him from here and anyway sorry that was just my thoughts and so as we go by i said wow isn't that a coyote that's quite and jerry says did you see the sheep and i said sheep and she said yes they're all crowded up in the corner of the pasture so we do a u-turn and we go back and here is about a dozen sheep and they are crowded up into the corner all just pushing pushing pushing further into the corner and here is mr coyote out there in the deep grass of this pasture just moving along ever so slowly now look saints it's obvious the sheep are nervous they are now now just let me do this symbolically okay here they are okay sister sue i need you to just move a little closer to the coyote i'm just going to move in behind you and uh anyway i hope it works out for you no that's what they were doing they are pushing behind each other to the fence to getting in there and the one who got pushed to the outside said whoa why did that brother do that to me anyway we pulled up there and uh i jumped out and i started yelling at this coyote and he was so terrified he ran about 10 feet and he stopped and looked back and i decided i needed to do a little more than yell at him now imagine how i felt saints i got a tie on a dress shirt and i'm standing in the middle of the highway screaming go get hey and he runs 10 more feet and stops and looks at me finally i thought my goodness we're going to have to have a pentecostal revival to get this coyote out of here so i started screaming at the top of my lungs and jumping up and down and waving my arms imagine the people that lived in that house right there thought what kind of lunatic has stopped in front of our house today but you see it didn't take just a common okay now coyote saints we have the power of the word but you are going to have to put all of heaven behind it right seven sons of siva hey we don't even know who you are they beat them up and run them out amen if you want to chase off the devil saints you're going to have to be a hundred percent committed to chasing off the devil anyway we drove up it was pretty funny i have to share this side of the story i told jerry i said i need to tell these people this coyotes in the pasture with their sheep we pull up in there i knock on the door a man with a shirt white crisp white shirt and a black tie and cargo pants the shirt tail hanging out he opens the door he looks at me kind of smiles goes i'm on a zoom call and i was like okay well i'm on my way to church and i told him about the coyotes i got back in the car and jerry goes you know what i'm sure he's lds and he probably took his elder tag off and put it in his pocket when he answered the door because i'm telling you a white shirt untucked a tie hair combed cargo pants and flip-flops i don't know we live in quite a world don't we oh praise the lord you love the lord today amen matthew 4 1. amen then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil oh my goodness saints god would put you i hope you don't mind me including this in our vocabulary day god would put you in knowing that there could be a coyote right there whoa my god's not very nice to us imagine there was jesus led of the spirit not led of man not led of some priest but led of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward a hunger and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god and i don't mean to change scripture today saints but i just want you to catch where we're headed if thou be sons and daughters of god right it didn't end with jesus if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread and he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god then the devil taking him up into the holy city okay see the correlation the tempter is the devil and said of him upon the pinnacle of the temple and saith unto him if thou be the son of god see satan don't give up easy you can rebuke him once for who who he weigh his vocabulary but he doesn't give up cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee now i want to inject this right now my brother and sister the the law of the first fruits of the harvest we understand it right everything that applied to jesus christ applies to you and i in the proper context right so he didn't have one gift for himself and another gift for us amen in fact if we actually believe that god lives in us amen remember zipper steps in as brother jason watkins put it he wants to get in your car amen he wants you to take him downtown he wants you to take him somewhere amen so you look at this and see now saints he shall give his angels charge concerning thee can you just read that for yourself i'm going to stop for just a moment i want you to read that for yourself amen he shall give his angels charge concerning thee hallelujah my quiet this morning and in their hands they shall bear thee up left at any time thou shalt dash thy feet against a stone jesus said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god again the devil taking him up into exceeding high mountain and showing him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and saith unto him all these things will i give thee you have to have in possession to give amen if thou wilt fall down and worship me then saith jesus unto him get thee hints satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold angels come and minister unto him father we ask for your leadership today lord just as we speak your word father lord let it only be your word your thoughts we pray lord we bind to every contrary thought and spirit and lord just the saints could be a free father to worship you today lord we thank you let the spirit of sleepiness lord the spirit of distraction all of those be bound in the name of jesus christ amen amen and amen you may be seated as we look at this saints we see a formula put in place it is uh often times i'm i i look at things kind of analytically and uh you know i look sometimes for for the key words that would unlock a things that follow them sometimes the keyword actually follows what is to be unlocked we get an idea then we see the key is available to us and so here this formula was put in place one jesus answered and says it is written amen our one and only position that we want to take is not i think i feel i want but it is written amen so when we can come to the place we identify with the word of god without having to adjust it as one brother says some people like to massage the word of god amen slowly molding it into what they believe it should say but we're not there we're going to stick with the written word amen it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god and as we look through this scripture this would be maybe homework uh for you or something to preach on at another time but when you look through the bible you will find a very uh uh uh strong uh continuum of idea or thought about being fed amen god over and over speaks to us about the word the carcass uh the bread of life all of these things and so we could recognize or take a position that as sons and daughters of god we don't just get saved we don't just get the holy ghost and then just go on as though nothing happened we are fed we we have to come back just as it is in the natural we have to come back to the word of god and feed over and over and over again now my brother and sister i i don't have a problem if you like things like mac and cheese and and you like some of that stuff you know i know believers good strong i think they're real christians that actually eat snack ramen and so you look at these kind of things my brother and sister we're not trying to take it in a context but i will tell you that if you quit eating or your diet is made up of things that have no real uh nutritional value now some people don't like us speaking on this but i believe that it's necessary that we we kind of have a reminder because there's spirits in the land my brother and sister if you want to have a diet of god sent a prophet i i have to say amen to that i'm so thankful i can't even tell you how thankful i am but the scripture says that we're going to go where the carcass is and the carcass is the word amen now without a prophet to lead us or point to the carcass we would be lost we would still be catholics and baptists and methodists and whatever or maybe just nothing at all but you look at this and realize that in that god did not want us to just stop and focus that he sent a prophet amen that is actually kind of looking back from our position today in a historical thing now that god sent a prophet now look at the supernatural let's just stop for a moment look at this supernatural things uh that happened in uh uh well it wouldn't be some of you's generation but uh in most of us here today's generation amen the 20th century look at the supernatural things that were happening they were hearts discerned minds discerned see there's a difference there amen there was healing and there was supernatural power amen i knew there was something there that's the color of sister jerry's hair my look at that um there was supernatural events that took place and uh in our midst i'm going to put it in a present tense in our midst supernatural can someone say amen it wasn't just some superficial but it was supernatural it was in a sense other than being a christian uh unexplainable how a little girl could be there having had uh uh it passes my mind right now just have the image in my mind but there she is in her braces it was like polio or whatever and and you know the picture i would call it around the message as being famous there's the mother and she's there and there's that little girl it's not superficial saints that that little girl who was committed to her life to be on those braces walked again without any support that is not something that we can just brush to the side and say oh that's wonderful that is the supernatural coming down my brother and sister you we can sit here today and say well praise the lord that was for the prophet no it wasn't i can take you clearly in the word of god that's for sons and daughters of god in our generation to have that kind of authority in the word of god amen it's satan like that sneaky little coyote today that's cornering the sheep in the corner and they are there going i just hope i survive later to see a much less be some phenomena as it were of laodicea to speak the word i'm just hoping i can just hold on well hallelujah maybe god brother jason and i joke for just a second you know amen maybe god will just send a pastor a preacher evangelist a teacher that will come out and stop and stand in the middle of the road and say devil get out of here we are sheep we are not of your kind we are not of your world we are sons and daughters of god oh we can get excited kathleen i don't mean to set you up but we can get excited about that but what about the bride of christ getting into her position looking out and seeing that old devil and saying in the name of jesus christ i blind you satan amen it's one thing to give it to a great man of god a powerful prayer warrior give it to a man that god has manifested to but i want to ask you what about you did god call you just to sit on a pew twice a week did god call you just to look through your bible a few times a week no he didn't he called you to be warriors amen to recognize the enemy and know the ground that the enemy would approach you on you say what ground is that brother paul i say each one of us has a weakness in the flesh the prophet of god told us when you recognize that weakness in your life cover it up with the blood don't just say well i i just hope or i pray or i think or whatever no take the blood cover it up and then walk with confidence as sons and daughters of god hallelujah what satan would like to do is get us to where we're afraid oh saints listen to me he'd like to get us to the place that we're afraid to stand up and take a stand because we're afraid how loud he'll roar the next day well go ahead satan roar you might even have a bike you might even get a bite but you won't be victorious the word says amen it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god our second part of the formula it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god now my brother and sister i'm going to apply this in a slightly different fashion you cannot go out here and flirt with the devil and expect god to run to your rescue every single time amen you get to the place that you want to flirt with the devil you're walking on thin ice anyhow amen and you come to the place that just time and time again you'll go out here and flirt with these things of the world you'll immerse yourselves in the things of the world oh hallelujah i'm preaching to you amen i'm not talking to just you i'm talking to me too you can't go out there and just keep flirting with that and not expect to leave some kind of a bite in your life satan will leave his mark will god forgive you will god heal you from that yes he will but you go out there my brother and sister and you give him the opportunity to bite you he'll bite you hallelujah amen the third part of the formula get the hints satan amen we're not standing at the door inviting him in we are chasing him out get thee satan once again look at this for it is written amen hallelujah thou shall worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve amen now verse 11 come down and said the devil leaveth him and behold the angels came and ministered unto him now saints i'll tell you what in the time of struggle the time of trouble if we'll just cry out to the lord if we'll call him on the scene if we'll resist the devil i'm i'm telling you now uh using this type here the angels will come down and minister to you but you've got to stand up you've got to have some kind of resistance and say you know what satan it is written i may not have the authority to as it were to cast you out satan i might not have many things that we see in our lord jesus christ or in a prophet's ministry but i'm a daughter of god i'm a son of god and i'm telling you get out of here i'm going to stick with the bible i'm going to stick with the word amen and i want you to get out of here and when you'll stand with that kind of resistance this is not something a big chess beating satan leave no just stand in your humble position as a daughter or son of god and say you know what i i've been sealed by the blood of jesus christ and satan you've got nothing to fear from me but the word that is within me you can't overcome see we got to get the word from being external to get it internal some people struggle with that they're like well i don't know you know the idea well the holy ghost is in me and and but no no my brother and sister the prophet of god said it was all god i've got god in me amen i don't have just some form i don't have some ideology i don't have some verbage i've got god and when we recognize that it's actually god in us amen we do believe the prophet's message don't we amen i'm not just talking from my hat amen he said god is in you amen now you don't have to stand and scream and holler if you've got god in you amen and lucifer has been trying all these generations to overcome god but the word declares that in the end he failed anyhow and so what he's got to do is before you get to the end of the book he's got to convince you that you're not you know saints i i'm a terrible person i love to read sisters who bless her heart has bought me a lot of books through the years and i appreciate that so much but i have this horrible habit i start reading a book chapter 6 chapter 7 chapter 8 chapter 12 chapter 25 who done it what the devil doesn't realize is god anointed you to look in the book not just to labor through all of the do's and the don'ts get caught up in the ah we're here and and thou shalt not but god allowed you to get over here in the book of revelation look how the prophet was anointed ordained of god to take us saints to the end of the book amen we could have labored on through about you this and you that and you can and you can't and but no he was anointed of almighty god to take it oh oh sister carrie come here go to the end of the book this is where you live is in the end of the book hallelujah not in the two in the don't oh we can get caught up in that and preachers get caught up in that and y'all you're all bad people i've said in services where the preacher said there's not a one of you in here that's worthy and i was like amen people look at you what are you talking about buddy he just he just blasted us no no i read in my bible i'm not worthy oh hallelujah he is though he said i am worthy because he is worthy oh i don't care what that preacher's mentality was and what his condemning message was the word said it is written oh hallelujah it is written i'm sorry i'm just a little excited my goodness i don't mean don't feel sorry for me but those thieves tried to come back last night and sister jerry woke me up about 1 10 this morning said paul something's wrong i got in a pickup and i accosted them on the upper ditch bank and they gave some story but they ran but you know what praise the lord i got their license number the deputy said who is it he sends me a picture i said that's the guy hallelujah well i might not ha know how to overcome that but the deputy does hallelujah and what is the deputy he's the authority and i may not know how to overcome everything saints but the authority of the word is advocating on my behalf on your behalf amen we might not be able to run across satan face to face but our advocate has no fear of the devil oh hallelujah hallelujah oh sister jerry and i i'm sorry i didn't even intend to make this public knowledge but sister jerry and i was just like nope we're not letting this hold us down we're not letting this done they stole thousands and thousands of dollars of stuff but my brother and sister we looked at each other and said it's just stuff hallelujah if i never get it back it doesn't matter because i'm a son of god and this is not my world hallelujah satan you failed today amen you failed i'm going to preach the word amen i'll tell you brother chris said you know what if this is i i can help you out or whatever and something come over me and i said no i'm following this through i'm preaching today hallelujah now in the thy tyrant church age amen uh oh here we go here we go hallelujah now i read this quote to you the other day and i hope you don't mind we just backtrack a little bit amen revelations 2 24 25 but unto you i say and to the rest of tatara as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of satan as they speak i will put on you none other burden but that which ye have already hold fast till i come now before we go into the promise let me show you again that the church as spoken of by the spirit in this book has two vines whose interwinding branches compose it now my brother and sister do you catch that it's interwinding in other words as we are going to come here now this is just a time nobody take to this when we come here we're not going to be able to come right out in the congregation amongst the body of christ with as it were even a spiritual hatchet and just start hacking away amen the word will do that man don't need to men don't need to come and condemn you the word is the two-edged sword amen in fact it's sharper than a two-edged sword now i've seen those little swords these guys like to make them i've seen one of those where the guy says let me show you this and he took that thing it was about that long sword gleaming all embedded with all kinds of gold and had some real precious gems in it and he said just hold up a piece of paper and i'm like i ain't holding up no paper with you swinging that thing around he said i ain't swinging in anywhere i held up a piece of paper he let the weight of the blade come down on that paper and it just went zip through it not a wrinkle not a tear cut that paper perfectly you think about it sharper sharper than that oh hallelujah so while this thing is interwinding itself into the body of believers into the church that we call the body of christ amen that sword is there my brother and sister and in the right season that sword will start to carve those things out and cut it away but i say unto you and unto the rest and thy tire as many as have not this doctrine there it is he is speaking to the two groups one has a doctrine another house not there they are now i don't want anybody to misunderstand my brother and sister we're not pointing this in anybody but it's my job to lay a groundwork that you as a son or daughter of god know where you stand amen we're not here to throw stones because if we was i would put right up on this screen the quotes of what people said and things that were done and then we would just bash that but that's not what it's about i want to see you make a rapture and now if god anoints us to have to deal with issues do you want me to shirk my duty amen so we're not throwing stones at no one so i i don't want that spirit to take root here that brother paul's throwing stones because you know i was a pretty good pitcher in high school and i don't need to just like lob the stone i can throw it pretty straight amen as many as how that's not there it is he's speaking to two groups one has a doctor and another house not there they are scattered abroad across the nation with each one's doctrine opposing the other one is of god knowing his depths the other of satan knowing the depths of satan i will put upon you none other burden the word for burden is weight or pressure amen so whatever pressure is present in your life is because god allowed it to be there god said this pressure is necessary for paul haley to make a rapture whoa but i could sit in my room and say oh woe is me or i can say thank you lord that you're so mindful of me you put just the right amount of pressure on me oh hallelujah oh my i could give you about a hundred examples that are relevant to that but we don't have that time amen now look the pressure of the dark ages was either bend or be broken that pressure is still present amen bow or die it was the inquisition the power of the empire backing up satanic worship i'm telling you my brother and sister you can't pray in school but you can bring all kinds of satanic symbols you can't have a cross of calvary and walk your child walk into a public school but a child can walk in with a satanic symbol on a t-shirt and no one says anything young people remember music manipulation they're symbols they're signs there's things it's all relevant and it's there those kids walk in there my brother and sister they walk into the schools with t-shirts on that have skulls dripping blood from big teeth and all this kind of stuff no problem walk in there with a picture of the crucifixion of jesus christ and they expel them tell me it's not the day my brother and sister tell me it's not the day amen each age had its pressures for example a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches now you know what not one of us here today i touched on this the other day but not one of us here would say we're rich but let me take you to different part of the world let me take you around the other side of the world just go ahead and pinpoint yourself on the globe on the other side of the world and you'll find out that we as americans are rich whether you think so or not the pressure of riches well i've got a lifestyle i've got to maintain it i have to work my 60 70 80 hours to live this lifestyle and i'm going to live this lifestyle pressure pressure boss says we need you to work time we need you to work on sunday okay no problem i'll go work on sunday because wow is that a blessing from almighty god no no come on saints let's just face it satan's slippery amen pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions in a complex age now i know none of you are ever nervous but there's times i find myself so nervous i had a brother say oh brother paul you look so calm when you walk up to preach that's because all my bones have turned to jelly and i'm just kind of hurting the jelly along as i head to the pulpit yeah i know there's no nervous walking because jelly doesn't get nervous it's already nervous nervous tensions in a complex age you want to talk about complex age here's my phone oh a 10 year old you need me to do the blah blah blah blah blah okay what's your code what code you have a code you have an apple id you have a i don't know ask sister jerry okay done talk about complex come on i'll throw another side of complex to you i hope it doesn't offend anyone your child is a fifth grader or so in school and they want to teach them the intimacies of life at that age that's complex no longer can children be children children or an object and the more children we control that means we've won or lost no my brother and sister ten thousand worlds ten thousand worlds ten thousand worlds it's not a matter of who we are and what we control it's a matter of putting it in the right perspective we seem unfitted to live in i say amen this fourth age this is this is not even talking about our day saints but remember how the prophet god showed us these spirits carry right on a man seems to have a clear-cut burden it was to defy rome stand up for the word even unto death they have not known the depths of satan it seems that this verse has been left out by the commentators for they were not able to figure out what doctrine or what experiences are meant by this phrase actually it is simple to know what is men let us first know what is the depth of god is what the depth of god is oh my saints come on i want you to do sometimes we preach about negative things i don't mean to set an atmosphere about negative things like oh brother paul's always just hammering on that but my brother and sister as we press into the word of god we have a prayer life we read our bibles can we say amen to that we're pressing into the things of god we start to realize the depth of who god is and the more grace that you know the more grace you can bestow hallelujah if you've never known grace then you don't know what grace is but when you have fallen and god has poured grace out upon you it's a lot easier to look at someone and say god just please touch them amen there's no eject button there's no dump button there's no throw em out button because by god's grace you realize if without his grace that would be you hallelujah but you look at this and the prophet of god is taking this example saints that you cannot know the depths of satan unless you have come to the depths of god now let me put it a little stronger to you if god is a superficial element to you then satan will be a superficial element to you if you have by the grace of god knowing the power of almighty god and seen the supernatural you will recognize that that equal or opposite force satan is there and he will be just that little nothing in the side of the pit but he isn't there now people who trivialize him now pay the price for trivializing him now saints the word says we'll put him under our feet that doesn't mean he's trivial that means it shows the massive incredible awesome glorious power of my god that holds him under your feet as a conquered as a vanquished enemy it's a powerful god he's not just a little wiggle wiggle down there and you've got a foot on him he's powerful but the power of god is promised to be displayed in the bride of christ through the word of god revealed in this hour it would come and manifest that the word is all revealed the word is all-powerful the word is capable oh pardon me for not having better vocabulary but we just have to realize see you can't know the depths of satan without knowing the depths of god that's why my brother and sister we live in a world where people do satanic worship and they do all these kind of things and think nothing of it they're just like oh i know it's just no different i mean i could have been a buddha you realize why they can say that it stumps us especially as older generation stumps us is how they can be so just just you know nothing just now i mean go to the occult or become a buddha or become a whatever no big deal you know why they do that because they don't know the depths of god they have no clue what they're dealing with no clue at all now i told you about that video clip about how they're just showing this showing these kids if your parents make you make your bed and clean up your clothes that you just take something from your room something special to you go find a place in the woods go lay that down and offer it yeah yuck is right but you see what they're doing did they ever say you know what got a problem with your parents turn to jesus no no and they play with that because they have no idea of the depths of god so they have no idea of the depths of satan there's about 10 avenues to go off of that and most of you wouldn't like me to even venture down the first one much less get to number 10. so we'll just move on here you see my brother and sister ephesians 3 16 says that he would grant you according to the riches of his goal to be strengthened with might by his spirit on the flesh no because the prophet of god said you can be anointed on the flesh all the days of your life and go to hell this anointing's going to make it down into the inner man you know what i want to do hallelujah i hope you all don't mind here under my tie i got a zipper and i'm just going to go ahead and unzip this here and i'm just going to invite the lord in got you all nervous somebody's like what's he doing but you got to do that you got to do that saying you got to unzip that and say lord come in the inner man it's not going to do on the outside we can jump shout sing we can sing like angels and we can sing all night my brother and sister that won't make the holy spirit move in fact as i have been a little bit vocal about that bale pior was one giant concert god never forgave him for it study it out see that's the problem people don't even bother to study it's just another chunk of scripture this flake right over it like no big deal that was a long time ago i'm sorry that spirit never died they went down there and worshiped together god said you don't belong there i don't want mixers i want separators amen now people don't like that preaching they think you're defending turf no saints i'm going to be a little rough with you for just a moment you go to church where you want to go to church you have no obligation to come to this building or sit under this ministry but i'm telling you right now you need to know what your friends believe because they can believe all kinds of things and just not speak it to you and then you go along all chummy tummy and then you wonder why chaos and all hell if you don't mind me saying that word has come to your life amen we'll touch on that in just a minute i actually have a quote that wasn't an accident that was intentional in case anybody wanted to know hallelujah am i being too mean saints i want to see you make a rapture i i don't want you to be out here playing namby pamby whatever with the devil and then wonder why you missed the rapture i want you to buckle down have a little grit be real men real women and say you know what even though it hurt the word says it i'm going to stand with it amen hallelujah because people i don't go into any greater detail but people quit church because they're offended for their friend we don't even know if the friend was offended they're just offended for their friend and they quit come on saints prophet of god said that the word can't offend the word the word in you cannot be offended by the word be preached oh that doesn't mean that a man can be mean and ugly about it and then retreat to the word and call it his excuse we're talking about the word preached in love amen see when a man experiences the depth of god in his life it's an actual personal experience of the spirit of god indwelling him now this is something here again i've already started down this path i guess i'll just kind of trot down it just a little further my brother and sister i preached it before i preached in a a different church and people got offended but you see my brother and sister if we're not careful we're going to go back to being a people that are looking to stories and looking to icons and looking to as it were historical events amen that spirit is amongst us amen i have a good friend i love the man he looked at me one time i've set in brother branham's rocking chair well praise the lord i never have never have and i doubt if i'll ever be invited to sit in that rocking chair but i i wanted to ask him i kind of did in a way what did it do for you now we know that being thrown in on a prophet's bones amen i'm not saying that something wouldn't happen there saints but you see i'm not looking for an icon i'm not looking for something like that amen i'm not insulting this man i actually love this man i could tell you the story how far it goes back goes right back into my childhood i love this man but my brother and sister i'm sorry i don't care if you sit in that rocking chair every sunday afternoon for the rest of your life you still got to be born again you got to feed on the word of god you've got to pray for revelation and you've got to stand up and confess it from the heart that i am a believer see this is nothing about it amen i i was thrilled years ago we got to go down to tucson go through brother branham's house they weren't letting people go through the house at that time but you know that's i guess kind of maybe privilege or whatever i don't mean to put it that way but you know we were invited to go ahead and walk through the house and we got to go through the library and we got to have a little more personal side of of a visitation there my brother and sister that was neat i lapped it up you might say just like everybody else did oh my look at this brother brown's guns here's his trophies there's a caribou here's a bear but in the end i have to have the holy ghost i've got to have a prayer life i've got to read my bible amen look i don't mean to make light of this but nobody's going to walk in that day to the white throne judgment and say i saw the bear yeah that's right they ain't going to do it hallelujah okay i'll try to be kinder for the rest of the service maybe time we leave some of you will smile at me but look at this i'm kind of jumping around forgive me but the depths of satan will be in that he will attempt to destroy this see what god wants is to have the spirit of god himself indwelling and his mind be illuminated by the wisdom and the knowledge of god through the word but the depths of satan will be that he will attempt to destroy this what will he do he'll take it back you know what my brother and sister do you know i'm capable of preaching sermons i know you guys some of you will be shocked i'm capable of preaching sermons that you all walk out with this warm fuzzy feeling oh my that was so wonderful hallelujah come on anybody want to be warm and fuzzy today we can finish the sermon that way but i can assure you that warm and fuzzy won't get you in a rapture when you got an adversary standing right outside well brother brown said he comes to church so he's sitting somewhere on a pew around here hey man that warm and fuzzy ain't going to do it amen i want you to be real warriors goes back and study uh part of the 101st airborne going to vietnam uh they're they're training the the uh i think he was a captain at that time uh training guys they were down there in georgia in the sweltering swamps and he ran them guys till they collapsed and he run them and he did stuff and finally in the very end he took them out there and wire and mud and real machine gun bullets over their head just just barely where they had to crawl with their face in the mud and they're all like we hate you but did you know that that particular unit or brigade or whatever it was gets to vietnam had the lowest casualty rate of any unit that went to vietnam and when they were there i hope you see the spiritual side of this when they were there they started coming to him when they saw other units being just wiped out and they come and they started to thank him i say to you i hope someday we can stand together and this sounds a little selfish but i hope you can look at me at that time and say i understand it now brother paul i understand it amen we don't want casualty rates here amen we want every son and daughter of god in this building this morning to make a rapture stand in the presence of almighty god hallelujah and we don't want to lose the one some people just take this idea where we lost some here and we lost some here no big deal no it's real to me saints i don't i don't want to see it amen he's going to make a substitute for the reality of god now wednesday night we preached on those things real realization amen partial versus complete how will he do it he'll take away the knowledge of the truth of god saints i want you can i can i be forceful this morning i've just been kind of playing around can i be forceful can i make a demand on you i say this in a figurative form okay so you don't you have to read the message or listen to it however you you have to get into your bible you have to get to the place that whatever comes your way you can stop and the storm is blowing and it's blowing and things are blowing away and things are falling down and you can stand there and say thank you lord hallelujah my brother and sister because he's trying to take away the knowledge you say well the knowledge no we have all of the message brother paul you don't understand we have all of the tapes yeah but what did he say in there i gotta hurry up i gotta hurry up hey man we got a lot of things to do today places to go people to see he will then substitute the personal christ in our spirits and he will do it as caused israel to do the same right now my brother and sister i want you to interject and i'm going to throw this right out here hope it don't offend people but i'm not going to back away from it he calls israel do the same do you know what caused israel to go down to baal pior it wasn't get this it wasn't the holy ghost it was some men saying you know what if we're going to have any unity in the message we need to go down here and worship with them well good i'll put it this way they want to have unity why don't they come up here i'm not going down there you want unity come up here hallelujah look up look up your redemption draweth nigh it doesn't say anything about going down there hallelujah but you see how those spirits work if you want to have unity and we want to have unity you come down here and you participate in our program you go study what the prophet of god said he said they come down there into a false worship amen they come down there into that and somebody told them hey it's good oh i know somebody's going to say i'm a message anti whatever i don't really care i don't care because i can take you right in the bible and i can show you right there god said i'll never forgive them what the prophet of god say he says sin will take you further than you wanted to go i'm not anti-nothing saints i have no problem i could sit down and eat a meal with anybody but when it comes to the house of god and worship i'm sorry there's some places i ain't going and i don't care how much advertising bail pior's got amen that's a little rough and i saw some of you are probably feeling like i'm skinning on you and i'm sorry but just please just understand accept it as is god speaking because uh you come down here when we come to the place see he said substitute the personal christ he'll do it as he calls israel to do the same a man they respected they loved said hey it's going to be good for all of us after all we can trace our lineage right back and we're all one well i'm sorry according to the word i'm not ouch by a human being reigning as king instead of going now i want to move on i'm laboring on something i never intended to labor on but my brother and sister when a man will look you in the face and says well as pastor as a priest as a i think you should do this and this and this it would be good for your church good for you people fellowship is good for all of us brother paul it says here to have true fellowship light doesn't have fellowship with darkness now when i go with the one who tells me that that fellowship will be a blessing to my church who did i listen to yeah by a human being reigning as king instead of god now saints i want to clarify this you go where you want to go you do what you want to do if you feel like brother paul is too hoarse then i'm offended in myself not you offending me i never intend to be harsh but i do intend to be able to stand one day and hear well done my good and faithful servant amen i don't need the pleasure of man here and i would hope that you didn't either amen but you see the born-again experience will be rejected in favor of a church joining amen okay we'll move on this has got some of you looking sad i don't want you to leave sad today hallelujah hallelujah you know saints now sometimes these things are a little personal okay and we're human but i find it interesting when people who don't agree with you are telling you why you're actually preaching that you preach that because you feel insecure okay i preach it because i feel insecure for them ouch as long as god is calling it's got to be some formula wonder why i used the word formula a little bit ago i kind of cheated it's right here in this quote it's got to be the same formula not shake hands repeat it creed be baptized but be baptized by the holy ghost and to the body of jesus christ that's the way the christian church is to be run not by creeds not by denomination not by education not by theology but by the baptism of the holy spirit to lead men and women he will never lead you away from the word of god he'll lead you right to the word of god because man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god that proceeds out of the mouth of god amen so you know saints i don't want to sound like just you know blowing steam to you the prophet of god stands right behind it i am standing right in that anointing where he come as a prophet to an age amen i got no reason you know look saints what good would it do for a man honestly let's think about it what good would it do for a man to go out here and build up a following so we can all fail together i read an interview one time in forbes magazine now sorry i like to read this kind of things interview of a man now he went on to start a business that actually was successful but it was that he was interviewed by forbes magazine and uh it was when his business he started is just raking in the millions of dollars and right away the man bought a jet and he built a big office building and all kinds of stuff and then it was about a year or so less than a year actually after forbes magazine lifted this guy up as one of the smartest business managers on the face of the earth that it turned out that he had bled his business dry expanding it with money he didn't have so almost like a ponzi scheme every dime he took in he leveraged that to build this business up and he created an image but it was hollow and when someone pulled you know what it what is that uh conga kanga changa when someone pulled that little block out boom it's all gone but the man later in years come along and says that was the hardest lesson i ever learned i thought i was smarter than everyone else let me interject that i thought i was more spiritual than everyone else well you know what i don't need to come out here and try to build something saints i'm not here to count numbers in fact some of you you know i kind of understand the comment i don't like it if people say paul's church it ain't paul's church paul didn't build this church paul didn't attract you here paul doesn't heal you paul doesn't come in the midnight hour and give relief to you amen doesn't give you the strength to press on paul didn't do none of that paul's right on board with you you look over somebody's got a shoulder on the wagon you're going to see paul there i don't want to be sitting in the seat up front saying push harder saints no paul's land down there in the mud i walk the same life that you do amen but my brother and sister we got to do it by the book and that man admitted later as he went ahead and built a successful business they said well how did you do this you have a good business he said i went back to what you would call the book of business and i built it on a sound foundation and i followed the rules i thought praise the lord that's how it works let's do what the lord wants amen hallelujah now i i don't think i gave this to brother alex in the notes there but ephesians 6 12 says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places now my brother and sister that i don't care where you stand in the uh you know in your beliefs uh you will not go against that we're not fighting we're not fighting against no man we're not fighting against no group we're not fighting against nothing but the spirits that come amen that would want to tear us down to make us just be status quo i don't want to be status quo you agree with me on that i don't want to be status quo i want to be as it is a supernatural christian i want to be filled with the holy ghost and when the prophet of god was talking so many words i didn't single them out to you but when the prophet of god was talking about that bride and that vision and it's going along there and all of that music and all of that swaying and swinging and all of that garbage and his heart what did he do he didn't rejoice you didn't see him rejoicing you didn't hear him saying well praise the lord i did the best i could what was happening his heart was breaking but just when it looked like it was all off they were here onward christian soldier amen hallelujah marching as to a picnic no marching as to war i'm ready to do war saints i don't want to go to war unfit and become a casualty i want to have a commander which is my lord jesus christ this says you know what soldier you need to crawl in the mud for a while to understand what it takes well hallelujah i don't like that are we going to pray for patience yeah some of you are like nope [Laughter] well good you don't have to pray for patience god knows what you need you'll get patience anyhow so you're going to crawl through the same mud hole i crawled through only i'm going to i don't want to sound boastful here i actually feel quite good this morning amen i don't want to sound boastful but i asked the lord to take me through the mud hole he just forced you to so you might as well just say lord just if i need to go through a mud hole lord take me through the mud hole lord i don't want to come you know resistant amen hallelujah amen every word amen now look look at this the true church the bride amen is so sold out to him his promised word till the very mind that's in christ is in you what a difference the other is pregnanted by the word of god and will bring forth the body the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride amen now look i'm going to be a little long this morning i'm forgive me i got just got to finish a little bit of stuff here but look we were preaching wednesday night talking about that it comes down to completion amen the partial versus the perfect the perfect the prophet of god said was complete which is a finished work right amen everything you need for the rapture is already in you so god has sent you out the door amen he doesn't need a recall we forgot to install faith no faith is there you just need to hear the word and embrace the word and say amen to the word and faith will come hallelujah now look at this here the finished oh brother paul you're just reading into too much okay well if that's the case let's just butcher the rest of the message and take out the words and ideas we don't think are anointed well if we're going to do that i'm going to become a mormon because they have way more programs and a softball team forgive me lord the finished body now look saints somebody will complain that i've just way overstepped the bounds that's fine go ahead and complain but look at this the prophet of god says here will bring forth the body the finished oh i wish he was here to make the emphasis the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride now i want to ask you is there any bride here hallelujah you know what the guarantee of the word is you'll be finished you're not going to go out here to face this world as some some immature come on the body of christ isn't finished yet thank you lord or else i would miss the rapture but he's working on me he's working on you we're coming there how many knows that a man and a woman is one now saints this is going to be real pointed i hope it won't offend anybody but i i've wrestled with this thing i woke up in the middle of the night with this thing and it bothers me i made a comment to you you need to know what your friends believe you need to know the people you're fellowshipping what they believe superficial fellowship is the betting ground for doubt amen amen and when somebody looked you in the face and say my husband and i are not one and never will be you don't know what kind of spirit you're fellowshipping with now i can assure you that never come up in your guys's conversation but i can assure you church it came up in mine ouch come on smile i'm trying to get you into the rapture come on smile look saint g oh you're picking on somebody no i'm not i'm picking on a spirit i'm picking on a spirit that would tell you that i'm never going to be one with my husband well if you can't be one with your husband you can't be one with christ your husband because you can't be one and not be the other you can't be oh i'm going in a rapture i got the holy ghost and rebellious to your husband now take that natural spiritual take it any way you please hallelujah amen how many knows that a man and a woman is one and christ is one body the word the ride will have to be the rest oh no no he didn't mean that saint it we just will be another body we'll be another body if christ will be one body will be another body that's not what the prophet of god taught he taught us that we'll be the rest amen of that body now somebody tells you if god's in me where's the act reconcile that please i don't mean to be so rough saints but i want you to catch these spirits they're subtle they put words on the table and they're willing to leave them there for years before they come to life see the bride will have what does the word have to be mean have an option i think that means it's complete the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two in the same car or separate living in the same house and roof make the body again no no no no no you know what my brother and sister i heard her brother put it like this once he said you may not know what he said but when god led me to my wife that's a minister he said when when god led me to my wife here she was this beautiful girl i think she said she was about 16 or 17 when they met got married when they were like 23 or 24 took him four or five years to convince her to marry somebody like him but he said what she hadn't caught was a revelation that out in the heavens her adams and my atoms had already crashed and you couldn't separate them it just took time for her to get that revelation that's the way i reason i remember that and think about it that's the way i always felt about jerry she's like i'm marrying that guy and i'm like yep um she's going to marry me just to me a matter of time you know i'll wear her down yeah or she catch a revelation oh my goodness love revelation don't you amen you see my brother and sister what happened is in that coming together the true church of christ the bride is sold out to him oh not there in a resistance not there in a pushing back not there in a dragging her feet she sold out hallelujah reminds me of another minister and i know him and his wife and uh one day you know he started preaching at a younger age i think 17 18 years old and he was about 23 or 24 and he's preaching at some meetings and i think there were youth-oriented meetings and and this little girl she wasn't the prettiest there in fact forgive me to even phrase it this way but she's a little on the short side a little on the side and she's sitting there in church amen and she's a listener this young man preached and she was like lord if you love me let me marry him and she said the lord loves me sounds strange isn't it [Music] but let me turn that when you oh hallelujah brother chris was preaching the other day and i'm going to ruin a future sermon here but my brother and sister when rebecca rode up on that camel she didn't go over there and say eliezer is it all right if i get off this camel and go see if isaac is the one what did eliezer do he painted a picture for days maybe weeks maybe months this is the man you love this is who he is this is his nature this is his character he is the perfect man rebecca can you repeat after me he's the perfect one and rebecca rides up and she gets that old camel to kneel and she jumps off that camel and she starts running and she went way out there and she come right back and turned around and run right back to that camel oh camel thank you for bringing me here i thank you for everything you've done for me camel you've been so good to me you carried me through deserts you carried me here no i wrote it down i probably ruined it for myself but my camel's behind me i left my camel behind it did a job it brought me to my bridegroom amen i'm not going to be worried about what happens to the church grace tabernacle they might make a warehouse out of it or maybe a dentist office i don't care hallelujah i see my isaac i see my bridegroom i'm gone michael's behind me sings i don't need that camel to take me anywhere else i've made it to my bridegroom hallelujah hallelujah see the others pregnanted by the word of god and will bring forth the body the finished body which is the bride and the two together i'm jumping right down here make one body again like adam was at the beginning man his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she used no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word now saints i'll tell you what i'll just throw this out now i love my sisters around here i hope this doesn't sound creepy to anybody here or on the internet i love you sisters so much it might shock you how much i love you amen in the proper context i die for you i believe i do much anything i could do for you but see you're somebody else's wife you're somebody else's daughter we have to have the proper context so when we'll look at this my brother and sister when we as wives now say i can take this position because i can step into it spiritually when we as wives will completely serve our husband well praise the lord he hasn't taken me on a date six months i ain't cooking his breakfast well praise the lord why don't you cook that breakfast you butter him up until he's like that jelly then you can just kind of dress him up and just kind of move him along to the car and he'll wake up and realize he's sitting in a nice restaurant somewhere looking at the love of his life natural life come on but anything less than complete selling out breeds resentment and resentment breeds what oh my praise the lord hallelujah i'm burning up all your guys's time now look at this look at jesus defense when he was dealing with the devil jesus defense was not words such as don't you know who i am reminds me of a little video a clip i seen it was taken by some other patron some really fancy restaurant this man drives up in a very high dollar car i don't remember now what it was but like you know very high dollar and him and his wife girlfriend whatever get out and he goes up to the the man in the restaurant and the man says uh seating for two and the man says sir do you have a reservation and he goes no i don't he says well sir we are we're filled up and he says don't you know who i am and this young man it's being filmed by somebody as you know it's all bobbly and whatever they're around people he says don't you know who i am this young man without breaking a face says yes sir i do you're a man without a reservation come on i'm making my reservations you're making your reservations we're not going to show up and say hey don't you know who i am i i'm the bride no i don't have a reservation i don't know who you are amen we're making our reservations hallelujah and you could see other people because it was there was actually a couple deals there and you could see these other couples all dressed up real nice and come on up there and they kind of did a little bird and blopped out the names you know but here's this other couple man walks his wife elderly older couple brother david's sister diane's age and they were walking up there and they said well our name is and they bleep that out you know so that and the man takes and gets everything and escorts him right in god have a name you gotta have a reservation you gotta have that my brother and sister amen because she's so sold out lord help us now sisters i'm not doing this in any behest of any brothers amen but i'm telling you take it spiritual we got to be completely sold out jesus didn't come and say don't you know who i am amen you see if that had been so my brother and sister then we would show up dealing with the devil and say don't you know who i am he'd say that's right you're trash study what the prophet of god said he said the devil knows the bible a lot better than you do better than you ever will and he believes it so we can deal with the devil don't you know who i am yeah you were a drug addict last week and you're here still sloppy you're lusting in the flesh yesterday you did this you did that you stole the gum yeah i know who you are yeah that's how it works that's not usable for a babe in christ now maybe somewhere down the road a mature christian would be able to say don't you know who i am the word said i'm a daughter of god i am the other half of jesus christ amen i have a word for that i have scripture for that i have a word of thus saith the lord of a prophet for that but you see that won't work for a babe a baby's got to be able to say well uh i i don't know uh uh why do you believe what you believe you're foolish you're you're fanatic now you well it's written i i got no defense i'm not smart enough i don't have the intellect but but it it's written you don't have to be some intellectual giant to take that some boastful person hey don't you know who i am no no it looks look devil it's written hallelujah and you see later as a mature christian we can come to the place that we can stand on our feet as it were and say no hallelujah i've experienced i've been behind the veil amen i have adele i've met him face to face i've been filled with the holy ghost amen the word has been made real it's being manifested in me satan you're mistaken you can howl all you want but i'm not who you say i am i am who he says i am so that's why god made the word the gold standard you know what because you see the word being the gold standard usable by every christian in every age you didn't have to come back and re-establish a gold standard again and again and again he said take it back to the word take it back to the word and people will say but we have the message of the hour the prophet of god didn't say take it back to my message he told us take it back to the word there's the gold standard right there take it back to the word take it back to the bible come on saints then it's usable at every stage no matter where we are in our christian walk oh hallelujah i've got so much stuff and some of this is so good sister emmy will you come hallelujah oh my you see the other three quarters of this sermon is quite long amen oh praise the lord you love the lord today saints now look i want to say this i'm not feeling condemned i'm not feeling bad but i want to tell you i'm not trying to condemn or push down on any individual but i'll tell you what i don't like i don't like the spirits that come in our pasture and try to corner the saints and tell them that they are meat for the devil no i won't stand still i'll tell you what i'll do just like that man said once a long time ago you know about getting the holy ghost and i'll tell you what i'll do i'll chase that devil around the pasture and when i catch him if i ain't got no teeth i might be old i'll gum him to death [Music] because we're not going to put up with that no spirit's going to come in just have free reign because we don't want to offend nobody saints the word the word will rightly divide it and you can say well that's offensive but my brother and sister if it's man then it can be offensive amen if it's god it's a two-edged sword and you better listen to it hallelujah sheep let's pray for the security lift one another you see a hole in the fence don't pass it by and say that's the ministry's job you stop you fix that hole in that fence you start praying for that need you start praying for god to do something amen because we're not going to get there and say my where all the sheep go and look back and all you see is glistening bones in the sunlight and then say oh that's too bad no sir you want the spirit of unity unite around this word here's where the life is here's where the security is here's where the strength is oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my oh my brother's listening a song or two brother jason would you come i just want to sing a song just these you know sometimes saints i don't have no deal just like maybe when i'm studying a song comes to me and i find myself humming it or singing my tractor version of the words and and you know i oftentimes just put those down and be something i feel led to to just sing i believe saints no matter what our condition is today the fountain's still open amen and it's not just any old fountain it's a fountain in the house of david amen and that fountain oh praise the lord it's so deep that you can jump in and it will completely cover your life and it's so shallow our babies can climb in and walk through it and receive the blessings of it oh isn't that incredible but you've got to get in the fountain hallelujah reminds me we were kids long time ago we were out on the lake a friend of ours had a motorboat we're out on the lake water skiing and i'm too blind i never i never have enjoyed water skiing because you see i couldn't even see the back of the boat it's like where'd the boat go i have a rope in my hand but oh there it is this young man said hey hey guys guys is it possible to water ski without getting in the water [Music] it's probably possible and then lo and behold time goes on they invent things like youtube and you see the guy on the dock and the boat does its little thing and you know all the rest of them and the boat goes straight away these guys get their arms ripped off right but something about that when the boat curves away so that the rope is pulling through the water [Music] are you with me it doesn't jerk their arms off but they just slide right off of the dock and they're on their ski and they're going then you can watch that same man ride his water ski in right down the side of the dock and right when it goes to settle he sits down on the dock and everybody's like that's incredible but that's not us we can't have a spiritual relationship without getting wet amen that's that's for somebody that's for that's for the mega church man [Music] the rest of us gonna get in the water and you know what we might as well just [Music] lay down let it cover us frolick in it amen that reminds me do you know right there on the ohio river where brother branham was baptized and when the spirit of the lord come down did you know that just a little farther out in the river right there it's a very area that brother brown was baptizing him and he's baptizing these folks and and it's all good the angel of the lord comes down god speaks to him lovely time a lot of people like to be baptized there there's something special now when i talked earlier about that i'm not saying my brother and sister is not something special about these places there's something special angel of the lord come down god almighty himself come down you can't tell me that's not sacred ground but i had a brother cher he said you know we have these we have these young people in these meetings one of them said you know i want to get i want to get baptized there well it kind of caught on others said well if you're going to go get baptized there i'll i'll just go get baptized there and pretty soon they have quite a few well the ohio river was a little bit low that year and uh so they're out there he baptizes the first young lady another one comes they baptize them here comes this young man it's about six foot tall and the brother's like well lucy kind of judged his height he takes a couple steps like this he's standing there he baptizing them but you know there's like rock or whatever else just drops down about 10 feet right there and after they all made it to shore they're splashing and sputtering and got up there he said you know what brother i think i baptized you more thoroughly than i baptized the rest of them because we made it all the way to the bottom and we came back up and then we got it all over us my brother and sister let's not settle for just oh lord let your spirit just get on me just enough no settle saints for just enough lord just just make me feel like a believer make me a christian come on saints let's go let's go all the way let's go in let's get to the bottom of this let's let god surround us get him in your eyes your ears your nose your mouth and your heart amen i'm not i'm not wanting you to drown but maybe it might help if you need to to get in your lungs hallelujah just get completely in let's forget about this superficial relationship and superficial acting like we're in the message we are in christ amen we're not going to become the baptist we're not going to become the methodist we're not going to become some new movement this movement is from time and eternity it's jesus christ dive in dive in hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] there's a fountain yeah oh hallelujah let's just worship him saints if you want to stand stand if you want to sit sit just worship the lord hallelujah hallelujah [Music] and there are streams of grace [Applause] [Music] or i will take you from the nation bring you to your own land and i'll be sanctified in [Music] and place my spirit within i'll sprinkle clean water on you and save me from your hair [Music] uh [Music] [Applause] and there are streams of
