[10:07] all
[10:09] our sins and griefs to bear.
[10:17] What
[10:19] a privilege
[10:21] to carry
[10:27] everything
[10:29] to God in prayer.
[10:36] Oh,
[10:38] what peace we often forfeit.
[10:46] Oh,

[11:35] should never be discouraged.
[11:43] Take
[11:44] it to the Lord in prayer.
[11:51] Oh, can
[11:54] we find a friend so faithful?
[11:58] [Music]
[12:02] Who
[12:03] will all our sorrows share?
[12:11] Jesus
[12:13] knows our every weakness.

[13:55] He paid a debt. He did not owe. I owed a
[14:02] debt I could not pay. I needed someone
[14:10] to wash my sins away.
[14:16] And now I sing a brand new song. Amazing
[14:23] grace all day long. Christ Jesus paid a
[14:29] debt that I could never pay.
[14:35] He paid a debt at Calvary.

[15:02] grace.

[15:09] that I could never pay.
[15:14] One day he's coming back to me to live
[15:20] with him eternally.
[15:24] Won't it be glory
[15:28] to see him on that day?
[15:34] I then will sing a brand new song.

[22:15] pray for these needs. Um Sister Jerry
[22:18] writes, "Please remember sister, is it
[22:20] Heather Karpa?" Sister Heather Karpa in
[22:23] prayer for healing and for her unsaved
[22:26] loved ones who are with her. So for our
[22:29] salvation, for Lord's perfect will
[22:33] and uh also those traveling
[22:36] uh let's remember the pashant sister
[22:38] Aona and their baby Isaac and uh those
[22:41] who are joining on the stream. Let's

[22:45] April, sister Alice and uh also sister
[22:48] Sue.
[22:50] Amen. And uh sister Rachel and I will be
[22:53] heading out and uh we'll be traveling
[22:55] for a couple weeks. So just praying for
[22:57] traveling mercies
[22:59] for David.
[23:01] [Music]
[23:04] Thank you for this.
[23:07] Let's bow our heads before him.
[23:10] Our heavenly father,
[23:13] there may be few in what the world would
[23:15] say few in number here tonight, but
[23:18] Lord, where two or three are gathered
[23:20] together in my name,
[23:22] there am I in the midst.
[23:26] Lord, we can do nothing in our own
[23:28] selves if we would just give it to you
[23:30] by prayer and let you take it.
[23:35] We are more than victors.
[23:38] We don't take these things, Lord. We
[23:40] take it upon ourselves and we in our own
[23:43] selves can do nothing.
[23:45] But Lord, help us. Give us grace
[23:50] to remember we didn't bring ourselves
[23:53] into this earth. It's certain we can do
[23:55] nothing but we have an absolute and
[23:56] that's your word. You're waiting us upon
[24:00] us to bring it to you and put the word
[24:04] in action.
[24:06] Lord, we just are not here by chance
[24:08] tonight. We are here to receive from
[24:10] you.
[24:12] We are here to
[24:15] go forward from here and apply the word
[24:19] as you told us to.
[24:22] Lord, forgive us where we've aired and
[24:25] failed.
[24:28] Now, Lord, we bring these needs before
[24:30] you, those traveling, our brother Alex,
[24:34] his wife traveling for a couple weeks,
[24:38] Sergey and their family.
[24:41] Lord, others on the road.
[24:44] We don't even know what the next breath
[24:46] takes, but we have committed the breath
[24:49] to you, the deeds to you, the actions to
[24:52] you. You're the answer.
[24:56] You have every
[24:58] thing we have need of already provided.
[25:01] Let us just take a hold of it. And Lord
[25:05] Jesus, you've given us a perfect word.
[25:08] And we also are asking you also Lord to
[25:11] take care of this sister Heather healing
[25:14] and needs of the families.
[25:16] [Music]
[25:18] Oh mighty eternal God, open your word to
[25:21] our hearts.
[25:24] Make it known to us by revelation we
[25:26] pray. We commit these things to you now
[25:29] and for thy service and thy purpose. May
[25:33] we leave here as you
[25:36] are in our midst
[25:38] to speak to us to commune with us.
[25:43] Help us Lord. We need thee every moment.
[25:48] In thy name we ask these things the Lord
[25:50] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[25:56] And you may be seated.
[25:58] [Music]
[26:01] Let's sing number 590.
[26:08] [Music]

[30:25] than life to me.
[30:33] Whom
[30:35] have I on earth beside
[30:41] thee?
[30:43] whom
[30:46] heaven.
[30:52] Oh Savior,

[32:09] Amen. As brother Paul comes number 680.
[32:24] All to Jesus

[32:33] all
[32:35] to him I freely
[32:41] give.
[32:44] I
[32:45] will ever
[32:48] love
[32:50] and trust him in
[32:55] his presence
[32:58] daily
[33:01] live.
[33:03] I
[33:05] surrender
[33:08] all.
[33:13] Yes, I
[33:15] surrender
[33:18] all.
[33:20] [Music]
[33:23] All
[33:25] to thee, my blessed
[33:30] Savior,
[33:33] I
[33:35] surrender
[33:38] all.
[33:43] All
[33:44] to Jesus

[34:36] all.
[34:40] All
[34:42] to thee, my blessed
[34:47] Savior.
[34:50] I

[34:55] all
[34:59] and all

[35:20] me feel the Holy
[35:26] Spirit
[35:28] truly
[35:30] know that thou art mine.
[35:37] I
[35:39] surrender
[35:42] all.
[35:47] I
[35:49] surrender
[35:52] all.
[35:57] All
[35:58] to thee, my blessed
[36:04] Savior.
[36:06] I

[36:11] all.
[36:15] Go all
[36:17] to Jesus.
[36:20] I

[37:46] all
[37:48] [Music]
[37:52] to thee my blessed
[37:58] savior.
[38:02] Bless you, brother Alex. Appreciate you.
[38:05] Okay.
[38:09] Amen. And it's good to be here tonight.
[38:12] Amen. As
[38:14] we just come, I just
[38:19] am very thankful
[38:21] the Lord's so good to us and everything
[38:25] that we have. We
[38:29] had so many good reports from family
[38:31] camp. I just uh many many of the uh
[38:36] brothers and sisters that come to visit
[38:39] uh just reported that they were so
[38:42] blessed and Lord willing they would like
[38:44] to return and um we're very blessed to
[38:48] have brother Barry and Sister Becky with
[38:50] us and and um I I took it as not really
[38:54] a compliment to us as individuals or
[38:58] church but brother Barry said you know
[39:01] this was a blessed time and if I was
[39:03] you, I wouldn't change a thing. And uh
[39:06] so I I took that as quite a compliment
[39:09] as it were and uh happy to have had that
[39:13] lovely time to fellowship together with
[39:16] all of all of the brothers and sisters
[39:19] that come from around the country and
[39:21] Canada. Amen. So let's just stand and go
[39:25] right into our deal. I'd like to speak.
[39:27] Thank you, brother Alex, sister.
[39:30] Amen.
[39:32] uh we just uh go right into Psalms 118
[39:37] verses 1-19
[39:40] and um uh kind of a lengthy scripture
[39:44] reading but we just um take our thought
[39:48] from this speaking once again uh uh part
[39:51] three on God's achievement and we look
[39:54] through the ages and see all that the
[39:56] Lord has achieved. Amen. all that he has
[39:58] done. And uh just reading in my Bible
[40:02] there uh and uh you know how the Lord
[40:06] just said, you know what, Israel, you're
[40:09] going to dwell in another land. You're
[40:12] going to be there. He lays out all the
[40:14] circumstances.
[40:15] And uh it just reminded me if we can
[40:18] just simply look at the promise that he
[40:21] gave us. Amen. That should have been
[40:24] enough. When we come out of the trial,
[40:26] when we come out of that deal, if we
[40:28] just look to the promise and hold to the
[40:30] promise, then all of the circumstances
[40:34] can just disappear because the promise
[40:36] has to be fulfilled. God's going to
[40:39] fulfill his promise in our life. And
[40:42] Satan, he's doing his very best. Just
[40:44] reading today, the prophet of God said,
[40:46] "Satan's there to disrupt everything he
[40:49] can disrupt until he can't disrupt it
[40:52] any longer." Amen. And when he's bound
[40:54] by the word, Amen. which is you and I
[40:58] today. Amen. When he's bound by the
[41:00] word, then he quits disrupting. And and
[41:03] I I just thought it just really touched
[41:05] me, you know, cuz it seems like every
[41:07] time like, you know, we have a great
[41:09] camp uh have great services, you know,
[41:12] the devil, he just wants to rush in and
[41:14] quench the fire. But praise God, there's
[41:17] a little lick of fire that remains and
[41:19] it's building greater and greater. Amen.
[41:23] Psalms 118 1-19. Oh, give thanks unto
[41:26] the Lord for he is good. Can we say
[41:29] amen? Amen. because his mercy endureth
[41:32] forever. Let Israel now say that his
[41:36] mercy endureth forever. Let all the
[41:38] saints of grace tabernacle say his mercy
[41:42] endureth forever. Let the house of Aaron
[41:45] now say that his mercy endureth forever.
[41:48] Let them now that fear the Lord say that
[41:52] his mercy endureth forever. I called
[41:55] upon the Lord in distress. The Lord
[41:57] answered me and set me in a large place.
[42:01] The Lord is on my side. I will not fear.
[42:05] What can man do unto me? Let's read
[42:07] verse six together. The Lord is on my
[42:11] side. I will not fear. What can man do
[42:16] unto me? The Lord taketh my part with
[42:19] them that help me. Therefore shall I see
[42:22] my desire upon them that hate me. It is
[42:25] better to trust in the Lord than to put
[42:27] confidence in man. Can we say amen? It
[42:30] is better to trust in the Lord than to
[42:32] put confidence in princes. All nation
[42:35] compass me about, but in the name of the
[42:38] Lord will I destroy them. They compass
[42:40] me about, yay, they compass me about,
[42:43] but in the name of the Lord I will
[42:45] destroy them. They compass me about like
[42:48] bees. They are quenched as the fire of
[42:51] thorns. For in the name of the Lord, I
[42:54] will destroy them. Amen. Now, we don't
[42:57] speak these words to individuals, right?
[42:59] We're not looking to do, but we're
[43:01] speaking about the kingdoms. Amen. That
[43:04] Satan turns everything that he turns
[43:08] against the bride of Christ will be
[43:10] destroyed. Amen. The word will overcome
[43:13] every bit of it. Even though right now
[43:15] it seems like a very hard, bitter trial.
[43:18] Amen. God promised I'll destroy it.
[43:21] Amen. Hallelujah.
[43:25] Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might
[43:28] fall, but the Lord help me. The Lord is
[43:31] my strength and song and has become my
[43:34] salvation. The voice of rejoicing and
[43:37] salvation is in the tabernacles of the
[43:40] righteous. That means he's here tonight.
[43:42] Saints, the right hand of the Lord doth
[43:45] valiantly. The right hand of the Lord is
[43:47] exalted. The right hand of the Lord doth
[43:50] violently. I shall not die but live and
[43:54] declare the works of the Lord. The Lord
[43:56] hath chasen me sore. Can somebody say
[43:59] amen on that? Amen. But he hath not
[44:02] given me over unto death. Open to me the
[44:06] gates of righteousness and I will go
[44:09] unto them and I will praise the Lord.
[44:12] Amen. And I believe today, tonight, we
[44:15] can say that the gates of righteousness
[44:17] have been opened to us. Amen. He has not
[44:21] brought us here. He has not brought us
[44:23] to die. Amen. To pass away. Not given us
[44:26] over into death. And I do believe in the
[44:29] study of the word that this is speaking
[44:31] to the believer would be the second
[44:33] death. Amen. That's separation from God.
[44:36] He has not given us over into
[44:38] separation. He has corrected us. Amen.
[44:41] Let me reiterate this. He has corrected
[44:43] us and it has been uh chasened us till
[44:46] we you might say are sore. It might be
[44:49] just in our spirit but the correction is
[44:52] so strong is so direct but he has not
[44:55] given us over to eternal separation. Can
[44:59] we say thank you Lord tonight. Heavenly
[45:01] father bless the word. Bless this time
[45:04] together. Lord, encourage us for the
[45:06] gate to righteousness has been opened
[45:08] and we are walking through it into your
[45:11] presence. Father, we're walking through
[45:13] it, guided by your Holy Spirit,
[45:15] strengthened by your word. Lord, we
[45:17] thank you for that. Lord, bless each and
[45:20] every one those who are not here
[45:21] traveling, whatever might be in their
[45:24] lives. Lord, we ask you to bless them.
[45:26] Father, now guide us tonight. We ask in
[45:29] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may
[45:32] be seated.
[45:34] I want to
[45:36] make emphasis again on those verses 17,
[45:39] 18, and 19. I shall not die, but live
[45:44] and declare the works of the Lord. It's
[45:46] not just about us living, my brother and
[45:48] sister, but we're actually called what
[45:50] God called us to do, not just to come
[45:52] and live out a life and and try to, you
[45:55] know, hopefully be victorious and live a
[45:57] good life, but we are called to declare
[46:00] the works of the Lord. Amen. That's why
[46:02] we are living epistles read of all men.
[46:06] And you know, sometimes I just have to
[46:08] be straightforward with you. Sometimes I
[46:10] don't want certain chapters or pages of
[46:13] my life to be read by someone else. But
[46:15] you know, the Lord corrects us and he
[46:18] comes and he brings us to that place
[46:20] that once again, as though we were a
[46:22] scribe, we are writing a living epistle
[46:26] and it will be read of all men. And I've
[46:28] shared with you before uh the little
[46:30] circumstances of of everyday life when
[46:33] you don't react right and and the Lord
[46:36] leads you to apologize to people and
[46:39] they are shocked that you are
[46:40] apologizing because to them that seemed
[46:43] like normal behavior. That's just what
[46:46] people do under the pressure and the
[46:48] stress. But you see because the Lord is
[46:51] correcting us by his holy spirit. And
[46:53] the prophet of God shows us, brother
[46:55] Brandham shows us very clearly that when
[46:57] the Holy Spirit moves upon us, don't
[46:59] push that away. Don't reject that. But
[47:02] if he moves upon us to be humbled, to uh
[47:05] correct it, to apologize, that we just
[47:07] we just follow the leadership of the
[47:10] Holy Spirit because the our flesh
[47:12] sometimes is just like, well, it's just
[47:15] the worst enemy I have. Amen. We'd like
[47:18] to blame the devil as being our worst
[47:20] enemy, but my brother and sister, my
[47:22] flesh is my worst enemy. And so, you
[47:25] know, but uh uh verse 17, I shall not
[47:28] die. Amen. I'll not have this. I believe
[47:31] as we look at this in a spiritual
[47:33] context, I will not be separated from
[47:36] the Lord. Amen. But I'm going to live
[47:39] and declare his works. And verse 18, the
[47:42] Lord hath chasened me sore. I wouldn't
[47:45] want to see a raise of hands today, but
[47:47] I believe each and every one of us would
[47:49] have to say there's been that time in
[47:51] our life or times. It would be plural,
[47:54] I'm sure,
[47:56] that God has corrected us and he's come,
[47:59] you might say, forcefully. He's put it
[48:01] right in our face that we have to humble
[48:04] our heart and bow our heads and say,
[48:06] "Lord, I'm sorry." Amen. The correction
[48:09] is there. But you know, every son or
[48:11] daughter of God that is not corrected,
[48:15] well, my brother and sister,
[48:18] the season comes that God then brings
[48:21] us. And it's just that much more
[48:23] difficult when we try to push those
[48:25] things down the road in front of us.
[48:27] It's just that much more difficult. And
[48:29] this why the prophet of God said, "When
[48:31] the Holy Spirit moves upon us, just let
[48:33] us repent quickly. Let us be, you know,
[48:36] apologize or whatever very quickly."
[48:39] Amen. That we can then just clear that
[48:42] and that the Lord hath chasened me sore,
[48:44] but he's not given me over to separation
[48:47] from him. Amen. He didn't come, you
[48:51] know, we see this through the years and
[48:53] I was talking with a brother just
[48:55] recently, not at camp, but another
[48:57] conversation. And how it is through the
[49:00] years, you know, something gets brought
[49:01] up. Oh, brother so and so used to be my
[49:03] friend. And you know, curiosity a very
[49:07] powerful thing. And it's like, well, why
[49:08] is he no longer your friend? Well, we
[49:11] disagreed over doctrine. And so, you see
[49:14] how Satan would use something like that.
[49:16] Now, my brother and sister, the the
[49:18] doctrine difference might be a a very
[49:21] strong difference, but you see, we don't
[49:23] have to end a friendship because we see
[49:26] the picture differently. And even, you
[49:30] know, in marriage, we don't have to
[49:32] always get everyone in the family to see
[49:35] it like we see it. But God would bring,
[49:38] he promised to bring us to all truth. So
[49:41] even in that realm, he will come and
[49:43] reconcile things and put them in the
[49:46] right place. And I trust you can say
[49:48] amen to that, too. But we as humans like
[49:51] to be right. And God will correct us
[49:54] when we're thoughts are right in our own
[49:57] eyes. That's what the word says, right
[49:59] in our own eyes. We want to be right in
[50:02] his eyes. Amen. We want our spirit to
[50:05] align with his spirit. We want our
[50:08] doctrine to align with his doctrine.
[50:10] Amen. And as I've said from this pulpit
[50:13] many times to say again, they say,
[50:15] "Well, I'd rather have the right spirit
[50:17] and the wrong doctrine than to have the
[50:20] right doctrine and the wrong spirit."
[50:22] But the bride of Jesus Christ will have
[50:25] the right spirit and she will have the
[50:28] right doctrine. Amen. We don't have to
[50:30] decide one or the other. But God is
[50:33] leading us into all truth. Amen. So,
[50:37] it's wonderful, isn't it? Even though
[50:39] correction can be painful, I'm so glad
[50:42] tonight the Lord has not given up on us.
[50:46] My brothers and sisters, if we were of
[50:49] the human behavior,
[50:51] then we would have been forsaken long
[50:54] ago. He would have just simply said,
[50:57] "Enough is enough." Amen. But his mercy
[51:01] endureth forever. Amen. When you read
[51:05] that scripture, it just makes my heart
[51:08] melt. I I literally get tears in my eyes
[51:11] to realize that his mercy endureth
[51:15] forever.
[51:16] Amen. Not for a season till I'm tired of
[51:19] dealing with you, but his mercy is there
[51:23] as a constant supply to us, covering us
[51:27] by his blood. Amen.
[51:30] Verse 19.
[51:33] Open to me the gates of righteousness
[51:37] and I will go into them and I will
[51:38] praise the Lord. Now my brother and
[51:41] sister, we can study. I've been looking
[51:42] at these things about uh uh religion and
[51:46] what a religious is. It's a covering and
[51:49] and you know often times we we just see
[51:53] how that really religion is a covering.
[51:56] you know that that we can have our own
[51:59] failures of humanity in this flesh and
[52:03] as long as we apply a liberal dose of
[52:06] religion, it seems as though that is
[52:08] covered. But God said that whatever is
[52:10] done in secret will be made known
[52:13] openly. And and we see how that God
[52:16] comes and says, "I don't want you to put
[52:18] on a cloak. I don't want you just to put
[52:21] on a robe of of this to cover up. You
[52:25] know, uh I was reading a little bit of
[52:27] English history and uh this has been
[52:30] back a little bit cuz I was curious
[52:32] where did the tie come from? And and you
[52:35] know in some culture the tie was
[52:39] actually a large uh h a tablecloth
[52:44] hanky uh napkin. That's the word that
[52:48] was just uh taken and and hung by a
[52:51] string around the neck. And then people
[52:54] started as humans are to have more
[52:56] flowery and fancy or nicer and some
[52:59] wanted to be separated from the common
[53:02] people. And so they started to have very
[53:04] expensive ones. And and then they
[53:06] started to tailor them. And other
[53:09] sources say it was just merely a a used
[53:12] to be a fluffy flowery thing around the
[53:15] neck and and for decoration and it just
[53:18] morphed into it. But regardless of what
[53:21] it is, it exists today. But my brother
[53:23] and sister, they also used it to cover
[53:26] up food stains.
[53:28] Amen. It was also there to hide. And
[53:32] some cultures used the backside. Amen.
[53:36] To wipe their mouth. And then they
[53:38] covered it and it still looked good
[53:41] except for the stain was then
[53:43] transferred to their shirt or blouse.
[53:46] And you see my brother and sister in
[53:49] that realm how that humanity is
[53:51] constantly trying to hide the stain that
[53:55] is on their life. We we don't want the
[53:57] stain to be seen by our brothers and
[53:59] sisters. We don't want the stain to be
[54:01] seen by those around us. But God said,
[54:04] "You know what? Just let me wash you
[54:06] with the water of the word. Just let my
[54:08] blood come over you. And every stain
[54:11] that there is on your life will then be
[54:14] just washed whiter than snow. You you
[54:16] don't have to try to cover the stain.
[54:19] You can have the stain removed. Amen.
[54:22] And I just think about the beauty of
[54:25] that. And the Lord, look at this now. I
[54:27] hope you don't mind me taking and
[54:29] morphing as it is the scripture here
[54:31] just a little bit. Open to me the gates
[54:33] of righteousness. And that's what the
[54:35] Lord has done to you and I tonight when
[54:38] he brought this revealed word of the
[54:40] hour to you and I. You could hear as you
[54:43] start to listen to the word and it
[54:45] starts to change your life. You can hear
[54:48] the gates creaking as the gates of
[54:50] righteousness have opened to us that
[54:53] we're no longer just covering our sin
[54:56] and our problems. But God is revealing
[54:58] and bringing them open. And here it is.
[55:01] Sometimes he chasens us sore. But that
[55:04] is the opening of righteousness to us to
[55:07] deal with the things that we need to
[55:09] deal with. And our human ideas, our
[55:12] human approach is, "Oh, I I don't want
[55:15] my flaws to be revealed." But let's face
[55:17] it, as sons and daughters of God, I
[55:20] would say, "Lord, let me have it
[55:21] revealed right here and not before your
[55:24] throne. And I would rather, as it is,
[55:27] face some kind of shame on the earth
[55:30] today, right here, that people around me
[55:32] might say they're going through a trial.
[55:34] They're going through a struggle.
[55:36] They're dealing with things. I say,
[55:38] "Praise the Lord. He's dealing with us.
[55:40] He's correcting us. And it might be
[55:42] sore. It might be painful, but I would
[55:45] rather have the pain here than there. I
[55:48] would rather hear the words, "Well done,
[55:50] my good and faithful servant." because
[55:52] at that point we'll never remember the
[55:55] pain. Amen. Of correction. But God is
[55:59] such an awesome God. And and he take
[56:01] these words open to me. Now David, a man
[56:07] after God's own heart, would have a list
[56:10] of flaws.
[56:12] You might say proverbial the old phrase
[56:14] a mile long.
[56:16] But because of his approach to God just
[56:21] to this here even he's saying open to me
[56:23] the gates of righteousness and I'll
[56:25] think about going through. No, open the
[56:28] gates and I will. Amen. Can we say it
[56:31] together? I will. Amen. It's not that he
[56:35] opens the gates and we'll have to ponder
[56:37] how will it affect my life. But there's
[56:40] something within us as the gates of
[56:42] righteousness. And do you believe today
[56:44] that the gates have been opened to us?
[56:46] Amen. God has opened the gates and we
[56:49] are going through. I say thank you Lord.
[56:51] Amen. That you are so gracious to us and
[56:55] I will praise the Lord. You know we talk
[56:58] about I'll praise him in the good times
[57:00] and I'll praise him in the hard times.
[57:03] But I tell you my brother and sister, it
[57:04] takes a real revelation from God to
[57:07] praise him in the hard times. It takes
[57:10] something beyond just human ability. We
[57:13] can mouth the words. We can sing the
[57:15] songs, but I'm talking about from the
[57:17] heart. Then God would come and in the
[57:19] most difficult moments of our lives, we
[57:22] could stop and say, "The gates's been
[57:24] opened. I'm walking through it and I
[57:27] will praise my God." Amen. In these
[57:30] times right here, I'm going to give
[57:32] thanks to him. Amen. I'm going to give
[57:34] praise to him. And even when I don't
[57:37] feel like it, it don't look like it. It
[57:39] doesn't feel like it, my brother and
[57:41] sister, to the point that we would
[57:43] wonder, "What am I doing?" We stop.
[57:46] Let's think about what God is doing.
[57:48] He's open these gates to us. Not
[57:51] everyone the gates are being opened, my
[57:53] brother and sister. Not everyone is
[57:55] getting this uh you might say, grand
[57:57] opportunity
[58:00] to walk through the gates of
[58:01] righteousness. This is not the gates of
[58:03] the church. This is not the gates of
[58:04] wealth. This not the gates of prosperity
[58:06] gospel. This is not the name it, claim
[58:08] it gate, my brother and sister. This is
[58:11] the gate of righteousness. And those
[58:13] that are righteous, there will be few,
[58:15] the scripture tells us, that will walk
[58:17] through that gate. And I think tonight
[58:19] we ought to give a little praise to the
[58:21] Lord that he's invited us to be there to
[58:24] walk through that gate of righteousness
[58:26] that the word is correcting us, keeping
[58:29] us on. Now think about these things in
[58:31] our life. It's a very narrow way. Amen.
[58:36] And the scripture says it's not going to
[58:38] be crowded.
[58:43] No matter how painful this is,
[58:47] it will be worth That's right. being on
[58:51] that way. Amen.
[58:53] And walking through that gate. Amen.
[58:57] Now, I was just listening to brother
[59:00] Brandham on the wings of a snow white
[59:01] dove and he's talking about how it
[59:05] begins with the water.
[59:07] Amen. And we understand that brother
[59:09] Brandham says there's kind of a silence
[59:11] of pause on the tape. So even the
[59:13] congregations that brother Brandham was
[59:14] preaching to sometimes would have to
[59:16] stop and digest what he was really
[59:18] saying. And then brother Brandham
[59:20] because there's a kind of a silence of
[59:21] pause there, he says, "I thought you
[59:23] would get that."
[59:25] And then he goes on to talk about how it
[59:28] starts. And it starts in the water, my
[59:30] brother and sister. John was in the
[59:33] water with the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[59:35] And there, you might say, was the start.
[59:37] Yes, sir. Amen. And with you and I, it's
[59:40] here. Water baptism. We understand that
[59:43] there's the start.
[59:45] Now, this is not brother Brandham's
[59:47] words, but I'll put it this way. Just
[59:48] jumping in the word water and having
[59:50] words spoke over you is not what it's
[59:53] about.
[59:54] Amen. We have to have the correct
[59:56] baptism, the correct start. And I like
[59:59] the phrase, you know, uh what all starts
[1:00:02] well ends well. And and uh I like that
[1:00:06] because often times in my flesh, I I
[1:00:09] tend to start things and I look back and
[1:00:12] realize I didn't start it as well as I
[1:00:15] thought I did.
[1:00:17] You know, like when you're done, say,
[1:00:19] remodeling a house
[1:00:23] and you wished
[1:00:25] this was this and this was that and
[1:00:28] you'd left this out or you had added
[1:00:30] this. And so at that point, you look
[1:00:33] back and realize
[1:00:36] didn't really start as well as I thought
[1:00:38] I would did. If I could change this,
[1:00:42] this doorway would be a little bigger.
[1:00:45] this doorway be in a little different
[1:00:47] spot or you understand what I'm saying?
[1:00:51] And that isn't that really kind of the
[1:00:52] story of our life. We think we are
[1:00:54] starting off okay, but there's only one
[1:00:58] solution to these things and that is to
[1:01:01] walk through the gates of his
[1:01:04] righteousness.
[1:01:06] Amen. Now, brother Brown says here in
[1:01:08] the seventh church age, Philadelphiaian
[1:01:10] church age, uh he says right here, uh
[1:01:15] Israel used to take the red heer and
[1:01:18] sacrifice her upon the altar for the
[1:01:20] remission of sins. For a year, the sins
[1:01:23] of the guilty one was covered. Now, I
[1:01:27] would like to just, if you don't mind,
[1:01:28] preach through this just a little bit.
[1:01:30] Imagine now I forgot my phone. I was
[1:01:33] going to use it for an example because
[1:01:35] those of you who are techsavvy, which
[1:01:38] probably this isn't as complicated as I
[1:01:40] can, but I fail all the time to get it
[1:01:42] to work. And that is you could move out,
[1:01:44] you know, and set or mark a a date or
[1:01:47] put something on the calendar. Okay,
[1:01:50] imagine now that brother Paul's got got
[1:01:52] his calendar here. I've just brought my
[1:01:56] sacrifice
[1:02:01] and my sins are covered.
[1:02:04] And then as I step out, I pull out my
[1:02:06] phone
[1:02:08] and I mark 364
[1:02:10] days.
[1:02:15] My sins are covered for 364 days. All is
[1:02:18] well. I'm going to live this year.
[1:02:23] On the 364th day, I need to go get a
[1:02:27] sacrifice and I need to go back and
[1:02:29] visit the priest.
[1:02:33] You see, the prophet of God lays this
[1:02:35] out that that it's there. Uh it couldn't
[1:02:39] take away
[1:02:41] the desire. See, it it just didn't take
[1:02:44] it away. And see, the thing is now I
[1:02:47] please pardon me. I I think it just
[1:02:49] needs to be said straight. We have to be
[1:02:51] careful that we are not falling into the
[1:02:54] trap of just feeling like it's covered,
[1:02:58] but the desires are still there and we
[1:03:00] still have the human nature that's
[1:03:02] coming forward and all that we are. And
[1:03:04] I'm going to let you judge yourself on
[1:03:06] that. Amen. I'm not going to preach to
[1:03:08] you about what your shortcomings are and
[1:03:11] your failures are and what an attitude
[1:03:13] and atmosphere and all those things. I'm
[1:03:15] not going to preach to you on that. You
[1:03:17] preach to yourself. Is that a deal?
[1:03:18] Amen. And so in that, look at this. See,
[1:03:21] it doesn't take away that because it was
[1:03:24] not a perfect offering. And so it was a
[1:03:28] shadow until the real came along. And I
[1:03:31] need to ask you, did the real come?
[1:03:33] Amen. We're not sitting here today
[1:03:35] looking backwards. Amen. The real is
[1:03:38] right here tonight in our midst. Amen.
[1:03:41] In fact, the word says he's in us. The
[1:03:43] real one is right here. And it's right
[1:03:45] here in us. And so the we got to
[1:03:48] remember that that uh this anointing
[1:03:53] is still with us.
[1:03:56] We're just trying to cover.
[1:04:01] Pretty straightforward, isn't it? But we
[1:04:04] don't want to get caught up now. We'll
[1:04:05] go on here. It was a shadow until the
[1:04:08] real came. So each year the man would
[1:04:09] sacrifice and each year come back
[1:04:11] because he still had the same desire to
[1:04:13] sin. Now remember my brother and sister,
[1:04:15] I want to make this emphasis that sin is
[1:04:18] not always going out and doing something
[1:04:20] evil. Sin is unbelief.
[1:04:24] And so sometimes it could come in our
[1:04:26] life that simply we're holding back from
[1:04:29] taking 100% possession of a promise of
[1:04:34] the word for our life. Amen. We can come
[1:04:37] and say, "You know what? I know what the
[1:04:39] atmosphere I know what the experience of
[1:04:41] the Holy Spirit is." But Satan's going
[1:04:44] to come in and anoint us to fall short
[1:04:46] of letting the Holy Spirit have complete
[1:04:49] leadership. Do you know what I'm talking
[1:04:50] about? Amen. That's the human reaction
[1:04:53] and action coming forth and welling up.
[1:04:56] Amen. And that's why my brother and
[1:04:58] sister prophet of God basically shows us
[1:05:02] our worst enemy is us. Amen. And I say
[1:05:05] the devil's outside the church crying
[1:05:07] because he's getting blamed for things
[1:05:09] that we ourselves are in control of.
[1:05:17] Lord, help me. Yes. I'm not preaching to
[1:05:20] you tonight. I'm preaching to myself.
[1:05:22] Lord, help me. Amen. Amen. That we would
[1:05:25] come and realize that the worst enemy is
[1:05:28] us not surrendering That's right. to the
[1:05:31] word. That's right. Amen. And it's it's
[1:05:34] not this out here, you know, my brother
[1:05:36] and sister. I it's us
[1:05:39] allowing
[1:05:41] another gate to be opened.
[1:05:45] You know, I'll give you a natural
[1:05:47] example. Sister Jerry and I flew into
[1:05:49] Doulas one time. Our whole flights were
[1:05:51] delayed from the minute we got on a
[1:05:53] plane in Boisee. They couldn't get an
[1:05:55] overhead bin to to latch. The latch
[1:05:57] broke. And and uh one of the steartesses
[1:06:00] says, "Let's just tape it shut." And the
[1:06:01] other one said, "I don't think that's
[1:06:03] allowed." An hour and something later, a
[1:06:05] mechanic got on the plane with good old
[1:06:07] guess what? Duct tape. Duct tape. And
[1:06:11] tape the door shut. So now we've lost an
[1:06:14] hour and something and literally we end
[1:06:16] up at Doulus a and our flight we're
[1:06:19] going to South Africa and our flight
[1:06:21] everything is messed up and we come up
[1:06:22] here and we landed at one of those
[1:06:24] islands out there and as we're there
[1:06:26] they said, "Well, you get on the bus and
[1:06:28] one will take you here, one will take."
[1:06:29] We come up and we ask the man, "Sir,
[1:06:31] this is the gate. Which end of the
[1:06:33] terminals is this gate?" And the man
[1:06:35] says, "Just get on this bus
[1:06:38] and then proceeds to take us to the
[1:06:39] farthest end of the airport."
[1:06:43] And then we run.
[1:06:45] And it wasn't just us. There's a little
[1:06:47] short-legged lady that was there on the
[1:06:49] thing. Needed to get on the same and and
[1:06:51] she's just like, I think I'm having a
[1:06:54] heart attack.
[1:06:56] But they did hold the plane for us and
[1:06:59] ultimately we come on and everybody
[1:07:00] scowlled as we went to our seat. They
[1:07:02] looked at us.
[1:07:04] But you see my brother and sister, it's
[1:07:07] there that we'll find distractions.
[1:07:11] And I remember finally sitting down in
[1:07:13] my seat and I'm like
[1:07:18] these and I won't say the word because
[1:07:20] my wife doesn't like me to say the word
[1:07:23] but it comes out of my mouth too often.
[1:07:26] It's s t u p. Anyway, you know what I'm
[1:07:31] and I was just kind of fuming.
[1:07:34] Why couldn't the man just tell us to get
[1:07:37] on that bus?
[1:07:41] And then later I decided he doesn't care
[1:07:43] what bus I get on. It's not his problem.
[1:07:46] His job is to drive here and stop and
[1:07:50] you get off the bus. And to drive here
[1:07:54] and stop and people get off the bus and
[1:07:58] drive here. Oh, I don't want to be too
[1:07:59] repetitious, but that's his job. All
[1:08:02] he's got to do is be qualified to drive
[1:08:05] the bus.
[1:08:07] And he doesn't care about some poor guy
[1:08:11] getting on the bus and off. And that's
[1:08:14] Satan. He doesn't care to send you to
[1:08:17] the wrong end, to the wrong gate, to the
[1:08:20] wrong place. Doesn't care about your
[1:08:22] reaction. Doesn't care if you catch the
[1:08:24] flight, whether you are blessed or
[1:08:26] angry. He doesn't care.
[1:08:31] He's just doing his job. Amen. See each
[1:08:34] year a man sacrificed. Each year he come
[1:08:37] back because he still had the same
[1:08:38] desire. The life of the animal atoned
[1:08:40] for his sin. But being animal blood that
[1:08:43] was shed and animal life that was given,
[1:08:46] it could not come back upon the man. If
[1:08:48] it had come back, it still would not
[1:08:50] have availed. It wouldn't not have done
[1:08:54] the job. It wasn't sufficient. Okay,
[1:08:58] let's move forward. But when Christ, the
[1:09:01] perfect substitute, was given and his
[1:09:04] blood was shed, then the life that was
[1:09:06] in Christ came back upon the repentant
[1:09:08] sinner. And that life being the perfect
[1:09:11] life of Christ, sinless and righteous,
[1:09:14] then the guilty one could go free for uh
[1:09:18] for he had no desire to sin. Now, I want
[1:09:21] you to look at this, my brother and
[1:09:22] sister. Why this makes me happy? Because
[1:09:25] I don't care what your week was like. I
[1:09:28] don't care what your month was like. The
[1:09:31] perfect blood of Jesus Christ has
[1:09:34] covered you. And you can stand here now
[1:09:37] and come freely before the Lord Jesus
[1:09:40] Christ without one mark, one mar,
[1:09:43] without one strike against you. And we
[1:09:46] would say, "But I I don't know. I I did
[1:09:49] this." Amen. Can anyone tonight lift a
[1:09:51] hand and say, "I did this." Amen. You
[1:09:54] know, the devil just uses that. Oh,
[1:09:56] don't you can't take communion cuz you
[1:09:58] said this or you did this. My brother
[1:10:01] and sister, the perfect blood has come
[1:10:03] and all we've got to do is say, "Lord,
[1:10:05] please wash me. Cover me with that." And
[1:10:08] it's settled. Amen. We're washed with
[1:10:10] it. But look how Satan can take it. I've
[1:10:13] done it a lot myself, saints. We'll take
[1:10:16] a little something in our life and we'll
[1:10:18] let the devil pump that thing up until
[1:10:20] it is absolutely a giant in front of us.
[1:10:23] And then we feel like we are too
[1:10:25] unworthy to even approach God. Amen. To
[1:10:29] even come and say, "I'm sorry." It just
[1:10:32] seems like too daunting of a task. And
[1:10:34] Satan's over there just pumping that
[1:10:36] thing up just as hard as he can and it's
[1:10:38] getting in our way. We can't see beyond
[1:10:40] that. when beyond that is the very word
[1:10:43] that has already, can I say it again,
[1:10:46] already delivered us is right there
[1:10:49] beyond Satan's veil that he's trying to
[1:10:52] cloak from your sight. Amen. It's a It's
[1:10:57] a perfect plan. Satan's got Amen.
[1:11:01] Amen. The life being perfect life of
[1:11:03] Christ, sinless and righteous, and the
[1:11:05] guilty one to go free, for he had no
[1:11:06] desire to sin. The life of Jesus had
[1:11:09] come back upon him. That is what is
[1:11:11] meant in Romans 8:2. The law of the
[1:11:14] spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made
[1:11:16] me free from the law of sin and death.
[1:11:19] Now my brother and sister, we can offer
[1:11:20] up and say, "But I I was I wasn't
[1:11:22] sinless or I I did say this or I did do
[1:11:26] this or I did think this or I did take
[1:11:28] this physical action." But I want you to
[1:11:31] understand the prophet himself lays a
[1:11:33] very clear picture that God said you
[1:11:36] never did it in the first place. Can
[1:11:38] someone say amen today that we never did
[1:11:41] it in the first place? The only memory
[1:11:44] that we're recounting that's holding us
[1:11:46] back is Satan's image he's projecting to
[1:11:50] you to keep you from moving forward in
[1:11:52] the word. And he's so good. You know,
[1:11:55] the military now has such incredible
[1:11:58] they still have it under wraps, you
[1:12:00] might say. They have incredible cloaking
[1:12:03] ability.
[1:12:05] So much so there is uh videos that are
[1:12:07] released that looks like a a literally
[1:12:10] it looks like just a hallway in a
[1:12:12] building on this video. And what it is
[1:12:15] is a perfect picture of that hallway.
[1:12:18] But behind that, there are men walking
[1:12:22] in this demonstration. Men walking back
[1:12:24] and forth and side to side in this
[1:12:27] hallway. But all you see it just looks
[1:12:30] like a hallway. Now, let's turn that
[1:12:32] around. Satan projects to you and I.
[1:12:35] He's cloaking the truth and he's
[1:12:37] projecting that you failed here, you
[1:12:39] failed there, you failed this, you
[1:12:41] failed that. And we are standing there.
[1:12:43] But the reality behind his cloaking is
[1:12:46] the fact that the pure blood of Jesus
[1:12:48] Christ has already wiped all of that out
[1:12:51] and we can go free. Amen. That we are
[1:12:54] free from the law of sin and death.
[1:12:56] Amen. I like that. Amen. God isn't
[1:12:59] cloaking it. He's wiping it out. It's
[1:13:02] not there to be hid. It's absolutely
[1:13:05] completely removed.
[1:13:07] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:13:10] Hallelujah. But the Jews back there in
[1:13:12] the time of Jesus did not want to accept
[1:13:16] that sacrifice.
[1:13:19] You realize humanity today, there's
[1:13:21] still a there's a still a a Pharisee
[1:13:25] type spirit in the land. Sadducee type
[1:13:27] spirit in the land. Not going to accept
[1:13:29] that sacrifice.
[1:13:31] Just not going to go there.
[1:13:34] The blood of bulls and goats made
[1:13:35] nothing perfect. It was once God's
[1:13:37] ordained method. See, we've got to we
[1:13:40] this is why I I I don't want to uh
[1:13:43] deviate from this, but this is one of
[1:13:45] the examples of why we have a
[1:13:47] progressive message. This is not us
[1:13:50] moving away from the prophet, which is
[1:13:52] what some say that that you know, you're
[1:13:54] trying to do. You're leaving the prophet
[1:13:56] behind. But my brother and sister, the
[1:13:58] prophet of God so clearly showed us that
[1:14:00] this bride, he even declares there'll be
[1:14:02] young men that would come forth and
[1:14:04] minister this message. You know, I'm
[1:14:07] paraphrasing this part. By the
[1:14:09] revelation of this prophetic word that's
[1:14:11] come, young men are going to rise up and
[1:14:13] they're going to preach this message to
[1:14:15] the coming of the Lord. Now, did he want
[1:14:18] us to just parrot what brother Brandham
[1:14:21] said? Is that what he's talking about?
[1:14:23] Just parrot what I said? No, my brother
[1:14:25] and sister, because the prophet of God
[1:14:27] said, I'm preaching what Paul's
[1:14:29] preaching. But he didn't just read
[1:14:31] Paul's words exactly every single time,
[1:14:35] but he was preaching the revelation that
[1:14:38] come forth and saw a prophet. Brother
[1:14:40] Brandham says that there is going to be
[1:14:42] young men that are going to rise up and
[1:14:45] they are going to have the revelation of
[1:14:47] what I have brought which was a a
[1:14:50] restored word there and they're not
[1:14:52] going to have a revelation. Brother
[1:14:53] Brandham said we use that as a reference
[1:14:55] but it's not the revelation of brother
[1:14:57] Brandham said but it's a revelation of
[1:14:59] restored word and as we speak the
[1:15:02] restored word whether the words match
[1:15:05] exactly to brother Brandham's as long as
[1:15:07] they match the spirit of truth. Amen.
[1:15:09] God blesses that and it goes forth and
[1:15:11] people then by revelation are growing
[1:15:14] spiritually which is what God is wanting
[1:15:17] from us is is spiritual growth. Amen. So
[1:15:21] it was once God's ordained method, but
[1:15:23] now Christ having appeared in the flesh
[1:15:25] by the shedding of his own blood has put
[1:15:27] away sin and by that offering of himself
[1:15:30] has made us perfect. Now look at this.
[1:15:32] If you'd go back, Brother Ivan, real
[1:15:34] quick. Amen. Now look at this once
[1:15:36] again. I want to put clarity. Having put
[1:15:39] away sin, having put away unbelief.
[1:15:44] Amen. That's the really the ultimate
[1:15:46] sin. Brother Brandon bundled all these.
[1:15:48] The rest are just attributes of
[1:15:51] unbelief. So here it is. Look what God's
[1:15:54] doing in our life. Can we can we
[1:15:57] acknowledge that God is doing something
[1:15:59] incredible in our life? It's not
[1:16:01] lightning. It's not thunder. We don't
[1:16:02] need all these things just shake and do
[1:16:05] whatever. But what's happening is he's
[1:16:07] taking and putting away our unbelief.
[1:16:12] He's putting it behind us. And as he
[1:16:14] puts it behind us, we're taking a step
[1:16:17] forward into greater faith, into a
[1:16:19] greater position of the word. And I see
[1:16:22] the word. And not only do I see the
[1:16:24] word, I see it in me. And I see it in my
[1:16:26] brother and my sister. I see it in the
[1:16:28] bride of Christ. I see this word. This
[1:16:31] revelation of Jesus Christ is being uh
[1:16:33] brought forth. It's coming forth. Just
[1:16:36] like a bride comes forth in the ceremony
[1:16:39] of the doors being opened. Amen. and
[1:16:42] coming out and and she's then revealed,
[1:16:46] amen, of who she is. Amen. The words
[1:16:49] coming to this bride and the doors of
[1:16:51] righteousness have been opened and it's
[1:16:54] revealing who she is. I say I get
[1:16:56] excited about that. Amen. Having
[1:16:59] appeared in the flesh by the shedding of
[1:17:01] his own blood has put away sin and by
[1:17:03] that offering of himself has made us
[1:17:06] perfect.
[1:17:08] Now you have to decide whether that
[1:17:10] perfect is still to be manifested
[1:17:13] or whether the seed of perfection is
[1:17:17] already in you. Amen. If your name's
[1:17:20] already on the lamb's book of life
[1:17:21] before the foundation of the world. If
[1:17:24] you are already ordained and God said,
[1:17:26] "I know who are my sheep." Amen. And
[1:17:30] they know my voice. Amen.
[1:17:34] That to me says the seed of perfection's
[1:17:37] already in us. It's just being watered
[1:17:41] by the water of the word.
[1:17:43] So
[1:17:45] while I say continue to strive
[1:17:47] diligently
[1:17:49] pressing to the mark of the high
[1:17:50] calling, when we make mistakes, don't
[1:17:53] say, "I must not be it because that sure
[1:17:55] wasn't perfect." But look to the
[1:17:57] promise. That's it. Don't look to
[1:17:59] circumstance. Look to the promise. Amen.
[1:18:03] Imagine
[1:18:05] Abraham and Sarah there in the tent on
[1:18:07] the plains of Mamry.
[1:18:10] Now Sarah murmurs in her heart. Now
[1:18:12] remember this is not a verbal
[1:18:14] conversation that Sarah goes, "Man, that
[1:18:16] ain't going to happen." It was something
[1:18:18] that was spoken in her heart. And
[1:18:20] imagine now every day waking up with
[1:18:24] this promise in front of you.
[1:18:32] We're going to have a baby.
[1:18:35] Sarah's already expressed. I don't think
[1:18:38] so. Do you realize what she had to
[1:18:41] overcome?
[1:18:43] Something that was already ingrained in
[1:18:46] her. Something that was already
[1:18:47] registered deep down in her where she's
[1:18:50] like, "Me in my old age. Have pleasure."
[1:18:53] Amen. In other words, a natural human
[1:18:56] action taking place. But I'm going to
[1:18:59] have pleasure with my Lord.
[1:19:03] No,
[1:19:05] you see, but God said it
[1:19:09] and God brought it to pass. But in that,
[1:19:13] regardless of Sarah's position,
[1:19:16] the Holy Spirit, Brother Bram says, is a
[1:19:18] gentleman, he did not force Sarah
[1:19:22] to accept it.
[1:19:24] But something was happening in Sarah.
[1:19:27] all those years. Now, let me just put a
[1:19:30] scenario to you.
[1:19:34] Maybe at the moment
[1:19:38] that it come to pass,
[1:19:41] Sarah had finally caught revelation.
[1:19:44] That's it. It took all those years
[1:19:48] for that to be revealed in her where she
[1:19:53] said, "I believe." had he right good
[1:19:57] example said in her heart that's nothing
[1:20:00] but the truth
[1:20:02] amen it was there it manifests itself
[1:20:07] could we be
[1:20:09] Sarah
[1:20:12] that it's taking time for us to reach
[1:20:16] out and fully accept what God has said
[1:20:19] about you and I
[1:20:23] Sarah my she didn't get washed up tossed
[1:20:26] away. My brother and sister, God just
[1:20:28] allowed the word, his promise to
[1:20:32] continue to work on her until the moment
[1:20:37] that it was realization.
[1:20:39] It moved from just words to reality.
[1:20:42] That's right. Amen. I don't know, just a
[1:20:45] thought if you don't mind me saying
[1:20:46] that. Put away sin. That offering of
[1:20:49] himself has made us perfect. Okay. So
[1:20:53] this is quite a lengthy quotations. I
[1:20:55] hope you don't mind. The Jews would not
[1:20:58] take that. But what about that
[1:21:00] Philadelphiaian age? This what he's
[1:21:02] preaching on the Philadelphiaian age and
[1:21:05] the other ages too. Whoa. It's now
[1:21:07] included Leodysia.
[1:21:10] Did they really accept this reality in
[1:21:12] Christ? No, sir. Even though Luther
[1:21:16] brought forth the truth of
[1:21:17] justification,
[1:21:18] the Roman church and its Eastern
[1:21:20] counterpart, the Orthodox Church, still
[1:21:22] clung to works. Now, works are fine, but
[1:21:26] they don't save you. Amen. Look, brother
[1:21:29] and sister, how often we have heard
[1:21:32] these things about works, and I think
[1:21:34] there's a little bit of root of that
[1:21:38] still clinging to us that I've, oh, I
[1:21:42] did this. I've got to somehow erase
[1:21:44] that. I thought this or whatever and I
[1:21:47] need to this and I I need to this and I
[1:21:50] need to this. Amen. I think Okay, just
[1:21:53] accept it as opinion tonight. I think
[1:21:55] this spirit is still hanging around and
[1:21:58] it is still present in the message.
[1:22:01] Yeah. That we are thinking we got to do
[1:22:04] something.
[1:22:06] Oh my brother and sister, we do only
[1:22:08] believe. That's the something we've got
[1:22:10] to do. Amen. Amen. It still clung to
[1:22:14] works. Now works are fine but they don't
[1:22:16] save you. They don't make you perfect.
[1:22:19] It is Christ or perish. It is not even
[1:22:22] Christ and works. It is Christ alone.
[1:22:26] This age began the years of Armenianism
[1:22:29] that does not believe in Christ as the
[1:22:32] reality. It does not sing nothing but
[1:22:34] the blood for it sings nothing but the
[1:22:36] blood and my own. Oh, look at this. Come
[1:22:40] on saints. my own conduct.
[1:22:44] Oh, you know, my conduct didn't quite
[1:22:46] pass the conduct test and so therefore I
[1:22:49] must be messed up. No, I tell you, my
[1:22:52] brother and sister, when God called you,
[1:22:55] he provided everything you need and I
[1:22:58] need to make the rapture. Amen. That's
[1:23:00] not quite the exact words, but it in
[1:23:03] context is exactly what brother Brandham
[1:23:05] said. Amen. That what we need to make
[1:23:07] the rapture has already been. So let's
[1:23:10] get this idea of what I believe plus my
[1:23:13] conduct because the word Amen in the
[1:23:16] inside. Brother Brown talking on those
[1:23:18] wings of a snow white dove. He's talking
[1:23:21] about that crow can eat anything.
[1:23:24] But the dove comes the crow needs a bath
[1:23:27] every once in a while. But the dove is
[1:23:30] washed from the inside out.
[1:23:34] Oh hallelujah. So the dove doesn't have
[1:23:37] to go around and say, "I got a little
[1:23:38] dust on me. I think I got to go find
[1:23:40] somewhere to take care of this and do
[1:23:42] this. It's just naturally being
[1:23:44] cleansed. Amen. Maybe less focused on,
[1:23:47] oh, we got to keep the sin out of the
[1:23:49] church and more focus on let's get the
[1:23:50] Holy Ghost in the church. Amen. Cuz when
[1:23:53] we get the Holy Ghost in the church, the
[1:23:55] sin will leave. Amen. Satan doesn't like
[1:23:58] that presence. He doesn't like that.
[1:24:01] Amen.
[1:24:02] Uh now works are fine, but they don't
[1:24:05] save you. They don't make you perfect as
[1:24:07] Christ or perish. It's not even Christ
[1:24:10] and works. It is Christ alone. This age
[1:24:12] began the years of Armenianism that does
[1:24:15] not believe in Christ as the reality. It
[1:24:18] does not sing nothing but the blood. For
[1:24:20] it sings nothing but the blood and my
[1:24:22] own conduct. Now I believe in good
[1:24:24] conduct. If you are saved, you will do
[1:24:28] righteously.
[1:24:30] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:24:34] We've already gone over that. But let me
[1:24:36] tell you now, salvation is not Jesus
[1:24:39] plus. Now, I'm just going to be real
[1:24:41] vocal with you tonight. There's a man
[1:24:43] who produces all kinds of videos on
[1:24:45] YouTube about leaving the message. And
[1:24:48] he says that that William Brandham
[1:24:51] preaches that it's the message of
[1:24:53] William Brandham plus Amen. or the Holy
[1:24:57] Ghost plus the message of William
[1:24:58] Brandham. He says that as though it's an
[1:25:00] emphatic quote that brother Brandham
[1:25:02] makes a statement like you have to have
[1:25:05] this and the Holy Ghost if you're going
[1:25:06] to make the rapture. But I wonder if
[1:25:08] that man ever read this. I've got a
[1:25:11] feeling that he's probably just going by
[1:25:14] his opinion, how he feels about it,
[1:25:18] because it doesn't get any straighter
[1:25:19] than this, does it? I I I mean, is there
[1:25:22] any questionable line here? It's not
[1:25:26] Jesus plus, right? It's Jesus alone.
[1:25:30] Salvation is of the Lord. From start to
[1:25:33] finish, it's all God. Let his life be in
[1:25:36] me. Let his blood that cleanses me, let
[1:25:39] it be. Let me back up. From start to
[1:25:41] finish, that is all God. Let his life be
[1:25:45] in me. Can we say amen? Amen. Let his
[1:25:48] blood that cleanses me. Let it be his
[1:25:52] spirit that fills me. Let it be his word
[1:25:55] in my heart and mouth. Let it be his
[1:25:58] stripes that heal me. Let it be Jesus
[1:26:01] and Jesus alone. Not my works, not by
[1:26:06] works of righteousness which I have
[1:26:08] done.
[1:26:11] Amen. We didn't open the gate to
[1:26:13] righteousness.
[1:26:15] And if we didn't open the gate, my
[1:26:17] brother and sister, then we can't be
[1:26:18] responsible as it is of where
[1:26:21] righteousness comes from. It comes from
[1:26:23] the word. Amen. It's Christ himself
[1:26:26] makes us righteous. The life
[1:26:30] and the life
[1:26:32] is present. Amen.
[1:26:36] Let it be Jesus and Jesus alone. Not by
[1:26:38] works of righteousness which I have
[1:26:39] done. No sir, Christ is my life. Amen.
[1:26:45] I've got just a couple more minutes if
[1:26:47] you don't mind. Amen. I look at that. I
[1:26:50] love that quote when reading that. I I
[1:26:52] just realize cuz uh as much as we try
[1:26:56] not to uh allow
[1:26:59] uh our as it would be what we have done
[1:27:03] our works it kind of tends to creep in
[1:27:05] on us almost like well I've been such a
[1:27:10] good believer recently you know just I
[1:27:13] just been and you know the minute you do
[1:27:15] that there's that one little twig or
[1:27:17] root there that just cause you to
[1:27:20] stumble
[1:27:22] And then we realize it's only by the
[1:27:25] grace of God. The word that was spoke
[1:27:28] over you didn't land on your neighbor.
[1:27:34] What God spoke over you came to you and
[1:27:38] you alone. Amen. Amen. So, we can't say,
[1:27:41] "Well, brother so and so, so spiritual
[1:27:43] just got a double dose." No, my brother
[1:27:45] and sister, you're ignoring what God has
[1:27:47] poured out on you while you are lifting
[1:27:50] up another man who in secret might have
[1:27:53] every bit the struggle that you have.
[1:27:58] But maybe the difference is is he looks
[1:27:59] up and says, "There's my promise." Amen.
[1:28:03] Amen. Yes. Will we walk to the promise?
[1:28:06] Will we claim the promise? I say, "Yeah,
[1:28:10] we will." Amen. I believe with all my
[1:28:13] heart we will. There'll be nothing
[1:28:14] hinder us from reaching or obtaining the
[1:28:18] promise that God has given us. Amen.
[1:28:21] Now, I want to go to possessing the gate
[1:28:23] of the enemy after trial. Move forward
[1:28:25] really quickly here. We are saved by the
[1:28:28] blood of God. That's where my faith is.
[1:28:32] Not to walk out there in the blood of a
[1:28:34] prophet.
[1:28:36] Right now, I don't want to go down that
[1:28:39] rabbit hole tonight, but when people are
[1:28:42] pointing back prophet, prophet, prophet,
[1:28:45] prophet, prophet,
[1:28:47] who did brother Brandham himself say he
[1:28:49] came to represent
[1:28:53] Christ.
[1:28:54] That's his whole goal is his own desire.
[1:28:58] Point us to Jesus Christ. So when you
[1:29:01] have people that are saying prophet,
[1:29:03] prophet, prophet, prophet, prophet,
[1:29:05] there's a spirit there. And I'm not
[1:29:07] going to say it's a lying spirit because
[1:29:09] we cannot remove the prophet from the
[1:29:11] equation. But my brother and sister,
[1:29:14] Malachi 4 says, "Behold, I send you."
[1:29:17] Right? Amen. So God was making an
[1:29:19] emphasis that there were people who
[1:29:21] would satisfy those words you in there.
[1:29:24] And he sent a prophet to us to
[1:29:27] straighten our hides out, get us lined
[1:29:30] up, get our thinking straightened up,
[1:29:32] get us back to the very words of the
[1:29:34] Apostle Paul. Get us back to those
[1:29:36] principles of the early apostles. Get us
[1:29:38] back to all those things. And when his
[1:29:41] job was done, he doesn't need to come
[1:29:42] back to see if you're doing it or not.
[1:29:45] As the bride of Jesus Christ, you hear
[1:29:48] his voice. Amen. Amen. Our Lord Jesus.
[1:29:51] Amen. You hear his voice. Amen.
[1:29:54] Not walk out there in the blood of an
[1:29:56] ordinary man or a teacher or a
[1:29:59] theologian. We walk there in the blood
[1:30:02] of God. God said so. He become human
[1:30:05] being. He changed his strand. He
[1:30:08] stretched his tent here with us and
[1:30:10] became one of us. He is our kinsman
[1:30:14] redeemer. Believe it or not, quotes as
[1:30:16] direct as this is here. I've had people
[1:30:18] argue over the principle of Jesus
[1:30:22] Christ, our kinsman redeemer.
[1:30:25] You have to wonder. I don't know. I
[1:30:27] don't want to get sidetracked, but you
[1:30:29] have to wonder what kind what are they
[1:30:32] hearing? What are they hearing? What do
[1:30:35] they read? What comes to them? It
[1:30:37] obviously my brother and sister has been
[1:30:40] somebody interpreted this
[1:30:43] besides this when when brother Barry it
[1:30:46] this really struck me strongly when
[1:30:48] brother brother Barry shows us the clip
[1:30:51] that's AI of Billy Graham only it's not
[1:30:55] Billy Graham
[1:30:57] and then brother Barry says and this
[1:30:59] will come
[1:31:01] this will come to the message people
[1:31:04] will say see I can do what I'm doing
[1:31:06] this is the prophet's choice
[1:31:09] and wait till the digital age overpowers
[1:31:11] everything.
[1:31:14] I know of believers, now this is a side
[1:31:16] note, sorry. I know of believers who
[1:31:18] have got rid of their cassette tapes and
[1:31:20] got rid of all their books because it's
[1:31:22] on their phone. It's on their iPad.
[1:31:26] I'm sorry. I like that. They're not
[1:31:29] going to change the print on the book
[1:31:32] inside my house. Amen. There is the
[1:31:36] solid foundation of reality where the
[1:31:38] word is at. But what's to stop them?
[1:31:42] Now, I'm not pointing any fingers, but
[1:31:44] what is to stop them from taking and you
[1:31:47] pushed that update? That's right.
[1:31:54] The last time you updated the table, I'm
[1:31:57] now don't misunderstand me. Just make an
[1:31:59] example. Last time you updated the
[1:32:01] table, did you sit down and go through
[1:32:03] the table and check it with a book or a
[1:32:06] tape?
[1:32:12] That's a point that we need to be
[1:32:14] careful cuz talk about skewering. Now,
[1:32:17] they might have good intention or
[1:32:19] someone might have good intention uh to
[1:32:21] interpret what brother Brandon was
[1:32:23] saying. But you see, God said you change
[1:32:26] one word. Yeah. This might sound a
[1:32:28] little harsh and I don't hold it as a
[1:32:31] fanatical view, but I believe that
[1:32:33] extends to changing one word of a
[1:32:35] prophet's message
[1:32:37] beyond the scripture to a prophet's
[1:32:39] message that people just kind of free to
[1:32:43] do.
[1:32:45] He became human being, changed his
[1:32:46] strand, stretched his tent here with us,
[1:32:48] became one of us. He's our kinsman
[1:32:50] redeemer. He had to become kinfolk to us
[1:32:54] because that was the law. God became man
[1:32:56] and dwelt among us. Notice how that in
[1:32:59] doing this he's coming from him was God
[1:33:02] the spirit and that spirit uh becomes
[1:33:06] upon the believer and therefore the life
[1:33:09] that was in our sacrifice we are
[1:33:12] identified by that same life. Amen.
[1:33:15] Isn't that beautiful? Amen. Says that he
[1:33:17] was tried in every fashion and form.
[1:33:20] Amen. And so that means ultimately this
[1:33:23] bride of Jesus Christ will not have a
[1:33:25] temper tantrum, will not have a vain
[1:33:28] imagination, will not have all of these
[1:33:30] things that that derail mankind. Hey, if
[1:33:33] we're facing that right now, be be
[1:33:36] optimistic. Uh be upbeat because the
[1:33:38] word is declaring to you, you'll conquer
[1:33:41] that. That will be taken under control.
[1:33:44] It will be brought in subjection. Amen.
[1:33:47] Thank you, Lord. Amen. if you would. I
[1:33:50] don't think this screen is working. But
[1:33:53] then then how can they see the life of
[1:33:56] God moving amongst the people and call
[1:33:58] it an unclean thing when that's our
[1:34:01] identification of our sacrifice?
[1:34:05] But many are
[1:34:08] he that believeth on me, the works that
[1:34:10] I do shall he also. his life returning
[1:34:14] upon the sacrifice from the sacrifice as
[1:34:17] we lay our hands upon it identifying
[1:34:20] oursel dead to our own thoughts. Amen.
[1:34:23] Now, our own thoughts, my brother and
[1:34:25] sister, might be just a little something
[1:34:27] you would stumble over. It might not be
[1:34:30] carnal, evil, wicked. It might be just
[1:34:32] something you stumble over, like not
[1:34:35] believing that this message is entirely
[1:34:38] for you. Yeah. Amen. or that you can't
[1:34:43] live
[1:34:45] this message.
[1:34:47] You realize those are thoughts out of
[1:34:48] the pits of hell, right? Yes.
[1:34:52] Are we okay? Yes.
[1:34:55] How can we let denominations
[1:34:58] push us into creeds and things and say
[1:35:01] we believe it? We are dead to those
[1:35:03] things. Now, I'm going to just throw
[1:35:04] something in here and I'm going to leave
[1:35:06] it hung out there to dry for you. But my
[1:35:08] brother and sister, the evidence is
[1:35:10] becoming more and more plain. There's a
[1:35:12] denominational spirit has entered into
[1:35:14] the message trying to cause people to
[1:35:17] conform to one common approach of the
[1:35:21] message. Now, what happens if that one
[1:35:24] common approach is flawed?
[1:35:29] Now, this is kind of a a deal, but you
[1:35:31] know, years ago, China had a
[1:35:33] state-owned, state-run airplane
[1:35:36] manufacturing company,
[1:35:39] and for a while there, basically every
[1:35:41] plane they built failed and crashed.
[1:35:46] Do you want to fly on Chinese Airways?
[1:35:50] I don't want to fly on something that
[1:35:52] man has said. If you believe the
[1:35:55] message, if you have the Holy Ghost,
[1:35:57] this is how you will see it.
[1:36:00] I won't accept that. And I don't believe
[1:36:02] you should either.
[1:36:06] From the sacrifice, we lay our hands
[1:36:08] upon it, identifying ourselves dead to
[1:36:10] our own thoughts. Then how can we let
[1:36:13] denomination push us into creeds and
[1:36:15] things and say we believe it? We are
[1:36:17] dead to those things. Paul said,"None of
[1:36:20] these things bother me." For he was tied
[1:36:22] to an absolute
[1:36:24] comm, means space,
[1:36:27] Christ.
[1:36:29] I don't think there's any
[1:36:31] I don't think there's any
[1:36:32] misunderstanding, is there tonight of
[1:36:35] what the prophet is saying or absolute
[1:36:37] is? No misunderstanding at all. Very
[1:36:41] clear. Yes. Amen. Don't bother. for he's
[1:36:45] tied to an absolute
[1:36:47] space of time. Identify clearly context
[1:36:53] Christ.
[1:36:55] Anybody else that puts an absolute in
[1:36:57] there
[1:36:59] is tweaking
[1:37:01] the prophet's message
[1:37:04] unless
[1:37:06] they believe Brother Brham
[1:37:09] was Christ.
[1:37:15] Yeah,
[1:37:20] think about it.
[1:37:24] And every true achievement is tied to an
[1:37:27] absolute. Amen.
[1:37:31] So, every true achievement is tied to
[1:37:34] Christ.
[1:37:36] My absolute. Oh my, this is getting
[1:37:39] really, really direct. I don't know how
[1:37:41] we're going to twist this one,
[1:37:44] but we'll try.
[1:37:46] Not. And my absolute is the word. Amen.
[1:37:52] Why didn't brother Brandham say my
[1:37:53] absolute is my message that I've
[1:37:55] brought?
[1:37:57] Because that wasn't his absolute.
[1:38:01] H
[1:38:05] and everybody else that's really born of
[1:38:07] the spirit, their absolute. Oh my. I
[1:38:10] don't mean to be controversial tonight,
[1:38:12] but these spirits are rising up and
[1:38:14] they're making a lot of noise. Yeah.
[1:38:16] They're making a lot of noise. They want
[1:38:18] to be heard. They want their presence to
[1:38:20] be seen. Amen. It's really born of the
[1:38:23] spirit. Their absolute is God's word.
[1:38:27] I'm tied to it. Amen. My brother and
[1:38:30] sister, I tell you what, that's that's
[1:38:32] pretty straightforward. I think I laid
[1:38:35] my hands upon it and it took my place
[1:38:37] and I've identified myself with him. We
[1:38:40] knew that he promised to identify
[1:38:42] himself with us. Is he identified with
[1:38:44] us tonight? That brings genuine faith.
[1:38:48] Not your own faith, but his faith.
[1:38:50] Something you don't control.
[1:38:53] Wait just a second. I want more faith.
[1:38:55] I'm going to get more faith. There's
[1:38:56] more faith for me. I'm going to do this
[1:38:58] and I'm going to do that for more faith.
[1:39:00] I'm sorry. You don't control it. He
[1:39:02] does. Amen. Amen. He's the one that
[1:39:05] dispenses and pours that out. Now, can
[1:39:07] we present an atmosphere and move into a
[1:39:11] place that matches what God's program
[1:39:13] is, matches God's uh uh view of this,
[1:39:16] God's presentation of this, his promise
[1:39:18] of this. Yes, we can. But my brother and
[1:39:20] sister, we're not going to give oursel
[1:39:22] real faith. Amen. God is the one who
[1:39:25] gives us real faith. Amen. Something you
[1:39:28] don't control, he does it. Now notice
[1:39:29] then and then only when is the promise
[1:39:33] made to you. Ain't that beautiful? I
[1:39:36] hope tonight I haven't been too blunt,
[1:39:38] too straightforward. But I just like to
[1:39:41] go to Hebrews chapter 4 as we're
[1:39:43] closing. Amen.
[1:39:49] Verse 12- 16. For the word of God is
[1:39:53] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[1:39:56] two-edged sword, piercing even to the
[1:39:58] dividing a sunder of soul and spirit of
[1:40:01] the joints and marorrow. And as a
[1:40:03] discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:40:05] intents of the heart, something we can't
[1:40:08] even without the Holy Ghost, you can't
[1:40:12] discern the thoughts and intents of
[1:40:14] heart. Well, it sure looks like that
[1:40:17] this person is this way. They might be
[1:40:20] going through the most fiery trial.
[1:40:23] I liked how brother Barry brought that
[1:40:26] out talking about the fiery furnace
[1:40:28] coming right up to the edge. Their toes
[1:40:32] all curled up there. Amen. Needed a
[1:40:34] little bit of imagination, you know, cuz
[1:40:36] you didn't see his toes curl up in his
[1:40:39] shoes, but you know, their toes curled
[1:40:42] up and the Lord Jesus standing right
[1:40:46] there. Take the step. Amen.
[1:40:49] Don't hold back. Take this step.
[1:40:55] I don't know. Just a thought.
[1:40:58] If they had hesitated a little longer,
[1:41:03] what would have happened?
[1:41:06] Let me just put it this way to you. This
[1:41:08] not scriptural.
[1:41:10] Maybe the Holy Spirit would have said,
[1:41:13] "You're one chosen to go through the
[1:41:15] fire. Maybe he'd have come out of the
[1:41:17] fire. Maybe he'd have come around and
[1:41:20] said, "God bless you, Shadrach.
[1:41:24] It's time for you to go through the
[1:41:27] fire." Sometimes the Lord just gives
[1:41:29] uncction and moves us when we we might
[1:41:32] get our toes too wrapped around the edge
[1:41:34] of that furnace and God comes along and
[1:41:37] says, "I'll just let this circumstance
[1:41:39] cause you to take that step." I don't
[1:41:42] know. Just saying. Just saying.
[1:41:45] Amen.
[1:41:49] Neither is there any creature that is
[1:41:50] not manifest in his sight, but all
[1:41:52] things are naked and open unto the eyes
[1:41:54] of him with whom we have to do. Seeing
[1:41:57] then that we have a great high priest.
[1:42:00] Do we have a great high priest tonight?
[1:42:01] Amen. That passed into the heavens,
[1:42:04] right? He's not in a fiery furnace any
[1:42:06] longer. He's passed into the heavens,
[1:42:08] Jesus the son of God. Let us hold fast
[1:42:11] our profession. For we have not a high
[1:42:14] priest which cannot be touched with a
[1:42:17] feeling of our infirmities, but was at
[1:42:19] all points tempted like as we are, yet
[1:42:22] without sin. Let us therefore come
[1:42:25] boldly
[1:42:26] unto the throne of grace that we may
[1:42:29] obtain mercy and find grace to help in
[1:42:32] the time of need. That's right. Amen.
[1:42:35] Please come. Amen. Amen. As we look at
[1:42:38] this, I hope tonight that uh we do, you
[1:42:41] know, you say, "But brother Paul, we
[1:42:43] need a release."
[1:42:45] Let our worship and our praise to our
[1:42:48] Lord Jesus Christ be our release.
[1:42:50] There's a place, Brother Brandham, as he
[1:42:52] preached the sermon, letting off the
[1:42:54] pressure, my brother and sister, there's
[1:42:56] a place for us to let off the pressure.
[1:42:58] It doesn't have to be road rage, and it
[1:43:00] doesn't have to be domestic, and it
[1:43:02] doesn't have to be any of these things
[1:43:03] that the world is consumed by, right?
[1:43:06] You know, there's research that comes
[1:43:08] out and I I don't want to deviate off
[1:43:09] into this, but there's research that's
[1:43:11] come out and many many people have
[1:43:14] become alcoholics
[1:43:16] because they simply declare, I was
[1:43:18] trying to find a way to get away from
[1:43:21] this pressure of the business world and
[1:43:24] the family and and they become
[1:43:26] alcoholics trying to let off the
[1:43:27] pressure. And then the alcoholic side of
[1:43:30] it then creates another pressure. It
[1:43:32] doesn't take this one away, just creates
[1:43:34] another one. Let's find I got my hand
[1:43:38] up. Let's find
[1:43:41] that sweet release in praise and worship
[1:43:44] before our Lord Jesus Christ. Let's not
[1:43:47] try and find another something to to let
[1:43:50] that off, another hobby, another, you
[1:43:53] know, activity. You know, I I know I got
[1:43:56] a a good friend and and he says, "You
[1:43:58] know, I run because when I run, all all
[1:44:03] the pressure gets left behind me.
[1:44:06] But when I get home, unfortunately, it's
[1:44:09] still there."
[1:44:12] See, we can't outrun those things. But
[1:44:16] in the presence of God, in praise and
[1:44:18] worship, we can find that and let off
[1:44:21] that pressure. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:44:25] Let's sing that song. Let's just stand.
[1:44:27] Sing that song in Christ alone.
[1:44:30] Brother Alex, if you would come.
[1:44:34] That's what we want is just to
[1:44:37] find it in Christ alone.
[1:44:44] [Music]
[1:44:47] In Christ alone
[1:44:52] I place my trust
[1:44:57] and find my glory in the power of the
[1:45:04] cross.
[1:45:07] In every victory,
[1:45:13] let it be said
[1:45:16] of me.
[1:45:19] My source of strength,
[1:45:23] my source of hope
[1:45:27] is Christ alone.
[1:45:33] In Christ alone
[1:45:36] will I glory
[1:45:39] though I could pride myself
[1:45:44] in battles won.
[1:45:48] For I've been blessed beyond measure
[1:45:54] and by his strength alone
[1:45:59] I'll overcome.
[1:46:03] Oh, I could stop and count successes
[1:46:10] like diamonds in my hands.
[1:46:17] But those throes could not equal
[1:46:23] to the grace
[1:46:26] by which I stand.
[1:46:31] In Christ alone
[1:46:36] I place my trust
[1:46:41] and find my glory in the power of the
[1:46:48] cross.
[1:46:50] In every victory,
[1:46:56] let it be said
[1:46:59] of me.
[1:47:01] My source of strength,
[1:47:06] my source of hope
[1:47:10] is Christ alone.
[1:47:15] Amen. Let's go to number 404.
