amen amen you may have your seats praise the Lord Isaac you want to put up 977 man I just want to just make another announcement just keep everybody up to date please continue to check the website with regards to our church reopening for those to be able to come back to church all of you and I really miss you I'll be honest say that it's it's definitely a you're definitely missed but we just want to just be aware take a look at the website in the next couple days we'll have a possible announcement know when we can all reconvene so let's be in prayer about that it's uh this is we can return the service let's start with a horse [Music] hi I'm Felipe the difference is all convey I died the sleeping if that's what it takes hi Philippe attaching the way of your bride I died believing you're living in [Music] they stand before you are kissing penises pressure is hot seasoning cold I know my pain was all the raphe on your world I'll stand your hand in mine to guide me my promise [Music] and I believe a the difference the toes in pain I died believe me if that's what it takes I believe a bug catching the way of your bra I died Felipe you're living in LA [Music] eccentric Volta memories my thought won't let me be Raiden's battle ever fought rages on in me although I look defeated now just wait around and see the Spirit of the Living God during battle for me I died believe me the difference Golden Bay hi believe me if that's what it takes I can take away of your pride I died believing you're living inside [Music] your spoken word may flash in me earn your pride for

believing the difference it's all in vain I died leave me if that's what it takes I'd die believing the catching away of your pride your living is I believe we can say amen to that tonight hallelujah well I just thought the song service tonight would have been tailor-made if I had shared with brother Jason what I was going to speak on but we haven't talked so I find that interesting amen I'd like to speak to you again preparation of the inner man part for now I have a question to ask tonight and that would be for each one of us if I could impose upon you to ask yourself this question is my soul ready now one might construe that brother Paul would be questioning whether you were ready or not but you see this is something that we need to speak to ourselves each and every day it is something that we need to to hold to a very high level to know that Satan would come he's like a thief and a robber and he would come and he tries to make deposits you might say in the accounts of our lives to influence us to put little things you know bitterness Envy strife pride all of these kind of things that can be in our life sometimes and not be totally evident and so we just take a moment we'll we'll touch on some things in a minute but let's just stand for the reading of the word we want to go to Hebrews the tenth chapter verse 38 and 39 so we're still working out the exact direction that we want to take as the state allows us to start to have church they do have certain guidelines and one of the issues that we have to abide by or should abide by is their social distancing and so we have to do some calculating on how we're going about reopening the church now if it seems like we're dragging our feet I'm not we just want to do the right thing the correct thing amen Hebrews the tenth chapter verse 38 39 now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back and we say amen to that we are not of them who draw back into perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul Heavenly Father we thank you today Lord for your grace for your mercy for your guiding hand Lord we're asking for wisdom Lord and the days forward father that we would be able to make the right decisions Lord that would be for the benefit of the church the people that would be pleasing also to you for father we want to just present the right atmosphere Lord we don't want to present an atmosphere of rebellion or resistance Lord but father we know Lord the hour we live in is an hour father that is coming to more perilous times for your word says that in the time that they would try peace peace then would come sudden destruction but Lord we are here today father our hearts still breaking Lord for the thousands of people that are affected by this virus literally tens of thousands Lord and we thank you for your hand of mercy that's been upon the believers Lord father we ask you to remain father as our protection father and Lord touch those families Lord whether they know you are not touched those families Lord father give consolation to their Souls father for those who have lost loved ones Lord or very sick now we asked Lord once again as I have said we are hand of mercy to be upon this group of believers to continue to lead us and guide us we ask this in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated so tonight as it is that we are looking I have been listening to the sermon God's chosen place of worship so there'll be several references to that tonight because these things as have been working I've been able to just listen and it's been very good now in God's chosen place of worship I want to just start off with something that I believe would be each and every one of us desire it would be our prayer it would be something that unction we could speak out my brother and sister we never want to come to the place that we feel like we've got enough of God that we've got enough of the word that we've been in his presence enough we want to always be expressing Lord I would desire more now brother Branham says here and now with our heads bowed and I trust our hearts are bowed too I wonder how many in here tonight would like to be remembered in prayer and certainly Saints were not here together but you know what you're not lifting your hand to man anyhow you're not lifting your heart to man so just let the Lord know tonight you want to be remembered remembered in prayer of something special would you just raise your hand and say God give to me tonight that what I'm seeking for hallelujah I believe every one of us would just lift a hand and make that claim it might be something in the physical body that we would be needing the Lord to touch us it might be something that is as as the song says you know sins of the past sins a they're Satan's constantly coming in the greatest battle ever fought and sometimes we just simply need a deliverance from things of the past things that are or you might say a humiliating or shameful in our memory and we just ask the Lord tonight to give to us that that we're seeking for but I believe my brother and sister the real hearts desire in spite of what Satan might be trying to take you back to a certain time or place or event a circumstance my brother and sister I believe the thing that we as the Bride of Christ are really seeking for is more of the Lord amen do to find that place where we come into the unity of the Spirit come into rapturing faith in and we can discuss step right out of here that's what we're looking for and you know many people want to know you know is the bride going to be persecuted just listening to brother Jason DeMars give one of his little you might I don't know what they call him little webinar thing and you know and and he starts right off but very clearly what the prophet of God says that you know when that time comes that pressure that is coming on that the bride is not going to be closed up she'll be raised up amen she'll be lifted up amen so we're looking at and that's what we're looking for is that rapturing faith we're looking for that complete abandonment of our ability of our self or our security in our self and my brother and sister always when I think about security and selves I think of the rich young ruler and how the day come when he was lifted up his barns was full you might say his bank accounts were full but that was the very time the very season that his soul was accounted of him and and of course the next that he appears in Scripture he's looking across that broad Gulf and just desiring for just a finger to be touched in the water and brought to him so all of that that he accomplished in the in the natural left nothing tonight for him to to stand in security and so I say tonight I know what I'm seeking for I want more of the law I want this man purged I want this man washed by the water of the word and as the word comes forth my brother and sister I don't want a word that tickles us I don't want us to sit here as I spoke the other day as time goes forward I'm don't want to become you know a cranky old pastor I don't want to become you know just somebody that nobody wants to talk to but my brother and sister it's time for us to quit playing church and get serious a time for us to stop and sit at the edge of the pool and wait for the moving of God he said he would come he said he would be in our myths and he said that his power amen supernatural power would be in the midst of his people and we are his people can we say amen to that tonight we're not just hoping we're not just looking and wishing but we are acknowledging tonight you say well brother Paul you know we got to be careful yeah we got to be careful that the devil doesn't come in and rob our testimony or identity from us we got to be careful he doesn't silence our voices we got to be careful that he doesn't let tradition take us over we got to be careful that we don't just sit down and just say well if the Lord wants it to change he'll change it my brother and sister he's give us his word his word is open his word has been freely given to you and I too possess it and make it our very own and so if not we must take what has been given to us right our inheritance well I can tell you in the natural if someone come in and told you you had an inheritance and someone come the next day and said well because you have and I have not you must give this inheritance to me my brother and sister you would say I do not owe you devil anything and so we are sitting here today my brother and sister being careful about the wrong things we ought not be careful about jumping up out of our seat and shouting hallelujah we ought not be careful about saying thank the Lord and letting the world know what God has been doing for us we ought not be careful about singing we ought not be careful about crying and praising God the presents my brother and sister we ought not be careful about those things we ought to be careful about what the devil is trying to do amen so I tell you my brother and sister as you look at this and we move forward as sons and daughters of God I want to want to once again just give emphasis Oh God give me tonight that what I'm seeking for amen that's what we're here that's why we're gathered together that's why we have made a commitment my brother and sister to take as it is the hard road or the higher road amen now we look at this and and I just want to move in you know sometimes I remember some time back an individual had told me that they had partaken you might say of all of the message of the hour that they needed they just needed just a little bit here and there and my brother and sister I I don't know you don't have to agree with me I'm not trying to make some doctrinal point but I know that that is not me no matter how much I read my Bible no matter how much I pray no matter how much I have opportunity to listen to the Prophet I have never reached a point I say that was enough my brother and sister I want more there's more to be had amen the hungry soul Matthew the fifth chapter the sixth verse says Amen blessed are they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled but just like in the human element we would eat today and we will be hungry in the morning in fact we might be hungry before we go to bed tonight and so you look at that my brother and sister how that sons and daughters of God they are taking in the word but we are also you might say consuming it and that is the very life that is within us that is the very wind as it were that would be beneath our wings you'll never see an eagle say I felt the currents enough I no longer need the current they're constantly seeking out the current to rise higher amen because you see even in the great ability of the Eagle the labor through to fly on its own to that elevation is more than the Eagle would possess within itself but God giving an instinct to the Eagle to seek out the thermal current and to ride that into heavenly places and we are sons and daughters of God today with a hunger in our soul a desire in our soul my brother and sister that we want this soul to be satisfied now the prophet of God talks about how in what a shame he says it is that people would take that that spiritual hunger that God placed into a man or a woman's life and do satisfy or try to satisfy that with the things of the world amen now I'm not going to speak ill of watching a movie at home and these kind of things but I just want us to be aware that sometimes we need to just go to the word when we start to look at these things and we say well and I need something to preoccupy me I need something to do this if we're not careful God might be speaking to you to go pick up your Bible to pick up the message and we'll go satisfy it with watching a doctrine documentary on the Titanic or up on this orb on that and I'm not speaking down to you my brother and sister I've done this same thing but we got to be careful just like oftentimes they tell you that people will go start rummaging through the fridge they'll think they're hungry but reality is they're actually thirsty and they're looking for something in the body sending the signal but they're misinterpreting the signal and believing they're hungry when the body's actually crying out because it's thirsty and sometimes my brother and sister I believe we we don't respond in the right way but I say I stand with this tonight blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness keep pursuing it don't stop never let someone convince you that you've got enough of this message this word of the hour keep digging keep consuming my brother and sister until we become the very word hallelujah we don't have to satisfy or settle for just being message believers believing that something was sent believing something's been presented we buy the word the prophet of God I won't go into the quote tonight but the prophet of God said that we have to become the very word Oh hallelujah my you are what you eat I hope tonight you're not a disney princess you see this hunger and thirst will be with us the prophet of god says and i'm not going to go into the quotes you know if you know the message you'll know I'm telling you the truth he said wherever there's a hunger there has to be something to satisfy that hunger he ties that in in the deep calleth to the deep and if there's a deep calling there must be a deep to respond so we as humans all built in the same elements you might say now not talking about the perversion that Satan would bring upon humanity just talking about the very nature of humanity where there is a deep calling there must be a deep to respond and if you're crying out for more of God that means there is more of God to be given to you what you've got to do is lift up your hand as we were there in that prayer lord give me tonight when I'm seeking for give me today Lord what I need because it's there it's available well will we possess that will we take and claim that amen hallelujah now look my brothers and sisters as we'll look at this tonight we'll recognize what we're looking at here is a self analysis of our spiritual condition now my brother and sister I always found it ironic how that it's so easy for us to judge others and say you know what I think they should do this or this do you really realize you're taking a very moral position you're believing you hold high ground and are qualified to judge the individual in their situation you know the irony of this comes out in a little cartoon that I I saw and here is a very obese doctor talking to a very obese man and he's telling him you must cut out all of these foods that are contributing to your obesity my brother and sister how can one judge Amen what we've got to do is stop and say you know what Lord I'm not here to judge others tonight my real concern Lord is to look at my own soul to stand in front of the mirror of the word and look at my own soul because you see God is going to correct us can we say amen to that he's going to put us in a position where we will see and and we shouldn't be glum we shouldn't be despondent we shouldn't be depressed about that we should be saying Lord put me in the position where I see my shortcoming put me in the position Lord where I recognize by the word Lord that I have something missing or I have focused too much on something and Lord let me see it let the preaching of the word let it come from the tape let it just come to me by as it were revelation let me come Lord to see where my shortcoming might be because my heart's desire Lord is not just to live a good life here and I'll tell you Saints I desire to live a good life here I want to live a good life here amen if the Lord tarries another 50 years I want to have a good life till my life is over but my brother and sister what's more important than a good life is a life in Jesus Christ amen a life that our soul having been washed by the water of the word has a Liberty do you know we can have all the freedoms in the world in the United States has as much or more freedoms than any country on the face of the earth my brother and sister and yet we're a nation that is in the greatest bondage of indignation in the earth my brother and sister so you see what we're looking for is not just the freedom to get in our car and drive downtown and buy an ice cream it is not just a Liberty to say we're going to town for a pizza tonight it's not those kind of liberties who are looking for we're looking for the Liberty that is in the soul that leaves us day by day knowing with the security I might have made a mistake today Lord forgive me but I have a security a Liberty in me to know that as a son or daughter of God that the Lord will correct me he will not always leave me out there in permissable will he will not always leave me out there in the shadows because I am his child he will bring me right back into the word again and you talk about something that gives you a security now some would say well brother Paul we've never really went out by God's grace we've lived you know a good life we've lived the word well but I say thank you Lord but some of us had to go out and Rumble through the brambles and over the rocks and fall off a cliff or to my brother and sister and I have to be honest with you I think that gives some of us a maybe tad bit greater appreciation for what God is doing to know that we once were lost and when I say lost not in the metaphorical sense but literally lost and had no clue where we were going and God come along and said because you are my son because you are my daughter I will bring you back and put you in the right place amen because you see there's still a hunger and there's still a thirst that's hiding down in the heart of every backslidden Christian oh my brother and sister God won't let that go he's going to keep that there and he'll tickle it he'll tickle that he'll he'll bring it about to where your consciousness brings you back to the place and you will acknowledge I know I should be doing different and you see what God's doing is giving us a self-examination of our own soul that we can look at it and say lord help me I'm seeking something greater than I have right now amen hallelujah well thank you lord you know my brother and sister look here what the brush brother brown I'm saying here I'm the sev church age book see now what we don't want to do Saints is get to a position we fool ourselves that we would come along we recognize that Laodicea is the culmination of all the ages it's a culmination of God's plan he's bringing it into fruition but if we're not careful my brother and sister will get the idea that we are something more than anybody else has ever been or will be now understand we can take the scripture that they without us will not be made perfect but you see that's because we're a last part or a Lynch key or the Keystone or however you want to put it in the equation so for the plan to be perfect we've got to show up amen but look what the brother Brown says here in the church age book Laodicean Church age now they're all saying or trying to prove that they have it all talking about the denominations or they have enough yet is that the truth compare this 20th century Church to the first century Church go ahead do that so we can start having a comparison I like to do that do you guys like to do that I'll tell you I'm a real pro and con guy sometimes you just got to stop and just talk it through and say okay if I do this what's the benefits of this and if I do this what is the negative or the con part of it and and when you start to look at that my when you come to something that has way more negatives than it has positives you know it's caused you to stop and look and say this isn't really such a good idea amen so I'm real into that amen I scratch paper all the time about you know should I or shouldn't I kind of and and that's not my answer my brother and sister I tried to mostly oh I'm just like you I don't always pray about it sometimes we just do it and hope for the best lord help us he's right there to give us advice amen the greatest financial planning book in the world is right here amen I believe in people like Dave Xion and their what they're promoting my brother and sister but you know what if you need marriage counseling here's the book hey man you don't need something written by a psychologist that's been married three times amen you want to raise your kids you don't need to go out here and find some book that some guys written you don't even know if he's got the Holy Ghost when right here is the book on how to raise your children amen you will you have problems in your friendships right here's the book that has the answer to friendship amen you have a problem with anything right here is the key but the problem is we read it we read it like it was a self-help book and if we can't find the answer on page one we look on to we look on three we take the quiz on four we didn't get an answer still we go to five my brother and sister you got to read it saying Lord reveal this to me or it's still hid and I've read a few of them self-help books and some of them are just about that bad you got to buy addition two three four and five to get the answer and in the end they basically tell you well we just live in a bad time and your kids are gonna go nuts anyhow oh my brother insist nonsense we can raise children filled with the Holy Ghost they love the Lord amen because we got the book hallelujah compare this 20th century Church to the first century Church go ahead do that where is the power where is the love now my brother and sister what brother Brown was saying right here has lost many people to walk away from the message because they say well there's no love in the message but they themselves are absent of love you see once again they're taking a moral high ground to say well I see no love in you but yet they're not displaying love themselves see we got to be careful because as we examine our soul we have to realize my brother and sister for everything that we were judged we will be judged for amen so where is the power some people that say there's no power in the church but I tell you my brother and sister coming across through either messages or whatever there's testimonies coming from North America South America Africa Europe the Philippines Australia there is just miracle after miracle taking place and because we don't publish it on the headlines we don't have our own version of the PTL Club that we're publishing on television my brother and sister just because it's not coming out in that fashion but before you doesn't mean it's not happening so where is the power where is the love or this this is what really strikes me where is the purified church that withstood sin and walked with faith toward Jesus where is the unity you can't find it now my brother and sister sometimes we have faults senses of unity we can have special meetings that would be very broad and you'll have great groups of people I've experienced this in South America you can have great groups of people and you'll have all kinds of different ideologies ministries with different ideologies and they all come together and they sing and they shout and they yell amen and the meetings seem to go so beautifully but I tell you where the evidence is is what starts cropping up after the meetings are over and that's when certain people would come and say well you know brother so-and-so preached a good sermon but I disagree with this this and this and this one here said this and I don't agree with that my brother and sister you see we can have what we in the flesh think is a unity but we're looking for a unity in the body of Christ that starts at the soul level it doesn't start out here in the flesh level where we all agree that vanilla ice cream is what we want and we all want barbecued hamburgers and no onions and this and this and this that's not the unity we're talking about this is when a whole group of people can come and be connected to the Holy Ghost amen filled with the Holy Ghost inspired by the Holy Ghost led by the Holy Ghost and they have one thought in mind and they will come and yield themselves they're not causing that to all yield to them they are yielding to the leadership of the Holy Ghost and there is true unity because when you have sons and daughters of God my brother and sister God will bring them into unit hey men it won't be a man-made work we don't have to have a group we don't have to have some special thing happen to get people to come together my brother and sister that's unity of the flesh we're looking towards unity of the Spirit amen you can't find it if this church has all it needs why were they crying are these last lines here just strike me if this church meaning the First Church age has all its needs why were they crying out for more of God in the book of Acts and so they didn't have it all and yet they had far more than they have today see what we're looking to my brother and sister is to do the checkup the diagnostic now I might be getting ahead of myself I don't honestly at this moment remember what quotes I put in and what ones I chose to go ahead and leave out but my brother and sister you see we're coming to a time or coming to a place that were so close to the end of the world we're coming down the time is wrapping itself up anyone with any spiritual discernment' around the world it doesn't matter what you're talking the Catholics are all of the Lutheran's and Episcopalians whatever they're all acknowledging that they're seeing these signs coming but my brother and sister it's only a true examination of our soul we can look out here if we're students of the scripture we can look out here and say I see these signs of the time and I see this sign over here I see a sign over here but the sign we really want to look at is the sign of the condition of our soul amen that we are looking here not becoming we can be living good lives my brother and sister we can be living a life committed to serving God but if the fire is not there amen if the oil is not in the vessel it will matter what kind of life that we've lived right remember the foolish virgin amen brother branham's says you could not touch their life but when the moment came they recognized you see they didn't have to face the bridegroom I know you heard this many times but I just want you to once again ponder this the foolish virgin did not have to face the bridegroom and be told that she was short of oil at the moment of the cry behold the bridegroom cometh she knew now if she will know at that moment and we can set here his sons and daughters of God knowing that God wants us to examine our own life as we take communion amen let a man examine himself let's not wait until the cry behold the bridegroom cometh my brother and sister let's just check make sure is my soul ready amen is this the moment you know and actually I tell you what this might sound a little different to you I actually enjoy it you're probably all thinking what's his problem well I actually enjoy it because you see I'm not afraid to say I'm sorry I'm not afraid to repent and to weep before my lord Amen I actually enjoy this you know how some people have a bucket list they call it you know I want to go here I want to go there I want to travel to this country go to this place and slow but sure if they're fortunate they get to start checking things off their bucket list hallelujah well I believe the bride has a bucket list and that is today I was washed by the water of the word get up in the morning be able to say today I was washed by the water of the word and she just keeps to keep checking that off but the only way she knows my brother and sister is if she's looking to see that she's in that position amen so you look at that and I just hope that you would look at that quote again to realize we sometimes well okay you know we've got the message of restoration but we we're not my brother and sisters scot-free here we've got to keep stepping up to the mark we've got to keep pressing forward amen now in the sermon God's chosen place of worship brother Branham then says paragraph four he says and then father we pray that you'll visit us tonight in the word we come here for correction oftentimes we all this might sound just a very broad brushstroke but often times around the message people are really wanting to hear deep things things that stir them things that they they you know can really analyze and you know things that can say wow I never saw that before but here it is you know 1965 February 20th brother Browns preaching on God's chosen place of worship and he says we came here for correction he doesn't leave correction last maybe that was just a fluke we came here for correction for understanding there's revelation that we might know just how to live in this present day what to look forward to what to do see he's covering the whole spectrum he's not just saying we're here to dig into the deep mysteries that you will be able to to you know share something that no one else has seen no my brother and sister we're here for correction we're here for revelation we're here to know how to live in this present day and what to look forward to so our eyes are being open to what is in front of us amen and what to do amen so we're not a people that say hey God's gonna lift this up he's gonna do all this stuff but we don't know how to do it for we know the coming of the Lord is drawing nigh according to all the signs that the prophets foretold we're nearing the time Lord when complete deliverance will be giving to your children now that's something to look forward to my brother and sister complete deliverance amen not one evil spirit to hinder us amen not one thing in the flesh to hinder us that clean complete deliverance will be just one step right into the rapture amen God led us everyone be there father may there not be not be one missing that's our purpose of being here Lord we love you and we're trying to prepare for that hour see that's what we're here that's why we're in church my brother and sister that's why when you see people and I'm not criticizing anyone I don't agree but when you find people that think they can just go to as it were the backside of the mountain the backside of the desert and just listen to tapes and they're going to be just fine my brother and sister it's interesting I've talked to a few of these people that God's opened their eyes and and they changed their direction and one brother admitted to me one time he said the thing that caught my attention is he said I had narrowed the list of the tapes I wanted to listen to down to the ones that made me feel good the ones where the prophet of God spoke very direct spoke to the things that were in my life he said I found myself slow but sure not listening to them now look you do whatever you want to folks but I tell you if you're attending a church that's got a Holy Ghost filled pastor who loves you and cares for you and God speaks to him amen he's not gonna be on pre-record and you're not gonna tell him I want you to preach on this this Sunday because I want to feel good this Sunday he's gonna preach on what God lays in his heart and then you'll have to deal with it but you see if you don't want to deal with it well and save the pieces amen what you'll do is you'll just go home and start listening to the tapes that make you feel good and pretty soon you'll be a feel-good Christian that's not looking at the condition of the soul because the condition of the soul my brother and sister needs a washing of the water of the word and not according to you amen so God wants you to through the word Amen not from your rose-colored glasses but from the preaching of the word let it come forth with authority that then you sit on the Pew or however it might be and you were set there and say ouch that hurt but instead of saying I won't listen to that preacher what you're gonna do is then say Lord let me go back to the word let me find myself in the word and Lord correct me because I want to be right in your sight Lord no one else's sight not even my own sight I want to be right in your sight Lord so if I have to say ouch help me Lord forgive me Lord I'm gonna do it but I'll tell you my brother and sister is actually a lapse of character when people as Christians cliff claiming they have the Holy Ghost claim they filled revelation of the word for this hour and they take the easy way out my brother and sister that is a lapse on their part amen God didn't call us to take the easy way out he called us to take the correct way out amen now somebody might not like that and I'm sorry that you don't like that but it is the truth amen God wants you to sometimes just say okay I don't like what the preacher preaches I don't like how he's doing that but if God led you to that church maybe you ought to just kind of listen to the Lord after a while and say well if God led me here there must have been a purpose or we'll take the easy way out we'll find a new church that doesn't preach the things that rub us wrong amen because sometimes the things that rub you wrong you say well I don't like what they're preaching Amen well that's good my brother and sister if you don't like what they're preaching go back to the word and if it lines up with the words say Amen to it if it don't line up the word you're obligated to come and say look this isn't the message where do you preach it amen so just because it rubs you wrong doesn't mean that's a reason to reject it maybe you need to embrace it amen sometimes my brother and sister will see that God comes down in very peculiar ways amen and he also comes in very particular ways to cause us amen to shift course amen I'll tell you what it's there you know just like the little story now pardon me for using the humor like this but one time there was a captain of a very large ship and he gets on the radio and he says hey you know ship or light in front of me give way to the starboard or whatever you know right or left and then he goes a little further and it hasn't changed and he gets on the radio again and he says hey you know light in front of me you know move to the right or left and finally a voice comes in response to his deal and he says sir I recommend that you move to the right or to the left and the captain says I'm the captain of the such-and-such ship and the man comes back on the radio and says and I'm the up keeper of the lighthouse amen my brother and sisters sometimes God wants to let us amen be forced to move out of our position in spite of what we think or what we want or how we see it God is going to move us my brother and sister I'm assuming the captain of that large ship decided he was going to move to the right or to the left amen so if God's trying to do that amen going back into this last quote that that's the purpose of our being here Lord we love you and we're trying to prepare for that hour amen the second afflicted that's in the building we pray that you will heal them Lord especially them with spiritual needs and I would say at any time my brother and sister that if we have the option we have the ability to have God do something in our life I just encourage you to take the spiritual need over the physical need amen always choose that and that is uplifting to the soul I would rather go to meet the Lord with physical affliction and not spiritual afflictions amen hallelujah we pray that you'll save every lost soul fill every believer with the Holy Ghost and renew this strength and the power in your believing children amen Oh grant these things father I like this last line here grant these things father we ask much you told us to ask ask abundance ask for great things many of them oh my brother and sister I don't know I'm just saying this to encourage to stir your minds in but when was the last time you asked the Lord just to pour his spirit out on you to the point that you didn't even know who you were what you were doing when was the last time we asked the Lord to just pour the abundance of his word upon our life that we would just say I feel a Liberty but you know what happens my brother and sister if we're not careful I've done it myself many times we getting into the rut amen brother Chris here again that service touched me profoundly instead of coming and thanking the Lord for the things we haven't even seen manifested yet we come with a list Lord you need to this and Lord you need to that and Lord you need to my brother and sister how many times as a child I remember my dad used to haul the milk to town in the metal cans and and you know my dad had had his peculiar way of raising a child and and so you know we would we would want to go with dad to come to the creamery because you had to deliver your own cans at that time and as a little kid we would back up to the deal there and and then you had to tell the man that you were there and you filled out this little card and you hung it on a clip and that clip was on a chain and it went inside and then you started putting your cans on on the chain and they went inside the creamery and they used just set there for a few minutes and then your cans came out empty and washed and you put them back on your truck and for our help our dad would stop on the way home and a little ice cream a hamburger place there in the edge of Caldwell and he would buy an ice cream cone that was our pay for helping and as a small child my brother and sister that was better than money amen and the man the man and woman who owned that little ice cream shop amen you know they would see us coming we were regulars I guess you would say and they would always look at my dad and and say however many of us kids was with him you know 1 2 3 small ice cream cones and my dad would say yep that's what we can afford and those small ice cream cones came out of that little hand out window Oh brother and sister there was nothing small about them but you see there was something going on there an encouragement and we look at the life that we are living here in the things that is happening in the world around us my brother and sister we are not sons and daughters of God to sit here and wait for a handout we are here to look at our own soul and ask and ask an abundance Lord deal with this issue in my life now my brother and sister one of the first things they say about realizing you you have to speak addictions or issues is for you to be able to confess that and what we should be saying my brother so you say we're brother Paul why are you saying this we're we're good godly people that's right my brother and sister and we want to stay that way so what we're gonna do is just make sure that Satan has no open door that Satan has no voice that Satan has no rights to come in no rights to dictate no rights to gloat or to boast and so what we're gonna do is every single day we're gonna say Lord is there something in my life Lord if there is reveal it to me and I will go before you and I will correct that now my brother and sisters some people think that's not necessary if you think I'm overkill on that that's fine but I'll tell you I have Amen some support in this scripture for that thought and so we'll just move along and see if we can't get there amen also in God's chosen place of worship brother Branham says here you know you used to have an old colored friend he said to me he said brother Billy he said I don't want any trouble at the river he said I want to have my ticket in my hand and when the whistle blows I don't want any trouble there I asked the Lord a long time ago if there's anything wrong let me set it up right now can we relate to this old color brother Lord let me settle it up right now don't let it go till tomorrow no let it linger till next week or tell some brother would come and preach just a uh you know a barnburner sermon that would just force me out of my seat to the altar no my brother and sister take care of your business at home amen your altar is with you you don't have to wait until it becomes some kind of great thing that's blown up in your life is that I asked the Lord a long time ago amen if there's anything wrong let me settle up right now cuz it'll be dark and stormy on that morning when the ship pulls out for the other side said I don't want any interference I want to take care of all it all of it now that's what we're here for trying to take care of all the interferences so that we can on walk on board on that hour Amen hallelujah I hope you're catching my point tonight Amen just an encouragement Saints that we would just stop sometime in each and every day and just say Lord forgive me if I have stepped over the line and whatever is happened Lord just forgive me and Lord show me so I want to make it right I want to settle this up so whatever time hey men I tell you my brother and sister is starting to scare me because kids I went to school with wait they're not kids they're old people now you know like they said about this virus you know when they're saying well we got to be careful protect the old people and then you wait wake up I am the old people my brother and sister you see what we want to do is just make sure as I said people I went to school with they're burying them right and left it's kind of scary amen calls us to realize there's no assurance we might not even have tomorrow to make it right but we've got today and we've got right now and I could take you to another sermon I was listening to today also and brother Branham says those of you come into the altar we thank the Lord we praise the Lord for all of you come into the altar and we'll stay here just as long as it takes for everyone that God moves upon to come oh my would we have that kind of patients in church anymore to give the people the opportunity to get their lives right well hallelujah amen my brother and sister I think we need to start taking church just a tad bit more serious but wait that's just an opinion Hebrews six and seventeen says we're in God willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath the heirs of the promise confirmed it that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie that we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge see there's the key word the activator my brother and sister if we haven't fled for refuge then we cannot claim this Amen we can't have a consolation we can't claim this position if we haven't bothered to run into the refuge amen but those who have fled for refuge lay hold on the upon the hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast which in Earth into that within the veil you see we're not anchored my brother and sister the real message believer would that be offensive to people I wonder the real message believer is not anchored on this side of the veil the real message believer is anchored on the other side of the veil amen anchored in that position in Jesus Christ amen anchored as the anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which in Earth into that within the veil amen on the other side of the veil whither the forerunner is for us interred amen who's the forerunner Jesus Christ he he has entered behind the veil amen and was made high priest forever after the order of melchizedek Oh hallelujah my brother and sister we said here tonight and my encouragement is just stop every day I'm not trying to say that something's wrong I'm just encouraging you to each day stop and make sure everything is right we want to be able to stand and someone say is it well with your soul we don't want to stop and say well I need I need now what we want to do is someone says is it well with your soul to be able to say it as well with my soul it is well Shalom amen that's the position we want to live in Saints not day by day under some wall a shadow cloud of condemnation amen but to just put these things under the blood day by day just let the water invite the water of the word to wash us and and leave us to a place that at no matter what time or place amen right on the highway there farm way and you stick this morning someone lost their life in an auto accident I don't believe my brother and sister that they got up this morning with any idea that this would be their last day on earth hallelujah now we don't say that for the fear factor it's just we want to be ready hey man we want to be able to sit there and say you know what praise the Lord if today is my last day if I go to bed tonight and I don't wake up in the morning I want to have that assurance that everything is good everything is done I've got the ticket and when the boat pulls away from the dock there'll be no interference hallelujah Oh sister Amy would you come Oh hallelujah maybe this sounds like a strange way to encourage you but my brother and sister be encouraged all we got to do is each and every day look at the soul examine it ask the Lord father Lord Jesus if there is something in my life show me show me don't let it be hidden don't let it be be camouflage don't let Satan camouflage it hallelujah hallelujah the name of the Lord is a strong tower oh god bless you Saints tonight just a little encouragement every day don't let our lives become so busy amen don't let your life become so busy that you you just fail say well I'm so busy I'm so tired brother Paul I don't have time my work and life and whatever is consuming me oh my brother and sister I want you to understand this is not something that you have to labor under what you have to do is take the time to do it morning noon or night maybe morning noon and night Lord prepare me I want to be your sanctuary I wanted my life to be just an open clean slate then I can present it to you Lord without fear without apprehension then I can just freely come my brother and sister that's what makes Christian life a life of liberty when there's no baggage no luggage being drugged behind us that we are simply free Oh hallelujah the name of the Lord a strong tower the righteous run into and they all say in the name of the Lord a strong tower the righteous run into an a or say Oh blessed be the name of the Lord Oh blessed be the name of the law Oh blessed be the name of the Lord gold star Oh blessed be the name of the Lord Oh

my lord Oh blessed be the name of my lord most ha Lord we bless your name tonight Lord we thank you Father Lord for you just coming you're encouraging us Lord just to look in that vessel Lord make sure it's full of oil Lord just to put out that effort to pull Lord the globe off of our lamp amen to clean it to trim the wick Oh Lord thank you Father for that unction thank you Lord for something that is driving us to examine our own life by the word and to be able to say Lord forgive me I need more of you father I want more of your Holy Spirit amen that auction that drives their true believer amen to look in the mirror of the word old father Lord just to think Lord that type that shadow how the priest had to walk in before you perfectly Lord Oh father we're here not by our own flesh not by our own ability but lord I thank you that the word is looking us over from top to bottom from right to left Lord round and around and around the word is looking us over and it's washing every little smudge away Oh God I learned heard the prophet of God say today father that Lord you would have a church that would with me without spot or wrinkle Oh Lord I am that church tonight and Lord just keep washing me father until there's not a spot Lord until there's not a wrinkle Lord just keep it working on me Lord until I stand before your perfect Oh God we thank you Father let us never be tired Lord of examining our life with the Word of God Oh Lord let us never come to a place we say we've got enough of the word Lord that we've heard enough of the preaching of the word but Lord let our hearts hunger Lord let our hearts hunger to be examined by the word to be washed by the word Oh father I thank you Lord my heart is overflowing tonight Lord that you have granted offs the least of all people

Lord for you to come into our presence that we could stand in your presence you are the word and Lord we want to be in your presence we want your Holy Spirit to surround us speak to us Lord little love songs nor little bits of lore love notes as it were father that would just encourage us to draw close to you encourages father to put the things of the world behind us and come closer into your

beyond that I'm just asking you Father for an outpouring Lord in our lives and outpouring of your word Lord may we look at our lives examine them closely father Oh Lord Jesus I often been reminded
