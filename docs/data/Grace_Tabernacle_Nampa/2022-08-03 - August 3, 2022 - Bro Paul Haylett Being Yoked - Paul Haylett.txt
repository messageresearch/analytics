our soul and you know some days you just have that kind of day but i would just ask you tonight that the lord raises a standard for you today amen he's faithful he's true he's present amen and i'm thankful you know sometimes you just have little things that happen and then you realize that the direction you were all worried about it going that god raised a standard right up and just changed it all and i say thank you tonight amen god bless each and every one of you amen sister sophie i had a lovely conversation with brother manasseh today thank you amen that was good hallelujah well it's just good to be here tonight and i want to speak to you on our continuing overall thought thank you beautiful music those songs actually touch very close to my thoughts today and i really appreciate the lord's anointing or leadership there amen we want to remember communion this coming sunday at five o'clock so i want to speak to you on present circumstance and and i see this as a bigger topic than i originally started into so i just simply named it being yoked i had a more specific title but realized there there is more scripture to that and and the part we're going to touch tonight is is uh beautiful but um you know there's there's another part of it right because the reality of it is is we're all going to be yoked to something and uh so we don't go through life unyoked and and uh we look at that and oftentimes take the scripture which we'll touch maybe lord willing in a future time but to be unequally yoked we look at that and oftentimes we we look at that but my brother and sister i would like to just uh put this out right now it's not you as it were in business with the wrong person it's not you married to the wrong person it's not you uh traveling doing living blah blah blah with the wrong person but my brother and sister to be unequally yoked would be us also as believers binding ourselves to things that are ungodly binding ourselves to things that don't edify right the scripture says to not even have the appearance of evil so we can find how satan would bind us sometimes because we would find ourselves yoked in something that an outsider as it were another brother another christian someone you've witnessed to would look at that and go that don't look good i don't look good and that's why the scripture calls on us to guard our testimony is a valuable it's a valuable price amen let's just stand this evening and um go into uh the scripture into galatians and we have a couple different scriptures out of galatians tonight but just to kind of take the root of what it is that we're speaking about um so this is paul speaking to the galatians and and he says then in the second chapter verse 1. he says then 14 years after i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas and took titus with me also and i went up by revelation now i have to admit saints i never ever caught this ever ever before in my life i've read this scripture many times he went up by revelation you know you know what happened when he went up by revelation he knew he knew what god was going to do he wasn't going up there surmising he wasn't hoping by revelation he knew you know i've always marveled about rahab there's all kinds of schemes that wicked minds have put but you see that's an anointing of the devil to try to insert the spirit of the day and the devil's thinking back into the word of god but i've often thought before how is it in a city of that size two spies come and go right to the very one that had a fear which we would recognize as reverence for the things of god right revelation revelation revealing that when she saw them she knew who they were people say well maybe they didn't quite get their clothing right maybe they didn't this right maybe they didn't that right but it's revelation it's revelation that brings us to those things and i went up by revelation and communicated unto them that gospel which i preach among the gentiles but privately to them which were of refutation lest by any means i should run or had run in vain but neither titus who was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised and that because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage to whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour isn't that beautiful we'll touch on a a little thought on that in just a bit no not for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with you look at this that means the gospel was already traveling with us if it's going to continue we already have the gospel of jesus christ amen we are moving forward amen thank you father lord we just ask for your help tonight just to express these things bubbling in our heart father that lord it could be just made alive to us lord and help us as we press to the mark of the high calling we ask this lord in every need lord prayer request that we might have forgotten those who are not able to be in the house of god tonight lord touch each one we pray in your name amen you may be seated hallelujah amen so here he's sharing that he is actually returning by revelation and so it's there my brother and sister not to say when he visited them previously there was not revelation but now he's coming with something that god has revealed to him right that is the revelation is a revelation of jesus christ it is the revelation of of our lord in our life it's a revelation of his word being made known to us and and you know revelation is interesting because through the years we might have key components but never put them together and then one day we pick up our bible and all of a sudden a passage of scripture suddenly takes on a new light to us and becomes so real to us in that context that we realize we've read over this can we say amen to that we've read over it for years but then it's by revelation and we could in an intellectual way say oh i finally caught that but it's actually god reveals that to us it's not just something that we just come and read in just the correct way or the right attitude or just in such a fashion or otherwise we would then by scholarly learning the prophet of god talks about that we don't just as teach one thing upon another until suddenly we have revelation it's the lord opening these things and i just recently had a situation as i was visiting with an individual and we got to talking about a certain scripture and i said and they said well i never did understand that scripture and you know you never want to come across arrogant because god has given that to us so you can't boast of the gift that god has given right we boast on christ not upon ourselves and so then you know it was interesting because i remember i just had this little spark of enthusiasm hit me because i was like i can and tie it together with the word of god explain that scripture to you and they're like wow you're excited about that and i'm like yes i am excited about that because it's been made real we're not just reading this same individual was saying about how that they'd fallen behind on reading the bible in a year and i i said just scrap that forget that nowhere in the scripture does it say you've got to read my word in its entirety every year what god wants us to do is read the word by revelation so that when we read the passage or the page or the verse or whatever it might be that it actually speaks to us now that's kind of like having a conversation and this happens in life you're in the house you're busy the wife goes one direction you're kind of going another but you're in a conversation and you realize then you've ventured into another room and you can hear them talking but you don't understand what they're saying we don't want that kind of relationship with the lord we've ventured into another room and we we don't understand what he's saying but we know he's speaking but we don't hear we don't comprehend we want revelation amen so as he goes here to the galatians he's telling them you know what i'm preaching the same gospel to them that i preached to the jews i'm preaching to the gentiles and so i don't have a two standard see this is a problem we have in the world today many of these religions believe they have a standard that they need to convert the jew to no my brother and sister when god ordains revelation the jews eyes will open but it's not here for us to teach them a new gospel because when we come with another gospel it leaves a question which one's right god has one word his original spoken word amen so he tells them i'm preaching this same gospel to them and i'm not doing it in respect of men in other words i didn't find just the right men to to preach this to in the sense of these men are are more respectable or they will be such but he says here i think i love this actually i think he said i went to them that were of reputation my brother and sister he didn't go to the religious scoundrel he didn't go to the guy that professed one thing and went out the next day and lived another he didn't profess or preach this gospel to the one who as it were would toss it aside and pick it up again at convenience but he was there speaking and when we're talking of a reputation he wasn't going down to the the uh the the courtyard and finding the men that everybody spoke of but he was talking in a spiritual context to men and women who loved the word of god men and women who wanted to serve god and desired more of him there's a reputation we want not to be known as a great man in the city as a great businessman as a great authority or even of wisdom but to be known amongst the community as a man of god that stands on the word and won't deviate from that word so he was looking for a different kind of reputation than the world wants the world wants amen well i don't want to get sidetracked here but the brother branham says the churches want the movers and the shakers we want those that are moving all right but not the shakers we don't need the shakers we don't need that in fact the prophet of god told us when the mayor starts going to your church you've got to be careful right kind of a pinnacle of political coming into a church you have to wonder can they really do what they do and be comfortable hearing the word of god preached so he says you know what look now we have to understand saints has it come in this time that that we look in the day that we live in now and we say it's too bad there's there's all kinds of little confrontations as it were and disputings and different opinions and all of this stuff but realize this has been going on forever this is not a 21st century it's not a message issue it is an issue amongst humanity and so it is here that as he is going to them and he's preaching to them and he's preaching the same gospel he's preaching it to reliable or solid people and he says you know what i don't want to should run or had run in vain we don't want to do this we're not here tonight having church just to have church right we're not here just because well this is what we do we're message believers we're supposed to go to church we're here tonight because we're looking for something that makes a difference we're looking for something that is strengthening us coming right down it's not an outside anointing although we feel it on the outside but i want this gospel to sink to the very morrow of my bones i wanted to sink down to the very core of the life of who i am so we are not running in vain amen this scripture says hey what does hinder you well brother david touched that on sunday usually what hinders us is us we can blame it on a lot of different people but really when it comes down to it then whatever they did will only impact you if you led it so we open the gate for our trojan horse and then wonder why we feel defeated when it's all over amen you see when i was growing up there was like give it the word test but their version of a word test just almost everybody failed it except for the chosen but you see my brother and sister the word test is actually the mirror of the word it's not me see this is interesting i i hope that you catch this the word test is not me taking the word down and holding it to you to test you but really honestly truly the word test is for me myself to look in the word and say where am i just had an interesting conversation with a young sister in the message just going through a kind of a hard spot in her life and and uh reached out and we're doing and you know my brother and sister it it struck me as as the lord just led what we was speaking to her uh you know it's each one of us is responsibility to give it the word test each one of us we say well do we have an answer i want to ask you this question you can say yes or no or however you nod your head or whatever but do we have the answer for the spirit of laodicea absolutely we do there should be no i don't know i might we have the answer we have met satan's challenge by the word and we have the answer for the questions of our day so just as it is as any student now i'm assuming every one of us went to school at some form and in other words i'm admitting i'm probably the least educated here but to do well on the test you had to study you had to dig in right now some people are so intelligent they just absorb it and can regurgitate it but some of us had to pound it i remember in history years ago i had a teacher that was just a very good teacher in one synth but you know way too focused on dates it's like okay what happened on blah blah date and i'm like i don't know but that was like 222 years ago and i don't know that whatever happened on that day really is going to matter to me today because i'm sitting in history being asked a question i have no answer for but the answer is available and that teacher was unrelenting it was in the book if you had done your duty you would know the answer are you with me tonight and so we have no excuse because the answers are in the book amen the answer to satan's question is in the book amen so we look at this he preached not as a respecter of men but he was preaching the same gospel the same jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and as he was what was he doing he was preaching in a way that shed the true light of the gospel to the galatians and so as we look through history we recognize that there in galatia there was many men that were saying well you know if you're going to receive this uh you need to be circumcised you can't be saved unless you're circumcised so you have to come and conform and and it was a doctrine i mean think about the churches in the world today uh what we would call our world my brother and sister there's people there's message churches that you are not supposed to come to church unless you have a white shirt and a black tie i don't know where they got the they got that it could be maybe they come out of mormonism i don't know but there's that's something they place in there and churches that have this little thing we don't want to waste time on that but this little thing and you need to conform or churches that are all we have a great man in our midst and so we're all going to look to this man and you need to kind of give submission as it were subjugation to this man because he's one with revelation but that's not what the gospel says we have one that we raise up and that is our lord jesus christ and revelation flows from him into the body severally it's not at one channel but god sharing it as a licks of fire coming down in the upper room it wasn't a great bolt of lightning that just struck and and those that were close to it got more than the other that holy spirit amen and i say that holy spirit speaking in the context of in the past tense that holy spirit moved in the midst of those people and when they walked out of there they had the holy ghost not a fraction not a judgment you've got 62 percent you've got 78 percent but they received the baptism of the holy ghost and we're not here today to try to determine as it would be that god's going to give this much to this one and this much to this one everyone that diligently seeks the word of god and his presence the holy spirit will receive the baptism of the holy ghost it is not a partial it's not a deal if we diligently see now the issue coming back are we digging in the book are we finding the answer for laodicea are we finding the answer for the 21st century so you see it's there he preached in such a way that it shed the true light of the gospel but men were coming in there and and bringing divisions trying to separate the galatians and you know it was the great debate of circumcision or not and to put in a context hope this is not offensive to anyone to bring it to our day it might be the great debate of the seals open or not divides churches divides family divides friendships and that's what was happening the same spirit of division was there in galatia at that time trying to separate the people and some say well you know it's because of this and some they preach too hard and they preach too lenient but we don't like the preacher in the middle either so it's there that they they're trying to find their place and sometimes you'll notice i've been there i've witnessed this that you'll be in certain parts of the world and they have a very present revelation you've got to believe this you've got to see this like this and you know it's interesting and to say the least in the flesh knowing that sometimes their great revelation is something that god's revealed as it were to us as a body a year two five ago and now they've just made it the latest greatest revelation and you know it's just hard to to get too excited about that because they're trying to put something to you that you need to now this is the point i'm really trying to make you need to tell them they want to hear you acknowledge but what if your acknowledgement is yes they've been preaching that for several years now they don't like that circumcised in the flesh if you're going to get saved by this gospel of jesus christ you've got to be circumcised in the flesh what a doctrine but i'll tell you where they missed it we have to be circumcised in the spirit there's where the circumcision takes place is not in the physical realm but it takes place in the spiritual realm and they had missed that key element and so they were trying to enforce the gospel on the flesh i hope you catch this tonight and we're not here to enforce the gospel on the flesh we're here tonight to enforce the gospel as it were on the spirit man we're here tonight not to try and make the flesh man some perfect image of something the word says the flesh man will fail and god did not even save our flesh hallelujah you promised us a whole new body on the other side we're not taking some reformed or reformation of the body my brother and sister but the spirit that's being molded in you and i the character of the gospel of jesus christ is what we will take with us that is who we are and i say thank you lord man i'm not here tonight to circumcise my flesh just as i made statements to you before we can preach against sin sin sin sin but if we'll get the holy ghost within the sin will have to leave and if we are beating against the sin we are just fighting against the tide of the day we live in but you ever get from now a hundred i don't know maybe we don't put a limit 150 down to two or whatever it might be you get the holy ghost in there and you won't have to worry about the effect of laodicea but you see we can beat against don't do this and don't do this and don't do this and it will still happen that's the day we're living in i could share some very interesting things that a brother just shared with me maybe i'll just give you a glimpse of that uh in another continent a youth camp and the minister that was preaching there wanted to just kind of get a feeling for for uh what was happening there what was the the situation of the young people in that camp and he put out a little anonymous as it were would that be right anyway a little questionnaire that no identification no names nobody knows who wrote what and he was they were stunned i won't go into it tonight but they were stunned but what these children these young people admitted was happening in their life they were stunned they weren't just like oh that's too bad i'm talking about they read this and they were shocked of what the young people were dealing with do we preach to those young people and tell them how terrible they are or do we remind them this is satan this is what he does this is how he does it doesn't sound very spiritual is it when we come back and start as it were putting up the whole platform to show this is satan now i want to put this in this context a little ahead of my notes here but i loved what brother david said on sunday and that sometimes he didn't just put it to like you bad people or you whatever but sometimes we go a certain way and we've already turned to go that way i don't remember the exact words that you put that in brother david but we turn and we start to go that way and then we recognize that's the devil and we have to turn and then flee from that see we're not exempt as though we're so spiritual to never be tricked by the devil but there's something in common with the believer and that is that they are not no not for an hour going to be in subjection to that not for a season will they be in subjection we flee back to the one who is our refuge amen can someone say a real hearty amen to that that's what god does but you see satan comes and tries to make a young people or old people or whatever feel like they're just nothing because they actually turned and took a step in that direction you remember when brother david did that i don't know if he even remembers exactly what it was but i like how he actually acted that out he took that out of there and these things and you step into that and then you're shocked that's the devil we don't hunker down negotiate we don't say let's let's come up with an excuse of why i did i'm not talking about excuse to make us look good but an excuse to kind of circumvent the emotions which usually is condemnation to deal with this but you see that's not neither titus who is with me being greek you see paul preached this in such a fashion saints paul preached it in such a fashion the titus catching the revelation also says me a greek i do not need to go get circumcised this gospel is not about the flesh this gospel is about christ like the nature of god the image of god the life of god there's the difference my brother and sister you see so then it's not by the church or by certain preachers but by the gospel amen so you know these these uh false brethren brought in they come and and i just was struck in my heart they come to spy out now do you read those words with me can someone read or tell me what the possessive of that sentence is our liberty it's not someone else's liberty you see god even transferred it as a liberty from him and he's already given to the people and now they can take possession of it and say this is my liberty amen can you say that tonight that we have come into the word god has dealt in our lives we have been filled with his spirit he has given us victory we can live victorious lives and we do that and so this is no longer just some words on a page but this is my liberty it's our liberty my brother and sister that the devil is stealing it's one thing to look in it and i've done this before and wished i'd have done something different jerry and i went to a restaurant and and as we were walking out this young man went by all of their silverware with the napkin rolled up around it cloth napkin no less and the kid just pockets i don't know one or two of them and walks out and i look back after the fact and i said you know what i should have called that kid out but you know what i did at the moment right there i just had a lovely evening with my wife it's like i'm not going to spoil my evening it's not my knife and fork and it's not going to break them that apathetic reaction is how satan comes in and steals our liberty so he got jay's liberty it's not my liberty they'll recover no my brother and sister it's our liberty that is in a plural sense and it's possessive so it's our liberty that we're fighting for see and they're coming to spy out our liberty which we have not in ourselves not in our church but in christ jesus and their whole purpose amen just listening to a brother minister and and i might just preach on this i told jerry i'm going to plagiarize some of that that's good i'm not going to tell you who it is so you can't spy out my plagiarism but he said every time the devil comes he has an agenda he doesn't come just to torment you he doesn't come just to annoy you he has an agenda and every preacher of the gospel that stands behind a pulpit has an agenda too and we don't need to hide it it isn't like we need to keep this the wording had somebody one time say uh you know um boy i don't know i was really excited brother paul that you used the word uh manipulation or manipulator that just doesn't sound good and i said well it sounds good or not it's their truth go back to the definition find the definition and i'm telling you every preacher of this gospel is a manipulator trying to put people into a position they don't even know they want to be in but how close is it to turn into causing you to do something that is harmful that you don't want to see how close prophet of god said those two spirits would be so close they deceived the very elect if it was possible and i speak this boldly and i speak this openly that as it were not in the context we normally think of like manipulator but i'm telling my brother and sister if i could put every one of us in the rapture right now i would do it but god's got a better plan he doesn't have paul's plan he's got a better plan he doesn't need paul to try and do the work so what do we do yes we as preachers kind of tend to manipulate things otherwise we would just randomly throw out quotes and scriptures and thoughts and ideas but what do we do we try to lead that down a path pointing to a conclusion can we say amen to that it makes sense amen that we don't just throw out random you know let's turn to john 1. let's go to revelation 13. let's go to you know this and here and go down there and this stuff that's not even connected we have a plan we're we're moving in a coordinated fashion pointing to an end result and so it's there you see it was there that that he's preaching to them in such a fashion that titus being a fellow brother is not even moved on by some kind of guilt or shame or whatever insecurity to be circumcised because he knows what it is and that's how we should and we do our best to preach the gospel that they come in to spy out our liberty and the devil my brother and sister the prophet of god said the devil knows you better than you know yourself what's he doing he's spying out your life to come and try to set something in your path a stone of stumbling to set something in your path that shakes your world and your focus then comes on to this stone of stumbling it comes on to a circumstance it comes on to a relationship as it were a friendship or whatever it might be or something with more friction and and we focus on that and we're not focused on christ he don't care about those other things he's coming to steal our liberty he's coming to rob us from our focus on jesus christ amen so there's where our liberty is that they can bring us into bondage my my brother and sister i mean look what's going on in the world around us venezuela i know many brothers from there it all started so good never pay another doctor bill we're going to do this for you we're going to do that for you now even right down to the believers rejoice and thank god for just a little tube of toothpaste and when grocery stores open in the morning what is on the shelf will be gone in less time than it takes the next 25 people to make it through the door see how clever satan is but look at the world we're living in right now dual-fold meaning of the scripture the scripture tells us we're coming into a season of famine and we'll look right now that they're they're now declaring more and more it's definitely in the farm world it's being it's being spoken that in the present state of conditions in the direction things are going we are going to have a global food storage a shortage i mean a global food shortage but what the prophet come along and say it's not going to be about natural food it's going to be about spiritual food so what happens god allows the parallel my brother and sister we can fill our pantry we can fill the basement we can fill the attic we can do all of that thing but if we are starving to death if our spiritual relationship has been stolen from us and we are now in bondage to a system that has fear it has anger it has bitterness has all of these things what has he done he doesn't have to take the face away from you you can still say i'm a christian he's not going to take that away from you i've just been studying satan's eden and it's just this just knocking my socks off because it's there that you look at this and what is happening today is so clearly mapped out right there in that message it is powerful my brother and sister and you look at this and realize that what have they done they've spied out the liberty and people are in bondage and don't even know it imagine we in america the land of the free are some of the most bound people on the face of the earth we're bound in our materialism we're bound in our religious spirits we're bound in so many things i don't need to explain all of that to you tonight amen so what are they doing they're trying to take our liberty which we have that means it is past tense it is possessive we have the liberty my brother and sister come on somebody lift a hand and say i have liberty and the devil is here tonight to steal that from you he's here tonight by the thinking of our own mind and we could say well i see it like this and i see it like this i say let's pray in this fashion lord let thy will be my will and my will be thy will otherwise we come into a place that it's like well it has to be this and it has to be this forget about what you're thinking and come back in that position and say lord one of my greatest desires in life is that my will and thy will are perfectly meshed together now when we see it we don't see two separate entities we don't see two different trains of thought that merge here and merge there but have places of separation but we come because we have if we was to wipe out all of the rest of this in front of this my brother and sister you could easily in those sentences come to the conclusion that we already have liberty that has already been granted to us as sons and daughters of god and now our job is not to find liberty you say brother paul i've been down trodden i've been beaten on stop the prophet of god said how do you know that god wants to heal you because he said so how do you know god wants to give you the holy ghost because he said so how do you know that god wants you to have a life full of joy and happiness because he said so and i'm not talking about frivolous type joy and happiness i'm talking about that security down in the soul that just makes us as humans happy to know my lord loves me he has saved me i'm written in the lamb's book of life it's his own blood he poured over me amen that kind of a joy and happiness but you see that's already been given to us it's time for us to defend it time for us to take a hold of what god has already given he promised if we'd be baptized now it's not some simple formula some people say well i was baptized and i this and then i should have the holy ghost i just claim i got it my brother and sister god requires our contribution now see some people say no no we don't have yes we do you have to make sure you don't just get baptized you've got to repent amen and you can do all the repentant you want if you don't get baptized or if your baptism is twisted you see what i'm saying god has a requirement on our part amen otherwise you know the world and that's one of the traps that satan has given to them they all just say well i believe therefore i have no there's there's a we're not works my brother and sister but there is a portion that god wants us to take and much of that that's not very good english is it most of that there's the right words comes by us submitting to the word you know he said understand it all and thou shalt be saved no see it's not that way so you see it's telling us and and you know if we have struggles and this was very helpful to me today really spoke to my heart to whom we gave place by subjection no if we could by paul's way of doing english and paul writing notes there would be i'm real fond if any of you i ever text any of you you'll see this i'm really fun forget about all that formal dot dot dot works really good and the more emphasis you want just put more dots you really want to emphasize something just do a whole line full of dots but you see to whom we gave a place by subjection this could have about 50 dots no i'm not going to yield to the devil no i'm not going to let those thoughts come down and rest in my mind no i'm not going to take this satan's opinion i was asked to take a little poll today you know how good did we do you know if you can't do it honestly just don't do it i started doing their poll and i was like you guys have the worst service on the face of the earth i finally just deleted the whole poll because it's like i'm sorry i just can't do this but you see we're not called to yield to the devil not for an hour i'm telling you we see people that have bitterness and they have to stop and think how long they go i was dealing with a this has been back quite a few years not even in our church in a whole nother church somebody come up to the altar in a service they said i have a spirit of bitterness and i just asked him how long have you been carrying this they named a date and i was like okay i think 16 years is too long but what happens something reinforces it they don't like me and you go to church and someone's mind is so preoccupied they walk by there's the proof and the root keeps growing yeah so what does it do we're not gonna saints we're not even gonna give an hour that hurt what they said hurt in an hour okay if i could just bind you as it were to this in an hour you before that hour's up you're gonna stop and say lord forgive them and forgive me if they meant it lord forgive them anyhow and lord forgive me for taking offense because i'm not going to let the hour pass by i'm not going to let it take root in my life i believe as the last year brother jason farmed with us we had a tremendous rainstorm and it washed a big rut down through a field i mean a big rut so we took a groundhog doesn't matter what that is it's just a groundhog and we went out there and we went over and over and over and over on that spot until we filled in that big rut and that wash and we got it all smoothed in and you could see all of our sweeps and our turns around but you know what taught me a lesson was when the corn came up everywhere we had worked that soil at that late moment there was no weeds so it told me that even while it looked like bare dirt in our life can you just bear with me on this where it looked like bare dirt i'm not offended the seed was taking root and when we come through with the groundhog we disturbed all of that soil and so everywhere we fixed that rut was absolutely the cleanest place in the whole field the whole season god come and let the word just run over us let the words sweep around and around and around and stir our lives and stir us up and maybe sometimes hard preaching we we kind of push back against that that was hard but let it come and work the soil of our soul than any kind of root of bitterness and anything in us would be tore up and disturbed and you couldn't see a single one of those weeds but the proof was that they were there i'm not offended if that's so it won't come back are you with me it won't come back so look at this because these false brethren they came in unawares to bring us back into bondage my brother and sister i want to put it this way this is just something that that had just spoke to my heart when i was studying this what would bondage be for you and i are we going to go back and be catholics i'm not speaking ill of anybody but you know that little church out yonder that we've kind of made claim on in the country that's got the nice lawn out there you know all by itself we're driving to church tonight sister jerry and i some comment between us and she looked it up and you know what that church is it's catholic by another name they have the same tenants the same ritual the same tradition and on their website they declare all of that it even has the word catholic in their website now what kind of seed is that going to produce a catholic by another name because that is the seed oh my brother and sister let us not take the name of the message and produce another seed let us take the name of the message and produce the seed that this message was and that was jesus christ let it produce what it's supposed to produce amen that the truth of the gospel might continue with you hallelujah now look at this just want to say here uh i touched on this already of what i was just really i had this wrote down uh uh you know we can step into something and realize the devil's in it don't just go ahead and say well i started i guess i'll finish no flee from that the scripture says flee from the very appearance of evil flee from anything that when when the devil says aha i got you then start repenting you'll break the power of satan right there no matter what it is you say well i already oh i already fell repent it'll break the power of satan right there in that moment he become powerless in your life on that amen don't give not even for an hour amen so look at this this gospel right we know it i'm not preaching nothing new it's continuing in the bride of christ we are the continuation of the book of acts and i believe if we could ever truly catch that revelation saints that it would take a lot of trouble out of our life i am the product of an upper room experience you say brother paul you've never been in that upper room no god gave me my own upper room amen that's how much god loves us in the day that we're living in he gave us our own upper room he gave us our own backside of the desert he gave us our own closet he gave us however you want to word it he gave us our own place to have that personal experience and so i don't need to travel through time back to an upper room because i have by the word the experience of the upper room i have the same anointing the same revelation of the upper room hallelujah amen so what are we ordained to do how's that song go brother jason by the fruit of our lips and the blood of the lamb what is our confession is it in conflict with the blood see that ought to be something you know brother brown says don't don't uh speak the devil's language i can't grasp the whole quote right in my mind right at the moment i'll i'll butcher it if i repeat it but you know my brother and sister that's that's not worse out we're not called we're not ordained or anointed amen to speak defeat we're not ordained or anointed to say well this is the best that i can do my brother and sister we're anointed ordained of god not to fail that's where our ordination that's where we are ordained us not to fail amen what is it i i going back to what some of the things brother stephen spoke at camp amen called to a glorious victory amen we're not called to mediocrity now let's turn in galatians 5 and i need to just mosey right along here galatians 5 1 stand fast therefore what are we doing god's revealed to us can someone say god's revealed to me amen stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free so this liberty has already set us free be not entangled again right this is like going back again to the same thing reminds me when my dad i i would have been just absolutely a baby baby but one of dad's neighbors ended up going to the hospital and didn't work for a day or two and then my dad saw him out in the field and this is in the day of the side sickle mower and my dad stopped got out went over to him and said hey what was this i heard you went to the hospital and had some surgery he says well he said you know the mower was still running and i knew better than to leave it running but i looked down there and i saw something stuck in the mower so i reached down there to do it and i cut off a finger and the man demonstrating have any of you ever done this demonstrating and so it was there like this and i reached down and he cut another finger off true story back to the hospital he goes then when i grew up i knew orly because orley had two stubs and two little fingers i didn't know the story till later but my brother and sister don't god help us not to go back you know if he'd just stood there in the beginning and said okay it's worth my effort to shut the tractor off he could have pulled as many things out of there as he wanted and walked away good so it's once the devil tricks you but god says don't worry about it i've got blood i covered you it's finished it's settled don't worry about it don't even let condemnation come your way but we go back come on it's what brother david was you know kind of interpreting i don't know that it's what he said but it's what i heard look it's the devil flee or maybe he's a nice devil no such thing there's no such thing as a nice devil yeah so be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage so we was there once right we've been redeemed from that let's not go back and so paul says here i say unto you that if you be circumstance circumcised i mean christ shall profit you nothing right so if we are counting oh i hope you catch this i'm kind of twisting things around but if we declare i believe the message i belong to the message i attend a message church christ shall profit you nothing we got to come into that place circumcised in the spirit realm dying out to christ letting him cut away everything that's a hindrance to our life and not pulling back from that and just say lord whatever it is cut on me he says you know i testify every man the circumcised that he's a debtor to the whole law and i'm telling you the old testament they couldn't keep the law not even the priests none of them could keep the law oh my christ has become of no effect unto you have you ever been in a situation saints where the devil just kind of tries to get you to come to a place that i read my bible i read something or listen to something out of the message i go to church i'm okay has that ever afflicted you time in my life i'll just admit there was time in my life i thought i was just doing pretty good i went to church i read my bible i read something out of the message god's gonna do that then i got saved who's justified by the law you're fallen from grace but through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith there's where our righteousness will rise up theirs were living that life of satisfaction how would i say this i don't want to say this incorrect i'm just going to say it this way and trust that you'll understand living that life of satisfaction living that life not satisfaction in ourself but satisfied of what christ has done for us and what the word is moving us we're still being moved you know it's something to say you know praise the lord you know uh the lord come and we we come into the message you know and uh in in 1970 praise the lord 1970. was god done anything since 1970 we saints should be able to come tonight if i could challenge you in a very polite and kind way we need to have something that we can say god came on the scene today my god dealt with me stirred my soul lifted me up brought a standard when the devil come like a flood brought this standard up today not even six months ago not a year ago definitely not 20 or something years that's what should be happening in our life so it's there see circumcision avail anything nor uncircumcision but faith now you did run well who did hinder you we met that guy on sunday lifelong message believer knows brother knows brother been to just special meetings here camp meeting there was over here when the holy ghost fell we was here when there was a healing took place we was here we've heard the testimonies we know these people personally come on won't do us a bit of good not one bit of good we can have set in a chair that the prophet sat in we can sleep in a bed the prophet slept in won't do us one bit of good see we run well but something hindered us that we didn't obey the truth and that's where it comes down now verse 8 very strong verse in my opinion this persuasion which is anything short of having a new birth and being filled with the holy ghost this persuasion come not of him that calleth you see there's a lot of people persuaded my brother and sister that's what's happening the influence is moving through the land there is things that are taking place and people are being persuaded as it were and don't realize nobody's going to walk up and say here you know what let me just clamp this yoke of bondage on your neck or worse yet on your soul nobody's going to do that my brother and sister it's by a persuasion as it were of look we have quotes that support us but what about the word you won't find my brother and sister the word of god contradicting itself but you will with a slight spin any of you ever play baseball yeah kind of good at baseball no yes no i'm kind of right there too when i was younger early high school days i had a pretty good slider just a certain way to throw that thing twist your arm in a totally unnatural way catch this a totally unnatural way my elbow just popped even just doing that i don't even have holds of a baseball but what happened in that totally unnatural presentation of the message of the hour they send that right in there in such a fashion that people say that's it can't support it with their bible they can't get it to all go together what is it the agenda is to bind a yoke of bondage upon you is it necessary many people in the earth today it's necessary they have no church whatever reasons that they are where they are one thing but what was the prophet's indictment they'll come a day that they won't even cross the street to go to the house of god we're in that day saints what is it satan has actually put a yoke upon people i'm not saying this judgmentally actually makes my heart hurt but the yoke is upon them that they won't hey i can just sit home and stream this now that's a necessary ingredient i've done it before when i was tired and and whatnot you know and you you don't feel good but you don't feel right just not doing something so by god's grace we can stream with the technology but when people just take that as their matter of course and they say no it's good i'm doing just as good as i would in the house of god well good you know that brother that sister that kid you don't like might be your own kid might be your own husband brother or your own sister wife you don't like you know what god does he has a way of just rubbing and rubbing and rubbing because you see what we think we are if it doesn't match what god said we are then we have to change or should we commission saints i want to hurry along here it's nine o'clock or should we commission a group to maybe rewrite the message to make it more palatable for our generation i'm sure we could find volunteers but that's not what we're called to the original seed that's what god has for us hallelujah so look my brother and sister let me just say this we're not here to trade yokes we're not going to trade doubts for fears because the fear seems to be less than the doubts we're not here to trade that amen we're not here to trade an evil spirit for a religious spirit amen we're called out people can someone say amen to that called to be the bride of christ not called to just be mediocre not called to just kind of get along but we're desiring and this will be like a future deal we're desiring to be yoked to christ there's where the only yoke that we really want is to be yoked to christ it's it's not to be yoked into something of this world look how this works my brother and sister you can take a job i won't share the testimony you've heard it before but you see satan's so clever he'll say you know what if you take this job that keeps you out of church you're going to make more money and you're going to this and it's going to be there and that and the benefits and vacation time but you won't be able to go to church satan what is he doing he's holding the yoke as it is there waiting for us to put our own head in and later we say well the devil did it no you did it you did it because you didn't pray jerry and i it's a joke and i won't go into it but i asked sister jerry today just kind of a little facetious question i said did you pray about that you know what her answer was i figured if the lord would have my husband say yes then that was wow hallelujah i'm telling you saints sometimes the devil's tricky he's a real character he gets us in there and we just like oh it'll be fine it's not evil well just because it's not evil don't mean it's for you yeah look we're desiring to be yoked with christ to be entered into a love affair yeah brother david i like that yeah just let me let you guys know i don't remember just exactly i'll tell you um i'm in an affair yep you sure are hallelujah and that affair is so powerful it's binding it's drawing it's holding and it can't be broken and that's the love affair of the bride of christ with her lord jesus christ she is bound to him she is yoked up so tight to him she couldn't get away from him if she wanted to and the devil says i'm going to separate him i'm going to separate him but you see it's not us my brother and sister we're held by the yoke which is the love of christ which is expressed to us through the holy ghost hallelujah so it's there we you know we might even be dragging i tell you it'd be kind of a visual image for you maybe that here we are in laodicea you're all humans aren't you now how many letters am i holding up can you type that in the square so we make sure you're not a bot we can't last five minutes you know what the picture would look like footsteps on the sands of time but lord there's only one set of footsteps i've seen this drawn out it was kind of a somewhat partially sacrilegious comic and i pardoned that but it's a lord there's only one set of foot steps that's when i carried you son they did this comic of christ dragging us and it showed two little trenches in the beach that was our toes as he just took us along and now i hope that's not offensive to you but my brother and sister the truth is he's carried us drug us done whatever he's done he's brought us to the place we are right now nothing else has nothing else has but he has hallelujah see we're not serving a god of the heavens only but we're serving a god who meets us where we're walking amen now i just want to jump no we'll just drag this along on another day because i have a whole thing that might be a little difficult for some of you to bite on until you hear the whole thing so we'll just wait but i'll tell you i'll give you just a hint of this our perception controls our reality sister emmy will you come what is our perception brother david laid a nice ground a little foundation you see you've got to be able to go back and pinpoint saints right to that place that revelation that paul took to the galatians is the same revelation that's come to this day and you say how can you say that because the prophet of god said if paul preached it i preached it it'll be the same amen what was it he come back to them with revelation he had now i just want to leave this i'm not trying to make a divisive thing here just for you to think about it paul had come by his own words and preached the gospel to them at one time but now he's come back was it 14 years later revelation how many of us i was just a little kid about nine years old when my parents come in the message you can say i was raised in the message when did revelation come it's not how long we were there saints let it be measured when revelation came to us when we could pinpoint who we are or were if you'd like to use that in that phrase in jesus christ that's what matters that's where the revelation has come it's when our perception of who we are in the word and we realize they're talking about me what the prophets say he didn't say these things just for words saints he said you should be able to find yourself in the bible why because when you found yourself in there your perception of who you are and why you are here changed absolutely changed because there's the point in time that god starts to open up our understanding starts to build that up in such a fashion i want to read this one very very short quote to you and then we'll be done this is taken out of satan's eden and i pruned it down because i i knew i would be too long that's what satan does he doesn't make us rich come on he doesn't make us good-looking he doesn't make us smart he doesn't make us liked or likeable i could go on with just this whole litany i could write a list to cover this whole wall of what satan doesn't do but i can in one quote show you what he does do that's what satan does he perverts the nations boy isn't that terrible how corrupt these gov governments are just so horrible give you a little clue canada is working right now to pass a law force every farmer to cut fertilizer to grow less in a time when there's not enough food to feed the world what are they shooting for what is their agenda [Music] but if they're doing that in the natural the prophet of god said the natural and the spiritual always travel together they're doing their very best we can join a reformed church which was a church like this but we reformed it to look like a christian church he perverts the nation he perverts the church he perverts the people he is a deceiver a perverter of the original truth what is that come a little closer can i have just one more slight statement to you we read this scripture where those that had been servants and it come to their jubilee their deliverance what would cause a man who's now been set free right there's nothing to hold him he's free and he who is free is free indeed what would cause them to go to the post and allow someone to take an awl you know i don't even know how that's possible just pardon me for a second here i got to do a little experimentation you you know how personal that is the guy's got an all right here and a hammer right here this isn't some removed thing that just happened and i don't remember when it happened are you following me when people come to this place that they return back to that yoke of bondage it is not a position they say i don't know when that happened i don't know how that happened it was a conscious decision oh the prophet was a good man but he got off here just a second you've got to see where it's all chewed up here all these you've got to get your ear right there it looks like this man striking you in the face with a hammer you didn't forget it you didn't look over it and say i can't remember when that happened making conscious decisions to embrace satan's eden oh my i tell you what i'm so glad by the power of the word we didn't have to fight to break the yoke off they fell off the holy ghost come and delivered us from these yokes in our life that we could be free and we could make the claim that i am free indeed amen can we make that claim tonight i am free indeed hallelujah hallelujah oh i got some other good quotes here oh yeah let's just stand and sing that song i surrender all you know it just so struck me saints as i'm reading satan's eden there brother branham is making reference in there and right above the song right the quote right there that i just put up there for you he's there he says let's go stop right here and let's just do a little explaining and it sounds more like a prayer but he's coming in that context satan the deceiver but lord i'm here to surrender all there's a yoke then i must bear a yoke that has as it were my name it's not a bondage but but but paul said i paul a prisoner of christ are we willing to be prisoners tonight lord i'm here just to surrender all i'm going to come i'm not going to fight you you don't have to tase me you don't have to wrestle me to the ground you don't have to drag me to an altar lord i'm just going to come and just surrender all and i'm going to let you put your yoke upon me and i'll never lord i'll never try to break that i don't want to be free from that yoke because i have been set free and i will not return back to the bondage of this laodicean world hallelujah [Music] surrender oh thank you lord [Music] in oh lord that's our hearts desire tonight [Music] surrender all more to them [Music] your eye surrender all to jesus is [Music] may jesus face i surrender all [Music] save your eyes surrender all [Music] oh yes we feel i surrendered oh [Music] surrender all to these i give myself to me oh fill me [Music] is [Music] on i surrender all [Music] surrender all to jesus oh can we say amen to this now i feel the sacred flame oh the joy of salvation [Music] glory to his name surrender all [Music] i surrender all [Music] can we just punctuate that with an amen it's letting the lord know so be it lord so be it we can just come and surrender to you hallelujah i got several more songs but i think we'll just dismiss on that amen let's remember those that will be traveling on brother prashant sister quancha will be driving up from california to come for communion and a time of fellowship and so just remember them sister joe lynn sister leah will be flying home arriving in boise i think close to midnight on this coming saturday night so if you please remember them appreciate that brother trevor's got to be driving home from reno or that surrounding area i don't know who all's traveling where i think about it for the moment but just just lift one another up in prayer you know we never want to sound boastful but you know just seems like you go through cycles and you know you go to bed and you wake up tired and somehow you wake up at 3am and you can't go back to sleep i don't know if you've ever experienced that but i'm telling you it's a lovely time don't lay there and check you know do your checkbook bank balance don't figure out what you got to do and rewrite your grocery slip in your head again and again and again take that time i don't know how you would do it and i'm not trying to be presumptuous myself i'm kind of a visual literal i just have to go to one end of the valley start thinking about who lives here and who lives there and then if we were traveling through the valley we would be over here and we work our way until we end up over there you know please don't forget to extend your limitation on the other end the valley sister april uh moving trucks should show up in the couple days she said she would let us know the laborers with the moving company will be doing the labor so but just remember extend the length of the valley just a little further out include her and just remember you know one time someone told me said brother paul [Music] it's not right for you to preach on something or preach about something you know about [Music] i thought okay i understand i actually understand where they're coming from i know you're misbehaving so i'm i'm not supposed to preach on that except for you see a higher authority said preach that by the hearing of the word we might be redeemed by his precious blood [Music] forgive me don't forget to pray for those things that you know yeah sometimes we're like well lord you know what they have need of no voice it lord they have this going on in their life and they stopped and they're listening to the devil they didn't run off they're listening to him and he's explaining to them why this yoke was made especially for them i don't need a personalized yoke unless the other one is jesus christ god bless you i love you amen i'll go ahead and preach the rest of my sermon if i'm not careful i love you come hungry come thirsty come filled with the fire of god this sunday amen come with an expectation but not just an expectation of what you'll carry away but be a contributor come and pour out the spirit of the lord in this building this coming sunday that god will come down and speak to each one of us i love you in the lord god bless you amen don't leave his presence take it home with you amen fill the car up go home pour it out in your household amen those of you that fought with each other on the way to church just repent when you get outside again get back in the car those of you that have been discouraged i want you to confess the yoke is broken amen i know have a need to to carry depression and uh you know all these doubts and all these fears i'm just letting the lord break this yoke and i'm gonna leave that yoke and i'm not ever going back god bless you all hallelujah [Music] do [Music] do [Music] do do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] you
