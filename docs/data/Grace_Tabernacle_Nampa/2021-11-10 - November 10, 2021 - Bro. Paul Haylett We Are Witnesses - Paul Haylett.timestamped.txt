[27:09] justified glad you've been justified
[27:11] tonight
[27:12] amen
[27:14] let's sing this
[27:15] i was sitting alone and wondering
[27:19] about what i'm supposed to do
[27:23] i can't deny the times i made mistakes
[27:27] can't hide from happy news
[27:30] but i know that deep within my soul i
[27:34] feel sorry honest i do
[27:38] so i just cried and said forgive me lord
[27:42] forgive me lord will you
[27:46] oh
[27:50] [Music]
[28:00] i
[28:05] [Music]
[28:10] in the first place
[28:27] he looked from eternity
[28:41] to justify
[28:51] you have not done it in the first place
[29:06] have not done it in the first place to
[29:09] justify
[29:13] [Music]
[29:22] in the first place
[29:35] [Music]
[29:38] justify
[29:49] look at you where you are now if you
[29:52] look
[30:04] in the first place
[30:15] [Music]
[30:20] justify
[30:30] i've not done it in the first place
[30:34] justify
[30:36] can somebody say amen this evening
[30:38] hallelujah
[30:40] hallelujah
[30:43] amen the devil spends so much time and
[30:45] effort saying look look look but he's
[30:47] looking at the wrong picture hallelujah
[30:50] aren't you glad tonight
[30:52] amen we want to just bring greetings
[30:54] tonight you know i say this with a bit
[30:57] of humor i i probably shouldn't but i
[31:00] would like to introduce you to sister
[31:02] hannah's husband
[31:06] i've had that done to me many times
[31:08] brother flint and i just couldn't resist
[31:11] amen brother flint um just um
[31:14] you know my brother-in-law
[31:16] a lot of years and faithful got a little
[31:19] assembly there and uh i guess we'd call
[31:21] it anchorage and and they're just been
[31:23] pressing on for years and years and god
[31:25] has got his blessing then we've just had
[31:28] some lovely fellowship uh and uh here
[31:31] hunting with brother chris course a
[31:33] little disappointed maybe they didn't
[31:35] find an animal uh in the woods but i
[31:37] think the fellowship no doubt that they
[31:39] had his father and son would have
[31:41] outweighed
[31:42] any animal and uh so just lovely uh to
[31:46] have
[31:47] them here amen
[31:49] and uh
[31:50] so just there was one other thought upon
[31:52] my mind
[31:54] amen
[31:55] oh my
[31:57] brother jason
[31:58] where did it go
[32:01] amen
[32:02] okay well we just move forward god bless
[32:04] you see each one of you tonight and i
[32:07] just pray the lord's special blessings
[32:09] upon you and uh
[32:11] so
[32:12] uh
[32:13] let's just stand and go
[32:15] into
[32:16] my right on the edge of my mind as this
[32:18] other thought and i just can't grasp the
[32:20] holds of it amen yeah if we should write
[32:23] it down when
[32:24] we when we get that age we should write
[32:26] it down
[32:28] you know i i
[32:30] i just speak this i know brother david
[32:32] brother chris will
[32:33] recognize this brother flint sometimes
[32:35] you'll be studying and there'll be a
[32:37] little something come upon you and
[32:39] you'll think oh that would make a lovely
[32:41] sermon and you know if you don't stop
[32:43] that very second
[32:45] and write that down five minutes later
[32:48] you cannot bring that to your
[32:49] remembrance for nothing
[32:52] and uh so i don't think that's an age
[32:54] thing i see brother chris back there
[32:56] shaking his head yes
[32:58] yes
[32:59] but uh you know sometimes those
[33:00] inspirations just come and you know we
[33:03] have to grab aholts of those and god
[33:05] bless you sister sophie sister grace
[33:07] tonight good to see you amen isn't grace
[33:10] just the cutest girl you ever met
[33:12] amen
[33:13] i tell you i've had the privilege to
[33:15] know her since she was just
[33:17] a little little grace
[33:20] and she's now a big grace amen
[33:23] let's turn our bibles this evening i
[33:24] want to speak to you on the thought
[33:26] we'll take it from this scripture
[33:29] we are witness it and
[33:31] it's an interesting way because
[33:33] certainly tonight saints we stand here
[33:36] as witnesses of the gospel of jesus
[33:39] christ but we're going to look at this
[33:41] tonight in just a slightly different
[33:43] fashion to see how it is in the book of
[33:46] joshua as joshua is dealing with the
[33:49] people now remember these are the people
[33:51] that have left egypt
[33:54] under a prophetic promise
[33:56] and all they had to do was remain with
[34:00] the prophetic promise they didn't need a
[34:02] new revelation they didn't need a new
[34:04] avenue to approach it they needed to
[34:06] just remain under that prophetic promise
[34:10] and that prophetic promise was is i'll
[34:12] lead you from a land and i'll take you
[34:14] into a promised land and and uh so we'll
[34:16] just look at this and and take this from
[34:19] joshua the 24th chapter and we'll start
[34:22] with the 13th verse this evening amen so
[34:25] as we look at this i want you just to to
[34:28] just maybe take a second to glance in
[34:30] your bibles uh before this so that you
[34:33] can just kind of catch the context of
[34:35] what is taking place and and uh
[34:38] certainly by god's grace we can express
[34:40] that tonight joshua 24 13
[34:44] and i have given you a land for which
[34:46] you did not labor and cities which you
[34:49] built not and you dwell in them
[34:52] of the vineyards and olive yards which
[34:54] he planted not do you eat
[34:57] now therefore fear the lord and serve
[35:00] him in sincerity
[35:02] and in truth
[35:04] now remember what the prophet of god
[35:06] said he said in this day under that
[35:07] religious spirit these people would be
[35:09] even more sincere than the very bride of
[35:12] christ
[35:13] they would have this great degree of
[35:16] sincerity of devotion they'll feed the
[35:18] poor they'll clothe the poor they'll
[35:20] travel the earth to tell people about
[35:22] jesus christ but the ingredient they're
[35:24] missing
[35:25] is truth
[35:27] and if we have truth but no sincerity
[35:31] we're really in the same boat
[35:35] serve him in sincerity and in truth and
[35:37] put away the gods which your father
[35:39] served on the other side of the flood
[35:41] and in egypt and serve you the lord
[35:44] and if it seems evil unto you to serve
[35:46] the lord choose you this day whom you
[35:49] will serve whether the gods which your
[35:51] father served that were on the other
[35:52] side of the flood or the gods of the
[35:54] amorites in whose land ye dwell but as
[35:57] for me oh i hope somebody can say amen
[36:00] tonight but as for me and my house we
[36:04] will serve the lord
[36:06] and the people answered and said god
[36:08] forbid that we should forsake the lord
[36:10] and serve other gods
[36:13] for the lord our god
[36:16] you know that's what we need to do make
[36:17] a very positive confession of identity
[36:21] of what it is the lord our god
[36:25] he it is that brought us up and our
[36:28] fathers out of the land of egypt from
[36:30] the house of bondage which did those
[36:32] great signs in our sight and preserved
[36:36] us in all the way wherein we went among
[36:39] all the people through whom we passed
[36:43] my i'll just try and contain myself here
[36:46] and the lord drave out from before us
[36:48] all the people even the amorites which
[36:50] dwelt in the land therefore will we also
[36:53] serve the lord for he is our god and
[36:57] joshua said unto the people
[36:59] ye cannot serve the lord
[37:02] now if we stop there that would be
[37:04] almost
[37:05] taking all faith and hope away from us
[37:10] for he's a holy god
[37:12] he is a jealous god
[37:14] he will not forgive your transgressions
[37:16] nor your sins
[37:18] if
[37:19] see isn't this beautiful how
[37:21] there is this connection in the
[37:23] scripture in the word
[37:26] if you forsake the lord
[37:29] so everything that we would come and say
[37:31] well i i would i would be this i would
[37:34] be that i identify here i identify there
[37:39] joshua spoke pretty strongly didn't he
[37:42] you won't be able to serve him you won't
[37:44] be able to do it
[37:45] if you don't
[37:47] seek
[37:48] sigh and cry
[37:51] for the truth
[37:54] if you don't do all that's within you to
[37:56] possess
[37:58] the truth
[38:03] not forgive your transgressions nor your
[38:05] sins you forsake the lord and serve
[38:06] strange gods then he will turn and do
[38:09] you hurt and consume you after
[38:12] that he hath done you good and the
[38:14] people said unto joshua nay but we will
[38:18] serve the lord and joshua said unto the
[38:20] people
[38:22] here's where we've got our title tonight
[38:25] joshua said unto the people ye are
[38:27] witnesses
[38:28] against yourselves
[38:31] that ye have chosen you the lord to
[38:33] serve him and they said
[38:36] we
[38:37] are witnesses
[38:39] now therefore put away said he strange
[38:41] gods which are among you and incline
[38:44] your heart and to the lord god of israel
[38:46] and the people said unto joshua the lord
[38:49] our god will we serve and his voice will
[38:53] we obey
[38:54] heavenly father we're asking for your
[38:56] guiding hand tonight father as we just
[38:59] come in these things you've laid upon
[39:00] our heart father may we just bring it in
[39:02] such a way lord that you can anoint it
[39:04] to our hearts and souls lord we love you
[39:07] adore you thank you for your grace and
[39:09] mercy tonight amen
[39:11] you may be seated saints
[39:16] so as we would look at the word of god
[39:18] tonight
[39:20] i want to go back as i said uh where we
[39:23] have taken our title go back to verse 21
[39:26] and then people said unto joshua nay but
[39:28] we will serve the lord so we're denying
[39:31] every other position that we could take
[39:34] and we are going to stand in a position
[39:36] that we are testifying and joshua says
[39:39] to them
[39:40] and i i love this my brother and sister
[39:42] because we know that in any time of that
[39:45] there is judgment
[39:47] god will always have a witness upon the
[39:49] earth uh and to satisfy as it were the
[39:52] judgment and so while there is a people
[39:55] that will be judged for all manner of
[39:58] unbelief and and what we would describe
[40:00] as sin there will be those witnesses
[40:02] that god has raised up who have been
[40:04] able by the grace of god amen can
[40:07] somebody say by the grace of god that we
[40:10] will stand in this hour as a witness of
[40:14] the saving delivering power of almighty
[40:17] god we will not my brother and sister
[40:20] stand that day and say well you know i
[40:22] really didn't do it but i guess it's
[40:24] just god's favor that's put me here
[40:27] god's favor is what makes the way for us
[40:30] to live this life and so by the grace of
[40:33] god we press into the word for the day
[40:36] and we are able to stand upon that word
[40:38] and joshua tells him ye are witnesses
[40:41] against yourselves that ye have chosen
[40:44] the lord to serve him and the people's
[40:46] acknowledgement or their testimony is we
[40:48] are witnesses and you know it's there in
[40:51] that powerful position my brother and
[40:53] sister
[40:54] it is that uh uh it would seem as though
[40:58] it would be an oddity for someone to
[41:00] witness against themselves but just let
[41:02] me step into what may be construed as a
[41:05] little negative position in the world we
[41:08] live in today people are using the
[41:10] lord's name in vain they are using his
[41:13] name associated with words as damnation
[41:15] etc you know the phrases that they use
[41:18] and so it's there in this people do not
[41:21] realize what they're actually testifying
[41:23] of they are testifying of a judgment
[41:27] against god or a lack of confidence in
[41:30] god a lack of even acknowledgement of
[41:32] his existence or his deity and so in all
[41:36] of that they're actually testifying of
[41:38] their own position but let's step over
[41:40] into the religious world and see in the
[41:43] world we live in today and you know i'm
[41:45] very fond of the phrase chino christian
[41:47] in name only that these people also by
[41:50] taking the word let's forget about all
[41:52] these other religions let's bring it
[41:54] back down home here then we testify of
[41:57] the power of god within the word in our
[41:59] day a prophetic word in our day we
[42:02] testify of that but then we turn around
[42:05] by our very actions and deny it so it's
[42:08] there one to take it in healing
[42:10] we claim that god is a healer but yet we
[42:13] ourselves do not take the final step to
[42:16] possess our healing by having an
[42:19] unwavering faith in the healing power or
[42:23] virtue my brother and sister mark 16 was
[42:26] not put there just to fill up space it
[42:28] is the word for our day amen so the
[42:31] prophet of god tells us over and over
[42:33] again that if you believe this
[42:35] regardless of your symptom you don't go
[42:38] out and say well i am healed and then
[42:40] the first people you meet well i'm so
[42:42] miserable i'm this i'm that what you
[42:44] have to do is by a changing now i'm not
[42:47] talking about just some carnal willpower
[42:49] thing to change it but there is a degree
[42:51] of that that is involved we have to make
[42:54] a decision that i'm going to change my
[42:56] language i'm going to change my
[42:58] presentation because i'm actually
[43:01] testifying either for or against myself
[43:04] i'm a believer then let's testify as
[43:07] believers but if we say we're a believer
[43:10] and we testify as though we are
[43:12] unbelievers then our testimony will then
[43:15] be held against us so as joshua is
[43:19] talking to the people and they are there
[43:21] declaring that we are going to serve god
[43:24] he tells them you are witnesses against
[43:26] yourself in other words joshua was
[43:28] saying on that day in that time in these
[43:31] circumstances i will not have to stand
[43:33] up and say this is what you've done but
[43:36] their very words
[43:38] their own words their own actions will
[43:40] then come as their testimony for or
[43:43] against them oh god help us
[43:46] god help us that we would be testifying
[43:49] that we are believers in this hour and
[43:51] our life and our very words back up that
[43:54] we are believers amen not a
[43:57] contradictory well are they believers or
[43:59] not they might be believer today but had
[44:01] a rough day so they're not a believer no
[44:03] my brother and sister good days bad days
[44:05] no matter what is happening uh on the
[44:08] mountain in the valley i'm a believer
[44:10] and i ask lord help me that my life will
[44:13] testify i'm a believer
[44:15] amen so you look at this now let's look
[44:18] at egypt
[44:20] and israel and all of those things for
[44:22] just a moment
[44:23] you realize my brother and sister that
[44:25] it was prophecy that put israel in egypt
[44:29] but yet it wasn't totally my brother and
[44:32] sister uh uh the prophecy that did it
[44:35] because the prophecy was actually
[44:36] prophesying of israel's actions so was
[44:40] actually israel's action that put them
[44:42] in egypt but the prophecy declared this
[44:45] is why you're going to behave this is
[44:47] what you're going to do this is how
[44:49] you're going to approach god this is how
[44:51] you're going to forsake god and this is
[44:53] what i'm going to do once you have done
[44:55] that now that should be enough my
[44:57] brother and sister for a people to look
[44:59] at a prophecy and say if that is the
[45:01] spirit of the day lord let's oh help us
[45:03] lord have a revival that we're not going
[45:06] to forsake you we're not going to go
[45:08] against your word because we don't want
[45:10] to go to egypt but you see the anointing
[45:12] of the age is strong
[45:14] it is so powerful my brother and sister
[45:16] that that people
[45:18] this is why as we've been speaking to
[45:20] you in these last few services that we
[45:22] have to stay under the blood of jesus
[45:24] christ because that is the only
[45:26] neutralizing agent
[45:28] that there is to the power of the age
[45:31] that we're living in
[45:33] satan's eden has a very strong spirit
[45:36] but we have what it takes to neutralize
[45:38] that and now in warfare my brother and
[45:41] sister whether you're talking spiritual
[45:42] unnatural if you possess that to
[45:46] neutralize the strength of the enemy do
[45:49] you not apply that
[45:51] if you can limit the enemy's ability to
[45:54] move forward to possess the land then
[45:57] you would take and apply that but look
[45:59] at the spirit so strong upon israel at
[46:02] that time that that they themselves were
[46:04] the one actually neutralized
[46:07] and so the prophecy of them going for
[46:09] 400 years
[46:10] into a land into slavery they could no
[46:13] more stop that than nothing
[46:15] but you see it was also prophecy that
[46:18] delivered them out of that land
[46:20] and so is there that prophecy after 400
[46:23] years i'll deliver you into a land i
[46:25] will take you into a profit into a
[46:28] promised land and so it did not put them
[46:31] god didn't put them there as a random
[46:33] thought into egypt my brother and sister
[46:35] he put them in egypt one to show his
[46:38] people that there is consequences
[46:41] i'll tell you what what we need to do i
[46:43] don't want our young people to ever be
[46:44] afraid of the lord but i want our young
[46:46] people to realize as some of us older
[46:48] people can well testify there are
[46:50] consequences to our decisions
[46:53] we can't just be scotch-free and just
[46:56] you know hop skip and a jump and just
[46:58] walk away from it that's why from an age
[47:01] as little as we can communicate and lay
[47:03] this down into the heart of our children
[47:05] we need to lay this foundation that
[47:08] serving god is not just about do's and
[47:11] don'ts but it is the greatest blessings
[47:14] that can ever be poured out on mankind
[47:16] it is the greatest strength that can be
[47:18] placed into a young man's life the
[47:20] greatest virtue placed into a young
[47:22] woman's life is serving god for the
[47:24] world is here to take away and god is
[47:26] here to fill up amen to raise up amen as
[47:30] i heard a brother preach one time he
[47:31] said it's just real simple young people
[47:33] it is the devil is death
[47:36] and jesus christ is life
[47:38] but you see the devil look how he's
[47:40] dressed up death
[47:43] death looks so
[47:45] beautiful
[47:47] you see these guys doing all these
[47:49] things
[47:51] they jump out of planes with
[47:53] nothing hardly more than a sheet
[47:56] to fly like a bird
[47:59] some live some die
[48:01] they memorialize and make a hero out of
[48:03] the ones that die but what they don't
[48:05] realize is satan's just tempting them
[48:07] with death
[48:09] and then on the simple side of this if i
[48:11] would view it simply god says you know
[48:13] what all i'm asking of you is for your
[48:16] love and devotion
[48:18] and obedience but it's not obedience by
[48:20] law right it's obedience because it's
[48:22] been written on our hearts and our heart
[48:24] desires
[48:26] to serve god and
[48:27] and the devil so has put that down
[48:30] as though some guy who is
[48:32] devoted to jesus christ is somehow a
[48:35] weak vessel
[48:37] he's not worthy of our attention
[48:39] this over here is what is we glorify
[48:44] my the devil's quite a marketing agent
[48:46] isn't he
[48:48] so this prophecy is testifying actually
[48:50] of their actions
[48:52] and so as i said the lord didn't put him
[48:54] in egypt on a random thought but he put
[48:57] him there actually on their failure to
[48:59] obey the word of god and as we've been
[49:03] preaching on obedience the two sides of
[49:05] obedience you see my brother and sister
[49:07] oftentimes the disobedience uh to the
[49:10] word is because man chose to be obedient
[49:13] to man
[49:18] it's very simple
[49:20] when we have the option church
[49:22] and you know this is something very deep
[49:24] in my heart because i preach it to you a
[49:25] lot
[49:27] we have the option
[49:28] to take and go back to the word
[49:32] or simply to take some man's word for it
[49:36] how hard is it for us to take it back to
[49:38] the word
[49:39] we have at our fingertips today
[49:43] the message on phones and ipads and
[49:46] computers
[49:47] almost anywhere on the earth we can go
[49:50] and check it to the word
[49:53] but satan anoints that
[49:55] such a fashion
[49:57] now look that's what got israel in
[49:58] trouble
[50:00] they took them as we were talking about
[50:02] mike and his hireling priest they they
[50:04] took the word of someone else that they
[50:06] were sure he must be right
[50:08] and they didn't bother to go and check
[50:10] it again
[50:11] isn't this kind of scary
[50:13] amen
[50:14] but we see that it was a failure to obey
[50:17] the word of for their day that that set
[50:19] them but yet my brother and sister it
[50:21] was prophecy that set the stage for
[50:23] their deliverance so the very word this
[50:26] sentiment to egypt is the same word that
[50:28] sent them out again and so it was there
[50:30] in that while they are in egypt imagine
[50:33] now god knows what he's doing my brother
[50:35] and sister and he works on you and i in
[50:37] the same fashion and i trust tonight you
[50:39] can connect the dots that they are in
[50:41] egypt and as it was it wasn't such a bad
[50:43] life when they were there and everything
[50:46] was ample and in good supply but then
[50:48] pharaoh started turning up the heat
[50:52] they started having four dollar gas
[50:56] i hope you just follow me
[50:58] grocery bills went through the roof
[51:01] and they said you know what
[51:03] for us
[51:04] corporations to exist we're gonna have
[51:06] to lower your wages
[51:09] is there any parallels that you're
[51:11] seeing
[51:14] and the pressure started to build on the
[51:16] people and it was at a time when there
[51:18] was plenteous
[51:20] that they didn't really think about how
[51:22] they had transgressed the word of god
[51:24] because yeah we're in egypt but look at
[51:26] this
[51:27] we live in a nice house it might be a
[51:28] company house it doesn't matter it's a
[51:30] nice house we have plenty of food we're
[51:32] wearing the best clothes we've ever wore
[51:34] in our life and it's there but god just
[51:36] starts turning the heat up now we can
[51:38] look at it and say oh that rotten old
[51:40] pharaoh he's doing this to god's people
[51:42] he's punishing god's people but you
[51:44] realize my brother and sister this was
[51:46] an avenue as the clock went tick tick
[51:48] tick this was an avid bring the people
[51:51] to a place that not god himself i hope
[51:53] you catch this not god himself saying
[51:55] okay ding it's time for deliverance but
[51:58] it was coming to a place at the ticking
[52:00] of the clock that the people coming into
[52:02] a state of desperation and they started
[52:04] saying oh god deliver us oh god was
[52:07] there not prophecy is there not a word
[52:10] in our hour that has declared that there
[52:13] is deliverance in the house of god
[52:16] and the people started pressing into
[52:18] that and when moses is there now
[52:21] god speaks to him and says
[52:23] i have heard the cry
[52:25] of my people
[52:28] god knew all the time that this certain
[52:30] pressure this certain thing affect you
[52:32] and affect you and affect you a little
[52:34] different all of us a little different
[52:35] in our situation but god knew that that
[52:37] pressure would bring us to a place we
[52:39] would start crying out and i tell you
[52:41] tonight's saints i believe god is trying
[52:43] to bring us to a place right now that
[52:45] the greatest cry that we have in our
[52:47] life is a cry to him
[52:50] it is not a cry as it were to the
[52:52] conditions of the world it's not a cry
[52:54] to this injustice and that injustice but
[52:57] god bringing a bride to a place that our
[52:59] first and only thought is to cry out to
[53:02] him
[53:04] amen
[53:06] but you see my brother and sister the
[53:07] spirit of the prophecy was moving in the
[53:10] people
[53:11] because god cannot speak a word
[53:13] and it not come to pass
[53:15] so he spoke the word
[53:17] and then he brings around this
[53:19] circumstance the people do not i believe
[53:23] i don't think there's anything to
[53:24] support
[53:25] the idea that the people are saying
[53:27] okay
[53:28] we're going to go through this for a
[53:29] little season then god will deliver us
[53:33] they had no more idea than we do
[53:36] but it didn't matter to them because
[53:38] every day was bringing them to a place
[53:42] that their heart was crying out lord
[53:45] lord deliver us
[53:47] deliver us from the wickedness deliver
[53:50] us from evil man's intent deliver us
[53:52] from this that is around us
[53:55] the oppressive spirit of the age deliver
[53:58] us lord
[53:59] now you can take this down through
[54:01] history and type it you can type it
[54:03] right to the day here we don't have time
[54:05] tonight but my brother and sister you'll
[54:07] find that the devil will always
[54:09] manipulate things to cause you to have
[54:11] to do more with less
[54:15] but that's never been the case
[54:17] in the life of a christian
[54:19] god has always said i will supply your
[54:23] every need
[54:26] so we say well we're not doing so well
[54:30] i know
[54:31] i'm probably the worst among you for
[54:32] liking things
[54:34] boats trains planes
[54:37] aren't they fun
[54:38] we should own one
[54:41] or let's own them all
[54:44] but you see god said
[54:46] nowhere in scripture i'll supply what
[54:48] you want he said i'll supply what you
[54:50] need but here's favor under the spirit
[54:53] of oppression i want more
[54:56] out of you for less
[54:58] and so there he starts to wear upon the
[55:00] people but god's using that to bring a
[55:03] deliverance to the people now look at
[55:05] this in uh the word here my brother and
[55:08] sister uh let's just move along here as
[55:10] we would brothers uh let's go to that
[55:12] next slide
[55:14] uh in uh hearing receiving and acting
[55:16] and that a wonderful title you know how
[55:18] many sermons there's got to be at least
[55:19] 10 000 sermons right there in just that
[55:21] title alone amen but brother brown says
[55:24] now moses why certainly he didn't go out
[55:27] to some school or stand before some
[55:29] psychologist to find out if he was able
[55:31] to go down to egypt he had saw that
[55:34] pillar of fire wound up in the top of a
[55:36] bush and when he seen that he thought
[55:38] you know what if that attract his
[55:40] attention so we begin to hear a voice
[55:41] coming out of there saying i've heard
[55:43] the cries of my people and i've
[55:46] remembered my covenant and i've come
[55:48] down to deliver them first thing he did
[55:50] he heard he recognized it was god
[55:53] because it was the word
[55:55] now my brother and sister it didn't
[55:57] matter that most of israel had forgotten
[55:59] the promise that had been given most of
[56:03] them were generations removed from this
[56:06] and so there they had come you might say
[56:08] a acclimatized to the world that they
[56:11] were living in and that's what satan's
[56:13] actually trying to do to you and i get
[56:14] acclimatized that we hear curse words
[56:17] when we see nudity and we see all these
[56:19] vulgarities that we just kind of like
[56:21] yeah yeah yeah
[56:23] but help us lord not to be climatized to
[56:25] this help us lord that it be just as
[56:27] offensive in the next 10 years if the
[56:30] lord has not come as it was 10 years ago
[56:32] or whatever that we never allow
[56:34] ourselves to be desensitized to these
[56:37] things but so satan's just always doing
[56:39] this and and god's heard the cries
[56:41] and god says you know what i know the
[56:43] covenant i know my prophecy i know what
[56:45] i said to them and and now i've come
[56:47] down to deliver him so here it is that
[56:50] moses the thing that's so beautiful in
[56:52] another place and i'm sorry i can't
[56:54] quote the message to you brother branham
[56:56] says there that you know all moses had
[56:59] to have done was just waited a few more
[57:01] years and he would have been the pharaoh
[57:03] and then he could have just wrote a
[57:05] decree
[57:06] and said i'm setting them free
[57:10] but that wasn't god's prophecy
[57:12] he said i'll bring them out of the land
[57:14] with a mighty hand
[57:16] amen not a bick
[57:19] but a mighty hand
[57:23] don't we serve an awesome god
[57:25] an on-time god
[57:26] i'll tell you what my brother and sister
[57:29] so he heard he did he heard it and he
[57:32] recognized it was god because it was the
[57:34] word and this is why in the hour we're
[57:36] living saints we need to know what the
[57:39] word is otherwise we have no reference
[57:41] to take it back to
[57:43] oh i heard that now sounds good
[57:47] but if we don't know the word we we have
[57:48] no place to go back and confirm it
[57:54] now when we see these things going on we
[57:56] see things going on examine it by the
[57:59] word
[58:00] if i ever sound redundant about go back
[58:02] to the word go back to the word go back
[58:04] to the word i just ask you go to
[58:08] the table
[58:11] and type in
[58:12] the various variations
[58:15] of back to the word
[58:18] take it to the word
[58:19] the
[58:20] word
[58:22] and when i get up to the point i have
[58:24] said that as much as brother branham has
[58:26] then i'll tone it down
[58:30] because he constantly
[58:32] is telling us
[58:34] back to the word not this spirit that's
[58:36] in the land today that's like we don't
[58:38] need to take it back to the word because
[58:40] we have a vindicated prophet that's not
[58:42] what the prophet of god said you won't
[58:43] find anywhere quit taking it back to the
[58:45] word when you figure out i'm vindicated
[58:49] he just keeps on take it back to the
[58:51] word take it back to the word take it
[58:52] back to the word
[58:54] so if god makes a promise in the word
[58:57] god will send that to back it up amen
[59:02] i believe those words with every bit
[59:04] that's within me
[59:05] amen
[59:06] god will back up his word
[59:10] now look i believe myself and i'll put
[59:12] it that way so you can handle it any way
[59:14] you would desire but i believe this as
[59:16] scriptures here very much in parallel to
[59:18] the church today in the day that we live
[59:20] in amen you see my brother and sister
[59:23] not everyone there coming out of egypt
[59:26] found deliverance in their deliverance
[59:31] now i'm going to repeat that not
[59:33] everyone found deliverance
[59:35] in their deliverance
[59:39] we live in a very parallel of the day
[59:42] people are saying praise god i used to
[59:44] be this religion used to be that
[59:46] religion but my brother and sister we're
[59:47] not looking for the identity of a
[59:50] religion we're looking for the identity
[59:52] of christ and in christ we have
[59:55] deliverance we don't have partial
[59:56] deliverance we don't have a form of
[59:58] deliverance we don't have the concept or
[1:00:00] ideology of deliverance in christ truly
[1:00:03] in christ you have deliverance
[1:00:06] and so it's there that as these people
[1:00:08] are coming out of egypt see they not
[1:00:11] everyone found deliverance in their
[1:00:12] deliverance they were free from egypt
[1:00:15] but they were not free
[1:00:17] from themselves
[1:00:20] now we know as a mixed multitude that
[1:00:22] come out of egypt
[1:00:23] but my brother and sister let's just
[1:00:25] face it you and i sitting here tonight
[1:00:29] there's many things might have come
[1:00:30] through our family it might have been
[1:00:31] the nature we were born with some
[1:00:33] influence that come upon us as a child
[1:00:35] influencing in our in our teens or even
[1:00:38] our older age here and we do that my
[1:00:41] brother and sister and because we have
[1:00:42] the message is no guarantee that we're
[1:00:45] free from these things
[1:00:49] so where is it
[1:00:52] god's going to hear the cry of his
[1:00:53] people
[1:00:56] not well when the lord wants me to be
[1:00:57] free of my temper
[1:01:00] he'll take it from me
[1:01:02] you have to come to the place you cry
[1:01:03] out lord deliver me from this
[1:01:05] lord i need free from this spirit and
[1:01:08] whatever the spirit we won't go in that
[1:01:10] tonight because you you understand but
[1:01:13] whatever that is see it's going to come
[1:01:15] to a time as the old phrase says i'm
[1:01:17] sick and tired of being sick and tired
[1:01:20] and it's there that we have to cry but
[1:01:21] people are saying well if god wants me
[1:01:23] to be free from this
[1:01:26] no god's waiting for you
[1:01:28] to declare i will be free from this
[1:01:30] i will possess the promise of the land i
[1:01:33] will not be hindered i'm not leaving
[1:01:35] egypt to come to another egypt
[1:01:39] i'm not leaving as it were one religion
[1:01:42] to come to another religion
[1:01:45] i left a religion my brother as it were
[1:01:47] i was just a child by god's grace but as
[1:01:49] it were we left a religion to come into
[1:01:52] christ
[1:01:53] amen not into another form of religion
[1:01:55] with another hierarchy another voice
[1:01:57] telling us what we should do the voice
[1:02:00] that we are here is the voice of the
[1:02:01] holy ghost
[1:02:03] amen god's spirit himself
[1:02:06] so my brother and sister you see
[1:02:08] moses the stage was set for moses let's
[1:02:12] look at moses for a moment
[1:02:14] god raised him up
[1:02:16] in the avenue he knew the very finest of
[1:02:20] life
[1:02:20] in the house of pharaoh
[1:02:23] but god anointed him to forsake that
[1:02:26] but yet
[1:02:27] it's kind of a joke we have around our
[1:02:29] house and it is just that if you ever
[1:02:31] hear us joke about it just don't take it
[1:02:33] no deeper than just a joke
[1:02:35] but god knew
[1:02:37] moses need zippy
[1:02:41] god knew he needed zipporah
[1:02:44] hallelujah
[1:02:46] amen so i mean let's face it my brother
[1:02:49] and sister god just knew
[1:02:53] and you brothers you might have laughed
[1:02:54] at me tonight
[1:02:56] but you're married to a woman
[1:02:58] and sometimes they just have a way
[1:03:01] of cutting it right to the bone
[1:03:04] amen
[1:03:06] yeah i've got at least one amen thank
[1:03:08] you
[1:03:09] thank you
[1:03:11] and so here's moses of privilege
[1:03:15] finds himself now
[1:03:17] in a house
[1:03:19] with a brawling woman
[1:03:22] that was actually anointed of god
[1:03:25] to be what she was
[1:03:27] we'd say now according to church order
[1:03:30] and over here and over there sapori
[1:03:33] you're wrong you need to subject
[1:03:34] yourself to your husband but moses
[1:03:37] needed something to break through
[1:03:40] and god says i've got the girl
[1:03:42] she's just on the back side of a desert
[1:03:45] and moses when you're all done i'm going
[1:03:46] to have beat it right out of you where
[1:03:48] you're going to be able to say yes lord
[1:03:51] and when the lord said i want you to go
[1:03:53] down and conquer egypt
[1:03:55] he fought
[1:03:58] pardon my humor tonight
[1:04:00] i've lived with her
[1:04:02] i can conquer egypt
[1:04:07] but look what god did everything that
[1:04:10] happened we'll find it set the stage
[1:04:12] perfectly
[1:04:14] for moses to come
[1:04:16] not as a proud man not as a strong man
[1:04:19] but a man who in his own self said i
[1:04:22] can't do anything without christ i can't
[1:04:25] do anything but what the lord helps me
[1:04:28] and so god anoints moses and moses takes
[1:04:31] them or as the leadership position will
[1:04:33] put that way
[1:04:35] to lead them out and as they are heading
[1:04:38] into the promised land they're on the
[1:04:40] journey now my brother and sister i am
[1:04:42] quite sure that they were singing
[1:04:45] shouting dancing there was a lot of
[1:04:47] people whoa we're going in the promised
[1:04:48] land hallelujah but then they top arise
[1:04:51] and go down through a little cut
[1:04:53] a little ravine as it was starts out and
[1:04:56] it turns into a giant cut and they come
[1:04:58] right down on the red sea and all of a
[1:05:00] sudden they're like whoa whoa now my
[1:05:03] brother and sister they're delivered get
[1:05:05] this
[1:05:06] they're free
[1:05:07] from egypt
[1:05:09] but when they saw that red sea
[1:05:12] they realized they weren't free from
[1:05:13] themselves
[1:05:15] and then when pharaoh's army thunders
[1:05:18] into view
[1:05:19] all of the insecurities all the doubts
[1:05:22] all the fears
[1:05:23] and then
[1:05:25] praise the lord
[1:05:26] i hope you'll say amen to this when i'm
[1:05:28] done
[1:05:29] the blame game
[1:05:31] begins
[1:05:34] the reason why i'm not an overcomer is
[1:05:37] our pastor don't preach deep enough
[1:05:41] well how deep do you want him to preach
[1:05:44] preach way off to where you still can't
[1:05:46] get over
[1:05:48] a lion spirit
[1:05:51] but we want to know the deep mysteries
[1:05:52] of god no it doesn't work my brother and
[1:05:54] sister brother branham addressed that
[1:05:56] so you see we come they come down there
[1:05:58] and they come face to face this looks
[1:06:00] like they come to a geographical
[1:06:02] obstacle that in reality they were
[1:06:05] coming face to face to themselves
[1:06:06] because the truth as we all know we've
[1:06:08] heard the prophet preach it they should
[1:06:09] have walked right down there the priest
[1:06:11] and and now you know all these men and
[1:06:13] they should have never stopped there
[1:06:15] shouldn't have been a faltering in their
[1:06:17] step there shouldn't have been a head
[1:06:18] looking back to say hey guys are we
[1:06:20] doing the right thing they should have
[1:06:21] just known this is the way to the
[1:06:23] promised land then god has already
[1:06:26] opened the door for us because it's
[1:06:28] prophetic and they should have just
[1:06:29] walked right down and as they walked
[1:06:31] right into that it would have opened up
[1:06:34] amen but what did they do
[1:06:37] was it moses that hindered them
[1:06:39] aaron
[1:06:40] no
[1:06:41] themselves
[1:06:43] they were free from egypt
[1:06:46] but they weren't free
[1:06:48] from their selves
[1:06:53] but brother branham says if god makes a
[1:06:55] promise in the word
[1:06:57] god will send that to back it up see we
[1:07:00] got nothing to fear saints
[1:07:02] what we got to do is just trust the word
[1:07:04] not look at ourself not look at anything
[1:07:06] around us trust the word so now we want
[1:07:09] to look at this that that moses now has
[1:07:11] led
[1:07:12] israel and it comes to us a time that
[1:07:15] moses is now off of the scene gone off
[1:07:18] of the scene and people are like oh my
[1:07:20] goodness our promise and everything is
[1:07:23] just it has just fell to ashes at our
[1:07:26] feet because moses was supposed to take
[1:07:28] us into the promised land so it is there
[1:07:31] that when the people become
[1:07:33] struck by this but it is in that time of
[1:07:36] need in that darkest hour didn't the
[1:07:38] prophet to emphasize that in the darkest
[1:07:40] of hours god comes on the scene and has
[1:07:43] an answer and you know for them my
[1:07:45] brother and sister if you go
[1:07:47] sorry
[1:07:48] um
[1:07:50] go back one please brother sorry i got
[1:07:53] my finger out of control
[1:07:56] now look what it starts out in joshua we
[1:07:58] already jumped ahead and joshua and
[1:08:00] joshua's chiding the people
[1:08:02] for their failure to move forward in the
[1:08:04] promise
[1:08:06] has nothing to do with geographical
[1:08:08] terrain
[1:08:09] has nothing to do with circumstances
[1:08:10] surrounding them it has to do with their
[1:08:14] position they have chose to possess in
[1:08:16] the promise
[1:08:18] now you'll see my brother and sister why
[1:08:20] there's a difference in spiritual
[1:08:21] maturity in people and churches is the
[1:08:24] degree that they choose to embrace the
[1:08:26] promise so if we embrace as it is a
[1:08:29] prosperity then we will find that we
[1:08:32] will see the benefactories of prosperity
[1:08:35] or what it might be intellectualism or
[1:08:37] whatever it is my brother and sister and
[1:08:39] some people say well we should just
[1:08:41] preach a simple message and they preach
[1:08:43] it so simple that they never move
[1:08:45] forward into the revealed word of the
[1:08:47] hour god didn't say hey i'm going to
[1:08:48] reveal the word for you to put it on a
[1:08:50] shelf somewhere i reveal the word for
[1:08:52] you to receive the revelation of that
[1:08:56] and that revelation to become so real to
[1:08:58] you that you step into that and possess
[1:09:01] what's been revealed to you
[1:09:03] see if we say god's revealed something
[1:09:05] to us and we never possess it and take
[1:09:08] action on it then i would question
[1:09:10] whether it's really been revealed
[1:09:11] because a real believer cannot help
[1:09:14] but step into every revealed promise of
[1:09:17] god and possess it and see it come to
[1:09:19] fruition in their life
[1:09:21] hallelujah
[1:09:22] so right here now joshua 1 1 now after
[1:09:26] the death of moses we all cried and
[1:09:28] cried and cried
[1:09:30] come on i hope you find the parallel for
[1:09:32] the day we live in
[1:09:35] now after the death of moses the servant
[1:09:37] of the lord it came to pass that the
[1:09:39] lord spake unto joshua the son of nun
[1:09:41] moses minister saying moses my servant
[1:09:44] is dead now therefore
[1:09:47] turn around
[1:09:49] go back to egypt and apologize
[1:09:53] no sir
[1:09:55] it was the word of the lord saints that
[1:09:57] said come out of her my people
[1:10:01] it was not a man's word it was not a
[1:10:04] man's ideology it was not a man trying
[1:10:07] to build a church i hope you get this it
[1:10:10] was god almighty they said come out of
[1:10:13] her my people and so it was there that a
[1:10:16] prophetic word come forth and was
[1:10:18] magnified and in that magnification
[1:10:21] there was a people that said if god
[1:10:22] spoke it then we must come out we must
[1:10:25] move forward
[1:10:27] moses my servant is dead now therefore
[1:10:29] arise and go over this jordan thou and
[1:10:32] all this people into the land which i do
[1:10:34] give to them even to the children of
[1:10:36] israel every place that the soul of your
[1:10:38] foot shall tread upon
[1:10:40] that have i given unto you as i said
[1:10:43] unto moses from the wilderness and this
[1:10:45] lebanon even into the great river the
[1:10:47] river euphrates which if you want a
[1:10:50] historical note right now
[1:10:52] according to prophecy
[1:10:54] is drying up
[1:10:59] study it
[1:11:00] go look at it
[1:11:02] prophetic word speaking
[1:11:04] and now we're seeing even with great
[1:11:06] dams
[1:11:07] on the euphrates and the tigris
[1:11:10] here's great looming
[1:11:12] masses of concrete
[1:11:14] and a river
[1:11:16] there's a little thin trickle
[1:11:18] down here
[1:11:20] god's word comes to pass saints
[1:11:22] god's word comes to
[1:11:24] pass soul of ephesus from the wilderness
[1:11:27] lebanon even into the great river river
[1:11:29] euphrates and all the land of the
[1:11:30] hittites and unto the great sea toward
[1:11:32] the going down of the sun shall be your
[1:11:34] coast there shall not any man be able to
[1:11:36] stand before thee all the days of thy
[1:11:38] life as i was with moses so i will be
[1:11:42] with thee i will not fail nor forsake
[1:11:45] thee now my brother and sister i
[1:11:46] personally believe let me just put it in
[1:11:48] that realm so you can just put it on the
[1:11:50] shelf if you don't like it i personally
[1:11:51] believe this is a direct parallel to our
[1:11:53] day
[1:11:58] be strong of good courage for unto this
[1:12:01] people shalt thou divide for an
[1:12:04] inheritance the land which i swear unto
[1:12:06] their fathers to give them only be thou
[1:12:09] strong and very courageous that thou
[1:12:11] mayest observe to do according to all
[1:12:13] the law which moses my servant commanded
[1:12:16] thee turn not from it to the right hand
[1:12:18] or to the left that thou mayest prosper
[1:12:20] whithersoever thou goest this book of
[1:12:23] the law shall not depart out of thy
[1:12:26] mouth now remember as we come into the
[1:12:28] new testament this is declared this is
[1:12:30] written on our heart so this is no
[1:12:32] longer us looking to a book and saying i
[1:12:35] must i must but now it is the holy
[1:12:37] spirit a god almighty anointed on our
[1:12:41] hearts speaking to us
[1:12:43] and people would say well do we really
[1:12:45] hear the voice of god in this day
[1:12:48] well i'll tell you my brother and sister
[1:12:50] if you read the word of god and the holy
[1:12:52] spirit moves you oh let me refrain that
[1:12:55] i'm prejudiced in my statement
[1:12:57] if you read the word of god
[1:12:59] and something moves you
[1:13:03] there's only two forces
[1:13:06] only two spirits
[1:13:08] and the devil's never going to anoint
[1:13:10] you to live a righteous and holy life
[1:13:13] so god is speaking to those naysayers
[1:13:16] that's saying well brother branham's off
[1:13:18] the scene god is no longer speaking
[1:13:21] i'm sorry saint you have missed not you
[1:13:23] but those people have missed clearly
[1:13:26] missed
[1:13:27] the opening of the word that the prophet
[1:13:29] was here for
[1:13:30] to make this and and i will touch on
[1:13:33] this if i can just get shifted somebody
[1:13:35] help me shift into a higher gear here
[1:13:37] amen so we look at this see so he's
[1:13:39] telling them to to be of good carriage
[1:13:41] be not afraid be not dismayed for the
[1:13:43] lord that god is with thee whether so
[1:13:45] ever thou goest now we see this my
[1:13:48] brother and sister you know these
[1:13:49] scriptures so you know kind of chomped
[1:13:51] them up but forgive me so we see what
[1:13:53] what is being spoken to joshua and we
[1:13:55] also know what prophet of god spoke to
[1:13:58] us about joshua what he was a type of he
[1:14:00] was not just moses's minister but this
[1:14:04] my brother and sister is the natural
[1:14:07] progression
[1:14:10] of the revealed word
[1:14:12] to deliver the people into the promise
[1:14:16] god didn't go over here and say now
[1:14:19] joshua's going to be here for just
[1:14:22] six weeks
[1:14:23] then we'll have a vote
[1:14:25] and we'll find someone else nor are we
[1:14:28] going to stop and i hope this doesn't
[1:14:30] offend anybody but nor are we going to
[1:14:32] stop here in this wilderness and build a
[1:14:34] gigantic memorial
[1:14:37] to moses
[1:14:38] and stay right here
[1:14:43] his commandment to joshua
[1:14:46] get up
[1:14:47] and go
[1:14:50] hallelujah i think i heard that
[1:14:52] i heard that thank you lord get up and
[1:14:54] go there's still a promised land
[1:14:57] right this was not at the deliverance of
[1:14:59] the promised land my brother sister this
[1:15:01] is still in the wilderness
[1:15:05] i hope you
[1:15:07] can read between the lines
[1:15:10] but look at this
[1:15:12] every word
[1:15:14] that the lord gave to moses
[1:15:17] was still ordained
[1:15:18] to be fulfilled
[1:15:21] not one word that was given to moses the
[1:15:23] prophet
[1:15:24] amen
[1:15:25] was to be shelved
[1:15:27] because we're under a new headship
[1:15:30] see that's a lot of false ministries are
[1:15:32] coming in the day we're living in and
[1:15:34] they're saying well look here this is
[1:15:35] what it is now that was then
[1:15:40] but this is now
[1:15:42] so hear me
[1:15:44] you know what we can do
[1:15:46] we can go back to the prophetic word
[1:15:49] because as it being thus saith the lord
[1:15:52] it must
[1:15:53] come
[1:15:54] to pass
[1:15:57] so you'll find these people when there's
[1:15:58] a lack of proper teaching proper
[1:16:00] leadership
[1:16:02] it would be as i've joked with you
[1:16:03] before we don't believe in acts 2 38 so
[1:16:05] we're going to tear it out of our bible
[1:16:07] well we don't believe in the anointing
[1:16:09] of the holy ghost or mark 16. when we
[1:16:11] get done we'll have a pocket-sized bible
[1:16:13] because we will have ripped so much out
[1:16:15] of it but you see every bit of this is
[1:16:17] still applicable right as we often
[1:16:19] paraphrase it not necessarily correctly
[1:16:22] in the wording of the scripture but my
[1:16:23] brother and sister
[1:16:25] jesus christ didn't come to do away with
[1:16:26] the law he come to magnify it he come to
[1:16:29] make it alive to you and i not do away
[1:16:31] with it
[1:16:33] and so
[1:16:34] well well i don't get sidetracked
[1:16:37] so every word that the lord gave to
[1:16:38] moses still ordained to be filled now
[1:16:40] look what happened is moses
[1:16:43] is bringing a ministry
[1:16:45] and if we're looking for a perfect
[1:16:47] prophet
[1:16:49] saints we're going to have to scratch
[1:16:51] moses out of the bible
[1:16:56] people in this day right here are
[1:16:57] looking for a perfect prophet
[1:17:00] they can accept moses's flaws
[1:17:03] they can expect
[1:17:05] accept all of the uh
[1:17:08] men through scripture we can accept his
[1:17:11] flaws but we're now in the 20 21st
[1:17:13] century and this prophet has to be
[1:17:16] perfect
[1:17:18] we cannot have any angry prophets
[1:17:21] we cannot have any prophets that were
[1:17:24] discouraged
[1:17:25] they must be perfect
[1:17:27] see how out of continuity people can get
[1:17:29] with the word of god they can come and
[1:17:31] say these are the rules and we're going
[1:17:33] to play by our rules and god said i
[1:17:35] don't care what you do with your rules
[1:17:36] i'm the one that set the rules i'm the
[1:17:38] one who said it in order amen so what
[1:17:42] happens is look at this now when when
[1:17:44] the lord speaks to joshua
[1:17:47] he doesn't say now joshua tell the
[1:17:49] people that day is done what does he do
[1:17:51] he seamlessly places joshua right into
[1:17:56] moses's ministry
[1:17:59] he doesn't whip out a gps and say moses
[1:18:01] had you off course we got to go over
[1:18:02] here
[1:18:04] no sir they were headed into the same
[1:18:06] promise
[1:18:07] and so it was
[1:18:10] joshua was actually magnification
[1:18:13] of the leadership god had he gave moses
[1:18:18] oh my brother and sister
[1:18:20] you look
[1:18:22] into the son of man ministry in our hour
[1:18:25] you look into the revealed word of our
[1:18:27] hour god is not stepping over here and
[1:18:29] then stepping over here and then
[1:18:31] correcting back over here it is one
[1:18:34] seamless stream of continuity of the
[1:18:36] word
[1:18:38] so when people dive off on this side and
[1:18:40] dive off on this side stop i beg you in
[1:18:42] the name of jesus christ stop and say
[1:18:44] where is the continuity of this
[1:18:46] joshua stepped right into moses's
[1:18:48] ministry and i'm declaring now that the
[1:18:51] ministry of our day hallelujah that god
[1:18:54] has ordained will seamlessly step into
[1:18:57] the prophet of our day's ministry and
[1:18:59] carry it right on
[1:19:01] hallelujah
[1:19:03] now look
[1:19:04] he was to pass this way amen brothers i
[1:19:07] don't know my finger is not working
[1:19:10] if we could go to the next quote oh
[1:19:12] maybe i have to push that down there
[1:19:13] excuse me
[1:19:16] i'm sure happy i hope you just catch
[1:19:18] this out of this it just kind of spoke
[1:19:19] to me
[1:19:20] i am sure happy to have good friends
[1:19:22] somebody say amen
[1:19:24] people who believe
[1:19:26] that might be where we find good friends
[1:19:28] with people who believe
[1:19:30] and believe the efforts that you're
[1:19:32] trying to put forth if i had any other
[1:19:34] objective just merely to be different
[1:19:37] why i would be a real sinner
[1:19:40] but my objective
[1:19:42] is to magnify
[1:19:44] jesus christ
[1:19:46] so the prophet now has declared the only
[1:19:48] thing i want to raise up in front of you
[1:19:52] is jesus christ
[1:19:55] interesting
[1:19:56] and something
[1:19:58] that's in a man
[1:20:00] when you have a message from god
[1:20:02] you cannot stop yourself
[1:20:04] there is something in you pulsating it
[1:20:07] goes on anyhow you can't slow it up stop
[1:20:09] it or start it it stops and starts and
[1:20:12] slows you up see it's the one
[1:20:15] that has control
[1:20:17] amen and we live in an hour i'm going to
[1:20:19] just make a very very direct statement
[1:20:21] we live in an hour that people say the
[1:20:23] fivefold ministry is just there to push
[1:20:26] their agenda on the message
[1:20:32] you know what it is
[1:20:33] they don't believe the one
[1:20:36] has control
[1:20:38] they believe man is in control
[1:20:41] whoa hallelujah come on amen
[1:20:47] but my objective
[1:20:50] is to magnify
[1:20:52] jesus christ and i will punctuate that
[1:20:54] with an amen punctuate it with that's
[1:20:57] what my heart cries that's what i
[1:20:59] believe that's what i see and i hope
[1:21:01] that's what you get when you hear me
[1:21:02] preach amen no other no other idea or
[1:21:07] ideology
[1:21:08] amen now i'm going to cut out a few
[1:21:10] little notes here and we're just going
[1:21:12] to go right to god's provided way
[1:21:14] little did those egyptian slaves know
[1:21:17] meaning israel when they stood on the
[1:21:19] bank after seeing the great revival that
[1:21:21] the prophet come down and brought to
[1:21:22] them they'd seen the mighty hand of god
[1:21:25] and they'd been protected and come out
[1:21:27] there and dancing in the spirit after
[1:21:29] they'd crossed through the red sea isn't
[1:21:31] this it was like a modern day oh i hope
[1:21:34] this don't offend you i'm going to say
[1:21:36] it anyhow
[1:21:37] we got folks
[1:21:39] that they have a revival
[1:21:40] oh hallelujah
[1:21:43] and then the revival's over
[1:21:45] hmm
[1:21:48] and it's like i don't even know if i'm a
[1:21:49] christian i don't even know if i'm a
[1:21:51] christian i will lord help me help me
[1:21:53] another revival
[1:21:56] and it goes on and on and on
[1:21:59] go study your bible i challenge you go
[1:22:02] study your bible through the pastor the
[1:22:04] wilderness of sin and israel lived from
[1:22:06] the supernatural to the supernatural and
[1:22:09] the lows were really low
[1:22:13] but remind you of this
[1:22:15] when the rows are really low and we've
[1:22:17] all had them somebody have courage
[1:22:19] enough to say yep we've had them but the
[1:22:21] lows are really low but you've got to
[1:22:24] climb a long ways
[1:22:26] to get back to the top right and god
[1:22:29] says you know what if you'll just trust
[1:22:31] me
[1:22:32] you don't have to go down there
[1:22:34] you can stay here
[1:22:36] in the spirit
[1:22:38] amen
[1:22:40] imagine if the holy spirit moved like
[1:22:42] our spirit moved
[1:22:43] we'd be in trouble
[1:22:45] we'd be in real trouble saints
[1:22:49] but they were dancing in the spirit
[1:22:50] after they crossed the red sea and
[1:22:51] seeing their enemies drown behind them
[1:22:53] all their habits and things see what
[1:22:55] brother brown's talking about
[1:22:58] not everyone was
[1:23:00] delivered
[1:23:02] from themselves
[1:23:04] seeing their enemies drown behind them
[1:23:06] all their habits and things like we'd
[1:23:08] call today drown behind them the things
[1:23:10] that torment them and miriam dancing in
[1:23:12] the spirit and moses singing in the
[1:23:14] spirit and so forth little did they know
[1:23:16] that when they was only about 10 days
[1:23:18] from the promised land knowing that they
[1:23:20] were 40 years away from it
[1:23:24] it just looked so good didn't it saints
[1:23:26] come on
[1:23:27] now we can take words now don't
[1:23:29] misunderstand me i trust those of you
[1:23:30] who know me know me amen but the prophet
[1:23:33] of god i believe the coming of the lord
[1:23:35] is right around the corner i believe it
[1:23:37] could even be this year i believe it
[1:23:40] can't be this much more time it can't be
[1:23:43] and people grasp at those things and
[1:23:45] when
[1:23:46] the years or
[1:23:49] tick
[1:23:50] tick
[1:23:51] tick
[1:23:52] tick
[1:23:59] and some said you know
[1:24:00] what the prophet of god said
[1:24:06] 78
[1:24:09] nothing happened
[1:24:11] 78
[1:24:14] this message is false
[1:24:18] 77
[1:24:20] sorry yeah
[1:24:23] huh
[1:24:25] yeah that's when the year was over i
[1:24:26] guess you could take that maybe i wasn't
[1:24:28] wrong thank you lord thank you brother
[1:24:30] david
[1:24:31] but you know what i mean is it this
[1:24:33] place and time tick-tick
[1:24:38] i know brothers older brothers they
[1:24:41] lived through that and they said
[1:24:42] literally the churches emptied out
[1:24:46] the people that said oh
[1:24:49] that's false
[1:24:52] but you see what they were doing as they
[1:24:54] were looking at the wrong detail yeah
[1:24:58] maybe what the prophet of god saw
[1:25:00] was the thinning out of the church
[1:25:03] maybe he saw that there would be a
[1:25:05] season and this was necessary i don't
[1:25:07] know you know what i find interesting
[1:25:10] i'm getting lost but forgive me you know
[1:25:12] what i find interesting
[1:25:13] people who don't even know their own
[1:25:16] mind are explaining god
[1:25:22] how can that be
[1:25:27] ten days from promised land knowing that
[1:25:29] they were 40 years away from it why
[1:25:30] because they refused to follow god they
[1:25:33] wanted a law instead of grace and they
[1:25:35] got it so they could make their own way
[1:25:37] and have their own so and so man's
[1:25:39] always tried to do something by himself
[1:25:41] and god let every one of them perish in
[1:25:44] the wild
[1:25:44] and raised up and i'm going to shout
[1:25:46] because i believe we are that generation
[1:25:49] raised up a new generation my brother
[1:25:51] and sister that wasn't looking oh don't
[1:25:54] misunderstand me tonight i pray wasn't
[1:25:56] looking to say we were with the prophet
[1:25:58] we were with the prophet we hunted we
[1:26:00] fished we traveled my brother and sister
[1:26:02] the word says blessed are we having not
[1:26:05] seen believe
[1:26:08] amen so it's there that we didn't have
[1:26:10] that experience but we now have a
[1:26:12] holy ghost revealed experience that we
[1:26:16] are looking at and it's a real
[1:26:17] experience to us
[1:26:19] no man can pluck it out of our hand and
[1:26:21] out of our heart no man can explain what
[1:26:24] god has done to us and for us playing it
[1:26:26] away they can say whale biss and whale
[1:26:28] that my brother and sister you're too
[1:26:30] late
[1:26:31] you're too late god's come on the scene
[1:26:33] he's he's a prayer answering god he's a
[1:26:36] delivering god he's a providing god he's
[1:26:39] a holy ghost that is cleansing us with
[1:26:41] the fire of his word amen of the holy
[1:26:44] spirit and it's there we know that is
[1:26:46] real and the naysayer can say there is
[1:26:49] no promised land imagine i want to put
[1:26:50] this right before we move on there would
[1:26:52] be people standing in the congregation
[1:26:54] of israel brother trevor and they would
[1:26:56] have come to that 40 years in the
[1:26:58] wilderness not knowing that just over
[1:26:59] that little mountain range was the
[1:27:01] promised land and they'd be saying i
[1:27:02] don't even think there's a promised land
[1:27:05] i think they brought us out here
[1:27:07] just another religion
[1:27:09] as it was in the days of our fathers
[1:27:13] and people are like yeah
[1:27:16] so if this i hope you get this
[1:27:19] if this is all there is to life
[1:27:22] then i'm going to go whoop it up
[1:27:24] and i'm just going to live it up and i'm
[1:27:26] going to just jump into the big pool of
[1:27:29] sin
[1:27:31] see something was missing
[1:27:34] because the real believer
[1:27:36] anointed under a joshua ministry
[1:27:40] said god said there was a promised land
[1:27:42] i don't care if i can see a trace of a
[1:27:44] promised land i don't care if we've ever
[1:27:45] seen a speck of dust from a promised
[1:27:47] land or if i've ever seen a messenger
[1:27:49] that's been to a promised land god said
[1:27:52] there's a promised land and he said he's
[1:27:53] taking me there
[1:27:55] they would be looking at no escape route
[1:27:57] no shortcut no whatever they would be
[1:27:59] saying no god said it i believe it i
[1:28:01] will stand upon that
[1:28:03] see man's always tried to do something
[1:28:05] by himself and god let every one of them
[1:28:07] perish why because they wouldn't go
[1:28:10] god's provided way
[1:28:12] now little did the pentecostal there's
[1:28:14] pretty strong words here
[1:28:15] little did the pentecostal church know
[1:28:17] of 40 or 50 years ago when you were
[1:28:19] dancing in the spirit and them old
[1:28:20] long-haired mothers long dresses on that
[1:28:23] their daughters would ever be hollywood
[1:28:25] queens
[1:28:26] as they try to be today
[1:28:29] see saints this is why i don't want to
[1:28:30] impose my will upon this church
[1:28:33] but i feel compelled
[1:28:35] things like the shoes and certain kinds
[1:28:37] of dresses and blouses and all these
[1:28:39] kind of things for the sisters and and
[1:28:40] i'm just as judgmental and i'll just
[1:28:42] admit this is just something in me i
[1:28:44] don't think a brother ought to walk
[1:28:45] around with a shirt undone down here
[1:28:47] because to a sister that might just be
[1:28:50] uh just as much in a carnal way an
[1:28:52] influence to them right we're called to
[1:28:53] be righteous people we're called to be
[1:28:55] holy people we're called to be according
[1:28:56] to the word
[1:28:58] amen not some rule for them an exception
[1:29:01] for us but god's got a rule as it would
[1:29:04] if you put that word of holiness
[1:29:06] and it's not a not a rule it's a
[1:29:09] amen
[1:29:11] so you look at that and
[1:29:13] my
[1:29:15] little did they know
[1:29:17] when men of integrity godly men who
[1:29:19] would die for that word stand under
[1:29:21] gunfire and everything else called holy
[1:29:23] roller thrown in jail throwing the
[1:29:24] street corner run off on one corner and
[1:29:27] be on the
[1:29:28] other one uh bringing the gospel that
[1:29:30] their sons would even permit such a
[1:29:31] thing to come to bring the churches into
[1:29:33] a place like the rest of the
[1:29:36] denomination see what happened here
[1:29:40] just
[1:29:41] a generation
[1:29:43] look how close this is just a generation
[1:29:48] now i don't want to sound judgmental
[1:29:50] but the generation previous to us
[1:29:54] testifying
[1:29:58] they'll live by their testimony
[1:30:01] or be judged by their testimony
[1:30:04] but we have a problem saints
[1:30:07] we're looking back to that generation
[1:30:10] thinking their position in christ
[1:30:13] is our testimony
[1:30:18] i hope you see this i'm keeping it in
[1:30:20] simplicity
[1:30:22] their testimony
[1:30:24] will only be our testimony the faithful
[1:30:27] will only be our testimony
[1:30:29] if our testimony
[1:30:31] is kept faithful
[1:30:33] it won't be
[1:30:34] my daddy knew
[1:30:37] we were here we were there this happened
[1:30:40] to us
[1:30:41] prophet prayed for me as a child these
[1:30:43] kind of things that we see in this day
[1:30:45] and age yes i'm speaking kind of direct
[1:30:47] saints forgive me but look at this that
[1:30:49] isn't going to matter
[1:30:51] old daddy that saintly dad that saintly
[1:30:54] mother they've died they've gone to
[1:30:56] their reward and people are living in
[1:30:57] this generation off of that testimony
[1:30:59] that's right we have to have our own
[1:31:01] testimony we have to testify of the
[1:31:04] gospel of jesus christ the unerring
[1:31:07] fulfilling word of our day and our life
[1:31:10] has to be the testimony that verifies
[1:31:12] that
[1:31:14] hallelujah 40 years
[1:31:18] oh my 40 years they've been look at the
[1:31:20] type
[1:31:21] 40 years
[1:31:23] but there's a new one coming up
[1:31:25] i hope this stirs your heart like it did
[1:31:27] mine as i'm studying this
[1:31:29] after 40 years
[1:31:31] a new one's coming up
[1:31:33] god will restore
[1:31:36] saith god somebody that will walk in the
[1:31:39] spirit
[1:31:40] bringing the truth tell the truth
[1:31:42] joshua jehovah's savior
[1:31:45] led them across jordan
[1:31:48] you know what it was
[1:31:49] we know what the prophet said
[1:31:52] joshua was a representation of jesus
[1:31:54] christ
[1:31:55] look at the hour we're living in my
[1:31:56] brother and sister it's not going to be
[1:31:58] this great pastor this evangelist this
[1:32:00] great man here this person is the man of
[1:32:02] this continent and this is the person of
[1:32:04] the man of the continent it is the jesus
[1:32:06] christ jehovah leading you and i into
[1:32:10] our promised land it is the holy ghost
[1:32:12] it will not be is there a fivefold
[1:32:14] ministry is there a ministry on the
[1:32:16] earth today absolutely i'll believe it
[1:32:19] with all my life i'll read you a quote
[1:32:20] in just a moment but my brother and
[1:32:22] sister without that we can sit in the
[1:32:24] most holy ghost-filled church on the
[1:32:26] face of the earth and without the holy
[1:32:28] ghost
[1:32:30] we might as well be in a bar room
[1:32:33] that sounds harsh doesn't it
[1:32:35] we might as well be in the park
[1:32:37] we might as well be anywhere else
[1:32:40] but when you come to the place
[1:32:43] think about it katie's barnea
[1:32:46] something the lord stirred my heart so
[1:32:48] many years ago i've never been able to
[1:32:50] get away from that
[1:32:52] okay dysparnia
[1:33:00] laodicea is too wicked
[1:33:03] the devil's too tricky we won't be able
[1:33:04] to keep our children
[1:33:07] but praise the lord our children will go
[1:33:09] out
[1:33:10] and they'll be caught up in the world
[1:33:11] and they'll be defiled
[1:33:13] they'll be torn down they'll be scarred
[1:33:16] but we're going to apply the token and
[1:33:17] god will bring our children back
[1:33:20] and they'll be saved
[1:33:23] sounds good doesn't it
[1:33:25] unless of course you've got the holy
[1:33:26] ghost
[1:33:28] and then we're going to stand and say
[1:33:30] satan
[1:33:31] take your hands
[1:33:32] off of our children
[1:33:34] our children are sealed by the blood of
[1:33:36] jesus christ and we have a ring of fire
[1:33:40] around them they're not your satan you
[1:33:43] don't get to defile them you don't get
[1:33:45] to mark their life you don't get to have
[1:33:47] your way with them because these are
[1:33:49] sons and daughters of god
[1:33:51] but the other one's like well we just
[1:33:53] have to let them go i've heard this
[1:33:54] saints out of the mouth of believers
[1:33:56] well
[1:33:58] my daughter's working on her testimony
[1:34:02] seriously
[1:34:05] you know what the problem is
[1:34:06] please don't think i'm being harsh
[1:34:09] there's no cry there
[1:34:12] mama has resigned herself
[1:34:15] daddy has resigned himself
[1:34:19] my children
[1:34:20] are caught up in the grips of the devil
[1:34:23] there's nothing i can do
[1:34:27] that's
[1:34:28] the devil speaking amen
[1:34:33] do i need to belabor that or is it
[1:34:35] obvious
[1:34:36] hallelujah
[1:34:38] you see my brother and sister it comes
[1:34:40] down to the point we have to decide
[1:34:42] who's leading us
[1:34:44] amen we have to decide what's happening
[1:34:47] we have to decide
[1:34:49] whether
[1:34:50] a wife a husband
[1:34:52] children or parents a brother or a
[1:34:55] sister or a friend
[1:34:58] is worth
[1:34:59] crying for
[1:35:02] or do we resign ourselves
[1:35:07] you imagine if they caught the
[1:35:08] revelation that god's given to you and i
[1:35:11] katish barnia
[1:35:13] if they had caught the revelation that
[1:35:14] god has granted to you and i saints
[1:35:17] when joshua
[1:35:19] got up there and said
[1:35:21] we have a promise i'm just paraphrasing
[1:35:22] make the point we have a promise
[1:35:25] it doesn't matter yes they're right
[1:35:27] every one of these ministers that said
[1:35:28] that the giants are big and this and
[1:35:30] that they're all right
[1:35:32] but we have a promise
[1:35:34] rise up now possess the land what would
[1:35:38] have happened saints if israel would
[1:35:41] amen
[1:35:44] later rose up the very next morning
[1:35:46] maybe even that night i don't know and
[1:35:48] they would have went and possessed the
[1:35:49] land
[1:35:50] but you know what they did
[1:35:53] they listened
[1:35:55] oh pardon me for using this word but i
[1:35:57] just can't find another word
[1:35:59] they listen to these panty waste
[1:36:01] preachers
[1:36:04] well
[1:36:06] our young people are facing very
[1:36:08] challenging times with music and
[1:36:10] clothing and peer pressure and i'm
[1:36:13] afraid if i get down in the face of our
[1:36:16] young people and tell them they need the
[1:36:19] holy ghost that they're never going to
[1:36:22] come back to church
[1:36:25] well it will
[1:36:27] if i just go ahead and slap gabriella
[1:36:34] i know i can get away with this she's my
[1:36:35] adopted granddaughter and
[1:36:37] family you know they can't really get
[1:36:39] away from you
[1:36:42] but what if and i'm just preaching
[1:36:44] saints i'm not making a point
[1:36:46] what if i remind her
[1:36:48] how much i love her how much she means
[1:36:50] to me but you have to have the holy
[1:36:53] ghost
[1:36:54] you can't leave
[1:36:56] these worldly things in your life you've
[1:36:59] got to get rid of them you've got to get
[1:37:02] washed in the fountain in the house of
[1:37:05] david and people are so afraid of losing
[1:37:08] their young people that they're losing
[1:37:10] their young people
[1:37:12] i would rather take the risk of looking
[1:37:15] them in the face and as i said i can do
[1:37:16] that with gabriella because i know
[1:37:18] she'll forgive me because she loves me
[1:37:20] but i want to do that to every one of
[1:37:22] our young people
[1:37:24] every one of you
[1:37:26] older vika
[1:37:27] gideon titus
[1:37:29] heidi shawn
[1:37:30] every one of you
[1:37:33] my own granddaughter
[1:37:35] because i want you to know
[1:37:36] there is a life
[1:37:39] amen we don't have to stop and say the
[1:37:41] enemy's too big we don't have to stop
[1:37:43] and say oh but we're not able we don't
[1:37:46] have enough revelation i'm sorry i got
[1:37:49] prophetic word that says everything you
[1:37:50] need to make the rapture is already
[1:37:52] inside of you and i believe that word
[1:37:55] and i'm going to stand on that word and
[1:37:57] i'm going to believe that god is taking
[1:37:58] me to the rapture and taking you to the
[1:38:00] rapture my brother and sister enough
[1:38:03] that i will stand up and be a witness
[1:38:05] of this gospel this message of the hour
[1:38:08] i will be a witness and god hold me
[1:38:10] accountable for my position as a witness
[1:38:12] but beyond my human failure i can find
[1:38:16] grace at calvary i can be covered with
[1:38:18] the blood and i can press forward to say
[1:38:20] amen to the word because there is a
[1:38:22] promised land for sons and daughters to
[1:38:24] go to
[1:38:25] hallelujah
[1:38:27] hallelujah
[1:38:28] let me just go into this
[1:38:31] god hiding if you come sister ruth
[1:38:34] god hiding himself in simplicity
[1:38:38] now i love this
[1:38:40] you see there's a lot of conflicting
[1:38:42] a lot of conflicting ideas in the land
[1:38:44] today and
[1:38:45] men of great stature and influence are
[1:38:47] behind some of these ideologies
[1:38:50] uh but this is the i'd all the ideology
[1:38:53] saints that i want you to embrace i can
[1:38:55] encourage you to embrace something i
[1:38:56] want you to embrace this
[1:38:58] first of all here i encourage you go
[1:39:00] read before and after
[1:39:05] god won't leave his program
[1:39:09] what he done for them
[1:39:11] he'll do for us
[1:39:14] the grace and mercy poured out upon them
[1:39:17] he will pour out upon us
[1:39:19] his spirit that he poured out upon them
[1:39:21] he will pour out upon us
[1:39:24] hallelujah
[1:39:26] [Music]
[1:39:27] god won't leave his program that's the
[1:39:28] reason we know that this day it's got to
[1:39:30] be simple
[1:39:31] see now he works in simplicity but god
[1:39:34] in the beginning
[1:39:35] that could have made the sun preach the
[1:39:37] gospel
[1:39:38] or the winds preach the gospel
[1:39:41] or an angel
[1:39:42] preached the gospel
[1:39:45] but he ordained men for that purpose
[1:39:49] and he never
[1:39:51] changes that amen
[1:39:54] regardless of what man's idea might be
[1:39:57] my brother and sister
[1:39:58] [Music]
[1:40:00] and you'll notice
[1:40:02] he never said man
[1:40:05] it's plural
[1:40:10] he never ordained he never ordained
[1:40:12] denominations he never ordained groups
[1:40:15] of men he never ordained men to preach
[1:40:17] the gospel i mean he ordained men to
[1:40:20] preach the gospel not machinery
[1:40:24] mechanical devices
[1:40:26] or any
[1:40:28] angelic being
[1:40:30] it was man
[1:40:34] now i want you to catch this the real
[1:40:36] emphasis i'm actually making
[1:40:38] is not what you might think
[1:40:42] it's right here
[1:40:44] in this first line
[1:40:46] god
[1:40:48] see i could
[1:40:49] quote this quote very political
[1:40:52] very pointed
[1:40:54] but i'll be honest with you
[1:40:56] the very
[1:40:57] meaning of this to me is right there in
[1:40:59] that first sentence god will never leave
[1:41:03] his program
[1:41:05] let me just close this out
[1:41:07] when he stood right there and spoke in
[1:41:09] egypt and said i will bring you out and
[1:41:12] i will take you in
[1:41:15] in every age right down to our day
[1:41:18] i will bring you out
[1:41:20] i will take you in
[1:41:22] god
[1:41:23] does not change his program
[1:41:26] we don't have to compromise we don't
[1:41:27] have to soften it we don't have to coat
[1:41:29] it in butter chocolate or whatever else
[1:41:31] we can do this we can preach a gospel
[1:41:34] preach it in love
[1:41:36] and the desire in the heart and soul of
[1:41:38] sons and daughters of god will draw them
[1:41:41] to the word
[1:41:42] aren't you glad
[1:41:44] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:41:48] oh my thank you lord thank you lord
[1:41:51] let's just stand and worship the lord
[1:41:53] for just a few short minutes before we
[1:41:54] go home
[1:41:56] amen i trust that i didn't leave any uh
[1:41:59] uncovered or uh confusing things there
[1:42:02] saint says that's what happens when paul
[1:42:05] tries to compress a lot of thoughts into
[1:42:07] a short time
[1:42:09] amen days and days and days of thoughts
[1:42:11] are hard to just speak in a little bit
[1:42:14] of time
[1:42:15] amen
[1:42:17] listening that song i will praise him
[1:42:20] that's what we're here for saints is to
[1:42:22] just lift our hands and our hearts to
[1:42:23] praise
[1:42:24] our lord amen
[1:42:26] joshua jehovah
[1:42:28] amen has come down he's right here in
[1:42:30] our midst and he said you know what i'm
[1:42:32] going to lead you through another
[1:42:33] wilderness
[1:42:35] i always thought as a young boy when i
[1:42:37] read my bible i thought

[1:42:41] sin

[1:42:45] name and i got a little older and i
[1:42:47] figured this out saints

[1:42:54] and that blade of sin and that tree of
[1:42:56] sin and that whatever of sin is just a
