as well scheduled for surgery tomorrow it's tomorrow okay so tomorrow brother manasseh will be in in for surgery so let's just remember him as in our daily prayers and lord we just touch him and i was thinking as we were getting ready for song service i always like to what song should we sing before we bring our pastor up and i know our pastor loves this song number 11 56 listen to our hearts hear our spirits saying amen as we just prepare for the word how do you explain how do you describe the love that goes from east to west and runs as deep as it is when words cannot express the love we feel what we long for you to hear so listen to our hearts hear our spirits sing the song of praise that flows from those you have redeemed [Applause] [Music] we will use the words we know to tell you what an awesome god you are words are not enough to tell you of our love just listen to our hearts if words could fall like rain from these lips of mine and if i had a thousand years i would still run out of time so if you listen to my heart oh every people say thank you for the life thank you for the truth thank you for the way our hearts hear our spirit sing the song of praise that flows from those you have redeemed and we will use the words we know to tell you what an awesome god you are when words are not enough to tell you of our love just listen to uh now make a personal listen to my heart pull this into my heart hear my spirit sing the song of praise that flows from those you have redeemed and i will use the words i know to tell you what an awesome god you are when words are not enough to tell you of my love just listen to my heart one more time [Music] from those you have god you are when words are not enough to tell you what i love just listen to my heart oh how do you explain how do you describe the love that goes from east runs as deep as it is we feel but we long for you to my spirits a song of praise that flows from those you have use redeemed words i know to tell you what an awesome god you are when words are not enough to tell you of my love just listen to my heart hallelujah can we say amen this morning hallelujah lord just listen to our hearts oh hallelujah hallelujah you know saints i'm just visiting with sister jerry kind of took yesterday afternoon off just to rest up and you know we make mistakes every day prophet of god encourages us he says you know what you need to repent every day hallelujah amen so when you look at this and realize that god already recognized the weakness of humanity don't let your weakness control you [Music] come on saints i want to make that emphasis this morning i don't care what issue you have in your life what issue you have in your family don't let your weakness control you [Music] because if you do you might as well run up the white flag right now and walk out [Music] because the prophet of god showed us satan studies you now get this none of you here today including my own wife would say brother paul knows every detail of my life right can't but the prophet of god showed us how satan studied you [Music] he knows your every weakness and if you don't believe that the enemy would not exploit the weakness then you are delusional so what's he going to do saints he's going to come into your life into your family into your marriage into your relationship with your children or your parents your relationship with brothers and sisters and he's going to find that one weakness and he's going to exploit it he's going to come in and say you know what here is the one place they have fear here is the one place that they they have some kind of complex nobody loves me nobody cares about me [Music] hallelujah oh there's power in the name of jesus amen he's our strong tower that's our that's our only place you see we can live on any continent any nation under any circumstance [Music] that will not just exempt you from satan attacking him so we can all pack up right now move to the wilderness satan will still be there or we can seek the strong tower the refuge we can get into him the prophet of god talking about he is our rest he is our peace sabbath is not a day it's our position in jesus christ if you're unhappy this morning no one around you let me just drive this home to you if you are unhappy this morning no one around you can bring you peace [Music] only him only him can we say only him hallelujah that's the only place we will find peace is in him amen oh hallelujah well brother alex is probably brother paul are you ever going to preach on that big thing that you've laid out before us i am actually i'm just choosing or feeling led to preach on those that are sold out and not those that have opted out the compromise my brother and sister never brings the full reward there's no recompense of reward for the compromiser i possessed all of it you know my father taught me when i first started in business many years ago my father drove home to me this idea he said paul it's not yours if you owe even one dollar against it saints this rest the sabbath jesus christ is not ours unless we are completely sold out hallelujah oh my god i could preach a sermon as a prie to the sermon i want to preach amen when our potential becomes reality saints is what we're going to talk about today uh may god just deal with our hearts you see jesus christ is our absolute if he is not our absolute now i want to just lay this out the word of god says that our relationship we'll touch on this today our relationship with one another is as the relationship that we are in christ so we as a body of believers let's go specifically to husband and wife the word says that they uh leave all things and uh become one right they leave father and mother and they leave all of that and they become one now the word of god shows us and we'll deal with this today lord willing how that we come and we were of him but we're separated from that now what does satan want to do my brother and sister you look at this in the spiritual bring it right all the way down to the family all the way down in humanity satan is always working to separate you don't ever see satan come to someone and say you know what you need to do you need to pray more you need to read your bible more what he does is he gives us reason to be angry or upset or distracted and then he magnifies that and and what happens is the separation becomes greater but i tell you what i serve a god who specializes in putting things back together hallelujah and we'll we'll if i ever get started here we'll get started amen let's just turn in our bibles this morning to the book of romans the eighth chapter uh would you just if you would please repeat after me this morning my prayer makes a difference hallelujah amen you've got to believe that saints now as i was studying for this i kept kind of reaching out to the lord lord what would encapsulate i guess when i would want to share today and i feel like the lord led me to romans 8 14 for as many as are led you realize that everyone's led yes we're led by one of two spirits amen everyone is led so right here he is speaking to the romans now let me interject this i have a quote but i won't read it this morning it'll get drawn out but my brother and sister when the apostle paul was taken to the backside of the desert god did not remind the apostle paul that you have persecuted the church he did not come down on him and say you know what you're not worthy of this that adversary that kept bringing that up in paul's mind was the devil amen but what he did is he took paul and run him through his particular circumstance of his life and part of that was because the power of god was going to be manifested in paul and god gave him the ingredient to keep him humble oh my imagine what some of us would be if god did not give us an ingredient to keep us humble oh hallelujah say thank you lord amen because there's nothing worse that's the word of god says nothing worse than an arrogant spirit amen that will lead you into all kinds of strife for as many as are led by the spirit of god amen we could say this is the holy ghost right because it's all god right and his spirit come down upon you and i amen that's our leadership but it's god amen led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit oh we're into spirits this morning you've not received a spirit of bondage again to fear but have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father or my father my father the spirit itself now look how closely my brother and sister we have to be identified with this spirit the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit now look we can't say we have the holy ghost and have a spirit contrary to the spirit of god amen whoa i want you to think about that that could be about a year's topic right there amen amen it bears witnesses that we are the children of god something inside of us is compelling and drawing us and we identify amen look at look saints i don't want to be distracted today just lots of thoughts going through my mind but just stop for a moment and think of all the things that you could be identified with today i like motorcycles and things that go fast just think about that just in one little realm all the things you could be identified with but this holy ghost comes upon us and identifies us as sons and daughters of god wow and you know just for an example not advocating anything but just for an example you can be identified in jesus christ and still ride a motorcycle isn't that right brother tim amen you don't backslide because you get on the bike right but if you put the bike first you're already backslid all things have to be in perspective excuse me you're all standing aren't you and if children then heirs and heirs of god and joint heirs with christ as so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory put them on the scale saints suffering in glory which shall be revealed come on words matter do they not words matter it doesn't say be revealed to us no catch that not to us it would be revealed in us hallelujah see a lot of people are going to be able to say god sent a prophet in this age a lot of people are going to be able to say that the holy spirit has come down and moved in our day but if it's not revealed in them oh look at that night and day difference right there not just to you in you for the earnest expectation of the creature which brother branham shows us his creation for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god heavenly father we just ask you today lord amen father come down and speak to us lord let it only be according to thy word bind us father from any other thought or idea or word lord that the saints could come today including myself in that body and rejoice as we worship in your presence we ask you now to come speak to us in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you you may be seated you know i believe his brother kidri diggs made the statement he said you know we come to church and he says that we come and through song and and these things we give praise and worship to the lord he said now is the time that we give worship to the lord in the word that's right hallelujah songs are great song service is great i thought we were going to have a song special this morning but i guess that didn't happen amen but you know look at these things my brother and sister i want to come and i want to worship the lord in the word today amen i want to dive right into the word of god and when god wants a punctuation and i'm not looking for amens don't misunderstand but when god wants a punctuation of his word he wants you to say i agree with that amen i identify with that amen then go ahead feel free however you want to punctuate that amen just let god know you agree amen now as we'll look at this i want to just take out of this 19th verse if i really took all that i want to express out of this this morning uh we we wouldn't get anywhere as it were but i just want to take out the verse 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature or creation waited for the manifestation of the sons of god amen now i want to just bring to you in in from webster online amen manifestation a sign that shows something clearly so let's just put that right in here the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for a sign that shows something clearly of the sons of god amen you see something's got to happen first this bride of christ must come to a maturity she must come to a place right that she is not a babe amen that a man marries and then waits to grow up that's just wrong amen so you look at this and realize that there's something that must be shown also in there it says one of the forms that something has when it appears or occurs occurs amen an occurrence in which the spirit of a dead person appears you see we're not concerned with all that webster had to say that's right hallelujah we'll come to halloween there's all kinds of spirits and whatever that they put out there and whatever now i'm just going to express this as an opinion okay i'm not going to try and make it a church doctrine but i'll tell you what i don't find much reason to celebrate the night of the living dead amen i have no reason to celebrate the ghouls and the ghosts and whatever although casper was a friendly ghost but you see my brother and sister when we look at a manifestation we must always remember there's two spirits in the framework of the church and so while the word of god has called for a bride to be manifested amen there is also the anti-type or counter type being manifested amen so you look at that now i want to jump right down here a little farther in webster's definition a perceptible outward or visible expression amen so creation is waiting for a perceptible something that can actually be measured or seen outward or visible expression of the sons of god amen now let's jump down into another part of this it is a public demonstration of power and purpose you see my brother and sister we are not going to be a bride that is hid as it were in secret amen there will be an outward change and outward expression amen it will be perceptible you won't hold it in and look like the world act like the world smell like the world talk like the world and say i'm a christian there will be an expression of the spirit of god amen the holy ghost cannot come in you without changing you amen i believe it was either spurgeon or tozer all the way back years and years ago said there would come a time that people would claim i'm paraphrasing it would claim to have god and be able to remain as they are tell me we're not in that time we're in this season that people say i've got the holy ghost but they don't change you cannot have the holy ghost and not change amen now i want to go into the book of revelations here to kind of revelation to kind of lay out a little foundation as we further our thought today now revelation 5 1 and i saw in the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and i wept much remember this is john speaking and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not oh come on my brother and sister we're here today weep not i don't care what your circumstance is weep not amen he's on the scene amen hallelujah behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david half prevail to open the book and to lose the seven seals thereof now i'm going to make a statement here you know i hope i don't offend anybody but i'm going to grind some of these axes till i'm done with them till i feel like the god's there we had a great big fuss in this church about the seals being open or closed now this is going to be direct and the people that maybe would listen i i'm sorry don't mean to offend you but my brother and sister we are not going to sit still and let people come into our midst and tell us what we believe amen we have a revelation from god it was not now this is not going to be my sermon today but my brother and sister there is so much difference between being taught and it being revealed and i will never again as your pastor i apologize i will never again stand and let something a spirit rise up in our church and tell us we're here you're wrong you change hallelujah in fact i've been praying about maybe we have a paper for people who when they come into our church just to hand it to them and tell them read this and if you can agree you're welcome come on sounds a little harsh don't it but look how a spirit can come in and disrupt everything now when you think about this being the family of god let me bring it back to a human element if someone showed up to your house and you have a little routine in your house right a little thing that your family does the way your life moves and they come along and said you know what you cannot have your toothbrush on the left hand side of the sink it must be on the right you cannot do this your pots and pans can't be there they must be here you cannot have pizza on friday nights yeah you gotta have fish that's right whole another spirit lined up to a whole nother thing that's good brother david that's that's good i like that hallelujah now my brother and sister how many of us would just sit back and day after day and week after week say well i guess all these years our toothbrush has been on the wrong side of the sink and i guess the pots and pans need to be as far away from the stove as we can get them no we wouldn't do that we wouldn't put up with it say you know what you know if you want to have a voice in this house come on you better marry into this you better already be part of this but don't come into my house and tell me now you might say brother paul you're being kind of blunt yes i am saints because you see as we keep butting up against spirits we either come on we'll either overcome that spirit or we will surrender to that spirit all right well hallelujah i'm here to tell you i didn't come all this way to give up now all right thank the lord amen i got my fingers on the threshold of glory and no one's going to come and distract me to start picking up cans at five cents a piece in the bar ditch amen and i saw in the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth nor under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not hallelujah i've got a little revival going on this morning saints we've not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to lose the seven seals thereof now look my brother and sister around the message today there's a lot of people that don't believe that we are in the open world they believe that something still must come there must be something else or some kind of a revelation some kind of deal many believe i'm not insulting them i i understand these things trust me but my brother and sister there's nowhere in the word that shows that a prophet has to come back and make two appearances in the flesh amen so everything that we need has already been given amen everything the bride needs is already been given to her including the revelation that her name was in that book amen this is not us waiting to see if we're the bride of christ it is us through revelation knowing we were called of almighty god to be a part of the bride of christ amen it's not determinate to some man some ministry some organization to come and say you're in you're out but it's the holy ghost himself the open book revealed to you and i revealing to us this is the way the truth and the life hallelujah i'm not looking for another way as i've shared many times with yet a friend that tried to convince me to come and convince you that we were on the wrong path remain as a church worship god just go on a different path and i told him you know what i'll leave i'll leave this message when something greater comes now greater my brother and sister is a very unique expression because greater could be something that's more flashy like we build a new big mega church and we do this and greater but i'm talking about a greater presence of jehovah as when something greater would come i would be able to walk on that spooked some people but you see my brother and sister it it'd have to line up with the word i'm not gonna walk on to something that's just an experience oh we felt so good no it's gotta line up with a word and i told this friend of mine don't expect anything to happen anytime soon amen because you see my brother and sister god's got a plan he's got a way he's got something he's doing he's opening his word amen in this bride by the opening of the word that's right by the opening of this book amen now it says no man was worthy to look upon that book even so it wasn't because god took sister to the banisters of heaven and she read her name in that book but it was by revelation that when that book was open my name is in that book hallelujah now if you let the devil talk you out of that because you have some little thorn in your flesh some little weakness in your flesh my brother and sister you might as well just run up your little white flag amen but i tell you that isn't what the bride of christ is what's she going to do she's going to say lord i have this issue lord i have a trouble here lord whatever it might be forgive me lord and she's going to rise back up and she's going to take one more step now look my brother and sister it's sometimes as it is that in the journey of life we walk a long time and it seems like nothing changed nothing's changed in my life nothing's changed in my marriage nothing's changed in my family nothing's changed but if you just persevere this is where the revelation that your name is in the book comes and becomes foundational to you that it's not about how i feel it's not about what my reasoning is my knowledge is it's not about any of that it's about the revelation my name is in that book i can't quit i can't stop now i can't turn back i can't take another pathway because the revelation that your name is in the book we'll keep you in the pathway hallelujah without that revelation see you can be distracted to a lot of things i thought it was funny here the other day i said well you know no doubt that brother paul has said things that that hurt you you disagreed with offended you or whatever now a lot of you had the look but some of you actually had the courage to lift your hands are not revelation saints every petty thing that's it will be a reason to walk away that's exactly right amen but if you're following paul i want all of your money today no see see what i'm talking about look i have on my phone i wish i had it on the screen right now i have in my phone a billboard i give you a picture here here's a big billboard and here's four or five sheep down in front and on the billboard is a picture of a wolf in a suit and the words on the side of the billboard say i will eat you and one sheep looks the other one and says he sure says it straight come on i'll tell you what the devil will do hit him right down and he'll speak so blunt that people will agree with him well brother trevor it's probably right before this life is over he'll probably eat us no sir bride of christ out there with her little pink bucket and she's painting right over that billboard that was a lie from the pits of hell amen and then maybe it not might not be near as pretty as the devil's picture up there but then you're going to see a little stepladder and another little sheep up there for painting on the board i am redeemed it might not be as pretty as what satan's got to offer and we might have some reservation and there might be some drips from your paintbrush and everybody's like well that's that that's just not that's just not what we expected well i'll tell you what my brother and sister when the devil looks at you and says i will eat you he's telling the truth and many people will stand right there and say yep amen well notice there's no interest in humanity of eating the wolf but there's a lot of interest in humanity of eating the sheep come on amen and i be held and lo in the midst of the throne and the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as i had been slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the ages and we won't go into that as believers we understand these are seven church ages certain messengers amen and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that said upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the saints now my brother and sister do you recognize that your prayers amen my prayer makes a difference do you realize that god had already given credit or benefit of your prayer that you prayed this morning right here in the opening of the word was already a manifestation of your prayers hallelujah god knew what you would pray for he knew what your heart would cry for he knew who you were oh hallelujah and so here it is this vile coming forward the prayer of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to god by the blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation i had a brother send me a deal last night my brother and sister and this is out of tanzania and there is a sister i don't remember the name of the tribe the very fierce people they said but she received the message about 10 years ago and they live 50 miles out in no man's land she's never been in church not a day of her life ever been in church but the message came to her she believes the message she believes it with all of her heart 10 years has gone by and now she has a brother starting to believe the message amen you see god working faithful my brother and sister well you know i i we're not going to circumvent that the scripture tells us to assemble ourselves together that the benefit of fellowship and being around one another encouraging one another my brother and sister but you don't tell me that god does not have sustaining power well i just couldn't go ahead and serve god because i didn't this and i didn't that come on my brother and sister let the word of god loose in your life give him preeminence in his life he can send you to the backside of a desert paul didn't have a big church to support him he had the holy ghost amen let the holy ghost come down and be your support amen say amen to it brother paul oh paul listen to the preacher amen hallelujah see by the blood out of every kindred tongue and people and nation amen and house made us hmm ineos is here unto our god kings and priests now my brother and sister and we shall reign on the earth let me finish that now i want you to look at this word hast something just attracted me drew me to that the word hast my brother and sister is the past tense we want to get into all of the technicalities of the english language and all these things uh uh but it is the past tense of half amen but it is in the context of already done it's already finished house made us come on are you with me this morning has made us past tense already finished unto our god kings and priests amen i'm not looking to be a king or a priest someday i am one right now [Applause] past amen oh hallelujah i think sometimes we ought to change our vocabulary from i will try to overcome or i want to this to be able to stand up and say i have already amen past tense i hast overcome yes amen i have been healed you said that ain't proper english i don't care about your english my brother and sister it's the meaning of the word that matters amen look at the past tense side of it claim it it's a finished work that's right hallelujah i'm already i know this probably would just gaff a few people that i could stand up here because they're like yeah we know you but i'm telling you right now i'm a king and a priest and i'm not boasting i'm not arrogant i'm not trying to claim i'm just believing my word amen amen i'm just believing the word that's come hallelujah you know i heard a brother one time said yep we're gonna reign on the earth in the millennium now i heard another brother totally unassociated not a rebuttal or anything said we're already reigning we're all reading two different ideas one looking to the millennium we're going to reign another one saying i'm an overcomer i i claim amen i claim my authority oh remember that beautiful little story brother branham talks about that little guy out there he describes that little hat coming down over his ears and that little baggy uniform and he just wasn't much nobody really thought much of him but because he wasn't the power oh he's not going to stop that old buick roadmaster amen but when he threw his hand out there and he blew that whistle he was representing the power and he had the authority to represent that power amen i'm going to reign right now amen i'm going to make a decision to reign right now because i don't have to wait some time in the future because we are living under the open word so every promise in the book is the pastors hallelujah come on some of you need to open your mouth and say that every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line amen hallelujah amen that's right you see my brother and sister it's pants past tense it's already done and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands hallelujah then we've got little churches now this may be sound derogatory but i'm just putting this out here so you won't fall for that little spirit then you got little churches that got some twist on the word and they're saying yeah there's only a few of us but that's all that's going in the rapture just a few of us let's read this again let's read this again now this would be the saints of all ages my brother and sister ten thousand times ten thousand that's a definitive number we could put that one down that's how many there is except for then it comes and says in thousands of thousands god then takes the knowledge of what it is that we could build a doctrine around our uh what is ten thousand times ten thousand hundred thousand eight zero our hundred thousand and no more but then we're going to have to kind of get out of the united states and we're going to have to go to europe and we're going to have to go to asia and we're going to have to go to africa we're going to have to go to south america and we'll have to go all over north america because it's every nation of kindred and tongue it's much easier if i just tell you look saints we're so special no one else is going in the rapture but us and we don't need to go out of town that'll save us all the effort of going around the whole world to find the bride see all this stuff becomes nonsense it becomes nonsense everything pinned to one spot pinned to one ministry pinned to one whatever my brother and sister that's not the word of god in fact i'm going to be on my notes so we might as well just jump all the way off the bridge instead of just hanging by one hand my brother and sister i want you to go back i want you to study the message see what brother branham talks about the apostle paul amen now brother branham goes beyond the curtain of time and he's there in the midst of those people and all that takes place there at first he's like these are all branham's no these are your converts this one here was old no wonder they're thankful no wonder they're saying my precious brother my precious brother amen they were old before they come to the lord brother branham says oh you're all secure you heard my message now what does he say he said i preached but who i preached what paul preached and whatever they were there like oh no big deal no sir their voices rung to the heavens are counting no you say are you bypassing brother branham no i'm not because if i am that means i don't recognize god in his messenger amen that's right amen wait the law of the first fruits all that was in god he poured into christ and he poured it into the church you see we can't exclude we can't cut this off it's not for us to decide amen hallelujah somebody tell brother paul to go faster amen hallelujah we'll just go ahead and move a little bit forward here now in the sermon in the rising of the sun i just want to come back i read this quote to the other day i cut it down because i just want to bring it into this little condensed spot and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's a part of him now i want you to go back in your bible and just study how god moved there in the garden of eden and he brought out of adam see how the type ties together god has not got a changing pattern amen so he brought out of adam eve amen so here is this bride it comes forth because it's a part of him it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelation any others has spoke of the bride now i want to make an emphasis on that this morning you cannot come now in the 21st century and tweak how the word or the moving of the spirit will come upon the bride people are like well now there's going to be blood and i hope it doesn't offend anybody but there is a spirit behind this many would say the only way the bride's going to get it now is by pressing play i don't mean that offensive my brother and sister but please take me back to the word to support that idea amen i'm adamant about staying with the word of god i am not against anyone and if we're not listening to the tapes we're not studying the message there's something wrong there but you see the word never placed a preeminence upon that amen so you look at this now amen it's the revelation any others has spoke of the bride do you realize you can go all the way back into the early old testament and find the words speaking of the bride of this age amen god always through types and shadows pointing forward to the day so much to come down and say that those saints and patriarchs and faithful men of old longed to be here today oh hallelujah if they had their way we might have a saint paul or a matthew or mark or luke or a john or a timothy sitting in church with us if they have their way see so we got to take all that the word of god people around the message some of them say well we don't need the old testament anymore we have we have the answer we don't need the old testament why throw it out my brother and sister the word of god just shows us very clearly it's the type in the shadow of the new testament amen it was a foundation and the revelation come out in the new testament god brought it down where you and i would understand it so why would you cut it off why would you rip your bible in half and say we just don't need that portion because we got this because there's so many beautiful stories that are laid out in the old testament that give you the fundamental foundation for the revelation that was opened in the new testament and then when a prophet of god come and because because god chose to open the word completely right an open word an open book amen an open book is not a closed book an open book is not a partially open book an open book is an open book amen and so we come down in the time or the season of the open book and give us the very glimpse all the way back to the garden to see how these spirits work see what the manifestation of it was to see even your nature you realize your nature is revealed in the old testament no boy you look at that it's a rough book it's a rough book i'll tell you what my brother and sister it's a rough book people want to do but you know what we need to do we need to grow up come on saints we need to grow up man up warming up the word of god is right here before us we got no excuse instead of leaning on somebody else you know what the problem we have we lean on mama we lead on daddy we lean on the pastor we lean on brother whatever that we've almost turned into a saint oh we'll turn him into a satan and lean on him come on the word of god tells us to lean on him amen lean on him the revealed word of your day is christ revealed to you amen see if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride that's right hallelujah because i love this yes she's flesh of his flesh oh hallelujah amen amen we wouldn't dress god the way we address ourselves sometimes and we wouldn't give an attribute of an attitude to god like we'll give to our self there's a lot of things we wouldn't do if jesus christ was actually standing right here that we do i'll lift my own hand and say lord forgive us lord forgive us amen but see she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life you don't like your life get out of your life get into his life [Music] come on saints i'm not funny here this morning you don't like your life you think your life is miserable and it's got all these problems and woe unto me get out of your life and get into christ power of his power i hope you don't mind i don't score anyone i am he i am he you won't see jesus christ in the flesh today oh paul you've stepped way out there you ain't christ no i'm sorry to tell you the word says i'm him you might not like what you look at you might not like me for a lot of reasons but the word and i'm sorry i'm going to take the word over your opinion i'm going to take the word over your feelings i am him hallelujah if you if your mirror ain't big enough go down here to walmart buy you a bigger mirror and stand in front of it and start telling yourself i am him that's right i am the word made flesh today now i'll just butcher this something terrible so forgive me but brother stephen coffey recently just speaking about how he visited over here and he visited over here and he was in louisville and he went over brother branham's grave and he said i was standing there and he said it affected me but not much i expected more out of it and then something hit me this is sacred ground you can go to bs bcf's website and you can listen to him you might have to listen the whole sermon to find it but that might do you good too but he said i this is sacred ground to god there's no doubt but it didn't move me i didn't go to brother brown's tomb and it really moved me because he's not there anymore he's in me that's it come on sam i want you to think about this we don't need to go to south africa and go sit in a restaurant in a booth that's the same booth we don't need to drive through the parkway and stop at the same bench where that happened we don't need to go to the same racetrack and be to do that you see those things are beautiful and those things are sacred to god but he's not dwelling in those places he's dwelling in you and i come on we don't need to build up a memorial oh hallelujah does god have memorials yes israel built memorials all the way across the wilderness but in years going by many of those memorials were torn down now they were torn down by the enemy by the opposition by whatever but you see my brother and sister god never called us go listen in this coming week i would encourage you go listen to god's chosen place of worship god's not identifying in a building he's not identifying in these things my brother and sister do you realize if it was in that place now i'm not being sacrilegious please i'm not trying to be but there's brothers still living that know where brother branham was standing when he rebuked the storm are you with me if it was in that place then you and i could go to that place and find that exact spot and wait till there was a storm and rebuke it but that's not what god intended god intended through the words of a prophet in our day to show us that we have the power to move mountains got a mountain in your life this morning come on saints i want to just speak direct to you do you have a mountain in your life then you have the authority by the word of god to speak to that mountain don't expect a great earth shaking movement it might be one little pebble on the back side that starts to move but just claim that i spoke god said it would happen i believe it and now it is finished oh hallelujah oh my i hope you don't think i'm out of line this morning but it's this time we get down to the rubber in the road amen amen now see power of his power she is him as a man and a woman or one and a woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit back to taking spirits she had taken a spirit the feminist spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics the wife now you know why we have a problem in the day we live in my brother and sister because the anointing of this word right here what did he say someone help me the flesh oh let's go up a little higher that's right as a man and a woman or one and the woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit a lot of women on this earth have taken a spirit right sir i got to be careful i hear the ice cracking the feminist spirit from him feminist feminist did i say this feminist i am not the manly woman that looks around like she's a marine the feminist amen hallelujah why does the world i read this recently i don't take credit for i read this recently this this person wrote and said why in the world do they want to make women the strong the burly the this the that when god created her in such a way to do so many things a man can't do and this is not no i forg forgive me for just being blunt but this is not just having babies and cooking food you know when i was about this big you know who i ran to when my world was hurting mama that's right now i hope you don't know get embarrassed about this i'm 58 years old we shouldn't speak words because they might come to pass but i'm getting grumpier as i get older but do you know when my world is kind of crashing in i'm talking more in a natural sense you know where i run to she's right here she's not my mama she's not my mom but you see she has the capacity to just wrap her arms around me and tap me on the back and say honey you just lost all the money you earned for me this year but it'll be all right that's it it'll be all right and what do i do i walk away from there it'll be all right it'll be all right come on can you take that from the natural move it over in the spiritual oh you have cancer what do we do we run back into him because we've received that spirit of him we're not independent we're not of our own that's it right for him amen amen made both the mechanics of flash from your side made both the mechanics and dynamics the wife think how incredible our sisters are if we give credit where credit's due but sisters please let me encourage you don't boss your husband around for one in the natural you get much more just suggesting it and when he lays his head down on the pillow at night and he's just drifting off to sleep whisper it in his ear you get more out of your husband by loving him that's it you will get more out of that relationship by pulling him as close i'm talking natural now pulling him as close as you can you'll get so much more than you will if you put him off at the end and tell him that's exactly right now if you want to type natural and spiritual just pull that back around to serving god that's exactly right lord if you don't do what i want i won't serve you no breakfast for you lord no how do you get something from god you pull him just as close as you can and he shows us in the word that when we come on help me hear somebody draw nigh unto him not putting god off in a distance somewhere people are like well you know i just i've heard this several times in the last while different situations people are like well i'm just struggling with the message because we're not seeing all the signs that the scripture says well i'm sorry from my side defense i'm seeing them my side defense my brother and sister may i maybe because you know the situation or the situation i'm in or the position i'm in i hear things you wouldn't hear but there's things god's moving my brother and sister god's moving in asia god's moving in africa south america god's moving in north america god's moving in the middle of africa amen europe god's moving don't give me this stuff just because your little world doesn't seem to have anything we never reconcile the fact that our attitude i'm not seeing god do a bloomin thing how close are you to him i hope you can catch us natural i almost asked my wife to stand up here so i could prove the point but my brother and sister when you're in the backyard you don't see the husband move are you with me yes sir oh forgive me i don't want to sound blunt but when you got your arms around your husband he can't move without you knowing it that's right come on get this over in the spiritual realm says he can't move without you knowing it if you have pulled yourself as close as you can amen but it's when you've got him out there somewhere you say nothing's happening where's the promise in this message that god would move that we would have a greater works than this well i'm sorry you're so far away yeah that's it i'm sorry you're you're so far away and your binoculars you've got tired of looking through them because you didn't see anything happen reminds me one time if you'll forgive me for just taking this back in the natural deal reminds me one time we were out hunting in the owyhees and uh we'd parked the truck in one spot where we knew they were dear there amen and no brother david i'm not telling you where that spot's at and uh i shot a really i shot a really really nice four point which my brother's dog promptly ain't the antlers a few months after that so but we went down into this valley and we crossed through this deal we'd walked a long ways in fact we were talking to ourselves when we'd meet up and rest dreading the idea how far we're going to walk back we come down on this little camp these guys were sitting around a fire it's about four o'clock in the afternoon one guy there he's cooking him some food and we said hey how's the hunt and they said there ain't nothing around here we have looked at every brush pile we have walked through every goalie every creek bottom we have been everywhere there's not a deer around here and we're like oh okay and he said where'd you guys park we said well go over that mountain through that valley up that way and over that deal and that's where we're at he goes my if i was you guys i'd be head back to camp we all looked at each other we're looking at this hillside behind their camp there's three or four big fingers of brush that go up this hillside right we all looked at each other and said we've come this far we started hiking up the mountain and we started shooting deer right in sight of their camp and when we come back down the mountain now we've got to get these deer because we're remembering that we can go up this road and down here it's about 20 miles and we go over here and come around here and come back down this thing but we'll be in a pickup so no big deal and so we can leave these deer right here and we come dragging these deer and we're all like can we get these deer off the mountain besides going by their camp not really look saints should never cower when you've just had a victory but we were walking by just paraphrase this with me here we're walking by the enemy's camp kind of looking the other way one guy's out there like why don't you go hunt your own part of the world you see saints i don't care where you're at i don't care what your circumstance is that is truth well brother paul you don't understand our circumstances i don't i don't i won't even pretend i understand i know that's true though that's right nothing else really matters i don't need to understand you i don't need to understand what's wrong in your world i know this is true that i was taken from his side and i have been made both the mechanics and the dynamics i'm his wife now you take a wife that gets married and she says well i'll tell you what i'm just doomed for 50 years of hell what kind of marriage did she expect when she started yeah that's right you get a you get a young woman with the right attitude watch out brothers don't blame me i'm preaching did you get a brother that his wife has that right approach and he's going to find his wallet flying out of his pocket all the time because she's going to be whispering his arrow honey if you would just are you guys able to handle this his heart's just going to start melting and all of his man friends are going to like go wow she's turning him into putty and then they're going to go home and look in the mirror and be able to say i know how he feels what is it amen mechanics dynamics the spirit of him and the flesh of him put it together die mechanics and dynamics until the church of the people it goes on and on you can go look it up here amen but i'll tell you i just wanted you to catch this my brother and sister you see this is how we get you say well is god moving in our midst just as much as you're moving to him he's moving to you you have distance to him he has distance to you come on amen let me just speak blunt to those that will be wives and husbands sometime in the future you want a good relationship you pull yourself just as close to your wife and just as close to your husband as you can because the principle that applied to god draw nigh unto him he draws nigh unto you and god's word cannot be broken okay now we'll move on i'm finally getting to my subject hallelujah hallelujah oh my i want to just drop back for a moment it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the bride so i can go back to matthew mark luke john timothy zachariah [Music] what did he say about to the bride that's me that's me i am his beloved and he is mine hallelujah that is possessive come on if some of you just get a little meet me give a little air kiss to make a point get you all nervous go read song of solomon that'll get some of you where you'll try and read it in the dark in your closet because you'll be so embarrassed but that's the truth of how god looks at you and i am amen he looked at every bit of us now get this i'm on this vein i might as well just go there for a second he looked at us at our comely and our uncomely parts and still said i love you that's it there you are you know i guess i got some people all kind of humorly tweakered here the other day because i made the point about don't marry for looks because looks don't last but cooking does some thought i was advocating you marry a ugly wife that can cook i thought it was advocating mary the most beautiful girl you can marry that cooks in case i didn't get that message across that's what i really meant but if she ain't got character you ain't got much that's right oh hallelujah now we'll look at that i want to just jump down and catch this last little deal until that church becomes both dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of god that moved him to do the things that he did we're back to that spirit again you're going to have the same spirit can't have another spirit gotta have that same spirit amen now people don't like it when you talk about things like dominating female spirits usually it's the one with the dominating female spirit they don't like to preach or preaching about it but anyway moving beyond that moving beyond that you see well i was just talking to someone recently and they were this com comment made about well brother so and so preach this and mention dominating female spirits and this individual said you know when that happened i bowed my head and said lord please don't let that spirit get on me and others were like how dare him well okay we'll move on ryan until that church becomes both dynamics and mechanics right which brother brahms showed us is out of him and the spirit of god that moved him to do the things that he did if he hid on 16 cylinders so will the bride you see saints i'm not looking to hit on four cylinders i'm not looking to hit on six cylinders i'm not looking to hit on eight cylinders i'm not looking to hit on 12 cylinders if he hit on 16 cylinders i'm going to hit on 16 cylinders hallelujah amen oh brother paul you take way too much liberty with the word thank you i take that as a compliment amen we got a moment nobody's nobody left their steak on the barbecue did they now here oh my you see the open manifestation of who the bride is how do we know who the bride is the identification of the bride was brought by the loosing of the word amen now i'll give you just what i consider an example if it doesn't quite fit the pattern forgive me but the prophet of god is now preaching in coliseums gymnasiums different places like that tents etc and he's having he is he's experiencing not him but the people i guess i should say are experiencing these great moves of god right many are healed little black girl wandering through the people crying out for her mama or daddy and brother branham's there and and she's there and and when she recognizes god comes on the scene she doesn't say i i think i'll see what my pastor says about it i'll see what this great man thinks about it she wants him see she don't know no different we know different so when people now start lifting the man up oh this man did this this man did that we got but when they didn't know better she just was wanting the healer you the healer now see brother brown could have went the whole explanation about no i'm just god's servant i can't heal nobody but you see god you might say winks in our ignorance and she's like are you the healer you the healer you can heal me right there what was it she knew she knew that this was god in flesh don't go into a big revel explanation big revelation about how this is this and we oh we don't mean we're going too far here and this is here you see my brother and sister we've got way out of balance god come down used man amen amen god sent a prophet the power of god the word of god was in that man's mouth absolutely but then he himself took us back to the word and said all that was in christ amen he poured into who that church when will we learn we are moving from potential to reality we're moving from just brother branham said this and we witness this and we have a right moving to the place that people are able to pray and see it manifested right in front of them oh my now we're living in another age glory oh i love this age many of us if given the chance would go back to pentecost don't you know now god has a mercy seat today to be guarded you believe that where's the mercy seat found amen the reason i bring this out my brother and sister is because there's a little faction moving around through the message that's like well you know if brother brown's left the mercy seat we don't need to be preaching none of this nothing's going to change but see they've missed the point here they've missed the point here see the prophet of god said where's the mercy seat found in the heart of man where did it come into the heart of man at the day of pentecost when the holy ghost which is god come into the human heart is that right now let's mark this down here and get ready to draw it if you want to pentecost i'll put pentecost this is the mercy seat the holy ghost put in here i'll tell you what make it more appropriate let's put in here the dove which means bird see all right guarding the mercy seat now god has got guards for the mercy seat today now watch how beautiful it's drawn out now i just give you a snippet of this you can take these notes you can go look it up you can read it but the prophet of god lays a whole foundation for us my brother and sister that for the bride of jesus christ he'll never leave the mercy if he is in our hearts how could he leave that mercy seat he will always saints be on the mercy seat for you and i he will always be there as our advocate he will always be there receiving our repentance but there will come a time on this earth when he steps from that and moves the lion now comes on this scene what has happened my brother and sister we're living in a day that many people even around the message are believing and as they look out they're expecting to see a lion he's left the mercy seat he's left the mercy seat brother branham said over here brother brown said over here brother brown said over here he said that but you have to understand the relationship between the bride and the bridegroom if we are flesh of his flesh bone of his bone amen he cannot cut you off he cannot abandon you he cannot leave you under a throne of judgment are you with me i don't want any misunderstoods here amen you see we when we come into that position must recognize we are not just a people but we're a chosen generation amen we're a people that god said i'll put my name in them i will mark them as being of my very own not just people looking for salvation i don't want to go to hell i don't want to go to hell amen if i can find this maybe i included it maybe i didn't or the prophet of god oh look at this let me just go see look what this is now the open manifestation of who the bride in was brought by the loosing of the word no other age no other generation my brother and sister as it were ever has had the word opened so far to them amen some looking to see the lion but when the bride looks she sees a lamb that's all she sees you come to church let me make a bold statement you come to church expecting to be judged you've come with the wrong attitude you've come with the wrong understanding you need to come to the house of god saying i come to see the lamb i come to see the lamb the lamb is here he promised to be here the lamb he gave his life for me he loves me he said i'm part of him he said he would never leave me he would leave the ninety and nine and come and find me that's how we need to come to the house of god but if you walk in and say i'm going to the house of judgment today it is a house of judgment prophet of god says i'm just paraphrasing this you can find it prophet of god says anyone with the right attitude in a bible and a pencil and a paper will only take a few moments to realize that we are sinners that's right i've got an advocate amen he's come he's coming oh he's standing there he's my advocate oh hallelujah i have an advocate i have an advocate hallelujah i have an advocate amen oh hallelujah you see how this is the lamb represented mercy a word to the bride you have to come and submit yourself to the word that's it there's no other way that's right sisters you know me if you can't submit yourself to your husband i don't care how many flaws he has if you can't submit yourself to your husband something's wrong that's right amen that's right maybe it'll come to a time in our life that we must look each other in the face speaking as it were in the natural look each other in the face and say we're both wrong but see this bride looks into the face of our lord jesus the word amen the word is not wrong amen the word is always right see this bride's come and submitted herself to the word she's already coming to judgment saints that's why she's not seeing a lion she's already coming to judgment she's already looked into the face of the word and said oh lord forgive me i'm a sinner lord forgive me i'm weak lord forgive me i'm frail amen oh hallelujah can i have just another minute or two hallelujah notice the pride if the bride in the beginning i want to be back on a positive note here okay i want you all to leave going we were beaten up in church we don't need a church paramedic amen the balm of gilead is sufficient notice the bride if the bride in the beginning was the word or the bridegroom and then if the bride is taken from the bridegroom now you see we have a decision to make right here we can decide that we have a mind of our own and we can read the word of god and interpret it our own way or we can stop and say this is what god said see it's our decision we make amen and i love free moral agency trust me i love free moral agency amen if i i preached this morning and then i got in our car and drove 150 miles an hour down the boulevard my decision i'd have to go buy a different car to go that fast but anyway that would also be my decision the bridegroom then if the bride is taken from the bridegroom it must be the word also come on saints this is where i i question and sorry as i i admit the older i get kind of grumpier don't waste my time don't tell me you got the holy ghost and then deny the word prophet of god deals with that that's not my fault this is the prophet of god deals with it you cannot deny the word and claim to have the spirit of the word amen so this little bride amen must be the word also that's all she can be if we say lord i was taken out of you i'm part of you then we have to be the word notice the bride must be why why must the bridegroom be the word manifested made plain why must the bridegroom be the word manifested made plain is because the bride and the bridegroom are one now if god get this too long to explain it going back through the message if god expects you and i to be the word manifested does he not then have to come and manifest himself in our presence amen remember i preached last sunday on potential brother i'm talking about there with abraham potential amen why was that i want to catch this i never spoke it the other day and i was just working and it hit me i never said that but you see my brother and sister nowhere else the the camp sarah didn't cook the lamb they had servants to do this they had servants for everything my no one else no one else get this no one else saw acknowledged and spoke elohim no one that's right no one you talk about god revealing himself to exclusive companies right down in the midst of the whole deal and revealing himself right in the midst of the camp she is just a smitten piece off of him think about this there is a masterpiece it was smitten say michelangelo could not reproduce that again he could not put it back now i can see in the modern day that we live in with all these epoxies like you know the guys that do granite you know they could got a little chip they can fix it you can't see it you can mix a little this up mix a little that up sprinkle this grind a little stone here mix it with it put it in there buff it all out don't even know it was ever chipped michelangelo i can see him there some form of epoxy liquid steel taking that piece where he struck it trying to put that on there glue it in place sand it try to make no brother brown says that's what made it a masterpiece [Music] the fact that he was under the anointing and he smoked that oh come on i hope you catch this my brother and sister she is just a smitten piece off of him there is the masterpiece if god wanted you to be perfect he'd have made you like the angels that you're smitten peace off of him michelangelo could not reproduce that again he could not put it back but god is going to do it he's going to bring this little bride that's smitten right back to the side of the original word there he is there is the masterpiece the family back again in the garden of eden oh hallelujah oh my oh my amen hallelujah i've got more stuff here i just got to stop oh hallelujah oh hallelujah sister emmy would you just come amen yes sir lord help us lord help us amen amen you know i sent that little cartoon out on the church app i sent that with prejudice best sermon because it's ten minutes shorter i didn't preach a better sermon than last sunday because it's three minutes longer but you see my brother and sister we're not here to measure what we got sunday against the clock we are here to give our self to the word that's right amen right that's it lord you know you would have had me restored i would have been healed i would have been brought right back to the side of the original word but i gotta go um hallelujah no i'm not advocating that we as preachers just burn up your tongue but if god's here god's speaking it's real hallelujah amen and i said all that because i want 10 more minutes can i have 10 minutes amen well two hands three hands four five oh some of you i can see are determined not to lift a hand hallelujah i think you were outvoted now look this word half i want to use this with a quote below i want you to think about this word half now in the easter seal brother brown says but he that understandeth you see my brother and sister it's not about hearing people are like i listen to a sermon every single day i listen to prophet every single day still fight a bosom see that won't do it he did understand it look at these next words he that knoweth his place in this hour see it's not oh i don't mean to be hammering down on this saint it's not that we caught the revelation god sent a prophet you need to know your place in this hour there's where the difference is made he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me half oh look at this half brother branham even puts that in there present tense eternal life see not looking back we're not looking back we're not some other day you know oh i tell you it was like 10 12 years ago i don't really remember the time but 10 or 12 years ago we had a visiting minister here at the church and god moved so powerfully filled up the altars in the last 10 12 years well backslid but we can look to that time when the whole church was in the altar say past tense my brother and sister so we were talking earlier about a finished work yes we want to look back in the past tense it is a finished work here is when it was done it's finished but there comes a time we have to dwell in the present tense amen so we start living in the past tense we got a problem in this in this case shall not come into the judgment right we were talking about judgment earlier shall not come into the judgment why because they've already took the word and they've judged themselves and they looked into the word and they said oh my yes oh my lord i have fallen short lord forgive me no pastor no evangelist no preacher out here whipping you you no good people get in the altar you have sons and daughters of god looking in the word as i said the prophet of god saying if they have the right attitude and they have their bible and a pencil and paper it won't take very long for them to see their faults and we're man enough woman enough you know that's why i'm speaking a little rough forgive me you know what a lot of times our problem is it ain't the preacher any husband it ain't wife we're not man enough we're not woman enough to look at what we committed ourselves to our vow amen we made a vow someone help me i don't remember that that man was in the battle and he said lord i'll offer the first thing i see when i go home father if you allow us to win and he goes home and what is it his beautiful little girl and you think well there ain't no way because god passed a law as it were forbidding them to offer their children to kill their children ain't no way he can do that he's got a problem but that scripture you go study it proves right there god wants you to honor your vow more even than the law you make the vow stand with it be man enough be woman enough stand on it i made this vow i made it before god i'll stand on this lord i said i would serve you i will serve you amen see you then when this new eternal life dwells in you it is the potential or the earnestness of you being quickened from mortal to immortality let me say that again when this spirit has found you the individual and has come upon you it is a potential of your eternal inheritance that god thought of you and made for you before the foundation of the world that is your potential like if you ask me for an oak tree and i gave you an acorn oh most of us be offended now the life for the oak tree is in the acorn now but you have to wait till it grows up yeah look at that so do we when you receive the holy spirit of god it's god's potential waiting upon you that's already recognized you and you're sealed by the spirit of promise of god into the body of christ and when god looked down at calvary and seen jesus dying not only he died for his bride the body which is the word church the church that believes the word of god for the age whether it's feet body head whatever it is see it's christ was bleeding and died and god looked upon him and saw his resurrection in the church raised with him on easter now i want you to get all this together because i've got something here a little bit i want to say lord willing now notice it's the earnest that's it or the potential the quickening power of your resurrection when you receive the holy spirit is then dwelling in you the potential of it notice you are now on your way hallelujah i'm on my way oh there's a song about that i'm on my way what is that song i'm on my way to canaan's land hallelujah amen i'm on my way saints amen you might find me with a few skinned elbows and skinned knees and stubbed toes but hallelujah don't just count me down and out i'm on my way amen growing to the full resurrection no tree just comes up overnight it's got to grow and as we grow in the grace and knowledge of god you're baptized in the holy spirit now as the pentecostal church baptized in the holy spirit it began growing uh oh this is a part we never liked talking about limbs has died they was pruning them off but the tree is still growing it's still going on because it's got to come to the resurrection they're led by the spirit to the quicken the word to you who is believers oh hallelujah can somebody say that's me hallelujah the word keeps quickening as you come to the first limb second limb third limb on up it just keeps quickening the spirit of god keeps quickening amen to you hallelujah well hallelujah can we just stand that'll be a sure way i won't go ahead and keep preaching amen i'll tell you saints it's just hard i want to just tell you it's hard there's so much there there's so much more amen the spirit's quickening the bride amen moving her from potential to reality amen the potential is no good there's no good my brother and sister if you don't ever exercise that potential you will not ever reach out and say you know what this message came for me it's not a matter of whether a vindicated prophet or this or that or the other god sent a message to me and i'm here to open my arms and say lord i receive i receive lord this word that you come father if i'm not where i should be then lord let me submit myself and be quickened by your word oh hallelujah says amen you see something's got to move this bride in her potential from the reality of the potential to the reality of the prophesied word amen you see if there was no prophesied word you wouldn't be here today but there is a prophesied word and the potential in that prophesied word is here to turn you into the bride of christ will you receive it from your heart just say lord i am that bride i am the quickening of the word in the day that we live in i am the revelation of jesus christ it doesn't lie in a building it doesn't lie in a mountaintop it doesn't lie anywhere else because it is christ in you that's where he chose to dwell and that's where he's quickening himself is not in a church with four walls but in you as a bride coming oh i don't offend no one but my brother and sister if a man and a woman get married and they never consummate that marriage the courts even say that is not a marriage amen and you come and you put yourself in a position where you submit and say lord i am your wife i was taken from you i'm a part of you i will be in you and you said that you would be in me and with me even to the end oh don't let that just be words that we read scripture let that be life because it's in that that moves us from this flesh where it's always about the flesh always about i feel i see i understand i want i like i dislike to the place that we simply say lord i surrender i submit myself as your wife i submit myself to you move me as you will lead me as you will correct me as you will oh hallelujah and the bride responds with a great big amen hallelujah lord we want to be not just potential we want to be the reality of the bride of christ you know it's pretty funny i don't want to break the spirit but i want to make this point it's pretty funny i don't say this embarrass sister jerry it's just a reality it's those of you know as well know the story but before i even ask sister jerry to marry me another sister in the church comes to me and goes congratulations i'm like what are you talking about you know there was no lottery in them days so i hadn't secretly won a lottery for a ticket i never bought i said congratulations i said what are you talking about who you and jerry are getting married [Music] i haven't even asked her yet they got embarrassed oh i'm so i'm so sorry i was gonna have a twist that you're probably not expecting i spoke a little of things i'll just leave it real simple like that i spoke little love things to jerry took her places bought her things it's called bribery [Music] depends on how you look at it brother david but brother david's right it's courtship actually you see the sister was a little bit really out of order not so much jerry jerry come to a place she was just expressing [Music] i'm already declaring to the world i'm his bride i am part of him i'm not a tag along i'm not the one that oh if he doesn't this maybe he'll come my direction my brother and sister i'm taking what he said amen and brother david is totally right forgive me for saying bribery amen the courtship he's told me over and over again your mind your mind your mind your mind your mind your mind and she believes and she believes oh hallelujah and she believes amen she doesn't have to have everything in perfect order and see the absolute of it all but she can look at the word and see the courtship and see those things and say you know what he's going to marry me i'm his bride you know that's the story of the meat packer and the girl you know that's what that whole story's about has nothing to do with just a rich boy and a little girl my brother and sister that had us all to do when the prophet shared that story it had all to do with woman who caught the revelation i am the bride it's not her it's not her it's not her it's not her it's me that's right oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah oh my hallelujah brother jason come [Music] you know just thinking of a song that was either played or sung before church started there is a fountain open you see that fountain my brother and sister is not just to wash our sins in it's also a place that we can come and rejoice in his presence it's a place we can come and let this world know i care about the hymn of my garment my garment was clean here but it's going to also be clean today and when i get up tomorrow i will clean it
