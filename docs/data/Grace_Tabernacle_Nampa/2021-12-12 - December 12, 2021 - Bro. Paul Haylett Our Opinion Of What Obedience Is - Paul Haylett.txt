well man if you have a need on your heart just raise your hand to our heavenly father he sees your hand he sees your heart i was talking to brother john gray yesterday and he's saying you know gave me a quote that a minister spoke and he's already been in here yesterday or he's already into your tomorrow amen so we know he's already he sees he knows what you're going to go through and the good news is he has an answer for you amen sweaty come brother david [Music] let us bow our heads our heavenly father we bow before the king of kings the great eternal one who yes who knew we be seated where we are today he knew that before the foundation of the world you've already pre-planned you've already preordained where we would go and what we would do for lord you've identified us through the life your very life of the token himself is he in our midst in us now lord in bright form how we love you how we give praise and honor to you for the day this day is the day that the lord hath made lord we're thankful that we can say with all of our heart you are in our midst you are here right now with us and taking us into a body change how we love you and are glad we can bring these requests before you lord to submit them to you knowing that you've already knew what we would ask already pre-planned it lord therefore in the name of jesus christ i bind and we bind this devil that would like to take daniel's life father may that demon power of torment leave him may the power of almighty gods come sweeping in even at this moment and show him your grace show him your mercy we pray dear heavenly father be with our brother sergey on the road we commit him to you may he receive this morning what he as lord open his heart to hear and receive we're expecting you to speak we're expecting you to bring the word this morning we are expecting here to leave here raised to a higher plane lord this is not unexpected we expect it because we know that you are in our midst not only with us but you are in us fulfilling performing doing what you've ordained to do there is no way lord there's no such a thing as failure to a little bride who is your predestinated seed how we love you father and lord jesus lord we just commit these other needs and needs of coven lord in people's bodies lord we ask you to completely set them free we ask lord that our sister christian will not need surgery in the name of jesus christ we believe it and now lord we want you also to know we believe this sister laura is set free she delivered we ask you to be merciful to her and restore her completely well to her family and to those that she loves and to her little children oh god we give her over to you and lord we believe this now we don't say these things to be saying them we are speaking them by inspiration through faith we believe that your thoughts being expressed for lord your little bride is the final voice to the final age she is not her own she is you yourself made manifest here in this earth lord to glorify you and to finish the mystery of yourself father we rejoice in this revelation we rejoice in the revelation of these seven seals we give you thanks for this lord and receiving it with thanksgiving now lord open our hearts and lord meet every unspoken request according to your divine purpose and lord we expect to hear good reports over these things and good reports of how you have overcome how you have divinely directed us lord no matter how we go how weak or how much we failed you can never fail and you cannot fail being this eternal life can never be ended and we were a part of that before the foundation of the world and we give you thanks for this and we give you praise in jesus christ's name amen [Music] amen and a brother chris take has a song for us when you come by the chris at this time [Music] [Music] you can call me crazy [Music] you can say i'm a fool [Music] i'm not saying it's easy sometimes it seems so blue [Music] i remember where i came from what you put me through and i'm saying it's over and then i'm saying we're through you've had your chance to make songs out of my life and you turn me to shambles the time of my life [Music] and i'm saying it's over [Applause] neville i'm a saying or through now you may be feeling so so blue and you may not know just what to do [Music] won't you turn to my jesus to make you brand new when you tell them

do and i hadn't planned it but chris started singing that song it's like we need to sing that my hope is in the lord let's see that that's number 10 12 on the screen [Music] i stand in all within the presence of the lord [Music] in whom the wisdom of the ages lies for him the raging of sacrifice the only source of life my is [Music] tender mercies come with every rising sun to meet the sinner in

who trust in him find their hearts and dress my my hope is in the lord forever let's stand and worship him as we sing it again [Music] is [Music] just worship him for a moment just tell him how much you thank him lord we're living in a world people are losing hope lord they see no bright future but lord all we see is the bride of christ we see the glory of our god we see lord our future in your presence lord living in the presence of the son o father we thank you today lord your grace and your mercy your goodness you pour out upon us oh father how our hearts rejoice that we can sing a song as this today lord from the very depths of our hearts hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can someone say thank you lord hallelujah hallelujah amen amen good to be here today saints hallelujah it's always good to be in the house of the lord amen you know just thinking as whether jason and i discuss things in the back room you know sometimes there's something on your mind and you think oh my now what is this what is this you can't bring it up and there's just something magical about walking out that door that your memory returns and uh let's just keep remembering brother bob and sister joanne they've been such an encouraging integral part of this body that that we want to just lift them up in our prayers every single day now that's not to say we lift them up and exclude someone else our brother scott with his shoulder we want to continue to remember uh him for complete healing not just some mobility for healing amen and and we look at this and i just wanted something i was there brother jay and i just couldn't grasp it but our sister temlington and i forget what is her first name sister gloria laurie um they're living in in flagstaff and and she had some pains and goes to the doctor and they tell her she's completely full of cancer well you know the prophet of god showed us that we have power over cancer amen not we in our physical being but the holy ghost amen so we're just want to remember our sister um just uh she's way too young saints um this is our sister up in canada way too young satan like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour but we don't have to stand and offer ourselves amen now this comes really close to home our brother daniel fry home he's come here ministered for us several times and uh he had an infection that attacked him in the bone and the muscle and uh brother daniel is actually wheelchair bound now and uh can only stand for just a moment uh the infection by the time they put it under control had eaten away at his bones and eaten away in muscle and uh we're just desiring the lord would lift him up and just give him a complete healing amen to remember him in that i hope you don't mind if i just kind of inject a little humor in this we were talking about our brother jim dooley which is here with us today and sitting behind us our brother john gray and and yeah refer to him as old friends and i got a laugh out of that you know because look at their gray hair until i found out that i'm older than brother john and so it puts a new light on old friends but anyway we're just really happy to have them um their their time down here in the states and traveling through and i say thank you brothers for coming and bringing your lick of fire together with us today um new year's coming up very quickly upon us uh brother sergey and sister yulia have offered their home with desire to host new year's at their house and i say this kindly saint so no one misunderstand but in my heart last year i felt a little sad that we didn't give more time to the lord in our new year and so i just desire you pray about this we want to come together in fellowship we want to have conversation we want to enjoy ourselves but it's my heart's desire brother sergey and i are talking about this and this was on brother sergey's heart so if i hadn't brought it up brother sergey as the host would have guided you in that direction anyway because it was on his heart but we want to devote that certain portion of time to the lord to give praise thanksgiving worship to him in new year's time and and i believe that uh you need to look to them don't look to us uh for guidance on that uh maybe sister uh yulia coordinate with your sisters for food and and whatnot and let's remember that we want to be respectful of their home and and this time and i i enjoyed last year minus my little disappointment that we didn't really give time to the lord and so let's just let's just pause this coming new years and enjoy our time at their home and and give proper praise worship and time to our lord jesus christ we will be having communion on sunday some people say i don't remember that being announced we are having communion on sunday january the 2nd at 5 00 p.m a little bit to uh uh just you know come together right at the new year's um and uh to celebrate that and stay on our schedule as it were so don't forget that and then this is purely your pastor um and um i don't want anybody to get a complex but saints this is not just brothers this is not just our trustees or what but saints it's time for us to finish our church and so i'm asking brothers sisters i'm asking you make a sacrifice if nothing else you say what can i do you can come clean up behind the brothers as they make a mess let's just get it finished you know i i don't make this as a sharp accusation nobody please take it that way but we haven't had sunday school we had fellowships it's just time for us to finish our remodel on our church and uh so let's rally together make a sacrifice please and and let's just get this finished so if you need to you can coordinate let's coordinate that brother ivan brother isaac brother adam and if you was to go downstairs you'll see they have been working uh they are they are changing things but we need to just rally together and just do what we can do uh to to get our church finished to get our children back in sunday school and to do these things amen good to be in the house of god i'm glad to be your brother in christ i'm glad to be joined together with saints of lack precious faith let's just go into the word this morning i want to speak to you once again on the two sides of obedience and i would title this today our opinion of what obedience is and i hope today by the word of god i can show you that we can actually believe we are being obedient when we're not it reminds me just a little something that happened you know in the last while kind of lodged my memory mom can i have a cookie mom says yes you can have a cookie and the little boy walks off with three was he really obedient he should have said mom can i have three cookies but if he'd ask for three he would have taken five so we take a certain liberty and we still feel like we're obedient let's look at this today as we just turn in the word of god amen because i tell you saints it's on my heart as i i lay this out to you i i hope that you can see it and the way the lord laid it upon my heart we'll turn first samuel the 15th chapter starting with the 17th verse and uh in this i i said i i hope it really is clear to you if it's not someone please say clarify paul because see we don't want to just gloss over things saying well we read this scripture we come to the house of god we prayed we worshiped all as well we need to walk away with clarity we need to walk away understanding what it is god expects of us and knowing now it's not a works gospel my brother and sister but the scripture clearly lays out there certain things god says i want you to do this and if we just think that they're optional we'll go through life almost always choosing the option god didn't want us to choose the option he wanted us to choose the word amen let's read first samuel 15 17. and samuel said now he's speaking to saul here you can see in the scripture and samuel said when thou was little in thine own sight waste thou not made the head of the tribes of israel and the lord anointed thee king over israel and the lord sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the sinners of the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed wherefore then did us thou not obey the voice of the lord and didest fly upon the spoil and didest evil in the sight of the lord and saul said unto samuel yea i have obeyed the voice of the lord and have gone the way which the lord sent me and have brought egg the king of amalek and have already destroyed the amalekites but the people but the people took of the foil sheep and oxen and chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the lord thy god at gilgal now you notice saul does not identify at that moment his lord he's talking to samuel saying the lord thy god he needed to identify this personal but you see deep down inside he was not able to identify personally because he knew he was out of the will of god and samuel said half the lord as hath the lord as delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of realms for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the lord he hath also rejected thee from being king heavenly father we ask for your leadership your guidance father we remove ourselves lord to the best of our ability that you could just come and lord let our voice speak your word and your word alone lord we thank you for revelation in the day that we live in not father some man's thoughts or theology but the word of god made known revealed a living word in the hearts and lives of sons and daughters bless this time we pray today and lord to the saints father may not be here where they might be today be with the bride of christ speak to their needs speak to their hearts we pray amen and amen as we would look at these thoughts today i just want to come back into this scripture and i want to just kind of touch upon these things that samuel speaks now i actually shortened my thoughts or labored to shorten my thoughts today so just pray with me i want this to be timely and not drawn out but there was such uh so much you know you open the scripture and it just seems like a simple thought and then as you study and research and pray it just keeps growing amen samuel now gives actually an indictment to saul he is not coming and giving him a a pass or a pat on the back he's not there saying you know hey you tried and that's good enough he is actually speaking to him in uh the form you might say of an indictment and he said you know when you was little uh uh you know this this uh position that you was in when you was little and my brother and sister you see it is not oh how do i say this it is not so much that you could say well you know what this person this person the church thinks i'm humble but it's how you actually feel about yourself see god does not like a hearty spirit but sometimes a haughty spirit can be veiled or camouflaged that you know i feel more spiritual than you brother trevor and i would never voice that out loud but i would feel it my heart and think it and so therefore you actually have a haughty spirit coming expressing itself in you that you actually by some token of uh your abilities or whatever you would feel like you were more spiritual and and uh drawn closer and yet we have to remember brother branham makes emphasis of this and i don't want to sign track but he tells you i'm just your brother a sinner saved by grace a prophet to an age is able to come and express it that i am just a sinner saved by grace then the prophet because we know those who knew him personally and we know that he didn't then go out the door and act all haughty to the people in fact so much he quit the ministry for a season because he had lost his love for the people and instead of uh coming as a um oh what am i trying to say uh instead of coming as a um oh my you know a false representation that's not the word but you know instead of coming and camouflaging that he just said i'd rather step away hypocrite yes i'd rather step away i'd rather just not even enter the pulpit because i've lost my love for the people so you have to be authentic don't you love it when you go to the freezer case in the grocery store and you buy something that is heated up in the microwave in tin foil and it says it's authentic italian authentic mexican authentic what no my brother and sister authentic doesn't come in the deep freeze at the grocery store but you see in the world we have there's idea that it can be authentic if we say it is but when put to the test if it's not authentic it will not taste the same when we were in arizona my son kept asking me have you ate a taco wagon and i said no but we went over here to such and such and he's like it's not real the real is the family now we'll get into politics we don't know they should be here or not but they're the ones that you know six months ago were living in a village in mexico their food's authentic the one with all the added ingredients not authentic and so samuel's indictment of soul he said you know back in the days when you were little in your own sight see he didn't say in my sight or their sight or this person's sight but when you were little in your own sight when you still walked under that anointing that i am a sinner saved by grace the god is in control of my life and you walked in that and you were little in your own sight and your opinion of yourself was i'm not worthy now the devil can anoint us to take that i'm not worthy and drive us spiritually into the ground with that but remember saints god would not have called you just reading question and answer this individual you remember the quote you know brother branham i grew up in sin and and you know lived a life of sin and then i come to the lord but i have fallen in sin again and i have a devil in me can i be restored does brother branham read a riot act of well you know i don't know a penance crawl on your knees do this do that he says no if there's a desire in you to be restored god is still with you so never let the devil try to beat you down while you're here desiring to serve him the prophet has shown us very clearly that god is still with you and so saul was taken and given great responsibility uh lifted up into high places and the scripture says in verse 18 that the lord sent thee on a journey now my brother and sister when you look at this if we're not careful we'll start turning serving the lord from a journey into a job i have to reminds me one time of dealing with the situation i won't go into any details but a brother being dealt with over a circumstance and i remember it struck me in the heart and stayed with me through all these years he says i guess i'll repent if i have to let us not be the reason you repent don't let it be the preacher preaching that causes you to repent let it be the holy spirit anointing you let it be the spirit of christ coming down into our life that softens us and says you know what my opinion of myself i was right i was right i know i'm right let her opinion come and say there is none right but our lord jesus christ and in that we will find that we've lowered our opinion of ourself and realized without the blood of jesus christ we are on a path to hell boy i'll tell you what when you remember that your opinion of yourself can't get too great and so it's there samuel tells him when you were little in your sight when your opinion of yourself was was humbled you were give responsibilities you were lifted up into high places and made a king over all of israel and i set you on a journey i can't find in this scripture where god says you know what witness when your bonus is not in jeopardy and if you find yourself constrained not to witness that's the leadership of the holy spirit right we don't throw the pearl before the swine i'm not talking about that realm but when the door and the atmosphere is correct and you find yourself constrained from sharing the gospel of jesus christ you've turned your journey into a job and we look at this he says go and utterly destroy the sinners the amalekites now i didn't say go give them a word test saints come on bear with me here he's not talking about that devil out here and you're going to just kind of sort i'm not talking about people don't misunderstand me talking about the spirits of the day they don't don't compromise with that devil don't make a trust a truce or whatever with him amen i want you to go and utterly destroy the sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they consumed not corralled not put as it were in prison until they be consumed see not just a one-time effort saints young people please listen to me for a moment we live in a day that you are offered everything at your fingertips when i was a child there was all kinds of adult content but people had to go or somebody else bought it and it was somewhere might be in a house or this that and the other but now any person with a phone that has the internet can reach into everything good or evil reading a story about a family that when they're when their child just kind of went totally off the rails and they're like what has happened to our son and at the point that they finally looked into their son's phone they found all kinds of content about devil worship satanic worship and then they started following that and he had been delving into that for a couple years and then it come to manifestation so we're not here just to fight a one-time fight not just a one-time effort to overcome but he said right here you fight against them until they be consumed until they have been vanquished not fight until we're weary any of you ever wake up just as tired as you went to bed we'll say well my back hurt me i did this most the time it's demons it's spirits in your sleep you're in warfare and you wake up tired don't just fight them until you're weary i've talked to individuals and i asked them point blank because i figured i had nothing to lose why have you quit you're still living a good life you're you're not uh you know criticizing the message you just get and they're just we're so weary we've just gave up good it's in that weariness that we should cry out to the lord now i want to just interject this at this point the scripture says when you come nigh unto me i will come nigh unto you now listen to me young people especially i want this connect with you this morning when you feel like you've come to the end that is the time for you to cry out to the lord oh i'll serve the lord if i'm still able when i'm 16 or 18 or 20 when you are 8 10 12 14 whatever the age might be and you've come to the place you don't know what is right as it were in your mind and what is wrong that's the time to lift a hand and lift a heart and cry out to the lord because he promised in that season i will come nigh unto you young man said well i don't know my parents are godly people i acknowledge this my aunt and uncle godly people and i think it was another uncle that was a pastor of church he's a godly person and then it's like why then and he said well i just never ever felt the presence of god you know we mostly do we recoil like oh my what did we do wrong he's never felt the presence of god but i'm telling you my brother and sister the season is changing the spirit is changing you fight until the amalekites are consumed we don't fight until we're weary we don't fight on convenience we fight until those spirits are consumed now my brother and sister look at the contrast as it were of opinion now opinion on webster's online it says a belief judgment or way of thinking about something what someone thinks about a particular thing anybody have an opinion how many of you brought us to church today oh come on now any of you don't lift your hand is not telling the truth you like your opinion enough you take it with you everywhere you go and as one man said if you actually don't have an opinion you don't have much advice from someone with special knowledge oh come on get over here into the spiritual realm my brother and sister did you know god's got an opinion he expressed it right here he didn't keep it a secret we're not guessing amen what is this advice from someone with a special knowledge advice from an expert amen he learned by the things he suffered and the scripture says he suffered everything that will ever suffer so therefore under this context 20 because you see my brother and sister we're coming now to an expression of opinion because uh samuel has given the indictment to saul that when you were of low opinion of yourself i raised you up and i made you speaking for god i made you the king over israel but when you become lifted up you have taken a different path you become disobedient you're not and we'll touch on this in a little bit just slightly but you're not hearkening to me imagine my brother and sister we can sit in the day that we live in with the promise of a revealed word and people say i'm not hearing from god had a man tell me one time he said i don't believe this message is real and i'm like why don't you believe it's real and he says because the churches aren't hearing from god i was floored i was floored what do you mean the churches are not hearing from god there's deliverance over here there's deliverance over here there's healing over here there is repentance over here i see god moving everywhere i look and people saying we're not hearing from god no let's get it right down i am not going to become part of your excuse if you're not hearing from god it's not my fault sounds kind of brutal and blunt doesn't it but you see if it is then your salvation is dependent on me god never set it up that way your salvation is dependent on you hallelujah reminds me one time a brother sharing his testimony how he got saved and he said i was in a a little meeting he said the preacher was just like the worst preacher you ever heard he he kept mumbling and he kept backtracking and he wasn't giving very clear thoughts but at the end of the service that preacher stood there and said if you want salvation god is here come now and get it and he said i felt a power like i never felt in my life took me to the altar i repented got filled with the holy ghost and have lived a godly life and now have a godly family and he said that brother still mumbles his words and backtracks and loses his train of thought i remember i told the brother at that time i said there's hope for me as a preacher but you see it's not about that preacher that brother's final call is if you want salvation you want deliverance it's here come and get it now i say this my brother and sister i'm trying to break this habit of picking on people but you guys noticed sister jerry didn't move to the back row she moved to the front and you all think i throw her under the bus hallelujah but look my brother and sister when the holy ghost comes down and starts to move would it be necessary but sean will use you for an example would it be necessary knowing that at his age in the season of his life that brother sean needs a deeper experience with the lord and would it be my responsibility as a minister to come grab him and he's like no i don't want to go and i couldn't drag him because he's bigger than me but anyway you know and the preachers say no you're going to be delivered today and drag him to the old he's not going to get nothing but when the holy spirit comes down and moves upon his heart and stirs him i could have had the most convoluted sermon of the day and stumbled over myself and god stirred that heart and he's gonna find what he's searching for but no we we're getting so much into form and formality we're getting us so much oh i just didn't feel the moving of the spirit today i'm sorry you didn't come prayed up oh i'm not abusing you i'm loving on your saints amen but look at this difference of opinion verse 20 and uh please put that up mason see he's saying that you you guys did all this you did what i told you god told you not to do and so now expressing see he had the right free moral agency he's expressing this and he says saul said unto samuel yea i have obeyed the voice of the lord here's god's prophet telling him you're wrong you've done wrong and he's coming back with an opinion yay i in my elevated position of what i believe is representation of the message of the hour am a true believer of this message i have obeyed the voice of the lord and have gone the way which the lord sent me and have brought aegok the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed the amalekites but is this true we look in the scripture he just lied but if you ask him did you lie he'll say no no i've done right i've done what the lord asked me to do i i'm living the message but it's producing something entirely contrary something that doesn't line up now i'm making emphasis of the saints because i want you to catch this and this is as much an indictment to ministry as it is to people but it's here look at this now uh look i i brought aegon the king wait he's an amalekite he should be dead oh come on saints i'm not pointing at people i'm pointing at spirits people come in they bring spirits in with them that are just as wicked as ago that's right and we're like oh he's a brother in the message with a different opinion there's only one opinion only one opinion that's the opinion of our lord jesus christ amen hallelujah see he's now speaking as it is telling samuel you're wrong samuel you realize that's what he's saying in expressing this opinion he's actually telling samuel what god laid on your heart to speak to me is wrong you know what that means he's saying go wrong and we have so many isms of systems around the message saints and many of them contrary to the word of god and they stand on that what they don't realize is they're not just agreeing with you they're not disagreeing with the prophet they're disagreeing with god see how clever how slippery the serpent is in the day that we live in and be so close to deceive the very elect he's coming in there saying now look we have an opinion of what the prophet meant about this but there is only one word amen so you come see now samuel it's contrary to your opinion uh we have subdued them we have we have conquered them and i brought the king back he's now uh uh under my subjection uh you know subjected to me we have seduted them they're no longer a threat to us and yes we brought back a lot of cattle a lot of gold a lot of silver we did a lot of things here and uh but this is good but the word subdued saints look at this to get control of a violent or dangerous person or group by using force punishment etcetera to get control of something such as a strong emotion to conquer and bring into subjection vanquish to bring a control especially by exertion of the will to curb to bring land under cultivation to reduce the intensity or degree of to tone down synonym is conquer now i want you to think about this my brother and sister he had a word of the lord to go and utterly destroy the amalekites in his mind because the king is now subject to him and they are now in control of the many riches and possessions of the amalekites he feels like he's conquered that but my brother and sister you and i know well today i speak this very bluntly to you you and i know that the thorn in your problem is is that we don't kill again we don't kill him we take him prisoner and we say well as long as i'm prayed up the devil ain't gonna bother me and you'll come to the day the stress of life brings you to a place and you are there and you don't get prayed through on that day and you think it might take days weeks months and years to conquer that it'll take days weeks months and years to come back no it can take a mere minutes mere minutes to come back reminds me of a story i read once where a man was locked in an old-fashioned jail they were going to hang him and he asks him he says hey look i'm going to die can you give me just even a little knife just a little short bladed knife and some wood so i can carve i like to carve and and they're like yeah that's no problem so he just carved a key to his cell that's the devil my brother and sister we give him the tools to get out of jail and come bother us well praise the lord am i making sense i hope so most of you didn't say a word i wonder soul doesn't kill a gag professional courtesy you know that that's what it was again begged for his life and said i'll serve you and i'll give ransom to you i'll even give you of my wives and of my children for servants i'll do all of this if you don't kill me i'll give you a promotion a nicer house nicer cars vacation cabin on and on it goes see he begged and i want you to see this spirit my brother and sister make a short comparison here this man in the tombs those spirits knew who jesus christ was and they didn't say oh my goodness we're going to fight we're going to line up we're going to fight you you know what they did they begged for their life another egg coming they beg for their life don't don't don't don't do away with us hey let us go over here into the pigs but you see jesus knew they were vanquished he knew that they were conquered and that spirit that was on them then was given permission you see they didn't take that liberty they were given permission but they went over here in the swine and then god anointed the swine to go and jump off the cliff into the sea but for a moment they thought they had liberty they thought they'd got what they wanted you see my brother and sister we're not here oh i hope you understand this i'm not speaking this contrary to scripture we're not here just to bind spirits that's right you know there's been many a person coming to church and minister before he comes out or maybe even during the deal bind those spirits but that person walks out with the same exact spirit on them we're not looking saints just to bind spirits we're looking for deliverance complete absolute deliverance from these spirits and if you've been binding a spirit in your life lord my temper my this my that lord i'm binding i'm binding it i want you to stop binding it and i want you to utterly destroy it i don't want you to have to get up every day lord oh help me not to tell a lie today get delivered from that spirit now why maybe the purging was too messy now some of you will misunderstand me today but that's fine i'm ready to deal with it when's the last time some of you prayed through to the point you were wiping the snot off your face with a sleeve or a kleenex when was the last time you reached a point you forgot about everybody else in this building saints could it be that the spirit of the cold formal has worked its way in we're no longer willing could we call that food for thought but some of you promise you'll go home and actually think about it you see the thing is saint satan is so slippery he'd come and in our heart we're like oh lord that brother paul's preaching he's right he's right and we walk out and in five hours we don't remember even what was on us what are we doing binding it for well jerry said i couldn't get this preached in a certain amount of time so she might be right because we're already there maybe the purging is too messy for us i don't know trustees maybe we need to instead of getting just little boxes of kleenox kleenex around here maybe we need to get some full-size brother jewels sized towels maybe we need to come to the place saints that we won't just try to bind the spirit but we'll actually get desperate enough to pursue complete absolute deliverance why are you picking on us brother paul probably for the same reason that samuel was picking on saul because it's a word of the lord not even a single amen but look what happens here my brother and sister but by example of ministry oh god help me saint you forgive me i think there's times i have not been the correct example to you god forgive me you forgive me but you see it was by the example of the king here he is saul he has now brought home what he called booty or treasure which was egg and the people looked and said oh god said destroy it all but our pastor but our pastor look what he's doing it'll be all right he's doing it the prophet of god said stick with your pastor he's ordained to lead you through so then you look at me and as i study this my heart cringes like oh god forgive me if i haven't been the right kind of example but because of the example of saul then the people then fell upon all the booty all of the gold all the silver all the cattle and they justified it look yes i did take the amalekite's gold but i paid tithe on it is that what the lord told them yay i've obeyed it i like this it's a world we live in it's all through it right back on you church i mean his people well hallelujah the way the church dresses it's not my fault they made they chose to wear that no they're watching these movies and they're doing this and you know they were over here at the you know deal you know and i find myself constraining myself so i don't offend any of you do you believe we can have an opinion and still be all right you won't find a christmas tree in my house i already know some of you have a christmas tree am i going to preach against it no and don't think i am right now i'm just telling you god gives us the ability to have an opinion amen come on are you with me all of you have a christmas tree forgive me no i'm serious i don't need joking forgive me i'm not preaching against you but i'm telling you i look at the word of god i look at these things and the difference is i have a granddaughter lives in my home but i no longer have children to justify the prophet saying we do this for the kiddies you see where paul's at i don't have any babies i don't have any kitties therefore i can't justify boy i just dampened this spirit here i just killed this thing dead but you see i want to drive home saints how opinions fall that's right and you would look at this when i say you i don't mean anybody in particular you look at this and say brother brown said you know you're justified do it for your children 75 years old justified we're still doing it for the children come on saints but i want you to understand where opinion unless it's absolute is only opinion and many of you right now thinking brother paul we have a christmas tree and that's your opinion and i say god bless you amen praise the lord hallelujah amen are you with me okay those of you have a tree you're not offended no don't raise your hands but you see what happened saints i wanted to use something that startling and to make my position as a pastor to tell you where i stand on this and you are free to take your opinion do i use that or not lord now we'll pass it over i think that's clear enough but see what saul does he throws it back on the people all the sin that's in israel now all the sin that's in the camp it was the people that took the spoil the sheep and the oxen and the chief of those things that had been utterly oh oh yes and we did it lord so we could sacrifice to you i transgressed the word of god direct commandment of god i transgress that so i could bring as i said earlier and pay tithe on all the gold that got off the amalekites see they couldn't fathom the idea that god wanted them just to leave all of the things of laodicea just laying there otherwise it's like well praise the lord i i that wouldn't hurt what was that guy's name got up in the morning went out into war and he came home and um caused his wife and his children to die anybody remember who he is i wanted to hear a little louder out of you saints yeah we don't want to be an aiken an unintentional consequence on his wife and children now look his wife didn't go out there she wasn't picking up babylonian garments come on this sounds a little crass but she wasn't going through the racks at macy's oh if i sow a little something in here and i do a little of that it'll be oh no no no no no no no it was a priest of the home it was a leadership it was the man who should have been saying you know what god said don't take anything out of laodicea i want you to live in my word for the hour and it is not a laodicean word it's an eternal word unintended consequences i never pronounce it right well i'm just going to go on we'll preach that another day look look what happened they justify this we're going to sacrifice this to the lord at gilgal but you see they never killed the influence of laodicea you know it's funny how these things work saints i hope you don't mind we'll be a little long today now i find it remarkable and i have compassion because i was that boy but you see these young people pulling out of the church parking lot and then nothing they forgot where they were at i was that boy i was that young man locked my truck parents as much as i as a pastor would have permission or could give permission i give you permission to do a police style search on your children's vehicles oh my no young people are like amen but you see what happens is i learned mom and dad cannot look at what's under the sea behind the seat in the glove box if it's locked oh but our children are serving the lord that's what my parents thought too we don't trust the devil see so what happened was as he brings back ag and then the people he throws it off on the people isn't that the spirit of the age you know we know and and we're going to start working towards these things and this is a little blunt and some of you are probably like oh oh my goodness what's brother paul doing he went nuts but my brother and sister let it be known that there's nowhere in the word of god for our young people to be out behind the head smooching on each other there's no place in the word of god for our young people justify behavior that resembles the world and you know what i'm going to stand here as a witness and i'm going to testify this to you some parents might not like it some children might not like it some elders might not like it but you'll never stand before god that day and say we didn't know amen hallelujah so they're thinking they can give an offering in exchange for their compromise amen now look my brother and sister the prophet of god shows us in the message that the make believer will be more zealous than even the real believer and so here it is the real believer struggling the make-believer has now garnered of the things of the amalekites and he paid tithe on it he made an offering to the lord and everybody rejoiced and they sang and they danced around the offering of a bullock that should have been dead in the field and left behind a rot and they everybody's like oh look at this family look at that family they provided a whole oxford sacrifice my brother and sister was a filthy offering it was a dirty offering they were offering to god but people looked at their zealousness and said wow they are so spiritual and it is there my brother and sister god wants you to bring an offering that is consecrated sanctified glorified that he can come then and pour his glory out upon that offering he's not looking for a filthy offering because of its size look zealousness will never replace obedience samuel said verse 22 have the lord as great delight in burned offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord you realize you could be a family of very very tight means and there would be talk of we're going to do this in the church and you'd say man i want to give up i'd like to give an offering and you give an offering and you go away thinking lord i didn't give much go right back to the temple saints one might one might given in the right spirit in the right attitude will outweigh all riches but if god has blessed you such and you felt led and let's just say you threw in all the shackles you see god knows your heart too now he said have the lord great delight and burn offerings but to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken to listen is better than the fat of rant see now look here oh can i have some time saints amen the rebellion is the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou hast rejected the word of the lord he has also rejected thee from being king look what happened to saul he lost a god-given position we'd say well but predestination no my brother and sister you'll find remember that man in the garage brother brown tells a story and the man tells a young boy go get me some beer god didn't let that man slide off into sin and debauchery god cooked his life lit circumstances it was the story is they never found nothing wrong with that car lift why did it come down and crush him and kill him because god wasn't going to let him just slide off so i say that you say why'd you put that in there brother paul because i don't want you to think that god's going to give you an exemption card god's given you truth amen he doesn't have any exemption cards now look he lost his god-given position satan knows if he can get you to compromise on the live word compromised life okay don't feel judged if this touches your life today but if you can stop right now and think about things in your life that you know is not right most of you won't do it but the prophet of god tells us about iniquity i know i shouldn't do this but i do it anyhow to us that is counted as unbelief see a compromised life is never able to get the full power of the revelation of the word you can receive healing and live a compromised life i could share with you a story that goes back in time a few years to see how god would move and before people could receive their healing they end up standing in front of a minister in front of the church not me i was witness to it and confessing faults that would burn the hair off your eyebrows but they sought the will of god more than hiding their own sin they come to a stage in their life that coming in the perfect will of god was more important than even their own pride and and being shamed as it were by their life see satan doesn't have to turn you into a drunk saints i want you to get this people have this idea oh my the devil's trying to no no if you just compromise on the word causes you to live a compromised life causes you to remove yourself amen from your god-given position and the devil's outside the door crying because we're saying the devil made me do it the devil made me do it do you know the devil met never made you do one thing brother random said that before eve could dis or could receive the false word i won't have the exact words but before eve could receive that she had to have rejected the word of god that's right amen so she herself put herself out there to be deceived see so we remove ourselves from our god-given position now listen to this satan cannot compromise your life hear me now you may be struggling young people you may be struggling with music and and young men and young women adoring you or acting like they are anyway all of these things see satan cannot compromise your life all he can do is influence and offer opportunity and so he influences and offers opportunity but he can't force you to compromise you see when we compromise we've already let go of something in the word we've already let go of a promise promised to us before we can actually compromise i remember one time years and years and years ago i used to as a young man before i was married i used to go to a fitness center and my motives were probably wrong i just wanted to ride a dirt bike faster and further but they had what they called adult monkey bars now we have monkey bars well it's now in isaac and kristen yard you know the kids are up there i mean we've done our best break arms and sprain things for you give your kids opportunity to fall off on their head and snap their arms and whatever else i mean we feel happy to offer that to you but if you've ever my brother and sister been on an adult set of monkey bars you know the little crossbars they're not this far apart they're like six feet and when you start on this end you are a hundred percent committed or it'll only be your fingertips that touch the promise are you with me a hundred percent you've launched yourself off of that vertical bar down here launch yourself at the first bar you grab it you don't hesitate you swing every bit of might and power you have in your body and let go remember oh oh come on come on are you with me you got to let go of the last to attain the future and you swing out there and you're literally in midair and then you get the next one and if you hesitate the least bit by bending your elbow or pulling back you'll never reach the next one you know at that fitness center they had to increase the thickness of the mat underneath that thing after they installed it because guys were acting like brother titus they were crashing and burning right and left and guys were walking out of the fitness center with arms taped to their chest and did they get rid of the monkey bar no they put up a sign and says if you're not ready for this stay off amen could we put a sign up here if you're not ready to make a rapture maybe it'd be time for you just to pull back a little or prepare yourself prepare yourself make yourself ready and the lamb's wife have thought about the rapture now what does it say somebody tell me made herself ready see look at this oh my let me keep going now look there's two times in the bible that we have this statement in direct context both of them are in uh the book of revelation and the first one is in revelation 1 4 amen and john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood can someone say amen hallelujah and thought about making knows her half that's past tense and action past tense and half made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever now look i want to back up i've covered more ground here than i intended some things i cut out i still preach it to you i'm sorry but look at this now what happens in the end of our scripture in samuel is samuel says to them you're no longer king you've lost your position right god's no longer embraced you now we look at this my brother and sister we unders do we have a correct understanding of predestination amen it's not well i made god unhappy today i guess i'm out no sir no sir he bought you with his blood and the value there's no measurable intrinsic value to his blood you can't put a number to it so look at this now and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever now we'll go on to revelations 5 and i saw on the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on now john's weeping there's two sides of this saints john weeping john's weeping one he recognized in himself he wasn't worthy to handle that precious precious word he had no authority and he was also weeping because of all salvation and redemption of man was contained right there and if it was never opened redemption in its fullness would never come that's right and i'm not batting at something so nobody think of that but when people sit and say the seventh seal is closed you know what they're actually saying there is no redemption for us that is a spirit from the pits of hell that would try to take your redemption back and hold it hostage see the type saul was supposed to conquer a guy not hold him for ransom you'll see the anointing of that my brother and sister there are ministries that want to take the revealed life of the word and hold it hostage and dole out little portions to you no sir the scripture said and he hath opened the seventh seal redemption has been poured out to you and amen hallelujah that ought to make us so happy we'd jump up and ran around this church amen oh who's worthy to open loose the seals and no man in heaven nor on earth nor under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me bride of the laodicean age we've not we've not your lamb hallelujah your lamb has prevailed we're not in a day here with no hope and no future but the lamb has prevailed hallelujah oh hallelujah i'm sorry i think i just feel like john i feel like weeping hallelujah my lamb has prevailed i have hope for my future i have hope for my children and my grandchildren i have hope for the church hallelujah [Music] oh weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed now look this goes in a whole nother thing i pruned it all off but i'll just give you a little bit if christ is in you amen hallelujah hallelujah god in you the hope of glory only you know depending on how you word it in the message search there's only about you know about 400 accumulative quotes that talk about that amen god in you hallelujah what is that the revelation of the manifestation of jesus christ and the prophet of god says god could have expressed himself in the heavens he's going to express it over here he can express it over there but he chose to express it in you oh thank you lord thank you lord oh amen weep not the lion my lion your lion hath prevailed and then he identifies where this come from not just a lion but the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i be held and low in the midst of the throne and the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood limb as it had been slain aren't you glad you can see the lamb having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and he took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders in reverence to the one who now possesses redemption you see this wasn't just some random act as it were oh wait this is the part where we have to fall down this was reverence this was something so sacred to them that they yielded submitted themselves in the true definition of submission hallelujah took the book amen from him was on the throne and when he took in the book the elders what is this in all saints do you realize when the lamb takes the book this is the full beginning midpoint ending of redemption see what the scripture said this work i've begun and you i had to stop halfway because of funding this work i have begun in you i will finish oh hallelujah oh i'm telling you that's why some elders fell down they're saying here it is here it is redemption has come hallelujah harpson your prayers don't worry about what the word says there in that fashion just catch that that's your prayers that's your prayers wait this happened before you were born you think god didn't know what you would pray you don't think he would know what was on your heart the desires of your heart oh hallelujah they sang a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou slain and house redeemed us to god by the blood out of every kindred tongue people and nation and here it is again i took the long route didn't i think how short my sermons would be if i just get to the point look at this and hast here again a past tense action made unto our god hallelujah my god is not the god of laodicea my god is not shiny with chrome wheels my god is not 5 000 square foot with a pool and this and that my god is ash in the bank my brother and sister he has made unto us our god kings and priests whoa and we're gonna reign i'll tell you there's nothing more than i want to do is to be in that position to stand there and to reign oh sounds like a power hungry person no sir because when you get to that point you're going to have true humility you're going to have true wisdom and true judgment and a true heart and god would say you know what esther i give you to the half of my kingdom unless unless esther i don't like what you're doing no sir why god knew what his pride would be he knew the beauty and wisdom and judgment of his bride and i say today there's no greater no greater position than to have a wife i don't have my wallet on me but figuratively saints and i'm glad i can say this is my life no greater position for a man than to take the possession of his life amen do you catch that the possession of his life amen and give it amen to his wife amen hallelujah yeah that's right oh i'm a christian jesus died for me i i i believe in christ we sit in a restaurant in phoenix heard a man make that kind of confession and it broke my heart oh yes i'm a christian too i uh um you know believe uh uh yeah that jesus died for me total no sincerity but you see when you've come in that position right there your heart just melts that's right he has made me he's made me a king and a priest and i'm going to reign don't you recognize reigning is not just power my brother and sister it's who you are reigning with their relationship is not to have power over nature power over heavens and earth all of this it is who we are reading with oh hallelujah oh praise the lord hallelujah look at this one little compromise on saul's part brought compromise to the whole body amen if paul hitched i mean saul had stood before israel that day and this gave you might say a short sermon on the direction and the leadership in the word of god if you wonder why i'm killing this king it's because it was thus saith the lord amen amen and he struck him down didn't hire a minion to do it god told saul to do it and then the rest of israel looked up and said well the rest of that prophecy was is that we take nothing we compromise on nothing we don't take second position on nothing and our sacrifice measured to us by the word is by our obedience and god said that there was greater than the offering of the oxen the bullock all of this greater than the tithe aiken i already asked you once and i feel bad can i have just a moment or two more this one little compromise on saul's part you see however you notice saints have you ever noticed we don't usually listen to someone else when we come short of the glory of god we fall down on our face and it was just a little bump and as christians we should view that like that you know brother so-and-so and i had a disagreement and i know oh brother trevor i'm sorry i just killed myself brother trevor and i have a disagreement the holy spirit moves on me and i know i should go apologize to brother trevor and if i will just reach over you know because all of us are so far from our phones now i'll reach over and dial bro trevor's number and say brother trevor i don't care if you were at fault for a little portion of this the holy spirit's laid on my heart i am sorry oh god right brother trevor goes to bed that night praise the lord praise the lord because you know what happens when that happens if you're dealing with a real christian they're going to be going oh no no brother it was my fault and then you get in a fight over whose fault it is but give it 24 hours how much more resistance there is 48 hours 72 hours a week a month and pretty soon we have built a fort around something that could have been dealt with so easy so easy it could just be between you and the lord you don't even have to make a phone call the longer it goes the greater the resistance that's why the prophet of god told us and the holy spirit speaks to you do it do it yes now look at this oh please i've got to finish you see it is in our opinion what is little maybe i should have named this sermon just opinions but you see in our opinion it's what's little you know you can devastate someone and walk away and say well i didn't i didn't say anything that horse only by your opinion see by our opinion we declare what's big and little now this might seem as a silly analogy but it actually come to me while i was studying and and sitting there thinking upon these things and i i just come to me and it's like that that's his you know we play volleyball around this church a little bit don't we and you know we we stretch out our rope and that's our boundary come on saints i've watched some of you i think i might even have participated but we'll forget about that part it was you the ball it's out no it's in i saw it i was right here it is in stop prophet said examine your motives you're not going to see somebody on my team that's going to get a point going it's out it's out no sir we're going to get a point it's my benefit the rope jumped that was your foot i saw it as good as you did no you're wrong i've got four eyes i see better than you but you know what's the true mark of judgment when it could benefit you and you would say it's out but isn't that come on saints i've watched you i don't see this judgmentally i just say this because it's our nature we're human and it's going to benefit me it's out it's going to benefit me it's him we're all biased i listened to this lady the other day making a speech all white people are biased i'm sorry okay okay fine but i happen to know we were all made in the image of god a red mist mustang is no different than a white one and on and on we can go see what's happened saints is we have to be careful that our opinion does not put us in a position because you see what saul thought was little what we think is little and as prophet says you're wrong and saul says i did the will of god i did the word of god i did all that god led me to do you know brother branham said god will never lead you away from his word so god does not double-minded doesn't have two opinions you see so what saul was actually doing under an anointing so much greater than he recognized he was denying god's voice to him in that day saying that's not true not true not true not true hallelujah okay now brother chris brother david i think all of us all three of us can say amen to this wouldn't it be easier for me just to tolerate when and go ahead and say oh well i'll compromise on this i'll come i i i'm not made out of that no sir when it's the word it's the word come on saints don't feel sorry for the preacher but i want to tell you i have suffered for this uh i i oh if i preach this it'll affect this family affect this family affect my family we'll just skip around these things come on in my opinion it won't hurt not being judgmental jerry and i was in the grocery store and here is a mennonite family lovely looking man and woman probably 50. and i thought oh they look nice but their daughter then come out of one of the aisles met up with him and she totally squashed holiness underneath her foot do you see how easy saints that our representation to the world is or walk i don't want to damage it so i won't imitate or walk but when you think about what the prophet of god talked about how they would walk men sing and i was like oh my oh my seemed like a nice girl i mean me an old man getting all droopy and wrinkled and going bald she smiled at me she has to be a nice girl but what are we projecting what are we what are we giving out what is the world seeing when they look at us and it'd be so easy to compromise you know here recently i preached about some things and i'm have no doubt in my mind that some of you went ouch and some maybe you said mind your own business but you see saints there comes a time we can only compromise so long before the spirit of god would leave us when it's the word it's the word god help us can someone say amen god help us to stand for that thing which is true yes sir it would be fine sure you'd get more pats on the back come on here come on church let's just form a line i tell you you're all going in a rapture you're all going to make it you don't have to do nothing it's all settled live how you want ah thank you brother paul thank you brother thank you now we'll get along here in just a minute and i'll show you what tie this together get more pats on the back but what i will i do standing there that day when bony fingers point in my face you know better but you failed to tell us sounds crass and uncaring saints but i don't plan on being the man that has a bony finger pointed in his face and said you knew what you didn't tell us i'd rather you be mildly offended at me for preaching so direct you know what spurgeon said he said you're not preaching the gospel unless you are offending the people how would you like to have spurgeon for a pastor my he'd whoop on us until we were all dizzy yeah come on you know better but you failed to tell us who no i'll be like paul i have not shunned to declare to you the whole council of god no man's blood is upon me let it go where it may be that's true god knows it he backs it up and says it's the truth oh saint you see i'm not here to pick on you it might make some of you scared come on it might make some of you scared some of you would cringe because paul's willing to say it and some of you would cringe because i did say it but i say this now i'm gonna embarrass somebody but i'm just gonna make this point and drive it home the other day sister carrie sister sarah standing there and i just caught a snippet of a conversation this was at thanksgiving and i just kind of butted in you know how i do that and um i i just there and they're talking and i said you know this is how i feel about it and sister sarah sister kerry would know and i said this is where it's at in the right context in the right spirit the right attitude and i said sister sarah i love you as much as i love anyone on the face of this earth now some people be oh my goodness that's so forward is there something weird going on there with oh my god no no what it is is something inside of me so real i look at you i look at you and i say thank you lord thank you lord and answered a prayer years ago when i would pray every day lord let there be a church of people i could go to church with that would worship you and live the word and it wouldn't be of clicks and of groups and segregations and all of this let it be a church of true believers and i stand here today and i believe i can say god has answered that prayer and some of you say oh that's good you feel that way well come on the rest of you some of you probably get nervous brother paul got in your face and said i love you so much oh what's going on with him well hallelujah i'll tell you what's going on with me i see the love of christ in you and i'm reciprocating back the love some of you embarrassed to say that that's fine i understand that i've embarrassed many of you look in you in the face and say i love you and i with humor get to see you sputter that's good i'm one of those guys you know the youngest in the family dysfunctional family wait you're all dysfunctional but something inside of me wants to express it i don't say you have to do that but look at this my brother and sister we come to this place where the love of jesus christ not carnal not lust of the flesh not distorted by the spirit of laodicea but the true spirit of christ oh hallelujah sister emmy would you come brother sean so i'll just be quiet notice the church is so carnal feeds itself on worldly karen dead things of the world just like the vulture does church politics hmm imagine that you think brother branham endorsed church politics i don't think so he called it karen called it vultures they don't let the holy ghost send a man to a church they have to have a politics and see if the denomination is going to receive him or not that's right they're like the world they dress like the world they look like the world they act like the war world they're vultures like the world they're lazy soft compromisers that's all there is to it did you ever see an eagle compromise no sir there's no compromising in him neither does a genuine christian he ain't soft he'll hunt till he finds it [Music] i could give you some examples of that but i believe you've got it amen he'll hunt till he finds it amen yes sir he'll find his meat he wants fresh manna he'll get down there and dig till he finds it he'll fly higher and higher and if there's none in this valley [Music] you know i was talking to a brother here recently and he was telling me he says well when we left our church he said i went ahead and left but the pastor dug up every quote there is to justify why he should never move from that church [Music] he said brother paul my family was already backslidden we just didn't know it yet we didn't even leave that church for the reasons that we recognize now maybe some of you blitz out of here because he used these words he says you know we were under a judgmental pastor am i judgmental somebody please say no [Music] but he said we were hungry this part i really want to emphasize we were hungry all the time [Music] and the pastor's like you're sinning if you leave here you can do this but he said we found ourselves we found ourselves i won't even go into all of we found ourselves and we knew it wasn't right [Music] this quote here makes me think about that he'll hunt till he finds it he'll find his meat he wants fresh manna he'll get down there and dig till he finds it he'll fly higher and higher if there's none in this church [Music] he'll rise a little higher come on saints we gotta we gotta rise with the time we gotta stand on the word for our hour and it is a quick powerful work the prophet of god said and when the satan comes in like a flood he would raise up a standard so the standard my brother and sister you can't tell me it's not coming in like a flood it's being poured out it's more wicked and wicked every day it's being poured out look we only thought we knew what the face of sodom was the higher you go the more you can see now look this sounds a little political forgive me we're closing everybody's saying they're dumbing down america they're dumbing down america they're dumbing down america oh we got to do something they're dumbing down america but prophecy said that's what it would be but this is what i want you to be careful of make sure you as the bride of christ are not being dumbed down amen come on this bride knows what food is she's not going to settle for just a little blip here and a little blip there she wants food she's hungry and she's gonna rise up and keep rising up until she in her soul which is predestinated before the foundation of the world is satisfied oh hallelujah amen none in this valley will rise a little higher the higher you go the more you can see so it's time is there any eagles here this morning so it's time for eagles of this day to get to flying higher and dig into god's promises not live on vulture food that's been killed years ago get out of it hallelujah get out of it saints you see my brother and sister this is what god wants us to come we don't want to oh [Music] brother so-and-so says [Music] that's good we should have a little respect and proper context honor for the ministry right just because brother so-and-so says it let me put it this way i feel confrontational how many of you go home from church on sunday and wednesday and check out these preachers of this church he said how many of you [Music] are digging in the word brother david said this last sunday go home yep [Music] was that too rough anybody need a band-aid i don't have one but i have a hanky and i only sneezed on it a couple times come on saints this your responsibility now we're doing the best brother chris brother david myself i believe with all of my heart we're doing our very best but where's your part [Music] if the preacher hauls a gag home does that mean you're going to hold the spoils home come on saints come on let's not just have opinion let's have the word let the word be living in us hallelujah someone say amen this morning hallelujah i just pray that we brought this out in a fashion might have touched your heart it was a lot and believe it or not i cut it in half wow brother davis i believe it i have the same problem hallelujah amen let's stand sing a song of worship for a couple songs or something here saints i want you to think about it if you're going to go out and eat in a restaurant the crowd will be gone by the time you get there amen hallelujah this world is not my home i am just passing through i don't want to offend anybody by my humor but sometimes when joy is just bubbling up inside of me amen you know the real grumpy me i hate to admit this but we're down in phoenix my wife's just looking at me and i'm like what are you looking at she goes oh it's just so nice to see you smile i'm like what do you mean she's like you don't know what you look like do i really look like that saint i hope not forgive me there's joy in my heart there's joy in my soul amen i know who i am by the word of god and i know what god has done i know what he has promised and i know with that promise in me what i will do hallelujah you talk about predictive analytics yes there it is predictive analytics i can't predict no not prophesy i can predict that every true believer is going to make the rapture [Music] of course they will brother paul yes this world oh just worship himself i'm just a passing through my treasures are laid off somewhere beyond the blue anymore like you if heaven is angels beckoned me from heaven's open door and i can't feel at home in this world they're anymore expecting me and that's one thing i know i fixed it up with jesus many years ago i [Music] oh you know i have a friend like you if heaven is not my home then lord what will i do the angels back in me from heaven's open door and i can't be light hole in this world just over in the glory land we'll live eternally for the saints on every hand are shouting victory the songs [Music] oh lord you know i have no friend like you if heaven is not my home and lord what will i do the angels that can be [Music] hallelujah if you get a chance i'm not promoting anything but you get a chance you listen to brother timothy sean preach evening light fellowship in phoenix this last wednesday it was so good [Music] i'm telling you when you sit down and everything placed on the table before you is delectable you can't stop eating it seems rude to go back for thirds really sisters it's actually a compliment and it was a compliment to the word of god to the bride of christ oh one died of copen one recovered one of cancer another recover this that the other all the plan of god and i want to be in god's perfect will so whatever lord you will is what i desire hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah some that song we talked about in the back room through the fire yeah through the fire brother mason i don't know if that's exact hallelujah you're going to have to leave [Music] so many times i've questioned certain circumstances things i could not understand many times in trials weakness blurs my vision and my frustrations get so out of pace then i am reminded i've never been forsaken never had to stand one test alone when i look at all the victories the spirit rises up in me it's through the fire my weakness is made strong just worship the lord he never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to decline he never offered a victory without fighting but he said help would always come in time just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says our lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again [Music] i know within myself and i would surely perish if i trust the hand of god and shield the flames again he never promised that the cross would not get heavy it would not be hard to climb he never offered victories without fighting but he said help would all come in time just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says given just hold on our lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again he never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hearted blind he never offered our victories without fighting but he said help would always come in time just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says given just hold on our lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again can you just praise him this morning hallelujah lord we thank you lord you promised to show up and you have every time lord and father when the enemy says just compromise a little lord we're standing on your word and we're declaring all of your word lord all of your word no compromise oh hallelujah thank you lord thank you lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah worthy worthy as a lamb that was slain hallelujah do we have time enough i've held you so long saints you know i resolved on this little holiday i'm not gonna apologize anymore i'm not gonna apologize i might tell you i i feel bad that i held you but it's not an apology because you see oh i don't this sounds this sounds wrong it just does but i don't spend this time consumed day after day week after week night after night to come and tell you have a taste have a taste amen i'm not trying to justify being long-winded that's just ability inability to concisely express it but i tell you what any you sisters be happy we showed up to your house after you've labored for hours [Music] took a couple bites of your meal and then say oh i remembered i was going for a drive this evening sister you'd be mortally offended and probably never get in i would probably never get an invitation ever again come on this is our day to serve the lord this is our day to worship the lord this is the day to lift our hearts and i don't say that as justification i'm just telling you we've lost sight even of what this day is about oh you preached too long sunday is my nap day rapture's coming on a resurrection day i hope spiritually you're not asleep hallelujah [Music] hallelujah oh hear the cries of the shackle from the onset of time for the change of defeat there's no key see the tears of the broken is there no one worthy to set us free then the crying is still as the chorus rings out the shackled released from their chains and thousands of voices are swelling the song the worthy the lamb that was [Music] worthy
