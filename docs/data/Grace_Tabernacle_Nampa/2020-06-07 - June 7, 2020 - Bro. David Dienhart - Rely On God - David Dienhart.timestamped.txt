[25:43] brother I bless you sister appreciate
[25:47] the song service I had that in my heart

[25:52] to be sung now I'm gonna sing at the end
[25:55] of the service but God knows all things
[25:57] stand with me together I want to bring
[26:00] something to your heart or to your
[26:03] thoughts into your attention I should
[26:05] say I guess I'll get the word out right
[26:07] here I'm gonna be a little different in
[26:09] ministering this morning more than
[26:11] different than what you're normally used
[26:13] to seeing me minister God laid a very
[26:15] definite way to bring this this morning
[26:17] I want your hundred divided I say God
[26:24] wants your undivided attention I'm going
[26:28] to do a lot of reading and I don't mean
[26:32] to do that it's not like me to do that I
[26:34] don't like to do that
[26:35] but please don't take an offense to what
[26:38] I just said because this is important
[26:45] this is something I'm not just reading
[26:47] to be reading God laid this in my heart
[26:49] this is something pertaining to the very
[26:52] day an hour and things that are
[26:53] happening now and unfolding to happen if
[26:59] you miss something I know there's
[27:00] children with parent I mean parents with
[27:03] children little ones if you miss it go
[27:05] back and get the archives if you have a
[27:09] pen something to write on
[27:12] write down what I'm referring to go back
[27:14] and read it I'm only going to bring out
[27:16] what the Lord wants me to bring out
[27:18] there sings I'll probably skip because
[27:20] of time but I want you to listen can you
[27:24] give God that much grace please I it's
[27:26] Sunday morning I don't wouldn't do that
[27:28] at night but God laid this very
[27:29] definitely I struggled very heavily
[27:31] Satan trying to stop me
[27:34] me away from this but I know God's right
[27:38] on time
[27:39] I believe it's something we need is
[27:41] something the future I believe it's
[27:43] going to help all of us not because I'm
[27:44] saying it because I just feel very
[27:46] anointed of God to break this this way
[27:49] so listen carefully I pray that God will
[27:53] bless His Word open the word to our
[27:55] hearts let's pray our Heavenly Father
[27:57] you know I'm standing here in the midst
[28:01] of your presence I'm standing here in
[28:03] the midst of your body I'm standing here
[28:06] in the midst of your church yourself
[28:09] your body your flesh and bone here's a
[28:13] part of it here Lord and and you're
[28:15] wanting their attention and I Lord I
[28:17] pray that you would I just give you my
[28:19] absolute undivided attention myself lord
[28:23] I know as a man I do not have a human
[28:25] ability to bring anything to these
[28:27] people that would help them but I'm not
[28:29] depending on this I pray that they'll
[28:32] not depend on themselves
[28:34] it's a morning they're refreshed Lord
[28:36] and you've chosen to bring it this way I
[28:38] pray Heavenly Father believing your
[28:40] anointing me and the way you want me to
[28:42] anoint them to hear and receive the way
[28:44] you would have them to and Lord may you
[28:48] be praised and glorified in all things
[28:50] and that's not to say we don't stop
[28:52] amens and this Lord it's just gonna be
[28:55] different you wanted me to say it that
[28:56] way and Lord but you do things different
[28:59] you do things unexpected you do things
[29:01] in an unexpected time and way that your
[29:04] prophet said you met you there
[29:06] unchanging God doing things in an
[29:08] unexpected way your prophet taught us
[29:12] that and showed us that that your
[29:13] sovereignty new things the way you want
[29:15] to do it but you have a purpose in all
[29:17] of it Lord in doing what you want to do
[29:20] and father I'm standing up here needing
[29:22] miu more than I then probably most of
[29:24] these people right here this more time I
[29:26] don't mean that to be different but I'm
[29:28] just saying I need you Lord and these
[29:31] people need you and we all need you were
[29:33] in tremendous times we're in a very time
[29:37] of gross darkness but to the bride it's
[29:39] light and father I want to express the
[29:42] light as your prophet has expressed it
[29:44] because I don't know any other way to
[29:46] get out what you've laid
[29:47] my heart but to say what he said I'm not
[29:50] meaning saying what he said but to read
[29:52] what he said because he said it in the
[29:56] way that Lord I believe you wanted your
[29:57] people to receive it and so father I
[29:59] just commit this to you I commit these
[30:02] scriptures I commit through you unfold
[30:04] that you deal with every individual
[30:06] heart as you have predestined to do so
[30:09] and Lord you open their hearts to
[30:12] receive and if they go back and read
[30:13] these things and meditate upon them
[30:15] which I believe you'd have them to do
[30:17] then Lord then Lord I pray that you
[30:19] would open it you would reveal it
[30:21] further because Lord were in a
[30:23] tremendous time we're also in a very
[30:25] deceitful time but there's only one
[30:27] thing that can discern that time and
[30:29] that deceit is the token himself so
[30:33] Heavenly Father made there if there's
[30:34] anyone here that has not met you in
[30:36] their true baptism of the Holy Spirit
[30:39] may they meet you Lord that that TWIC
[30:42] ins that seed down and soul to make it
[30:44] live and manifest the word for the hour
[30:46] and time heavenly father may you grant
[30:49] these things now as I commit myself to
[30:51] you with this congregation under the
[30:53] power and leadership of your spirit may
[30:55] you so unlike these words Lord let it
[30:59] not be just something all my ho-hum I
[31:01] wish you would be quiet lord i bind
[31:03] every contrary devil from that Lord that
[31:07] your people would have freedom and they
[31:09] would receive what they're to receive
[31:11] for your glory Lord in thy name I pray
[31:14] not I don't have any right to stand here
[31:17] and give a reason why you do anything
[31:18] Lord I just believe it's ordained of you
[31:20] and I I believe you will you will
[31:22] manifest that soul now for your glory in
[31:26] the name of Jesus Christ we pray and the
[31:29] congregation said amen amen
[31:34] I'd like you to turn with me to second

[31:47] there's a big comment I'm not saying

[31:51] the Lord has quickened this this way and
[31:55] that's between me and him anyway but I

[31:59] attention

[34:34] away first and that man of sin aren't
[34:38] you glad for the message aren't you glad
[34:41] that we know who this is and that man of
[34:43] sin be revealed the son of perdition so
[34:49] close just like Judas he was the son of
[34:54] perdition same spirit don't think
[34:58] spirits don't want to stay out all they
[35:00] say all we can't we can't come around
[35:01] the message they absolutely have and
[35:03] we'll come into that in a little bit
[35:04] here that same time talking about
[35:07] spirits
[35:08] we're not warring against flesh and
[35:10] blood we're warning against spirits the
[35:13] word will uncover those spirits and only
[35:17] the word can uncover so the word has to
[35:20] be in you not only in letter but in you
[35:22] hallelujah so and and so that meant the
[35:27] son of perdition who opposeth who
[35:30] opposeth and exalteth himself above all
[35:33] that is called God or that is worshipped
[35:37] so that he as God sitteth in the temple
[35:41] of God showing himself that He is God
[35:44] remember ye not when I was with you I
[35:46] told you these things remember you not
[35:51] when brother Branham was here he told us
[35:53] these things Paul speaking I preached
[36:00] what Paul preached he said see okay now
[36:02] and now you know what withholdeth now
[36:07] you know what withholdeth what's keeping
[36:09] him any worry ant worries that can't
[36:11] come right watch what he's saying every
[36:13] with a holdeth that he might be revealed
[36:15] in his time for the mystery of iniquity
[36:19] doth already work only he that's God who
[36:24] now letteth and that word
[36:25] means hinders will let or hinder until
[36:29] he be taken out of the way other words
[36:31] he can't do anything as long as the
[36:34] bride of Jesus he can't fully come to
[36:37] manifestation fully we know who he is we
[36:40] see him working but who letteth will let
[36:43] until he be taken he be taken his Christ
[36:46] the bride is taken out of the way all
[36:50] right now he said will be taken out of
[36:54] the way and then that wicked be revealed
[36:57] which the Lord shall consume with the
[37:00] spirit of his mouth and shall destroy
[37:02] with the brightness of his coming even
[37:07] him remember thy light has come brother
[37:10] sister them even him whose coming is
[37:13] after the working of Satan with all
[37:16] power and signs and lying wonders now
[37:20] he's got signs he's got lying wonders
[37:22] lying wonders not truth lying wonders
[37:26] but watch that spirit can be manifest by
[37:30] the same anointing of the Holy Ghost
[37:32] that's in you to manifest the word I
[37:37] said a mouthful there didn't I not real
[37:39] quiet but that's the truth it takes the
[37:44] Holy Spirit to manifest both the weak
[37:46] and the seed both they live by the same
[37:52] life Satan can create all they can do is
[37:56] pervert what God has created amen any
[38:00] spirit that will not stay with that word
[38:03] and believe it and obey it has not the
[38:06] love of God and is not of God
[38:09] all there is - I don't care how close to
[38:12] the message they get Wow I all right all
[38:18] right now watch now listen to the score
[38:20] of the verse 10 he saw his inside the
[38:22] lying wonders and with all
[38:24] deceivableness of unrighteousness of
[38:27] unrighteousness it them in them that
[38:31] perish that's not you bright because
[38:35] they received not the love of the truth
[38:38] they
[38:39] Seve not the love of the truth that they
[38:45] might be saved
[38:46] so it takes the love of the truth to be
[38:49] saved and when did he love you first
[38:54] before the foundation of the world
[38:57] identifying you to be seed because I
[38:59] love him now how do I know I love him I
[39:01] keep his word not me he does showing
[39:04] he's in me the love of God is present
[39:07] all right that they might all be now and
[39:11] and for this cause no way I'm backing up
[39:13] here the love of the truth they might be
[39:16] saved and for this cause God shall send
[39:18] them them not to bride them strong
[39:21] delusion that they should believe a lie
[39:24] that they might all be damned who
[39:27] believed not the truth when did they not
[39:31] believe the truth from beginning before
[39:32] the foundation of the world they never
[39:34] could believe the truth believe not the
[39:39] truth but had pleasure in
[39:40] unrighteousness now Matthew 24 and I'll
[39:48] let you be standing I got a couple two
[39:50] or three more just to lay a foundation
[39:52] here Matthew 24:24 for there shall arise
[40:02] false anointed ones now the anointing is
[40:08] not false brother branham anointed ones
[40:10] the endtime made that very clear the
[40:12] anointing is the Holy Spirit for theirs
[40:13] but they are false on the inside of
[40:15] their soul they are not the seed of God
[40:17] they are not the elect of God they
[40:18] cannot hear the word of God receive it
[40:21] all right now for there shall arise
[40:24] false Christ's and false teachers
[40:27] prophets false preachers and shall show
[40:32] great signs and wonders in so much that
[40:35] if it were possible they shall deceive
[40:38] they shall deceive the very elect now
[40:41] that's how close it'll be behold I have
[40:46] said I have told you before wherefore if
[40:49] they shall say unto you behold he is in
[40:51] the desert go
[40:52] forth behold is in the secret chamber

[40:59] know where he is we know were provided
[41:01] place of worship we know where he put

[48:08] token in the Lord and in the power of
[48:13] his might put on the whole armour of God
[48:21] that you may be able to stand brother
[48:25] Browne said the whole armor Supernatural
[48:28] put on the whole armour of God that you
[48:31] may be able to stand against the wiles
[48:33] deceiving this deceivableness of Isles
[48:36] the traps looks for really like the same
[48:41] but it's a wily person the wiles of the
[48:44] devil for we wrestle not against flesh
[48:46] and blood but against principalities
[48:50] against powers against the rulers of the
[48:53] darkness of this world against spiritual
[48:57] wickedness in high places really high
[49:02] places in high places
[49:06] wherefore I think yea wherefore take
[49:09] unto you the whole armour of God that

[49:45] excuse me but I haven't read in it
[49:47] marked it up like had my old one it's
[49:51] kind of nice looking I don't want to
[49:52] mark it up in any way so if you want to
[49:55] refer I'm going to refer to page numbers
[49:56] that will not match the new one so
[50:01] you're gonna if you have a computer you
[50:03] think of something it's quoted like I
[50:05] quote here pick up the word put it
[50:10] together something stands out to you go
[50:12] look it up if you have another one
[50:13] you'll find it if you have the new I
[50:16] don't want to call it
[50:17] George Smith's version but it's just
[50:20] what he did I appreciate it it's good I
[50:24] like it okay is that you understand okay
[50:27] now before I do that I want to bring a
[50:32] couple things to you my title here this
[50:34] today is rely on God rely on God great
[50:41] big letters in neon sign before you this
[50:45] morning real I rely on the word rely on
[50:54] God creator of heavens and earth giver
[50:58] of every good gift amen
[51:02] rely on God I don't want to diminish
[51:07] that thought this morning rely on
[51:09] because there's no absolutely no other
[51:11] way now let me just read a few things
[51:13] before we get into the reading of this I
[51:15] want to pass a few things on here rely
[51:17] means to rest on something to have
[51:22] confidence in to trust in to depend on
[51:31] you know that man was made not to shift
[51:34] for himself do you know he was made to
[51:36] rely completely upon God and do you know
[51:39] this message this message has who has
[51:41] and Christ had paid the redemption and
[51:44] caming take the book to give back to the
[51:47] bride everything that Adam and Eve lost
[51:52] that ripe and brother Bram said it has
[51:57] been delivered so where are the people
[52:00] of this open book where are the people
[52:04] that have this at partakers of this
[52:06] growing into it that are living a normal
[52:11] Christian life not the abnormal one of
[52:13] the world but the normal Christian life

[52:18] this morning I didn't say that I do I
[52:20] couldn't do it what is normal
[52:24] I'll tell you what normal is the
[52:26] original life this it ends whether
[52:31] you're seeing God's I am normal or the
[52:32] words no okay I want to get sidetracked
[52:34] here so rely means to confidence in
[52:38] having confidence in trusting in
[52:45] depending not independent from him but
[52:52] depending dependence on him as you're
[52:58] facing perilous times now we've heard
[53:01] that for years but we're coming in to

[53:14] all things work together for good to
[53:17] them that love God to them that are
[53:19] called thee called according to his
[53:21] purpose I don't care what's happening
[53:24] how much you're hurt how much this and
[53:27] how much that and you can't do what you
[53:29] used to do and everything it all works
[53:31] together for good and sons of God are
[53:33] led by the Spirit of God right now all
[53:47] this is I don't even know where this

[54:15] to the word there's no was you happy am
[54:18] i joyous am i rejoicing and i don't feel
[54:22] like it then get out of your feelings
[54:24] we're not talking about feelings this
[54:26] morning we're talking about the word who

[54:33] anything else but the word if he's the
[54:36] word the bride is the word
[54:38] alright the word living that means that
[54:42] she is the Reap person the bride is is
[54:45] the Holy Spirit manifested in her and by
[54:50] that spirit will have a change to taking
[54:52] her to a change of her body which her
[54:54] body will become that very spirit in
[54:57] flesh and it is in flesh now but the
[55:03] flesh will become that

[56:23] and all his works are perfect and her as
[56:25] summed up and manifested the eternal
[56:28] width and purpose of God though she goes
[56:32] through trials and is beaten and but
[56:33] she's handcrafted of beaten gold
[56:36] she's a form thing and a thing of beauty
[56:41] and joy pepper by the trials and
[56:44] testings of this life alright so don't

[58:49] oh well nobody knows about this I can
[58:50] just think this and think that and think
[58:52] this and you create an atmosphere every
[58:53] time you think it Amen see because your
[59:00] thoughts speak louder in words in heaven
[59:03] all right now God okay I'll just stop
[59:10] right there
[59:10] he also said another place he said you
[59:12] were you're all planned
[59:14] free your your way in fact this day was
[59:17] pre-planned amen and you know what God
[59:23] will do he'll live the word and when you
[59:26] come up against the barrier he won't go
[59:28] around say well I don't believe that I
[59:30] don't believe brother branham just meant
[59:31] that I won't believe that I'll do
[59:32] contrary to it that's not God that's the
[59:34] devil you can't claim to have the Holy
[59:37] Ghost and disbelieve any word you can't
[59:39] claim to have look only goes to not keep
[59:41] his commandment a men and then you're
[59:48] not hiding anything Amen we judge
[59:51] everything either the spiritual judges
[59:54] all things by the word all right who is
[59:58] that spiritual one the Holy Ghost in you
[1:00:01] that's who I am
[1:00:03] that's who you are bright
[1:00:05] that's the revelation of Jesus Christ in
[1:00:08] you that's why we speak in his name ask
[1:00:11] anything in my name it's not a I was
[1:00:15] named it's an I am Nate it's present
[1:00:17] tense because that same revelation of
[1:00:20] that person in you as it was in him we
[1:00:23] speak in his name who's speaking then is
[1:00:25] David alright now I'll just leave that
[1:00:31] now heavens and earth will pass away but
[1:00:34] my words shall never pass away there is
[1:00:36] a resting place for the soul he
[1:00:38] said there is a resting place for the
[1:00:40] soul and he's entered into his rest has
[1:00:43] ceased from his own Labor's labor ye
[1:00:45] that you may enter into that rest for
[1:00:47] the Word of God is sharper than a
[1:00:49] two-edged sword so the word is our rest
[1:00:54] and it can't pass away it can't fail
[1:00:56] it's perfect to begin with it's flawless
[1:00:58] you don't need your opinion you don't
[1:01:00] need to had anything to it take out of
[1:01:02] it it's perfect all right now jesus said
[1:01:05] ask the father anything in my name I'll
[1:01:07] do it but sometimes when God performs
[1:01:09] something and does something we asked
[1:01:11] for yet it comes in an unexpected way
[1:01:14] and sometimes in an unexpected place and
[1:01:17] at an unexpected time but God will
[1:01:20] answer in his own way if you'll just
[1:01:22] believe it and you have to know God is
[1:01:26] sovereign
[1:01:28] but he's obligated to his word but how
[1:01:32] he performs it when he performs to you
[1:01:34] how he brings it to pass that's
[1:01:36] sovereign we aren't even concerned with
[1:01:40] that we just know if he said so it's
[1:01:43] gonna happen that's where you stand all
[1:01:47] right now so it comes unexpected now lay
[1:01:50] hold on it don't he said see you must
[1:01:53] believe it accept it then don't take it
[1:01:55] back if it doesn't come the way you
[1:01:56] think it should don't take it back hold
[1:01:58] on to it lay hold on and say this is it
[1:02:00] God said it that settles that God said
[1:02:02] so that's finished no matter how long
[1:02:06] all right all right okay church age book
[1:02:12] page 355 that's the first statement I
[1:02:16] want to read here from now these things
[1:02:18] might be like I said maybe a little I
[1:02:20] don't I pray God don't let it be doldrum
[1:02:24] because it's not doldrums this isn't
[1:02:27] being read to be dulled room you say
[1:02:30] well we could read that at home yes you
[1:02:31] could but I had to bring it to you to
[1:02:33] read at home I'd bring you in
[1:02:38] remembrance of it mm-hmm
[1:02:40] how they'd say Amen that's the ministry
[1:02:42] all right
[1:02:43] 3:55 paid page 355 this is in the
[1:02:47] Laodicean Church age
[1:02:51] he says ol little flock do not fear they
[1:02:58] remove remember he reproves and he
[1:03:00] chastens by suffering sometimes the
[1:03:03] potter takes the pot and breaks it up
[1:03:05] and remotes it but brother branham said
[1:03:07] but it is love there is not that is his
[1:03:10] love another way of love there is not
[1:03:13] there cannot be so that's love so never
[1:03:16] disregard what God is bringing you
[1:03:19] through just take him at his word and
[1:03:21] put it over the situation
[1:03:24] Amen let God have his way and claim your
[1:03:29] right under the word God many times
[1:03:32] tests us to see and brings an action to
[1:03:34] see our reaction because he'll act react
[1:03:37] on our action if we love him we keep his
[1:03:42] commandment if we have faith and believe
[1:03:44] his word and take him at his word it
[1:03:45] expresses love projects it how do we
[1:03:49] prove our love to him by believing what
[1:03:51] he said Amen and there's other things
[1:03:55] goes with that you can run that in your
[1:03:57] mind but how do we prove his love for us
[1:03:59] how do we prove I mean our love for him
[1:04:01] by believing what he said and conducting
[1:04:04] or acting upon that word all right now
[1:04:08] watch so there's no other way love now
[1:04:11] watch what he says all little flock do
[1:04:14] not fear this age is fast closing as it
[1:04:20] does those tears we'll be bound together
[1:04:22] now I can say we know if they're bound
[1:04:25] together even brother branham said
[1:04:27] they're already Pentecost says many
[1:04:29] costs all organizations already went in
[1:04:30] the Confederation of churches already
[1:04:32] joined way back when he was still here
[1:04:34] so see they've united they're uniting
[1:04:36] uniting uniting uniting what are they
[1:04:38] doing coming together in one group one
[1:04:41] bundle brother been said be bundled
[1:04:43] there got to be bundled and they got to
[1:04:45] be bundled first by the opening of the
[1:04:47] word it bundles those tears because it
[1:04:49] brings separation all right now he says
[1:04:53] here but do not fear little flock he
[1:04:57] says those tears will be bound together
[1:05:00] and as a three-fold cord is not easily
[1:05:03] broken they
[1:05:05] we'll have a tremendous three-fold
[1:05:07] strength watch the threefold strength
[1:05:10] number one one is political physical and
[1:05:14] satanic empower which he returned to a
[1:05:16] spiritual political physical spiritual
[1:05:20] satanic 'el power and they will seek to
[1:05:23] destroy the Bride of Christ she will
[1:05:28] suffer but big letters but she will
[1:05:36] endure fear not those things that are
[1:05:42] coming upon the earth for he who loveth
[1:05:45] his own loveth them unto the end now
[1:05:50] there's a lot now that's in the three
[1:05:52] fifth page 355 church age book there's a
[1:05:54] lot before and after this that you can
[1:05:56] read I'm just bringing out these points
[1:05:59] page 359
[1:06:09] Oh elect now we're here
[1:06:16] we know the chaff is to be burned
[1:06:19] we know that the that the Serpent's seed
[1:06:24] canes line hates the true seed they'll
[1:06:26] do all they can even in the name of the
[1:06:29] Lord to destroy God's elect ones but
[1:06:33] they are needed for what's the chaff to
[1:06:36] the wheat no chaff no wheat no shuck no
[1:06:39] wheat but at the end what happens to
[1:06:42] this chaff it's burned with unquenchable
[1:06:44] fire and the wheat where is it it's
[1:06:46] garlic gathered in his garner it is
[1:06:50] where he is all elect of God nobody else

[1:07:57] elect every bolt of help is against you
[1:08:02] why because it hates the word because he

[1:08:08] this place
[1:08:09] he knows he's finished this bride he
[1:08:12] won't believe it he will not can testify
[1:08:14] of it he doesn't up that's almost Satan
[1:08:16] but he knows she will destroy him

[1:22:58] said with the iron he said one curtain
[1:23:01] is called the iron curtain will be
[1:23:02] Russia and then he said watch Red China
[1:23:05] that'll be a bamboo curtain they're
[1:23:08] horrible but watch the purple curtain
[1:23:10] that's rising in the United States and
[1:23:13] over the world the Roman Empire the
[1:23:16] cruelest of them all alright remember in
[1:23:22] the name of the Lord get away from it

[1:23:25] attached to it oh my we could spend a
[1:23:29] lot of time on that couldn't flee to the
[1:23:32] rock which one the one cut out flee to
[1:23:37] the rock the coming of the Lord is at
[1:23:41] hand
[1:23:46] we need a conference I need a conference
[1:23:50] to talk these things over with God the
[1:23:52] church is at the end of her road now I'd
[1:23:56] like to read some scripture behold the
[1:23:58] great
[1:23:58] Solomon's here this is 62 715 I'm gonna
[1:24:02] skip a little bit here because of time
[1:24:06] he said I preached up and down the coast
[1:24:09] and and he said I've gone as far west
[1:24:12] the message to the world that the
[1:24:14] light's gone as far west as it can all
[1:24:17] right and there's a curtain there he
[1:24:19] said he can't go no further it's God's
[1:24:20] time curtain he said being we're talking
[1:24:25] about curtains then he goes on to tell
[1:24:26] about the curtains we just read about
[1:24:28] the curtains but watch you watched that
[1:24:30] one talking about the purple one you
[1:24:32] watched that one it's going to take over
[1:24:35] you be careful it's going to be so
[1:24:37] deceitful it'll deceive the very elect
[1:24:41] 'add if possible now he's bringing it
[1:24:45] right down here
[1:24:47] what we just read if it was possible now
[1:24:52] to be left out there wouldn't be much to
[1:24:57] have to be deceived about with it but
[1:24:58] when it comes right down amongst us
[1:25:01] I'm not us here but us message dried
[1:25:05] believers
[1:25:06] it's becomes very deceitful but what am
[1:25:09] i reading here there's a token it takes
[1:25:14] the token you've got it he said brother
[1:25:16] Brown said here he said watch two things
[1:25:20] are gonna happen there's going to be
[1:25:21] something go through the mighty God will
[1:25:25] make itself manifest and he said he said
[1:25:28] The Verge and it's one of the mightiest
[1:25:31] things that ever struck the earth since
[1:25:32] the days of the Lord Jesus but it can
[1:25:34] only be known it'll be so humble that
[1:25:38] man what man calls mighty God calls
[1:25:40] abomination but what man calls foolish
[1:25:43] God calls mighty see how watch it
[1:25:47] it'll be so humble now the word and
[1:25:51] bride form is going to be that humble
[1:25:53] but there's also something else it's
[1:25:55] gonna appear very humble very religious
[1:25:58] and claim to believe the message I'm
[1:26:03] still speaking about Romanism I'm
[1:26:05] talking about that spirit
[1:26:10] God's wanting us to see something here
[1:26:13] to his bride he's speaking to his elect
[1:26:15] that's why he's got to bring it this way
[1:26:18] now watch here he said it'll be so
[1:26:21] humble you'll never MIT you'll you'll
[1:26:22] miss it if you if you don't have if
[1:26:25] you're not got the token there to
[1:26:28] examine it you see you see why we've
[1:26:33] kept talking about the token all along
[1:26:35] the token is required the token is the
[1:26:39] person that the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:41] Ghost brings forth identifying you as
[1:26:43] see already in him he got to have the
[1:26:50] token now now watch I could say a lot
[1:26:55] here this is speaking out this is out of
[1:26:56] the message desperation I just read the
[1:26:59] quote there out of paragraph 32 now
[1:27:02] watch here he said and all these things
[1:27:05] hasn't he has he hasn't done through the
[1:27:08] ages in the church ages he is now doing
[1:27:11] back to the word because the message and
[1:27:14] the messages and the messages and the
[1:27:16] messages has has to wind up in the
[1:27:20] entire word and in the last day days the
[1:27:24] seven seals being opened was to pick up
[1:27:27] every straggle that's been left off in
[1:27:30] it and make the whole thing in one great
[1:27:33] big body of the bride them who lived
[1:27:40] back there was not perfect until this
[1:27:42] church be perfected that's Isaiah that's
[1:27:45] I mean Hebrews 11:40 unless these seven
[1:27:49] seals opened up and this great thing is
[1:27:51] made manifest in that bride don't you
[1:27:53] see the bride coming price can't you see
[1:27:55] what he's doing he has to fulfill that
[1:27:59] in order to meet him in the air that
[1:28:03] life that word has got to come through
[1:28:05] the woman the bride in order to meet him
[1:28:09] without that there's no meeting in the
[1:28:10] air look at adamant look at Abraham and
[1:28:13] Sarah there had to be a union to have
[1:28:17] that son there had to be a change
[1:28:20] do you not realize there's a union
[1:28:23] taking place there's a bra
[1:28:24] coming of Christ he has to manifest
[1:28:26] himself that way it has to come through
[1:28:30] that channel in order to have that
[1:28:32] masterpiece family it's got to there has
[1:28:35] to be a pregnancy taking place amen to
[1:28:43] meet to receive the coming son because
[1:28:50] you bear him you're manifesting him what
[1:28:54] is the bride manifesting Christ again
[1:28:58] that would be the missing she has to be
[1:29:01] the complete revelation of the whole
[1:29:03] thing in order for the two to be united
[1:29:08] so you see the coming is at hand this is
[1:29:12] the mystery and it's so humble without
[1:29:17] the token you won't get it I'm going to
[1:29:23] stop right there on that all right so
[1:29:24] with the token you show you've been
[1:29:27] accepted when the token of the blood is
[1:29:30] applied to you you're accepted you're
[1:29:35] until the token comes you're not
[1:29:36] permitted on the highway on the highway
[1:29:41] you're not permitted in the bus line
[1:29:44] they're permitted on the train or the
[1:29:45] plane you've got to present the token
[1:29:47] that your fare is paid that you've come
[1:29:49] to the blood amen all right a lot could
[1:29:55] be said there and you realize you've
[1:29:59] been approved amen now where was I
[1:30:04] let's get back here with this so we wrap
[1:30:07] this up we see God uniting himself with
[1:30:10] his bride until he and the church is the
[1:30:11] same thing let me back up here you watch
[1:30:16] Romanism an antichrist isn't that kind
[1:30:21] that flatly denies everything he said he
[1:30:26] said it's so close like it's so close
[1:30:28] like it yeah it's so close I get tiller
[1:30:31] deceived they're very elected if
[1:30:32] possible jesus said you watch that
[1:30:34] that's the thing you keep your mind on
[1:30:37] that's why he's asking us let go of
[1:30:40] these so much of this news nonsense and
[1:30:44] give yourself over to where you should
[1:30:46] be the open book God has provided that
[1:30:52] escape God has provided the rapture God
[1:30:56] has provided the way to go home it's
[1:30:58] called the message of the seventh angel
[1:31:00] it's called a message of the bride and
[1:31:02] the bride is that message Amen all right
[1:31:11] now let's let's go on we see nations
[1:31:14] uniting world uniting communism uniting
[1:31:16] church is uniting we see we see uniting
[1:31:19] with himself with the bride until he in
[1:31:21] the church is the same thing same cell
[1:31:22] person God uniting why why never before
[1:31:28] since the early age was the pillar fire
[1:31:30] ever among the people in every forest
[1:31:32] since the early age you ever see the
[1:31:33] things that we're seeing today and this
[1:31:35] was only made possible when God sent the
[1:31:37] seven seals and give us a sign by it and
[1:31:40] sent seven angels down out of heaven
[1:31:43] second Corinthians says that you wonder
[1:31:46] where he gets that from second
[1:31:48] Corinthians 1:7 and to you who are
[1:31:50] troubled rest with us when the Lord
[1:31:52] Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with
[1:31:55] his mighty angels in flaming fire taking
[1:32:01] vengeance on they said as a judge ain't
[1:32:04] vengeance on them that know not God and
[1:32:06] who may not the gospel of our Lord Jesus
[1:32:07] Christ when he shall come to be
[1:32:11] glorified in his Saints to be admired in
[1:32:13] all them to believe because our
[1:32:15] testimony among you was believed in that
[1:32:17] day this day wherefore see wherefore we
[1:32:23] pray always for you that your God would
[1:32:25] count you worthy of this calling and it
[1:32:27] and fulfill the good pleasure of his
[1:32:29] goodness and the work of faith with
[1:32:31] power that the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:32:33] Christ may be glorified in you and you
[1:32:36] in him according to the grace of our God
[1:32:39] and our Lord Jesus Christ then he goes
[1:32:41] on to say we beseech you by the coming
[1:32:43] of our Lord hallelujah all right now so
[1:32:50] watch this so it that sent seven angels
[1:32:54] down other heaven come to bring back
[1:32:57] that scattered word in them denomination
[1:32:59] scattered word what is the sky bring
[1:33:01] them back where loosen take it back to
[1:33:04] his perfection
[1:33:05] bride all right now watch he said
[1:33:10] scattered work from them denominations
[1:33:12] and tie it right back into the Word of
[1:33:13] God to bring down his Holy Spirit the
[1:33:19] person the Jews now watch
[1:33:22] he said he's I'm not trying on time
[1:33:24] stalling here because I want to make
[1:33:26] sure I just hit the places that need to
[1:33:28] be communism he's uniting to destroy the
[1:33:31] church and the that's not Church bride
[1:33:33] that's church Rome Raman ISM is uniting
[1:33:37] to destroy the church that is that is
[1:33:40] after the church has United itself to in
[1:33:44] the Council of Churches now watch
[1:33:45] they're uniting to destroy the church
[1:33:47] but it's after the church nominals the
[1:33:50] church denominations have joined
[1:33:52] themselves in the world council so see
[1:33:54] how far down the line you are because
[1:33:56] now we see communism uniting to destroy
[1:33:59] the church right in front of us it's
[1:34:05] right in front of us it's working and we
[1:34:11] get our eyes so caught up in this and
[1:34:12] caught up in that and we met and brother
[1:34:14] Graham said that's the ploy of the of
[1:34:16] the Romanism working down behind the
[1:34:18] scenes to keep you looking at that to
[1:34:19] miss this alright now watch he said he
[1:34:26] said that after the church is united to
[1:34:28] in the council of churches the World
[1:34:29] Council of Churches they have to unite
[1:34:31] to deny and to destroy the message the
[1:34:34] word and they did before brother Branham
[1:34:37] even left they had already put him out
[1:34:40] and he said it's thus saith the Lord
[1:34:42] you're dead and you'll never rise again
[1:34:46] you shut him out and the earthquake and
[1:34:50] in in Alaska said that was the official
[1:34:53] that was the official sign that they had
[1:34:56] put him out see they're just I hope you
[1:35:01] realize we're further down the line
[1:35:03] maybe you think
[1:35:04] now watch here we're watching something
[1:35:06] unfold it's a drama and it's been
[1:35:09] unfolding but it's unfolding clearer and
[1:35:11] clearer and clearer and you're clear and
[1:35:14] you see you go back to what he said you
[1:35:15] say my goodness there it is all right
[1:35:18] now I'm just got just a little bit more
[1:35:22] time watch I'll listen I know you are
[1:35:27] thank you god bless you
[1:35:29] they have turned down the word the
[1:35:31] churches had they cannot accept it
[1:35:32] because it's against their
[1:35:33] denominational Creed no matter how many
[1:35:35] pillars the fire would hang in the midst
[1:35:37] of people how many people how many
[1:35:38] things would be foretold in happened all
[1:35:40] the great signs he promises us say they
[1:35:42] cannot do it therefore therefore they
[1:35:49] are uniting themselves now this is in
[1:35:51] the Uniting time and sign 8 1863
[1:35:53] paragraph 57 therefore they are uniting
[1:35:56] themselves now and your pastor here many
[1:35:58] can tell you that's reading that they
[1:36:00] that they are have the ekam they have
[1:36:04] the ekam unikom movement of the world
[1:36:06] and there's a Lutheran minister over it
[1:36:08] now watch what he said that if there
[1:36:09] comes a disaster would happen in this
[1:36:12] neighborhood here if we're not united
[1:36:14] with that eka miracle move then our
[1:36:16] church can be no more be Church and they
[1:36:18] can use it for a storehouse now am I
[1:36:20] saying that what happened no but it's
[1:36:22] your leading that way if they can do one
[1:36:24] little thing she Satan doesn't come all
[1:36:26] at once just throw the whole thing out
[1:36:27] little by little but that's the way the
[1:36:30] god bride takes the land to little by
[1:36:33] little it just keeps opening watch them
[1:36:36] they can do that whether they can do
[1:36:38] next if they do that what they can do
[1:36:40] next him I take you scared no fear not
[1:36:44] because oh he who loves his own loves
[1:36:47] them to the end you have nothing to fear

[1:36:53] the word stay with the word don't give
[1:36:55] way to nothing anything this contrary
[1:36:58] the word separate from it it brother
[1:37:00] Browne said anyone anything anybody that
[1:37:04] is 2 draws you away from that word
[1:37:06] contrary to that word he said leave it
[1:37:11] don't had nothing to do with it
[1:37:16] all right remember the Prophet said he
[1:37:20] said God's Word calls for a total
[1:37:21] separation from unbelief all right now
[1:37:26] you people he said what do you what am I
[1:37:29] what's he asking you to do stand with
[1:37:31] the word rely on God all right
[1:37:37] you people okay and he goes on to say if
[1:37:44] any brother or anyone a minister would
[1:37:46] give spiritual blessing we could be
[1:37:47] shocked for it it goes on down the line
[1:37:49] okay now super sign 7/8 62 and you
[1:37:53] people I say I've got to say this don't
[1:37:56] let nobody poke something down your neck

[1:38:25] image of the beast we know that all the
[1:38:28] churches uniting are unite themselves
[1:38:30] together to fight communism don't you
[1:38:32] worry about it

[1:44:30] not be done like they think it ought to
[1:44:32] be and you preach the word under the
[1:44:37] leadership of the Holy Spirit and bring
[1:44:39] forth a word of faith for this season
[1:44:41] that is love being projected to the
[1:44:44] people it's the light upon the pathway

[1:45:01] sees what's happening oh my he says all
[1:45:10] right don't you pay attention to that
[1:45:12] iron curtain you watch that purple one
[1:45:14] read foxes
[1:45:15] the martyrs and you'll see this you know
[1:45:18] what she did you watch when the bride
[1:45:22] takes her leave
[1:45:23] you think sparks didn't fly you watch
[1:45:25] Inquisition then tell you who's ruling
[1:45:31] and we've got people rights and then
[1:45:33] right among the Pete right among I say
[1:45:35] among the message that will blow the
[1:45:38] whistle on the people believe in this
[1:45:40] pure word but God has appointed that
[1:45:43] because God will show there's nothing
[1:45:46] gonna touch his bride

[1:45:50] you can't move her off of believing this
[1:45:52] truth you can't I don't care what
[1:45:54] happens just the breath away is a new
[1:45:56] body it's the word page 265 of the
[1:46:06] church age book I'm coming down to an
[1:46:09] end now just bear with me page 265 you
[1:46:13] see I preach differently in some
[1:46:15] preachers but leave me alone I feel good
[1:46:18] this way I'm different but I'm happy all
[1:46:22] right
[1:46:23] 265 these are going to be important
[1:46:26] things so don't get so tired now and
[1:46:28] lose me now bottom at page 264 it was a
[1:46:36] keep you I want to bring this in because
[1:46:38] I think this is very important keep your
[1:46:40] skirts clean he reads a message he that
[1:46:42] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[1:46:44] white raiment and then it goes on to say
[1:46:47] repetition of verse 4 of Revelation I
[1:46:51] don't I've three for a few who have not
[1:46:54] defiled their garments now we used to
[1:46:56] have a saying years ago no doubt was
[1:46:57] taken from this verse it was keep your
[1:46:59] skirts clean now listen this isn't this
[1:47:01] is a diss to be something joking it
[1:47:04] meant don't get involved in questionable
[1:47:06] things others will be involved and you
[1:47:12] might be tempted to be involved you have
[1:47:19] one thing to do rely upon God
[1:47:23] keep your focus on that eternal word
[1:47:27] that's present among us keep feeding in
[1:47:31] the book ask God for revelation keep
[1:47:34] your eyes on Jesus the Living Word the
[1:47:37] revealed word your husband said someone
[1:47:43] might even try to involve you but stay
[1:47:45] clear of it all by steering a course
[1:47:48] away from it now God is going to reward
[1:47:51] those who follow this advice there okay
[1:47:55] now I'm jumping down here just about a
[1:47:57] few sentences down you know we're living
[1:47:59] in the end time it is the age that the
[1:48:02] churches are going to come together and
[1:48:06] they are even now controlling world
[1:48:09] politics they will soon control the
[1:48:14] finances of the world they you won't be
[1:48:20] able to buy or to sell now let me just
[1:48:22] back this up a minute okay I've got that
[1:48:25] coming okay keep that in mind you won't
[1:48:27] be able to buy or sell you will lose all
[1:48:30] because brother manna makes a comment on
[1:48:33] that and buying and selling let me just
[1:48:34] tell you right now he said thank God the
[1:48:37] church will be enjoying your great three
[1:48:38] and a half years in glory don't have to
[1:48:40] go through that so I want you to realize
[1:48:46] how close are we
[1:48:49] may be I pray not is that door closed
[1:48:55] I don't know and you don't know and
[1:49:00] nobody conjectures it but what we do say
[1:49:03] we know the bride's still here so we
[1:49:06] knew Mercy's here for those that can
[1:49:08] hear the word and still mercy to offer
[1:49:13] it to the others even brother brown said
[1:49:17] you would even be preaching the souls in
[1:49:19] prison third pull lot could be said
[1:49:26] about that too couldn't it okay now
[1:49:27] let's keep going but watch what he says
[1:49:29] he said you lose all those who stay true
[1:49:33] to God and keep their garments clean
[1:49:34] from the defilement
[1:49:36] this world system of church orders will
[1:49:39] be physically bereft burette means
[1:49:42] deprived of lacking something we must
[1:49:45] see that's what the graph means deprived
[1:49:48] of or lacking something be physically
[1:49:52] physically bereft not spiritually
[1:49:54] physically he said there will be
[1:49:57] presented to them a great temptation to
[1:49:59] give in watch this preachers will give
[1:50:06] in with the excuse that they will serve
[1:50:09] God within the framework of the
[1:50:12] Antichrist be system they will give in
[1:50:15] to the flatteries and the blandishments
[1:50:17] of the hierarchy and the people will
[1:50:21] follow these false shepherds right into
[1:50:24] the slaughter but in the judgment they
[1:50:26] will be found naked they will not be
[1:50:29] given why those white robes neither will
[1:50:32] they walk with him I don't know how much
[1:50:37] the bride's gonna face this but I do
[1:50:40] know one thing we won't give in it's
[1:50:45] just all there's to it you say what's
[1:50:47] gonna do how close is it brother Davis
[1:50:49] said close the token will discern it you
[1:50:53] say where is your confidence in him not
[1:50:59] in me not in my reasoning not in my
[1:51:01] thinking not in my feelings not it my
[1:51:03] not having or having or not having every
[1:51:05] day it's in him I pray God give us grace
[1:51:12] never to move from that spot and we
[1:51:14] won't if we're elect seed and Christ is
[1:51:17] revealed in us because you can't receive
[1:51:19] Christ then Christ leave you can't have
[1:51:20] Christ in you then taken out of you
[1:51:23] that's all there is to it once you're in
[1:51:27] him and he's in you identified you're
[1:51:29] accepted you're already approved you're
[1:51:31] already approved all the way out to the

[1:51:44] it's already sealed in the other day of
[1:51:46] redemption yes
[1:51:48] getting back here
[1:51:49] preachers will give in and the people
[1:51:52] will follow these false shepherds right
[1:51:53] in the slaughter but in the judgement
[1:51:55] they'll be naked they will not be given
[1:51:57] white robes neither will they walk with
[1:51:59] him in the judgement do you see brothers
[1:52:00] sister in the judgement Brides not being
[1:52:03] judged all right now the people will

[1:53:57] alright now let's go to page 313 what's
[1:54:06] this this temptation is exactly like the
[1:54:10] temptation that Eden's it will be very
[1:54:12] inviting proposition held up in direct
[1:54:15] opposition of gods commanded word watch
[1:54:19] what the opposite watch what this
[1:54:21] temptation it'll be a very inviting
[1:54:23] proposition you know Eve was and it was
[1:54:26] very inviting she wanted a reason she
[1:54:29] was she wanted to know why God said that
[1:54:32] and he gave her a reason don't you add
[1:54:37] your opinion don't you even try to add
[1:54:40] your opinion don't think brother branham
[1:54:42] it that he meant exactly what he said
[1:54:44] and you leave it alone unless you don't
[1:54:46] understand leave it alone don't put your
[1:54:47] interpretation to it if he said the
[1:54:50] scripture meant this believe it he took
[1:54:54] a scripture he took it back over here he
[1:54:56] said admit this who are you to put your
[1:55:00] opinion to that scripture and her to
[1:55:03] that prophets word and say it didn't
[1:55:04] mean that prophets are the very
[1:55:06] interpretation of the word don't tell me
[1:55:09] you dot if you don't believe that then
[1:55:11] you don't believe he was vindicated
[1:55:12] prophet of the hour who the Word of God
[1:55:14] comes to all right now so watch quit
[1:55:22] putting our interpretation don't put
[1:55:24] your thought about it don't put your
[1:55:25] opinion on it
[1:55:33] direct opposition just like he did Eve
[1:55:35] to gods commanded Word and yet from the
[1:55:38] standpoint of human reasoning it will be
[1:55:40] so very right and so enlightening and so
[1:55:43] life-giving to fool the world watch this
[1:55:46] thing coming up to that so simple why
[1:55:49] brother we lose all well I'll just let
[1:55:51] me read it here okay life-giving only
[1:55:54] the very elect will not be fooled the
[1:55:57] temptation will come as follows ooh now
[1:56:04] we have a heads up here's the way the
[1:56:09] temptation is going to come he told us
[1:56:11] yes sir it's gonna be just like it
[1:56:13] wasn't Eve yes sir it's gonna come right
[1:56:15] now I'm very religious yes sir it's
[1:56:17] gonna be an organizational something and
[1:56:18] it's gonna be so right it's gonna fool
[1:56:20] because it's gonna look so reasonably
[1:56:23] correct why certainly he didn't mean
[1:56:26] that he meant this you better get the
[1:56:32] token brother sister you young people
[1:56:34] I'm not talking somebody above your
[1:56:36] heads you've got to have the token we
[1:56:38] can't be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:56:41] Christ and don't you stop there you go
[1:56:42] on to the word and say God you promised
[1:56:44] me to fill me with the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:56:47] not gonna see steady you're not gonna be
[1:56:48] satisfied until I'm filled and I know
[1:56:51] that I know that I know that I know
[1:56:53] you're living in me period don't you

[1:57:01] your mommy and daddy believes don't you
[1:57:02] take this is just some religion this
[1:57:04] message is a person Jesus Christ amen
[1:57:15] there's nothing else nothing less it's
[1:57:18] what it is and it's your only way to get
[1:57:21] out of here you will never you will
[1:57:23] never make the rapture because you
[1:57:25] believe this message as a religion
[1:57:27] because it's what we believe in the
[1:57:28] house because my mommy and daddy do
[1:57:30] you're not saved because your mother and
[1:57:32] father are your say because you have
[1:57:34] personally accepted the blood of Calvary
[1:57:37] to be your way of escape and believe
[1:57:39] that that blood is shed of life and that
[1:57:41] life was meant for you
[1:57:43] and you've got to be filled with it
[1:57:47] hallelujah
[1:57:50] you accept it no other way
[1:57:52] don't you let the things of this world
[1:57:53] there's nothing as important as meeting
[1:57:57] him in your soul it's okay if I spit in
[1:58:10] snot and I'm sorry but look at how it's
[1:58:16] preached listen to what's said watch
[1:58:21] what he's continues on to say now here's
[1:58:26] the here's the temptation the ecumenical
[1:58:28] move is there any question now that
[1:58:31] there is an economical move that started
[1:58:35] on what seemed to be a beautiful and
[1:58:37] blessed principle fulfilling Christ's
[1:58:39] prayer that we all might be one mother
[1:58:41] Bram said not that one but one with the
[1:58:44] word one with the anointed word in you
[1:58:47] that's the one this God expects alright
[1:58:55] what the Pope says oh I'll look at
[1:58:57] brother my brothers and sisters come and
[1:59:01] be one with us Jesus prayed we'd all be
[1:59:04] one one with what it's not the word now
[1:59:15] that we all might be one he said
[1:59:18] that principle that movement that
[1:59:20] temptation that move becomes so strong
[1:59:24] politically that she bears pressure upon
[1:59:28] the government to cause all to join with
[1:59:32] her either directly or through adherence
[1:59:36] to the principles enacted into law so
[1:59:44] that no people will be recognized as
[1:59:46] actual churches it's a less under direct
[1:59:49] or indirect denomination domination of
[1:59:53] this council I could care less
[1:59:56] because I am the church you are the
[1:59:59] church this is a building we come
[2:00:01] together as God said to do to come
[2:00:03] together thank God we still can but we
[2:00:08] come you come I come as a part of that
[2:00:10] church and we come to bring strength for
[2:00:15] one another strength that we bring is
[2:00:19] that is the Holy Ghost revelation of the
[2:00:23] hour
[2:00:24] spirit of the word living there's no
[2:00:28] strength we have no strength in herself
[2:00:29] it's only him the Bible didn't say here
[2:00:32] you her it was here you him all right
[2:00:37] all right but under her under him she's
[2:00:42] the final word yes now watch this that
[2:00:50] would we go on little groups will lose
[2:00:52] Chartres privileges they'll lose all
[2:00:55] property spiritual rights with the
[2:00:58] people for example right now unless the
[2:01:00] local Ministerial Association approves
[2:01:02] in many of most cities one cannot run a
[2:01:04] building for religious services to
[2:01:06] become chaplains in the armed services
[2:01:07] etc it has now mandatory to be
[2:01:09] recognized as acceptable to the
[2:01:11] trinitarian ecumenical groups as this
[2:01:14] pressure increases and it will it will
[2:01:18] said twice it's hard it'll be higher it
[2:01:22] will be harder to resist for to resist
[2:01:25] it's the loose privilege so many will be
[2:01:28] tempted to go along for they will feel
[2:01:30] that it's better to serve God publicly
[2:01:31] in the framework of this organization
[2:01:35] then not to serve God at all publicly
[2:01:38] organization was the mark of the beast
[2:01:45] you see that a denominational system the
[2:01:48] mark right there it is well well let you
[2:01:51] will let you keep why will even lift up
[2:01:53] the prophets name for you let you keep
[2:01:55] that will let you well let's just serve
[2:01:57] God I'm it just just do the do the
[2:02:00] things we require here no problem you
[2:02:04] can still propagated
[2:02:12] but he said they would rather work in
[2:02:15] the framework of this organization that
[2:02:17] does serve God at all publicly but they
[2:02:20] do err to believe the devil's lies to
[2:02:22] serve Satan even though you might want
[2:02:24] to call him Jehovah but the elect will
[2:02:26] not be fooled furthermore as the elect
[2:02:29] will not only be kept but as this move
[2:02:32] becomes the image erected to the beast
[2:02:34] the Saints will be gone in the rapture
[2:02:37] now where are we
[2:02:40] look all close as this move becomes the
[2:02:45] image erected to the Beast the Saints
[2:02:48] will be gone in the rapture now that can
[2:02:50] we we can say we're already gone the
[2:02:52] rapture but we say we're not gone in the
[2:02:56] rapture spiritually I'm gone in the
[2:02:58] rapture physically it's got to catch up
[2:03:04] what are we looking for change in my
[2:03:07] body I'm looking for what's already
[2:03:11] begun in me that's revealed in me that's
[2:03:15] already started in me I have the
[2:03:17] substance of it I got the very evidence
[2:03:19] and I'm included in that body change
[2:03:23] amen
[2:03:24] all right and this little delightful
[2:03:27] wine some movement that started out as
[2:03:28] in fellowship and Ephesus will become
[2:03:30] the monster of Satan that defiles and
[2:03:32] deceives the whole world for the church
[2:03:34] system of the Roman Catholic and
[2:03:36] Protestants and coming together will
[2:03:37] control the whole wealth of the world
[2:03:39] system and force the whole earth into
[2:03:42] its religious trap or will kill them by
[2:03:46] refusing them the privileges of buying
[2:03:48] and selling whereby they will make a
[2:03:49] living this will be accomplished simply
[2:03:52] for the harlot daughters are all but
[2:03:54] gone back to her
[2:03:55] in the meantime Rome has acquired nearly
[2:03:58] all the supplies of gold the Jews have
[2:04:00] the bonds all the paper at the right
[2:04:03] time all the paper at the at the right
[2:04:05] time the harlot will destroy the present
[2:04:08] excuse me the Jews have bonds and all
[2:04:10] the paper periods at the right time the
[2:04:13] harlot will destroy the present day
[2:04:15] money system by calling in all the paper
[2:04:18] and demanding gold
[2:04:20] with no gold the system Falls the Jews
[2:04:23] will be trapped and come into an
[2:04:25] alliance and the harlot Church will take
[2:04:27] over the whole world brother Branham
[2:04:29] said before she comes into that Alliance
[2:04:32] the church is gone she goes up I forget
[2:04:36] the exact word goes up or gone that's
[2:04:39] exactly right
[2:04:40] so brother's sister this isn't the story
[2:04:45] we see this thing how long I don't know
[2:04:48] when I don't know that I know we're here
[2:04:50] I know we're here any time that last one
[2:04:58] may be in I don't know I can't know you
[2:05:01] won't know I don't know but it'll tell
[2:05:03] it eventually yeah I just pray God let
[2:05:07] me preach like there still can and tell
[2:05:10] the truth of the hour okay
[2:05:15] you trapped the harlot Church we'll take
[2:05:17] over now let me just let me hurry right
[2:05:19] here now okay now I'm moving right down
[2:05:21] now third seal first seal three 1863
[2:05:27] now when he when he gets all the money
[2:05:30] under control he will break this
[2:05:31] covenant with the Jews that's after he
[2:05:33] gets it all in control the bride's gone
[2:05:35] he'll break the covenant with the Jews
[2:05:36] that during that three and a half weeks
[2:05:38] three and a half years covered with the
[2:05:41] Jews as daniel said he would do it in
[2:05:43] the midst of the last three and a half
[2:05:45] last half of the 70 weeks of Daniel
[2:05:47] that's three and a half years then
[2:05:49] brother what will he do he will have all
[2:05:51] the world trade the Commerce a pact with
[2:05:53] the world because he will hold the
[2:05:54] wealth of the world completely and
[2:05:56] during that time then two prophets will
[2:05:58] rise on the scene that's that's
[2:05:59] revelations 11 Moses Elijah and called
[2:06:02] that hundred and forty-four thousand
[2:06:04] then what will take place then the mark
[2:06:06] of the beast of revelations 13 will set
[2:06:08] in because he holds the Commerce trade
[2:06:10] and everything of the world and what
[2:06:12] will take place then the mark of the
[2:06:13] beast will come that no man can buy or
[2:06:15] sell except him that has the mark of the
[2:06:17] beast
[2:06:17] thank God the church the church will be
[2:06:20] enjoying a great three and one-half
[2:06:22] years in glory don't have to go through
[2:06:24] that
[2:06:28] page 367 or 376 I'm sorry church age
[2:06:32] book I'm sorry I don't mean that I just
[2:06:35] but I'm so close to finishing up I can't
[2:06:37] stop now 376 now watch how can all this
[2:06:43] go to there yeah I would suggest the
[2:06:45] same time that you read you read also
[2:06:47] with 375 with it now he talks about as
[2:06:51] the image erected to the Beast okay
[2:06:53] Roman or its revelations we just talked
[2:06:56] about that and he talks about him that
[2:07:02] has wisdom let him count the number of
[2:07:03] the beast 666 I saw that right above the
[2:07:06] throne right and right the Vatican norm
[2:07:09] Roman numerals exactly what he said but
[2:07:13] she was headed she was healed of her
[2:07:15] death stroke that that's Rome talking
[2:07:17] about how she was healed up came
[2:07:18] paganism became a religious system she
[2:07:24] joined to the nominal church Church okay
[2:07:26] - I may just pass up here let me get
[2:07:27] town Rome is not going it alone let me
[2:07:33] just put it this start right here her
[2:07:34] daughters are right with her and she
[2:07:37] will take over our over absolute
[2:07:39] authority by the World Council of
[2:07:40] Churches where's their authority who's
[2:07:42] she speaking through a religious system
[2:07:45] with with which looks like the Blessed
[2:07:48] principle watch this now you'll take it
[2:07:51] over
[2:07:51] this may seem far-fetched to some but
[2:07:54] actually it is very plain for all to see
[2:07:56] because right now the churches are
[2:07:58] controlling politics well what do you
[2:08:00] know
[2:08:04] all right and at the opportune time will
[2:08:08] manifests exactly how great is that
[2:08:10] control watch these words the eka
[2:08:13] miracle move will end up with Rome at
[2:08:15] the head even though the people did not
[2:08:18] envision it that way well I thought the
[2:08:24] mark of the beast was I thought the
[2:08:25] Beast was the take oh I thought the
[2:08:26] Antichrist was to take over
[2:08:31] well it is but they how can this nice
[2:08:35] quiet congenial religious man that loves
[2:08:38] everybody all the Protestants want us
[2:08:42] all to become one how could he be
[2:08:45] Antichrist the personage of Satan now
[2:08:53] watch
[2:08:54] they didn't envision it that way so in
[2:08:56] revelation 17 it states the whole the
[2:08:58] Mystery Babylon seeded the Beast she's
[2:09:00] controlling the last and fourth Empire
[2:09:01] the Roman Church is doing that with the
[2:09:04] world church system under her rome will
[2:09:06] control will rome will be controlling
[2:09:09] and this image church system is the
[2:09:11] image will be obedient to church to Rome
[2:09:14] because Rome controls the gold of the
[2:09:16] world thus all the people will have to
[2:09:18] belong to the world system or be at the
[2:09:20] mercy of the elements they cannot buy or
[2:09:22] sell we've been through that I'm just
[2:09:24] going ahead now okay the mark well
[2:09:28] without the mark of the beast in the
[2:09:31] hand or the head the mark in the head
[2:09:34] means they will have to take the
[2:09:36] doctrine of the world church system
[2:09:38] which is trinitarianism etc and the mark
[2:09:42] in the hand which means to do the will
[2:09:44] of the world Church with this great
[2:09:47] power the church system will persecute
[2:09:49] the true bride this image will try to
[2:09:51] keep the bride from preaching and
[2:09:53] teaching etc her ministers will be
[2:09:56] forbidden to give comfort and truth to
[2:09:57] the people who need it and before the
[2:09:59] Antichrist in person takes over the
[2:10:01] complete world system the churches the
[2:10:04] true church will be taken away from this
[2:10:06] world to be with the Lord God will catch
[2:10:08] away his bride for the great marriage
[2:10:10] supper of the Lamb amen
[2:10:14] all right all right I'm just gonna back
[2:10:22] see if I need to get this I think we
[2:10:26] about done now
[2:10:29] fifty-two
[2:10:34] I'll just read this part this page 352
[2:10:38] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:10:40] now young people
[2:10:41] everybody you can never have your eyes
[2:10:45] opened to a true spiritual revelation of
[2:10:48] the word a man without the Spirit is
[2:10:51] blind to God and his truth I would say
[2:10:54] don't you let nobody wife husband
[2:10:57] children friends anything keep you from
[2:11:01] meeting him if you have that pull down
[2:11:05] inside of your soul if you know if

[2:11:12] satisfied until you come in and reveal
[2:11:15] yourself to me in me do you love him
[2:11:22] see if I can close this off right here
[2:11:27] the ministry will soon will end soon the
[2:11:30] expected son will appear himself that's
[2:11:33] exactly what we're looking for the
[2:11:35] church has come from justification
[2:11:37] through Lutheran sanctification through
[2:11:39] Wes leads into the baptism of the Holy
[2:11:40] Ghost through the Pentecostals and now
[2:11:42] winding up to the headstone ministry
[2:11:45] that's bride time bride age headstone
[2:11:48] ministry typing all the time right into
[2:11:51] that perfect into that perfect he said
[2:11:54] typing all the time right into that
