[47:32] hallelujah to be a chosen generation
[47:38] a royal priesthood
[47:41] a peculiar people oh my brothers and
[47:45] sisters the world would say that
[47:47] word peculiar might mean weird or
[47:50] strange but the scripture is actually
[47:53] showing us
[47:54] we're different than the world around us
[47:59] oh aren't you glad this morning you're
[48:01] peculiar
[48:02] amen i don't want to be identified with
[48:05] words only
[48:07] amen it's not words only i can say
[48:10] you know it's crazy it's crazy my
[48:12] brother and sister but in the world we
[48:14] live in this might sound
[48:16] i don't mean it to sound humorous i mean
[48:18] it's serious but but people are saying i
[48:20] i
[48:21] i look like this but i identify as that
[48:25] and you realize what that is
[48:28] that is actually in the spiritual realm
[48:30] people
[48:31] saying i identify as a christian
[48:35] but i'm really this here
[48:38] and that spirit come out in the world
[48:40] and now men are saying they're women and
[48:42] women are saying they're men and
[48:43] people are identifying as this and
[48:45] identifying as that and
[48:47] and you see that spirit moves right out
[48:50] and it
[48:51] ripples out into society and we can say
[48:54] we're anything
[48:56] but i want to be a christian i don't
[48:59] want to say i'm a christian i want to be
[49:01] a christian and the word says that we
[49:04] are
[49:05] therefore my brother my sister is within
[49:08] our grasp
[49:09] to claim our inheritance to claim our
[49:13] promise
[49:14] hallelujah well i just want to put this
[49:18] out
[49:19] as a reminder to the church
[49:23] this coming saturday ten o'clock brother
[49:26] yannick
[49:27] sister sharon i'm going to take their
[49:29] final step in their identity as husband
[49:32] and wife
[49:33] and so let's remember as they always say
[49:36] save the date but it's good to save the
[49:38] date but i want you to save the time
[49:40] 10 am and the wedding to start at 10
[49:44] 30. so come let's worship a little let's
[49:47] create an
[49:47] atmosphere in the church this
[49:50] is not a secular wedding we
[49:54] are not bound by a tradition
[49:57] we're christians and christians come to
[49:59] the house of god
[50:01] to worship hallelujah so don't forget
[50:04] that
[50:04] amen and the other thing i was going to
[50:08] share what was that brother jason
[50:13] oh my forgive me my mind is just
[50:16] spinning
[50:17] god bless you mothers happy mother's day
[50:22] each and every one of you our sisters
[50:25] mothers in waiting
[50:26] and mothers that are god bless you each
[50:29] and every one i
[50:30] always am a little bit bad on the
[50:32] tradition i just extend this
[50:34] to every one of my sisters young and old
[50:37] god bless you today
[50:39] amen let's just turn in our bibles
[50:42] this morning god bless you thank you
[50:44] brother jason i
[50:45] i so thoroughly enjoyed our song service
[50:48] this morning it just stirred my heart
[50:51] you know saints i i don't say this
[50:54] anything other than just to explain
[50:58] i don't know a condition you might say
[51:01] sister jerry and i suffered from a
[51:03] condition this morning and it was called
[51:05] worship
[51:07] we're sitting in our bedroom on the side
[51:09] of the bed this morning
[51:11] just crying of the wonderful things
[51:14] amen god has done amen
[51:18] his grace is mercy
[51:21] oh my brother and sister i i i don't
[51:23] know you see
[51:24] it's not something that you can just
[51:26] shake off it just
[51:27] it just lingers with you and you know we
[51:30] we would
[51:31] sing the song which we don't sing too
[51:33] much here in the church definitely did
[51:35] as i was growing
[51:36] up at the end of service almost every
[51:37] service they would sing the song
[51:39] take the name of jesus with you
[51:42] amen it doesn't just leave we walk out
[51:45] the door it's done we left it here
[51:47] it lingers with us and we take that and
[51:50] the presence of god stirs our heart and
[51:53] i just pray today you come hungry i pray
[51:57] today you come with
[51:58] great liberty
[52:01] now those that would understand will
[52:03] understand of what i'm fixing to say
[52:06] there's sometimes things in life
[52:09] god laid upon my heart this
[52:13] sermon and i thought
[52:16] isn't that beautiful and then it dawned
[52:19] on me that mother's day was coming in a
[52:21] couple weeks and
[52:22] i thought i'm going to share this
[52:25] font a mother's call to action today
[52:29] amen but those who will understand will
[52:31] understand that some things are laid
[52:33] upon the heart
[52:34] god speaking preparing laying the
[52:37] groundwork
[52:38] long before the things of life
[52:41] rise up to face us
[52:44] and so i just pray today that each and
[52:46] every one of you just receives the word
[52:48] of god today with an open heart
[52:50] knowing that god loves you and he
[52:52] expresses his love to us
[52:54] through his word amen he comes and he
[52:58] speaks to us through his
[53:00] word and i am a firm believer
[53:04] my brother and sister that this bible
[53:07] this word of god covers
[53:10] every need that we have yes
[53:14] god did not forget one thing that's
[53:17] right
[53:20] god's will is his
[53:24] word second kings the fourth chapter
[53:30] amen let's just move to that brother
[53:33] isaac
[53:40] hallelujah
[53:57] now there cried a certain woman of the
[54:00] wives of the sons of the prophets
[54:02] unto elisha saying thy
[54:05] servant my husband is dead
[54:10] time of grieving for her a time that
[54:14] no one would really desire to face
[54:18] and thou knowest that thy servant did
[54:21] fear the lord
[54:23] and the creditor i want to make emphasis
[54:28] the creditor not just
[54:32] any creditor the creditor
[54:36] is come to take unto him my two sons
[54:40] to be born men and elisha said unto her
[54:45] what shall i do for thee
[54:48] now sometimes saints we read the
[54:50] scripture and we just read right on
[54:52] right we just go right through it
[54:56] but elisha asked her a question what
[54:58] shall i do
[54:59] for thee
[55:06] inspiration strikes him
[55:10] tell me a comma
[55:14] denotes a pause
[55:18] more inspiration strikes him
[55:22] what hast thou in the house
[55:25] and she said thine handmaid hath not
[55:28] anything in the house
[55:31] save a pot of oil
[55:34] then he said go borrow thee vessels
[55:38] abroad of
[55:39] all thy neighbors
[55:43] even empty vessels borrow
[55:47] not a few and when thou art come in
[55:50] thou shalt shut the door upon thee and
[55:53] upon thy sons
[55:55] and shall pour out unto all those
[55:58] vessels
[55:59] and thou shalt set aside that which is
[56:02] full so she went from him
[56:06] and shut the door upon her and upon her
[56:09] sons
[56:10] who brought the vessels to her and she
[56:12] poured out
[56:14] and it came to pass when the vessels
[56:17] were full
[56:18] that she said unto her son bring me yet
[56:20] a vessel and he said unto her
[56:23] there is not a vessel more
[56:26] and the oil stayed then she came
[56:30] and told the man of god and he said go
[56:32] and sell the oil
[56:34] pay thy debt and live thou and thy
[56:37] children of the rest heavenly father we
[56:41] ask
[56:41] lord for you to come and open the word
[56:44] to us lord just
[56:46] reveal to us the deeper meaning father
[56:48] may it not be superficial
[56:51] may it not just be a story but may we
[56:54] recognize
[56:55] father what we are truly reading
[56:58] today speak to our hearts i pray in the
[57:01] name of jesus christ
[57:03] amen hallelujah
[57:06] you may be seated saints
[57:12] you know i've never been much of what
[57:14] you might call a theme preacher you know
[57:16] to preach on
[57:17] things it just always felt like whatever
[57:20] god laid upon
[57:21] our heart would be but this is
[57:24] to me might not be significant to you
[57:27] but one of the rare times that
[57:29] before a season or a time would come and
[57:32] it would come to mother's day that the
[57:34] lord dealt with my heart to
[57:36] to speak upon this subject and it goes
[57:40] much deeper and i cannot explain to you
[57:42] as a body of believers
[57:44] uh the confirmations as it were that god
[57:47] gives to us of what he is leading us to
[57:50] but
[57:50] i want to tell you that god already
[57:53] stirring a heart
[57:54] he comes to meet the need amen and the
[57:57] devil comes
[57:58] pouring in the word of god says god
[58:00] would raise up a standard which we can
[58:02] take this if you would allow me to
[58:04] step out and put this when the devil
[58:07] comes pouring in
[58:08] god has already given his word to
[58:11] counter
[58:12] the devil amen we are not now in the
[58:16] world we live in today if you are a
[58:18] hindsight
[58:19] investor you will never see the true
[58:21] benefits
[58:22] of being the investor it will always be
[58:24] this is worth this i should buy some
[58:26] but by the time the hindsight investor
[58:29] chooses to invest the value
[58:31] or the increase has already taken place
[58:34] and they only get just a small segment
[58:36] of what is there and they're always
[58:38] extremely disappointed
[58:40] and my brother and sister the son or
[58:42] daughter of god that
[58:43] lives in the hindsight of the moving of
[58:46] the spirit of god
[58:47] will always sense a degree of
[58:50] disappointment
[58:51] because the moving of the spirit never
[58:53] seems to strike them
[58:55] fully in measure that's why we should
[58:57] come to the house of god
[58:59] prayed up can someone say amen and we
[59:01] should come
[59:02] hungry therefore we are not a hindsight
[59:06] recipient of the moving of the holy
[59:08] spirit
[59:09] when we come in anticipation when we
[59:11] come
[59:12] recognizing the sign of the time now
[59:14] look it's not a great sign of the time
[59:17] to come to church
[59:18] ready prayed up prophet of god said that
[59:20] should be
[59:21] almost in my interpretation i want to
[59:23] put it that way
[59:24] it should be a mandatory thing
[59:27] as a believer that we come ready to
[59:29] receive from god
[59:31] amen not that we come to church to get
[59:33] rid of the spirits of the workplace get
[59:36] rid of the spirits of the world outside
[59:38] or
[59:39] the spirit that where satan's been
[59:40] fighting you and that's not don't come
[59:43] to get rid of that my brother and sister
[59:45] you've been empowered already to have
[59:48] deliverance from the spirits of this
[59:50] age you come to the house of god to
[59:52] receive the reinforcement
[59:54] of the word that prepares you for your
[59:56] next battle
[59:58] it is not in the hindsight of to deal
[1:00:00] with what is behind you
[1:00:02] but god is bringing the word to prepare
[1:00:04] you for your next battle
[1:00:05] you see often times we say well i i've
[1:00:08] been going through it and praise god
[1:00:10] the preaching of the word the pastor the
[1:00:12] minister whatever
[1:00:13] hit on what i was going through see
[1:00:15] we're behind
[1:00:16] the circle when we should be in front we
[1:00:18] come not to play
[1:00:20] catch up but we come to being reinforced
[1:00:22] for the next battle
[1:00:23] so i encourage you dig in dig deep dig
[1:00:26] down to the rock pitch out all the cans
[1:00:29] pitch out everything until you are
[1:00:31] anchored at the rock
[1:00:33] and then god will reinforce you because
[1:00:35] god is raising the standard
[1:00:37] satan will come he will find a standard
[1:00:40] already prepared
[1:00:41] oh thank you lord hallelujah you see god
[1:00:44] did not
[1:00:45] come to to have us live like most of us
[1:00:49] live and when i say most my brothers and
[1:00:50] sister
[1:00:51] i'm not excluding i'm not standing here
[1:00:53] as some super spiritual man
[1:00:55] that woe unto you guys but you know when
[1:00:58] we
[1:00:58] do not stay in our proper position we
[1:01:01] live the life of a yo-yo christian
[1:01:03] and we don't want to be yo-yos do we
[1:01:05] amen we don't want to be the up and down
[1:01:07] the up and down the up and down
[1:01:09] what we want to do is be prepared and
[1:01:11] hang on but often times now
[1:01:13] i was going to touch on that this
[1:01:15] morning but the lord just kind of led me
[1:01:17] to leave that out
[1:01:18] but talking in the revelation of jesus
[1:01:20] christ uh
[1:01:21] in the seals there brother branham's
[1:01:23] talking about how
[1:01:24] that uh happened to adam was and said he
[1:01:27] listened to the reasoning
[1:01:29] that satan had reasoned with eve and
[1:01:32] adam listened to that
[1:01:33] and he let go of the word of god to take
[1:01:36] a holds of that
[1:01:38] and in that he lost his fellowship and
[1:01:41] his inheritance my brother and sister we
[1:01:44] were called
[1:01:45] to live one our fellowship or to
[1:01:48] our inheritance we're not called to that
[1:01:51] this is the age
[1:01:52] this is the day this is a season that a
[1:01:55] bride is rising
[1:01:56] up victorious she is not going to
[1:01:59] fall again this is not the time the word
[1:02:02] of god's not talking about
[1:02:03] a bride our second eve as it were
[1:02:05] falling again
[1:02:06] and another raising a resurrection of
[1:02:09] that this
[1:02:10] is a season that the bride of christ
[1:02:12] comes to full fruition
[1:02:15] there is no avenue there is no
[1:02:18] foundation laid for something beyond
[1:02:21] amen either that or we have to go back
[1:02:24] through
[1:02:25] to malachi 3
[1:02:29] because there's only two anointings of
[1:02:31] that coming
[1:02:33] of that calling to anointing so it's
[1:02:35] either back with john
[1:02:37] or it's here today
[1:02:41] well hallelujah i i don't really like
[1:02:43] the world we live in but i don't know
[1:02:45] that i want to go back to walking
[1:02:47] everywhere i go
[1:02:50] i don't know that i want to go back to
[1:02:52] that i certainly
[1:02:54] spiritually don't want to go back to
[1:02:56] that because you see we have the
[1:02:58] culmination of the revelation of all the
[1:03:00] ages
[1:03:01] and it's been laid out before us today
[1:03:04] it's right here at our hands
[1:03:06] what they could only look at in a
[1:03:07] pre-figure we are seeing with open eyes
[1:03:10] now look there's many things we do not
[1:03:12] completely see but we're seeing it
[1:03:14] unfold
[1:03:15] right before our eyes today hallelujah
[1:03:19] amen amen
[1:03:28] hallelujah
[1:03:32] you know as a minister sometimes you
[1:03:34] just don't like it when you get ahead of
[1:03:35] yourself
[1:03:37] but as we look i want to make emphasis
[1:03:39] here that this woman
[1:03:41] they lived in church they were a part of
[1:03:44] the ministry they
[1:03:45] recognized the prophet elisha and the
[1:03:47] ministry that god had given him
[1:03:49] and her husband had served in that
[1:03:51] ministry he had been
[1:03:53] a part of that and now he has gone from
[1:03:55] the scene and we see this in the natural
[1:03:58] that uh she's speaking to him and saying
[1:04:00] you know what my husband is gone
[1:04:03] and he served the lord he had a fear for
[1:04:05] the lord he was
[1:04:06] faithful in the ministry or the life
[1:04:08] that he was called to
[1:04:10] and all of the struggles that would go
[1:04:12] as she has these sons and
[1:04:14] now she's having to step into a position
[1:04:17] that she
[1:04:18] doesn't really have an answer for and
[1:04:20] she comes back my brother and sister to
[1:04:22] the prophet and
[1:04:23] and she's acknowledging to him the
[1:04:25] creditor has already showed up
[1:04:28] at the door he's already notified us
[1:04:31] that he is coming for a certain debt as
[1:04:33] it were
[1:04:34] and uh when i cannot pay that debt
[1:04:37] the creditor now under the law of the
[1:04:40] day
[1:04:40] is able to come and take my sons
[1:04:44] and take and make them bond men for a
[1:04:47] season for a certain time
[1:04:49] it might even be into the jubilee season
[1:04:52] of seven years uh
[1:04:54] that it would be that they would be
[1:04:55] bound by that and
[1:04:57] my brother and sister she's there she
[1:04:59] didn't run out
[1:05:00] and she didn't go try to find someone
[1:05:02] she didn't go
[1:05:03] to a title alone she didn't go to here
[1:05:06] and there she went back to the word of
[1:05:08] god
[1:05:08] she said god's got an answer for my
[1:05:11] situation god's going to answer
[1:05:13] for the condition that's taking place a
[1:05:15] circumstance
[1:05:16] in my household i can't speak to your
[1:05:18] household i can't speak to your
[1:05:20] household but i can tell you that god
[1:05:22] can speak
[1:05:23] to my household and god will speak to my
[1:05:26] household
[1:05:27] and i say with confidence god will speak
[1:05:29] to your household
[1:05:30] if you will take whatever your need is
[1:05:33] that has you bound right that's what a
[1:05:35] bonds man
[1:05:36] is he's someone who has found whether
[1:05:38] it's by oath or
[1:05:39] documentation or debt or spirit that's
[1:05:42] right
[1:05:48] that's right hallelujah
[1:05:52] there's deliverance
[1:05:56] the world don't have it that's right
[1:06:02] and the creditor want to make emphasis
[1:06:05] the creditor not a creditor
[1:06:08] the creditor the primary one that is
[1:06:11] taking
[1:06:12] and making bond men that's right
[1:06:15] and let me expand this bond men not of
[1:06:17] only just young men but of young women
[1:06:19] also
[1:06:20] making them abound the creditor
[1:06:23] and he's come to take unto him my two
[1:06:27] sons
[1:06:27] to be born men my brothers and sisters
[1:06:30] these were believers of the message of
[1:06:32] the hour
[1:06:32] this was a prophet on the scene they
[1:06:34] were believers of the message of the
[1:06:36] hour
[1:06:36] can i drive that home to you but that
[1:06:39] did not exempt them
[1:06:40] from having their sons taken to be born
[1:06:44] men
[1:06:44] to be bound by the spirit of the age
[1:06:46] that they live in
[1:06:47] bound by the spirit of laodicea but we
[1:06:50] are looking my brother and sister of how
[1:06:53] these
[1:06:53] scenarios how these things play out
[1:06:56] because you see
[1:06:57] it might not even as it were be the
[1:06:59] children's fault
[1:07:05] but the creditor doesn't care
[1:07:09] the creditor doesn't care my brother and
[1:07:12] sister
[1:07:13] but let's talk about the family and the
[1:07:15] personal level
[1:07:17] oftentimes as parents and i think you
[1:07:20] parents will be able to say amen we can
[1:07:22] look back and
[1:07:23] maybe even your children will throw this
[1:07:25] back on your face but you've made
[1:07:27] mistakes
[1:07:31] and the parents themselves might look in
[1:07:33] the mirror and say oh god forgive us
[1:07:34] i wish that i could have done this
[1:07:36] different and done that different
[1:07:38] oh lord forgive me i've had a negative
[1:07:40] influence upon my children
[1:07:42] i have went into as it were a debt and
[1:07:45] now
[1:07:46] the children will be responsible for
[1:07:49] this debt carried forth
[1:07:51] you see the husband now in the grave
[1:07:55] suffers no lingering effect
[1:07:58] of that debt in the natural
[1:08:03] but the word says that we will all stand
[1:08:05] in the judgment and we'll either judge
[1:08:07] ourself now
[1:08:08] or we will be judged then sister jerry
[1:08:10] and i am sorry i don't mean to make
[1:08:12] emphasis it's just what's on my heart
[1:08:13] this morning
[1:08:14] sitting on the side of the bed uh just
[1:08:17] crying this morning just
[1:08:18] in the presence of god knowing my
[1:08:21] brother and sister that we will pay the
[1:08:23] price hear me
[1:08:24] well this morning we will pay the price
[1:08:26] you either get to pay it now
[1:08:28] or you will pay it later oh god anoint
[1:08:32] us i pray today that we would pay the
[1:08:33] price today
[1:08:35] then we would rise up and say lord i'll
[1:08:37] give my life today
[1:08:39] because the word says that you will
[1:08:41] either give it now or you will give it
[1:08:43] later
[1:08:46] that is the problem with the watered
[1:08:48] down religion of our ages that they
[1:08:50] seem to have as it is the way they view
[1:08:53] debt i
[1:08:53] i can borrow i can spend i can do and
[1:08:56] there's no consequence i'm here to tell
[1:08:58] you there's consequence
[1:09:03] see they were followers of the prophet
[1:09:05] they weren't some splinter group they
[1:09:07] weren't
[1:09:08] somebody looking back they weren't
[1:09:09] quoting moses
[1:09:11] that's right she's looking to the
[1:09:14] prophet of her day
[1:09:17] now look i'm going to speak kind of
[1:09:18] blunt is that okay
[1:09:20] i'm telling you i'm just a few days
[1:09:22] older than i was when i preached to you
[1:09:24] last and the older i get the bolder i
[1:09:26] get
[1:09:26] and i hope you guys are good with that
[1:09:28] because i'm i'm looking
[1:09:30] in the mirror and it scares me
[1:09:34] where'd that wrinkle come from and where
[1:09:36] did that saggy spot come from
[1:09:39] if the lord tarries i've only got so
[1:09:41] much time
[1:09:43] to preach the truth to you
[1:09:48] i want to be a steward of that time
[1:09:55] you see in a time like this the easiest
[1:09:57] thing
[1:09:58] for her to do the easy way out
[1:10:06] would to have looked her sons in the
[1:10:08] face and say you know
[1:10:11] your father got us into that
[1:10:16] maybe the creditor will let me come and
[1:10:19] bring you a box of cookies
[1:10:21] every once in a while maybe i could come
[1:10:25] and
[1:10:26] hug your neck maybe i could come
[1:10:29] wash your clothes but i'm so sorry
[1:10:33] that you're in this situation see the
[1:10:36] easiest thing to do
[1:10:38] is to do nothing
[1:10:42] and when the holy spirit speaks to you
[1:10:45] you've got the same decision she had
[1:10:50] you can take the easy way out
[1:10:53] do nothing
[1:10:56] or you can go back to a prophet's words
[1:11:00] for your day
[1:11:01] amen and say there is an answer
[1:11:04] there is liberty i'm going to fight
[1:11:08] for the liberty come on saints
[1:11:12] i i'm sorry i would butter you up this
[1:11:14] morning but but i kind of run out of
[1:11:16] spiritual butter
[1:11:18] uh part way through my studies on this
[1:11:20] sermon and i can't butter you up i just
[1:11:22] i have to speak to you like it is
[1:11:25] so the easy way out is to do nothing see
[1:11:27] you can give up you say you don't know
[1:11:28] preacher
[1:11:29] my circumstance that's right i don't
[1:11:32] know your circumstance but god does
[1:11:34] and so you can give up to your
[1:11:36] circumstance and say well there's just
[1:11:38] no way out of this there's no
[1:11:40] way and you know what happens some blame
[1:11:42] it on god
[1:11:44] some come along and say the situation
[1:11:46] i'm in is god's fault and they
[1:11:48] won't serve god for that they'll blame
[1:11:50] it on something they'll blame it on
[1:11:52] someone
[1:11:53] else
[1:11:56] i had much more strident words in my
[1:11:59] notes
[1:12:01] and i felt like i should buttered up and
[1:12:03] this is what burnt up what butter i have
[1:12:05] for the whole service
[1:12:07] and i just started erasing the words
[1:12:10] that something stirred in my heart and
[1:12:11] said those are a little harsh
[1:12:13] i don't mean to be harsh i mean to be
[1:12:15] truthful and straightforward
[1:12:17] amen you understand the difference
[1:12:22] see we can blame it on god we can blame
[1:12:24] it on the message we can blame it on the
[1:12:26] church we can blame it on the preacher
[1:12:29] we can blame it on the circumstance or
[1:12:32] we can pick up our bible
[1:12:34] and under the anointing of the holy
[1:12:36] ghost
[1:12:37] we can fight for what is ours
[1:12:40] you realize this mother you didn't see
[1:12:43] her show up to the prophet
[1:12:44] carrying some big old shield she wasn't
[1:12:48] dragging some shield she didn't have
[1:12:49] some big old sword dragging in the dirt
[1:12:52] she didn't have shin guards and armed
[1:12:54] guards and everything
[1:12:55] and i'm gonna fight for my sons she knew
[1:12:58] how to fight saints
[1:12:59] god has opened the word to you and i we
[1:13:02] know how to fight in this
[1:13:04] day and the most powerful weapon we have
[1:13:09] is prayer
[1:13:12] god help us i think some of us probably
[1:13:14] need to learn how to fight
[1:13:16] amen amen whatever you do fight fair
[1:13:21] right even the scripture
[1:13:25] did not want the believer to curse satan
[1:13:32] is this not true
[1:13:35] now that's not the way of our warfare
[1:13:39] it's not the way of our nature the word
[1:13:41] of god
[1:13:42] is teaching us to be gentlemen and
[1:13:45] ladies
[1:13:46] sons and daughters of god
[1:13:49] amen
[1:13:52] so if we're gonna fight for one of ours
[1:13:54] what are we going to do
[1:13:56] we as sons and daughters of god are
[1:13:57] going back to the word
[1:13:59] that's our weapon of warfare my brother
[1:14:01] and sister is the word of the
[1:14:03] hour is the weapon that we have been
[1:14:06] given to
[1:14:07] fight in the day that we live in
[1:14:10] and elisha said unto her
[1:14:14] what shall i do for thee
[1:14:17] you know a lot of people are so quick to
[1:14:19] be offended
[1:14:21] that's right a lot of people are so
[1:14:23] quick to push back
[1:14:26] in the modern day that we live in this
[1:14:28] 21st century elisha would have said
[1:14:30] uh oh what can i do for thee fine i'll
[1:14:32] just do it myself
[1:14:36] oh i've seen those reactions the words
[1:14:38] hardly leave your mouth and they're
[1:14:40] already angry and they're already
[1:14:42] walking away
[1:14:44] but that's not the believer
[1:14:47] the believer says okay whatever is
[1:14:49] spoken now remember the prophet of god
[1:14:51] said you know if you don't have a church
[1:14:52] to go to you go where they preach where
[1:14:54] jesus is divine
[1:14:55] and you take what they say is truth so
[1:14:58] they read the word of god they read the
[1:14:59] bible you can say amen to that
[1:15:01] they say our lord jesus christ is king
[1:15:03] of king amen
[1:15:05] might not agree with some of the other
[1:15:07] but you see you don't go in there and
[1:15:09] you don't sit down and you don't start
[1:15:10] criticizing
[1:15:12] whether they did this and they did that
[1:15:14] and they don't believe this and they
[1:15:15] don't believe that
[1:15:16] oh this place is messed up no wrong
[1:15:18] attitude
[1:15:20] wrong spirit hmm amen
[1:15:24] i don't want to get sidetracked on that
[1:15:26] what shall i do for thee
[1:15:28] tell me what hast thou
[1:15:32] in the house you know what this was
[1:15:34] saints this is discernment
[1:15:36] god coming right down don't think this
[1:15:38] is just someone going okay now
[1:15:39] now let's see what are we gonna what am
[1:15:41] i gonna say to her oh
[1:15:42] what do you have in your house maybe you
[1:15:44] can pawn your furniture maybe you can
[1:15:46] pawn your jewels you can pawn your
[1:15:48] dishes you can pawn
[1:15:50] no sir this is discernment
[1:15:53] now do we serve a god that's an awesome
[1:15:54] god we serve a god that can deserve the
[1:15:57] very hearts of sons and daughters of god
[1:16:00] it's not just a world out here in the
[1:16:01] spirits of the world that he's
[1:16:03] discerning
[1:16:03] he's discerning our own hearts and the
[1:16:05] word we'll read in a little bit if we
[1:16:07] get to it
[1:16:08] he's reaching right down and we know our
[1:16:10] own hearts and we say oh
[1:16:12] the lord's looking at my heart but he
[1:16:14] knows you greater than you know your own
[1:16:17] heart
[1:16:18] he knows what is deep within your heart
[1:16:22] and he still said my grace is sufficient
[1:16:24] for thee
[1:16:26] tell me what house thou in the house
[1:16:29] discernment
[1:16:30] now let me just speak this morning i say
[1:16:32] this in love saints
[1:16:35] my house included were not exempt but
[1:16:38] what's in your house
[1:16:40] tells a lot about where you're at
[1:16:44] in life that's right
[1:16:49] come on
[1:16:54] if our house is filled full of frolic
[1:16:57] and frivolous our house is filled full
[1:17:00] of
[1:17:01] carnalities our house is filled
[1:17:04] with the superficial that's right it
[1:17:07] tells
[1:17:07] a lot on us no one's exempt
[1:17:13] all worthy things but let's just turn
[1:17:16] this this morning
[1:17:17] to the real house that's important on
[1:17:19] the earth today
[1:17:21] the real tabernacle of the holy ghost
[1:17:24] the real dwelling place what
[1:17:28] is in that house
[1:17:31] is there anger bitterness strife
[1:17:34] envy what is in the house saints
[1:17:39] i think it's time it breaks my heart
[1:17:42] i'll just be bold and say this it breaks
[1:17:43] my heart that not more of you show up
[1:17:45] for a communion
[1:17:48] because i'll tell you what communion
[1:17:49] does communion
[1:17:51] causes you to stop start going through
[1:17:54] the house
[1:17:57] it says and let a man examine
[1:18:00] himself so we start to go through the
[1:18:03] house and
[1:18:04] in the atmosphere of communion we start
[1:18:07] to say you know what lord that is not
[1:18:09] right it's
[1:18:09] maybe how i've been for years but it's
[1:18:12] still not right lord forgive me
[1:18:14] and god allows you to deal with that now
[1:18:16] i want to know how many penances and
[1:18:18] prayers and how many
[1:18:19] sacrifices you must offer to be forgiven
[1:18:27] that's right don't be thinking that soon
[1:18:30] as you get
[1:18:30] enough good things going for you that
[1:18:33] it'll be okay
[1:18:35] examine the house
[1:18:38] look through the house and what doesn't
[1:18:41] fit
[1:18:42] get rid of it and i can assure you
[1:18:45] that the scripture clearly declares all
[1:18:48] malice and all strife and all
[1:18:50] envyings get rid of them
[1:18:54] clean up the house clean up the house
[1:18:57] come on saints can i say it again
[1:18:58] clean up the house it'll make such a
[1:19:02] difference you say well brother paul i
[1:19:03] don't know where to start then just
[1:19:04] start somewhere
[1:19:08] i think it was brother jason shared with
[1:19:10] me a book that him and sister emmy read
[1:19:12] and you know in that this is just one of
[1:19:14] the things i remember
[1:19:16] if you're unable to go conquer the big
[1:19:18] things of your house
[1:19:19] just start with one drawer
[1:19:23] and everything that has no value in that
[1:19:25] one drawer
[1:19:27] get rid of it did you know saints that
[1:19:31] while you're still working on your house
[1:19:33] you can take communion sure
[1:19:38] am i trying to sell you on it no i'm
[1:19:40] trying to tell you the prophet of god
[1:19:42] said this was the word of god
[1:19:43] one of the ordinances of our day let's
[1:19:46] not get in a mental conception that we
[1:19:48] can just skip these things
[1:19:50] and everything will be all right that's
[1:19:52] right
[1:19:53] i don't know where that came from
[1:20:00] not handmade hath not anything in the
[1:20:02] house
[1:20:03] save upon oil see she had nothing of
[1:20:06] earthly value
[1:20:07] that she could that she could come and
[1:20:09] say you know what i i guess i'll go
[1:20:11] sell this but this little pot of oil i'm
[1:20:13] telling you my brother and sister oil
[1:20:15] has always had value
[1:20:16] so if she had a great big great big
[1:20:19] jug there she could have taken a portion
[1:20:22] of that and sold and applied it to the
[1:20:24] debt
[1:20:24] but i'm telling you in my heart maybe
[1:20:26] it's just my imagination
[1:20:28] but when she says that she just had this
[1:20:31] little vessel this little pot of oil
[1:20:33] my brother and sister i'm not imagining
[1:20:35] that is some great big pot
[1:20:37] and part of the reason is is here's this
[1:20:39] little sister now
[1:20:40] i party me sister nadia but if i come
[1:20:43] along here with a 55 gallon drum of oil
[1:20:46] and i tell sister nadia go ahead and
[1:20:48] pour this out into some other vessels
[1:20:50] my brother and sister she's not even
[1:20:52] going to be able to tip it and get it
[1:20:54] off the floor
[1:20:55] this is something that our dear little
[1:20:57] sister was able to pick up
[1:20:59] and the reason i want to make emphasis
[1:21:01] of that is we oftentimes say well
[1:21:03] you know i would get over this if god
[1:21:05] would just come down in a supernatural
[1:21:07] way
[1:21:08] and sweep through my house and just
[1:21:10] anoint me with the power
[1:21:11] and i could just go and i could be
[1:21:13] delivered of this
[1:21:15] no sir a little pot
[1:21:19] that a little sister could take
[1:21:22] and not once enough strength
[1:21:25] to stagger hold it up and pour it out
[1:21:28] but something small enough
[1:21:33] she could pour out again
[1:21:37] and again and again
[1:21:41] because in our human element we think i
[1:21:43] need this vast quantity i need a vast
[1:21:45] quantity
[1:21:45] what we need is god on the other side
[1:21:48] of the vessel we need god on the other
[1:21:52] side of the vessel
[1:21:53] and as we pour out he pours in and you
[1:21:55] can't outpour god
[1:21:58] you cannot outgive god you cannot out
[1:22:00] love god you cannot out
[1:22:02] oh my goodness hallelujah there's just
[1:22:04] nothing you'll ever do that will outdo
[1:22:06] god
[1:22:07] hallelujah including you can't even sin
[1:22:10] enough to get beyond the grace of god
[1:22:12] hallelujah now look at this my brother
[1:22:15] and sister
[1:22:16] so it's there that she recognizes she
[1:22:18] has nothing of earthly value but this
[1:22:20] little pop
[1:22:21] of oil oh and i'll tell you i don't need
[1:22:23] to talk to great theologians to get this
[1:22:26] thought expressed to you
[1:22:27] the oil has always represented the holy
[1:22:30] ghost
[1:22:30] and so in her house she had just this
[1:22:33] little vessel
[1:22:34] of the holy ghost in earthen vessels
[1:22:38] amen so she's acknowledging we have
[1:22:40] faith
[1:22:41] in the word of god for our hour we have
[1:22:44] faith in the things that god has done
[1:22:45] for us
[1:22:46] and what he said he will do we have
[1:22:48] faith in his messenger to the day
[1:22:51] and that's why we have come to elisha
[1:22:53] because we believe he's a man of god
[1:22:56] we believe this is the word of god for
[1:22:58] our day and we have confidence in that
[1:23:00] amen hallelujah and so there it is he
[1:23:04] tells her what i want you to do
[1:23:06] go and borrow vessels now i hope you can
[1:23:09] follow the spiritual type here my
[1:23:11] brother and sister
[1:23:12] i want you to go borrow vessels it's not
[1:23:14] about how many
[1:23:15] but you see god was going to come and
[1:23:17] prove you know the whole spirit of this
[1:23:19] abundance
[1:23:20] gospel you know this prosperity gospel
[1:23:22] you know it has roots right in the bible
[1:23:24] where everybody's like god wants to
[1:23:26] bless you beyond measure
[1:23:27] god wants to just give you more than you
[1:23:30] could ever contain
[1:23:31] that's right he want to fill you with
[1:23:32] the holy ghost so full that you can't
[1:23:35] contain it he never said nothing about
[1:23:37] mansions and mercedes and swimming pools
[1:23:39] and jet planes
[1:23:41] he's talking about filling you up with
[1:23:43] the holy ghost
[1:23:44] you got a choice between more of the
[1:23:46] holy ghost and more of the things of
[1:23:48] this world
[1:23:48] i pray god would just anoint you to say
[1:23:51] i want the holy ghost
[1:23:53] more than i want anything this world has
[1:23:56] to offer
[1:23:58] but i'm telling you what you see it time
[1:24:00] after time affluence comes
[1:24:02] and the barriers start to come down and
[1:24:04] that's why the scripture says that very
[1:24:06] few rich men
[1:24:08] that's right we'll make it amen because
[1:24:10] very few are able to
[1:24:12] withstand the onslaught
[1:24:15] of the spirit of the almighty dollar
[1:24:20] but lord if i just had a little more
[1:24:21] money we just had a little nicer car
[1:24:24] like maybe the nicest one in the church
[1:24:27] and lord if we just had a little bigger
[1:24:29] house like the biggest one in the church
[1:24:31] lord we would entertain
[1:24:34] we would do this we would do that
[1:24:38] would we
[1:24:41] i can assure you from personal
[1:24:42] experience the more you have the more it
[1:24:44] takes
[1:24:45] to take care of it it's almost like a
[1:24:48] curse you know that
[1:24:50] sister jerry i'll just i just feel
[1:24:53] transparent this morning
[1:24:55] hopefully you can look right through me
[1:24:57] and see the cross here this morning
[1:25:01] you see being motivated or driven as the
[1:25:04] world would use that term
[1:25:06] can be just as much of a curse as it is
[1:25:10] a blessing all right
[1:25:14] think about it
[1:25:18] now look are we okay
[1:25:21] okay you see
[1:25:27] she trusted she went and borrowed all
[1:25:30] these vessels
[1:25:31] see it doesn't say in there that she
[1:25:34] actually did this
[1:25:35] but we recognize she's a true believer
[1:25:37] so the question marks not whether she
[1:25:39] was going to do it or not she's a
[1:25:40] believer
[1:25:41] believer follows the word so it's just
[1:25:44] automatic they don't have to put in
[1:25:45] there and she went from this house to
[1:25:47] this house to this house
[1:25:48] she went to 124 gram street 126 elm
[1:25:51] street and 128 elm street
[1:25:53] and then all the odd numbers don't have
[1:25:56] to say that
[1:25:58] the prophet said it are you with me
[1:26:02] prophet said it yeah she had confidence
[1:26:04] in the words of the prophet
[1:26:06] she went and did it
[1:26:09] no need to document every last little
[1:26:11] thing about she did this and she did
[1:26:12] that
[1:26:13] they did this they did that right amen
[1:26:16] oh i tell you what this is where it gets
[1:26:18] really good
[1:26:20] and when thou art come in i shall shut
[1:26:21] the door upon being upon thy sons
[1:26:24] and shall pour out into all those
[1:26:26] vessels
[1:26:27] and thou shall set aside that which is
[1:26:30] half full
[1:26:32] that which has been anointed
[1:26:36] not which has seen the oil
[1:26:41] no sir set aside that which is
[1:26:46] full
[1:26:49] how many vessels do you fill up a
[1:26:51] thousand how many did you fill up
[1:26:53] 200 how full was yours i just poured a
[1:26:56] drop in each one
[1:26:58] it didn't fulfill the word look the
[1:27:01] prophet's words were
[1:27:02] you pour that vessel
[1:27:06] full preachers are we listening
[1:27:11] we're not here to just get as many half
[1:27:13] full vessels as we can
[1:27:14] packed in the walls of this church what
[1:27:17] we're looking for is to fulfill the word
[1:27:18] of god
[1:27:19] and to every vessel be filled
[1:27:23] completely and set aside you wonder my
[1:27:26] brother and sister i try really hard
[1:27:27] in fact maybe i try too hard to not
[1:27:30] stick my nose into your lives not to
[1:27:32] just do
[1:27:33] sometimes i bite my tongue and i just
[1:27:35] pray that god would change circumstances
[1:27:37] because my brother and sister it is a
[1:27:39] human element to want to go fix things
[1:27:41] not everybody's that way
[1:27:43] but i am a fixer i am one that in the
[1:27:46] the human element i would like to just
[1:27:48] come and i would like to just
[1:27:50] fix it for you but my brother and sister
[1:27:52] it isn't how it works
[1:27:54] you have got to be the vessel you have
[1:27:56] got to be the one
[1:27:58] that's clean on the outside clean on the
[1:28:00] inside
[1:28:01] you've got to be the one that says nope
[1:28:03] i'm not full yet

[1:28:20] little bit i can tell you the season
[1:28:22] will come
[1:28:23] will you be right back where you started
[1:28:25] with not enough oil
[1:28:26] right now for sake of time this morning
[1:28:30] i kind of admitted it but i will
[1:28:32] verbally just lay this out when
[1:28:36] the wise and foolish virgin were there
[1:28:39] and the call came out behold the
[1:28:42] bridegroom
[1:28:42] cometh what was the only
[1:28:46] ingredient does a scripture
[1:28:49] use to define those who stayed and those
[1:28:53] who went
[1:28:57] oil that's right didn't talk about their
[1:29:00] house
[1:29:01] didn't talk about their bank account
[1:29:03] didn't talk about their intelligence
[1:29:05] level
[1:29:05] didn't talk about their clothes or their
[1:29:10] only the oil that's right
[1:29:14] god fill us all i can say this morning i
[1:29:17] set my office and i wept god fill us
[1:29:19] don't let us walk out lord with just a
[1:29:21] little bit lord

[1:29:26] we
[1:29:26] are full

[1:29:35] in the world and the door is closed and
[1:29:38] what happens then they had a revival
[1:29:40] amen they had a little revival in that
[1:29:42] house
[1:29:43] and as they were having a revival they
[1:29:46] saw the word of god coming to pass
[1:29:50] in their house they weren't having to
[1:29:52] sit over here and say well
[1:29:53] i can look over here at this family
[1:29:55] god's really answering their prayers
[1:29:57] i can look at this family god's really
[1:29:59] answering prayer i can look at this
[1:30:00] preacher over here god's really
[1:30:02] answering prayer
[1:30:03] i'll tell you why you feel like god's
[1:30:05] not answering your prayer
[1:30:06] you haven't shut the door to the world
[1:30:08] and you haven't poured out
[1:30:10] and you haven't filled up and you have
[1:30:12] just settled for
[1:30:14] whatever will be will be the future's
[1:30:17] not
[1:30:18] ours to see
[1:30:21] yeah i'll tell you what my future is
[1:30:24] clear before me
[1:30:26] can someone say amen this morning my
[1:30:28] future is clear before me
[1:30:30] the word of god said i am victorious
[1:30:33] in every trial i'm an overcomer no
[1:30:36] matter my circumstance
[1:30:38] oh no matter what satan would do i can
[1:30:41] stand up and say
[1:30:43] i am chosen i am a chosen
[1:30:46] generation i am a royal priesthood
[1:30:49] i'm not some common person on the face
[1:30:51] of the earth
[1:30:52] god chose me before the foundation and
[1:30:55] placed me not in
[1:30:56] any age but this age why
[1:30:59] because in gross darkness the light has
[1:31:02] to shine
[1:31:03] and you ought to say thank you lord for
[1:31:06] letting me be the light
[1:31:07] of laodicea let me be father
[1:31:10] the light of laodicea
[1:31:15] it's not a curse that you're in this day
[1:31:17] is a blessing
[1:31:19] it's an anointing from almighty god
[1:31:22] showing his
[1:31:22] favor to you his confidence
[1:31:26] to you he trusted you empowered he
[1:31:30] called you to fulfill this
[1:31:42] scripture says this comes to my mind the
[1:31:44] scripture says
[1:31:45] you did run well
[1:31:49] who not what
[1:31:53] who did hinder you
[1:31:56] amen
[1:32:00] problem is saints can i just speak a
[1:32:02] little blunt
[1:32:04] i've been speaking politely in case you
[1:32:05] didn't know
[1:32:08] you know reminds me one time is there at
[1:32:11] the farm shop
[1:32:13] salesman pulls up gets out comes in the
[1:32:16] shop
[1:32:18] i wouldn't say he was necessarily a
[1:32:19] younger man but
[1:32:21] maybe in his mid-thirties starts off to
[1:32:25] tell me how long
[1:32:26] been with this company how long he's
[1:32:28] been selling this project
[1:32:30] this product i mean how successful he's
[1:32:33] been
[1:32:34] and then he takes a step forward and he
[1:32:37] says i'm not leaving here today
[1:32:38] until i sell you something and i was
[1:32:42] like well i guess we could invite you to
[1:32:44] supper and
[1:32:44] maybe we could get you a blanket on the
[1:32:46] porch
[1:32:52] but you know the problem is
[1:32:57] many of you think that many of us
[1:33:01] are here to sell you something
[1:33:08] just a few days ago not making light of
[1:33:10] people's
[1:33:12] bodies but this car pulls up in front of
[1:33:14] the shop
[1:33:16] this little man gets out
[1:33:19] and i'm sorry lord forgive me for
[1:33:22] thoughts like this
[1:33:24] but i thought my goodness that man's as
[1:33:27] white as he is tall
[1:33:30] and he come into the shop with a
[1:33:31] brochure some paperwork
[1:33:34] he walks right in hi
[1:33:37] my name's roy and i represent this
[1:33:40] company
[1:33:42] and if there is anything i can do for
[1:33:45] you
[1:33:46] i will do it
[1:33:50] broiler see what you got my
[1:33:53] a man who would come with that attitude
[1:33:58] i might not be able to sell you
[1:33:59] something but i might
[1:34:01] be able to help you i wanted to ask him
[1:34:04] if he was a preacher but after a few
[1:34:06] minutes it was obvious he wasn't
[1:34:12] i felt sorry for the man my heart breaks
[1:34:14] don't don't think i'm making light of
[1:34:16] him
[1:34:16] but the obvious thing was he was telling
[1:34:19] me how his wife had got sick
[1:34:21] she passed away he was heartbroken it
[1:34:23] was four years ago
[1:34:26] my first girlfriend was like this and my
[1:34:28] second girlfriend was like this and my
[1:34:30] third one was like this
[1:34:31] the lady i'm living with now is like
[1:34:32] this he's not a preacher
[1:34:37] but you see my brother and sister it's
[1:34:38] all about the attitude
[1:34:40] the first man now let me balance this
[1:34:42] for you the first man
[1:34:44] i didn't have the right attitude towards
[1:34:47] him
[1:34:48] but neither did he have the right
[1:34:50] attitude towards me
[1:34:53] he saw me as a way to make money
[1:34:57] and the minute he said those words i saw
[1:34:59] him as an adversary
[1:35:01] now let me bring that to church can we
[1:35:04] bring him to church
[1:35:05] yes many times the preacher
[1:35:08] says something maybe he says it too
[1:35:11] strident
[1:35:12] maybe he says it too blunt or it seems
[1:35:14] like without love
[1:35:16] and instead of saying what he's saying
[1:35:18] is true
[1:35:20] we you're not selling me anything
[1:35:28] we walk out of church with nothing
[1:35:32] and he walks out of church wondering why
[1:35:34] nobody cared
[1:35:36] but the truth is is there got to be a
[1:35:38] melding together
[1:35:40] the truth the scripture says in love
[1:35:45] and sons and daughters of god want truth
[1:35:49] so when you have the truth in love and
[1:35:51] truth is presented
[1:35:53] we both walk out blessed
[1:35:56] see there's there's the structure that
[1:35:58] god wants
[1:35:59] you see because if you think that the
[1:36:01] ministry is
[1:36:02] against you then we
[1:36:07] are in a self-destructive cycle
[1:36:12] the preacher walks away and says why do
[1:36:14] i do this i don't care you walk away
[1:36:16] going why is he trying to tell me
[1:36:18] to clean my house he don't know what my
[1:36:21] house is like
[1:36:24] he doesn't know nothing about my house
[1:36:27] well then haylets i'm sorry to tell you
[1:36:28] a little transparent sister jerry had a
[1:36:30] little company yesterday and i'm like uh
[1:36:32] you didn't show them the house did you
[1:36:34] yes i did i'm like oh mercy
[1:36:40] that's my dirty socks on the floor
[1:36:43] that's my sweatpants and my t-shirt
[1:36:45] tossed in the corner
[1:36:47] that's pants i wore about a week ago
[1:36:48] still laying there
[1:36:50] on the floor because i told jerry
[1:36:55] i'll take care of them
[1:37:04] so what happens when she hears a
[1:37:07] prophet's words
[1:37:10] she proceeds to get the vessels
[1:37:14] she doesn't have to stop and figure out
[1:37:15] how far this oil will go she has no clue
[1:37:18] i'm going to take a position that she
[1:37:20] was just as smart or smarter than any of
[1:37:22] us
[1:37:22] she didn't stop there and say now i've
[1:37:24] got a reason this i don't know why he
[1:37:26] wants me to get all these vessels
[1:37:27] because there's only maybe a half a
[1:37:29] gallon of oil here
[1:37:31] and so what's this going to do what did
[1:37:32] she do she simply took the word of the
[1:37:35] prophet
[1:37:36] god's word spoken to her she didn't have
[1:37:39] to figure out a formula
[1:37:41] and figure out how this by this and done
[1:37:43] by this and this way in that way
[1:37:45] can produce this she just said he said
[1:37:48] it amen
[1:37:49] he said it i believe it was thus saith
[1:37:51] the lord he said it
[1:37:52] and so i am going to just go and she
[1:37:55] fills the house
[1:37:56] imagine i can see the whole house every
[1:37:59] room everything just filled full of a
[1:38:01] vessel
[1:38:02] stocked up and then they closed the door
[1:38:04] and they had a revival in the house i
[1:38:06] think more of us need a revival in our
[1:38:08] house
[1:38:09] we can start pouring out some oil if we
[1:38:11] close the doors
[1:38:12] and have the revival amen and so starts
[1:38:15] pouring that oil
[1:38:16] out and as she's doing that oh get this
[1:38:18] saints
[1:38:19] she drew by the word of the prophet she
[1:38:23] drew
[1:38:24] her children into the experience
[1:38:29] it wasn't mama it wasn't
[1:38:32] mama's experience a problem some of us
[1:38:35] got it's a daddy experience it's a mama
[1:38:37] experience good or bad
[1:38:41] oh it's about this and it's about that
[1:38:43] no no she
[1:38:45] had revelation she drew her children
[1:38:48] into the experience and her children
[1:38:51] were there they weren't off in the room
[1:38:54] sorry i hope don't meet i don't mean to
[1:38:55] insult any of you
[1:38:56] they weren't off in the room on their
[1:38:58] ipad they weren't in there
[1:38:59] on their smartphone they weren't in
[1:39:01] there on their cable tv
[1:39:04] they weren't in there in their sports
[1:39:06] magazines
[1:39:07] they were in there watching their mama
[1:39:10] pour the oil out again
[1:39:13] and again and again and again
[1:39:18] and mama poured the oil out on sunday
[1:39:20] and mama poured the oil out on monday
[1:39:23] and mama poured the oil out on tuesday
[1:39:25] and mama poured the oil out on wednesday
[1:39:28] and mama poured it out on thursday and
[1:39:30] on friday
[1:39:31] and watched their house transformed
[1:39:35] and it wasn't just that mama could pay a
[1:39:38] bill
[1:39:39] but that act of a prophet and that act
[1:39:42] of a god-fearing believing mother
[1:39:44] give those children deliverance from the
[1:39:48] bond men
[1:39:49] it was what delivered their children
[1:39:51] from rock and roll
[1:39:52] is what delivered them from meth and
[1:39:55] from the music
[1:39:56] and from the clothing and the spirit of
[1:39:59] the age
[1:39:59] it was that continual poor real simple
[1:40:02] thought
[1:40:03] she could have been there reasoning this
[1:40:05] out each vessel
[1:40:09] we owe 100 remember this a long time ago
[1:40:12] 100 at five dollars a vessel we got to
[1:40:16] fill up 20 of them
[1:40:19] one two three four five 18 19
[1:40:23] 20.
[1:40:27] praise the lord we're done
[1:40:30] what'd you do she listened
[1:40:33] to the intricate detail
[1:40:38] of the prophets when he said as many
[1:40:41] vessels as you can
[1:40:43] get and you keep pouring until they're
[1:40:46] all full
[1:40:54] when the deepest regret i have
[1:41:01] as a young man there wasn't much oil
[1:41:05] poured by my children my children's
[1:41:08] father i mean to say
[1:41:11] their mother was pouring oil
[1:41:15] their mother stood and looked me in the
[1:41:18] face and said paul whatever you choose
[1:41:19] to do
[1:41:21] i'm going to church anyhow
[1:41:26] come on saints i'm not just talking to
[1:41:29] you out of thin air here
[1:41:31] i'm telling you there comes a time there
[1:41:33] comes a place
[1:41:34] that you got to put your complex to the
[1:41:36] side you got to put your feelings to the
[1:41:38] side
[1:41:38] you got to put the circumstances of your
[1:41:40] life well if you knew how i was raised
[1:41:42] in the circumstances
[1:41:43] no put it aside put it aside she didn't
[1:41:46] offer excuses to the prophet
[1:41:48] she went and did what he told her to do
[1:41:59] what was it a mother called action
[1:42:02] amen and she obeyed the call amen right
[1:42:06] look how simple this is well you know
[1:42:07] brother paul no no
[1:42:09] mamas future mamas sisters young and old
[1:42:15] just respond
[1:42:18] with action amen not with excuses
[1:42:22] not with reasons not with circumstances
[1:42:26] action start borrowing the vessels
[1:42:30] and start pouring it out now you tell me
[1:42:34] coming right back to the little sister
[1:42:38] fed a prophet he says i don't care that
[1:42:41] you only got enough food for one meal
[1:42:44] you fix it for me first
[1:42:47] you know what the type is i remember
[1:42:49] reading this deal online where some guy
[1:42:51] with a theological
[1:42:53] whatever and phd this and phlll and
[1:42:56] whatever
[1:42:56] and the guy's like it wasn't reasonable
[1:43:00] for elijah to ask her that
[1:43:04] okay so it's not reasonable
[1:43:08] it's not reasonable but they missed the
[1:43:11] revelation
[1:43:12] that it wasn't elijah standing there
[1:43:15] it was god in elijah's flesh and
[1:43:19] god was speaking to that widow woman
[1:43:22] saying
[1:43:22] put me first
[1:43:25] you put me first and i will take care of
[1:43:28] you
[1:43:30] but you see looking at from the carnal
[1:43:32] side it just isn't reasonable that man
[1:43:33] was i forget had some term
[1:43:36] you know
[1:43:41] when preachers start promoting feminism
[1:43:46] yeah he should have cared about her he
[1:43:48] should have understand her needs he did
[1:43:52] he did put god first and god will take
[1:43:56] care of you
[1:43:57] there's your need there's the revelation
[1:44:00] that you need
[1:44:01] put god first
[1:44:04] clean out the house
[1:44:06] [Music]
[1:44:07] oh hallelujah that's right now look here
[1:44:09] what the prophet's
[1:44:10] words are i got to get going along my
[1:44:12] where's the time go
[1:44:16] she had this revival in her house and it
[1:44:18] comes to pass when the vessels were full
[1:44:21] you know what it was she didn't stop
[1:44:23] saints i want to just drive this home to
[1:44:24] you
[1:44:25] we get these cars we get these things
[1:44:29] well i i've heard message believers
[1:44:32] saying
[1:44:33] well you know my my children they're
[1:44:35] going haywire
[1:44:36] but what do i expect i went haywire when
[1:44:40] i was their age
[1:44:43] yeah i understand i understand
[1:44:47] i understand you left the door open
[1:44:50] you only borrowed a few vessels
[1:44:55] and before the spirit was finished being
[1:44:57] poured out
[1:44:58] you had had enough and you put it down
[1:45:05] and you wonder why your children are
[1:45:08] mimicking
[1:45:09] your behavior instead of a godly
[1:45:13] behavior
[1:45:14] because you didn't listen to the prophet
[1:45:17] you didn't get all the vessels you could
[1:45:19] and you didn't keep pouring
[1:45:22] when you had opportunity yeah i
[1:45:26] understand
[1:45:28] but you know what scares me the most
[1:45:29] about that saying sorry if i'm being
[1:45:30] blunt i'm stepping on somebody's
[1:45:32] toes i don't mean to god laid this on my
[1:45:34] heart
[1:45:35] it's been on there for long enough to
[1:45:37] become a burden
[1:45:39] you know what the problem is what we
[1:45:41] think is love to our children
[1:45:44] is selfishness to ourselves amen
[1:45:49] oh yeah glad i don't have my wallet
[1:45:50] because the only thing i have my wallet
[1:45:52] is 100
[1:45:52] bill i don't want to give that away
[1:45:56] but you know our solution is sister
[1:45:58] gabriella will you be my example
[1:46:01] i hope she just cringed she's my adopted
[1:46:04] granddaughter so i can kind of mistreat
[1:46:06] her and it'll be all right
[1:46:08] but i'm not you know what the problem is
[1:46:11] we see a little something
[1:46:14] oh sweetheart here daddy loves you
[1:46:18] grandpa loves you
[1:46:21] we walk away going oh i did something
[1:46:23] for my daughter i did something for my
[1:46:25] granddaughter
[1:46:26] it was selfish you weren't willing
[1:46:31] to get the vessels you weren't willing
[1:46:35] to close the door and you weren't
[1:46:38] willing
[1:46:38] to pour out whether you felt like it
[1:46:42] or not you have actually
[1:46:45] just given a carnal solution
[1:46:49] to a spiritual problem that's right tell
[1:46:54] me that's not selfish
[1:46:55] on the part of the giver
[1:46:59] 100 bill will just buy your love
[1:47:02] my daughter my granddaughter loves me
[1:47:07] she will until some punk out here
[1:47:11] starts buttering her up with the caramel
[1:47:13] butter
[1:47:14] and tells her oh your parents they don't
[1:47:17] really love you
[1:47:18] they don't really love you look if they
[1:47:19] loved you they let you do anything you
[1:47:21] wanted
[1:47:22] climb out your bedroom window and go
[1:47:24] with me
[1:47:25] and i'll sell you to some guy in new
[1:47:27] jersey and they'll never see you again
[1:47:31] see how the devil plays the game
[1:47:34] and the parents are like oh we love our
[1:47:36] daughters so much we love our
[1:47:37] granddaughters so much
[1:47:38] oh why why why no you didn't love her no
[1:47:41] you didn't love her
[1:47:43] because if you loved her you would have
[1:47:45] closed the door to the world
[1:47:47] and you'd have started pouring out the
[1:47:49] oil
[1:47:50] and you'd have kept pouring the oil
[1:47:52] until you could have looked over there
[1:47:54] one day and say my dear little daughter
[1:47:56] granddaughter is
[1:47:57] clear full of the spirit of god she's
[1:48:00] got the holy ghost she's been delivered
[1:48:02] she's been sealed to the day of her
[1:48:03] redemption that's love my brother and
[1:48:05] sister
[1:48:06] but it takes effort on the side of daddy
[1:48:08] and mama
[1:48:09] to express that kind of love amen
[1:48:13] and it takes effort on the side of a
[1:48:15] ministry ministries in a church in a
[1:48:17] body of believers
[1:48:18] to pour out that kind of love
[1:48:22] it takes prayers in the middle of the
[1:48:23] night it pray it takes praying
[1:48:26] god what do they need to hear it takes
[1:48:28] time it takes effort
[1:48:30] not selfish
[1:48:34] come on so what happens here
[1:48:39] finally reaches the point there's
[1:48:40] nothing left to be filled there's just
[1:48:42] nowhere to go
[1:48:44] then she came and told the man of god
[1:48:47] and he said go sell the oil
[1:48:48] now i want you to understand my brother
[1:48:50] and sister i preached it in this church
[1:48:51] many times i'll preach it to you again
[1:48:53] holy ghost to a christian is like
[1:48:55] gasoline to a car
[1:48:57] you walk out of here today some of you
[1:48:59] will go home
[1:49:00] and the devil will be waiting on your
[1:49:02] doorstep in fact you know you pick the
[1:49:04] lock to your house
[1:49:06] he might be sitting on your couch right
[1:49:08] now waiting for you
[1:49:10] because he's going to prove to you you
[1:49:12] ain't got any oil on your vessel
[1:49:17] but it takes oil
[1:49:21] just to live in this day
[1:49:24] praise the lord we've filled everything
[1:49:26] up no see the type right here in
[1:49:28] scripture
[1:49:29] go sell the oil holy ghost which
[1:49:32] is god himself paid the debt
[1:49:36] you see what it is right here god
[1:49:37] himself poured himself
[1:49:39] out and paid our debt
[1:49:43] all he wants us to do is be a part of
[1:49:46] the
[1:49:46] active plan of god he wants you
[1:49:49] to put the effort to pick that up as it
[1:49:52] were
[1:49:53] and take it out and maybe take it to an
[1:49:55] altar and say you know what i've been
[1:49:56] bitter about this person
[1:49:58] i i've had this or i've had that i've
[1:50:00] had an anxiety i've had a fear
[1:50:01] i've had what you just name it and
[1:50:03] you've got to take that oil
[1:50:05] and you've got to go quench that debt
[1:50:08] well isn't god going to do it for us no
[1:50:11] sir
[1:50:13] she had to pour the oil out she was
[1:50:16] entirely
[1:50:17] there was no knock
[1:50:21] yes elisha sent me to pour the oil out
[1:50:25] for you
[1:50:27] no no you've got to close the door
[1:50:33] you've got to have the vessel you've
[1:50:36] got to pour the oil amen that seems like
[1:50:40] that'd be enough but no
[1:50:41] see what god's got to do is get you to
[1:50:44] get down to the reality of this and now
[1:50:46] you have to take the holy ghost
[1:50:49] and you have to examine yourself amen
[1:50:52] and that will cause you
[1:50:53] to start pouring some oil out here
[1:50:57] and here you know i said this i thought
[1:51:00] this i felt this
[1:51:02] forgive me whoa whoa that's too big a
[1:51:05] price i'm too proud to do that
[1:51:06] okay okay no problem
[1:51:11] i can show you where the prophet of god
[1:51:13] says when the holy ghost comes upon a
[1:51:15] man
[1:51:16] it humbles him
[1:51:20] not a proud bone left in his body that's
[1:51:23] right
[1:51:24] or you can stand up and say i've been
[1:51:26] wrong
[1:51:27] forgive me amen i just can't do that
[1:51:32] you're not ready that's right you're not
[1:51:34] ready probably your back door is open
[1:51:37] go check and see you probably left the
[1:51:39] garage door open
[1:51:40] there's got to be a door open somewhere
[1:51:42] because when the door is closed and
[1:51:44] god's on the inside
[1:51:45] amen things change amen amen amen
[1:51:49] that's right man this is a terrible
[1:51:52] mother's day
[1:51:53] sermon isn't this
[1:51:56] i'll tell you what reminds me that
[1:51:58] little story we're sitting there on the
[1:52:00] bed this morning on the side of the bed
[1:52:02] and we're talking about this reminds me
[1:52:03] a little story about that girl coming
[1:52:05] home from college
[1:52:06] with her friend she's ashamed of her
[1:52:07] mother what was it like the conductor or
[1:52:10] somebody there you know
[1:52:11] it's like how dare you treat your mother
[1:52:13] like that when the house was on fire and
[1:52:15] you were a little baby in that room
[1:52:17] she ran in there not to save herself
[1:52:21] oh come on moments are you with me this
[1:52:23] morning didn't even put that effort out
[1:52:25] to save yourself
[1:52:26] but you put that effort out to save your
[1:52:29] baby
[1:52:30] hallelujah you're pouring the oil out
[1:52:33] god's been good to us as adults we're
[1:52:36] sitting here god's been good to us
[1:52:38] are we too lazy too selfish to pour the
[1:52:41] oil out
[1:52:42] for our children that's it oh
[1:52:46] hallelujah some of you look pretty
[1:52:47] somber this morning
[1:52:49] are you frowning you're sad or are you
[1:52:51] thinking somebody please send me a memo
[1:52:57] but the truth is we've got to break our
[1:53:00] selfish spirit
[1:53:01] amen and realize if we as a church
[1:53:05] are not willing to pour the oil out
[1:53:09] for our children
[1:53:13] god will find someone who will
[1:53:18] i'd like to know that i had an impact on
[1:53:21] my children's life
[1:53:23] i know i did when i was backslidden it
[1:53:24] was i had a giant you know slash line
[1:53:27] negative now by god's grace maybe
[1:53:31] i can have an impact with the plus sign
[1:53:34] amen
[1:53:36] not all negative okay let's move on to
[1:53:38] the second half of the sermon here
[1:53:41] i say that jokingly but it's kind of
[1:53:43] true
[1:53:44] you know what god help us apply a
[1:53:46] liberal you know did you guys know i i
[1:53:48] might ought to tell you
[1:53:49] you thought i was conservative this
[1:53:51] whole time but i'm actually liberal
[1:53:54] i want the liberal presence of god
[1:53:56] nothing not the stinging
[1:53:58] not the conservative side i want a
[1:54:00] liberal dose of the holy ghost
[1:54:02] i want a liberal power of god moving in
[1:54:05] our midst amen not conservative
[1:54:07] we're all so conservative in our
[1:54:09] politics we bring it to church and it's
[1:54:10] like no no no we can't do that
[1:54:13] that would seem liberal if i was to
[1:54:15] stand up and shout hallelujah if i was
[1:54:18] to hauler if i was to
[1:54:20] oh my i just remember i just remember a
[1:54:22] service we had i don't remember who was
[1:54:24] preaching
[1:54:24] might have been brother dwayne lawson
[1:54:26] might have been brother andrew
[1:54:28] my brother david i'm not here to
[1:54:29] embarrass him but i'm just going to tell
[1:54:30] you my brother david got so
[1:54:32] anointing he's here in the aisle and
[1:54:34] he's just standing here and he's just
[1:54:36] doing
[1:54:36] and i'm sitting here looking in most of
[1:54:38] his eyeballs it's about this big
[1:54:40] and you're just like oh my goodness what
[1:54:42] is god holds a brother david
[1:54:44] what's he doing come on
[1:54:49] i want a liberal dose that's right
[1:54:51] because i tell you don't take very much
[1:54:53] anointing to get an amen out of you
[1:54:54] that's right but i tell you what to get
[1:54:56] a game changer out of you it
[1:54:57] can take quite a bit hallelujah
[1:55:01] well look i see it saints look i say
[1:55:03] this in humor i see this
[1:55:05] oh let's stand and praise the lord and
[1:55:06] it's like
[1:55:08] oh he asked us to stand up
[1:55:12] come on come on somebody smile
[1:55:17] now look at this what is going to
[1:55:18] activate this first john 3 21.
[1:55:21] i'm telling you this is drug out so far
[1:55:23] i am sorry
[1:55:25] beloved if our heart condemn us not then
[1:55:28] we have confidence towards god
[1:55:30] you see you don't see one sign in this
[1:55:33] scripture of dealing there that she was
[1:55:36] hesitant to follow
[1:55:37] a prophet's words her heart had no
[1:55:40] condemnation
[1:55:41] she had confidence to god and she knew
[1:55:44] that what she was doing was for the
[1:55:46] benefit of her children
[1:55:48] and my brother and sister our children
[1:55:50] will see us fuss
[1:55:51] they will see us fight they will see the
[1:55:53] dark side of
[1:55:54] our marriage they will see every
[1:55:56] circumstance that we would like to hide
[1:55:58] from them
[1:55:59] but shame on you for hiding what is
[1:56:01] happening in your world
[1:56:03] shame on you for putting up a false
[1:56:05] front of what is going on
[1:56:07] we are and i don't say this to offend no
[1:56:09] one and like i've
[1:56:10] said before the service this has been on
[1:56:12] my heart for for just a period of time
[1:56:14] here
[1:56:15] but my brother and sister it's not for
[1:56:17] us to hide these things in our life
[1:56:20] it's for us to find deliverance from
[1:56:22] these things in our life
[1:56:24] we have a tendency of we're gonna fight
[1:56:27] in the backyard
[1:56:28] well i'll tell you the prophet of god
[1:56:29] said that i'm not going to counter that
[1:56:31] but how about we come to the place where
[1:56:33] the spirit of unity
[1:56:35] brings us to the place we're not
[1:56:36] fighting in the front yard backyard side
[1:56:39] yard
[1:56:39] or whatever my brother and sister that
[1:56:41] we can stand in the word of god
[1:56:43] hallelujah because you see what happens
[1:56:47] satan wants to come along
[1:56:51] and he wants to put this little that's
[1:56:54] it
[1:56:55] you know we're driving to church i'm not
[1:56:56] applying this to no one don't
[1:56:58] misunderstand me
[1:56:59] driving to church me and the husband
[1:57:02] just gotten a little tiff
[1:57:05] i really can't say amen to what the
[1:57:07] pastor is saying
[1:57:10] he do he just sewed a little
[1:57:11] condemnation
[1:57:16] oh maybe i'll go somewhere we don't like
[1:57:18] to go as message believers
[1:57:20] i was driving to church and there was a
[1:57:21] pretty woman on the sidewalk and i
[1:57:23] looked at her twice
[1:57:26] i feel so condemned there's just no way
[1:57:27] i can enter into the service now
[1:57:30] satan spreading a little condemnation
[1:57:34] i laughed at a joke that most believers
[1:57:38] would call dirty there's no way
[1:57:42] i could respond to the word of god and
[1:57:45] satan's going through there
[1:57:47] i wore clothes that i knew i should have
[1:57:49] threw out of my closet
[1:57:51] a long time ago and i don't know why i
[1:57:55] wore that
[1:57:56] little condemnation thrown out there
[1:57:59] and he just moves in our midst and we
[1:58:02] get to church
[1:58:05] and we're trying to praise god and we're
[1:58:07] asking for him to move
[1:58:09] but our hearts down there saying how can
[1:58:12] you do this
[1:58:14] don't you remember don't you remember
[1:58:18] don't you remember
[1:58:25] scripture says that we're not warring
[1:58:31] against flesh and but against
[1:58:34] principalities
[1:58:36] and powers of darkness
[1:58:43] i'll tell you how transparent i'm going
[1:58:44] to be
[1:58:46] this is going to be an owie but i just
[1:58:48] want you to understand
[1:58:49] i'm willing to preach what god lays on
[1:58:51] my heart
[1:58:53] sister jerry and i drive into church on
[1:58:54] wednesday night fighting like cats and
[1:58:56] dogs
[1:58:57] because that was probably a little too
[1:59:00] aggressive
[1:59:06] disagreeing over something
[1:59:09] so important that it will have
[1:59:12] no impact on our lives ever
[1:59:19] can someone say amen
[1:59:25] you know what it is even
[1:59:28] as we're driving along arguing
[1:59:33] sister jerry looks at me and goes
[1:59:36] why are we doing this
[1:59:44] because i want to
[1:59:51] now you can have a little sympathy for
[1:59:52] brother paul and sister jerry
[1:59:54] because wednesday night brother david
[1:59:57] drugged me out of my seat right over
[1:59:59] there
[2:00:00] i know those of you who are here in
[2:00:02] church and those that you watched it
[2:00:03] didn't see this but this is what
[2:00:04] happened
[2:00:05] he drug me out of my seat right up here
[2:00:08] to the center
[2:00:10] of the church and proceeded to stomp
[2:00:13] on me
[2:00:17] but it was in love
[2:00:26] and i'm quite certain we're not the only
[2:00:27] ones
[2:00:29] that those things happen to now i have a
[2:00:32] choice you have a choice
[2:00:33] you can look at the minister and say how
[2:00:36] dare him
[2:00:37] or you can look up and say thank you
[2:00:39] lord
[2:00:41] thank you lord i've got some oil
[2:00:46] oh come on saint i hope you see this
[2:00:48] thank you lord
[2:00:49] i've got some oil i can pour out
[2:00:53] i can pour this oil out and say forgive
[2:00:56] me lord
[2:00:57] thank you lord i want to pay this little
[2:01:00] debt
[2:01:00] of this spirit that got on me that
[2:01:03] caused me to do this
[2:01:04] hear it and cover it with the holy
[2:01:07] spirit pretty soon nobody's good enough
[2:01:09] to go to church with me
[2:01:10] but problem is the guy sitting next to
[2:01:12] you feels the same way about you
[2:01:15] and pretty soon the church just dies
[2:01:16] withers becomes cold and formal
[2:01:22] look now those of you that were going to
[2:01:23] go to a restaurant for mother's day
[2:01:25] actually i'm doing you a favor because
[2:01:26] the people will have all
[2:01:27] eaten and gone home by the time you get
[2:01:29] there
[2:01:32] but you see god's bringing us to a
[2:01:33] consciousness my brother and sister to a
[2:01:35] constant state to recognize who we are
[2:01:38] and what's happening around us right
[2:01:41] see because remind you once again we're
[2:01:43] not dealing with flesh and blood
[2:01:45] we're dealing with principalities and
[2:01:47] powers that would desire to come
[2:01:50] down into a household desire to come
[2:01:52] down into our car
[2:01:53] come down wherever and stir it up
[2:01:57] stuff that's underneath the blood we
[2:01:59] will be bold enough
[2:02:00] to walk under the blood and drag that
[2:02:03] back out
[2:02:04] and say there you go you did this
[2:02:07] you said this you whatever this my
[2:02:10] brother and sister that's how strong
[2:02:12] those anointings are
[2:02:14] but any son or daughter of god that
[2:02:16] examines his life would say you know
[2:02:17] what
[2:02:18] it's only by the grace of god that i
[2:02:20] myself can stand
[2:02:22] and praise god lift my hands in worship
[2:02:24] only by the grace of god i'm able to do
[2:02:27] that
[2:02:29] does that mean we shove it under the rug
[2:02:31] reminds me
[2:02:34] of a cartoon it was on a little
[2:02:36] preacher's website
[2:02:38] you'll never find it that's good
[2:02:41] but it shows this three or four stage
[2:02:43] cartoon and it's obvious it's a preacher
[2:02:45] he's standing on the step with his bible
[2:02:52] and the wife looks out the window oh my
[2:02:56] goodness honey it's preacher
[2:02:58] jones and they look at each other
[2:03:01] what are we gonna do you lift up the rug
[2:03:05] and i'll start sweeping everything
[2:03:07] underneath it
[2:03:10] i'm sure that solved all the problems
[2:03:12] didn't it
[2:03:14] but the last frame of the cartoon
[2:03:21] shows the preacher standing inside their
[2:03:23] door
[2:03:24] on this big lump in the carpet
[2:03:28] and he says what's wrong here
[2:03:35] come on examine yourself deal with it
[2:03:39] clean your house out
[2:03:45] of course if you left the back door of
[2:03:47] the house open
[2:03:48] maybe instead under the rug while
[2:03:50] someone delays the preacher at the front
[2:03:52] door you can sweep
[2:03:53] all your problems out the back door
[2:03:59] okay other half of the sermon
[2:04:03] are we okay a few more minutes
[2:04:08] now remember this now look
[2:04:12] there is all of these keys
[2:04:18] that one unlocks another unlocks another
[2:04:20] that's how revelation works right
[2:04:22] we don't just unlock something and we
[2:04:24] have revelation
[2:04:25] sometimes we have to see one portion
[2:04:29] see that's what the oil is doing to us
[2:04:30] saints now look at this brother trevor
[2:04:34] hope you don't mind brother trevor and
[2:04:36] i've been good friends for a number of
[2:04:38] years now
[2:04:40] and we have at times disagreed with one
[2:04:41] another and we've been upset with one
[2:04:43] another
[2:04:44] and we have been vocal about him we
[2:04:46] brother trevor
[2:04:47] nothing to be ashamed of we didn't throw
[2:04:50] things we didn't call each other names
[2:04:51] we just disagree
[2:04:54] now my brother and sister in a case like
[2:04:57] that
[2:04:58] if we have a key that's been given to us
[2:05:03] the key was i gave to brother trevor and
[2:05:05] said if you'll unlock this you'll see
[2:05:06] i'm right
[2:05:12] no sir the same key
[2:05:15] that god gave to brother trevor he gave
[2:05:18] to paul
[2:05:20] and we find ourselves standing at the
[2:05:22] same door
[2:05:24] unlocking and stepping through
[2:05:28] into in this case we're talking a deeper
[2:05:31] relationship a deeper friendship
[2:05:33] deeper fellowship it doesn't end right
[2:05:35] there though
[2:05:37] god gives us another key and we unlock
[2:05:41] the door
[2:05:41] and we step in a little deeper
[2:05:45] you see that's how friendship is made
[2:05:47] that's how we have confidence
[2:05:48] when someone says well you said this and
[2:05:51] i didn't understand
[2:05:52] you don't get offensive that's right you
[2:05:54] know what do you mean
[2:05:55] you didn't like what i preached no i
[2:05:57] didn't understand what you said
[2:05:59] or vice versa you ought to hear brother
[2:06:01] trevor when he starts
[2:06:02] talking about certain topics we were
[2:06:04] sitting i remember whose house that was
[2:06:05] one night and i'm like
[2:06:07] is this the brother trevor i know i was
[2:06:08] talking about this adam thing this and
[2:06:10] this did this
[2:06:11] and that come around like this and this
[2:06:13] was like that and i'm like
[2:06:16] look i think i understand what you're
[2:06:17] saying brother trevor you're saying that
[2:06:18] if we plant a good seed in dirt and
[2:06:20] water it that it'll grow is that what
[2:06:22] that was
[2:06:22] is that what you were saying
[2:06:29] but you see god's bringing this bride
[2:06:31] down to one mind
[2:06:33] now look at this remember this
[2:06:36] christ in the true church
[2:06:40] what did he do we had to all be given
[2:06:42] the same key
[2:06:44] to get into church come on we're not in
[2:06:47] a different building we're not in a
[2:06:49] different church as it were right
[2:06:50] we've been given the same key to get
[2:06:53] into the same church
[2:06:54] christ in the true church is a
[2:06:56] continuation
[2:06:58] of the book of acts we've read this
[2:06:59] quote so many times we should be able to
[2:07:01] just quote it right
[2:07:02] amen but look at this now it's a
[2:07:05] continuation of the book of acts
[2:07:07] but the book of revelation shows how
[2:07:09] that the antichrist spirit would come
[2:07:12] into the church
[2:07:13] and defile it making it lukewarm formal
[2:07:16] and powerless it exposes satan
[2:07:20] revealing his works now look at this
[2:07:23] saints
[2:07:24] what we're talking about here this
[2:07:26] moving of the holy spirit this oil to
[2:07:29] pour
[2:07:29] out is exposing satan
[2:07:33] and so we have here i mean anybody
[2:07:35] that's been married more than i don't
[2:07:37] know how long has most honeymoons last
[2:07:40] 50 years okay so
[2:07:43] so i think i'm gonna come move into your
[2:07:46] house and see how it's done
[2:07:47] because our honeymoon lasted about three
[2:07:49] days i went back to work
[2:07:56] [Laughter]
[2:07:59] man you've had it good brother david
[2:08:04] now look at this what is happening is is
[2:08:07] satan's coming
[2:08:10] he's the creditor and he's coming in
[2:08:13] here
[2:08:14] and he's trying to take what he
[2:08:18] says he has claimed to
[2:08:22] so the book of acts my brother and
[2:08:25] sister
[2:08:26] was not an event that's right
[2:08:29] it was an experience that's right
[2:08:33] that's where people get it so wrong
[2:08:37] so what is brother brown saying here i'm
[2:08:38] not changing his words don't accuse me
[2:08:40] of changing the prophet's words
[2:08:42] i'm going to say what he said but i want
[2:08:43] you to understand what he meant
[2:08:47] christ in the true body of
[2:08:50] believers is a continuation
[2:08:54] of the acts of those
[2:08:57] true believers
[2:09:08] the book of revelation shows that the
[2:09:09] antichrist spirit
[2:09:11] would come into church amen
[2:09:20] and defile it he didn't come to church
[2:09:22] to worship
[2:09:23] he can't worship the prophet of god says
[2:09:25] that if the devil come
[2:09:26] and he got under the blood and he
[2:09:28] wouldn't have the experience he'd be
[2:09:30] your brother
[2:09:32] so he's not even here to take part of
[2:09:35] the
[2:09:35] experience in other words he doesn't
[2:09:38] care whether he's got oil to pour out or
[2:09:40] not
[2:09:41] he got anointed with that oil at one
[2:09:43] time he got a little oil on him got just
[2:09:46] a little oil in his vessel
[2:09:48] and he's good with that
[2:09:52] making it lukewarm saints that's why i'm
[2:09:55] not here to
[2:09:56] punish you i'm not here to drag services
[2:09:58] out i don't measure service by length
[2:10:00] but there's just so much to say
[2:10:04] making it lukewarm you know why i fight
[2:10:07] against the formal side here saints
[2:10:09] i encourage you someone say amen someone
[2:10:11] respond somebody please lift in somebody
[2:10:12] please smile because you see the spirit
[2:10:15] of formality
[2:10:16] doesn't just jump on a church
[2:10:21] pardon me for putting it this way it
[2:10:23] starts on this row
[2:10:25] and it silences them
[2:10:28] and then it moves to this realm and it
[2:10:30] silences them
[2:10:33] until pretty soon no one wants to speak
[2:10:36] up
[2:10:38] no one acknowledges how great
[2:10:42] yes my god amen amen
[2:10:46] and when it becomes lukewarm it becomes
[2:10:49] formal
[2:10:51] then it becomes powerless
[2:10:56] you say brother paul where are you going
[2:10:57] with this i'm telling you there was a
[2:11:00] sister
[2:11:01] and when a prophet told her you go home
[2:11:03] and you take that oil
[2:11:05] and you start pouring it out i'm just
[2:11:08] gonna
[2:11:09] kind of go beyond what i said earlier
[2:11:11] maybe the jug was bigger than paul
[2:11:13] thinks it is
[2:11:15] and then say get your son to pour it out
[2:11:19] mama god started with you pouring it out
[2:11:23] maybe she needed to pray through lord
[2:11:25] give me strength to lift this jug up
[2:11:28] but it didn't matter powerless
[2:11:32] it exposes satan you want to know what's
[2:11:35] happening my brother and sister
[2:11:36] now look i know none of you ever fuss
[2:11:38] and fight with each other it's just
[2:11:39] sister jerry and i on the way to church
[2:11:41] because
[2:11:42] i didn't see anybody jump up and say
[2:11:44] amen
[2:11:45] but um you know you know what satan's
[2:11:47] doing
[2:11:48] he's coming in and we're looking for
[2:11:50] some greater sign we're looking for
[2:11:52] something but just like the holy spirit
[2:11:53] moves in our midst it's a spirit
[2:11:56] the devil moves in you thought you heard
[2:11:58] a click that was him closing the back
[2:12:00] door
[2:12:01] he wants to be inside he wants to
[2:12:03] convince you
[2:12:05] that's fanaticism don't do it don't do
[2:12:07] it don't do it don't do it
[2:12:08] it won't make any difference and besides
[2:12:10] that
[2:12:12] you're fighting with your husband on the
[2:12:13] way to church
[2:12:15] you have no right to do it
[2:12:19] sorry under the blood i took the oil
[2:12:22] i poured it and covered that
[2:12:26] see what's happening saints satan's
[2:12:28] getting exposed
[2:12:29] now you you you might be ashamed and say
[2:12:31] you know what we're fussing and we're
[2:12:33] fighting and i i
[2:12:34] just have condom no no no no no no stop
[2:12:36] stop stop stop
[2:12:37] sometimes god lets that happen to expose
[2:12:40] the devil
[2:12:41] so that you start to recognize how the
[2:12:44] devil's
[2:12:45] tactics work and his spirit and the work
[2:12:48] that he's doing
[2:12:50] you recognize it you can say that spirit
[2:12:53] i i experienced it before
[2:12:57] i recognize that spirit i'm not going
[2:12:59] back there
[2:13:00] i'm not going back there and reveals his
[2:13:03] works now look at this see what brother
[2:13:04] branham tied with this
[2:13:06] you say well brother paul what do you
[2:13:07] mean what is this about how
[2:13:09] is this look what it's all about i
[2:13:11] believe god anointed the prophet to put
[2:13:13] this into words here it exposes satan
[2:13:15] revealing his works
[2:13:16] what is his works attempted destruction
[2:13:20] of you and discrediting
[2:13:23] of the word that's that's what he's
[2:13:26] doing
[2:13:27] you you you say well
[2:13:30] no no that was god that was god that let
[2:13:33] you
[2:13:34] that was god you say it was the devil no
[2:13:36] my brother and sister the devil can't do
[2:13:38] anything but what god allows him to do
[2:13:40] it
[2:13:41] god sometimes will let you fall down
[2:13:44] so that you can recognize i don't belong
[2:13:48] here
[2:13:49] this is not who i am
[2:13:53] and when you start to come to that and
[2:13:55] the next time the devil comes that way
[2:13:57] you're like no he's trying to destroy me
[2:14:01] i'm not going to live with condemnation
[2:14:04] i am called to liberty i am called to
[2:14:08] the freedom of the moving of the holy
[2:14:09] spirit
[2:14:10] i will not be bound by these spirits and
[2:14:13] then you start to push back against them
[2:14:15] amen right down to the time he's passing
[2:14:18] the lake of fire he fights that
[2:14:21] what is it not flesh and blood
[2:14:24] this is the fight of principalities and
[2:14:26] powers of darkness
[2:14:28] this is the devil my brother and sister
[2:14:33] it might be easier if the devil just
[2:14:34] come
[2:14:36] and just took a sword and cut you
[2:14:39] we'd say wow look what he just did to me
[2:14:43] but look how the devil can come and take
[2:14:46] the sword
[2:14:47] now understand what i'm saying the sword
[2:14:51] of the spirit and he can come right down
[2:14:55] and he can cut a little here
[2:14:59] and cut a little there and pretty soon
[2:15:04] little spirits pop up my husband doesn't
[2:15:07] love
[2:15:08] me i don't know if i was called to be a
[2:15:11] believer
[2:15:13] my wife my children
[2:15:16] the devils there are cut here and a cut
[2:15:19] there
[2:15:20] and a cut there what is it he's
[2:15:22] destroying you
[2:15:23] did you know in the days when they
[2:15:25] fought with the rapier
[2:15:27] they didn't try to drive the rapier is a
[2:15:30] very
[2:15:31] thin very flexible blade
[2:15:34] they weren't trying in those days to
[2:15:37] drive that through a man's armor into
[2:15:39] his heart
[2:15:41] but then cut him on the wrist cut him on
[2:15:43] the side of the face
[2:15:45] cut him in the side here cut him on the
[2:15:48] calf of the leg
[2:15:50] and pretty soon from the i hope you get
[2:15:53] this
[2:15:55] from the loss of the blood
[2:16:00] when we finally come to the place we
[2:16:02] step away from the blood
[2:16:05] we die we lay down
[2:16:09] and fight no more amen see that's what
[2:16:12] satan's doing
[2:16:14] right he fights that he can't stand it
[2:16:17] he
[2:16:18] knows that if you
[2:16:21] are you with me he knows that if you
[2:16:24] get the true revelation of the true
[2:16:26] church and
[2:16:28] what you is i know that's not good
[2:16:30] english and what
[2:16:32] you stand for and what you can do the
[2:16:36] greater works you can do the greater
[2:16:38] works are you with me
[2:16:39] i know i'm changing these words but
[2:16:41] don't make this impersonal
[2:16:43] don't make it just a quote i read make
[2:16:45] this realize
[2:16:46] this is the warfare that you are in it
[2:16:49] is not flesh and blood
[2:16:51] it is not the wife it is not the husband
[2:16:53] it is not the parents
[2:16:55] it is not the children it is not the
[2:16:57] preacher
[2:16:59] it's the devil
[2:17:06] because you see every time
[2:17:09] he gets you to the place that your
[2:17:12] confidence in god is waning
[2:17:16] he's winning that's what he's trying to
[2:17:19] do
[2:17:20] he's fighting you see my brother and
[2:17:23] sister
[2:17:25] when you are kept from the greater work
[2:17:30] mama i just told you this morning
[2:17:34] of a story of the bible of a mother
[2:17:38] that did the greater work
[2:17:41] it wasn't like we think she didn't go
[2:17:44] out there
[2:17:46] and tell that creditor you're a lion
[2:17:49] cheating deceiving devil
[2:17:53] she didn't go stand on a corner and say
[2:17:56] this is false
[2:17:57] this is false that is false what'd she
[2:17:59] do she closed the doors
[2:18:01] to the house and she started pouring out
[2:18:05] the spirit of god into the house
[2:18:09] oh man mistakes my children wouldn't
[2:18:11] believe me
[2:18:12] no i'm here to tell you that's the devil
[2:18:14] it's called condemnation
[2:18:16] we think kids if they hear those voices
[2:18:21] 11 45 at night
[2:18:26] they're not in there going oh mom and
[2:18:28] dad are praising the lord
[2:18:34] you're not fooling them you're fooling
[2:18:36] yourself
[2:18:40] you see all he's trying to do is keep
[2:18:44] you
[2:18:45] from doing the greater work you say but
[2:18:48] i got discouraged and i walked away from
[2:18:51] church i got discouraged my family has
[2:18:52] walked away from church we're
[2:18:54] discouraged
[2:18:55] that's all right you're all right you
[2:18:57] might think everybody's going to look at
[2:18:58] you like a sinner
[2:18:59] i'll tell you what you do you turn right
[2:19:01] back and come back to the word you don't
[2:19:03] have to come to this church you don't
[2:19:04] have to call me your pastor
[2:19:05] none of that is important you've got to
[2:19:07] get back to the word of god
[2:19:09] you've got to get back to that oil
[2:19:11] you've got to get back to that position
[2:19:13] right there
[2:19:14] see but what he's trying to do is
[2:19:17] convince her
[2:19:18] what she's standing for is not right and
[2:19:20] convince her
[2:19:21] she can't do the greater work but when
[2:19:24] god comes down
[2:19:25] and the oil is poured out without
[2:19:27] hindrance
[2:19:29] you wake up oh i hope saints that you
[2:19:31] can say amen to this
[2:19:32] you wake up in the morning and you're
[2:19:34] like thank you lord
[2:19:36] that i'm a son of god thank you lord i'm
[2:19:38] a daughter of god
[2:19:40] none of yesterday none of last week
[2:19:44] last month last year has anything to do
[2:19:47] you recognize who you are right now
[2:19:51] there's the time grasp the moment take
[2:19:54] the word
[2:19:56] examine the house cast out everything
[2:19:58] that doesn't fit
[2:19:59] doesn't apply let the oil flow
[2:20:03] right amen hallelujah i think i've wore
[2:20:06] my thought out
[2:20:09] well who wants to sister emmy would you
[2:20:12] come
[2:20:13] who wants to be an invincible army you
[2:20:16] know revelation comes in many forms my
[2:20:18] brother and sister
[2:20:19] we have revelation understand the bible
[2:20:21] we have revelation to understand the
[2:20:23] spiritual world
[2:20:24] we have revelation understand the
[2:20:25] natural
[2:20:28] and if we'll have an understanding now
[2:20:30] catch this
[2:20:32] we'll have an understanding of the
[2:20:34] spirits that are moving
[2:20:36] in this present world that's a
[2:20:38] revelation we need we often times yes
[2:20:40] sir i got a revelation
[2:20:41] i do this you know it's interesting i
[2:20:43] just love the statement that brother
[2:20:45] david made the other day the seventh
[2:20:46] seal is not a doctor
[2:20:50] the revelation of jesus christ is not a
[2:20:52] doctrine
[2:20:54] it's an experience hallelujah
[2:20:58] and if that is closed we got some
[2:21:01] serious problems
[2:21:03] that means nobody has got a relationship
[2:21:05] with god
[2:21:07] so when you understand the spirits
[2:21:09] moving in this present world and you
[2:21:11] understand that the creditor is still on
[2:21:13] the job
[2:21:15] amen but i want you to remember most of
[2:21:19] all
[2:21:19] the oil is still being poured out
[2:21:26] hurt not the oil and the wine
[2:21:30] holy spirit's still pouring out
[2:21:33] don't let the devil tell you it's
[2:21:35] somebody else it's you saints
[2:21:38] it's you this invincible army
[2:21:42] this true church it's not someone else
[2:21:44] it's you
[2:21:45] it's you take a hold of that
[2:21:48] if you find yourself oh hallelujah sorry
[2:21:52] i don't know if this
[2:21:53] offends someone forgive me but if you
[2:21:55] find yourself
[2:21:57] in a constant battle with someone
[2:22:03] they're just this they're just that they
[2:22:05] want this they want that
[2:22:08] they do this they do that
[2:22:12] i just ask you as your friend your
[2:22:13] brother will you stop
[2:22:15] [Music]
[2:22:17] close the doors of your house
[2:22:20] leave the husband outside leave the wife
[2:22:24] outside
[2:22:25] leave the kids outside leave the parents
[2:22:28] outside
[2:22:30] close the doors of your house
[2:22:34] and get to the place
[2:22:37] that the oil flows freely
[2:22:41] you know always marvel this is kind of a
[2:22:43] little humorous in a way
[2:22:47] evangelists come to a church
[2:22:51] preach some tremendous services
[2:22:56] there was a lady in the church she was
[2:22:57] considered the church information center
[2:23:02] you know what that translates into in
[2:23:03] english don't you she was the gossip
[2:23:08] god strikes her heart during that
[2:23:10] saturday night meeting
[2:23:12] and the evangelist tells him god's dealt
[2:23:15] with you you go home and don't quit
[2:23:17] praying until you prayed through
[2:23:18] good sound advice she come back to
[2:23:21] church
[2:23:22] sunday morning
[2:23:24] [Music]
[2:23:25] and she's there in church worshiping the
[2:23:27] lord tears
[2:23:29] that she hadn't cried in years flowing
[2:23:30] down her cheeks
[2:23:33] and she looks over at old mrs widow
[2:23:35] jones and goes oh
[2:23:36] praise god the lord
[2:23:39] just sure changed sister jonas
[2:23:47] [Music]
[2:23:52] and when we come in the presence of the
[2:23:56] outpouring
[2:23:57] of the oil why
[2:24:01] suddenly everyone around us is going to
[2:24:03] look a lot better
[2:24:13] so much more to say things
[2:24:15] [Music]
[2:24:17] let's see let's go back to his quote
[2:24:19] real quick exposes satan revealing his
[2:24:21] works
[2:24:23] the attempted destruction of god's
[2:24:24] people and discrediting god's word
[2:24:27] right down to the time he's cast in the
[2:24:28] lake of fire he don't quit
[2:24:31] we got people that are just like i don't
[2:24:32] know if i'm going to go and serve god or
[2:24:33] not
[2:24:34] all right well the devil ain't going to
[2:24:35] quit at least you can mimic the devil
[2:24:39] he fights that he can't stand it now
[2:24:41] look at this
[2:24:42] oh here's i knew i had it in here
[2:24:44] ephesians 6
[2:24:46] 10 14
[2:24:49] finally brother be tossed around in the
[2:24:54] lord
[2:24:56] and in your weakness no no no that's the
[2:24:59] devil's interpretation
[2:25:01] finally my brethren be strong in the
[2:25:03] lord
[2:25:04] and in the power of his mind put on the
[2:25:07] whole armor of god that you may be able
[2:25:09] to stand against
[2:25:10] the wiles of the devil he's tricky come
[2:25:12] on
[2:25:13] pardon me i'm not trying to imply
[2:25:14] nothing but he's tricky he knows how
[2:25:17] you know we get in the car to go to
[2:25:18] church and he don't just stand on the
[2:25:20] curb and say i hope they invite me i
[2:25:21] hope they invite me
[2:25:22] no sir he goes right over there and he
[2:25:25] just jumps right in
[2:25:26] seat belt he doesn't want you to know
[2:25:28] he's in the car because the seat belt
[2:25:29] bites going to ding his
[2:25:30] seatbelt on he settles down he's
[2:25:33] comfortable

[2:25:45] when i drive like that you you get upset

[2:25:54] i'm going 45 and a half miles an hour
[2:26:00] you should take a different route to
[2:26:02] church
[2:26:05] those are not the shoes i put out for
[2:26:06] you
[2:26:11] well that's nothing i didn't realize i
[2:26:12] was in the car that the tie that i'm

[2:26:20] be in church today praise the lord
[2:26:22] we're looking for a great moving of the
[2:26:24] holy spirit today
[2:26:26] as soon as i can cast this spirit off
[2:26:30] i'll be able to receive something from
[2:26:32] the lord
[2:26:34] unfortunately it took all but three
[2:26:36] minutes of the church service to cast
[2:26:38] that other spirit off
[2:26:44] he's widely isn't he
[2:26:48] he's willing
[2:26:51] i've listened to believers fight over
[2:26:54] whether or not
[2:26:56] the wife put pepper scalloped
[2:27:00] potatoes

[2:27:25] whole time he's trying to diminish
[2:27:27] everyone's value oh you say no no they
[2:27:31] were speaking to me in such a fashion my
[2:27:33] value is diminished no no
[2:27:34] the speaker's value is also declining

[2:27:52] together
[2:27:54] for we wrestle not against
[2:27:57] flesh and blood but against
[2:28:00] principalities against
[2:28:02] powers against rulers of darkness
[2:28:05] of this world against spiritual
[2:28:08] wickedness
[2:28:09] in high places let that be a revelation
[2:28:13] to us saints
[2:28:15] we're not wrestling husband to wife wife
[2:28:17] to husband children and parents
[2:28:19] we're not wrestling against brother or
[2:28:21] sister
[2:28:22] we're wrestling against spirits that are
[2:28:24] anointing you
[2:28:26] wrestling against spirits that want to
[2:28:28] get in the car with you
[2:28:29] get in the house with you go to church
[2:28:31] with you
[2:28:33] when we catch a revelation that that is
[2:28:36] not
[2:28:36] the holy spirit then let's close the
[2:28:39] doors
[2:28:41] let's get the vessels let's start
[2:28:43] pouring out the oil
[2:28:45] because we certainly must be low
[2:28:48] on oil
[2:28:52] oh hallelujah
[2:28:57] i hope this don't come down as
[2:28:58] congregationally today
[2:29:00] i love you i love you
[2:29:04] you see he says that if the people get
[2:29:06] the true revelation
[2:29:08] that's on the personal level too many
[2:29:11] times we have a revelation of the
[2:29:13] message
[2:29:14] but we never got it down on a personal
[2:29:15] level
[2:29:16] [Applause]
[2:29:17] [Music]
[2:29:20] hallelujah you see
[2:29:23] i'm skipping over some stuff i'm sorry
[2:29:26] i think you've got the point satan's
[2:29:28] been called out saints
[2:29:30] prophet's message come called satan now
[2:29:32] identified
[2:29:34] he's called out he's identified and he's
[2:29:36] been
[2:29:37] rejected hallelujah
[2:29:40] you've all seen the little stamp apply
[2:29:44] for something
[2:29:45] they have accepted or rejected
[2:29:48] hallelujah you know maybe spiritually
[2:29:52] you all need to get some of those
[2:29:54] and when the devil comes around and the
[2:29:57] devil comes around and he starts
[2:29:58] throwing something
[2:29:59] on you why don't you just stomp long
[2:30:03] enough and
[2:30:04] reach in your pocket pull that little
[2:30:06] pad out in that little stamp
[2:30:09] say see
[2:30:11] [Music]
[2:30:13] when he gets right up close because he
[2:30:14] thinks you want to fellowship with him
[2:30:16] you can just take that ink pad
[2:30:18] and reject it
[2:30:22] depart depart
[2:30:26] reject it saints i hope somehow this be
[2:30:30] a blessing to you today
[2:30:32] you realize oh we got these problems we
[2:30:34] got these problems no no
[2:30:37] no you know just got to recognize who
[2:30:40] you are the true church
[2:30:42] when she recognizes who she is she will
[2:30:44] be the invincible army
[2:30:46] that's what god's allowing to happen
[2:30:47] he's allowing your recognition
[2:30:50] your identification ability he's
[2:30:52] allowing that to be sharpened
[2:30:55] because the scripture says some people
[2:30:58] around the message are
[2:30:59] absolutely afraid of this scripture says
[2:31:01] it would be so close
[2:31:03] to deceive the very elect i've seen
[2:31:06] people post that on social media with
[2:31:08] dot dot dot dot after that be
[2:31:11] so close it would deceive the very left
[2:31:13] and i thought that's a deceiver
[2:31:16] that would represent it that the very
[2:31:18] elect could be deceived
[2:31:20] but my bible says and my prophet quoted
[2:31:24] if it were
[2:31:28] what's happening you're being taught
[2:31:32] to recognize the devil and his
[2:31:35] wives aren't you glad can we rejoice
[2:31:38] we're being taught amen we're being
[2:31:40] taught since

[2:31:49] but we are being taught and it has to be
[2:31:52] taken from the mind

[2:42:14] exact commission you say well where did
