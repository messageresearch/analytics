know there are those that I I write as I study I write names down want to remember in prayer and then I leave the note on the desk and uh get here and can't remember Sister Carrie still in Denver amen let's remember our sister Carrie in prayer amen she cherishes her time with her sister and uh we just pray that God would just let her life speak uh be a testimony amen we already shared the request uh from Sister conscious she sent that this morning just for us to remember uh to the Lord bless the doctor the surgery and uh uh to break a femur at any age is a serious thing and and uh her dad is not no longer a young man amen we want to remember our sister Dorcas as I was talking to her the other day she just said brother Paul it's just always pain I always don't feel good and we just need to lift her up in prayer let's count that our prayers for our sister as though we were the one in that situation amen often times we say well what about this and what about that what about if it was you amen let's remember her in prayer amen our brother Camden and uh brother Logan um not feeling well uh it is my understanding uh sometimes I'm probably a little slow on the uptake but I do believe that they are moving here or have moved here brother Logan is the younger brother he's already enrolled in cahi and uh so we just need to pray for them uh for their family uh their mom and siblings amen my brother Sergey want to remember him also as I talked to him yesterday he was headed east um and uh uh in a hurry to be home amen amen uh Hallelujah I think it's time I hopefully I don't embarrass anybody I'm I'm losing a little bit of my filter and that's bad but anyway let's start really lifting our sister ulia up in prayer uh the Lord blessed them with a beautiful little boy and we just want uh her to be strong uh and uh the Lord just keep her that strength until uh as I was reading scripture today h the scripture said as a a woman travaileth with child she's in sorrow but at the Deliverance she says thank you Lord for the man amen we just want to remember in prayer hallelujah amen brother basilia I had you on the prayer list but you're here so you're still on the prayer list God bless you amen hallelujah um I want to speak to you to today on a little time comes thank you musicians God bless you I love the song service this morning partly because uh it just seemed to go right together with with thoughts um you know just uh things that we are uh uh sometimes thinking and all of a sudden it comes together in a song service and you could almost say hey focus on the song service God bless you have a wonderful day amen I want to speak to you on the title Lord lift the curtain and uh this comes out of a message which we'll get to in a little bit let's turn to Revelations the 2 chapter uh and the 11th verse we're actually going to take uh each one of these now the quote that we're going to use right off here I have uh ministered on that before but I just really felt led uh as the Lord just speaking to me uh last night just uh for us to uh remember the promises God has given us remember the blessings that he says he is already poured out now if it's already there remember how the prophet of God said our voice these voices George Washington's voice all these voices are still here now if God has spoke those promises it's up to us to reach out and take a hold of it the promise is right here we're not waiting for a promise to arrive from somewhere it's not ups and it's stuck somewhere out in the South China Sea but it's right here and it's up to you and I reach out take a hold of that promise you have need of it he's already promised it take a hold of that Revelations 211 now I'm going to jump down through these different verses in Revelation and I want to just expound uh on that thought verse 11 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death and I'm going to let you be seated God bless the reading of the word amen now we know what the second death is my brother and sister and really the natural death death means nothing it is on a a a uh message uh little I don't know if you call it a chat thing or whatever that I'd been invited to here a few years ago and in the last while here there's been many brothers uh sisters uh elderly it is and some not so elderly that are passing away and so there they have come face to face to across the Great Divine that narrow sea that STS us into the presence of God but my brother and sister sister their passing in the natural really doesn't mean much uh it means a lot to us as family as close friends but when we look at this the real uh uh Crux of the whole thing is those who cross over with no relationship amen they are the lost they are there in that time and the second death has touched them because that's the death or separation from God and so we'll see in this time that we're living in that all of these scriptures that we're going to touch on briefly for a moment all of them and and maybe we can in in uh future uh uh flesh each one of these out but you'll see it is a cumulative effect that is coming these are not just Standalone scripture but these are God adding scripture line upon line adding it together coming down into our day and he starts right off here in verse 11 and he says they shall not be hurt of the second death in other words they will be no Eternal separation uh of them from God and so what a what a blessed promise my brother and sister that we can reach back uh talking a different Church age but we can reach back and say thank you today Lord that you have given us a security you have given us the promise that we will not face the second death or the separation from God that we will once sealed amen a Son of God Holy Ghost filled Son of God in their passing from natural life has no concern about his future he has no uh insecurity his family should not have any insecurity about that because we have already been sealed and once sealed Christ has come there is nothing of the life or the afterlife that would be able to unseal them and I say thank you Lord amen and so we can sit here today with a security this morning that we have no fear of the and death amen and so each age as we would look at these each age it defines the reward that would go with that age and as it comes down in this time like I said they're not just individual to an age and it no longer is relevant but these are Promises of God that have been given and they come together as you might say jewels that are being uh brought together Revelations 2 and7 we just move a few verses down he says there he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden Mana brother Chris touched on this just the other day uh we'll give him a white stone in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receive it so we find now that the Overcomer in that day is there and he is receiving now this hidden mana and it's a beautiful thing my brother and sister go study what brother brandham uh breaks down for us on the hidden Mana it is there something my brother and sister that by God's grace the man down the street now we don't stand here in arrogance to say this but the man down the street May read the same scripture you do all of his life and never see that hidden Mana amen so we ought to be thanking God every single day that our eyes have been open amen it's not just oh we see God sent a prophet many people have that Revelation but do not see the hidden Mana this is a blessing from God and we should be saying thank you Lord for every single blessing that he pours out upon us and so it's there and we won't take time to explain all this but he's got hidden Mana White Stone a new name and no man knows saving him that received it my brother and sister another person uh cannot come and understand what God's dealing in your heart you might not be living it like you should it might not be uh expressed it might not be uh uh open in Vision as it should be but there's something down inside there that is drawing that person drawing right out of the myy the song says he brought me out of the myy clay amen my brother and sister there still might be traces of clay upon that individual but it's God that's bringing them out and God said by my word I will wash them and until they are whiter than snow how white is that my brother and sister it's beautiful and that's how we should look at one another and that's how we should look at ourself according to the word because the minute you look at your flesh or the Flesh of another you'll see fault after fault after fault you'll see something that you could say well they my brother and sister let's look in the mirror of the word amen oh thank you Lord for the washing of the water of the word amen wash me again Lord amen and look at this now what he's saying unto them is is not so much my brother we'll get to it in a minute not so much about the Overcomer part because we can look at that and we'll say well are we Overcomers and some will say they're Overcomers but it doesn't appear to be but we're not going to focus we're going to take the prophet's word here in a minute and we're going to touch upon that now Revelations 2 and 26 he says there he that overcometh and keepeth my Works unto the end to him will I give power over the Nations so you can't have Revelation as it were and walk away from it and expect to receive the reward this is a race amen that we are taking as brother Craig preached amen the way we are taking the way all the way amen not stopping along the way but we're allowing the way to take us where we've been called to go amen we weren't called to just run for a season but we're called to run to the Finish amen Hallelujah and it can be laborious it can be a struggle we can feel tired we can feel weak we can feel forsaken but he said I will never forsake you so it's only the devil when we say I feel forsaken it's only the devil coming in a time of distress and whispering in our ear Satan using the time of distress but I'll tell you my brother and sister God also uses times of distress God allows us to come into times that we do feel forsaken that we do feel lonely we do feel weary we do feel and God says I'm doing this I'm allowing this to happen because you need to break through you need to come to a place that you realize there's a deeper depth and a higher high than you've ever experienced but if you're complacent and you settle for that and say well praise God this is just what it is to be a Christian just to feel defeated just to feel all these things no God wants you to know Victory and it's not always a victory my brother and sister I'll get ahead of myself I'm sorry it's not always a victory over some great thing out here but my brother and sister sometimes it's victory over self amen we already know that our self is our greatest enemy we already know that our self is our hindrance oh this brother he he's hindering me no it's not if you come prayed up and you you're hearing the preaching of the word nothing will hinder you amen it will be God's lip to your ear and you'll walk out hearing maybe something no one else in the church heard and that was because God came to speak to you amen that's right amen amen just give me the word amen doesn't have to be profound and definitely we don't want it watered down just give me the word I would sing that right now if I could sing amen that just strikes my heart amen just give me the word that's all I need amen amen it doesn't have to be you know the prophet of God I I just I I I won't go into all the things because then I'll start preaching down that vein but the prophet of God talking about what God's got he said if he wants me to go to Africa and preach to thousands he'll provide the money if he wants me to go over here to some little spot over here and preach to 10 people he will provide amen but we get in programs and we get like we need to do this and we need to do that what we need to do is take God at his word [Music] hallelujah hallelujah somebody tell me where was I did we touch verse 26 okay okay sorry I'm in a tizzy Revelation 3:5 he said he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment see a direct connection between the Overcomer and how he's clothed come on we ought to think about it Saints we don't look like Le oia amen we we are not a representation of Cl of Le oysa amen the Overcomer will be dressed according to the word amen be clothed in white rment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before the angels I want to tell you Saints there's some Believers this morning is there any believers here there's some Believers this morning whose name are be confessed before the father right at this very moment can someone say thank you Lord hallelujah that my name your name is being confessed even as we sit here sometimes struggling with the things of life and what decisions to make and whatever we're struggling and at that moment Satan's trying to say look you're defeated give up stop now and your name is being confessed before the father at that very moment oh that ought to make somebody kind of happy amen it ought to make us realize that God's plan is so perfect he's got the provision already in place Hallelujah God's not like now who was this you were talking about Amen brother Trevor yeah it's brother Trevor I know brother Trevor and that might scare us sometimes but when it scares us we should stop that and rejoice and say he knows my name amen he knows my name I'm not a stranger I'm his lamb I'm his sheep and He Knows My Name Hallelujah I like that sir now if our name would be confessed before God then imagine what it would be if our brothers and sisters are confessing us before God also am and we are lifting up Faithfully hallelujah amen now I think we come right down to here man I'm just in a tizzy this morning my mind is just going Hallelujah forgive me him that overcometh what I make a pillar in the temple of my God Amen Hallelujah do you know a pillar is a permanent part amen we might not grasp eternity but I'll tell you if I'm a pillar in his house in his his kingdom I in his Temple if I'm a pillar there amen as long as there is a house of God I'm part of it Hallelujah God's not going to come and say well the roof will fall in but I'm removing this pillar no he's placed that as the master builder that's right placed it in exactly the right spot you realize this morning you have been placed in exactly the right spot today cuz God has placed you right where he want to bless you right where he wants to use you right where he wants to manifest or magnify himself in your presence he's put you right there so that he can do that amen not a reference of someone that was somewhere one time once upon a time but he can point right there in his Temple amen right in his house he can say this is who it is this is my son this is my daughter and they're doing exactly what I called them to Lord never to go away Eternal in the heavens my my oh my and he shall go out no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is the New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name amen I'm gonna just put this out in simplicity so don't don't you know say whoa whoa just a second but I'll tell you what the Simplicity of the new name is Mrs Jesus Christ that is ownership amen now we live in a day of feminism and and not to pick on any sisters or whatever but right we're living in a day that the word of God said that the women would rise up and the men would become more effeminate and and less ability to make hard decisions and and the women would rise up to that position my brother and sister and when we come and we take the name of Mrs Jesus Christ that is a sign of complete surrender and a complete ownership now I'm not going to sit here and go into all the things about the spirit of the age what I do know is I want to be identified as the Lamb's wife I want to be identified as part of that body amen where he comes and says I give you my name Hallelujah the wife shouldn't have to come and say and look I I I'm gonna Force you I'm GNA Force you in public to give me your name no my brother and sister now take put your spiritual cap on when you think about that amen amen what has happened Christ is outside the church how can he give his name to those on the inside when there's never been a relationship a connection never been a consummation there's never been my brother and sister he can't give a name to something he has hasn't claimed and won't claim him so you see how God is working he's coming down in every one of these ages every one of these he's saying the Overcomer and he's placing this what he's doing my brother and sister is not throwing out something the idea of well if you can overcome you overcome maybe you can overcome a sin maybe you can overcome an unbelief maybe you can overcome the prophet deals just a little bit different with this my brother and sister and I think that we ought to get this anchored in our heart to understand that while overcoming sin is part of the equation right God gives us Grace amen whatever that thing might be that was in your life God gives us grace and mercy to come by Revelation and put that behind us as the scripture says we're going to put our foot on it amen we're not going to let that thing Trail along behind us forever that God allows us to bring a finality to that but there's still more to be an overcome amen there's still more to that amen and he says here that uh in Revelation 3:21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me here's culmination Saints amen I want you to look at this not just as the seventh age or whatever it would be but this is a culmination of the plan of God being brought right down in front of us he says uh to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne amen not next to it not on top of it in it that's right that's right amen the only way you get in the throne my brother and sisters become one with the word and when we become one with the word we're in the throne amen amen now that can be where people say well I have this Revelation I'm one with the word I'm talking about Jesus view of it Christ's view God's view whatever you want to do the Lord's view uh when the Lord views and says they're one with me we're one amen man can say anything he wants he can declare it in any fashion that he wants I've had the Holy Ghost for 50 years and I just listen to brother Brown say this a couple days ago he said there I've got I've got had the Holy Ghost for all this time and a got temper to fight AA that's right it's not what you say that's right and this kind of pinches a little bit okay I just want to be honest this pinches a little bit it's what we do we can say anything we want to say I want to sit down with my father and his throne that's a heart's desire amen failures shortcomings get stressed out get upset easy anybody help me with that list but you see God said I've already finished the work in you we're we're you know what is it they built some kind of spaceship and it's floating around in space right now and they're afraid to bring it home right do any of you know I'm talking about I can't remember who actually built that but they sent some spaceship up to the the space permanent space station and it's got a flaw they're afraid to fly at home they're thinking about trying to make it remote fly home my brother and sister we're that space station we're that rocket ship we got flaws and sometimes we're afraid but God said you're are finished work amen amen we're finished work we shouldn't be afraid to stand up today any one of us right here in this building regardless of what last week happened in your life you should be able to stand up this morning and say I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God and I possess every promise of God because God said amen thank you Lord I have a flaw I acknowledge I have a flaw and I pray about that flaw a lot because that flaw don't don't take me too serious in the sense of like that I I'm standing here God but don't ask Jerry either but he didn't say ask anything in my name if you don't have a flaw that's right you think God don't know your flaw actually he's burning it out of you slow but sure can someone say thank you Lord burn it out of me Lord I don't like the pain I don't like the suffering I don't like the trial but burn it out of me Lord yes amen amen now look at our age this all come down to a promise that the Overcomer of this day about to sit with him in his throne amen now I'm just going to make a a loose connection here so please bear with me get to sit with him in his throne amen not outside of it not to the right of it not to the left of it but we've been granted a privilege to sit with him in his throne in the beginning was the word and the word word was with God Amen and the Word was made flesh and we have beheld him amen go home look in a mirror behold Christ that seems like a long step but it's the truth Christ in you the hope of glory let that come out let's release it amen now look at this my brother and sister look at this common theme every age there's a thread that carries through a connection that carries to the next age brother Chris brought this out and uh uh uh I think this last Wednesday or Wednesday before that or I don't remember I think I was here so it have been two Wednesdays ago but you see every age I had just been reading that brother Chris and every age wants to look at the next age and say there that's wrong you guys are going somewhere out in the bushes you you're no no no no that's what they thought amen Luther Wesley every one of these age looking at what were God's moving on and the problem with that my brother and sister or their problem with that is that because they the prophet showed us how they came to a halt they went just so far and they come to us and they built something around that and then God moved on and then they started saying no we had the fire we had the fire you guys are wrong but you see every age it's going and we know this I'm not preaching nothing new to you amen now it comes down that we are in an age or the End of the Age we could get like all kinds of shuffling around on that but we come down to the end of the age and it's going to be a bride age and that means those that were in the leoan age are going to look at the bride and they're going to tell her who do you think you are saying that you have the bridegroom we had the bridegroom he's our bridegroom we built great big Shrine churches around the fact we had the bridegroom and you're telling me that because you an orphan are you with me amen that little story about the Cattleman son and all that such a cute little story that's the word unfailed my brother and sister because you're an orphan from denomination you're an orphan from the cares of this life an orphan from the control of Satan my chains are broken and we are there and they're saying no you're wrong who do you think you are who do you think you are still when the Chariot wagon whatever Buckboard drove up you didn't see that young man get out and go in the house and say you know I feel bad that I'm taking her and not you so why don't you come on he got out said there's only one here that I have come to redeem there's only one sounds very very aggressive passive aggressive all the rest of you nice girls you look like Le oia but you're nice you've met them the nicest of people but one and she didn't have a whole lot of baggage come on broaden the thinking please amen she wasn't bringing the bed she'd slept on and she wasn't bringing the cute little Chester drawers and she wasn't going to bring this and that no she knew what she needed and she was dressed for the occasion and that's all that went with her was those things that had changed her life the word his word that's what she took with her amen see so look at this this common theme uh connection to every age carries to the next age and you see I I kind of touch this got ahead of myself it's not just a victory over a certain sin and and we don't need to do that because my brother and sister every sin has no greater or uh no diminished value Sin is Sin amen and we can sit here and not believe the word and be just as Mark just a black mark on us just like the guy out here that's going to smoke a pack of cigarettes today and and drink a case of beer because it's Sunday we can be in unbelief and be no different in our position than that man right there so God help us us from having a condescending Spirit around us my brother and sister one pulling back from the word of God it's God's grace that pulls us right back amen it's God's mercy that pulls us amen so it's not just a victory over a certain sin although God will give us Authority and uh uh his power coming down in our life and the authority to take that word and put besetting sins behind us amen Can someone say Amen to that amen put those things behind this it might be impatience wait is that a sin it can be did you know that not trusting is a sin amen the prophet of God loved the song only believe and he believed it and saying it my brother and sister because he knew the power of that if we can bring yourself forgetting about what your flesh that's right looks like believe and God will change you that makes me excited every age had a greater expression of God's plan we see that through the church age book do you realize how blessed we are some people in the message don't even believe in the church age book they they don't even acknowledge but I'm glad it's there because I can look and see now now you can look at this and and and see how this is our savings account spiritual savings account we get to go back in history they lived it just like they don't know what Le is cuz we're living it but the piggy bank as it were God tucking it in now we get to come in here and go okay I see how God started this I see how he's doing this I see what he's done in our day and it clicks anybody have a click thank you Lord don't normally endorse clicks but um uh that's a click that you want to get is when that hey amen now see every age a greater expression now I want to know I'm speaking to Paul so nobody get offended what are we doing with the greater expression are we sitting back and saying God sent a prophet a bookcase full of message it ought to have an impact on our life it ought to be something whether you're talking about you know a a book a a cassette or a real toore let's get them all in there a a book a real toore uh real to real was before the book okay we got to get in the right order real toore a book a a cassette uh M MP3 CD Now thumb drive and brother pant told me brother Paul let me explain this to you brother pant you're listening I say this in love brother Paul I don't know if you'll get this or not but what I do is like write the dictionary on the end of a grain of sand you're right brother Pon I don't get it you follow the correlation it's come right down the impact of the message is greater but the volume of the book is no longer external as in all the writings and the teachings because he said I'm going to write it on your heart Hallelujah we don't have to have all these vast volumes I don't need to go read all the writings of all of the Great Men through the AG is coming right on down I have it now and God has come can someone please say Amen it's been rot on our heart today and it's there we going to take it everywhere we go and we won't forget it amen because it's been etched into our life and that's nothing but God himself come right down in that little bitty spot that's in your heart and wrote his word and placed it in there in the volume of the book amen it's become so real to to us oh my Hallelujah see we're in a greater expression this this might be a little boastful to some but we right now even in the Apostle Paul we are a greater expression of the word than ever been in any age because there was things in the word that brother John never saw that brother Paul never saw that's and there is no greater privilege than to be allowed to see it and live it amen that's that's when the word preached comes to life when we as Sons and Daughters of God have been granted a glorious privilege to live it amen amen God's not just saying I'll preach it and hopefully something comes with it God says I've got a chosen people amen that were called and chosen to be the ones to live out the Revelation and then I ask you is it easy the flesh says no but the soul says yes hallelujah amen how can I overcome let's go into to that I tell you what if you ever want to see time fly just have a sermon yeah now I'm not getting along very good so I got to speed this up overcome we get an idea that it's got to get this be setting sin behind me I want you to read what the prophet of God said amen overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks lots of people says there's no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil then the same time that you recognize him and know he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has already overcome him we can stand here and say praise God I'm an overcomer but my brother and sister I am nothing it's Christ in me amen I am nothing I can't overcome a single thing but Christ in me amen and he already said I've overcome him don't worry about that Spirit don't worry about that Doctrine don't worry about this movement my brother and sister he's already been the Overcomer and he's made us to be Overcomers amen hallelujah is already overcoming and by his grace you are more than a match for him amen sometimes on a Friday night I can only speak this for myself amen when you've worked ridiculous hours and you feel very tired and you know the Devil comes and starts to whisper but my brother and sister the minute that you look at that and say you know what Satan you're a liar that's right you're the same liar that's sitting down in a barroom you're the same liar that's down at the car lot and it's there Satan just flat out we know you're a liar amen don't entertain that that's right right my goodness somebody tells you you're ugly ugly ugly ugly all the time ugly ugly ugly ugly pretty soon you'll believe it that's right but my Bible says you are made in God's image that's right how can you be ug and be made in God's image how can you be less then and be made in God's image amen it's time for us to start in the broom closet and go all the way through the house and kick the devil's little IND indos out my brother and sister because I and you were made in His image I'm not made in the image of trash I'm not made in the image of a loser I'm not made in the image of a a a a defeated individual amen I'm made In His Image oh Hallelujah remind yourself of that a little more often Paul amen see by his grace you're more than a match not not by our our knowledge see that's why brother brandham spoke so often and so hard about sending the preachers off to some kind of school because they got the idea if we can refine the preacher make him polished I tell you what I don't remember where sister Jerry and I was at but one time a brother was making that point I don't know if he practic it or not but he could make the amen sound just like a dying calf and that became real to me what brother brandom had said and I'm just like that's it my brother and sisters see that's we could do that on our own we don't need to go to Seminary we can mess up the word all by oursel but you see when we recognize that this is God this word is God's gift to you amen aren't you oh doesn't it make you happy when you have a family event a birthday party uh you know uh I don't know some don't even celebrate Christmas we celebrate it in some very pathetic form hey here's a gift for you open it here I bought you something that's halit style yeah we just choose to use the same season that the world does but H forget this other stuff here's a gift and you hold this little gift it's about this big and you're like let's see I I have I have telepathy it will be a $50 DNB gift card just like it's been for the last 25 years that's what we do around our house amen now look my brother and sister when God starts to work he knows exactly how to connect to you amen he doesn't need to connect to me to connect to you he wants you to connect to him and he wants you to recognize it's you and him okay let me hurry now remember you guys loaned brother Craig a total of 21 minutes so we're here to ask for the same privilege see intellectual understanding will never hold this will it Saints I mean we can read look I think it's good I'm not down on intellectuals to be honest with you I can take you right in the message see where B talks about it but my brother and sister intellectuals you need to understand what you're reading or hearing amen but you see it will never hold you we can quote every quote now I hope you guys don't I I don't want to spoil any nice atmosphere but I know many people who have quit the message and they're when I say quit they quit quit I mean they're they're just went out they can still to this day tell you what sermon brother brandham said what but it doesn't have an effect on their life amen they can quote the message but they don't even want to live it that's right intellectual I'd rather be one of them spitting sputtering whatever guys that messes up his words once in a while and by God's grace amen know this is truth hallelujah and then I want to flip to the other side there's many a man out here in this world I could take you today except for I wouldn't mess up your time or his I can introduce you to them not even sure if there is a God and they have Flawless family you won't find one flaw in their family you say how can that be well the devil's got nothing to fight him for they don't even believe there's a God I'll just go ahead and flesh that one out if you don't mind got grown sons and their dad will say son I see a little something just like it happened when you were kids happening with your kids and their son will say thank you Dad I'll get right on it no argument about the deal no argument about who's right and who's wrong they have that much of a surrendered atmosphere to their own natural Father Dad is there a god I don't think there is son okay there's no God aren't you glad I'd rather come on put up with me Saints I'd rather have all kinds of fussing with my children I'd rather have the devil knocking on the door scratching the screen and have something that when you're her daughter says is God real mom and dad you can say I know my redeemer liveth I know it's real amen oh you can take peace and say that's what we're looking for or you can take the word and draw your sword and fight the devil amen but you can't have both amen look at this oh I never confirmed did you loan me the 21 minutes no okay I'll repent afterwards I'm going to steal the 21 minutes now listen talk about how God works look at the woman at the well for just a few minutes the woman at the well is there she's drawing water and here's Jesus he starts to deal with her had five wives and a husband I mean Five Wives wow I'm slipping maybe it's time to quit she she was she was there and when Jesus starts to deal with her she doesn't say that's that's wrong or that's not she knew the word she knew the prophecy for the day she knew this but it didn't change her life she was in that position and she recognized when Jesus spoke and said ah we know this is what we've been taught didn't change her life she'd been taught a lot didn't impact her life you see teaching is not going to do it it takes a living word amen and if it's not a living word you can teach the fire out of it it won't make one drop a difference right amen hallelujah so here she knew the scripture but it didn't change her but what happened is is Jesus starts to deal with her and she recognized how Satan had tricked her she realized this is what Satan's done he's pulled the wool over my eyes and the whole time the very thing I desired was not to be found in another man another relationship it was to be found in Christ and it was such a real Revelation that hit her why because it was a living word that she come in contact with not a dead letter some people have a stroke around the message if you said this message is a dead letter but I'll tell you my brother and sister you could go to bed every night with books piled on you and it won't change your life it's going to come off the page it's going to come into the heart it's got to come down into the soul and it's got to not just touch the soul amen that's that just anointing that's there but doesn't change them it's got to embed itself right amen a pregnancy requires a seed to be embedded amen and when it's embedded in there amen the prophet of God says nothing can take that away Hallelujah and so why she recognized by Revelation that this was the word speaking to me and goes into the City and says hey everybody there's one who told me the word amen told me who I am he didn't say called me a prostitute she said he told me who I am oh thank you Lord thank you Lord amen you see revealing the word for the age for the individual come on are you with me today the word was not revealed to you so you sit in Grace's Tabernacle and identify ify as a message believer the word was revealed because of who you are amen who God called you to be is why the word was revealed and that's why you can believe it now let's let me hurry here because it was only 50/50 on me going a little longer so I I got to be careful here Amen brother Brown says now this quote and I'm just going to try and preach this without a whole lot of extras it was in that great hour it was in that great moment it was a time when God took job to the sacred Sands where he takes every believer amen amen to an experience and to the backside of a desert hey you may never ever even walk in a desert ever in your life but you'll go visit the backside of one amen God will take you there like he did Moses and little secret closet that's right where he took you into a Coal Shed where I received it God has a place and a purpose and a time and when he had job in this condition and someone we love very much said wowy wowy Woo I don't want to be here h i take great joy in one time in my life that I could correct brother juel brother juel says I am not going to pray for patience and I got to say but brother Jewel I have word that says God's going to try you to patience anyhow be quiet Paul might as well pray for it okay I'm trying to set you up please fall for the punchline who wants to visit the backside of the desert My Flesh doesn't want to but something inside of me says Lord you told me by the word that I am perfect amen perfect me Lord amen perfect me amen right sacred Sands are going to reveal something to him that would never go away isn't that awesome yeah that's what I want Lord for those sacred Sands he has to take every real child there he gets you on those places where there is no devil can ever come H that's pretty far out

rambunctious a little bit wild he say dad had take him out in the back porch and whip him in the name of the Lord Oh my he said at that time he said it made me not like the Lord but over time I real realiz what my daddy was trying to do amen okay every True Believer has that spot where God has met him there isn't one left out so just plan on it young people plan on a trip to the desert because God's not going to leave you out amen God wants youen amen and he gets what he wants every believer has it every person that's born of the king kingdom of God knows that spot that minute that hour where God took him and on those sacred Sands in the presence of the burning bush he did something to that believer that all the mentality of the world could not destroy Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not destroy Upon This Rock the spiritual revelation of a resurrected Jesus Upon This Rock job in his distress everything gone his wife had turned against him and was accusing him you know she was accusing him she thought he had the ability to curse God she was herself in a position saying you can curse God but what she didn't know is it wasn't in job at all he could not do it hallelujah amen and all these be wo is this getting too close F friends maybe somebody else brother Trevor maybe you could read that I'm just not sure I want to be guilty of talking about Believers turning against each other against because they only theology all the rest against so do you just want the message or do you want something deeper I want something that won't allow me to turn against my brother I want something that won't allow me to turn against the message turn against the word of God I want something that will hold me right in the place God called me to can we say Amen to that Hallelujah please change that if you would but God said come here job I'm going to give you something boy I'm going to a place uh uh I'm going to a place within you that's right

identity and body let them choose young people all speak to you kind of direct here God's the one who does the choosing not Le oia amen not Spirits not demons walking in the bodies of entertainments

his presence is real I I tell you Saints I I don't want to drag it out I won't go into it but I tell you i' I've just got to see God come on the scene in just the last few days again and again and again I don't it sound super spiritual because I think some of those prayers when I asked probably sounded more like a whne come on let's be honest but he answered [Music] anyhow might have been a Quaver in my voice I might have been just feeling overwhelmed might have felt like just throwing my hands up in [Music] despair but you say Lord I need you I need you and it changes and you know that prayer traveled a million miles or did it do you realize my brother and sister while we're not a prophet the angel of the Lord stood right there with the prophet and those promises to the prophet are with us the angel of the Lord is standing right here with each one of us today amen leading us guiding us directing us encouraging us and correcting us when we need it amen Can someone say thank you
