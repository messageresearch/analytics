[32:32] this morning for you to speak to us we
[32:35] ask in jesus name
[32:40] amen let's stand to our feet
[33:02] so we're gonna read from mark chapter
[33:04] four
[33:21] i believe it's been said already but we
[33:23] want to just
[33:24] say it again that our
[33:26] thoughts and our prayers are with
[33:28] the hayley family paul and jerry each
[33:30] one
[33:32] this morning
[33:34] amen mark chapter 4
[33:36] verse 35.
[33:39] and the same day when the even was come
[33:41] he saith unto them let us pass over unto
[33:43] the other side
[33:45] when they had sent away
[33:47] the multitude
[33:49] they took him even as he was in the ship
[33:53] and there were also with him other
[33:55] little ships and there was a great storm
[33:57] of wind and the waves beat into the ship
[33:59] so that it was now full
[34:02] and he was in the hinder part of the
[34:03] ship asleep on a pillow and they awake
[34:06] him and say unto him master carest thou
[34:08] not that we perish
[34:10] and he arose and rebuked the wind and
[34:13] said under the sea peace be still and
[34:15] the wind ceased and there was a great
[34:17] calm
[34:21] joel 2 25 says and i will restore to you
[34:24] the years that the locust hath eaten the
[34:27] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[34:29] palmer worm
[34:30] my great army which i sent among you may
[34:33] the lord have a blessing to the reading
[34:34] of his word can be seated this morning
[34:46] so my title this morning i'm just going
[34:48] to back up a couple of slides so you can
[34:49] see it
[34:50] is uh after the storm
[34:53] and the subtitle is our restore
[34:55] saith the lord
[35:02] so
[35:04] i have one more scripture here
[35:07] okay we'll get to it so so storms
[35:09] inspire faith in us
[35:12] job 19 verse 23-25
[35:16] says oh that my words were now written
[35:19] oh that they were
[35:21] printed in a book
[35:22] that they were graven with an iron pen
[35:25] and lead in the rock forever
[35:27] for i know that my redeemer liveth
[35:30] and that he shall stand at the latter
[35:32] day upon the earth
[35:35] and um
[35:36] i i
[35:38] this is a sermon that i
[35:40] kind of pulled from the archives
[35:43] and the original inspiration was
[35:46] if you look at
[35:48] the weather around you
[35:50] or you look at the clouds
[35:52] now you can't have
[35:54] clouds without there being some kind of
[35:56] storm coming whether that's just a light
[35:58] rain
[35:59] or
[36:00] in any or any anything similar to that
[36:02] and and there's so much more definition
[36:05] in the sky
[36:07] the sun sets prettier when you have
[36:09] clouds for the sun to bounce off of
[36:13] there's a sweet smell of rain in the air
[36:15] after a storm
[36:16] and um
[36:18] the clouds give this guy definition and
[36:20] it's it's just beautiful and as the per
[36:22] individual
[36:24] that's one of my favorite times and it's
[36:25] actually a great time to catch fish too
[36:28] um but
[36:30] it's just a fresh air and and uh with
[36:33] without that storm there wouldn't have
[36:36] been that fresh
[36:38] smell of rain there wouldn't be the the
[36:40] the flowers blooming on the cactus in
[36:42] the deserts there wouldn't have been
[36:44] life coming forth from the earth
[36:46] or that sweet atmosphere or that beauty
[36:49] in the sky
[36:51] and so begin to think about
[36:53] this thing and
[36:54] and um
[36:56] you know in the storm
[36:58] the lord speaks
[37:00] in the storm the lord protects us
[37:04] and in the storm psalm 17 8 says keep me
[37:07] as the apple of the eye
[37:09] hide me under the shadow of thy wings
[37:13] so in the storm we're hidden under the
[37:16] wings of jehovah and we sing that song
[37:19] and
[37:20] perfectly lines up with this is that the
[37:22] jehovah shama you know jehovah rapha all
[37:25] the the seven redemptive names of
[37:27] jehovah are exactly what we need
[37:30] when we're going through a storm and
[37:31] it's it's more than enough it's more
[37:34] than we need
[37:35] and
[37:36] that's kind of hard to
[37:39] to grasp
[37:40] sometimes in the storm
[37:43] because it's very loud it's
[37:45] very wet
[37:48] it's dangerous
[37:49] in some situations but
[37:53] i don't want to focus on the storm
[37:55] because
[37:56] many times the lord
[37:58] he gives us he gives us things he gives
[38:00] us gifts in certain seasons and and um
[38:03] those those seasons that we go through
[38:07] we all we always go through something
[38:09] um
[38:13] we always go through something because
[38:15] the lord's trying to give us something
[38:17] we had it on the side i know if it's
[38:18] still there but character is a victory
[38:21] not a gift
[38:22] and so
[38:23] uh someone can can stand up here and and
[38:26] say you know say those words but when
[38:28] you're living them it's a totally
[38:30] different story um we can talk about you
[38:33] know oh you know that storm
[38:34] i was in out on the mountainside hunting
[38:37] and it was crazy it was life-threatening
[38:39] and everything but you're standing there
[38:41] okay telling somebody and that person's
[38:44] going oh wow you know they're not really
[38:45] affected because they weren't in the
[38:47] storm um but there's one thing we know
[38:50] about christ and that and that his
[38:52] mission
[38:53] here when he came down and walked the
[38:55] shores of galilee his mission was to
[38:57] bring us
[38:59] full redemption
[39:01] while he did that his mission as well
[39:04] was to experience everything we
[39:07] experience when we go through something
[39:10] and we and and we read this scripture in
[39:12] in mark and and and
[39:15] every scripture there's many different
[39:17] angles and things you can bring from it
[39:18] because it's god's eternal word it means
[39:21] one thing in one season to you and it
[39:22] means something totally different in
[39:24] another season to you and so when you
[39:26] when we read this story many times we
[39:28] continue through verse 40 and 41 and we
[39:32] talk about the lack of faith in the
[39:34] disciples but i want to focus on the
[39:36] ending of the story in verse 39 where
[39:39] god even then the lack of their faith
[39:42] god stands and calms the storm he
[39:45] doesn't get up in the middle of the
[39:46] storm and start to rebuke them the first
[39:49] thing he does when they call out for
[39:51] help in the storm is he stands and
[39:54] speaks to the storm and there's a great
[39:56] lesson we can take from that for for our
[39:58] own situations dealing with people in
[40:00] our own lives um always be quick to be
[40:04] in the will of god and the will of god
[40:06] in that time was for jesus to stand up
[40:08] in the boat and speak to the storm that
[40:11] peace would come and then it was after
[40:14] that that christ gave instructions to
[40:16] the disciples but
[40:18] when the storm was happening all around
[40:20] the disciples and they were afraid
[40:24] the lord rises up
[40:26] and he speaks peace to the storm now in
[40:28] order to focus on our topic which is
[40:31] after the storm we have to address the
[40:33] storm so we're getting there
[40:36] praise the lord so the disciples
[40:38] probably are asking themselves
[40:40] um why why the storm but jesus is in the
[40:43] boat
[40:45] wireless storm
[40:47] guess what jesus is always in the boat
[40:51] as long as you're in the will of god
[40:52] jesus is always in the boat so why the
[40:55] storm you would think that that would be
[40:57] a protection against everything about
[40:58] you nothing would happen so why the
[41:00] storm and um
[41:03] but the we'll get to a quote here in a
[41:04] little bit the the the reason for storms
[41:07] there's many reasons
[41:08] the bottom line is that god is building
[41:10] our character god is is working within
[41:13] us and and so the right the the reason
[41:17] of a storm in this scenario here was the
[41:20] writing of a testimony
[41:22] the writing of the testimony that the
[41:23] disciples could then go forth and preach
[41:26] hey it doesn't matter when you're in the
[41:28] storm god's in the boat he'll speak to
[41:30] that storm and bring peace you just have
[41:32] to have faith so a lesson was taught and
[41:35] the testimony was written for them and
[41:38] for us today and down through time when
[41:40] the scripture has been preached on
[41:43] and so um
[41:44] brother barum says in in the the sermon
[41:46] at thy word 1948
[41:49] he says then when he come out there to
[41:51] the side of the mount isn't that
[41:53] something i believe the apostle said
[41:55] that our trials are better than gold to
[41:58] us
[41:59] think of it god might have let you get
[42:02] sick in order that you might be a
[42:04] testimony what is the purpose of your
[42:06] creation for god to be glorified he
[42:08] needed the attributes of a savior so he
[42:11] needed he needed to to he needed you to
[42:14] fulfill those attributes he needed the
[42:15] attribute he wanted to fulfill the
[42:17] attributes of the healers or he created
[42:18] you he needed to be god so he created
[42:21] you to worship him so you and christ i
[42:24] mean you are the perfection if you will
[42:26] bold statement you are the perfection of
[42:28] christ because he needs you
[42:30] amen but we need him and it's the
[42:32] paradox of the relationship of god but
[42:35] in our trials are better than gold to us
[42:38] think of it god might have let you get
[42:39] sick in order that you might be a
[42:41] testimony that he might heal you that
[42:44] you can stand on his word i said it once
[42:46] before we need to stop asking why and
[42:48] ask how god can't glorify you in this
[42:52] situation now why is this happening to
[42:54] me but how can i glorify you in this
[42:57] situation how can i worship you because
[43:00] that's the end goal amen and i i cut a
[43:03] little bit out i didn't cherry pick i
[43:04] just cut a section of the story out
[43:06] there's a long quote he goes on to say a
[43:08] little bit later now isn't that a
[43:10] thought to think of now sister you're
[43:12] sitting there with the blinded eyes with
[43:13] the glasses on probably bad eyes or you
[43:16] wouldn't even have the glasses now isn't
[43:18] that something
[43:21] to know that god let that sight get in
[43:24] that condition that he might give a
[43:26] testimony
[43:28] isn't it wonderful that we would know
[43:30] that he come up why is he blind and they
[43:33] said whose sin he or his father now he's
[43:35] talking about the story of the blind man
[43:37] that he healed he put mud on his eyes
[43:39] and he said go wash in the pool and he
[43:41] goes and washes in the pool and then the
[43:42] the
[43:44] religious leaders pull him aside and
[43:46] they
[43:46] interrogating him
[43:48] never once glorifying god for his
[43:50] healing
[43:51] but
[43:52] interrogating him and then they asked
[43:54] jesus the question you know um
[43:57] the people there well who who who and i
[43:59] may have the wrong blind man story you
[44:01] forgive me if i do but
[44:03] a blind man's eyes are open and they're
[44:04] asking why was he blind
[44:07] because of the old testament you know
[44:09] was was it a curse
[44:10] on him from his family
[44:13] and he says no it's it's none of that
[44:16] it's simply that god may be glorified
[44:19] and he said this case neither but that
[44:21] the works of god might be done
[44:24] god wanted some witnesses now he sent
[44:26] his gift of healing to heal you that you
[44:29] would go out and be a witness then stand
[44:32] the test of faith
[44:35] praise the lord
[44:37] to testify of his grace
[44:41] amen to come forth like gold tried in
[44:43] the fire
[44:52] there's little comfort in growth
[44:54] and little excuse me there's little
[44:57] growth in comfort
[44:59] and little comfort and growth
[45:01] the storm is not comfortable
[45:04] um the storm is not picture perfect the
[45:06] storm isn't exactly textbook um the
[45:09] storms can change directions you see if
[45:11] you you read any kind of history of
[45:13] storms or train tornadoes you know it's
[45:15] going to go this way and it just turns
[45:17] and goes the other direction storms are
[45:19] unpredictable
[45:21] you know they say there's 70 70 chance
[45:24] of rain in an hour and an hour it's blue
[45:26] skies
[45:29] or they say there's
[45:30] a light chance of rain with with clear
[45:32] skies and it's uh the biggest
[45:33] thunderstorm you ever seen
[45:35] so they're unpredictable
[45:37] see uh people can can stand and try to
[45:40] try to to to tell you and try to confine
[45:43] god to a box
[45:45] and um
[45:47] try to to to to
[45:49] say oh it's this situation and when this
[45:51] happens it's this situation but then
[45:53] something happens in their life that's
[45:55] if you will outside of the box
[45:58] because it's not about a prescription
[46:00] it's not about a textbook it's about the
[46:02] revelation of christ and with that
[46:04] revelation comes the strength for those
[46:07] things outside of the box for those
[46:09] things that are different for those
[46:10] things that we don't fully understand
[46:12] ourselves but god is the author and
[46:15] finisher of our faith and he's the
[46:18] author of every circumstance that we
[46:20] experience as christians amen and the
[46:23] one thing that we can always know about
[46:25] the storms we go through that we will
[46:27] come forth like gold tried in the fire
[46:31] praise the lord but now like i said my
[46:34] title this morning was after the storm
[46:38] um i
[46:39] hope you can see that well it's just a
[46:41] beautiful picture and
[46:44] on this side of the clouds there is no
[46:46] storm
[46:47] we're enjoying the beauty of the storm
[46:49] so there is beauty in the storm there's
[46:52] beauty after the storm there isn't much
[46:54] to to uh let's be real this morning it's
[46:57] hard to be thankful in the storm it's
[46:59] hard to to always know exactly what
[47:01] god's doing or what's happening but yeah
[47:04] but once we come to the other side after
[47:06] the storm you see for a believer there
[47:08] is always hope
[47:10] before a christian there is always hope
[47:13] amen and it's not the storm this and the
[47:15] storm and the storm and the storm and
[47:17] the storm we can preach about the storm
[47:19] and the storm of the storm but guess
[47:20] what what is after that and then what is
[47:24] the victory i mean because you keep your
[47:26] eyes on victory there was a young boy
[47:28] who will rode his bike across the plank
[47:30] we all know the i'm very familiar with
[47:32] the story why did he win against
[47:35] everybody else his eyes were on the
[47:37] victory
[47:39] amen and as believers
[47:41] our eyes sometimes get off the victory
[47:43] now the scripture says i pressed towards
[47:45] the mark of the high calling in christ
[47:47] jesus amen our eyes are on the end of
[47:50] the goal our eyes are forward to our
[47:53] deliverance
[47:56] and uh praise the lord
[47:58] so
[47:59] following the storm um in the story that
[48:02] we read of the disciples
[48:06] the disciples were out on the sea
[48:09] and uh they went through a storm
[48:11] but if you continue reading on there's a
[48:14] story in the next chapter
[48:16] and there was a man plagued with demons
[48:22] mark 5 15
[48:24] and they come to jesus and see him that
[48:27] was possessed with the devil and had the
[48:29] legion sitting and clothed and in his
[48:31] right mind and they were afraid
[48:34] my orders messed up but
[48:37] after the storm
[48:39] came deliverance
[48:43] god brought those disciples through that
[48:46] storm but they were on their way
[48:49] to an appointment with destiny
[48:51] they were on their way to an appointment
[48:53] that had been in the book since before
[48:55] the foundation of the world
[48:57] before there was ever
[49:00] a son before there was ever stars in the
[49:02] sky before there ever was the green
[49:05] fields of pasture upon the earth before
[49:07] there was anything that testified to
[49:10] life there was an appointment said in
[49:11] the books
[49:13] an appointment with the man of galeria
[49:16] amen a man that had that had that had
[49:18] become a maniac become bound by demons
[49:22] bound by spirits amen brought down and i
[49:25] wish i could remember what brother
[49:27] branham says as the cause of that um but
[49:30] the situations in his life that brought
[49:32] him to a point where now he was bound
[49:34] and needed deliverance
[49:36] but on the way there to the deliverance
[49:40] amen god brought his disciples to the
[49:42] storm now
[49:44] did that boost their faith for that
[49:46] appointment absolutely
[49:48] it boosted their faith you know perhaps
[49:51] god was
[49:52] when he was laying out the books of time
[49:54] and and everything that would happen he
[49:55] said you know i mean i need my disciples
[49:57] to have that boost of faith to be with
[49:59] me when this happens and so i'm going to
[50:02] take them through this storm you see god
[50:05] always knows exactly what's going on
[50:07] around us and he was already there he
[50:10] already wrote it down he already
[50:12] addressed the situation and then he gave
[50:14] us everything that we could possibly
[50:16] need he gave us more than that amen just
[50:19] in case if you will just to cover the
[50:21] margin amen but god is is always present
[50:24] and so after the storm
[50:26] god brought deliverance amen and if
[50:29] there isn't a more classic or more or
[50:31] more um
[50:32] a better example of a storm it's it's
[50:34] the life of job
[50:36] but we that's a it's a long book and i
[50:38] can't read the whole book this morning
[50:39] but but job experienced great tragedy in
[50:42] his life job lost everything that that
[50:45] was dear to him he lost everything that
[50:47] was
[50:48] his business and all these things and it
[50:50] was just an absolute
[50:52] storm um one of those storms where it's
[50:55] the middle of the day but it's almost
[50:57] pitch black
[50:59] and um
[51:00] the thing about the thing about the lord
[51:02] is is is uh
[51:04] he's not gonna rate this storm is worse
[51:06] than this storm we do that
[51:09] we do that
[51:11] god just calls them storms
[51:14] and god says
[51:16] this measure of faith i've given to him
[51:18] and this measure of faith i've given to
[51:20] them every storm is just god working in
[51:25] us amen
[51:26] working on us
[51:29] but if you get to the end of the story
[51:30] of job job 42 10 and the lord turned the
[51:33] captivity of job when he prayed for his
[51:36] friends also the lord gave job twice as
[51:37] much as he had before so is the point of
[51:40] storms for us to just get more stuff
[51:44] absolutely not if you think that
[51:48] you're going to go through a storm that
[51:49] takes all your stuff
[51:53] and then i don't know god will just deal
[51:55] with that
[51:58] you see
[52:01] sometimes we as because we're human we
[52:04] can we can hear somebody talk
[52:06] and we can think we can be convinced
[52:09] but god knows the very thoughts and
[52:12] intents
[52:13] of the heart amen see that's why he
[52:16] doesn't look at this
[52:17] he looks at the heart
[52:19] thank goodness because we say some
[52:20] pretty dumb things
[52:22] but when a person's intent is for that
[52:25] lamborghini
[52:27] or whatever it is god sees that in their
[52:30] heart
[52:30] and if they're a child of god he will
[52:32] address that
[52:34] so you can't fool god
[52:37] you can fool me
[52:40] you can be fooled
[52:42] but you can't fool god
[52:46] god knows exactly what's going on the
[52:48] restoration of the bride tree
[52:51] brother branham says but it's in that in
[52:53] the um the top part where i will restore
[52:57] saith the lord i will i'll send forth
[52:59] the evening light
[53:03] it'll bring back bring back the word
[53:05] make it manifest i will restore all that
[53:07] i promise all that i promise the same
[53:10] holy spirit will bring
[53:12] bear the same signs
[53:15] i'll have an easter a resurrection for
[53:17] the bride just same as i had for the
[53:20] bridegroom see evening lights come out
[53:22] to shine same as in the morning same
[53:25] signs
[53:26] same things the same light will produce
[53:28] the same fruit
[53:30] that they had there if it's shining on
[53:32] the same tree amen proves his word now
[53:35] fulfilled i will restore
[53:38] saith the lord amen what christ does for
[53:41] the bride as a whole he has to do for
[53:44] each individual
[53:46] each individual makes up the bride of
[53:48] christ and so if god has a mission if
[53:51] god has a calling to bring the bride to
[53:53] a position amen for the catching away
[53:56] for the rapture god has to work with
[53:59] each individual because the bride is a
[54:01] multi-member body you can't you can't he
[54:04] can't do it on the whole without doing
[54:06] it to the part and so i just think it's
[54:08] beautiful you take you take the the the
[54:11] progression of the church ages and you
[54:14] look at the beginning we had the word we
[54:16] had the life but then that life went
[54:19] down amen it fell down the sea went down
[54:22] into the ground for the dark ages even
[54:24] but god began to bring that forth and we
[54:27] see that the the scripture that we read
[54:29] the beginning in joel and and and and
[54:32] the testifying of the returning of the
[54:35] restoration
[54:36] not replacing the restoration of the
[54:39] word and so therefore we can look at the
[54:42] bride and we can begin to talk about you
[54:44] know how god's going has god how how god
[54:47] has brought the open word god has
[54:49] brought the
[54:50] full manifestation of redemption to the
[54:53] bride to bring her to that position for
[54:56] departure amen
[54:59] god has had has taken
[55:03] but at the same time now god has taken
[55:05] each one of us
[55:07] and we're going through a progression of
[55:09] our own ages
[55:13] you could apply that to the the number
[55:14] of years but that's not how god works
[55:17] because what about those he calls home
[55:18] at 25. or 15
[55:21] right but we all have a progression just
[55:23] like just like the bride progressing
[55:25] through those church ages i mean just
[55:27] like the word progressing god's word is
[55:29] progressing in all in inside of each one
[55:32] of us and working on us amen and so we
[55:36] go through dark ages sometimes and then
[55:39] we're storms we go through those storms
[55:42] but god is is bringing us down because
[55:45] when when when things are are pushed
[55:48] aside and and when there's a distress
[55:51] image it brings us into this this
[55:53] condition of our heart where we're just
[55:55] soft and and we don't have to
[55:57] necessarily be totally distressed but
[56:00] but we're we're in this place where
[56:01] we're where the the clay has as if you
[56:05] will maybe been smashed down a little
[56:06] bit
[56:07] and and and we're soft
[56:10] we're soft because our our emotions and
[56:12] our and what we're going through
[56:14] immensely as god can can deal with us
[56:16] when we're tired
[56:19] and and and and god just knows how to
[56:21] bring us into these these seasons
[56:24] because
[56:25] well what makes the cactus bloom what
[56:28] makes the cactus soft the storm
[56:32] it's a storm all that rain
[56:34] all that rain coming down what what what
[56:36] what burns off the um you know when the
[56:39] forest gets too full of brush you know
[56:42] we live close to the forest so we have
[56:45] to control forest fires but um
[56:48] the when the forest gets too thick with
[56:50] the brush the fires come through it and
[56:52] clean it out
[56:54] then new life comes from that so it's
[56:56] just it's it's in it's in nature it's in
[56:59] the bible
[57:01] it's in history where god has has this
[57:03] this cycle of of the storms and the
[57:06] whole purpose is not the storm
[57:09] the whole purpose is not the the
[57:11] tribulation that's why you know uh
[57:13] sometimes um
[57:16] people have misunderstandings of of uh
[57:20] that we go we we build character going
[57:23] through the things we suffer
[57:25] and they stayed down in that suffering
[57:29] they wallowed down there
[57:32] i'm not trying to say anybody to
[57:34] anything to anybody directly this
[57:35] morning
[57:36] they wallow down in the in the mire and
[57:39] in the mud and i've talked to them and
[57:40] you can feel the
[57:42] it just oozing off of them
[57:46] and
[57:48] that's not where that quote and those
[57:50] scriptures end
[57:52] it's not suff we're not called to suffer
[57:55] you're not necessarily called to just be
[57:57] dirt poor your entire life
[58:00] are you dirt poor because god's called
[58:02] you to if you are guess what
[58:04] you'll be so positive about the five
[58:06] dollars you have in your account
[58:08] you'll not be talking about how poor you
[58:10] are
[58:12] if you're down in a trial and you're
[58:14] suffering you're not going to be talking
[58:16] about constantly how oh
[58:19] you know and that's all you ever talk
[58:21] about and people
[58:24] will help us to be patient with our
[58:25] brothers and sisters
[58:27] but that's not what we're called you're
[58:29] not called to stay there if we were we
[58:31] wouldn't be singing about how god
[58:33] brought us from the mirey clay we
[58:36] wouldn't we would be singing about jesus
[58:38] still in the grave
[58:39] you understand redemption story down
[58:41] through the ages applies to your life
[58:45] redemption
[58:46] restoration
[58:47] after the storm i will restore saith the
[58:51] lord
[58:52] i will restore it's a restoration what
[58:54] is restoration because we have
[58:56] replacement
[58:57] which means we we just pushed that away
[59:00] we got a brand new thing but the bible
[59:02] says restoration
[59:04] what is restoration
[59:06] rising from the ashes
[59:08] the underdog
[59:10] the story of david and goliath the story
[59:12] of israel restoration the story of david
[59:14] and bathsheba restoration
[59:17] the story of of gideon and and and the
[59:20] restoration of the children of israel
[59:22] the story of us and our restoration
[59:25] through redemption you see the entire
[59:27] you can go in the message and search
[59:29] this and you will find it time and time
[59:31] again the entire purpose of christ is
[59:34] the is the purpose of redemption
[59:37] and if that is true for our if you will
[59:41] doctrine what we believe then that same
[59:45] thing it's not just oh lord help me to
[59:47] say this it's not just like um this is
[59:49] the word
[59:51] okay and then this is us
[59:54] and somehow there's a separation oh we
[59:56] the deep things and oh that preacher
[59:58] doesn't preach deep enough um
[1:00:00] i'm sorry but that those deep things
[1:00:03] have to connect
[1:00:04] to us
[1:00:06] if it doesn't loop back to your personal
[1:00:09] story there's a connection that wasn't
[1:00:12] made
[1:00:13] there's a wire that's not hooked up
[1:00:15] because there's no power
[1:00:17] if you don't have power in your life
[1:00:19] there's a wire that's disconnected
[1:00:22] you say well how did that wire
[1:00:23] disconnected i don't know
[1:00:25] if you don't know ask god to show you
[1:00:28] where there's a disconnection in your
[1:00:30] because guess what there's power
[1:00:34] every house out there on the street
[1:00:35] that's hooked to the city of napa has
[1:00:37] power
[1:00:38] and if there's a plug in your house
[1:00:39] that's not working it ain't because the
[1:00:42] city of napa failed is because there's a
[1:00:44] connection missing in your in in the in
[1:00:47] the wires to give that plug power
[1:00:50] so if you're down and suffering and
[1:00:52] you're wallowing in the mud and that's
[1:00:53] all you
[1:00:54] do there's power missing
[1:00:58] there's a disconnect those disconnects
[1:01:00] can come from hurt that we experience as
[1:01:03] human beings that disconnect can come
[1:01:05] from from from depression or anxiety
[1:01:08] there can be a disconnect but
[1:01:11] god is the great connector
[1:01:14] amen when there's a problem in your
[1:01:15] house and you can't figure out what's
[1:01:17] going on you call the electrician and he
[1:01:19] comes up and guess what
[1:01:23] he has all the tools
[1:01:26] he has all the tools it takes him about
[1:01:27] five minutes you spend two hours takes
[1:01:30] him about five minutes he just plugs it
[1:01:31] in
[1:01:32] goes the other end plugs it in
[1:01:34] okay then he works his way back all
[1:01:36] right you gotta disconnect here cuts the
[1:01:38] hole in the wall right there fix his
[1:01:39] head
[1:01:43] but god has called us to victory
[1:01:46] amen god has called us to find victory
[1:01:49] after the storm
[1:01:51] after the storm he brings us through
[1:01:53] look
[1:01:54] i love that i i feel bad because i keep
[1:01:56] bringing up getting it but i just love
[1:01:57] the story of guinea and i think in my
[1:01:58] season of life it kind of applies but
[1:02:02] and that's that's why but um the story
[1:02:04] of gideon
[1:02:07] israel was in trouble of their own doing
[1:02:11] they did it to themselves
[1:02:13] they started to worship idols and
[1:02:15] worship other gods
[1:02:16] in other words
[1:02:18] they stopped applying their time to
[1:02:22] their relationship with god
[1:02:24] because anything that takes you from
[1:02:26] your relationship with god has become an
[1:02:28] idol that's word that's in the message
[1:02:30] so they had turned from
[1:02:33] gideon himself had turned from the
[1:02:35] worship of god to the worship of his
[1:02:38] father's religion of a man-made religion
[1:02:42] but still god brought restoration
[1:02:46] god brought the man on the scene god
[1:02:48] brought what needed to be done to bring
[1:02:50] restoration even though israel put
[1:02:52] themselves in that position so in that
[1:02:54] suffering back to that amen god will
[1:02:57] send you what you need to bring you into
[1:03:00] victory to bring restoration because
[1:03:04] that's why is it restoration because
[1:03:06] that's not what that's not who you are
[1:03:09] that's not what you're called to be you
[1:03:12] say but that's who i am no it's not
[1:03:14] no it's not that's what the devil says
[1:03:17] about you
[1:03:18] if if i told you this this pulpit's
[1:03:21] green
[1:03:23] you'd laugh and say that man needs to be
[1:03:24] checked out
[1:03:27] i can't convince you this that this
[1:03:29] pulpit is green i'm lying to you
[1:03:33] the devil does the same thing he says
[1:03:34] your life is is is is hopeless
[1:03:38] but that's not what god sees god sees
[1:03:40] the pope that it is god sees your life
[1:03:42] for the color that it is your true
[1:03:45] colors
[1:03:46] amen
[1:03:48] your true colors are the colors of
[1:03:50] christ
[1:03:51] amen god is calling and and and that's
[1:03:53] not blasphemy because guess what brother
[1:03:55] branham says confess your healing
[1:04:00] work towards or imagine if you will that
[1:04:02] body that's perfectly healed and step
[1:04:06] into it
[1:04:07] that was some that was some bold stuff
[1:04:10] for the day he was in
[1:04:13] i mean it's still bold today
[1:04:15] people people want to get caught up in
[1:04:17] in in different things
[1:04:19] um
[1:04:20] well
[1:04:22] what i'm trying to say is
[1:04:24] that's faith
[1:04:26] the evidence of things not seen
[1:04:29] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:04:31] for the evidence of things not seen
[1:04:33] and then god on wednesday night we
[1:04:35] talked about the logos god in creation
[1:04:39] made what is now of what was not amen
[1:04:45] god is doing the same thing in our lives
[1:04:47] he is making what was
[1:04:49] what is now what is going to be
[1:04:52] what is the fulfillment of his word of
[1:04:55] things that are not amen you can't find
[1:04:59] christ you know in your flesh if you
[1:05:00] will
[1:05:02] but god is come and he's he's bringing
[1:05:06] you back excuse me he's bringing you
[1:05:08] back
[1:05:09] to your full restoration you're a new
[1:05:11] creature in christ jesus
[1:05:14] i hope that made sense i got a little
[1:05:15] bit jumbled up there but forgive me
[1:05:17] anyways
[1:05:19] god is bringing restoration so his
[1:05:21] restoration of the word
[1:05:24] brought resurrection
[1:05:26] to the people of god and down to the
[1:05:27] ages who were lacking victory so
[1:05:30] restoration the restoration that god is
[1:05:32] bringing
[1:05:34] brings us into our victory brings us
[1:05:37] through the storm the victory the
[1:05:39] disciples had in the ship on the sea of
[1:05:41] galilee over that storm amen for one was
[1:05:45] already there everything you need to
[1:05:47] overcome is already within you
[1:05:49] everything that you need to get to the
[1:05:51] place where you can talk about the storm
[1:05:53] that was is already packed inside of you
[1:05:56] is already down deep within you
[1:05:59] god is just
[1:06:00] it's just the logos is just brooding
[1:06:03] over you
[1:06:04] to unpack and unfold those potentials
[1:06:07] that you have you see when you keep your
[1:06:10] eyes on the goal
[1:06:11] your eyes of the oh keep your eyes on
[1:06:14] you as an overcomer get the eyes on you
[1:06:16] as victorious
[1:06:18] you're testifying in faith to what god
[1:06:22] has already put within you and god will
[1:06:25] recognize that faith and bring forth
[1:06:28] life on your behalf bring forth that
[1:06:32] victory amen it is not
[1:06:35] how does that scripture say
[1:06:38] it is not the word doesn't blasphemy but
[1:06:41] to say we are equal or abraham thought
[1:06:44] it not
[1:06:45] robbery to be equal with god
[1:06:47] in other words
[1:06:48] he had his eyes on the goal
[1:06:51] he had a revelation of the redemption
[1:06:53] story of jesus christ amen and that
[1:06:55] redemption story applies to each and
[1:06:57] every one of us in our life as a whole
[1:07:00] and in our life as seasons amen
[1:07:05] the palmer worm the caterpillar and the
[1:07:06] locust
[1:07:07] fed for age after age
[1:07:10] and then restoration was brought forth
[1:07:12] by the power of christ
[1:07:15] amen praise the lord you will have
[1:07:16] storms
[1:07:17] amen your boat will be rocked but
[1:07:21] it's after the storms that we have a
[1:07:23] revelation of grace
[1:07:32] a revelation of god's grace to you amen
[1:07:35] gives you
[1:07:36] the ability to apply grace to others
[1:07:42] also keeps you humble
[1:07:44] because you realize this would be
[1:07:46] nothing
[1:07:47] without the grace of god
[1:07:49] when you see that that that person
[1:07:52] displaying the demonic spirits that
[1:07:54] they're inhabited by
[1:07:56] when you see that person walking on the
[1:07:58] side of the street you don't go
[1:08:00] oh
[1:08:01] you go
[1:08:02] god give them grace god help them amen
[1:08:06] if it was not for the grace of god i
[1:08:08] would be there
[1:08:10] that's the revelation of grace sometimes
[1:08:12] storms we go through are just to remind
[1:08:15] us
[1:08:15] or give us a revelation of his grace and
[1:08:19] then a true restoration of an individual
[1:08:22] into the kingdom of christ
[1:08:24] brings with it a revelation of grace
[1:08:27] amen john newton wrote that song amazing
[1:08:29] grace why because of the storms
[1:08:32] that he went through
[1:08:33] and guess what
[1:08:36] that song came to him in the middle of a
[1:08:38] storm
[1:08:40] in the middle of a storm what was
[1:08:42] humming the tune
[1:08:44] there was a tune that that the slaves in
[1:08:46] the hold were humming
[1:08:48] he didn't know the words to they were
[1:08:49] they were they were there was this tomb
[1:08:52] and that's what he put the words to
[1:08:54] the very product of his sin
[1:08:58] the very product of his denial of christ
[1:09:02] brought the music
[1:09:05] of grace
[1:09:07] sometimes the very the very product of
[1:09:08] the children of israel in the time of
[1:09:10] gideon brought
[1:09:12] the music of god's grace brought forth
[1:09:15] the sound of god's deliverance but the
[1:09:17] bible says you want something that you
[1:09:20] need deliverance from god will deliver
[1:09:23] you from that and turn that into a
[1:09:25] testimony to help someone else
[1:09:28] saints of god there i am thoroughly
[1:09:30] convinced there is nothing as a child of
[1:09:32] god you can do amen that will break
[1:09:34] god's will for your life amen that's
[1:09:36] right he will bring you is there times
[1:09:38] or are we where we step out yes because
[1:09:40] we're human yes because we still have a
[1:09:42] choice but god's predestination for you
[1:09:45] is for you to walk in that position even
[1:09:48] as a child of god but john newton in his
[1:09:51] time of struggle amen came forth the
[1:09:54] song of grace came forth the sound of
[1:09:57] grace amen amen and that sound amen went
[1:10:00] and ultimately john newton gave his
[1:10:03] heart to god
[1:10:05] after some struggle isn't that true for
[1:10:07] some of us
[1:10:09] a school of hard knocks
[1:10:12] but there there again there again
[1:10:14] storms that god wants to bring us
[1:10:16] through because he wants us to be able
[1:10:18] to say to someone else
[1:10:20] but i've been there that's it
[1:10:23] i've been there
[1:10:24] not not in a bragging way we've never
[1:10:26] done that you know not like that
[1:10:28] but when when you've experienced
[1:10:30] something that someone you know is going
[1:10:32] through
[1:10:34] you can have heart
[1:10:35] what did brother better have to do when
[1:10:36] he lost the feeling for the people
[1:10:39] he had to go back and like say god
[1:10:41] give me the heart because yet you can't
[1:10:43] be affected without the heart for your
[1:10:45] brothers and sisters and that heart
[1:10:47] comes from a revelation of grace after
[1:10:49] the storm god brings peace
[1:10:52] amen after the storm god brings peace
[1:10:55] peace be still that same peace that
[1:10:57] caused the winds to cease
[1:10:59] and the storm to calm that same peace
[1:11:03] goes from a pla from being applied to
[1:11:05] the storm to being applied to you
[1:11:08] and god brings you peace god can bring
[1:11:10] you peace in the midst of the storm
[1:11:12] god giving you peace in the midst of the
[1:11:14] storm in the midst of what you're going
[1:11:16] through
[1:11:18] we
[1:11:19] praise the lord
[1:11:23] amen
[1:11:32] god
[1:11:33] god will prepare you for the storm
[1:11:35] that's right
[1:11:37] god will prepare you for the storm i
[1:11:38] remember an individual i won't use names
[1:11:41] an individual was speaking and and
[1:11:43] before they preached
[1:11:45] they were there was a song we were
[1:11:46] singing
[1:11:47] and they said let's sing it again and we
[1:11:50] sing it again then we sing it again and
[1:11:52] we sing it again almost like
[1:11:54] too many times but not you know what i'm
[1:11:56] saying like more than normal
[1:11:58] and it was that song
[1:12:00] peace of god
[1:12:02] cover me
[1:12:04] in the middle of their sermon
[1:12:07] their relative
[1:12:08] took their own life
[1:12:11] they went home to that
[1:12:13] but god in that moment right in that
[1:12:16] moment was washing over them with that
[1:12:18] song peace of god
[1:12:20] cover me
[1:12:21] preparations for the storm they were
[1:12:23] about to go through and they stand today
[1:12:25] testifying that they weathered that
[1:12:27] storm but you see god always prepares us
[1:12:31] the first time i i spoke this and and
[1:12:34] i'm not gonna i'm not gonna give excuses
[1:12:36] this is what god lead in my heart the
[1:12:37] first time that i spoke this there was a
[1:12:40] brother and a sister in in the in the
[1:12:41] church and she was sitting there
[1:12:43] thanking god for bringing her through
[1:12:45] all the storms that they had gone
[1:12:47] through and she felt like she was
[1:12:48] finally in the calm after the storm
[1:12:52] two days later her husband died of a
[1:12:54] major heart attack
[1:12:57] god preparing her
[1:13:00] for the storm
[1:13:03] even in the time where she was thanking
[1:13:04] god for bringing her through the storms
[1:13:06] and she felt like things were finally at
[1:13:08] peace
[1:13:10] two days later
[1:13:12] the world was turned upside down
[1:13:14] but god was preparing her for the storm
[1:13:17] what what is what what is the whole
[1:13:19] what's what why why after the storm
[1:13:21] brother chris you just keep talking
[1:13:23] about storms because that's what we have
[1:13:25] to look at amen
[1:13:26] that's what we have i'm not saying any
[1:13:28] of this in arrogance i've weathered some
[1:13:31] very difficult storms so i know what
[1:13:33] it's like to be in the i don't know
[1:13:36] every storm
[1:13:38] maybe i never will
[1:13:40] but in those storms
[1:13:42] it's let's be real it's not always like
[1:13:45] this
[1:13:46] we can just say oh i have faith no there
[1:13:49] are days where it just feels like i
[1:13:51] don't even know what i'm gonna do
[1:13:53] i don't know what i'm gonna do next i
[1:13:55] don't know i don't know
[1:13:57] but you still gotta go
[1:13:58] live your life you just want to sit down
[1:14:01] and and tune out but you can't
[1:14:04] you can't sometimes you have the
[1:14:06] opportunity to and you you should take
[1:14:08] those times to to let off the pressure
[1:14:11] but even in the midst of the pressure of
[1:14:13] the world you can let off the pressure
[1:14:14] in christ
[1:14:16] amen and god will give you the strength
[1:14:18] to look with eyes what is the anointing
[1:14:21] for the age that we live in it's the
[1:14:23] eagle anointing to see clearly
[1:14:25] to see they can fly above the storms
[1:14:28] they can see the other side of the storm
[1:14:31] god has given us the grace and the
[1:14:32] revelation to see through the storm the
[1:14:35] world around us the storm the storm
[1:14:37] that's never ending till god comes the
[1:14:39] storms in our life we can see by his
[1:14:42] anointing past that why why is it that
[1:14:45] you know that that song where paul and
[1:14:46] his family brother paula fontaine and
[1:14:48] his family wrote about are you she the
[1:14:51] bride of this last day
[1:14:53] right those those patriarchs of faith
[1:14:55] are going to be standing saying how did
[1:14:56] you do it
[1:14:59] how did you do the hardest age
[1:15:01] the hardest age how did you do it you
[1:15:04] know how you did it god anointed you to
[1:15:05] do it

[1:15:07] storm you're in today god's going to
[1:15:09] anoint you to do it you know how you're
[1:15:11] going to weather the storm that's coming
[1:15:13] up in front of you god's going to anoint
[1:15:14] you to do it
[1:15:17] amen and god has called us to look past
[1:15:20] amen look past onto the other side
[1:15:25] amen because the word of god will always
[1:15:27] stand true
[1:15:30] amen and remember storms always bring
[1:15:34] great deliverance
[1:15:36] amen amen so my prayer today and i'm
[1:15:40] i'm closing
[1:15:41] musicians want to come my prayer today
[1:15:44] for myself and for you as believers
[1:15:47] is that god will give us the grace
[1:15:50] to be able to say thank you for the
[1:15:53] storm
[1:15:55] thank you for the storm there's a song
[1:15:57] at brother uh john singh
[1:16:00] so thanks for the storm lord
[1:16:05] amen but i did i didn't get the music
[1:16:07] to that song
[1:16:11] i'm just gonna i'm gonna
[1:16:13] try to sing it acapella because i just
[1:16:15] feel led to you i'll blood trick but
[1:16:17] when the sun finally broke through the
[1:16:20] clouds
[1:16:21] i hadn't felt him for so long
[1:16:26] and i wondered why the storm
[1:16:29] what have i done wrong
[1:16:33] but he could see much further down the
[1:16:36] road
[1:16:37] i could have taken a wrong turn
[1:16:41] so he took the music from my song
[1:16:45] and he sent me a storm so thanks for the
[1:16:49] storm
[1:16:51] lord
[1:16:53] the pain
[1:16:54] makes me grow
[1:16:57] the wind he'll blow my pride away
[1:17:00] thunder and lightning
[1:17:02] made me pray
[1:17:04] [Music]
[1:17:05] it wasn't that i'd sinned
[1:17:09] or done somebody wrong
