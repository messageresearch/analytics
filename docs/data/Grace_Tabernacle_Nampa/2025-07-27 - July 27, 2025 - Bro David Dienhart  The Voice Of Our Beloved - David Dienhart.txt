TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Thank you. [Music] Jesus my redeemer. There is no more for heaven now to give. He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom. My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace. To this I hope my hope is only Jesus. For my life is holy bound to him. Oh, how strange and divine. I can sing. All is mine, yet not I, but through Christ in me. The night is dark, but I am not forsaken. For by my side, the Savior, he will stay. I labor on in weakness and rejoiceing. For in my need, his power is displayed. To this I hold. My shepherd will defend me. Deepest valley he will lead. [Music] Oh the night has been one. And I shall overcome yet not I but through Christ in me. No fate I dread. I know I am forgiven. The future sure the price it has been paid. For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon. And he was raised to overthrow the grave. To this I hope my sin has been defeated. [Music] Jesus now and ever is my plea. Oh the chains are released. I can sing I am free yet not I but through Christ in me with every breath I long to follow Jesus for he has said that he will bring me home and day a by day. I know he will renew me until I stand with joy before the throne. To this I hope my hope is only Jesus. All the gloryy ever more to him. [Music] When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat yet not I, but through Christ in me. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you this morning. It's good to have each one of you here. Amen. I'm going to have us stand. I was thinking of the words of this song this morning. Uh number 649 at the cross. I just sometimes words I don't love words. Words are interesting. But how last and did my savior bleed and did my sovereign die? Would he devote that sacred height? Such a worm. I love that word because it's so descriptive. Amen. What was it? I was a worm, man. Hallelujah. Amen. Alas, and did my savior bleed? And did my sovereign die? Could he devote that sacred head for such a worm as I? At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light and the burdens of my heart rolled away. It was there by faith I received my sight and now I am happy all the day. Was it for crimes that I have done? He groaned upon the tree. Amazing pity, grace unknown, and love beyond the degree. At the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the light and the burdens of my heart rolled away. There by faith I received my sight and now I am happy all the day. Well might the sun in darkness high and shut his glories in. And Christ the mighty maker died for man the creature sin. At the cross at the cross where I first saw the light and the burdens of my heart rolled away. It was there by faith I received my sight and now I am happy all the day. But drops of grief can never repay the debt of love I owe. Dear Lord, I give myself away is all that I can do. At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light and the burdens of my heart rolled away. It was there by faith. I received my sight and now I am happy all the day. Amen. Amen. Number 885. In Christ alone my hope is found. You can have your seats. I'm not going to keep you standing. I have to stand, but you guys can sit down. In Christ alone my hope is found. He is my light, my strength, my song. This corner stone, this solid ground, firm through the fiercest drought and storm. What heights of love? What depths of peace? When fears are still, when striving seed, my comforter, my all in all here in the love of Christ I stand. in Christ alone who took on flesh, fullness of God in helpless bab. This gift of love and righteousness [Music] scorned by the ones he came to save. Still on that cross as Jesus died, the wrath of God was satisfied for every sin. On him was laid. Here in the death of Christ I live. There in the ground his body lay, light of the world by darkness slain. Then bursting for glorious day up from the grave he rose again. And as he stands in victory, sin's curse has lost its grip on me. For I am him and he is mine, bought with the precious blood of Christ. No guilt in life, no fear in death. This is the power of Christ in me. From life's first cry till final breath. Jesus commands my destiny. No power of hell, no scheme of man can ever pluck me from his hand till he returns or calls me home. Here in the power of Christ I'll stand. Amen. Amen. I love that last part. No power of man or no scheme of man can ever pluck me from his hands. Praise God for that. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Um we haven't sang this song in a while. I just want to sing the chorus. Number 990. God with us. Just the chorus though. I'd tried the rest of it or sister Ruth and wasn't there. These words have just been echoed in my heart lately. All that is within me cries for you alone to be glorified. Praise God. Amen. All that is within me cry for you alone be glorified. Immanuel [Music] God with us. My heart it sings a brand new song. My debt is paid. These chains are gone. Emmanuel, God with love and all that is within me cry. For you alone be glorified. Emmanuel, God with all [Music] my heart it sings a brand new song. A man has played. These chains are gone. Emmanuel, God with us. [Music] More time. And all that is within me cries. For you alone be glorified. Emmanuel, God with all [Music] my heart. It sings a brand new song. My debt is paid. These chains are gone. Emmanuel, [Music] God with us. [Music] Amen. Amen. Is that what your heart's crying for this morning? For him to be glorified, be lifted up. Praise God. Amen. Let's just stand. I don't have any prayer requests written down this morning, but [Music] I remember our brother Paul over there in Monmouth speaking for the saints there. [Music] I want to remember um I think we talked about it on Wednesday night, my nephew Matthew. Amen. Just for Josiah and Michelle trying to decide how to handle this and some leadership in their lives. Amen. I know many others here, Gideon, Brother Trevor, Sister Carrie, your kids, others just they've been on my heart so much lately and just been praying for them. Amen. If you have a need this morning, lift your hands to him. [Music] He's already provided. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Gracious heavenly father, as we come before you this morning, Lord Jesus, Lord, how we love you, God is how those words have just echoed in my heart lately, Lord. All that is within me cries for you to be glorified, Lord Jesus. So, Lord, so we lift you up this morning, Lord. How thankful we are, Lord. not just another service, Lord God, but a another opportunity to come together and unite our hearts around your word and around you, Lord Jesus. That you would be praised, Lord God. That you would be glorified amongst us, Lord Jesus, in the singing and in the speaking of your word, Lord, that your saints, Lord Jesus, just come together, Lord, just lift you up this morning, Lord Jesus. So we thank you, Lord God. We thank you for your blessings unto us, Lord God. The love that you show us day in and day out, Lord Jesus, your mercy and your grace, Lord, how we love you, how we appreciate you, Lord Jesus. And Lord, as we've come before you this morning, we take these few things I've mentioned this morning, Lord God, the different ones, children, Lord, God, Lord, just pray that you just in each one of their lives, [Music] Lord, I know when I was younger and had these times, Lord Jesus, Lord, the first song we sang, such a worm as I it's pretty much the description I'd use, Lord Jesus. But Lord, you brought me out. You put me here today, Lord Jesus. And I believe that you will do the same for them. Though we don't see it with our eyes, Lord, you're working already. And I just pray in each one of these lives, Lord God, you'd come down and you'd touch that heart. Just draw them to you, Lord Jesus. We pray Lord if there's anything we can do Lord as a body as a family Lord God as brothers and sisters in Christ Lord Jesus just pray you put that on our heart Lord God lead us and as we've just the different ones brother Paul Lord Jesus not here with us this morning preaching over there in Monmouth I pray you'd be with him uh my dad up there in Tri Cities preaching Lord God st one others that aren't with us this morning Lord Jesus Lord, and every hand that's lifted this morning, you know, each life, each need, we commit it into your hands, Lord. There's nothing we can do. We have no no power, no way. Nothing we can do, Lord. But we just commit it into your hands, Lord Jesus. And pray, Lord, that you just the word that you've given us. You just that it would just rise up within our hearts and that faith, Lord God, that we would just walk in that in peace, Lord. So, we take this service this morning, Lord. Pray with our brother David as you would come and speak to us, Lord God. May you just speak to each heart, each life, each situation, Lord Jesus. I pray we would leave here closer to you. pray that you would we would leave here different. We dedicate this time and the service into your hands, Lord. Be with each one. May your Holy Spirit just move this morning, Lord. We pray. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. [Music] So, we ask our brother David to come this morning. Just want to sing that little uh chorus in his time. [Music] In his time. In his time. He makes all things beautiful in his time. Lord, please show me every day as you're teaching me your way that you do just what you say in your time. In his time. [Music] In his time [Music] he makes all things beautiful in his time. Lord, my life to you I bring. Each song I have to sing be to you a lovely thing in his time. In his time. [Music] In his time he makes all things beautiful in his time. Lord, please show me every day as you're teaching me your way that you do just what you say in your time. In his time. [Music] In his time he makes all things beautiful in his time. Lord to life to you I bring a song I have to sing. the lovely thing in his time. [Music] How many is willing to lay their life down and receive his word this morning? We must do that, shouldn't we? God help us. We haven't come here by chance. You may have thought, "I've come here, I'll do a duty. I come to church, that won't save you." you're here. Either you want more of him or you don't. And God's here to feed those that are hungry. [Music] So don't let the message, don't let the hour, not my what I'm saying, but the message of the hour, don't let it pass you by, go over your head. Don't make it so complicated that you miss it. It's simple. He hides in simplicity. He makes himself known in simplicity. Amen. Amen. So, we know that he's present. He's here. How many is willing to trust him? Say, "Lord, I'm believing that you can speak through a human clay vessel. What that clay vessel doesn't even know about, you can speak through it." Amen. Is that right? Are you expecting him to speak? I hope you're not expecting David to speak because my intellects wouldn't do any good in this. But if Lord help me just get out of the way and he'll speak the word that he's already spoken in this hour for the going home of the bride. Do we believe we have a message like that? He promised it. His word promised it. He said it would be here. Now there's somebody that's going to hear the word just like it's been in every age. Somebody's going to respond to that truth. That's not your works. It's not what you've done. You couldn't produce it. You couldn't works enough works to make it happen. You were chosen in him before the world began. &gt;&gt; Even to be sitting right here this morning, I'm expecting to hear from him. I'm expecting him to speak through me to your heart. And while he's speaking to you, he speaks to me also. I'm expecting that. I believe God's able to do that. God has a chosen way of doing things. It may be contrary to your way and my way, but he has his chosen way of doing things in his time. How many is willing to wait then in his time? Say, Lord, I don't understand. And there may be things I say that I say I say it comes through me, but said this morning, you may not understand. Well, don't fret over that. God has his time. God knows what you need. God knows what I need. Right on time. Amen. But we're living in a tremendous hour when the word has become unveiled and it's being revealed to those he chose in him before the foundation of the world. See, you didn't have anything to do with it. So, thank you musicians. God bless you. So, it's in his time. I appreciated that. We want we believe we have his time. So, God bless you all. Amen. Amen. Let's have a let's stand together and we're going to open the word. And before we do that, let's have a word of prayer. Our gracious heavenly father, you knew everyone where they would be this morning, where they would be seated. You knew I would stand here this morning. You know all of that, Lord. Before the world began, you saw us doing it. We're only carrying out what you saw and being manifested. Lord, your word is eternal and there's eternal life in that word. And Lord, you don't you live in your word. Some say God lives in the church. No, God doesn't live in the church. God lives in his word. The Catholic Church says he's in his church. No, he's in his word. Now, if that word's in you, quickened, then where is God? He's in his word in you. So, Lord, it's nothing to do with us. By grace, by divine grace are we saved through the revelation that you give to us, Lord. By revelation, the gift is known, Lord, by faith. And faith is a gift of God. It's God revealed in you and I. And that's grace. And now Lord, we just thank you for your goodness as we open the word. May you minister to every individual heart what that heart needs. I ask this for your glory and blessing upon your word. And those that are not here with us, Lord, could not be here. May you bless them and open the word and bless their souls this morning. those listening online, Lord, I've already heard from some that are hearing online and Lord, that have been prayed and praying for this service. I ask you, Lord, to bless them and open the word to their hearts. Reveal yourself, Lord. We expect that. We expect to leave here raised to a higher plane in Christ Jesus. Our our great hope, our anchor, our value. We have our value in you, Lord. Now, we thank you for this in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Turn with me to Song of Solomon, the second chapter. the Old Testament, Song of Solomon. That's after Ecclesiastes, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon. Some of these I didn't even mark out. So, as I turn to them, you you will have time to turn to them and can be put on the board if we can get it on the board. My title this morning to this this morning is this, the voice. And I say the voice, let me just say our the voice of our beloved because I'm wanting to include myself with you, but the the voice of my beloved. So I'm saying mine because it includes you. You're the my also. So the voice of my beloved is the title. Christ revealed in his own word. Christ revealed in his own word. the context of the text. That sounds funny, doesn't it? But what are we going to look at here this morning? The context in the text. We're going to read the text. But there remains an element in that is can only be known to his bride. And that's what I want to minister on this morning. So let's turn here to second Song of Solomon verse 8 to8. The voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills. Verse 10. My beloved spake and said unto me, Rise up. Watch the voice here. Rise up. What did he speak? Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. &gt;&gt; All right, so we're moving toward a climax here. We're moving toward a meeting. Amen. Rise up, my love, my beloved. Okay, verse 13. Let's go to the last part where it says, "Arise. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. So rise up, arise, and come away. You may be seated. The voice of my beloved saying, So what is that voice? The voice of the resurrection. So Isaiah 60 verse1 said, "Arise and shine." Speaking of our day, "Arise, shine, for thy light is come." and the glory of the Lord, not another, the Lord. The glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. Amen. Amen. So, there's a people today that was a part of him to begin with. We realize that. The Bible says it was. Amen. They were in him before the world began. Amen. Just like if I had my son was in me before he was born. Amen. So, where were you in Christ? See, everything types back to that spiritual. All right. I want to read some things here. And what I read here, I'm laying the foundation. I'm going to read here what I'm wanting to bring forth here. So, if there's something, as I said, you don't agree with, that's all right. Just don't cast it aside. You just go back in the word, feed on the message, and see if it's truth or not before you're ready to cast it away. Just search it out. God God will make it known to you. It's not intellectually conceived. These things aren't theologically taught. They are brought to the bride by revelation. And that not of ourselves. As we said, that faith is not of ourselves. It's the gift of God. &gt;&gt; All right. So, let me read here. The logos, the word in the letter, the word in the book opened. The book contain names. How many believe the book contain names? All right. But the names being the mystery hidden in the letter, a supernatural element or member of the word unsealed. What is the member of the word? It's the member of himself unsealed. Now, I'm just reading this. The message of our the message that is the message of our hour or our day. It's a day that's been decreed for you and I to be here. We didn't live back in when Luther preached. We didn't live back when Wesley preached. We didn't live out here in the opening, you and I, when the when the the Pentecostal message of the restoration of the gifts and the baptism was preached. We didn't live in that time. We live in this time. I'm not saying those things didn't apply. They did in their age. But now, where are we? Somebody is going to be alive and living. And someone's going to have that word revealed in their season, &gt;&gt; in his time. All right. So, but God's unsealed or unwrapped the gift in the bride. You see, we believe Jesus was a wrapped gift. &gt;&gt; Wrapped by what? In flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He was ra then he was that he also then what he was he poured into where? His church, his bride. Amen. And they also were vessels that had a wrapped mystery in them. Do you believe that Christ was the mystery of God? And all that Christ was, he poured into his bride. Amen. All right. Then God's unsealed or unwrapped gift is in the bride. There's the message. We're speaking of the hour and the word, the faith of our bridegroom. The word. the word. And I speak the word. I'm speaking of logos here. The word, not letter. The word. &gt;&gt; And I'll we're going to go over that here as we go along. The word, the faith of our bridegroom, which is the son of man, is made flesh in the formation of his bride. Today, not another person is made known. Eve was not another person. Amen. He was another person, but she was not the she was Adam. &gt;&gt; When she was taken out of Adam, she was Adam expressed into another form. &gt;&gt; But her name wasn't another until she fell. Her name was Adam. So she was the expression of Adam. Amen. In another form. And that was the complete revelation of Adam. &gt;&gt; I hope you're learning. That was the complete revelation of Adam. Amen. So, so then God had a family. I won't go any further than that. I want to state a point here because I the time. So, so we see the faith of our bridegroom, the son of man is made flesh now and being made flesh in the formation of his bride. Other words, there's something growing in the bride &gt;&gt; to a complete stature. And that stature is not David's stature. It's Christ. All right. See? So, so the son of man is made flesh in the formation of his bride, which is the message of the seventh angel, which is the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so we've read Solomon. We've heard we're going to hear. So that's what is this faith of our bridegroom? It's the living word in action. &gt;&gt; Amen. Which is Hebrews 4:12. His word is sharper than a two-edged sword. So we'll we'll read this down here. I want you to turn with me down now to Revelation 19. Revelations 19. And I'm going through a lot of words. You say, "Well, don't let the devil tell you, well, you know, you know, you don't understand this." Don't you let the devil tell you that. It's not what you understand. It's what God makes known when he wants to make known as you have need of making it known. So, there may be things that goes beyond you a little bit here. That doesn't mean they're wrong. So, don't let don't let the devil tell you you don't. I remember as a young boy, I had to learn that lesson. I was it used to bother me so much. I couldn't understand what was being preached. I thought, "What? I just don't get it. I just don't understand it. And the Lord said, "Quit your trying to figure it out and let me reveal it as I want to reveal it. As I have need of revealing it to you, I'll make it known." How many believe that? You believe he has that control? &gt;&gt; Amen. You didn't come here in your own. Who Who brought you here? You never had any You never had any control of how you were born, who you're born through, and how you come here. And you're here today. What brought you here today? Something made you believe that you could get in your car and come drive in here and and arrive here and sit here and listen. He knew that I would be preaching what he's inspired me to preach. And it's not David's words. It's what he wanted to preach to his elect sheep. Now, we've been hearing a lot about the sheep know his voice. &gt;&gt; So, that's what I'm speaking on. The sheep know his voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Logos. Now, we're going to come. I'm going to tell you what the log go is here a minute. I I told you, but I'm just laying this out. Okay. Now, Revelations 19 verse 7-9. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him. For the scriptures this day, this scriptur is fulfilled. For let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready. The revealing of the son of man unites the two together. Amen. Proving his word 19 in in Jeffersville. He said the two unite together through that revelation. Then we go to the wedding supper. Amen. A celebration of that union because what we're speaking here is a union &gt;&gt; and it's not an outward public show. It is an it is an invisible union. But it's happening. It's substance. But it's not known to everybody. God didn't God didn't say he would make his word known to everybody. Logos. He doesn't say he makes his word known to everybody. Everybody can hear it spoken. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody can read it, &gt;&gt; but not everybody can receive it. &gt;&gt; So God hid his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe, and we're going to come to it in a minute, I believe God's hid his word in vessels right here this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be unsealed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And when it's unsealed, he's still hidden in vessels. &gt;&gt; When a mystery is unsealed, it just simply becomes a secret. &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes the secret can and it's lived out. But others, but unless it's unveiled in you, you hold the secret. when you when it's unveiled in you, that gift is unwrapped. You hold the secret. &gt;&gt; Okay? I'm saying that because I want it to I want you to get in the right frame here of thought. All right? Now, so so verse 8. And to her, now she hath made herself ready, and to her was granted, not to another, not to anyone else, not to this church, that church, but to her an individual. We're speaking of the bride. We're speaking of the elect. We're speaking of those that were chosen in him already. And if God chose you in him, who's going to take you out of his hand? He doesn't change his thought &gt;&gt; about you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I said a big word when I said thought there. So, just hold that word right there. Now, and so he made and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. Amen. It's the righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The life. We're clothed in his life. The righteousness of saints. Okay. Verse nine. And he saith unto me, type of the bride, John. And he saith unto me, write, blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb. And he, these are the true sayings of God. Verse 11. And I saw heaven opened. Remember, heaven consists of the word. &gt;&gt; And I saw heaven opened. And behold, a white horse. That's a power. And he that sat upon him was called faithful and true. Well, there's only one faithful and true. &gt;&gt; And if you're in him, you're faithful and true. &gt;&gt; But you got to be in him to be faithful and true. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so it's not looking at your failures and mistakes. It's whether you're in him or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he's already accepted those in him. He's already you've already the Bible said you already received in the beloved. He chose you and you've already received you. &gt;&gt; And he had a time to be bring you to birth. He had a time to show you the truth. And because he showed you the truth, you walked in it. What was that? When others see the same truth and won't walk in it. &gt;&gt; What makes the difference? &gt;&gt; That's what we're talking about this morning. All right. So, he's called faithful and true. in righteousness he doth judge and make war. Okay, we'll stop it right there. I want you to go with me now to Revelations 10. Just back a couple chapters here, a few chapters. Revelations 10 and we're going to read 1 through 4 to start with. I could say a lot on these things, brothers and sister. I'm trying to hold back because I'm wanting to make a point here. trying to get a point across because you could preach this message for the next how many many years and never touch it because it's because to the bride this is all becoming one person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The whole revelation of this book is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But we're going to find out you are in the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. All right. So, I won't get ahead of myself here. And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire. Now, John's seeing his second coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right there. Remember Jesus said, "What is that to you, Peter? If he if he remains, if he is if he I show him my coming, what is that to you?" Amen. Well, will this man continue to live? No. They thought he wasn't going to die. He said, "He'll see my coming." He didn't say that. He said, "What is that to you if I show him?" And you know the scripture I'm referring to. All right. Okay. But he did. He did. He was caught up to see it. Now, watch this. Now, what did we see &gt;&gt; unveiled to us? Whose face have we seen that was veiled in a cloud? &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Was that a mighty angel or not? &gt;&gt; Amen. The mighty messenger. Who is this in Revelations 10:1? But Christ himself. &gt;&gt; All right. He's the one that holds the mystery. &gt;&gt; He's the one that unveils the mystery. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; All right. So, here we are in Acts chapter 1. You don't have to turn to it. In Acts chapter 1 and verse 11, he he he rose up from them and was hidden in a cloud. And the Bible said he would return the same way. &gt;&gt; Why? Gaze you into heaven. This same Jesus you see would like so like come in the same manner. You see him go. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before they saw him go, where was he? hid in flesh. &gt;&gt; They saw him go. That one that they saw go when it was hidden and went up in a cloud hidden from view. Then when he returns, he comes back in the same way. But this time for what purpose? To unite with his people, his bride. What is that that we seen? The headstone. Amen. The headstone. All right. Now, so verse two. And he had he had in his hand a little book open. Notice it was not closed. It was open. &gt;&gt; And he had in his little h book had in his hand his hand a little book open. And he see we know we know his hand is a word. And here holds a book that's been opened. &gt;&gt; So something's opened that's been hid. But now it's open. And we find that in Revelations chapter 5, he came who came? The lion. Amen. He came as the lamb. &gt;&gt; Same person. When John looked for a lion, he saw the lamb bloody and wounded. That was the lion back there unveiling himself in simplicity. Now coming the same way back in simplicity in the veil of a man. But who's speaking to us? What is the voice now coming to us? It is the lion. himself. All right? And because the king's sword was put in the hands of that prophet. Amen. Put in his hand. Is that right? Nothing to do with that prophet. I'm talking about the king. The king put it in his hand. Put the word in his hand. Then who's stepping forth reveal? Who's who's he speaking through? Who's speaking to us? Was it the intellect of a man William Brandom or was it the king speaking? See, you have to have a revelation of who Jesus Christ is. He's not three persons. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Okay. So, now watch. As I said, if this is deep, this is this is this is so simple. It's deep. That's a strange thing to say, isn't it? Because you and your humanity cannot be that simple. But God hides himself. Theologians think he's got to reveal himself. They look at the word. It's got to be a great big thing. And so in their mind, they make up the fact how he's going to come. And when he does, it was goes right through him because he comes hiding himself as he always did &gt;&gt; in simplicity. Who preached the message to the Andolivian destruction before they were destroyed? Noah, a farmer. Simplicity. &gt;&gt; How many made it? Eight. over the ark &gt;&gt; yet spoke to a to a to a to a system that as intelligent maybe we're just now getting up to their intelligence that they had. &gt;&gt; But God hid himself in a little simple man building something that was absolutely ridiculous and radical to their thinking. Now God doesn't change. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm God and I change not." He can't come along and do one thing this way and come over here and do it another way. He built an ark there, but he's building another ark in another form now. But the way he hides himself is the way he carries out his word. He hid himself in a man called Jesus didn't even have an education. No, no, nothing in the Bible said he went to school. &gt;&gt; And yet at 12 years old was astounding those priests by answering question. Why? Because he was the he was God himself manifested in the form of his of the son. made flesh. The Bible said he was the fullness of the godhead bodily. So where was God then? He was manifested as a lamb. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That died and shed his blood to redeem us that were in him to begin with. &gt;&gt; What's he redeeming? And I'm going to say it right here. He's redeeming the thoughts of himself. &gt;&gt; He comes to redeem. That was his redemption. Now we've turned a corner here. And what's he coming for now? He's got a book in his hand. What's the book got to do with it? He redeemed what was in the book, but what's the book open for? To claim what he has redeemed. &gt;&gt; Now his act is claiming what he has redeemed. What were the in his thoughts to begin with? The thoughts of himself. I'm not talking about just everything he knew. I'm talking about the thoughts, eternal thoughts of God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. He comes to redeem those thoughts. They they were lost, but they weren't they weren't cast away. He come to redeem them back. He come to restore it back. And he has. And he is. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, what what is he restoring? Our position. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, so verse 11, I've read that. Revelation 10 1-4, second verse. And he had in his hand a little book open. And he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth. Amen. And cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices like they were spelling out something. I'm just going to drop this in like R A P T U R E &gt;&gt; Rapture. They're spelling out something. &gt;&gt; What's the message for? What's this being unveiled for? &gt;&gt; To go home. Amen. All right. So, they're spelling out some somebody. Now, watch what the Bible said. And he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth. And when he had cried, seven. Now you say, "Brother, what are you pointing at?" I'm pointing this to you that this has been unveiled in our day. This is what's happening. This is our day. &gt;&gt; Here's the prophecy. Here's it happening. All right? And cried with a loud voice as when a lion roar. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, brother Random, Brother Prophet said, he said this. He said, "Oh, I just Oh, if there be just to be a thousand lived voices." &gt;&gt; All right. What's that saying? He said, "This message has got to drop somewhere into a heart of a bride." &gt;&gt; And that same voice is going to be voiced. &gt;&gt; All right? Not another voice. All right? So, watch. Now, that's scriptural. Everything I'm saying is scriptural here. It's not just pointing it to some idea and some thought. See, we didn't know these things were hidden in the word. We couldn't know them until God through a prophet, as he said, he would make himself known. Amos 3:7 is the word, and it can't change. I will do nothing, but before I do it, I will reveal my secrets to my servants, the prophets. &gt;&gt; So, a prophet has the has the the word of the Lord comes to him and has the perfect interpretation for the word of that season. And that's why we hang to that because when a prophet comes with the word and God stands behind that and vit and vindicates it by the word to be his word. &gt;&gt; To disbelieve that is to disbelieve Moses when you were in his day. To disbelieve that would be disbelieving Noah in his day. &gt;&gt; And those that rejected and turned it down were destroyed. &gt;&gt; So judgment always followed a major major prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's no different now. Why are we seeing things happening on the earth the way they are? Why are we seeing things happen in in LA? Because judgment was put on the West Coast. It's already begun. He said, "Amen. So what are so who was that white wig? What was that white standing for? The judge. Who are we seeing but the judge? &gt;&gt; And where's the bride in this? She's judged free. &gt;&gt; Sinless." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our judgment isn't at the white throne judgment. I'm speaking to the bride here. The bride doesn't isn't judged at the white throne. She is in she stands sits there with her king judging. &gt;&gt; Know ye not the Bible said that the saints shall judge the earth and even angels. &gt;&gt; So when is our judgment? The book's been opened. That is our judgment. What what is that speaking to you and I? &gt;&gt; Okay. Now we're coming here again into that logos. And I'll give you the what it is here in just a moment as I move forward. Okay. So in verse four, and okay, they sound uttered the voices. Now, let's slip down here. And the angel which I saw, see, oh, I'm sorry, verse four, I didn't read it yet. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, watch this now. I was about to write. John speaking. I was about to write. He was commissioned to write what he saw. Amen. What was showed him and there that those voices spoke something to John and he was going to write it. It was a speech. It was a voice that was speaking and it voiced itself and John was about to write what it said because God's making himself known here through seven ages. Amen. And so he's about to write what the mystery was sealed up and what that was in that book. And watch what the Bible said. And and when the seven thunders had other voices, I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, "Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not." So now we have a word here that's sealed. I mean at this time it's been sealed up. &gt;&gt; It was unwritten. Is that right? An unwritten word. But something opened. Is that right? Now let's jump here to 10:7 and speak of this mystery that was sealed up. In Revelation 10:7, we're speaking of the seventh angel, messenger to the seventh age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation 107. And but in the days of the voice, hello &gt;&gt; of the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; In the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, what is that sound? Declare something. It's a voice. It's a declaration. It's a revelation. It's a revelation being declared that what God thought. Now watch what this is. He said you you look at that word and said begin to sound the mystery. And when he shall begin to sound the mystery singular &gt;&gt; the mystery of God. Who is the mystery of? God. &gt;&gt; In the beginning was God. In the beginning was the word and the word was God &gt;&gt; and the word was with God. &gt;&gt; So somewhere this has got to be a word has if you speak a word you think it before you speak it. &gt;&gt; So the word has to be a thought that's expressed. God then is expressing himself. &gt;&gt; In the beginning, God's expressing himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe that? It's what they said, didn't it? Okay. So, we're going to bring that word that God was and was with him. Before it was word, it was with him. &gt;&gt; Hello. And the same was with God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and the Bible said was God. &gt;&gt; Verse two said the same was with him. Verse one, it said it was with him and the word was God and the same was with God. &gt;&gt; So he's making it very clear that there's something that he's that this word is declaring. And the prophet here takes this mystery that was unwritten. &gt;&gt; Amen. This prophet of our day, his message was to take what was unwritten and unseal it. &gt;&gt; The message of this prophet today is to unseal that hidden mystery &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; That John couldn't write &gt;&gt; because it kept it he kept it a secret. But he said, "But in the days when the last angel to the last stage, when everything is blind, naked, miserable, and don't know it, there's still going to be someone there that's going to be an overcomer and able to sit with me in my throne." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they're going to hear the message. &gt;&gt; They're they're the ones that hear it. Now, you say, "Well, by see everybody." Let's go now. Drop back here. Now, everybody hears it. Right? &gt;&gt; If you want to sit down and listen, you can hear it, but not everybody hears it. &gt;&gt; Well, brother David, you just said everybody hears it, but then everybody doesn't hear it. Then we're talking about two different hearing here. &gt;&gt; You can hear it spoken, then you can hear it and receive it &gt;&gt; because that hides something. That rema that spoken word has a logos. inside &gt;&gt; of that &gt;&gt; the bride &gt;&gt; only knows &gt;&gt; because he can only reveal it to his own. He said he would only reveal it to his own. Okay, I don't want to jump ahead too far. Okay. Now, so we're seeing that in verse 7, the mystery of God would be finished as he hath declared, or other words, prophesied to his servants, the prophets. So now we're seeing God's word this day being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; But there's also another fulfillment. Somebody is going to hear it. And and the next verse said, John, Amen. Now watch. And the voice which I heard, John said, I heard the voice, and I was forbidden to write what it said, but I heard it from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hands of the angel, which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. &gt;&gt; So, there's something in that book that pertained to John. He knew it. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; And when God took the book in Revelations 5 and and and was taken the book, you'll find the same thing in Revelations 4 when when uh when Boaz took Ruth. So when he took the book, there's a book that contains names. That's a section, a bride section of the lamb's book of life. So that little book, it's a little book within the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is open. And it's only open and the mystery has been sealed in earthn vessels today. But in this day our message those those that mystery has been unsealed &gt;&gt; in that vessel. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that unsealed word becomes then no more a mystery. It is a secret because the seventh seal revealed itself in a secret. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many know that's right? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Because because when it sounded when the when the seventh seal was unsealed, there was silence. And the prophet said the silence denoted the secret. &gt;&gt; It's not a public show. It's not public. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You alone have it. The bride alone has it. It's not a group affair. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not saved because we come to this church. We're not saved. We go to any church. It's not church annity anymore. It's revealed to individuals. The mystery is revealed to individuals. They are in a divine relationship of union with the bride, with the Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I said a lot there and kind of jumped ahead, but let's continue here. Trying to watch my time now. I still got some time. All right. Now, so we see verse seven. I went to verse eight to show you that. And the word's got to be somewhere. And I'll come to the rest of that a little later. But he went to the angel said, "Give him the book." And he said, "Take it and eat it up." Now, it's going to c it's going to it's going to bring about some pain. It's going to bring suffering. It's going to be a challenge. It's going to be a struggle. There's a reason for that because I have opened my purpose in you and I am going to do this. I'm going to fulfill my purpose. &gt;&gt; You are ordained under eternal purpose and I'm going to fulfill that purpose. &gt;&gt; And there's nothing going to stop me from doing it. It's going to be hard. It's going to be a struggle. But that word cannot my purpose will not leave. It's been revealed. It's been it's been open to you. And you see yourself sealed in. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. The new birth is the sealing in. &gt;&gt; Don't let anybody tell you the ceiling comes later. What comes later is the full adoption. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're already a son. You're already born. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to grow into the stature of Christ, which is yourself as who you are on the inside of that soul. And so he's going to do everything he needs to do not with by frustration but with a purpose to bring you and fulfill that eternal purpose that you the individual had in his body &gt;&gt; to minister him in this age. Now that was a mouthful but that's the truth. All right. Now now watch now you see so we just read that. Now I'll just I'll drop back to that again. I want you to turn me to Daniel 12:9 if you want to. Now, I I some of this I'm just going to have to read and we'll read without you turning. But in Daniel Daniel 12, the last chapter, now this book was a sealed book. Daniel was actually shown what it would be all the way down to the end. But he said it's for a time further on Daniel, but you'll live and you'll come up and you'll re you'll you will absolutely minister and be with your people. But he said there's mysteries here that was shown Daniel and he was hard to get over it for several days. Amen. Are you with me? Remember when the prophet was shown these mysteries, he said it took him two or three or four days to get out of that. See, it was so powerful. All right. Now, but go thy way. Verse nine, but in the end, he's talking about Daniel in the end. And he said, "Go thy way, Daniel, for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end." Now, we know if we go back to Revelation 10, this one that stood on the foot in the sea and on the land declared that these things would be known. And when it's known, the time would be no longer. Time would no longer be delayed. It's at that time. Now, brother, sister, I'm going to ask you, is this the time or isn't it? &gt;&gt; We know it is because the opening of those seals declares we're at the end. &gt;&gt; We haven't come to that moment, but we're at the end. There's not another message coming. There's not another time. The next thing in in in line for the for the bride is the catching away, the rapture of our body. But what happens before that is a mystery and it's revealed only in her. And that's that is his coming to that point. He has to fulfill that in the catching away and the meeting in the air which absolutely opens up the third coming &gt;&gt; because remember he doesn't step the Calvary man we meet him that Calvary man Jesus our Lord will not step on earth until the millennium. &gt;&gt; Amen. So something's happening right here. He's making himself known. And how he comes is the mystery that's revealed to the bride &gt;&gt; because nobody else can know that mystery. That was what John was forbidden to write is the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But to the bride, it's open. &gt;&gt; Now, you can say, I'll challenge you on that. Do whatever you want to do, but that's fine. I that doesn't bother me. But the point is, stay with the word. Something is revealed to the bride that's already hidden in the word. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, you say, "What about Revelations 10? Was it hidden the word?" Yes. Yes. It opened up. It said something. So, it's hidden the word. It just wasn't time for it to be unsealed until the message of the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; And where then what happens? Well, there's a revelation goes forth. Everybody says, "Praise the Lord." Put their own thought to it and everything else. No. What happens is that there's there still a supernatural element that still has to be there despite the revelation. Despite that it was spoken by the prophet, there's still a supernatural element, an element, a member. There's still a member. There's still an individual that needs to catch that revelation on the inside of the inside. That is that supernatural element. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, let's let's go forward. All right. Now, Daniel 12:9 said, "The words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end." Okay, you say, "Well, it's got to do with us." I'll tell you. I wasn't going to go to this quite yet, but let me just get there because the prophet said this. He said those words, those word, he said you are the words in the book. &gt;&gt; That's beyond written. And it is written, but it's beyond written. It's something hidden in that. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. He hid it, didn't he? Okay. Now, I may have just a moment here. I'm trying to find this. Maybe I'll come to it, but I'm just trying to see. I thought I'd get to it first. Anyway, he said, "You are the word in the book to be opened." That's exactly what he said. And that's what Daniel said. So, it had to come to that time. And now we're seeing prophecy fulfilled. All right. So now remember remember the third pull is the opening of the word. Now I'm going to go forward here because that word that's opened is logos. What is now we'll find here. Let's I'm going to read some scripture and you don't have to turn to this. I just want to read it. This is something I'm just going to read. Hebrews 4:10. For the word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword. The word of God is quick and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of sunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Ephesians 6:17, and take the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. Notice in every case here, we're speaking of the word. And take the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. Revelations 19:13 and 15a. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood. And his name is called the word of God. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp two-edged sword. So we see the word his name is called the word of God. And out of his mouth. Hear it again. This is speaking of logos. These scriptures are speaking of logos. Now I want to bring you what the prophet said Logos is referring to these scriptures. Now he said and in John 1 1-3 in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. The same word that's logos was in the beginning with God and the beginning was logos and the logos was with God and the logos was God. I'm reading it that way for a purpose. And was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him and without him was nothing made which was made. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. He's creator. &gt;&gt; All right. It's too bad that a lot of them being his creation didn't accept him because he came to his own creation &gt;&gt; and his own creation didn't receive him. But as many as did receive him &gt;&gt; to them gave him power to become sons of God. To them gave them those that could receive him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; All right. So for there for 1 John 5:7 for there are three that bear record in heaven. The father, the word, and the holy ghost. That's not three separate people because the very next statement and these three are one. &gt;&gt; So there's not three persons here. &gt;&gt; There's only one God manifested in three offices. &gt;&gt; Father, son, and holy ghost. But what was the son? Logos. the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me now? Okay. I don't want to lose you here. And this I know some, you know, just scratch your head. I It's not a problem. It's not a shame to scratch your head, okay? Because I know this is going, this is brought out for a reason this morning, &gt;&gt; and don't worry about whether you understand everything. Just get in love with Christ. Get in love with his word. Depend on him. You've repented. You've been baptized in his name. Now expect the next thing. He will give you the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Give you the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So just don't stop at that. Go on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the full birth &gt;&gt; and let God be birthed in you. Let his word become alive in you. And then when that word's become alive in you, you and the word are one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that's the difference between church entity and the bride word bride. &gt;&gt; That's the difference between that's the difference between the real believer and the the one that wants to call himself believe. I'm not bringing judgment. I'm just saying there's going to be that because Jesus said himself, "Few there be that find it. Straight is the gate and narrows the way and few there be that find it." But those few will find it. &gt;&gt; And who's going to make it known to them? By their theology figuring it out? No. God's going to reveal it to them because they were chosen in him be before the foundation of the world and would have them to be opened when the book was open. They were opened. &gt;&gt; Remember the third pull is the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; What word? Predestinated word. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word seed is open. &gt;&gt; It takes a Holy Ghost to come upon the seed to give you the birth. Amen. &gt;&gt; The birth is the word revealed in you. &gt;&gt; The new birth is Jesus Christ. The new birth revealed in you. That is the new birth. &gt;&gt; Many, and I say this not to be judgmental, but many will not have the new birth and they will miss the rapture. But I don't know how many. &gt;&gt; I don't know who that is. By their fruit, we know them because the fruit of the season and their season will be revealed to them. And by that they are identified to have passed from death to life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they know that. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I'm not going to stop preaching because I think this one know this. That's none of my business. My business is to preach this this morning. Like everybody believed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right. That's up to God what he wants to make known. &gt;&gt; And he'll do it. And you won't have to push it up, pump it up, work it up. He's going to do it. That's all. You're supernaturally led to be where you are despite your own thinking and not even knowing how could it happen that way. And it happens. Who did that? Something in you recognized his voice. It wasn't what you put there. That eagle was in the barnyard in the chicken yard. But he wasn't a chicken. He was an eagle. And when the eagle flew over and screamed, something inside of him recognized that voice when the chickens didn't. They couldn't. What made the difference? &gt;&gt; So, it's not big me and little everybody else. &gt;&gt; It's no big nothing. &gt;&gt; We with two wings cover our face. Two wings cover our feet. And with two wings we fly by the energy of in in the presence of God himself in humility and covering our own face. We're flying manifesting him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a life lived. It's not some story. It's not imagination. It is the literal life of Jesus Christ, the token lived and on display in that bride. &gt;&gt; Contrary even to your own thinking, &gt;&gt; human thinking, but God doing it &gt;&gt; and he vindicates it. Brings it right back to the word and see it. See, see, if you have the Holy Ghost, you're not going to leave that word. I don't care if it takes the hide off of you. You're not going to leave that word. &gt;&gt; The husband's not going to leave the word. The wife's not going to leave the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For your feelings and for your emotions. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's going to carry it out. You're going to carry it out. I don't care what it what everybody else thinks about it. What everybody else thinks is not your absolute. &gt;&gt; Your absolute is that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God expects you to to get there and and and and take that word and be a possessor of the word. There's many professors. There's just not many possessors. &gt;&gt; Did you catch that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That doesn't matter. It doesn't mean you. It doesn't mean anybody. I don't care about your past. I have a past, too. Everybody has a past. But it's not what God God's achieved something despite your past. &gt;&gt; Look at Look at Paul, a murderer. &gt;&gt; What kind of past did he have? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And yet God chose him to carry the message of the first age to the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, did Paul have anything to do with that? No. God loved Paul before the foundation of the world. Amen. And took his own took Paul and bear his his his bear beared Paul's mistakes, his errors, his failures, and went to Calvary with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And took it and put it back on the head of the devil. &gt;&gt; Was Paul sorry for what he did? Yes. He never quite got over it. But he also said, &gt;&gt; "I know him." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the power of his resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How would he know him? Who would make it known to him? See, to know him is life. That's what we're talking about this morning. To know him is life. Not to know about him. Everybody knows about him, but to know him is life. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, 1 John 5:7, I just read that. Now, let's go back here. Logos quoting now the prophet Logos. Now we now we can see by those scriptures I just read his association with the word. He is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is who he is. We just read in Revelation 19 this one riding forth in the power of the revealed word. His name is the word of God. So the prophet says the word what is it? what he is the word that is who he is. The word in his name is who he is. Amen. All right. Now in first John or John excuse me John 1:1 where it says in the beginning was the word. The root from which we get our translation for word in first in St. John 1:1 is logos which means don't catch this don't miss this meaning which means the thought or concept it has the double meaning of thought and speech. So the double meaning of logos was thought and speech. So before God said it, he had to have a thought about what he said. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He knew all things. Would you agree with that? He knows all things. &gt;&gt; Knew it before the world began. &gt;&gt; Knew what you would be. Know what's in you and put within you. Put within you what you didn't know was within you. &gt;&gt; And he puts it there. And he comes down and he opens it by his word. I pray this morning God will open up his word to you and to your need and give us a good shaking to realize where we're at. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; All right. So, so now we just we want to see this. So, he goes on to say has a double meaning of thought and speech. Now, a thought expressed is a word or words. All right. Isn't that wonderful and beautiful? Well, brother Brandham, what are you talking about here? Wonderful and beautiful. Don't we all have this word? Don't everybody? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; And yes, they got Bibles by the millions. &gt;&gt; Well, I have the word. No, you have God in written form. &gt;&gt; Written form. Does God hide himself in something? &gt;&gt; God hid himself in letters here &gt;&gt; in a form. &gt;&gt; I believe this Bible. It's every bit the truth. &gt;&gt; It's my absolute. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now he says goes on to say the double meaning now a thought. Okay. Now John says the concept of God was expressed the thought of God was expressed in Jesus. He was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. So the thought expressed in Jesus was sealed in an earthn vessel. &gt;&gt; Okay? So when he came to the earth being the fullness and I'm chosen in him, I came in. When he died, you died with him. &gt;&gt; When he rose, you rose with him. &gt;&gt; What did you do when you rose with him? He conquered death, hell, and the grave. And when you rose with him, you conquered death, hell, and the grave. And when he comes down here today and unveils himself in you, you've conquered death, hell, and the grave because he's identified you and him. That's your identification. Then why would we question what God said? Because you're question it by your reasoning and your feelings. Remember this flesh can't even live unless there's a life behind it living through it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But in that life, there's also something else in that spirit. That's a soul. And that soul either came from God or didn't. Amen. Are you with me now? Because if it did, you're going to recognize what you what regardless of what you think and your past and all your failures and all your mistakes. When that word when you hear that word spoken inside of you, something happens. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you were part of that to begin with. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When you hear the truth, &gt;&gt; it does something to you. &gt;&gt; Now, say, "Well, I got it. I got it. I got the answer." No, not necessarily. Remember the remember the when he made himself known to the 70s said why this is a deep saying how can he how can he come from God and come here to the earth and this is a hard saying why we know where he was born where his mother and father was but he turned to his disciples and said would you go also seeing that they've left because that was a hard saying they went and cast out devils they were given power those 70 &gt;&gt; but they couldn't receive the word being manifest for their season. &gt;&gt; He said, "Turn to his disciples, say, will you go also?" And Peter said those words. He said, "Where would we go? &gt;&gt; We are certain. &gt;&gt; We we know, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; And he said, "It's revealed to me and I can speak for it. You are the son of the living Christ, the the son of the living God." &gt;&gt; And we know you have the words of eternal life. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we can't go back to those dead denominations. They don't have anything. &gt;&gt; I we don't understand what you maybe just said, but we know, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You have the words of eternal life. We know this prophet has the perfect interpretation of the word. I may not understand. And there is things I don't understand, he said, but I know, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; that we're hearing the words of eternal life. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. &gt;&gt; Will that man make mistakes? Many mistakes. Did he have his ups and downs? Plenty of them. &gt;&gt; But the message he brought was the logos. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; It wasn't Remma. Rema is the written word. &gt;&gt; Logos is the hidden word. &gt;&gt; Same word. But there's a thought in that written word that it can only be known &gt;&gt; to his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now that that brother sister that that's that's that's that's a Greek interpretation that of the of the logos. What logos is it's not something that is just patched up. That's exactly what it is. It's a thought. You can't have a word without a thought. So where so what God was expressing his word was first a thought. And when you're hidden in the word and you're expressed in your season by the word, you're called by the word. You're brought by the word. You're given life by the word. Then you are in his thought &gt;&gt; and he expressed it in the word. &gt;&gt; And that's why you can't disbelieve this message. &gt;&gt; You can't disbelieve the word because you always were a part of that. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I didn't do anything to merit it. I'm coming to that real quick now. 2 Corinthians 3. And I've got to hurry. 2 Corinthians. And you know how I am. I'm I go a little longer than the hour. I'm not saying that tongue and cheek. I I can't. For 40 plus years, I've tried my best to keep it down. I'm going to do what God wants me to do. &gt;&gt; Right. that I know is much better because he's perfect in all of his ways. So watch, I'm going to close when he says close. Amen. All right. I'm not I'm not saying that arrogantly. I'm saying that by grace. 2 Corinthians 3 verse 6 verse two, excuse me, 2-6. You are our writ You are our epistle written in our hearts where &gt;&gt; written in our hearts known and read of all men. So something's being manifested here that makes you different. You're an oddball to a lot of them but makes you different because you are a living epistle. You're a living word that I'm preaching to you. Paul said, "Written in my heart, written in our hearts, and we're declaring it because we're called to declare it." The Levites were to carry the message and make it move over their hearts, not a new cart like they're trying today. Push play. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You say, "You shouldn't have said that." I'm not afraid to say anything that's contrary to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that's not right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you've taken it out of the hands of God's ordained way of bringing it. Yes. &gt;&gt; And the bride won't stand for that. &gt;&gt; It's not that I don't I don't dislike people. I do. &gt;&gt; But the bride's going to stand for that word &gt;&gt; regardless. We believe in in standing stay at home and listening to tapes. If you don't, you need to get into it and start feeding it. You need to be pushing play some more. But to say you do so and come to a meeting and that's all you do and controlled by an organization and controlled by a head that's trying to tell you what to say and play and not play &gt;&gt; is off the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's off of the word. I'm going to tell you right now. I'm not You say you're pretty bold. I can be bold, but he's more bolder than I am. My Lord and he'll tell you what's right and not right. &gt;&gt; Stay away from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not stay away from people. Stay away from that system. &gt;&gt; All right? Because it's not leading you down the road. &gt;&gt; All right? Now, verse 2, three. For so much, listen to this carefully. Now, for so much as you are individually, you are manifestly declared to be the word of God, the word of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the spirit. You're not, it's not written by ink, the rema. It's not by ink. It's by the spirit, logos. It's by the spirit of the living God. Not in tables of stone or table or or upon paper. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen to me. Tables of stone, but but in the fleshly tables of the heart. &gt;&gt; Okay? And such trust, I love this. Such trust have we through Christ. Through who? Christ to God word. What's going to please God? Our faith. &gt;&gt; Without faith it's impossible to please God. So we have this trust to God. The faith trust to God word. In this we recognize our place. We recognize our position. And in this we have such trust to God word. Amen. Amen. This is what he wanted. Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, &gt;&gt; but our sufficiency is of God. &gt;&gt; Watch the next verse. Who hath made us &gt;&gt; able ministers of the new covenant. That's the new testament of the blood. Are you with me? New covenant. Not of the letter. Hallelujah. not of Remma &gt;&gt; letter. &gt;&gt; Everybody reads the letter. Everybody has the letter and they misinterpret the letter and they misrepresent the letter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they say, "We don't need a prophet. We have the letter." &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Or we do need a prophet. Won't take anything else. No, take no minister. I won't go there. I've already done gone there. All right. So who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the spirit? &gt;&gt; The spirit of what? The letter. &gt;&gt; The spirit of inside the letter. &gt;&gt; The spirit uh the spirit by the spirit we are able ministers. For the letter kleth, but the spirit giveth life. life to what the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. All right. Now, so four chapter 1 verse chapter 4 verse five. For we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord. Logos by the what? Spirit. By the same spirit. and ourselves, your servants, ourselves, your servants for Jesus sake. Now, I'm going to skip six. We preached on six here a lot. Let me go on to seven. But we have this treasure in earth and vessels. What What do you have this birth word? Verse six, birth word &gt;&gt; in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God &gt;&gt; and not of us. Right. &gt;&gt; Then it goes on to say, we're going to be struggling, being tested, being tried, but not cast down, persecuted, but not see, having what? Such trust to know that we are himself revealed. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I read to you, Logos. Isn't that wonderful and beautiful? John says, "The concept of God was expressed in Jesus. He calls his sheep by name, and he leadth them out." Now, isn't that something? He calleth. Didn't the Bible say he called his sheep by name and leads them out? What name did he call them by? Was it David Dehar? Hey, David. No, it's not what he said. Remember brother Brandham said when the mystery is revealed? It wasn't saying like Lord Norman Neville here says not his name. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not your name. &gt;&gt; Whose name is it? It's the revealed word. &gt;&gt; It's the mystery revealed. That's what calls your name. &gt;&gt; Who was he? The me, the ministry, the word revealed. &gt;&gt; And so what calls your name? That mystery revealed. &gt;&gt; The mystery of the book is revealed. And it calls your name &gt;&gt; because you were in the logos to begin with. &gt;&gt; You were the word logos to begin with. All right. Now, church age book, page 163. I'm going to bring out these just a real short version of this because I've said it before many times. Now, according to the word, the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world. Paragraph 163. And this choosing of the bride was purpose in himself. Ephesians 1:9. And in ro purpose the purpose of purpose in himself didn't wasn't yours. It was his purpose. I'm trying to hold back on saying so much about the and in Romans let it speak for itself that the purpose of God Romans 9:11 said the purpose of God was according to election might stand you can't read it any other way the heart purpose the eternal there's only one eternal life that's God &gt;&gt; Satan is not eternal there's only one eternal life that's God and he had thoughts of himself which we're reading right here now watch remember The word is a thought. The logos is a thought revealed or expressed. I mean, and then it being expressed, it's revealed. &gt;&gt; That's that supernatural element. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the the expression or the message can go out and you hear the speech, it's either logos to you or remma. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But if it's logos, then you're hearing the word. If it's speech, if it if it's rema, the revelation's there, but you're not picking it up. Why? &gt;&gt; Because you're not a part of the logos. &gt;&gt; If you miss it, you've got to be a part of the logos to hear him speak the word today. &gt;&gt; Because it was sent to those that were in him. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Now, you see, begin to see we have a text. We have the text. We have the revelation. But despite the revelation, there still has to be a supernatural element here. &gt;&gt; That is the knowing of it to you personally. &gt;&gt; It's an element. It's not an idea. It's not imagination. It's a substance. &gt;&gt; It's known to you. It's revealed to you. You can't explain it. I cannot explain to you this morning this thing. I can only speak it. It takes God to make the revelation. And when it's revealed, it won't leave the word. It'll back up the word. And you begin to see it here and here and here and here and here and over here. And the whole word becomes alive and personalized &gt;&gt; to you and I. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that what's happening? &gt;&gt; The logos is being personalized. God's being personalized. Personalizing himself &gt;&gt; to individuals, to his bride. this mystery. Here's the secret. The mystery revealed. The mystery is revealed in the bride. &gt;&gt; The secret is the word is in her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's good. Praise the Lord. That's it. &gt;&gt; The word is in her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was in you to begin with. You didn't put it there. &gt;&gt; I didn't put it there. What makes you able to hear that word, to receive it? Because God would put it there. That's what makes us different. That's what makes us yearn for him. That's what makes us obey him. &gt;&gt; You know, there's only three physical ordinances that God said we had to obey. &gt;&gt; And some of them won't obey that. &gt;&gt; It shows you what's wrong with your what's wrong with your your your um that's it. That's what I want to say. Experience with God. &gt;&gt; Three things. Communion, foot washing, and water baptism. Yeah. &gt;&gt; After that, it's up to God to do all the rest of it. Who brought you to repentance? Who put it in your heart to to express publicly that I believe that Jesus Christ died for my sins? I'm willing to take his name and by an outward expression show that I died with him and I've raised with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, did it? Well, that's all right. &gt;&gt; Okay. Good landing. All right, then my marker. Okay, &gt;&gt; you see what I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; And he said, if you'll do that, the reason more people aren't really born again or receive the Holy Ghost because there never was a true repentance. You just followed somebody else. You just had it in your mind. Well, though, and so I'll do it. I don't want to make them think I'm not religious. You know, &gt;&gt; there's got to be a true repentance. &gt;&gt; I'm not judging it. I'm telling you the truth. &gt;&gt; If there is, then you said you would receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; which is the Holy Ghost unveiled in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Showing you're a part of that logos. &gt;&gt; Then you're on your way to a full adoption, which is a body change. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you come to that adoption revealed in you that you are Christ and Christ is you and we're one. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's it, my brother. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; So, you know what? No, I won't say that. Yes, I will say that. Shake it off and step up. &gt;&gt; Now, some in here know what I just said. Shake it off. Shake off that old dirt that Satan wanting to put on your back and wanting to bury you under your troubles and under your past and everything else. and shake it off and step up on the promised word, the logos of the word, and march forward with that word, and quit you trying to figure it out and make it happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You just take God at his word and said, "I'm settled in my mind, and my mind is made up. I'm going to do what God said to do as a wife. I'm going to do what God said to do as a husband. I'm going to do what God said to do as a child. I'm going to do what God said to do as a parent." and quit putting your reasoning to it and putting other voices ahead of it because that's nothing but Satan trying to get you under a spirit of something else above what God said. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's idolatry. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying you're idolatry. I'm saying that's an idolatrous spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know why I said all that, but anyway, I want to get back to what I have here. And the purpose was himself. He decreed it. His any purpose of God would take a bride of his own choosing. And the purpose was in himself. And being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world. Decreed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before it was ever written, it was decreed. For in the beginning was the decree. &gt;&gt; What was it before the beginning? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Where were you when I when the sons of God shouted for joy? Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Where were you? If you see where you are and see that you're that eternal, then you're his eternal thoughts, which I'm going to read right here. He said, "The eternal thoughts of God." Let me ask you, are the thoughts of God eternal? Other words, the thoughts of himself, are they eternal? Yes. If you see this, you will see many things. God is unchangeable in both essence and behavior. All right? See how he works. See how his this works. God always had his thoughts for Adam. Adam as his thoughts was yet unexpressed. And in Psalm 139, there it was. It was in him already to begin. But then in the beginning he expressed Adam. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When did he express Adam? When was the open door of Adam? When when did the open door open up? Under the sixth day. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And in the seventh he had his creation. Under the seventh day. Amen. &gt;&gt; He brought forth who? &gt;&gt; And and where was what was the center of Eve's? What was the center of Mrs. Adam's revelation? It was Mr. Adam. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because he was there revealing God and and the center of her revelation was him. &gt;&gt; And when that revelation came into her being a part of him, she was the complete revelation of him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She didn't come from another source. She came from him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? All right. Now, so once. Okay. Now it says that the now God he says now to Jesus was the logos. He was the perfect and complete thought expressed and he became known as the word. That is what he is and forever will be logos. All right. Now it says that he has chosen us in him. Now then brother Dave you say brother David why do we read the word? Because you have to read it &gt;&gt; to receive it. &gt;&gt; You have to hear it to have faith. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Because without faith it's impossible to please him. And faith comes by hearing the word. &gt;&gt; That's what's being preached to you here this morning. Is that faith? and it's being expressed. And faith comes by hearing the word. The five-fold ministry doesn't have anything that's not anything of the selves. They are simply by revelation carrying the word, progressing, moving, making the word move forward. They can't move the word any other way but on the hearts of the Levite. But it's not for them. It is for them, but it's for you. &gt;&gt; It's for the bride. God has a way of taking. He said, "You men, take this and carry it forth. Bring more light on it." And why are they trying to do the opposite? You see? See what I'm saying? Okay. Now, now it says that we were chosen in him, Jesus the logos, before the foundation of the world. That means we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world. That gives an eternal quality quality to the elect element. That gives an eternal quality to the elect. All right. Amen. So you can see that what that germ that you were to be at the beginning. Well, I'll get to that. Okay, just give me just a just a little bit here and I'll finish. Now in the message because we were already in him, not we will be. We are now sitting in Christ Jesus. How do we get into it? By one Holy Ghost baptism. by one spirit we are all baptized or born or birthed into Christmen &gt;&gt; which we are now won't be in Christ we are he's the great spiritual king over the spirit that's in us because we were in him at the beginning &gt;&gt; see in the beginning he thought of you and thought of others like that thought of himself of being tangible then what'd he do he decreed it &gt;&gt; he expressed it in a word that was his thoughts and so brother Bram He expressed his thoughts by word. &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; That's why you hear the word. All right. The eternal God with eternal thoughts, thought and decreed. Word in Romans 9:13. Jacob have I loved. Have I past tense. Jacob have I loved. Esau have I hated. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, what did God know that he hated in Esau? And what did God know that he loved in Jacob? And here's the answer. And neither of them was born, neither had done good or evil. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he's saying before they were born, I love Jacob &gt;&gt; and I ate Esau. And he knew they would come out of one individual. &gt;&gt; Isaac's wife. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? Both predestinated husband and wife. &gt;&gt; But it's not a natural seed. &gt;&gt; All right. But in the natural seed, something else in there. All right. Now watch. See, it was here's the answer. See, it was the thought. And that thought became expressed and God brought back Jacob be because Jacob alone was seed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jacob alone had the seed. That's why he had respect to the birthright and covenant of God. Remember, see the covenant. We're not preaching the covenant by a letter. The New Testament. If you are true seed, you will hear that word. You will hear the word. The spirit that here is different here. And the spirit will baptize you. And it's not these ears what I'm saying. You hear with your heart. You will hear that word. The spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you. And you will receive the word for your day and age. See how clear the truth. He's just bringing you the evidence now of the birth. See how true the true evidence becomes when the word is revealed to you &gt;&gt; that your seed see how the evidence is again note Jesus was the royal seed is not the bride the royal seedmen &gt;&gt; Jesus is the royal seed. Let me say the bride is the royal seed. He lived in a human body and you live in a human body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. When the spirit called him, the word the word when the spirit called to him, watch what he watch what the spirit called to him by the word manifested thought. He called to him by the logos. Okay? He went to Jordan as was there baptized in water and upon obeying the word the Holy Spirit came upon him and the voice said, "This is my beloved son. Hear ye him." What about Revelation 22:17? The spirit and the bride say come. And under her messenger, she becomes the final voice. So what is that voice saying again today? This is he. Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is the bride? This is he. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's the bride saying today? This is he. &gt;&gt; Here's a revelation of what is happening today. Here's the revelation of how I come. Here's the mystery of his coming. This is he, &gt;&gt; the son of man revealed. This is he in bride form. This is he. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; what a powerful word we have. What a message. &gt;&gt; The voice did not say this has become my son. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the son. The bride is the wife. The bride is the son. How do you know? How do you know you who are who you are? Because you are bearing a eternal word child inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride is bearing children. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And what is that child? &gt;&gt; The promised word coming forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just as it was Sarah being the type. &gt;&gt; Yeah. She had to be changed before she could have that conception. &gt;&gt; So do you. &gt;&gt; You have to come to the birth. You got to be changed before you can receive that conception before that can be revealed to you. And you're bearing his child. &gt;&gt; The bride's bearing children. She's pregnantated with the word for the hour. She's bearing children. The veil has been broken and you know it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And who is this that's coming inside of you? It's you, the real you. &gt;&gt; And you know that that's him in you. That union is made because you're bearing his life. It's a revelation to you. &gt;&gt; And it ties right into the word because it brings the word to life to you day by day, word by word. Here a little, there a little. I say, "Brother David, this is too hard for young people." I reject that. That is not too hard for young people to understand. They must be born again just like you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's not what you're figuring out. It's what he reveals. Listen, I was 14 years old when God laid this in my heart that this message was sent by a prophet and that message was truth. Now, what's kept me all these years? It's the same power that can keep you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That same power, that same spirit called to me. I respond to that call. Who put that in me to respond to that word? I was in a chicken yard, but I heard the word of an eagle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that inside of me, I didn't understand everything, but it responded. &gt;&gt; And I said, that's what I want. And from the age of 12, I've never turned around. That because of his grace and his keeping power has kept me. And if it'll keep me, he'll keep you other young people. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Have I made mistakes? Have I ired? Have I failed? Absolutely. But his power has kept me because every time it comes right back to the word again, right back to the word again. Right back to the word again. Why? because I as an individual in him as under an eternal purpose that must be made manifest of himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, we're we're close to a closing now. The voice did not say it's become my son. Jesus was the son. The Holy Ghost positioned him as the son before them all. Then having been filled thus, and the same pattern holds at Pentecost and ever after down to this day, he went in demonstrated power, receiving the full revelation of God and from God for this day. &gt;&gt; For that day, and it's this day. &gt;&gt; There's your identification. &gt;&gt; There's your seal. Nobody can that devil can't come in and take that out of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're sealed till the day of your body change. and you rest in it. That's your rest. You ceased from your own labor. All right. Hebrews 10. I'm going to go over this quickly. Hebrews 10. I've got to close. I know that. Just bear with me. Hebrews 10. Because I only have one opportunity to preach this. I'd love to break it up to about a fivepart series, but Hebrews 10. So, you get to have to put up with me a few times. Hebrews 10 verse 5. Wherefore he cometh into the world, speaking of Christ, he saith, sacrifice and offering, thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In burnt offerings and sacrifice for sin, thou hast had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I come in the volume of the book. There's your log go. There it is. &gt;&gt; Behold, I come in the volume of Rema &gt;&gt; in the volume of the book. I there's an element in here. In the volume, there's an element. There's a supernatural element. It is written of me to do thy will, oh God. It is written of me to do thy will. Can you realize it today, Abide? It's written of you to do his will. The word speaking about you speaks of you. And Paul says the very same thing in Hebrews 1-3. God who sund times in diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us. What's your Bible say? Next word. By. I I'm sorry. I didn't ask you to turn to it. Here's what the Here's what this the King James says. Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son. Brother Brandham said that was the wrong interpretation. It should have been in. And so we read it in the way it's supposed to be. hath in these last days spoken to us in his son. Prophet has in logos or prophet has in parentheses logos whom at hath his son logos whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom he has also made the worlds. Who being in the brightness of his glory, what about you Isaiah 60? Who be in the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power. When he hath by himself purged our sins, he sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high. That is your position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God became expressed in the person of Jesus Christ. How is he be what's being expressed in the bride? The person of Jesus Christ. Jesus was the expression of himself. Jesus was the express image of God. Who's the bride? The expression of himself. John 1 1:14. And the word was made flesh and dwelleth among us. &gt;&gt; What are we holding forth? What are we upholding now when he upheld the word of his power? In Philippi Philippians 2:16, he said he's holding we are to hold forth the word of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sorry you guys getting to work so fast, but I'm reading these things. I'm not having you turn to them. Now, 1 John 1-3. Now I've read that that's in the beginning was the word for the life was manifested. Now watch what he said. That which was from the beginning which we have heard logos with our eyes have seen which we have looked upon our hands have handled the word logos of life. For the life was manifested we've seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with I'm sorry this is first John 1:13 1-3 not St. John what first John which was with the father and was manifested unto us. That which we have seen and heard we declare unto you. That which we have that you may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ. So that which is from the beginning which we have heard. Logos means speech. We have seen with our eyes handled with our hands. See okay. When God was revealed in revealed, he was manifested in flesh. Amen. He hath he that was manifested in flesh. He that hath seen me, he said, has seen the father. In Luke 10, I'm just going to read this real quick because I'm coming to a close here. In Luke 10, I don't want to hurry this, but I've got to. So, I'm just going to have to get it over to you. You can hear the tape again if you want. If you're interested, you can always pick it up again. Luke 10 on tape. Listen to me back in the old age. You can pick up the recording 10. Luke 10 and verse 21. In the hour in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit. I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for thou has hid. He's hiding something from the wise and prudent. &gt;&gt; Wise theologians, prudent them that just got to dress certain way. Everything got to be a certain way and all prudent. See e intellectuals. These things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes. Talk about God in simplicity. Revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, so it seemth good in thy sight. Who's he revealing to? Who's he revealing himself to? His seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the hour g in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said, "I thank thee, oh father, lord of heaven and earth." Oh, I'm sorry. Verse 22, all things are delivered to me of my father. And no man knoweth the father but the son. Knoweth the son, excuse me. &gt;&gt; Who the son is but the father. And who the father is but the son. and to he to whom the son will reveal him. And he turned unto his disciples and said privately, notice, privately, blessed are the eyes which see and the things blessed are are the eyes which see the things that you see. Understand? For I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them. So is it today &gt;&gt; because the mystery was hid but now opened. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; He said brother Brown speaking here on sir is this the sign of the end sir. He said the mysteries here the mysteries plural here is the mystery. A mystery is in scripture is a previously hidden truth divinely revealed but which is a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation. Now this is what the prophet said when the super under the seventh seal when the supernatural comes in that's the mind of Christ. He said, 'Now don't ask me to explain that because I can't and I won't. He said, either you're ordained to receive it or you won't receive it. What's he speaking of here? The logos. When the supernatural comes in, first Corinthians 2:16 said, "We have this mind of Christ." Who's he speaking to here? What is that mind of Christ? That's the thought expressed in the word. &gt;&gt; Okay. Hebrews 3:15. I'm just I'm I'm truly I am closing. So just hold on tight and I'm thankful you have been patient. Three. You see, you only have to put up with me certain times. So Hebrews 3:15, while it is said today, now I'm expressing that because we're talking about today, not only this day, but this hour, this time. While it is said today, if you will hear his voice, harden not your heart as it in the provocation. Amen. For some, for some, when they heard did provoke, how be it not all that came out of Egypt by Moses, not all of them provoked, they came out by Moses, but with whom was he grieved 40 years? Was it not them which had sinned? Unbelief, whose carcass fell in the wilderness? And to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not. So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief. Chapter 4 verse one. Let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering in to his rest any of you should seem to come short of it. For I for unto you for excuse me unto us that's you and I was the gospel preached as well as unto them. But the word, here it is, the word preached, logos preached, did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. I could say a lot on that, but I'm not going to. All right. Jeremiah 31. Jeremiah. Wonderful book. Okay. 31 31 and verse 33. But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord. Now, what was promised, Brother Brham said, to Israel applies to us also the same word. But we know they're a nation and we're a people and we're the queen and they're the nation. After those days, sayeth the Lord, I will put my law in, watch what I'm preaching to. I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts. After what days? After the law, after it's passed, after that grace is taken over, I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, "Know the Lord." For they shall all know me. I said to know him is life. They shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, sayaeth the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. Now, you can find that in this in the scripture over in uh well, in the New Testament, I won't I just won't refer to it right now, but it says the same thing. All right? And said to know him is life, to see St. John 10:14 said, "I know my own and am known of them. I know my sheep and I'm known of them." All right. Then in St. John 5:24, he that understands 5:24 said, "He that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me here. He that heareth my rema but then believeth on me. He that can hear me and believeth receive it has what?" pass from and believeth on me shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life. So he that understands brother Brandham speaking that scripture he that understands knows his place in this hour is who Jesus is speaking to in in Christ the mystery St. John 5:24 said, "He that heareth my word said,"That isn't just sitting listening to it." That's receiving it. See, receiving it. You believe it. Something inside of you tells you it's right. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Something inside of you tells you it's right. You've accepted it. You believe it. It's yours. &gt;&gt; You hear with your heart. &gt;&gt; Romans 10. Romans 10 and verse 18 16. Now talking about preachers, how can they hear except a preacher? And how can a preacher preacher preach unless he's sent? Okay. And verse, excuse me, I went to eight here. 10. Okay. 10:16. But have they not all obeyed? But they have not, excuse me, all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah said, Lord, who hath believed our report? And then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. But I say, have they not all heard? See that question there? Have they not all heard? Yes, verily. Their sound went into all the earth and their words unto the end ends of the world. So they heard it &gt;&gt; but they couldn't receive it. Why? What was what was the sound they were hearing? The sound they were hearing the bride was speaking the thought declared in in words spoken. See the sound was the thought was being declared in the word spoken. Make known one's voice. So the so the so the sound was to make known that voice and that's what the bride's doing. She's making known that voice under her messenger. Okay, I won't go there. Christ in you is the mystery of God revealed. You are the secret revealed. So if Christ is in you, if the mystery is revealed, if Christ is in you, then the mystery is revealed. &gt;&gt; That's that's it. Christ in you, the mystery is revealed. The body must follow the head. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Okay. But Eve walked away, she was deceived. She was in the transgression. Adam was not deceived. See, so when Jesus come forth, he came to redeem her, which is his body. She has to be redeemed in order to come to him. Do you see it? Oh my. See it? It couldn't have happened then because it couldn't have happened then. Other words, the redemption, it's not all finished yet. The redemption's going on. He redeemed them, but the redemption's going on. So, you see the seals when he was in his mediatorial work back there redeeming. But someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed. And all that's in this book would be him. For that's the believer, the words in the book. There's where I said the word would be sealed. But now it's unsealed, unsealed. That's the believer. The word's in the book. The word is him, the logos. All, and you're that logos. All that was in him, excuse me, all that's in that he come forth for this book of redemption, whose names are written in the book before the foundation of the world when he was slain. And there he is today. And here he is today in his word, manifesting the same thing he did there. She can't recognize another headship. No sir, there's no bishop or nothing. She recognizes one headship. That's Christ and Christ is the word. Oh my, I love that. Now, we don't come together. This is token. We don't come together to talk about the message. We come together to get in the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the message is Christ. He is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. We're We're to get into it. Get beneath it. Yes, sir. That's what we're supposed to do. &gt;&gt; Can't you see where you're standing? Life is in the grain. What is it? Just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground. The same Jesus in the bride form. Same power, same church, same thing, same word. The same word sucked up through these and come out here and come to a head here. The same word sucked up through the these what? These ages and come to a head here. What head? What form is that head in? Bride form &gt;&gt; and come to a head here. All that life that come see because we have the message of the hour is the capstone ministry. And all that life that suck up through here picked up its people. Now, now watch what he's saying. Now, this is what I said. It's her. Now, it's forming up into a head. What's forming up into the head? Picked up its people. Now it's forming up into the head for the rapture. That germ, listen to this quotation. I've heard this a long time. It just really struck me. That germ that was in you at the beginning? &gt;&gt; In what at the beginning? The logos. That germ that was in you at the beginning &gt;&gt; found you. &gt;&gt; Right here today. &gt;&gt; There's John 1-2. God forces upward. The spirit of God, which is the word of God, forces upward. My word is spirit and life. That will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word. Then she's in Christ. Will put her in her place. No national force will do it. You can have all the national force, the political force you want. It'll never put the bride in her place. Stand with me, please. What a resurrection this is. If you could come, Ruth and What a resurrection this is. Amen. What'd he say? Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. This message is his love letter to the bride. This message, his love letter, his voice, his logos, his thought expressed to his bride. She and she alone is able by his grace to read between the lines. That's the logos in between the lines. [Music] Why? Because you were his to begin with. And he expressed that thought. And when he wrote that love letter, he was expressing his thought. So you know what he's saying. Who lets you know that? He is revealing it to you cuz you have his mind. You have his thought. You see what the word is saying. Amen. Lord Jesus, I've taken a long time this morning. That was not my intention. Not what never is my intention. But Lord, I believe that this was perfectly what you had designed. Lord, thank you for giving us patience. This whole world is filled with impatience and the things are speeding up because technology is speeding up. And Lord, we're caught up with such ambition that we can't even have patience hardly. We must have it right now. Right now. Right now. But Lord, you're teaching us patience, not a man teaching you patience. What is going to be revealed will be revealed in your time. We think it has to be revealed right now, but Lord, it'll be in your time concerning us. We know what time we're in, but your time of revelation to us individually as we feed upon the open book will be in your time. Then where's that word go then, Lord? Then the final voice comes out. And you shall prophesy again to nations, tongues, and kings. Where is that word? Who's hearing the voice? Lord, I pray there's many here this morning that has heard the voice and is hearing the voice. Lord, now I commit this service to you and every individual set here and I appreciate them, Lord. I love them. You know, I love them with all my heart and I've poured out my heart in this today. And I pray that by grace that you would continue to unveil yourself to me and by grace unveil yourself to them. And together we march forward in step to the change of our bodies. For we're marching out, Lord, you saw her and we're a part of that word. We're part of that symphony. We're a part of that move for it's thus sayeth the Lord. The move is on for the bride now. Lord, I give thee praise and thanks. We give you honor in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. If that's the last message I ever preach, I know that I preached the truth. You know what? I've got to stand someday with him and give an answer for everything I've said to you this morning. I'm well aware of that. It hasn't been said to mix up doctrines. Hasn't been said. It's been said to get out of you, you out of a rut and into freedom. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and in real joy and reality of the revealed Christ in you. When Christ is revealed, we were just talking about that, brother Isaac. When Christ is revealed in you and I, the mystery is unfolded. That's reality. Thank God for the reality of seeing our position in Christ. I want to sing two songs. Can I sing two? Can we sing two songs? Let's sing the first one. It's the original life. Do you believe that? What we've spoken here today is the original life. You know what the token is? The original life on display. But he said for us to get beneath it. When you get beneath it, you've come through it. You've come through the blood. [Music] And you're going to hear. You have an ear to hear. He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear, and my sheep know me, and my sheep hear my voice. Amen. God's attributes were manifested to his bride at this last age. We have caught the revelation by the prophets message and we know who we are and what we are raised up for. Praise the Lord for the original life. The original lies, the original seed, the original word is what I believe. The son of man is revealed. The seventh seal is unveiled. The original life, the original seed. We are the word. Let's start again. We are the word made flesh today. This is what the scriptures say and our names are seen within. Redeemed, perfect without sin. Yes, we are anointed and inspired by our God logos. Who's the original life? The original life. The original seed, the original word is what I believe. Amen. Can you say it? And a man is revealed. Seventh seal personally to you. Original life, the original seed. Our eyes of understanding. He has opened up at last and sweet victory is ours. Who were chained down in the path. Oh, true jubilee has sounded and we have responded to our God whose original life. The original life token. The original seed. The original word faith is what I believe. The son of man in bride form. The seven seal is unveiled. The original life, the original seed. We are called unto adoption, full authority. Amen. Hallelujah. Sleeping saint, wake and join us. More translation in this hour. Gentile days soon be over. Glory hallelujah to our God whose original lie. Oh, the original lie that's me. The original seed me also. The original word that's me is what I believe. The son of man revealed through me. Seventh seal in me. The original life, the original seed. Amen. Amen. The voice of my beloved. Let's sing that before we go. Amen. Can you hear the voice of your beloved? Can you hear the logos? Amen. The voice I don't know what. &gt;&gt; Manifesting time. &gt;&gt; Manifesting time. Sorry. The voice of my beloved. Behold, he quickly comes. Sweeping over the mountain, over the hills he runs. Oh, I long to hear his voice. I long to hear him say. You have &gt;&gt; already. The message has said it. Amen. It's manifesting time. The fruits. But have you really heard it? Amen. Is coming in plain view. Oh. to cap God's chosen bride. Redemption draweth nigh. He's that lovely one. He's coming in plain view. The grapes are yours and mine. Little foxes, be careful those little foxes, for the vineyard blossoms for her harvest time. Keep your eyes on things above. Don't look at me or yourself. See that lovely one. He's coming in plain view. Oh yes, it's manifesting time. The fruits are on the Amen. It's manifested through the branch. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, to cap God's chosen bride. Redemption draweth nigh. He's that lovely one. He's coming in plain view while in the cliff of the rock. Hidden in the secret place so high. Till the day break and the shadows flee away. Oh, in that mountain place, a sweet smell is coming through. He's that lovely one. He's coming in plain view more and more because it's manifesting time. Fruits are on the vine and the lovely one is coming in plain view. Bride time. Oh, the cap. God's chosen bride headstone. &gt;&gt; He's that lovely one. He's coming in plain view. Oh, to cap God's chosen bride. What form today is the bride in the headstone. You're a rock in the rock. You're that peace in him. The formation of himself is revealed through the bride form. God bless you. Be with you till we meet again. [Music]
