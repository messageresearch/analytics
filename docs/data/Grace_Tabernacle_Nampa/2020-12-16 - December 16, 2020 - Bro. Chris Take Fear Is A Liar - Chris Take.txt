name we pray the name of Jesus Christ amen amen it's good to be here tonight thank you musicians amen why don't we stand you can show that first slide and then we'll just stay there for a little bit um my title tonight is fear is a liar amen and my subtitle is Faith is the antidote psalms 27 I know we have a joke in the take house that when things start to go Ry my wife looks at me and says about to preach aren't you and it's funny I'm sure our pastor and Brother David get testify to this that you go through something and God has you preach about it and then that it means a little more to you personally and so uh I had to deal with some fear and uh it's funny what it does to you Psalms 27:1 the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though an host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word he may be seated tonight praise the Lord that's the um opening scripture that brother brandom uses when he preaches the Rapture and um that's perfect for the bride of Christ in the day that we live in amen that there is nothing that the Lord is our life and our Salvation Whom Shall We Fear and mean that encompasses everything the Lord is the strength of our life amen if you want to turn with me to Luke chapter 8 Luke chapter 8 verse 8 while you're turning I'm going to take my jacket off Luke 8 verse 22 now it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a ship with his disciples and he said unto them let us go over unto the other side of the lake and they launched forth but as they sailed sailed he fell asleep and there came down a storm of wind on the lake and they were fil filled with water and were in Jeopardy and they came to him and awoke him saying master master we perish then he rose and rebuked the wind and the Raging of the water and they ceased and there was calm and he said unto them where is your faith and they being afraid wondered saying one to another what manner of man is this for he commandeth even the winds and water and they obey him sorry amen praise the Lord amen so here we have the disciples on the sea and I thought it was interesting that we sing The Haven of Rest amen and there is no coincidence it there is none of that in the kingdom of God with God and um we are living in the Haven of Rest am and so the disciples here were on the Sea of Galilee and um Jesus has asked them to take him to go across to the other side of the lake that they call it and in the middle of this Jesus falls asleep and I don't know if any of you have ever been on the ocean in big waves but um that's no joke I've uh we took I was a young kid so I was kind of oblivious to the fear and I thought it was the coolest thing ever but we took a jetbat out uh out of Whittier Alaska into the ocean and on the way back it was sunny but it was windy and we were dealing with six foot swells and that's a big thing when you can't see over the wave in front of you and your boat's feeling like awfully small and with every Crest water would Splash over the side and into the boat me and my buddy thought it was the coolest thing ever but my dad and his dad were freaking out but we made it okay it was just fine but he had to take every every wave uh gently and uh when he come to the other side it was with a crash and so um the there it says here that their their boat was filled with water didn't say there was a little bit of water it says it was filled so they were on the point of sinking when they woke up Jesus and when Jesus wakes up he asks them where is your faith perhaps they were puzzled at the this question um and not sure what he meant at the time but I'm sure later on as the Revelation grew they understood what the problem was is that they were experiencing fear because of a lack of faith and fear had told them that the waves were going to seek them fear had told them that there was nothing that they were going to be able to do they couldn't fight against the weather and it was going to be the end of their lies that's what fear said but fear is a liar and that's not the outcome of the story The of the story is that Christ who is our faith amen spoke to the storm and brought calm to the Sea amen praise the Lord and from that they sailed out on the smooth seas and they were astonished at what happened and they were like wow this guy can even talk to the storms the winds and the rain and they obey him have you ever seen a storm stopping that fast so okay brother David has praise the Lord I got to hear that testimony sometime amen but God can do it we've heard testimonies apparently there's one in our midst of God doing just that very thing but what does it take it takes faith and faith is the opposite of fear because fear brings doubt but faith is the antidote and I'm here to say tonight that fear is a liar amen Matthew chapter 14 tonight we are uh I'm I'm the coach and we're in halftime and we're getting a pep talk tonight middle of the week praise God we'll preach it right into Sunday Matthew Chapter 14 verse 22 and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitud udes away praise the Lord I wonder if this is after the one we just read or before it that's your homework so maybe maybe it's the second time and he's giving them another chance so he sends them out and verse 23 and when he had sent the multitude away he went up into a mountain apart to PR and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the W wind was contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid amen you remember as a child if you were afraid and and you it was quiet in the house and it was a it was night time you'd heard a noise the wind was blowing against the window panes and and there was just something that spooked you that scared you and then you hear your dad's voice you relax hey it's okay Dad's here I remember times I would wake up in the middle of the night and I would be afraid and then I would hear my dad clear his throat and prop his recliner up cuz he used to get up in the middle of the night and he had to he'd have to sit up for a little bit he'd prop his recliner up and I'd be like hey everything's cool I'm going back to sleep just the sound of the father brought peace amen so here here's Jesus man the father he gives us out the voice be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid amen aren't you glad that you heard that in this day and age that we live in amen there is a lot of fear Amen in the world around us 28 and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus two fears it's a spirit it's not a spirit it's Jesus amen now Peter says well if it's you let me come to you on the water so Peter steps out in faith because he heard the call of the father of he heard the call of Christ he heard the voice and he followed the voice out into the water and he and he began to walk upon the Water to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefor didst thou doubt you would think to yourself Peter just walked on water he how could he be a man of little faith but you see it wasn't the walking on the water it was when he saw the storm when he looked around him at at what was happening amen and he thought he thought to himself well this this this this anointing this power that that is that has has me on the water is not strong enough to overcome what is the storm that is around me it's not strong enough to defeat the waves and the and the wind and so he began to fear and when he began to fear amen that doubt took over and he began to sink into the water but he was just fine he was okay because fear is a liar and so you I mean here the here's these the disciples in the middle of the ocean see sorry it's not the ocean um in the dark middle of the night and there's this person walking across the water I would spook you be honest with me tonight and they they found out it was Jesus fear said that's a spirit that's a ghost of some kind but fear was a liar and it was not it was Christ it was Jesus walking to them Amen brother brandham says and I apologize I didn't get this quote to him but um Jehovah Gyra number 3 1964 he says today people people are something on the order like they was in the days when the disciples Was Out on the Ocean and one night a storm came up and there wasn't nothing all hopes was gone that they ever be saved and they seen him come walking on the water now their ship was water logged and the sails were broke and the ores were gone and they were holding one another screaming and they looked out there and seen him coming walking on the water and was scared of him their only hope and they were afraid of the only thing that could save them if that ain't a true picture today again amen and we'll just we'll just bunny trail off of that isn't that a truth when people hear the truth the truth know the truth and the truth shall set you free when they hear the truth the spirits that they are bound with begin to tremble in fear and they become afraid like he says here the very thing that can save them amen it's like someone perched on a a cliff you know they they're just hey look this is cool and they're standing on the edge and they get gripped by fear and they can't even move someone comes along to try to help them and they don't touch me don't touch me I'm going to fall don't touch me that's the very thing that could save them or someone's drowning and so what do they do they climb on top of the person that's trying to help them cuz fear had taken over amen and when fear takes over it's in the natural when fear takes over some someone they lose all ability to think rationally amen and when fear takes you over over spiritually you lose all ability to think rationally to Think Through the the the the Holy Spirit our filter amen when you allow fear to take over what you're facing what you're what you're dealing with and then you begin to forget the promises of God because now your faith is being replaced with doubt but I'm here to remind you tonight that fear is a liar amen so he goes on to say he says they thought it looked spooky you know they said they cried out for fear it's a spirit it looked too like spiritual that's the same thing it is today but if you'll just do like they did when they cried out they heard that voice coming fear not it is I Be not Afraid be of a good courage and if you'll just watch The Word of Promise for this day you'll hear that same voice speaking through the word it's me I promise to do this in the last days fear not don't be scared put your trust in me the Son of God who he is believe it now amen they were frightened they were afraid but the voice said be of good cheer be of good courage do not be afraid notice that's how first thing he said he didn't say be afraid first first he said be happy you're in the middle of a storm right the waves are cresting over the side of the boat your sail's useless your engine to your boats shot blew a hole out the side of it you're going nowhere you go to grab the ores guess what you forgot them there's no ores in the boat there's nothing you can do you're frightened you're freaking out and this thing on the water says be happy guess what those disciples were the elect of God you are the elect of God tonight and sometimes the Lord comes along and before he even tries to calm you down and and then tell you to not be afraid he says look you need to be happy amen be happy what is there to be happy about they said well it is I Be not Afraid amen that's what they thought what is there to be why are we going to be of good cheer excuse me whatever you are out there on the water do you know what's going on around you are you aware of what's Happening you want us to be of good cheer but then the voice said it's I be not afraid it is I amen be of good cheer it is I he didn't have to say it's Jesus right right he didn't have to say it's it's it's it's Jesus of Nazareth it's it's it's Mary's son it's the son of Joseph it's it's the Messiah it's it's me the Jesus of Na he didn't have to say any of that he said it is I and they knew instantly who it was why why because that the natural typing of the spiritual we know the voice because my sheep know my voice my sheep know my voice amen and when you hear the voice of the shepherd amen it erases the fear that you are experiencing praise the Lord but sometimes amen we have to the Lord fights your battles for you the Lord gives you courage to fight sometimes you have to fight against that fear and you have to know the truths of the word of God to fight against that fear not every time did my did my dad take that fear from me I had to fight that fear now why did I how could I do that because of what I was taught amen so God gives you all the strength all of the Holy Spirit everything you need to face the day and age that we live in but sometimes he says walk by faith against that fear and man sometimes he comes along miraculously and he says it is I be not afraid but he has given you the ability to fight against the Demons of this world and that is fear is a l praise the Lord and tonight we are being reminded of that amen well I think it was Sunday a pastor was was ministering and then it's funny I wrote a title for tonight's sermon down didn't know it was for tonight and um went back and realized it was not the right title but it was the right notes so I changed the title and I just had one little line it said there's discouragement in the message camp and uh I didn't know how that fit it just sat there in my notes until a few minutes before brother Jason called me out and I was reading through some quotes and I began to think that discouragement amen we're going to read the quote here praise the Lord perseverance 1963 now I found this quote I I don't believe there's a coincidence I found this quote and I said oh this is perfect I wonder who she is and I read up and I read down and I realized that she was the the that woman that came to the Lord for the healing of her daughter and he called her a dog so amen we just heard about that on Sunday brother B says he says finally she made her way through all these obstacles and she arrived at Jesus now seemingly all of her trouble was over she arrived at Jesus but it wasn't it was just starting many people would say well if I know Jesus yes we see that every night see he comes right with us each night proves hisself to be here but still we come back the next night with all of our troubles again you see see he so he's saying he says people come every night saying well if I could just see Jesus and he's there but they have to come back they go out with their trouble still he says see is that right now that's right she arrived at Jesus so perhaps maybe if she hadn't had that kind of Faith the first discouragement after finding Jesus why she would have of have been she would have blowed it blowed up and got upset and went back but you see Faith won't do that Faith won't turn it loose faith is persistent it holds right on now watch she had all confidence and faith in this man now if she had just been mocking or just saying you know I'm going to go down and I'm going to give it a try I'll see what he's got to say if he says something against our Creeds we'll we'll just leave that's all but she come to get something and she was determined to stay there till she got it so discouragement fits right in with fear if you go if she would have went to Jesus with the attitude of well I'm just going to go down there and and and and just just take a look and and try there was no faith but because she went down in faith when discouragement came at her when fear came at her amen she didn't turn back aside amen she says but the the the the the dogs eat the crumbs from the master's table she was persevering for what she desired so what is the why did I drop this in here the discouragement around us amen is for one thing is part of the age that we live in but this discouragement the best thing to fight against it is Faith why do you do what you do for the reward that people say hey good job buddy no sir you do it because God called you to do it why do you serve him in this crazy age don't you know influential men have said it's a cult don't you know well-respected men have said oh I came face to face with the truth and I have to deny the message don't you haven't you heard why are you still here tonight because fear is a liar what is the antidote to the discouragement around the message it's faith what is Faith revelation of who Jesus Christ is you cannot get Faith unless you hear the word of God oh so I'm just going to go home and play a tape 24/7 that'll be good but that's not what it means hearing is believing hearing is having a revelation of the word of God and that is where faith comes from that's why brother brandom said if the true bride of Christ the bride of Christ could ever catch revelation of who she is she would be an invincible Army because fear is a liar amen praise the Lord I have a few slides here Genesis 15:1 after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward fear not I am your shield and great reward Genesis 21:17 just so you know I took it from Genesis all the way way through and I thought as I was going through cuz the word fear is mentioned 400 times in the Bible but as I as I was going through and I was looking through I was like am I going to get am I going to get a scripture at Revelations if I am i g this is going to be amazing if I do and I got a scripture at of Revelations so tonight we got to look at a fear not from Genesis to Revelations Genesis 21:17 and God heard the voice of the lad and the angel of God Called to Hagar out of heaven and said unto her what ath thee Hagar fear not not for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is contrary to the word of God was ishma yet God said I hear you so fear not God hath heard God has heard tonight God has heard the groanings and the travailing of the Sons and Daughters of God God has heard amen Genesis 26:24 and the Lord appeared unto him the same night and said I am the god of Abraham thy father fear not for I am with thee and will bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake fear not I am with you and I will bless you brother Chris is it okay to be blessed do I have to do do I have to to to to to to never you know I'm not going to go there praise the Lord I will bless you fear not I will bless you now we come into the book of Deuteronomy don't read it and Deuteronomy is of Moses speaking to the children of Israel from the word of God right the lord gave him the word he's speaking to the children of Israel the children of Israel have spent over 400 years in Egypt praise the Lord remember that Deuteronomy 1:21 behold the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee go up and possess it as a Lord God of thy fathers hath said unto thee fear not neither be discouraged fear not you shall possess in Victory you shall possess in Victory ultimate and total Victory amen Deuteronomy 3:21 to 22 and I commanded Joshua at that time saying thine eyes have seen all that the Lord your God ha done unto these two kings so shall the Lord do unto all the kingdoms wither thou passest you shall not fear them for the Lord your God he shall fight for you fear not your enemy the Lord will fight for you amen fear not your enemy the Lord will fight for you amen you think that scripture applied just to Joshua no sir that scripture was placed there for you today amen God's telling you fear not your enemy amen the Lord will fight for you he's not saying go he's not saying go oh buy a 50 cal machine [Laughter] gun no he's saying don't even fear the enemy amen they're still surrounding your walls they are still set up there with their artillery but don't fear them but I will fight for you amen there's a scripture and there's a story in the Bible about Elisha and he's in a city and all the host of the army a Syrian Army is surrounding them I think I think it's a in Army and his his servant is sitting there trembling what are we going to do and he says Don't Fear The Enemy are you crazy Elisha there's you know there was more of them but per se there's two of us and 400,000 of them and he says Lord opened his eyes and when his eyes were open he saw all the hosts of Heaven surrounding him the Lord will fight for you now we're still in Deuteronomy remember the children of Israel we're in Egypt for 400 years Deuteronomy 11:22 to2 for if she shall diligently keep all these Commandments which I command you see some promises of the word of God come with a um a requirement on your part amen you have to follow the word of the Lord amen you have to live a life for Christ or he will chastise you amen he will spank you praise the Lord to do them to love the Lord your God to walk in all his ways and to cleave unto him then will the Lord Drive D out all these nations from before you you say well I'm not possessing a land there is really no more countries to take over no Nations can be anything in your life these nations was a group of people governments organizations whatever it is in your life could be something that's you're having a time with a complex or or sickness you whatever it is it's contrary to the word of God these ations were not in where they were supposed to be they were on land already given a title deed to the children of Israel guess what everything that this world Amen is yours but your life your children your family is yours given to you by a promise of God Amen and anything that comes on there is a squatter and you have a right to to chase it away I don't care how established that squatter is he might be a sophisticated squatter he might shave every morning put a little cologne on comb his hair he might have a nice house with a pool and a Cadillac he's still a squatter and you shall possess greater Nations and mightier than yourselves every place where on the souls of your feet shall tread shall tread shall be yours for the Wilderness and Lebanon from the river the river Euphrates even unto the uttermost sea shall your Coast be there shall no man be able to stand before you for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon as he hath said unto you fear not the Lord will make your enemies fear you fear not the Lord will make your enemies fear you you say little old me yes when the weakest Christian gets on his knees all hell trembles don't ever be afraid to ask for victory amen no matter what it is Deuteronomy 31:6 be strong and of good courage fear not nor be afraid of them for the Lord thy God he it is that doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee fear not the Lord goes with you and he will not fail or forsake you praise the Lord for that amen Deuteronomy 31:8 and the Lord he it is that doth good go that do go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed maybe I'm a bit of a nerd but I had to go look up the word dismayed dismayed consternation and distress typically that caused by something unexpected no matter what you do no matter what you face in life it's already been covered in the book there is a story there is a scripture there is an example for every everything everyone will face in their life so fear not don't be distressed by the unexpected amen God knows the unexpected is going to happen that's how God works himself right God knows you're going to wake up one morning you got to go out it's it's cold here I'm sorry I've been in I was in Arizona too long I'm freezing somebody send me some help you get up in the morning and and and maybe you don't have a garage and your car's outside and you got to drive in to work and it's the windshield's iced over and it's cold and you decided to make it make it a fast trip out and so you just wear your slippers and you get to the car and the car won't start is that unexpected yes it is fear not don't be distressed amen what don't be stressed that's right you say fear is not just great big scary things amen don't be don't be afraid don't be distressed don't fear how you're going to get your car working again that's right don't be stressed out do you like being around people that are stressed you think the Lord likes being around you when you're stressed praise the Lord he's a gentleman amen the book of Deuteronomy okay now that's Moses to the children of Israel the Israel had been ruled by fear for over 400 years and I found it interesting that in the book of De Deuteronomy there is so much on fear not fear not if you ever been into if you ever been in a relationship or you come from a church that held you there by fear right you have to hear the words of the Good Shepherd that's for a time to wash you from that fear because fear is a liar that's right show the children of Israel how to hear it time and time again fear not fear not fear not fear not if you want a new screen background for your phone just hit me up amen for 400 years their life was ruled by fear when you were in the world your life was ruled by fear am that's right when to bed at night you were afraid you got up in the morning you were afraid the plane hit some serious turbulence you were afraid you pulled your rosary out you were afraid but God's word is the direct opposite of that because he says fear not funny how everything the devil has is a perversion of the Perfection of Christ God calls you to fear him but not scared fears in irreverence amen so the devil thinks you know it's that's like that's the the a big line for people that are Liv in the world oh well this is my choice I do what I want the devil has him jipped could deceived because the bride of Christ knows we are here not by ourselves amen it is Christ right we're the only ones willing to admit that that's right but the people in the world say oh this is all my choice this is what I want to do yet their lives are being ruled by fear praise the Lord judges 6:23 and the Lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not Thou shalt not die now I took this from the story of Gideon Gideon's afraid because he saw the angel and he's you know oh I've seen an angel I'm going to die I'm going to die and the Lord says you know peace be unto thee fear not Thou shalt not die but it's a scripture in the Bible and guess what fear not you shall not die amen you are Eternal amen say how dare how can you say that you know so you you you you say to someone who's who's dying of cancer fear not you shall not die whether they depart this Earth or not they never died if they're a child of God that is a promise you can stake your life on praise the Lord because you have eternal life now we move into First Kings 17:13 and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou Hast said you know we don't always know the outcomes of the tasks we've been given by God that's right but he says just do it and don't be afraid that's right amen that's right now we know the ultimate outcome of serving him on this Earth but we don't know the outcome of our choices to serve him on this earth does that make sense or was that a bit of a tongue twister you don't know the outcome of your choices to sacrifice your life for God always on this Earth but God says fear not go and do like I've told you to do so Elijah is speaking to this lady this woman but make me therefore a little cake first oh well that man is a male chauvinist no see the world has a misunderstanding of what it means what a a true man is and I'm not not going to go into all that that's another sermon for your pastor to preach no just amen we have to give God of ourselves first he says fear not everything's going to be okay but you have to give me your life first what was she doing by making Elijah that cake that was the last of her meals she was giving her life she was giving up her life she was dying out completely because she knew or she thought if she made that cake there would be none for her for her but he says and bring it unto me and after that make for thee and for thy son fear not the Lord will provide and we know the end of that story amen the Lord provided her with plenty of oil and flour for the rest of the drought amen see we try out of our own devices can I have either of these water bottles we try of our own devices to save our own skin sometimes and in doing so prevent God from coming on the scene we have $42 in our bank account we need gas we need food God says put 40 in the offering plate give 40 to this brother and we say no we can't this is the last money we have not though cuz God holds a thousand cattles on every Hill yes sir and so you give next day next few days something happens whether or not God gives you a bunch of cash he provided sometimes sometimes we get caught up and I know this is a fault of my own and I confess before you tonight we get caught up in the materialism of our age amen and we think we got to have it all and we get stressed cuz we can't buy this and then my lovely wife gently reminds me yeah but you're not starving your bills are paid you have food on the table right all all that stuff just there to stress you out where do you think it came from you know I'm a software engineer the fact that you have to scroll on your phone triggers something in your brain and it's satisfying so you think you're these people think they're in control of their phone I'm sorry it's been scientifically altered to be in control of you amen a sweet little button Amazon Amazon has made it handy to spend money just buy it now you don't have to put any shipping information in you don't have to put a credit card information in and you just push the button it says it'll be there in two days no pain till later why is there okay anyways praise the Lord so do not fear God will provide amen and don't get caught up in the materialism of the age that we live in Praise the Lord Psalms 23:4 ye though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me fear no evil for the Lord is with you amen Psalms 118:6 the Lord is on my side I will not fear what can man do unto me amen confession I will not fear now it's your turn God says fear not I'll be with you fear not I will provide fear not be of good courage and then now David comes along and says I will not fear because I know my God so God comes and he God encourages you God's encouraging you tonight fear is a liar do not fear fear not fear not fear not now you have to go out from here confessing I will not fear confession is possession amen and you have been given a promise that wherever you your feet shall tread whether that be spiritually physically in this in this case spiritually in your life you will possess that you can't go find a piece of land and walk around it and then expect to get it unless God tells you to do that that's has happened praise the Lord amen forgive me that was that was my own words there Isaiah 43:1 but now thus sayith the Lord that created thee Oh bride and he that formed thee my beloved fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by thy name Thou Art mine fear not I have redeemed you amen I could how do you go back I could have added in there fear not you are his amise Lord fear not he has called thee by thy name praise the Lord Isaiah 54:4 fear not for Thou shalt not be ashamed neither be thou confounded for Thou shalt not be put to shame for Thou shalt forget the shame of thy Youth and Sh shall not remember the reproach of thy widowhood anymore fear not you will not be ashamed you ever think about the stuff you did when you were younger he says here Thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth God Has Come Amen to to to to to bring within you a renewing amen where you can now look at that stuff and instead of becoming ashamed you can say thank you God for your grace amen prise because sitting there and and this has happened to me and I'm sure it's happened to everyone you sit there and you begin to think you be get ashamed what is that is that edifying to your spiritual life no it's not it's detrimental to your spiritual life so we have a scripture now here for you that says you shall forget the shame you're not going to forget what you did because you're a human being but you forget the shame of thy Youth and you just say God thank you for your grace praise the Lord amen Isaiah 5414 in righteousness shalt thou be established Thou shalt be far from oppression for Thou shalt not fear and from Terror for it shall not come near thee now what is this this is the confession of our father you shall not fear he says fear not you begin to confess I will not fear for I know who my daddy is now he's coming along and he says you shall not fear for I have given you the ability to overcome the world Amen Matthew 10:31 we're in the New Testament fear ye not therefore ye are of more value value than many sparrows fear not you are of Great Value boy that's a big one today why do people commit suicide because they don't realize how valuable they are you don't live in a vacuum you affect people around you you have a purpose you have a place on this planet and then it is never your right to take your life before God is done with you and so fear not you're of Great Value don't be discouraged amen who am I what what what am I to do what what what what do I even mean something you know the people that matter in your life all they do is talk you down but the the Lord is telling you fear not you are of Great Value amen don't have a low self-esteem God has given you a spirit of power and of love and of a sound mind amen you are of Great Value you are fearfully and wonderfully made oh my good I I wish I could tell people that but I wish you could get people to realize just how important they are doesn't matter if you know them they're important they have a place that that that evil looking person that you saw in the store has a soul down in them that gay man that CH that g that that was your bank teller has a soul down in his heart amen do not despise the spirits that are on him do not despise them because of the spirits despise the spirit and hate the sin but say God save them and tell them listen you are better than this you are of greater value than this amen praise the Lord Luke 1:3 but the angel said unto him fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John fear not your prayer has been heard amen if God can say that to Zacharias he's saying it to you tonight he say you're you're pulling from here and you're patching and you're copy pasting no I'm not the promise for Zachariah said I have heard thy prayer God has heard your prayer amen God has heard your prayer amen even you I I'm reading through the Book of Daniel right now Daniel he gets on his knees when he realizes the the um the 70 years and the angel says I started toward you the minute you started praying the minute you start praying God sets into motion the Fulfillment of your prayer and it may take 25 years but God is working amen fear not your prayer has been heard Luke 8 verse 50 but when Jesus heard it he answered him saying fear not believe only and she shall be made whole fear not you shall be healed you shall be healed there's a lot of sick people for whatever Co that's the big one right now there's a lot of people getting sick you can't deny that but fear not amen you shall be healed you can tell somebody that do you know that you don't have to fear that they that they pass away you can tell them you will be healed amen if they're a child of God they will be healed whether they are healed here or they are healed in glory god will heal them because he's not a man that he can lie Luke 12:32 fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure I love those two words good pleasure to give you the kingdom Satan says oh look if you just work extra and you'll just put your family to the side and you'll miss church and and you'll do this I will give you all the money you can imagine and God's over there saying you don't have to do nothing but serve me and I'm going to give you the kingdom fear not you have been given the kingdom you've been given it already yep sir before the foundation of the world abely Amen did you know you're sitting here you're perfectly well you're healthy you know let's just speak take the Liberty here in two months you're going to get a cold did you know you're already healed from that cold you a even got it yet 2 Timothy 1:7 For God hath not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind fear not you have been given a spirit of power amen fear not you have been given a spirit of Love fear not you have been given a sound mind amen you ever experienced anxiousness or anxiety I should say it messes with your mind but God is saying here fear not amen you have been given a sound mind the devil's telling you right now it's not but God is telling you right now it is who do you want to believe faith is the antidote to fear God has says in countless times through the scripture I will be your portion I will heal you I will save you I will I will provide for you do not worry about what you're experiencing amen because God has not given us a spirit of fear guess what there is fear we wouldn't be talking about it tonight if there wasn't I would have no need to preach this sermon fear is real amen but it is a liar there is persecution Revelations 2:1 I told you Revelations amen fear none of those things which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and you shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a Crown of Life do not be afraid fear none of those things that you will suffer am I saying you're going to go to prison no but you can be being put in prison by someone's influence on your life he can be put in prison by fear amen amen you can be put in prison of your own making because you have something you need to repent from or you have something in your life you need to give up that can be fear uh excuse me a prison but fear none of these things because God has called you to a higher place and God will come and he will lift you from that and fear not those things you'll suffer by another man's hand or another man's word amen or tribulations that you go through from persecution for for standing for the message for excuse me for standing for the word of God for standing for the for the for what God has given you in the Revelation he has given you amen do not be afraid amen fear not what you shall face for I will give you the Crown of Life amen praise the Lord John 16:33 these things have I spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace yes sir so we just went all the from Genesis Revelations fear not amen now John 16:33 pick up the scripture these things I I have spoken unto you these things in this context tonight is all the scriptures about fear not that in me ye might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world listen it's not good enough to just not be afraid you got to tell your face you're happy amen you got to put a smile on your face you think you right if you got something you want to sell and you're a Salesman or saleswoman you go up to someone and you say this thing is amazing you have to buy it it makes me so happy you think they're going to buy it from you you walk around with a long face of religion God sov you understand what I'm saying but do you think someone's going to want what you got when all you do is wowy wowy woo no sir be of good cheer don't be afraid and be of good cheer be happy amen hey I got three fingers pointing back at me you only got one there's some days I don't want to be of good cheer amen I want another cup of coffee be of good cheer I have overcome the world the world that we still live in that is still Satan's Eden has already been overcome by Christ thank you praise the Lord praise the Lord amen John 8:32 and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free you have heard the truth Genesis through Revelations amen fear not the Lord will provide fear not God will heal you you have heard these truths amen those truths will set you free amen the truth of who Christ is and the power that he has given you amen is the antidote to fear amen is the antidote to discouragement amen amen Faith hey praise the Lord re Romans 10:1 17 so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Revelation Revelation is the power to overcome the worlden because Revelation see God says the Lord Jesus Christ has says I have I have everything you need to overcome but a revelation of that allows you to take it that's right without Revelation it's still sitting here but faith says I can take that amen that's right God told Abraham circumcised everyone and God because of of of Abraham's display of Faith amen he was given the circumcision of the flesh now you've been given circumcision of the heart but God said Abraham leave leave your family and come walk with me in the desert he didn't have message books he didn't have support people it was him and Sarah and his nephew who just pulled the opposite direction the entire time caused him grief yet Abraham stepped out in faith you think Abraham had fear yes but his faith overcame fear and when you read of him in Hebrews 11 you don't read about his mistakes you read about by faith praise the Lord by faith you don't hear about the fear and the ending of Noah's life you just hear about the faith that Noah had to step into the ark amen God has given you the ability Amen to fight and have faith to overcome the world that is you are faced with amen and he is telling he is saying amen fear is a liar amen and there's one more thing he says shalom shalom fear not be of good cheer and peace be unto thee peace be unto thee I don't know about you but just saying Shalom makes me feel fuzzy on the inside there's a lot packed in that word Shalom peace unto you God had and God has given you peace that's why the script Psalms it says spread a table be before you in the presence of your enemies every day of your life you're in the presence of your enemies this guy is your enemy but he says I give you peace in the midst of all that imagine a raging War imagine imagine bullets flying overhead artillery shells whistling by bombs explod and you're sitting there having a nice gourmet meal white tablecloth you got a napkin on your leg you got two forks one for your salad one for your steak and you're enjoying yourself there's not a speck of blood on that white tablecloth you you have a meal prepared in the midst of the battle amen you have been given a feast amen and God has said Shalom sister Emy and Sean you guys want to come on up here amen fear is a liar don't be discouraged saints of God don't be discouraged and I I I know great even Great Men of Faith have times of discouragement you're not exempt don't think and don't think there's something wrong with you because you experience fear amen don't think that you know don't pick someone in your head that you think is a great Christian and think they never have fear that's right right we don't we don't there there's there's mature there's different levels of maturity Christians we're all going to come to the same place because that's what's going to get us out of here amen some people who who are mature would be the first ones to say no I'm no great Christian but what is the secret ingredient their faith but where did that Faith come from revelation and the things that they had to go through the the the the the the scars you could see on their the this the uh the black people the Africans that came over in the early days of America and were slaved they had great faith but they had scars on their back to show for it that's right those that earned their freedom had scars on their back to show for it amen the the things that that you go through you you we pray for Faith and we we pray for God to to to to give us more maturity in his word I'm I'm I'm missing a word here I I I apologize but then then we shy away from the the hard thing he's asked us to do when that's now we don't do things for personal gain you understand what I'm saying but God has a journey that you have a journey that you're on and God says you know you're going to walk through through this this fire here you say no I'm not I'm going to go around it you can't that's you can't go around it and so you have to say God give me the strength to walk through the fire the children of Israel excuse me Shadrach Meshach and Abednego like I said I'm reading through the Book of Daniel they had to you okay you think do you think everyone in the kingdom was like oh look at these three guys they're not bowing no everybody knew because of their lives testified of it so as soon as that music played everyone looked at them to see what they were going to do you think they you think they were out there where everyone could see them without praying God give us the strength and the faith to walk through the fire they didn't they didn't go out there I mean I'm sure a human element they were hoping maybe the king would change their mind but they knew if they stood for God they would be thrown into the fire you stand for God you will be thrown into the fire whether that be a natural fire like the children of Israel I pray not but the fire of relationship with your family the fire of relationships at work the fire in in your life but what did that fire do it set them free it burnt their bonds and they walked out see that's the crazy thing about the Mira about Christ he passes you through the fire and with that fire he sets you free from the shame of your Youth and you walk out the other side without a smell of smoke on you who is this guy W that guy's a oh you should have KNN him known him when I knew him you can't even tell the difference now he you can't even see you can excuse me there's a big difference you see well this this guy used to be this over here a murderer yeah wow not a smell of smoke on him praise the Lord amen God help us Amen to remember when fear comes knocking that it's a liar praise the Lord amen amen

sink you fear says you're going to die fear says you can't have that that child you've been asking for or whatever it is when when fear comes to face us may we ignore the voice of fear here and listen to that still small voice of faith on the inside father I pray Lord Jesus that you would give us the courage Lord to stand and fight our battles every single day Lord father may we give may you give
