[35:35] [Music]
[35:43] way
[35:46] [Music]
[35:58] you know we can only imagine what
[36:01] we can have a vision in our mind right
[36:03] now we can
[36:05] think of all the things that scripture
[36:08] says and all the things that have been
[36:09] shared with us still at this point it's
[36:14] unable to be completely grasped
[36:17] amen glad to have our visitor god bless
[36:19] you today sir
[36:21] amen and we have these visiting
[36:24] non-visitors and we are so happy to see
[36:27] them today
[36:28] my brother bob sister joanne god bless
[36:31] you
[36:31] how precious it is to see you today amen
[36:35] i was just actually thinking a couple
[36:37] days ago about
[36:39] what a rotten pastor you have because he
[36:41] hasn't been to your house
[36:43] but uh you know it just
[36:46] sometimes you know it really honestly is
[36:50] just our concern that
[36:52] as we cough and sneeze and whatever
[36:54] through life here that we don't want to
[36:56] bring something to your doorstep but we
[36:58] definitely have been lifting you up in
[37:00] our prayers
[37:02] it's good to be here today amen good to
[37:04] see each one of you
[37:05] brother sergey god bless you glad that
[37:08] you're with us today
[37:09] let's just stand as we turn in the bible
[37:11] today
[37:13] we want to speak to you on the change
[37:17] is happening as we look in the scripture
[37:20] we see all these promised words all
[37:23] these things that
[37:24] described to us and uh just felt
[37:28] very much that the song service this
[37:30] morning
[37:31] touched me on several notes of what i've
[37:33] been thinking and
[37:35] feeling you might say in the last few
[37:37] days and
[37:38] i just always love that when the lord
[37:40] comes and speaks to us
[37:42] through song and through the word and
[37:45] through prayers that are prayed
[37:47] amen when the devil shows up god raises
[37:50] a standard
[37:51] hallelujah we're not focused i like that
[37:54] brother trevor we're not focused on the
[37:56] fact that the devil come roaring to the
[37:58] doorstep
[37:59] we're focused on the fact that god
[38:01] raised up a standard
[38:03] hallelujah so no matter how many times
[38:05] the devil shows up
[38:06] the standard is there being raised amen
[38:09] and
[38:09] all we can say is thank you lord
[38:12] hallelujah
[38:12] let's turn in our bibles to ii
[38:15] corinthians this morning
[38:16] amen i i normally try to tell you i'm
[38:20] going to be short and quick and i'm not
[38:23] so i'm just going to tell you today this
[38:24] will be lengthy
[38:26] so that way you're just prepared for it
[38:30] amen
[38:32] hallelujah second corinthians the fifth
[38:35] chapter starting with the first
[38:36] verse going to verse nine
[38:41] for we know that if our earthly house of
[38:44] this tabernacle
[38:46] were dissolved and we know if time
[38:50] carries on long enough it will
[38:52] amen we have a building of god
[38:58] he's in the house oh hallelujah
[39:02] i just got a little inspired over that
[39:04] praise the lord he's in the house
[39:07] we have a building of god a house
[39:10] not made with hands eternal in the
[39:14] heavens
[39:15] for in this we groan earnestly desiring
[39:19] to be
[39:20] clothed upon with our house which is
[39:22] from heaven
[39:24] if so be that being clothed we shall not
[39:28] be found
[39:29] naked for we that are in this tabernacle
[39:32] do groan being burdened not for that we
[39:35] would be
[39:36] unclothed but clothed upon that
[39:39] mortality might be swallowed up
[39:41] of life now he that hath wrought us
[39:45] for the selfsame thing is god who also
[39:48] hath given
[39:49] unto us the earnest of the spirit
[39:54] look my brother and sister if just think
[39:57] about the times god moving in your life
[40:00] and that is just a down payment
[40:03] that is just the earnest of what god is
[40:05] doing for you prayers answered
[40:08] amen spirits rebuke deliverances
[40:11] that were sought after are found
[40:14] healings have come and this is only a
[40:17] down payment
[40:19] oh my oh my oh my i tell you
[40:22] what i think if i can just inject a
[40:24] opinion for just one second here
[40:26] i think as mere mortals all we can
[40:29] handle is the down payment
[40:33] if god just poured his spirit out upon
[40:35] us my brother and sister we wouldn't
[40:36] even function as in this
[40:38] world right here we would not we would
[40:40] not even be able to see
[40:42] as it were what this life here is and
[40:45] god knew
[40:45] what he was doing amen hallelujah thank
[40:48] you lord
[40:49] but you know he has been still pouring
[40:52] in
[40:53] more and more hallelujah
[40:59] hallelujah therefore we are always
[41:01] confident knowing that wilts we are at
[41:03] home in the body we are absent from the
[41:05] lord
[41:06] for we walk by faith not by sight
[41:09] we are confident is it okay as a
[41:12] christian to be confident
[41:14] look saints i want to just tell you i
[41:16] won't go into the whole story but
[41:17] you know i i've voiced it over this
[41:19] pulpit before you know
[41:21] in the world today churches around us
[41:23] not being critical but churches around
[41:25] us
[41:25] have a mantra we are broken we are
[41:27] broken god knows we are broken
[41:30] i my brother and sister god knows you
[41:32] are fixed
[41:34] god knows you are fixed he didn't say i
[41:36] want you to walk through life
[41:37] with this testimony i'm broken i'm
[41:39] broken i'm broken how can we speak these
[41:42] words we are
[41:43] confident that i'm broken
[41:47] no i'm confident that i'm fixed
[41:53] i say willing rather to be absent from
[41:55] the body
[41:56] and to be present with the lord
[41:58] wherefore we labor that whether present
[42:01] or absent we may be accepted
[42:05] of him here or there or everywhere that
[42:09] we would be accepted of him
[42:11] hallelujah don't you just love that my
[42:13] brother and sister
[42:15] oh lord we just ask you to come this
[42:17] morning and just open your word to us
[42:19] father set us aside lord that it not be
[42:21] our thoughts and our words but

[42:48] you may be seated
[42:49] amen
[42:55] you know sometimes as we are looking
[42:58] through
[42:59] our bible you know you come across this
[43:02] scripture
[43:03] that just strikes you very powerful and
[43:05] i couldn't tell you how many times i
[43:07] have
[43:08] read that scripture those verses but
[43:11] every time that i read them they come
[43:14] even more powerful
[43:15] than ever before and we can talk about
[43:18] all the great accomplishments the places
[43:20] we have
[43:20] been the people we have preached to and
[43:22] prayed for and
[43:24] the miracles that we have seen but it
[43:26] really still comes down that
[43:28] no matter wherefore we labor that
[43:30] whether present or absent
[43:32] we may be accepted of him that is that
[43:35] is the bottom line
[43:36] of it all is that our life would be
[43:40] accepted of our lord jesus christ amen
[43:43] it doesn't matter rich or poor it
[43:45] doesn't matter whether we
[43:46] are educated or illiterate
[43:50] none of that matters what matters is
[43:53] this life that
[43:54] we are giving to him amen
[43:57] now as we would look at that my brother
[43:59] and sister we find
[44:00] in verse 4 which i find as a lovely
[44:03] verse there
[44:05] that we are looking now at this fact
[44:07] that
[44:08] mortality might be swallowed up of life
[44:11] and
[44:11] we're looking and as we're talking about
[44:14] the change is happening
[44:16] we are seeing that mortality is actually
[44:19] being swallowed up in life
[44:20] even as we live today it is not
[44:23] something that's going to be a great
[44:25] event
[44:26] someday but my brother and sister it is
[44:28] the day-to-day life
[44:30] that is this mortality this flesh and
[44:32] we'll dig into this a little deeper in a
[44:34] few minutes but it is being swallowed up
[44:37] i'm telling you every day there's things
[44:40] if we would call it our habits our
[44:42] natures amen
[44:43] and we would love to have you know a
[44:46] brother trevor you just struck right in
[44:48] the thought as i was studying these
[44:50] things
[44:50] we would love to get up one morning and
[44:52] all of those things of our natural life
[44:55] character that describes who we are
[44:57] personally
[44:58] would just be totally changed but you
[45:00] see god as it is is the sands of the
[45:02] seashore as it would be
[45:04] uh the river washing in the canyon god
[45:07] sometimes
[45:08] just works very slowly he lets things
[45:11] just
[45:11] move along and you know he allows us and
[45:15] and this is kind of just a personal uh
[45:17] thought
[45:18] to me really in a sense that god allows
[45:20] us to become sick and tired
[45:22] of us of ourself
[45:25] and in that it becomes the thing that
[45:28] instigates the change because
[45:30] it's not as though we change ourselves
[45:32] or else we would just write some
[45:34] health self-help books and everybody
[45:36] would just be changed
[45:37] but it is within us the word working as
[45:40] the song says the word is working
[45:42] mightily in me and you know sometimes
[45:45] people say well the word says you know
[45:46] that if we would speak to the mountain
[45:48] it would move
[45:49] well my brother and sister i don't
[45:51] believe that is something
[45:53] that god gave to us as a promise that we
[45:55] could just walk around saying
[45:56] move and everybody say wow look what he
[45:58] did but you've got to realize when you
[46:00] speak to those mountains in your life
[46:02] if one pebble rolls off the back side of
[46:05] that mountain god has honored his word
[46:07] we're looking for great things that
[46:09] change it but god says you know what
[46:11] you have to enter into this this is your
[46:14] journey this
[46:15] is as it were your labor now we know
[46:18] that works will not get us there
[46:20] but you'll look through the bible and
[46:21] find over and over again that god has
[46:23] required an effort from his children
[46:26] no child of god ever just laid in bed
[46:28] and got spiritual deliverance
[46:30] that's right amen if it is we'd all
[46:34] buy bigger curtains thicker curtains and
[46:36] just pull the pillow over our head and
[46:38] come out perfect for a rapture
[46:39] it doesn't work that way hallelujah
[46:42] so i love that that mortality might be
[46:45] swallowed up of life and
[46:47] you know we jump down a couple verses
[46:49] and it just reaches out to me
[46:51] this is just really the mantra that we
[46:53] would look at here for we walk by faith
[46:56] and not by sight and
[46:57] i'm telling you if we walk by sight my
[46:59] brother and sister
[47:00] we would be pulling the curtains over
[47:02] the windows and we would be putting our
[47:04] head
[47:05] under the pillow because we're living in
[47:07] a world that's just falling apart and
[47:10] there is just absolutely no doubt about
[47:12] it
[47:12] but you see walking by faith you can
[47:14] look and as the scripture says you see
[47:16] these things coming to pass
[47:18] look up amen don't get all discouraged
[47:21] don't lower your head down
[47:23] raise up look up your redemption draweth
[47:26] night
[47:27] i believe with all of my heart my
[47:28] brother and sister our redemption is
[47:30] right here before us
[47:32] amen and our faith is rising up to this
[47:35] that standard as it were and and we look
[47:38] at that you see
[47:39] because this standard that god has it's
[47:41] not offense
[47:42] around you that satan cannot get through
[47:45] it is our faith in the word of god and
[47:47] as satan comes in and buffets you your
[47:50] faith is rising up
[47:52] and you know you look at this take it
[47:53] back to the book of job you'll find the
[47:55] parallel
[47:56] that it was when the hedge was open that
[47:59] it was then in that case that job
[48:01] started to look at his own life and say
[48:03] you know maybe i'm not or where did i
[48:06] fail and then god allowed those others
[48:09] to come in and start voicing the words
[48:11] of doubt and fear
[48:12] and it was when job got down to a low
[48:15] ebb his faith
[48:16] was waning my brother and sister and
[48:18] satan must have been getting
[48:20] all of the little whistles and the
[48:22] balloons and everything ready for a
[48:24] celebration
[48:25] that god speaks to job and he grasped
[48:28] not just the words my brother and sister
[48:30] but what was behind the word
[48:33] amen you'll look at this and we'll touch
[48:35] on it in a few minutes that lord willing
[48:37] but you see my brother and sister when
[48:38] god said let there be light
[48:41] we don't have to say okay will this come
[48:43] to pass there was a manifestation
[48:45] and light shone now it was no longer
[48:48] just prophetic word speaking let there
[48:50] be light
[48:51] it was a reality so we don't have to go
[48:54] back and say now if god spoke let there
[48:56] be light will there be light there is
[48:58] light we have an evidence of this
[49:00] and when god spoke to job god moved down
[49:03] into the midst of
[49:04] job's battle when satan had raised up
[49:07] such a rampart against him
[49:09] and god spoke to job and he started
[49:11] thinking now what is it
[49:13] i know you've been there i've been there
[49:15] what is it
[49:16] why am i here when yesterday i was up in
[49:18] heavenly places
[49:20] and we start to look at that and we say
[49:22] why and there is something which i hope
[49:24] i can convey to you today
[49:26] that reaches out to you and changes you
[49:30] [Music]
[49:32] and one minute we're looking i couldn't
[49:34] possibly be a son of god i just seem to
[49:36] fail all the time
[49:38] to looking at it and saying the word
[49:40] says the word
[49:41] says and i believe it and i confess it
[49:44] and i don't care what the world or the
[49:46] devil says i'm a son of god
[49:49] and when we come into that position you
[49:51] see satan says whoa that isn't what i
[49:53] intended but you see that's what living
[49:55] by faith does
[49:58] we are not by this world my brother and
[50:00] sister we're not of the things of this
[50:01] world
[50:10] and jumping down to verse 9 before we
[50:12] move on
[50:14] wherefore we labor see there's an effort
[50:16] involved
[50:19] wherefore we labor that no matter what
[50:22] happens
[50:23] here or there that we may be accepted
[50:27] of him amen see that's really the goal
[50:30] my brother and sister
[50:31] too many people come along and say well
[50:33] we believe god sent a prophet we believe
[50:35] this we believe that that settles it
[50:36] no my brother and sister there's a life
[50:38] that must be lived
[50:40] because we're not here to be identified
[50:42] by a title
[50:43] we're identified in the life
[50:46] and so when we identify in the life it
[50:49] doesn't matter what continent you're on
[50:51] it doesn't matter where you from what
[50:53] background you come from
[50:55] or whatever your circumstance might be
[50:57] you'll recognize that who you
[50:59] are is uh entirely entirely contained
[51:03] within the words of god amen
[51:07] now as we look at these passages of
[51:08] scripture we can be looking from our
[51:11] present condition and saying i'm i'm
[51:13] looking for
[51:14] change i i can i can recognize
[51:17] the word has come i recognize that god
[51:20] is moving in our day and and uh
[51:22] what i want to do is is i want to see
[51:25] the change
[51:27] you know sometimes the hardest thing
[51:28] there is is to see the change in us
[51:32] come on saints sometimes the hardest
[51:35] thing is to see the
[51:36] change in us
[51:39] sometimes it can be difficult to
[51:41] recognize
[51:43] you see the same old humanity
[51:47] the same old problems
[51:50] you hear the preacher preach
[51:54] the body change is coming
[51:57] we've heard it for years have we not
[52:00] god's going to take home a bride god's
[52:02] got a chosen people god's
[52:04] we've heard it the change is coming
[52:09] amen let's just go and see what
[52:12] corinthians
[52:14] 15 51-54 says about it that's right
[52:18] amen behold i show you
[52:23] are you here i show you a mystery
[52:28] we shall not all sleep but we shall all
[52:32] be changed so every son or daughter of
[52:36] god that
[52:37] pleased him has the guarantee that
[52:39] you're going to be changed
[52:42] but change is hard change can be really
[52:45] hard
[52:48] in the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[52:50] at the last trump for the trumpet shall
[52:52] sound and the dead shall be raised
[52:54] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[52:57] for this corruptable must put on
[52:59] incorruption and this mortal must put on
[53:01] immortality
[53:03] so when this corruptable shall have put
[53:04] on incorruption and this mortal shall
[53:06] have put on immortality
[53:08] then shall be brought to pass a saying
[53:10] that is written
[53:11] death is swallowed up in victory
[53:16] but you see my brother and sister in one
[53:18] sense you can look at this scripture and
[53:20] say that is
[53:21] future tense but you see the change that
[53:25] brings you
[53:26] to the fulfillment of this scripture is
[53:29] not what we would call a miracle it is
[53:32] not something that just
[53:33] instantly happened and there's no battle
[53:36] my brother and sister you'll find
[53:37] continuity through the scripture
[53:39] there's always been a battle associated
[53:42] with victory
[53:45] victory does not come by just being
[53:47] present
[53:49] victory comes by being a participant
[53:54] that's right so you look at this
[53:58] the body change is coming i believe this
[54:00] scripture with all of my heart
[54:02] but my brother and sister i want you to
[54:04] hear this preacher this morning
[54:06] that change is here
[54:09] because the foundation of our change
[54:13] is in the word of god not
[54:16] just the word but the revealed word or
[54:18] word that you
[54:19] understand word that's come alive to you
[54:22] the preacher or someone else can say
[54:25] it's in here it's in here
[54:26] but if it's not at your level and it's
[54:29] not in you
[54:30] then it does no good
[54:33] hallelujah
[54:37] i can tell every every time that they
[54:39] have a seminar in phoenix arizona
[54:41] on how to sell houses and make lots of
[54:43] money
[54:44] i i know when that happens because my
[54:46] phone rings
[54:47] and people want to know if i want to
[54:49] sell a house that i've sold almost two
[54:51] years ago
[54:54] you but you see they're buying into a
[54:56] concept that has no foundation
[54:58] because if it had a foundation it would
[55:00] be current
[55:03] come on we can be lutherans my brother
[55:05] and sister
[55:06] we can be methodists my brother and
[55:08] sister but you see
[55:10] the word has kept on moving and we are
[55:13] here we are not here
[55:15] to dive into the concept that luther
[55:18] what he spoke was absolutely
[55:20] truth but it's not the word for our day
[55:23] it is a portion it was foundation that
[55:26] was laid it come down it's all a part of
[55:28] it
[55:29] but we don't want to go back to luther's
[55:31] day my brother and sister
[55:33] we have revealed word for this day a
[55:35] word that comes down
[55:37] write down and follow the continuity
[55:39] just in the scripture
[55:40] and it brings us to a day that we are
[55:43] talking about a word in this hour that
[55:45] is producing
[55:46] rapturing faith not just a
[55:50] faith but rapturing faith very specific
[55:53] hallelujah or we can go on for a few
[55:57] more hundred years talking about
[55:59] god's going to come someday i'm telling
[56:02] you in my world
[56:03] in my world i hope your world's the same
[56:05] way in my world he has come
[56:09] he is here today i'm not looking for a
[56:12] future
[56:12] tense of god in my life i'm not looking
[56:15] at a past tense of god in my life
[56:18] i'm looking at a present tense god in my
[56:21] life
[56:23] hallelujah so the foundation of change
[56:27] or our change let's get more specific
[56:29] is in the word of god now let's look
[56:31] right here in this quotation
[56:33] amen that the people that's the people
[56:35] now the seed of abraham
[56:37] because he raised us from the dead amen
[56:42] we were dead in sin and trespasses and
[56:44] he who was able to change
[56:46] look changes that's it multifaceted
[56:52] he changed my mind amen
[56:55] amen brother christian
[56:59] your lovely wife is undergoing
[57:02] the metamorphosis of a change of mind
[57:05] amen
[57:07] amen come on i hope we're all lifting
[57:11] her up in prayer
[57:14] you see we don't want her to just sit
[57:15] there in limbo land is there a god or is
[57:17] there not
[57:18] right we know there's a god
[57:22] hallelujah so he's able to change my
[57:25] mind
[57:26] change my thoughts
[57:29] boy it's getting more complicated as we
[57:31] go here
[57:33] change my nature don't you love this
[57:36] all encompassing right we can't just hit
[57:39] a few high points
[57:42] comes down change my nature change me
[57:45] all over that's from the top of my head
[57:49] to the bottom of my feet from fingertip
[57:53] to fingertip i don't want to just lose a
[57:55] temper
[57:56] i don't want to just lose this i don't
[57:58] want to just lose that
[57:59] i want to be changed oh hallelujah can
[58:03] someone say it's happening
[58:05] hallelujah he can do as he pleases
[58:09] and if he can't do as he pleases he's
[58:11] not god
[58:13] so people that are like well you know we
[58:16] can only expect
[58:17] so much
[58:21] unbeliever
[58:25] i can expect a complete deliverance
[58:28] a complete restoration a complete
[58:31] healing
[58:32] and complete revelation of who jesus
[58:34] christ is
[58:36] anything short of that you are limiting
[58:38] god which means you don't believe
[58:41] change my thoughts change my nature
[58:44] change me all over
[58:46] he can do as he pleases whatever he says
[58:49] i believe it's the truth and every seed
[58:53] of abraham
[58:54] believes the same thing amen
[58:58] hallelujah i hope this doesn't sound
[59:01] judgmental to you my brother and sister
[59:03] but the problem is is we have way too
[59:06] many limitations
[59:09] this will work unless this happens
[59:13] they'll get deliverance unless
[59:16] this happens
[59:19] they would come to church if the sermon
[59:23] was short enough
[59:26] and didn't step on my toes
[59:30] come on real son or daughter of god says
[59:33] oh lord
[59:34] condition me condition me lord for what
[59:38] i need to receive
[59:44] amen
[59:51] a little something comes in my mind but
[59:52] i think it's too
[59:55] you might say just humor and i don't
[59:57] want to inject it now
[59:59] but you see my brother and sister this
[1:00:02] is what happens
[1:00:03] when a person completely surrenders
[1:00:06] to jesus christ amen that's right
[1:00:10] that's exactly right we can only move as
[1:00:13] far let's just stop for a minute
[1:00:16] god might change our mind about
[1:00:18] something
[1:00:20] but we really want to have our own
[1:00:22] opinion so he doesn't get our thoughts
[1:00:26] and we'll still stand up and if you're
[1:00:28] irish forgive me i'm not picking on you
[1:00:30] it's just the common phrase well we have
[1:00:32] a temper we're irish
[1:00:34] you ever noticed you never saw anyone
[1:00:37] who ever repeated that
[1:00:38] go well we have a temper we're irish
[1:00:42] no sir we have a temper
[1:00:46] we're irish
[1:00:49] come on that's how it works
[1:00:53] so we might give him our mind as it is
[1:00:56] now if you'll understand this that we
[1:00:57] can read our bible and say sure enough
[1:00:59] jesus christ died for me
[1:01:01] sure enough i need to repent i need to
[1:01:03] be baptized sure enough i need to
[1:01:06] but you see we don't give him our
[1:01:08] thoughts we're still
[1:01:10] more concerned about the fact that major
[1:01:13] league baseball left the state of
[1:01:14] georgia we have a disaster here
[1:01:18] what are they going to do well praise
[1:01:21] the lord
[1:01:24] when i first saw that major league
[1:01:26] baseball
[1:01:27] cancels georgia and i was like
[1:01:31] mlb what is that
[1:01:39] i'm not making fun of it but it's like
[1:01:41] with all the acronyms that are out here
[1:01:43] in the world and then
[1:01:44] then i thought well what is that and i i
[1:01:46] was on the computer news and i clicked
[1:01:47] on it's like oh major league baseball
[1:01:50] yeah that's right they still play
[1:01:52] baseball don't they
[1:01:56] you see because that's not our world but
[1:01:59] if we
[1:02:01] give him our mind but our thoughts are
[1:02:03] all caught up in
[1:02:04] our nature's all caught up and see what
[1:02:07] it comes down to is
[1:02:08] we got to have a change
[1:02:11] [Applause]
[1:02:12] and what god starts god finishes
[1:02:17] hallelujah come kicking or screaming
[1:02:22] come crying come holding on to
[1:02:25] everything in the world but if you're
[1:02:26] son or daughter of god you will come
[1:02:29] that's it hallelujah
[1:02:32] might have to give up some of those
[1:02:33] beloved things
[1:02:37] yeah we'll move on before i get myself
[1:02:39] in trouble amen now look at this
[1:02:41] ephesians 1.
[1:02:43] this is quite a lengthy bit of scripture
[1:02:45] but if you'll just be patient with me
[1:02:47] you look at this because you see god is
[1:02:49] laying a foundation
[1:02:51] and and when we uh can catch the mind of
[1:02:54] god the spirit of god
[1:02:55] we'll understand exactly what god is
[1:02:58] trying to do
[1:02:59] now you know you can come along and and
[1:03:01] you know just pick
[1:03:02] something you can have uh two men
[1:03:05] equally qualified equally gifted framing
[1:03:08] a house but they have learned in two
[1:03:09] different fashions
[1:03:11] when those men come together one's going
[1:03:12] to be telling the other you're doing
[1:03:14] that wrong you're doing that wrong
[1:03:15] you're doing that wrong
[1:03:16] but yet in reality they will both finish
[1:03:19] with a house that is square and plum
[1:03:21] and is structurally sound it's just one
[1:03:24] learned in a different fashion
[1:03:26] now i'll bring this out to expound on it
[1:03:28] a little more i remember years ago i was
[1:03:30] in construction
[1:03:31] when there were men that moved here or
[1:03:33] come here from the state of california
[1:03:35] and introduced what they called the
[1:03:37] california corner in framing
[1:03:39] now most of you wouldn't know what that
[1:03:40] was but it actually is just a labor
[1:03:42] saving
[1:03:43] and a wood saving method of framing
[1:03:46] corners on a house
[1:03:47] and i remember the first house we
[1:03:49] encountered and
[1:03:50] working with a gentleman and he said
[1:03:52] we're going to frame this house with
[1:03:53] california corners
[1:03:55] and all of us are looking at him what
[1:03:57] are you talking about
[1:03:59] and we framed the house with california
[1:04:01] corners because it was his house his job
[1:04:04] and when the inspector come he said what
[1:04:06] kind of nonsense is this
[1:04:08] i'm not accepting this there's not
[1:04:10] enough wood in this corner
[1:04:12] and so this man had to then go into the
[1:04:15] uniform building code
[1:04:16] and dig through there into some random
[1:04:18] paragraph that says
[1:04:20] in this condition you can in the meeting
[1:04:22] of two walls
[1:04:23] in a corner introduce you can do it blah
[1:04:26] blah blah blah and the inspectors like
[1:04:28] never knew that existed so you see my
[1:04:31] brother and sister the fact that we as
[1:04:32] humans i cannot come
[1:04:34] in in my spiritual walk the same exact
[1:04:36] way that brother trevor comes or brother
[1:04:38] david or anyone else i
[1:04:40] am me and i come but there is one
[1:04:42] absolute
[1:04:43] that is the word and the word says this
[1:04:46] is how it will be done
[1:04:48] what i will accept and what i won't
[1:04:50] accept and no matter what our opinion
[1:04:52] of that is we have to come back to the
[1:04:55] word
[1:04:55] because it designates to us what is
[1:04:58] acceptable
[1:04:59] and so as you look at that now paul an
[1:05:01] apostle of jesus christ by the will of
[1:05:04] god
[1:05:04] to the saints which art ephesus i meant
[1:05:06] grace
[1:05:08] to the faithful in christ jesus grace be
[1:05:11] to you and peace from god our father
[1:05:13] from the lord jesus christ blessed be
[1:05:15] the god and father of our lord jesus
[1:05:17] christ
[1:05:18] who hath blessed us come on
[1:05:21] are you with me who hath blessed us with
[1:05:24] all spiritual blessings
[1:05:25] in heavenly places in christ according
[1:05:29] as he has chosen us in him before the
[1:05:32] foundation of the world
[1:05:33] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:05:35] before him in love
[1:05:37] having predestinated us into the
[1:05:39] adoption of children
[1:05:41] by jesus christ to himself according to
[1:05:44] the good pleasure
[1:05:45] of his will amen
[1:05:48] not our church not a certain preacher
[1:05:51] not someone who feels like they have
[1:05:53] more revelation
[1:05:54] but to his good will and pleasure
[1:05:57] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:05:59] wherein he hath made us
[1:06:01] accepted in the beloved hallelujah
[1:06:05] so it's not just a random possibility or
[1:06:08] something far-fetched that we might
[1:06:10] find ourselves accepted according to
[1:06:13] this word
[1:06:14] we are already accepted can someone say
[1:06:18] amen this morning already accept it
[1:06:22] amen
[1:06:26] amen i get excited about that in whom we
[1:06:29] have redemption through his blood
[1:06:31] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:06:32] riches of his grace
[1:06:34] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[1:06:36] all wisdom and prudence
[1:06:38] having made known oh my brother and
[1:06:40] sister are you with me this morning
[1:06:42] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:06:46] his will
[1:06:49] now let me just interject this if we as
[1:06:52] a church
[1:06:53] are living acting walking talking
[1:06:55] behaving contrary to the word of god
[1:06:58] we cannot reach up and take this
[1:07:00] scripture and say it's ours
[1:07:05] that doesn't mean god's not moving you
[1:07:08] changing you bringing you to this
[1:07:09] position
[1:07:10] but you see we can't have an opinion
[1:07:12] contrary to the word
[1:07:14] and then say oh praise god
[1:07:17] you're in conflict
[1:07:21] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:07:23] his will according to good pleasure
[1:07:25] which he hath purposed in himself that
[1:07:27] in the dispensation
[1:07:28] of the fullness that's complete
[1:07:32] the fullness of times he might gather
[1:07:34] together
[1:07:35] in one all things in christ not in the
[1:07:37] beginning
[1:07:39] not in the beginning not in the middle
[1:07:40] point not at the three quarters
[1:07:43] in the fullness that's the end of my
[1:07:46] brother and sister when it's all coming
[1:07:48] manifested out
[1:07:49] in the fullness of time he might gather
[1:07:53] together
[1:07:53] in one all things in christ both which
[1:07:55] are in heaven
[1:07:56] and which are on earth even in him
[1:08:00] hallelujah in whom also we have obtained
[1:08:04] an inheritance being predestinated
[1:08:07] now look i i don't want to i don't wanna
[1:08:09] sound judgmental
[1:08:12] but you ever talk to somebody in the
[1:08:15] marketplace
[1:08:17] and you visit and something said and
[1:08:19] they like we don't believe in
[1:08:22] predestination
[1:08:27] okay i don't know that we really have
[1:08:30] anything to talk about
[1:08:31] [Music]
[1:08:35] because my bible which i believe with
[1:08:36] all of my heart
[1:08:39] says we're predestinated
[1:08:42] according to the purpose of him who
[1:08:44] worketh all things after the counsel
[1:08:46] of his own will amen amen
[1:08:53] you know there's some christian humorous
[1:08:58] one of them he assured everybody it
[1:09:00] wasn't really a bible
[1:09:03] and he had some humor to go with it and
[1:09:05] the point he was making was very
[1:09:07] profound
[1:09:08] and he says you know i love to witness
[1:09:10] to everybody i meet and i met this
[1:09:12] person in the store and i was talking to
[1:09:14] them they said well we don't agree with
[1:09:15] that part and he reaches over into this
[1:09:18] book rips a few pages out
[1:09:22] and he said i was down here in the park
[1:09:23] walking the dog and i got to talking to
[1:09:25] an individual and they were like oh
[1:09:27] praise the lord this this and this what
[1:09:28] do you think about that i don't believe
[1:09:32] that
[1:09:35] and he said and that i can't do justice
[1:09:37] to his humor
[1:09:38] he said and that's how they got the
[1:09:40] pocket version of the bible
[1:09:44] because they ripped everything they
[1:09:46] disagreed with out of it
[1:09:48] and when they got done they could just
[1:09:50] slide it in their pocket
[1:09:53] no my brother and sister we're believers
[1:09:56] we're believers i believe this bible it
[1:09:58] is not
[1:09:59] for us to censor
[1:10:02] it's for us to believe
[1:10:06] thank you lord amen yes
[1:10:16] that we should be to the praise of his
[1:10:18] glory who first trusted in christ in
[1:10:20] whom ye also trusted after that you
[1:10:21] heard the word of truth
[1:10:23] the gospel of your salvation in whom
[1:10:25] also after that you believed
[1:10:26] you were sealed with that holy spirit of
[1:10:28] promise which is the earnest of our
[1:10:31] inheritance until the redemption of the
[1:10:33] purchased possession
[1:10:34] unto the praise of his glory now we come
[1:10:37] back here's our second encounter as it
[1:10:40] were
[1:10:40] now we understand that this is in the
[1:10:42] mind of paul this is revelation how god
[1:10:45] revealed it to him on the backside of
[1:10:46] the desert
[1:10:47] but he's once again reiterating to us or
[1:10:50] a second witness
[1:10:51] that this is the earnest or the down
[1:10:53] payment of our inheritance
[1:10:55] now this down payment my brother and
[1:10:57] sister is enough to take the drunk
[1:11:00] and the whoremonger the most vile among
[1:11:04] stuffs
[1:11:05] and wash them white as snow oh this
[1:11:08] down payment this earnest of our
[1:11:10] inheritance is so
[1:11:12] powerful oh imagine what the full
[1:11:14] strength of it is
[1:11:16] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:19] hallelujah
[1:11:20] now look at this see to fulfill this
[1:11:24] scripture
[1:11:26] now i want to know are we called to
[1:11:27] fulfill this scripture are we called to
[1:11:29] be these people
[1:11:31] hallelujah but look at this
[1:11:34] now look at the struggle that we face
[1:11:39] we born in sin and shaped in iniquity
[1:11:43] come into the world speaking lies that's
[1:11:45] what the word of god speaks about us
[1:11:48] amen we're called sinners
[1:11:51] but go back to verse four and you will
[1:11:54] recognize
[1:11:55] that we were called for change
[1:12:01] see this right here in verse 4 according
[1:12:03] that he has chosen us and hit before the
[1:12:05] foundation of the world
[1:12:06] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:12:09] before him in love
[1:12:10] my brother and sister there has to be a
[1:12:12] change from those
[1:12:13] born in sin and shaped in iniquity to
[1:12:16] fulfill
[1:12:17] verse 4 there has to be a change but you
[1:12:20] see
[1:12:20] the problem is is we're looking at it in
[1:12:22] the wrong way
[1:12:23] because we will find that we were in
[1:12:26] christ from before the foundation of the
[1:12:28] world
[1:12:29] so really what the change is is in our
[1:12:31] thinking
[1:12:32] now our change is in how we view ourself
[1:12:35] because you will be as you see yourself
[1:12:41] come on are you with me you will be
[1:12:45] as you see yourself and we're not
[1:12:48] talking about self-help or psychology
[1:12:50] if you look at the word of god and you
[1:12:52] say i'll never live up to that my
[1:12:54] brother and sister
[1:12:55] then you will struggle and struggle and
[1:12:57] struggle
[1:12:58] you look at the word of god and say lord
[1:13:00] there's a high standard
[1:13:02] there's a high standard you have raised
[1:13:04] up in this lao to see an age
[1:13:06] and lord i i don't know it doesn't look
[1:13:08] like i can do it
[1:13:09] it doesn't seem like i can do it but
[1:13:11] your word says
[1:13:13] i will do it lord so i will do it
[1:13:16] you see it has to come to the way we
[1:13:18] think it so my brother and sister the
[1:13:20] change oh we
[1:13:21] see it we see it in our lives we preach
[1:13:23] it to our children
[1:13:24] that you're going to repent and be
[1:13:26] baptized you got to get filled with the
[1:13:28] holy ghost you've got to live for god
[1:13:30] there's no substitute no shortcut but my
[1:13:32] brother and sister do you understand
[1:13:35] that the will of god has already been
[1:13:38] placed in you
[1:13:39] it is now time for us as sons and
[1:13:42] daughters of god
[1:13:43] to look at the plan of god and see who
[1:13:45] we are
[1:13:46] in the plan and when we see oh well i
[1:13:49] tell you my brother and sister
[1:13:50] you cannot look i i have a friend
[1:13:54] only one in the whole family that's a
[1:13:56] christian
[1:13:58] the family is respectful but yet a
[1:14:00] little bit mocking
[1:14:04] i think they term him as the reject
[1:14:09] six that live this way and one that
[1:14:12] won't touch their lifestyle
[1:14:16] they think it's ruled by a majority
[1:14:19] so therefore he must be the reject
[1:14:27] and you know what he does he turns
[1:14:29] around and says that's right
[1:14:31] i've rejected everything the devil
[1:14:35] offered that's right they don't like
[1:14:39] that
[1:14:40] they start talking about politics that's
[1:14:42] much safer
[1:14:46] do you see my brother and sister what
[1:14:47] happened it's the frame of mind i hope
[1:14:49] you catch my point today
[1:14:50] i could be misunderstood it's how you
[1:14:54] look at yourself in the word of god
[1:14:55] that's going
[1:14:56] to matter that's what was happening with
[1:14:58] job job was starting
[1:14:59] his friends are saying look joe what was
[1:15:01] a secret sin what is it job that you
[1:15:03] have done
[1:15:03] and job was there frustrated his own
[1:15:05] wife saying you know what you speak as a
[1:15:07] foolish man
[1:15:08] why don't you just curse god and die and
[1:15:10] you can't tell me that job is a man
[1:15:12] didn't look over at his wife and think
[1:15:14] i'd like to just ring her a little
[1:15:15] scrawny neck
[1:15:19] we are humans aren't we yeah
[1:15:24] but you see when god spoke to job
[1:15:27] not the first time he ever spoke to him
[1:15:29] but in the midst of that battle
[1:15:32] in that season god spoke to job and job
[1:15:35] started to catch that and god says where
[1:15:37] were you
[1:15:39] hallelujah what a question to be asked
[1:15:41] us where were we
[1:15:42] my brother and sister well i've got the
[1:15:44] word of god that says that before the
[1:15:46] foundation of the world
[1:15:47] i was in him so i can stop and say i
[1:15:51] don't know what happened when the stars
[1:15:52] were hung
[1:15:53] i don't know what in the heavens were
[1:15:54] created i don't know none of that stuff
[1:15:56] but i know according to the word i was
[1:15:58] in him
[1:16:00] i was chosen in him before the
[1:16:02] foundation of the world
[1:16:03] so i can go back to that place but you
[1:16:06] see i have to be able to reconcile
[1:16:08] who i am and who you are in this present
[1:16:11] world and the struggles that we have and
[1:16:12] the trials that we face and we can say
[1:16:15] but if i was a christian i wouldn't do
[1:16:16] this
[1:16:17] and god says i've already chose you that
[1:16:19] portion of the equation is all finished
[1:16:21] what we're working on is the changing
[1:16:23] of your thinking of your ideas your
[1:16:26] imaginations your nature
[1:16:28] to see my plan for you to see who you
[1:16:31] are
[1:16:31] in me there's where the change is coming
[1:16:34] amen it is not that we will save
[1:16:36] ourselves
[1:16:36] it is not that we can produce anything
[1:16:39] but god coming down starts to enlighten
[1:16:41] or show us
[1:16:42] that we truly are sons and daughters of
[1:16:44] god and that equation is settled
[1:16:48] hallelujah you see we've been chosen for
[1:16:52] change
[1:16:54] now you look at this my brother and
[1:16:55] sister when you're chose for change
[1:16:58] brother it's not just a simple thing it
[1:17:01] actually can be
[1:17:02] quite strenuous you might say on us in
[1:17:04] our life
[1:17:06] you know as a as a young child my my
[1:17:08] parents
[1:17:10] my parents did their very best that they
[1:17:12] could do
[1:17:15] we lived on a farm outside of the small
[1:17:17] town of greenleaf
[1:17:20] about the same distance you might say
[1:17:21] opposite of what the graham family lives
[1:17:24] on this side we lived on the other side
[1:17:28] the family lovely old couple christian
[1:17:31] people
[1:17:32] friends quakers owned a little store in
[1:17:35] greenleaf
[1:17:36] we're talking about a little old store
[1:17:38] stooped wood porch with the boards worn
[1:17:41] pot belly stove in the middle you could
[1:17:44] walk in there
[1:17:45] ask for a gallon of milk and walk out of
[1:17:48] the store
[1:17:48] they pulled the card out under your
[1:17:51] family name
[1:17:52] and wrote the date and one gallon of
[1:17:54] milk
[1:17:56] and when my parents settled up their
[1:17:58] milk check at the end of the month
[1:18:00] they would stop in there they would pull
[1:18:02] that card out
[1:18:03] they would add up what was owed
[1:18:07] that's strange it says candy
[1:18:17] born in sin shaped in iniquity
[1:18:20] we would go in that store as such
[1:18:24] clever clever seven eight nine year olds
[1:18:28] and we'd go by the candy counter
[1:18:36] nobody knows we are so clever
[1:18:45] many years later
[1:18:49] we went to make it right with them how
[1:18:52] do you
[1:18:52] know how many candy bars you stole
[1:18:59] this old couple just looked at us
[1:19:02] and said we knew all the time
[1:19:06] what this is not a revelation
[1:19:11] no we knew all the time
[1:19:15] why didn't you do something we did
[1:19:22] what did you do the police here to
[1:19:24] arrest us
[1:19:26] we went home every night and prayed for
[1:19:29] you
[1:19:30] amen
[1:19:34] we live in a world now that the devil
[1:19:35] causes you to do it and then he calls
[1:19:37] 9-1-1
[1:19:40] but you see god works in a different way
[1:19:42] and here was an old couple
[1:19:44] that could have threw the gauntlet as it
[1:19:46] were down on us
[1:19:48] instead they went home and prayed for
[1:19:50] those little
[1:19:51] children that they'd all be saved
[1:19:57] stunning
[1:20:00] just reduce you into a sobbing child
[1:20:05] because you just realized these people
[1:20:08] as much as they always tossled our hair
[1:20:11] when we were little and
[1:20:12] encouraged us now you kids remember you
[1:20:15] do good in school or you'll end up like
[1:20:17] us
[1:20:24] but you see god knows because you see
[1:20:27] what he started he knew that when you
[1:20:30] heard the word of truth
[1:20:34] that you would believe and he knew that
[1:20:37] you would be sealed
[1:20:39] and he knew that that would be the
[1:20:41] earnest of your inheritance
[1:20:44] until the redemption of the purchased
[1:20:46] possession
[1:20:48] he knew he knew saints
[1:20:52] a kid that was stealing candy didn't
[1:20:54] know did he
[1:20:56] all he could think about was i have 50
[1:20:59] cents
[1:21:00] and i'm not going to spend it on candy
[1:21:01] if i can steal it
[1:21:03] now you have to remember you know back
[1:21:05] in them days you could buy gumballs for
[1:21:07] a penny a piece so
[1:21:10] you know it was a different world
[1:21:13] now we'd say well that's nothing but you
[1:21:16] see
[1:21:16] it was all relevant it was all
[1:21:20] relevant
[1:21:23] now you look at this
[1:21:26] the redemption of the purchased
[1:21:28] possession
[1:21:30] you catch the saints are you catching
[1:21:32] what we're looking at
[1:21:34] this and our previous scripture are
[1:21:37] all past tense
[1:21:41] already finished already
[1:21:45] settled has nothing looking to
[1:21:49] if this happens here or if that happens
[1:21:52] there
[1:21:53] all of it is past tense
[1:21:58] amen i hope you catch the significance
[1:22:01] of it
[1:22:03] god with confidence declared it as a
[1:22:06] finished work
[1:22:07] amen now here an unveiling of god
[1:22:12] really good sermon amen really good
[1:22:14] sermon
[1:22:15] yes sir like i changed from husband
[1:22:19] when my child is born then i'm father
[1:22:23] when my grandchild is born i'm
[1:22:25] grandfather see
[1:22:26] but i don't change that's still me
[1:22:29] that's right
[1:22:30] see and that's god and it's
[1:22:34] just i changed my see it's just you
[1:22:36] changed your form
[1:22:37] see notice and nature changes down from
[1:22:40] a young man
[1:22:42] to middle aged to an old man there
[1:22:45] you are you see you just changed your
[1:22:48] form
[1:22:49] now you couldn't say little fellows
[1:22:50] standing up here 16 years old
[1:22:52] say he was a grandfather he couldn't be
[1:22:54] his form has to be changed
[1:22:57] a few years changes it then he becomes a
[1:22:59] grandpa see what i mean
[1:23:01] amen now look at this but he's the same
[1:23:04] person
[1:23:05] all the time the same person god all the
[1:23:08] time
[1:23:09] in the is in this way he reveals himself
[1:23:12] to his people
[1:23:13] in doing this notice through the age of
[1:23:15] the pillar of fire
[1:23:16] re revealed himself to his people
[1:23:20] in the age of jesus he revealed himself
[1:23:23] to his pape
[1:23:24] people in the age of the holy spirit as
[1:23:26] son of god
[1:23:27] son of david he always reveals himself
[1:23:29] in that manner to his people
[1:23:31] making the people to know him
[1:23:35] now we're talking my brother and sister
[1:23:36] not to the whole world we're talking to
[1:23:38] real christians through sons and
[1:23:39] daughters of god god always reveals
[1:23:42] himself
[1:23:43] to his people to his children amen
[1:23:46] it's not god hiding himself and letting
[1:23:49] you guess
[1:23:50] god will reveal himself to you
[1:23:54] hallelujah oftentimes we want to know
[1:23:58] the great secrets before we meet the man
[1:24:00] who wrote them
[1:24:03] come on we want to boast
[1:24:06] we know christ we know christ we know
[1:24:08] christ but we don't even know what he
[1:24:09] read we don't understand what he read
[1:24:11] wrote i mean we don't understand it but
[1:24:13] we want to be able to say we know it
[1:24:16] we know it we know it we know it come on
[1:24:20] could kind of speak some kind of harder
[1:24:22] things
[1:24:23] concerning the day that we live in but
[1:24:25] i'll tell you my brother and sister we
[1:24:26] were just discussing it on the way to
[1:24:28] church you see it's such a paradox
[1:24:30] that people will talk about their
[1:24:33] relationship
[1:24:34] and their experience and how they love
[1:24:36] the lord
[1:24:38] but we'll live a life that's contrary
[1:24:42] to his word see you can't live the life
[1:24:46] contrary to him
[1:24:47] and actually say you know him
[1:24:50] because his nature is just as much
[1:24:54] him as his spirit is
[1:24:59] and john 1 says that the word is him
[1:25:02] so you can't contradict the word and say
[1:25:04] you have him that's right
[1:25:06] it gets a little dicey right you say
[1:25:09] well that's kind of
[1:25:10] that's kind of not very kind well my
[1:25:13] brother and sister
[1:25:14] the truth is we need to get people to
[1:25:16] christ not church that's right
[1:25:18] amen that's right
[1:25:24] he has veiled behind something notice in
[1:25:27] the same way
[1:25:28] or same nature every time god veiled in
[1:25:31] jesus to do the work of redemption at
[1:25:33] the cross
[1:25:34] god could not die as a spirit he's
[1:25:36] eternal but he had to put on a mask
[1:25:38] and act the part of death he did die but
[1:25:41] he didn't do it
[1:25:42] in his god form see that confuses a lot
[1:25:45] of people that's why they want to
[1:25:46] support the trinity
[1:25:47] because they've got to divide god up
[1:25:49] because they don't think our god is big
[1:25:50] enough
[1:25:51] to then make a body go down and dwell in
[1:25:54] that body preach the word
[1:25:56] and then retract himself from that body
[1:25:59] right as the spirit left jesus
[1:26:02] say that don't think that god's big
[1:26:04] enough to do that because they've got
[1:26:06] god
[1:26:06] in saying well we were created in his
[1:26:08] image and we can't do that well i'm
[1:26:09] sorry you're not god
[1:26:12] you're a part of him if the words in you
[1:26:14] but you're not god
[1:26:16] so they're approaching the word of god
[1:26:18] in a humanistic
[1:26:20] mental approach that says this is how
[1:26:23] we can do it this is what we would do
[1:26:26] and if we have the opportunity this is
[1:26:28] the potential of what we do
[1:26:30] and they have totally lost the prospect
[1:26:33] or the
[1:26:33] the understanding of god
[1:26:39] did i confuse you or you're just quiet
[1:26:43] amen
[1:26:46] god veiled in jesus to do the work of
[1:26:48] redemption at the cross god could not
[1:26:50] die as a spirit he's eternal
[1:26:52] but he had to put on a mask and act the
[1:26:54] part of death he did die
[1:26:56] but he couldn't do it in his god form he
[1:26:57] had to do it in the sun
[1:26:59] form as son of man on earth see he had
[1:27:03] to be
[1:27:03] sun form then when he returned on
[1:27:05] pentecost he was son of god
[1:27:07] again see what i mean get the idea he
[1:27:10] was amen
[1:27:11] look at that how god is coming now
[1:27:13] presenting himself
[1:27:15] now you go on in in this message brother
[1:27:17] brown was talking about god in morphe
[1:27:19] right
[1:27:20] how that god come down and he just put a
[1:27:22] mask on as it was in a play
[1:27:24] same god come down from creator amen
[1:27:27] coming all the way down through provider
[1:27:30] healer everything
[1:27:31] he just put on a different mass same god
[1:27:34] amen there was no division of authority
[1:27:37] same god
[1:27:39] amen so as he's putting on this he did
[1:27:41] not change his nature
[1:27:43] saints look at this regardless of what
[1:27:46] he was presenting he didn't
[1:27:48] change his nature and so if god cannot
[1:27:51] change his nature
[1:27:53] he's immutable if he can't change his
[1:27:55] nature he won't change his word
[1:28:00] so we live in a world where everybody
[1:28:02] wants to dice the word up and say well
[1:28:04] we think it should be like this surely
[1:28:05] he meant this
[1:28:06] he meant what he said and said what he
[1:28:08] meant amen
[1:28:10] changing his mass not his nature not his
[1:28:12] word
[1:28:13] same name same physical form
[1:28:17] now look at this i want you to follow
[1:28:19] this right here we'll come down and look
[1:28:21] at this just you and i
[1:28:22] same name same physical form
[1:28:26] but you see god working in us changes us
[1:28:28] from the carnal
[1:28:31] amen yes changes us from the carnal
[1:28:34] changes us to the spiritual but you see
[1:28:38] he didn't stop there because people can
[1:28:39] be spiritual
[1:28:42] and not have all of god people can be
[1:28:45] very spiritual
[1:28:47] and not be even lined up to the word of
[1:28:49] god
[1:28:50] people can talk have gifts speak in
[1:28:52] tongues people can prophesy
[1:28:54] people can have visions they can do all
[1:28:56] of that and be off of the word
[1:28:59] amen so you have to be careful when you
[1:29:01] say well i did this and i did that i
[1:29:03] witnessed this or
[1:29:04] i spoke this i prophesied this that's
[1:29:06] good are you on the word amen so we can
[1:29:10] be changed from the carnal to the
[1:29:12] spiritual
[1:29:13] but the next step that god is working is
[1:29:15] to move us out of the spiritual into the
[1:29:18] supernatural
[1:29:19] and wherever god is the supernatural is
[1:29:21] present that is god working in his word
[1:29:25] so if we say we have the word and it's
[1:29:27] alive but we are all just carnal we are
[1:29:29] all just caught up in the things of the
[1:29:30] world the fashion and the life
[1:29:32] and the nature of the world my brother
[1:29:34] and sister we can say we've got religion
[1:29:36] we've got a spirit on us but we don't
[1:29:38] have the supernatural
[1:29:39] which is supernatural can also if you
[1:29:41] want to allocate it to this sense
[1:29:43] is the holy ghost amen so wherever the
[1:29:45] holy ghost is
[1:29:46] the supernatural will take place lives
[1:29:49] will be changed
[1:29:50] and god will work see one can be
[1:29:52] spiritual without being supernatural
[1:29:55] but see what happens there's a change
[1:29:57] taking place
[1:29:59] god brings us out of the carnal
[1:30:02] that's often times just an incredible
[1:30:04] change is it not
[1:30:06] i mean it's pretty funny i remember one
[1:30:09] time sister jerry and i i won't mention
[1:30:10] where it's at in case you ever meet
[1:30:12] these people
[1:30:13] but uh we were at some folks house and
[1:30:15] and uh i preached at their little church
[1:30:17] and
[1:30:18] and um we're at a house and there's this
[1:30:20] big
[1:30:21] bookcase full of photo albums
[1:30:24] and uh i i just sitting there and i
[1:30:26] wouldn't say i was bored but
[1:30:28] nothing really happening i pulled a
[1:30:29] photo album out i looked through it and
[1:30:31] here it is starts off with their family
[1:30:33] before they're married and
[1:30:34] all this stuff and i'm
[1:30:38] going through there
[1:30:48] the brother's like whoa whoa whoa no
[1:30:50] don't look at those albums
[1:30:55] and it sparked a conversation he goes we
[1:30:58] really shouldn't keep those out in
[1:30:59] public
[1:31:00] i was like you shouldn't
[1:31:05] we got in this conversation he said you
[1:31:08] know a little bit brother paul my wife
[1:31:10] and i keep these
[1:31:10] as a reminder where god brought us from
[1:31:13] their photos when they were first
[1:31:15] married you know before they got saved
[1:31:17] just being like the world he says now
[1:31:20] you skip about the next five or six
[1:31:22] photo albums you can go to the next one
[1:31:25] so i just i love photos i reached down
[1:31:27] there and i pulled that one out and
[1:31:29] here it is and it's like oh
[1:31:32] cool something happened
[1:31:37] and it's like something happened
[1:31:42] next album something's really happened
[1:31:48] next album wow
[1:31:51] something's really happened
[1:31:58] the change is taking place
[1:32:03] god is in our midst working on us
[1:32:07] changing us no longer
[1:32:10] will we boast of being irish no longer
[1:32:14] will we boast of our intellect no longer
[1:32:17] will we boast of anything but christ
[1:32:21] because we recognize without him we're
[1:32:24] nothing
[1:32:26] we're nothing that's right there's a
[1:32:28] brother
[1:32:30] i'll just share this little antidotal
[1:32:31] deal here there's this brother
[1:32:34] lives back in kentucky um
[1:32:38] when sister jerry and i first met him we
[1:32:40] couldn't even understand
[1:32:43] spoke his name we had his name totally
[1:32:46] different
[1:32:47] i mean we were totally totally confused
[1:32:50] we made a comment about brother so and
[1:32:52] so when somebody says
[1:32:53] who's that and we're like you you know
[1:32:54] him and they're like
[1:32:56] that's not his name because he talked
[1:33:00] like he was from way up in the hills of
[1:33:03] kentucky
[1:33:05] and a brother asked him one time he says
[1:33:06] brother you work in the coal business
[1:33:08] what do you do
[1:33:10] i own them
[1:33:17] turns out in the hill country of
[1:33:20] kentucky and west virginia
[1:33:22] even walmart leases land from him for a
[1:33:25] building
[1:33:26] because he owns it all
[1:33:30] whoa brother what's it like to be rich
[1:33:32] he said i don't know
[1:33:33] really nothing's really changed but i
[1:33:36] can tell you what it's like to get saved
[1:33:42] something changed a man that might be
[1:33:44] one brother told me he's worth 100
[1:33:45] million bucks
[1:33:47] he didn't care he wants to tell you
[1:33:49] about how he got saved amen
[1:33:51] you see a change coming over
[1:33:54] but what happens is if satan can get in
[1:33:56] there he causes us to put down
[1:33:59] what it was to get saved and raised up
[1:34:02] the idea of what it'd be like
[1:34:04] to have a lot of money but a real move
[1:34:06] of the holy ghost on a man
[1:34:08] or woman would cause them to put that
[1:34:11] down
[1:34:13] and want to tell you what it was like
[1:34:15] after they got saved
[1:34:17] you see this is the kind of change god
[1:34:19] is working
[1:34:20] he's not taking us to be glorified in
[1:34:23] this world here
[1:34:24] glorified in the eyes of man but as we
[1:34:28] shared
[1:34:28] at the start of our deal it is that we
[1:34:31] would
[1:34:32] whether here or there please him
[1:34:36] amen that's what it's all about
[1:34:39] it's not about how impressed people are
[1:34:42] in the day that we live in
[1:34:44] but it's about whether we are pleasing
[1:34:47] to him you see my brother and sister
[1:34:50] because one can be spiritual and
[1:34:52] not be even saved but you see when the
[1:34:56] change starts taking place
[1:34:58] you see it's like a play i just let me
[1:34:59] finish this out and then we'll
[1:35:01] be done it's like a play you see some
[1:35:04] characters in the play
[1:35:06] and you'll find this is brother branham
[1:35:07] speaking about these things
[1:35:09] some characters in the play they come
[1:35:11] and they play a part
[1:35:13] and then they go off and they come back
[1:35:15] and they play another part and they
[1:35:16] might go off again and come back and
[1:35:18] play another part
[1:35:20] but you see some my brother and sister
[1:35:22] in this great play we call life or just
[1:35:24] called to be carnal
[1:35:26] that's the only part of the play they
[1:35:28] have is just being carnal
[1:35:31] and there's some that are called from
[1:35:32] the carnal part
[1:35:34] and they come back out to play another
[1:35:36] part of the play and that is as a
[1:35:38] spiritual person
[1:35:40] they can tell you what god has done for
[1:35:42] them they can tell you
[1:35:43] how blessed they are they can do all
[1:35:46] these things
[1:35:46] but here this sounds judgment judgmental
[1:35:49] but forgive me
[1:35:50] you can sit there and you will
[1:35:52] experience that and realize
[1:35:53] what they're doing how they're living is
[1:35:55] actually contrary to the word of god
[1:35:58] uh my isaac and i had a tad bit of
[1:36:01] experience like that yesterday
[1:36:03] somebody just oh praise the lord glory
[1:36:05] to god hallelujah all this stuff
[1:36:07] my brother and sister but you look at
[1:36:09] that not judgmental i actually love this
[1:36:10] lady
[1:36:11] but you look at that and realize this
[1:36:13] doesn't line up with the word of god
[1:36:14] but you can't put an edge in sideways or
[1:36:16] a word in sideways
[1:36:18] to talk about any other thing because
[1:36:20] they've got the answer
[1:36:21] so they've come back with the mask of a
[1:36:23] spiritual person
[1:36:24] but my brother and sister that won't do
[1:36:26] it either because just being spiritual
[1:36:28] doesn't mean we line up with the word of
[1:36:30] god
[1:36:32] and i don't honest from the depths of my
[1:36:33] heart you know i'm not saying this
[1:36:35] judgmental
[1:36:36] it's just that is the part that they are
[1:36:38] playing and we know as long as there's
[1:36:39] life there's hope
[1:36:41] amen but now we see some and just to
[1:36:43] kind of shrink this down and not drag it
[1:36:45] all out
[1:36:46] we see some come back again and they're
[1:36:48] called to wear
[1:36:49] a supernatural mass they're called as a
[1:36:52] word be the star of the show or the
[1:36:54] heroine or the hero they're called with
[1:36:56] another mass they come back
[1:36:58] and they come back under another
[1:36:59] anointing they've been through
[1:37:01] everything every one of those has
[1:37:03] but they've come back and by god's grace
[1:37:05] as we've read the scripture to you today
[1:37:07] they're called now from before the
[1:37:09] foundation of the world
[1:37:11] to step into another position that they
[1:37:14] are chosen and predestinated
[1:37:17] and that they have been filled with the
[1:37:19] holy ghost and they have been sealed
[1:37:21] into the day of their redemption
[1:37:23] they're coming back wearing another
[1:37:25] mouse they're not the common church
[1:37:27] they're not the world out here
[1:37:29] they've been called to another part in
[1:37:31] the play and each part of the play if
[1:37:33] you look at it in the natural my brother
[1:37:34] and sister
[1:37:35] requires a little more
[1:37:40] in the human element we would say talent
[1:37:42] or
[1:37:43] some quality right are you following me
[1:37:47] we're certainly not lifting any any
[1:37:49] human abilities up but
[1:37:50] in that the higher the position or the
[1:37:53] more what would you call it uh
[1:37:59] all i can think of is carnal words
[1:38:02] the star of the show
[1:38:06] are you with me
[1:38:11] reminds me i as a kid i got sick i
[1:38:14] didn't
[1:38:15] end up going to the school play thank
[1:38:18] you lord
[1:38:21] but you know what my part in the play
[1:38:23] was give you a little idea with the
[1:38:24] teachers and whatnot thought of me i was
[1:38:28] the guy
[1:38:28] standing at the gate with the spear he
[1:38:31] doesn't move
[1:38:32] he doesn't say anything he just stands
[1:38:35] there and looks straight ahead
[1:38:37] and i remember my teacher saying paul
[1:38:39] you'll be perfect for that part
[1:38:45] yeah see i can talk about this firsthand
[1:38:50] but you see god keeps calling some back
[1:38:54] to another part and another part
[1:38:57] and every one of those parts requires
[1:38:59] more than the previous part did
[1:39:01] every one of those require something
[1:39:03] more a sacrifice
[1:39:05] memorizing part of it was in in the play
[1:39:07] just be honest to the teacher here
[1:39:09] part of it was as paul was horrible at
[1:39:11] memorizing things right so these kids
[1:39:13] all had lines they had to memorize and
[1:39:14] the teachers say now paul what are you
[1:39:16] supposed to say
[1:39:17] ah no you can't have the piece of paper
[1:39:21] paul
[1:39:21] you have to memorize it oh okay
[1:39:27] but you see each one of these is
[1:39:29] requiring a little more
[1:39:32] i want to tell you how god moved this
[1:39:34] morning brother jason sang the songs
[1:39:36] that lined up
[1:39:37] brother trevor got up not lifting these
[1:39:39] up this is god moving in a mess
[1:39:41] brother trevor got up and talked about a
[1:39:43] standard
[1:39:44] standard you see it's god that's raising
[1:39:47] the standard saints
[1:39:48] not just to keep the devil out but for
[1:39:51] the perfecting of his bride
[1:39:54] he keeps raising a standard and she
[1:39:57] keeps
[1:39:57] she can't help it can you explain to me
[1:40:00] why
[1:40:01] you want to meet that standard can you
[1:40:04] explain to me why you wake up in the
[1:40:05] middle of the night and you cry
[1:40:07] tears lord help me
[1:40:11] live your word lord help me lord to live
[1:40:14] up to your word why is that in you
[1:40:18] because god's calling to you is lifting
[1:40:21] you up to a higher standard
[1:40:23] and it's in that my brother and sister
[1:40:25] that you move from just being carnal
[1:40:28] from spiritual and move into the
[1:40:30] supernatural
[1:40:31] and he identifies as supernatural as
[1:40:33] bride according to the scripture
[1:40:35] see now we could go back i want to
[1:40:37] reiterate this again got ahead of myself
[1:40:39] earlier
[1:40:39] we can go back to ephesians 1 and notice
[1:40:41] and looking down through that scripture
[1:40:43] every bit of that is in past tense
[1:40:45] he's already done that work for you and
[1:40:48] i
[1:40:49] hallelujah he's not hoping that you will
[1:40:51] meet up to that
[1:40:52] he's not hoping that you as a as a
[1:40:54] christian will
[1:40:55] someday somehow meet that standard he's
[1:40:57] already made the declaration
[1:40:59] and now he's bringing his will to pass
[1:41:02] that's bringing you to the place
[1:41:04] you're rising to the standard you're
[1:41:06] rising to that position to fulfill that
[1:41:08] word of god
[1:41:09] because you were predestinated you were
[1:41:12] called of god the word says chosen
[1:41:16] could have chose anyone can someone lift
[1:41:18] a hand and say thank you lord for
[1:41:20] choosing me
[1:41:21] amen that's that's what it comes down to
[1:41:24] saints it ain't what we did
[1:41:25] he chose us amen and he says this is a
[1:41:29] part you can play it
[1:41:31] you can you can identify with it now i
[1:41:34] want to just i just want to come along
[1:41:36] that line right here
[1:41:38] now a key notice here as we read that
[1:41:41] this angel come down from heaven having
[1:41:43] a key in his hand i believe it's
[1:41:44] revelation 13 or 19
[1:41:46] we find again another angel coming with
[1:41:48] a key and a key is
[1:41:49] purpose of a key is to unlock something
[1:41:52] something that's been locked up or is
[1:41:54] something that should be locked up
[1:41:56] but a key is given for that purpose now
[1:41:58] there are many kinds of keys because we
[1:42:00] have many uses of keys
[1:42:01] there is keys to the storehouses
[1:42:05] praise the lord
[1:42:08] we have a heavenly vision that said
[1:42:11] we're going to
[1:42:12] store up manna
[1:42:18] some people have their idea what that
[1:42:20] stored up man
[1:42:21] is i'm telling you my brother and sister
[1:42:25] some people have been given a key we
[1:42:28] don't have to wait for someone else to
[1:42:30] unlock
[1:42:31] the storehouse we don't have to follow
[1:42:34] some man's direction
[1:42:36] on what to look for inside of the
[1:42:38] storehouse
[1:42:40] god gave us the key to go to the
[1:42:42] storehouse
[1:42:43] and unlock it for whatever need
[1:42:47] we have right now hallelujah this is the
[1:42:50] age it was stored up for saints
[1:42:53] not for another day far down the road it
[1:42:55] was stored up for today
[1:42:57] and too many people are sitting back
[1:42:59] saying well we're going to wait for
[1:43:00] direction

[1:43:04] been given a key

[1:43:30] then you go pick up a message because i
[1:43:32] like to read as it were more than listen
[1:43:36] i did that last night sister jerry bore
[1:43:38] the brunt of my excitement
[1:43:42] key to the door laying on the little
[1:43:45] bookcase
[1:43:47] and i thought i want to read a little
[1:43:49] something here even just a page or two
[1:43:51] or three before i go to bed
[1:43:53] and now options
[1:43:56] oh there's a cover of one but no book
[1:43:58] marriage and divorce

[1:44:01] months uh
[1:44:03] oh key to the door i sat down
[1:44:08] there are many kinds of keys because we
[1:44:10] have many uses of keys
[1:44:12] there's keys to the storehouses that's
[1:44:15] right
[1:44:16] i got so excited hallelujah somebody
[1:44:20] don't have to bust the lock

[1:44:23] for somebody to come along
[1:44:25] that's going to put the key in and tell
[1:44:27] me this is what it all means
[1:44:31] go i think it's about page 27 or so 25 6
[1:44:34] 7 in your church age book the prophet of
[1:44:36] god talks about we need to pray for
[1:44:38] revelation that's right
[1:44:40] more than anything else hallelujah why
[1:44:44] because it's key it's a key
[1:44:47] it starts unlocking the storehouse we
[1:44:49] don't need to have anybody tell us
[1:44:50] exactly where to go to find it in the
[1:44:52] storehouse or you need to listen to this
[1:44:54] because this is what you need today
[1:44:56] maybe what i need today is different
[1:44:58] than what you need today
[1:45:00] but i've got a key to this storehouse
[1:45:02] there's key to your own house
[1:45:04] right no preacher
[1:45:09] older i get the more upset i get
[1:45:12] when people blame their problems on the
[1:45:14] preacher
[1:45:16] could because i'm a preacher but i don't
[1:45:19] think so
[1:45:20] because you see you hold the key
[1:45:24] to your house i don't have the key to
[1:45:27] your house
[1:45:28] i cannot drive to brother sergey's right
[1:45:30] now and just let me
[1:45:32] let myself in his house i don't have a
[1:45:34] key to his house
[1:45:36] he might tell me where he's got one hid
[1:45:38] but
[1:45:40] you understand
[1:45:44] there's a key to your automobile we call
[1:45:47] them keys and they are keys
[1:45:49] they can be duplicated many times or to
[1:45:51] the house or
[1:45:53] there sometimes can be made what we call
[1:45:55] the skeleton
[1:45:56] key yeah
[1:45:59] in other words it's a key that's
[1:46:02] kind of made with the levers acts on it
[1:46:05] that
[1:46:06] twist the lock in a certain way can
[1:46:08] almost unlock any door
[1:46:10] called the skeleton key have you ever
[1:46:12] witnessed that yeah one time i
[1:46:14] a guy i knew i used the locksmith
[1:46:16] whatever and he was like
[1:46:18] kind of joking he says i want to make a
[1:46:20] bet on how long it'll take me to get
[1:46:21] inside your pickup
[1:46:24] and i thought he don't gamble he's got
[1:46:27] about 10 kids so he ain't got no money
[1:46:30] so there has to be a sure thing going
[1:46:32] here
[1:46:34] and i said i i won't and he went over to
[1:46:36] my vehicle
[1:46:38] and faster than i could figure out what
[1:46:39] he was doing he had my door open
[1:46:42] now saints if you don't lock your house
[1:46:45] and you don't guard the key
[1:46:47] the devil will climb right in and you'll
[1:46:50] come home to a house that's rummaged
[1:46:53] pillaged amen yeah
[1:46:56] our house or even our automobiles can be
[1:46:58] duplicated and then there is a key
[1:47:00] cannot unlock no door
[1:47:02] and here's the part i got a little
[1:47:04] excited about
[1:47:08] that's it are you seeing it saints
[1:47:12] any key cannot unlock
[1:47:16] no door until it's used
[1:47:19] by a man amen
[1:47:32] and unlock it
[1:47:37] because you see let me say something
[1:47:38] very brash and bold here
[1:47:41] if i had a key to your spiritual house
[1:47:46] there would not be one of us dragging
[1:47:49] old ugly baggage behind us
[1:47:52] there would not be one of us that would
[1:47:53] be dragging fears and bitterness
[1:47:56] there would not be one of us because if
[1:47:58] i had the key to your spiritual house
[1:48:01] we would unlock it and we would clean it
[1:48:04] out
[1:48:06] but i don't hold that key you do
[1:48:12] you have to pick up the word of god you
[1:48:15] have to unlock it
[1:48:17] you have to then walk over to the
[1:48:19] storehouse
[1:48:20] and unlock it do you realize every son
[1:48:23] or daughter of god's got a key to that
[1:48:25] storehouse
[1:48:27] in spite of some people acting like
[1:48:30] there's only a handful of keys in this
[1:48:32] message to unlock the storehouse
[1:48:34] i'm here to tell you i've got the words
[1:48:36] of a prophet that gave that authority to
[1:48:39] me to you
[1:48:39] and to everyone that desires a closer
[1:48:42] walk with the lord
[1:48:46] the key in itself cannot use
[1:48:49] itself it's got to have something to
[1:48:52] yield the key hallelujah
[1:48:57] is change happening oh lord
[1:49:00] help us take the key and unlock it amen
[1:49:03] oh my
[1:49:05] yes
[1:49:08] let's see whether we want to go on to
[1:49:10] this or call it quits
[1:49:15] i think we should read it is that okay
[1:49:18] another another couple minutes here
[1:49:22] that's it we in him
[1:49:27] then we being in him we are still veiled
[1:49:31] to the religionists and professors of
[1:49:33] the world
[1:49:34] see our glory that we have and enjoying
[1:49:36] right because we got a key to the
[1:49:37] storehouse
[1:49:39] we are still veiled to them outsiders
[1:49:42] they think we're crazy and not
[1:49:44] again see see that's right but we
[1:49:47] who are in here in christ baptized into
[1:49:50] him first corinthians 12
[1:49:52] and to him we are partakers of this
[1:49:55] glory does that know what the scripture
[1:49:56] says
[1:49:57] amen see this is not just oh this is
[1:49:59] what you believe this is the bible
[1:50:01] see but not on the outside you're still
[1:50:04] looking in
[1:50:05] denying it see so now we are invited
[1:50:08] into him to be partakers of
[1:50:10] all that he is were invited into him
[1:50:13] which
[1:50:13] is hid to unbelievers by the veil
[1:50:17] of human flesh
[1:50:25] by the veil of human flesh i can still
[1:50:28] find your faults
[1:50:30] i can still see your mistakes if you
[1:50:33] were really
[1:50:34] the bride of christ if you were really a
[1:50:37] son
[1:50:38] of god if you were really a daughter of
[1:50:40] god
[1:50:43] but they're looking at the veil
[1:50:48] because they can't see no further
[1:50:59] so now we are invited into him to be
[1:51:00] partakers of all he is
[1:51:02] we're invited into him which is hid to
[1:51:05] unbelievers by the veil of
[1:51:07] human flesh they know that glory
[1:51:11] see this is what i was talking about
[1:51:13] earlier they know that glory they read
[1:51:16] of it
[1:51:17] it's in the word the glory of god and
[1:51:18] things like that it's just
[1:51:21] a word to them
[1:51:24] amen to us it's a manifestation see
[1:51:28] it's more than a word it's reality
[1:51:33] this goes back i made reference of this
[1:51:35] earlier i kind of forgot i'd actually
[1:51:36] put it in here
[1:51:37] god said let there be light that was the
[1:51:40] word
[1:51:41] but now there is light it ain't the word
[1:51:44] it's light
[1:51:44] see what i mean we don't have to go back
[1:51:46] and say will this be fulfilled
[1:51:48] it is fulfilled now
[1:51:51] isn't just a written word to us it's
[1:51:53] reality we're
[1:51:54] in him now we're enjoying now we behold
[1:51:57] him now we see him the word manifesting
[1:51:59] himself
[1:52:00] it's hid out there because why it's
[1:52:02] veiled
[1:52:03] in human flesh
[1:52:06] just as it was when jesus was there and
[1:52:09] come right down in their midst my
[1:52:10] brother and sister
[1:52:11] you understand some people say this is
[1:52:13] just mythology but it will make the
[1:52:15] point to you
[1:52:16] they had it figured out exactly how the
[1:52:19] messiah
[1:52:20] was going to come they had him coming in
[1:52:24] such a fashion
[1:52:25] that all they were looking for was that
[1:52:28] particular thing but here he come
[1:52:32] veiled in human flesh born under
[1:52:35] a circumstance that they could not
[1:52:38] comprehend they said this is
[1:52:39] illegitimate this
[1:52:41] is wrong but what they couldn't
[1:52:42] understand was that
[1:52:44] seed that pure word of god could not
[1:52:47] come in any human relationship
[1:52:50] of a mixing of cells and a blood borne
[1:52:53] and a seed
[1:52:54] and coming forth through sex and a human
[1:52:57] deliverance my brother and sister it had
[1:52:59] to be the pure word of god
[1:53:00] so there could be no other uh way to
[1:53:03] bring it
[1:53:04] no other depiction no other deal but the
[1:53:07] way god chose to do it
[1:53:08] they could look at that and say oh my
[1:53:11] goodness he's illegitimate
[1:53:12] and he can't possibly be and now he's
[1:53:15] claiming
[1:53:16] he is the son of man that he is
[1:53:19] a child of god when he says i and my
[1:53:22] father are one
[1:53:23] he's blasphemous but they didn't even
[1:53:27] realize they were talking
[1:53:29] to god himself
[1:53:35] and so it is in the 21st century
[1:53:44] i don't know why i like to read articles
[1:53:46] like this maybe it's
[1:53:47] because i'm crazy
[1:53:52] but when i see these articles talking
[1:53:53] about this my brother and sister
[1:53:55] i won't mention the name because i don't
[1:53:56] want to mark the man as it were
[1:54:00] but there's a man who has repeatedly
[1:54:03] lied to
[1:54:04] his churches has been caught in
[1:54:08] all kinds of discrepancies and all kinds
[1:54:11] of carnal things
[1:54:14] and as of last year people still
[1:54:17] sent his little church something to the
[1:54:19] tune of 74 million bucks
[1:54:22] because he stands up there and says if
[1:54:24] you send me money god will bless you
[1:54:31] enough people believe him add up to 74
[1:54:34] million bucks
[1:54:37] then he begged him for more money so he
[1:54:39] could buy a nicer jet
[1:54:41] because he had a dream from god of him
[1:54:43] flying in a brand new falcon x
[1:54:48] well if we're going to get into the
[1:54:49] dreams i had a dream here a while back
[1:54:54] now you know guys don't want to do that
[1:55:02] okay
[1:55:04] yeah sorry about that but you see my
[1:55:07] brother and sister
[1:55:09] then you have a man or men stand up and
[1:55:11] preach
[1:55:13] the word directly from the bible
[1:55:16] and they want nothing to do with him
[1:55:20] why because that spirit that's on them
[1:55:25] identifies with the spirit that's on
[1:55:27] them
[1:55:29] and the reality of it is they don't want
[1:55:30] god
[1:55:32] they want money
[1:55:35] that has become their god
[1:55:38] and some people control is their god
[1:55:43] and some people notoriety
[1:55:46] or fame or influence is their god
[1:55:50] you see the devil's got this lovely
[1:55:52] smorgasbord and he just lays it out
[1:55:54] and he lays it out and people are coming
[1:55:57] they're attracting to what
[1:55:59] will give them what they want but did
[1:56:02] you realize going back
[1:56:04] in our scripture without going back to
[1:56:05] quote them
[1:56:07] he said i chose you before the
[1:56:09] foundation of the world
[1:56:11] to be in me holy
[1:56:14] and righteous
[1:56:18] and if god said i've chose you he never
[1:56:21] wrote no names my name's not wrote down
[1:56:23] where i can just go see it your name's
[1:56:25] not wrote down where you can go
[1:56:26] see it but there's something in you that
[1:56:29] says my name is wrote on that
[1:56:32] that is me he's talking about and i
[1:56:35] am going to fulfill that you see it's no
[1:56:39] if you give me i'll give you god says
[1:56:42] i already gave it to you i already gave
[1:56:45] you the opportunity
[1:56:46] to go take a hold of this word
[1:56:50] and live it and be made completely whole
[1:56:54] and besides that the keys that once were
[1:56:57] only peter's keys are now
[1:57:02] your keys and you can unlock the word of
[1:57:05] god
[1:57:06] and by revelation understand amen what
[1:57:09] he's saying
[1:57:10] isn't that beautiful saints hallelujah
[1:57:13] because you see we are in him now we're
[1:57:16] enjoying now we behold him now we seem
[1:57:18] the word manifesting himself it's hid
[1:57:20] out there because why it's veiled in
[1:57:23] human
[1:57:24] flesh i'm so glad that god come down and
[1:57:26] said i'm going to identify
[1:57:28] myself with you amen sister emmy would
[1:57:31] you come
[1:57:32] hallelujah god bless our visitor
[1:57:36] amen
[1:57:40] brother jacob why don't you just lead us
[1:57:42] in these songs here brother jay
[1:57:44] you know they kind of were on my heart
[1:57:46] but if you want to deviate from that
[1:57:47] list you can
[1:57:49] you can just go right ahead hallelujah
[1:57:53] god bless you saints love you today amen
[1:57:56] easter that was last week wasn't it
