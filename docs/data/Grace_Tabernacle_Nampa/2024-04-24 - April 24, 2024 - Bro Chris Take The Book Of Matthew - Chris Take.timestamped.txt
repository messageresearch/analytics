[36:42] amen if you have your Bibles tonight
[36:43] let's turn to Matthew chapter 9 my
[36:46] apologies to the sound guys I thought
[36:48] Alex was back there so he has several
[36:50] text messages that won't do us any good
[36:52] now um but we're going to go to Matthew
[36:55] chap 9 verse 1-13
[37:10] Matthew chapter 9
[37:15] verse1 and he entered into a ship and
[37:18] passed over and came into his own City
[37:21] and behold they brought to him a man
[37:22] sick of the paly lying on a bed and
[37:25] Jesus seeing their faith said unto to
[37:27] the sick of the py son be of good cheer
[37:31] thy sins be forgiven thee and behold
[37:34] certain of the scribes said within
[37:36] themselves this man
[37:38] blasphemeth and Jesus knowing their
[37:40] thoughts said wherefore think you evil
[37:42] in your hearts for whether is easier to
[37:45] say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say
[37:48] arise and walk but that you but that ye
[37:51] may know that the son of man hath power
[37:53] on Earth to forgive sins then saith he
[37:56] to the sick of the he arise take up thy
[37:59] bed and go into thy house and he arose
[38:02] and departed to his
[38:04] house but when the multitude saw it they
[38:07] marveled and glorified God which had
[38:09] given such power unto them and as Jesus
[38:13] passed forth from then he saw a man
[38:16] named Matthew sitting at the receip of
[38:19] custom and he saith unto him follow me
[38:23] and he arose and followed him and it
[38:26] came to pass as Jesus sat at meat in the
[38:29] house behold many publicans and sinners
[38:31] came and sat down with him and his
[38:32] disciples and when the Pharisees saw it
[38:35] they said unto his disciples why eateth
[38:37] your master with publicans and Sinners
[38:40] and when Jesus heard that he said unto
[38:42] them they that be whole need not a
[38:46] physician but they that are sick but go
[38:50] ye and learn what that meth and th will
[38:53] have mercy and not sacrifice for I am
[38:57] not come to call the righteous but
[38:59] Sinners to repentance may the Lord bless
[39:02] the reading of his word you can be
[39:04] seated
[39:06] tonight I was reading in my devotions
[39:09] just a couple days ago and and I read
[39:12] Matthew chapter N9 and you know in in
[39:17] verse 9 there when Jesus calls
[39:20] Matthew Matthew being uh a humble and
[39:23] and um
[39:28] careful man doesn't spend time on
[39:32] himself he keeps the
[39:34] focus on Jesus and his life and and the
[39:37] gospel and and and so I I was thinking
[39:41] about Matthew and and here he is he's a
[39:44] tax
[39:45] collector and I mean he's got everything
[39:49] going for him he has the protection of
[39:51] the Roman Empire he is an elected
[39:54] official he has he's making good money
[39:58] and
[40:00] seemingly all is is is in his
[40:03] favor but leading up to this in this
[40:06] verse something began to happen in the
[40:09] life of
[40:10] Matthew and
[40:12] he his whole life there was something he
[40:17] wanted and his whole life there was
[40:20] something missing he he had a desire to
[40:24] to fill the void and and he he didn't he
[40:27] didn't didn't fit in as a Jew because he
[40:28] was a tax collector I mean look at zakus
[40:31] and and everything that he went through
[40:33] and he was a Publican and he he he he
[40:36] spent time with these people and
[40:39] and here he is and and and Jesus walks
[40:42] by and and Jesus just just got done he
[40:46] he gets in the ship he comes over to his
[40:49] own City and he and he and he sees a man
[40:52] that's sick and he reaches down and he
[40:54] says you know I forgive you your sins
[40:56] and that's the first thing that he deals
[40:58] with and we know that brother Brandon in
[40:59] the in the line would say hey if you
[41:01] come here without
[41:03] sin dealt with the the holy spirit is
[41:06] going to expose that because it needs to
[41:08] be taken care of right so the man is is
[41:12] Forgiven and he he's given his healing
[41:16] and and the Pharisees or the scribes
[41:20] just I mean they're never
[41:22] happy no matter what Jesus did they were
[41:26] never happy
[41:28] he heals a man they ridicule him for
[41:30] healing him he didn't heal a man they
[41:31] ridicule for not healing him he heals on
[41:33] the Sabbath they accuse him of breaking
[41:35] the Sabbath he doesn't heal on the
[41:37] Sabbath and they accuse him
[41:39] of just everything
[41:43] after a one thing after the other and
[41:47] his disciples are are were were all men
[41:49] of of you know they weren't the upper
[41:52] class they weren't the people that
[41:54] everyone said hate those guys are
[41:57] fitting for Disciples of Christ you have
[42:00] Peter and you had had Andrew and and
[42:03] John you know maybe maybe John had a
[42:05] little bit of favor with with some of
[42:07] the the Pharisees there but still he's
[42:09] the son of a fisherman and and they just
[42:13] they're the they're the ones who who
[42:14] might be at synagogue and might not
[42:16] because maybe they found a way to get
[42:18] around the rules of the Sabbath and get
[42:20] some more fish and and so these are
[42:23] these are who that Jesus is surrounded
[42:25] by and Jesus himself not to mention was
[42:28] was a a a bastard child from their
[42:30] Viewpoint you know it didn't have a
[42:32] father speculations of whatever was a
[42:34] Roman soldier or something passing
[42:36] through Nazareth and and then again what
[42:38] can what good could even come of
[42:40] Nazareth because we all know that place
[42:41] is just the scum of the earth so this
[42:44] definitely is not the prophet and and
[42:48] then Joseph and and Mary and and so this
[42:51] is this is the the view the world has of
[42:54] Jesus and I and I know tonight this is
[42:56] this is simple and stuff we all already
[42:59] know or we should know but I think
[43:01] sometimes I know I know sometimes we
[43:04] have to be reminded what it the point
[43:08] is brother bram's Ministry came to
[43:11] reveal what Jesus
[43:15] Christ so when the word came sunset
[43:19] Mountain The Sword in his hand the the
[43:21] opening of the word the third poll the
[43:24] the messages preached the the rejection
[43:26] of his Ministry and all of these things
[43:29] and the Seven Seals they all were did
[43:31] one thing they exposed more of Christ
[43:37] amen
[43:39] and we receive the word and we receive
[43:43] Revelation but that understanding in the
[43:47] back of the book what is it that that
[43:50] final when you get to the final seal all
[43:52] of the book is open amen it's the last
[43:55] one now there's all of the book
[43:57] you see to fight all of the darkness God
[44:00] needed all of his word in your life so
[44:04] when we get to that point if it was like
[44:06] a journey you know we learn about Jesus
[44:08] dying on the cross and we progress and
[44:10] we find the word of God and we
[44:12] understand more of it and and and we
[44:14] understand these things like the seals
[44:16] and what it was in Revelations what he
[44:17] was talking about and and the condition
[44:20] of the world and where we are in the
[44:21] church ages and how this all fits all
[44:24] that does is circle back around to point
[44:27] us to Jesus Christ that's right yes sir
[44:30] and there are four books in the Bible
[44:31] that we call the gospels that are all
[44:33] about Jesus Christ now he's with through
[44:36] the whole Bible you understand but this
[44:38] is what he did how he lived and this is
[44:41] where we are
[44:43] today because as it was in the days of
[44:46] the son of man so shall it be or right
[44:49] today in our day so we are not to become
[44:54] Pharisees with the knowledge of the
[44:55] message we we are not to become
[44:57] Sadducees with the knowledge of the
[44:59] message we are not to become publicans
[45:02] with the knowledge of the
[45:03] message the word of God should be
[45:06] Revelation that then brings a life with
[45:10] it amen there should be no issue me
[45:12] Brother David talking about this the
[45:13] other day there should be
[45:15] no blocker or nor issues in explaining
[45:18] the Seven Seals to a 13year old or a
[45:20] 12year old it's Jesus Christ and there's
[45:24] scriptures that bring all of this in to
[45:27] a to a to a a view and then lay this out
[45:30] for us to see but this right here is
[45:32] where we walk every single day amen
[45:36] there's Pharisees and there's Sadducees
[45:38] yet what do we have today we have a well
[45:39] this church and that church and we don't
[45:41] talk to that church and we can't agree
[45:43] with them and I'm not talking about
[45:46] doctrinal issues I'm talking about
[45:47] personality
[45:48] problems and and we come to church and
[45:51] we say well you know we're the christas
[45:52] preaching again and we turn our ears off
[45:54] and or or the pastor well if I was the
[45:56] pastor I would do it this way and and
[45:58] and all we are doing is acting like
[46:01] Pharisees well Jesus you know I almost
[46:05] believed him but then he healed the man
[46:07] on the
[46:08] Sabbath I mean you know what the one
[46:10] from Heaven would not do that there is
[46:12] no way you see we got the message and we
[46:15] got the Bible and then we interpret it
[46:17] through our ideas and that's the kind of
[46:20] stuff that we talk about that's right
[46:22] the whole point and the whole focus of
[46:24] everything that we do as Christians is
[46:27] Jesus Christ not just the man Jesus or
[46:31] or the deity Jesus Christ but Jesus
[46:33] Christ in us living through us when we
[46:36] go in the grocery store and we see
[46:38] somebody who's
[46:40] struggling we should look at them like
[46:42] Jesus look at Matthew say come follow me
[46:45] amen you have been given a power as a as
[46:48] a child of God you have been given a
[46:50] power don't abuse it you are a son of
[46:54] God you are a daughter of God by the way
[46:56] in in English classical English he is
[46:59] both so when we say son of God that
[47:02] includes for you sisters the world has
[47:03] messed it up today but anyways that's
[47:06] how it's supposed to be amen so I can
[47:08] say he and you just fill in the blanks
[47:11] but so God has called you to to this
[47:14] position and and and we are not to to to
[47:18] to spit to to we are not to just
[47:22] reiterate knowledge of of phrases and
[47:25] and just re repeat scriptures and repeat
[47:29] quotes all that gets us is is the
[47:32] knowledge without the
[47:34] life and I you know we
[47:38] we've we just
[47:40] become like this and and here we we here
[47:42] we have Matthew and I mean never mind
[47:45] the guy Jesus heals the man of the py
[47:49] and and all they can do is well how dare
[47:53] he forgive their sin his sins how how
[47:56] dare he operate you know he's a
[47:58] blasphemer and then and then and then he
[48:00] calls Matthew and and now we have a new
[48:03] member in the church and what are we
[48:04] we're not excited we're
[48:06] upset him come
[48:10] on him they walk through the back door
[48:13] and you look at them and you say if they
[48:14] would dress better then I would accept
[48:16] them in the sanctuary I'm sorry did God
[48:19] make you judge
[48:23] no he says judge not that you be not
[48:26] judged amen amen he didn't say Don't
[48:29] Preach the word he said don't
[48:32] judge and we have to be careful with
[48:34] that because we can go too far to say
[48:36] well don't judge me I'll live all I want
[48:38] but a child we're talking about child of
[48:40] God not talking about those people out
[48:42] there we're talking about CH you us
[48:45] right here me you and our viewpoints and
[48:48] we get in the flesh because we're not
[48:50] praying enough and and and we act like
[48:53] this these people so God heals somebody
[48:55] and we we're just upset
[48:57] because well you know praise the Lord
[49:00] they got
[49:01] healed but you know they go to that
[49:03] church so that's what we think and
[49:06] and I'm guilty
[49:09] amen what's the point why why are we do
[49:13] do we change a church because God leads
[49:15] us to or do we change a church because
[49:17] we are unhappy with the situation we are
[49:19] unhappy with then it's just politics and
[49:21] we're swapping community centers says
[49:24] well I don't want to go to NAA Community
[49:25] Center anymore so I'm going to go to
[49:26] colge well yeah that's right and or you
[49:29] live in Green Leaf and you're like well
[49:30] no way I got to go to the Boise so you
[49:33] drive
[49:34] through Caldwell Nampa Meridian Cuna
[49:38] Eagle all it boisey now if God LED you
[49:41] there by all means praise God go and do
[49:44] it but why is there this mentality that
[49:47] God cannot call this I don't know where
[49:50] this is coming from but God cannot call
[49:51] a pastor to move four blocks down and
[49:54] start a church why is that an issue
[49:57] cuz we're building
[49:59] kingdoms Jesus said go you into all the
[50:02] world and preach the gospel baptizing in
[50:04] the name of the Father the Son and the
[50:06] Holy Ghost and these shines shall follow
[50:08] them that
[50:10] believe amen Paul he in his letters to
[50:14] Corinthians or the Galatians or Romans
[50:17] or uh
[50:19] Ephesians you know he gets after them he
[50:22] tells them look it's not politics it's
[50:25] not about all of this and and and or
[50:28] it's not about letting why are you
[50:29] letting this man in he's blasphemed the
[50:31] Holy Spirit he's he's the disruptor to
[50:33] the church and and and then he he closes
[50:35] the letters with can't wait to see you
[50:37] again I love you we're sending a brother
[50:40] to see you a brother's on his way give
[50:43] this brother my greetings you know
[50:45] brother brandham in the story of Perry
[50:47] per Green's testimony the only thing
[50:48] that I can remember from that testimony
[50:50] I watched it a young age I could go back
[50:52] I guess but um one thing I remember is
[50:54] is brother Bram telling Perry green I
[50:56] don't I remember who the men were it
[50:57] doesn't matter but he was telling them
[50:59] you know how all the things that they
[51:00] had terrible things they had done to him
[51:02] and his ministry and his reputation and
[51:04] and all of this stuff and they're on a
[51:06] long drive road trip and and they pull
[51:08] into a gas station and brother B says oh
[51:10] by the way those guys you're talking
[51:11] about they live up around the corner we
[51:12] should go say hi to them say God bless
[51:14] them and Perry Green's like are you
[51:17] kidding me like you just told me all the
[51:18] stuff about how ter how terrible they
[51:20] are which that's not what he was saying
[51:21] but all the things they did to you and
[51:23] you want to reach out to
[51:25] them saints of God we have fallen
[51:28] short we have fallen short for for for
[51:31] for a man of his position and and you
[51:35] people couldn't tell him his enemies
[51:37] apart from his
[51:39] friends and and we say oh praise God we
[51:41] have the seals and and and brother you
[51:43] need to preach deeper than that brother
[51:45] mam said learn your ABCs first and and
[51:47] then we'll move on from there and you
[51:49] and you wonder why what happens is why
[51:51] why people get the knowledge of of of of
[51:54] of the seals and in if they get the
[51:56] knowledge of it they try to tell you
[51:59] about it and it doesn't make any sense
[52:01] and they don't live the gospel they have
[52:03] a revelation of it they tell you about
[52:05] it you says oh that's that's um that's
[52:08] Matthew chapter 8 or that's Matthew
[52:10] whatever that's Luke or that's Mark
[52:11] right it's relatable because it's Christ
[52:14] but if it's just knowledge they're
[52:16] repeating what they have
[52:18] heard it doesn't make any sense you
[52:21] can't explain the gospel of Christ you
[52:24] live the gospel of Christ you preach the
[52:26] gospel of Christ start under the
[52:27] anointing of what
[52:29] Revelation so the Pharisees and the
[52:31] Sadducees I mean nobody knew the message
[52:33] better than
[52:34] them nobody did right right they knew
[52:38] the quotes and the paragraphs and they
[52:40] could talk about it they they knew all
[52:43] of it and they could talk about it yet
[52:45] when Jesus came and said blessed are
[52:48] those they said no man speaks like this
[52:52] man that's right why because Jesus was
[52:55] talking about himself self and when you
[52:58] have a revelation of Jesus Christ in
[52:59] your day to you personally and you talk
[53:02] about him you're talking about yourself
[53:05] am you've been there you've met him amen
[53:09] you're not you're not you know the two
[53:11] Runners that that went the one Runner
[53:13] said let me run let me run let me run
[53:14] and job says you don't have a message he
[53:16] says let me run let me run so he runs
[53:18] for what to get out of breath and and
[53:22] then he's just you go stand to the side
[53:24] wait till the messenger actually comes
[53:26] but he wanted to be important and that's
[53:28] what happens we want to be important so
[53:30] we start talking about stuff or we start
[53:31] preaching about stuff we don't have a
[53:33] revelation of that's right and and what
[53:36] we have nothing we have there's no life
[53:39] there the man had a message but he's
[53:41] like yeah I think this and maybe that
[53:42] happened and I thought I saw this and
[53:45] that's how we
[53:46] sound that's how we sound well I think
[53:48] brother B was talking about the third
[53:50] polling and then he said this over here
[53:51] and we just say third pole and Seven
[53:52] Seals and people think we know what
[53:54] we're talking
[53:55] about and then we go outside and we
[53:58] don't even act like Christians we don't
[54:00] even treat each other like Christians
[54:03] but we're message and it's not even that
[54:06] but we go to this church first I mean
[54:09] most people first time you meet them I
[54:11] didn't know this is going to come out
[54:13] like this the first time you meet them
[54:14] say where were you what church are you
[54:15] from now I'm guilty of that too but a
[54:18] lot of times it's because I want a
[54:19] little bit of a background
[54:20] check but but that being said we still
[54:23] have to give the person the benefit of a
[54:25] doubt
[54:26] I'm I mean a secular man he's a he's a
[54:28] well he's not secular but he's not a
[54:30] Believer he's denominational Christian
[54:33] he gave me the best advice I ever heard
[54:35] which you know we say that but there's
[54:36] been we hear things and sometimes it
[54:38] doesn't stick okay so he said it and
[54:40] it's stuck he said always assume the
[54:42] best of people always assume always
[54:45] assume good
[54:47] intentions you see if you really had the
[54:50] faith that the Holy Spirit would lead
[54:51] you and you met somebody you wouldn't be
[54:53] afraid of their viewpoints that's right
[54:56] amen
[54:56] the reason you're afraid of their
[54:58] viewpoints is because you don't even
[54:59] know what you believe that's right I was
[55:02] fellowship with a brother and he was
[55:03] talking about some cousins he have that
[55:05] he has that are that are a part of this
[55:07] church and and so he said well why don't
[55:09] you you know agree with them I don't
[55:12] know we just don't well what do you
[55:14] believe that's different I don't know
[55:16] they're just
[55:18] wrong that's not just one little that's
[55:21] an issue that's a you w't talk about a
[55:24] pandemic that's a pandemic right well I
[55:26] don't know we just don't agree what the
[55:28] reason you don't know is because you
[55:29] don't know what you believe do you know
[55:32] what you
[55:33] believe the Pharisees and Sadducees
[55:35] thought they knew but then Here Comes
[55:37] Jesus and and I I read this I read the
[55:39] scripture here of the scribes who said
[55:41] within the this man blasphemeth and the
[55:43] first thing that came to my mind was he
[55:45] was doing what they knew they should
[55:47] do but they couldn't bring their
[55:49] themselves to do
[55:50] it you see where you have two workers
[55:53] and and one just you know he kind of
[55:55] doesn't always do it the right way and
[55:57] then you get hire the new guy and the
[55:58] new guy's got pep and ambition and and
[56:02] and quickly the other guy realized is
[56:04] wow I'm really falling short and if he's
[56:06] got character about him he'll pick it up
[56:09] if he doesn't have character he'll start
[56:10] pointing his finger at the guy who's
[56:11] actually doing the
[56:14] job and all this comes from what people
[56:17] not in their positions right that's it
[56:21] why do you go to now this is this is
[56:23] just an example why do you go to that
[56:25] church they can't tell you why why do
[56:29] you live there they can't tell you why
[56:32] people get really really funny about you
[56:35] know if you move you know we I have
[56:36] friends who have moved from places and
[56:38] they're just like why would you leave
[56:39] this church you know down in down in
[56:42] Phoenix and they move somewhere else and
[56:44] people are like well why and it's like
[56:46] well it this isn't the only the only
[56:49] church this isn't just where the bride
[56:52] of Christ is this is this is just not
[56:54] the ministry God has for me anymore
[56:56] anymore so I'm going to go over here and
[56:59] if we didn't care which brother Ron
[57:02] doesn't but if we didn't care about who
[57:05] was in our church and who wasn't in our
[57:08] church that wouldn't matter but we care
[57:11] why do we care about that why do we care
[57:14] about what position we hold in the
[57:15] church now if it's something burning on
[57:17] your heart you should care if it's a
[57:20] position you have that God called you to
[57:21] you should care you should you should
[57:23] you should have honor in that position
[57:24] and hold forth to God what God has given
[57:28] you but if we're unhappy we say well we
[57:30] don't want to just sit on the Pew we
[57:32] want to do this why why do you want to
[57:36] do
[57:36] it what exactly Brother David what is
[57:39] your motive and objective I the quote
[57:42] we'll read this quote here and and
[57:44] brother Bram he
[57:46] says he says we'll come back to the
[57:48] quote I'll read the end of it just right
[57:49] now Jesus didn't pay any attention to
[57:51] that he had one thing to do that was the
[57:54] will of God he went moving on Eve the
[57:58] Garden of Eden if she would have had one
[58:00] intent follow the will of God she would
[58:03] have not stopped and talked to the devil
[58:10] right your brother or your sister's not
[58:12] the devil that's
[58:14] right but you stop in your mind in your
[58:17] vain imaginations you stop and you talk
[58:19] to the devil he says well that person
[58:24] yeah yeah you know me me and my wife
[58:26] dealt with something she she just had
[58:27] some difficult times in her pregnancy
[58:29] and and I have to be honest with you
[58:31] there were some times there where I was
[58:32] very
[58:33] afraid and I was like Lord is this you
[58:35] are you preparing me for something and
[58:38] and everything that I went through I
[58:40] just all of the sudden the Lord just
[58:42] actually I I the last time I preached
[58:44] after I preached it was just like it
[58:48] lifted and and I just look back and I
[58:51] realized every element of that so-called
[58:55] uh premonition or or or or uh is that
[58:58] the right word premonition was all based
[59:00] on
[59:02] fear and I said devil you were
[59:04] whispering in my ears and I listened to
[59:07] you sorry move on and he did because if
[59:12] you resist the devil he will flee and
[59:14] even the devil and his angels are
[59:16] subject to the word of God so the Bible
[59:19] says resist the devil he will flee guess
[59:21] what you resist he looks in the
[59:22] scripture and he says all right angels
[59:24] He resisted let's go
[59:26] he has to he hates the word of God
[59:29] because he has to listen to it amen so
[59:33] it lifted and I realized it was all
[59:35] based on
[59:37] fear and so the point I'm trying to make
[59:39] is many times we he says well I have a
[59:41] word of the
[59:42] Lord and we don't go back to
[59:46] check to check it it just
[59:49] feels right we're in the church and and
[59:51] there's anointing and it feels right and
[59:53] we're at home and and there's a song on
[59:55] and it feels right or or we're at home
[59:58] and it feels right but then you take it
[59:59] through the word you take it through the
[1:00:01] filter of the Holy Ghost and it falls to
[1:00:06] Pieces why don't we do that amen why do
[1:00:09] we you know why well the answer is is
[1:00:11] the answer to the question is easy and
[1:00:13] I'm not asking you to answer the
[1:00:14] question I'm asking you to
[1:00:17] ponder next time you come to this place
[1:00:21] CU we all need it from the greatest to
[1:00:23] the least we all need the reminder the
[1:00:27] will of God only and move on Amen Jesus
[1:00:32] had to constantly fight that that's
[1:00:35] right when the Pharisees would come to
[1:00:36] him and tempt him he he you know brother
[1:00:39] Bon was
[1:00:40] preaching and he said he was talking
[1:00:42] about an incident where a man was just
[1:00:43] being basically you know kind of just
[1:00:46] rude about the word and argument
[1:00:49] argumentative I don't know if it was to
[1:00:50] brother brandom or something brother bam
[1:00:52] read but he
[1:00:53] says and I tell you I wish I had had one
[1:00:56] minute with that guy I'd set him
[1:00:58] straight and the and he stopped and he
[1:01:00] says oh the Lord didn't appreciate
[1:01:03] that you see even the
[1:01:06] prophet wasn't allowed to just go out
[1:01:08] and set that man straight and here we
[1:01:11] are amen and that's what we
[1:01:15] do we don't always go to the person a
[1:01:17] lot of times it's in our in our heads
[1:01:19] and we just set them straight in our
[1:01:21] heads and and now every time you this is
[1:01:23] the problem every time you deal with
[1:01:25] that person you are filtering it through
[1:01:28] what you have decided their intentions
[1:01:30] are you're not fil so when they do
[1:01:34] things or they you know look away while
[1:01:36] you're talking they're just looking
[1:01:38] because there was a person walked and
[1:01:39] something caught their attention you
[1:01:40] think oh they don't care what I'm
[1:01:41] talking
[1:01:44] about don't take your Halos off you can
[1:01:48] pick them back up later brother Ivan
[1:01:49] will have them for you when you
[1:01:52] leave so we should have one focus in the
[1:01:55] well let's read this quote now and I
[1:01:57] apologize that we don't have it and I
[1:01:59] imagine somebody run and told the priest
[1:02:01] so he's talking about this because later
[1:02:03] on in the Book of Matthew which by the
[1:02:05] way the title tonight is the Book of
[1:02:07] Matthew later on down in this chapter
[1:02:10] Jesus he he heals gyrus his
[1:02:14] daughter and so brother bam is
[1:02:17] referencing that in this sermon the
[1:02:18] healing of gyrus his daughter and he
[1:02:21] says I imagine somebody run and told the
[1:02:22] priest and here they all come down oh
[1:02:25] drama right let's go set I mean we got
[1:02:27] to get down there this is happening and
[1:02:30] well we'll see what he can do now we'll
[1:02:32] just look around Let's test his
[1:02:35] religion let's see what he believes if
[1:02:38] he don't believe according to our
[1:02:39] Doctrine we won't have nothing to do
[1:02:41] with him do you realize Jesus was
[1:02:43] preaching the Scrolls They Knew by heart
[1:02:45] he was living the Scrolls They Knew by
[1:02:48] heart and they couldn't see it and don't
[1:02:51] just say well their eyes are blinded
[1:02:53] they were but we can be the same
[1:02:55] condition and and the children of God
[1:02:57] with our eyes open but we can't see the
[1:03:00] beam in our eyes so we judge it through
[1:03:03] our own experiences rather than the word
[1:03:05] of God and he says well this is the way
[1:03:07] it is and that's how it is and we base
[1:03:09] it off that and we go years in that
[1:03:11] position and we never stop to say God
[1:03:14] what do you think about that God is this
[1:03:17] the right attitude to have any attitude
[1:03:20] like this is wrong just so you know amen
[1:03:22] I don't believe you know we'll go down
[1:03:24] and see that you you're starting off on
[1:03:27] the wrong foot they got exactly what
[1:03:29] they expected right you go to a church
[1:03:32] service or you come to church or maybe
[1:03:33] you have issues because sometimes the
[1:03:34] devil will come to us and whisper in our
[1:03:37] ear and we stop and we listen and then
[1:03:38] every time we come to church and the
[1:03:40] pastor preaches we have an issue okay
[1:03:43] that happens to child children of God
[1:03:46] sons of God what we have to do is we
[1:03:48] have to we have to trust the Lord to
[1:03:50] show us that happened and then when he
[1:03:54] shows us the devil's EXP
[1:03:56] and we're free amen you want to change
[1:03:58] the world around you start by changing
[1:04:01] yourself as soon as you start to look to
[1:04:03] your brother or look to your sister and
[1:04:05] say if they would change this would fix
[1:04:09] you got a beam in your eye because you
[1:04:11] look to your brother you look to your
[1:04:13] sister you say Lord oh forgive me I'm
[1:04:15] not praying hard enough for them
[1:04:19] amen I'm not reaching out enough to them
[1:04:26] the culture we live in and this is
[1:04:29] probably mostly towards the people who
[1:04:31] are online more often you know what
[1:04:34] everybody's anointed whether they're
[1:04:35] online or not the condition of the world
[1:04:37] we live in today the anointing of the
[1:04:38] world we live in today is very much all
[1:04:40] about me yes sir so we have to deal with
[1:04:45] that every day that's
[1:04:47] right every day we get up the devil's
[1:04:51] going to say you need to take better
[1:04:53] care of yourself and what is his
[1:04:55] definition of that it's not the word of
[1:04:58] God it's a nap or a fictional book or a
[1:05:03] movie or a a different song or dinner
[1:05:08] out
[1:05:10] or and does it help M you wake up the
[1:05:14] next day hung
[1:05:15] over from the
[1:05:17] world said man I feel even worse than I
[1:05:20] did yesterday so you try again and the
[1:05:23] Lord's then the Lord reminds you and
[1:05:24] says you know when you're tired you need
[1:05:26] to do the thing you least want to do
[1:05:28] right you want to do it okay when I
[1:05:30] would do good evil was present with me
[1:05:33] Paul says so you want to do it but it's
[1:05:35] the least thing your flesh wants to do
[1:05:38] your flesh doesn't want to sit there and
[1:05:40] read in the Bible about how it needs to
[1:05:42] straighten
[1:05:44] up your flesh wants to partake of
[1:05:46] something that appeases it that's right
[1:05:50] and the spirit of Christ within you is a
[1:05:52] gentleman that's it so he'll just send
[1:05:54] you little love notes
[1:05:57] the flesh demands I need this and I need
[1:06:00] it
[1:06:02] now just one time don't get what you
[1:06:04] asked the waitress for and you'll see
[1:06:06] what your flesh wants that's it still
[1:06:09] times don't change very much he says
[1:06:12] anyhow we'll just find out what he
[1:06:13] believes and if he don't come just to
[1:06:15] our hueing line now Pharisees and
[1:06:18] Sadducees we're in the same church okay
[1:06:22] so don't cast this outside of the walls
[1:06:24] of the church we can have this attitude
[1:06:27] today and if he don't come just to our
[1:06:29] heing line we won't have him in our
[1:06:31] synagogues he never says Doctrine he
[1:06:34] doesn't talk about the doctrine he says
[1:06:35] right to our heing line in other words
[1:06:37] our view of the same thing our view our
[1:06:40] opinion on the scriptures a lot of times
[1:06:43] these things that are AR call cause
[1:06:45] arguments and and have caused issues and
[1:06:48] for me between me and our brothers you
[1:06:51] know God's had to deal with with me so
[1:06:53] I'm being fully transparent tonight have
[1:06:56] nothing to do with our
[1:06:58] salvation but goodness we will die on
[1:07:00] that
[1:07:02] hill and in doing so offend our brother
[1:07:06] the Bible says a brother offended is
[1:07:08] harder to be one than a walled
[1:07:12] City
[1:07:14] amen have you ever besieged a walled
[1:07:18] City NOP well we have cuz we've all
[1:07:21] offended a Breen at some point there's
[1:07:24] none of them Fanatics so he says we
[1:07:25] don't and if we don't just come come
[1:07:28] just to our Hing line we won't have him
[1:07:29] in our synagogues there's none of them
[1:07:32] fanatic Revival is going to be around
[1:07:34] here of Healing The Sick and things we
[1:07:36] won't cooperate with him one bit I know
[1:07:39] Peter the fisherman he's a good friend
[1:07:40] of mine and I know I knew Matthew the
[1:07:43] publicans so forth the same as Levi I
[1:07:45] knowed him the tax collector good honest
[1:07:48] boy I knowed him real well but he's come
[1:07:50] over here now to start a Revival you see
[1:07:53] he's saying we can have the same
[1:07:55] attitude and they were happy as long as
[1:07:57] Matthew was a
[1:07:58] Publican but as soon as he joins up with
[1:08:01] this man Jesus and starts living a clean
[1:08:04] and Godly life well he joined up with
[1:08:08] them so that was too
[1:08:10] bad never mind he's not doing drugs
[1:08:13] anymore never mind he's not out
[1:08:15] carousing with women and running the
[1:08:16] streets never mind he's got a he's got a
[1:08:18] stable job and a good family no we don't
[1:08:21] care about that he's going to the wrong
[1:08:24] church and we're
[1:08:27] upset I don't know this is maybe it's
[1:08:29] for people like
[1:08:31] you but he's come over here now to start
[1:08:34] a Revival and first thing we're going to
[1:08:35] test his Doctrine and find out what he
[1:08:39] believes then we'll see whether we can
[1:08:42] cooperate with him or
[1:08:45] not well I mean that sounds
[1:08:49] okay check his
[1:08:51] Doctrine but that was just a final
[1:08:53] excuse to make their attitude to to to
[1:08:56] uh give credibility to their bad
[1:08:58] attitudes oh well do Doctrine brother to
[1:09:02] can't you
[1:09:03] know was it Amos can't can't be yolked
[1:09:06] together you if you know if you
[1:09:09] disagree so we just drive bigger wedges
[1:09:12] and I'm not trying to preach some kind
[1:09:13] of
[1:09:14] unity that's you know dogmatic or do
[1:09:17] denominational I'm just talking about we
[1:09:20] just have different views on on things
[1:09:23] things like you know dancing in church
[1:09:24] or or or getting excited or or whatever
[1:09:27] like whether you dance or you don't
[1:09:30] doesn't mean anything and it doesn't
[1:09:32] mean you're going to whether you believe
[1:09:33] it's okay or you don't believe it's okay
[1:09:35] it doesn't mean you're one or the
[1:09:37] other's not going to go in the
[1:09:38] Rapture it's just your view your opinion
[1:09:41] you're it's the way you like it you know
[1:09:43] say well we need to have the songs this
[1:09:44] way now and and as long as we stay
[1:09:48] within the confines of the word of
[1:09:51] God that's what matters but I'm not
[1:09:53] talking about breaking
[1:09:56] truth right I'm not talking about
[1:09:58] breaking truth but we use that excuse
[1:10:02] well it's false Doctrine what is false
[1:10:05] Doctrine I don't
[1:10:07] know it's just not the right way well
[1:10:09] and then you get down to the B very very
[1:10:12] very bottom of it and it's like oh okay
[1:10:14] you know they had this over there and
[1:10:16] you weren't
[1:10:17] invited so now here we are 20 years
[1:10:20] later I I know of congregations that
[1:10:23] were Bound by this spirit for 30 30
[1:10:25] years or more that's right and it took
[1:10:28] the work and the patience of a Gods sent
[1:10:31] man to slowly for 10 to 15 years for God
[1:10:36] to turn turn the big
[1:10:38] ship do we want to waste time doing that
[1:10:42] I want to go home I'm ready for a
[1:10:44] Rapture okay well if I was ready we
[1:10:47] wouldn't be here right but you know what
[1:10:49] I'm say what I'm saying I'm ready to
[1:10:50] stop worrying about all of this and to
[1:10:52] just get my
[1:10:54] life it if we would just focus more on
[1:10:57] our own lives and what we need from God
[1:10:59] and we would come to church and we say
[1:11:01] God I I just I need you I need you to
[1:11:03] speak to me and and actually brother bam
[1:11:06] says to pray for your brother and God
[1:11:07] will meet your needs so maybe I need to
[1:11:09] rephrase that we say God speak to your
[1:11:12] people God coming and and ministering
[1:11:14] and on Monday we say God it's Monday
[1:11:16] most of the Believers are at work and
[1:11:18] they're doing this Lord calm down and
[1:11:20] you'll get on fire praying for
[1:11:23] them and they're the ones already on
[1:11:30] fire you see the gospels of Matthew Mark
[1:11:34] Luke and
[1:11:37] John I was talking to my wife the other
[1:11:40] day and maybe a little bit of righteous
[1:11:45] indignation and I don't mean this
[1:11:47] harmful in any way whatsoever you just
[1:11:49] wonder sometimes why people come to
[1:11:52] church I want you to come to church I
[1:11:55] don't care what your struggles are I
[1:11:56] don't care your viewpoints come to
[1:11:57] church because this is a special place
[1:11:59] that God has set aside that's right for
[1:12:02] you for you to be spoken to so maybe
[1:12:04] your life's a mess but you come to
[1:12:06] church God is here maybe life's not at
[1:12:08] maybe God's not in your home but God is
[1:12:10] here yeah so come to church but some
[1:12:15] people you want to ask them why do you
[1:12:17] come to church what is your what's the
[1:12:20] what's the goal we have come to the
[1:12:23] place where we have a bunch of method
[1:12:25] meist message Believers we have a bunch
[1:12:27] of Catholic message Believers not that
[1:12:30] they came from Catholicism they were
[1:12:32] rais in the message but they walk on
[1:12:36] their knees up to the you know
[1:12:39] hypothetically speaking they they they
[1:12:40] skin their knees on the dirt coming to
[1:12:42] church and because they're doing a
[1:12:44] Catholic Penance and and they and they
[1:12:47] they they whip themselves and and it's
[1:12:51] just there's there's no there's no
[1:12:54] fruits gained in it or they or they're
[1:12:57] methodists and everyone has to be you
[1:12:59] know if you're going to sing you got to
[1:13:01] have a choir's robe
[1:13:03] on don't get up there and sound like a
[1:13:06] you
[1:13:08] know sound like a cat with its tail
[1:13:11] caught never mind the Holy Spirit fell
[1:13:14] down and everybody was just
[1:13:16] blessed but you didn't have a choir
[1:13:18] robes so we can't hear you
[1:13:22] sing or you didn't keep it to 30 minutes
[1:13:24] or you didn't didn't keep it to 15
[1:13:26] minutes or you preached Too Short don't
[1:13:28] you know goodness but the Bride Can
[1:13:29] preach all night well but did did God
[1:13:33] have make his did God say what he wanted
[1:13:36] to say yeah well what and then you know
[1:13:39] no matter what you do they're mad but
[1:13:41] then God comes and God speaks and then
[1:13:43] when God speaks it doesn't matter how
[1:13:44] long it is and they miss that that's
[1:13:46] what he's saying it doesn't matter how
[1:13:48] long if it's short or if it's long when
[1:13:50] God is speaking it doesn't matter to the
[1:13:52] elected bride of Jesus Christ but we put
[1:13:56] a Time Li and say well if they really
[1:13:57] were revelated they would preach for 3
[1:14:00] hours if they really revelated they
[1:14:02] would do
[1:14:05] this and here we are in the Book of
[1:14:07] Matthew here we are in the Book of Mark
[1:14:09] and Luke and John and Jesus is just out
[1:14:12] there doing the will of God never mind
[1:14:14] what they had to say you know what they
[1:14:16] want to do Jesus disciples come to him
[1:14:18] and says well can we just call fire down
[1:14:20] on them they don't agree with us they
[1:14:22] don't believe you they call you be why
[1:14:24] not
[1:14:26] Jesus says
[1:14:28] oh you've missed the point have I been
[1:14:32] so long with you right that's what he's
[1:14:34] saying when we act like that he looks at
[1:14:37] us and he says have I been so long with
[1:14:40] you I mean when was when when did The
[1:14:42] Sword come down to brother Bam's hand 80
[1:14:46] 70 something years ago you know the
[1:14:49] message begin to take root and and where
[1:14:50] are we
[1:14:52] today where we are
[1:14:55] is the seed shall not be able to
[1:14:59] Shu so God anoints his ministers to
[1:15:03] preach down the
[1:15:05] line for you to first of all shuck
[1:15:10] what's holding you down and to weed it
[1:15:16] out that's 11th Hour worker we that's
[1:15:19] what we're here doing we're
[1:15:21] weeding we're weed eating and you can't
[1:15:23] use a weed eater weed eater cuz you'll
[1:15:27] break the wheat you go in there with the
[1:15:29] string trimmer and you just start going
[1:15:31] to town guess what you're going to cut
[1:15:32] the wheat and that's what happens when
[1:15:34] ministers get
[1:15:36] upset they go to with the stram Timmer
[1:15:38] says well y'all just a bunch of
[1:15:41] devils he got the wheat the weed but he
[1:15:43] also got the
[1:15:45] wheat we have to go through and handpick
[1:15:48] because it's all mixed together just
[1:15:50] break it up break it up break it up
[1:15:52] separate it gent gent gently gently
[1:15:55] gently a little bit of more love here oh
[1:15:57] this wheat kind of wrapped around this
[1:15:59] tear so be real gentle as you
[1:16:02] separated and don't break the
[1:16:04] weed that's where we are today there is
[1:16:07] no one-size fits all and we can't judge
[1:16:10] a person's condition because we are not
[1:16:12] God we can see and say yeah they have
[1:16:15] some growing to do yes of course if if a
[1:16:18] if a young lady or a young man comes
[1:16:19] into church and they're dressed like the
[1:16:20] world of course it's obvious but don't
[1:16:25] judge them and say well yeah there ain't
[1:16:27] nothing there CU they wouldn't dress
[1:16:29] like that if there was no give them time
[1:16:32] that's right give them time instead what
[1:16:34] we want is we want conformism we want
[1:16:36] them to come to church all right I like
[1:16:37] this church I'm going to keep coming
[1:16:38] here we want them to come the next time
[1:16:40] with hair down to their ankles dress
[1:16:43] modestly it doesn't always work that
[1:16:45] way and and I know I know right this is
[1:16:50] this that's the norm but we still have
[1:16:53] these things once in a while where it
[1:16:54] gets under our skin and we get prickly
[1:16:58] we get prickly why are we we're not
[1:16:59] getting enough rain we're not getting
[1:17:01] enough water in our lives amen because
[1:17:04] we're so busy being Christians yeah
[1:17:09] amen we're not called to be
[1:17:13] Christians we're called to serve the
[1:17:15] Lord we're called to have a relationship
[1:17:19] with Christ Christian means Christlike
[1:17:22] if you're trying to be Christlike you're
[1:17:24] going to fail time but if you're trying
[1:17:27] to yield to Christ then they'll call you
[1:17:31] Christian but see Christian is a word
[1:17:34] and it has a definition and so we try to
[1:17:37] align ourselves and others to that
[1:17:40] definition and that definition is
[1:17:41] different depending on which church you
[1:17:43] go
[1:17:44] to because if you're a real Christian
[1:17:48] you
[1:17:49] know you'll run around the church or if
[1:17:52] you're a real Christian you will
[1:17:55] I I can't think of any examples so maybe
[1:17:57] that's the Lord but you understand what
[1:17:58] I'm saying but if you're if you get
[1:18:01] anointed you get excited goodness don't
[1:18:02] sit there and hold it back run the
[1:18:04] aisles because you're just expressing
[1:18:08] Christ and sometimes our bodies Can't
[1:18:10] Hold Us can't hold
[1:18:15] still but let's be like imagine Matthew
[1:18:18] that's kind of where we
[1:18:20] were Matthew he gets called this this is
[1:18:23] what I want you to remember when God
[1:18:25] walked up to the tax Booth you were
[1:18:27] sitting in counting the Wagers of
[1:18:29] everyone that owed
[1:18:31] you says well they did this they did
[1:18:35] this they hold this they need to pay
[1:18:37] this much that's all Matthew
[1:18:40] did they'd come and I can pay this much
[1:18:43] I can only pay this much take his
[1:18:46] kids no please no sorry you got to pay
[1:18:49] the bills you got to pay your
[1:18:52] taxes well I just started a business and
[1:18:54] no take his business take it
[1:18:57] all no we don't care you got to pay now
[1:19:00] but the crop is no crop comes whatever
[1:19:03] good we'll get the money give it to me
[1:19:05] that was his life that's what he did and
[1:19:08] to have a man he knew who Jesus
[1:19:11] was he came to the city he was from the
[1:19:15] Bible says to his own
[1:19:18] City and he walked through imagine that
[1:19:22] imagine that you actually as a tax
[1:19:25] collector were living in the city of God
[1:19:27] and you didn't even know
[1:19:28] it and then God came along and says you
[1:19:31] don't belong to them you belong to me
[1:19:34] you were always part of him you were
[1:19:36] always part of his City but he had to
[1:19:39] call you imagine Matthew in this
[1:19:41] position and who he was and you know he
[1:19:43] had to hide on his way to work because
[1:19:45] if they caught him in the alley they'd
[1:19:46] really give it to
[1:19:48] him and he gets to work and now now he
[1:19:50] has the protection of the Romans and he
[1:19:52] he's got a you know he's locked in there
[1:19:54] nobody can break in and heard him and
[1:19:55] he's now he's bold right and this was
[1:19:57] Matthew and then Jesus Walks By The Man
[1:19:59] He's heard so much about and when he
[1:20:01] heard about Jesus this was you and I
[1:20:04] when we heard about Jesus something in
[1:20:06] our hearts amen jumped that's John in
[1:20:10] the womb of your soul leapt amen and
[1:20:14] come to
[1:20:16] life and you
[1:20:18] said there's something about that and
[1:20:20] then Jesus walks by and and says Matthew
[1:20:25] follow
[1:20:27] me he called him by
[1:20:30] name Matthew follow me what did you
[1:20:35] do what did I do we're here tonight we
[1:20:40] said okay Lord I'm
[1:20:43] coming I'm coming Jesus probably made
[1:20:46] him run a little bit too wait don't
[1:20:47] leave me you would run why God wants to
[1:20:50] see your desperation God wants to see
[1:20:53] how much you're willing to put on the
[1:20:55] line to serve him because he wants all
[1:20:57] of it on the line
[1:21:03] amen since we're in the Book of Matthew
[1:21:06] in in in chapter 8 I believe it is the
[1:21:09] Centurion comes to Jesus and I was
[1:21:11] reading this the other day and and it
[1:21:14] just struck me it's it's
[1:21:17] um Matthew 8 verse 5 and when Jesus was
[1:21:21] entered into capernum there came unto
[1:21:23] him a centurion in beseeching him so
[1:21:26] that being said about Matthew he's the
[1:21:28] man who wrote this book right how is he
[1:21:30] going to write it he's a lion anointing
[1:21:34] Matthew was he knew what it was to be
[1:21:36] the worst of the
[1:21:38] worst to be in that position not right
[1:21:41] somebody who was noted Rich had
[1:21:44] everything going for him and to turn
[1:21:46] their his back on that so his life
[1:21:48] drastically changed Peter and them they
[1:21:51] were fishermen I don't know they
[1:21:52] probably did a lot of sleeping Outdoors
[1:21:54] already
[1:21:55] not not I'm not demeaning their
[1:21:56] testimony at all but I'm saying this is
[1:21:58] the view this is the person that God
[1:22:01] wrote the book
[1:22:03] through amen and when Jesus was entered
[1:22:06] into Capernaum there came unto him a
[1:22:08] centurion beseeching him and saying Lord
[1:22:10] my servant lieth at home sick of the
[1:22:13] py grievously
[1:22:15] tormented and Jesus saith unto him I
[1:22:18] will come and heal him now I did a quick
[1:22:20] search but the amount of times where
[1:22:22] Jesus says I'll come I'll come I'll come
[1:22:25] heal him he waits for them usually to
[1:22:28] ask yes sir but Jesus knew the Centurion
[1:22:31] had the faith to say no you just speak
[1:22:33] the word so he tested him the Centurion
[1:22:37] didn't have to say anything more he
[1:22:38] could have just said okay he didn't he
[1:22:41] had he could have just agreed with Jesus
[1:22:43] but Jesus was testing his faith you God
[1:22:47] sees your faith and what does he do he
[1:22:50] doesn't this is a bit tongue and cheek
[1:22:52] he doesn't reward it he tests it amen he
[1:22:55] sees your faith for your healing and he
[1:22:57] tests it he makes you worse amen he sees
[1:23:00] your faith for deliverance and he really
[1:23:02] puts the has the devil come down he
[1:23:05] really puts you through the ringer and
[1:23:08] he sees he sees you're you're you're
[1:23:09] getting you know you have the faith to
[1:23:11] just be a support and and what does he
[1:23:15] do he sends somebody to just offend you
[1:23:18] in church he's testing your faith if
[1:23:21] your Faith's being tested it's because
[1:23:22] Jesus Christ sees your her faith amen
[1:23:25] and it's identified to him so he's
[1:23:27] testing
[1:23:28] it I think brother stepen on Sunday said
[1:23:31] it beautifully to show you sometimes
[1:23:34] what you're capable of as a child of God
[1:23:37] Abraham probably didn't realize the
[1:23:39] faith that he had in Jehovah but God put
[1:23:41] it to the test God knew what was in
[1:23:44] Abraham's heart he knew his faith so he
[1:23:47] tested
[1:23:48] it it's like in school you know the
[1:23:51] teacher sees you're doing real good so
[1:23:52] he gives you a big old quiz you're
[1:23:54] thinking my goodness I thought it was
[1:23:56] doing good exactly and you go to the
[1:23:59] test and you test 100% and guess what he
[1:24:01] promotes you you see we want to be
[1:24:04] promoted without the
[1:24:06] test we want to be lifted up high
[1:24:09] without very good right the backside of
[1:24:12] the desert very good
[1:24:14] sir we want to be Matthew without being
[1:24:17] a tax
[1:24:18] collector we want to be the one right
[1:24:21] and then we you know how many people
[1:24:22] wanted to be Paul in the early days wow
[1:24:24] Paul you know yeah he did all this but
[1:24:26] look where he is now and then look at
[1:24:29] the price he had to pay not on his death
[1:24:32] that was the easy part surrender to God
[1:24:34] hey I'm going to Glory but sitting in
[1:24:36] prison chained to a Roman I mean a
[1:24:40] miserable life for the past few years
[1:24:41] but what did he do he just wrote the
[1:24:43] word of
[1:24:45] God the beauty that comes from our lives
[1:24:49] when God puts us to the test and he
[1:24:52] crushes the olive right the oil comes
[1:24:55] forth so he says I will come and heal
[1:24:58] him theeran answered and said Lord I am
[1:25:00] not worthy that thou should us come
[1:25:02] under my roof but speak the word only
[1:25:04] and my servant shall be healed for I am
[1:25:07] a man under Authority having soldiers
[1:25:09] under me and I say to this man go and he
[1:25:11] goeth and to another come and he cometh
[1:25:14] and to my servant do this and he doeth
[1:25:16] it when Jesus heard it he marel and said
[1:25:18] to them that follow verily I say unto
[1:25:20] you I have not found so great faith no
[1:25:23] not in his Israel you see the Centurion
[1:25:26] understood speaking from Authority right
[1:25:31] we we we in our we we we want to be that
[1:25:34] in that position we want to you know
[1:25:37] speak with authority brother you have to
[1:25:40] know where you're speaking from first
[1:25:43] right you can't just decide to speak
[1:25:45] with authority you have to have the
[1:25:49] authority you have to have and the only
[1:25:51] way you get that is when you go through
[1:25:55] boot
[1:25:56] camp why did the Centurion know that
[1:25:58] because he was a
[1:26:00] centurion that's how he knew okay so
[1:26:03] because he was a centurion he understood
[1:26:05] speaking with authority now let's fast
[1:26:07] let's rewind his life to come to that
[1:26:10] position to come to the place of a
[1:26:13] centurion what did he have to go what
[1:26:15] battles did how many times did he have
[1:26:17] to barely escape with his
[1:26:20] life from the
[1:26:22] enemy then the the the hard that he was
[1:26:24] put through to become a Roman soldier
[1:26:26] and then work his way through the ranks
[1:26:29] to now be in that position and that was
[1:26:32] where he was written of in the book you
[1:26:34] see we want to just skip to the part
[1:26:36] where we're written of in the book and
[1:26:38] we don't want to put in the Blood Sweat
[1:26:40] and Tears to get to that position amen
[1:26:44] says oh Lord just take me and use me and
[1:26:47] he's like he's looking at you and he's
[1:26:50] and he's saying I'm trying to do just
[1:26:52] that but you're in the way
[1:26:56] so you know what he does he doesn't
[1:26:58] Throw the Clay Away he pounds it to
[1:27:02] dust and you say oh goodness God do you
[1:27:06] even love
[1:27:08] me and he says yes that's why I pounded
[1:27:11] you to
[1:27:13] dust it pleased the father to bruise
[1:27:18] himen why did it please this is just you
[1:27:20] know there's all these different angles
[1:27:22] but here's a little food for thought as
[1:27:23] we close why did it please him to bruise
[1:27:27] him in bruising him he gave you your
[1:27:31] healing that's right he was in bruising
[1:27:35] him he erased your iniquity amen he was
[1:27:38] bruised for our
[1:27:40] transgression it pleased the father why
[1:27:43] because the father knew if I bruise him
[1:27:47] if I beat him if I put him on the cross
[1:27:51] then I have access to you amen
[1:27:55] it pleases God to bruise you to strike
[1:27:58] you down because why when he does that
[1:28:01] the only thing that can rise from those
[1:28:04] ashes is somebody in the spitten image
[1:28:08] of Jesus
[1:28:10] Christ to get the last bit of gold last
[1:28:14] bit of junk out of the gold it's got to
[1:28:16] be hammered hard hammered
[1:28:20] down oh when the heat first starts it's
[1:28:24] kind of
[1:28:25] cozy and the Lord just slowly turns it
[1:28:28] up
[1:28:29] yeah and if we're not careful we let the
[1:28:31] devil whisper in our ears we stop and we
[1:28:33] listen and we say yep my life's just
[1:28:36] harder than somebody
[1:28:39] else's and really the devil's doing that
[1:28:42] because he knows you're this close to
[1:28:43] Victory that's
[1:28:45] right everything with brother Danny
[1:28:47] steam he said if the devil was going to
[1:28:50] kill you he wouldn't have told you about
[1:28:52] it he would have just did it
[1:28:58] amen if you weren't a child of God he
[1:29:00] wouldn't bother telling you you
[1:29:03] aren't it's a waste of his breath he's a
[1:29:06] very he's a very particular he's not a
[1:29:09] Time
[1:29:10] waster his time is
[1:29:15] limited we give him too much
[1:29:18] credit amen let's bow our
[1:29:23] heads Heavenly Father Lord
[1:29:26] Jesus Lord this just rings so
[1:29:32] true Lord the end of this quote Prophet
[1:29:36] said he had one thing to do and that was
[1:29:38] the will of God and he he went moving on
[1:29:42] Lord help us not to
[1:29:45] stop not if it's not your will help us
[1:29:49] to to bypass it to to to not even give
[1:29:51] it a second thought to not hang out out
[1:29:54] there Lord and I'm not talking about the
[1:29:57] bar I'm talking about those vain
[1:29:59] imaginations that slip in under the guys
[1:30:02] of
[1:30:03] Christianity and cloak themselves with
[1:30:05] the Robes of the
[1:30:08] preacher cloth themselves in a modest
[1:30:12] attire in a business suit and we stop
[1:30:14] and we listen and says what do you have
[1:30:16] to say but it's
[1:30:18] just vain imaginations it's not your
[1:30:22] word it's it's not edifying whatsoever
[1:30:25] things are pure whatsoever things are
[1:30:27] just think on these
[1:30:29] things Lord you you brought it down
[1:30:32] directly in your
[1:30:34] word but God we strive every day to
[1:30:39] surrender more to
[1:30:41] you because we maybe had an episode like
[1:30:44] this we're not written off we're still
[1:30:47] your
[1:30:49] sons but we have to change Lord that has
[1:30:52] to change we can't just excuse it and
[1:30:54] say well I'm still a son so no God when
[1:30:57] you show us it give us the Zeal give us
[1:31:01] the desire to attack it to to put our
[1:31:05] effort down there to to annihilate the
[1:31:08] amorites not to to leave a little baby
[1:31:11] and leave a little oxen and it's okay
[1:31:14] it's just a little pride it's just a
[1:31:16] little no it's the devil help
[1:31:20] us to scour it out our lives our homes
[1:31:23] everything Lord to we want to come up to
[1:31:25] a higher Place Lord
[1:31:27] Jesus because we love you and you love
[1:31:30] us and and and what a beautiful
[1:31:33] relationship what a beautiful world we
[1:31:36] live in oh
[1:31:38] the those out there they they think they
[1:31:40] know what a beautiful world is but
[1:31:43] they until someone walks in the presence
[1:31:46] of God With You Lord they'll never know
[1:31:49] nothing like it and that's what we want
[1:31:52] Lord but we get distracted we lose our
[1:31:54] focus and we walk out and and next thing
[1:31:56] you know we're over there in the corner
[1:31:57] of the Garden of Eden talking to the
[1:32:00] devil talking to our
[1:32:02] flesh and we give in and now you have to
[1:32:06] come and set us
[1:32:08] straight Lord one of these days
[1:32:11] though 1% better every
[1:32:15] day one of these
[1:32:17] days will'll have fought the last
[1:32:20] battle because every day Lord because we
[1:32:23] are children of God there's a promise in
[1:32:25] your word that says we shall
[1:32:28] overcome we shall overcome Saints
[1:32:31] there's a promise in the word that you
[1:32:32] shall overcome now that isn't a free
[1:32:35] pass that is encouragement to say keep
[1:32:38] pressing on keep pressing on the devil's
[1:32:42] going to whisper in your ear that's
[1:32:43] never going to go away temptation is
[1:32:45] going to come at you that's never going
[1:32:47] to go away you're going to live with
[1:32:48] pride the rest of your life but when you
[1:32:51] don't give
[1:32:52] in when you don't give
[1:32:55] in there's a promise in the word says
[1:32:58] you shall overcome and we take that
[1:33:02] promise Lord we take that promise maybe
[1:33:04] we put it on the shelf and we said well
[1:33:06] I'll use that for when I really feel
[1:33:07] like a Christian help us to pick it back
[1:33:09] up Say No by your grace and your grace
[1:33:14] alone father we shall
[1:33:18] overcome the battle is the Lord's
