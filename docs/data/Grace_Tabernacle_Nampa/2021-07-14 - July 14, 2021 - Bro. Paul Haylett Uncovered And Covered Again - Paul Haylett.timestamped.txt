[27:18] that i take
[27:21] they follow wherever
[27:25] i go
[27:28] [Music]
[27:30] my sheep know my
[27:34] [Music]
[27:39] what a stranger's voice today
[27:47] my sheep
[27:50] know my voice
[28:04] they abide in the form
[28:11] and they go
[28:15] [Music]
[28:24] because
[28:27] i have made
[28:31] they're my choice
[28:43] for my sheep
[28:46] know my voice
[28:52] my sheep know my voice
[28:56] and the valley of death
[29:00] through which i shall lead them
[29:04] someday
[29:08] but no danger
[29:12] and touch one of them
[29:16] for i will be with them
[29:20] away
[29:23] my sheep
[29:27] know my voice
[29:41] [Music]
[29:46] and they go
[29:50] not astray
[29:54] they love
[29:58] me because
[30:01] i have me
[30:05] and my joy
[30:09] and they fall oh
[30:14] my god for
[30:18] my sheep
[30:21] [Music]
[30:26] are you happy tonight to be identified
[30:28] as one of god's sheep
[30:31] amen nothing more precious than that
[30:33] amen
[30:34] you know i've often said and certainly
[30:36] it's not my thought alone but
[30:39] we live in a day that has a tremendous
[30:42] identity crisis and uh people
[30:45] are are being identified or identifying
[30:49] themselves
[30:51] in very interesting fashions
[30:54] and um you know in the in this world
[30:58] that we live today
[31:00] we we look at this and it seems like
[31:04] and i want you to catch this don't don't
[31:07] make a quick
[31:08] assumption it seems like the world is
[31:11] just going absolutely crazy
[31:15] you notice i said seems like
[31:18] but do you realize they're actually just
[31:20] fulfilling
[31:21] the word of god so it's not really
[31:25] about their insanity
[31:30] it's about a prophetic word that has
[31:32] come
[31:33] and said this is what the world's going
[31:35] to look like
[31:37] this is what my bride is going to look
[31:40] like
[31:41] and as we go into this scripture this
[31:43] evening you're going to
[31:45] i hope catch upon a couple of these
[31:48] scriptures here
[31:50] that very much uh just breaks it right
[31:53] down
[31:54] so that we can see why
[31:57] the world views you like you do like
[32:00] they do
[32:01] and why you view the world like you do
[32:05] amen to to see that so god bless you
[32:08] brother vasily
[32:09] good to see you home amen uh just um
[32:15] always good to be back amongst amongst
[32:18] the saints
[32:19] amongst the people i want to speak to
[32:21] you this evening
[32:22] on uncovered and covered
[32:25] again and um we'll just uh
[32:29] go to the word thank you uh musicians uh
[32:32] brother jason
[32:33] uh amen just uh felt nervous but
[32:37] the singing of the songs just touched my
[32:40] heart and just feel
[32:42] calm amen and so let's just stand as we
[32:44] go into
[32:46] john the 15th chapter and
[32:50] we'll look at this and just touch upon
[32:54] these words here starting
[32:56] john 15 and 14.
[33:00] and now remember if you have a red
[33:02] letter bible
[33:04] this is red letter amen
[33:08] this is our lord jesus christ
[33:11] speaking to you and i so these are not
[33:14] even
[33:15] now i don't don't misunderstand me i'm
[33:19] not saying that paul and
[33:21] the rest ever put anything to it
[33:24] right they come they brought what was
[33:26] laid upon their hearts as the
[33:28] holy ghost spoke to them but we have and
[33:31] i want you to catch this
[33:32] in in just my thought i i don't want to
[33:35] say that i'm putting any less on any of
[33:37] the apostles
[33:38] but this would be as though
[33:42] the prophet of god says this would be as
[33:44] though god was speaking to you
[33:45] lip to ear right when jesus speaks we
[33:48] can take that
[33:50] literally as though he was sitting in
[33:51] the chair with us he was in the car with
[33:54] us
[33:54] uh and and it's lip to ear
[33:57] amen and i meant to say brother david i
[34:01] meant to call you a couple times in the
[34:03] last couple days and
[34:04] every time i went to call you it seemed
[34:06] like the wheels fell off the wagon and i
[34:08] spent time
[34:09] jacking the car up and putting the
[34:10] wheels back on and
[34:12] um so uh anyway i just pray
[34:16] lord bless you with the saints here so
[34:20] we look at this now verse 14 ye
[34:24] are my friends if you do whatsoever i
[34:27] command you
[34:28] now that seems as though there's a
[34:31] caveat placed upon the friendship right
[34:35] but let's take this now because
[34:38] our lord jesus christ was not as it were
[34:40] a fair weather friend
[34:43] but what he was actually taking and
[34:46] defining by the word of god
[34:48] was actually not his definition
[34:52] of our friendship he's actually
[34:54] describing
[34:56] our definition to him
[34:59] we say we believe we
[35:02] say he is lord we say he is
[35:05] healer and deliverer and provider we say
[35:10] but if we don't do the word
[35:14] then all of this really becomes nolan
[35:16] void because we can say he's lord and
[35:18] master
[35:18] we can say he's friend but we
[35:22] have to project this ourself
[35:25] did that make sense to you
[35:28] henceforth i call you not servants he's
[35:31] placing an incredible value now saints i
[35:33] actually
[35:34] touched on these scriptures here if your
[35:36] memory catches that we
[35:37] we touched on john 15 here recently so i
[35:41] i hope that we can tie this together
[35:43] henceforth i call you not servants
[35:46] for the servant knoweth not what his
[35:48] lord doeth
[35:49] but i have called you friends for all
[35:51] things that i have heard of my father
[35:54] i have made known unto
[35:57] you now off of this verse right here
[36:00] saints
[36:01] we can say the word of god is now
[36:04] an open book
[36:09] you have not chosen me but i have chosen
[36:11] you
[36:12] and ordained you that you should go
[36:16] and bring forth fruit and that your
[36:18] fruit should remain
[36:20] that whatsoever you shall ask of the
[36:22] father in my name
[36:23] he may give it you
[36:26] these things i command you that you love
[36:28] one another isn't that interesting
[36:31] it didn't start with anything else on
[36:34] the list
[36:37] now i don't mean to keep you standing
[36:38] but you see if we can't come to the
[36:40] place that we
[36:41] love one another then it don't matter
[36:44] what revelations we talk about and god
[36:46] spoke to me about this and spoke to me
[36:48] about that
[36:49] he's placing the starting point
[36:53] in believing on him obeying his
[36:57] commandments
[36:58] and loving one another i love that
[37:01] very simplistic but difficult maybe
[37:09] if the world hates you you know that it
[37:12] hated me before it hated you and i don't
[37:14] know why i find a little
[37:16] something inside of me it's like a lot
[37:18] easier when you stand in company
[37:20] knowing people dislike not just you
[37:24] because of maybe your personality your
[37:26] looks your whatever and
[37:28] but but to realize that there is a body
[37:32] there there's a reason it hated me
[37:35] before it hated you
[37:37] now verse 19 if ye were of the world
[37:42] the world would love his own
[37:46] but because ye are not of the world but
[37:49] i have
[37:50] chosen you out of the world therefore
[37:53] the world
[37:53] hated you when they would snicker at a
[37:57] sister
[37:58] when they would say oh my we can't tell
[38:01] our jokes in the cafeteria because
[38:04] he is here you see it's not about us
[38:10] remember the word that i said unto you
[38:12] the servant is not greater than his lord
[38:15] and
[38:15] if they have persecuted me they will
[38:18] also
[38:18] persecute you if they have kept my s
[38:22] if they have kept my saying they will
[38:24] keep yours
[38:25] also but all these things will they do
[38:28] unto you for my name's sake because they
[38:30] know not
[38:31] him that sent me
[38:36] now let me just put this in here the one
[38:39] who knows him
[38:41] is the one who carries his name that's
[38:44] the only way
[38:46] you can say that a wife or a husband
[38:49] would
[38:50] then know this their spouse is they
[38:52] carry the name
[38:54] remember brother branham says there's
[38:56] only one mrs william branham
[38:59] and she's the one who goes home with me
[39:06] if i had not come and spoken unto them
[39:10] and they had not had sin but now
[39:13] they have no cloak for their sin
[39:17] he that hateth me hateth my father also
[39:19] and
[39:20] if i had not done among them the works
[39:23] which
[39:23] none other man did they had
[39:27] not sin not had had sin but now
[39:31] they have seen and hated both me and my
[39:34] father
[39:35] but this cometh to pass that the word
[39:39] might be fulfilled that is written in
[39:41] their law they hated me
[39:43] without cause but when the comforter
[39:46] is calm he's come saints
[39:50] whom i will send unto you from the
[39:52] father even the spirit of truth which
[39:55] proceedeth
[39:56] from the father he shall testify
[39:59] of me and ye also shall bear witness
[40:02] because ye
[40:03] have been with me from the beginning
[40:06] now this goes much deeper my brother and
[40:08] sister our lord jesus is speaking here
[40:10] he's not talking about the beginning of
[40:12] his ministry
[40:14] he's talking about from the beginning oh
[40:17] isn't that beautiful
[40:19] heavenly father lord we love you tonight
[40:21] just ask your father to help us lord
[40:24] just lead us to guide us to speak the
[40:26] right words tonight and
[40:27] lord just be amongst your saints father
[40:29] those who are not present tonight
[40:32] lord we would just ask you father to be
[40:34] with them whatever the circumstance
[40:37] lord be with those that are out of the
[40:39] state out of the country
[40:41] father whatever the circumstance might

[40:44] lord of the body of christ the body of
[40:46] believers be with them
[40:48] lord we love you and adore you ask you
[40:51] to come on the scene
[40:52] lord as you look at the hearts of the
[40:54] saints father i ask you come on this
[40:56] scene father for their hearts desires
[40:58] tonight
[40:59] in the name of jesus christ we pray amen
[41:02] you may be seated amen
[41:08] now as we look at this my brother and
[41:10] sister
[41:11] i really really really uh
[41:14] just you know i don't know it just
[41:17] strikes me as you read the scriptures
[41:19] and you come across certain things and
[41:20] you cross
[41:21] reference and you go back which is what
[41:23] brought me to
[41:24] these scriptures again was kind of a
[41:26] cross-reference just coming back
[41:29] and just a reminder you have not chosen
[41:32] me
[41:32] but i have chosen you and ordained you
[41:36] you see it's not my brother and sister
[41:38] about something how that we come to a
[41:40] certain place and
[41:41] god said wow they excel i i think you
[41:44] know that they're going to be the
[41:45] olympians of the message
[41:48] it's it's not about that it's him
[41:50] looking down through time and saying
[41:52] you know what the very life the very
[41:54] seed the very nature
[41:55] everything about them is me and i've
[41:57] placed myself
[41:58] in them and i'm not concerned about what
[42:01] will happen in the ages to come
[42:03] i'm not concerned what that will be the
[42:06] mandates of the world that they will
[42:08] live in because
[42:09] they're mine and while he has then
[42:12] my brother and sister not just a
[42:14] mortgage on you he doesn't have just a
[42:16] promissory note on you
[42:18] he has the title deed amen and that
[42:21] takes us and we'll make a little
[42:23] reference to this
[42:24] a little later but my brother and sister
[42:26] when we see
[42:27] boaz and we see the whole story right
[42:30] there when boaz come he didn't just say
[42:32] now
[42:33] i i'm going to you know just try and
[42:35] claim the pretty girl here called ruth
[42:38] but i am claiming all that naomi
[42:41] lost now my brother and sister what name
[42:44] we lost was
[42:45] actually the family heritage it was
[42:47] everything that was ever
[42:49] associated with her family that would
[42:51] have come down so this was not
[42:53] just some little minor event that was
[42:55] taking place
[42:56] and i think sometimes we're just like
[42:58] yeah yep he went to the city center
[43:00] he was there at the gates and and he
[43:01] said now you're going to claim
[43:03] you got to just you know do this no this
[43:05] was a very
[43:06] significant action that was taking place
[43:10] and
[43:10] in that element right there we see that
[43:13] uh the very type of christ which as we
[43:15] study the scripture we see that
[43:17] and how he's made the claim my brother
[43:19] and sister not just to
[43:20] claim one little portion of it but to
[43:22] claim it all and
[43:24] it's quite interesting because in our
[43:26] good days and our good deeds and our
[43:28] abilities
[43:29] we could see maybe some merit to be
[43:31] claimed but in our
[43:33] days that are struggled and full of uh
[43:35] uh trouble and
[43:36] toil and and uh you know satan's
[43:39] whispered in our
[43:40] ear and and we just kind of feel you
[43:42] know that we just aren't worthy and
[43:44] you know what i'm talking about and and
[43:46] he he claimed you on that day also
[43:50] amen he knew that day would come and he
[43:52] claimed you on that day
[43:53] also and you know so the highs are easy
[43:56] to live
[43:57] and be excited the lows my brother and
[43:59] sister can sometimes be low enough
[44:01] that we think well why would god even
[44:04] claim me but
[44:05] i want you to know when he says you have
[44:07] not chosen me
[44:08] but i have chosen you on the days that
[44:11] you're worthy
[44:13] no no no no he simply said i
[44:17] choose you i have chosen past tense
[44:20] chosen you so it's there that we look in
[44:23] the world we get and
[44:24] my brother and sister just studying the
[44:26] message and and and listening and
[44:28] whatnot you know we say well it it's
[44:31] just
[44:31] we live in a difficult time well you
[44:34] know i have no clue
[44:35] and i don't believe anyone else really
[44:37] has a clue but my brother and sister the
[44:39] times are very well will be more
[44:41] difficult
[44:42] but don't worry about it because the
[44:44] standard is still being raised up it
[44:46] didn't just reach a certain height
[44:47] and stop there but the standard is
[44:49] continuing to rise
[44:51] at our need oh hallelujah that makes me
[44:54] so happy
[44:55] to realize that i i don't have to you
[44:58] know hope that god will come on the
[45:00] scene or hope that the lord will meet me
[45:01] there
[45:02] but he says right here you know that if
[45:04] i would ask anything in his name
[45:06] the father will give it to me and my
[45:08] brother and sister
[45:09] i i think we ought to just step out in
[45:12] confidence upon that
[45:13] and just stand and say you know what i
[45:16] believe this is what i need brother rich
[45:18] up at the camp you know spoke on that if
[45:20] you need a different car
[45:22] and you're not just doing it for for
[45:24] some kind of vanity reason you need
[45:26] something to come on the scene
[45:28] you need to do that we have a provider
[45:30] amen it's not here just because we want
[45:32] big
[45:33] 20-inch spinner wheels or you know
[45:35] something better than everyone in the
[45:36] church
[45:37] that won't qualify but to have a need in
[45:40] our life
[45:40] we need to have the confidence to stand
[45:43] up and make that claim amen
[45:45] because my brother and sister we carry
[45:47] his name
[45:48] we're not here just in ourselves to say
[45:51] we're christians
[45:52] we we are sons and daughters of god we
[45:55] are mrs jesus christ
[45:56] but we need to actually recognize that
[45:59] that is
[46:00] the reality that is the truth of it we
[46:02] carry
[46:03] his name hallelujah well he says that he
[46:07] carries our name
[46:08] in the palms of his hands right we were
[46:10] in him from before the foundation of the
[46:12] world
[46:13] now look at this my brother and sister
[46:15] in verse 22
[46:17] uh maybe i'm getting ahead of myself
[46:20] but my brother and sister you see as we
[46:23] look at this
[46:25] jesus is speaking these verses here
[46:27] jesus is speaking to the people
[46:29] and i just put a little uh parentheses
[46:32] here
[46:33] it's us because as he's speaking to the
[46:36] believer he's speaking to those
[46:38] that he says you know what i i have
[46:40] chosen you i've claimed you so he's
[46:42] speaking to us
[46:43] and you know when a son or daughter of
[46:45] god reading the word of god
[46:47] he reads that and something in you
[46:49] resignates my brother and sister these
[46:52] are god's words of affirmation to you
[46:54] these are god's words of encouraging you
[46:56] telling you
[46:57] get up quit crying you can do it
[47:00] now if you don't feel that way i did so
[47:03] anyway i'll just cover that base
[47:05] get up and just quit crying and just do
[47:07] the work just for walking
[47:09] amen the promised land is right there
[47:11] and it is a promise it's not the land of
[47:13] hope
[47:15] it's not the land of maybe an
[47:17] opportunity my brother and sister
[47:19] yes there was blessings that were
[47:21] promised to be in the land
[47:22] but it was a land of promise it was a
[47:25] land of
[47:25] prophecy and we have a land of promise
[47:28] and we have a land of prophecy
[47:30] that we should claim and dwell in it not
[47:33] just look off
[47:34] and say well maybe someday or under some
[47:37] thing
[47:38] you see i just love that amen maybe
[47:40] brother chris will
[47:41] i'll lead the church in that little song
[47:44] i can't even remember the words but
[47:46] you know i i was like a little hesitant
[47:48] at first you know because i
[47:50] i do you know try to be dignified
[47:54] but you know it's about time we just
[47:55] stand up i've got it on video i've got
[47:57] you guys on video you realize that
[47:59] and we're stepping out right and we're
[48:01] claiming what the devil has stole
[48:04] from us amen not just one time we're
[48:06] going to keep right on doing it
[48:08] each and every day we're just going to
[48:10] walk and and we're going to go back out
[48:12] and we're going to claim what the devil
[48:13] stole from
[48:14] us and so sometimes we need some words
[48:17] of affirmation just to
[48:18] to keep remembering that what he has in
[48:22] his hand talking about the devil
[48:23] is actually ours amen it's time for us
[48:26] to take it back from it
[48:27] so we're not stealing it from him amen
[48:30] it's already ours
[48:31] amen now you see these words of
[48:33] affirmation
[48:35] do you know the bible
[48:39] is what is referred to sometimes as a
[48:42] multi-speak
[48:45] multi-speak now that
[48:48] terminology is used when a term
[48:52] applies to different people in different
[48:54] ways
[48:57] so something is spoke the bible's full
[48:59] of it you know that
[49:00] the bible's full the very words that are
[49:03] redemption to you
[49:04] are judgment to them the very words that
[49:07] are loved to you
[49:08] and a revelation to you are un
[49:12] that they don't understand them they
[49:13] can't find uh
[49:15] the the right you know determination of
[49:19] what this really means but and now don't
[49:22] make emphasis on the word multi-speak
[49:24] i'm just
[49:24] use that word that's something i read
[49:26] here recently but you see when god
[49:28] speaks to you through the word
[49:30] amen that's not what they're hearing out
[49:32] here that's not what those people
[49:34] carousing the streets of the city
[49:35] tonight
[49:36] are hearing they're not hearing the same
[49:38] thing you hear when you
[49:40] read the word or hear the word of god so
[49:42] the word is speaking to
[49:44] the brine much the same way as brother
[49:46] branham talks about going overseas
[49:48] and uh uh you know receiving a letter
[49:51] from his wife
[49:52] and she's talking about she got the kids
[49:55] to bed and she did some laundry and
[49:56] she's doing some
[49:57] ironing and or whatever i see brother
[49:59] branham and then saying you know what
[50:01] uh what it is is is i understand her
[50:04] language i understand what she is saying
[50:07] she's saying you know what i wish you
[50:09] were here i miss you
[50:10] i love you i care for you and and
[50:13] someone else would say well that seems
[50:15] interesting that she would write about
[50:17] that a letter that's traveled all the
[50:18] way across the ocean
[50:20] to come into his hands and she doesn't
[50:22] declare these things but she is
[50:25] and the word of god my brother and
[50:26] sister is declaring god's love
[50:28] affirmation to you and i
[50:30] tonight and the world looks at this and
[50:32] says yes john 3
[50:34] 16 we love it but my brother and sister
[50:36] john 3 16 means something different to
[50:38] you and i
[50:38] than it does to the world out here for
[50:41] god so loved the world
[50:42] that he gave his only begotten son to
[50:45] draw you and i
[50:46] out of the world amen it's not just a
[50:49] matter of spreading his love
[50:51] over the earth but his love went out and
[50:55] drew you and i
[50:56] from this very world that we live in
[50:58] amen
[50:59] so the believer understands the words of
[51:01] our lord jesus christ
[51:04] tied right to it you see sometimes it's
[51:06] kind of a blunt speech
[51:08] to the unrevelated some people don't
[51:11] like
[51:11] it they they kind of push back on it
[51:14] that isn't what the prophet
[51:15] said that isn't what he meant the reason
[51:17] is my brother and sister
[51:19] is that word is not speaking to them
[51:22] the same way is speaking to you
[51:28] oh some people might say oh oh you got
[51:30] some other revelation you got something
[51:32] you know quite honestly i do quite
[51:35] honestly
[51:36] you do because you now understand
[51:41] god's language the language of our lord
[51:43] jesus christ you understand it when you
[51:45] read the word you know what he's saying
[51:47] to you
[51:48] and it resonates down in your heart and
[51:50] soul
[51:51] hallelujah now let's just go back
[51:54] to verse 22 for just a moment
[51:59] now as i made this statement the one who
[52:01] knows him
[52:03] truly knows him as the one that carries
[52:05] his name and that's not just a man or a
[52:07] woman saying oh i
[52:08] i'm a son or daughter of god i'm the
[52:10] bride of christ anybody can say that my
[52:12] brother and sister
[52:13] you know anybody can say well i really
[52:16] believe the word the devil believes the
[52:18] word
[52:18] he knows it's true but that doesn't make
[52:21] him say amen to it
[52:23] you will never find the devil saying
[52:26] amen
[52:28] or so be it to the
[52:31] revealed word of god
[52:36] versions of it interpretations of it
[52:40] presentations of it he can say amen to
[52:44] but not the true revelated word of god
[52:48] now what is it my brother and sister i
[52:49] hope i'm making my point to you
[52:51] what is it then that comes and something
[52:53] happens to you and i
[52:55] good days are bad days something inside
[52:57] of us says amen to that word
[53:00] amen we can't help ourself even if it's
[53:04] skin in us we just say amen
[53:08] amen lord that's the truth now verse 22
[53:11] he says if i had not come and spoken
[53:14] unto them
[53:16] they had not had sin
[53:20] you see in the ignorance
[53:25] absolute lack of knowledge of
[53:30] they were just proceeding forward with
[53:32] nothing to judge them
[53:34] nothing to show them anything different
[53:38] you see our lord jesus christ come right
[53:40] down and stood in the midst
[53:42] sadducees pharisees sanhedrin counsel
[53:45] all of these people of the day
[53:48] and he spoke the word and literally
[53:53] judgment fell
[53:57] now let's think about it my brother and
[53:59] sister because it seems like sometimes
[54:01] the hardest days you have are right
[54:02] after communion
[54:03] the devil wants to come and try to just
[54:06] kind of shove that back at you your
[54:07] communion with god
[54:08] well i'll tell you what i'll trip you
[54:10] i'll make you eat dirt i'll let you
[54:12] crawl in whatever and and you know you
[54:14] look at this
[54:15] now my brother and sister to see that at
[54:17] the time in the place that that satan
[54:20] would come
[54:20] he he doesn't like the fact that the
[54:23] word brings us
[54:24] into a judgment but look what even as we
[54:27] have the scriptures for communion
[54:29] and it's declaring to us examine
[54:33] yourself what's god doing
[54:38] god is uncovering you
[54:43] god is uncovering you saints and look
[54:46] what happened right here you see it's
[54:47] the very word that uncovered us in the
[54:50] beginning and let us know we weren't of
[54:51] this world
[54:52] and our behavior and our actions and the
[54:54] things that we thought on and
[54:56] were identified in and he uncovered
[54:59] us and he says here now you know if i
[55:02] had not come and spoken them they had
[55:04] had not sin
[55:05] but now they have no cloak
[55:08] for their sin they have no covering
[55:12] amen no outer garment no cloth
[55:15] no covering
[55:20] oh who can say thank you lord thank you
[55:23] lord i
[55:23] i love it my brother and sister and
[55:26] sometimes it's it can be a bitter pill
[55:28] when
[55:28] you realize there's some little
[55:30] something in your life that you didn't
[55:31] think was a problem before but
[55:33] suddenly now it it appears to you to be
[55:35] a problem and you're like oh lord help
[55:37] me i went for years this way or
[55:39] in this and and and god comes but what's
[55:42] he doing my brother and sister
[55:43] he's uncovering he's uncovering and it's
[55:46] not oh i hope you catch this tonight
[55:48] it's not whether it's uncovered in our
[55:51] life or not people are like oh no i
[55:52] don't want no one to know i don't want
[55:54] this to be exposed
[55:55] no we do want it to be exposed it's not
[55:58] that it was
[55:59] there and it is uncovered it's what we
[56:02] do with it after it's uncovered
[56:05] that's what god's working on he's oh
[56:07] i'll tell you what my brother and sister
[56:09] there's no surprises to god god doesn't
[56:12] say
[56:12] oh my goodness oh look what they've done
[56:16] or look what they thought or look what
[56:18] they said
[56:20] no
[56:25] it's after it's uncovered
[56:28] you see to them it became sin at the
[56:30] moment he uncovered it
[56:33] but they chose this goes much deeper as
[56:36] you well know i mean there's much more
[56:37] explanation but
[56:38] praise the lord i'm just trying to keep
[56:40] a normal time frame tonight
[56:42] you see all that was exposed right there
[56:46] none of that condemned them you realize
[56:48] that not
[56:49] one drop of it condemned them until re
[56:52] they rejected the solution
[56:56] until they reject the choice
[57:00] and then it became sin to them
[57:04] imagine in a perfect world they would
[57:05] have all said oh
[57:07] oh my what have we done
[57:11] forgive us lord
[57:15] what a different world it would have
[57:16] been amen
[57:19] but you see the spirit of that day and
[57:21] the spirit of today are
[57:22] much the same they use god when he's
[57:24] convenient
[57:26] we have a tragedy we need god when we're
[57:29] doing well
[57:31] we want to do it my way amen
[57:34] so he says you know now they have no
[57:37] cloak they have no
[57:39] garment they have no covering for this
[57:42] sin and
[57:43] so as they stand there now my brother
[57:45] and sister
[57:46] exposed as it were they they have no way
[57:49] to hide this it has now been brought
[57:52] forth and put into the open and
[57:54] obviously if a man had a lot of pride
[57:56] and and position
[57:58] and uh you know something that he was
[57:59] holding to uh that would make you
[58:02] unhappy
[58:02] right to have your unbelief have your
[58:05] position
[58:06] you know exposed to the people but you
[58:08] see my brother and sister
[58:10] it really wasn't that big of deal in the
[58:12] public uh window or public display
[58:15] because these people that jesus spoke to
[58:18] were actually surrounded by people of
[58:20] the same spirit
[58:23] so no made a great big deal about this
[58:25] because they were
[58:26] in present company they were in uh you
[58:29] know birds of a feather
[58:31] they were in the same position and and
[58:33] so each one remember you want a little
[58:36] confirmation of that the woman caught in
[58:38] the very act of adultery
[58:40] and as jesus speaks to them he doesn't
[58:43] say now
[58:44] okay i'm gonna pick which one of you
[58:46] that is the highest authority to judge
[58:48] her
[58:49] he says i'm going to pick the one who
[58:51] has no sin
[58:55] see what did he do he lifted the cloak
[58:56] off of the very fact
[58:58] that my brother and sister and i i know
[58:59] you catch this so i don't want to be too
[59:01] redundant
[59:02] but the very fact he pulled the cloak
[59:03] off of this and there wasn't one who
[59:06] stood forth and said you know according
[59:08] to the word
[59:09] we should stone her and i'm obligated
[59:14] i'm obligated to do this not one
[59:20] i would love to know wouldn't the whole
[59:22] world love to know just exactly what it
[59:24] was jesus was writing
[59:26] in the sand i don't know you know
[59:29] different times different places i've
[59:31] heard people present it just trying to
[59:33] make the same idea not a doctrine but
[59:36] maybe they're writing dates
[59:39] maybe they were writing names maybe they
[59:42] were writing
[59:44] locations
[59:46] figuratively maybe they were writing
[59:48] bank account numbers
[59:53] whatever it was it caught their
[59:54] attention and they said i am out of here
[59:58] not one repented
[1:00:01] not one repented there was an open door
[1:00:05] what had happened in their life was now
[1:00:07] exposed
[1:00:09] uncovered and they could have said oh
[1:00:12] forgive me lord
[1:00:14] but they chose to pull their own
[1:00:17] covering
[1:00:18] back over their own life
[1:00:21] god help us forgive me lord forgive
[1:00:24] us lord hallelujah amen
[1:00:28] you know this can be pretty blunt speech
[1:00:30] to the unrelated but to a real believer
[1:00:32] to a son or daughter of god
[1:00:33] they're going to say you know what lord
[1:00:35] i recognize this that when you uncover
[1:00:37] these things in my life
[1:00:39] it's for me to then repent and to take
[1:00:42] these things and move forward
[1:00:43] and come to a higher plane amen god
[1:00:46] never trying to cut us down my brother
[1:00:48] and sister
[1:00:49] the way up is down the way down is up
[1:00:51] but god is constantly
[1:00:53] in fact i would put it this way that
[1:00:56] when we
[1:00:57] think god is taking us down he's
[1:01:00] actually
[1:01:00] lifting up amen and there is the beauty
[1:01:04] of it
[1:01:04] so we got to switch our our thinking
[1:01:07] amen kind of a spiritual dyslexia in a
[1:01:10] sense
[1:01:11] that you know we look at it backwards
[1:01:14] but we got to see it the way god wrote
[1:01:16] it
[1:01:16] amen and now any of you that have ever
[1:01:18] experienced dyslexia
[1:01:20] you understand what it's like that you
[1:01:22] look at something and and you are just
[1:01:24] convinced that it's a certain way but
[1:01:28] in fact we have it backwards
[1:01:32] but there's different
[1:01:35] how would you say it depths of dyslexia
[1:01:39] there are some that not every word is
[1:01:41] reversed
[1:01:43] very very confusing for a young child
[1:01:48] because then he can't trust himself of
[1:01:50] which word is
[1:01:51] forward and which word is reversed
[1:01:56] but oh i hope you catch this by training
[1:02:01] by training they learn
[1:02:05] and then they go on i had a friend i
[1:02:08] haven't seen him for quite a few years
[1:02:10] he had dyslexia very embarrassing for
[1:02:13] him when he was a young man sixth
[1:02:14] seventh eighth ninth grade
[1:02:15] very embarrassing a lot of people made
[1:02:17] fun of him but you know his family
[1:02:20] loved him a lot cared about him and they
[1:02:22] worked
[1:02:24] and over time he
[1:02:27] had to how would you say process it when
[1:02:30] he was reading so he didn't read real
[1:02:32] fast he wasn't some speed reader
[1:02:34] and he processed it and he read but what
[1:02:36] was really cool about that
[1:02:38] if i can just throw this out to he
[1:02:41] understood what he read
[1:02:43] it wasn't just words on a page it wasn't
[1:02:47] just something
[1:02:48] he could repeat went on to accomplish
[1:02:51] great things
[1:02:53] i think he became an engineer architect
[1:02:55] something of that nature went to college
[1:02:57] my brother and sister the kids who made
[1:02:59] fun of him
[1:03:00] most of them never reach such height
[1:03:04] so you look at this now what has
[1:03:06] happened so our lord jesus christ is
[1:03:08] telling them because i told you the word
[1:03:10] because i shared the word with you
[1:03:13] i have now taken the outer garment that
[1:03:16] covered you what you thought was your
[1:03:19] covering what you thought was your
[1:03:20] protection
[1:03:21] what you thought was good enough
[1:03:24] i have now taken that from you and
[1:03:27] caused you to have to dig
[1:03:28] deeper and look deeper at your own self
[1:03:31] oh my brother and sister if you
[1:03:32] understand the day that they lived in
[1:03:34] people might go and they've walked in
[1:03:37] the dusty roads and they would do
[1:03:39] and maybe they were going somewhere and
[1:03:41] maybe it was somewhere of importance you
[1:03:42] know
[1:03:43] they didn't just have a shower like us
[1:03:44] right then just slip into
[1:03:46] somewhere rent a room get showered up so
[1:03:49] what they would do is have
[1:03:50] a clean cloak a clean outer garment
[1:03:53] that they would put on and with the
[1:03:55] washing of their hands and their feet
[1:03:57] then they were presentable but my
[1:03:59] brother and sister they were still dirty
[1:04:01] underneath
[1:04:02] oh isn't that the very nature of
[1:04:03] humanity we just want to put something
[1:04:06] over the top
[1:04:07] and look good but god wants us to get
[1:04:10] right down and see what is the very
[1:04:12] depths of what we are
[1:04:13] and what we are covering up and and he
[1:04:15] says look i'm not going to shame you
[1:04:17] i'm not going to condem i'm not going to
[1:04:19] do these things
[1:04:20] i just want you to know i want you to
[1:04:23] see and in the talks
[1:04:24] in the talking of salvation i want you
[1:04:27] just to repent
[1:04:28] i don't want you to go find another
[1:04:30] garment to put on
[1:04:32] amen have any of you ever seen the
[1:04:34] little video on youtube about the
[1:04:37] it's kind of a put on thing or whatever
[1:04:39] about you know uh people i think they
[1:04:41] blame it on the millennials but
[1:04:43] uh we won't judge the millennials but
[1:04:45] you know it's like well
[1:04:47] they're interviewing the church this
[1:04:50] young couple now
[1:04:51] oh okay now what time are your services
[1:04:53] well we have a nine o'clock and we have
[1:04:55] 11 o'clock
[1:04:56] they're like you don't have a two
[1:04:58] o'clock
[1:05:00] because nine o'clock and eleven o'clock
[1:05:01] are just too early for us
[1:05:05] and let us see the nursery i want to i
[1:05:07] want to see if
[1:05:08] you you don't have a bounce house
[1:05:12] our our son likes bounce houses
[1:05:17] ultimately the ministry of shine
[1:05:19] communism this is a wonderful place to
[1:05:21] come you'll like it
[1:05:22] and they're looking at each other
[1:05:26] you see my brother and sister the cloak
[1:05:28] that they had on
[1:05:30] was not a cloak of serving god
[1:05:34] it was a cloak of serving themselves
[1:05:37] under the umbrella of god
[1:05:41] and so it really was all about what they
[1:05:42] wanted and
[1:05:44] there is without god coming and dealing
[1:05:47] with them no way that
[1:05:48] mere man's words will penetrate that
[1:05:51] outer garment
[1:05:53] please me you see
[1:05:57] when jesus spoke the sin was uncovered
[1:06:00] not by a man preaching to them but it
[1:06:02] was uncovered by
[1:06:04] the word now we by revelation know the
[1:06:06] word was made flesh and so that was god
[1:06:08] himself standing there speaking to them
[1:06:10] but my brother and sister i'll just put
[1:06:12] it this way brother david brother chris
[1:06:15] speaking the word have the same exact
[1:06:17] effect
[1:06:18] of the word of god upon an individual
[1:06:20] because
[1:06:21] speaking the word my brother and sister
[1:06:23] is the word amen that
[1:06:25] is our lord jesus christ so the sin is
[1:06:28] uncovered by the preaching or speaking
[1:06:30] of the word
[1:06:31] and the word will uncovered you realize
[1:06:33] that the true anointed word of god
[1:06:35] will never just pass over
[1:06:39] amen it passed over my brother and
[1:06:42] sister in egypt because the blood had
[1:06:44] been applied
[1:06:46] otherwise the word will not pass over it
[1:06:49] will not just leave
[1:06:50] that because word is
[1:06:53] a corrector amen but the word also makes
[1:06:56] my heart glad as a restorer
[1:06:59] amen when it corrects us it then puts us
[1:07:01] right back where we should be in the
[1:07:03] fashion we should be
[1:07:04] but look at this and this is one thing i
[1:07:05] really love and and way too big a
[1:07:07] subject for tonight
[1:07:09] but the word is revelation my brother
[1:07:11] and sister we cannot oh i hope i don't
[1:07:13] want to sound
[1:07:14] critical to no one but i hope we'll
[1:07:16] never come to the place
[1:07:18] that we'll say we have the word i read
[1:07:19] the word i believe the word
[1:07:21] but we are devoid of revelation
[1:07:24] this word is revelation this word
[1:07:28] is the very life of god revealed in this
[1:07:32] day
[1:07:32] and we cannot have this word and be
[1:07:35] filled with the holy ghost and not have
[1:07:37] a revelation of who jesus christ is
[1:07:40] it's absolutely impossible
[1:07:44] now i'll just bring this up right here
[1:07:46] as we'll go into the quote into the
[1:07:48] message
[1:07:49] uh spiritual amnesia now look my brother
[1:07:51] and sister as we'll look at this i
[1:07:54] hope this makes as much sense to you as
[1:07:55] it does to me did you know that cain
[1:07:57] offered
[1:07:58] as good a sacrifice to as a good
[1:08:01] sacrifice to
[1:08:02] he was sincere he built an altar he
[1:08:05] knelt down and he worshiped
[1:08:07] offered a sacrifice prayed to god and if
[1:08:10] god that's all god requires for you
[1:08:13] to belong to the church and have an
[1:08:15] altar and pay your tithes and go to
[1:08:17] church
[1:08:17] and live a good life if that's all he
[1:08:19] requires he was
[1:08:20] unjust to condemn cain
[1:08:26] now we're not in a baptist church and
[1:08:29] we're not in a methodist church
[1:08:32] amen but these spirits
[1:08:35] are still trying to knock at our door
[1:08:38] and come in those spirits don't care
[1:08:43] that we believe in a prophet in this day
[1:08:47] they could care less those spirits
[1:08:50] are wanting you to be convinced
[1:08:56] that if you acknowledge god sent a
[1:08:58] prophet
[1:08:59] and you follow in the guidelines of the
[1:09:02] message
[1:09:03] it's okay right that's the same patterns
[1:09:06] he doesn't have a different pattern for
[1:09:08] a message church than he did for any
[1:09:10] other church
[1:09:13] the devil is predictable he's cunning
[1:09:16] he's sly
[1:09:17] but he is predictable
[1:09:23] so if all of this right here was all
[1:09:25] that was necessary
[1:09:28] then he would have to not because it was
[1:09:30] methodist or baptist or nazarene
[1:09:32] right down here if that was good enough
[1:09:33] in a message church he'd have to go back
[1:09:35] and apologize to cain
[1:09:40] yes sir that's exactly but religion
[1:09:44] now how many of you read ahead
[1:09:52] there's no way to have much of a bang
[1:09:55] sometimes when
[1:09:56] everybody's already read it say yep amen
[1:09:58] amen yep yep yep
[1:10:00] amen i see where he's tying that back to
[1:10:02] this okay
[1:10:05] oh i'm just just trying to share just a
[1:10:07] little bit
[1:10:08] the joy that a person would share
[1:10:12] in fact i want to share a little of that
[1:10:13] joy did you know that
[1:10:16] our choice for a camp was the correct
[1:10:19] one
[1:10:21] because the scripture tells us
[1:10:24] to dwell together in unity
[1:10:27] in the spirit of revelation amen
[1:10:32] now i hope that isn't offensive to you
[1:10:34] but i believe we had a real unity
[1:10:36] amen i believe we that we were there and
[1:10:38] it was good
[1:10:40] amen now you yes sir that's exactly but
[1:10:43] religion
[1:10:44] means a covering and you can't be
[1:10:45] covered by your own good works
[1:10:48] there's only one thing that god will
[1:10:50] accept and that's the blood of jesus
[1:10:52] christ
[1:10:53] that's the only covering
[1:10:57] now my brother and sister when it comes
[1:10:59] to egypt god didn't say now
[1:11:01] if it kind of made you queasy to kill
[1:11:04] him
[1:11:05] and cook him then just buy four or five
[1:11:07] lambs and tie him out front and it'll be
[1:11:09] all right
[1:11:12] why because there was only one way that
[1:11:15] was by the blood
[1:11:17] so it didn't matter if it was squeezy i
[1:11:18] remember one time
[1:11:20] an individual telling me i just don't
[1:11:22] like
[1:11:24] communion and foot washing and i was
[1:11:26] like okay i got a little nervous all of
[1:11:28] a sudden
[1:11:29] it's like oh why don't you like that
[1:11:32] well
[1:11:32] i i don't like drinking out of a cup
[1:11:35] after other people
[1:11:37] and i don't like touching their dirty
[1:11:40] feet
[1:11:43] any of you ever felt that way i
[1:11:46] apologize in advance
[1:11:49] because you see they had not one
[1:11:52] revelation
[1:11:53] people are like well i'm afraid that i
[1:11:55] might catch something from someone
[1:11:57] the communion cup do you think god would
[1:12:00] let you catch the flu
[1:12:02] from something as sacred as taking
[1:12:05] communion
[1:12:06] are you afraid of touching their feet
[1:12:12] something you see we don't look at
[1:12:16] foot washing is sacred do we
[1:12:19] we should we should be
[1:12:22] it's a sacred ordinance given to us
[1:12:26] to fulfill to the coming of the lord but
[1:12:29] people look at it and go
[1:12:31] he's got limp between his toes
[1:12:34] i know he must not wash his feet when he
[1:12:36] showers
[1:12:39] he oh that's terrible
[1:12:42] that's terrible i just
[1:12:48] lord bless this brother that i loathe
[1:12:50] touching
[1:12:52] no saints let's get a revelation of this
[1:12:55] let's get a revelation if god asked you
[1:12:57] to do it then god ordained the results
[1:13:00] from it
[1:13:01] it's not hazard it's not some hopscotch
[1:13:05] thing that might or might not
[1:13:06] see this is god putting it in order for
[1:13:08] us to fulfill this
[1:13:10] and i'll tell you what it is if you feel
[1:13:11] that way oh i hope i don't skin anybody
[1:13:13] but if you feel that way
[1:13:15] you probably have come into communion
[1:13:17] unworthily
[1:13:18] because you actually have an ought
[1:13:20] against those people who aren't
[1:13:21] perfectly healthy like you
[1:13:28] so you can't be covered by your own good
[1:13:30] works only thing that god will
[1:13:32] accept and that's the blood of jesus
[1:13:33] christ that's the only covering
[1:13:36] now look i'm going to get sidetracked
[1:13:37] here for just a moment did you know that
[1:13:40] it's much easier to fellowship
[1:13:42] foot wash and do all of these things
[1:13:44] with people
[1:13:47] of your same peer group
[1:13:52] i think sometimes it's good if god sends
[1:13:55] somebody
[1:13:56] that looks a little more homeless or
[1:13:58] poor or a little whatever
[1:14:00] because you know the scripture says that
[1:14:01] we not be respecters of
[1:14:03] men but of persons but have we
[1:14:07] have we actually come to that place
[1:14:14] just saying just say it
[1:14:18] that's the only covering outside of that
[1:14:20] if you say keep the creed
[1:14:23] spiritual amnesia that's what happened
[1:14:26] now notice
[1:14:27] they have forgot their word now my
[1:14:30] brother and sister i want to ask you
[1:14:31] what's your word
[1:14:33] see we're living in a day that people
[1:14:35] are forgetting their word
[1:14:37] they are taking other things things that
[1:14:39] aren't necessarily wrong but they're
[1:14:41] actually
[1:14:42] placing them in a higher significance
[1:14:44] than god intended for it to be
[1:14:46] so they're forgetting their word they
[1:14:49] have
[1:14:49] forgot the bible he doesn't describe
[1:14:52] their word as anything else but the
[1:14:54] bible
[1:14:54] they have forgot the promise which was
[1:14:57] the very thing that afflicted israel
[1:14:59] in the wilderness god come after 400
[1:15:02] years
[1:15:02] and delivers them just like he said he
[1:15:04] would and he said i'm going to take you
[1:15:06] into land that's flowing with milk and
[1:15:08] honey
[1:15:08] and if they had had a true revelation if
[1:15:10] we would have a true revelation
[1:15:12] we would not look at anything around us
[1:15:14] we'd be looking at the land and the milk
[1:15:16] and the honey
[1:15:17] and we'd be saying this does not matter
[1:15:20] it is
[1:15:20] that amen not to look in our present
[1:15:24] tense my brother and sister
[1:15:25] but look into eternity amen so it's hard
[1:15:29] for us sometimes because we get so
[1:15:31] caught up
[1:15:31] in our present tense and i'm guilty of
[1:15:33] that we get caught up in the present
[1:15:35] tense
[1:15:35] oh look at this oh look at this i just
[1:15:37] had a banker today i i say this as humor
[1:15:40] i i just had a banker today call me up
[1:15:42] uh paul is all well on the farm
[1:15:44] you know we owe him a bunch of money he
[1:15:46] wants his money back at some point in
[1:15:47] time and
[1:15:48] is all well is everything good how are
[1:15:51] your crops
[1:15:52] uh we're just kind of trying to find out
[1:15:54] how everyone is doing how are you doing
[1:16:01] yeah well look um saints it's been too
[1:16:05] hot and corn that should be 12 feet tall
[1:16:07] right now is
[1:16:08] eight feet tall and you should see the
[1:16:11] bugs
[1:16:13] you walk out in a field and come out
[1:16:15] you're just covered in all kinds of bugs
[1:16:18] and they're all eating my profit they're
[1:16:21] eating that money that i hope to take
[1:16:22] you out to dinner on
[1:16:24] and everything is just terrible
[1:16:28] is it really
[1:16:31] i have a decision to make that's it well
[1:16:34] i already made the decision
[1:16:36] god's either control or paul's in
[1:16:39] control
[1:16:40] and if paul is in control i suggest you
[1:16:42] guys either get
[1:16:43] off the plane parachute out or kick paul
[1:16:46] out of the pilot seat
[1:16:50] so we only have one position god's in
[1:16:53] control
[1:16:54] now brother branham himself says i get
[1:16:57] all nervous i get nervous about these
[1:16:59] things and
[1:16:59] i get anxieties and whatever else don't
[1:17:02] don't don't
[1:17:03] don't think you're backslid don't throw
[1:17:05] yourself under the bus because you get
[1:17:07] nervous of this
[1:17:08] but come to that place that you say lord
[1:17:10] i acknowledge you're in control amen
[1:17:12] we have several examples of the prophet
[1:17:14] of god showing us that he himself was
[1:17:17] human about this he was nervous about
[1:17:18] these things and
[1:17:19] all the pressure come upon him even
[1:17:22] brought him to a place he lied and you
[1:17:23] know why he lied
[1:17:26] pressure but the other reason he lied
[1:17:31] for us he lied to show
[1:17:34] now isn't that terrible people would be
[1:17:36] like god would cause him to lie
[1:17:38] you know no no he's a prophet you can't
[1:17:40] say that no i'm telling you
[1:17:42] everything that god did in this bible
[1:17:44] right here he did
[1:17:46] as an example to you and i
[1:17:49] that we could be in samples i believe is
[1:17:52] the word in the scripture
[1:17:53] could be the example to those behind us
[1:17:56] to our children to
[1:17:57] those we witness to it's not my brother
[1:17:59] and sister out of control
[1:18:01] it's god allowing us so i tell you
[1:18:03] instead of being the critic i'm a little
[1:18:05] off my track here forgive me but instead
[1:18:07] of being the critic that looks at
[1:18:08] brother brown said
[1:18:08] see now a prophet of god lied he
[1:18:11] couldn't be a prophet
[1:18:13] i'm over here saying thank you lord
[1:18:16] thank you lord a man that you would call
[1:18:18] to an office like that and
[1:18:19] under the pressure
[1:18:24] but the beautiful thing about it is
[1:18:27] when it was uncovered
[1:18:30] he repented praise the lord amen goes to
[1:18:33] pray for that baby
[1:18:34] amen right the lord says
[1:18:37] i'm not going to answer your prayer
[1:18:38] until you deal with this
[1:18:41] another example oh my oh well how can
[1:18:44] this be well i'll tell you how it would
[1:18:46] be
[1:18:46] god designed you he fabricated as it
[1:18:49] were
[1:18:50] fabricated you he didn't come you see
[1:18:53] when god spoke and made a fish
[1:18:57] he didn't have to go refer back to
[1:18:58] anything else the fish was the original
[1:19:00] creation
[1:19:02] he spoke of the bird it was original
[1:19:04] creation he spoke of the elk and
[1:19:06] whatever else
[1:19:07] original creation but when he come to
[1:19:10] mankind
[1:19:11] he said let us make man in our
[1:19:14] image amen was there wasn't three gods
[1:19:17] standing up there
[1:19:18] with a design board you know they didn't
[1:19:20] have one of them
[1:19:21] well i don't know if you guys have ever
[1:19:23] done any architectural type drawing you
[1:19:25] know if you got a nice board you know
[1:19:26] you
[1:19:27] you've got your arm and you can get
[1:19:29] everything in your circles and you can
[1:19:30] do everything god wasn't up there
[1:19:32] and he didn't look in a mirror either
[1:19:33] like norman rockwell
[1:19:40] well you guys have seen the picture
[1:19:41] norman rockwell painted of himself in
[1:19:43] the mirror
[1:19:45] that's not how god did it oh it said i'm
[1:19:48] going to make
[1:19:48] man in my image
[1:19:52] done hallelujah
[1:19:58] i'll shut up
[1:20:01] see they forgot their word they forgot
[1:20:04] the bible they forgot the promise
[1:20:06] they're trying to live if you'll bump
[1:20:08] that forward brother alex
[1:20:10] and they're trying to live in the clear
[1:20:12] glare of what methodist was or what
[1:20:14] baptist was
[1:20:15] what somebody else was come on saints
[1:20:16] we're right in there we're not living in
[1:20:18] a glare i tell you what
[1:20:20] now i i it's so easy to be misunderstood
[1:20:22] in this day
[1:20:23] i am not looking back to 1959
[1:20:27] 1961 1963 1965 i'm sorry i'm not looking
[1:20:32] back
[1:20:32] because the living word of that day is
[1:20:34] the living word of our day
[1:20:36] i don't have to look back to see that
[1:20:38] word
[1:20:40] are you with me when the prophet of god
[1:20:42] speaks or you read it however is your
[1:20:44] favored way to
[1:20:46] to be in the message you don't have to
[1:20:48] say now will it fulfill like it did
[1:20:50] there
[1:20:51] my brother and sister there's a promise
[1:20:52] in the word that it will
[1:20:54] and so what it is is we have to allow
[1:20:56] ourselves to be uncovered
[1:20:58] so that we can once again be covered
[1:21:01] amen to be
[1:21:02] the word in this hour that was
[1:21:06] prophesied
[1:21:07] to walk the earth today hallelujah so we
[1:21:10] can't just start in our original form
[1:21:13] and stay there
[1:21:19] here is the promise of the day and god
[1:21:21] speaking it through his word and
[1:21:22] confirming it again
[1:21:23] and proving that it is so and they still
[1:21:26] don't believe it
[1:21:28] spiritual amnesia that's exactly right
[1:21:30] total total amnesians
[1:21:33] i don't know if that's a word absolutely
[1:21:36] don't believe it at all
[1:21:37] and you'll see it my brother and sister
[1:21:40] you see it to come to a point
[1:21:42] look i'll just can i speak direct this
[1:21:44] evening
[1:21:45] people will say god sent a prophet the
[1:21:47] the seventh church ages
[1:21:49] and we see this and we see that and we
[1:21:50] see that and come right down to the
[1:21:53] point
[1:21:53] that it's god in you but in them and
[1:21:56] the very point that it would be god in
[1:21:59] flesh
[1:22:00] again they will say that can't be so
[1:22:02] because if he's in you he's off the
[1:22:04] mercy seat
[1:22:05] but it shows that they don't understand
[1:22:07] the word because a prophet of god in
[1:22:09] very clear words
[1:22:11] says that the mercy seat is in the heart
[1:22:13] of the believer
[1:22:15] amen and so then they find a reason
[1:22:18] to be able to put god back into a
[1:22:21] denominational setting
[1:22:23] that it there is god and look what the
[1:22:25] prophet of god said
[1:22:26] he said they've got god some doty
[1:22:28] grandfather
[1:22:29] setting off just observing what's going
[1:22:32] on
[1:22:35] wrong covering hallelujah
[1:22:38] because we got a covering that said when
[1:22:40] the mystery of god would be fulfilled
[1:22:42] it wasn't talking about some great uh
[1:22:45] something that was to be
[1:22:46] hidden twisted turn my brother and
[1:22:49] sister it was
[1:22:50] you and i with the word living
[1:22:53] in us amen the very life of christ
[1:22:57] in us and the devil come and say but you
[1:23:00] got upset or you did this or you did
[1:23:02] that
[1:23:03] we were just discussing this the other
[1:23:05] day now this is a little bit blunt my
[1:23:07] brother and sister
[1:23:08] and some people would just roll over to
[1:23:10] hear me say this
[1:23:12] but when the prophet of god is talking
[1:23:14] about a cross hanging from his mirror
[1:23:18] that cross wasn't hanging from his
[1:23:19] mirror to keep him from speeding
[1:23:22] that cross wasn't hanging there so that
[1:23:24] he would be
[1:23:25] this or that he brings it right directly
[1:23:28] in a context
[1:23:29] that there would be some pretty woman
[1:23:32] and he would turn his eyes
[1:23:34] now brothers i'm going to tell you
[1:23:36] there's not a man alive
[1:23:39] that is not under that same influence
[1:23:42] but we have a solution and god help us
[1:23:46] to look to the cross let's not hide it
[1:23:48] and let's not bury it and say not in our
[1:23:50] church we don't have those kind of
[1:23:52] spirits
[1:23:52] we don't do this no we're talking about
[1:23:54] human flesh
[1:23:55] hallelujah and so you see my brother and
[1:23:58] sister god chose a man
[1:24:00] oh don't you love this he chose a man
[1:24:03] that would stand and
[1:24:04] tell on himself he didn't say well i
[1:24:07] better hide that because that's going to
[1:24:09] damage my ministry
[1:24:10] 50 years from now
[1:24:13] but the critics go whoa he had a problem
[1:24:17] with women
[1:24:18] so do you buddy
[1:24:21] there's only one thing that cures the
[1:24:23] problem
[1:24:24] and while it's just a symbol hanging
[1:24:26] from the mirror it is a reminder we have
[1:24:29] a cross
[1:24:30] we have blood and we are covered
[1:24:34] we don't sit here uncovered unprotected
[1:24:36] we
[1:24:37] sit here with the power of the cross of
[1:24:39] the blood of jesus christ
[1:24:41] sealing us to the day of our redemption
[1:24:44] hallelujah can someone say amen real
[1:24:46] loud
[1:24:48] see it's not if we keep the creed i'm
[1:24:50] afraid saints and i knows
[1:24:52] i probably come across like hitting this
[1:24:54] a little hard but this is a very strong
[1:24:55] spirit
[1:24:56] and some people are like just do this
[1:24:58] just do this
[1:25:00] just do this just whatever they tell you
[1:25:02] to do just do this
[1:25:03] well that's good that's good i really
[1:25:06] have no problem with that
[1:25:08] but does it make you more spiritual if
[1:25:10] you listen to the tape
[1:25:12] at 2 30 in the afternoon or 4 30 in the
[1:25:15] afternoon
[1:25:16] if you listen to it when god laid upon
[1:25:18] your heart to listen
[1:25:20] that's one thing but to mark
[1:25:23] a day and a time to say i must listen
[1:25:27] no my brother and sister that's becoming
[1:25:30] tradition of men right in our midst
[1:25:34] god help us i want to be led by the holy
[1:25:35] ghost don't you
[1:25:37] i want god to come and i might be just
[1:25:39] totally there and then just be like
[1:25:41] hmm okay uh oh lord
[1:25:44] god of this evil age i'll listen to that
[1:25:48] amen put it on
[1:25:51] amen that's the kind of leadership we
[1:25:53] want
[1:25:54] amen we don't want to pre-programmed
[1:25:58] come on saints we don't want to
[1:25:59] pre-program god is
[1:26:01] tearing the cover off of these spirits
[1:26:05] that we would look and say lord i want
[1:26:06] to be led by your holy spirit
[1:26:08] i want your holy spirit to fall on me
[1:26:11] and seal me to the day of my redemption
[1:26:13] i don't want a man to take that position
[1:26:16] i want you to take that position lord
[1:26:19] amen but see they're total
[1:26:22] amnesians and they don't believe it at
[1:26:24] all my
[1:26:26] how is it that i thought i wouldn't have
[1:26:27] enough to preach tonight can somebody
[1:26:29] answer that for me
[1:26:30] oh mercy amen brother go to romans 4
[1:26:35] amen what shall we say then that abraham
[1:26:38] our father as pertaining to the flesh
[1:26:40] hath found
[1:26:41] for if abraham were justified by works
[1:26:43] he hath whereof to glory
[1:26:45] but not before god see we can do a lot
[1:26:49] of things
[1:26:50] my brother and sister that might even oh
[1:26:52] can i just
[1:26:53] throw myself as an example i might do
[1:26:56] something
[1:26:56] that the church would say oh that was so
[1:26:58] awesome look at brother paul what of it
[1:27:06] tomorrow you'll see me i'll have dirt on
[1:27:07] my face
[1:27:10] well i had dirt all over me today
[1:27:13] amen not i'm talking natural
[1:27:19] nobody misunderstood i'm just talking
[1:27:21] natural
[1:27:24] see so we could come to a place we have
[1:27:26] something to glory about but not before
[1:27:27] god
[1:27:28] for what said the scripture saith the
[1:27:29] scripture abraham believed god
[1:27:32] and it was counted to him for
[1:27:33] righteousness so faith in god
[1:27:35] belief in god's word it was counted for
[1:27:38] righteousness and god is a just
[1:27:40] god so our action believing the word
[1:27:43] will stand and god will count that as
[1:27:45] righteousness for you and i
[1:27:46] this wasn't a one-time event he's laying
[1:27:49] a pattern for us
[1:27:50] to be obedient to the word
[1:27:53] go to the word and it be counted as
[1:27:57] righteousness now to him that worketh
[1:27:59] is a reward not reckoned of grace but of
[1:28:01] debt
[1:28:02] but to him that worketh not but
[1:28:04] believeth on him that justify the
[1:28:06] ungodly
[1:28:06] his faith is counted for righteousness
[1:28:08] even as david
[1:28:10] also describeth the blessedness of the
[1:28:12] man into whom god
[1:28:13] imputeth righteousness without works
[1:28:16] saying blessed are they whose iniquities
[1:28:19] are forgiven and whose sins are
[1:28:23] he's not talking about its sins exposed
[1:28:27] god doesn't view it as exposed
[1:28:30] god looks at it as i have uncovered this
[1:28:33] and they have come and said lord forgive
[1:28:36] me right
[1:28:36] according to the word and god is only
[1:28:39] looking
[1:28:40] at the covering he's not even bringing
[1:28:43] up here yeah i had a bunch of filthy
[1:28:46] things i had to cover in their life
[1:28:48] a bunch of stuff i had to get out and i
[1:28:50] was disappointed with them and i this
[1:28:52] no my brother and sister he comes down
[1:28:54] says blessed are they
[1:28:56] whose iniquities are forgiven our
[1:28:58] shortcomings
[1:28:59] are forgiven and who sins
[1:29:03] oh this disturbs my heart sins
[1:29:06] our cover hallelujah
[1:29:10] and it don't matter what man's memory is
[1:29:12] out here when god looks as we know
[1:29:14] according to the word
[1:29:15] he says i don't even know what their sin
[1:29:18] was
[1:29:19] because when i cover something with the
[1:29:20] blood it is so
[1:29:22] thorough i can't even go back to that
[1:29:25] in that beautiful blessed in the man
[1:29:28] whom the lord will not
[1:29:29] impute sin anybody blessed here tonight
[1:29:34] hallelujah i'll tell you what my brother
[1:29:36] and sister that word that brings
[1:29:37] blessing and covering to you
[1:29:39] amen brings an uncovering to others
[1:29:44] they can't hide their sin no longer what
[1:29:46] was not sin
[1:29:47] when jesus spoke out became sin to them
[1:29:51] amen what is this i'm not trying to
[1:29:53] interpret the scripture but this is just
[1:29:55] what come to me
[1:29:56] he takes away their excuse
[1:30:01] lord i couldn't serve you because of
[1:30:03] this
[1:30:05] lord i couldn't because of that
[1:30:09] lord i come on we all have one or
[1:30:12] had one what god does is he comes and
[1:30:17] brings revelation to us that i don't
[1:30:19] need an excuse
[1:30:21] i need to follow the word i need to go
[1:30:24] with the word
[1:30:25] let's hurry right along here amen ruth
[1:30:28] the third chapter now let me just
[1:30:30] interject this i cut this short so i
[1:30:32] wouldn't go too long and i've already
[1:30:33] gone longer than i planned
[1:30:35] look ruth look at ruth now
[1:30:38] here she is mobidus
[1:30:42] totally can't be in the lineage of god
[1:30:43] right she's a mobius
[1:30:45] come on right nobody's going to heaven
[1:30:47] but those in the message right
[1:30:55] so if she's not a hebrew or
[1:30:58] let's just call a jew if she's not a jew
[1:31:01] she's out forget it
[1:31:04] isn't that really strange right there in
[1:31:05] that little short pattern of time
[1:31:08] before our lord jesus comes he just
[1:31:11] keeps throwing in these women
[1:31:13] that most of us would have rejected
[1:31:17] she's just not good enough
[1:31:21] salman big handsome
[1:31:24] rugged warrior of the warriors
[1:31:29] you what
[1:31:34] you're backslid brother you marry her
[1:31:38] you've blew it
[1:31:43] but there again another vision or type
[1:31:46] of christ when he looked
[1:31:50] at rahab he saw
[1:31:53] one washed one
[1:31:56] whose iniquities were covered
[1:32:00] forever he
[1:32:03] didn't see an ex
[1:32:08] fill in the blank
[1:32:11] he saw a daughter of god
[1:32:16] oh hallelujah
[1:32:20] here's ruth all this is new to her she's
[1:32:24] never been in that kind of church
[1:32:25] services before
[1:32:27] she's never prayed that way she's never
[1:32:29] trusted god that way she's never
[1:32:32] and it all comes down to naomi says now
[1:32:34] ruth
[1:32:36] it's obvious you're in love with the guy
[1:32:38] and it's pretty obvious
[1:32:40] he's in love with you so what do you got
[1:32:43] to do ruth
[1:32:44] you've been uncovered everyone knows
[1:32:48] who you are knows that you are a widow
[1:32:52] now pardon me for putting it this way
[1:32:54] but i hope you understand
[1:32:55] why i put it this way you already been
[1:32:59] with a man
[1:33:03] i was methodist i was baptist office
[1:33:05] nazarene i was this i was
[1:33:08] already been with a man
[1:33:12] but god knowing that when he covers
[1:33:15] our sin and iniquity it's not
[1:33:18] found any longer amen so what does he do
[1:33:22] he doesn't send her down there
[1:33:24] and get he doesn't give boaz an
[1:33:26] anointing
[1:33:27] to get down oh i hope you guys get this
[1:33:30] he didn't give an anointing to boaz
[1:33:32] to go out in the field and bow before
[1:33:34] ruth and say ruth will you be my wife
[1:33:38] because there has to be a type that he
[1:33:40] carries through the word
[1:33:43] and so what does she do when she comes
[1:33:45] to that place that she realizes
[1:33:46] something's got to happen
[1:33:48] and she goes and she lays down and he
[1:33:51] says who art thou
[1:33:52] and she answered i am ruth thy handmaid
[1:33:56] look at the revelation right there
[1:33:57] saints i hope you catch it tonight
[1:33:59] spread it spread therefore thy
[1:34:04] skirt over thy handmaid
[1:34:07] she had already been uncovered and now
[1:34:11] god bringing the type of his word and
[1:34:13] covering her
[1:34:15] and she laid there an act of submission
[1:34:18] amen and
[1:34:22] he knew the word amen
