god but i'll tell you right now he's got a holtz of our hand amen he's guiding us through this land that we're in right now the world that we're in right now he's guiding us he's leading us and all i can say is thank you lord amen for his blessings hallelujah amen just want to wish each one of you a happy easter god bless you amen you know i i was a little concerned for a moment there brother chris you know but we understand sometimes anointing's just not limited one person my brother and sister it's beautiful he died on the cross for you and i but we know that it goes back even further than that there before the foundation of the world he was a lamb that was slain but it's no no matter it's no value it's nothing if he's not resurrected and you and i hallelujah i got nervous there for a second brother chris i thought oh my he's gonna he's gonna but you know we look at this hallelujah every day is resurrection day to the believer hallelujah what a privilege how beautiful amen i want to bring you greetings from our brother manasseh amen just texting with him just uh briefly this morning giving him blessings on this beautiful easter day and he sends his blessings and greetings back to you the church amen so god bless you all hallelujah it's good to be in the house of the lord today many things you know god's just he's so gracious we're looking the life around us and and uh you know it's just uh interesting how that that we see the word coming to pass but we also see i don't know brothers when it come in the mail whatever but a open envelope to the church here some literature from a ministry a redemption or uh reclamation ministries and and there i i just glanced through it there this morning and and uh you know they're so close they're so close but they're just missing that one ingredient they're just missing that they're they're talking about the antichrist they're recognizing that the pope is gaining power and they're recognizing that the vast majority of the government of the united states is by people who describe themselves as adherents to the catholic faith and we just see the signs of the times but my brother and sister close is not close enough we got to say thank you this morning that god has dealt with you and i personally that he come down and said you are one that i called you are one that i have named amongst the names amen that are recorded in the book and your name is there and i want you to recognize your name is there you've heard my call hallelujah hallelujah let's just uh stand i want to start by speaking to you this morning on redemptions manifestation we're going to talk about resurrection life amen my brother and sister many people today the churches are full we come up my brother jason would have come up the same road sister emmy uh we passed the church down the road here they've got signs for parking everywhere all over the streets across the road filling up everything it's easter we've got to go to church but to the believer every day as i said is a resurrection day every day is a day that we worship amen we're not here looking for bunny rabbits and little eggs full of candy although that's fine if the kids are picking up some deals that's fine but we got to teach them what it's about amen it's okay to actually have an activity i read a interesting note here a while back and i don't remember the number so i don't want to quote it directly but it's it's in the millions of bunny rabbits that have been sold in the last few days and it also said that in the next few days 60 to 70 percent of those bunny rabbits will be abandoned now i want you to catch what that is it's easter we must buy our children a bunny we must take them to church but before the week is out we will have abandoned it because you see if it's real you'll follow up on it if it's real it becomes your life hallelujah you know brother chris sister kristen i hope you don't mind you know they love their bunny that thing gets trapped and disappears and they're like going our poor bunny is gone they find their bunny and they rejoice you see that's somebody who loves their bunny they didn't buy it because it was easter hallelujah i didn't buy into god because it was easter i bought into god if you would say so because he already bought into me he loved me when i was unlovable he loved me when i i didn't know that i needed loved and my heart is just rejoicing john the 11th chapter we want to talk about resurrection life today i kind of spill the beans i guess it's easy to do we realize my brother and sister it's just fine to talk about our lord jesus christ dying on a cross at calvary gog off the hill but uh we want that resurrection life to be in us hallelujah and you know it's time i think i keep i keep you know going back and forth to this it's time for us saints to get a little more confidence to stand up and literally make the declaration and never back away from it again that the reason that there was a calvary is you and i he didn't do that just to say i died he did that because he was making a claim to the world to the devil of who it was the world today will fill up the church's record numbers john 11 starting with the 20th verse amen then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but mary sat still in the house then said martha unto jesus lord if thou hast been here my brother had not died pretty strong words isn't it she's telling him this is how it would be if you had been here he wouldn't have died see she failed to recognize the true plan of god the resurrection had to be manifested as a testimony a pre-figure to the resurrection and my brother and sister there's some around the message that would disagree with me but you see the rapture is not an event in the future the rapture is taking place right now because there's got to be a rapturing of the hearts and minds as it were of the bride of christ before the rapture comes there is a catching away there is a claiming there is a changing taking place amongst the people and so we look as brother chris i got nervous about him this morning you know we're looking to that day we're looking to events we're looking to things to happen but my brother and sister the most important thing is to look to where we are today and to make sure that the resurrection life is kindled in us today the fire is burning amen it's not enough to talk about it it's not enough to confess it's going to take place not to say we're looking for a day somewhere in the future the rapture my brother and sister is being manifested this morning right here the resurrection is being manifested here this morning but i know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of god god will give it thee now she had revelation on that didn't she jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again and martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live now i want you to look at this my brother sister the way that is written in verse 25 though he were dead you see that doesn't necessarily mean everyone must be beyond the mortal life though he were dead it's placing them in a category because we know that death to the believer is only a separation from the carnal natural life into the presence of god and we know that death as it were is only a separation and when one is dead in christ if he is in the lord he is then dead to himself if he is in the flesh he has been separated from god you see how's this paradox that's in there but he's telling him even though he were dead yet shall he live and whoso liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this and i say lord i believe heavenly father we ask for your hand of mercy today speak to us i pray father guide our words your name amen you may be seated saints as i look at my notes here i have in bold letters here we celebrate jesus rising from the dead i want to know if you're celebrating your rising from the dead you see there comes a time it's not boastful it's not of our own merit our own values but there comes a time that we must recognize lift our hands and our hearts to say thank you lord i've been raised from the dead amen nothing can go back and change as it were our lord jesus christ amen we think about this uh remember the near kinsman redeemer and how when that come to pass that the near kinsman redeemer is standing there and he has his opportunity to redeem but he says i'm not going to redeem because it might mar my own inheritance now we understand my brother and sister in this scripture how we can type this over to how us being born and shaped born in sin shaped in iniquity that we have a near kinsman redeemer but i'm telling you today he would not mar his testimony because he was afraid that if he laid his life down paid the price for you that he could not raise it up again so he says i will not die for them i will try to take what god has already given and i will try to pervert that i will try to make a claim as it is my own but my brother and sister the word of god says i will never lose a one amen each one i have called will come hallelujah aren't you glad this morning that we'll look at this and remember this near kinsman redeemer satan not willing to risk his life for your life then why would we give our life for him amen that's the paradox of the world that we live in today is that one who is not willing to risk his life for them but they'll risk and give their life for him and so we look at this my brother and sister in such a fashion to realize as it is that we celebrate jesus rising from the dead and there comes a season according to the word of god that we as sons and daughters will rise up and we will give praise and glory and honor to the king for we now can stand and celebrate rising from the dead and so though we were as dead we are now living and so we recognize the resurrection life the resurrection power that has been given to us amen so you know my brother and sister we celebrate the death unto life in us and we recognize that we as sons and daughters of god must die it is a paradox as we look at this to realize that the more that we die the more we live amen and satan has perverted that and says you know what them poor christians they just got they're just so bound down they don't get to do nothing well my brother and sister we get to do something we get to worship the king and he blesses us and life is good and everything is good wait oh oh you don't get to know my brother and sister there's no desire in us to do that there's no looking at that saying look what i'm giving up if we're still in a position today where we're looking at something and saying oh to serve god i have to give this up then you need to get down to an altar somewhere because the real heart of a son or daughter of god that's had a life-changing event is not looking at the things of the world saying i wished i could be that but i have to be this no it's a change a nature change amen it's not just a going to church it's not just acknowledging that christ died on calvary millions of people will acknowledge that today without a nature change come on my brother and sister it takes a temper away from us it takes the pride of life and the lust of the flesh it takes all of these things that's what a nature change is it's not a mental conception that god did this so we're okay my brother and sister a nature change now look the devil will come in there and he throws all kinds of traps and stumbling stones and you know railroad tracks as it were and and all kinds of stuff to get that but don't forget my brother and sister there is resurrection life in you and every day that we live we're coming closer to the resurrection amen to that great manifestation that it would be and if there is no resurrection life in us then all of this is in vain we're wasting our time i think sometimes it's just good to get right down where the rubber meets the road right amen the rubber meets the road says if this is not changing us if this is not giving us a hope or a vision then we're wasting our time but still i wished i had that i'd i think i might just get it into the memory in the computer back there so we can post it you know just a lovely writing that somebody said you know if if you're in sin still come to church if you're this and that goes through the whole gamut of human frailty and and weakness and and whatever if you're doing it still come to church if you're doing it still come to church because it's by the washing of the water of the word amen but you need to come to a place that you can recognize god is doing something in me amen don't just sit back and say well if god wants to be a christian then god will make me a christian no my brother and sister there's something in you and i something that's alive something that's growing each and every day that's pulling us into the presence of almighty god hallelujah amen now i want to just read hebrews 9 11 through 17 but christ become a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood in that beautiful his own blood he then replaced as it were the blood of the goat and the calf because you see my brother and sister the blood of the goat and calf covered sins in the past it didn't change the nature of the man but god said i've got a better covenant that's going to change the nature of the man that we no longer even have need to offer the goat and the calf or the turtle dove because the nature of the man himself will be changed oh how glorious how beautiful neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered into one holy place having obtained eternal redemption no expiration date no cancellation date look we live in a council society they're trying to cancel everything but there's something they cannot cancel and that is the redemption of the blood of jesus christ no matter how they speak ill of it no matter how little respect they have of it they can't cancel it because it's an eternal redemption and aren't you glad this morning we possess that eternal redemption they can cancel it and turn it all into a form of godliness they can turn it all into some kind of uh idolatry my brothers and sisters what it comes down to it comes down to an idolatry that that we go to church and we say these words and we do this and all as well but there's no life there because they're still trying to cancel it by the blood of bulls and goats they never accepted the plan of god which brought us into a plan of eternal redemption they say we believe that we believe that but they're not acting upon it amen for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkle the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more can i say that again how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered mankind no let's get this down into a level offered me offered you he come and made the offer to you not something just in general not something vague but to us he made this offer and it will be to us to accept or decline oh hallelujah you know i love free moral agency my brother and sister and if god had not left this door open there would be no free moral agency but i'm telling you i thank god because my spirit is weak your spirit is weak sometimes we get under a burden we get under anointing and we just almost get this attitude does it even matter but the holy spirit comes along and nudges you and keeps nudging you until you're there and something sparks inside of you and you say i can't quit i can't walk away i can't deny this oh we'll be a peter no no no i wasn't what the words were peter actually spoke we might be shocked that peter the apostle might have used some words that we would have blotted out or blurred or went burp over in his denying no i'm not br b of that crocodile oh peter left us because he wasn't one of us no peter went out and wept bitterly because while he didn't have the courage to stand he was anointed to fulfill the word pretty short prophecy saints when you think about it jesus told him you'll deny me thrice before the crows it wasn't weeks months and years such a short time peter said i wouldn't deny you lord i couldn't deny you but when my flesh is weak and my spirit is dampened and the devil says you know what you're just not good enough you're just not good enough have you ever noticed how god might let you go for a few days might let you wallow in the sauce of your own pity but then he comes along and the word comes to you and starts saying that's not who you are why was you listening to him why was you thinking his thoughts why was you receiving that anointing that's not who you are and something inside of you gets you out of your pity and you start to say that's right that's right that's not who i am i never believed that's who i was why did i listen come on am i alone hallelujah this is god's great plan my brother and sister moving us along and satan has to get creative but i'll tell you he's so creative that he's managed to take the word loser which is tattooed you might say upon his forehead and tried to convince the world that he's the winner but that doesn't change the fact he's a loser and he knows he's a loser so he's going to take whoever he can with him on his losing journey i don't sign up for that i refuse to be identified with that amen hallelujah how much more oh look at that my brother and sister under this verse 13 the old testament under that anointing there was many a man woman and child lived exactly to the best of their ability according to god's word for the day this is not something i've heard him preach that the old testament was actually almost like a failure of the plan of god nonsense there were people that lived overcoming lives in the old testament there were people that lived according to the word in the old testament but we have mowed so much more hallelujah how much more shall the blood of christ look at this raising us up enoch was an overcomer please god and did not see death amen under the old covenant but we under the new covenant have so much more oh hallelujah hallelujah how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit holy ghost offered himself without spot now this might sound arrogant to a person who doesn't have revelation but if jesus christ can do it could do it i can do it whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa paul you just stepped over the line no sir i'm ahead of myself a little bit but i'll just go ahead and say it all that was in christ he poured into who who's the church right here this morning so all that was in christ he poured into you and i and he overcome every sin and every transgression and every struggle there was so i can also all i've got to do is let the life of christ completely fill me hallelujah amen oh is it all right if we get excited this morning i'll tell you i went to bed last night like okay lord i've got this i got this i don't know what to say lord how do i put this together but i'll tell you god is faithful he'll come right down he'll let words be spoken he'll let you listen to something and my brother and sister god will just give an inspiration to you to take a hold and say this is mine hallelujah purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god oh now look what dead works are say yeah about when i was back in denomination i'm talking about yesterday let what hindered you yesterday die stand up and take a hold of the word and say i might have failed i might have got angry at my wife my children i gotta go upset about this that and the other yesterday but today i'm gonna let that die a little bit more and take a hold of a little bit more christ and then overcoming power one day you'll wake up and realize that man they used to identify as having a temper no longer has a temper and somebody say well maybe he's just old and tired no maybe he's delivered because i met some 90 year olds that got a temper enough to fight a buzz saw unfortunately i was the direction of their buzz saw hallelujah now look at this for this cause he is a mediator of a new testament and that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance isn't that beautiful my brother and sister but you understand i'm just going to take a a loose liberal interpretation of some of the things the prophet of god said he said that you have to die you want more of god you've got to give more of yourself you want more of god in your life you have to die more and more and more so this experience we call a christian experience isn't just jesus dying on the cross it's you and i dying on our cross hallelujah and we have such a desire to live that that's one of our biggest problems isn't it it's our desire to live and then under that nature we want to live the way we want to live but god says i want you to die and i want you to live my way to live die to you live to me hallelujah well you know that's exactly what he did for you and i he died to himself right oh if we were there my brother and sister and witness calvary when he said lord not my will but thine be done we would realize that was not just some random words that was an agonizing giving into the will of god i pray my brother and sister and i'll put my name on the top of the list not to take priority but to let you know i belong on that list that we need to be praying that prayer a little more often lord not my will lord but thy will be done and it would change the directions i'll tell you sometimes it changed our decisions hallelujah for where a testament is there must also be necessity be the death of the testador that's right for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator living did you just hear what i read oh praise the lord this come into effect after jesus was dead no this scripture's talking about you i'm a believer i'm a believer if you still live your own life come on we not know our preaching condemnation this morning but while you still live your life will testify against your confession that i'm a christian am i too close to home should i come a little closer to home hallelujah while we are still in the flesh we're still in our own mind in our own spirit our own words our own actions our own life will testify directly against you being a christian but i'll tell you what the minute you start dying the minute you start giving yourself over your life your testimony starts to blossom and people start to say i see something in him he's different she's different what's happening or dying he's living but as long as we are living our testimony will be a paradox i'll be back in a few minutes i've got to go in the back room and cry because how many times does our life defy our testimony don't get condemnation die amen go to your own personal calvary as it were and just die lord thy will be done hallelujah now we look at this my brother and sister just kind of moving forward here got so much that i want to share this morning and and i i just need to move right along now in this message the sermon i know brother branham is actually speaking of job i encourage once again each one of you to um go back study these things you have the reference point you can find it on the website and and you know so you don't have to write a thousand notes right now or be afraid you'll miss something but he's really talking about job before this and after this but i want i just wanted to catch the spirit of these words right here oh blessed be the name of the lord i'm so glad that i'm a part of easter now we didn't have an easter egg hunt we haven't had bunnies we didn't have a camel in our church today we didn't make some big program about this because you see that was man's version well actually not even man's version it's the devil's version of easter he watered that thing down to where praise the lord we were so blessed we watched the same donkey for the last 24 years and the camel and uh happened to know the guy who owns the camel and you know he says you know this whole easter thing is the only reason i own a camel because it just blesses everybody i have not found anywhere in scripture a camel blessing the people so you see where people are at when it comes to easter they just see the camel and they've watched this camel for 25 years and this is just so oh god bless the camel come on saints i'm not trying to be funny i'm so glad that i'm apart can i interpret the word the prophet's words this morning i'm so glad i'm a part of the resurrection that's what easter is it's not bunny rabbits and it's not eggs and it's not camels and donkeys and whatever my brother and sister i'm so glad i'm a part of the resurrection you see he comes right here and says it you see i wasn't original i like to preach a defensible gospel right i'm so glad i'm a part of easter then i'm a part of that resurrection we are part of it this morning because in us not around us not in our church not in our prophet not in the preachers but in us dwells that resurrection life that is the partaker that brought easter so you see the resurrection life can be right here this morning but we have to be a partaker we have to be an active partaker of the resurrection it's not one sunday a year that brought easter i know that my redeemer these words right i know that my redeemer what do you know i'm not guessing at it you got we got too much guessing today i know my redeemer liveth yes sir i want to ask you this morning do you know hallelujah aren't you glad this morning you can say i know my redeemer liveth this is not a ceremony that we're just partaking in he's real he's alive he's here today the same god that stood right there my brother and sister with the prophet of god discern the hearts of the people change lives open the word is here this morning oh how do you know because he said he would be now i'll compliment as it were my brother and sister to you he said where two or three are gathered in my name and we're not gonna say now there's one there's one there's one i'm more confident than that there is and there is and there is and there is and there is we've got a multitude of the two or three that believe this morning and so if god promised to be here where two or three were gathered in his name what would he do with the bulk or the whole of great tabernacle this morning believing the word don't let satan limit you we have been given a multiplied power in this last hour you say what do you mean by that brother paul the prophet of god said that god would pour out everything that was in heaven into the midst of his bride and that she would receive the word and she was an overcomer hallelujah we're not here defeated i i rebuke in the name of jesus christ that defeated christian spirit i rebuke it the day for that should be over we are the bride of christ and the work has been manifested it's been open it's been revealed it's been laid out clear and revelation has come that we can look at the book and say praise god that's what he meant [Applause] we're not guessing we're not hoping we're knowing oh hallelujah i'm not guessing at it we got too much guessing today can we say that together i know my redeemer liveth hallelujah not a hope soul amen you see resurrection life those words of life already been spoken it's pretty funny i don't mean to make this a negative note okay but we got people well i'll tell you what i i just um i left the message because you know brother branham said this this and this and i'm thinking yeah brother brown did say that but so did my bible amen you see that anointing comes and they need someone i know none of you have ever done this none of you have ever stopped and looked around said who can i blame this on come on come on saints let's just stand up and say lord i'm in the house of god and the word said that i come here to judge myself i don't come here you know it's kind of like look at the floor this happened many years ago i looked at the floor one time and our family got done eating supper and i told jerry i said my goodness look at the mess these kids have made she didn't say anything and later on in the evening she goes paul i just want to correct something i was like what's that that's where you were sitting like father like son i'll tell you what my brother and sister we're looking at this word are you with me it's open if i can ever get going here i need to gain some traction hallelujah resurrection life my brother and sister the words of life have already been spoken we don't even come on are you with me we don't have to go back and say brother branham open the words of life to us no my brother and sister before the foundation of the world the words of life were spoken a prophet come and set it all in order and draw our attention correctly to the word but you see the words had already been spoken you see when god said let there be light he couldn't go for a little while and say you know i've changed my mind so when the words of life were spoken before the foundation of the world and each one of us was placed in the book and our name wrote there in his own precious blood he could come along and say you know i think i'll take their name out i don't like the sound of that name you know some of you guys name your kids some weird names it's a good deal that some of these old-fashioned people aren't the ones judging by names they'd go what that don't sound good scratch out now are you with me no he spoke your name he knew what he was speaking when he spoke your name and he spoke the words of life into your name he can't take it back he won't take it back he doesn't want to take it back he knows you he claimed you and he declared you hallelujah somebody ought to stand up shout and say thank you lord hallelujah my name's in that book and it can't be removed the devil's not going to do it the doubters of this world aren't going to do it i don't need a vaccine a passport to claim my position amen i'm not going to come one day have you been vaccinated no sir they're going to come one day my brother and sister and say we thought there was going to be a rapture but they didn't have our approval and we were this and we were that but the bride's going to be gone because she believed the word not what a government said not what the people said not what science said what the word said hallelujah and this bride's got to hold to that word she's not letting go hallelujah amen you see let there be light it cannot be taken back the spoken word i heard it did you amen i heard it i believe it but what's more is it's coming to pass can somebody say it's coming to pass amen i want to ask you this morning have any of your prayers been answered have you seen god move on the scene i'll tell you my brother and sister i've seen god move so many times and it seems almost now don't misunderstand me it almost seems silly some of the things i have spoken and god brought it to pass you might say well that that just really isn't that important in life but god knew my heart he heard my cry and it wasn't that he thought i needed this little simple thing to come to pass he was telling me i heard you i heard you have faith i heard you right come on saints come on he hears us you see the life was released i want to say this once again the life was released by the spoken word it's not a matter of what's going on in our nation it's not a matter of what's going on in the world my brother and sister none of that matters right now the spoken word has been spoken and the life has been released and the life said that he would have a bride that would have not a spot and not a wrinkle so i don't care what the denominational church i don't want to care let me be so bold to say this morning to the world i don't care what's happening in the message around us god's word will come to pass hallelujah you see that life that was released by the spoken words what's living in you it's not it's not anything else it's not a church it's not a deal you realize my brother and sister i'm going to deviate for just a minute i wasn't going to but i'm going to do you realize my brother and sister you go through the message i'm not going to name all of them i'd struggle off top of my head to name them all but the prophet of god lays out again and again and again the power of idolatry amen and the minute the church even embraces i want you to get this embraces that would mean accepting the concept of amen amen prophet of god said the minute the church embraces that the power of god is grounded it's no longer effective could i ask a request of all of you would you just take time in this next week and look through your life and make sure you don't have something that's an idolatry that's exactly right that's exactly right just look through your life and say lord if there's something let me put it this way just ask the lord if there's something in my life lord show me amen you see the scripture declares it the prophet reiterated it idolaters don't go to heaven but look how that spirit of idolatry is so strong and it's creeping in amen hallelujah you know sister jerry and i living in a house now that was occupied by an elderly lady for several years and said empty for three years and i have no idea where the fighters come from but every day we do spider patrol in our house and they just keep coming and they just keep coming this morning i got up and walked through the house and i was like well i know a spider can walk pretty fast but how did you get here in the middle of the ceiling he won't make it any further but that's what satan's doing saints we clean our house are you with me we clean our house and something appears we clean our house and something appears we clean our house and something appears keep cleaning your house don't give up don't become downtrodden disheartened i must not be a christian because all these things just keep coming no just keep cleaning the house keep dealing with it amen god does nothing in vain saints nothing at all in vain why are so people so tossed about what a beautiful picture of the believer in the presence of god all things are his then all things was given to christ all that god was he poured into christ all that christ was poured into the church that day you'll know that i'm in the father and the father and me and i in you oh what a privilege that the believer has if they only could accept it see it's not whether that promise is available to us it is it is not whether it's been manifested somewhere else it's up to you and i to accept that hallelujah and that the beauty of it the world is embracing john 3 16 and i do too but my brother and sister the rest of the bible shows us very clearly that if we want our prayers to be heard then we believe and act on the word of god you know that's a fundamental scripture oh my just slipped my mind brother david help me where's the scripture talking about that those that believe god answers their prayer first on three yeah i'm just my mind's in a muddle i've already went to the next page my brother and sister see they wonder they wonder why the prophet of god come and said what he said had to go back to that scripture but they don't want that scripture they don't believe those scriptures are anointed they believe they're added onto they've been changed they've been misinterpreted my brother and sister but you want your prayers answered then live according to the word that's right you want god to answer your prayer then clean your life up keep keep killing the spiders see that's how it works but i believe i've said this before i'll say it again i'm kind of getting to where i don't like to use the word believer because everybody uses the word believer i'm a believer if we really believe wouldn't we act upon it if somebody said you know what brother paul you're going to go home today there's going to be a package on your step and in that package is going to be this and this a lovely gift for you my brother and sister i wouldn't go ahead and go to boise and then book a vacation i'd drive to my house and i would see if that package was there because if i believed that i would want to act upon it that's right i'll leave that one alone it'd be misinterpreted for sure hallelujah it's like an old timer once said he said only a fool gallops his horse where the ground squirrel lives all that god was he poured into christ all christ was poured into poured into the church that day you'll know that i'm in the father and the father in me and i in you look the prophet of god doesn't say whoa this is gonna be hard for you to live this is going to be difficult when you have to live up to this standard of the word he says no it's a privilege that the believer has if they only accept it so he put a little caveat you might say to that we can't just say okay the prophet said it the word says that that's good we've got to accept it we've got to accept it lord take that into our heart today lord i want to receive that i want to accept it because my brother and sister the book says the word of god says that we're gonna see signs and wonders done at the hands of the apostle meaning sons and daughters of god acting on the word not a dead church not a something we're looking for days gone by but he said it would happen here accept it and we're not saying that so that we'll have all kinds of signs and shouting and running and bouncing off the walls i'm saying it because the power of god is contained in that word and when that word is opened and we receive the word we receive the power of that word hallelujah come back simple once again to say you are the church and all that was poured into christ has been poured into you i'm an overcomer amen laodicea there's no spirit of laodicea gonna stop me from making a rapture amen i am looking at the image of my lord jesus which the prophet of god said not just your in his image he said you are a part of him oh hallelujah not just an image of him my brother and sister we can project an image on the wall that don't make me part of it but when i become part of what is happening the plan of god then the power that's in that word and our lord jesus passed out of this life in the human flesh as a victorious warrior he was not there in defeat he fulfilled catch this you say but he was crucified my brother and sister he fulfilled god's calling in his life right to the very t because he was god himself and god's own plan had to be fulfilled and god oh wow we're getting off into this but god come down created this body of flesh that gives given the name of jesus and he stepped into that body and he come down here and fulfilled everything he had declared through the ages prophecies that were 800 years old and he come down and fulfilled it oh hallelujah you talk about something incredible you imagine if you were a bystander and let god let you go back through the ages and you were setting oh well saints i hope you see this you were sitting there on the day of golgotha on the day that they crucified our lord jesus but you have the revelation that god has given you in the word right now and they would all be over there crying they've crucified our lord jesus they've crucified our redeemer they've crucified our savior and you church with me over there on the side hallelujah hallelujah they crucified him they say they're crazy but you see we could see this whole plan we're going to see what's come to the fulfillment through the ages and we're going to see it coming in place coming in place but we'll get up tomorrow morning and it'll be woe is me who always me is so hard my job and this and my children and my marriage and this and that woe is me are you serious god help us god help us he said i gave you the victory it's already yours it is yours to claim it or refuse it it's up to you but here's the victory here's overcoming power yes sir back in that day they would say how can you rejoice of them crucifying savior you realize how much more revelation god has given us in this day there's people around this message say well do you think we have more revelation than the apostles had yes we do not by our knowledge of the word but by the fact we've sought and it has become reality it is no longer words on a page to us it is life does that make us more spiritual no i read the words of paul and i'm just stunned how a man who could spend that time in arabia and come back and everything he preached lined up perfectly with everyone's revelation that was called of god i'm horrible at that amen i'm just excited every once in a while you know that i preach something find out somebody else somewhere else preach the same thing i'm just like wow how did that happen i'll tell you how it happened same holy ghost amen same god that allowed chris to get up here and terrify me with his words before he prayed right god dealing not one individual we got nobody to lift up to that's idolatry this is the holy ghost dealing with us church we ought to be praying that every one of us comes on the same page nothing tickles my heart more than to have people say i was just reading that scripture i was just reading that quote come on it tickles my heart not to say look what paul's done my brother and sister if you guys seen how paul studied sometimes you guys would say man we need to elect somebody that at least has his act together but don't worry about it i didn't change just become a preacher it's the same way i did my homework when i was in school they call it add now but when i see it on the page i say add okay i'm going to add something it's not add i just got to keep adding hallelujah once again church it was poured into you in the sermon the unveiling of god brother braham says here now the greek word there for that form i've been looking at it all day yesterday trying to think out what it was mean the prophet of god didn't sit down in a chair and just no sir he says right here i've been looking at it all day yesterday trying to think out what it was and i find come with this word of in morphe it spell the n m-o-r-p-h-e looking in the greek to find out what in morphe was i may pronounce that wrong but reason i spell it when if the tape is released the people will scholars will know what what i mean by it he when the and more faith that means that he changed himself he come down he he come down now the greek word there means that something that could not be seen yet it's there then it's changed and the eye can catch it amen think about this that's why the prophet of god said this word of god can't be explained god's got to change the eye to see it because you see if we could explain it we could just go hold vast coliseums and explain it but the word says he would hide it from those less they would see it and hear it and act on it and he would have to save them seems like a paradox right okay let's look at this this is really the quote right here i got excited right here in this portion like elijah was at dothan see the servant couldn't see all those angels around there and god just changed not brought the angels down but he changed the seeing of the servant and there was the mountains full of angels and fire and horses of fire and chariots of fire all around his prophets see they he changed the seeing the thing is already there i tell you my brother and sister my heart's desire is that god would come right down in our midst today and open our eyes to see the power of almighty god and the word manifested that is already here but what has happened is we don't see it we start to question it we pull back from it we have a little doubt here a little fear there and we say well this probably isn't so i don't know my brother and sister it's not the word it's not with god it's not with the holy ghost it's your eyes lord open my eyes change me lord to see what you're doing change me to see that this room according to the word of god has angels all about hey man now you want to go the other way let me just throw this out here and a couple of joy out of you in case you're one of those people that likes to go to the theater i hope none of you would raise your hand and say i enjoy going to the theater the prophet of god said in them theaters devils are hanging all over everything if you like to go to the theater i want you to be reminded when you walk into it next time brother paul's praying that your eyes are open that's right amen and i hope it scares the bajibers out of you come on come on saints it's time for us to get the rubber on the road time for us to recognize this is not a game amen so there it is there's a prophet and he's telling them don't worry about it his servant's saying but lord look at this well we got a problem he doesn't say now lord this and that he says lord if you would just open his eyes our way of looking at it suddenly god started piling angels on the hills no sir they were there all the time [Music] hallelujah amen it changed the seeing the thing is already there and that's what revelation is in this word my brother and sister god didn't come down and have to morph his word around and change that what he does he comes along and by the grace of god by revelation we start to see amen we start to see that these things are coming to pass we start to see how what god meant when he spoke these things through a prophet hallelujah let's go ahead i i just included this and i was almost skipped it so what i'm trying to say that god that always was is here does it get any simpler than that the god that always was take this second it just ticked and go all the way through history that god is here right now i say in all sincerity lord change our seeing amen lord change us we are not woe be gone we are not forsaken we are not left never been abandoned we can stand and see the vision to know that god in his power and his majesty is right here surrounding you as sons and daughters of god but you have to accept it oh lord help us the only thing he done when he become man he changed his mask come on saints go right back through the message go back right back through this scripture that was god that was god walking on the road to emmaus that was god there when those people said did you not know what has happened what history has played out and how our redeemer our savior the messiah has been taken from us and jesus own word said i'll not leave you comfortless and he fulfilled his word right there before their eyes what did they see a changing in their seeing and they said hey and he was gone revelation they saw that christ was right there in their midst my brother and sister i pray today that we could grasp this in a fashion to realize our healing has not escaped us the holy ghost has not escaped us amen the power of god in our midst for our young people and for life and necessities of life and the cares of life god has not forsaken us but our vision our seeing has looked to our circumstance our seeing has looked to the problems of life our seeing has looked to everything but calvary and when we look away my brother and sister it's not our responsibility to make it come to pass our responsibility is to believe it and when we believe it god will bring it to pass but you walk in a half-hearted approach to the word and you'll get a half-hearted response out of god he said you draw nigh unto me i'll draw an eye unto you and if god won't fulfill that then god's a liar and we don't want to follow him but my god is not a liar he's worth following he's the word he's the way the truth and the life we're going to stop letting the devil deceive us we got to stop letting the devil present another image we gotta stop getting these little doubts in our mind when we see the failures of life and the cares of life and we gotta say lord open my eyes change my seeing change my seeing lord you said you would be here with me i know you are open my eyes lord i want to ask you saying when was the last time you prayed a prayer like that open my eyes lord i want to see you but we prayed for better jobs and we prayed for this and we prayed for that what we need to pray for is to see jesus christ in a clearer vision sorry for yelling at you oh hallelujah and on the other hand even though i've spoke those words and i don't back up on them i want to tell you rejoice today because our seeing has been changed we see this word for the hour we see a revealed gospel it's not just this same old tummy rot that's being peddled and people call it the gospel the gospel the gospel come to our gospel dance come to our gospel come to our gospel whatever know my brother and sister we serve a holy god we serve a righteous god and he wants a holy people and a righteous people to serve him one that will stand up and say lord correct me you know how painful that is brother chris when he preached the other day i don't remember the exact context forgive me but he was talking about something and he said huh and that's like praying for patience well brother chris i wasn't here at service but i was there going that's right and it takes almost an act of god for us insincere to say lord give me more patience yeah that's right brother trevor we should be praying in sincerity lord whatever he takes lord hallelujah whatever it takes lord i want to have the right ingredients sister jerry made a carrot cake yesterday i tell on you brother jason for aesthetics i think is the reason she cut off one layer one portion of the cake so it set flat on the plate i think you know we don't want any of them cakes that got a big hump in them it's got to look good and that's laying there on a on a plate jason said is that to eat i said i think that's what she made it for brother jason said i'll cut it right here and you take the other half i have to admit i agreed but then i think he felt bad so he cut it in quarters put a little frosting on it tasted good i i just i don't want to draw your mind to food but we are closing last night we're getting in bed and sister jerry says i should have just let you eat the cake i i don't know what i did wrong i think it's a little dry let's go do it let's not talk about tomorrow let's not talk about next week let's get our jammies on and let's go in the kitchen right now and let's eat a cake and she's like no no i wasn't serious now i say this in humor saints i want to know what's stopping you from getting out of your chair right now and taking the good word of god and digging into that and eating it oh the pastor's a little emotional he gets excited oh there's this and i don't want to embarrass myself there's this and there's this this go ahead sit back i'll eat the cake and i'll tell you how it was you see my brother and sister the day is too far the forest spent day as far spent day is far spent there's no more time for when we get the right preacher and we get the right meetings we get to write this if the word says it ask god to open your eyes to it stand up take the word hallelujah take the book and eat it hallelujah because you know what i'll get a little off track here but you know what he changed himself to this day feel free to speak out sister jerry's kind of cheating because this is the thing we've been talking about and studying at home hallelujah it's a message of this hour my brother and sister we say we're looking for jesus christ i found him found him i found him i found him i found him he come down poured himself into the bride do you get this follow a scriptural all that he was he poured into christ all the christ was he poured into the church which is you and i the bride so we are all that god is today and so when god said i'm going to present myself to the world in laodicea my brother and sister he's not going to come down as a burning light on a mountain somewhere he's not going to come as it were even though he come in the cloud don't think i'm contradicting that but he's not going to come and all of us have an individual cloud that's right but we all have a personal experience christ himself in us he poured himself we are the representation we are the vision of jesus christ on the earth today hallelujah amen that's where he poured himself hallelujah then after a while you heard the gospel maybe you went to church you picked out this and that and went from denomination to nomination but one day you being a heart you being part of god you had to be part of the word look so when people say well i'm part of god i'm a son of god you are one with the word you can be a son or daughter of god and be opposed to the word come on you had to be part of the word when you heard the word you know where you come from you know what was the truth you were always the seed was in you somebody tell me what he said always the word seen the word i love that i'll tell you i should have had brother alex or whoever was putting this in now i should have had him blow that up big i mean not maybe one word to the line hallelujah that's how it serves my heart amen hallelujah the seed was in you always the word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you come to it oh can someone say thank you lord hallelujah my brother and sister this is the plan of god that the word would be so real in us that the prophet of god when he spoke these words was looking out on the people and he didn't come along and say well i think they are i think this one might be these are my friends so we'll give them a pat on the back you know what the prophet of god was seeing when he was preaching he was saying the word amen the word the word now i was going to include this quote but i didn't but the prophet of god says on this order right here he says there's only two positions two deals we are the word by the word or we are satan by the church well how many wants to just be a church-goer no sir who wants to be that bride that the word the word seen the word hallelujah i've got word in come on let's let's not it's not boastful saints it's not some off the limb thing i've got the word in me and god's seeing the word in me god seeing the word in you and there's something in you drawing you to the word and drawing him to the word and you're meeting there and the prophet of god says that he is half and the bride is the other half and they make up the whole oh hallelujah amen whether you want to talk in the natural you want to talk in the spiritual don't ever find yourself saying my husband and i aren't one you don't find yourself in an argument a disagreement a spirit on you that your husband and you aren't one or your wife and you are one my brother and sister that's the devil speaking and don't you dare speak the devil's language god has come and called this bride to be the half of him to give him up to the half of the kingdom oh don't you love the book of esther amen she didn't walk in there and he said look honey i'll throw a party for you i'll give you a little money on the credit card go down here to macy's and get you some nice clothes what did he say oh you come i'm so pleased with you i'll give you half of my kingdom half of who i am i give to you oh hallelujah now let me bring this and close this before we move on if he'll come along under that anointing and say i'll give you to the half what is it the word that was in him meeting the word that was in you and coming together into the fullness oh the prophet of god said the opening of the seventh seal of the revelation of the fullness of christ oh come on we got a deep mystery here it's got to be this man here it's got to be in europe it's got to be in africa it's going to be in south america it's got to be here it's got to be a great man it's got to be a great man no my brother and sister the manifestation of this revelation is a bride that woke up one day and said i'm half of him here's the revelation i'm half of him call me a fanatic i'm gonna be a happy one oh hallelujah look our seeing has been changed saints but let me tell you i can't show you who you are if it would we just set a little dragnet up here on midland and we'd just funnel the cars through and we'd talk to them and they would be sorry see he had to see the word in them i can't show you who you are but you see god i'm i'm i'm uh what do you call this oh well jason what do you call i'm plagiarizing i'll just tell you right up front i'm plagiarizing brother ron spencer okay hope you i hope you're all good with that if you don't like brother ron's preaching well i don't know what to tell you i can't show you who you are because god's word's already there's no need for me to even try to show you who you are amen now these are my own thoughts it comes a little statement i heard you see the unveiling of god in you is the unveiling of the resurrection in present tense amen hallelujah he's the resurrection he's the way the truth and the life and he's now manifesting himself in me and you and so therefore we are the present tense manifestation of the resurrection it's not for another day not looking for another time maybe the rapture be in the morning or in a week or a year whatever my brother and sister it's god in you right now bringing the manifestation into a reality but we can stand up and say praise the lord i've been changed i've been reborn all my life has been rearranged hallelujah oh but you see the prophet of god tells us he had beaten you already amen hearing this message didn't put it in you it didn't make you it had to already be there now look i want to plagiarize brother ron spencer just a little bit more if you don't mind is that okay hallelujah it's time to shed your grave clothes you're not dead you're not dead you're living amen shed the grave clothes it's time to shed your slave clothes because you are no longer a slave to sin you've been set free hallelujah my brother and sister it's time for us to walk in heavenly places just go study the message the prophet of god says i don't know what's wrong with the people why they refuse or they cannot move on to walk in heavenly places oh my brother and sister let's walk in heavenly places reach out claim on that hallelujah amen as i was studying these things it just struck my heart my brother and sister this is our season of jubilee people are like well you know when we get over yonder there's even that song won't we have a time when we get over yonder well most of you won't make it if you don't find victory now can you write some music for that come on saints oh i'm gonna have a great time when i get to heaven but right now my life is so miserable i can't stand it somebody's lying to you maybe you're lying to you maybe the devil's sitting out on the steps of the church crying because you're blaming him and you're the one that's sitting around here doing what you're doing come on saints it's time this is our jubilee this is our victory we're not going to suddenly have a revelation of how happy we are to be sons and daughters of god when we get to heaven we'll catch that revelation right here and whatever satan is doing right now to bind you listen to me saints whatever satan's doing right now to bind you to keep you from having liberty and having victory in jesus christ right now i want you if you will listen to me i want you in your heart lift a hand whatever you want to do i want you to claim deliverance right this moment i will not walk out of this church today carrying this burden that has robbed me from my victory as a christian as a believer as a bride of christ i refuse satan i rebuke you and bind you to keep the liberty from god's people oh hallelujah well when i get this in my life i hear it from people all the time people call me hey brother paul can i share something a moment of time can i this can i have that my brother and sister and oftentimes i hear this people subconsciously say these things and i've been there so i can sympathize as it were brother paul i know if i could just get beyond this point brother paul if i could just deal with this thing in my life brother paul if this was behind me what's hindering his saints what's hindering us the same god let me plagiarize brother ron spencer one more time a prophet of god was here and he looked out upon the congregation and he says you have a certain such and such god's delivered you we would just be thank you lord but that same god is in this building this morning satan i bind you in the name of jesus christ whatever your story is satan i bind you lord i claim my deliverance in the name of jesus christ you see satan will walk out victorious if you say well as soon as this happens i'll be free well you know what he'll be like you know we've all seen heard red man with the deck of cards pick a card any card have you ever seen that you pull a card out don't show me the card he takes the deck of cards pulls out a card that matches your card and you say how'd you do that you're flabbergasted well what it is you shave the edge of the card and you spray shellac on it and the card that you choose in the beginning was a card that peeped out of the deck at you and you said oh there's one that's easy to get you pull him out but the devil has shaved and slacked and he comes along and he handles the deck there's your ace of spades and you're like that's incredible and the devil's moving in our midst handing out cards he's already shellacked him he's already shaved him and then you wonder why time after time after time your trial seems to be the same trial that keeps carrying on and you say i don't have any deliverance i have not found relief i don't know if god is hearing my prayer what you don't understand is the devil keeps shellacking the cards and bumping the deck and handing you the same trial over and over and god delivers you from that gives victory over that the devil hands it right back to you and we said i guess it must be my course come on saints am i in the dark here why it's time for us to say i'm not walking out of here today until i have victory over this i'm going to believe the word today and i'm going to bind the spirit that's been tormenting my life and i'm going to walk out of here with victory i'm going to walk out of here with joy and walk out of here with the holy ghost on display hallelujah it's time to shed the grave clothes it's time to shake the slave clothes it's time my brother and sister walk in heavenly places oh hallelujah my brother and sister it was just the prophet of god says you were always the seed was in you always let's believe that oh hallelujah hallelujah i'm closing sister emmy will you come romans 8 8-1 amen that's right there's therefore now amen come on let's read the words let's take a claim there is therefore now no this moment right here settled it's finished it's done don't walk out of here with condemnation don't you dare come back up here after you've asked the lord to deliver you from those things and take that back home with you hallelujah don't you dare do the devil's work for him there is now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh you see where our problem is saints the devil tricks us hands us that card again and we go right back and start walking in the flesh again because we don't think oh come on it's not you people but it's people like you we get in church and holy spirit starts to deal with us we go to lift a hand and [Music] kind of put it back down because we weren't very spiritual yesterday and a husband or wife or children or parents might think what is what's going on with them they're acting all religious satan binding that spirit of liberty that got over but it's time no matter what you've said no matter what you've done no matter what your circumstance if you've got sin in your life saints i'm not preaching to you as sinners but you've got sin in your life remember it's this simple lord forgive me wash me with your blood and then when the devil comes to say no no you can't worship you've got this and this and this you can remind them that debt's paid it's always been paid i recognized it's paid now and whether i look like a hypocrite or not saying so you you won't under understand i'm not going to explain it to you whether you look like a hypocrite or not or feel like a hypocrite or not or when anyone who melts might think about you god moves on you you forget about all the rest of that you respond to what god's dealing with you receive it when the prophet of god talks about the ink and the bleach [Music] you realize he's talking real time [Music] drop the drop of ink in the bleach we come back in a month a week a year to see if it's dissolved it no sir it's a matter of it drops into the bleach and the bleach immediately takes effect therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit come on help me say this for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death aren't you glad it's easter hallelujah reminder once again i don't have to go i don't have to find a lamb a
