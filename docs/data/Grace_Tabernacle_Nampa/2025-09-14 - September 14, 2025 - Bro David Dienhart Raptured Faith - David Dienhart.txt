And let's remember the saints and living word fellowship. um and the saints in the northwest. That's the needs that we have. Happy to see brother Luke with us. God bless you. Brother Paul, could you lead us into our prayer today? [Music] Is it good to be in the house of the Lord today? Amen. Now, the word tells us that that we'll ask anything in his name, he will give it to us. And I just encourage each one today, whatever the need is in your life, just ask. Ask from your heart. Amen. Claim it. He made the promise. He will perform it. Heavenly Father, we come before you today, Lord. Another beautiful day to come into the house of the Lord. To be able to stand before you, Lord, to come into your presence. Father, it's with great expectation that we come today, Father. Lord, not to hear a man, not to just be gathered together to greet our friends and fellow saints. But, Father, to come into your presence and have you speak to our hearts today, Father, Lord, just to encourage and strengthen us, Father. For we live in an hour that Satan is so prevalent, Lord. He's so uh so in this world, Father, that if we are not careful, we will find ourselves under the uh influence, under the atmosphere of this world. But, Father, we're not of this world. We are of you, Father. We are sons of God. We are daughters of God. And we've been called to a higher calling. We've been called to dwell in your presence, Father. And Lord, we're asking you to come today. Use our brother David, Lord, just to speak to our hearts, Lord, encouraging us through the word, Father, that raises our faith, Father. Just reading where your prophet said that without faith, we cannot even have action, Father. And without action, we will not see results. And Father, we just ask you to come now. Raise our faith today to claim deliverance if we need deliverance, Lord. claim healing, Father, if we need healing, Lord. Just encouraging words to our souls today. That you would just move us a little closer, Father, to you, Lord. That you would just touch each family, Lord. No matter what our struggle might be, Father, you called us, Lord. It's not the things of this world, Father, but it's your calling in our life, Father, that we respond to. And we just ask you to come for these prayer requests, Lord Jesus. just little Declan and the Nash family. Father, just ask you, Lord Jesus, to be with them. Strengthen them. Let healing virtue flow. Father, we just ask you, Father, for uh Sister Jolyn, not well today. My dear granddaughter Aaliyah, Father, just been plagued, Father, by this little health issue that just keeps coming back again and again. Satan, we bind you in the name of Jesus Christ. She is healed. She has been living the promise, Father, and it is in her, Father. And we let it come forth now, Father, for every need. Uh our brother Moses, Sister Danell, all the saints there in North Idaho. Father, we just ask you to move in their midst, Father, continue to encourage them, Lord Jesus. And we ask you, Father, for every need, Lord, that is in the Northwest, Father. Lord, the churches, the believers, Father, wherever they might be today, you know their circumstance and we ask you to come down, speak to their hearts today. Lord, we just ask you to be with our sister April, Father. She just has a burden upon her heart, Father, to help these, Lord, through the medical, through the sharing of the gospel, Lord, through the living of the gospel. We just ask you to be with our sister April today, Father. Just lead her, guide her, Father. Lord, just let her make a difference in the lives of those people. Many of them do not know you, but Father, the word is going to every corner of the earth, every nation, every kindred, every tongue. And Father, how you choose to carry it is up to you, Lord. And we would just ask you, Father, just to be, Lord, our sister Dorcas needing healing in her body. Lord, we just ask you to come down, Father. Lord, you blessed her to come through this surgery, Father. But Lord, we're asking for a healing, Father. And Lord, even at this moment, everyone that needs a healing here today, may they just raise a hand, raise a heart, and say, "Lord, you're passing through this building today, Lord. Touch me today, Father. Lord, I need a healing also, Father. Just move upon us. I ask, Lord, we just thank you, Lord. all the saints, Father, in this part of the world, Lord, those that are in the service today, those that are not, we ask you to touch them, Father. Lord, we thank you for your grace. We ask you to just bless us, Father, as we come with great expectation. Let your word just come and bless us, Lord. May we lift our voices in praise. May the worshippers arise today and Lord just lift their voices in praise to you, Lord. You're greater than our circumstance. You're greater than our needs, Lord. Father, what we need is more of you, Father. How we need you today. Come and move in our midst. I ask this in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And you may be seated. We'll sing one more song and then we'll have Sister Melody sing a special for us. Um number 425, please. [Music] All ye saints of light proclaim Jesus the light of the world. Life and mercy in his name. Jesus the light of the world. Oh, we'll walk in the light. Beautiful light. Come where the dew drops of mercy are bright. Shine all around us by day and by night.

Come where the dew drops of mercy are bright. Shine all around us by day and by night. Jesus the light of the world. Amen. Sister Melody. [Music] Um, is this is it? I just wanted to say before I sing this that in 2017 I walked away from God and for 8 years I felt so alone. But once God got a hold of my life, I looked back and I saw him in every difficulty that I faced. He never left me. Even though I walked away, [Music] time after time I was searching. for peace in some void. [Music] I was trying to blame all my ills on this world I was in. [Music] Surface relationships used me till I was done in. But all the while someone was waiting to free me from sin. He was there all the time. He was there all the time, waiting patiently [Music] in line. He was there all the time. [Music] Never again will I look for that vague rainbow end. Now that I found the answers, my life is starting to rhyme. [Music] Sharing each new day with him is a breath of fresh life. [Music] Oh, what I've missed. He was waiting right there all the time. He was there all the time. He was there all the time. waiting patiently in line. He was there all the time. [Music] He was there all the time. He was there all the time, waiting patiently [Music] in line. [Music] He was there all the time. All he wants is you. No one else will do. Not just a part. He wants all of your heart. All he wants is all of you. All he wants is you. [Music] All he wants is me. [Music] unreervedly. [Music] Not just a part. He wants all of my heart. All he wants is all of me. All he wants is me. [Music] All he wants is me. [Music] Amen. Thank you for that song. It's beautiful. As we invite brother David to come, let's sing number 114. [Music] Create in me a clean heart. Oh God, [Music] and renew a right spirit within me. Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence, oh Lord, and take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and renew a right spirit within me. Create in me. Oh, create in me a clean heart, oh God, [Music] and renew a right spirit within me. Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence, oh Lord, and take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation. [Music] &gt;&gt; And you might say, "Brother David, you're sure coming up there with ammunition." Yeah, I am a sword, not an ammunition. I just little out of my comfort zone this morning. You know, God takes us out of our comfort zones. He knows how to do that. And I'm just thankful though. He always makes a way. You know, I appreciated that song, Sister Melody. God bless you for that. And now the question is will you surrender? [Music] Have you fully surrendered? Prophet said you know there's not one thing we need to do. Grace has provided it all. We just need to believe. And then he turned and said there is something you can do. He said that's completely let go and give God your whole self and your being. You have a choice. You can serve yourself or you can turn yourself completely to God and die to self. We do that every single day. We die to self and let him rule. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I pray that God will just speak to every individual, bring light on your need. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And walk in the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together as we pray. So, my computer wouldn't print what I had prepared. So it's a little out of norm. So I if I can't print it, I'll bring the computer then. So I just believe that God knows exactly. There's a purpose. There's a reason for everything. We don't have to know. We don't have to figure it out. God knows. You believe that? &gt;&gt; You're not here by chance. &gt;&gt; You're here by divine direction. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are led to be here. God knew where you'd be. God knew I would have to do this. So, he's got a purpose in all of it. Let's pray. Our precious heavenly father, as you prayed through our pastor this morning, God, we're just giving the whole service to you. We're asking you to move move through your word. That's the channel you move in, Lord. May you move through the word of promise for this hour. For Lord, this is our message. This is our ministry. Lord, is the message of the season, the message of the hour. And Lord God, it's hid from many, but your elect knows it because you said, "My sheep know my voice, and a stranger they'll not follow." Because they cannot follow the voice of a stranger. So Lord Jesus, minister to everyone individually according to your divine and eternal purpose. Take me, Lord. I'm just submitting all things and my whole being to you Lord. Let the people not see the instrument you use but hear the voice of that instrument which Lord you can only play. And now father I just commit it all to you. Every word, every thought, every action and we call upon you for divine revelation that Lord we will leave here raised to a higher plane in Christ. our identification in Jesus Christ's name we pray and we say thank you Lord because we know and believe that we receive what we ask for and we shall see it manifest. &gt;&gt; We give you thanks. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd like you to turn with me in your Bibles to Psalm 27. Some scriptures here to read. Just want to follow the leading of the Lord now as we go. I'll begin with the first verse. The Lord is my can even say my &gt;&gt; my &gt;&gt; light &gt;&gt; and my salvation. &gt;&gt; Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life. &gt;&gt; Of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh. See, that's all they had to eat. They can't What's the serpent's meat? &gt;&gt; Flesh. &gt;&gt; Okay. They stumbled and fell. Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. What we just read right here. One thing have I desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple. &gt;&gt; Where is his temple? &gt;&gt; Right here. &gt;&gt; That's exactly. So where is he? &gt;&gt; So what do you have to fear if he's in you? &gt;&gt; No. Nothing. You're going to believe what you fear. There is a divine respect to God that you've that fear is in him &gt;&gt; to him &gt;&gt; because you reverence him. You know his word will be kept. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a love relationship. &gt;&gt; But you're going to the devil wants to bring you anxiety. He wants to point you to your flesh. He wants to point you to situation just like he's tried his best to point me at this. But he's a failure. He can't overcome the perfect will of God that's working in you. How many believe it's working in you? &gt;&gt; Amen. There you go. All right. So, call him a bluff. You don't have to fear him. &gt;&gt; In order to fear him, you've got to believe him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's go continue now. Verse five. We know verse four again. One thing I have desired of the Lord, I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. And behold the beauty of the Lord. So where's his beauty? It's in his temple. And to inquire. Inquire what? Inquire of him. Amen. In his temple. For it is for it for in the time of trouble. I may say amen. We're in the time of trouble. &gt;&gt; All right. For in the time of trouble, he shall hide me. How about you? I wonder if you can see yourself written here, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He shall hide me in his pavilion. &gt;&gt; Amen. Pavilion is a is a covering. It's a It's a refuge. It's a place. The name of the Lord is a mighty tower, a pavilion, a safe place. And he'll hide me in the secret of his pavilion. In no, excuse me, in his pavilion, in the secret of his tabernacle, &gt;&gt; shall he hide me. Then there's a tab, there's a secret in this tabernacle, this tabernacle, that tabernacle &gt;&gt; that God could not and would not open until the seals were opened in this hour. Then it would fully be seen. And that what is that third pull? The opening of the word. &gt;&gt; So what's the secret? The prophet said, "Here's the secret. The word is in the bride." &gt;&gt; All right. So he said, "In the time of trouble, he shall hide me in his pavilion. In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall set me upon a revelation." &gt;&gt; Rock is revelation. &gt;&gt; Psalm 62, we'll read in just a minute. &gt;&gt; That speaks of your revelation. Verse six, "And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me. Therefore will I offer in his tabernacle. Where? In his tabernacle. Amen. Where where is the place of worship? In his tabernacle. &gt;&gt; There's only one place to worship him. &gt;&gt; In his tabernacle. You cannot truly worship the Lord Jesus unless you're in his tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's where he placed his name. That's where his name is. &gt;&gt; So where is it? It's in the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. Now, so and now my head shall be lifted up above mine enemies round about me. It therefore I will offer up in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy. Sacrifice. It's a joy to give sac. It's a sacrifice. I mean to say thank you Lord no matter what situation I'm in. &gt;&gt; I will sing. Yay. I will offer praise unto the Lord. You may be seated. I'd like you to turn with me &gt;&gt; now to to Psalms 40. I just have you right seated there on that one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalm 40 verse1 I verse one through two and then I'll take verse seven. I waited. Boy, that's a that's a that's a that's that's a strength. I waited &gt;&gt; patiently &gt;&gt; for the Lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cry. That's the problem. We need patience, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "He brought me up also out of a horrible pit and out of the miry clay." Look at what he did. He brought me up also out of the horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. There's the rock again. And he's established your goings. &gt;&gt; And heath put a new s. Okay, I want to move down here to seven. Then said I, lo, I come in the volume of the book. Lo, I come &gt;&gt; in the volume of the book. It is written of me. You say, "Well, yes, it's written of him, but what about you?" &gt;&gt; Right there it is. &gt;&gt; The Bible said that you're that that you were the word in this book. &gt;&gt; And it was a hidden word until the seventh angel's message. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Until he he came with his message, that was a hidden word. But the Bible said we'll find where it's written. And I want to read that to you. If you'll go to 2 Corinthians 3 and let's go over there. I'm placing these scriptures out because I want to give a foundation. 2 Corinthians chapter or 2 Corinthians 3 and verse three. Now Paul's saying, "You are our epistle, our written word written in our hearts." You are the bride is the written epistle. Paul said, "You are the written epistle read in and written in my heart." &gt;&gt; What about us being the epistle written in our prophet's heart? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "You are our epistle." And that epistle written in his heart was the perfect interpretation of the word. Scriptures written for this season. &gt;&gt; Amen. For this hour. How many believe that? By divine vindication. So we're not looking at something in part. We're looking at a perfect perfect interpretation to take us home. &gt;&gt; And but that's got to be a spiritual application to you. You say, "Well, you can have the revelation." Everybody says, "Well, praise God we have the revelation." But there's a supernatural element still involved in that. And that's that word quickened to you personally. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's got to be revealed to you. Without the revelation, you're not even saved. You cannot make rapture without Christ revealed in you. &gt;&gt; And Christ is the word. &gt;&gt; All right. So, so he said now and he goes down to verse three. For so much as you are manifestly declared, you are the manifestation of what? The epistle, the written word written in my heart. He said the epistle of Christ ministered by us or the epistle written here as it was brought out and we brought out before that in meetings that this is Reema but the logos is the thought behind this. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what is being revealed to the bride? We believe that we take this this is God in written form. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that &gt;&gt; this is God in written form this Bible? But there's a thought behind that word. Everybody has the word and can quote the word, but they don't have the revelation contained in that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So now he said, "Now for so much as you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the spirit of the living God, not on tables of stone, but on fleshly tables of the or your &gt;&gt; heart." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So now we finding where this message is written. &gt;&gt; All right. Now we go over here to 2 Corinthians. Stay in that chapter. Go over here now to verse to verse 17. Now the Lord is that spirit. And where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. Because when the message comes out, it speaks to your heart. It's speaking to hearts. They that have the word in them for the hour, the season, elected, predestinated seed for this season, that word, that spirit has to go and and combine or connect with that seed. &gt;&gt; And it brings that word to life in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brings it to manifestation. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word for the season. You're the very manifestation of that epistle written. &gt;&gt; All right. So now then we Oh, excuse me. Amen. Now, nevertheless, the veil's been taken away. The Lord is that spirit. And where the spirit of the Lord is, there is bondage. &gt;&gt; Oh, did I read something wrong? Where the spirit of the Lord is, brother Paul, there's liberty. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There's liberty, brother, sister, there's liberty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You now hold liberty. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, I didn't give you my I kind of coming off of 31st here. I didn't give you my title then. Let me just say this. It's kind of a part two. Anyway, our title last, if you haven't looked, the 31st was our glory, our revelation. &gt;&gt; Today it's rapture revelation. &gt;&gt; And and and so I'm a subject is raptured faith. I am. Now, this may choke some people. Just you stay with me in the message. I am. I don't say I am. I'm talking about personal, but put it to you. I am the rapture. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; What is happening? There's a going in and a coming in his bride. There is a secret catching away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't want to make it so secret that but well, I will make it so secret. There it's so secret that only the bride can have it. &gt;&gt; That's that's what it is. All right. So, now let's go back over here to verse 17. Now the Lord. Now verse 18, excuse me. But we all with open face. Open means unveiled. &gt;&gt; So whose face is unveiled? &gt;&gt; It goes on to say who it is. Beholding is in a glass which is the promise. The word beholding is in a glass. The glory. The glory. &gt;&gt; Well, brother David, he won't share his glory with another. He will. He will not. That's correct. But he will share it with himself. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. And you're not another. So you are his glory. We could take that a lot of places. &gt;&gt; Amen. We could go to the 17th chapter of John and said, "Lord, give them I give them my glory." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Okay. So he said now, so we're looking at this 18th verse again. But we all with open Who's we all? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I trust you're one of the we all &gt;&gt; open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed. &gt;&gt; I task you what is rapture? &gt;&gt; Rapture is a change. &gt;&gt; Rapture means caught up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope you understand before the end of this service what that is and and what it pertains to and that it's not all something all out in the future. &gt;&gt; Right. There is a part of that still in the future. &gt;&gt; But what takes us there is what I'm speaking of today. &gt;&gt; All right. So, so you realize then that we have see as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from what? Glory to glory. In another scripture it said from faith to faith. &gt;&gt; From revelation to revelation we are being changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many's growing? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. The path of the justice as a shining light that shineth unto that perfect day. Is that right? There is a proceeding forth. There is a going. The prophet saw them marching. Where were they going? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He saw him go the first time out and back again restored. The same bride. He said coming right back here. Not the same people, the same bride. &gt;&gt; What she is, who she is. bride coming marching here in step with the word. Amen. And she didn't go down. She she walked and as she walked, she went up. &gt;&gt; Something was happening in their march. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Something was taking place. &gt;&gt; They were on the move. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. And the prophet said, "This thus sayeth the Lord, the move is on for the bride." &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "The move is on." So what about where are we moving? &gt;&gt; We're leaving here. &gt;&gt; We are now leaving here. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Brother David, I don't see you leaving." It's got to come to that, like Brother David said Wednesday, it's got to come to that moment. &gt;&gt; That we'll leave here. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly. And who's looking for the moment? I'm looking for the moment because that's the moment we're we're we're growing into, moving into, walking into. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Who are you walking with? You're walking with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not God off here somewhere. God in you. &gt;&gt; You're walking with God. &gt;&gt; And in him carries everything you have need of. &gt;&gt; And he's in you. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. All right. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself here. All right. Now, so it's from faith to faith, from glory to glory. He is not he will. He is changing me. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I got it. &gt;&gt; Yep. We do. All right. Now, Romans 8 or Romans 62, I'm sorry. Romans 62 or exc Romans Ma or Psalm 62, excuse me. Psalm 62 and verse six. I'm I say I'm laying this out that I've got some things I'd like to share with you on what the prophet said. Brother, sister, I have only one way to preach it. Paul has a way to preach it. God has ordained these things in the way we must preach the word. You say, "I don't like the way he preaches. I don't like. No, you just need to get your mind off of that and hear and hear what God's trying to say and then judge it not by what you see and how you feel about the matter, but by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So Psalm 62:6, he only is my revelation. &gt;&gt; When the prophet preached the message shalom, he took this scripture and he said rock in in the Bible means revelation. So he said David is saying God is my revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so run as a revelation unveiling. And so you so you so the third pull is the unveiling of something. Amen. &gt;&gt; The third pull is the unveiling of the word. &gt;&gt; And it's not written with an iron pen. It's not written in a in stone. It's written in your heart. &gt;&gt; Right? So, you're holding a mystery. &gt;&gt; It's no longer a mystery now to you. It's it's a reality. &gt;&gt; A secret &gt;&gt; revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was a hidden mystery. Now it's a re Now the mysteryy's been opened. How many know that's true? The seven seals open. The mystery is opened. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now he says right here he said God is he only is my rock my salvation. He is my defense. I shall not be moved. &gt;&gt; I shall not be. How many's going to camp on that and say that I believe that with all my heart. I shall not be moved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's not enough pressure. There's not enough confederation of churches. There's not enough denominational spirit around the message to move it. &gt;&gt; I didn't say it was in the message &gt;&gt; around it. &gt;&gt; It's God. Satan isn't going to wait out there. He's coming down here so close it would deceive the elect if possible because both the elect and non-elect can be anointed and anointed by the same spirit. &gt;&gt; But one is the word and the other cannot be the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So the so the the evidence is not your emotion. The evidence is not your gift and we believe in it. Evidence is not signs and wonders. Though we believe in it and we believe it happens and we're looking for God to move by his word today. We we want that to happen. But the revelation of the word for the season is the evidence the Holy Ghost is in you dwelling. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he's opened up that word in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in the beginning was the logos. The logos was with the with God. And the logos was God. &gt;&gt; And you is with God. How was it with God? Because the logos is a thought. It's a concept. And it was in God working. It was alive. It was living. &gt;&gt; It was substance. And he spoke what was substance into word. &gt;&gt; And you have to be here in your hour because you're that spoken word bride for the season. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; There is the word. That's why the word is our absolute. That's why the word is our absolute. It's our abs. It's our It's our amen. It's the final say &gt;&gt; over every feeling, over every sensation, no matter what anyone else says or thinks. &gt;&gt; That word is our absolute. &gt;&gt; And so he said, "God is my rock. I shall not be moved. Trust in him." Oh, excuse me. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. Yeah. No, verse seven. In God is my salvation. In God is my salvation. My glory, the rock of my strength, and my refuge is in God. And I'm safe to say in God is my rapture. &gt;&gt; Because everything I ever could be or ever would be is in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. There you are. So, so now we go here to Romans 8. And that'll be the last of the scriptures for just a moment here. Romans chapter 8. Very familiar scriptures. I'm glad the scriptur is familiar. But oh, I'm so happy when he opens it up. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're growing. See, you got to recogn I want you to forget you're growing. &gt;&gt; There was a planting time and now there's a growing time. &gt;&gt; There's a former rain and there's a latter rain. &gt;&gt; And the latter rain is a harvest rain. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what has been planted has now got to grow up and mature and grow into something. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we grow up, the Bible said, into the head, &gt;&gt; even Christ. Amen. All right. Now, so we we we we go in here. I should have made this this pause a little bit longer. All right. Now, all right. Romans 8:29. If I'm too loud, you forgive me. I'm kind of a loud preacher. Romans 8:29. And the Bible says, "For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate." We'll come to this in just a moment. In a little quote, the prophet says, "Here's the evidence. Moreover, whom he did for predestinate for excuse me for know he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. &gt;&gt; Where were those brethren? When he was born &gt;&gt; when he that firstborn where were the brethren where were the brethren when he went to Calvary where was his brethren when he rose &gt;&gt; in him. Amen. You were always in him. &gt;&gt; You just wrote said it in your song. &gt;&gt; He was always here. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. You just couldn't realize who was here. &gt;&gt; Satan couldn't come in and take you out of being here. He had to He couldn't touch you because God had predestinated you to be where you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. And to receive him in due time. &gt;&gt; Come to realization. It's not your doing. It's not our doing. It's nobody's doing. It's his doing. &gt;&gt; It's his achievement. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So now verse 30. Moreover, whom he did predestinate them, he also called. And whom he called, them he also justified, declared righteous. &gt;&gt; As though you never did it in the first place. He justified. And those that he justified them he also has. &gt;&gt; Say it. &gt;&gt; What? Why, brother David, &gt;&gt; you're telling me right now you're glorified? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He hath already done it. &gt;&gt; But I've got to step into it. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; My body isn't glorified yet, &gt;&gt; but that inside of me, the real me is a glor is glorified and already in his glory and walking to a glorified body. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. All right. Now, &gt;&gt; all right. So, whom he justified, them he also glorified Jesus Christ. Brother Brham, here's what he said. What is the new birth then, brother Brandham? He said, "Christ in you would make you the complete revelation of the whole thing." &gt;&gt; Just the quote above that. Then he said, "What is the new birth, brother Brandham?" You may ask me. He said, "The new birth is Jesus Christ revealed in you personally." &gt;&gt; Amen. Not another person. Different body, different flesh, but same person. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, so Jesus Christ, this is a quote that he said also. Jesus Christ the new birth revealed in you. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the new birth. You say, "I'm born again, Brother David. Then who are you?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus Christ the new birth. You say, "I got to be born again." Well, that is a new birth then. He had to come. Word had to come to word. He had to come to himself. He had to bring life to himself. He had to bring life to that word because in him was a mystery. And that mystery was the same mystery that was in Adam now in Eve form. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; All right. Now, now, so the mystery of Adam was Eve. &gt;&gt; It wasn't even Eve then. It was Mrs. Adam. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? &gt;&gt; She took on the name Eve because she was the mother of all living. But Adam was not the father of all living. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So she bore two seeds. &gt;&gt; Amen. She did. &gt;&gt; Then her name was Eve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It couldn't be Mr. Adam at that time because Mr. Adam wouldn't have couldn't have bore that child. Couldn't have given life to her womb for a serpent &gt;&gt; seed. &gt;&gt; The only seed he could give was God's own seed. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I'll leave it right there. I'm not preaching serpent seed this morning, but it sure tied in right then. All right. Now, now that's why the full birth is not just repentance. &gt;&gt; It's repent and be baptized &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ, which is the the which is father, son, and holy ghost. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The name of father, son, and holy ghost. The name of that is one God. That's Jesus Christ the Lord. So in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you you standing there as a personal witness, as a testimony. I believe what he did for me at Calvary. I believe the blood was shed for me and I'm willing to take his name and die with him in representation of that before the people &gt;&gt; as a witness. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Then he said, "You do that, you'll raise you raised back up again as Christ raised from the dead, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, which is eternal life in you. &gt;&gt; The gift of God is a free gift." &gt;&gt; But it's only given to a certain class of people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Those that will believe, those that have the rea revelation of what happened on Calvary, you're taking his word. You believe what he said. You're showing it to the people. You're being baptized in his name. I don't know why I'm bringing this in, but I'm going to inject this in anyway. He said, "And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, which is eternal life, which is himself living in you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You shall receive the true baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Which there's no other way to get into the body of Christ except you're born again. And to be born again is be filled with the spirit. Is that right? So by one spirit are we all baptized or birthed into one body &gt;&gt; and that one body is none other than Jesus Christ our savior and salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. We were in him a part of him. &gt;&gt; All right. This all had to be restored to the bride in this hour. All right. Now so we come back here now. So so Jesus Christ the new birth revealed in you. Christ revealed in you personally. You drink and eat the revealed word of the hour. Other words, you're drinking and eating of the message. And by doing so, you're growing up into him, &gt;&gt; the rapture. &gt;&gt; You're growing into him, the rapture. &gt;&gt; There's no other place of rapture but in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. We could go to a scripture right now, but I'm going to wait and come to it later. on the message the token your life is gone and you are dead and your life is dead. You are hid in God through Christ sealed in there by the Holy Spirit. The Bible said the Holy Spirit is the seal &gt;&gt; to the day of your redemption. &gt;&gt; Once sealed, Satan cannot come in and break that revealed word inside your soul. He cannot break that seal. &gt;&gt; You're sealed in and Satan's sealed out. &gt;&gt; What about my errors and mistakes? The blood has already taken care of that. Your your confidence lays in the shed blood. &gt;&gt; You're behind the blood. You're you've gone in beyond the blood. &gt;&gt; You went on to the inside of the inside, the little room of your soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just not an anointing on your spirit out here, &gt;&gt; which can happen, but unless that word's inside of you, you'll never see. You'll never realize that Christ is the Lord. You can't call him Lord without having without the having the new birth &gt;&gt; because he can't be Lord until his new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you following me? You go back to Corinthians there and find that out. But just to pass it on now. So the mind that was in Christ is in you. 2 Corinthians or 1 Corinthians 2:16. Let the mind that was in Christ, the Bible said Philippians be in you. Amen. And the mind that was in Christ is in you. Because now you've moved from a natural carnal right &gt;&gt; thought back to a revelation of who you are. &gt;&gt; The only thing could open that up was Christ opening the word to you personally &gt;&gt; himself to you personally. &gt;&gt; Then you have the mind of Christ and Christ and the Bible and the word is the same. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God. Then you now listen. Then you and the word and God and Christ are the same. &gt;&gt; If he abide in me and my word in you. &gt;&gt; If he abide in me, when were you abiding in him, when were you a believer? He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. When were you a believer? &gt;&gt; Always. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world, you always were a believer. &gt;&gt; You can't become just a believer. You always were. But now it's revealed that you are. Because the the believer is the revelation or the faith of God moving in you. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 84 or 86 of perfect faith. The believer is any believers in here? The believer is the faith, the revelation of God himself. So we're not living by our own thinking. We're living by God's own faith, &gt;&gt; which that faith was substance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when it's revealed in you, it's not just a thought or not a hope. It's substance. All right. So he said, "Then you and the word and God and Christ are the same. If you abide in me and my word in you, ask what you will, &gt;&gt; it'll be done." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who's leading that? Who's directing that? Jesus said, "I can do nothing until my father reveals that to me." &gt;&gt; And he said, "That same harmony will exist between his bride and the groom." And Jesus said,"I only do what the father tells me to do, shows me to do, and the bride can do nothing else but do what he said do." &gt;&gt; It's so it's not your figuring it out. It's it's not it's it's it's it's the faith. Hold fast the faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hold fast the confession of your faith. &gt;&gt; See, confession is a confession of faith. You think God's going to honor that? Certainly because your confession is God's faith &gt;&gt; in you, the revelation in you, God leading you. You're doing things at his ordering, his leadership. So rest. Let go, little bride. &gt;&gt; The move is on. All right. Now, getting on here. &gt;&gt; I don't want to get too sidetracked on these things. Time. when you are planted into his death, burial, and re and resurrection planted in Christ and receive the Holy Spirit life in you. Everything that you got that you that you've got need of all through the journey, you're in a journey. &gt;&gt; All I've been on the journey quite a while and I I'm not making point of I'm not meaning that means anything. It's like brother Paul said, I think it was last night. It don't matter how long you've been, you know, at a late hour like this, things that seed will mature a lot quicker than somebody come in a lot earlier. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; But they mature. Still they mature. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so, you know, so you've been on a journey a long time, but the word is becoming clearer. And what is happening? What's happening? The word is becoming personal. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's no longer me and and Lord out here. Where are you someplace else? No, it's in me. And the one that's in me, in my soul, is who I am. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. Brother Brandham said it like this. The real you is the spirit of God in you. &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; Things that are to be. All right. Now, now, hallelujah. He said, "And when you planted, you're planted into his death, burial, and resed in Christ, receive the Holy Spirit life in you. Everything that you've got need of all the way through the journey is in you right then. So where is everything you need? &gt;&gt; It's in you. &gt;&gt; Christ in you is everything you need. &gt;&gt; Let him open it as he wills to you. You don't have to study it and figure it out and be and fret about it. Let him open it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Quit trying to figure it out. That that relieved me many years ago when I was a young man. I I got so burdened down. Why can't I understand? Why can't I? And the and I found out where prophet said, "Don't even try to understand it." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Just let God reveal it as he will in his season &gt;&gt; and his time. &gt;&gt; Amen. What did we just read here? Wait on the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to figure anything out. If Christ is in you, the Bible said when the spirit of truth comes in, he will lead you into where? All truth. &gt;&gt; There you are. So there's a there's there's got you've got to come the way the doctor prescribed it. Repent, be baptized, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Until you receive that Holy Ghost, that's the new birth. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a many a Christian, many a good person, many saved people that won't be in the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they they they baptized the old Well, Lord, we baptized, right? But they stopped, &gt;&gt; right? They didn't go on. &gt;&gt; Probably because it wasn't in them to go on. &gt;&gt; Now, there's going to be a group of people that isn't in them to go on. They're good people. &gt;&gt; They're called the tribulation saints. &gt;&gt; They're sanctified people. &gt;&gt; They are the same cloth the bride is made out of. Only the bride portion &gt;&gt; is bride portion. &gt;&gt; The other is a remnant of it. Right? &gt;&gt; They can't be in the bride. Therefore, they miss the rapture because they don't have the Holy Ghost in them. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just have to drop that in. If you have a question, ask your pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. All right. Amen. Okay. Now, so then then you and the word are the same. And then all right. Now, hallelujah. He says when you become the seed everything you need of is right in you then be for you become the seed is see it God in his word &gt;&gt; God in his word &gt;&gt; what's being opened you are being opened &gt;&gt; you are the word to be opened &gt;&gt; God in his word hallelujah the Holy Ghost baptism yes sir and everything you have need of for life's journey even the rapture is in you right then. &gt;&gt; Let me read that again. This is what we're coming to. The Holy Ghost baptism. Yes, sir. Everything you need for life's journey. Even the rapture is right in you. Then &gt;&gt; from a little infant word, infant bride. Remember, brother Bram said five stars lined up. What was the astronomic heaven announcing? An infant bride coming forth. &gt;&gt; She'd been planted. She's be to come out, become forth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that was under that latter former rain, teaching rain, planting. Brother Brandham called it seed in the in in the uh uh spoken word, ris seed. He said that was the planting time. Remember, and I want you those that know the message, remember prophet said that this messenger of Revelations 10 and Malachi 4 does two things. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said that the former and latter rain would rain fall in the first month. So, he had to do two things. That's right. &gt;&gt; There was a planting rain and there's a got to be a a ladder rain or a harvest rain &gt;&gt; to grow up what's been planted &gt;&gt; into maturity. And that had to happen under the opening of those seven seals &gt;&gt; because without that there been no move of God. Brother Bram said to move that bride until the opening of those seals. And he said till the revelation of those seven thunders would come forth that John couldn't write. He said it's not something outside the word. He said what he couldn't write is in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not outside the word. You can't add to or take from it. It's in the word. &gt;&gt; But it's a mystery. It's a secret. What's it held up for? To bring the bride into her full position. &gt;&gt; The full revelation. &gt;&gt; Who is the full revelation? The prophet's message. Revelation 10:7 said in the days, Amen. In the days of his ministry, the mystery of God would be finished. Finished means completed, sealed, done, &gt;&gt; completed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have enough to make rapture under this message. And the message was sent to us for the going home of the bride. So, let me read it again here. Remember Amen. Now, the rapture is in us now. Don't resent that. He said it's raptures right in you then when you're born of the spirit. Don't resent that. That's the truth. The rapture is in us now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will prove it by the gospel. Those he has called, he justified. And those he had justified, he hath glorified. Then your glorification is in you now. &gt;&gt; Your change. &gt;&gt; All right. Now I will prove it. Those who he called, he justified. Those that he justified, he hath glorified. Hallelujah. Then in heaven today, we're a glor. We are glorified in the presence of God right now. &gt;&gt; Now you think he can change his mind about you, he can't change his mind about you. &gt;&gt; Amen. What kind of God would we serve if he could change his mind about who you are and what you are? &gt;&gt; It's not up to you to produce that. &gt;&gt; It's up to you to follow what he said and he'll take care of the rest of it. &gt;&gt; It's up to you to give yourself daily, die, take up your cross and follow him. He'll take care of the rest of it. &gt;&gt; The word is either your absolute, the amen, the final say, or it isn't. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. You're sitting right here this morning under that right now. &gt;&gt; Either is or it isn't. &gt;&gt; Got it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So, so it's in you right now. Those who he called, he just Okay, now I'm pushing. He said, "What's happening? You're glorified in his presence." Hallelujah. In heaven today, we're a glorified in the presence of God right now. I'm just pushing out to it. Amen. Glory. God's in his word, &gt;&gt; in his tabernacle, in the secret of the tabernacle, in his house. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said you are the house. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. You are his name. You are his presence. You are himself. &gt;&gt; You see what the devil wants to keep you bound with? Your reasoning, your feelings, your senses. Don't you add to the word or take. It's flawless. The word is flawless. It's it's perfect. You can't add to or take from it. All they said you accept it, water it, believe it, keep giving God praise for it, and don't you move off of that. &gt;&gt; And God will take care of it in its season. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so he said God's in his word. You believe it? All right. Growing into the full stature of Christ for me to live. Going back to scripture, for me to live is Christ. Philippians. &gt;&gt; For me to live is what? &gt;&gt; Christ. I My desire whether in life or death. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; My desire is that he be magnified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Enlarged in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The works that I do shall you do also. Only greater works than this shall you do. &gt;&gt; Amen. What was the works to be done? Believe on him whom God has sent. the works will follow. &gt;&gt; Amen. What's the Bible say? We are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus. Brother Brandham said when he said created in Christ Jesus, he said created in union with Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; unto good works which he hath already before ordained that you should walk in them. &gt;&gt; So what do you got to do? Take him at his word. &gt;&gt; Quit reasoning with yourself. Quit reasoning with the enemy. Eve reasoned with the devil. &gt;&gt; He broke the hole through the word, didn't he? &gt;&gt; If she'd have stayed behind the word, &gt;&gt; there hadn't been no fall. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so it's not by several words, by one word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, the opening of Now, what is this? All right. Growing into the full stature for me to live as Christ. The opening of the seven, the the opening of the seals, which is the seventh seal. Revelation, the message of his going or coming going home of the bride. What is the seventh seal revelation? What are the seven thunder saying? What are they hiding? Whatever they're hiding is now open and it's opening to the bride. &gt;&gt; That's why some say, "Well, the seventh seal isn't open." And some say, "Oh, yes, it is open." &gt;&gt; One can say that, both can say that by an intellectual conception. But you let that bride say that one time and it'll fulfill through her because God is now working in and through his bride. And that is the revelation of himself. The full revelation of himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, so, so the re the seventh seal revelation, the opening of the seals is the message of the seventh angel. The message of his coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are what now happening? going home. The bride is marching. She's going home. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The move is on. Where are we going? &gt;&gt; To another organization, another denomination? No. We've come out of that darkness. We've resurrected out of that darkness. &gt;&gt; This is the bride coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; That part had to be made manifest. That part had to be known or there would be no rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Unless he took the book and laid claim on what he had redeemed, there would be no rapture. &gt;&gt; He had to lay claim on what he had already redeemed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the message. All right. So, the going home of the bride. So there, what John was then caught up in Revelations 4:1 to see things that would bring him into that body change. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it was. caught up &gt;&gt; amen. And what was he caught up? He saw the very thing he saw in Revelations 1. &gt;&gt; The headstone. &gt;&gt; Standing the very head himself standing in the midst of the bride clothed as a bride. &gt;&gt; Did you know that? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All right. So now now latter rain or harvest rain upon this his seed planted. Joel 2 23-26. I'm not asking you to turn unless you want to. That's write it down. Says now it says God is going to restore. Verse 25. That's what the word said in Joel 2:25. Now verse 23. Be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God. For he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain in the first month. So they come together. &gt;&gt; Prophet will do two things. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He had to have he had to bring us back. The doctrine, everything had to be restored back to his position. What for? He had to there had to be a planting. Brother Brandham said there were three seeds planted. I'll just drop this in. He said that um in 1965 he said one seed was planted by Billy Graham, the evangelical seed. The other seed was planted by old Roberts, which was a Pentecostal seed. And the next seed was himself &gt;&gt; to the bride. He never left them. He stayed with them and said, "I'll return in the time of life and Sarah shall have that son." &gt;&gt; He couldn't look at the unbelief that Sarah had because she was a part of Abraham. &gt;&gt; And neither can he look at our mistakes and failures because we are a part of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Who was what was Abraham? He was that royal seed. What was he depending on? What did he see revealed through him to him? the royal seed. &gt;&gt; What was this? That speaking to that royal seed. So God planted a seed. &gt;&gt; But he said, "I'll return again." Amen. And bring that royal seed and grow it up into who I am for what purpose? The rapture. &gt;&gt; The body change. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, &gt;&gt; so here we go. And he says that in in verse 23. Now God isn't going to plant a new church. God isn't going to plant in the former ray a new church. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; No. He's restoring what the canker were made and what the locust. He's planting the seed of the word. Malachi 4. He did what? Just exactly what he said he would do. &gt;&gt; All right. Then what's following that? There's got to be something coming to mature that seed. And that's a harvest rain. &gt;&gt; Amen. I could spend a lot of time on that. I'm going to drop that in because there there could be just a single message on this. You understand? All right. Now, now he will cause the rain, okay, to come in the same God isn't going to plant a new church, but is going to bring his original planting back to original seed. Now see where brother Brandham was when he preached the message. God's original seed. What did he have to do? He was at a he was at a hanging point. Where do I go from here? What's happening from here? He knew there had to be a change, but what is it? And God said, "Pick up your pen." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He said, "God, pick up your pen and start writing." And he wrote out what the revelation was that God wanted not only him to see, but us to see. And he answered the the question in his heart. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There has to be a harvest. There had to be a rain to bring it to maturity. &gt;&gt; Not only is there rain, it's the same sun. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so all right. So he says here he's going he's not planting he's planting his original back he planting back to the original seed. He is go he's doing it as stated in verse 23 by the teaching or former reign. That is before the seals opened. Now watch a bride started to grow up. What do we have to come under? &gt;&gt; The Pentecostal baptism. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; All right. There had to be a change. Just like Sarah and Abraham had to have a change &gt;&gt; in order to receive seed. They had to be changed, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They were changed. They came through it. Then they went down to Greer. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Then they came back and God visited Sarah as he said she would he would. And she conceived &gt;&gt; after the change. &gt;&gt; So you've got to come through your Pentecost. Amen. In order to conceive the real seed, you've got to come through Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Amen. You've got to have that open, that faith to receive seed. &gt;&gt; Now, when you receive seed, Brother Bram said in the seals, there's nothing to awaken the bride. But one year later, preaching recognizing your day in his message, he said, "What they haven't recognized is the bride been awakened." &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, though, then they're the corner turned. And many can't turn that corner. &gt;&gt; That's the problem. They're wanting to go back and hang on to the onto the message of Pentecost, which that message there will not bring you into a body change. That was a reformation. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the eagle message that the sight of God himself had to come forth and open up himself in order for you to come to yourself. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so we're seeing here now he said next he said watch before the seals before the revelation 10 message you remember what the prophet said Revelation 10 message is the opening of the seventh seal he said no place it is the seventh seal &gt;&gt; his message is the seventh seal &gt;&gt; all right &gt;&gt; because now we realize where our position is we have to be taken out of the way before he can come again to Israel &gt;&gt; it's the secret catching away. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He remember &gt;&gt; Jo Joseph bride was in the temple in the palace &gt;&gt; when he made himself known to the brethren. &gt;&gt; She was taken out of the way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There was a going there. There was a secret catching away. She went out of the way. Mob moved. And what's the message now for us? &gt;&gt; To see our position in Christ. &gt;&gt; To recognize what we are, who we are. &gt;&gt; All right. Right? And we're going to read that here in just a second. Not necessarily who you are, but what you are. That's I want to make that point right now. It's what you are. When she when she realizes what she is, &gt;&gt; all right. Something's going to happen. And we're very, very close. I believe with all my heart, a bride's coming to the reality of what she is. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And it's going to produce. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's got to produce. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, the new birth, he said, so the seals open and the seals opening was harvest or latter rain. And this is what brother Bram said. He said, we've had the former rain. He said, next will come the harvest rain or rapturing faith. I got to say that again. Don't you miss this statement. He said, "Next will come the harvest rain or rapturing faith." &gt;&gt; There's got to be something to bring this bride that faith in her to rapture. &gt;&gt; Before her body change, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so what's going to do it? Brother Ram said the third pull would do it. I can read and there's more to it than that, but I'll read it in a little bit here as we go on. Now, now in the message Christ, the mystery of God revealed, paragraph 240, the new birth is Christ's revelation, God has revealed to you this great mystery. And that's the new birth. So, what is Christ? The mystery of God revealed. And where is it? It's revealed in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the mystery of God is revealed. &gt;&gt; It's in you. And brother Ram called that that in you, Christ in you, God's great revelation. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. So you mean there would be a revelation? That's God's great revelation. Remember, he had in his mind what he had in mind, his heart purpose, his sole purpose, his heart purpose was have a bride of his own choosing. paragraph 163, page 163 if you have the Brown church age book. Amen. That's where he said it. &gt;&gt; And that's his choosing. &gt;&gt; Amen. You going to take out of God's hands what he chose? &gt;&gt; That choosing was in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, so God has revealed to you this great mystery, and that's a new birth. Now, you started at a birth, but you've got to grow, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The new birth is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You have the Holy Ghost in you right now, but you got to grow up into adoption. &gt;&gt; You've got to grow up into the headstone. You have to become in the form of the head himself because why? The son of man would be revealed in another form. And that's bride form in this hour. Now, you hold that point because that's exactly what the prophet said it would be and must be to fulfill back to Eden again. There had to be a masterpiece family. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, now we see here God has revealed it. Now, what are you going to do when you get all that group together? Not necessarily in one building, but together where? In Christ. What are you going to do when you get all that group, the predestinated group, not another one, not one more, that group, &gt;&gt; it's an individual affair, but it's still his body &gt;&gt; in the bride form himself. All right. What are you gonna do when you get that group all together and perfectly in harmony when and God perfect when the revelation is perfectly in harmony. Not one instrument off here off tune and this one playing his own jingle over here and this one over here. No, in tune in harmony. &gt;&gt; Same resonance, &gt;&gt; same sympathetic vibration &gt;&gt; hearing one voice. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You're under one voice. &gt;&gt; A many member bride, varied position, but one voice, &gt;&gt; one person, one head. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so what are you going to do now? Now, perfectly in harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions, the same things he did, the same things he did and the same things he did in other places. Brother Brham said he's doing now. the same things he did making the word manifest. Now, we just read it right here in 2 Corinthians 3. Making the word manifest through his word. So, see what were the what was the what was the second pull? What was the first second pull pointing to? of furthering, catching the attention of the bride to take them out of denominationalism to let them see their bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Let us be glad and rejoice for the bridegroom comes and the lex seed rose up. &gt;&gt; I got it. &gt;&gt; And the others come along and said, yawn, brother said, "Oh yeah, I guess I'm in this movement. I ought to have some of that Holy Ghost, too. They didn't get it. Prophet made it very clear. They went to buy it. But when they come back, the bride's already gone. &gt;&gt; A secret. They didn't know it. They didn't know. When they come back, they were gone. &gt;&gt; Where'd they go? Into union. &gt;&gt; To the inside of the inside. Into the little room. in in union with himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where's the message written? In your heart, in your soul. &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; okay. Now, so we go on here. All right. He said, now watch what he says. Oh, if the church only knew its position. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 240. or if the church only knew its position. Now, this is what struck me just about a week or so. Actually, be it struck me about two weeks ago and brother David preached on rapture. I'm not taking away anything. I'm just &gt;&gt; absolutely &gt;&gt; magnifying it a little more. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, now it's the ministry. You see, it's the ministry that does that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not the man. The ministry. Ministry of what? The word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and if they stop the ministry and close it up, guess what? The ministry is finished. &gt;&gt; Everyone's in their position. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because we were we were we were per ministering the word for what purpose? &gt;&gt; To bring the faith for rapture. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To get them in their position. Speaking only what the prophet said, not adding to that or taking from it. But through that channel, you take away that channel and what have you got? Death. &gt;&gt; You take away the channel that God ordained for this ministry of this prophet &gt;&gt; to come through. &gt;&gt; Not another voice. You take away that channel and all you've got is a dead a dead church, a dead building, a dead whatever movement. &gt;&gt; It won't produce anything. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, I trust you're hearing. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, &gt;&gt; All right. Now, oh, if the church only knew his position, it will one day. Now, Brother Bams. Oh, it will. See, it will. No, I believe we're in the day. &gt;&gt; The will one day is our day. &gt;&gt; All right. It will one day. Then the rapture. Watch what he said. Then the rapture will go. &gt;&gt; What an odd statement. not come. &gt;&gt; Go. &gt;&gt; The rapture will go. &gt;&gt; Not come. He didn't say not come. And we're going to come into the here where it comes because it does come. But then it's got to go. All right. So, not come. What the rapture will go when it knows who he's talking about? The bride. When it knows what it is. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes, it is too. It is the truth. He must have caught a thought. Well, that can't be truth, brother. Yeah, it is. It's the truth. The only way you know him is by revelation. &gt;&gt; Boy, that's a statement. The only way you know him, to know him is life. Not to know about him, not to not to quote quotes, not to do all this, but to know him is life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. That's what Satan will do everything he can. He doesn't want you to know him. &gt;&gt; And he does. By knowing him, you know what you are. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. To know him is to know him. Only way to know him is by revelation, not by flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? Paul never knew him by flesh. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Peter knew him by flesh, but pe that fled that that revelation didn't come by flesh. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? All right. Now, God can't change his way of doing things. Now, paragraph 578 of Christ the mystery. Now, we see the promise being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Whoa. Now, the prophet's coming right down here now taking what the seals are saying, what this is speaking. He's What is he preaching in this message? He's preaching the seventh seal, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He said, "Now we see the promise being not fully being." &gt;&gt; It's been revealed, but it's being revealed. Growing other words, growing somewhere growing, growing and going. Now, we see the promise being fulfilled. Christ the true headship. Is that your true headship? Then don't you look at yourself anymore and try to figure these things out and look to how you feel as any evidence of your salvation or what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, see, we see the promise being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How many see it? &gt;&gt; See to understand, see his revelation. Now, we're seeing the promise being fulfilled. Christ, the true headship going in. Woo! going in coming in his bride. &gt;&gt; So where's the message? &gt;&gt; Where's it moving? &gt;&gt; Christ is on the move. Going in. &gt;&gt; He's rapture. Christ is my rapture. &gt;&gt; Going in. And and me and Christ the same person going in. Coming in. &gt;&gt; His bride. &gt;&gt; The mystery of God would be finished. Where are we going next? &gt;&gt; To the third coming &gt;&gt; back in the millennium. &gt;&gt; There it is. He comes three times. You know that third coming is when he and his bride step back on earth in the millennium upon the ashes of the wicked. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? What is that? What's going to happen there? Back to Eden. &gt;&gt; Finish the finish and fulfill that seventh day. Amen. Right back. Right back again. God res has restored it completely. The ministry, the the the sewing, the the former rain, the latter rain is all one thing. It's a reviving. It's a restoring completely &gt;&gt; God himself. &gt;&gt; What the calmer worm ate, the cankerworm eating, what the cankerworm ate, the palmer, so on and so forth. &gt;&gt; Down to a root out down to a stump. But they couldn't get at the root. &gt;&gt; Neither can you. You are the root and offspring. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Of the king. Root and offspring of the king. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh my. All right. Now, now, so, so now we see it fulfilled. Christ the true headship going in, coming in his bride. What are we, what are we visiting here? What is the bride seeing? a secret catching away, not known to the public. This cannot be known to the public until she's gone. And he who letth will now let until he Christ the bride is taken out of the way. &gt;&gt; There you are. All right. Now doing he said now happening now bride now it's because why? It's bride time. It's seed time. doing the same works that he did at the beginning and making ready and fulfilling his word as he did at first in John 14:12. He that believeth in me, the works that I do shall he do also. Then the head and the body are becoming one in works and in sign and in life, vindicated by God himself through his promised word for the last days. How is it being vindicated? through his promised word for the last days. The prom he promised this in the last days. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, if you're spiritual, &gt;&gt; what's going to make you spiritual? Christ in you. &gt;&gt; It's not the man that's spiritual. &gt;&gt; It's the It's the mind of God in me and in you. &gt;&gt; That makes me spiritual. The Holy Ghost in you is the holy one. &gt;&gt; Is the spiritual one. &gt;&gt; All right. So, so he that is spiritual, he that there's only one that's spiritual. That's Jesus Christ. He's the one in you. &gt;&gt; So, he that is spiritual. I lost my place here. Just a minute. No. If you're spiritual, you'll catch it. &gt;&gt; Catch what? Rapture. &gt;&gt; Going in. He's going in. Then paragraph 579. Then we can see by that then we can see the marriage supper is at hand. &gt;&gt; Blessed is he who called to the marriage supper. &gt;&gt; Because why? We recognize heaven opened. &gt;&gt; Amen. And who do we see? Who's following him? Amen. All right. Now, now, &gt;&gt; but to the church, the bride, rapture, paragraph 65. Now, listen carefully, and I'm not too far off of closing. But to the church, the bride, the rapture is a revelation to her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For the rapture. &gt;&gt; The rapture is a revelation. What? Now watch what else he said to her. It's not it's it's re it's a revelation to her. It's revealed to her. &gt;&gt; Who else is going to get the revelation? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; See, it's revealed to her that the revelation, the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture. Remember &gt;&gt; what's coming to bring it. And then when does it go? &gt;&gt; So she has something that's going. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is she? The rapture. &gt;&gt; And what is that rapture in you? Substance. &gt;&gt; Not I hope I make it. &gt;&gt; You know you've made it because revelation is faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now it's a revelation. Now it is a revelation. And he said she'll be waiting. Now it is a revelation for the revelation is faith. &gt;&gt; You cannot have a revelation without it being faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the revelation is faith. And you cannot have a revelation without it being faith. &gt;&gt; Faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you. &gt;&gt; Not everybody. Not a group. You. &gt;&gt; Amen. you faith is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Now that's what faith is is the revelation of God. &gt;&gt; Now you see what revel what John was caught up to see. &gt;&gt; Okay. The rapture comes. What did he what did he see? One on the throne. Not two, not three. One on the throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. who was, which is, and shall come. &gt;&gt; What are we declaring? What are what is what is our ministry declaring? That which was, is, and shall come. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who is that? It's Jesus Christ, the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so we see here, &gt;&gt; I got it, &gt;&gt; the rapture goes comes, the rapture comes to go. &gt;&gt; I hope you caught that statement. The rapture comes to go. &gt;&gt; Now, he cleared this up in the message rapture. He said, "I've got to hurry because I think they want us to leave." And he just really pressed, but he brings it clearly out how it comes. &gt;&gt; Now, let's get this before we close here. He said, 'Now the rapture comes to go. The word rapture in the Bible is not even used at all. The word rapture. &gt;&gt; We just put the word there. The Bible says caught up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Caught up. Being caught up is rapture. &gt;&gt; All right. We Now there there's a spiritual and a physical rapture. &gt;&gt; Okay. You must have the spiritual revelation of the rapture before you can have a physical revelation of the rapture. That's God's way all the way through. &gt;&gt; When you have a revelation, you're healed. Nobody's going to move you off of that. You've already got a substance. When you have the revelation of the rapture, nobody's going to move you off of that. You've already You're already there. He has glorified. It's a revelation to you. It's substance. &gt;&gt; And it won't have to work it up, make it up, happen. It's going to happen. It's going to be pro. It's going to be manifested. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because you're in a higher plane, misunderstood, ridiculed, rat, but what's that got to do with it? &gt;&gt; Well, that hurt my feelings. Let go of your feelings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's not judging you by your feelings. Why are you letting somebody else judge it? &gt;&gt; Why are you judging yourself by your feelings? &gt;&gt; Take the word. What the word say for you to do? If you want a new birth, what did the word say for you to do? &gt;&gt; There's got to be justification, sanctification, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Go to first John five and read it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Three that bear witness in the earth and they bear witness of what? One thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. And there's and there and these three are one. So what are you going to do when it comes down and you haven't been haven't fulfilled or taken God at his word. You know there's only three things that God said he's required you to do outward in an outward thing be just in in physical things to be done. foot washing, communion, and water baptism. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Everyone else, everything else depends on your faith. &gt;&gt; And the victory, our victory is our faith. What is my faith? Jesus Christ the rapture. That's the faith. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, now, Brother Brandham makes this statement on God and simplicity Albuquerque. How do you know the rapture is not going on all the time? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, what we call rapture, what the earth calls rap, what the denominations call rapture isn't rapture at all. &gt;&gt; It's already happening and they don't know it. &gt;&gt; Got to come to a climax. If they miss what's happening, they won't see the climax. &gt;&gt; It's hidden. &gt;&gt; Tribulations dates did not know when that bride left. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; They couldn't get the message. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I'm not putting anybody in or anybody out. &gt;&gt; I'm placing &gt;&gt; those two. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, the scripture already placed them. I You say, "Well, I guess if that's me." No, I wouldn't say that. It shows you what's in your soul. I would say I'm going to be that bride. &gt;&gt; If I have to I'm if I've got to die, let me die, Lord. I don't care what it is. You work your work in me. I will be in that bride because that's that's written of me. I accept it. I believe it. That's your word you've given me. &gt;&gt; That settles it. &gt;&gt; Don't you let the devil point down that reasoning to you and say, "Well, I guess you know, &gt;&gt; you know, the battleground is your mind." &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, now let's go on here just a little bit further. So, we know the marriage supper is at hand. It's a revelation to her. The rapture. All right. Now, the word in the rapture not used at all. We just put the word in. The Bible said caught up. Being caught up. Read it here in 2 Thessalonians. Okay. Now, I'll read that in just a minute. How do you know the rapture is not going on all the time? Paragraph 303. First thing you know, it'll be passed one be it'll be passed one disappearing here and there. It'll be gone. You know what? Spiritually, we've already done disappeared. &gt;&gt; Do you realize that? &gt;&gt; Spiritually, not physically, you've already crossed over. &gt;&gt; You're already in rapture. You are that revelation that's revealed to you. &gt;&gt; If that revelation's too far from you, why don't you just instead of reasoning with it, why don't you just go back to what the word promised and say, "God, reveal it to me." &gt;&gt; You're that rapture and you've revealed yourself in me. Then Lord, open the word. Open that rapture to my heart. Let it become substance in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, here here and there, it'll be gone. The first thing you know, the first thing you know, it'll be gone. What? What he said? Excuse me. The whole secret, the whole whole thing is a secret catching away. &gt;&gt; Judgment will strike. Before you know it, he said judgment will strike the world. And you say, I thought this, it's too late now. Watch what he said. The foolish virgin didn't know until she come back and found the wise virgin gone. &gt;&gt; Then she was left for the tribulation. &gt;&gt; Now, we won't go into how she saved or was she saved in the in I could we could give an answer to that. If she is she saved at the white throne judgment. You realize the bride's not standing. &gt;&gt; She's judging. &gt;&gt; She's not standing before the throne being judged. Her judgment is now the opening of this book judges you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's your judgment right there. It's either written of you or it isn't. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if and when it's written of you, how can the judge say nothing else but case dismissed? &gt;&gt; This name cannot be taken from that book because they're my property. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; I've already declared them righteous. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now don't miss this. He says, "Now 1 Thessalonians 4:16, now watch the answer how it comes. The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first." Now, I want you to notice a great thing taking place here. Don't miss this. See, now notice the word says here in 2 Thessalonians that there's three things. Notice from the 13th to the 16th verse, there's three things that has to happen before the Lord himself appears. What's what's he speaking of? Before you meet him in the air, there's three things have got to happen. Well, and when do they happen? Quickly now so we can close. The first thing happens, notice a shout, a voice, a trumpet. Jesus does all three of them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When he descending. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, we've seen him. The picture was taken of him. He's appeared as he promised in the word again. &gt;&gt; And who's he coming to to receive his bride? And while he descends, he's making himself uniting with that bride. Who is the headstone? &gt;&gt; Amen. Just turn the picture to the right. There he is in the cloud. Just exactly what the two angels notice when he comes back to Israel. There's two witnesses that declares coming. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And two witnesses when he left said this same Jesus &gt;&gt; who you seen go &gt;&gt; in veveloped in a cloud will likewise so return. &gt;&gt; And as he descends, what's he descending for? Uniting with his body, the bride. As he descends, he does all three things. What's the voice of? The resurrection. What's the shout? The message, &gt;&gt; the voice, the trump. Last trump. &gt;&gt; It's at the last trump. We are caught up and changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me now? It's a gathering. Did not did not the Bible say we are Paul said we are gathered together by the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are being gathered together. What about now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we just said what what about when that group gets together? All right. Now, well, there's going to be a gathering. There's going to be a quickening. They're going to rise first. You're going to your loved one will appear before you. &gt;&gt; But you've already got rapture. &gt;&gt; It just has to go. &gt;&gt; There's a moment of it going right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. The coming of it is coming right through this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, through the voice. All right. That's why you must eat the book. Don't worry about it. You don't sit down to a meal say now this and this. Some people do. They get real picky on this and this and this and this. You know, I got to eat this and this will do this and you just sit down and you eat it and that you expect the food to do what it's called and purposed to do &gt;&gt; and you thank God for it and you blessed it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; What about eternal food? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; What about the open book? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't want to I don't want to bear the the the the purging and the persecution. I want to bear all this. I don't want to bear all that against me. I'll act like a crazy man. and I'll be different. &gt;&gt; You're not willing to be different, &gt;&gt; then you're not willing to die to yourself. &gt;&gt; You have to die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Die to yourself. Give yourself over submission. Surrender completely and let God work through you. &gt;&gt; Your brother Luke, &gt;&gt; it's your birthday. Is that your birthday today? &gt;&gt; No, you said Luke's birthday. Who's Luke? It was on the request. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I just figured. Sorry, brother. I I just thought of that just immediately and I thought, well, &gt;&gt; huh, &gt;&gt; just a greeting. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, it said birthday. Happy birth at a birthday. So, I Okay, I could be wrong. It's a greeting. Greeting, brother Luke. God bless you. All right. Now I'll relax you for what's coming. Okay. Now, now three things. Jesus does all three of them while he's descending. &gt;&gt; Note. All right. Hebrews 11:5. Genesis 5:24. I won't read them to you, Wes. Yes, I will. Genesis 5:24. Very familiar scripture. I'm just going to take just about you. Give me five minutes here and I think I'll be done. Genesis. I'm a hour and a half preacher. I don't care how you slice it. I've tried and tried. Amen. Genesis 5:24 and very familiar scripture, but seventh from Adam is our position right now. &gt;&gt; And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah 300 years and begat sons and daughters. And all the days of Enoch were 365 years. And Enoch walked with God and he was not. &gt;&gt; I wonder if we can say we are a was not. &gt;&gt; I'm not part of this world. He was not. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; God took him. So there was a taking. &gt;&gt; There's something coming to take you. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, Genesis, Hebrews, Hebrews chapter 11. And I because I have a something I want to follow up right real quick here. Hebrews 11 verse 5. By faith, uhoh. &gt;&gt; By faith, Enoch was translated. I wonder if he had a revelation of the rapture. By faith, Enoch was translated that he should not see death. And there's going to be people see death. Now, don't get me wrong, that doesn't take away the revelation. &gt;&gt; Fle said, "See death in this flesh." But that won't take the rapture away. Should not see death and was not found because God had translated him. For before his translation, he had this testimony that he pleased God. Watch what the prophet says here. Um, &gt;&gt; remember when they went to buy oil, talk about the foolish virgin. He said, "Now wait a minute, brother Bam. I don't know about that. When they went to buy oil, they came back. The bride was gone. The door was shut. They knocked and said, "Let us in. Let us in." But they were in outer darkness. Now, if you want a type of that, that's what I'm coming to. But Enoch walked before God for 500 years and had a testimony. He pleased God with, how did he please God? with raptured faith. &gt;&gt; What's the harvest rain going to do? What's it do? Brings hap raptured faith. &gt;&gt; How's it come? Amen. All right. &gt;&gt; Now, so get Christ in your heart. Amen. That's the real thing. And the Holy Spirit is that anointing. The Holy Spirit means Christ means the anointed one. And you're the one anointed. And it's Christ in you anointing you. See &gt;&gt; to have the the one of the but see you to have one of the gifts outside the body. Now a person can have the gifts outside the body. &gt;&gt; Outside of the body of Christ. Do you realize that? &gt;&gt; The gifts speaking in tongues, miracles, signs, wonders. All right. He said you can have those gifts outside the body. It would do you no good. &gt;&gt; People rely upon gifts. See, it would do you no good. Though I speak with tongue of men and angels, have not charity, which is God himself revealed in you, it profitth me nothing. Though I have faith and understand all the mysteries of God, profit me nothing. Though I give my body to be burned as a sacrifice, give all the goods, many people will do good things like that. Though I have faith to move mountains, I am nothing. All right? Don't depend on those things. The Holy Spirit is a being. It's God in you, the person God lit your whole entire being. You're changed. You're a new creature and a little thing that goes wrong, any little thing that goes wrong, he'll tell you that's wrong, then quit. Don't do it. Father, I didn't mean to do that. You forgive me. And that's the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We all have errors. We all make mistakes. We all But it'll correct it. All right. Now, watch. You know yourself. It's an individual between you and God. You know it yourself. See, &gt;&gt; you know you've been born again. You know it yourself. It's an individual thing between you and God. You know that something happened. You know that there's a change. Whether anything else, whether there's anything else, you yourself, you're the change. &gt;&gt; Oh, wait a minute. You're the change. &gt;&gt; You're the change. You're one. You're the one who's being changing is changing inside of you. You know you have it. Whether you spoke with tongues, I'm not against that. Now, don't get me wrong. Neither was Brother Brandham. Whether you spoke with tongues, whether you jump, shout, or anything else, you know that God lives in you. You know God lives in you that you don't walk with your own mind. It's the mind of Christ that leads you with that word just exactly the way it goes. When you're born again, now when you're reborn again, that's not the outside conscience. Spirit, body, that's not the outside conscience. The outside what you see, taste, feel, smell, hear, reason, memory, etc., etc. But the inside of that is what you really are. The inside of that, &gt;&gt; that's what soul is what you really are. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, this out here, Satan just tempts you, knocks you around every way here. But down in here, he can't do it unless you let him do it. Now, in here, you've got faith. Faith don't come from the outer conscience. It reasons. In faith, there's no reason. See, but in faith, there's no reason. That's what he says. You've got you've got it from God and you know it's there. I don't care how much looks wrong. You still know it's all right. It's thus sayeth the Lord and there's nothing going to bother that. Nothing can bother that. It's moving right on. Difficult means nothing to it. Wes right on through it. For it's the word and the word's the sword and the sword cuts. &gt;&gt; What's happened? The words, the sword cuts its way through. &gt;&gt; How? The word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you abide in me and my word in you. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon made this statement with St. John 15:7. If you abide in me and my word in you, then he said, you know who you are. &gt;&gt; Perfect faith. All right. Now, I'm going to say it by what God said in unveil prophet spoke message. God spoke through him in the unveiling of God. See, you're unveiling of God. All right. All he is, I am. &gt;&gt; He's raptured. What am I? All he is, I am. What he is, I am. &gt;&gt; And all I am, he is. &gt;&gt; I can quote you right back. Same same words, same What is it? She is him. &gt;&gt; She is him. Then if she is him, who is who is he? He is she. &gt;&gt; All right. Now it's no longer twain. They're one. All right. Now closing. I'm closing. Not a faith. This is coming to that third pull. This is in perfect faith. Paragraph 184. Not a faith, but a perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; there's only one perfect faith. You know that? &gt;&gt; That's God's own faith, and that's the believer. &gt;&gt; Not a faith, but a perfect faith built up in here. And watch a perfect God with a perfect heart keep a perfect promise by his perfect word, which is sharper than a two-edged sword, and a discerner of the thoughts of the heart. What? We're coming now to the perfection because coming coming now to the perfection. All right. Because the people has to come to this in order for the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's what's holding it away right now is waiting for that church to come into that perfect raptured faith. &gt;&gt; You see what's happening? You're growing into that. &gt;&gt; Yes. Wait till that last one comes into that perfect raptured faith. &gt;&gt; What's going to take place? &gt;&gt; You're going to meet him. &gt;&gt; You're going to meet your loved ones. You're going to meet him in the air. You're going to the wedding supper. That's all there is to it. I'm not hope I going to make I'm going to the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; I'm marching out. &gt;&gt; Amen. That marches on. &gt;&gt; All right. Now that's what's holding it away. Waiting for that church come perfect raptured faith looking for it. It means a lot of shaving down for me. &gt;&gt; It means a lot for you and together we'll make it by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore, no, I'm not going to have you stand because that changes the atmosphere. This is my last statement. Therefore, the bride in the rapture will come forth. The bride in the rapture will come forth. &gt;&gt; And there is all pre there. It is all pre-planned by God. All backed up from the beginning. He knowed every man, every place who would set all about it. It's all pre-planned. God knew it would be here. He made it that way so that when we get there, it's he's gone to prepare a place for us. And when we get there, it'll be all prepared just like this morning is prepared. He said this night, this morning is prepared like this hour is prepared. &gt;&gt; Be not afraid. Remember the remember Jesus saying that he walked upon the water. Where's he walking today? &gt;&gt; Be not afraid. It is I. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where this revelation in you, the rapture will go when it knows what it is. Glory to God. Amen. Let's stand. Thank you for your patience. &gt;&gt; You let me get through it. It was a good pull this morning. I appreciate that. Amen. I'd like to sing song number 344. If you'll excuse me a minute, let me [Music] [Music] Who's going to declare generation? Isaiah 53.
