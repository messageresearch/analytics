as he comes let's sing number 453 teach me lord to wait amen is that your prayer lord sometimes we just get ahead of ourselves sometimes we just need to sit back and wait on him amen let's sing this teach me lord to wait hold down on my knees till in your wrong time you answer my plea teach me not to rely on what others do but to wait in prayer for an answer from you lay that way upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as he goes they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faith teach me lord teach me lord to teach me lord to hearts are a flame help me humble all my pride and call on your name lord keep my faith renewed and keep my eyes on thee help me be on this earth what you want me to be lay that wait upon the lord they shall renew [Music] they shall run and [Music] they shall walk and not faint teach me lord [Music] you know we could just take that verse right there and just give me a moment and i'll interject it right here in my sermon amen you know we just get ahead of ourselves a little bit but you know it's interesting no matter who it is that god has called through the ages we look at these great men that god call not one of them come to his ministry already prepared [Music] every one of them was trained by god and here we are in this day and i can't speak for you but i can say there's times that you just feel lord i am so inadequate don't forget an on-time god a prayer answering god is also a god who's willing to school you in the ways of god and that's a beautiful thing right there amen let's just stand as we would go into our thought today amen you know i just feel led in my heart let's just start right off the bat let's just give a little handclap of praise and thanksgiving to the lord this morning we serve an awesome god we serve such a loving god a caring god a protective god and a provider can we say thank you this morning lord we thank you thank you thank you thank you hallelujah lord thank you for your word thank you for your life hallelujah amen i would like to speak to you this morning on the thought of battered but victorious and then as you will see it right here in the scripture we'll take as it were for our secondary or thought that we will touch on for i believe god amen you see my brother and sister if we're not careful we get focused on the battle but first off we need to remember he said you're victorious amen so the devil would like you to look at your circumstance and you'd say man i'm just i just fell down on my face and i i hope you know uh you know how we get up from the dinner table sometimes you know because your wife loves you so much you'll you know maybe you're in a restaurant or something and she'll be just like real subtle and you're like oh i got food on my face you know the devil he'd like to remind you you've got mud on your face but you see the washing of the water of the word means that we're not going to walk out of here with mud on our face we're not going to walk out of here with defeat written in our lives we're going to walk out of here with victory because that's what the word said and that's what's writing on his bride he's writing the very words of victory in our life that we can turn if we'll focus correctly we'll turn and say oh yeah i did but the lord let me overcome it amen and i i failed wait i found victory over that and that becomes the book of our lives that if we honestly look at the book we'll realize that in every portion of our life where once we might have had bitterness and anger anxiety depressions etc etc we can look at that and see there is now stamped over the top of all of that in the very blood of jesus christ victorious oh i tell you it makes my heart so happy amen battered but victorious for i believe god let's turn in the book of acts and just read out of the 27th chapter verses 22 through 25 and so good to see you home brother vasily amen at uh i don't always express it but i just pray for our brothers i know what it's like to have driven a truck find yourself thousands of miles away from home in a world that you absolutely do not relate to acts 27 starting with verse 22 and now i exhort you to be of good cheer i love this starts right off this is what i'm going to exhort you not to do this and not to do that and obey the commandments and do here and do there what i want to do is exhort you to be of good cheer this is paul if you recognize the scripture there on the ship amen doesn't look like too good a circumstance their little boat which held the you know about 276 men is being just beaten on the seas it's coming apart when you watch a timber snap and then you start to see the nails pull from a board and the ship starts to creak and groan and men rush from the belly of the ship and say water is pouring in but paul being a servant of god god said i know paul this is this is a difficult thing it will be for you but don't worry don't worry paul i'm going to send you to rome and let him kill you there did paul flee no sir no and now i exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship for there stood by me this night the angel of god whose i am and whom i serve now if we are as studious of this message as we should be you'll recognize the parallel path of these words saying fear not paul thou must be brought before caesar and lo god had given thee all them that sail with thee now i'm telling you my brother and sister god is faithful because there would have been men on that ship that would be rank heathens but for paul's sake of a testimony god spared a heathen hard men cruel men wherefore sirs be of good cheer for i believe god amen that it shall be even as it was told me amen amen heavenly father we stand before you today lord believing that an angel has come in this day stood next to a man but a man called of god father we see as the years go by that truly the words that were spoken are true and we believe them amen but lord i believe that you led me also to other thoughts today and the prophet of god talking about how man has always taken your work your move and raised up and honored men instead of you amen oh father lord we want to recognize the word as your word the power is your power revelation is your revelation we thank you father that you had sent an angel to stand next to men and would give them a sure word of prophecy and that they would be courageous enough to speak it believe it and act upon it now lord i pray today that you would let us be courageous enough lord to receive the word act upon it speak it and live it amen lord we thank you for this opportunity to come this morning lord we we just thank you from the depths of our hearts your name we pray amen you may be seated saints you know sometimes the lord just um it just works i guess you would call it not call it it is mysterious you know to wake up in the middle of the night and and uh thinking okay i'll fall asleep in a moment but you don't gives you an opportunity to just start going through the church and start praying for the saints and to ponder on the things that the lord's laid upon your heart and i just prayed this morning that i would be able to to speak this in the fashion as it is now this thought goes back for quite some time i say this in humor but i almost jumped up and said stop right there brother david on wednesday night don't you trespass one step further yes but you see but you see how god god has a message saints it's not brother chris's message it's not brother david's message it's not my message it's not william branham's message but it's his message and he is knitting this together now my brother and sister when i was a young kid my my grandmother being of that nature said it's not unmanly for a young boy to learn how to crochet and so you know at a young age i was quite adept i could take a crochet needle and i could just go along 90 miles an hour but i never made a blanket so you could take that you know 50 foot long string that i crocheted and you could start at your feet and just wrap it around you and maybe it would work like a blanket but you see god is knitting his word together he's not having an independent string here and an independent string here but he's knitting all of the word together to come as it were to be the blanket of the word to wrap around you and i because you see he's not looking at you and i saints he's looking at his word and his word is not leaving gaps in our life that we say well you know i've been delivered of everything but you know armed robbery and so god is knitting a perfect amen you might say blanket of word around us that the fiery darts of the enemy have to come in contact with the word if we're doing our part and so by god's grace you know we can just move and and look at this and my brother and sister i like that verse he said wherefore sirs be of good cheer so he's exhorting them which we're gonna name them as it were unbelievers but he's exhorting them be of good cheer for i believe god and god is going to come for my sake for the mission he has called me to and god is going to take care of me and so therefore you're going to lose the ship which might you know represent a large investment as you read the scriptures there you'll see that uh they throw the wheat into the ocean now somebody would have just cried over that but you see it was there that god required a a physical manifestation to still bring the ship to the shore he didn't say now be of good cheer god's going to just take everything just lay down whatever no these men were struggling they were laboring they were throwing everything that they could throw off of the ship and as it should be in our life we need to labor to throw everything that is not going to get us to the shore we need to throw it out of our life we need to occult i tell you what god i'll just be transparent enough to tell you i i like to read some of these fiction kind of well written but fiction you know mystery stories of military and intrigue i've always liked those but as god just even dealt with me yesterday i picked one up and just sister jerry helping me arrange my little library room and i picked one up and i thought i'm just going to relax for a moment and i started to read it and i won't go into detail and i the thought that came to me why is this in my house i got up out of the chair i walked into the trash can and dropped it in the trash can oh oh you could have gave it to goodwill that someone could have got a book full of filth for free but god dealing with me that's it brother lighten the ship the shore is in sight and god didn't promise to calm the sea so you could come to that shore there can be a tempters right to the very moment that we reach the shore but god requires for us to throw everything that's not godly everything that's not necessary to lighten the ship amen amen amen amen we look here paul's vision think about paul killing the christians a great commission with great sincerity he is pursuing what he believed was his calling with a fervency not known to many men but god strikes him down and when god is done with him sends him to the backside of the desert and what does he do he untrains god i mean untrain's gone god untrained paul excuse me god untrains paul on the side of a desert and through that training paul believed now you say he already believed or he wouldn't went through the back side of the desert but my brother and sister let it let me put it this way you can have doctrine correct doctrine without revelation but if you have revelation revelation of god will take you to the correct doctrine amen that's what brother branham's talking about of right attitude right spirit some people are like oh oh these people around the message they have such a good spirit oh oh but their doctrine stinks and it stunk for 20 years and i pray god delivers them their doctrine because it's against the word of god but people misconstrued what the prophet said and thought because these people were so nice and sweet my brother and sister god wants us to have the right doctrine and he wants us to have the right spirit amen not one or the other not some dose of one or the other but to have the right doctrine and to have the right spirit and god delivers paul from the wrong spirit and the wrong doctrine imagine that so instead of casting these people off with the wheat let's pray for them amen that those that have these things that won't line up with the word they don't fit it's not my opinion my brother and sister it simply don't fit in the word so pray for them that god would deal with their heart and deal kindly with their heart and so here paul is now on the backside of the desert god is training him and as it is training sometimes saints is untraining so in the training god is taking certain things away from us to put us in the correct position that future training now it's really funny i give this just a little analogy it's actually a very lovely memory for me that quite a few years ago we went to sun lakes and uh it was a fun time it was good brother jay it's his fault look everybody at brother j his fault anyway um you know uh they're like come on we're we're gonna go and and sun lakes you have to understand their little golf course is literally like a cow pasture and uh he says come on paul do this do this so i go out there and and i'm hitting the ball pretty good but brother jay looks over brother jason looks over and he goes brother paul um i'm surprised you haven't broken your wrist by now and i'm like what are you talking about he says because you're holding the golf club entirely wrong and when i say i was hitting the ball pretty good i'm not like boasting like oh i hit it right there but they were at least you know headed in that direction and he says no this is how you're supposed to hold the golf club i'm like okay i want to do it right do you know i believe i know i'm exaggerating but i could almost hit a ball golf ball in a 360. wow maybe i need to face this direction but one thing that drove home the brothers brother jay especially i think he felt like he had a special license he's like paul if you don't hold it correctly now you'll never be able to do it right you see at the moment i had my way and i said see my way gets results but to move forward i needed to learn how to do it correctly can anybody say oh i see that in my life i see that in my life god's stopping us we think it's working god's stopping us and saying no i need to train you correctly because you'll reach a point in your way that you'll never progress any further oh let me remind you that at that little deal up there all of the things were hitting the ball were not real far right so when i'd hit the ball and it would just start to veer off and it landed on the green we were okay but when you have to hit the ball a long ways like from here to eternity a little deviation right here so we look how god was working on paul because you see paul could not preach any deviation paul could not come just close with the gospel but god called paul to lay a bedrock a foundation that a whole church would be built on and we'll time together here in just a minute uh if god's gracious so we see now as god's doing that and you know what god's doing here states what god's training us today we can say well he's training me here training me here but you know one of the biggest factors god's training us today is to look beyond this flesh now tell me that is not hard tell me that is not a great battle to look beyond this flesh we could use a lot of examples opinion being one of those and if all of you would just listen to my opinion you would be better off until you're not you see but we build upon this flesh we build upon our own ideas we build beyond the realm of hey this is just nothing and we start to flesh it out until we create it to be something and god comes along and says you know what you're my sons and daughters of god and i have anointed you yes anointed you to receive the word in its entirety to be fleshed out as sons and daughters of god to receive a power that the world knows nothing of to have not only creative power but to have a rapturing faith which is a power that came from the word amen and so we cannot just be close on these things god has a requirement that we would also come down that every detail is important amen now this would be very subjective by a lot of different terms but i would ask you this morning what do you think our training is this morning feel free to speak out if you'd like to it's actually quite simple the prophet of god used it as a theme song do you know really that's the training god's not training us to be some supernatural warrior not training us to be theologians you're not training us to be a dominant to those around it god's training us saints to only believe now all of those attributes that you will need to defeat satan comes from believing amen that's right we can put it all down we say well this brother has a gift of discernment this brother lays hands on people prays for them amen you know and we see in this man my brother and sister for that to be manifested in their life as a true gift of god they have to believe the word in its entirety not one jot or tittle can be left out or added amen so you see our training is to believe and sometimes it comes so simple that we kind of miss it we kind of get caught up in the battle and you know the lord's words to us uh forgive me i'm just going to paraphrase a few things this morning but you see in our training the lord's words to us is i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world do we believe that see that ought to be something so anchored within our souls that we we can't even believe the devil because the devil's going to come and in his subtle way he's going to try and get us to just hesitate amen just to hesitate all it takes to strike out a batter when the ball is thrown to him is for him just to hesitate he can see where the ball is coming he knows he can hit that ball but if he hesitates that 98 or whatever mile an hour ball will already be in the pitchers i mean the catcher's mitt when his hesitation is resolved to move forward that's why the prophet of god said only believe don't let any anything as i said i'm kind of paraphrasing kind of bringing this out so don't don't hold me to the exact words this morning that's why the prophet of god said for you to not hesitate on the word but say amen when the word comes forth say amen and god will put it down in the bedrock now my brother and sister you've been given a supernatural filter amen a lot of talk in the age that we live in people talking about well we don't believe we don't listen to preachers because we don't want to have to run a filter they're deceiving themselves they're deceiving themselves god called you to have a filter god did not say i'm going to send my bride into laodicea without a filter amen what is the filter the holy ghost so when you hear people say i i just want to listen to a tape because i don't have to have a filter they're actually saying i can listen to this tape and i don't have to worry about whether i have the holy ghost or not i want the filter i want god to come down and so supernaturally annoying to us that we without hesitation know what is the word we can recognize and discern it is true or it is false i believe this whether i'm on top of the mountain or in a swamp he's with me amen right whether i'm having one of the best days of my life or i'm having one of the worst days of my life he's with me amen amen it's his voice it says you've done wrong correct it it's his voice it says hey don't look at the mud i'm here to wash you by the word he's the one that's with us my brother and sister we can be battered but victorious amen you know as the one song says must we oh how does that go flowery beds of ease well there's fought sailed bloody seas yes the words are going by so fast i can't i can't grasp them those saints my brother and sister people are like oh praise the lord we've just always walked so so steady in the word i'd have to wonder if the devil knows if he's leaving you alone he knows come on saints hear me if the devil knows that you are a predestinated son of god he's not going to walk away from you he's going to chomp down every briar branch he can throw in your path he's going to drop every rock he can in the trail before you he's going to put every circumstance in your life he's going to put it to where you feel like i can't go no further only to get up and go hey he is afraid of you saints amen but if satan's not touching your life and you are just going so flowery bit of ease you ought to be actually afraid this bride of christ will be battered but the word says emphatically she's victorious don't look at the scars that you have don't look at the struggles you've had don't look at the past my brother and sister you will be battered but you will be victorious this is the promise of the word in our day amen hallelujah ii corinthians the fourth chapter the seventh verse amen go ahead brother mason put that up okay but we have this treasure what is that treasure it's him amen it's him my brother and sister we don't have any other treasure look think about this take this back to paul on the ship the vision doesn't save the ship the vision saves the other vessel amen i mean the holy ghost my my thoughts are just racing this morning forgive me the holy ghost doesn't save that ship there that paul's riding on it saved the other vessel now look at this but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that's us right that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us you see how in one sentence god takes it and says you know what i actually let you slip on that banana peel every once in a while because it's a reminder to you that you can't do it but i'm right here to keep you right here to keep you we are i just with a little liberty some words today we are battered on every side yet not distressed let me read it correctly we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed what is being perplexed my brother and sister always knowing exactly what everything is and we just got it figured out and i read the message and i say i believe it and so therefore the devil can't touch me no sir perplexed is when you can be in church and the holy spirit move upon you and you are moved to the very fiber of your being and walk out and the devil slam the door in your face and you say how can that be lord how can that be god's allowing this you see because the worst thing we can do is think our vessel doesn't need him when we get to the place our vessel in our mind doesn't need him you know you're totally lost you see so god's allowing these we're troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair what is the paradox of life my brother and sister look at the prophet i want to bring this as an example i actually experienced this in my own body in south america uh years ago the prophet of god is now there's a lot of circumstances those events in africa that bring up to this but the prophet of god is there with a pain that burns like fire in his belly and he is praying for people and they are healed and delivered here is when you're perplexed brother branham is asking god why lord why are you're healing them but there's times i i can't even bear this pain in my own body why lord i guess i must not be god's prophet i must not be a christian what did god do some of you will be able to say amen to this god let that pain amoebas and whatever god use that to move brother branham over to another position but i prayed the brothers prayed for me that god would heal me let go and let god have his way don't dig down poor concrete shackle a big chain to it wrap the chain around you i won't be moved no god might be trying to move you to another position i must not have enough faith to be healed maybe god wants to move you to another position let it move you right amen you say but what do we do brother paul you stand on the unshakable word of god get up every morning and say i'm healed in the name of jesus christ i don't care if the pain doubles you over i don't care if the headaches bother you i don't care if the backaches bother you the hypocrite bothers you the footage hurts so i'm healed in the name of jesus christ because i've been given an unshakeable anchor but it's not in this flesh it's here in this word so look at this distressed we're perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that's right amen aren't you glad actually i'm going to say this boldly aren't you glad that god doesn't require you to be nailed to a cross to pay the debt of your life but allowed you in this realm to simply claim that blood accept that blood and act upon that blood so god allows it we say oh you know it's been so hard serving the lord really really we don't know pain we don't know suffering we don't know despair none of us have sat in the garden and sweated out great drops of blood there's actually a medical term or terminology concerning that and it can happen in humans but they say that the stress level must be so high it is borderline to death that's exactly right it's so hard to serve the lord most of us are allergic to sweating much less sweating blood that's right i don't mean not harsh that might not have come out right that's right always bearing about the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body i i'd like to see a hand not for me but for the lord who wants to see the life of christ manifest in this body i want to see the reality of a living savior a god who loved us so much that before there was even an earth he said i put it all in place for you paul i put it all in place for you trevor i put it all in place for you amen oh hallelujah for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest oh see the separation here saints there's a separation here the apostle paul he caught that and anointed of the word to lay it down so we could read it see it's one thing to be manifest in our body but this is in a spiritual context and he brings it down and ties this same suffering and his same sacrifice to mortal flesh so we can't go out living any old kind of life immortal flesh that's kind of one of the foundations that two soul doctrine people actually use well there's separation there's mortal flesh and then there's a spiritual me that mortal guy he lies cheats steals drinks gambles but my spiritual man doesn't come on saints the devil oh hallelujah i'll wait on that lord please remind me okay let's turn in acts 28 we're kind of did a roundabout thing here so please forgive me follow this though and when they were escaped then they knew that the island was called malia and the barbarians people so not not a christian they didn't fall amongst christians they fell amongst barbarians i have a bunch of friends that i've fallen into over life and i don't mean to sound like i'm banging on them but they're barbarians they are plain and simple barbarians we're talking about men that don't think anything about god ever yeah but time changes barbarians also and the barbarians people showed us no little kindness for they kindled the fire and received us everyone because of the present rain and because of the cold and when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the heat and fastened on his hand oh i hope i don't forget to share that i didn't put the quote in my sermon but i just have to share that and when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand they said amongst themselves no doubt this man is a murderer yeah whom though he hath escaped the sea yet vengeance suffereth not to live and he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm howbeit they looked when he should have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly but after they had looked a great a while and saw no harm come to him they changed their minds even barbarians can change their minds oh praise the lord if he sends a barbarian into our church saints pray for them give them time to change their mind amen amen saw no harm come to him they changed their minds and said that he was a god oh look at this supernatural my brother and sister everything that happened in those scriptures right there how it come to bring paul to this place in front of those people to stand and to come and see the word manifested through his life this is supernatural this is supernatural my brother and sister amen it is there that we see how god is choosing to bring the word in a realm that these people could understand paul didn't walk off in great flowing gowns off of a ship and then start to tell them you are heathens you don't believe in christ you must do they no doubt had no idea who jesus christ was but god knew how to get through their armor god knew how to put paul on the ship and batter him as he fasted day and night batter him god didn't say i'm going to put you on a gyro inside the ship that you won't feel anything everything will be just perfect in your world no sir when that ship crashed down and when that ship rolled over on its side don't you think paul was a human when he was there and he's looking at the water right here and the side of the ship is up here that a human element would say oh it's all done it's all done but paul was stepped into a realm my brother and sister that is possible for you and i to step into and that is a complete trust a complete faith in god and paul wasn't on the ship going oh help me but paul prayed 14 days amen that's right cannot be kind of straightforward amen if i ever hear a word out of you as your pastor i say this in love i don't only say this harshly i ever hear a word out of you that god doesn't answer prayers be prepared for me to ask you if you've been praying 14 days straight isn't that fair see god required it of paul and god gave him the results through the years i've had people come and say brother paul i've been praying about this god hasn't given me an answer i didn't used to be so bold most of you probably noticed that i'm getting to the point i say this in a correct fashion but i'm getting to the point i don't really care he used to be concerned about hurting feelings and buttering everybody up so that you know it's just good but we're seeing that nations are breaking we're seeing every sign that's promised to the word and it's time for us to put feeling here and be concerned what it will feel like to stand before our lord and savior amen will we feel overwhelming joy or will we feel overwhelming sadness and agony that's the only feelings that i'm coming except for when i feel bad that's different no some of you are thinking that he don't understand mine he just knew what i went through no i'm sorry that's right god don't care that's right god don't care i don't know why i said that so here is paul now all he's been through god introduces a serpent out of the wood and it latches on to paul's hand and paul is there now oh my brother and sister if you want to know where god's viewing this you want to know the foundation where brother branham said about the hot grease it all depends on whether you fear it or not your reaction to the hot grease will determine whether it hurts you or not it comes right here and god established it right in the scripture right here and this serpent leaps as it were out of the wood out of the fire and it latches on to paul's hand and my goodness the the the barbarians looked and thought that guy's gone no doubt they could say that's a that's a this a viper this and or whatever that is and and that whatever it is they're not like oh okay well it'll be no they're looking for him to start staggering hand to start swelling up the arm and just fall over it really does happen that fast with some snakes and so they're looking to that paul was looking to christ paul wasn't looking to a viper that was hanging on his hand paul wasn't looking to didn't the preacher say one time that no it was so ingrained in paul i don't have time this morning to give it all i might have put it in there but it's so ingrained brother branham says paul was so full of the holy ghost that that viper could not inject its venom in him oh it might have actually punctured his skin and put the venom in there but there's a difference my brother and sister i'll get ahead of myself here but you have been snake bit you're in laodicea the serpent is present my brother and sister you have been snake bit but it's a matter of how you receive the bite of the serpent as what happens in your life oh so look at this i want to jump over a little further here real quick i want to keep going you know jesus was bit by the serpent amen in that day the serpent manifested itself as a religious spirit and it bit him and we can say oh my oh my our lord jesus but you see my brother and sister god wants the word to be fulfilled more than he cares about feelings he didn't say jesus are you okay with this but go read your bible jesus cried out in his moments of turmoil lord not my will what was he doing dying to flesh amen he was giving this flesh over in the ultimate sacrifice not my will because our will would be flowery beds of ease but lord thy will be done and so he lets as it is i hope you could see this he lets this serpent of the religious spirits you see my brother and sister it was church it was church that killed jesus now we can argue it was our sins that he was paying for but i want you to understand the steps or the progress which god brought it by to bring the word to pass for you and i and they thought they were accomplishing something because we're crucifying this man and it was the religious spirit of the day that was what the serpent came in that day was a religious spirit come in there and said wow this guy makes himself god he blasphemes he has they have eaten on the sabbath they have done this they have done that this can't be and we reject it but yet their own admission by some of their own men said we know that thou earth the christ what is it a public image and inside the closed doors image now i hope this doesn't offend anybody but you see that's still going on today yes it is we have people and i don't believe it's here in our church god help us in all honesty and love i say god help us if a spirit would be here but you see the outside one was like oh yes yes god bless you love you the other one doesn't care what befalls you in fact rejoices to see something before you religious spirit the serpent still got his fangs out what is he doing judas judas look at it my brother and sister you see the holy the spirit says that the spirit departed him and he was filled you know with satan's spirit my brother and sister it was there the fangs was already already there the whole time the venom was there the whole time but it brought that circumstance to bring judas to the place that he would let satan take over his body to fulfill the lord amen so jesus gets bit by this religious spirit but it's to fulfill the scripture this religious spirit this venom of the day put him in the grave but do you realize the only reason he went to the grave my brother and sister was to fulfill the prophesied word amen it was not that satan you hear religious people say well satan had power over jesus for that little short season but jesus said i lay my life down there was no i've been forced to do this there was no i've been put in an impossible situation he said i lay my life down denoting that it was his power as it were that he submitted to god now that venom should have put him there in the grave to fulfill the word should have kept him there praise the lord i get excited amen but it couldn't what was he showing us saints very simple showing us the venom of this religious world might put you in a natural grave but it won't keep you there hallelujah thank you lord thank you lord we don't have to worry about it we might die of old age or disease or whatever you know just going through the library coming across you know uh the booklet do you fear cancer oh my brother and sister it is something that just grips people i know people within the message i'm not i'm not speaking down at them but they literally they literally be like i can't eat this and i can't eat this because in california they've researched and this causes cancer so i won't do this and i'm thinking where are you going to find on this polluted earth i took now this in the natural i took a virgin seed never been hybrid that you can tell though after all i mean i've looked at a lot of celery seeds and the ones that are hybrid are always they just stand right out corn seed that's been hybrid it just like has in fine print you know oh it says hybrid on it do you realize hybrid message is unidentifiable without the holy ghost that's exactly right without the holy ghost we'll digest it and think it was the greatest thing that ever come down the way but it takes the holy ghost to identify to us this has been hybrid this is not original this is not the word god's given us a supernatural ability to take this back to the original church and to be able to compare the two and identify the spirit of the day amen so we look at this jesus bit by the serpent paul is then bit by the serpent now i want to just give you this little bit out of this question and answers here i think of saint paul out there on the aisle after shipwreck god had given him a vision and when 14 days and nights all hopes was gone they'd ever be saved the little old boat tossing about like that and they was all crying and 14 days a night but paul was down there had a vision he came out and he said be of good courage for the angel of god whose servant i am has stood by me and said fear not for thou must be brought before caesar and lo gods give all those who sail with you and when the ship wrecked and went up on the shores and they had got over there with the natives paul was picking up some sticks and he went and laid them on the fire and there come a big serpent i've seen all kinds of depictions most of them show this little guy they'd be like could you hold still so i could bite you do you know the little blue racer it's pretty poisonous but his mouth and his fangs are so small that you pretty much have to hold your fingers open like this and relax so he can get a hold of this little piece of skin right here because otherwise he can't get you hallelujah big old serpent my brother and sister don't forget the devil's big until you put the magnification of the word upon him and you get to watch him shrank until people will serve him their whole life and see him in the sight of the pit and say this is what kept us from serving god this little thing come on amen and went up on the shores and they got over there with the natives paul picked up some sticks he went laid them on the fire and there was a big serpent grabbed him by the hand now that serpent injected poison of that in his hand that would have killed him within a minute the native said watch that fellow fall dead he'll just die in a minute yeah he'll just die in a minute amen do we have more we somehow miss the rest of that quote okay no problem no problem right here he's in chains for preaching the gospel religious people put him in chains the very finest of churches that day was what put him in chains it just wasn't the cons if if it just wasn't the constitution in the united states they'd do the same thing today that's right just wait till she's till she's broke a little more oh my goodness saints when i read that i thought lord this is your word coming to pass the prophet acknowledged it's just for the constitution they've already got all their plans made god made his plans before the foundation of the world they've been scheming since the garden with their plants and so it's there just a little bit more got to break it down just a little bit more hallelujah amen hallelujah yeah you know it's kind of interesting had this shared with us here recently that um you know they just allow you to have just as much liberty as they want to allow you to have liberty and you don't have an ounce more why they don't want a whole nation to go into an uproar you've got to be led to the point that that you've already made your decision which way you're going to go because you see if they do it before that then people can reverse their decision are you with me so what's happening the mark of the beast doesn't become manifest until people have submitted themselves either to the holy ghost or to the devil amen and it's in those seasons right just study history i did quite an extensive thing on history look from 1956 now you can find it on the internet and everything that's on google is true uh and uh you'll see how it is though but you'll see the marked increase of every kind of behaviors from 1956. yes if there was any vindication that we needed to to document or signpost this my brother and sister the world out here has produced it for us we didn't have to manufacture it abortions that's it uh uh people living together all whatever just every every you know everything there is just started ramped up right there so you see that watch that fellow fall dead he'll just die in a minute see what it's doing but now we're seeing here in the word that it's there and as it is my brother and sister god is bringing this to pass in such a fashion that this is where i brought this in earlier it's the religious people put him in the chains the finest of the churches that day put him in chains amen and a serpent grabbed him through the hand now watch paul didn't fear he said jesus christ said if they take up serpents it shall harm them so he walks over there over here shakes him off on the fire turns around walks over got some sticks put back on the fire turned around and warmed his back turned around this way and warmed his hands a native said why don't he die why when almost every holiness movement in the united states is dying from the bite of the serpent why aren't you that's it why aren't you dying why aren't we compromising why aren't we giving up why aren't we saying the culture of this day is more important in the church why why oh all i can say is thank you lord that's right amen thank you lord hallelujah my brother and sister i won't name i won't name churches i won't name things but it goes back in my past from my grandmother being there in the through the years and and uh not knowing what our futures were but a a young man named paul that i was friends with in a holiness church and a guy named paul that by the grace of god stands here before you today and to see the path that has come a good preacher a dynamic preacher and their religion changed all their rules and the scripture to keep him in the pulpit that's it do you think a church that will change its own belief to keep man in the pulpit is going to preach the truth to you let us all be judged by the pure word of god not by man's ideas not by a hierarchy but by the word amen now let me hurry and why don't he die why don't that man die he ought to drop dead but paul was so full yes here i love it paul was so full of the holy ghost see what i mean is so full of the holy ghost until the poison wouldn't poison him now look at laodicea saints the fiery bite of the serpent of laodicea is biting and biting i can show you as you would take it from my testimony i can show you the fang marks of a 15 year old that said i'm done with this i got sick for a while but the poison couldn't kill me hallelujah can somebody say amen thank you lord hallelujah tell the poison wouldn't poison him oh brother give me a church full of the holy ghost and god will do in one year what all the theologists failed to do in 2000 years you wait until the anointing of the church really strikes home to that faithful little remnant after the doors of the gentiles is closed o god will anoint the church then he who is filthy let him be filthy still who is righteous let him be righteous still he who is holy let him be holy still and god will anoint the church with the power of god and things will be taking place not only that then but he's doing it right now hallelujah we don't have to look off in the future when's god going to work god's moving right now the devil has come with a fang of bitterness and a fang of anxiety and a fang of fear and doubt and the fang of reasoning and he's coming along here and he's biting here and there and god's coming along as it was he already really came along but pardoned me and my mind is like going no it's all past tense paul excuse me i'm a little weird this morning maybe sister jerry put something in my coffee but look at this my brother and sister the people are still looking we're looking for a sign to follow william branham's ministry and i'm out here and you're out here saying praise the lord there it is brown look look look look what god's doing answered prayers the supernatural i'm standing here and telling you today god answers prayer constantly constantly saying i'm not looking off in some future time it's here it's now the serpent tried to kill it he's been biting it with all of his anti-message or whatever you want to call it oh i tell you what my brother and sister well there's people that are believing the sign and there are people that are believing the sign amen they'll believe whatever sign they look to whatever sign they have anointed themselves and prepared themselves for is the sign that they will receive at the biting of the serpent because none of us will sit here and say i've never had a doubt i've never had a fear i've never had an anxiety we can't say that no that's right we'd be lying if any one of us said oh i've just never but why did it kill your friend you grew up with and it didn't kill you why did great men in our midst fall away and not you amen say but you know i went through this and i don't know that i had the holy ghost well you know there was that man that picked up that track you know the story he went to this church that church this ministry that ministry he went everywhere finally ends up talking to brother branham and he's like i i need the holy ghost i want to find the holy ghost and brother branham is talking to him and he says oh you know so you found that track what happened he said i picked up that track and i read that and something happened inside of me imagine saints the prophet of god tells him that's when you receive the holy ghost when you cried out and said i have to have this but the bite of the serpent said now after you get done this and you do this and you do this and you serve faithfully here and give enough money to the church of course and do all these things and then you'll get the holy ghost no the prophet of god brings it down simplicity you imagine the rejoicing in that man's heart when he realized the hunger that drove him from coast to coast from ministry to ministry that hunger that was there god had already come and brought the answer oh hallelujah but satan tried to bite him tried to get him into the religious system tried to put the venom of religiosity into him and it left them there many of them cold that's right right that's exactly right can we go on for just a moment now let's look at the serpent in our day you thought i was preaching about our day but i really wasn't i just getting started look at this serpent of our day saints the prophet of god started voicing i was going to look it up i don't even know how many months but not that long before the lord took him off the scene the prophet of god started talking about i want to go back and i want to preach on the trail of the serpent why wouldn't that be nice if the lord would allow him to done that please pardon me i say this only facetiously second brother trevor i'm looking to see if under the tees if your name is on this list of the trail of the serpent oh sister kerry imagine what kind of a judgmental cannibalistic but god said i don't need to do that i don't need to do that because you see i'm going to fill my children so full of the holy ghost that the serpent of laodicea oh he might bite him come on if we were all courageous enough this morning we'd lift our hands and say there's times that we have been depressed we have been discouraged we have about given up on everything we have been hurt our hearts have just cried in despair and the devil want to come along and say see you all that happened because you're not really a son or daughter of god and if there was a list out there we'd be running over to the list and reading it and the devil would have in almost near perfect would have written our name in the sideline see your name's here god says you know what i'm not going to let you preach that because i'm going to let it manifest right don't go pulling the weed the weeds out of the wheat too early you'll kill some wheat let the holy ghost come right down in the end time here and it's going to start to separate these things and people are going to start to say now look the prophet of god said use young men these young men will come at the revelation of the message to carry it on i'm that young man follow me and some said we'll follow you but some said late lord my god said there'll be no other idols amen before me that's it right now look is this god of god or the serpent how's your filter doing you realize you've got to clean your filter every day you can't just get it all clogged up and let it go on bypass because then every little wiggle tail and whatever else goes up here can't go through the filter goes through the bypass and then people start believing all kinds of crazy things so if we'll take what the prophet told us i don't even need to go there do i we know what the prophet told us about pulling the filter out every day cleaning the filter read your bible and repent every single day wash the filter hallelujah i know this is just a real simple simple thought today my brother and sister but i'll tell you he wanted to preach the trail of the serpent because the serpent needed exposed can we say amen the serpent needed exposed but wait let's go back through the message let's go back through the message we're like we needed the prophet to preach this to expose the spirits of this day no come on go study the message pray over the message seek the mind of god read your bible and you'll find out those spirits have already been exposed the prophet of god didn't need to preach the trail of the serpent because the message of the hour and already exposed him he was already completely exposed amen but in man's reasoning in men's minds it was like you know what it's not talking about me brother david must be talking about you wasn't talking about our denomination must be talking about your denomination i'm telling you my brother and sister the holy ghost come and revealed every spirit contrary to the holy ghost in the hour we live in somebody bring some different idea of the message to you my brother and sister don't go swallowing that thing you know reminds me of a cartoon i've seen once if you don't mind be bringing a little humor and it shows these two fish and the ones holding the paper and here before them is a hook with this great big chunk of bait hanging on it and the one fish has already got his mouth open and the other one's like according to research that's evil what was it one was ready just swallow it another one says that's evil we don't know whether that one went ahead and swallowed it or not first corinthians 11 chapter here again would to god paul speaking to the corinthians he says would to god you could bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me from jealous over you is it is it okay for a pastor to be jealous over his church he said i'm jealous over you with a godly jealousy for i've espoused you to one husband then i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ but i fear last by any hook with bait on it by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ for if he that cometh preaches another jesus whom we have not preached or you receive another spirit which we have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with him paul was concerned that when these things were introduced that people would not take it back to the word you say well praise the lord we take everything back to the word do we do we come on did you guys take my last sunday sermon and open up the message and say i want to see if paul's preaching the truth or did you just assume that you knew is that somebody's hide come on saints we need to be that serious about this oh but we know you brother paul we know you love us and we know you preach the truth do you do you well i would hope that you actually had confidence in me but you see so many through the scriptures blindly trusted the scripture records 400 into the wilderness all lost these out here lost these come to naught come on saints the serpent the serpent is so clever paul's telling him i'm jealous over you i want to present you as a chaste virgin i don't want you dancing with the devil and then putting on your clean clothes and coming to church that preaches another jesus or you receive another spirit or another gospel my brother and sister oh you're going to think i'm just can't let it go but there's people stood right here in this pulpit stood right here did you hear me people stood right here and spoke things that don't line up with scripture what is he injected in our day doubt fear bitterness disappointment it's killed some previously injured some you imagine now my brother and sister the devil brother trevor sorry you're on the front row sister nadia moved away amen i love you sister nadia but you see wait let me let me go about this a little different fashion say i lied to brother trevor we're talking about the capacity of a pastor i lied to brother trevor in other words it's a blatant outright misrepresentation and then i come back and i said brother trevor i really didn't mean to lie to you not one bit of sincerity just you know i didn't mean it i'm not going to look in the eye but i didn't mean it brother how long do you think it'll take brother trevor to ever trust me again almost impossible it is absolutely the grace of god amen so we come down and people say i'm not really bitter but i there's no way i'd trust this oh let's make it more personal no way i can trust my pastor might as well move on because even if the man has repented you'll never be able to trust him doubt put into the heart fear bitterness disappointment kill some but the devil wins just as well if it just grievously injures you if it leaves you where you don't trust what's being preached you don't trust the men who carried the word you see it's almost impossible but this bride and i i have my notes here word revealed amen she's not just a people out here this bride is the word revealed you realize saints it's not just us and we were so lucky that the message came to us no you are the word revealed in this hour you are the vessels that god the earth and vessel that god chose to pour his word into to be manifested in this day oh my brother and sister look at how it is and god just does it so this bride amen you know what's happening oh saints i hope you catch this you have been inoculated you've been anointed it doesn't mean that you're bite proof oh would somebody be brave enough to say i have been bit i have been bit the words the doubts the fears the bitternesses i have been bit but praise god he also anointed me with the holy ghost that i can shake off that unbelief and i'm not going to shake it off i'm going to throw it back into the pit of hell into the fire where it belonged hallelujah amen amen shake off satan's venom and still living i'll tell you what this bride because of eternal life being deposited in her will still be living when satan that little man is cast in the pit that's right oh take the symbology of paul taking that serpent who's come all the way through the ages and come right down and paul one of the greatest messengers god ever placed on the earth and he says i know where you belong serpent he didn't go throw him in the sea he didn't go throw him back out in the sticks out here oh look at the symbology saints he threw him in the fire oh hallelujah and then he didn't lament all these things about the serpent and the fact that the serpent bit him and all these things he went and got more wood and got his own personal fire that was for him as a son of god and threw more wood on it and warmed himself amen made himself ready to receive what god wanted and the mighty works and he goes on and turns these barbarians my brother and sister into believers he heals that one man's father from the bloody scours and he comes and the supernatural is there and these guys are like we'd heard there was a god but now we've seen amen oh look at this amen oh oh my i got to hurry john 10 24 amen look at this just real quick so you see they said unto him how long does this make us to doubt if that'll be the christ tell us plainly jesus answered them i told you you believe not the works that i do in my father's name they bear witness of me but you believe not because you're not my sheep as i said unto you my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish amen look at this i want to put it to you this way right here you'll still be living when the serpent is cast into the pit oh praise the lord amen and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand what a confidence my brother and sister amen you say well brother paul there's times i just feel like that i couldn't even be a sheep praise the lord praise the lord i'm actually you know what you're going to think i'm weird i'm happy that you don't think you could be a sheep because the worst thing to kill a christian is a narcissistic view of the word of god it's all about me it's all about me god did everything for me well the believers over there saying the same words but behind that is saying lord without you i am nothing without your holy spirit i'd be gone in a day i would be just crushed by this little man we call satan but because he can give the image i would defeat catch us i would defeat myself do you realize satan will never defeat one single individual amen you've got to walk over the whole word of god to get to hell that's exactly right that's exactly right you allowed the devil to anoint you to defeat yourself amen amen that's right yeah that's why the devil's outside the church crying right now because he gets blamed for everything yeah my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hands and i and my father are one i i threw that i put on here optional for time but i read it anyway so i hope you don't mind amen now let's hurry along here i don't keep you too long now in christ the mystery of god revealed have any of you listened to this recently yeah i'm telling you if you haven't please go listen to it it is so power packed you know you see advertisements i don't remember i was in a store the other day they had a tv up on a display for sale and and just as i was walking as it were towards it you know they have some i don't know what what it was you guys some of you drink them the one you know that drink that's got the devil's pitchfork on it oh monster yeah that's right i when i see it i just see it's like oh there's there's the devil's pitch for it oh sorry i said that out loud maybe it'll cause some of you to give up your caffeine and sugar and if you don't i still love you as though that would matter so it's christ expressing himself in the individual that's right whether he's intellectual or whether he's doesn't know his abcs don't you like it god covered all bases right there amen some of you are over here intellectual and me and a few are over here on the other side don't know our abcs he don't know his abcs half the apostles didn't know it that's right but they knowed christ that's right they'd never taken heed to peter and john knowing that they had been out of some seminary they said they'd taken heed and noticed that they had been with christ and when they healed the lame man see at the gate they know that they had been with christ the new birth amen it's christ it amen that's right you say but i i'm always wondering do i really have the new birth do i have the holy ghost get into christ yes sir don't hold it out here is some magical thing that we're gonna we're gonna you know try and achieve or do it's christ it's that simple this is the whole mystery this is why it's stunning when people would say the seventh seal is not open when the prophet of god showed us clearly that the seventh seal was the whole plan of redemption so no you ain't got redemption what are we doing here then if we don't have redemption why is there a desire a craving a fire burning in our souls to just have and hope the lord right amen just as a marriage vow to have and to hold and to cherish why is it we feel that way if redemption shut off why because it's turned salvation into a cold religious clinical event that's exactly right the new birth is christ amen now the very next section of this see i love it because there'll be many a person i can name some names if i felt inclined that don't believe they have the holy ghost and they come to church and they cry out and they cry out and they cry out for the holy ghost don't they don't realize that's christ in them that's right that's christ in them that's the desire of their heart but because maybe somebody's taught them that they had to have a sensation they had to have a a little something i'm lost oh right there okay thank you new birth is christ is a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and god expressing it it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day hallelujah i'm going to make a statement please just accept it as a simple statement many of you struggle because you don't know your position the devil's got you over here in the weak and beggarly and god is wanting you to recognize that it never was you it can't be you because you can't do it because the bite of the serpent is stronger than your flesh but when you get in christ amen the serpent can bite you with doubts and fears and weaknesses and afflictions in the flesh and we can say praise the lord it doesn't matter anyhow i've come too far to quit now amen i'm gonna go i don't care what the flesh has and what the spirit says boohoo about i'm gonna keep moving in the word oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is oh i'm saying lord help us help us lord the devil is trying to bite us to keep us distracted trying to keep us saying whoa unto me if i can just overcome this thing in my flesh if i can just overcome this thing in my mind if i can overcome this emotion or this circumstance then i can press forward i want to tell you you've already overcome it you have been battered but you are victorious you have to reach out and take possession of your victory oh and when you take possession of your victory the devil's going to recognize people say well i i had a terrible sadie saturday well so did i my friday wasn't too good either neither was mine but i tell you what i did i got up saturday morning fix the things i should have fixed friday night and moved on because you see ain't no devil gonna hold me down hold me down hold me down ain't no devil gonna hold me down cause on my way to heaven amen hallelujah it's best sung when you got chairs you can climb up on top of but i'm telling you my brother and sister that's the truth of it but if you'd spend days weeks months and year looking back on your mistake the devil's like well he's weak enough i'll bite him again amen praise the lord look at that he put down his sword you know the one thing serpents don't like is swords and when you put down your sword the serpent says look i've got an opportunity bite him again and i'll bite him again and then i bit their best friend and i'll get them to help me bite them oh i just called you up because i care about you i love you so much you know you're in a cult and you know it everything's going to fall apart and they're going to prove one day that none of it was the word of god you need to come hang out with me no no i haven't found a church i can stand yet yeah they're all so watered down they're all so weak they're all so wimperly but praise the lord the message is the truth i have the truth and people are like my friend was always so much smarter than me they must be right because i failed here and i failed there i made this mistake and i sunday morning i didn't even didn't want to go to church my wife forced me to ask her why should i go she said because you're the preacher but when you get that group in harmony where revelation revelation lines up every where you turn i don't have to scrub out this or overlook this revelation comes together that revelation you know i want to i don't want to really try and change the prophet's words here but if you just give me liberty god expressing it through his word by the same actions right so what is it the same action is where the revelation is perfectly in harmony so the revelation being in harmony is one of the actions because if the revelation oh i've got a new revelation i was going to share that with you church i have a new revelation you'd be surprised how many people would say wow praise god some of you had already bolted the doors knocked off the hinges laying out in the parking lot because you're gone can i share my new revelation my new revelation is really an old revelation but it was new this morning about 3 a.m my revelation is i need more of jesus i need more of jesus god's speaking to me at 3 a.m fall you need more buddy amen don't stop where you're at keep going keep going hallelujah keep going what will happen when paul knows where he belongs when paul knows his position paul's going in a rapture can somebody agree with me amen hallelujah hallelujah look at this now sister emmy brother sean would you come i hope you can understand what i'm going to say here they know they'd been with christ they had the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest that's right look at this now my brother and sister you say brother branham that that ain't oh yes it is too it's the truth did you notice paul never knew jesus physically amen paul never knew him the only way that paul knew him was by revelation by a vision is that right paul only knew jesus by the revelation amen just like peter did now i want to just place something in your heart before we're done today here's paul some say notably the most prolific and revelated of all of those men we're not here to argue each one fulfilled their position that's right that's exactly right peter knew christ stumble thank you peter thank you peter comes back to the word already been given the promise of the word that i'm going to build my church on you peter right some of you get all nervous on it but what i just said was true yeah it is yeah peter the revelated man of god the word was built on him peter brought the word laid the foundation of it and the church looked back to peter but not peter the man peter the word [Music] are you with me peter the word amen come on are you all with me [Music] peter the word now here's paul theologically trained never sees jesus but he knows theology of what the message says [Music] has an experience supernatural experience goes to a back side of the desert and out in the backside of the desert god starts dealing with him starts cutting away all these little ideas and ideologies and all the traditions of men cunning them away must have been nice for paul to be able to go on an oasis in the backside of the desert was it just as nice as it is when the holy spirit comes to you and starts cutting away amen but by revelation by revelation paul is able to come back and him and peter are preaching the same gospel [Music] come on we know we know it wasn't peter saints amen to those who think brother david and i was disagreeing it's just which avenue you come to this because when we look at peter the man it could never have been peter the man no more than it could be you the man or woman but it was a revelation of almighty god poured into peter and what did that do it displaced everything that was peter [Music] come on who's no longer you say why was peter they're preaching no it wasn't peter was the shell the earth and vessel peter only was the earth and vassal that the word i've got a quote at home i should have included it but i thought i'm going to be done by noon but look at this now paul comes starts preaching the word writes all of these books goes to all of these places lays all this foundation gives his life for that now fast forward in time prophet of god is discouraged go study it you'll find that when the prophet of god went beyond the curtain of time god was actually doing a move he might say to take away the discouragement from brother brian [Music] and he says would you like to see the other side and he said oh lord that would be so good [Music] translation people that don't like the message are like god don't do things like that really they don't read their bibles god does things like that brother brown is now standing there in the midst of the saints right we'll go into the whole thing here just very briefly though they're running these young beautiful women running hugging the prophet [Music] well that's contrary to what we believe that you see in that other element we have now left the flesh man behind [Music] holy spirit speaks to him and says oh you didn't recognize her no she was 91 i believe it was when you led her to the lord [Music] wow the prophet gives these words as it is when when you might say the interview is closing out it says i preached what paul preached [Music] and they said we're counting or we're standing on that praise the lord i'm gonna throw a fastball at you can i give you all something to fret over [Music] when the prophet of god said [Music] that i preached paul's gospel was he talking doctrine [Music] remember doctrine won't give you revelation but revelation will give you doctrine amen i just put this in your minds i'm not preaching doctrine i believe it could almost be called revelation brother branham standing there says i preached what paul preached i preached on water baptism i preached on this and i preached on this and i preached on this and i got this right and i got that right or was the prophet of god now you're going to say paul you're starting to interpret it i don't mean it that way or was the prophet of god saying [Music] i preached revelation i preached revelation and they already had caught the revelation and they could say we're counting we're standing on that because this revelation of jesus christ you notice there's way more way less i should say be the right words emphasis placed in scripture and doctrine than there is on being in the spirit having the holy ghost and having the revelation of jesus christ he doesn't say you know when seventh angel comes that he's going to fulfill all the doctrines look at that i i'm just wanting to stir up your prayer minds what was it revelation see we can have every doctrine right imagine our young people able so coached to be able to teach us elders serpency and baptism and godhead but no revelation who jesus christ is in their life [Music] oh saints we may be a little battered but we're victorious because the word said that he would reveal himself in this last hour and i for one believe he has i believe it's a finished word hallelujah hallelujah oh brother jason will you come help me let's stand saints you know i uh i literally forgive me and i'm not apologizing i'm trying to get over that complex too but i literally left so many thoughts on the desk because i was like yeah i better not preach any more than this my if i had given you the full meal deal you know i heard i heard this the other day it was so funny he says you have to wonder about someone who pays all the money to go to a buffet and only gets one little plate there is something wrong with that individual hallelujah anybody come hungry this morning well praise the lord let's buy bigger plates yeah praise the lord hallelujah it's good it's good my this him individual said you know i don't done his wife when they're in the car and he's groaning and his wife said well [Music] did you get enough and he said yeah i think i did and she says tell me what was it that was the best for you [Music] i i don't know she said that's right you ate a lot of nothing [Music] and his only response in his defense he says it tasted good but since we've come we've got a buffet a banquet table amen we've got everything that god desired not only does it taste good i don't know about you i think it you know what's tearing me down is this work the curse in the garden said you have to work and that's what's tearing me down because i tell you what when i feed on the word of god i just get built up i'm energized then monday comes but my brother and sister it's coming to the point i don't care what day it's going to be i've come i've eaten it's went down it's coming into our bones it's coming into our sinew it's into our muscles our tendons and it's there and the devil comes and says i'm going to slap you down on monday and as like go ahead slap me down on monday the wheel might fall off the tractor i don't care i'm the son of god hallelujah surely the presence of the lord is in this place well we can sing it now and my deal i did look it up try 561 see if it's the same amen nope amen that is brother jason's fault [Music] did i say that out loud i did amen he's trying to bring us into the 21st century's what his problem is amen let's just worship the lord for a few minutes before we leave surely the presence of the lord is in this place hallelujah no longer we're losing our connection to laodicea amen yeah you realize that oh so let me just i won't name any names but the celebrity chat lines ditched some hollywood guy because the words he said the other day they're increasingly suspicious that he might have become a christian first off you want to know why i was on a celebrity chat line it was a headline on another deal of another deal that i looked at but i'm trying to make a point to you [Music] look what they're talking about this whole hollywood celebrity might not be usable in hollywood any longer because he said something about jesus christ is lord and savior and that is unacceptable [Music] it's another day closer saints hallelujah hallelujah one more day closer they're denied him sister jerry and i look and pardon me just sister jerry and i was looking at a deal and these people are lamenting what is happening to our children what is happening to our education what is happening to our government and sister jerry is this coming along goes 1956 that's what happened 1956 they could have accepted christ they chose to reject him amen another sign we're that much closer hallelujah surely the presence of the lord is in this place i can feel his mighty power and his grace i can't hear the brush of angel's wings i see glory on each face [Music] surely the presence of the lord is in this place do you know my brother and sister i'm sorry i just for some of us here today this might be 1956. [Music] come a time that we can quote the message do all of these things but have we fully embraced it now remember the message is jesus christ [Music] brother david wednesday night maybe some people will be like what what was that what was that i'll tell you what it is because god's trying to get our attention time is coming real close you know what the world's saying all this stuff the some democrat saying well we need to be we need to be teaching our children something of substance you know in grade school like sex education and these different things and a person commented said well okay that's fine start with sodom and gomorrah [Music] prophet god said when they start coming for the oil when they start caring about the holy ghost being in their church and in their lives and in their schools he said it's not far off boy everything we see going around the saints it's not far off [Music] it's just it's a wreck we can blame joe if we want to my brother and sister but joe's anointed to do what joe is doing joe can't do any different [Music] we'll get a great man to fix it scripture covers that also they'll be crying for a great man but he won't be trump he'll be poked you know they're already creating a arbitration board and they're crying for the pope to take the head of it world problems we need to arbitrate it take it to the very spirit of antichrist o serpent o serpent what should i do there's a child's story about the snake telling the child oh just one little bite [Music] praise the lord we got the holy ghost because we're gonna shake that old serpent right off in the fire amen lucifer you have no power over the bride of christ hallelujah surely the presence of the lord is in this place i can feel his mighty power and i can hear the brush of angel's wings i see glory on each face surely the presence of the lord is in this place [Music] jesus is [Music] taste of glory i'm [Music] hallelujah i'm born of his spirit and washed in his blood
