[38:42] a beautiful thing
[38:44] sister heidi i just appreciate that
[38:47] i want to speak to you tonight once
[38:50] again just following along even though
[38:52] we've kind of stepped away from the book
[38:54] of proverbs
[38:55] uh the wisdom actually all of these
[38:58] things have a root back into the
[39:00] proverbs and so i just pray that you'll
[39:03] see this i want to speak to you tonight
[39:05] on kind of a
[39:07] i don't know how you say it i've got a
[39:09] title and a subject
[39:11] the title being the wisdom of the ages
[39:13] is the wisdom of our day amen so as we
[39:17] look at these things we can go back
[39:19] through the bible
[39:21] and we can find that everything that's
[39:23] happening today
[39:25] i'm not just saying once in a while i'm
[39:27] saying everything that's happening today
[39:30] has a type already in scripture and so
[39:33] by its being into the word of god right
[39:36] by us diving into the word
[39:38] and consuming it you will not be shocked
[39:41] by what is happening in the world today
[39:44] the scripture says that in the end time
[39:46] there'll be wars and rumors of wars and
[39:49] you look my brother and sister of what's
[39:51] happening around us
[39:53] and we see these problems happening all
[39:55] over the world but you know the world's
[39:58] just as much paralyzed
[40:01] of china is going to take over taiwan
[40:03] and china is going to go to africa and
[40:05] the russians are going to do this and
[40:07] and people are are consumed by these
[40:10] fears of these things and and i want to
[40:13] also tell you that can can you hold your
[40:15] bible up
[40:17] amen
[40:18] this bible that just told you
[40:21] that there's going to be pestilence and
[40:23] famine and wars and rumors of wars also
[40:26] said that he would surround his children
[40:29] with a wall of fire that they would be
[40:32] more standing with us than against us he
[40:35] also said in this same scripture that he
[40:37] would deliver us from our afflictions he
[40:40] would deliver us from our fears and that
[40:42] he has a house waiting for you and i now
[40:46] we're gonna choose what portion of this
[40:49] that we focus on
[40:52] what portion of this scripture
[40:54] captivates you
[40:57] well hallelujah i'm going to be
[40:58] captivated by i'm a chosen generation
[41:01] i'm going to be captivated by i'm filled
[41:03] with the holy ghost i'm going to be
[41:05] captivated by the presence of almighty
[41:08] god that he said this work i began in
[41:11] you i am going to finish
[41:14] amen
[41:15] we have a choice
[41:17] the wisdom of the ages is the wisdom of
[41:19] our day and i want to talk to you about
[41:21] it's all about the key amen so let's
[41:24] turn in our bibles as it were acts 7
[41:27] and 38 to start and why this is kind of
[41:30] a lengthy scripture i i didn't know
[41:32] where to to begin so much because it all
[41:35] just really speaks to me and we see
[41:38] these types that are happening in the
[41:40] day that we're living and by the way
[41:42] brother jason your text that you sent me
[41:45] i tried to get him to come
[41:47] but brother chad lamb is going to be
[41:49] preaching for brother rich
[41:51] at the end of september at their
[41:52] meetings if any of you can go i know
[41:55] that they'll be more than welcome uh to
[41:58] to attend we tried to get brother chad
[42:00] to come our way but
[42:01] he has
[42:02] a very tight schedule and so uh
[42:06] he said he'd be more than happy to come
[42:08] minister for us he says he knows a
[42:10] couple people in the church here
[42:13] uh has met them before
[42:15] amen and
[42:17] he was looking forward to coming and
[42:19] visiting and named some of them even by
[42:22] name imagine that
[42:23] so anyway i bring greetings to you from
[42:26] brother chad
[42:28] amen this is he
[42:31] that was in the church in the wilderness
[42:32] with the angel which spake to him in the
[42:35] mount sinai
[42:37] and with our fathers who received the
[42:39] lively oracles to give unto us
[42:42] not a dead oracle
[42:44] we'll touch on some things here in just
[42:46] in just a minute but you know it's it's
[42:50] not a dead word saints it's not
[42:52] something we're trying to pump life into
[42:55] it's alive
[42:59] whom our fathers would not obey
[43:01] but thrust him from them
[43:04] and in their hearts
[43:05] turn back again into egypt now i don't
[43:07] want to keep you standing but i just
[43:09] want to make an emphasis before we
[43:12] move on you see
[43:15] i don't think there was any of them
[43:16] crept out
[43:19] moved away from
[43:21] hid in the bushes while the caravan as
[43:24] it were passed them by and then turned
[43:26] back to egypt
[43:28] physically
[43:31] but they had turned back in their hearts
[43:34] that's what brought them to the middle
[43:36] as the scripture says the wilderness of
[43:39] sin
[43:40] and brought them into rebellion
[43:42] now you think about this saints you can
[43:44] devise the timeline and you can say well
[43:47] it wasn't very long but i want you to
[43:48] think about this in the whole picture of
[43:50] the journey into the promised land that
[43:52] they get into the journey see it's not
[43:55] at the very beginning they're now not
[43:57] under bondage right they've had a
[43:58] deliverance
[44:00] and they're now moving in the journey
[44:03] but their heart actually was where they
[44:04] came from
[44:08] if that doesn't fit the day that we're
[44:10] living in and what's happening in the
[44:11] world around us
[44:13] people are like well i want to serve god
[44:16] i don't want to go to hell
[44:18] but i sure enjoyed
[44:20] whatever you can fill in the blank i
[44:23] sure enjoyed that
[44:25] and if it was legal
[44:28] if i could find a way to justify it
[44:31] i would go back to it
[44:33] think about that
[44:40] saying unto aaron make us gods to go
[44:43] before us
[44:44] for as for this moses which brought us
[44:47] out of the land of egypt we want not
[44:51] what has become of him what happened he
[44:53] went up on the mountain he's in the
[44:54] presence of god
[44:56] and because they didn't have moses
[44:58] they're
[45:00] micromanaging their relationship with
[45:03] god
[45:05] is that the kind of pastor you would
[45:06] want
[45:07] is that the kind of prophet you would
[45:09] want
[45:10] the prophet of god said what god's
[45:12] looking for is rugged christians
[45:15] the ones that can as it were pass
[45:17] through the wilderness without someone
[45:19] saying don't don't don't don't don't
[45:25] but you see just a little while just a
[45:28] short season of moses on the mountain
[45:31] they're already saying we need some
[45:33] other gods we need to liven up
[45:35] everything we need another god we need
[45:37] to do
[45:44] and they made a calf in those days and
[45:46] offered sacrifice into the idol and
[45:49] rejoiced in the works of
[45:53] their own hands
[45:55] i'm a pretty good christian
[45:58] i do good things i give to salvation
[46:01] army i give to the red cross
[46:04] i donate time at the homeless shelter i
[46:07] do all these things all good
[46:09] all good things
[46:11] but not a works gospel
[46:16] now look at this
[46:19] they rejoice in the works of their own
[46:21] hands you see we can have and now lord
[46:24] willing we'll tie this together
[46:26] we can have worship that lacks
[46:29] sincerity
[46:31] we can have worship that is as it were
[46:34] a mechanical
[46:36] action it feels good doesn't it feel
[46:38] good come the house of god i mean i just
[46:40] the music before the service i'm back
[46:42] there almost you know another little
[46:44] something the lord gave me on my heart
[46:46] just a few words you know and i feel
[46:48] like coming out here and saying sister
[46:50] emmy play this certain song because i
[46:52] want to sing this
[46:57] oh it feels good
[47:01] but without true sincerity
[47:03] it's just an emotion it's just a feeling
[47:06] yay you took up the tabernacle of mola
[47:11] now we know who molok was right
[47:13] they sacrificed their children to them
[47:15] i'm telling you
[47:17] the god of moloch
[47:19] is alive
[47:22] and pardon me keeping you standing here
[47:24] but
[47:26] right in not our midst here i don't
[47:28] believe but right in our midst
[47:30] people are like well
[47:33] i know the message and we have all of
[47:35] these rules and we have this and we have
[47:37] that
[47:38] but i want my children
[47:40] i want my children to be able to decide
[47:43] for themselves
[47:45] so if my son
[47:47] feels like because he's not converted it
[47:50] doesn't have the holy ghost so if my son
[47:52] feels like
[47:53] piercing his ears in his nose i feel
[47:56] obligated to let him do that till he has
[47:58] his own experience
[48:06] instead of
[48:07] son here's the word
[48:10] and the word says
[48:12] we don't do this
[48:14] the word says we honor
[48:16] this tabernacle the word says
[48:18] but no no we need them to decide for
[48:21] themselves no i'm sorry i'm not like
[48:23] that weird old-fashioned guy
[48:25] that says you know what
[48:27] in my house you're gonna hear truth in
[48:29] my house we're gonna serve god as for me
[48:32] and my house we've rejected laodicea and
[48:35] the modern christian spirit
[48:39] and we're going to speak truth
[48:42] young people expect to hear me tell you
[48:43] truth
[48:45] i don't want to multiply you you might
[48:46] grow up and serve not serve god or serve
[48:49] him in a different fashion that's fine
[48:51] but at least somewhere in the echoes of
[48:53] your mind you'll have heard truth
[48:56] or we can just sacrifice our children to
[48:58] molech
[49:00] and the star of your god rimfun
[49:03] figures which he made to worship them
[49:05] and i will carry you away beyond babylon
[49:08] our fathers had the tabernacle of
[49:10] witness in the wilderness as he had
[49:12] appointed speaking unto moses that he
[49:14] should make it according to the fashion
[49:17] that he had seen which also our fathers
[49:19] that came after brought in with jesus
[49:22] into possession of the gentiles whom god
[49:25] drave out before the face of our fathers
[49:28] unto the days of david who found favor
[49:30] before god and desired to find a
[49:32] tabernacle for god the god of jacob but
[49:35] solomon built him a house and house
[49:38] howbeit the most high dwelleth not in
[49:41] temples made with hands as saith the
[49:43] prophet heaven is my throne and earth is
[49:46] my footstool what house will ye build me
[49:49] saith the lord or what is the place of
[49:52] my rest
[49:53] heavenly father we just ask you tonight
[49:56] lord as you just move in our midst lord
[49:59] i pray father that you would
[50:01] lord just come and
[50:04] be real before us lord
[50:06] now we know father that you will but
[50:08] lord we just have to present the
[50:10] atmosphere and i pray tonight lord that
[50:12] you would help us
[50:14] lord creating the atmosphere that you
[50:16] would come down and move in our midst
[50:18] and i pray father lord as as uh covet
[50:22] has run rampant around the world lord
[50:24] the pestilence of the end time
[50:26] now lord whether father we look at it as
[50:30] something that is to be fearful or
[50:32] whether we look at it as something that
[50:34] is already overcome
[50:36] what matters lord is that we continue to
[50:39] focus on you not letting the fears of
[50:42] this life not letting the cares of life
[50:44] this knowledge of this life lord be a
[50:46] hindrance to us but lord we ask thy will
[50:49] be done thy guiding hand be upon us
[50:52] tonight anoint us with your wisdom
[50:54] father that lord we can walk lord
[50:57] according to your ways we ask this in
[50:59] the name of jesus christ amen
[51:02] you may be seated
[51:04] now as you look at this my brother and
[51:05] sister
[51:06] i'll just try and move right along he
[51:08] says heaven is my throne and earth is my
[51:11] footstool what house will you build me
[51:13] saith the lord or what is the place of
[51:15] my rest and to me this is such an
[51:18] incredible question now i would
[51:20] encourage you tonight to personalize the
[51:23] question don't just look at it as a
[51:25] question in the scripture but
[51:27] personalize that amen that you would be
[51:30] able to say okay what kind of house what
[51:32] house will i build for the lord and we
[51:35] realize my brother and sister now you
[51:37] would look at this and take the word
[51:39] fabricate and that is to take and to
[51:42] build something now there's various uh
[51:44] offshoots of that definition psalm is to
[51:47] take ready-made things or some is to
[51:50] take and fabricate or build or mold or
[51:52] form to create something from scratch
[51:55] but we know my brother and sister that
[51:56] we're not doing something from scratch
[51:58] we are taking the very word of god that
[52:01] was placed in you and i before the
[52:03] foundation of the world now the prophet
[52:05] of god says it's just the water of the
[52:07] word that's coming down and touching the
[52:09] seed that's already in you so the water
[52:11] is what brings life to you so in this we
[52:14] know that it's by the word that we find
[52:16] life today and so we're looking and we
[52:20] have this question what kind of house do
[52:22] i want to build for the lord or maybe
[52:24] we'll put it out something that is
[52:26] actually happening what kind of house am
[52:29] i building for the lord so we can look
[52:32] at our own life and say you know what am
[52:34] i really sincerely coming and taking the
[52:38] word and applying it in its fullness to
[52:40] me see we can apply it in peace and
[52:42] portion and and come and fabricate as it
[52:45] were in a sense the house that we think
[52:47] god wants for us or we can then get
[52:50] sincere and get into the word and find
[52:52] the house that god has the blueprint
[52:55] that he has for your life and in that
[52:58] knowing that we're walking in the will
[52:59] of god we walk in complete confidence uh
[53:02] to be what god has called us to be and
[53:05] so what is the place of my rest you know
[53:08] it's always interesting and and i just
[53:10] take this from the days you know when my
[53:13] parents come into the message and and my
[53:15] mom and dad being you know good
[53:17] methodists at that time uh you know
[53:19] there was something of hunger in them
[53:21] they desired something more and you know
[53:24] they just kept going and as a small
[53:26] child at that time i got to travel with
[53:29] my mother to many meetings here across
[53:31] this valley of different evangelists
[53:33] different men and and you know it was
[53:36] there that when you get to see
[53:39] you get to see someone now this is uh
[53:42] the lord speaking here what is the place
[53:45] of my rest but i want you to see the
[53:47] reflection of his rest is you in rest
[53:50] amen it's when you come to that place
[53:53] where you can as it were let your hair
[53:55] down where you can come into a place of
[53:58] peace and and when christ comes into us
[54:00] and becomes we become that dwelling
[54:03] place and he is pleased to dwell in us
[54:06] and then that comes over and that
[54:08] atmosphere or that holy spirit moving
[54:11] upon us you'll see the change and the
[54:13] demeanor you'll see the change in the
[54:15] atmosphere around a person and so when
[54:18] the lord has come into his place of rest
[54:21] in your life it changes our whole
[54:24] outlook of what life is we're no longer
[54:26] worried about what is going on i have
[54:28] friends my brother and sister they they
[54:31] some christians some not whatever uh and
[54:34] and they are petrified of what is
[54:36] happening in our country right now but
[54:39] we look at it now i'm not comfortable
[54:41] with this myself but i look at this and
[54:43] realize according to the word this must
[54:46] come to pass so i say come quickly lord
[54:48] that means this all must come to
[54:50] fruition it all must come to pass but
[54:53] i'm still looking to the promise of his
[54:55] coming more than i'm looking to the
[54:58] chaos of the world that's bringing this
[55:00] about does that make sense to you amen
[55:03] so we have to just uh focus on this so
[55:06] uh how would we answer this question
[55:08] what kind of house are we building for
[55:11] the lord what what are we constructing
[55:13] are we sitting here tonight and i just
[55:15] speak in this general term are we
[55:17] sitting here tonight consumed with a
[55:20] fear or are we in a position where we
[55:24] are really
[55:26] not caring
[55:29] you see one's just as bad as the other
[55:32] one you're possessed by a fear of what
[55:34] is coming
[55:35] another one you simply don't care
[55:38] you see as christians you are concerned
[55:40] right and i would express the reason of
[55:42] this to say that is the scripture says
[55:45] and the prophet reiterates this we
[55:47] should be sighing and crying for the
[55:49] abominations in the cities we should be
[55:51] sighing and crying for the demise of a
[55:54] nation we should be sighing and crying
[55:57] for the ill that is befalling people as
[56:00] it would be in afghanistan in these
[56:01] countries and right here in our nation
[56:05] uh uh just uh atrocities as it were
[56:08] right here and so we shouldn't be in a
[56:10] place where we are fearful and we should
[56:12] not be in a place where we simply don't
[56:15] care but we should come and by applying
[56:18] this and just putting this before the
[56:20] lord and saying lord i cannot change
[56:23] this situation so i'll give it to you
[56:26] and i will trust you and then we always
[56:28] see amazing results can someone say amen
[56:30] to that we always see amazing results
[56:34] and and you know we look at this and and
[56:36] to take this question that is brought in
[56:39] verse 49 uh what kind of house will you
[56:42] build me now my brother and sister will
[56:44] see how that man with his carnal
[56:46] intellectual thinking
[56:48] uh has come through the ages sister
[56:51] jerry and i a few years ago privileged
[56:54] to to
[56:55] attend brother ivan sister nadia's
[56:57] wedding and then travel on up into
[57:00] europe
[57:01] ultimately going to belgium and
[57:03] preaching for a church there and
[57:05] visiting some old friends and we got to
[57:08] go into these cities like gint and i
[57:10] don't remember the name of some of the
[57:12] others and and cathedrals brother and
[57:14] sister churches that just boggle your
[57:16] mind you know 200 feet to the peak all
[57:20] stone and even my voice
[57:23] sounded good
[57:24] inside there
[57:27] sister jerry's like tone it down buddy
[57:29] and i'm in there oh me
[57:32] and it's just come out so perfect or at
[57:34] least i thought it was
[57:37] but you see this was the house
[57:40] they thought
[57:41] god had wanted them to build
[57:44] the great cathedrals it took
[57:47] thousands upon thousands of man-hours
[57:51] and great funds of the day to craft
[57:54] these great churches
[57:56] and so it was there they built these
[57:59] incredible cathedrals
[58:01] and they called them holy places
[58:04] now saints i'll just throw this in as a
[58:07] tidbit you know the prophet of god talks
[58:09] about being in rome and going through
[58:11] all those deals and seeing those
[58:12] monuments and how that they had been
[58:15] rubbed and touched so much they had to
[58:16] replace it they were hands wore off and
[58:19] feet wore off we actually literally
[58:21] there in some of those cathedrals in
[58:23] ghent
[58:24] we saw such a a great statue probably
[58:27] eight or ten feet tall uh well ten at
[58:30] least ten feet tall it was huge of the
[58:32] apostle paul
[58:34] and there was a little note there that
[58:35] you could make a donation because they
[58:37] was soon going to have to replace his
[58:39] feet for the like fifth or sixth time
[58:42] and and the toes were all disappeared
[58:44] and it was wore away and we got to
[58:46] witness a young woman come in and she
[58:48] put her money in the box and got a
[58:51] candle and the deal to light it and went
[58:53] over in front of this statue and placed
[58:56] her candle and lit it and started crying
[58:58] out i don't know what the language was
[59:00] for sure but she started crying out in
[59:04] great travail
[59:07] and this is what they thought god said
[59:10] build me a house
[59:12] they thought this is what it was all
[59:14] about
[59:18] so it was there they called them
[59:20] holy places but verse 48 says how be it
[59:22] the most high dwelleth not
[59:24] and temple made with hands as saith the
[59:27] prophet see he's not looking for that
[59:29] great big building and the prophet of
[59:31] god even indicted our generation in our
[59:34] nation of these people building these
[59:36] multi-million dollar churches when there
[59:39] would be these that across the nations
[59:41] in the other lands would would don't
[59:43] even have shoes and we had great
[59:45] cathedrals and and you know so you see
[59:48] my brother and sister that it's by the
[59:50] carnal intellect that we think that
[59:53] we're doing something great for god now
[59:55] my brother and sister the prophet of god
[59:57] even makes statements concerning that
[59:59] you know that that uh you know you you
[1:00:01] build you have a nice church to go
[1:00:03] through and take care of those things
[1:00:05] and and do that but you see we need to
[1:00:07] recognize it's not the size of the
[1:00:10] church that the man is in
[1:00:13] but it's the size of the god that's in
[1:00:14] the man
[1:00:16] see just a little bit of god my brother
[1:00:18] and sister will still yield results will
[1:00:20] it not come on we've all been there just
[1:00:22] a little bit of god will really
[1:00:24] bring a result but what happens when we
[1:00:26] get fully committed we just give
[1:00:28] ourselves to god we just lay it down on
[1:00:30] his feet and say lord thy will be done
[1:00:32] we see prayers answered we see lives
[1:00:34] change we see questions answered for us
[1:00:38] very personal things that no one could
[1:00:39] know but you and god
[1:00:43] and i don't say this concerning myself
[1:00:45] because i know this is much broader but
[1:00:47] we can see how there would be times that
[1:00:49] people would say you know what we we
[1:00:51] were talking about this in the car and
[1:00:54] we got to church and the the minister
[1:00:56] the pastor whatever preached on that or
[1:00:59] made reference to that almost as though
[1:01:01] there was a microphone in our car or in
[1:01:03] our house and there was my brother and
[1:01:05] sister and it's called the holy ghost
[1:01:07] amen and that's when god's trying to
[1:01:09] come down and confirm to you and i i'm
[1:01:12] in your midst i'm in the house
[1:01:14] amen it's not here that it's like well
[1:01:16] this only takes place when we're at
[1:01:18] church but my brother and sister he's
[1:01:20] not looking for the house built with the
[1:01:22] hands he's looking for that eternal home
[1:01:24] amen
[1:01:25] and so you look at that a little of god
[1:01:28] is good a lot of god is much better
[1:01:31] and that is what dictates the results
[1:01:33] can someone agree with me
[1:01:35] it's when we
[1:01:36] sincerely
[1:01:38] now you're going to hear me refer to the
[1:01:40] word sincerely tonight several times
[1:01:42] because there is a difference see even
[1:01:45] the commission that the angel spoke to
[1:01:48] the prophet if you
[1:01:50] will be
[1:01:51] sincere
[1:01:54] see he couldn't just come i've got a
[1:01:56] gift god's done this for me and i'm a
[1:01:57] prophet i'll just come and do this but
[1:01:59] you see he got results in direct
[1:02:02] proportion to the sincerity by which he
[1:02:06] manifested
[1:02:08] you say well brother paul what do you
[1:02:09] mean about that
[1:02:11] well let me give you this for an example
[1:02:15] the prophet of god under great stress
[1:02:17] the irs and all of these issues
[1:02:22] many checks wrote to his name
[1:02:25] and they were signed off
[1:02:27] and sometimes signed off and just given
[1:02:29] to someone else
[1:02:31] for a need
[1:02:32] the irs comes along and says you owe us
[1:02:34] all this money tremendous amount of
[1:02:36] money for the day when you think about
[1:02:37] it
[1:02:39] a hundred dollars in those days is the
[1:02:41] equivalent to 800 or so or more than 800
[1:02:44] today
[1:02:46] so when people gave thousands
[1:02:49] imagine
[1:02:51] the comparison
[1:02:54] and the stress is so great the phone
[1:02:55] rings and a prophet of god steps out the
[1:02:58] door
[1:02:59] and says tell them
[1:03:01] i'm not here
[1:03:04] see by technicality
[1:03:06] he told the truth
[1:03:09] but in reality
[1:03:11] he created a false narrative
[1:03:17] then he goes to pray for a baby
[1:03:23] god says i ain't answering your prayer
[1:03:25] until you take care of this
[1:03:28] you see my brother and sister god
[1:03:29] doesn't want us to live a half-hearted
[1:03:31] half in half out
[1:03:35] careless carefree
[1:03:37] he wants us to be sincere
[1:03:40] he wants us to care
[1:03:44] you ever noticed
[1:03:45] now i don't know this happens to you but
[1:03:46] it happens to me sometimes seems like i
[1:03:49] go through some of my greatest
[1:03:50] challenges and i feel just almost like
[1:03:53] lower than dirt and i'm just struggling
[1:03:55] to even believe i'm a son of god and
[1:03:58] then i should even be a pastor and then
[1:04:00] the phone rings and somebody wants
[1:04:02] prayer
[1:04:04] happens more than you imagine the devil
[1:04:06] he's looking and he says now if i can
[1:04:08] beat them down if i can beat them and
[1:04:10] get them in a position where they don't
[1:04:13] feel like they can i get them condemned
[1:04:16] they're not going to have any confidence
[1:04:19] and how could you pray a prayer
[1:04:21] sincerely
[1:04:24] if the only thing you can think of is
[1:04:25] your own mistakes
[1:04:28] isn't that clever of the devil
[1:04:30] i want to give him a little praise
[1:04:32] tonight he's so clever
[1:04:34] but what he doesn't know is sons and
[1:04:36] daughters of god
[1:04:37] are overcoming the complex
[1:04:40] sons and daughters of god are coming to
[1:04:42] the place that when the devil starts to
[1:04:44] rise up and batter them that they
[1:04:46] actually say you know what it really
[1:04:48] isn't about me lord forgive me for my
[1:04:50] weaknesses but it's not about me it's
[1:04:53] all about you and i'm standing here
[1:04:55] claiming the blood of jesus christ and
[1:04:57] so therefore satan you have battered at
[1:05:00] the wrong door because beyond this door
[1:05:02] is not me the man in the flesh it is the
[1:05:05] presence of almighty god and we can move
[1:05:07] into that
[1:05:08] because you see as we keep surrendering
[1:05:11] to god
[1:05:12] we get better and better if you
[1:05:14] determine that way
[1:05:16] greater results
[1:05:21] i thought i'd get an amen out of that
[1:05:25] now look here
[1:05:28] i don't know it seems like a lot of
[1:05:29] feedback brother alex
[1:05:31] um
[1:05:32] now look here and god's only provided
[1:05:34] place of worship
[1:05:36] now the place the thing i want to speak
[1:05:38] about this morning is that god has only
[1:05:41] one place that the worshiper can meet
[1:05:43] god only one place through the ages many
[1:05:46] have sought for this secret place of god
[1:05:48] through all the ages even job wanted to
[1:05:51] know where he lived out if i could only
[1:05:53] go to his house and knock at his door
[1:05:56] joe wanted to find god's dwelling place
[1:05:58] because there god and his family is
[1:06:00] worshiped together
[1:06:03] in there something inside of us just
[1:06:05] compels us i want to be in the presence
[1:06:07] of god there's nothing like walking in
[1:06:10] the presence of god and just that
[1:06:13] atmosphere and it's just so easy to just
[1:06:16] break out into praise and into song and
[1:06:19] find yourself where it won't you guys
[1:06:21] won't find yourself in a tractor but
[1:06:22] wherever it might be you'll find
[1:06:24] yourself there and there's just an
[1:06:26] atmosphere there and you know god is in
[1:06:28] the cab with you you know god is in the
[1:06:31] kitchen god is in the living room god's
[1:06:33] there at the washing machine or whatever
[1:06:35] it might be and he's there in the you
[1:06:38] know uh cutting hair or working on a
[1:06:41] house or whatever it might be saints and
[1:06:43] it's there that we realize you know what
[1:06:46] god's allowed us to come in the house
[1:06:49] but not just as visitors not just as
[1:06:52] spectators but as family
[1:06:55] and to enter into that and and find that
[1:06:59] now he says here like yesterday in the
[1:07:01] message yesterday morning we find out
[1:07:04] that there is a possibility of a person
[1:07:06] to worship god in vain with
[1:07:09] sincere worship
[1:07:12] you know these are not people my brother
[1:07:13] and sister that are just coming into
[1:07:15] church now we witnessed plenty of that
[1:07:17] in different places and different times
[1:07:20] when we used to travel the other way to
[1:07:22] church you would come into town off of
[1:07:24] 45 or or 12th avenue and you'd come down
[1:07:27] into town and on sunday mornings in the
[1:07:29] summertime we'd see the boats lined up
[1:07:31] in the church parking lot and people
[1:07:34] walking in and their shorts and their
[1:07:35] tank tops and their flip-flops i i don't
[1:07:38] know that i really would say that's
[1:07:40] sincere by our point of view right
[1:07:43] but in their heart
[1:07:45] they were sincere they didn't go
[1:07:46] straight to the lake they went to church
[1:07:47] first
[1:07:51] now we can kind of view that with a
[1:07:53] little humor right
[1:07:54] but there was something in them that
[1:07:56] said it's sunday we need to go to church
[1:08:00] and fortunately for them their preacher
[1:08:02] their pastor doesn't preach as long so
[1:08:04] they know that in 45 minutes they will
[1:08:06] be headed to the lake
[1:08:08] and so you look at that see we find out
[1:08:11] there's a possibility a per person to
[1:08:13] worship god in vain with sincere worship
[1:08:16] god has all these things fixed out for
[1:08:19] us but the thing of it is we have to
[1:08:21] search to find where they are you see
[1:08:24] the everyone my brother and sister has a
[1:08:26] king james bible or even the various uh
[1:08:29] uh uh
[1:08:30] translations of the bible they have that
[1:08:32] bible and they read it and i know people
[1:08:35] my brother and sister that are very
[1:08:37] sincere maybe even more so than us
[1:08:40] about these things but because god has
[1:08:42] not opened their eye can somebody say
[1:08:44] thank you lord for opening our eyes in
[1:08:46] our ears that they read the bible year
[1:08:49] after year and and it's there they have
[1:08:52] the same conclusion they go to the same
[1:08:54] bible classes they go to the same
[1:08:56] interpreting revelation classes and and
[1:08:59] they they go and and it leaves them
[1:09:01] right in the same position and i want
[1:09:03] you i want you to catch this because it
[1:09:05] can be a trap to us
[1:09:07] and by the preaching of the word it
[1:09:10] affirms what they believe
[1:09:13] is truth
[1:09:18] but that doesn't make it so
[1:09:21] you see what we hear over and over again
[1:09:23] does not make what we hear
[1:09:26] truth
[1:09:28] it's
[1:09:29] revelation
[1:09:30] of the word
[1:09:32] that reveals to us
[1:09:34] what this scripture is i was just doing
[1:09:36] a little studying just a side note i was
[1:09:38] doing a little studying along this line
[1:09:40] right here and my brother and sister
[1:09:42] you'll find uh you know like the phrase
[1:09:45] out of uh psalms i think i don't know 21
[1:09:48] 22 uh chapter 21 or 22 there uh you know
[1:09:52] it's talking about god uh inhabits uh
[1:09:55] the praise of israel and you know we've
[1:09:58] heard that phrase you know god inhabits
[1:10:00] the praise of his people and then you
[1:10:01] have all these theologian-type-minded
[1:10:03] people rising up saying you know what
[1:10:05] just say god inhabits the praise of his
[1:10:07] people is not scriptural
[1:10:13] and it isn't to take the interpretation
[1:10:15] from psalms
[1:10:19] but tell me
[1:10:21] what is the revelation of that
[1:10:27] when you draw nigh unto him he draws
[1:10:30] nigh unto you
[1:10:32] the prayers of the saints comes as a
[1:10:34] sweet odor before the throne of god
[1:10:39] you see we can get so theologically
[1:10:42] minded and analyzing things that we
[1:10:45] would say well i don't see this but i
[1:10:47] want to know not by the theological i
[1:10:50] want to know by the reality that when we
[1:10:52] sincerely come before god and we call
[1:10:54] upon his name he said when you call upon
[1:10:57] my name i will draw nigh to you
[1:11:00] i will come into your presence i will
[1:11:02] respond to you
[1:11:05] but you say see satan would like to
[1:11:07] bring it to a place that that we have to
[1:11:09] put it in a box
[1:11:12] brother brown says god has all these
[1:11:13] things fixed out for us but the thing of
[1:11:15] it is we have to search to find where
[1:11:18] they are
[1:11:19] and we concern
[1:11:21] search blindly my brother and sister
[1:11:24] intellectually is what i would call
[1:11:25] blindly
[1:11:27] and we will come with an intellectual
[1:11:29] revelation but to come to a place that
[1:11:31] we truly would take god at his word and
[1:11:34] he said i will lead you and guide you
[1:11:36] into all truth i want to know how many
[1:11:37] of you actually pray that prayer
[1:11:39] i hope everyone in this building prays
[1:11:42] that prayer right there lord lead me and
[1:11:45] guide me unto all truth not just
[1:11:48] stopping and saying lord let me see more
[1:11:50] of the message now look i'm not stepping
[1:11:53] away from the message as in maybe it's
[1:11:55] not the truth i'm telling you open up
[1:11:58] the sight the broadness of it all and
[1:12:00] say lord lead me and guide me unto all
[1:12:03] truth because my brother and sister we
[1:12:05] can get so focused so narrow that we
[1:12:08] would miss many things that god would
[1:12:10] like to reveal to us but we've closed
[1:12:12] the door to those things
[1:12:18] you see the prophet of god brother
[1:12:20] branham himself never claimed to bring
[1:12:23] every revelation of our day to us
[1:12:27] you know i read you the quote the other
[1:12:28] day about how that gods chose to use the
[1:12:30] bride
[1:12:32] to finish or complete the word for this
[1:12:34] age my brother and sister what is it
[1:12:36] some say well if brother branham didn't
[1:12:38] preach on it you have no right to preach
[1:12:40] on it i i preached a sermon as some
[1:12:42] services at a at a church and and i got
[1:12:45] done and and i i preached you know a a
[1:12:48] kind of a semi
[1:12:50] confrontational you know i don't like to
[1:12:52] call it confrontational because it was
[1:12:54] never intended that way and i had a man
[1:12:56] come up to me and and say um what right
[1:13:01] have you to preach that
[1:13:03] and i said sir i don't necessarily
[1:13:05] understand what you're saying
[1:13:06] he said i did a quick search
[1:13:09] and nowhere i want you to catch the
[1:13:11] saints
[1:13:12] nowhere did brother branham preach on
[1:13:15] that scripture
[1:13:20] so see in their mind
[1:13:22] because brother branham didn't preach on
[1:13:24] it
[1:13:25] we as sons and daughters of god have no
[1:13:28] right
[1:13:29] to go there you know what that's called
[1:13:31] denominational spirit
[1:13:33] we want to limit you you've got to stay
[1:13:36] inside our preset boundaries but i'm
[1:13:38] telling you what has happened the word
[1:13:40] of god the holy ghost amen the holy
[1:13:42] ghost has come down and anointed god's
[1:13:45] people and opened eyes and opened ears
[1:13:48] and opened hearts and all of a sudden we
[1:13:50] realized this scripture right here the
[1:13:51] prophet preached over and over and over
[1:13:53] and over again driving it home and he
[1:13:55] preached this over and over and over
[1:13:57] again driving it home and then we come
[1:14:00] under anointing of the holy spirit we
[1:14:02] realize the scriptures he didn't preach
[1:14:05] on
[1:14:06] are dovetailed
[1:14:07] right to this they're not a conflict
[1:14:09] they're not a different doctrine they're
[1:14:11] not leading us away they're not putting
[1:14:13] anything out but the prophet of god left
[1:14:15] here in his own word said that god left
[1:14:18] some of this work for you to do
[1:14:22] and he says search the scriptures
[1:14:25] oh man
[1:14:27] now he was speaking to them in these
[1:14:28] words in them you think you have eternal
[1:14:30] life
[1:14:32] but they speak of me
[1:14:35] and you my brother and sister do you
[1:14:36] catch this tonight you yes it speaks of
[1:14:39] him and you have caught the revelation
[1:14:42] of that word concerning you and him
[1:14:46] amen not a conflict a continuity a
[1:14:49] dovetailing a bringing about an
[1:14:51] extension of the full revelation of the
[1:14:54] word for our hour
[1:14:56] amen not some new doctrine dragging us
[1:14:59] off to the wilderness
[1:15:00] but a word confirming in the hearts of
[1:15:03] sons and daughters of god that we are on
[1:15:05] the right path and the truth is now
[1:15:08] being revealed open up because the word
[1:15:10] says that all the mystery now i'm
[1:15:12] paraphrasing this but all the mystery of
[1:15:14] christ will be revealed
[1:15:16] now does that mean that we will know
[1:15:18] christ in his entirety never in a
[1:15:21] zillion years
[1:15:24] but we're not going to go out of this
[1:15:25] world
[1:15:26] blindly in confusion of who we are
[1:15:29] and who he is
[1:15:34] god fixed them for us i like that
[1:15:35] actually because see you can look at
[1:15:36] that in several ways some people say
[1:15:38] well there's a very guideline by which
[1:15:40] you have to do this but you see my
[1:15:42] brother and sister i kind of like to
[1:15:44] look at that quote and think you know
[1:15:45] what god knew that i would come
[1:15:46] stumbling along hey man it is old paul
[1:15:49] just stumble along reading something not
[1:15:51] understanding going on and just can't
[1:15:52] leave it alone keep coming back somebody
[1:15:54] says oh i read the bible last year well
[1:15:56] i made it out of the book of timothy
[1:15:58] [Music]
[1:16:01] because i couldn't leave it
[1:16:03] because every time i got to the end of
[1:16:05] it i was like go back and read it again
[1:16:06] paul you missed something
[1:16:08] and that's how i spent the year going
[1:16:09] back to the beginning and reading it
[1:16:11] again
[1:16:12] you see because god fixed it for us my
[1:16:14] brother and sister and when we recognize
[1:16:16] that whatever the confusion of this
[1:16:18] world do you ever sometimes just feel
[1:16:20] like your mind is just like
[1:16:22] too many things
[1:16:25] yeah
[1:16:26] that's me most days
[1:16:29] you know 40 phone calls a day and 38 of
[1:16:32] them because my car warranty is out
[1:16:36] you know that's the kind of thing that
[1:16:38] satan wants to distract you
[1:16:40] but the thing of it is we have to search
[1:16:41] to find where they're at and god put in
[1:16:43] you a desire to search for that
[1:16:45] paul told timothy to search
[1:16:48] and to be in season and out of season
[1:16:50] ready to give a word or hope that was
[1:16:53] within him amen now look at this my
[1:16:55] brother and sister now all these things
[1:16:58] are in there and we find sometimes i
[1:16:59] like to just come to shreveport where we
[1:17:02] just have about two or three weeks just
[1:17:03] to take 30 minutes a night
[1:17:06] and just on a teaching see just stay
[1:17:08] right in the word these secret passages
[1:17:11] and see where we could find out just how
[1:17:14] to get in
[1:17:17] now we know the prophet never did this
[1:17:19] right but he was expressing to them
[1:17:22] there is a teaching
[1:17:24] i hope you don't mind some people say
[1:17:25] you're reading between lines but i can
[1:17:27] also show you where i'm supposed to amen
[1:17:30] so i want to be faithful and pray over
[1:17:32] it not just randomly but you see the
[1:17:34] prophet of god is saying i want to come
[1:17:38] and i want to i want to take time and
[1:17:40] just show you
[1:17:42] how to get in
[1:17:45] well i don't know the lord is good to us
[1:17:47] i had to run to the truck stop today and
[1:17:49] buy an antenna for a truck
[1:17:51] and i wanted a certain one and had to
[1:17:53] just go to the flying j and caldwell to
[1:17:55] get it and hanging almost right next to
[1:17:59] i thought it was really paradoxical
[1:18:01] hanging right next to the antennas
[1:18:04] is like a 12 or 15 or something piece
[1:18:07] kit
[1:18:08] to open any car
[1:18:12] i was like wow i can go to the truck
[1:18:13] stop and
[1:18:15] become a carjacker
[1:18:20] but it struck me
[1:18:22] what struck me saints is
[1:18:24] god has given you an eye i hope you
[1:18:26] catch us he has given you an eye
[1:18:29] everything we need to go into the word
[1:18:32] and where others can't get in god said i
[1:18:35] give you the ability to go in and open
[1:18:39] up the word of god and get inside the
[1:18:42] promise get inside the revelation get
[1:18:44] inside the word for the hour
[1:18:48] amen we're not locked out god's given us
[1:18:50] he gave us this ability to go to the
[1:18:54] word and to pray over it and then the
[1:18:57] door opens and we see the word and how
[1:19:00] it comes together and other people i was
[1:19:02] just talking to a man actually the
[1:19:04] school teacher to me brother jason would
[1:19:06] know uh the little feedlot rob waters
[1:19:09] that we oh and and rob is a was a
[1:19:11] teacher when i was just in the seventh
[1:19:13] and eighth grade and a christian man and
[1:19:16] we just had this long lengthy
[1:19:17] conversation started out talking
[1:19:19] business and ended up talking about the
[1:19:21] things of god and you know you put
[1:19:23] little things out and and you know it
[1:19:26] you just realize they
[1:19:28] they don't see it
[1:19:30] you try and hint a little more
[1:19:33] and they
[1:19:34] they don't see it and they're not even
[1:19:36] picked in their interest to say what are
[1:19:38] you trying to tell me
[1:19:39] they just go over and go yeah yeah
[1:19:42] there's all kinds of things in the bible
[1:19:45] but we don't know what they are for the
[1:19:46] day
[1:19:48] well i can't tell you what's coming
[1:19:49] tomorrow
[1:19:51] as far as the carnal world is concerned
[1:19:54] but i can tell you what god will be
[1:19:55] doing to the bride tomorrow
[1:19:58] he'll be wooing her
[1:20:00] he'll be drawing her closer i don't want
[1:20:02] to get too mushy or romantic but he'll
[1:20:04] be slipping his arms
[1:20:07] around her and he'll be loving her he'll
[1:20:10] be telling her you are mine
[1:20:12] and i am your beloved
[1:20:15] oh hallelujah my brother and sister can
[1:20:17] you see now he says look at this you
[1:20:19] just watch you follow god's direction
[1:20:21] there's only one key oh i got too far
[1:20:24] here
[1:20:25] take 30 minutes a night just teaches
[1:20:26] stay right in the word these secret
[1:20:28] passages see where we could find out
[1:20:31] just how to get in and you just watch
[1:20:33] you follow god's direction there's only
[1:20:36] one key to each door that's right no
[1:20:39] other key no matter how much it looks
[1:20:42] like it
[1:20:44] god has no skeleton key
[1:20:46] we understand what skeleton key is
[1:20:48] that's one that opens every lock
[1:20:50] any lock doesn't matter what it is
[1:20:53] he's got no skeleton t just one key and
[1:20:56] now you've got to have that key or the
[1:20:58] door won't unlock no matter how
[1:21:01] sincere you are
[1:21:03] you still can't unlock
[1:21:05] that door
[1:21:06] i tell you what saints i don't mean to
[1:21:07] be bossy tonight but somebody i'll lift
[1:21:09] the hand and say thank you lord for
[1:21:10] revelation
[1:21:12] thank you lord for for being so kind and
[1:21:14] so loving lord to let me see you not
[1:21:17] just as a god out in the galaxy
[1:21:19] somewhere but to see you as a real
[1:21:21] living god living right here in my
[1:21:23] presence in fact living in me
[1:21:26] amen this tabernacle not made with hands
[1:21:29] amen god didn't come down he didn't want
[1:21:31] to rest in some holy building as it were
[1:21:34] he wanted to be in you and i amen
[1:21:37] hallelujah now you see
[1:21:39] the word sincere now you go into webster
[1:21:42] and all these different dictionaries and
[1:21:43] they have slightly different variations
[1:21:45] of it but i want to just draw out these
[1:21:47] two main key words that come with uh
[1:21:50] uh the definition of sincere and that is
[1:21:52] genuine and truthful
[1:21:55] now if we look at the face value of
[1:21:57] sincerity my brother and sister you'll
[1:21:59] find this and i pray god never allows me
[1:22:01] to to be that way and i never come
[1:22:04] across that way to you but you see the
[1:22:06] words can be spoken will be
[1:22:08] true
[1:22:10] but without
[1:22:12] sincerity
[1:22:14] the real depth or life of the words
[1:22:18] will never take effect or never have an
[1:22:20] impact upon you
[1:22:22] are you with me
[1:22:24] we can like a historian
[1:22:27] talk about god
[1:22:29] but you see i don't want a god of
[1:22:30] history do you
[1:22:31] i want a god that's real right here i
[1:22:33] want to talk about a word that has come
[1:22:35] down in our hour a life-changing
[1:22:38] life-giving word that is here today and
[1:22:41] i want to because of what god would do
[1:22:43] in my own life i want to be able to
[1:22:45] preach it to you express it to you
[1:22:47] remind you stir up your pure minds and
[1:22:49] remember in sincerity
[1:22:51] because you know one thing i've learned
[1:22:53] these young people
[1:22:55] right here all these young sisters
[1:22:57] brothers
[1:22:59] they've got a sincerity detector
[1:23:03] i mean i i think maybe even more so than
[1:23:06] any generation
[1:23:08] they have a sincerity detector
[1:23:10] and
[1:23:12] they just recognize that these are just
[1:23:13] words
[1:23:15] or whether this is true
[1:23:18] now i like to play games with my own
[1:23:20] granddaughter
[1:23:21] and i'll tell her just some just crazy
[1:23:24] little story
[1:23:26] sometimes
[1:23:28] i can get it so right she'll go
[1:23:31] grandpa's that true
[1:23:36] but most the time because i'm just
[1:23:38] having fun with my granddaughter
[1:23:40] she'll just be like
[1:23:43] now my brother and sister if we're
[1:23:45] preaching about an overcoming life we're
[1:23:47] preaching about being filled with the
[1:23:48] holy ghost walking so close to god that
[1:23:51] satan can't get in the car with us and
[1:23:54] then people walk out of church and say
[1:23:56] you think the preacher was
[1:23:58] telling the truth
[1:24:00] you see we've missed the sincerity
[1:24:01] factor we've missed the point where
[1:24:03] people actually think they can live an
[1:24:05] overcoming life in this day that we're
[1:24:07] living in and when that is missing then
[1:24:10] our young people will just view churches
[1:24:12] and just another activity like going to
[1:24:14] school or going to the park or going to
[1:24:16] the pizza parlor
[1:24:18] but if we can ever
[1:24:20] reach a point in sincerity that they
[1:24:22] look and say you know what i see in mom
[1:24:26] i see in dad
[1:24:28] i see god is real i see that they're not
[1:24:31] just talking stories this is real
[1:24:34] and in that my brother and sister you
[1:24:36] see then they start to catch the key
[1:24:39] that they themselves can trust god and
[1:24:40] they themselves can act upon the word of
[1:24:43] god and god will do the same for them
[1:24:46] but you see it has to be in sincerity if
[1:24:48] it lacks sincerity it will never be
[1:24:50] effective
[1:24:52] now
[1:24:56] the words can be true but lack sincerity
[1:24:58] but the impact of one who is genuine
[1:25:00] can you right now off the top of your
[1:25:02] mind
[1:25:04] think of someone who's impacted your
[1:25:05] life that was genuine
[1:25:10] shouldn't be too hard there's surely i
[1:25:13] would pray be someone that you literally
[1:25:15] could say you know what this guy was
[1:25:16] genuine he was he really and he had it
[1:25:19] this person wouldn't have to be a guy
[1:25:21] but i had an impact on my life they were
[1:25:23] sincere they were genuine and they had
[1:25:25] an impact
[1:25:27] now you look at that and you know take
[1:25:30] that in any form you want that wouldn't
[1:25:31] necessarily even have to for example be
[1:25:33] a christian but we'd prefer it to be
[1:25:36] now see
[1:25:37] when one is genuine and truthful and as
[1:25:40] anointed
[1:25:41] the words that they preach have an
[1:25:42] impact on us
[1:25:44] when the scripture says train up a child
[1:25:47] my brother and sister
[1:25:49] and when they're older they won't depart
[1:25:50] from that
[1:25:51] that won't come from somebody preaching
[1:25:53] in sincerely to them now i won't come to
[1:25:55] somebody talking about there is a god it
[1:25:58] that will come from someone who has a
[1:26:01] genuine love a genuine experience
[1:26:04] changing the lives that's why we don't
[1:26:06] just let anyone uh uh you know teach
[1:26:09] sunday school you don't let strangers
[1:26:11] come in you don't hire a sunday school
[1:26:13] teacher out of some kind of deal out
[1:26:15] here you don't hire a song leader out of
[1:26:17] some kind of deal you don't put a piano
[1:26:19] player or musicians in just out of some
[1:26:21] kind of deal out here my brother and
[1:26:23] sister but you'll find in the world we
[1:26:25] live in that's coming more and more
[1:26:27] churches that hire their musicians
[1:26:34] well i wouldn't even go there reminds me
[1:26:37] of a church service i watched
[1:26:40] amen
[1:26:42] about halfway through the song service
[1:26:43] actually you know you guys if you could
[1:26:45] see it right now you'd probably find it
[1:26:46] humorous
[1:26:47] about halfway through the song service
[1:26:49] this thing that looked like a sheepdog
[1:26:51] over there on the drums
[1:26:53] decided about halfway through the song
[1:26:54] service that he was going to let
[1:26:55] everybody know he was there
[1:26:58] you know
[1:27:00] below it in the captions was this is
[1:27:02] what happens when you just hire somebody
[1:27:04] from a website
[1:27:06] yeah
[1:27:08] you see we want somebody who's truthful
[1:27:11] who's anointed
[1:27:12] and going to have an impact on us see we
[1:27:14] don't need a history lesson what we need
[1:27:16] is genuine words from genuine believers
[1:27:22] you realize
[1:27:23] as i shared with you the other day
[1:27:26] you're called to a ministry
[1:27:28] did you know saints that your words have
[1:27:29] an impact on me
[1:27:32] you say well paul you're you're the
[1:27:33] pastor you're the preacher no i'm
[1:27:35] telling you the truth
[1:27:37] your words
[1:27:38] have an impact not one of us here is
[1:27:41] exempt
[1:27:42] from being impacted by the words that
[1:27:44] are spoken to us
[1:27:46] oh god help us if the words are negative
[1:27:49] derogatory
[1:27:51] have fear
[1:27:52] and no faith
[1:27:54] what kind of impact we're doing
[1:27:56] you imagine
[1:27:59] now this is a very poor analogy but
[1:28:03] it would be just like
[1:28:04] coming in to church and speaking words
[1:28:08] and then just slapping everyone
[1:28:13] you say why do you say slapping them
[1:28:17] because
[1:28:18] every negative
[1:28:19] and fearful word
[1:28:22] would be destroying the relationship
[1:28:25] that person has been building with god
[1:28:29] somewhere along the line every one of
[1:28:32] those relationships has to be restored
[1:28:34] that's why young people if i could just
[1:28:36] speak my heart to you tonight don't look
[1:28:39] at the human side as much as you look at
[1:28:41] god because the human side will always
[1:28:44] have some kind of little failure i'm not
[1:28:46] talking about
[1:28:47] pastors and young youth leaders and what
[1:28:50] going in sinning i'm just talking about
[1:28:52] you'll see that we can sometimes say oh
[1:28:54] yeah we'll do that and then time doesn't
[1:28:56] allow or circumstances don't allow don't
[1:28:59] get caught up in that look to god
[1:29:02] look to the word of god and never place
[1:29:05] your trust in the man place your trust
[1:29:07] in the word and then have a little bit
[1:29:09] of grace for those around you if they
[1:29:12] say yes we'll go do pizza or we'll go
[1:29:14] here you know uh we'll we'll go to the
[1:29:16] park and it don't work out and just you
[1:29:19] have to understand these things it's
[1:29:21] never so fixed in that realm because
[1:29:23] we're to look to christ not to a person
[1:29:26] in their ability in their time but we'll
[1:29:28] come and find out that if over and over
[1:29:33] someone tells you we'll do this
[1:29:36] and it never happens
[1:29:39] reminds me of a brother one time
[1:29:42] they were doing some stuff around the
[1:29:44] yard somebody called him up
[1:29:46] and they said hey do you guys want to go
[1:29:47] over here and go to go to this sporting
[1:29:50] goods store
[1:29:51] and um and do this and this and and he
[1:29:54] said oh brothers
[1:29:57] i can't go and they're like why
[1:30:02] what and he goes well
[1:30:05] i told my son if he would edge the yard
[1:30:07] his boy was pretty little
[1:30:09] the weed eater was bigger than he is he
[1:30:11] said i told my son
[1:30:13] if he would ed yard
[1:30:15] with the weed eater
[1:30:17] and i told my daughter
[1:30:19] if she would take the lawn tractor
[1:30:21] with the the
[1:30:22] clipping sweep
[1:30:24] and would sweep the yard that i would
[1:30:26] take him to ice cream
[1:30:28] they said oh you can do that anytime
[1:30:33] and he said no
[1:30:35] i promise them
[1:30:37] they're in the pickup
[1:30:39] they're driving down the road to dairy
[1:30:41] queen
[1:30:42] and his nine-year-old boy
[1:30:46] says daddy yeah son
[1:30:52] thank you for loving me
[1:30:56] you see how the boy saw it
[1:30:58] he didn't see it as just ice cream he
[1:31:02] saw this
[1:31:03] as a mouth
[1:31:05] and he saw that daddy chose him
[1:31:08] over some other brothers in going to
[1:31:10] cabela's
[1:31:13] you see my brother and sister the
[1:31:14] sincerity now that man wasn't i don't
[1:31:17] believe
[1:31:18] i don't believe he was sitting there
[1:31:19] going i'm going to impress my son
[1:31:22] no i can't go
[1:31:24] i don't think so i think it was sincere
[1:31:26] from his heart i made a promise to my
[1:31:28] son
[1:31:29] made a promise to my daughter i'm going
[1:31:31] to fulfill that promise even though i
[1:31:33] want to go to cabela's and spend money i
[1:31:35] don't have
[1:31:39] did you see the sincerity of his
[1:31:40] commitment
[1:31:42] and his son at nine years old
[1:31:44] grasped that already
[1:31:46] and expressed it as daddy thank you for
[1:31:49] loving me
[1:31:51] not even hey dad you fulfilled our
[1:31:53] contract
[1:31:56] see i wasn't how he saw it he saw it as
[1:31:59] he's loving me
[1:32:00] he's loving me
[1:32:02] see we have to have
[1:32:05] sincerity
[1:32:07] now i want to just hurry along here it's
[1:32:09] time to close
[1:32:10] mighty god unveiled before us brother
[1:32:12] branham says i was reading a story some
[1:32:14] years ago and in this story it said a
[1:32:15] great noble king i forgot the name of
[1:32:17] him just now i wasn't thinking about
[1:32:19] speaking of the story it perhaps fiction
[1:32:22] but it leads to a point that gives us a
[1:32:24] background on what we want to say this
[1:32:27] king he was such a noble king and such a
[1:32:29] great lover
[1:32:30] of his subjects
[1:32:32] till one day before his guard and his
[1:32:34] royalty he said today you see me for
[1:32:36] your last time for many years
[1:32:39] and his garden is noble said to him good
[1:32:41] king why do you say that are you going
[1:32:43] to a foreign country somewhere to become
[1:32:46] an alien and he said no i'm
[1:32:48] staying
[1:32:49] right here well said i'm going out
[1:32:52] amongst my subjects i'm going to become
[1:32:54] a peasant
[1:32:56] i'm going to cut wood with the wood
[1:32:58] chopper i'm going to till the ground
[1:33:00] with the toiler i'm going to prune the
[1:33:02] vines with those who prune the vines i'm
[1:33:05] going to be one of them in order to get
[1:33:06] a better acquainted with what they're
[1:33:08] doing
[1:33:09] and i love them
[1:33:11] and i want to be more acquainted with
[1:33:13] them personally
[1:33:16] they won't know me
[1:33:18] but yet i want to be acquainted with
[1:33:19] them in that way
[1:33:20] and the next morning with his delegates
[1:33:22] and all these people seeing him or the
[1:33:24] ones that was in the palace take off his
[1:33:26] crown and lay it down upon the seat the
[1:33:28] throne and take his robe off and put on
[1:33:30] peasants clothes and walk out among
[1:33:33] common people now in that little story
[1:33:35] they find out then about god
[1:33:38] and they said to the king
[1:33:40] king we want you we love you
[1:33:42] we want you to remain king but he wanted
[1:33:44] to become one of them to know them
[1:33:46] better
[1:33:48] that they would know him better really
[1:33:50] what he was it would display to them
[1:33:52] what he really was
[1:33:54] and that's what god did he changed
[1:33:56] himself from being jehovah god to become
[1:33:58] one of us that he might suffer he might
[1:34:00] taste death he might know what the sting
[1:34:03] of death was to take the penalty of
[1:34:05] death upon himself
[1:34:06] he laid aside his crown in his robe
[1:34:09] and become one of us
[1:34:12] you see my brother and sister
[1:34:14] he made a promise
[1:34:17] and he was sincere about that and he
[1:34:19] said you know what i'm going to do what
[1:34:21] it takes to redeem you
[1:34:23] and he saw
[1:34:25] this whole story
[1:34:27] and he said this is what i'll do i'll
[1:34:28] come down
[1:34:30] and i'll walk
[1:34:34] the barbershop
[1:34:36] i'll walk
[1:34:38] and sit in the truck
[1:34:40] i'll go
[1:34:42] work at the hospital i'll go and work in
[1:34:44] the steel shop i'll go wherever it is
[1:34:46] that they're at
[1:34:48] and i will toil with them and i'll make
[1:34:51] myself known that i can know them and
[1:34:53] they would know me
[1:34:55] that's the kind of god i can serve my
[1:34:57] brother and sister not not a god far out
[1:34:59] beyond the galaxies always just a few
[1:35:02] million light years beyond the eagle
[1:35:04] nebula it's hard to relate to a god like
[1:35:06] that
[1:35:07] but when you can sit there and saints
[1:35:09] these things happen in my life i know
[1:35:11] they happen in your life you can be
[1:35:12] sitting there and in your heart burdened
[1:35:14] over something and praying about it and
[1:35:16] within just a few hours
[1:35:18] the solution the answer has come
[1:35:21] and you know that god is listening this
[1:35:23] is not chance
[1:35:24] look saints if this is chance let's just
[1:35:26] go to las vegas
[1:35:29] i'm sorry to say it that way but if it's
[1:35:31] just chance if we just have great odds
[1:35:33] to speak i'm a winner i'm a winner and
[1:35:35] go to vegas and be a winner
[1:35:37] no no this is a god
[1:35:40] who hears our prayers here's our cries
[1:35:42] because he knows my brother and sister
[1:35:44] not just in a figurative way but in a
[1:35:47] real way he knows us
[1:35:54] he dealt tense with the poor well let's
[1:35:56] go back up he laid aside his crown his
[1:35:58] robe become one of us washed feet with
[1:36:00] the lowly dwelt in tents with the poor
[1:36:02] slept in the woods and in the streets
[1:36:04] with those that were under privilege he
[1:36:06] became one of us that he might
[1:36:07] understand us better that we might
[1:36:09] understand him better now we're leading
[1:36:11] up to a thought here okay this is all
[1:36:13] just the part i just when i'm reading it
[1:36:15] i just couldn't cut it off i just i was
[1:36:17] like oh my this is beautiful thank you
[1:36:19] lord stir in my heart amen now i think
[1:36:22] in that we find out that changing
[1:36:25] himself what he did if you'll notice he
[1:36:27] cometh the name of three sons he come in
[1:36:30] the name of the son of man and the son
[1:36:32] of god and the son of david he come as
[1:36:35] the son of man now in ezekiel 2 3
[1:36:37] jehovah himself called ezekiel the
[1:36:39] prophet the son of man the son of man
[1:36:41] means a prophet he had come to he had
[1:36:44] come
[1:36:45] that way to fulfill deuteronomy 18 15
[1:36:48] which moses said the lord our god shall
[1:36:50] raise up among you a prophet likened
[1:36:53] unto me he never called himself the son
[1:36:56] of god he referred to himself the son of
[1:36:58] man because he had to come according to
[1:37:01] the scripture see now do you understand
[1:37:03] that
[1:37:04] amen
[1:37:05] he had to make those two pieces of torn
[1:37:08] paper the old testament prophecy and his
[1:37:10] own character to be exactly the same so
[1:37:12] he come the son of man come in that form
[1:37:16] then we find after his death burial and
[1:37:18] resurrection he come on the day of
[1:37:20] pentecost as the son of god
[1:37:23] the spirit in the form holy ghost what
[1:37:26] was he doing he was changing himself
[1:37:29] making himself known to his people in a
[1:37:31] different form like the holy spirit now
[1:37:34] i want you to catch this because there
[1:37:36] are some people we have dealt with and
[1:37:37] i'm just going to be blunt i'm tired of
[1:37:39] beating around bushes there's been
[1:37:40] people that have come and went in this
[1:37:42] church that actually said no you don't
[1:37:44] understand the godhead but it's right
[1:37:46] here saints like the holy spirit which
[1:37:50] is
[1:37:51] god
[1:37:53] it's not some other something it's not
[1:37:55] whatever the holy spirit is
[1:37:58] god
[1:38:00] and you say well brother paul that's
[1:38:03] elementary
[1:38:05] but that's because you have a revelation
[1:38:07] it obviously is not elementary to some
[1:38:10] people
[1:38:10] because they're saying no no no you're
[1:38:12] saying god and it's the holy
[1:38:14] ghost hmm
[1:38:17] well okay
[1:38:18] that's fine and i'm not mocking them but
[1:38:20] i'm just telling you saints there's
[1:38:21] spirits out there that will contest the
[1:38:23] word with you even though it's right
[1:38:25] here in front of them
[1:38:29] he come to deal through the church ages
[1:38:31] as son of god the holy spirit but in the
[1:38:33] millennium he comes as the son of david
[1:38:36] to sit on the throne of david king
[1:38:39] he was to take the throne of david he
[1:38:41] was on his the father's throne now and
[1:38:44] then he said he that overcometh will sit
[1:38:46] with me in my throne as i've overcome
[1:38:48] and said on my father's throne so he in
[1:38:51] the millennium he'll be son of david
[1:38:53] what is it the same god all the time
[1:38:56] just changing his mask i am to my wife a
[1:39:01] husband
[1:39:05] [Music]
[1:39:08] now here's i read all of that to get to
[1:39:10] my point
[1:39:12] because i thought that was beautiful
[1:39:16] did you notice
[1:39:17] the syrophoenician woman said
[1:39:20] now son of david
[1:39:22] have mercy
[1:39:25] he never even bothered him at all
[1:39:28] she had no rights
[1:39:30] to call him that
[1:39:32] see she had a key
[1:39:34] and she was trying to unlock something
[1:39:37] but it was the wrong key
[1:39:40] and you'll see that it appeared that our
[1:39:42] lord jesus was entirely indifferent to
[1:39:45] her
[1:39:46] and the reason we would feel like he was
[1:39:48] indifferent is because we're looking at
[1:39:50] this through our own human element i
[1:39:53] would never offend you i would never
[1:39:55] offend you i'd never offend you so even
[1:39:57] though you didn't call me correctly i'll
[1:39:59] answer you anyway
[1:40:00] god said no you have to have the right
[1:40:02] key
[1:40:04] and i am god and i change not so i can't
[1:40:06] go for generations and force you to have
[1:40:09] the right key and make a compromise here
[1:40:11] and then come back and make you have the
[1:40:13] right key again
[1:40:17] he said you'll have to have
[1:40:19] the correct key
[1:40:21] but have you noticed one thing
[1:40:23] the scripture says he will never forsake
[1:40:26] his own
[1:40:29] he'll never leave them begging bread
[1:40:33] so what does he do
[1:40:34] we in our human element say we'll
[1:40:36] compromise and let this be this way
[1:40:38] because we don't want
[1:40:39] what god do
[1:40:41] no i'll come and i'll anoint you to get
[1:40:43] the right key
[1:40:45] instead of compromising on the word
[1:40:47] instead of changing everything around
[1:40:49] making some special revelation or
[1:40:51] exception for the laodicean age god says
[1:40:53] no what i'll do is anoint my children in
[1:40:56] laodicea and i will lead them over here
[1:40:59] and i will by revelation give them the
[1:41:01] correct
[1:41:03] don't have to break the whole form of
[1:41:06] time and eternity to compromise for
[1:41:08] laodicea because it's such a horrible
[1:41:10] day no sir i will raise my people up and
[1:41:13] by revelation bring them and put the
[1:41:15] right key in their hand and anoint them
[1:41:18] to use the key
[1:41:19] and look what god did right here she had
[1:41:22] no claim on him as son of david he is
[1:41:25] he is the son of david to the jew now he
[1:41:28] come but when she called him
[1:41:31] lord
[1:41:36] there was no chasing her away
[1:41:39] there was no offending her
[1:41:42] there was no her saying i'll have you to
[1:41:44] know
[1:41:45] i've been in this message
[1:41:47] for 35 years
[1:41:49] no sir
[1:41:51] he anointed her
[1:41:53] to change her vocabulary
[1:41:55] he anointed her to change her approach
[1:41:57] to him she anointed her to come under
[1:42:01] that umbrella of the word and to fulfill
[1:42:03] the word according to the day that they
[1:42:05] were in
[1:42:08] and there she was anointed
[1:42:10] he was her lord
[1:42:12] then
[1:42:14] she got what she asked for
[1:42:17] now let me just put it this way as i
[1:42:18] would close
[1:42:20] amen
[1:42:34] when you come
[1:42:35] your declaration is
[1:42:37] i'm unworthy
[1:42:39] wrong key
[1:42:42] when you come
[1:42:44] and you speak all of these negative
[1:42:46] things remember the prophet of god said
[1:42:47] don't speak the devil's language
[1:42:50] you realize saints what the devil's
[1:42:51] trying to do he's trying to get you to
[1:42:53] take and put that key in there and
[1:42:55] rattle that thing and try and unlock it
[1:42:57] and try and unlock it and then we get
[1:42:59] discouraged because it's not unlocking
[1:43:01] the door is not open the power of the
[1:43:02] word is not coming being as it were
[1:43:05] dispensed upon us and and then we get
[1:43:07] discouraged and say god's not hearing my
[1:43:08] prayer i've heard that so many times
[1:43:10] saints people say god's not hearing my
[1:43:12] prayer but you're putting the wrong key
[1:43:14] in the lock
[1:43:16] and when you come oh i'm not worthy i'm
[1:43:18] not worthy the word says you're worthy
[1:43:20] the word says you're called the word
[1:43:22] says you're his wife
[1:43:24] oh my my brother and sister if he
[1:43:26] doesn't want us to approach him like a
[1:43:28] beggar he wants us to approach him like
[1:43:31] a wife
[1:43:32] now we can make all kinds of jokes and
[1:43:34] there's a little humor in my heart right
[1:43:35] here amen you never see my wife now look
[1:43:38] i say this just to make a point you're
[1:43:40] not going to see my wife coming
[1:43:42] begging
[1:43:43] she doesn't approach me that way
[1:43:45] she comes and says
[1:43:47] we need grocery money
[1:43:49] we need this we need that
[1:43:51] let's do this
[1:43:53] you know what's here
[1:43:54] i hope none of you brothers make your
[1:43:56] wife come honey
[1:43:58] the cupboards are bare
[1:44:00] the kids are starving their clothes are
[1:44:02] falling off because we're all so hungry
[1:44:03] please give me ten dollars
[1:44:05] no sir i think i know most you sisters
[1:44:08] you won't even talk to them you don't
[1:44:10] claim it
[1:44:14] come on
[1:44:15] are you following me tonight a little
[1:44:17] humor doesn't hurt us but but you know
[1:44:19] we're not to come as beggars the bride
[1:44:21] the wife look esther we've used that
[1:44:24] example before you so many times my
[1:44:26] brother and sister esther you go before
[1:44:28] him you go before him and if he don't
[1:44:30] receive you then esther you'll be
[1:44:32] banished to the back side of the deal
[1:44:34] and nothing but a concubine and you'll
[1:44:36] never see his face
[1:44:37] and i don't mean to be crass or crude
[1:44:39] but you'll never occupy his bed
[1:44:42] which is just a sign of intimacy
[1:44:45] you never have intimacy with him ever
[1:44:47] again
[1:44:51] that's a dire situation isn't it
[1:44:55] but i'm his wife
[1:44:57] i'm not just a queen
[1:44:59] i'm his wife
[1:45:01] and i have rights
[1:45:03] and i know where i stand
[1:45:06] i know where i stand when he calls me i
[1:45:09] come
[1:45:10] and when i have needs
[1:45:13] i also
[1:45:14] go before the throne
[1:45:16] you see my brother and sister what
[1:45:18] happens is is we have to
[1:45:20] approach it with the right key
[1:45:23] i can still i'm sorry i'm infatuated my
[1:45:26] mind esther is just this gorgeous girl
[1:45:29] and i don't mean it in a crass human
[1:45:31] form i just mean she had character she
[1:45:33] had all these things that would just be
[1:45:36] so desirable and i can see her she
[1:45:38] didn't come and lean on the post at the
[1:45:40] end of the deal there kind of flaunting
[1:45:43] herself like it is today i like this now
[1:45:45] some of you are probably guilty of this
[1:45:46] i'm not picking on you but don't you
[1:45:48] like it today so you get four or five
[1:45:50] young ladies
[1:45:51] because you don't see young men doing
[1:45:52] this young men have a whole different
[1:45:54] culture but you see four or five young
[1:45:57] ladies together and invariably one of
[1:45:59] them will be on the end and she'll be
[1:46:01] like
[1:46:04] i don't know what the deal is about the
[1:46:05] toe on the ground and the knee bent and
[1:46:09] i don't know what it is
[1:46:11] can you guys explain that to me
[1:46:15] but i want to balance this out i'll tell
[1:46:16] you what you'll see you'll see the young
[1:46:18] men invariably they'll be the one in the
[1:46:20] middle he's just there and everybody got
[1:46:21] their arms thrown over him and on one
[1:46:24] end or kind of next to one end will be
[1:46:26] the one guy over there
[1:46:30] everybody knows what he looks like
[1:46:33] everybody knows the real him
[1:46:36] but it's like i've got an image i've got
[1:46:38] to project
[1:46:39] and then 30 years later all these people
[1:46:42] will be gathered together and they'll
[1:46:43] pull this picture out and they'll go oh
[1:46:45] nobody says anything about the guy with
[1:46:46] the chubby
[1:46:47] tummy in the middle with all the arm
[1:46:49] straight around and they'll look down on
[1:46:50] the other
[1:46:52] look at him
[1:46:53] because he'll now be the fattest guy in
[1:46:55] the group
[1:47:00] but what is the key
[1:47:03] our correct approach
[1:47:05] to god
[1:47:06] not as beggars
[1:47:08] not as servants
[1:47:10] but as the bride
[1:47:12] of jesus christ
[1:47:14] there is our approach saints approach
[1:47:17] him with confidence
[1:47:18] not arrogance
[1:47:20] amen hallelujah you see because god
[1:47:24] it's not hiding somewhere in the galaxy
[1:47:26] sister emmy would you come god's not
[1:47:28] hiding off in the galaxy somewhere
[1:47:29] saints where's bride

[1:47:32] day we're the bride and you know what
[1:47:34] that makes him
[1:47:36] bridegroom
[1:47:38] amen i'm telling you you go look it up
[1:47:40] there's some lovely quotes brother
[1:47:41] brown's talking about the honeymoon he
[1:47:43] said at least they should still be on
[1:47:44] the honeymoon
[1:47:46] this bride should still be in her
[1:47:48] honeymoon she should still be so in love

[1:48:13] the sister nadia's shoulder
[1:48:16] [Music]
[1:48:19] and it's drilled in my memory

[1:48:23] now
[1:48:25] and insult her trying to do something
[1:48:27] sister nadia she has a protector
[1:48:32] got to protect her

[1:48:36] we're not here just people on this earth
[1:48:38] we have a bridegroom

[1:48:55] and sister that will let him
[1:48:57] you
[1:48:58] see i hate to admit this
[1:49:04] but sometimes
[1:49:06] it wouldn't hurt us men
[1:49:08] maybe
[1:49:09] read one of those
[1:49:11] romance books
[1:49:15] [Music]
[1:49:20] yeah all the young men back there are
[1:49:22] like whoa
[1:49:23] no no way
[1:49:26] well i'll tell you why i would say that
[1:49:29] because if we're not careful
[1:49:32] we lose
[1:49:34] the romance
[1:49:36] i'm not talking natural things
[1:49:39] i'm talking spiritually
[1:49:41] sometimes
[1:49:43] we lose the romance
[1:49:45] of just finding yourself sitting
[1:49:48] in your house in the car
[1:49:51] somewhere
[1:49:52] [Music]
[1:49:53] and just tell them i love you
[1:49:56] i love you so much
[1:49:59] i thank you lord for everything you've
[1:50:01] done for me
[1:50:02] lord you're so good to me you provide
[1:50:05] for me you see we lose that romance
[1:50:07] and we get cold and dispassionate
[1:50:11] almost like some marriages and it's just
[1:50:13] like
[1:50:14] yeah i love you
[1:50:17] come on saints
[1:50:19] this is
[1:50:20] a love affair
[1:50:23] let that be one of the keys that you
[1:50:25] approach god a soft heart a tender heart
[1:50:29] expressing from your heart lord
[1:50:31] it's not about i see the seals are open
[1:50:33] i see the church ages i see this chosen
[1:50:36] place of worship i see this and i see
[1:50:38] this
[1:50:38] [Music]
[1:50:41] but just simply to come to the place and
[1:50:43] put the key in i'm your wife

[1:50:48] i'm so thankful that you chose me of all
[1:50:51] the people you could choose lord you
[1:50:53] chose me
[1:50:55] and put the romance as it were back into
[1:50:58] our relationship with the lord

[1:51:03] brother brown talks about old cold
[1:51:06] dry
[1:51:08] confessions
[1:51:09] [Music]

[1:51:14] the point home to you
[1:51:16] [Music]
[1:51:18] a couple been married for many years
[1:51:21] one day the wife comes to her husband
[1:51:22] she says honey
[1:51:26] you never tell me anymore that you love
[1:51:27] me

[1:51:31] and he says well
[1:51:33] [Music]

[1:51:39] married and i guess if anything changes
[1:51:41] i'll let you know
[1:51:46] that's not our relationship with the
[1:51:48] lord
[1:51:50] that might be something that works in
[1:51:52] the world we live in today in a cold
[1:51:54] formal
[1:51:56] relationship with god but saints you're
[1:51:58] his bride
