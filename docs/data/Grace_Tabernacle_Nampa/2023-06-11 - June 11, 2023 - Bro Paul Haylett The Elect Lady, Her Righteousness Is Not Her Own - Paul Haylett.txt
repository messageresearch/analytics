this song I think you know I say that all the time oh this is my favorite song they're all my favorite songs but my mom used to sing this to me when I when I was young I remember saying this to me quite often and just strikes the chord within me every time you know teach me Lord to wait amen Teach Me Lord two ways [Music] you answer my queen enough to relax hold on but you waiting in an answer from you David Wayne on the Lord shall renew strength they shall Mount up with wings I see gold they shall run and not be weary they shall walk teach me Lord teach me Lords you away [Music] Teach Me

be they shall walk and not faint Teach Me Lord teach me Lord two ways Hallelujah aren't you Glenn amen patience is a virtue amen and God is gracious to us to be able you realize that when we first got saved we just thought it was just going to be a short little window God took away all of our problems we'd be able to just kind of walk right into heaven with no problem and then we woke up to reality that this is a fight amen and we are soldiers and we are not soldiers that are amateurs in the fight but God has made US soldiers of experience and you say well I don't really want that experience sister Jerry sent me a quote a couple days ago if I had my phone I'd read it to you and as brother Branham says you know that God would let your friends forsake you would let your church forsake you and he said this is the will of God to mold you amen oh my I tell you it's hard sometimes you say Lord aren't we molded enough but he knows amen The Potter Knows the Clay and I say thank you Lord for that amen that today we can just submit ourselves and say Lord what your will is is my desire amen hallelujah just a couple little things thank you brother Isaac Sister Sarah amen uh I just want to remind you remember our brother Manasseh amen kind of has taken up residence uh in Chicago and my flesh man says that we want to pray to get him to move but really what we should do is be praying that God's perfect will be manifested in his life amen not our will I don't see brother Trevor sister Kerry oh okay they went on a little trip okay okay and our sister April you know just um sister April spoke to me the other day she has a real desire you know there's some issues there in the hospital for labor for surgeons you know that's one of the things in life I say this a little bit humorous one of the things in life is when you're not very important there's lots of you but um you know they're putting quite a demand upon sister April to to fill in the gaps for for issues there in the hospital so remember her in prayer amen and um we're so happy uh brother Kim sister Hedy last night we had a lovely time of fellowship and um uh just a real Joy I want to say I really enjoyed that and uh brother Terry sister Shelly God bless you so good to see your smiling faces have you and the boys uh here and we just look forward uh Family Camp is going to be a wonderful time with the family amen and I just look forward to that I you know what maybe I was a little premature Sister Sarah where'd you go vika you get to be the fill-in I want to sing my God is an awesome God do you know the song no my God is an awesome God and He reigns what's that all miners I see some pretty old people here to be all minors amen okay well do we sing an acapella put that up brother Gideon my God is an awesome God I don't even know if that's the right words to it but I just feel led to sing that amen make a little declaration before we start our service today my brother and sister that little boy amen a little birth defect he doesn't know what faith is but we're the bride of Christ in fact It just strikes me because we're going to be preaching on that today the elect lady knows what faith is and she knows that if those around us are weak we don't step back and say oh too bad for them we bind our faith with them amen we're going to rebuke you Satan that you would take your hands from this little boy May the septic infection be taken away May healing come and if the Lord tarries may this young man rise up to be a great warrior for our Lord Jesus Christ amen because Satan my brother and sister the prophet shows us so clearly it comes a day that we have to exercise our faith and put Satan in his correct position if we give him a seat at the table you know my brother and sister do you guys ever fuss on the way to church now I see some of you you got a little smile on there but you're not nodding your head and you're certainly not going to lift your hand [Music] but do you know the reason that we fuss on the way to church is because we let the devil get in the car with us and we had him kicked out of the car before we ever came to church we wouldn't arrive at church walking in the door feeling like oh my how can I worship I just fought with the wife or I just fought with the husband or I felt like pulling over the side the road sister Jerry knew a family when she was young the dad had a great big paint stick stir stick and he'd drive down the road wouldn't he be paying attention where he's driving he just couldn't wait to correct those kids long enough he'd turn around just start wailing on them how about we do that to the devil amen let's not bring him to church let's not give him that opportunity to get us all stirred up right if our hearts are clear then we have confidence in God and I want to come to church with confidence amen listen stand and let's go into this my God is an awesome God hallelujah our God is an awesome God and He reigns from heaven above with wind some power and love our God is an awesome God oh who are gone is an awesome God and He reigns from heaven above with winds some power and love our God is enough now make it personal my God is an awesome God and He reigns from heaven above with wind with some power and love my God is an awesome God let's give some praise to the Lord Hallelujah Lord we're so thankful today Lord to raise our voices and declare to the world you are awesome you are awesome Lord our God is an awesome God hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus amen the Saints in Johannesburg desire your continued prayers amen that the Lord would just lead them and guide them sister Kathy a couple broken vertebrae I was just interacting with brother kobus her son-in-law and he said in the condition that it is right now that this will probably without God touching it will affect sister Kathy the rest of her life you know a little bit of limitations of those vertebrae that were broken my brother and sister I serve an awesome God I serve a god that is a Healer he said I'm a Healer and I believe him amen I have no reason to question and say now why wouldn't you what we need to do is come without hesitation amen without doubt and say my God's A Healer and not settlement amen so I just ask you to lift them up amen communicating with some of the brothers there and deacons and whatnot they're just pressing forward but they certainly need our prayers because life has changed and changed pretty drastic for the church so just lift them up amen I want to speak to you once again on things that are to be thank you sister amen our musicians and it lovely we have such talent in the church that God's raised up amen and we appreciate that talents that God has given amen things that are to be the prophet of God preached a lovely sermon on that and you know he didn't cover everything uh inclusive he he did not say now this is what you have to look forward to he just barely scratched the surface of it but my brother and sister one thing we have the promise of things that are to be is that whatever is written here is ours we don't have to say well you know we'll be able to make it without some of this coming to pass my brother and sister God ordained it he spoke it we just need to believe it amen I want to speak to you today on the thought the elect lady her righteousness is not her own amen and I'm glad to say that that we do not have righteousness of our own uh amen because that would rise and Wane it would be good seasons and yet every one of us if we would lift our handset I come to a dry season one time maybe you're in a dry season right now does that mean that your righteousness in Jesus Christ went away no sir no sir amen well how does a subject kind of a little bit I had so many titles I had almost a page scribbled out of titles that I put to this and I scratched that one out and I want this one I want that one I even resorted to asking sister Jerry what do you think amen we won't go there amen Romans the fourth chapter starting with the 13th verse very familiar scripture to us amen speaking of Abraham the promise that God had given my brother and sisters we look at this we realize that everything that was written in the Bible was for us the Bride of this day amen God didn't put a start in a stop God didn't put a season and say you know what my word is effective for this period of time and then it's no longer effective but this word fits our day and I trust that God would bless us today amen for the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made none affect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace that the end of the promise might be sure to all the seed all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickened the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were I'm here to tell you today Saints every one of us have things in our life which are not but we have been called to stand as they were Amen in other words don't sit down on the job because you see things in your life not matching amen believe that God has made you more than able amen hallelujah who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now was not written for his sake alone that was imputed to him but for us amen also hmm can we get an amen out of that thank you Lord but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification amen Heavenly Father Lord we come today just asking you Lord to take charge Lord take our thoughts and disfocus them Lord in the fashion you would desire open your word and make it living to us today Lord that we could leave the house of God today saying it truly was good to be in the house of God not not just a nice day but our hearts and our souls being able to just reach out and and take a halt of you father the word and and rejoice in your presence we ask you father for every need every prayer request spoken or unspoken for every situation of every family for every co-worker every friend Father whatever it might be we would ask you to come on the scene father for this is the hour that you said your word would come to life and be manifested before the world Lord as a blessing to the bride of Christ and as a judgment to the unbeliever now Lord we come to worship you today we come to hear your word and to say Amen father not to the preacher but to your word we thank you for that and ask your blessings now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated for something to last it needs a good foundation I don't want to deviate into this but we'll see sometimes that we we can't understand why people will be in the house of God for a season and then they'll wander or drift away and and we oftentimes say well maybe maybe they're an unbeliever but my brother and sister sometimes it was just simply the lack of good foundational teaching laying the foundation that they could build on now my brother and sister just a quick reference of scripture as we'll look anywhere you go in the world today you can find foundations that have been built on sand a type of the unbeliever he believed enough to build but not enough to last and you'll find that we have out our Direction a man wanted to build a house in a certain neighborhood and uh you know we knew what the land was like there and um uh you know he he bought the the piece of property spent a considerable sum of money uh and uh his plans were for a house with a full basement I think he's about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars pounding that hole in the Rock and he still does not have a basement but my brother and sister one thing the man does know his house is not going anywhere amen but it cost a great price and so we'll see that it is there that sometimes we have to pay a price to make sure the house is secure and it is exactly what it is that we desired to have built and Paul was anointed to lay this Foundation which to us is a solid rock of the word can we say amen and so it's there that as he was called to lay this Foundation Paul paid a price for that my brother and sister you read through the word Paul was pardon me putting it this way Paul was not a crybaby but yet you can see in the word you can catch the fact that there was a great price that Paul paid to lay this Foundation but God knew that Paul had in him the ability to not pay the price because Christ paid the price but to let the price flow through him amen so God does not bypass us and say I'm going to take care of this this is why our lord Jesus died on Calvary died as a blam before the foundation of the world but yet my brother and sister we come today and we are still sacrificing we are still laying our lives on the altar because as they say in the world you need a piece of Flesh in the game amen and God chose our flesh in this game and he made us able to pay the price that we must pay to achieve what he has already paid for us does that make sense amen so Paul was anointed to delay the foundation and when I say that I want you to catch this my brother and sister we are called and anointed to believe it and pay the price for our time for our day amen and does it cost us come on let's be honest it costs us it is not a cakewalk it costs us we make sacrifices and we fight battles and we struggle you know as much as the fellowship was beautiful last night I woke up about 4 15 4 20 this morning never went back to sleep so my brother and sister if I just stop for a little bit just don't worry I'm only taking a quick cat nap just to get enough energy to continue but I'm telling you my brother and sister when God wants to deal with you you will volunteer to pay the price we're not going to complain to God Lord you're charging too much you're asking too much but what we need to do is say Lord give me the ability to just stand up step forward pay the price without a doubt without a hesitation and this is what God has called and anointed us today is to be Believers now you know that term Believers has become so convoluted and watered down we have people of all shades and all flavors and all whatever different ideas and they say we're Believers my brother and sister I don't mean to sound derogatory but don't let that be how you judge it the prophet of God showed us quite clearly our life is our billboard amen not our words amen so let our life be the billboard of Jesus Christ amen and when we come and we stand upon this and recognize this is what God called me to be I don't need some kind of easy Bed of Roses what I need as to press forward and say Lord help me amen you called me Lord you've made the way for me I can do it amen it's a very very tricky fine line uh that you can come my brother and sister we were actually talking about this last night we've made it kind of a difficult thing for our young people we either browbeat them into the altar feeling guilty or we just throw it out and say well the God's in control just whatever will happen God help us to strike the balance amen of the fact that God called us to a life he didn't call us to quit on us and he didn't call us to quit on him but he said I am able to perform this work I have began in you amen this is what we need to instill in our young people is not that life gets tough you run but when life gets tough you go to the Lord and say Lord I cannot go any further and he is already on the scene amen he's not I'll be there in 30 days I'll be there 90 days but yet we get the idea when we don't see results for a period of time that God was not there no my brother and sister he's right on the scene and he is working on our behalf Can someone say amen for that and so as we take this we realize what God is asking us to do now this is out of order out of time I'm sorry so I'll probably repeat it but my brother and sister the prophet of God come and over and over again spoke to you and I and said only believe he made the song only believe a very Foundation of what we as Believers of the message would stand on he drove that home he planted that seed he watered that seed he weeded everything from around it and said what you've got to do is believe you don't need to be a scholar to teach it you don't need to have this and have that you just need to stand I don't need my name in lights I need to have faith enough to believe the word but it's not just having word to believe you have to act on it to make it come to pass you can Harbor in your heart reminds me of a Little Love Story Once this couple ended up getting married in their 50s this boy loved this girl so much but he never told herself and she loved him so much she said to the Lord if he doesn't ask me to marry him I will never get married because I cannot take the love I have and just go give it to another and about 50 years old they meet again and they're talking and they're remembering Good Times oh remember when we were young we were here remember when this happened remember our friends remember this and it just comes around it comes out of the man's mouth subconsciously he doesn't think about this and he said you know from those days I've always loved you and she looked at him and said then why didn't you tell me he said I didn't have the courage 30 Wasted Years 30 Wasted Years because someone didn't have courage enough to lift up hands and say I love you I love you Lord can't live without you I've got to have you amen we shouldn't be in the forcing business amen we should be in the manifesting business we should be showing that our Lord Jesus Christ is worthy of our love we should be showing that we can't live without him that we need him not laws and do's and don'ts my brother and sister that will never do it amen look I grew up in that era those of the church here you know I grew up in that era when it was a do and don't thing and it didn't work my brother and sister it did not work at all but by God's grace you can come back and realize that by God's grace if we can instill a foundation under the church it will weather the storm the church Falling In Love With Jesus amen maybe we'll sing that song at the end of this service amen it's the greatest thing we've ever done was fall in love with Jesus amen see we're just called We're anointed to believe Amen to declare this amen and when you take this in accordance to the scripture here it is counted to you as righteousness this elect lady now I almost included the quote but I read it a couple Services ago and I'm sure every one of you can just draw that right up but the prophet of God says we're not here to manufacture this we can't manufacture this because we can't help but put a human ingredient into it when we start to manufacture is we've got to just let God do it amen and when he comes on the scene and he starts to work amen you'll get to see as we were visiting you get to see sons and daughters that are away from God and it doesn't look good my brother and sister but when God comes on the scene amen he will change the picture amen we don't have to try to coerce or force or bribe or do whatever don't intimidate don't make them feel like oh you're going to go to hell if you don't line up right now why don't we get into a place that we can say Lord I'm on your side and you claim them I claim them the word claims them and it's going to happen I believe it Lord and God is imputing that as righteousness to the elect lady because she's standing there saying your word is true your word is true your word is true that's the truth that's the truth that's the truth and God says that's my elect lady that's my bride she knows that I'm here for her amen I'll tell you there's nothing like make a man work his fingers to the Bone than to have a wife and family that is there saying thank you thank you for what you're doing thank you for your labors thank you for your love but there's something will make a man turn and go away and become an idol uh a worthless man and that is when everything is a criticism everything is undermining everything is a deal and it will be now my brother and sister you'll take a relationship now excuse me I had this and notes I took it out of notes it just somehow just appeared again amen you know what the difference was between vashti and Esther there's there's a whole list we can make a whole list but we could make it real simple amen they were both women amen they were both wives they were both Queens but I want to cut this short here because I've gotten like a whole whole anyway what it was the real difference they occupied these same positions but vashti came into identity of her own and when she was no longer identified in her husband in the king of kings amen and she took on an identity of her own she took on a rebellious spirit and in her identity she thought that she was co-equal with the King and yet we see when Esther come that day and the scepter is held forth he give even to the half of my kingdom but let's understand to have half of the Kingdom doesn't mean that we step out of our position and our identity doesn't become our own identity because half of this place is mine our identity is still in our husband our identity is still in the king amen and when we stay in our right place look at the authority amen wives look at the authority as a wife not a doormat not a dish rag but a wife in subjection look at the authority the word gives you you have authority to the half of your family's Kingdom amen and you have great authority to exercise that and we as the bride of Christ staying subject to our King to our husband come and we've been given power over demons we've been given power over spirits of the age and the circumstance we've been given the authority to claim children to claim husbands claim one lives and step right into that position I don't want an identity of my own I want to be identified in Jesus Christ amen and God does not turn you and I into dish rags amen he actually is exalting us can someone say Amen our God is exalting the bride the elect Lady of this age he's lifting her up there's never been a wife like my wife there's not one so beautiful and so powerful as my wife and he's not putting her in an awkward position because she knows that when she speaks and she speaks correctly motive and objective that God will honor that I know these are silly but when we're in South Africa we were we were out in Kruger they took us for a lovely time out there and we had already seen the big five and you know there's people that go there we talked to a lady she said I've been coming here I don't remember the years now 15 years she'd never seen a a leopard she'd never seen the big five I think she said the most she'd seen was three in a trip not even the same day in a trip and we're there and and brother Gideon's taking us and and we see the big five and and we're thrilled but as we're driving along I don't want to sound ungrateful but I just want to tell you this is how mindful our God is of us we're driving along and in my thoughts I don't even say it out loud Lord you know I've always saw in all these uh National Geographic or whatever kind of things the leopard that's draped over the tree limb 20 feet off he's so relaxed you know his Tails hanging down all four feets hanging down his tongues hanging out the side of his mouth he's just ah and I was thinking Lord that is some of the coolest pictures I've ever seen I would love to see a leopard in a tree within 30 minutes we are looking at a leopard in a tree even to the point his tongue is hanging out of his mouth no no no that just sounds like that's that's nothing no I believe my brother and sister I believe that's a God who is mindful of our needs and we just need to have the expectation but if you have no expectation of God my brother and sister what are you waiting for him to do he's already satisfied you amen that was a good point I took home last night brother amen it's there our brother I'll give you a little Clarity our brother's talking about how when there's just one in this assembly and it could be this morning when there's just one that needs something more from the Lord he will not leave he's here saying is there something I can do for you is there something you need what is it you need and if there is just one he will not leave the building because he cares about the needs of our life to the smallest degree amen and when it becomes that real to us my brother and sister we're not going to flaunt it we're the life of the king we don't need to flaunt it we have already been called into a high order into a hot position oh Hallelujah now I just want to touch on this you know the scripture said they're fully persuaded amen now persuade is to call someone to do something by asking arguing or giving reason to call someone to believe something it can be used as a transitive verb Amen to move by an argument now that's no way to spread the gospel move it by an argument amen we can move it by entreaty but you see a minister can beg you service after service it won't change you get down with tears on our knees and beg you but it won't change but there is a persuasion that comes that God uses and I love this you know sometimes we have we have little stories in the message and if we're not careful they're just little stories in the message but you know the power of persuasion the world believes I'm interested I I like to sometimes sitting in the tractor I listen to these things you know and they have the Sandler Sales Training and they have different companies you know that are teaching salesmen and you'll have this and every once in a while it'll come real close to home amen there was a man that I grew up with amen and uh he used to make declarations he had quite a following and people would pay money to come to his seminars and um he would make the boast that I can sell anybody anything and I always thought that was very interesting in that boast but you see for him to sell anything to anybody they had to actually not believe in what he was selling because he's admitting he can just pick anything and sell it to you they had to believe in the man and so when they believed that the man was telling him you cannot live without this people would pay hundreds of dollars to sit there and then they would pay thousands of dollars to have his books and you know it was there with the idea of teaching these sales class classes that that uh you know it would be I'm gonna make you a super salesman but what they didn't realize is there is a sincerity meter that God built into humanity and in that sincerity meter you not are only buying into the product but you're buying into the individual and my brother and sister would sound like you're I'm talking about the preacher I'm not you have to to receive the benefit of eternal life you have to believe in Jesus Christ it's not just believing in Salvation it's not just believing in forgiveness of sin you'd say but that's what it is no my brother and sister you have to believe in Jesus Christ because he is so much more than salvation he is so much more than healing he is so much more than any one of these all put together it is the word but we have to believe in him and in that when you come to the place that you have belief in a person as a Salesman he would tell you honestly this is the best product than I've ever sold and I'm sorry I've been around the block a couple times not that long ago had a man I've known forever salesman changed jobs now he's working for this company and he come by the shop and he says Paul this is the best penetrating oil ever I said how far are you going to stand behind it we will stand behind it if it's no good what you're going to give me if it's no good well I don't want to give you anything then why should I try it well I'll replace the money no you're just wasting my time um you use this other product I'll give you some of that that you know works if this doesn't work well I played a little hard ball with him and he comes along and poor old feels like no you need to try this and I said if you believe in it that much then give it to me well the company don't like it doing it then Phil you buy it and give it to me and if it works I'll buy from you and in the end you'll make more than what the can of that's the best stuff you've ever seen you spray it on a rusty bolt and you can watch the rust melt and just drip off of there and you can just turn that nut or unthread that thing it's the most awesome stuff but you know he was so elated that I was interested in his product he totally forgot that I said I'd buy that Cannon so I got a free can but my brother and sister when we come down to it we have to come to the place if God says we believe it foreign we can't come and say what are you going to give me what are you going to make up for if this doesn't work if I go to church and church doesn't work for me what are you going to do for me no my brother and sister we have to come to the place that we believe him just as the young woman amen would come and a young man says I want to marry you I want to you to be my love my wife for the rest of my life my brother and sister she doesn't come along if she's really in love and she knows he's in love with her she doesn't say okay if this ends at five years what do you give me if it ends at 10 what do you do for me if it ends at 15 what's the deal if it ends here my brother and sister we don't come to God on conditions we come to God unconditional amen we come as Believers and we say Lord you said it I believe you Lord and He imputes righteousness to you my brother and sister because you believed him oh Hallelujah see this is much more than just all we're gonna try my brother and sister when you believe you do amen you don't try you do oh forgive me for being excited Hallelujah but you see the world wants to convince you of your need but God works in another fashion you can say well I preached such a strong sermon and that it really struck this and they realized they needed the Lord my brother my sister God's been dealing with him for so long you maybe house a catalyst to change that but you didn't put the need in them amen I'm telling you when you come and you're sitting here today and maybe you would say you know what um I I I I if you can talk me into this you know I'll serve God I'll do this but if I can talk you into it maybe tomorrow the next day somebody can talk you out of it amen but I'll tell you what we don't have to do if you're sitting here this morning and you're hungry I don't have to convince you you're hungry I don't have to come and say oh surely you're hungry you guys should be hungry the prophet said come to church hungry so surely because you believe the message you would be hungry if you are hungry you know you're hungry you don't need someone to convince you you're hungry what we do sometimes need is to be convinced that what we're eating is not the answer amen because I can't tell you how much I love Oreos amen Oreos are the best tasting chemicals you've ever touched in your life and I get near an Oreo we're walking through the store the other day and that was a deal you know the devil knows how to position it they never put the Oreos on sale beside the broccoli in the back corner of the store no sir the Oreo deal is right here with a cash register right there so that you get right there and you're like I love you Oreos Oreos I don't think I can live without you and I only have to walk five steps and whip a credit card out in your mind I don't even have time to think about it I don't have time to repent from it and the devil he likes to just put these things right there and convince you how much you need his chemical oh double stuff praise the Lord anybody want to come to our house tonight for a Oreo feast but when there's a deep calling God doesn't have to put everything in front of you that you stumble every day of your life stumble doesn't have to have you on the place and this this happens God knows how to do this there's a brother back East he works in a siding Factory and um you know he was a pretty rough character and he's working in this siding Factory and it turns out that there's a pastor of a small Message Church there that the church wasn't big enough to support him and the brother wanted his days to be able to be a pastor so he worked night shift in a siding Factory and so lo and behold this man Carlos Brother Carlos is here working and now Brother Carlos is this giant enormous man and he's working in this uh siding Factory and here is this like five foot five skinny as a rail take Brother David saw him off a little bit you know that kind of a guy oh did I say that um anyway uh and and he this Brother Carlos would look down on him and he would think thoughts like I could break him like a twig and this pastor Fearless they'd be working there Carlos yeah what you gonna do when you die they're going to bury me it's what they're going to do yeah but what happens after that I ain't thinking of it and he's working Carlos what the Bible says I don't want to hear it the chef Foreman comes over are you guys in an argument no sir Carlos is like leave me alone I will once you repent that'll work for everybody it worked on Carlos one day Carlos is like okay if you're so convinced this God's real I have something I'm thinking about and the brother says you can't just think about it you need to open your mouth not in public you need to open your mouth and say Lord if you're real Brother Carlos will tell you you've got to be careful the challenge you put to God when you say God if you are real because our God is real amen we serve an awesome God my brother and sister and Carlos it didn't take very long he come on a night shift and the foreman on the shift comes and it's like what's going on here because they're right there in front of a siding machine an extruder and he's down there on the floor crying out to God forgive me Lord and he said oh you forced me and he says you know I never forced you me arms like this you if you guys I won't give brother Carlos's last name but if you guys have ever met Brother Carlos he's got risks bigger than my arms he says just giant of a man and this brother looked at him and says Carlos just tell me the truth wasn't there something inside of you that's been crying out for years you can't make someone hungry but when the hunger is there the word says call on my name and I'll come I'll satisfy that hunger so you look at this my brother and sister now the prophet of God says I didn't bring the quote but brother Brown says that you know even from a child you've known that you were different can anyone say Amen to that we're just different now the world would like you to believe that you're the odd duck amen but my brother and sister the truth of it is it's that seed Gene of God that made you different and the world wants you to make them like that now you talk about the power of persuasion that the devil oh it's not the devil it's my best friend wants me to go have fun no I'm telling you it's the devil trying to get you to defile your body a temple of the Holy Ghost because there's not a temple on every corner my brother and sister you go to Israel you tour the country north and south and east and west there as much as that is considered a religious country there's not a temple on every corner amen and there's not a temple on every corner here in the earth now the city of Nampa has a church on almost every corner but my brother and sister those churches are not temples amen if Jesus was here today he would be sitting outside there plaiting the cords and he'd be getting ready to chase them out because they're claiming it's a house of God while he says they're den of Thieves I'm not preaching too stiff am I you see my brother and sister it comes to a place that we don't need to convince you you're hungry and that's how God works now let's go back to Romans 4 verse 18 who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken and so shall thy seed be so this word right here is declaring my brother and sister that you are going to believe in hope against all things it won't be anything Satan can put in front of you that will keep you from believing amen from having hope in the word of God now you can get real Technical and hope is not faith but hope is the flower bed that Faith grows from because if you have no hope you don't plant I'm a farmer I can tell you if you have no hope you don't plant amen you would just sit on your chair I remember years ago just throw this in real quick commodity prices were such there wasn't a crop that we had available to us that had any profit built in it and one of our neighbors he just went out there and a couple times during the summer almost the entirety of his farm he just dissed the weeds down and we're like what are you doing and he says well if I'm going to lose money I'm going to lose the least that I can amen and so we all planted crops and and in the end of the year is it's winding down uh fertilizer prices fuel prices everything had been just extremely high and we're winding down to the end of the year now this man is secure because he feels like because I did little I'll lose little but my brother and sister it got to be about October of that year and I literally had stacks of hay all over the place because I just kept saying I can't sell it that cheap I can't give this to someone and that's what it would come down to and at the end of the year got to be about October going into November woke up one day and corn Futures had tripled amen and corn suddenly was up here where it was extremely profitable and beans just went through the roof and Alfalfa Haye just went through the roof because places like Nevada and wherever had just dried up and it wasn't there and this man is there going oh if I had only oh if I had only my brother and sister if we had only but I'm not here to pursue or to try and persuade you if you had only I want you to just follow the hunger God has placed in your heart amen he didn't call the believer the elect lady to sit idle in laodicea he didn't call for us to find a safe place where we invest little and expect a little or none in return but he said I want you to go and the prophet put it in these beautiful words of this day keep planting your potatoes get out of bed in the morning read your Bible pray and go to work believing God is with you amen and when the circumstance changes and you have got up maybe in a moment you don't feel strong but your prayer oh can you catch this your prayer whether you pray it oh Lord or you pray it it has the same exact impact when it hits the Throne of God we don't have to scream it amen that's why you see many of these Pentecostal preachers I wouldn't want to went through the prayer line they might have healed my headache but I had to go see the chiropractor when they got done with me oh death Hall and they just shake them oh my brother and sister T.L Osborne go listen to it he's talking about that he said Satan I adore you didn't scream didn't jump didn't haul her didn't beat on them why because our Authority as the elect lady is not how loud our voice is amen it's our relationship with the King and look at Esther Esther comes they say Esther you do that they'll banish you you'll never see the King again my brother and sister you know this one my favorite little subject but it's there Esther coming to the Courtyard or the Fourier she didn't stop and say oh my I hope I live through this my brother and sister she said that's not a king that's my husband I'm not just a queen I'm his wife and there's our relationship is built not in just a title I'm a Christian I'm a Believer but it's built in this relationship we have as the elect Lady of Jesus Christ Can someone say Amen to that thank you Lord of the relationship amen and he says that's what your seed will be in verse 19 and being not weak in faith I'm going to hurry right along here because I want to finish this amen what was the original seed that was passed down spoken word God put it in a box and gave it to Abraham right no he didn't did he remember what the prophet of God talked about radio waves and all of that those voices the voice of George Washington whatever is still echoing through the heavens and if we had the ability we'd hear conversation that was spoken 200 years ago and God spoke those words to Abraham they didn't stop at Abraham and you're sitting here today hearing that's it those words you're hearing the very nature of Christ's coming being communicated out and something we don't even the antenna that we don't even see amen but is in US is catching the message of God from the Throne of God Amen we don't need to have some big stack of books and have all of these things my brother and sister God built an antenna into the elect lady where she is hearing the word of God not only the word of God but she is catching the mind of Christ amen it's not that you have to have everything spoken to you I I don't expect you to speak out or we won't interact too long on this but tell me have you not in your life had God speak to you and it come to pass in just a little while amen something the Lord said don't go there or don't be involved or listen or or they'll be they're trying to trick you or some kind of thing and it comes to pass what is that psychology no that is the mind of Christ the antenna that God put into the elect lady to catch the word of God that came from the Throne of God in the very beginning oh my goodness that's why we can sit right here today and we can be here and we can realize amen my flesh is telling me I'm weak the devil's telling me I'm weak but the word says my God says my king says my husband says I'm not weak in faith I'm not weak in faith how Hallelujah see this is not just a possibility this is a house man it's done now let's look for a moment are we doing okay amen let's look for a moment into a spiritual seed Gene only we're going to touch the the natural side first amen now we know what the prophet of God has said about hybrid and look at this my brother and sister I want to take this point and drive it home to you do you realize that all hybrids have what you call a regressive trait any of you biologists in here they have a regressive trait in other words I'll hope you catch this I'm just take a little liberty with times years dates Etc but you take a hybrid and you cross this male parent plant and this female parrot plant and you end up with a seed then you take that and you take that plant which now have very strong traits and you now cross-breed it with another plant and you end up with a seed and man's been messing around with this amen and that's why oh I hope I don't hurt nobody feelings uh y'all a bunch of hybrid because your great Grampy was this your grandma was French and then it was this and then it was that and then they met here and they met there and come and and uh you know our family I I wished I never got involved with this genealogy stuff I've been told since I was this high our family behaves this way because we're German so I just like accepted that Germans are stubborn hard-headed like to argue absolutely that's what Germans are and so I'm Justified sister Jerry's like come on please do this genealogy thing do ancestry ancestry you know there's so little German in me so little German in me I had to find a new excuse why I'm stubborn and hard-headed and I I would have been happy just to kept the old excuse then I realized maybe I am like I am because it's not about my genealogy but it's about something else amen we'll elect to have something to fall back on I'm gonna fall back on this you know it's this and it's that no my brother and sister we're the elect lady I want you to go ahead and trace your genealogy today your genealogy did not come out of the pits of hell your genealogy did not come from Cain your genealogy was not there in Sadducees and Pharisees your genealogy came from the very Throne of almighty God and we got to stop and start recognizing if I'm behaving and blaming it on something else I need to get down and repent and say Lord it is not an excuse that I'm looking for I'm looking for answers in my life I'm looking for deliverances in my life I'm looking to satisfy the hunger in my life now we figured out the the discrepancy you might say we had Scandinavian and English and whatever else but somehow or another they ended up living there in the Borderlands of Germany maybe they just took on the spirit and kept it the only spirit I really want to take on is the Holy Spirit I don't want it to just anoint My Flesh I want to keep it I want to live all the days of my life under that anointing but you see you come and we can say well they came from here they came from there this happened that happened and that's our excuse that's our reason my brother and sister just let me expound on this if we do that we have no hope let's just dismiss right now and go home because we are right here under the influence of Satan's Eden and if we're going to say it's because where I live where you live in laodicea so why don't we all start by going to the store and buy an ice cream and Oreos because we got no other hope but my lineage my lineage my Esther anointing says I am the wife I'm not just a queen I'm the wife of the king and as a wife when we took vows he said he'd never forsake me be put in the back of the concubine house over here never be seen again no sir he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'm not afraid of my God even if I make a mistake I'm not afraid of my God putting me to the side and banishing me from this because he made come on Saints he made the same vow to you that you made to him oh I'll tell you what my brother and sister we gotta look at this amen now look at this I got sidetracked what happens here now so we have had seven generations I hope you catch this I'm typing it this way on purpose we've had seven generations of hybriding amen the word of God clearly shows us the prophet confirms that that no uh that Christ hadn't even been taken from the scene been sacrificed at Calvary and those Spirits were already moving in we've had seven generations of a high breeding of the word of God my brother and sister and you look but somewhere now the prophet of God ties it back just right after the Dark Ages the moving of Luther and Pentecost and Wesley all of this that God started to really you might say separate the wheat and the tares and so as it was while the generations went on hybriding the word of God Amen you look and find that the regressive Gene showed up are you following me the regressive Gene now you could speak this and people and say what are you doing well I'm telling you here it is I want to just be transparent amen from that point amen a day of Pentecost experience the high breeding stopped amongst the elect lady and every age for Seven Ages while the high breeding was developing and creating something that was not sustainable with no life can't grow on its own but man keeps his hand on it man keeps inserting life in it he keeps putting another gene into it it puts another thing to it oh at a Creed here or we can't trust the people we've got to add a law we got to add this got to add a membership but over here this High breeding is now broken and Seven Ages of regression because a corn plant in a few Generations will regress back to its dominant gene are you with me Seven Ages coming back to the dominant Gene and here we are today my brother and sister we're not hybrid to this we're not hybrid to that we're not hybrid to a program we have come back to the dominant gene the male Alpha Gene Jesus Christ amen we have come back to that while they were moving in a greater hybrid uh Direction uh another perversion as it were and it's there's what was happening the bride nobody made a great to do oh happened was is the seed produced and the scripture says it went to the ground and it has to go into the ground and die or it can't bring life so we see it's rising up the cycle repeating nothing significant about that if you just look from the surface but every time the seed went in the ground there was something inside that scene that said I want to be the original I want the life of my fathers I want the life I don't need pomp I don't need circumstance I don't need all of this I want life and that plant grew and without an outside influence other than catch this without the rain and without the sun that's right that seed went down grew produced seed again on Wednesday night here recently I preached about the lepers ten lepers by God's grace there was one in Fellowship here in the church that was having question and God dealt with it you see that's why my brother and sister when the seed comes up you stand from here to the back of the church just looks like a corn plant worshiping but they're producing different seed one's going back to the original one it being further hybrid I watched should I name it probably not polite to name it I watched a very large denomination in the world a funeral of one of their ministers and I was stunned for all their fine robes when they showed a picture of this Minister this woman without all the robes on without all the stuff a picture and a comment below the picture was the best punk rock pastor ever I'm not being derogatory I want to make a point to you the hybriding that individual can now go out in the punk rock world and walk in and fit perfectly Sunday can go to church put on their Minister robes and fit in perfectly why because both are hybrid had a minister brother I hope you guys don't think I've just lost my mind here today had a minister brother and I was joking one time he said I I wonder brother Paul what would happen if I on a Sunday morning you know I went down here to one of these stores you know and they have these tattoos that you can just you know spray mist on and it looks like the real thing he said I just wonder what the church would do if on a Sunday morning I comb my hair straight forward and come out and I had all this I just wonder what they would do I said do you really want to find out and he goes nah the parking lot's pretty hard you see there's no way the elect lady can exist in a hybrid world and come back to the house of God and say we have the original seed The Original Seed produces the Original Seed and when it goes in the ground every generation coming forward is pure is getting pure is going back to the original until it comes where the prophet of God said they'll stand in the presence of God as they was when he spoke them into existence oh Hallelujah isn't that beautiful amen the select lady what is it it's not our righteousness but we are believers and we stand up and we speak out I believe the word and God is counting righteousness to you and I day after day after day and we think we're just living I just raising my family brother Paul I just go to work we go to church we're just doing what you don't realize is that just living God is giving righteousness and accounting righteousness and you're a count full of righteousness is getting Fuller and Fuller and Fuller because we have been given a gift the seed placed in you and I is a seed that can only say Amen to the word and it will say Amen to the word it won't sit silent amen I'm not talking about how to speak out vocal but in the heart saying that's the truth I believe that hallelujah amen now I'm I'm so far I I haven't even hardly got started I'm sorry amen brother but I'm talking in the pergament church age I'll just paraphrase this to you he says one night I was seeking the Lord the Holy Spirit told me pick up my pen and write and as I grasp the PIN to write his Spirit gave me a message for the church I want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bride do we got time enough I can just read this it isn't that long amen and here's what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each specie brings forth after its own kind even according to Genesis 1 11 God said let the Earth bring forth grass and Herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is I have to go out and find a seed I don't have to start looking under the bench I don't have to go here go to Revival over there that seed is in me Hallelujah I cannot produce anything else but that seed oh Hallelujah oh my amen that is seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was soul and whatever life was in the seed came forth into the plant and thence into the fruit the very same law applies to the church oh Hallelujah come on Saints I could come here and read every how to preach inspirationally every book they have on that go to seminars I could come here but if the inspiration or life of the word is not in this church it won't produce somebody to say thank you Lord for the life no my goodness my brother and sister whatever seed started the church will come forth be like the Original Seed because it's the same seed now how many of you touched denomination at some point in your life if that was the seed that was in you you wouldn't be here this morning you might have set in denomination and they might have tried to give you the hybrid Doctrine with a hybrid teaching hybrid spirit but somehow it never grew I remember one time a man saying oh I just would that God would just pour seed down on me and it would just all grow I think it was the Lord because I was like man some of the seed I'm around I do not want in my life Lord I do not want that to grow you know amen I know none of none of you it's only people like me ever attempted to lie ever get angry ever kick tires ever stop on a ditch bank and throw rocks I know you guys are above that and why you ever elected a pastor that's not above that I don't know but I tell you what I have to go out there with some spiritual Roundup and I have to say Lord I need this and I just watch these things just all Wilt and go away but I tell you what if I'm sitting on the recliner that doesn't get sprayed those Spirits don't go away and pretty soon I'm the only one that's right in the message and you all are wrong and if y'all don't line up with me well you know where you're going because I'm going to be in heaven no no my brother and sister God wants us to come and recognize that the seed that God was so gracious to place in you and I is going to come and you see you look out have you ever met people on the workplace Neighbors very Godly people very Godly people good people caring giving what separates you from them Doctrine seed that's the only thing that separates you because if you and your flesh had that seed you would be that you and your flesh have this seed and you are this amen and how it is that God wants to water that seed and wants you to come with a strength and have a belief in that amen and in these last days the true broad Church Christ seed in parentheses will come to The Headstone and she will be the Super church I'm telling you right now I'm gonna just boast a little bit on you and me amen my brother and sister were sitting here this morning the world won't think much of you and I but we are a super church amen I didn't say mega church I said super church amen because the seed that has been placed in you and I has to come to life do we believe hey we are in the message church right so that means we believe the message amen I don't want to be a Lutheran in a Methodist Church and I don't want to be a message believer in a Lutheran Church either because I just don't know how you deal with that I just don't know I don't know how you deal with it and the bride will be so much oh let me go back I love that so much I just have to read it again these last days the true bride Church Christ seed will come to The Headstone and she will be the not a or part of she will be the Super Church a super race as she nears him we sing this song or it gets sung Here Comes the Bride my brother and sister the bride doesn't stay out there I tell you what speak the vows I'm over here already enjoying the cake um yeah no sir she comes to him you realize that's why in the vows the man always comes out first you guys knew that right right why because even back to ancient times the wife came to the husband amen not 2023 2023 oh this happened just recently she wore a toxin he wore a wedding gown let's not even go there so the bride is coming to the bridegroom and in that right the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be United with him they will be one my brother and sister you cannot oh I tell you you can put a square peg in a round hole if the round hole is big enough amen so it's not that this is a perfect fit the image of Jesus Christ and his pride a perfect image oh are we going to be come let's let's have just a little moment Bible study whatever you want to call it okay how many believe when the Rapture comes we're all going to be perfect wow nobody perfect here good I'm glad you believe that because you see perfection is not in the brine it's in the bridegroom but he brings us into his image of who he is we are not vashti we are Esther Hallelujah what was it Esther had Liberty because she was the image of her husband and she knew his will oh I could I could go and look up some things right here that fit so perfect but excuse me amen now look at this the bride will be so much like him it will even be in his very image this is in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of a living God denominations cannot produce this wrong seed they will produce their Creed and their Dogma mixed with the word this mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product oh my goodness oh my goodness Sister Sarah just come amen you see by going back the bride is going back now you say this and some people say no she's not yes she is she's going back the bride is going back my brother and sister to the original word and in going back to the original word she's moving forward does that make sense amen she went back to the original word and that moved her forward and every time that we put everything aside and go back to the original word we move forward that's why we are constantly in this oscillation moving forward seemingly going back a little bit moving forward because we have to stop and go back to the word to move forward and the growth pattern amen that is in the church has always been of the ages has always been an oscillation of great faith amen signs and wonders in their midst and then seemingly slumping down and then God comes on the scene I've got quote for this if you need it God comes on the scene and they are getting lukewarm the Amber is going out God allows that to happen and then he lights the fire again and the church surges forward past where they were before and they're hot for a season and then they cool down and this is this this is what God is allowing to happen the church in this oscillation moving amen growing amen and you know have you ever heard the phrase I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired I'll tell you what this bride is getting sick and tired of Satan's influence in her life she's getting sick and tired of Satan having influenced my brother and sister and she's coming to the place that she's saying Lord if I have to go back and I need to find a place Lord or maybe I stepped away from the word I'll go back to that place Lord because I have to move forward I've got to move forward in this word and my brother and sister I'm going to stop right there because I'm halfway my [Music] can we consolidate this Wednesday and call it I'll take a Sunday afternoon somewhere [Music] brother Kim and I was talking about this last night interesting enough brother Kim I didn't make the comment at that time but here it is my sermon when we're talking about the hearts being turned back stalking literal this is not a cliche this is not words that we throw out and say oh the hearts are going to be turned back and we all just go on acting like everything's just fine this is a real changing this is a real sifting my brother and sister of the chaff and the wheat it's not good you realize they took those Forks in those days and they threw the wheat up in the air in the breeze the wind blew it away and you think well the wind blew it away but I'm telling you as a farmer when them men walked away from the thrashing floor every day they had all of the husk and Terror all over them and they were dirty it wasn't a clean job [Music] with the headwind wheat was all that mattered and God realizes in our effort to serve him we get some laodicea on us [Music] but he's not looking at laodicea he's looking in wheat and we in our on fire a little cooled off and on fire and a little cooled off the prophet of God said that's God's plan my brother and sister I want to just encourage each and every one of you don't stop at the mistake amen the mistake is just God's way of bringing our attention to something in our life that he wants us to deal with amen he wants you and I I'm going to cut out a whole bunch of this so if it seems like a big gap here he wants you and I to keep one believing keep on speaking because there he is counting righteousness to the black lady can we say Lord I believe amen Lord count to me as righteousness Lord I want to stand for your word and even when I see it's hard even when I'm struggling Lord let something within me just say Lord I believe amen and count it to me is righteousness Lord not for righteousness because our righteousness is filthy rags but his righteousness my brother and sister is accounted and stands the test of time Hallelujah that we can stand before him and say Lord I've done my best amen let's just stand my brothers and sisters just Worship the Lord for a minute amen hallelujah I really wanted to get to this part so I'll just give you the bearish Glimpse as you look through this amen being fully persuaded verse 20 21 22 23 says he staggered not amen and through unbelief but was strong and giving glory to God being fully persuaded that God was able that he had promised he's able to perform it that was imputed to him for righteousness amen do you realize my brother and sister that's you right here in scripture we're not afraid of this world Amen we're not going to fall down under fear and anxiety what's going to happen what if they drop the does the bride go before they drop the bomb does she go right after does it go during what what is happening my brother and sister this stirs people's hearts and causes them anxiety well I'll tell you what why don't we get in Christ and whenever he takes us we go amen it won't have to do with what the government over here the river Euphrates you know how many hits is on the internet now about the Euphrates drying up it's going wild millions of people oh my goodness the Bible says something about that the river Euphrates is drying up it's the end time my brother and sister I don't care about the river Euphrates I care about my relationship with my king amen I care about who I am in Jesus Christ because all of that's going to happen now did did brother Branham literally mean that United States was going to be craters and Ashes and smoldering run or was that figurative well we could sure get in a debate on that [Music] I don't plan on being here to see it that should be where our absolute's at I don't have to figure out what's going to happen when all these demons are loosed and all of these wickedness that come look like scorpions and all of these things I I don't plan on being here amen let's don't misunderstand me let's find our righteousness amen let's find our righteousness because God imputed it to Abraham because of faith he will impute it to you and I because of Faith Hallelujah Can someone say thank you Lord I hope I didn't keep you too long it's always hard when brother Paul tries to do a banquet and servant on the tailgate amen

and they might not how do we treat them they might be an unbeliever it might be a make-believer but they might be a real believer well I tell you what you do I'll tell you how you treat them that
