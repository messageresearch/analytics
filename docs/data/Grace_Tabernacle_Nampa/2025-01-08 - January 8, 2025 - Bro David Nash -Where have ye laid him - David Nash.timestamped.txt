[31:58] the
[31:59] Lord if not to keep you standing too
[32:02] long let's turn
[32:03] to
[32:05] uh it's
[32:10] John
[32:13] H and it's the 11th chapter and I
[32:15] believe we'll start about the 32nd
[32:20] verse I'll say Lord willing as always
[32:23] sometimes we start service we were in
[32:25] Portland not so long with the Hispanic
[32:27] Church there
[32:29] and I got the first scripture read and
[32:31] the whole thing changed from right there
[32:33] and I had to just tell them you did that
[32:37] because the The Notebook was page was
[32:40] empty and uh Lord really blessed that
[32:43] service and amen so we just I'm sure
[32:46] David and Paul both understand so amen
[32:50] but tonight just
[32:53] uh if we could start with actually we'll
[32:56] start with verse 23
[32:58] of 11th chapter
[33:00] John and this is where Jesus has been
[33:04] waiting and they've told him Lazarus is
[33:07] uh sick will you come and he waits and
[33:09] he waits until he tells them Lazarus is
[33:12] dead up in verse 14 and when he comes
[33:17] down well I'll start with verse 21 uh
[33:21] then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou
[33:24] has been here my brother had not died
[33:26] but I know that even now now whatsoever
[33:28] thou will ask of God God will give it
[33:30] thee Jesus said unto her thy brother
[33:33] shall rise again Martha said unto him I
[33:36] know he shall rise again in the
[33:38] resurrection at the last day Jesus said
[33:40] unto her I am the resurrection and the
[33:43] life he that believeth in me though he
[33:46] were dead yet shall he live and
[33:47] whosoever lives and Believes In Me shall
[33:50] never die believest thou this she said
[33:53] unto him yay Lord I believe that thou
[33:55] art the Christ the son of God which
[33:57] should come into the world and when she
[33:59] had said so she went her way and called
[34:02] Mary her sister secretly saying the
[34:04] master has come and calls for
[34:07] thee and when as soon as she had heard
[34:10] that she Rose quickly and came unto him
[34:13] and Jesus was not yet coming into town
[34:16] but was in the place where Martha had
[34:17] met him and there were Jews which were
[34:19] with her in the house and comforted her
[34:21] and when they saw Mary that she rose up
[34:23] hastily and went out they followed her
[34:25] saying she goes unto the grave to weep
[34:29] then when Mary was come to Jesus and saw
[34:32] him she fell down at his feet saying
[34:34] unto the Lord if you had been here my
[34:36] brother had not died then Jesus
[34:38] therefore saw her weeping and the Jews
[34:41] also weeping which came with her he
[34:43] groaned in his spirit and was troubled
[34:45] and he said where have you laid him and
[34:49] said unto him they said unto him Lord
[34:52] come and see gracious Heavenly Father we
[34:56] I give you this service I give you this
[34:57] man I give you the hearts and souls of
[34:59] these
[35:00] people Lord Jesus take full control of
[35:04] all these things in Jesus Christ's name
[35:06] we ask it amen please be seated I
[35:10] thought how appropriate that you would
[35:12] sing that song uh more of him because uh
[35:17] by about this time next week I'll be
[35:19] boarding an airplane for
[35:21] Nicaragua and I haven't heard that song
[35:23] sung in quite a while and brother usabo
[35:27] Orosco who used to take us night after
[35:30] night after night in that country
[35:33] different churches all over the place
[35:36] sometimes driving three or four hours
[35:37] each Direction after a service up in the
[35:40] mountains and different places that was
[35:43] one of his favorite songs and in the
[35:45] Espanol or the Spanish it's m
[35:50] m
[35:51] m and so when I was hearing that I
[35:54] always when I've learned a song in
[35:56] Spanish a lot of times I
[35:58] I want to sing it in Spanish and people
[36:00] look around and I I have to tell people
[36:04] I don't know Spanish I'm sure the there
[36:07] are those who know I don't know Spanish
[36:09] and my friends down there they always
[36:11] tell me that's Spanglish David because

[36:16] not Spanish so please remember
[36:21] us and uh as we will be headed there
[36:24] we'll be in Tri Cities this uh weekend
[36:28] to the little home Church up there who

[36:32] also we spoke last weekend in Louisiana
[36:35] and they always tell us hey wherever you
[36:37] go greet the people they're from Manny
[36:40] Louisiana so be thou officially
[36:43] greeted and uh but yes we will leave
[36:47] we'll come back to Boise and board for
[36:49] Nicaragua San through San Francisco and
[36:52] uh looking for the Lord to do great
[36:54] things Ezekiel called the other day said
[36:57] we could be looking at between 15 or 20
[36:59] services in 14 days so if you write
[37:04] David N on the bottom of your list for
[37:07] prayer I would appreciate it the prayer
[37:10] request tonight actually I sat next to a
[37:13] man coming down here on the airplane and
[37:15] we started talking scripture I he's from
[37:18] San Jose California and very uh
[37:21] knowledgeable man of wisdom a Christian
[37:24] man and when we got out we were getting
[37:26] ready to get off the plane
[37:28] he that is his wife's mother and she
[37:31] lives in Colombia has a ter has had a
[37:35] terrible health condition in her lungs
[37:38] and we prayed together on the airplane
[37:39] and as we were getting off he said you
[37:41] know of all the years and flights I've
[37:42] made he goes this was the best flight
[37:44] I've ever made he said because we talked
[37:47] about the word of the Lord for a good
[37:49] hour and he was just excited and and uh
[37:53] so do remember her name is aresia I
[37:56] believe was how he said it so his name
[37:58] is Ted and he gave me his number and he
[38:01] said when you get to San Jose come look
[38:03] me up so that's kind of what that was
[38:05] all about and then a couple of unspoken
[38:09] considering other people we've been
[38:10] talking to and we just praise the Lord
[38:13] for those things so looking at this
[38:16] scripture
[38:18] tonight we know that it was Jesus had
[38:20] turned to his disciples when he knew
[38:22] that John that Lazarus was dead and how
[38:27] that
[38:28] uh he had waited until that time and he
[38:31] even told him you know I'm glad we
[38:32] weren't there when
[38:34] he
[38:36] because he because he had a a duty from
[38:39] God to do we know one place he said he
[38:42] never did anything he said except the
[38:44] father show him and so the Lord has
[38:46] showed him Lazarus is
[38:48] dead and so when they go there to
[38:51] Lazarus and when he gets to he gets to
[38:53] the place near where they live and
[38:55] Bethany by the way means the house of
[38:58] bitterness and when he gets close to
[39:00] this house of bitterness and Martha gets
[39:02] up and goes out to greet him uh near the
[39:05] place and when she sees him watch what
[39:09] her testimony is she's a Believer she
[39:13] really believes that Jesus Christ is the
[39:16] Messiah that he's the one that God has
[39:18] sent and she makes that statement in
[39:20] verse 21 Lord if you had been here my
[39:23] brother had not have died but even but
[39:27] know that even now whatever you ask of
[39:29] God he will give it to you what a
[39:32] statement of faith her brother has been
[39:36] dead and I believe at this time he'd
[39:38] been dead four days because later on
[39:41] when he tells him to roll back the stone
[39:44] she said he
[39:45] stinks he's been dead four days they
[39:48] didn't have the bombing things like we
[39:50] do today and his body would stink it's
[39:53] starting to rot and so but in this place
[39:57] she said but whatever you if you'd been
[39:59] here he wouldn't have died but whatever
[40:01] you ask now I believe God will do it for
[40:05] you and watch what Jesus answers to that
[40:09] he said unto her thy brother shall rise
[40:12] again now we know that in the word of
[40:14] God the word of God here is here and
[40:17] that God always corrects the
[40:20] error and so when she speaks to him and
[40:24] he tells her thy brother shall rise
[40:25] again what did he just do do yeah what
[40:29] has he just done when he says this to
[40:32] her he is speaking in a prophetic tone
[40:36] because her brother is dead and so he's
[40:39] saying your brother will rise again now
[40:43] the common she was well taught she'd
[40:45] been around the Pharisees she believes
[40:47] in a resurrection unlike the the
[40:50] Sadducees and so she's a believer in the
[40:53] resurrection she's heard all the common
[40:55] doctrine of the day and so as she's
[40:57] listening or when she hears him say this
[41:00] then Martha says unto him I know that he
[41:02] shall rise again at the resurrection at
[41:04] the last day good true honest
[41:09] Doctrine but it was the wrong
[41:12] one amen it was a true honest Doctrine
[41:17] but what was wrong was the author of
[41:20] that Doctrine was standing there and
[41:23] that author of the doctrine this thing
[41:25] that we call resurrection and life it's
[41:28] not an event friends that we're waiting
[41:30] for right it is not an event the event
[41:34] will follow but the one that causes the
[41:37] event said I am the resurrection and the
[41:40] life our resurrection and our life is
[41:43] Jesus Christ Living in each one of us
[41:47] personally that is our
[41:50] resurrection that is our life or the
[41:53] past because he continues and said I am
[41:55] the resurrection and the life he that
[41:57] believes in me though he were dead yet
[42:00] shall he live that's right so he's
[42:04] saying as a Christian if you have
[42:07] received Jesus Christ is as a born again
[42:10] believer you received Jesus Christ you
[42:12] lifted your hands and said Jesus Christ
[42:14] take a hold of me and some people they
[42:17] belittle that and they say well there's
[42:20] no power in that he didn't get nothing
[42:22] he didn't speak in tongues he didn't do
[42:23] this he didn't do that she didn't know
[42:25] you know and they tell you that but look
[42:27] back to the thief on the cross he said
[42:29] the right word to the right person and
[42:32] said Lord remember me and it was enough
[42:36] that the power of God through the memory
[42:38] of God looks at that man and said you'll
[42:40] dwell with me this day in paradise
[42:44] another
[42:45] prophecy and and I've heard the story
[42:47] you know the guy crosses over and here's
[42:49] all these people and they have there all
[42:51] their testimonies and you can read in
[42:53] Hebrews 11 I think it is or about all
[42:56] the things that they went through those
[42:58] people those those great Heroes of Faith
[43:01] and how he walks over and they say how
[43:03] did you get here I don't know I just
[43:05] said the right thing at the right time
[43:07] but the power was in those words to the
[43:10] place it brought salvation unto him so
[43:14] anyone anywhere anytime that touch Jesus
[43:18] Christ that calls on the name of Jesus
[43:21] Christ Jesus take my heart take my life
[43:26] he'll do it friends amen he said and
[43:28] there's I want to say it's in the book
[43:30] of Acts I I might have it wrong he said
[43:32] anyone that calls on the name of Jesus
[43:34] Christ is Reed salvation will they be in
[43:37] the bride can't tell you that that's
[43:40] completely his that's completely his
[43:43] choosing right but what you can receive
[43:46] is salvation through the name and the
[43:49] power of Jesus Christ when we and and I
[43:53] remember the case where there was a
[43:54] woman praying and the congregation
[43:57] uh brother brandham was talking to at
[43:59] the time they they were kind of hesitant
[44:02] about what's going on because they
[44:03] hadn't seen they weren't familiar with
[44:06] prophetic gifts and as they were uh
[44:08] there was a woman she started crying out
[44:10] Jesus Christ Jesus Christ remember me
[44:13] and he kind of rebuked the congregation
[44:16] and I believe it was on the tape
[44:17] decision time and he said what's the
[44:20] matter with you he said anyone that what
[44:23] else can that woman calling on the name
[44:25] of Jesus Christ touch but Jesus Christ
[44:29] when you call on Jesus Christ and ask
[44:32] him into your heart into your life you
[44:36] receive Jesus Christ according to your
[44:38] faith because even when he said the
[44:40] resurrection and the life what was the
[44:42] only requirement was was that whosoever
[44:45] liveth and believeth shall never die
[44:47] believest thou this believe that when
[44:50] you ask you receive and you receive by
[44:54] the faith and when you raise your hands
[44:56] how many times you heard it another
[44:58] place where he said the fact that you
[44:59] raised your hands shows that the life
[45:02] that's in you is reaching out to Jesus
[45:05] Christ and he has to
[45:08] respond because the life that was in you
[45:10] reached out to the life of God
[45:14] Amen and so as he says this he says un
[45:17] her I am the resurrection and the life
[45:19] who is the I am Jesus said I and the
[45:22] father are one who spoke to Moses when
[45:25] he said who should say sent me I am that
[45:29] I am that's who sent Jesus Christ and
[45:33] the I am God we call him the father who
[45:36] is in living in Jesus Christ and that I
[45:39] am
[45:40] God said that's your
[45:43] resurrection that is the what we call it
[45:46] also as it moves into the New Testament
[45:48] after the death burial resurrection and
[45:50] Ascension of Jesus Christ he sends our
[45:54] portion of that I am back that we might
[45:57] receive the same resurrection and life
[46:01] the same father that lived in Jesus is
[46:03] now living in Us by way of repent and be
[46:07] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you
[46:10] shall that's a Bible promise that's a
[46:12] promise from almighty God you shall
[46:15] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[46:19] that's the spirit of
[46:20] God that he pours back to us because of
[46:24] the birth birth life daral burial and
[46:27] resurrection of Jesus
[46:30] Christ praise the
[46:33] lord well it's good we're already out of
[46:36] text but that's
[46:38] okay and he continues there though he
[46:40] were dead yet shall he live and yeah
[46:45] he's tying it together yeah and
[46:48] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[46:51] shall never die believest thou this how
[46:53] many times have we heard it the
[46:55] Christian that's born again that has the
[46:59] the holy ghost that has received Jesus
[47:02] Christ has the seed or the G Gene the
[47:05] word of God dwelling in us and there's
[47:08] no death for the Christian he say well
[47:11] so and so he passed away so
[47:14] what all he did was like I walked out
[47:17] that door a few minutes ago and all we
[47:20] do is step out of an Earthly body that
[47:22] was condemned to death from the Garden
[47:24] of Eden and step into eternal a life a
[47:28] Christian Never Dies Never Dies you
[47:31] cannot die because the Bible says the
[47:34] seed of God dwells within
[47:36] us praise the
[47:39] Lorden and all that it do that it is the
[47:42] only requirement was do you believe it
[47:45] believest thou
[47:46] this can we believe it I believe it amen
[47:52] amen and so he gives this these
[47:55] statements and after he gives these
[47:57] statements they go out and
[48:00] uh she says unto him Lord yay Lord I
[48:04] believe that you're the Christ the son
[48:06] of God which came into the world and
[48:09] when she goes out she calls and her
[48:11] sister comes and well the other people
[48:13] they they even hire people to mourn in
[48:16] those countries they pay them to come I
[48:18] I don't know why if it makes it look
[48:20] better for the funeral service I don't
[48:22] know do anybody have why they do that
[48:25] but they do that and so the other people
[48:28] they see and they they're so they're
[48:29] going to go and to the the place they
[48:32] they think that that's where she's going
[48:33] to go see him and when they uh do this
[48:39] we'll drop down to verse 32 and when
[48:42] Mary was come where Jesus was and saw
[48:44] him she fell down at his feet saying
[48:47] unto him Lord if you had been here my
[48:50] brother had not died what have we just
[48:55] witnessed what are we witnessing because
[48:58] this is almost The Identical words that
[49:00] her that Martha had said when Jesus
[49:03] first come on the scene when she came
[49:06] into the presence of Jesus Christ that
[49:09] was her statement of belief and now as
[49:12] Mary comes into the presence of Jesus
[49:16] Christ she gives the same
[49:18] testimony the almost exactly the same
[49:21] testimony if you had been here my
[49:23] brother had not have died and so she is
[49:27] giving her faith testimony that you're
[49:30] the Christ you're the one that was sent
[49:34] into the world and she didn't even hear
[49:36] the things that Jesus said to Martha as
[49:38] far as we
[49:39] know but she had that same Abraham's
[49:44] seed in her to believe this is the
[49:48] Messiah that was sent from God you are
[49:52] that Messiah if you had been here he
[49:54] would not have died and Jesus had told
[49:57] the people if any two can agree on any
[50:01] one thing you can have what you ask for
[50:07] that should encourage
[50:09] us without even knowing what her sister
[50:12] had said and when he comes to into her
[50:15] presence the presence of God to her said
[50:18] if you'd been here he wouldn't be dead
[50:21] right H what about in our lives what
[50:25] when we when we take these prayers
[50:26] requests when we pray for these things
[50:30] what about those
[50:31] things what about when we agree we come
[50:34] together and and it says we have the
[50:38] mind of God Amen and when we bring these
[50:41] requests it's because in someone's mind
[50:45] it was in Ted's mind to pray for his
[50:48] wife's
[50:49] mother and when we I took it and we
[50:51] prayed for her on the
[50:54] airplane and I and of course course we
[50:56] give him testimonies of how God has
[50:59] healed and how he has raised people up
[51:01] and done all these things he said that
[51:03] is the most encouraging thing I've ever
[51:05] heard considering I said there's a
[51:08] difference between a miracle and Divine
[51:10] Healing that's right she will have to
[51:13] fight for it as you tell her about it
[51:16] but there's no reason and and we gave
[51:18] him the testimony of how you know the
[51:21] doctor said if this guy wakes up at
[51:23] all right he might be a vegetable for
[51:27] the rest of his life and I said you know
[51:29] look at me you saw me walk onto the
[51:32] airplane I said the hospital rode off
[51:35] $80,000 because they said it was I I I
[51:38] guess they said it was
[51:39] impossible number one for me to they
[51:43] they were looking at me being in a
[51:45] hospital bed for maybe two years and on
[51:48] the seventh day we walked out of the
[51:50] hospital that's the healing power of
[51:53] Jesus Christ I remember my son All of
[51:55] You Prayed For Us brother Paul came up
[51:57] prayed for us and it hurt just to be
[52:01] honest it really hurt but I remember
[52:03] Jonathan was the I think the first one
[52:05] that told me he said Dad I know it hurts
[52:07] he goes it has to hurt I mean they had
[52:09] tubes on my spinal cord but every each
[52:12] step we took I do this in the name of
[52:14] Jesus Christ you remember you know and I
[52:18] couldn't walk but in the name of Jesus
[52:20] Christ we walked out of that hospital
[52:23] using the granny Walker we were down
[52:25] here for Isaac and Kristen's wedding
[52:27] amen when I was supposed to be maybe
[52:30] dead or a vegetable that's the healing
[52:34] power of Jesus Christ that's the power
[52:37] of God Unleashed from our hearts when
[52:40] the Holy Ghost begins to speak for our
[52:43] lives oh friends if you're out out there
[52:46] in the tapel land or wherever give your
[52:49] heart to Jesus Christ let that power of
[52:52] God come into you let it come and take a
[52:55] hold of your life and all it takes is
[52:58] Jesus Christ remember me amen and the
[53:02] power is there to give you eternal life
[53:05] amen amen do you believe
[53:09] it I remember I sent someone not too
[53:11] long ago a text because uh we'v been
[53:15] sharing some things and I said you know
[53:17] this is your day to uh I remember how I
[53:21] said it receive it seize it and receive
[53:25] it is that right anyway there was
[53:28] three but to receive it we seize it I'll
[53:33] believe it receive it and or seese it
[53:37] and believe it there we go I got it
[53:38] right that
[53:40] time and that's all it takes by
[53:44] faith we hear
[53:46] it and then and when we seize a hold of
[53:50] the promise then we receive the results
[53:53] of the promise so she go goes there and
[53:57] now she has done what was already
[53:59] commanded of Jesus for the New Testament
[54:02] Believers if any two can believe on any
[54:05] one thing you can have it do you know
[54:07] that in the message of the hour he said
[54:10] that's you and God
[54:12] Amen that's the
[54:14] two just it doesn't take you know a big
[54:17] crowd it takes you and God coming into
[54:21] the mind of God and that's why how the
[54:23] thief on the cross he had the mind of
[54:26] God and when his mind touched the the
[54:29] mind of God in Jesus Christ that
[54:31] responded When Love projects love
[54:34] responds and that man received eternal
[54:37] life in the last moments of his life
[54:41] because he said the right thing with his
[54:43] dying
[54:45] breaths and so we
[54:48] see and
[54:50] uh in verse 33 when Jesus therefore saw
[54:53] her weeping and the Jews weeping which
[54:56] came with her he groaned in his spirit
[54:58] and was
[55:00] troubled this is the
[55:03] Messiah and when he sees this crowd of
[55:06] people and he sees Mary Weeping at his
[55:10] feet as this is going on it says he
[55:13] groaned in his spirit and I like it
[55:16] because we know that the Hebrew they
[55:18] read from from left or from right to
[55:20] left we read left to right and we know
[55:23] we've had the instructions you can take
[55:24] and flip the words around as long as you
[55:27] don't change the words and all it does
[55:30] is change your perspective of what
[55:31] you're looking at and so as he he does
[55:35] this he groans in his spirit and that in
[55:38] the Hebrew every single letter can have
[55:41] a meaning because they even count in
[55:45] their
[55:46] alphabet and how that it says that he
[55:50] groans it means that he sigh in
[55:53] indignation in other words he's kind of
[55:55] disgust usted at these people he as he
[56:00] groans he's sighing it's like oh man
[56:03] that's how I would think of it and he's
[56:06] like what's the matter with these people
[56:08] and it also means to blame or to murmur
[56:11] or to straightly charge when you start
[56:14] adding up all those letters and reading
[56:16] back through it he's he's groaning he's
[56:18] because he's
[56:19] upset with what he's seeing because he's
[56:23] all he's just announced himself I am the
[56:26] resurrection and the life but these
[56:28] other people are there this crowd of
[56:31] people and as he looks at
[56:34] them and another one when you begin to
[56:36] break it down because the other thing
[56:38] each when you start into those letters a
[56:40] lot of times you follow it out and it
[56:42] actually goes it'll take you back to the
[56:45] very root meaning of the word and the
[56:47] root meaning means it's a fixed PL a
[56:51] fixed position I was just eating one of
[56:54] those things for the throat my come
[56:56] tongue is sticky I'm
[56:59] sorry but a fixed position between time
[57:04] and place and a relationship of rest wow
[57:09] H so he's upset because they can't see
[57:13] he is there for a purpose and to show
[57:16] them where to
[57:18] rest and yet it goes one more part and
[57:22] that is a time a place and a purpose or
[57:25] intent
[57:27] that proceeds from the origin
[57:33] point from the origin point from the I
[57:37] am God he has sent Jesus Christ to this
[57:41] place with a purpose and an intent to
[57:45] show who he is the I am living in his
[57:49] son Jesus
[57:51] Christ the origin point he said I am the
[57:55] beginning
[57:57] I am the ending in the Book of
[57:59] Revelation I am Alpha I am Omega and the
[58:03] origin point is
[58:05] there to fulfill the purpose of
[58:09] God and it said there that he was
[58:11] troubled and that's uh agitated or like
[58:16] water just as it starts to boil and as
[58:19] it starts to boil and and and so he was
[58:22] agitated when he was troubled and I
[58:24] thought about how that
[58:28] uh or also like water that's boiling as
[58:32] it comes over the waterfall or you know
[58:34] hits the water and it's like it boils
[58:36] and you can see the Mist coming up off
[58:38] the water and how that this was he was
[58:41] troubled and in uh Psalms 42 it says the
[58:44] deep is calling to the Deep where at the
[58:47] noise of the water
[58:49] spouts as that water begins or when it
[58:52] boils bubbles up out of the out of the
[58:54] ground or we see the geysers I had
[58:57] friend that there lives outside of the
[58:59] grand that used to uh they knew the
[59:02] hours that the geyser would shoot off
[59:04] and if they had a pig or something they
[59:06] wanted to cook and get the skin off they
[59:08] would go out to the hole and drop it
[59:09] down the hole and then wait for the
[59:12] geyser said it's the easiest way to skin
[59:15] an animal you can ever think because
[59:18] when it pops out of the geyser he said
[59:19] you can just take your knife just peel
[59:22] it right
[59:23] off so I don't know why I'm telling you
[59:26] that
[59:27] but but that was the boiling of the
[59:29] water because when the water when that
[59:32] geyser comes up it is so hot it's
[59:34] boiling
[59:35] water and how that this when he was
[59:38] troubled he was agitated he was like
[59:41] boiling water about to announce this
[59:44] deep calling to the Deep God calling not
[59:48] just it will see in a moment here not
[59:51] just for Lazarus but for those people to
[59:54] understand I am the beginning I am the
[59:58] ending and all of that's locked in those
[1:00:00] little words that I often times just
[1:00:03] pass over him but they're there for a
[1:00:06] purpose and he's using that purpose
[1:00:08] tonight for you and
[1:00:11] I and
[1:00:13] so then he
[1:00:15] takes that next verse in verse 34 and
[1:00:18] this was really you know if we took a
[1:00:20] title for it is where have you laid him
[1:00:24] because that's the next thing they said
[1:00:26] unto him Lord come and
[1:00:30] see and that was the question where have
[1:00:33] you laid him who is him that he's
[1:00:35] talking about who is this
[1:00:39] himy who is this well we know if you go
[1:00:43] back up there Lazarus is dead verse 14
[1:00:46] that's who he's talking about where is
[1:00:50] Lazarus where have you laid
[1:00:54] him do you know what the name Lazarus
[1:00:57] actually
[1:00:59] means Lazarus
[1:01:02] strength strong the
[1:01:05] ram the chief the the post of the door
[1:01:11] the oak tree the lentil the strong body
[1:01:15] to twist or be powerful the mighty
[1:01:21] strength I want that to soak
[1:01:24] in Where have have you laid the strong
[1:01:27] one the ram the chief one the one that's
[1:01:31] the strong and mighty one as the post of
[1:01:34] the door what is that
[1:01:37] representing where were they told to
[1:01:40] place the
[1:01:41] blood on the Leno and on the sides or
[1:01:45] the posts of the doors the strongest
[1:01:47] place of the house if you're ever in a
[1:01:48] tornado they have them down south they
[1:01:51] said get in that door frame because it's
[1:01:53] the strongest thing of the house it's
[1:01:56] the strongest part get into a good door
[1:01:59] frame and hold on because that's where
[1:02:02] the strength of the whole whole house
[1:02:05] lies is in that door
[1:02:08] frame it's the strong one the mighty Ram
[1:02:11] the chief the posts of the door the oak
[1:02:16] tree what does the oak tree have to do
[1:02:19] with this if you ever listened to the
[1:02:21] message who is this milk
[1:02:24] aidic when we were in Israel I loved
[1:02:28] brother ruven he was an old fellow he's
[1:02:30] passed away now not so long ago he was
[1:02:33] born and raised I believe in Israel he
[1:02:35] was a Jew but he believed in Christ and
[1:02:38] he that's he traveled with brother
[1:02:39] George and was their our uh like our
[1:02:43] travel adviser I guess you would call it
[1:02:46] and how that he would tell us things you
[1:02:48] know from the Jewish perspective about
[1:02:51] Jesus Christ and I would call him just
[1:02:53] not often but every once in a while I
[1:02:55] would have a a question and I remember
[1:02:57] talking to him I'd been studying some
[1:02:59] things about the plains of mamory and I
[1:03:01] wondered what you know what is it why is
[1:03:05] it a special place and why is and you
[1:03:08] know and so I was talking to him on the
[1:03:10] phone and finally he said David I know
[1:03:12] you're going to come back to Israel he
[1:03:13] said when you come back he goes I would
[1:03:16] like to take you there but it's in
[1:03:17] Palestinian held territory I can't go
[1:03:20] there now but I have been there before
[1:03:24] things were the way they have been in
[1:03:26] and he said I want to tell you that oak
[1:03:28] tree is still
[1:03:30] there wow we're talking friends 4,000
[1:03:35] years old or more I don't know
[1:03:38] exactly where Abraham met
[1:03:41] mzed the one who had no father had no
[1:03:44] mother had no beginning had no no ending
[1:03:47] it was almighty God had stepped out of
[1:03:50] his Heavenly throne and he took a little
[1:03:52] dust or something and and steps into a
[1:03:56] body because he ate calf meat and drank
[1:04:00] milk it was God and he said the tree is
[1:04:04] still there I've seen
[1:04:07] it and he says Where have you laid this
[1:04:10] Lazarus where have you
[1:04:14] laid
[1:04:15] yes where have you laid the
[1:04:19] experience that was there at the Oak
[1:04:22] Tree where have you put meaz a
[1:04:27] dick where have you laid
[1:04:33] him where have you laid the strong body
[1:04:37] of God the powerful one the Mighty the
[1:04:40] strength the strong one where have you
[1:04:43] put
[1:04:45] him
[1:04:47] now think about the rest of it where
[1:04:51] have you laid him where have you put the
[1:04:55] strong the mighty one the chief of
[1:04:57] Israel and why have you laid him as
[1:05:04] dead
[1:05:05] where where have you put him where have
[1:05:09] we put the strong the mighty one where
[1:05:14] have we put the ram of
[1:05:17] God the one that when Abraham was ready
[1:05:21] to slay
[1:05:23] Isaac and God said stop Abra
[1:05:27] now I know you love me because you would
[1:05:30] have gone through with
[1:05:33] it and when Abraham he stops and was he
[1:05:37] he he's looking there at his son and it
[1:05:40] said he lifted up his eyes and when he
[1:05:44] lifted up his eyes because God has just
[1:05:46] spared his son and we find in the Book
[1:05:49] of Romans the reason he spared him when
[1:05:51] he lifted up his eyes it means he opened
[1:05:54] the fountains
[1:05:57] what do you think comes out of your eyes
[1:05:58] the tears and the things like that but
[1:06:00] it also it opens us up to look and
[1:06:03] behold the word of God we open our
[1:06:06] fountains when we come to this book amen
[1:06:10] and when he lifted up his eyes he opens
[1:06:12] The Fountains of God for
[1:06:17] him and what did God just say to him I
[1:06:20] know do you ever look at the let's look
[1:06:22] turn it to that so maybe we can remember
[1:06:25] it it's in Genesis 22nd
[1:06:30] chapter said Abraham lifted up his
[1:06:35] eyes actually the verse before that it's
[1:06:38] in the verse 12 and he said lay not thy
[1:06:41] hand upon the lad neither do thou any
[1:06:44] thing unto him for now I
[1:06:48] know now I know who's the I am God I am
[1:06:54] God is ever present he is the now that's
[1:06:58] right yes and he says to Abraham
[1:07:01] now I what I
[1:07:06] know you ever notice the name of the
[1:07:09] place and Abraham in verse 14 Abraham
[1:07:12] called the name of that place Jehovah
[1:07:14] Gyra as it is said to this day in the
[1:07:16] Mount of the Lord it shall be what it
[1:07:18] shall be
[1:07:20] seen God
[1:07:23] saw not just the fact fact he's pulling
[1:07:26] the knife he looked right into the very
[1:07:29] heart of existence that was in
[1:07:32] Abraham and when he looks into Abraham's
[1:07:35] heart and sees that Abraham has the
[1:07:38] faith as we read of him in the in the
[1:07:40] Book of Romans I believe it is where he
[1:07:43] said he wasn't afraid to kill his son
[1:07:46] because if God could give him that son
[1:07:48] that was as good is dead when his wife's
[1:07:51] womb was Barren and when he had no seed
[1:07:54] left and God gave him that son God was
[1:07:58] able to raise him up again and he'
[1:08:00] already prophesied the first time if you
[1:08:03] go back in that chapter and it says
[1:08:05] Abraham lifted up his eyes and he saw
[1:08:08] the place of sacrifice a far off amen
[1:08:13] well I told the little brother I guess
[1:08:14] I'm the Evangelist
[1:08:17] tonight when he lifted up his eyes what
[1:08:20] did he see when The Fountains of the
[1:08:23] deep were opened and Abraham looked
[1:08:26] he knew that the sacrifice was far
[1:08:30] off a thousand years
[1:08:33] away when he looked and that's why he
[1:08:36] turns back to his men he said me and the
[1:08:39] boy are going up and we're coming back
[1:08:42] because he knew in that sacrifice that
[1:08:44] he looked a far off there was the power
[1:08:46] of the resurrection and he believed
[1:08:53] it praise the Lord
[1:08:56] am and when he said that he prophesies
[1:09:00] we're going up and we're coming back and
[1:09:03] yet it was full within his heart to slay
[1:09:06] his son because if God could give it to
[1:09:08] him the first time he could give it back
[1:09:10] to him that's the faith amen of
[1:09:14] Abraham's seed and so now he asks Jesus
[1:09:18] asks him where have you laid him before
[1:09:20] we get away from Abraham think one more
[1:09:22] thing because as he's raising his hand
[1:09:25] hands and opening his eyes and looking
[1:09:29] into that
[1:09:30] realm he
[1:09:34] said it says that and Abraham lifted up
[1:09:38] his eyes in verse 13 and he looked and
[1:09:41] behold behind him a ram caught in a
[1:09:45] Thicket by his horns and Abraham went
[1:09:48] and took the RAM and offered him up for
[1:09:49] a burnt offering in the stad of his son
[1:09:55] have we read this
[1:09:58] correctly really he lifts up his H hands
[1:10:02] he's you know and his eyes are being
[1:10:04] open and behind
[1:10:07] him is the ram yeah have you ever seen
[1:10:12] think about God because the the name
[1:10:14] that God has called here is the Lord in
[1:10:17] the mountain of the Lord it shall be
[1:10:19] seen and we had a prophetic message
[1:10:21] where a man turns his head back to the
[1:10:24] audience it says you over there sister
[1:10:26] so and so with the cancer on your and
[1:10:29] you Mr so and so what was he showing us
[1:10:33] it's the same God of Abraham the same
[1:10:37] oak tree
[1:10:38] experience oh people open our eyes to
[1:10:41] the power of
[1:10:45] God with the back turned to the tent he
[1:10:48] said why did Sarah
[1:10:51] laugh and now behind Abraham is the
[1:10:54] offering of the sacrifice in the place
[1:10:57] of Abraham's son God provides because
[1:11:01] even Abraham when Isaac ask him going up
[1:11:04] the hill father I have the fire the
[1:11:07] sword the every you know all the stuff
[1:11:09] for the sacrifice but where's the RAM
[1:11:11] and Abraham remember he' had his eyes
[1:11:14] lifted up and he says God will provide
[1:11:18] himself the
[1:11:20] sacrifice he saw God himself becoming my
[1:11:26] sacrifice far off
[1:11:28] amen and then he finds out the ram is
[1:11:32] behind
[1:11:35] him caught in the thicket friends caught
[1:11:39] in the thorn
[1:11:42] bush it's all Jesus Christ this whole
[1:11:44] book is Jesus
[1:11:48] Christ okay and he says Where have you
[1:11:52] laid him where have you laid the
[1:11:54] strength of Israel where have you laid
[1:11:58] the oak tree where have you laid the
[1:12:00] lentil where have you laid this strong
[1:12:03] body of the
[1:12:07] Lord I love him or I wouldn't be here
[1:12:11] tonight that's right I love him because
[1:12:14] he first loved
[1:12:16] me and how
[1:12:19] that sometimes I have doubts and fears
[1:12:21] in my life I do certain things the Lord
[1:12:24] says you know do this and I start to do
[1:12:26] it and I think man am I really supposed
[1:12:28] to do this Lord you know it's like
[1:12:32] the you ever do that is it just me is it
[1:12:35] just me but sometimes God puts us to the
[1:12:39] test just like Abraham I wonder what he
[1:12:42] was going through his mind when he
[1:12:43] raised that
[1:12:45] knife how is God going to make this work
[1:12:49] I know the sacrifice is way there but I
[1:12:54] got to go through with this
[1:12:55] because God told him to do it it said he
[1:12:58] was tempted at the first of chapter 11
[1:13:01] that's right said God did this to tempt
[1:13:04] Abraham to see Abraham are you really
[1:13:08] going to believe my word are you really
[1:13:11] going to believe that your vision
[1:13:14] matches with what I'm telling you it
[1:13:16] looks ridiculous to Man's
[1:13:20] eyes but
[1:13:23] Abraham said had already spoken through
[1:13:25] his son God will be our sacrifice God
[1:13:29] himself provides the sacrifice and so
[1:13:33] here Jesus now back at into the New
[1:13:36] Testament and how he says Where have you
[1:13:39] laid him where have we
[1:13:43] laid the power of
[1:13:46] God why do they have the power of God
[1:13:50] outstretched and
[1:13:52] dead what about them
[1:13:56] now Jesus has announced who he is and
[1:13:59] then he Grieves because they're not
[1:14:01] catching the
[1:14:02] idea and so he's grieved with them and
[1:14:05] then he makes that statement where is he
[1:14:08] where is the oak tree the strong body
[1:14:11] the powerful one and why have you laid
[1:14:15] him out dead what about this world of
[1:14:18] religion that we live in they have laid
[1:14:22] out Lazarus as dead that's right that's
[1:14:27] right and he was hidden behind the stone
[1:14:30] yeah and when he was hidden there and
[1:14:34] laid out as though dead and when we know
[1:14:37] that after that Jesus uh it says Jesus
[1:14:41] wept and they and the Jews they look at
[1:14:43] this say oh how he loved Lazarus like
[1:14:46] he's not going to do something about
[1:14:49] it you know hey love look how much he
[1:14:52] loved him and and they even said could
[1:14:54] not not this man which opened the eyes
[1:14:56] of the blind have caused even this man
[1:14:58] that he should not have died what are
[1:15:01] they
[1:15:02] looking we know from the message of the
[1:15:05] hour a denominational spirit says looks
[1:15:08] at what was done back there and looks
[1:15:10] what's going to be done up there and
[1:15:12] ignores what's happening right now this
[1:15:16] religious world has laid Lazarus the
[1:15:19] strength the power of the almighty God
[1:15:21] as though he's dead laid him flat and
[1:15:25] low as dead and they said couldn't he
[1:15:28] have done it well yes he could have done
[1:15:31] it but he had to show that I am the
[1:15:35] everpresent god is on the scene to take
[1:15:38] care of your
[1:15:40] problems my problems the problems of
[1:15:44] those that we testify to the problems of
[1:15:47] whosoever will let him come and drink
[1:15:50] from the fountain Christ Jesus tonight
[1:15:55] and then he tells him he's groaning
[1:15:58] within himself as he gets to the grave
[1:16:01] in a in a cave and there's a stone laid
[1:16:03] upon it and he says take away the stone
[1:16:05] and this is where Martha
[1:16:07] says uh you know hey Lord he's been dead
[1:16:09] for a while he
[1:16:11] stinks for he's been dead four days but
[1:16:14] Jesus has to turn to her again and
[1:16:16] correct the
[1:16:18] error he said didn't I tell you this
[1:16:21] that if you would believe you should see
[1:16:23] the glory of God
[1:16:25] mhm and they took away the Stone from
[1:16:28] the place and when they removed the
[1:16:31] stone when they rolled back the
[1:16:37] stone huh you mean now you can see into
[1:16:40] that tomb you can see the dead
[1:16:44] man and he
[1:16:46] stinks I'm sorry to say this but there
[1:16:48] are certain people in this world there's
[1:16:52] it's the truth their religion stin
[1:16:56] it's been dead a long
[1:16:58] time and if they don't roll back the
[1:17:00] stone to where they can see the power of
[1:17:04] God restore what is he doing with
[1:17:07] Lazarus and he stops they take away the
[1:17:10] stone where he's laid and Jesus lifts up
[1:17:12] his eyes he opens the
[1:17:17] fountains
[1:17:19] huh he lifts up his eyes and says father
[1:17:21] I thank thee that thou Hast heard me and
[1:17:23] I knew that thou heard me always but
[1:17:26] because of the people which stand by I
[1:17:28] said that they may believe that thou has
[1:17:30] sent me and when he said thus had spoken
[1:17:34] he cried with a loud voice
[1:17:37] Lazarus come
[1:17:40] forth Lazarus thou strength and
[1:17:46] power the oak tree experience the lentil
[1:17:50] the strong body he's calling that life
[1:17:54] to come forth forth from the darkness of
[1:17:57] a religious tomb hidden behind the
[1:18:00] stones the
[1:18:02] stone he's calling it back to life
[1:18:08] amen he was calling the strength and the
[1:18:12] power of God back to life and he that
[1:18:15] was dead came forth bound hand and foot
[1:18:18] with grave cloth clothes and his face
[1:18:21] was bound about with a napkin and Jesus
[1:18:23] said to him said unto them loose him and
[1:18:27] let him go tonight friends I'm asking
[1:18:31] you loose him amen and let him go let
[1:18:35] the power of God roll back the dark
[1:18:40] Stones we' you've heard the Seven Seals
[1:18:44] they were hidden because Jesus was
[1:18:46] hidden in that tomb and when the stone
[1:18:49] was C rolled
[1:18:51] back and the the woman goes to see
[1:18:57] him and he's not
[1:18:59] there why because he had been called
[1:19:02] back amen he had been loosed and the
[1:19:06] power the strength the mdic experience
[1:19:11] the strong body the almighty God had
[1:19:14] been loosed from the power of the grave
[1:19:18] and I'll close with Hebrews the 2
[1:19:23] chapter we know know this these
[1:19:26] things and we know them by the power and
[1:19:29] the glory of
[1:19:31] God and in Hebrews the 2
[1:19:35] chapter it's talking here about
[1:19:39] Jesus
[1:19:41] and in the 14th verse of chapter 2 he
[1:19:45] book of Hebrews for as much then as the
[1:19:47] children are partakers of the Flesh and
[1:19:49] Blood he also himself likewise took part
[1:19:53] of the same
[1:19:55] so God
[1:19:57] himself in his son Jesus Christ in that
[1:20:00] Earthly body is going to take the same
[1:20:04] thing that every man woman child on
[1:20:08] Earth was
[1:20:10] given in this world a fleshly
[1:20:16] body he became partakers of the Flesh
[1:20:19] and Blood he also be took part of that
[1:20:23] and the reason the
[1:20:25] purpose was that through death he might
[1:20:30] destroy him that had the power of death
[1:20:32] that's the
[1:20:33] devil where did the devil get the power
[1:20:36] over
[1:20:38] death let me read the next
[1:20:41] portion and deliver them who the through
[1:20:44] through the fear of death were all their
[1:20:46] life team subject to
[1:20:51] bondage where did he get that
[1:20:55] where did the devil get that because he
[1:20:58] used the serpent to talk to
[1:21:01] Eve to change the word because the word
[1:21:05] was the day you eat thereof you shall
[1:21:07] die and when they partook of that God
[1:21:10] even went to to to Adam and Eve Adam
[1:21:14] where are you where art thou what if
[1:21:18] they had repented right then right but
[1:21:21] they didn't right in fact what they they
[1:21:24] do because of fear they hid themselves
[1:21:29] from the presence of
[1:21:31] God and and that's where Satan got his
[1:21:34] hand to hold was the fear of death the
[1:21:39] fear of death the fear of loss the fear
[1:21:44] that they had no way back yeah that's it
[1:21:48] so he says okay here put these lamb
[1:21:51] skins around you because the alter
[1:21:55] sacrifice is a long ways
[1:21:57] off but it will come and it will be paid
[1:22:02] and the stone has been rolled away for
[1:22:05] us to be able to look in there and say
[1:22:08] I'm not in there anymore that's right we
[1:22:11] don't have to fear death no sir some of
[1:22:15] us may see it before it's
[1:22:17] over I don't know doesn't
[1:22:20] matter just don't fear it that's right
[1:22:23] don't fear it
[1:22:25] because the fear has been deleted by
[1:22:28] Jesus Christ who took the devil's sword
[1:22:31] away remember when Goliath what did he
[1:22:32] hold he held the sword what's the first
[1:22:34] thing David did he took the sword and
[1:22:37] cut the head off the enemy that's
[1:22:39] right the head of the enemy has been
[1:22:42] vanquished through Jesus Christ let us
[1:22:45] stand amen
[1:22:52] amen I'll read verse eight just while
[1:22:54] there cuz I have it underlined and now H
[1:22:56] has put all things in subjection under
[1:22:58] his feet for in that he put all in
[1:23:01] subjection under him he left nothing
[1:23:03] that was not put under him but now we
[1:23:05] see not yet all things put under him we
[1:23:08] don't see it yet because of the blind
