[11:29] Amen. Why don't we stand together as we
[11:32] sing this one? I've come across and uh
[11:35] believe most of you know it. Don't you
[11:36] want to go to heaven? Number 775.
[11:39] [Music]
[11:42] Do we know
[11:43] [Music]
[11:47] it? All right. Well, I guess we'll learn
[11:54] it. Um geez,
[11:58] fine. Don't you want to go to heaven and
[12:02] walk upon the streets of gold?
[12:06] Don't you want to go to heaven and
[12:10] arrest your weary
[12:13] soul, walking in the holy city and
[12:17] listen to the angels
[12:20] sing? Join in the heavenly choir and let
[12:25] your voices
[12:27] ring. Don't you want to go to
[12:31] heaven? Don't you want to live someday?
[12:35] Don't you want to see your loved ones
[12:38] and hear the Savior
[12:41] say, "Welcome to the holy city. Your
[12:46] life has just
[12:49] begun." Then you'll hear the father
[12:52] saying, "Welcome home, my
[12:56] son. If you want to go to heaven, then
[13:00] you must be born again."
[13:04] born of the Holy Spirit. Let Jesus live
[13:10] within. Let him be the one to guide you.
[13:15] Let him be the one to
[13:18] care. Don't you want to go to heaven and
[13:22] have a home up
[13:25] there? Don't you want to go to
[13:29] heaven? Don't you want to live someday?
[13:33] Don't you want to see your loved ones
[13:36] and hear the Savior
[13:39] say, "Welcome to the holy city. Your
[13:44] life has just
[13:47] begun." Then you'll hear the father
[13:50] say, "Welcome home, my
[13:56] son." Well, that wasn't that bad.
[14:00] Um let's go to number 7 8 and 9 as we
[14:02] prepare for
[14:05] [Music]
[14:09] prayer. There's a
[14:13] fountain that is
[14:18] flowing from a
[14:22] place called Calary.
[14:25] [Music]
[14:28] There is
[14:31] healing in it
[14:36] waters. There is
[14:40] joy and
[14:44] victory. Have you
[14:48] been beneath that fountain?
[14:53] There's no
[14:56] other place to
[15:00] go. Flowing
[15:04] down from Calary's
[15:07] [Music]
[15:09] mountain, it will
[15:12] wash you white as
[15:17] snow. Other
[15:20] waters will be
[15:24] bitter. They just
[15:28] can not
[15:32] satisfy. But this
[15:36] fountain flows forever.
[15:41] It will
[15:44] never run
[15:48] dry. Have you
[15:51] been beneath that
[15:56] fountain? There's no
[15:59] other place to go.
[16:04] flowing
[16:07] down from Calary's
[16:11] mountain. It will
[16:15] wash you white as
[16:18] snow. Oh, have you
[16:22] been beneath the fountain?
[16:28] There's no
[16:30] other place to
[16:34] go. Flowing
[16:38] down from Calary's
[16:42] mountain, it will
[16:46] wash you white as
[16:51] snow.
[16:54] Amen. I have a few prayer requests. I'll
[16:56] ask brother Ivan if you could lead us in
[16:59] a word of prayer. Let's remember Sister

[24:37] the sea billows
[24:41] roll since Jesus came into my heart.
[24:48] There's a light in the valley of death
[24:53] now for me. Since Jesus came into my
[25:00] heart and the gates of the city beyond I
[25:07] can see since Jesus came into my heart.
[25:13] Verse 5, please. I shall go there to
[25:17] dwell in that city I know since Jesus
[25:23] came into my
[25:27] heart and I'm happy so happy as onward I
[25:33] go since Jesus came into my
[25:40] heart. Since Jesus came into my
[25:46] heart. Since Jesus came into my
[25:53] heart, floods of joy over my soul. Like
[25:57] the sea billows
[26:01] roll since Jesus came into my
[26:08] heart. Amen.
[26:12] As we stand this last song as brother
[26:14] Paul comes number 977.
[26:22] In his
[26:24] [Music]
[26:27] time. In his
[26:33] time he makes all things
[26:39] beautiful in his time.
[26:46] Lord, please show me every
[26:52] day as you're teaching me your
[26:58] way that you do just what you
[27:04] say in your time.
[27:11] In his
[27:16] time. In his
[27:22] time he makes all things
[27:29] beautiful in his time.
[27:36] Lord, my life to you. I
[27:41] bring may each song I have to
[27:47] sing to you a lovely
[27:53] thing. In his time. Verse one.
[27:59] Oh, in his
[28:05] time. In his
[28:10] time. He makes all things
[28:17] beautiful in his time.
[28:23] Oh Lord, please show me every
[28:28] day as you're teaching me your
[28:34] way that you do just what you
[28:40] say in your time. Verse
[28:46] two, in his
[28:52] time. In his
[28:57] time he makes all things
[29:04] beautiful in his son.
[29:12] Lord to you. God bless you.
[29:16] Beautiful. And your
[29:19] song to
[29:21] sing me to you a lovely
[29:27] thing in his
[29:31] time. Isn't that a beautiful song? Amen.
[29:36] I think it just
[29:39] uh definitely a lesson that we have to
[29:41] learn that it has to happen in God's
[29:44] time. God bless you, brother Trevor,
[29:46] Sister Carrie. That's awesome that you
[29:49] guys had such a good time. Yes. Amen.
[29:53] Let's remember our our brother Ben
[29:55] McCaffy. They were out
[29:58] um for actually his grandmother's
[30:01] brother Ben's grandmother's funeral. And
[30:05] um so they've uh took care of the other
[30:10] things of the that and we'll be going
[30:12] home here in a day or two. But brother
[30:14] Ben strained his back and has tremendous
[30:17] pain. Um and uh we just want to remember
[30:21] him and your prayers. Amen. Lord be with
[30:24] him. And uh each and every prayer
[30:27] request the need. Sometimes we don't
[30:29] always get everything mentioned. Uh but
[30:31] we just say we're uh happy little
[30:34] Phillip is is feeling better. Uh and uh
[30:39] uh you know I say this with a little
[30:41] humor if it's okay. You know um little
[30:44] guy can't really say a whole lot. I know
[30:47] when I get sick I complain and Sister
[30:49] Jerry kind of calls it the man flu. U
[30:53] but um you know imagine the little guy.
[30:55] He can't really tell you it's my back.
[30:57] It's my head. It's my stomach. And so
[31:00] we're thankful, Lord. Just touch our
[31:03] children. Uh keep them safe. Amen. Keep
[31:06] them strong. Amen. Thank you, musicians.
[31:09] That was a beautiful song service.
[31:10] Really touched my heart. Appreciate
[31:12] that. Let's turn in our Bibles to second
[31:14] Corinthians. I want to speak you tonight
[31:17] kind of a multiple title that I had
[31:20] here. uh I gave to them uh the word
[31:24] holds us but I have in parentheses
[31:27] underneath that the word sustains us and
[31:31] uh I thank the Lord for that because uh
[31:34] in a time uh uh that we live in great
[31:37] challenges of the day the age we have
[31:40] been warned by by the word of God what
[31:42] the day would be like but I think
[31:44] sometimes it catches us a little
[31:46] offguard uh of the spirits and the
[31:49] things that we must face uh the
[31:51] challenges uh you know that are there
[31:55] and how Satan can come sometimes and he
[31:58] can just get in the midst of a
[31:59] conversations a husband or wife say good
[32:02] example and uh totally causes things to
[32:06] be misunderstood which brings uh some
[32:08] kind of a friction that is there but if
[32:11] we'll stop and just recognize it's not
[32:15] your husband it's not your wife it's
[32:17] just the devil and he just loves loves
[32:20] to get himself to insert himself in the
[32:23] conversation in the circumstance that he
[32:26] can cause as much chaos as possible. And
[32:30] uh so you know it's a word that is
[32:32] holding us or sustaining us in this day
[32:35] that we're living in. And um I thank God
[32:38] for his word. Amen. Uh without that word
[32:41] now I've tried to keep this kind on the
[32:43] simple side tonight. Uh so 2 Corinthians
[32:47] 12:es 6-10
[32:50] uh and uh this might this might be a
[32:54] little different approach. I don't know.
[32:56] Uh just ask the Lord to have blessed our
[32:59] our studies and blessed this ministry of
[33:02] the word tonight. Bless your ears for
[33:05] hearing. Amen. Verse six. For though I
[33:09] would desire to glory. This the Apostle
[33:11] Paul speaking to the Corinthians. For
[33:13] though I would desire to glory, I shall
[33:15] not be a fool. For I will say the truth,
[33:19] but now I forebear, lest any man should
[33:22] think of me above that which he seeth me
[33:26] to be, or that he heareth of me, and
[33:30] lest I should be exalted above measure
[33:33] through the abundance of the
[33:34] revelations. There was given to me a
[33:37] thorn in the flesh, the messenger of
[33:40] Satan to buffet me, lest I should be
[33:44] exalted above measure. For this thing I
[33:47] besought the Lord thrice, that it might
[33:49] depart from me. And he said unto me, my
[33:53] grace is sufficient for thee, for my
[33:57] strength is made perfect in weakness.
[34:00] Most gladly, therefore, will I rather
[34:02] glory in my infirmities, that the power
[34:05] of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore, I
[34:09] take pleasure in infirmities, in
[34:11] reproaches, in necessities, and
[34:14] persecutions, and distresses for
[34:16] Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then
[34:20] I am strong. Heavenly Father, we thank
[34:24] you for your word. Ask you to bless it,
[34:26] bless your saints tonight. I ask in the
[34:28] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be
[34:31] seated. As we look at this here tonight,
[34:35] just to touch for a few minutes, it it
[34:37] is there we see the very nature of
[34:41] humanity in the Apostle Paul. He was
[34:44] there telling you that uh you know uh
[34:47] these revelations that God has given me,
[34:50] these revelations that have shook the
[34:52] New Testament church, it shook Jerusalem
[34:55] uh and all those around about uh things
[34:58] that that were stunning to them and in
[35:00] some cases hard to be believed. And you
[35:03] know the apostle Paul and and uh uh uh
[35:06] uh Peter had disagreements but in the
[35:09] end it was the revelation shown to Paul
[35:12] that that Peter had to you might say uh
[35:15] acuence to he had to say nope that's the
[35:18] truth and so we see that he's saying you
[35:21] know lest I in my flesh and lest I be
[35:24] like a a regular human would be lifted
[35:27] up be of the things that God has showed
[35:29] me and what has been done uh uh God has
[35:32] come uh and uh showed me through this
[35:35] abundance of revelations. But he said to
[35:38] balance that God has put a thorn in my
[35:41] flesh. And I would say tonight that each
[35:43] and every one of us has some kind of a
[35:46] thorn that you would say is in our
[35:48] flesh. Something there that is we would
[35:50] think, you know what, Lord, I just want
[35:52] delivered from that. I I need delivered
[35:55] from that. Lord, deliver me. He Paul
[35:58] says you know ask the Lord three times
[36:00] and the answer is not I'm going to
[36:02] deliver you it is saying you know what
[36:05] my grace is sufficient for you so it's
[36:08] there it's not always God just taking
[36:11] our problem away but he's giving us
[36:14] grace sufficient to deal to live to
[36:17] overcome and not God erasing our
[36:20] problems one after another wouldn't that
[36:22] be wonderful if we have a little issue a
[36:24] little something a little thing in our
[36:26] flesh a little something in our family,
[36:28] in our life, we could just say, "Lord,
[36:30] take it away." And it was gone. What
[36:32] kind of people would we be? We'd be
[36:33] characterless. We would be asking God to
[36:36] take every little obstacle away. And I
[36:39] think it would probably even go as far
[36:40] as you're in the office working and
[36:43] there's someone who's who's causing a
[36:45] problem. We'd be tempted then to say,
[36:46] "Lord, take them
[36:48] away." But you see, God wants us
[36:51] sometimes to be molded in our character.
[36:54] Amen. I would be. And and so he's there,
[36:57] you know, God's speaking, the Lord's
[36:59] speaking to him, my grace is sufficient
[37:01] for thee, for my strength is made
[37:03] perfect in weakness. Amen. So the
[37:06] Apostle Paul is saying, you know what?
[37:07] I'm going to come to a place. I'm
[37:09] actually going to glory in my infirmity.
[37:12] How how often do you think about
[37:14] glorying in your infirmity? I've got
[37:17] troubles in my life. I've got struggles
[37:19] in my life. I don't like my job or I
[37:22] don't like this circumstance. But I'm
[37:24] going to say thank you, Lord, because
[37:26] you are in control. And and we we don't
[37:29] usually think about it that way. What we
[37:31] really would be is more like the men on
[37:32] the way to Emmas. We'd be walking along
[37:35] reasoning. We thought that God was going
[37:37] to be the deliverer. We thought Jesus
[37:40] was going to be the king. We thought
[37:42] this, we thought this, we thought this.
[37:44] But God is actually molding our
[37:46] character by the infirmities that we are
[37:49] facing. And that we should actually, as
[37:52] hard as it is, I'm preaching to myself
[37:54] tonight, we should be able to stop and
[37:56] say, you know what? Thank you, Lord,
[37:59] because this wouldn't be happening
[38:01] unless you saw that it was good for me.
[38:04] You wouldn't bring me out and forsake me
[38:06] in my infirmity just to watch me squirm
[38:09] and suffer. But you know that there is a
[38:12] purpose there. And so, it's there. Paul
[38:15] is saying,"Most gladly, therefore, will
[38:17] I glory in my infirmities, that the
[38:19] power of Christ may rest upon me.
[38:22] Therefore, I take pleasure in
[38:25] infirmities, in reproaches, in
[38:28] necessities, in persecutions, in
[38:31] distresses for Christ's sake. For when I
[38:33] am weak, then I am strong." And as we
[38:37] are sitting here, my brother and sister,
[38:40] possibly maybe I'm just preaching
[38:42] tonight. I don't know. But if we are
[38:44] sitting here tonight complaining about
[38:45] our circumstance, we are not, "Oh, I'm
[38:48] preaching to Paul. Don't worry about
[38:50] it." Amen. But when we refuse to accept
[38:54] the infirmity and the distresses that
[38:56] come with it, we're actually trying to
[38:59] remain strong in our own position. and
[39:02] we're trying to find strength within
[39:04] oursel when the word is clearly showing
[39:07] us that we need to become weak and when
[39:10] we are weak then we are strong and I I
[39:14] thank the Lord you know the word always
[39:16] has an answer for us and you know the
[39:19] more that we dig in the times of trouble
[39:22] the more that we dig in this right here
[39:25] my brother and sister is our financial
[39:27] counselor this is here our our emotional
[39:30] counselor This here is our marriage
[39:33] counselor. It is a counselor for
[39:35] everything that we have need of. Want to
[39:38] know how to raise your children? It's
[39:39] right here. Know how to be friends? It's
[39:43] right here. Know how to be a servant?
[39:45] It's right here. Amen. The word has the
[39:48] answer for us. Now, we have to decide if
[39:52] the answers that God is giving us, the
[39:54] circumstance that we're in, you have to
[39:57] decide if it's your pleasure or your
[40:00] tribulation.
[40:01] If you are looking at this of how
[40:04] difficult this is, how to deal with
[40:06] these things is so hard. If that has
[40:09] become the figure of speech of your
[40:11] life, this is so hard. I would ask you
[40:15] to go back, study this scripture and
[40:18] look at the position the apostle Paul
[40:20] took when he had these infirmities. He
[40:23] did not say, "I struggle so hard, saints
[40:26] of Corinth, of Ephesus. Oh, I struggle
[40:29] so hard to serve God. He tells you, I've
[40:32] got a thorn in my flesh. I've got
[40:35] infirmities. I've got struggle. But I
[40:37] tell you what I'm going to do. I serve
[40:39] an awesome God. And I'm going to glory
[40:42] in every infirmity that comes my way.
[40:45] Everything that I have to face in my
[40:47] life, I'm going to give glory to God
[40:49] because God's either in control or he's
[40:53] not.
[40:55] And if he's in control, we're
[40:57] complaining not about our circumstance.
[40:59] We're complaining about his leadership.
[41:02] Yeah. And that's something Satan wants
[41:04] to lead us into so that we're actually
[41:07] speaking against the very thing that we
[41:10] say we believe. And Satan is very clever
[41:13] to be able to do that. So we need to
[41:15] stop and we need to look at it. Is it a
[41:17] pleasure or a tribulation to serve God?
[41:20] If it's our tribulation, then recognize
[41:23] why it is there. Maybe there's something
[41:25] in us that needs molded, something that
[41:28] needs to be taken back to the refiner's
[41:30] fire and and burnt out of us. My brother
[41:33] and sister, you know as well as I do
[41:35] that in the flesh, if we are coming up
[41:38] to face the refiner's fire again, the
[41:40] flesh does not want to go back to the
[41:43] fire. Our flesh wants to be blessed,
[41:46] told that we're doing good, and move on.
[41:48] But if God sees a need for us, as it
[41:52] would be tribulation in our flesh, and
[41:54] we need to go back to the refiner's
[41:56] fire, can we find pleasure in going back
[41:59] to the refiner's fire? I say, Lord, help
[42:02] us to find pleasure in going back to the
[42:05] refiner's fire as many times as he sees
[42:09] fit for us to go back. Now, the flesh is
[42:12] not going to like that. Let's just face
[42:14] that. But my brother and sister, if it
[42:16] is our pleasure, our pleasure to to uh
[42:20] serve God, whatever he brings our way,
[42:23] then my brother and sister, give praise
[42:26] to God that he counted you worthy. If he
[42:29] is giving these things to us and we say,
[42:32] I'm going to find pleasure in my
[42:34] tribulation. I'm going to find pleasure
[42:36] in in the thorn that is in my flesh. I I
[42:40] want to say thank you, Lord, that you
[42:43] have saw fit to count me worthy to be
[42:48] part of this. Look what God put Job
[42:50] through just so he could come one day
[42:52] and face the reality of who he really
[42:55] was in the economy of God. Amen. Was Job
[42:58] greater than you?
[43:04] No.
[43:07] No. So, if God chose to do that to
[43:10] Job, here's a signup sheet. I'll leave
[43:14] it in the
[43:15] foyer. See, God is equal in his
[43:18] opportunity of what he saw in Job that
[43:21] he said, "I need to take this out of Job
[43:24] to take Job to a higher level of
[43:27] perfection than ever was thought
[43:31] capable."
[43:34] God's ways are higher than our ways.
[43:35] Let's just set our level of perfection
[43:37] right here. And certainly it would be
[43:39] something we'd say that brother, that
[43:41] sister's going to make the rapture. But
[43:43] God's ways are higher than our way. So
[43:46] our level of perfection, God's got a
[43:48] higher level. I say, Lord, as hard as it
[43:51] will be, let us have pleasure and being
[43:54] called to that high calling in Christ
[43:56] Jesus. not to just remain at the level
[43:59] that is comfortable because it is
[44:01] comfortable and it is something that we
[44:03] have lived at and we know that we can
[44:05] attain to. So Lord just let us live at
[44:08] that level. My brother and sister we are
[44:10] called to a high calling in Christ
[44:12] Jesus. And if he calls us higher and
[44:15] it's painful to go higher then say Lord
[44:18] you are my strength and I am weak and
[44:21] I'm going to come higher. Could that be
[44:24] our prayer today? Yes. Amen. You see
[44:28] something, my brother and
[44:30] sister is happening to God's
[44:33] people. We're seeing all of these
[44:36] prophecies fulfilled.
[44:38] You know, I I I'm not going to dive into
[44:40] politics tonight, but I want to tell you
[44:43] that the scripture says when they say
[44:46] that there is wars and rumors of wars
[44:49] and peace comes sudden destruction and
[44:52] it comes a time that there's supposed to
[44:54] be
[44:56] prosperity. Do you realize in the last
[44:58] year or two, every one of those has been
[45:02] systemic
[45:03] systemically brought to pass? Systematic
[45:07] is the word I'm trying to find. Yeah,
[45:10] systematic right here. Oh, we're moving
[45:13] through a painful time that we're going
[45:16] to go into
[45:18] prosperity. We'll have to add a few
[45:20] trillion to the debt to go
[45:22] there. And yet, we know by prophecy that
[45:25] there's one with a checkbook that is
[45:28] there to bail out America when she can't
[45:31] pay her bill. Now, I want to ask you
[45:34] tonight, are you going to go, "Oh, this
[45:37] is horrible." Or are you going to say,
[45:39] "Thank you, Lord. Your word's coming to
[45:41] pass."
[45:42] Isn't that It's hard, my brother and
[45:45] sister. I'll just be honest with you.
[45:47] When it comes to economics, I I like it
[45:49] when it's easy, when there's money in
[45:52] the bank, and I can afford a few extra
[45:54] things and I can do kind of what I'd
[45:56] like to do. And I I like that, my
[45:59] brother and sister. But the prophet of
[46:01] God said there'll come a squeeze.
[46:04] Yeah. Are we still rejoicing?
[46:07] Amen. Yeah. We really need to rejoice,
[46:10] my brother and sister, because the words
[46:12] prophesied that there'll be a squeeze
[46:14] and we should be saying, "Thank you,
[46:16] Lord, that there's a squeeze that's
[46:17] going to cause me to be ready when you
[46:20] call my name, and I will get out of
[46:22] here. I won't be sitting there as those
[46:24] without oil in a comfort zone."
[46:29] We want to be ready. Can someone say
[46:31] amen to that? Amen. Something's
[46:33] happening to God's people. And to
[46:36] recognize what is taking place, we have
[46:39] to actually be in the word. We can't
[46:42] just be in the church. We can't just be
[46:45] a studious studyer of things. We got to
[46:48] be in the word. And when we get in the
[46:51] word, God deals with us. And he said,
[46:53] you know what? I I'll be with you even
[46:56] to the end. So, we have a promise that
[46:58] we're sitting here tonight knowing that
[47:00] God is walking our very path, matching
[47:04] us, as it were, footstep by footstep in
[47:07] the way that we're walking. And yet,
[47:09] somehow, just like Israel in the
[47:11] wilderness, we can find a
[47:13] reason to
[47:16] complain. I'm not talking about any of
[47:18] you. I'm talking about some other folks.
[47:22] You see what's happening is we've got to
[47:25] be in the word to recognize what is
[47:28] actually taking
[47:31] place.
[47:33] Now, God's perfect will, we use that, we
[47:36] hear that phrase, right? Have you prayed
[47:39] that even in a prayer? Lord, I just want
[47:42] your perfect will. But you see to be in
[47:46] God's perfect will requires a perfect
[47:49] submission to his will because without
[47:53] perfect submission or full submission to
[47:55] his will to his word then we will find
[47:58] ourselves uh uh uh complaining or
[48:01] struggling over the fact of what is
[48:04] happening in my life. Why am I going
[48:06] through this same cycle again? uh uh
[48:09] brother Rap you know brought that out in
[48:11] his deal you know on this screen and
[48:13] there is Israel uh uh so close to the
[48:17] promised land but uh uh going around in
[48:20] their cycle and you know God's here
[48:23] today there's cycles taking place in
[48:26] lives today there's cycles taking place
[48:29] in churches today and you see God
[48:31] doesn't want us caught in a cycle he
[48:33] wants us in his word and his word came
[48:36] to deliver us from the cycles that man
[48:39] and politics and all of these things
[48:41] create it's to deliver us to be that.
[48:44] Now the prophet of God says what happens
[48:46] is listening to it today in the first
[48:48] seal the prophet of God says you know
[48:50] you watch them and they caught a little
[48:52] spark of inspiration and they came out
[48:56] only to create a denomination around
[48:59] what they come their new revelation they
[49:03] come out of and they just started
[49:05] circling again and then God brings his
[49:07] word anoints a man they come out but
[49:10] what happens is they just go and start
[49:12] circling again. And my brother and
[49:15] sister, we weren't called to just circle
[49:17] around in circles. We were called to be
[49:19] delivered in this age from everything
[49:22] that would hinder you. The prophet of
[49:24] God also says that you are here as the
[49:27] bride of Christ to manifest the word. So
[49:31] the circle is causing people to not
[49:34] manifest the word. They're getting into
[49:36] a cycle. And that cycle, my brother and
[49:39] sister, if it is not bringing us closer
[49:41] to the Lord, is as taught to the young
[49:44] people, a red herring. It is there just
[49:48] simply to be a distraction to draw our
[49:51] attention away. You know, and I would
[49:53] say this, uh, please don't read too much
[49:56] into it, but when we get concerned about
[49:59] what's happening with people a,000,
[50:02] 2,000, 5,000, 8,000 miles away, so much
[50:07] so that we can't serve God to our
[50:10] potential because of their problem in
[50:13] their church, it's just a herring, plain
[50:17] and simple. something to distract us out
[50:20] of the word to keep us from digging into
[50:23] the word to see the word manifested in
[50:26] us. Satan's so clever. We get caught up
[50:28] in politics. Just talking to a brother,
[50:31] I'll just throw this in. I was just
[50:32] talking to a brother and he was telling
[50:34] me, "My, you know, there's this deal
[50:36] here and and you know, we got some folks
[50:38] in our part of the world is how he put
[50:40] it. are all caught up now in the flat
[50:43] earth and and conspiracy theories and
[50:46] they they come to church, they get out
[50:47] of church, they just barely step out the
[50:49] doors and and they're talking about the
[50:51] latest
[50:53] conspiracy. My brother and sister, let
[50:55] me give you a conspiracy to talk about.
[50:57] There's a conspiracy where God come
[50:59] down, anointed men and women in the 21st
[51:03] century with the Holy Ghost to cause
[51:06] them to come to a place that they are
[51:08] filling their lamp full of oil and they
[51:12] will stand there in that day with oil in
[51:15] their lamp and when behold the
[51:17] bridegroom cometh, they're not going to
[51:19] have to go run looking for it. How's
[51:21] that for a conspiracy? Amen. Not
[51:24] everyone's going to have it. It's only
[51:25] for a secret group of people. Sounds
[51:28] pretty conspiratorial, doesn't it, my
[51:30] brother and sister? But I tell you,
[51:32] that's what God wants us to look to, not
[51:34] to what the deal is. I Is this Trump,
[51:37] President Trump? Uh uh uh uh is he the
[51:41] last Trump in scripture? You know,
[51:43] people come up with this. Does it matter
[51:46] if that's where it's placed in the
[51:47] scripture? Where are you at? Where am I
[51:50] at? Are
[51:52] we putting oil in our lamp or are we
[51:56] burning what oil we have? That's not too
[51:59] straightforward, is it? H. Okay. A
[52:03] couple of you at least nodded. Yeah.
[52:05] Makes me nervous. Now, look, Brother
[52:08] Brandham says here in the uh uh message
[52:11] experiences,
[52:13] um he said, I'll admit, yeah, you have
[52:16] to catch a little of this. I didn't want
[52:17] to just bring the whole thing out cuz
[52:19] it's just a lot of I'll admit there's a
[52:23] sickness unto death and that's why
[52:25] prophetic gifts are in the church to
[52:26] know these things. But to say that our
[52:28] father that a man had rheumatism
[52:30] arthritis say yes Lord now look at this.
[52:33] This is the prophet giving this as an
[52:36] example. A man would say yes Lord I'm
[52:39] glad to have it. Glad you gave it to me.
[52:43] I embrace it. I love it. I glory in
[52:48] tribulation. That's just hard to
[52:50] comprehend, isn't it? To to have
[52:52] something in your life, an affliction in
[52:54] this flesh. And to say, you know what?
[52:56] Thank you, Lord, for letting me have
[52:57] this. Thank you, Lord, that maybe
[52:59] there's something in me that uh will
[53:02] you'll heal me. And let that be a
[53:04] testimony that you're a healer. You see,
[53:06] mostly we do a a a little bit of
[53:09] reasoning, a little bit of complaining,
[53:12] a little bit of expressing ourselves uh
[53:15] in such a fashion. Now, you know, I
[53:17] don't want to sound like negative, but
[53:20] you see, but brother Brown's laying this
[53:21] out, a man is an example. I glory in
[53:25] tribulation. Paul's thorn in the flesh
[53:28] that was no more disease than nothing
[53:30] else. Now, I want you to catch that.
[53:33] That's a very important phrase right
[53:34] there. It wasn't
[53:38] disease. If it wasn't
[53:41] healing, he got well and he said, "The
[53:43] messenger of the devil that buffet me."
[53:46] What does the word buffet mean? Blow
[53:49] after blow. See, then he healed him. He
[53:52] got well and he healed him again. He got
[53:55] sick and healed him. He got sick. Blow
[53:58] after blow. He said, "A messenger of
[54:01] Satan, not an
[54:03] infirmity." as he meant as he said
[54:06] there, but as people try to interpret, I
[54:08] will let brother Baxter take that thorn
[54:10] in the flesh for you some afternoon or
[54:12] some of these teachers. You see, Brother
[54:14] Brown's laying a groundwork that some of
[54:17] the things that we just out of touch in
[54:20] the uh uh spiritual conflict, we'll look
[54:23] at this and say, "Well, this is disease.
[54:25] This is this circumstance." But the
[54:27] prophet's laying out, and you can
[54:29] clarify this in more than one uh
[54:31] message, one more one service. The
[54:33] prophet's telling you what you're seeing
[54:35] is the evidence of Satan attacking you.
[54:40] Yeah. So, we're looking in a flesh
[54:42] realm, my brother and sister, at a
[54:44] spiritual battle. And it's there that as
[54:47] we look in a flesh realm at a spiritual
[54:50] battle, God wants you and I to recognize
[54:53] the buffeting is not your body. Oh,
[54:57] there is symptoms that are there.
[54:58] There's things that happen. But my
[55:00] brother and sister, there is a spiritual
[55:03] battle and Satan desires to drive home
[55:07] his position in your life in the flesh,
[55:11] but it's
[55:13] actually a spiritual battle. Yeah,
[55:17] it's not a battle of the flesh, but we
[55:22] interpret it that way. It's actually a
[55:26] spiritual battle taking place. Yeah. Are
[55:30] you with me?
[55:33] So, we're prophetically we're we're
[55:35] shown here. We're not the sickly
[55:38] Christian that we might think we are,
[55:41] but we're actually being buffeted in our
[55:45] flesh by Satan. God's going to heal you.
[55:48] Satan's going to try and put it upon you
[55:50] again. We'll see that in many a
[55:53] attributes, many things that are there.
[55:55] So, we're being buffeted. And then as we
[55:58] go further in the scripture, you'll see
[56:00] it's talking about fiery trials. And
[56:03] many times I I I've experienced this
[56:05] myself as a minister that that people
[56:07] are in the midst of fiery trials and
[56:10] they're believing they've done something
[56:12] wrong. Now, you take that quote that the
[56:14] prophet did there and put those two
[56:17] together and realize that in this battle
[56:20] that's going on. It's not that you did
[56:23] something wrong, but Satan is buffeting
[56:26] you. You've got to recognize how much
[56:29] Satan hates you. He hates everything
[56:32] that you are, everything that you stand
[56:34] for, and he's going to buffet you. Amen.
[56:38] And he's he's going to he's going to
[56:40] bring it in such a fashion that he's
[56:42] putting it back on you as though you are
[56:45] a sickly, weak, unworthy Christian. But
[56:48] the truth of it is God has said that you
[56:51] will stand. That the word in you will
[56:54] endure to the end will be an overcomer.
[56:57] You will come in this day and stand and
[57:00] shine as great pillars in his
[57:03] tabernacle. My brother and sister. So,
[57:06] it's not about whether you're worthy or
[57:08] unworthy. It's about the fact that God
[57:11] knew you would stand. And Satan has his
[57:14] punch coming. That's the way the prophet
[57:15] of God put it. That Satan's got his
[57:18] punch coming. And so, God's not going to
[57:21] block every blow of Satan. He's going to
[57:23] allow you as sons and daughters of God
[57:26] to stand on this and to recognize that
[57:29] Christ in you. Amen. This is why my
[57:32] title, the word holds us or the word
[57:35] sustains us because God is going to let
[57:38] Satan prove that the word is in you. Oh,
[57:41] wouldn't that be wonderful if we were
[57:43] just issued a a ID card from the Lord
[57:46] that said you got the Holy Ghost and
[57:48] you're going to overcome all battles and
[57:50] when the devil would show up, you could
[57:52] just show him the card. That's not how
[57:54] it works. When the battle shows up, my
[57:57] brother and sister, God's going to let
[57:59] the word that is deposited in you of who
[58:01] you are is going to rise up. Have you
[58:04] ever noticed it's in times like that,
[58:06] you you run into trouble and travail and
[58:09] at first it feels like a great body blow
[58:12] and you kind of stagger backwards under
[58:14] the circumstance and yet there's
[58:16] something in you starts to rally and you
[58:18] start to remember what you had just read
[58:20] yesterday in your Bible or that morning
[58:23] in the Bible. You start to remember the
[58:25] things that the prophet of God had said
[58:27] and you start to rise up, you know, and
[58:29] we feel bad that we staggered, but God
[58:32] is allowing us, right? The raising of
[58:34] the standard is not someone raising it
[58:37] for you. It's the word in you rising up
[58:40] to stem Satan's flow, his uh
[58:43] overpowering. And as we do that, we'll
[58:45] see that God is standing there with us
[58:48] at that time. And we are, as I said
[58:51] earlier, not a sickly Christian. We are
[58:54] sons and daughters of God. And sometimes
[58:56] it is in the flesh that we react a
[58:59] little slower than we later think we
[59:01] should have. But my brother and sister,
[59:04] you know, Satan wants to use in this
[59:07] spiritual warfare. He wants to use uh
[59:10] your body against you. He wants to use
[59:13] your own mind against you. Can someone
[59:16] say amen to that? Amen. And the closer
[59:20] we get to the promise, the greater this
[59:23] battle is going to become. So if you
[59:25] think while we're still on flesh that we
[59:28] are going to just hit some nice easy
[59:29] valley and coast our way through to the
[59:32] finish, you're mistaken. The closer we
[59:34] get, you'll see that the challenge that
[59:37] came in the wilderness journey it come.
[59:40] Yes, as as brother Ramper brought it
[59:42] out, the elders passed away and there
[59:45] were those. But look at that, my brother
[59:47] and sister. how few God thinned down the
[59:52] age group that was Joshua and Caleb.
[59:55] Thinn that right down and it come down
[59:58] to where there was a generation that
[1:00:00] knew
[1:00:02] not. But by revelation they knew. You
[1:00:07] see, they didn't have to fall back on
[1:00:10] this. Oh, we've got this example right
[1:00:12] here. Now, this uh could be
[1:00:15] controversial and just let it be
[1:00:16] controversial. My brother and sister,
[1:00:18] God's bringing us to a time. It's not
[1:00:20] about what God did for brother Brandham
[1:00:22] in the woods or what brother Brandham
[1:00:24] did here, what God did over here. It's
[1:00:26] coming to a time. What did God do for
[1:00:28] you and I? And we stand here tonight. We
[1:00:31] should have our own testimony. We should
[1:00:33] have our own witness. We should have our
[1:00:35] own faith rising up that we see. Now,
[1:00:38] we're not taking away what God did with
[1:00:40] brother Brandham. He was showing us the
[1:00:43] way. He was there as a a
[1:00:46] a oh, I just lost the word there. As a
[1:00:50] trailblazer. He was there as a
[1:00:53] trailblazer. But it's coming a time that
[1:00:55] you and I have a testimony of what God
[1:00:58] is doing for us. And we can stand on
[1:01:01] that. It's not wrong to say, "Hey, look,
[1:01:04] I got my own testimony." Amen. I don't
[1:01:06] need to go and and rely on this
[1:01:09] brother's testimony or on that brother's
[1:01:11] testimony. I've got my own testimony.
[1:01:13] The word has come. It has healed me. It
[1:01:16] has corrected me, has delivered me, has
[1:01:18] guiding me, has met me in the midnight
[1:01:20] hour. I've got my own testimony. Amen.
[1:01:24] Because the word is holding us. We're
[1:01:26] not being held by a man. And you know,
[1:01:28] this will be controversy in the wording.
[1:01:31] We're not being held by a
[1:01:33] message. Are you with
[1:01:36] me? Oh, that that'll go over real well
[1:01:38] like a rock, my brother and sister. But
[1:01:41] you see, almost every denomination out
[1:01:43] there has a message. So you can't just
[1:01:46] say we're being held by a message. The
[1:01:49] message is Jesus Christ to you and I.
[1:01:51] Amen. That's what God's message is. Is
[1:01:54] him directly speaking to you and I. He
[1:01:57] brought a prophet to tie all the loose
[1:01:59] ends together to put everything where it
[1:02:02] needs to be for you and I to be able to
[1:02:05] go forward in truth. Not wandering from
[1:02:08] this and having to correct it and wander
[1:02:10] to here and have to correct it. But it
[1:02:12] come and it put everything in line that
[1:02:15] we can walk in truth. But when we have
[1:02:17] truth, we need to walk. Amen. We need to
[1:02:20] have an action. We need to have a a a
[1:02:23] going forward into the word of God.
[1:02:25] Remember what happened with Joshua and
[1:02:28] Israel? You know, some of them were
[1:02:29] cattlemen and they come to the Jordan
[1:02:32] and they were there and they tell
[1:02:34] Joshua, they said, "You know what? We're
[1:02:36] just going to stay right over here
[1:02:38] because we are a people of cattle and of
[1:02:42] livestock. And this is a land here of
[1:02:45] livestock. So, we're right here at the
[1:02:48] promised land. We're just going to stay
[1:02:49] right here. And Joshua says, "You will
[1:02:52] rise up and you will cross over or you
[1:02:55] will die just like your elders died."
[1:02:59] You see, there's no coming close. We
[1:03:02] have to cross over. Now Joshua told
[1:03:04] them, "Once you've crossed over and can
[1:03:06] honestly claim the promise, come back
[1:03:09] and claim this land and put your cattle
[1:03:11] on it. That's fine. But you got to cross
[1:03:13] over. Get the Holy Ghost." Amen. First
[1:03:16] before you can stop. Amen. So as we'll
[1:03:19] look at this, we'll see as Satan is
[1:03:22] doing now. Look at this
[1:03:26] here. And who is
[1:03:29] this? Brother Bram says after his death,
[1:03:32] burial, and resurrection, Paul was on
[1:03:34] the road to Damascus one day, and a
[1:03:36] great light struck him down. Those men
[1:03:39] around him didn't see the light, but it
[1:03:41] struck Paul down till it made him blind.
[1:03:44] He had trouble with his eyes the rest of
[1:03:46] his life. And he said one time, "Except
[1:03:49] I should be exalted above the abundance
[1:03:51] of the revelation, there was given to me
[1:03:54] a thorn in his flesh, a messenger of
[1:03:56] Satan to buffet him because it was the
[1:03:59] abundance of the revelation." Now, I
[1:04:03] want to make a bold statement to you
[1:04:04] tonight. You're sitting here tonight
[1:04:06] with an abundance of revelation. You are
[1:04:09] sitting here tonight. Oh, it's the
[1:04:11] message. Brother Brandon preached it.
[1:04:13] There's the revelation. No, my brother
[1:04:15] and sister, the revelation is in you and
[1:04:18] I. The revealing of the word that went
[1:04:21] forth is being expressed in you and I.
[1:04:24] It's not in days gone by. It's not in
[1:04:26] another age. It's not in another
[1:04:28] dispensation. But the manifestation of
[1:04:31] the word is taking place in our young
[1:04:33] people. It's taking place in h the
[1:04:36] middle age and the old. In every
[1:04:39] circumstance, the word is coming forth.
[1:04:41] And so you're sitting here tonight maybe
[1:04:43] wondering why you have a thorn in your
[1:04:46] flesh. It's just as it was with the
[1:04:48] Apostle Paul. It's because there's an
[1:04:50] abundance of revelation that is in you
[1:04:53] of the revealed word of the hour of the
[1:04:56] day that we live in. God is
[1:04:58] acknowledging the word that was given to
[1:05:01] you, expressed in you, come forth in you
[1:05:04] is of the same nature and value,
[1:05:06] intrinsic value as it was with the
[1:05:09] Apostle Paul. And it's there that we can
[1:05:12] expect to have a thorn in our flesh,
[1:05:14] lest we be lifted up. Lest we become
[1:05:17] arrogant as a people, lest we become
[1:05:20] such that we would be thinking, "Hey,
[1:05:23] you know what? We're the only ones. No
[1:05:25] one else has any value. We're so
[1:05:27] special." God will let that thorn come
[1:05:30] and remind you that you are nobody
[1:05:32] without him. Amen.
[1:05:35] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:05:38] See, day by day, the word being revealed
[1:05:40] in you, there's an abundance of
[1:05:42] revelation when God would come and speak
[1:05:44] to us as a people day by day. But I'll
[1:05:47] tell you, day by day, the battle
[1:05:49] rages. Amen. Seems like every time, you
[1:05:55] know, the prophet of God makes statement
[1:05:58] like, you know, the preacher on Monday
[1:06:01] needs to just have someone near like his
[1:06:03] wife needs to just take it easy and
[1:06:06] rest, get restored because there's a
[1:06:09] battle that's there. There's something
[1:06:11] taking place. But it's not just
[1:06:13] preachers. It's a body of believers. We
[1:06:16] we need to have someone to lean on,
[1:06:18] someone to to be reminded, maybe someone
[1:06:21] to speak to, have a conversation, a a
[1:06:24] godly conversation around the word, just
[1:06:26] to be reminded that what we're facing,
[1:06:30] the word comes forth, we have good
[1:06:32] meetings. The day after seems like a
[1:06:35] dud. Had a a brother today tell me, he
[1:06:37] says, "Well, brother Paul, you guys had
[1:06:39] a good weekend." And I said, "Yes, we
[1:06:40] did." And he said, "Did did you take
[1:06:42] Monday off to recover?" And I said, "I
[1:06:45] went to work to recover." And he's like,
[1:06:47] "Oh, no. You're supposed to take the day
[1:06:50] off." And I thought, "Oh, Lord, someday,
[1:06:53] someday, maybe that'll work." But look
[1:06:55] at this, my brother and sister. In the
[1:06:58] first
[1:06:59] seal, Brother Brandham says this.
[1:07:05] We all know as Christians that God swore
[1:07:08] to David that he would raise up Christ
[1:07:10] to sit on his throne to give him an
[1:07:13] everlasting kingdom here on earth. He
[1:07:16] did it. Jesus said, "He that overcomes
[1:07:19] the Antichrist and all the things of the
[1:07:21] world shall sit with me in my throne as
[1:07:25] I have overcome and have sat down on my
[1:07:28] father's throne." See, now someday he
[1:07:32] rises from his father's throne and goes
[1:07:35] to take his own throne. How he comes
[1:07:38] forth to call his subject. How is he
[1:07:40] going to claim
[1:07:42] them? He's already got the book of
[1:07:44] redemption in his hand. When he come
[1:07:47] from the throne, he had the book of
[1:07:50] redemption in his hand. You see, he
[1:07:53] doesn't have to go back to figure out
[1:07:55] who it is that he's calling. tried to
[1:07:58] identify them through some other it's
[1:08:00] already in his hand and so you know made
[1:08:04] brother Brandham excited enough he says
[1:08:06] oh I feel like singing a hymn soon the
[1:08:12] lamb will take his bride to be ever at
[1:08:16] his side this is song all the host of
[1:08:18] heaven will assembled be to wash that oh
[1:08:22] will to be a glorious sight all the
[1:08:25] saints in spotless white And with Jesus
[1:08:28] we shall feast
[1:08:29] eternally. He says, "Oh my, talk about
[1:08:33] it. Sitting now in heavenly places, what
[1:08:37] will it be?" Now I want to know my
[1:08:39] brother and sister. You know what's you
[1:08:40] know what impacts this goes all the way
[1:08:43] back to the start of the sermon. It's
[1:08:45] whether we view how we view this life
[1:08:49] that we're living, the challenges we
[1:08:51] face. Is this a burden or is it a
[1:08:54] privilege? Right? That will affect our
[1:08:58] life. It will affect us in such ways
[1:09:01] that that we cannot imagine. And so it's
[1:09:04] there, you know, that we are called not
[1:09:07] to tell the Lord over over again how
[1:09:10] hard this is. Not to tell the Lord how
[1:09:12] difficult this battle is, but to tell
[1:09:15] the Lord, "Thank you for the battle.
[1:09:17] Thank you for everything I have to face
[1:09:19] because you said you would be with me."
[1:09:21] and to be with me and be there my
[1:09:24] brother and sister means every step of a
[1:09:26] good day or a bad day. He is right here.
[1:09:30] If you want to use the term in lock step
[1:09:33] with us, we say I had a bad day. Christ
[1:09:36] was with you in that bad day. I had a
[1:09:38] wonderful day. Christ was with you in
[1:09:40] that wonderful day. My brethren said he
[1:09:42] said I would never leave you. And if he
[1:09:45] said I'll never leave you, that doesn't
[1:09:46] mean he got a little distant from us and
[1:09:48] we have to do it. The only way it will
[1:09:50] be is the prophet of God said that the
[1:09:52] Holy Spirit is very timid that if we
[1:09:55] create a wrong atmosphere and it goes to
[1:09:58] the branch as it were above us, that's
[1:10:00] the only reason he's going to pull back
[1:10:02] from us. But if we keep the right
[1:10:04] attitude, the right spirit, the right uh
[1:10:06] uh uh presence before God, he's walking
[1:10:09] right there with us. And even then, you
[1:10:11] know, when he's there on the branch, he
[1:10:13] doesn't leave us forever. Amen. So, as
[1:10:16] he comes forth to call his subjects, how
[1:10:18] is he going to claim them? He's already
[1:10:19] got the book of redemption in his hand.
[1:10:22] Glory. Now, on the tape, my brother and
[1:10:24] sister, Brother Bram's excited here. Not
[1:10:27] just not just a little bit. Amen. Oh, I
[1:10:29] feel like singing him. Amen. And he goes
[1:10:33] into soon the lamb will take his bride
[1:10:34] to be ever at his side. All the host of
[1:10:36] heaven will assemble be to watch that
[1:10:40] will be a glorious sight. and all the
[1:10:41] saints in spotless white with Jesus. We
[1:10:44] shall feast eternally. Oh my, talk about
[1:10:48] sitting now in heavenly places. What
[1:10:50] will it be if we can feel this way
[1:10:53] sitting down here on earth before the
[1:10:55] rapture comes in this condition that
[1:10:57] we're in now and we can enjoy and stand
[1:11:01] up around the walls and stand in the
[1:11:03] rain just to hear this? What will it be
[1:11:05] when we see him sitting here? Oh my,
[1:11:08] it'll be a glorious time. See, it's
[1:11:12] going to all depend on how we look at
[1:11:14] this, my brother and sister, how we see
[1:11:16] ourselves coming to a rapture. Now, my
[1:11:20] brother and sister, I I'm not here. I
[1:11:22] can't dictate. I don't know the terms. I
[1:11:24] don't know anything about that. I know I
[1:11:26] have a desire to be ready when he calls
[1:11:29] to be there when he says, "Uh, behold,
[1:11:32] the bridegroom comes." I I want to be
[1:11:34] able to rise up. The scripture says,
[1:11:36] "Rise up and meet him." I don't want to
[1:11:38] turn and run looking for some oil. And I
[1:11:40] want to be ready for that moment. And I
[1:11:43] know that God's given within my ability,
[1:11:45] within your ability to be able to stand
[1:11:48] and say, "Thank you, Lord. I've got oil
[1:11:51] in my lamp." We're not boasting. Amen.
[1:11:53] I've got oil in my lamp, and I am ready
[1:11:56] for his coming. But you know what? The
[1:11:58] lamp's still burning oil. So, you can't
[1:12:00] just now sit on the laurels. You got to
[1:12:02] get up and you've got to fill the lamp
[1:12:05] again and again and again before the
[1:12:07] rapture come. Just heard the prophet say
[1:12:09] today, "Oh, it might be 20 years." But
[1:12:13] we also know that he has said much
[1:12:15] longer times, much uh longer time frame.
[1:12:19] Amen. In one place he says it might be a
[1:12:21] hundred years. You're going to have to
[1:12:23] put some oil in that lamp. Amen. We're
[1:12:25] not going to be able to just sit back
[1:12:27] and say, "Praise God, I believe God sent
[1:12:28] a prophet." You're going to have to
[1:12:30] actively go out and keep pouring oil in
[1:12:33] your lamp if it's going to last that
[1:12:36] long. Amen. And we don't know the day.
[1:12:38] So, let's keep our lamp full. Amen.
[1:12:40] Let's not sit back and just wait till
[1:12:42] it's right down to almost empty and then
[1:12:45] go out pursuing oil. Let's just keep
[1:12:47] topping it off. Keep topping it off.
[1:12:49] I've used his analogy through the years.
[1:12:51] I'll use it once again. We wouldn't even
[1:12:54] think about driving across the United
[1:12:56] States without pulling into a gas
[1:12:57] station.
[1:13:00] How can we just look at this and think
[1:13:02] we're going to make it in a rapture
[1:13:04] without filling up our oil?
[1:13:08] Refilling again and again. A baptism and
[1:13:12] a refilling and a refilling. You see,
[1:13:15] Satan wants to get us so busy. So many
[1:13:18] herrings. Those of you who weren't at
[1:13:20] the the youth uh uh banquet, such a
[1:13:24] lovely example that Brother Rap brought
[1:13:26] out. You see, the herrings are there
[1:13:28] just to draw our attention away from the
[1:13:30] real thing. Amen. And Satan is so good.
[1:13:32] Can we admit that? He is so good at
[1:13:37] drawing our attention over here and
[1:13:38] drawing our attention over there. Often
[1:13:40] used in the phrase
[1:13:42] rabbit and it draws our attention. But
[1:13:45] you see, God's calling our attention.
[1:13:47] This is part of God. The word holding us
[1:13:51] is it's holding our attention. Our
[1:13:52] attention is not pulled into Leodysa.
[1:13:55] our attention when we start to drift,
[1:13:57] God brings us right back. He's holding
[1:13:58] us in that position. And the word, my
[1:14:01] brother and sister, is affecting our
[1:14:03] lives in such a fashion that we are not
[1:14:07] here saying, "I'm so sorry God drew me
[1:14:10] away from this distraction." We're
[1:14:12] saying, "Thank you, Lord. I give praise
[1:14:14] to you, Lord, because you have drawn my
[1:14:16] attention back from the distraction, and
[1:14:19] you have anointed me to desire and seek
[1:14:22] out those things of the word.
[1:14:25] Amen.
[1:14:27] Hallelujah. 1 Peter
[1:14:36] 4. 1 Peter
[1:14:39] 4:9-14. Use hospitality one to another
[1:14:43] without
[1:14:44] grudging. Now, I find that statement
[1:14:47] kind of interesting.
[1:14:52] I'm going to invite Brother Trevor and
[1:14:54] Sister Carrie to my
[1:14:56] house. I'm a pastor. I'm supposed to be
[1:14:59] hospitable. Will you come to my house?
[1:15:02] Sure. Awesome. Thank you for accepting
[1:15:05] the
[1:15:06] invitation. Do you know, Sister Vik, I
[1:15:09] really wished that Trevor and Carrie
[1:15:10] weren't coming to my house.
[1:15:15] You see, I fulfilled one portion of it,
[1:15:19] but there's a
[1:15:20] grudge hiding underneath
[1:15:24] this. And Trevor and Carrie, brother
[1:15:26] Trevor, Sister Carrie may never
[1:15:29] know that I really resented them coming
[1:15:33] to my house. And they'd be telling each
[1:15:36] other on the way home, "Oh, it was so
[1:15:38] nice. Brother Paul had us over. It was a
[1:15:41] lovely time." But you see something
[1:15:43] grudging
[1:15:47] underneath. Anybody say, "Ouch."
[1:15:51] The Lord don't want us to be that way.
[1:15:52] Because you see that comes over into a
[1:15:54] spiritual place.
[1:15:57] Use hospitality to one another without
[1:15:59] grudging. As every man hath received the
[1:16:02] gift, even so minister the same one to
[1:16:05] another as good stewards of the manifold
[1:16:08] grace of God. Let me be a good steward.
[1:16:11] Can we say that tonight? Lord, let me be
[1:16:13] a good steward of your grace. Amen. Let
[1:16:17] me just hold that and place such an
[1:16:19] intrinsic value to your grace that I
[1:16:23] would be a good steward of that. Amen.
[1:16:26] And if any man speak, let him speak as
[1:16:28] the oracles of God. If any man minister,
[1:16:32] let him do it as if the ability which
[1:16:34] God giveth. that God in all things may
[1:16:37] be glorified through Jesus Christ to
[1:16:39] whom be praise and dominion forever and
[1:16:42] ever. Amen. And I want to just take a
[1:16:45] break right there and tell you see
[1:16:47] oracles, right? If any man's going to
[1:16:50] speak, this is not necessarily see
[1:16:52] there's a break here. It's not
[1:16:53] necessarily a man preaching only to
[1:16:55] preachers. I've heard it said that's
[1:16:57] only to the preachers, but the preachers
[1:16:59] come in the next section of that, right,
[1:17:02] of man ministers. But you do that, let
[1:17:05] us speak of the oracles. And the oracle
[1:17:07] is a divine
[1:17:09] communication. It's a revelation. It's a
[1:17:12] message delivered by God to
[1:17:15] prophets seen as the word of God or the
[1:17:18] scripture. So imagine what we're being
[1:17:21] told here is that we should come to the
[1:17:24] place that we
[1:17:26] speak
[1:17:28] as the word of God revealed to a
[1:17:31] prophet. we speak as the scripture. In
[1:17:36] other words, let us take this word of
[1:17:40] God and share it with one another for a
[1:17:45] spiritual
[1:17:46] value, not as just empty words, but a
[1:17:50] spiritual value which is a
[1:17:53] lifechanging or a token of gain.
[1:17:58] Now, there's be more than one way to
[1:18:00] apply the token, my brother and sister.
[1:18:02] We can apply the word that we have a
[1:18:03] token of spiritual gain. Amen. Or we can
[1:18:07] just have vain empty words. But let it
[1:18:09] be that we would come that we would
[1:18:12] speak and let us speak as the oracles of
[1:18:15] God. If we're a minister, let us do of
[1:18:17] the ability which God giveth, that God
[1:18:20] in all things may be glorified. Do you
[1:18:23] know that you guys preach as many
[1:18:26] sermons as I do?
[1:18:31] And many of your sermons are just as
[1:18:33] effective, if not more, than what come
[1:18:36] over this
[1:18:38] desk. You either leave behind the
[1:18:41] intrinsic value or evidence of the
[1:18:45] word or you leave behind something maybe
[1:18:49] not wrong, not sinful, but maybe empty.
[1:18:55] You know, when you have your diet, you
[1:18:57] know, they they tell you the these
[1:19:00] certain things here, soda pop, for
[1:19:02] example,
[1:19:03] um any of you drink soda
[1:19:06] pop tastes good for the moment, does it?
[1:19:10] But even open that fresh bottle or can
[1:19:12] and just leave it on the counter for a
[1:19:14] little while and everything that seems
[1:19:16] so good about
[1:19:18] it turns bland, leaves a yucky taste.
[1:19:23] Now, I know some of you would disagree
[1:19:24] with me because I've seen you open or
[1:19:27] have a and leave it for
[1:19:29] hours. There's no fizz left. There's no
[1:19:32] nothing. And then you drink it. But I
[1:19:34] wonder, is that because it tasted good
[1:19:36] or some sense of
[1:19:39] obligation? But you see, let the word
[1:19:41] that comes from our lips be fresh, full
[1:19:46] of life, life changing. Let's not share
[1:19:50] a stale gospel with
[1:19:54] people. Now, that was verse 11. Let's go
[1:19:57] on and finish this. Beloved, think it
[1:19:59] not strange. I love how this ties right
[1:20:02] together, flows right together. Think it
[1:20:04] not strange concerning the fiery trial
[1:20:06] which is to try you as though some
[1:20:08] strange things happened unto you. But
[1:20:11] here again, isn't it strange how this
[1:20:13] pops up right in the scripture?
[1:20:17] But rejoice.
[1:20:21] Now, don't lift your hands, but I just
[1:20:23] want to ask you, you can answer it to
[1:20:25] yourself. When's the last time you
[1:20:27] rejoiced over a fiery
[1:20:32] trial? You see what Satan's doing to us?
[1:20:35] He's bringing us to a place we can
[1:20:38] complain about the last fiery trial. We
[1:20:40] can reason over the last fiery trial. We
[1:20:43] can question God over the last fiery
[1:20:47] trial, but we find it very difficult to
[1:20:51] rejoice over the fiery trial. Yeah.
[1:20:56] My in as much as you're partaker of
[1:20:59] Christ's sufferings that when his glory
[1:21:01] shall be revealed, you'll be glad also
[1:21:04] with exceeding
[1:21:05] joy. You see, there's more than just
[1:21:09] saying, "Okay, I'm going to put on a
[1:21:10] happy face going through a fiery trial.
[1:21:12] put on a happy face and that way I I can
[1:21:15] say, "Yeah, brother Paul, I I do that."
[1:21:17] But you see, there's actually a a as
[1:21:20] they use the term risk and reward. So
[1:21:22] the risk that you take by rejoicing when
[1:21:25] things are going wrong, the reward comes
[1:21:28] that when his glory shall be revealed,
[1:21:30] you may be glad also with exceeding joy.
[1:21:33] His glory is going to be revealed,
[1:21:35] saints. It's not an if it's going to be,
[1:21:38] it's when it's going to be. And if we
[1:21:40] are willing to stand up and say, "Lord,
[1:21:42] help me." Oh, I would just say tonight,
[1:21:44] "Lord, lift a hand maybe and say,"Lord,
[1:21:47] help me to have a a a joy in my life."
[1:21:50] Amen. To just testify of the glory of
[1:21:52] God when I'm in a fiery trial because I
[1:21:55] believe your word. And when your glory
[1:21:57] is going to be revealed, I'm going to be
[1:22:00] able to come out of that with exceeding
[1:22:03] joy. And it's not going to be a false
[1:22:05] joy, a fake joy, a put on joy. It's
[1:22:08] going to be a real joy that the
[1:22:09] redeemed, oh my, I can't wait to hear
[1:22:13] the praise of the saints before the
[1:22:15] throne of Almighty God. There's going to
[1:22:17] be such a sincerity, such a real joy,
[1:22:21] such a praise coming out of that. And
[1:22:23] I'm looking forward to seeing this come
[1:22:25] to pass in your life and in my life.
[1:22:28] Amen. If you be reproached for the name
[1:22:30] of Christ, happy are ye, for the spirit
[1:22:33] of glory and of God resteth upon you. On
[1:22:36] their part, he is evil spoken of, but on
[1:22:38] your part, he is
[1:22:41] glorified. I say tonight, Lord, help us
[1:22:44] to give you praise. You're holding us.
[1:22:47] You're keeping us. You're everything to
[1:22:50] me. You say, "Brother Paul, you don't
[1:22:52] understand the trial I'm going through."
[1:22:54] You're right. Paul doesn't, but my Lord
[1:22:56] Jesus does. Amen. And we give him praise
[1:23:00] so that when this is revealed, we will
[1:23:03] also be glad with exceeding joy. Amen. I
[1:23:07] want to say thank you, Lord. Amen. That
[1:23:10] you're so good to me. Sister Vikica,
[1:23:12] will you come,
[1:23:13] please?
[1:23:15] Hallelujah. Our
[1:23:17] musicians, I thank the Lord for our
[1:23:20] musicians. Amen. It's just so
[1:23:22] wonderful. Hallelujah.
[1:23:33] Hallelujah. Let's just stand. I'd like
[1:23:36] to sing this song as I was studying and
[1:23:38] stuff as higher ground.
[1:23:42] 543.
[1:23:44] Amen. I trust there'd be just a little
[1:23:46] something maybe if nothing else it stir
[1:23:48] up your pure mind and remembrance that
[1:23:51] we're here to give praise and glory and
[1:23:53] honor to the Lord. Amen. We're not here
[1:23:56] to talk about how downtrodden and how
[1:24:00] this has went
[1:24:01] wrong.
[1:24:03] Amen. Lord's laid on my
[1:24:06] heart to to start in South Africa in a
[1:24:10] certain fashion. And this kind of a
[1:24:12] little bit connects into that. My
[1:24:14] brother and sister, God doesn't want us
[1:24:16] standing here tonight reasoning
[1:24:18] why it's not going the way we thought it
[1:24:20] would. reasoning why we thought God
[1:24:24] meant this. Reasoning why it should be
[1:24:27] like this. God wants us just to believe
[1:24:30] his word, take his word, stand on his
[1:24:32] word, and watch his word come to
[1:24:35] pass. Oh
[1:24:37] [Music]
[1:24:40] my, I'm
[1:24:44] press the upward way.
[1:24:48] New high time
[1:24:51] gameing every
[1:24:55] day playing
[1:24:58] as I'm onward
[1:25:01] bound. Lord, plant my feet on
[1:25:05] higher
[1:25:07] ground. Lord, lift me
[1:25:11] up and let me
[1:25:15] stand by faith on
[1:25:18] heaven's table
[1:25:22] land a higher
[1:25:25] plane than I have
[1:25:29] found. Lord, plant my feet on
[1:25:32] higher ground.
[1:25:36] My heart has
[1:25:38] no desire to
[1:25:42] stay. Where doubts
[1:25:45] arise and fears
[1:25:49] dismay. Though some may
[1:25:52] dwell, where these
[1:25:56] abound, my prayer, my aim is
[1:25:59] higher
[1:26:02] ground. me
[1:26:05] up and let me
[1:26:09] stand by faith on
[1:26:13] hand sable
[1:26:16] land a higher
[1:26:19] blade than I have
[1:26:22] found. Lord, plant my feet on
[1:26:26] higher ground.
[1:26:30] I want to
[1:26:32] live above this
[1:26:36] world. Though Satan's
[1:26:39] dogs at me are
[1:26:43] heard, for faith has
[1:26:46] called the joyful
[1:26:50] sound. The song of saints on
[1:26:53] higher ground.
[1:26:57] Lord, lift me
[1:26:59] up and let me
[1:27:03] stand by faith on
[1:27:06] hand than save a
[1:27:10] land a higher
[1:27:13] plain than I have
[1:27:16] found. Lord, plant my feet on
[1:27:20] higher ground.
[1:27:23] I want to
[1:27:26] scale the utmost
[1:27:29] high and catch a
[1:27:33] gleam of glory
[1:27:36] bright. But still I'll
[1:27:39] pray till heaven I
[1:27:43] found. Lord lead me onto
[1:27:47] higher ground.
[1:27:50] Lord, lift me
[1:27:53] up and let me
[1:27:56] stand my faith on
[1:27:59] heaven and save a
[1:28:03] land. A higher
[1:28:06] plane than I have
[1:28:10] found. Lord, plant my feet on
[1:28:14] higher ground. Lord, lift me up. Lord,
[1:28:17] lift me up. up and let me
[1:28:23] stand by faith on
[1:28:26] heaven and save a
[1:28:30] land a higher
[1:28:33] place than I have
[1:28:37] found. Lord, plant my feet on
[1:28:41] higher ground.
[1:28:47] sing. I've got so much to thank him for
[1:28:50] and I've got so much to thank him
[1:28:56] for. So much to praise him for. You
[1:29:02] see, he's been so good to me.
[1:29:09] And when I
[1:29:11] think of what he's done and
[1:29:16] where he's brought me from, I've got so
[1:29:21] much to
[1:29:23] thank him for.
[1:29:28] When I
[1:29:30] look around and see the good things he's
[1:29:36] done for me, I know I'm unworthy of them
[1:29:43] [Music]
[1:29:45] all. But his
[1:29:47] blessings he freely gives. I owe my
[1:29:53] whole life to him. I've got so much to
[1:29:59] thank him
[1:30:03] for. And I've got so much to thank him
[1:30:09] for. So much to praise him for. You
[1:30:15] see, he's been so good to me.
[1:30:22] And when I
[1:30:24] think of what he's done and where he's
[1:30:30] brought me from, I've got so much to
[1:30:35] thank him for.
[1:30:41] Sometimes while on life's way I kneel
[1:30:47] and I stop and say, "Thank you, Lord,
[1:30:51] for all you've done for
[1:30:57] me." And one day I'll reach heaven's
[1:31:02] shore. Oh, please let me kneel once
[1:31:06] more. for. I've got so much to
[1:31:10] thank him
[1:31:13] for. And I've got so much to thank him
[1:31:20] for. So much to praise him for. You see,
[1:31:26] he's been so good to me.
[1:31:32] And when I
[1:31:34] think of what he's done and where he's
[1:31:40] brought me from, I've got so much to
[1:31:45] thank him for. One more time. And I've
[1:31:50] got so much to thank him
[1:31:55] for. So much to praise him for. You see,
[1:32:01] he's been so good to
[1:32:06] me. And when I
[1:32:09] think of what he's done and where he's
[1:32:15] brought me from, I've got so much to
[1:32:20] thank him for.

[1:32:54] We've got the
[1:32:58] power in the name of the
[1:33:03] Lord. Give me your
[1:33:07] hand. Let's agree
[1:33:11] together that all of our
[1:33:16] eneies will crumble at our feet.
[1:33:22] Whatever we bind on
[1:33:26] earth shall be bound in
[1:33:31] heaven at the name of
[1:33:35] Jesus. Satan has to
[1:33:40] flee for we've got the
[1:33:45] power in the name of Jesus.
[1:33:50] We've got the
[1:33:54] power in the name of the
[1:33:59] Lord. Though saints and
[1:34:03] ragees, we cannot be defeated.
[1:34:09] We've got the
[1:34:12] power in the name of the
[1:34:18] Lord. For many years
[1:34:21] now, Satan's tried to stop
[1:34:26] us. But the bride of
[1:34:31] Jesus, Lord, we're still alive.
[1:34:36] Like a mighty
[1:34:40] army, we keep maring
[1:34:44] onward, fighting every
[1:34:49] battle, cuz the Lord's on our
[1:34:53] side. Oh, we've got the
[1:34:58] power in the name of Jesus.

[1:35:39] Jesus. I've got the
[1:35:43] power in the name of the
[1:35:48] Lord. Though Satan
[1:35:52] rages, I cannot be defeated.
[1:35:58] For I've got the
[1:36:01] power in the name of the Lord. Though
[1:36:05] Satan rages, though Satan
