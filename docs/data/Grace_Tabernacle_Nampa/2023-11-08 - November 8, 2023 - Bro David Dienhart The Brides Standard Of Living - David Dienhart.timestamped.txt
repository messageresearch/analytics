[37:41] I'm sorry 1 Corinthians two and we'll
[37:44] begin reading here about the i' say
[37:47] about the 10th verse I just want to kind
[37:49] of back up I want to uh come down to
[37:52] verse 16 as something but I want to read
[37:56] these up before
[37:59] that and I and I just want to uh trust
[38:03] you catch what's is said tonight bride
[38:07] standard of living
[38:09] recognizing our
[38:12] position we must get our
[38:14] position amen God wants us to realize
[38:19] our
[38:20] position the bride's
[38:22] ultimate the bride's
[38:25] ultimate bride's here this morning T
[38:27] night right bride's ultimate the
[38:29] ultimate is is the absolute the amen so
[38:33] the bride's ultimate is down in that
[38:35] Third Realm the
[38:38] soul that predestinated seed that's been
[38:41] alive Made Alive and quickened which is
[38:44] Jesus Christ revealed in you which is
[38:47] the new
[38:48] birth Christ birthed in you it's a word
[38:51] birth amen a spoken word birth amen so
[38:56] first Corin Corinthians 2 and I begin
[38:59] reading here let's just take verse 9 but
[39:01] is as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor
[39:04] Ear heard neither have entered into the
[39:06] heart of man the things which God hath
[39:08] prepared for them that love him but God
[39:12] hath revealed them unto us by his spirit
[39:18] for the spirit searcheth all things yay
[39:21] the Deep things of God the hidden things
[39:24] we know in this hour this day the the
[39:27] the the hidden Mystery of God is
[39:30] revealed the finished mystery how many
[39:32] you say amen amen the finished mystery
[39:35] of God and we're rejoicing and walking
[39:38] in that Revelation that's what the
[39:39] bride's position is is is that secret
[39:44] amen that God would only he said the
[39:46] seals were only open to the bride did
[39:49] you know that the Seven Seals and notice
[39:52] it's Seven Seals opened not six seven
[39:58] Seven Seals are opened he said it over
[40:00] and over again it's those Seven Seals
[40:03] opened have been opened are opened amen
[40:08] all right so so 1 Corinthians and verse
[40:12] 10 and I read verse 10 verse
[40:15] 11 for what man knoweth the things of
[40:18] man save the spirit of man which is in
[40:21] him even so the things of God knoweth no
[40:25] man but the spirit of
[40:28] God now you see you must the spirit of
[40:30] God's the only thing that can to open
[40:33] his word to you to you amen now we have
[40:37] received not the spirit of the
[40:40] world but the spirit of but the spirit
[40:43] which is of god that we might know the
[40:47] things that are freely given to us of
[40:50] God Amen which things also we
[40:55] speak and amen the which things hold
[40:57] this real tight now which things also we
[41:00] speak not in The Words which man's
[41:03] Wisdom
[41:04] teacheth but which the Holy Ghost
[41:07] teacheth comparing spiritual things with
[41:10] spiritual see it's an inside
[41:12] teacher but the natural man receiveth
[41:15] not the things of the spirit of God so
[41:19] why pay attention to
[41:22] him when it comes to the word he has no
[41:25] say in this amen amen the word itself is
[41:30] your
[41:31] ultimate amen all right but the natural
[41:34] man receiveth not the things of the
[41:37] spirit of God for they are foolishness
[41:41] unto
[41:42] him neither can he know them so don't
[41:45] try to figure it out don't try to get
[41:47] educated and try to explain it just rely
[41:50] upon God to open his word reveal it to
[41:52] you amen so he said
[41:57] they are foolishness unto the natural
[42:00] man see for neither can he know them
[42:03] because they are spiritually
[42:09] discerned but he that is spiritual
[42:13] notice but he that is spiritual judgeth
[42:16] all things yet he himself is judged of
[42:20] no
[42:23] man so don't look to your your your your
[42:26] man's side to judge
[42:31] you that's not what's judging you amen
[42:34] don't look to that and say oh my
[42:37] goodness I failed I did this and judge
[42:40] yourself a
[42:42] failure God never said you
[42:45] were God never called you a failure he
[42:48] calls you his word he calls you himself
[42:52] right that's right all right so we're
[42:56] come into this more and more but verse
[42:59] 16 for who hath known the mind of the
[43:03] Lord that he may instruct him but we
[43:07] have the mind of
[43:10] Christ Revelations chapter
[43:23] 12 now we know let's just read verse 10
[43:26] because we know when the prophet said
[43:27] when the bride goes
[43:29] up raptured Satan is kicked out because
[43:35] he has a right to come up and accuse Us
[43:37] in Heavenly places even yet that right
[43:40] but when the bride goes up Satan's cast
[43:43] out he comes and in and and incarnates
[43:46] himself becomes what this that old
[43:49] Dragon becomes the Beast
[43:51] yeah then he breaks the Covenant with
[43:54] Rome or excuse me makes a covenant with
[43:57] Israel excuse me Rome
[43:59] does Amen but the prophet said we
[44:02] wouldn't be here when that's made so how
[44:05] close are
[44:07] we Israel has their hands on the
[44:11] money Wall
[44:14] Street amen that's right so look how
[44:17] look how much the war is costing
[44:21] her all right so anyway I won't go into
[44:23] all that that's another message okay so
[44:26] anyway back to it again and I heard this
[44:29] verse 10 I heard a loud voice saying in
[44:31] heaven now has come salvation and
[44:33] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[44:35] the power of His Christ for the accuser
[44:37] of our Brethren is cast down which
[44:39] accused them before God day and night
[44:42] now look verse
[44:44] 11 how do how how did they come to this
[44:47] Rapture little bride how how did they
[44:49] come to this what they overcome by and
[44:52] they overcame
[44:54] him by the blood of the lamb and by the
[44:58] word of their
[45:00] testimony they love not their lives unto
[45:03] the
[45:04] death amen amen you may be
[45:09] seated I want to read a quote to you out

[47:49] have two heads we have two
[47:52] opinions we only have one opinion that's
[47:55] that's our ultimate that's our absolute
[47:59] down in that inside of the
[48:02] inside where we live where we dwell our
[48:05] dwelling place is in Christ

[48:46] it can't touch you right I'm talking
[48:50] about the real
[48:52] you that Soul you yeah yes amen that
[48:57] spirit of God the the original Faith the
[49:00] original word in you
[49:02] living that's your
[49:05] identification so we'll go into this as
[49:07] we go on further then he goes on to say
[49:10] according to Mal he said there's a
[49:12] promise given to her that she's to come
[49:14] on the
[49:15] scene think of it we're fulfilling
[49:18] scripture right we're a fulfilling
[49:22] prophecy according to Malachi 4 he said
[49:25] which is a scripture there's to rise a
[49:27] message that will shake the
[49:31] hearts that will shake the hearts of the
[49:34] people right back to the apostolic
[49:36] fathers again other words the original
[49:40] Faith there is to rise on the scene in
[49:43] the power of Elijah Same Spirit same
[49:46] power they'll rise in the scene of
[49:48] wilderness man that'll come out and will
[49:50] have a
[49:52] message amen that will run right right
[49:55] straight back to the word again to
[50:00] restore right back to the word not
[50:03] restoring any organization any
[50:05] denomination he's restoring the original
[50:08] word the original Faith The Original
[50:10] Seed is got to come back again in the
[50:13] bride
[50:14] form who is this it's
[50:19] Christ see there's got to be a bride
[50:21] coming of Christ before we have a
[50:24] meeting in the air so we realize he's in
[50:26] his
[50:28] coming he's in his coming can we can we
[50:31] realize that tonight that our position
[50:35] are
[50:36] placing as the anointed word for the
[50:40] hour the prophet said he manifested the
[50:44] word of his hour and he said today the
[50:46] bride will manifest the word of this
[50:50] hour amen it's the same person just in
[50:54] another form
[50:56] the bride was the mystery of Adam Eve
[50:59] was the mystery of Adam the bride today
[51:02] is a mystery within a
[51:05] mystery because Christ Christ was the
[51:09] complete revelation of God God revealed
[51:12] is that right well who's who's your
[51:15] bride all that God was he poured into
[51:18] Christ the complete revelation of
[51:19] himself and now Christ in you will make
[51:22] you the complete revelation of the whole
[51:24] thing amen
[51:25] see there's got to be this promise made
[51:28] manifest the bride seeing her position
[51:32] she's seeing that she's absolutely
[51:34] delivered
[51:36] freed amen but but watch I'm going to
[51:40] come to this the prophet and I'll come
[51:42] to where that said that but he said but
[51:44] she's living well below and at that time
[51:46] not so much now we're coming into that
[51:48] position that place but living below her
[51:51] way below her privilege yeah her
[51:55] position her place see but as we grow in
[51:58] the presence of God we're growing up
[52:01] right right absolutely what do we grow
[52:03] up
[52:04] into the
[52:06] head that's the adoption that's
[52:09] Perfection that's the stature of a
[52:13] perfect
[52:14] man not the man this man but Christ the
[52:18] man in you and
[52:19] I we're growing up into that position
[52:22] that's our stature that's the option
[52:26] that's the placing that's what was
[52:28] preached to us
[52:29] Sunday the maturing of the word we grow
[52:33] up into him in All Things even
[52:36] Christ so what is that headstone it's
[52:39] perfect love it's Christ himself what's
[52:43] the bride to be Christ himself amen yes
[52:46] it's himself in the bride form not
[52:49] another person it's
[52:52] himself the bride the bride is his body
[52:54] the bride is bone of his bone and flesh
[52:56] of his flesh that's what she is see this
[52:59] is a great mystery Paul said but I speak
[53:01] of Christ and the bride because Christ
[53:04] was I mean I mean the bride was Christ's
[53:07] body his own self he didn't hate his own
[53:10] flesh but he he cherishes and nourisheth
[53:13] it and what ought our marriages do right
[53:17] all right see we ought to be a a
[53:20] physical manifestation of that
[53:22] Revelation spiritual Revelation see
[53:24] there there's a there's that there now
[53:27] don't don't expect that you say well
[53:29] Brother David we if we have a mistake no
[53:31] you you make mistakes but that's not
[53:34] what you're judged
[53:35] on God's already opened the book He's
[53:38] already declared your judgment right
[53:43] case is dismissed he's already opened
[53:45] the book in this hour is a book within
[53:47] the book you know we've already been
[53:48] through that there's a Lamb's Book and
[53:51] that's a complete revelation of Jesus
[53:53] Christ is that right but there's any but
[53:55] there's a bride part in there in that
[53:58] book in a section and that was the
[54:00] little book
[54:02] opened and you found your name in that
[54:05] book now that's an eternal security
[54:08] thank you you couldn't be moved from
[54:10] that you can't lose that you can't no
[54:12] way take because you were Justified
[54:15] because justification means you never
[54:16] sinned in the first place you never
[54:19] committed it in the first
[54:21] place amen so so we see a message arises
[54:26] bring us right back to that word run us
[54:28] right St back to the word that's the
[54:30] hour he said we're living
[54:33] in then consider now I ask you at this
[54:36] hour you people of Jeffersonville in
[54:38] 1933 the supernatural light that fell
[54:41] down yonder on the river that day when I
[54:43] was baptizing 500 in the name of Jesus
[54:49] Christ and I was about a 20-year-old boy
[54:52] he said what did it say Jeffersonville
[54:56] what did it say it said the voice said
[54:59] as John the Baptist was sent to forerun
[55:01] the first
[55:04] coming your
[55:07] message will forun this his second
[55:13] coming amen amen amen you know the
[55:17] second coming is called in the Bible an
[55:19] advent it's a it's a second Advent an
[55:22] advent is a period of time it's not just
[55:25] one sudden thing it actually is taking
[55:28] place it's an advent and he forrun the
[55:31] message the seals opened up if the seals
[55:33] were never opened up we' have never seen
[55:35] it but he identified himself already in
[55:38] the heavens because the Bible said the
[55:40] Lord himself shall descend what's he
[55:43] descending
[55:44] for to unite with who
[55:50] himself in the form of his bride see
[55:53] this is the Revelation that that if
[55:55] unless you have an ear to hear unless
[55:57] the holy spirit's in you you'll miss
[56:00] it see but we're not going to miss it if
[56:03] the holy spirit's dwelling in you you
[56:05] have his
[56:06] mind and you can spiritually discern
[56:09] having his Spirit you are spiritually
[56:12] Discerning the word of God for the hour
[56:14] and the season and and by that and
[56:16] through that you become that
[56:19] manifestation all right and so he said
[56:23] so he said now he says behind it your
[56:26] message will F on the second coming into
[56:28] all the
[56:30] world then watch he said this day this
[56:33] scripture is
[56:35] fulfilled what a
[56:39] statement what a positive
[56:43] statement when Jesus Took the book from
[56:45] the priest and stood up to read the
[56:48] scriptures let here read it out of my
[56:50] book and he took it what did he do Under
[56:52] the great that powerful anointing that
[56:54] was upon on him never a greater
[56:56] anointing than that the fullness of God
[56:57] was in one
[56:59] man what did he do under that anointing
[57:01] shout and dance and speak in tongues no
[57:04] it was an emotion he sat
[57:06] down and precious words proceeded from
[57:09] his mouth
[57:11] right that's right think of
[57:14] that amen what an anointing but that
[57:17] same
[57:19] anointing you may have a measure of that
[57:21] but it's in you now right and it's
[57:23] anointing that word to live it walk it
[57:26] and talk it and you can't in your own
[57:28] humanness do
[57:30] that think of that there's no reason to
[57:33] look and try and try and try you just
[57:36] need to give yourself over and recognize
[57:39] it's he that works in you it's he that
[57:41] does it all it's him that's accomplished
[57:45] it all right
[57:47] so let's let's go he said now so we see
[57:51] brother random said in in the message I
[57:54] think it's paragraph
[57:55] 233 you've heard me quote this many
[57:58] times but now we see the Promise being
[58:03] fulfilled now we see the Promise being
[58:06] fulfilled Christ the true
[58:09] headship going in coming in his
[58:16] bride amen amen amen amen I wish I could
[58:20] just shout that to the rooftops
[58:23] amen life is following him amen Right
[58:28] Out of Heaven just like he
[58:30] said all right now let's turn to Mark 11
[58:35] I want to go into this a little further
[58:38] Mark
[58:42] 11 very familiar scripture verse 22 and
[58:46] Jesus answering said unto them have
[58:49] faith in God now if you have a skull
[58:52] field and it's it's right I make
[58:54] reference this cuz not a lot I don't
[58:57] reference skull Fields things except
[58:59] where it was correct but he said here
[59:01] have faith in God and it's a little G
[59:03] and it means have the faith of God now
[59:06] that's exactly what the prophet said was
[59:08] in his working he said he said a
[59:11] Believer is and this is a direct quote
[59:13] out of perfect Faith he said a Believer
[59:16] is are you ready you want to know what a
[59:19] Believer is the faith of God that moves
[59:22] in
[59:23] you amen
[59:25] the believer is you want to know your
[59:27] identification of believer the believer
[59:29] is the faith of God that moves in
[59:33] you all right he said and what is it
[59:37] it's the word Hebrews 4:12 said the word
[59:39] is living and
[59:41] operative and the prophet said she would
[59:43] be the word living and in
[59:46] action so this is what we this is the
[59:48] True
[59:50] Believer see and you don't have to
[59:52] receive anything else no matter what
[59:54] your flesh man tries to tell you as long
[59:56] as you've met that it's the divine
[59:57] revelation to
[59:58] you what is the Revelation to you a
[1:00:02] Vindication it's proven and God backs
[1:00:04] that up in your life because does things
[1:00:07] and works through you things that you
[1:00:08] never could do in
[1:00:11] yourself amen so it's already recognized
[1:00:14] you your failures he's not going to
[1:00:17] recognize the failures because he's
[1:00:18] already taken your failures he's already
[1:00:21] received your failures the chastised me
[1:00:24] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[1:00:26] we are already
[1:00:28] healed so he's already taken your
[1:00:30] failures your mistakes your
[1:00:33] faults and buried in M Calvary yes and
[1:00:36] Rose up and you and I'm coming to this
[1:00:39] in just a minute because I want you to
[1:00:40] hear what he said and you Rose up with
[1:00:43] him already rose up with him he that
[1:00:45] believeth liveth and believeth in me
[1:00:47] shall never die so now you know how the
[1:00:50] battle you say I'm in a battle but see
[1:00:51] how the battle's going to go you're not
[1:00:54] fighting a battle for to get Victory
[1:00:56] you've already got
[1:00:59] Victory you're fighting the battle to
[1:01:02] manifest and prove Victory right amen
[1:01:05] it's already you're already Victorious
[1:01:07] but without a battle that would never be
[1:01:08] made
[1:01:09] manifest one of God's attributes is that
[1:01:12] he's
[1:01:14] Victorious and you're Victorious see in
[1:01:17] him amen if he's his ways are made
[1:01:20] perfect then he turn around and said
[1:01:21] he's made your way perfect why because
[1:01:23] you can't be in have your way not be
[1:01:25] made perfect right what a rejoicing what
[1:01:28] a joy what a peace we have
[1:01:31] see all right so he said Mark 11:22 goes
[1:01:36] on to say verily verily I for verily
[1:01:38] verily I say unto you that whosoever
[1:01:41] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[1:01:43] removed and be thou cast in the sea and
[1:01:45] shall not doubt in his heart but believe
[1:01:48] that those things which he saith shall
[1:01:50] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[1:01:52] saith now the prophet said how how can I
[1:01:55] a man say
[1:01:57] that
[1:01:59] well that was revealed to him when those
[1:02:01] squirrels were created he said it was
[1:02:05] not me it was not my
[1:02:07] inspiration it was God's inspiration
[1:02:10] speaking to me and saying you speak what
[1:02:13] you
[1:02:13] will that was a revelation to him then
[1:02:16] he understood how it would work the just
[1:02:20] shall live by faith so by faith God said
[1:02:23] to him you say
[1:02:25] it he never said I'll say it but it was
[1:02:29] God saying it through him but he uses
[1:02:30] man to say it so whatsoever you
[1:02:35] say now that's all the way through the
[1:02:37] prophet's message you'll you'll notice
[1:02:39] Moses was directed and I'll come to a
[1:02:41] quote here he said where the bride is
[1:02:44] the same thing Jesus himself could do
[1:02:46] nothing in his
[1:02:49] own is that right but it was shown him
[1:02:53] by the father
[1:02:54] and he said this same Harmony is to
[1:02:57] exist between him and his
[1:02:59] bride he shows
[1:03:01] her she
[1:03:03] performs his will in his name amen and
[1:03:08] the seed then the water the word that's
[1:03:10] gone forth is watered and it comes to
[1:03:12] pass if it doesn't come to pass it
[1:03:15] wasn't God that said
[1:03:17] that through your lips so there's got to
[1:03:20] be a backing up there's got to be a
[1:03:22] proving there's got to be when the word
[1:03:24] is revealed the word brother Bram said
[1:03:26] is then Vindicated which means it's been
[1:03:29] it'll have to be
[1:03:31] proven you God can't have a a true
[1:03:33] Revelation and then nothing happened
[1:03:35] behind that right yeah there's a change
[1:03:39] see and of course revelation we know is
[1:03:42] a stimulation that stimulates the
[1:03:44] believer to speak to walk to do yes
[1:03:48] there's an action behind
[1:03:50] this amen all right so so so we see here
[1:03:56] he said now I'll just I'll just and and
[1:03:58] he believes those things which he says
[1:03:59] shall come to pass you'll have
[1:04:01] whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto
[1:04:02] you what things soever you desire When
[1:04:05] you pray believe that you receive them
[1:04:07] right right didn't say believe you'll
[1:04:10] get believe well I hope I get them he
[1:04:13] said believe you receive them right as
[1:04:15] soon as it's spoken you settle it in
[1:04:17] your heart that settles it the word's
[1:04:19] gone out it's got to be
[1:04:21] manifest believe you receive them
[1:04:25] right
[1:04:26] now amen and you shall have what does it
[1:04:29] say and you believe you say and you
[1:04:32] shall have
[1:04:33] them okay now and when you stand praying
[1:04:38] forgive
[1:04:40] yes if you have ought against any that
[1:04:43] your father also which is in heaven May
[1:04:45] forgive you your trespass but if you do
[1:04:48] not forgive neither will your father
[1:04:50] which is in heaven forgive your
[1:04:53] trespasses see so forgiveness one of the
[1:04:56] great characteristics of Our Lord was
[1:04:59] forgiveness and that's the same thing in
[1:05:02] his people it's the same thing all
[1:05:07] right what is an ultimate is the last
[1:05:11] word what is an ultimate is the last
[1:05:13] word the ultimate is the amen it's the
[1:05:16] end of all Strife your
[1:05:19] ultimate amen so your ultimate is down
[1:05:22] here in that Third Realm of the Soul
[1:05:25] that's your tpost that's your ultimate
[1:05:27] you're going to be whatever you are
[1:05:29] there
[1:05:30] yeah that's it you can be anointed in
[1:05:33] the second realm but whatever you are in
[1:05:35] there even though can be anointed in the
[1:05:37] second realm just to do Miracles and
[1:05:39] signs and wonders and cast out Devils
[1:05:42] amen is that right like a real believer
[1:05:45] but not have that ultimate or have that
[1:05:48] tie poost in the soul it'll never hold
[1:05:50] true to the word you'll never really be
[1:05:53] able to understand or receive the word
[1:05:56] yet anointed to do these things yet not
[1:05:59] have it and brother Brandman said still
[1:06:02] and can be lost so you see where it is
[1:06:04] is in that Soul realm it's there that
[1:06:09] the word is opened amen there is where
[1:06:12] you're hid there is your
[1:06:15] Refuge amen now the same thing is this
[1:06:18] if you are a son of God and I'm a Son of
[1:06:20] God or a daughter of God we were in God
[1:06:23] at the
[1:06:25] beginning so if we know where we came
[1:06:28] from amen then we know who we are
[1:06:33] right because wherever we came from you
[1:06:35] are a living attribute you were a living
[1:06:38] substance of God right
[1:06:40] there amen and we know what faith is the
[1:06:43] faith that's moving in you is genuine
[1:06:45] substance of things hoped for and the
[1:06:48] evidence of Things Not Seen see you have
[1:06:52] substance you've already got got it amen
[1:06:55] and so we we are already married but
[1:06:57] we're going to a full complete marriage
[1:07:00] right we already have a Rapture but
[1:07:01] we're going to a full complete Rapture
[1:07:03] right we are because we have to see it
[1:07:06] and have it in faith
[1:07:09] first amen everything is done by
[1:07:13] faith Hallelujah all right so now you
[1:07:17] were in God at the beginning and when
[1:07:18] Jesus became the fullness of the word
[1:07:20] then you were in him germ form
[1:07:25] amen amen you are in him germ form that
[1:07:28] was his germ you were in him his own

[1:07:42] when he was crucified we was crucified
[1:07:45] in his body praise the
[1:07:48] Lord what was he cruci he was judged we
[1:07:51] were also judged
[1:07:54] all right when he rose from the dead we
[1:07:58] rose with him yes when he rose from the
[1:08:02] dead we rose with him you see he said we
[1:08:05] rose with and now since we have
[1:08:07] recognized
[1:08:09] it now that since we have recognized
[1:08:12] your day and its message now that we've
[1:08:15] recognized it and awakened remember how
[1:08:18] brother brandham said in the Seal's been
[1:08:19] no nothing to stir the bride as yet
[1:08:21] nothing to awaken it'll take those seven
[1:08:23] th ERS the Revelation contained the
[1:08:25] seals to Waker her and then a year and a
[1:08:28] half later he said he said this this
[1:08:31] this book called Herald of his coming
[1:08:33] crying out constantly crying we need a
[1:08:35] prophet we need a prophet we need a
[1:08:37] prophet he said and they don't
[1:08:39] recognize that this day the scriptures
[1:08:42] fulfilled the prophet is right there but
[1:08:44] so simple though they didn't see it they
[1:08:47] were looking for something way off
[1:08:49] something something big and missing
[1:08:50] God's
[1:08:52] Simplicity see
[1:08:54] and then he said but what they haven't
[1:08:56] recognized now he said there had been no
[1:08:58] Awakening but it took those seven
[1:08:59] Thunders and then he turned around and
[1:09:00] said' but what they haven't recognize is
[1:09:03] the
[1:09:04] Awakening of the Bride so something took
[1:09:07] place there's an Awakening took place
[1:09:11] and there's still an Awakening and we
[1:09:13] recognize see we're recognizing our
[1:09:16] position and what this word was sent for

[1:09:30] and so we we were in germ form we
[1:09:33] crucified we crucified with him we arose
[1:09:34] we arose with him and now since we have
[1:09:36] recognized that now we sit together with
[1:09:39] him in Heavenly places in Christ already
[1:09:42] seated there yes nobody's going to move

[1:25:30] write he said notice the
[1:25:33] harmony notice the harmony of the father
[1:25:36] and the son Jesus Ned did did never did
[1:25:38] anything and I I already spoke on this
[1:25:41] but he never did anything until it was
[1:25:43] first showed him by the Father John
[1:25:46] 5:19 you say well he saw that by Vision
[1:25:48] that's true but it was still a
[1:25:50] revelation to him right
[1:25:53] this is what the prophet's trying to
[1:25:54] drive home when he the spirit of Truth
[1:25:56] has come he will reveal these things to
[1:25:59] you that I've spoken that's the evidence
[1:26:01] of having the Holy Ghost is having the
[1:26:03] ability to hear and receive the word for
[1:26:06] your season right it's a revelation to
[1:26:09] you and the Revelation is the the
[1:26:12] quickening power of the Holy Spirit upon
[1:26:14] the word revealing it and it
[1:26:16] stimulates
[1:26:18] amen amen it's refreshing
[1:26:22] yes it's a refreshment all right now he
[1:26:29] said and but he said this harmony this
[1:26:32] harmony between the father and the son
[1:26:34] is now to exist between the groom and
[1:26:36] his bride which is what his
[1:26:39] body the bride is his body all right he
[1:26:44] shows her her who his body he's showing
[1:26:47] you're a part of that body I may only
[1:26:49] have the measure of a of a grain of
[1:26:52] mustard seed but I'll tell you what
[1:26:55] there's enough measure in that Mustard
[1:26:57] Seed of himself to move
[1:27:02] mountains to call for these things he's
[1:27:06] not measured big and
[1:27:08] little he is what he is in whatever
[1:27:11] measure you
[1:27:12] have I have
[1:27:15] amen that unites us together as one
[1:27:20] person now I could go a lot on that in
[1:27:22] the body we know okay and our our pastor
[1:27:26] has spoken about that all right now he
[1:27:28] shows her the harmony is now to exist
[1:27:31] between the groom and his bride he shows
[1:27:33] her his word of life he shows her his
[1:27:38] Word of Life boy talk about a wife he
[1:27:42] shows her his word doesn't hold it back
[1:27:44] from
[1:27:46] her he reveals it to her all right she
[1:27:50] receives it she never doubts it
[1:27:53] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[1:27:56] death for if the seed be planted the
[1:27:59] water will rais it up again he said here
[1:28:01] is the secret of this here's the secret
[1:28:05] the word is in the
[1:28:10] bride
[1:28:14] amen the bride has the mind of
[1:28:18] Christ for she knows what he wants done
[1:28:22] with the
[1:28:25] word and then she performs the command
[1:28:29] of the word in his name for she has thus
[1:28:32] sayeth the Lord then the word is
[1:28:33] quickened by the spirit and it comes to
[1:28:38] pass watch now that's the evidence that
[1:28:42] it was not your thought was his thought
[1:28:47] it comes to
[1:28:48] pass all right First Kings 18:2 1 and
[1:28:52] Elijah came to all the people and said
[1:28:55] how long halt you between two
[1:28:57] opinions if the Lord be God follow
[1:29:02] him
[1:29:03] [Music]
[1:29:04] Amen on the seventh seal book this is
[1:29:07] the one brother George had put out here
[1:29:09] and I've got it all marked up terribly
[1:29:11] here but
[1:29:14] anyway on on page
[1:29:19] 219 and paragraph 95 I want to read
[1:29:22] something here watch these two opinions
[1:29:25] said Christ wants his wife pure with the
[1:29:29] word the way she must be because nothing
[1:29:34] not one jot or one tit or anything will
[1:29:37] pass from the law from the book that
[1:29:39] book till it's all fulfilled Jesus said
[1:29:43] both heavens and earth will pass away
[1:29:44] but my word shall never pass away don't
[1:29:48] put any private interpretation to it
[1:29:54] he said he wants her pure unadulterated
[1:29:57] not even a
[1:29:59] flirt I wouldn't want my wife flirting
[1:30:01] with some other man see another
[1:30:07] opinion he said and when you go to
[1:30:09] listening to any kind of Reason beyond
[1:30:12] that you're listening and you're
[1:30:13] flirting with
[1:30:16] Satan
[1:30:18] amen see the the word is flawless
[1:30:23] yes it's perfect it's complete it's
[1:30:27] powerful it's
[1:30:29] salvation it it's it's Christ doesn't it
[1:30:33] make you feel religious God wants you to
[1:30:36] stay unadulterated stay right there with
[1:30:38] that word stay right there with it all
[1:30:40] right don't go to two opinions don't be
[1:30:44] caught between your opinion of how you
[1:30:46] feel your
[1:30:49] senses which opinion are you going to to
[1:30:52] take right are you going to take What
[1:30:54] God Says are you going to take what your
[1:30:55] flesh man says right that's no evidence
[1:30:59] what your flesh says what it feels how
[1:31:01] it feels how it reasons an imagination
[1:31:04] all these things see you're possessors
[1:31:06] of those
[1:31:08] Gates the seed of God shall possess the
[1:31:11] Gate of the
[1:31:13] enemy Satan may try to come through
[1:31:15] those Gates but that's not the opinion
[1:31:18] you're listening to so don't get halted
[1:31:20] between two opinions
[1:31:23] you've only got one opinion to follow
[1:31:25] that's your ultimate that's the amen
[1:31:28] that's the word amen there is our
[1:31:31] absolute amen that's
[1:31:37] right our TI poost is the word Psalm 628
[1:31:41] said trust in him at all times ye people
[1:31:45] pour out your heart before him God is a
[1:31:48] refuge for us
[1:31:50] Sila
[1:31:52] meditate upon it Sila meditate upon
[1:31:59] it how can a man say that the bride of
[1:32:03] Christ goes into the tribulation I can't
[1:32:05] understand
[1:32:06] it see she's took away from the
[1:32:09] tribulation if the church has been
[1:32:11] judged and they have judged themselves
[1:32:13] and have accepted the blood how can God
[1:32:15] judge a man that's perfectly totally
[1:32:19] sinless there's no such a person every
[1:32:22] that you say there's no such a person
[1:32:24] every Born Again believer True Believer
[1:32:26] is perfectly absolutely sinless before
[1:32:29] God he's not trusting in his works
[1:32:35] right in the blood of Jesus that his
[1:32:38] confessions dropped into is what he
[1:32:40] trusts the Bible says so he that is born
[1:32:43] of God does not commit sin let's turn to
[1:32:45] 1 John 3:9 a
[1:32:50] minute 1 John 3:9 let me read that
[1:32:53] scripture whosoever is born of God doth
[1:32:56] not commit sin sin is
[1:33:00] unbelief for his now watch I wanted to
[1:33:02] read this because here's why for his
[1:33:05] seed remaineth in
[1:33:07] him it remaineth in him it doesn't he's
[1:33:11] not coming in well you failed takes it
[1:33:12] out right no it was placed there
[1:33:15] predestinated there positioned there
[1:33:18] remember from the very beginning we said
[1:33:20] it ultimate is down in that Third Realm
[1:33:22] the soul that that predestinated
[1:33:26] seed all right see so he said for his
[1:33:30] seed remaineth in him and he can and he
[1:33:33] cannot you might as well just soak it up
[1:33:36] good right now he cannot
[1:33:39] sin he cannot
[1:33:44] sin
[1:33:47] Hallelujah the joy of the Lord is my
[1:33:50] strength he cannot sin because he is
[1:33:54] born of
[1:33:57] God praise the Lord who's begotten you
[1:34:00] who where did you come from if you know
[1:34:02] where you came from you know who you are
[1:34:04] and if you know who you are you
[1:34:06] certainly know where you're
[1:34:09] going
[1:34:12] amen finished work praise the Lord what
[1:34:16] he did in the open of the seals he just
[1:34:17] come to claim lay claim on what he
[1:34:19] already redeemed right
[1:34:22] and he takes the book and he takes Ruth
[1:34:24] to be his
[1:34:26] wife there it is see she's born again

[1:34:35] change of body is that right in the
[1:34:37] spiritual we are a new creation right
[1:34:40] and we're able then to receive seed they
[1:34:43] couldn't receive it when they were in
[1:34:44] their old bodies like that they had to
[1:34:46] be changed and they had to come through
[1:34:48] a birth then they went down to a a guer
[1:34:52] and remember God I don't know why I'm
[1:34:54] saying this I'm going to drop this in
[1:34:56] anyway there they went down to gerer
[1:34:58] after the change yeah yes and Satan

[1:35:32] little sayings just little Spirits
[1:35:34] moving among them and they begin to walk
[1:35:36] and Satan got to her first before God
[1:35:40] did but that can't happen today God gets
[1:35:43] to her before aik did amen he tried to
[1:35:48] but God had the womb closed up amen

[1:40:07] Rapture already in
[1:40:10] progress amen
[1:40:12] what I don't get started in that that
[1:40:15] moving into other sermon I wanted to
[1:40:16] preach so let's leave it alone but
[1:40:18] anyway getting back to this the two ga
[1:40:21] makes one body again like Adam was at
[1:40:23] the beginning man and his wife are now
[1:40:25] are one notice Genesis 21 after they
[1:40:28] come back what happen I'll meet you in

[1:41:03] wife are one and the bride so sold out
[1:41:05] to him she has no mind of her own his
[1:41:08] mind of course is his will and his will
[1:41:10] is his word amen amen now I've just got
[1:41:16] just a few moments and I'm done here now
[1:41:22] okay we covered that all right
[1:41:29] now okay you cannot sin how can he make
[1:41:32] man a sinner when the bleach of blood of
[1:41:34] Jesus Christ stands between him and God
[1:41:36] and would scatter sin until there's
[1:41:38] nothing left of it see see how can that
[1:41:40] pure blood of Christ ever let sin pass
[1:41:43] there it
[1:41:44] cannot amen now Jesus said be perfect
[1:41:47] now we've been through that and he made
[1:41:49] a way for it all right now referring
[1:41:52] back to Mark 11:22 I've just got a
[1:41:54] couple things here out of the church out
[1:41:55] of their seals here now just a
[1:41:57] moment page
[1:41:59] 248 and I want to share these things
[1:42:02] with you because it goes right along
[1:42:03] with what we're saying here page
[1:42:06] 248 paragraph 21- 23 and that's the way
[1:42:11] the blood of Jesus Christ does that and
[1:42:13] this is in the for seal that places a
[1:42:16] man across the chasm again as a Son of
[1:42:18] God and the created power of God is in
[1:42:21] him and at least whatever God command it
[1:42:24] can command it to be done it will be
[1:42:26] done and so we get back right God
[1:42:30] commands it watch that Union with us
[1:42:33] with him amen do you think he's on time
[1:42:36] always on time does he know what you got
[1:42:38] to go through he knows what you're going
[1:42:40] through will he make a way through it he
[1:42:43] has
[1:42:43] to amen and it'll always be by his word
[1:42:48] all right now verse chapter or
[1:42:51] paragraph 22 then Moses under the blood
[1:42:54] of bulls he met the light the pillar of
[1:42:55] fire in that burning bush and stood down
[1:42:57] there on a commission that God had given
[1:42:59] him and he was a prophet and when the
[1:43:01] word of the Lord came to him he spoke
[1:43:03] and even things were created by the word
[1:43:07] now watch and now verse 23 and now if it
[1:43:10] will do that under the blood of bulls
[1:43:12] what what about the blood of Jesus
[1:43:14] Christ not only covers but remits sin
[1:43:17] altogether and you stand in the presence
[1:43:19] of God as a redeemed son now see the
[1:43:22] church is far below its promised
[1:43:24] standard of
[1:43:27] living see see now we've grown up yes
[1:43:32] we're coming we real we're realizing it
[1:43:34] now see we're really coming into a
[1:43:36] maturity all right now he said but he's
[1:43:40] saying they're so far below they've got
[1:43:42] to grow other they got a greenness has
[1:43:44] got it baked out of them I think too
[1:43:45] many times we're probing instead of
[1:43:48] really coming out and facing the issue
[1:43:51] you all right
[1:43:55] now page
[1:44:00] 252 paragraph 45 he says remember if the
[1:44:05] truth is revealed I've already said this
[1:44:07] but say it again the truth is also
[1:44:10] Vindicated all right now now when Moses
[1:44:14] when Moses went out under the
[1:44:16] inspiration of god notice what he went
[1:44:18] out under the inspiration of God and
[1:44:20] said let flies come flies came right but
[1:44:26] who did he he Moses
[1:44:28] said but where' the inspiration come
[1:44:30] from Brother Braham said I've never saw
[1:44:32] a vision it was just an anointing come
[1:44:34] over me you need squirrels how many do
[1:44:37] you want say
[1:44:39] it see and many other times storm same
[1:44:43] way
[1:44:45] okay see he didn't move it and say it
[1:44:48] until he said say it but then the
[1:44:50] prophet out of his own mouth said
[1:44:52] it and you shall
[1:44:55] say Amen whatsoever you say then he
[1:44:59] didn't speak the word then he didn't he
[1:45:01] said and if he said let flies come and
[1:45:04] they didn't come then he didn't speak
[1:45:06] the word of the Lord he spoke his own
[1:45:08] word he might have thought there ought
[1:45:10] to be flies but no flies came because
[1:45:12] God hadn't told him
[1:45:14] so and when God tells you anything and
[1:45:17] says you go do this and I'll be right
[1:45:18] with you for this is my word and he
[1:45:21] shows it in the Bible then God stands
[1:45:23] right behind that and it's see it's
[1:45:25] revealed it's Vindicated stands right
[1:45:28] behind that it's not even written in the
[1:45:30] Bible if it's not even written in the
[1:45:32] Bible God stands behind it anyhow if
[1:45:35] it's God's word and then if it's outside
[1:45:37] of that it's revealed to prophets see
[1:45:40] you realize that all mysteries of God
[1:45:41] are made known to prophets and to them
[1:45:44] alone what do you do that
[1:45:46] for because God lord lord would do
[1:45:48] nothing but he reveals what he's going
[1:45:50] to to do is through his secrets of
[1:45:52] prophets he makes it manifest what's
[1:45:54] that ought to do to us gives us courage
[1:45:56] right because we are manifestors of that
[1:45:59] message that's why the message came amen
[1:46:03] we saw what God did he doesn't change
[1:46:06] okay
[1:46:08] now all right now I just let's
[1:46:12] see
[1:46:14] okay paragraph
[1:46:17] 50 okay I'm going to bypass some of this
[1:46:24] the word itself is Spirit it is Spirit
[1:46:27] in word form then you see when it's
[1:46:29] quickened it's brought to life and the
[1:46:31] spirit of the word goes to work in
[1:46:33] Acts he said look because look here a
[1:46:36] thought has to be a thought before it
[1:46:38] can be a word and then when a thought is
[1:46:41] presented it is a word now this Bible is
[1:46:45] God's thought that he has placed in the
[1:46:46] word and then we receive it what are we
[1:46:49] receiving we're receiving receiving the
[1:46:51] thought from him it becomes a
[1:46:54] word all right God revealed to Moses
[1:46:57] what to do and Moses spoke it and it
[1:47:00] happened that's when it really comes
[1:47:02] from God now we find out that stimulates
[1:47:05] that it gives Joy because it's God's
[1:47:07] word and the new wine stimulates when it
[1:47:09] reveals the word then it brings Joy
[1:47:11] beyond measure all
[1:47:15] right okay now let's go on I've just got
[1:47:19] just a couple more here
[1:47:23] 266 123 he says now we find him coming
[1:47:27] last night with his great sword let me
[1:47:30] just see here yeah sword of the word
[1:47:33] God's
[1:47:35] word the great sword we see him coming 1
[1:47:38] Thessalonians 2 and we also 2
[1:47:40] Thessalonians 2 we also see it in
[1:47:43] Revelations 19 he said he ALS he said
[1:47:47] out we find out that he also gets killed
[1:47:50] with the sword the sword of the word
[1:47:52] talking about the Antichrist God's word
[1:47:54] a sharp sword slays him puts him right
[1:47:57] down wait till those seven Thunders
[1:48:00] utter their voices have
[1:48:02] they are they yes all right to that
[1:48:06] group who is he speaking of to that
[1:48:09] group see to that group who really can
[1:48:13] take the word of God and hand it there
[1:48:15] it'll it will slice and cut they can
[1:48:18] close the heavens they can sh shut this
[1:48:20] or do that whatever they want to he said
[1:48:24] Glory he will be slain by the word that
[1:48:27] precedes from his mouth what's the Bible
[1:48:31] say the spirit of the Bride
[1:48:33] say she becomes the final voice yes all
[1:48:36] right where is it then all right where
[1:48:39] is this message where is that voice of
[1:48:43] the
[1:48:43] Resurrection all right it's sharper than
[1:48:46] any two-edged sword but they they again
[1:48:48] could call for a 100 billion milon tons
[1:48:50] of flies if they wanted to amen see what
[1:48:53] is it wanted to
[1:48:55] will what is the will of God his
[1:48:58] word okay whatever they're what whatever
[1:49:03] they say is going to happen because it's
[1:49:06] the word of God coming from the mouth of
[1:49:09] God Amen it's his word but he always
[1:49:12] uses man to work it amen God could call
[1:49:16] for those flies down in Egypt but he
[1:49:17] said Moses that's your job here's your
[1:49:20] Harmony now all right he said I'll tell
[1:49:24] you what to
[1:49:27] do will he tell us will he show us
[1:49:31] person individually will he show us it
[1:49:34] may be just as simple as in your in your
[1:49:37] home in your
[1:49:39] job where it is it may not it's not a
[1:49:42] public show brother
[1:49:43] sister amen amen it's not these things
[1:49:46] are not even known to the public it's
[1:49:48] not a public show but it's but but it's
[1:49:50] still being manifest whether it's they
[1:49:52] see it or don't see it or you see it
[1:49:55] alone all right it's always uses man to
[1:49:58] work it I'll just tell you what to do
[1:50:00] and you go do it he fully did that see
[1:50:03] and he chooses men all right now
[1:50:16] okay okay I'm not going to go there I've
[1:50:19] already gone that bleaches the sin out
[1:50:23] okay okay now one
[1:50:26] more I'm sorry I don't mean to well I've
[1:50:30] just I've just got to let you go here
[1:50:33] okay
[1:50:41] 214 I thought I was going to have a
[1:50:43] short time on
[1:50:44] this all right number 66 always we think
[1:50:48] that now watch this before being a word
[1:50:52] it is a thought I was coming right back
[1:50:54] to what he said before not the same
[1:50:56] quote and a thought has to be created
[1:51:00] how's the thought created through a word
[1:51:02] okay all right so God's thoughts became
[1:51:07] creation when they were spoken by a word
[1:51:10] so it's God's thoughts now watch what he
[1:51:13] says that's when he presents it to you
[1:51:17] as a
[1:51:18] thought
[1:51:21] his thoughts it's his thoughts and it's
[1:51:24] revealed to you then it's still a
[1:51:26] thought until you speak
[1:51:30] it
[1:51:33] amen on the inside of that Third Realm
[1:51:36] the next realm the Third Realm of the
[1:51:37] soul is predestinated by God that's
[1:51:40] where the real seed germ lays is in
[1:51:42] there that's our
[1:51:45] absolute that's our opinion all right
[1:51:50] all right
[1:51:51] now I'm
[1:51:53] closing now when it was now when it was
[1:51:57] now excuse me thou then if it was Jesus
[1:52:00] was the fullness of the of God
[1:52:02] manifested he was the fullness of the
[1:52:04] godhead
[1:52:05] bodily therefore when he came to the
[1:52:07] Earth was manifested in flesh you were
[1:52:09] in him
[1:52:16] then okay I've already read that quote I
[1:52:19] had a copy twice okay I'm sorry let's go
[1:52:21] on final thing now if we are those
[1:52:25] attributes of God this is things that
[1:52:26] are to be we cannot live by Creeds we
[1:52:30] cannot live by denominationalism we must
[1:52:32] live by the word because the Bride is a
[1:52:35] part of the bridegroom like any wife is
[1:52:38] a part of her husband therefore we must
[1:52:41] be that word
[1:52:44] bride and what is that word bride the
[1:52:47] manifestation of this hour
[1:52:54] my this day this promise it's
[1:53:01] fulfilled the bride not a Creed or
[1:53:04] denomination but a living Oracle what is
[1:53:07] the Oracle word a Living Word of God a
[1:53:11] living attribute of God displaying to
[1:53:14] the world the attributes of God watch
[1:53:19] displaying to the world the attributes
[1:53:21] of God in the formation of the Bride
[1:53:26] that's to be expressed in this hour that
[1:53:29] we are now
[1:53:31] living amen AM stand with
[1:53:35] me praise the
[1:53:44] Lord a lot more could have been said
[1:53:46] obviously there's all kinds of quotes to
[1:53:49] go with this
[1:53:50] everywhere and you know what I'm glad we
[1:53:53] see it that way brother Paul I'm glad
[1:53:55] the people see it that way because it's
[1:53:57] so personalized
[1:54:00] now you know I don't have to even read
[1:54:02] quotes we just say it right let the
[1:54:04] people if they're in the word they're
[1:54:06] going to receive it they're going to
[1:54:07] know it they know what you're talking
[1:54:08] about is that right that's right but
[1:54:11] each one of us brings a word a little
[1:54:12] differently a little different way of
[1:54:14] ministering it and so we've got to just
[1:54:16] remain in our position you know that's
[1:54:18] what God wants us to do
[1:54:20] get our position and stay there amen
[1:54:24] praise the Lord I want to sing that song
