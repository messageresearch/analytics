the Piller of fire leading the church of God again leading us back to the Bible leading us away from sin showing the resurrected savior showing himself alive again what we have is the p Pillar of Fire Burning in the hearts of men the early church had the pillar of fire leading each and every day showing to all of the Sinners that Jesus is the only way without the blood there is no salvation without the spirit there is no life what we have is the pillar of fire oh it's burning in our hearts tonight what we have is the pillar of fire leading the Church of God again leading us back to the Bible leading us away from sin showing the resurrected savior showing bring himself alive again what we have is the pillar of fire burning in the hearts of men seen that one more time oh what we have is the

burning in the hearts of men what we have the last one oh what we have is the pillar fire amen aren't you glad of that fire same fire that was in the bush there with Abraham you know we look at that and realize that no matter where we're at amen the Lord promised to be with us and he has never failed a promise yet and so we say thank you is it okay to call you brother Daniel awesome okay good to see you here tonight brother Daniel Amen Hallelujah each and every one of you so good to see you we um I'm hoping to just be on the short side this evening so uh we'll just Dive Right In thank you musicians so very much um brother Alex thank you amen let's just stand and turn in our Bibles The Book of John the 14th chapter verses 8-14 now as we look at this we'll we'll find I I preached last week you know proving the word in you and that is really us uh seeing that God is faithful seeing how that God has has never come short and look how Satan he tries so hard I mean he puts overtime into getting you and I to doubt the word and what he's really doing is getting us to doubt the word that's in US amen the devil will say well of course they're spiritual people they're living very overcoming lives but you see what what we don't see is their battle now let's think about job it was only those in job's community that even understood or saw what was happening with job over the hill and down the corner and around by the river they had no clue what was happening in job's life but God was proving himself in job and it affected those around him but the real story uh you know the devil doesn't say well it's the Community Job lives it's was job amen and so God is here to prove to you and I that he is here now tonight I'd just like to touch on this just for a few minutes God's wanting to prove that you're the word amen he he doesn't want us to be parrots now I you know I used to do a pretty good imitation of Paulie the Parrot uh and and uh you know I won't do that tonight but but um you know if we're not careful we become parrots and and um God never called us to be a parrot he called us to be sons of God Warriors Amen to be vigilant with the word believer strong called the Saints and so we want to take that and you know just tonight sometimes it's good just to stir up our Pure minds and Remembrance right sometimes really really really good deeps preaching is awesome sometimes just stirring up our Pure Minds just to be reminded that that um you know this is who I am and and uh there's plenty of evidence Saints there's just insurmountable amount of evidence that we are Sons and Daughters of God yeah until we forget we are and then all the evidence is out there and all the evidence applies to someone else and it's everybody else's family that's Overcomers and and we're struggling and we're having mind battles and mental struggles and feel like we're oppressed depressed suppressed and and in that case right there we've just completely forgotten that we're the word and God just wants to remind you I believe a little bit tonight that's to remember that no matter what comes your way uh to to keep uh God between you and your circumstance and not let your circumstance become between you and God and and when we will keep the word between us and our circumstance uh suddenly the reflection of the word I don't remember who who gave that example here recently we were doing that but uh when the word is right here what can you see when it's right here but when the word is distant we see everything else around us and so by God's grace we'll amen just have a little enjoyable time tonight John 148 Philip saith unto him Lord show us the father and it suffices us Jesus saith to him have I been so long time with you could we just apply that tonight has he been so long time with us yes sir that we still forget and yet hast thou not known me Phillip he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father believest thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for very Works sake believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very Works sake verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son and if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it amen Heavenly Father we thank you tonight just Lord just give us inspiration anointing to just share what's on our heart bless the Saints tonight and those that are not with us whether they be traveling father or whatever the circumstance might be father we just ask you to speak to Hearts bless them strengthen them keep them in your precious name amen you may be seated amen as we look at this tonight you know uh I want to just represent this as a an opinion so that we can reflect on it uh in our own personal ways but we could by Revelation actually be able to say you know the Jesus didn't just say this but these are our words these are our words tonight that uh he has uh come and we believe that we're in the father and the father is in us and and uh we believe the words that have been spoken to us and they're not of ourself we're not speaking words that is our words when we talk about you know being Victorious or an overcomer or any language like that we could never say I did that myself but it's actually the father in me that has come and has enabled me to do this now we could come at this point right now and the devil would say well but you still make mistakes but my brother and sister God said it's finished and he said it's perfect and we just have to sit back and say you know what this is the truth I I believe these words that come from my lips that that I'm a Son of God that I'm a daughter of God that I'm going to be victorious in this Christian walk I I'm not as one man put it he said God didn't call me out here to be Canon fod for the devil and so it's there that we stand up and we stand upon the word and we believe that and you know it comes down and I I I didn't know any way but I'll just kind of Spill the Beans a little bit tonight uh real quick here uh you know I say unto you verse 12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father now my brother and sister when it is greater some people have interpreted that that this bride is going to uh have a Ministry that would outshine Jesus Christ but this is not so it is a greater work my brother and sister for the word to become manifested in you and I and prophecy in word form is wonderful can we say Amen to that to see the word in word form but how much greater it is when the word form becomes living form amen that we come to the place that we are standing here today living the very words that Jesus spoke and that is a greater form we won't go into that it's actually a very broad topic uh a lot to it but my brother and sister The Works that Jesus did he overcome he spoke the word he was the word made flesh all of these attributes that we can attribute to our lord Jesus and he said that we're going to come and we're going to do that in this day in an age that's dark a age that is ugly age that is so deceptive and yet we're going to come and live out every word that our lord Jesus prophesied every word that the apostles prophesied every bit of this through the Old Testament that was prophesied we get the privilege and let's focus on that word for a moment it is not we are just here and are obligated or anything attached it is a privilege this gift of life in this age that God has given us is clearly a privilege of the uh gift he's given amen and I say thank you Lord because verse 13 my brother and sister now I believe we have testimonies amongst us but I I think that we should be looking into a a greater portion of this to ask the Lord not for an evidence for our own self but as it would be that we would have a greater understanding in Revelation to live out the word and he said whatsoever ye shall ask in my name I don't know about each one of you but there's been times in my life that I won't elaborate because of time but there's been times in my my life that I in desperation cried out to God and sometimes I know I've shared to the church here at time in my youth with a pickup on on a slick Road and over in the edge of a canyon and one Little Rock holding a vehicle up my brother and sister I tell you today whatsoever you ask in his name do we have the faith to apply that amen see that should be really not to become a Doctrine my brother and sister unfortunately Humanity always wants to make things a Doctrine but this should be a Cornerstone of our life to know with confidence and stand in that to move forward that whatever we ask that he will answer it amen that he will do and so it's there he turns around and repeats it again in verse 14 if you ask anything in my name I will do it amen now don't misunderstand me tonight because I'm not talking about playing some kind of mind game with the Lord cuz we don't do that but I I want to challenge you to take that and apply that that I have full expectation if I ask for the right reasons now what we're asking my brother and sister is not for temporal things we're not asking for carnal things but yet I think Brother Rich cob uh has a testimony of his childhood that uh they were in very Dire Straits as a family I think many of you have heard this testimony haven't you and and brother Rich's dad says you you kids write down what it would be like what you would want uh for for food and whatever and I remember Brother Rich you know with just the way brother rich is he he says you know and I just love that thick sliced bacon and he says so I specifically wrote that down and not just bacon but I want thick sliced bacon and as they are praying over these things there's a knock on the door a and uh Brother Richard senior doesn't quit praying but when they're finished they go to the door and there's no one there but bags of groceries and everything they had placed on that list was there am my brother and sister we know Brother Rich sister charity right we're not talking about people that are flighty and and just go with a good story we're talking about solid Believers and yet Brother Rich always gets just this little Glee in there he goes and there was that thick sliced bacon and he said I was so happy but then his dad being faithful turned around and says now how could this be that before we even done praying for it God's answered it oh my brother and sister how we should have that kind of confidence maybe not just always for thick sliced bacon but it's time that we come to a place that we say I have a need in my own life I have a need in my family my children somewhere an extended family we have a need in the body of Believers it's time for us to take God at his word and step out and say he said it and I am a Son of God and his jeans amen the very lifeblood of the token is flowing in me and so therefore I have the confidence to step up and say Lord I'm asking in your name now I have expectation and God is faithful Can someone say Amen into that Hallelujah you know sometimes you you interact with with people uh that are not even Christians you might I don't know uh I don't know how to classify them maybe we'll just for the sake of the conversation say they're agnostics or atheists or something of that nature and they'll ask you a question like so okay Paul you you believe God's right here prove it my brother and sister could we actually this evening pull some proof out of our pocket and lay it down before a agnostic or an atheist and say this is my proof of being a Christian no it's no wonder this world is tipping in the balance because they want proof now I want to ask you guys tonight do we have proof that we're Christians absolutely it's not something that you know just uh tangible to the unbeliever but we have proof within ourself because it comes as it would be in the form of faith and because God has proven himself over and over and over and over again we have numerous answered prayers we have healings we have deliverances we have all of this and for the believer we look at that and say that's proof I don't need anything else I I don't need some some you know evidence that could go to the Supreme Court court because uh the real Supreme Court has already declared it to be truth amen and so as we look at this we live in such a a age of limbo that that to the unbeliever they're looking for something as it is that they could pick up and could hold and examine and that would be their proof but yet in The Believer now that man that spoke to brother Bram says I just can't believe that and brother bram's resp response was not not being snarky not being disrespectful but he says yes that's right because it's only for believers and we're here tonight as Believers believing that our God answers prayers and we have real tangible evidence amen now the court of the world won't accept that but as we said here and we would say how would I prove uh I I'm a Christian would it be by attending church no would it be by we confess that we're Christians would it be a certain action that we sing and shout and dance all of these are true they're all part of a picture they're all part of the overall and so it is it still comes down that the proof that the world's looking for you may or may not produce because we'll be shocked and I I don't want to really go into naming names but there's still even in this day Ministries out here that are having healings and deliverances and all of the things that are considered the signs of it being truth but we look at this my brother and sister it's not uh uh that we have these things that I named off you know we're we're faithful in church we should be we should be faithful in church amen and we should be confessing Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior amen and there will be certain actions or lack of certain actions that will show that God is dealing with us and as you do you know you look at these things and and um there's a man I've known for many many years and and I hope you catch why I'm sharing this uh this man um done quite a bit of business with him through the years and and he was having health problems goes to the doctor the doctor says you have lung cancer and they said and we we you you quit smoking entirely it will extend your life a period of time uh uh and if you don't uh we believe you'll be dead within 6 months and so he quits smoking changes a lot of things and he goes back in a year or he's back in there a year later and he asked the doctor he said you know uh am I better and the doctor said no you you misunderstand you you're never getting better we're just trying to extend your life and he said if this is not going to change me I'm going back and he went right back to a chain smoker died just a few days ago now my brother and sister you look at that and let me turn this into a spiritual aspect sometimes we serve God because we think he's going to make everything better and when he doesn't make it better we start to revert back but what God says is I want you to believe whether you see a difference in the physical body I want you to believe if you still have doubts I want you to believe if you still have fear I want you to believe if you still have weakness in your flesh uh those besetting I want you to believe because it's not a matter of what the flesh says but it's what the soul claims what the position the soul is in and when I say claim it's not just claim it you know name it and claim it but it's still the seed that's in there and so it's there that sometimes these these parts are just part of a bigger picture and and I I as I was studying or thinking through on this you know how many times he that believeth right sister now you have there's a voice of the Prophet now sister you have this and if you'll only believe did he promise them long life did he promise them anything no but he's talking about rebuking a spirit of cancer or or depressions or what and and he's attaching that to believing and then critics say well they went from there and nothing changed must have been the prophet's fault no he was only in that intermediary it was actually God speaking amen people think oh if you if you just believe that's what that's what brother brandham said if you'll just believe my brother and sister that was God talking to them telling them if you can just have enough faith in my word then I will come on the scene but the truth is my brother and sister many times people their faith is temporary I've been there I can tell you it's a truth your faith is temporary and and Circumstance then comes between you and the word and and you revert right back if it's not going to change me immediately then I I just fall back to where I was before and you see what we're looking at is proving the word my brother and sister how do we prove the word do we have a whole list of actions you know many years ago there was some brothers pastors that would have a ledger you might say or book in the in their church and they were faithful to record every answered prayer every Deliverance every healing they Faithfully wrote it down as a record and that's wonderful but when you handed that record to someone who didn't believe it didn't mean one thing to them but when you handle handed the record to a Believer they would open that and they would go oh I remember when this sister got healed oh I remember when this young man got saved oh I remember and it stirred hard and Faith rose up and they're like praise God but it took something more than just a record it took an anointing it took a seed and someone that said I believe I believe these seems small but you know this incredible action that God does you know it's not necessarily seen by the eye we look out here and someone comes to the altar when we were on our little trip up in Canada there was a brother come to the altar felt led to go down and pray with him I didn't have any great overwhelming inspiration to declar to the world that praise God whatever your need is it's going to happen I just prayed Lord here he is Father his family circumstances Lord you know I don't have a clue but I'm binding my faith with this brother later the pastor told me he says it's actually a miracle he even came down to the altar did he have to get up and jump and shout and run away no but I got to visit with this brother just and he he didn't really share the whole picture to me but he shared part of the picture and my brother and sister it'd be something that was a heavy burden upon a man and yet he said I got up from there and he said I just knew in the end I would be victorious I knew God would answer this need you know we just call that something simple would have been better if a leg would have been lengthened or or something like that no I tell you my brother sister in the world we live in and Satan and his influence that's a miracle when a man goes to an altar wondering do I just quit what do I do nothing's changing and gets up from that altar saying you know what this is all going to work out just fine amen so what are we looking what is the proof of being a Christian God answers every prayer No in fact it might ought to make you nervous if God answers every prayer because our ways my brother and sister the scripture says sometimes they just Wicked you know it it's there that we don't always have the best judgment and if God just answered that prayer and we would say yep there it is but you see sometimes God lets us labor through things amen I know that the Lord does that for me and and you labor through that and by the time you get to where you would say you haven't answered prayer your perspective of the whole situation has changed entirely you know it's not even the same desire upon your heart they not the same reflection on the word and God has done that he knew that by laboring with that so it's not necessarily something that's seen with the eye but in the finished work it is seen by all that every one of us are not the same person the you of 10 years ago is not the you of today and the you of Tomorrow will not be the you of today my brother and sister God is an ontime prayer answering God and so just ask you just my le do any of you ever kind of get bombarded and start to feel like maybe you're misunderstood and maybe you're not really a Believer after all cuz surely it wouldn't be so hard if I'm a Son of God it wouldn't be so hard but the scripture speaks very plainly that if we don't receive correction we're bastard children and it is that as of In the Flesh as we would ask we would ask a miss and God is doing that not to cause us to doubt who we are but to temper us like fine steel to be able to deal with the things of this world the Temptation the trial the struggle all of that is here and and when God is using that we know for a fact we can see out of scripture that God tests with time and there is many people that are good people still living good moral lives that have quit being Christians because it should have all happened by now and the scripture deals with that also and so as we look at that that how God is testing us in every way and form now some brothers we were talking the other day and you know when you think about it you can purify Gold by extreme heat and you can also purify Gold by folding it over and pounding it and folding it over again and pounding it tonight I say this with humor so you all look at this who wants to be purified amen you're either going to have some fiery trials or you're going to get pounded but the end is you'll be pure and that's what God's looking for and so let's be careful not to look at one and say wow they're going through the fire I wonder what's wrong with them maybe we should say they're going through the fire praise God look what's right with them amen and they getting pounded over here and you say wow you know I wonder see like joob what's the secret sin but maybe God's folding them over and the last time he folds them over he can declare they're pure gold amen it's all in our perspective I know that in my own flesh Saints I'll just say this when the pounding comes I often start looking for what did I do wrong what did I do wrong but maybe God wants us to stop and say praise God I'm being pounded amen it's for the benefit and the glory of God Amen I don't want to come before god with a dull image I want to come as pure gold with his reflection Amen Let me hurry along here so we don't get too too stretched out in Luke 8 5-11 the scriptures talking about I'll just preach it instead of reading it all the the scripture is talking about a sewer went out sewed seed and some fell by the wayside and it gets trod down fouls of the air some fell on rocks and and uh it was wasn't the right conditions and it Withers uh some fell amongst thorns and Thorns sprang up choked it other fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruit a h hundredfold now look at this my brother and sister we'll look at this and realize as we know as a parable this is not dirt that they're talking about this is a condition of the Soul amen we can be hard and Rocky bitter whatever that might be we can be in a position where everyone has done us wrong we be in a position where nothing in our life is going good and all of those rocks that are there that we are are stumbling and struggling over will actually choke the presence of God the word out of our life because what Springs up is bitterness and so as we let bitterness spring up bitterness feeds bitterness amen they say that the more that we we uh uh fall under that anointing of bitterness brother Lonnie Jenkins talked about this many years ago did research on it that people that have that Spirit end up with more disease and sickness and and those kind of things uh mental and physical and and so look at that correlation no wonder Satan it wouldn't be just to break a relationship here and there but Satan's also destroying the very individual that's carrying that atmosphere and so you look how clever Satan is that this seed falling in the roadside amongst the rocks and the Thorns my brother and sister it not only affects those around them it kills them right certainly kills a word in their life amen and the good ground of the Soul uh the seed Springs up and bears fruit now my brother and sister I want you to understand that this is all the same seed so as it is God did not have a special seed for you or I and everyone else gets a seed that's that's uh going to be less than 100% you know when we plant seed in the spring we we to adjust a planter you have a bushel weight cup that you measure it with and let me just tell you in the natural not all seed is equal and I hope you follow me because I don't want to sound like I'm contradicting myself but in the spiritual not all seed is equal right the seed that God drops into the heart soul of the bride of Christ is a pure seed amen it's vibrant it's strong it's got if I could put it to you in Farmer terms it's got enough starch when that Sprouts it's got enough starch to push it up out of the darkness into the light amen and then we as Sons and Daughters of God say wow thank you Lord how did I ever come out of that past life it's because that seed was the right seed for the right soil in the right season under the right conditions and if you want to get technical and Agronomy we could keep going on to the right right right what is right what is right what is right what is right and can we say tonight praise God we have come under the right condition to be Sons and Daughters of God and rise up with the word bringing forth life in us but it's not about just bringing forth the life all through the scripture The Parables also type that that seed must bring forth of its own kind and we often look at that is to judge well okay if that seed is this it must bring this seed but if it was good seed in the soil it must be good seed that is reproduced right cuz good seed will not if everything is done correct which is under the leadership of the Holy Spirit if it's done correct it's not going to bring shriveled seed it's going to bring good seed amen good seed has that ability to come up out of that now my brother and sister not to sound like I'm contradicting the word but if you plant real good seed you can plant it in less than ideal conditions and it will still reproduce itself you plant shriveled seed in ideal conditions and it will not reproduce itself amen see how God's working through you and I amen so how do we come and prove we're Son of God a daughter of God called before the foundation of the world how do we prove it drink and grow drink and grow drink and grow that could be very repetitious sermon couldn't it drink and grow you see we're not trying to outgrow someone you know what I mean it'd be like sitting there as long as I'm more spiritual than they are then they they got nothing to do with your equation it's all for you and I how do we prove we drink and we grow and if we don't drink we don't grow and if we drink and don't grow we still have a problem see it's got to all come together and be balanced and so as we look at this amen as it is in verse 11 the parable is this the seed is the word of God the very same word would touch one man and change his life and make another man bitter but by God's grace tonight I think we can lift a hand and say thank you Lord The Good Seed has come to the soil and we have been blessed by the water of the word and the presence of the son and it's caused us to come forth and how do we know that it's good seed because its life will grow and reflect it one wheat doesn't grow up and say I'm taller than you or I'm better than you wheat produces wheat and good wheat produces a Bountiful Harvest Amen Let me just hurry along here are we doing okay amen John 10 uh 24-30 now we're looking at at another uh uh interaction that is showing uh of uh the correct seed the correct life uh a approving of the word then came the Jews round about him Jesus and said unto him how long Dost thou make us to doubt if thou be the Christ tell us plainly so we're seeing that the word and the action and the display is in front of them a and uh they're they're wanting to know we need you to tell us plainly but Jesus answers them and says I told you see they're still looking for confirmation and Jesus is standing there saying I already told you so they did not have that ability to receive what was spoke and Jesus comes down and pariz this in a way and and uh you know so they're sitting there saying um you know we need proof is really what they're saying I need some proof of what you said is really the fact Jesus said I told you and you believed it not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me now let's deviate for just a moment here every one of us is bearing witness correct and let's not look at the Flesh and say I I've feel like this and I feel like that or I feel they and that my brother and sister every one of us has a struggle every one of us if someone looked at our life too closely would realize there's there's still faults there there's still struggle there there's still there but what God is doing in in spite of that is making us witnesses that he chose amen we were visiting sister Jerry and I today remember the little story in you know the man's carrying his cross and he tells the Lord I I can't bear this cross any longer I I need a I need a lighter cross and he goes in there and sets his cross down and goes around and comes in the other door you're familiar with it and looks in the room in the smallest cross in the room and he picks it up and the Lord speaks to him and says that was your cross but you know if he had picked a greater cross he'd have still been able to bear it God didn't bring us here for us to fail he didn't bring us here to reject us and if he's called us to a big cross he'll give us the ability to carry a big cross and if we're called to a little cross a small cross not so weighty well instead of complaining about the weight of that cross maybe we should thank God and pray for the guy who's carrying the big cross but let's understand this sometimes that cross that we think is so little is all that individual can bear that's right and they are proving themsel in God's eyes by bearing that cross just as much as this brother or sister is proving in God's eyes by bearing a much heavier cross you see it's all about who we are and God's chosen plan for us and God says I know know what you can handle and I won't lay anything more upon you that's right amen I think it would do us well to remember that now Jesus speaking to him and says I told you you didn't believe me and uh uh I come and do in my father's name they bear witness of me but you believe not because you're not my sheep now imagine religious guys are saying what's sheep got to do with this but to you and I we understand perfectly the analogy or the breakdown of of sheep and you're not my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me my this is Jesus in a nutshell I could in my thought tonight just close it down right here my brother and sister this is it in the nut sh the sheep hear the voice amen there's relationship there and they follow amen so it's not sheep as it is that they heard some noise and they went and did what they wanted to do right but the Sheep once they have been identified they want to be with their Master amen and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish and neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand and that ought to give us great Assurance right there amen that's something worth following and never betray us never leave us abandon us amen amen My Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hands I and my father are one amen you see my brother and sister they had enough spiritual vision to see and even look at that and say are you the Christ so they weren't entirely spiritually blind but they just didn't want to believe they saw the signs and wonders they saw everything that happened look at the world we're in right now I don't want to get Negative here but if you just do some rudimentary uh um investigation you'll find that even amongst the denominations they're starting to have this grave concern at the direction they're going I believe that was Massachusetts that a pastor back there their denomination has a rainbow flag in their church and um this pastor stood up and said this absolutely against the word and I will not support it and in less than a couple hours he was no longer a pastor no longer part of that denomination no longer allowed to associate you see they don't want to believe no that's right that's and it's not just the rainbow and that kind of stuff but this book now they're preaching it is just ideas you see my brother and sister quite a difference between the bride of Christ that says this is the absolute word of God Amen and we can prove that we are Sons and Daughters of God because we're willing to take and go where the absolute tells us to go amen but if you're not his sheep so on one side we have those that are proving they're not sheep and we got those on the other side proving they are sheep now I want to ask you those that were hearing jesus' voice and following him you think they walked around and said we have the Vindication we're his sheep they were following truth that's right it was not hey we've got this great thing but to them these were the words of life amen aren't you glad tonight that God is dealing with you and I exactly the same pattern we're not going out here to prove we are better or we're anything but we can stand with confidence that we have the words of life amen you know I could have cut this sermon down really really short you know and just said hey look just say Amen to every word of God and live it and you're proving that you are but that wouldn't have been no fun would it amen maybe I should shouldn't ask that question but to bring it to utter Simplicity we need to hear we need to believe and we need to follow it really is much simpler than many people say they'll tell you I can't live this well my brother and sister just stop listen believe and follow it really comes down fairly simple and on a deeper level my brother and sister we come to the place you know 1 Corinthians 12 many of you will know that scripture wherefore I give unto you to understand that no man speaketh by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost you see how it is that God is dealing with you and I now you say there's lots of people say that that that uh uh we believe that we we agree 100% with that uh uh you know we see how wonderful the Lord is but we got to remember my brother and sister that to prove we really believe we have to live that word and so it's there in that realm that the hard work if you want to call it that starts easy right sweet in the mouth bitter in the belly but praise God there's something about this bride of Christ real Christians in this day God didn't take away the bitterness my brother and sister he did not say oh you just eat the word and everything's just going to be so wonderful but he's put something in us I like to use licorice for an example the old licorice root licorice some people just like oh that stuff is horrible tasting now if you don't like it I'm not typing this spiritually so don't don't but that those that there's something in our makeup that you eat that old licorice root Licorice and the minute you finish the one piece you're reaching for another and you can say well that's how I feel about licorice even now that's because you're addicted to Sugar so it's the sugar that's calling you back yeah but that old licorice root if there was something in you that liked that that it you just can't stop eating it in fact that makes me want to go get some but look my brother and sister how wonderful the Lord is to us because we eat the word now let's be honest with each other tonight I every one of us in here we eat the word and it brings sometimes bitterness it brings that that that hard taste that hard thing in our life but you'll find yourself going right back to the the word again and you'll find yourself consuming more of it and you deal with it and what it does is that word is bringing us to the place that because we cannot resist the word we consume more and more and more of it and does that always take away I had somebody here just tell me the other day sister Jerry and I fellowshipping with this individual and they were talking about I'm just stunned that here I am after all these years of serving God I still sometimes have a temper tantrum sound familiar anyone would we look at that individual and say well you're not a Believer yet no what it is they're eating the book and God's making it to where they recognize the preacher don't have to get down there you have a temper tantrum they themselves are saying I want rid of this I want free from this and then I picked up my Bible and was reading entirely different scripture in a whole different area and there it was all over again and then I went back to my Bible and I ate and there it was again see how God's dealing with us he's drawing us back to eat the book again and again we're not one time read the book Christians we eat the book until God has completely purged us changed us brought us forth amen I have a really long quote here that I I want to shorten so amen would be in the uh patmas Vision I want to shorten this here that's the way the church is the vine has been split the limbs have been grafted in they grafted in Baptist limbs Methodist limbs Presbyterian limbs Pentecostal limbs message Limbs and those limbs were bearing Baptist Methodist Pentecostal and Presbyterian and message fruit oh I'm sorry my I'm reading my notes in there probably get me kicked out of the fellowship or the Brotherhood but my brother and sister the same Spirits crept in and you're a Believer if well I'm here to clarify tonight what it is you're a Believer if God says you are amen it might take you down a rough and rocky road but if God called you God said he'll keep you amen and he will not lose a one we don't need to say who's in who's out who can and who can't we need to stop and say Lord just want to make sure I am that's right want to make sure I am amen so I want to skip down a little bit now you see it wasn't grafted into the vine it was born in the vine and when those other branches were grafted in all they could do was Bear their own fre fruit for they were not born of that vine they don't know about that original life and original Fruit they cannot know for they were not born of it if they had been born of it the same life that was in the original stem Jesus had come through them and manifested through them he said verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go into my father denom Nations brother Bram says it this way which are M directed cannot be born of God for it is the spirit not man that gives life how thrilling it is to think of those seven lamps drawing life and light from the resources of that Main Bowl because they had their Wicks dipped therein each Church AG messenger is depicted here his life is on fire with the Holy Ghost his Wick life has been immersed in Christ though the wick through the wick he was drawing the very Life of Christ and by it it gives out the light to the church what kind of light is he giving the same light that was in the first lamp that was lit wow that's very same word yeah now I want to ask you are we any less important than them no sir no sir amen God has provided for our every need sister V would you come and right onto the ages to the present time of the last day messenger of the same life and the same light is manifested by life oh we were talking about proving that you're the word yeah let me re rad this right here right on down the ages to the present time of the last day messenger the same life and the same life is manifested by a life that is hid amen with Christ in God amen well what are you trying to say brother Paul I believe the evidence that we're real Believers is in the hiding amen for hidden leoda yeah won't work but if we're hid in Christ amen we're seeing the proof of what God is doing in this age and I thank God that he allows us to be hid amen completely Amen in him Hallelujah not real deep tonight Saints but just want to encourage you amen let's just keep hiding ourselves Hallelujah keep hiding ourselves in the word in the life and the Lord will make it all come amen amen we'll skip over some of this last stuff here amen I want to sing ancient words amen as I just come across that song uh it is uh 8:35 amen God bless you Saints look I hope you don't mind busy time certain circumstances so I hope it made sense amen as I pondered on this it's like Lord if I had to prove I was a Christian if I died my brother and sister if I just said okay I'm going to prove I'm a Christian I'll die for the gospel doesn't mean my soul is saved just cuz you died Amen in 10 Church remember I I I I thought it was wonderful I'm not being negative about this but I read an article about this lady who's 85 years old was born in this church back in I think West Virginia and she had not missed a service in 85 years that make her the bride of Christ we just got to find God's provided the solution he's provided the word he's provided everything for us hallelujah amen holy word let's stand Worship the Lord for a moment preserve for our walk in this world they ReSound with
