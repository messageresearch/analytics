[38:11] god bless you sister vika
[38:13] amen saints uh just happy to bring
[38:16] greetings to you from the believers in
[38:18] salt lake city
[38:20] we traveled down there last weekend to
[38:22] visit
[38:24] an old friend brother fabian palma
[38:27] from chile and
[38:30] and
[38:31] i guess i had an inkling of that but we
[38:33] got down there and were fellowshipping
[38:35] and they said oh
[38:37] we have decided
[38:40] that you're preaching tomorrow
[38:42] and uh so i traveled down there because
[38:44] i wanted to hear my brother fabian
[38:46] minister and
[38:47] and uh just a lovely time um
[38:50] i was really happy jolin and leah went
[38:52] with us uh sister jolin made a great
[38:54] interpreter
[38:56] and uh just helped many conversations
[38:58] and just
[39:00] just a lovely time amen and
[39:03] so we're just looking forward um
[39:06] as it is just uh
[39:08] i want to take a moment brother jason
[39:10] sent out a text this morning does anyone
[39:12] have a special song or a testimony and
[39:16] i don't think that sister jerry and i
[39:18] are trying to hog everything but
[39:20] you know i just i'll just share this
[39:23] with you because to me it's a very
[39:25] significant event that took place during
[39:28] harvest and uh
[39:30] we were uh working uh one day there in a
[39:33] field that the corn had got pretty dry
[39:36] in an uh a portion of it and
[39:39] as we're harvesting there and and one of
[39:42] the guys come on the radio and said paul
[39:44] i i think there's smoke coming out of
[39:46] your chopper
[39:48] and
[39:49] so you know i pulled it to a halt there
[39:52] and backed up away from the corn
[39:55] and i started to get out and
[39:58] i realized we had a serious problem and
[40:00] i shut it off
[40:01] and needless to say saints when i
[40:03] climbed down
[40:05] and run around the front of it the
[40:06] flames were coming out from underneath
[40:10] and you're like
[40:11] oh my
[40:12] what do you do
[40:14] but uh three fire extinguishers and
[40:16] everybody that was there's
[40:19] bottle of water amen about 30 bottles of
[40:22] water and three fire extinguishers later
[40:25] we had it put out
[40:26] uh you know it's amazing
[40:29] i've had this happen before in my life
[40:31] that god's god's touched me in this
[40:33] fashion
[40:34] uh but i burnt my left hand
[40:37] and
[40:39] you know it hurt
[40:41] but in a couple days no hide fell off
[40:44] nothing a couple days it was just fine
[40:47] and uh by god's grace
[40:49] it did just
[40:51] very minimal damage to the machine
[40:54] and
[40:55] then god said well i tested you there
[40:57] and saw how you reacted and so two days
[41:00] later the machine did it again
[41:02] and uh but guys god
[41:06] very minimal damage once again and then
[41:08] the lord showed us uh
[41:11] what the problem was because you see we
[41:12] can have natural problems
[41:15] and we can seek for natural answers
[41:19] and sometimes we can't even find them in
[41:22] the natural
[41:23] you can't find the reason why but the
[41:25] lord is good
[41:27] and we take that over into the spiritual
[41:29] and realize sometimes we have things
[41:31] troubling in our life
[41:32] the water's being stirred and we're not
[41:35] able as it were to get into the water
[41:37] and we wonder why lord but you know the
[41:40] thing is he is faithful
[41:43] and he has come
[41:45] and he has an answer for you and i and
[41:48] his answers are always in the right
[41:50] season his answers are in the right
[41:52] timing
[41:53] that doesn't mean
[41:55] that you don't have to go through the
[41:57] fire it doesn't mean that you don't have
[41:59] to face the troubling times that uh
[42:02] discouraging things but i just wanted to
[42:05] share that uh
[42:06] if i could share the adrenaline and
[42:09] whatever that was there with you you'd
[42:11] be all jumping up and down shouting
[42:12] right now because um
[42:14] you can get quite excited
[42:16] but uh you know it's by god's grace
[42:19] right everything we do in this life is
[42:20] by god's grace and and uh you know we we
[42:24] just stand and and i i won't go into the
[42:26] deeper uh side of this as it is uh but
[42:31] you know sometimes you
[42:33] i think we go through life and we say
[42:35] lord are you or you hear me lord am i
[42:38] am i
[42:41] do you see what's happening in my life
[42:42] lord
[42:45] and then god comes and says
[42:47] i'll let you know
[42:49] that i'm right here with you i'll let
[42:51] you know that i'm walking with you i'll
[42:53] let you know that i'm on the scene
[42:56] and i'm fighting on your behalf and i
[42:58] have answers for you and i have
[43:00] encouragement for you and i have
[43:02] strength for you and and uh you say
[43:05] we're both paul these things are like in
[43:06] the natural yes but the prophet of god
[43:08] showed us so clearly the natural types
[43:11] of spiritual and that we can see these
[43:13] things happening in our life and and uh
[43:16] we're thankful for the lord let's stand
[43:18] today
[43:19] i would like to speak to you once again
[43:22] oh by the way please remember me if i
[43:24] sound a little weird this morning it's
[43:26] because i've been fighting this
[43:27] congestion my ears are plugged and
[43:31] i joked with sister jerry this morning i
[43:33] said i think i'll call in sick
[43:35] and
[43:37] anyway
[43:39] so i have called in sick and my head is
[43:42] plugged and every time i speak it
[43:43] vibrates
[43:45] but praise the lord
[43:47] i'm already healed
[43:48] i'm already delivered in fact the vision
[43:51] of walking on the hills of glory is
[43:53] becoming clearer every single day
[43:56] amen i can see i can see more clearly
[43:59] now
[44:00] amen and i thank the lord for that amen
[44:03] i want to speak to you this morning by
[44:05] my spirit saith the lord amen and and
[44:09] this is a very common scripture
[44:11] uh in uh zachariah the fourth chapter
[44:15] let's turn there verses one through six
[44:18] and as we look at this my brother and
[44:20] sister i i um
[44:23] well you know sometimes i just have to
[44:25] ask jerry as we're maybe driving home
[44:27] from church did this even make sense
[44:30] and uh you know it's my prayer
[44:33] that i wouldn't come to you
[44:35] as paul said you know with great flowing
[44:37] words of wisdom
[44:39] that everyone would say that was that
[44:41] was so intellectually stimulating but we
[44:45] want to come
[44:46] in the spirit of christ we want to come
[44:48] in the word and and uh just to be able
[44:51] to take those words and speak them out
[44:54] and then let god amen now i hope this
[44:57] makes sense to you but a man can speak
[44:59] those words out and often times the
[45:02] carnal will criticize and say i don't
[45:04] even understand what they were talking
[45:05] about but god takes those words and by
[45:08] the time they come down to you he has
[45:10] set them in order
[45:12] and in your heart you say praise the
[45:14] lord that's the word of god i just read
[45:16] that scripture i just i just read that
[45:19] quote uh god just spoke to me in the
[45:21] midnight hour on that right there but
[45:23] the carnal man
[45:25] says well he he jumped here and he
[45:27] jumped there and it didn't even make any
[45:28] sense and not very articulate i was just
[45:31] reading a a age-old criticism of the
[45:34] prophet of god
[45:35] and i thought this is interesting as all
[45:38] of these critics quote the same people
[45:43] they have no new voice but they're all
[45:46] quoting the same negative voice
[45:49] right because you know why they do that
[45:52] because there's only one true negative
[45:53] voice in the land and that's satan
[45:56] and so when they come up and disagree or
[45:59] rebel against the word of god ultimately
[46:02] you'll find now this sounds like a harsh
[46:03] criticism but ultimately you'll come
[46:05] back and see that they're really just
[46:07] quoting satan
[46:09] because if it was anything but satan
[46:12] they would be saying that's the word and
[46:13] we need to line up
[46:15] so they're all going back but you know
[46:17] the prophet of god just speaking in such
[46:20] a fashion
[46:21] and and you look at that and you realize
[46:23] it's like you know this that's birthed
[46:25] in me
[46:27] i had nothing to do with
[46:29] this
[46:30] that has
[46:32] drawn me
[46:34] is not of man
[46:37] this that has changed my life
[46:40] is not a 10-step plan
[46:43] this is not a something
[46:46] anonymous
[46:47] right because we have you know alcoholic
[46:50] anonymous which are good we have
[46:52] narcotics anonymous we have all of these
[46:54] anonymous things my brother and sister i
[46:57] know who changed me
[46:59] there's nothing anonymous about what god
[47:01] is doing in his church hallelujah we're
[47:04] not sitting back saying i'm trying
[47:06] why i feel different
[47:08] i know why i feel different
[47:10] hallelujah
[47:12] now we're looking here and
[47:14] i just need to get to work thank you
[47:15] lord
[47:16] and the angel that talked with me came
[47:18] again
[47:19] and waked me as a man that is awakened
[47:22] out of his sleep in other words he's
[47:25] just
[47:26] not totally alert
[47:28] but he's awake
[47:30] he doesn't have a grasp of every sense
[47:32] that is going on around him
[47:35] but he is awake
[47:37] and he said unto me
[47:39] what seeth thou
[47:40] and i said i have looked and behold a
[47:43] candlestick all of gold
[47:45] with a bowl upon the top of it and his
[47:48] seven lamps thereon
[47:50] and seven pipes to the seven lamps which
[47:53] are upon the top thereof
[47:55] and the two olive trees one upon the
[47:57] right side of the bowl and the other the
[48:00] left side thereof
[48:02] so i answered and spake to the angel
[48:04] that talked with me saying
[48:06] what are these
[48:08] my lord now this is a servant an angel
[48:10] coming to him right my lord is not
[48:12] capitalized
[48:14] but it is words of reverence of respect
[48:17] of honor
[48:19] then the angel that talked with me
[48:20] answered and said unto me know us thou
[48:22] not what these be and i said no my lord
[48:26] then he answered and spake unto me
[48:27] saying this is the word
[48:29] of the lord
[48:31] unto zerubbabel
[48:33] saying not by might
[48:36] nor my power
[48:37] but by my spirit say the lord of hosts
[48:41] amen heavenly father we just
[48:44] thank you lord for the opportunity to
[48:46] come today and to gather in your house
[48:49] and
[48:50] father
[48:51] lord while the flesh might be weak
[48:55] lord sitting here today myself father
[48:57] with this
[48:59] congestion lord and
[49:01] my hearing all blurred
[49:04] but lord it's not this flesh that we're
[49:06] trying to preserve
[49:08] it's not this flesh that we're trying to
[49:10] lift up
[49:12] but it is the spirit of the living god
[49:15] in the souls
[49:17] of sons and daughters of god
[49:20] lord our souls could only feed upon the
[49:22] word
[49:23] lord we are
[49:25] human lord so there are things and
[49:27] pleasures and enjoyments of this life
[49:31] but the only true joy that can be found
[49:34] in the heart of your children
[49:36] is when the word your spirit comes down
[49:38] and moves amongst us
[49:41] deals with our hearts and speaks to us
[49:43] and comforts us
[49:45] encourages us corrects us
[49:48] lifts us up with words of authority
[49:51] for the position you called us to
[49:54] lord i ask
[49:55] for every prayer request whether they
[49:57] were spoken
[49:59] even acknowledged today let every prayer
[50:02] that is upon the hearts of your people
[50:04] today come
[50:05] as a sweet order before your throne
[50:07] today
[50:08] lord that you would look with favor upon
[50:10] your children and we ask you father now
[50:13] just to speak to our hearts don't anoint
[50:16] us just in the flesh lord but let us go
[50:18] much deeper into your spirit lord that
[50:21] you would deal with us lord at the
[50:24] foundational level
[50:25] lord as we march forward with confidence
[50:28] in you
[50:30] and your word and the life
[50:32] that you have given us we thank you
[50:34] today lord and bless your holy name in
[50:37] the name of jesus christ
[50:39] amen
[50:40] you may be seated
[50:51] you know as
[50:52] we upon the word of god today saints
[50:58] i want to remind you that
[51:02] unlike many of the
[51:05] religious world we have not segregated
[51:08] the old and new testament as something
[51:10] for them and for now
[51:12] but understanding that jesus christ came
[51:15] to magnify the old testament to magnify
[51:18] the law
[51:19] to you and i that we could understand
[51:21] with clarity of what he was doing what
[51:24] he said in the beginning because he said
[51:26] i'm god and i change not so we can't
[51:28] come to a day that god puts a giant
[51:30] period at the end of his word and goes
[51:32] into a whole different chapter of a
[51:34] whole different thought of a whole
[51:35] different way we will find with the
[51:37] correct interpretation of the word that
[51:40] everything from the beginning to the end
[51:42] he says i am alpha and omega so he's
[51:45] claiming the very start of it all and
[51:47] declaring i am the finish of it also we
[51:50] don't have a god who wonders somewhere
[51:53] in the middle and changes thoughts or
[51:55] changes stride but it is all about the
[51:58] same amen god is the same yesterday
[52:01] today and forever and so we realize the
[52:04] old testament if we have the right
[52:06] interpretation is just valid today now
[52:09] god was gracious and he he brought about
[52:12] in the new testament
[52:14] a a a more open dialogue if you would
[52:17] use those terms he spoke to us more in a
[52:19] fashion of which we could understand in
[52:21] the day that we live in and this was the
[52:23] word being magnified right now my
[52:26] brother and sister i hope you understand
[52:27] me today uh don't don't misunderstand me
[52:30] i guess i should say but how simple it
[52:33] would have been that we would have been
[52:35] a people that could have just come once
[52:37] a year to the high priest with our lamb
[52:40] or our turtle dove or whatever it might
[52:42] have been and simply offer the offering
[52:45] that one time of year and then kind of
[52:48] just went every day just living our life
[52:51] i'm not talking about those that went
[52:52] out and just sinned again but just
[52:54] living our life you know making a
[52:56] mistake here and there like i made about
[52:57] 10 or 12 yesterday you know i don't know
[53:00] about you but you know i just going on
[53:02] with no real conscience of sin
[53:07] i mean it sounds in a way kind of good
[53:10] i can just go live
[53:12] 364 days just live
[53:14] and when it comes to that day i can then
[53:17] just go and bring my lamb and say lord
[53:19] i'm sorry for the mistakes that i made
[53:22] but you see in the magnification of the
[53:25] word of god god said what i'm going to
[53:28] do is show you what the lamb
[53:31] actually represented
[53:33] i'm going to show you of what the
[53:35] consciousness of man actually was and
[53:39] i'm going to bring you to a place that
[53:41] you will no longer come once a year and
[53:43] offer a lamb or a turtle dove or
[53:46] whatever it might have been but you are
[53:48] going to each and every day by the
[53:51] moving of my spirit come and make a
[53:53] sacrifice every single day and if we're
[53:56] not making that sacrifice every day my
[53:58] brother and sister we're actually
[54:00] transgressing not the word of god as it
[54:03] is by the law but we're transgressing
[54:05] the love of christ for you and i we're
[54:08] saying you know i can just go ahead and
[54:10] carry this burden i can carry this
[54:11] problem i can carry this mistake it's
[54:14] not too grievous of a burden but by
[54:16] revelation we see how incredible our god
[54:20] is we see how incredible the things that
[54:22] he is doing and then we realized in
[54:25] seeing how he how magnificent you might
[54:28] say that our god is we actually only
[54:31] then can see how little we really are it
[54:34] when we when we feel like that we've got
[54:37] it all under control we feel like you
[54:39] know what i'm a part of the plan of god
[54:41] i can just do this part here but when we
[54:44] truly catch the vision of who we are in
[54:48] jesus christ my brother and sister
[54:50] that's when we truly see just
[54:53] how little
[54:54] we are
[54:56] so when people feel like oh yes i'm a
[54:58] great spiritual man my brother and
[55:00] sister that's good you ought to have
[55:01] confidence in god of what he's done for
[55:03] you but when you carry that in the human
[55:07] way and in a human thought uh it really
[55:10] is showing people saying now brother
[55:11] paul what you're fixing to say is kind
[55:13] of judgmental yes it is but it's not me
[55:14] doing the judging you see when people
[55:17] think highly of themselves as a
[55:19] christian i'm talking about in the human
[55:20] element
[55:21] it shows you how little they have of
[55:23] revelation of who they are
[55:31] almost like a minister saying you're not
[55:33] going to make it to heaven without me
[55:40] i agree
[55:44] i agree
[55:45] because the minister holds his plan
[55:48] his place in the plan of god
[55:51] but are not a minister with that kind of
[55:52] attitude
[55:55] because the minister first and foremost
[55:57] must present
[55:59] the true picture of christ
[56:03] and that is i am a sinner saved by grace
[56:07] without him
[56:09] i am nothing
[56:11] amen
[56:12] so we look at this now i want to get
[56:14] back on track here we see how
[56:16] zechariah's vision and that's what i
[56:18] would term it for the day because you
[56:19] see it was a time that he just uh was
[56:22] awakened out of a sleep and i would say
[56:25] he wasn't there with absolute complete
[56:27] clarity of mine now that's maybe just my
[56:30] opinion but there's with a state where
[56:32] god is able to come and deal with it now
[56:34] i don't know if this happens this way
[56:36] with you i believe it would be there's
[56:38] times that you would awaken in the night
[56:39] you're not really awake but you're not
[56:41] really asleep and those are times that
[56:42] god speaks to you
[56:44] it's in that state where we're not
[56:46] caught up with i must go do this i must
[56:48] do this got to fix this got to go here
[56:50] but it's in that state where you're
[56:52] there and i believe that was the state
[56:54] that zechariah was in when god come to
[56:56] him and i believe that we can make these
[56:59] comparisons today of zechariah's vision
[57:02] and i say it's for our day also see the
[57:05] continuity of the word always ties
[57:07] everything together now the critic might
[57:10] say well we believe certain scriptures
[57:12] and this is kind of a theology thing as
[57:14] the way i would put it that uh the more
[57:16] they go to school the more they find uh
[57:18] problems with the bible amen i'll just
[57:21] be a simpleton i will just be a guy that
[57:24] looks at this and finds no error finds
[57:26] no a contradiction finds no problem with
[57:28] the bible because you see the god who
[57:31] ordained the writing of the bible we're
[57:33] not talking about king whatever in
[57:35] england you know that was just a
[57:36] translation my brother and sister the
[57:38] god who ordained the writing of the
[57:41] bible a god that is so great to hang us
[57:43] in the heavens now my brother and sister
[57:46] i thought this was quite interesting i
[57:47] saw a little deal the other day how that
[57:50] they're once again renewing their push
[57:52] to go out into the galaxies and whatever
[57:56] else to try and find the origin
[58:02] hallelujah they're just looking way too
[58:04] far see they've went they went a million
[58:06] miles off when the origin is right here
[58:09] in the midst of his church
[58:11] the origins right here walking on the
[58:13] earth making his presence known but you
[58:15] see they don't really believe in a god
[58:17] so they're looking for something that's
[58:19] just you know a manufacturing in a
[58:22] galaxy somewhere that's just kicking out
[58:24] you know a an earth every once in a
[58:27] while and you know something that is
[58:29] done but you see the continuity of the
[58:31] word is tying everything together and
[58:34] and i want you to think about this uh
[58:36] what he's tying together in you
[58:39] uh something that the word starts to
[58:41] stir in your heart and you come one day
[58:43] to an awakening that i'm not just as it
[58:46] is a sinner saved by grace but i was
[58:49] part of the plan of god from the very
[58:50] beginning and when that becomes real in
[58:53] us it changes so many things in our life
[58:56] because then we realize that it is even
[58:58] greater than just when i can see taste
[59:01] hear smell here in this world it's just
[59:03] such a greater thing and and god starts
[59:06] tying all these pieces together and you
[59:09] know my brother and sister i it's
[59:10] interesting i've talked to many
[59:12] believers through the years and they
[59:14] have a common testimony that they share
[59:16] and that is even as a child and growing
[59:19] up they never felt connected as it were
[59:21] to things of this world they always like
[59:24] they were a little bit of an oddball and
[59:26] so you know that we look at that and
[59:28] realize that this is gone tying
[59:29] everything together and so there's not
[59:31] one conflicting word in the word of god
[59:34] and so we look now as it is here that
[59:38] this vision that zacharias had
[59:40] he sees now the seven golden candle
[59:43] sticks and we understand my brother and
[59:45] sister tying it back into our day of uh
[59:48] brother branham preaching this really
[59:50] making emphasis the thing is the critics
[59:52] want to say you know what he just
[59:54] plagiarized that no my brother and
[59:56] sister it just shows that those others
[59:58] through the years that have spoken such
[59:59] topics were anointed of god to speak on
[1:00:02] those topics amen we're not dredging up
[1:00:05] something that's never been thought or
[1:00:07] spoken before but many times those men
[1:00:10] if you go study their ministries you'll
[1:00:13] find that they spoke on those things but
[1:00:14] they never brought a complete clarity
[1:00:17] because the clarity was reserved for
[1:00:19] this day
[1:00:21] amen this is when the mystery of jesus
[1:00:24] christ was to be completely fulfilled or
[1:00:27] revealed out and so we we don't hold no
[1:00:30] criticism to those they were just laying
[1:00:33] down as it were the seeds that would
[1:00:35] come in another day and we see seven
[1:00:38] church ages right young people you've
[1:00:40] been studying the church age book and i
[1:00:42] think that's good because it lays this
[1:00:44] foundation to understand what is moving
[1:00:47] there is even much more history which we
[1:00:49] understand brother branham uh uh did not
[1:00:52] feel led to tie all that together
[1:00:54] imagine what the church age book would
[1:00:55] look like if you tied every bit of known
[1:00:57] history of the ages together it would be
[1:01:00] like here children
[1:01:01] take your church age book
[1:01:04] but you see hit highlights
[1:01:07] of what it was that opened the rest of
[1:01:09] it up to us see that's what the word of
[1:01:11] god's about my brother and sister
[1:01:13] brother branham didn't preach on every
[1:01:14] scripture in the bible but he hit the
[1:01:16] highlights that opened it up to us and
[1:01:19] made it a living book
[1:01:20] amen so it's there that we look at that
[1:01:23] we see the seven church ages now
[1:01:26] everything that happened through this
[1:01:27] seven church ages i've heard people say
[1:01:29] before oh i kind of wish you know
[1:01:31] laodicea is just so hard i wish we'd
[1:01:33] been born in another age which one
[1:01:39] bingo god says i'll let you do that bam
[1:01:41] next thing you know you're standing in
[1:01:42] the colosseum and there's a line in
[1:01:44] front of you not this age lord
[1:01:49] come on saints
[1:01:51] you've been specially equipped by god to
[1:01:53] live in the age that you were called to
[1:01:55] we don't want to look to another day and
[1:01:57] think oh if i could have just been here
[1:01:58] if i could have been there amen reminds
[1:02:01] me this was just a forgive me i hope
[1:02:03] this doesn't sound
[1:02:05] sacrilegious in a sense but reminds me
[1:02:07] one time of a a little spoof movie i've
[1:02:09] seen and this this kid was walking
[1:02:11] around you know and i had a couple
[1:02:13] pistols on a belt you know and he was
[1:02:15] telling his friend he said i sure wished
[1:02:17] i had been a cowboy back in the days of
[1:02:20] the indians cowboys and indians and all
[1:02:22] of a sudden he disappears the next thing
[1:02:23] you know he's standing out on the grass
[1:02:25] of the prairie and he's surrounded by
[1:02:27] indians
[1:02:30] be careful what you ask for
[1:02:32] amen stick to the basics stick to the
[1:02:35] foundation i need more of you lord
[1:02:37] that's what i'm asking for you can never
[1:02:39] go wrong with that approach to the word
[1:02:41] of god lord i need more of you
[1:02:44] amen so you look at this but all of
[1:02:46] these church ages were all
[1:02:48] and just
[1:02:49] pardoned my verbiage
[1:02:51] were all powered by the holy ghost
[1:02:54] there was not one age that it was man's
[1:02:56] intellect or man's physical strength or
[1:02:59] prowess that ever brought them through
[1:03:01] that age every one of the seven church
[1:03:03] ages was a complete dependence upon the
[1:03:07] anointing of the holy ghost in their
[1:03:09] life and even when they really didn't
[1:03:11] talk about it as it were being the holy
[1:03:13] ghost when when they were not really
[1:03:15] cognizant as we view it today it was god
[1:03:19] in their midst leading them and guiding
[1:03:22] them and strengthening them and when
[1:03:24] they would be there and as paul is
[1:03:26] speaking to them and peter is speaking
[1:03:28] to them about these things concerning
[1:03:30] the spirit of god and you know they they
[1:03:32] come back with responses like we don't
[1:03:34] know if there be
[1:03:36] a holy ghost
[1:03:41] but they had a desire for it you see it
[1:03:44] was a season you might say of
[1:03:46] enlightenment and we don't use that in
[1:03:48] in a casual term but enlightenment being
[1:03:51] a season of revelation coming the word
[1:03:53] opening up coming alive to them and the
[1:03:55] ministry that our lord jesus christ
[1:03:57] brought in that day we can look at that
[1:03:59] and say you know in a way it was
[1:04:01] simplistic
[1:04:02] do you follow me in a way it was very
[1:04:04] simplistic but once again i want to make
[1:04:06] a connection here for you so they are
[1:04:09] there looking at this saying well the
[1:04:10] ministry of jesus christ was very
[1:04:12] simplistic
[1:04:13] he come and he spoke in these fashions
[1:04:15] it was there you know why because he
[1:04:17] knew exactly as it were what button to
[1:04:20] push for revelation to flow down into
[1:04:22] the church he wasn't spoon feeding them
[1:04:25] as into baby them like wallflowers
[1:04:30] but by revelation the opening of the
[1:04:33] word come and while some got angry and
[1:04:35] walked away some said we believe you to
[1:04:37] be
[1:04:38] the messiah the son of god
[1:04:41] what a contrast my brother and sister
[1:04:44] now pardon me i say this with a tad bit
[1:04:45] of humor this morning but are we eagles
[1:04:48] or are we buzzards
[1:04:50] come on it's it's not going to be what
[1:04:52] we can prove and not prove it's going to
[1:04:54] be how you receive and react and and
[1:04:57] god's placed it in there and i'm telling
[1:04:58] you i've heard some rough preaching in
[1:05:00] my life i've heard some tear off the
[1:05:03] hyde type of preaching before and
[1:05:05] basically preachers making statements
[1:05:07] like i sometimes wonder if there'll be
[1:05:09] anyone in this building today make the
[1:05:11] rapture
[1:05:12] but he didn't realize he just included
[1:05:14] himself
[1:05:17] but you see those kind of statements my
[1:05:18] brother and sister some walk out and say
[1:05:21] yeah i'm not going to make the rapture
[1:05:22] we never see them again but some just
[1:05:25] keep pressing forward because regardless
[1:05:27] of what he is i know what god said and
[1:05:30] god wasn't speaking as it were with the
[1:05:32] words of man but he spoke to my soul and
[1:05:34] it might have been the worst man that
[1:05:36] brought it or carried it down but it was
[1:05:38] still the spirit of christ that touched
[1:05:40] my soul and i am the bride of christ and
[1:05:43] there'll be no preacher send me hell you
[1:05:46] know that i want you to hear me today
[1:05:47] and hear me well there'll be no preacher
[1:05:49] send you to hell
[1:05:51] amen it will be your reliance on that
[1:05:54] preacher that might send you to hell but
[1:05:57] it's the word of god that redeems you
[1:05:59] and even there i just read it this
[1:06:01] morning i should have put it in here i
[1:06:03] had no idea this vein would come this
[1:06:04] way but the prophet of god was talking
[1:06:07] about how god can use a jackass to speak
[1:06:13] now i say that with a tad bit of humor
[1:06:14] but i want you to understand that just
[1:06:17] because we're looking at the vessel
[1:06:19] that's speaking don't look at them
[1:06:25] measure by the word
[1:06:28] by the word can somebody say by the word
[1:06:31] amen
[1:06:32] so seven church ages powered by the holy
[1:06:34] ghost all anointed
[1:06:37] and this is what stirs my heart because
[1:06:38] it's a very big subject
[1:06:40] all
[1:06:41] positionally placed
[1:06:45] god never made one single accident
[1:06:48] amen
[1:06:50] nobody was back god didn't send alex
[1:06:52] back there to the second church age and
[1:06:54] him they're telling me here i can
[1:06:56] reprogram your your iphone for you
[1:07:01] come on
[1:07:03] every one of us is here
[1:07:05] praise the lord there's those that can
[1:07:06] reprogram an iphone i i can mess them up
[1:07:08] i can't reprogram them but you see god
[1:07:11] places each one positionally but you
[1:07:14] know being positionally placed
[1:07:16] does not mean easy
[1:07:20] who's positionally placed this morning
[1:07:23] who's been called of god and know you're
[1:07:25] to stand in this age and stand as a
[1:07:27] testament of the power of almighty god
[1:07:30] hallelujah now how many of you can lift
[1:07:32] your hand and say it's been easy
[1:07:36] not one of us can say it's been easy
[1:07:40] in fact sometimes we we cry and moan to
[1:07:43] ourself lord why is my burden so heavy
[1:07:46] why is my circumstance such as it is
[1:07:49] well i'll tell you quit looking at the
[1:07:51] circumstance paul i mean saints
[1:07:55] and realize that god positionally placed
[1:07:57] you then god made a way for you to
[1:07:59] fulfill what he called you to it's not
[1:08:01] about how we feel about it
[1:08:04] amen now look
[1:08:06] you know i've been criticized before
[1:08:08] being a cherry picking quote reader well
[1:08:10] i'm telling you what i just have got
[1:08:12] worse and worse about that
[1:08:14] cherry-picking
[1:08:15] amen the queen of sheba
[1:08:17] hey man look at the link to that quote
[1:08:19] is that not cherry-picked
[1:08:23] but i want you to read it
[1:08:26] god don't always work on the easy road
[1:08:29] and things that's at your hand
[1:08:32] you have to struggle to do the will of
[1:08:34] god
[1:08:35] sometimes
[1:08:39] now
[1:08:40] i call your attention to the title of
[1:08:42] that sermon
[1:08:46] and in that sermon if you go and listen
[1:08:48] to it you'll see where brother branham
[1:08:50] talks about people say oh oh i'm on the
[1:08:52] north side of chicago and this is down
[1:08:55] here and brother brown says yeah yeah
[1:08:57] it's too far for them
[1:08:59] to go
[1:09:01] but she traveled that far and that's why
[1:09:03] god said she'll come in the day and she
[1:09:06] will judge
[1:09:08] why
[1:09:09] because it wasn't
[1:09:12] bring the message
[1:09:14] to me
[1:09:16] it was a yearning burning searching
[1:09:19] hunger down in the heart and soul of the
[1:09:21] queen of sheba and she said i hear that
[1:09:24] there is a man brother branham makes
[1:09:26] this statement he says solomon did not
[1:09:29] go to them
[1:09:30] they came to solomon
[1:09:33] see so showing the hunger now we can
[1:09:36] have such a hunger my brother and sister
[1:09:38] for for people we can have such a hunger
[1:09:40] to do this i've done this before and god
[1:09:42] showed me where i made my mistake and we
[1:09:44] go and actually cater
[1:09:50] oh
[1:09:51] what is it that will take you to get you
[1:09:53] to come to church
[1:09:55] what is it
[1:09:56] will be to to make it where you have
[1:09:58] this desire
[1:10:00] i'll tell you what i've done in the past
[1:10:02] realized it was such a huge mistake i
[1:10:04] provided a house
[1:10:06] i provided the electricity i provided
[1:10:08] the heat i provided food i paid for
[1:10:10] gasoline
[1:10:12] and they still
[1:10:14] wouldn't serve the lord
[1:10:18] now i don't want you to think i've
[1:10:19] become callous
[1:10:22] but i'm telling you
[1:10:24] you want to serve god
[1:10:26] you say you have a desire in your heart
[1:10:30] become a queen of shiva
[1:10:34] brother brown also says in this sermon i
[1:10:36] might as well put the quote in here
[1:10:37] shouldn't i
[1:10:38] now i'm trying to quote it from memory
[1:10:41] brother brown says she didn't travel in
[1:10:42] no cadillac
[1:10:45] and she come and she said i'm going to
[1:10:47] be here long enough to see if this is
[1:10:49] the truth and then brother brown says
[1:10:51] and some of these won't even sit for
[1:10:53] three minutes
[1:10:59] aren't you glad
[1:11:00] god's made you work for it
[1:11:03] i don't mean works as in works but you
[1:11:05] know what i'm talking about amen because
[1:11:07] when it also says and the other queen of
[1:11:09] sheba which was pre preached just about
[1:11:12] two months
[1:11:13] from this one earlier he also says in
[1:11:15] there
[1:11:16] that
[1:11:17] you don't appreciate it when it comes to
[1:11:19] easy
[1:11:21] amen but when there's a burning desire
[1:11:23] down in the soul to serve god can
[1:11:25] somebody say amen i have burning desire
[1:11:28] to serve god you just keep pressing and
[1:11:31] you say why am i pressing they quit they
[1:11:34] quit why am i pressing because you are
[1:11:37] called
[1:11:39] now look don't misunderstand we're not
[1:11:40] putting them out we don't know what
[1:11:42] god's timetable is for them i'm talking
[1:11:44] about you today and your life you here
[1:11:47] amen you can't quit why because there's
[1:11:50] something inside of you that cannot be
[1:11:53] restrained and knows that the word of
[1:11:55] god which is the very life of christ is
[1:11:58] not able to give up
[1:12:04] hallelujah
[1:12:08] you know in the message and then jesus
[1:12:10] came
[1:12:11] now i had this book with me in the
[1:12:13] harvester
[1:12:15] and i've read it sporadically
[1:12:18] and sometimes those sporadics are just
[1:12:20] so cool because there'd be a truck
[1:12:22] coming in the field but they're not
[1:12:23] there i reach down and i pick it up and
[1:12:25] i open it up and i maybe only get to
[1:12:27] read two paragraphs
[1:12:30] and i'm just stunned by what i'm reading
[1:12:36] i'm like my
[1:12:39] but i don't look at the page and so
[1:12:42] i want to go back and read it again and
[1:12:45] i think it's about
[1:12:46] page 17 and i turn page 17
[1:12:49] but there's another stunning quote
[1:12:55] and jesus came
[1:12:59] they thought or he thought that they'd
[1:13:01] went off without their lord but what did
[1:13:03] he do
[1:13:05] got all frantic
[1:13:06] my children gonna be lost
[1:13:08] i see what satan's gonna do oh my
[1:13:11] they're gonna be lost no he didn't
[1:13:13] no sir he climbed up on top of a
[1:13:15] mountain was sitting up there watching
[1:13:17] that little ship as she was bouncing in
[1:13:19] the sea
[1:13:20] oh i'm so glad that
[1:13:22] that uh he climbed on the ramparts of
[1:13:24] glory and sets in the majesty on high
[1:13:27] and his eye is on the sparrow and i know
[1:13:29] he watches me and he watches you just in
[1:13:33] the darkest of the hour now look saints
[1:13:36] i want to clarify in a sense here in the
[1:13:38] darkest of the hour you'll be saying oh
[1:13:40] brother paul life's been going good for
[1:13:42] our family we're blessed we just uh
[1:13:45] god's been good yes no disaster just
[1:13:48] look out the window
[1:13:50] look out the window it's the darkness of
[1:13:52] the hour if it's not necessarily
[1:13:53] troubled directly in your family
[1:13:55] remember that these things must come to
[1:13:58] pass for the coming of the lord so we
[1:14:00] are going to face the tempt to see we're
[1:14:02] going to face the troubles amen we're
[1:14:04] going to face the conspiracies you know
[1:14:06] every once in a while i get home from
[1:14:08] work big mistake actually i turn on the
[1:14:11] computer and i go and i look at the the
[1:14:13] news on the computer and and uh you look
[1:14:16] at that and it's like oh my
[1:14:19] oh my goodness yes it this this is just
[1:14:22] horrible and and this is horrible and
[1:14:25] and this is more horrible than the
[1:14:27] horrible
[1:14:31] but in the end you stop and say thank
[1:14:33] you lord
[1:14:34] this must come to pass
[1:14:36] and when this is coming to pass we're
[1:14:38] not going to walk around with our head
[1:14:39] in the dirt crying woe unto us we're
[1:14:42] going to stand up and we're going to say
[1:14:43] children talking about your family
[1:14:45] children this is the word of god being
[1:14:48] fulfilled just as you children living in
[1:14:52] the presence of god is the word of god
[1:14:54] fulfilled they both must rise up
[1:14:57] together
[1:14:59] we can't pluck the evilness out of our
[1:15:01] nation
[1:15:02] out of the governments we can't pluck
[1:15:04] that up
[1:15:05] lest we tear up
[1:15:07] what shouldn't be tore up
[1:15:09] you see god could come imagine we are in
[1:15:11] egypt
[1:15:14] and the death angel passing over america
[1:15:19] or south africa or chile
[1:15:22] or england
[1:15:23] or wherever
[1:15:28] do you realize the wailing and crying
[1:15:32] of judgment coming down
[1:15:35] at that level would be like
[1:15:41] but i want you to look at another side
[1:15:42] of the scripture
[1:15:44] the scripture says in that day
[1:15:48] that these diseases and pestilence
[1:15:51] and torments of the mind and spirit
[1:15:53] would come across the people
[1:15:55] and they would curse god
[1:15:59] not a spirit of repentance
[1:16:02] they would curse god
[1:16:04] you know saints that's already come to
[1:16:05] pass the last major earthquake in chile
[1:16:08] the brothers down there have chronic uh
[1:16:11] chronicled
[1:16:13] that
[1:16:15] way back
[1:16:16] no major 10 point whatever was 9.9 or
[1:16:20] whatever and then they revised it later
[1:16:22] by the new standards it was a 10
[1:16:23] something that hit chile many years ago
[1:16:26] people fell in the streets and cried out
[1:16:27] to god
[1:16:29] the church has filled up many new
[1:16:31] churches built in people
[1:16:33] and then you see a progression another
[1:16:35] earthquake
[1:16:36] and people cried out to god but not in
[1:16:38] sincerity if you went to church but soon
[1:16:41] they were back to their deal do you know
[1:16:42] that right after sister jerry and i left
[1:16:44] here a few years ago they had that great
[1:16:46] earthquake down there
[1:16:49] it was actually in the news in chile
[1:16:52] it's not something done in a corner that
[1:16:54] somebody speculated on
[1:16:55] people stood in the streets
[1:16:58] lifted their fists to the heavens
[1:17:01] and cursed god
[1:17:07] look at the day my brother and sister
[1:17:10] we're here in our earthquake
[1:17:12] we're here in our time of great sorrow
[1:17:14] and travail and destruction and
[1:17:16] corruption and all of this and we're
[1:17:17] lifting our hand to the heavens but our
[1:17:20] hands are open and our voices are saying
[1:17:23] lord we love you we thank you lord for
[1:17:25] your word that has redeemed us in this
[1:17:29] darkest of hours
[1:17:37] he watches just in the darkest of the
[1:17:39] hour when every pitch talking about the
[1:17:41] little boat seemed to be the last one
[1:17:44] imagine come on can you place yourself
[1:17:46] in that little boat out there you're
[1:17:47] going and here comes a wave i don't want
[1:17:50] to take too much of your time but i've
[1:17:51] actually been in a situation like that
[1:17:54] where when a boat hit a wave
[1:17:56] and you can watch about a foot of water
[1:17:58] roll in front of the boat and splash in
[1:18:01] the boat and you are standing inside of
[1:18:02] the boat with water halfway to your
[1:18:04] knees and every time the boat getting
[1:18:07] sluggish and sluggish and one man in the
[1:18:09] boat this true story i was there one man
[1:18:11] in the boat on his knees crying out to
[1:18:14] god repenting of the things he had been
[1:18:16] doing and doing and other brothers on
[1:18:18] their knees with buckets and pictures
[1:18:20] and this and that pitching the water out
[1:18:22] as fast as they can and you're sitting
[1:18:24] there even my own self that stage of my
[1:18:26] life 1988
[1:18:29] standing here i was driving the boat
[1:18:32] and saying lord
[1:18:34] if this is the end
[1:18:37] please forgive me
[1:18:40] forgive me of my shortcomings
[1:18:43] forgive me of my unbelief
[1:18:47] saints it's very real
[1:18:49] it's very real
[1:18:51] when you look at the horizon and there
[1:18:53] is no horizon
[1:18:55] and they're right there just in the
[1:18:57] darkest hour when every pitch seemed to
[1:19:00] be the last one the water coming in the
[1:19:03] boat the boat is now heavy and
[1:19:06] burdensome
[1:19:08] then jesus come along walking on the sea
[1:19:11] i want you to notice they were helpless
[1:19:13] hopeless despairing and when they saw
[1:19:16] him
[1:19:18] they rejoice praise the lord jesus is
[1:19:20] here
[1:19:22] they were scared of him
[1:19:27] the only thing
[1:19:28] that could help them
[1:19:30] they were afraid of it
[1:19:32] there's another reference that i almost
[1:19:34] used today trying not to be too long
[1:19:39] brother branham says
[1:19:41] and that's
[1:19:43] what the spirit of our day is
[1:19:46] god's in the midst of the people
[1:19:49] his spirit moving the supernatural is
[1:19:51] here to be and we're afraid of him
[1:19:54] we're afraid of him oh my maybe i think
[1:19:57] i'm a holy roller
[1:19:59] they might think i'm a fanatic
[1:20:02] well i'm here to tell you folks they'll
[1:20:04] think that
[1:20:05] regardless
[1:20:07] because the spirit in them

[1:21:16] when this world is in despair when
[1:21:18] nations is against nations and total
[1:21:20] annihilation could come within 30
[1:21:22] minutes to the world jesus is coming
[1:21:24] walking along in this darkest devour the
[1:21:28] world's afraid of him they're saying

[1:21:36] and they're saying it's holy rollers and
[1:21:38] fortune tellers and everything else
[1:21:39] could be called and i'm so glad amen
[1:21:42] that in this dark hour jesus is walking

[1:22:00] church showing himself alive this is the
[1:22:04] dark
[1:22:07] could that be
[1:22:11] it's way back when when they called it
[1:22:12] the dark ages
[1:22:19] this is the darkest hour this world has
[1:22:21] ever seen
[1:22:23] since the dawn of time never has it been
[1:22:25] like this never has it been so separated
[1:22:27] never has the church been so towards the
[1:22:29] pieces never has it been so
[1:22:31] denominationally eat up so many
[1:22:33] differences so many sensations and
[1:22:35] things going on in the message
[1:22:41] but right here in let me correct that so
[1:22:42] nobody can criticize me i'm just tired
[1:22:44] of getting criticized
[1:22:46] going on in the church
[1:22:48] but right in the midst of it all jesus
[1:22:50] comes along in this darkest of hour to
[1:22:54] show himself and his love to his church
[1:22:56] the darkest devour then jesus comes
[1:22:59] along
[1:23:01] now aren't you glad my brother and
[1:23:02] sister every one of us has had our road
[1:23:04] to emmaus when we've been walking along
[1:23:06] and then realized it was jesus christ
[1:23:08] walking with us it was him dealing with
[1:23:10] us as him that has changed our
[1:23:12] perspective it was no longer i tell you
[1:23:15] what when they hustled back to jerusalem
[1:23:17] my brother and sister they wasn't going
[1:23:18] back there saying we're tired and we're
[1:23:20] discouraged they walked back in there

[1:23:23] happened i was walking along in this
[1:23:26] life and i was discouraged yes i had
[1:23:28] heard truth i knew what truth was but i
[1:23:31] was still discouraged and then i
[1:23:33] realized and my eyes were open that
[1:23:36] jesus was walking with me
[1:23:39] oh what a life-changing thing it doesn't
[1:23:43] mean you won't have good days and bad
[1:23:44] days but it won't control our life for
[1:23:47] very long let me put it that way it
[1:23:49] won't control your life for very long
[1:23:52] you might go through the day but you
[1:23:54] come to the end of the day in the night
[1:23:56] you sit down and you start to think upon
[1:23:59] the things that god has done for you and
[1:24:01] there is something that just starts to
[1:24:02] dispel that might be a word from a
[1:24:04] husband it might be a word from a wife
[1:24:06] it might be a word from parents or from
[1:24:08] children it might be words from a
[1:24:10] brother or sister i'll tell you i was
[1:24:12] feeling a little bit down look i'm just

[1:24:24] prashant sister concha and they had kind
[1:24:26] words that they were sharing of words of
[1:24:28] appreciation and i went to bed amen laid

[1:24:34] heart was smiling i was like thank you

[1:24:46] i'm not going to let you go to sleep in
[1:24:47] that atmosphere
[1:24:49] and i'm going to speak to you

[1:24:54] contra thank you for those words
[1:24:57] amen
[1:25:00] now don't feel sorry for me i i would
[1:25:02] covet your prayers but i've been
[1:25:03] fighting this
[1:25:05] congestion and then that's caused my
[1:25:07] vertigo and uh i've been joking you know
[1:25:09] with the guys as we're working laying
[1:25:11] under a chopper
[1:25:12] vertigo spinning so fast i can't even
[1:25:14] tell where the bolt is i was trying to
[1:25:16] tighten and you know i just had to see
[1:25:18] the humor of it and i told my brother i
[1:25:20] said would you quit spinning the chopper
[1:25:23] so i can reach up here and tighten this
[1:25:25] bolt
[1:25:26] and he said i'm trying but you're down
[1:25:28] there pushing it along
[1:25:30] no no that's not good saints that's not
[1:25:33] good
[1:25:34] i'm tired of it i'm fed up with it
[1:25:37] amen but i'm not going to claim it it's
[1:25:40] a circumstance and it's there and a
[1:25:42] doctor says i'm sorry nothing we can
[1:25:44] really do for for that for you you know
[1:25:47] we can put you on some drugs thank you
[1:25:49] i've got some drugs
[1:25:52] right here
[1:25:54] it says by his stripes i'm healed
[1:25:56] amen so i'm going to take that pill
[1:25:58] every day
[1:25:59] hallelujah
[1:26:01] amen
[1:26:05] showing himself alive darkest hour
[1:26:07] world's ever seen since the dawn of time
[1:26:10] denominational spirits
[1:26:12] trying to eat it up
[1:26:13] differences
[1:26:15] so different sensations
[1:26:18] and things going on
[1:26:20] in the church
[1:26:22] now we could look at that and say oh
[1:26:23] brother brown's talking about the
[1:26:24] denomination but look how it fits so
[1:26:26] perfectly in our day
[1:26:30] you see those spirits
[1:26:32] oh i don't want to be confrontational
[1:26:34] but i'm not going to be shy any longer
[1:26:35] saints i hope you're good with that
[1:26:38] we go down there there's a brother in
[1:26:39] salt lake that we just really loved him
[1:26:41] and his lovely wife little kids
[1:26:44] no no there was a minister started
[1:26:46] coming up salt lake
[1:26:47] kind of integrated himself with the
[1:26:49] believers there
[1:26:50] and started working to cut the sheep out
[1:26:54] cut one here cut one there
[1:26:58] now this dear brother has moved away to
[1:27:00] a different church
[1:27:01] and says if you don't believe that
[1:27:03] brother branham's coming back
[1:27:05] and preaching
[1:27:07] then you're lost
[1:27:11] i asked the brothers not i wasn't trying
[1:27:13] to be a know-it-all but i said
[1:27:15] did you ask him to prove it by scripture
[1:27:19] they looked at us and no one ever
[1:27:20] thought
[1:27:22] but you see my brother and sister the
[1:27:23] word of god says test everything by the
[1:27:25] word
[1:27:27] and the prophet said test everything by
[1:27:29] the word
[1:27:31] so are we judgmental to ask someone
[1:27:34] prove it
[1:27:36] by the word
[1:27:37] right is that wrong of us
[1:27:40] does that mean is that evil no
[1:27:43] no it's not it's the word
[1:27:47] so we look at this and realize what's
[1:27:49] happening my brother and sister
[1:27:51] do you realize that brother brown speaks
[1:27:53] of this maybe you've looked at it in
[1:27:55] this depth and maybe you haven't but
[1:27:56] brother branham talks about how as a
[1:27:58] young man actually running from the lord
[1:28:00] ends up in colorado
[1:28:02] riding for a ranch
[1:28:04] and he's talking about how they could
[1:28:06] only run in the forest if they were
[1:28:08] purebred
[1:28:10] right had to have a blood tag
[1:28:12] you ever seen a blood tag
[1:28:14] little metal clip
[1:28:16] typically they have a number
[1:28:18] that number's recorded in a book that
[1:28:19] would record when that cow was born that
[1:28:22] calf was born
[1:28:24] so they have to have that blood day
[1:28:27] but there come a day
[1:28:29] at the end called harvest time
[1:28:33] and the cowboys were there and they
[1:28:34] didn't say we'll just go load up
[1:28:36] 40 cows on this truck and send them to
[1:28:38] the market no
[1:28:40] they look at the brand and they cut this
[1:28:42] one this way and
[1:28:44] cut that one that way
[1:28:45] you realize satan understands that
[1:28:47] principle
[1:28:48] and he's here now early on
[1:28:52] trying to you belong over here
[1:28:54] go on saints are you with me
[1:28:56] you belong here you belong here you
[1:28:58] don't belong over there with him you
[1:29:00] don't belong no
[1:29:01] if you're over there with him you're not
[1:29:02] of us
[1:29:05] the word said
[1:29:07] we are one
[1:29:09] in grace tabernacle
[1:29:12] we are one in bethel tabernacle we are
[1:29:16] one in living word
[1:29:18] no we are one
[1:29:20] come on
[1:29:22] in christ
[1:29:25] amen don't let anybody cut you out try
[1:29:27] and put you in a different pen
[1:29:29] you don't belong there i'll tell you
[1:29:31] where i belong
[1:29:32] hey man i'm still praying for more
[1:29:34] revelation but i'll tell you where i
[1:29:35] belong i belong in christ
[1:29:37] hey man you're gonna slap a brand on me
[1:29:39] pardon me this expression go ahead slap
[1:29:42] a brand on me
[1:29:45] don't smear it i want a good clean brand
[1:29:49] i want to be branded
[1:29:52] fiery trials
[1:29:54] you imagine what these poor calves
[1:29:56] when i was a young man i'm sorry saints
[1:29:58] but when i was a young man i used to
[1:30:00] glory in that
[1:30:01] take that calf
[1:30:06] most of it be like what is wrong with
[1:30:08] you paul
[1:30:10] i'm sorry it's just how i felt and i've
[1:30:13] done that to thousands
[1:30:16] well if i could just do that to
[1:30:18] thousands for christ i'd be a really
[1:30:20] happy man
[1:30:21] amen look at this we branded them
[1:30:25] for jesus christ they don't belong in
[1:30:26] any other herd they belong to him
[1:30:29] hallelujah they don't belong to this
[1:30:30] ministry they don't belong to this
[1:30:32] church building they belong to jesus
[1:30:34] christ
[1:30:35] let them be marked such
[1:30:37] but right in the midst of this comes the
[1:30:39] darkest of hours to show himself and his
[1:30:41] love to the church amen that's when
[1:30:43] jesus comes along now he's already
[1:30:45] declared my brother and sister that this
[1:30:47] is the darkest hour
[1:30:49] let's remember that this is the darkest
[1:30:51] hour so he's talking now that jesus is
[1:30:55] here in our midst
[1:30:58] look saints there's been people that
[1:30:59] have come through this church that
[1:31:01] didn't believe that god was in them they
[1:31:03] would say if god's in me where is he at
[1:31:05] now i want you to understand what kind
[1:31:07] of a spirit and what kind of
[1:31:10] intellectual warping that somebody can
[1:31:13] follow this message read this message
[1:31:15] hear this message read their bible and
[1:31:18] even have one question that god's in
[1:31:20] them or not
[1:31:21] besides the fact that the prophet god
[1:31:23] said it over 100 times
[1:31:26] you see the spirit that's there trying
[1:31:28] to cut you out put you in a pen no we
[1:31:30] have the holy ghost we just don't have
[1:31:32] anything else well what is the holy
[1:31:33] ghost go look it up go look it up the
[1:31:35] prophet of god talks about it so many
[1:31:37] times the holy ghost is god himself and
[1:31:39] then he comes along and refers to it the
[1:31:41] holy ghost is christ the anointed one in
[1:31:43] you and he comes along and says all of
[1:31:46] these are one it's god
[1:31:48] amen
[1:31:50] don't let them amen sorry
[1:31:53] i don't care how many
[1:31:55] pardon me for putting you down like your
[1:31:57] cattle or sheep or something i don't
[1:31:58] care how many is in that pin over there
[1:32:00] my brother and sister that don't mean
[1:32:01] they're right
[1:32:04] now look let me just it's getting late
[1:32:08] joel 2 28 the prophet of god
[1:32:12] referred to this many times
[1:32:15] and i was going to read from 25 to 30
[1:32:17] but you can do that as homework or you
[1:32:19] probably have it memorized
[1:32:21] and it shall come to pass after this i
[1:32:22] will pour
[1:32:24] out the spirit of the church
[1:32:28] the spirit of the age
[1:32:30] he said it was my spirit
[1:32:32] this is god himself speaking said i'm
[1:32:35] going to pour out my spirits
[1:32:40] upon all flesh
[1:32:42] now when he's talking about all flesh my
[1:32:44] brother and sister we'd say well this is
[1:32:45] referring to christians no it isn't
[1:32:46] there's people around here that prophesy
[1:32:49] there's people out here their prophecies
[1:32:51] come to pass
[1:32:53] if you just pay attention i don't
[1:32:54] recommend you waste your time doing it
[1:32:56] but if you just pay attention you will
[1:32:58] find that there isn't many incredible
[1:33:00] supernatural signs taking place but that
[1:33:03] is not the proof
[1:33:05] that is not the proof the life is the
[1:33:07] proof
[1:33:08] amen if it doesn't produce the same
[1:33:12] exact seed
[1:33:17] that's right
[1:33:19] yeah
[1:33:22] all flesh and your sons and your
[1:33:23] daughters shall prophesy your old men
[1:33:25] shall drink dreams your young men shall
[1:33:27] see visions now look what this is from
[1:33:30] he's pouring out his spirit
[1:33:33] he's pouring out his spirit so you look
[1:33:35] at this and realize saints grace
[1:33:37] tabernacle will sit here now i'm not i'm
[1:33:40] not trying to tell you how to worship
[1:33:41] god don't misunderstand me but don't sit
[1:33:43] here like a a bump on a pumpkin
[1:33:47] god's alive in our midst god's moving
[1:33:50] he's pouring his spirit out
[1:33:54] but i can also take you in the message
[1:33:55] where brother brown says so many people
[1:33:57] don't even wait
[1:33:58] for god
[1:34:02] scripture says they that wait upon the
[1:34:04] lord
[1:34:06] shall renew their strength
[1:34:08] you know kind of like the old joke
[1:34:10] pardon me i just have to tell you this
[1:34:12] minister of a little country church
[1:34:14] about the size of grace
[1:34:17] gets invited to go preach at a
[1:34:20] conference in the big city
[1:34:26] and he's there and
[1:34:28] he's shocked lo and behold they say well
[1:34:29] we want reverend so-and-so to come
[1:34:32] i want you to minister
[1:34:34] sunday morning we've heard great things
[1:34:35] about your ministry
[1:34:37] and he preaches a phenomenal sermon that
[1:34:39] sunday morning
[1:34:41] people are shouting jumping
[1:34:43] praising the lord
[1:34:46] right before he's fixing to go home from
[1:34:48] this trip
[1:34:51] the board calls him in and says hey
[1:34:54] pastor
[1:34:56] we want to invite you
[1:34:58] to come
[1:35:00] and pastor the first church
[1:35:03] great big almost cathedral-like church
[1:35:07] thousand people
[1:35:09] gets home from his trip
[1:35:11] walks in the door
[1:35:13] oh my his wife's like honey you're so
[1:35:15] happy he said honey you can't believe it
[1:35:17] i preached the best sermon i've ever
[1:35:19] preached in my life
[1:35:20] and they
[1:35:21] they invited
[1:35:23] us to come and pastor the first church
[1:35:27] and she said
[1:35:28] what are you going to do
[1:35:30] and he says you start packing while i
[1:35:32] pray about it
[1:35:41] they that wait upon the lord
[1:35:43] i wonder if his time in the first church
[1:35:46] was
[1:35:48] anointed of god
[1:35:51] you see i could take you to some of the
[1:35:53] notes i cut off this morning
[1:35:56] the prophet of god said
[1:36:00] when you have problems
[1:36:03] when you're in the will of god
[1:36:07] god
[1:36:08] will help you out
[1:36:11] when you have problems
[1:36:13] out of the will of god
[1:36:15] you have to get back in the will of god
[1:36:18] before god will help you
[1:36:21] oh lord help us to be in your will amen
[1:36:24] they that wait upon the lord lord help
[1:36:26] us to be in your will amen none of this
[1:36:29] i'll you start packing while i pray
[1:36:31] about it amen
[1:36:33] hallelujah
[1:36:36] now
[1:36:37] i want to just hurry along here i just
[1:36:38] can't help myself saints sometimes
[1:36:40] forgive me lord
[1:36:43] now here in the sermon oneness
[1:36:47] brother brown
[1:36:48] lays this out he says but god said not
[1:36:50] by power not by might but by my spirit
[1:36:53] saith the lord
[1:36:54] that's how i'll unite my church
[1:36:57] not by organization not by education not
[1:37:00] by theologians but by my spirit saith
[1:37:04] the lord i'll bring my sheep together
[1:37:09] now saints i'll just give you a glimpse
[1:37:11] of why sometimes i say things to you
[1:37:14] god allows you to
[1:37:16] be in a position god allows you
[1:37:19] but in the last year year and a half
[1:37:21] i've received a multiple of phone calls
[1:37:26] of people
[1:37:27] saying things like brother paul
[1:37:29] now
[1:37:31] i know we don't agree on everything
[1:37:35] but brother so-and-so has a vision
[1:37:38] for uniting the bride in the message
[1:37:46] and i'm thinking praise the lord
[1:37:48] they're going to repent and come back to
[1:37:50] the word
[1:37:56] instead you know what i hear saints
[1:37:59] words
[1:38:00] that's best of my memory would put
[1:38:03] brother paul
[1:38:04] if we
[1:38:07] of different groups in the message could
[1:38:09] lay aside
[1:38:11] our differences
[1:38:13] bail pure
[1:38:14] oh i mean yes anyway
[1:38:18] we could unite
[1:38:22] believers of the message
[1:38:24] back together
[1:38:32] saints maybe i hold on to things a
[1:38:34] little too tight god's
[1:38:36] lord's helping me
[1:38:40] my father
[1:38:43] the word
[1:38:45] has just become alive
[1:38:47] in front of me
[1:38:49] taking me back
[1:38:51] hundreds
[1:38:53] and hundreds of years
[1:38:56] and god recorded that
[1:38:58] so that little paul
[1:39:01] in the year 2021
[1:39:05] would not go man that sounds like such a
[1:39:07] good idea
[1:39:09] i look at that and i say just a second
[1:39:13] under and this will tie together in a
[1:39:15] minute and you'll see and i'm getting
[1:39:16] close to finishing under messenger
[1:39:19] right
[1:39:20] you understand that
[1:39:22] amen we're not here worshiping brother
[1:39:24] branham i don't care what the world
[1:39:25] thinks my brother and sister i don't
[1:39:27] worship but i see a man that there has
[1:39:29] not been a contemporary uh to him on the
[1:39:32] earth in this generation
[1:39:35] 2020 i mean uh 20th century and 21st
[1:39:39] century not a contemporary
[1:39:43] and i'm looking at this and saying
[1:39:46] yes
[1:39:48] under my messenger
[1:39:50] he laid it out right here
[1:39:52] how we measure everything i'm going to
[1:39:54] put a two-year-old plane i'm not picking
[1:39:57] on no churches but just memories uh uh
[1:39:59] uh under cloverdale bible way under
[1:40:01] living word under grace tabernacle under
[1:40:04] uh uh evening light under this is how
[1:40:08] your
[1:40:09] no no
[1:40:10] he said
[1:40:11] you take it back
[1:40:13] to the word
[1:40:14] and when it comes back to the word
[1:40:17] you'll be able to look at the word of
[1:40:18] god and you'll be able to say praise the
[1:40:20] lord it lines up and then he told you
[1:40:22] after that when it all lined up go pray
[1:40:24] about it
[1:40:26] not just it lined up let's go
[1:40:28] but look at this my brother and sister
[1:40:31] they're coming
[1:40:32] and there's a spirit moving
[1:40:37] denominational spirit moving
[1:40:42] not
[1:40:43] god's spirit
[1:40:45] the spirit of man moving
[1:40:48] and so i told them uh yeah if i can be
[1:40:50] in charge
[1:41:05] come on saints
[1:41:08] strange how these invitations always
[1:41:10] include you
[1:41:12] sitting down and shutting up
[1:41:14] while we
[1:41:16] describe what the baseline of our belief
[1:41:18] is
[1:41:19] no i'm sorry i'm sorry and you'll
[1:41:22] realize i why i can't shut up and i'll
[1:41:24] share that in just a minute it's a quote
[1:41:25] i've quoted many times it's been on my
[1:41:27] heart so much in these last few months
[1:41:29] it just has dominated my thinking amen
[1:41:32] and i say amen so what happens i'll
[1:41:35] bring my sheep together
[1:41:39] yes yes
[1:41:40] that's it thank you for pointing that
[1:41:42] out brother david i'll bring my sheep
[1:41:44] together amen not great ministry you
[1:41:46] know my brother and sister oh my excuse
[1:41:48] me
[1:41:49] listen this signs will bear a record of
[1:41:51] the same
[1:41:52] and when he does what happens and his
[1:41:54] signs will bow record of the same that's
[1:41:56] how israel could say before they got
[1:41:58] mixed up with moab
[1:42:00] oh my goodness so there's a time israel
[1:42:02] could confess that
[1:42:04] and this was a pillar of fire over them
[1:42:06] yes sir what will he do he'll bear
[1:42:08] record the same kind of a record but
[1:42:10] after they got disassociated and so with
[1:42:13] god separated their oneness between them
[1:42:16] and god and got in with moab and them
[1:42:18] the victory all failed
[1:42:21] oh my brother and sister it wasn't
[1:42:22] necessarily oh i hope i'm not offensive
[1:42:25] this morning but it wasn't necessarily
[1:42:27] that the enemy come crashed the gate
[1:42:29] down
[1:42:30] took and pillaged and and raped and
[1:42:32] whatever and went on i know my brother
[1:42:34] and sister what happened is the spirit
[1:42:36] of the age started coming in upon the
[1:42:38] young girls and upon the young boys and
[1:42:40] started coming in on the parents and
[1:42:42] people said don't criticize me this is
[1:42:44] what my parents do when nobody's looking
[1:42:53] and the victory all failed they stayed
[1:42:55] in the wilderness for 40 more years till
[1:42:57] god raised up another group to go over
[1:42:59] and complete his plan that's exactly
[1:43:02] what they did now here look at that my
[1:43:04] brother and sister what's happening here
[1:43:06] amen moab was a type of the worldly
[1:43:08] church amen they possessed enough of the
[1:43:12] word to claim association
[1:43:14] aren't we all found
[1:43:16] now i don't want to sound like i'm
[1:43:17] venting but i'm just making these points
[1:43:19] i've received amongst these phone calls
[1:43:21] that i have received in this last year
[1:43:23] and a half or so i've heard these words
[1:43:25] spoke to me more than once and it is
[1:43:27] well aren't we all one
[1:43:32] uh no let me explain something to you
[1:43:35] we are not one
[1:43:36] when it comes to the word of god we are
[1:43:39] seventh cousins
[1:43:42] twice removed
[1:43:45] no sorry
[1:43:47] we have the same message we're quoting
[1:43:48] the same quotes we're reporting the same
[1:43:51] scriptures we we have the same overall
[1:43:53] you might say umbrella of identity
[1:43:58] moab had enough to claim association
[1:44:01] they had the right offering
[1:44:03] the right altar they had all the right
[1:44:06] things many of their sacraments were
[1:44:08] correct
[1:44:11] but it's what they did after they left
[1:44:13] church
[1:44:14] that set them apart
[1:44:16] they were adulterers they were
[1:44:18] fornicators they were liars and they
[1:44:20] were thieves
[1:44:22] they were idol worshipers
[1:44:25] but they had the right form
[1:44:27] of worship
[1:44:29] what was missing
[1:44:31] not the fundamental saints they had all
[1:44:32] the fundamentals right
[1:44:34] it was the spirit of god that was
[1:44:36] missing
[1:44:37] it was not with them but i'm saying here
[1:44:40] as long as that before they got mixed up
[1:44:42] with moab israel had the spirit of god
[1:44:44] with them
[1:44:45] now look at how beautiful this is
[1:44:47] i i hope shift gears
[1:44:49] from all that negative stuff i just
[1:44:52] preached to you
[1:44:55] look how beautiful it is
[1:44:58] god's group
[1:45:00] look at it now raised up
[1:45:04] god was raising up a group
[1:45:07] look at this saints i hope you i want
[1:45:08] you to see these spiritual types amen i
[1:45:11] hope i'm not just went radical off the
[1:45:13] end
[1:45:15] right here in our day we have that
[1:45:17] picture perfect wow these are down here
[1:45:20] worshiping with moab and you know my
[1:45:22] brother and sister they're singing and
[1:45:24] dancing getting drunk and doing all of
[1:45:26] these things they shouldn't be doing
[1:45:28] that wasn't all of israel
[1:45:31] that wasn't all of israel that was down
[1:45:33] there
[1:45:34] there was a group over here that says
[1:45:36] it's been a long time and this journey
[1:45:39] through this wilderness of sin has been
[1:45:41] hard but i tell you what i remember what
[1:45:44] my daddy said that his daddy said that
[1:45:47] his daddy said that his daddy said that
[1:45:50] we've seen this supernatural and the
[1:45:52] word of god is forever living and we are
[1:45:56] here as living epistles read of all men
[1:46:00] and we will not family
[1:46:04] we're going to get branded as radicals
[1:46:06] we're going to get branded as whatever
[1:46:08] but we're not going
[1:46:09] to moab's altar amen if we're going to
[1:46:12] offer a sacrifice to god we're going to
[1:46:15] bring our own lamb we're going to do it
[1:46:17] on our own altar and we're going to do
[1:46:19] it in the right atmosphere
[1:46:22] but daddy what sets us different honey
[1:46:25] this sounds boastful this sounds almost
[1:46:27] arrogant this sounds like we think we're
[1:46:30] really something but the spirit of god
[1:46:32] is here and the spirit of god is not
[1:46:35] there and we are not going to worship
[1:46:38] somewhere that we know the spirit of god
[1:46:40] is not present
[1:46:51] did you see what
[1:46:52] happened the victory failed
[1:47:00] daddy where's mama
[1:47:03] honey i really don't want to talk about
[1:47:05] it
[1:47:06] okay daddy let me rephrase this
[1:47:10] jimmy next door says that mama ran off
[1:47:12] with so-and-so
[1:47:15] oh honey it's it's all right it's just
[1:47:19] the age
[1:47:20] we live in
[1:47:23] mommy where's daddy
[1:47:26] honey i don't talk about it
[1:47:29] oh mommy bobby over here says
[1:47:33] he saw daddy
[1:47:35] down there
[1:47:36] at the bar with his arm around
[1:47:39] some half-dressed woman
[1:47:43] oh honey
[1:47:45] i'm sad to tell you but
[1:47:47] that's just what the 21st century is
[1:47:49] like
[1:47:51] we all still love the lord
[1:47:53] and you'll see daddy at church this
[1:47:55] sunday
[1:47:57] come on saints
[1:48:00] i might hang out in a different circle
[1:48:02] than you do
[1:48:04] but we hear such
[1:48:06] we hear such
[1:48:08] no sir i'm not down here at some
[1:48:10] denominational church
[1:48:14] i'm hearing this
[1:48:16] in the midst
[1:48:18] of israel amen
[1:48:23] what's the difference saints
[1:48:28] spirit of god
[1:48:30] where the spirit of god
[1:48:32] there's liberty
[1:48:34] not liberty to sin
[1:48:36] but liberty
[1:48:37] to take brother trevor
[1:48:39] than boat cutters
[1:48:41] brother this is a pretty big bolt here
[1:48:43] help me
[1:48:44] you take that handle i'll take this one
[1:48:55] saints just so you know i'm tipping over
[1:48:56] the edge
[1:48:58] tipping over the only it's not this edge
[1:49:02] i'm tipping over this edge
[1:49:05] because you see
[1:49:07] satan's here
[1:49:09] he's here trying to push the darkness
[1:49:12] amen what's that little story saying
[1:49:17] darkness
[1:49:18] is just
[1:49:20] the absence
[1:49:22] of light
[1:49:25] look at this god's group
[1:49:27] been raised up that's what the prophet
[1:49:29] of god says see amen till god raised up
[1:49:32] another group
[1:49:34] to go over and complete his plan god's
[1:49:36] got a group he's raising them up the
[1:49:39] word is raising them up it might be a
[1:49:42] really small group in comparison to the
[1:49:44] world saints but i'll tell you what we
[1:49:45] ought to rejoice chris tabernacle can we
[1:49:47] rejoice that god said no if i'm not
[1:49:49] going to let your standard go down i'm
[1:49:51] actually going to raise up your standard
[1:49:53] and this is going to go up and up and
[1:49:55] i'm going to raise you up and up and up
[1:49:57] and up and up because i have a plan that
[1:50:00] i spoke out and i predestinated this to
[1:50:02] happen and somebody's going to fulfill
[1:50:05] this plan and i've chose you
[1:50:07] now we should be over here saying thank
[1:50:09] you lord thank you lord you chose me you
[1:50:11] chose me oh lord you chose me hallelujah
[1:50:15] not woe unto me you know i'm trying to
[1:50:17] live a christian life woe unto me no my
[1:50:19] brother and sister thank you lord
[1:50:22] thank you lord that you have chosen us
[1:50:25] to help complete your plan
[1:50:27] you see it won't be by an accident it
[1:50:30] won't be by circumstance it won't be by
[1:50:32] a distant association but he has raised
[1:50:35] up and identified people by the word
[1:50:39] oh that gives my heart joy
[1:50:42] hallelujah
[1:50:44] now
[1:50:45] this coming quote here has been on my
[1:50:47] mind a lot lately and i want you to
[1:50:49] understand
[1:50:51] the most important powerful ministry in
[1:50:53] your life
[1:50:54] is not a man
[1:50:58] the most important powerful ministry in
[1:51:01] your life
[1:51:02] is the holy ghost
[1:51:04] the spirit of christ
[1:51:06] the spirit of the lord
[1:51:09] dealing with you
[1:51:11] praise the lord now we're going to take
[1:51:12] an informal poll this morning
[1:51:14] hope you don't mind
[1:51:18] it's going to be you know anonymous but
[1:51:20] we'll pass out paper and you'll write
[1:51:21] your name on it
[1:51:28] i hope you follow me real careful
[1:51:32] as brother paul ever said anything
[1:51:35] that changed your life
[1:51:41] yeah it's a trick question
[1:51:50] now to all of you that said no just go
[1:51:51] ahead and raise your hand that'd be fine
[1:51:56] chickens
[1:52:03] paul
[1:52:05] has never
[1:52:07] once
[1:52:09] spoke a single thing
[1:52:12] that changed your life
[1:52:15] because if i possess that kind of power
[1:52:18] get prepared
[1:52:20] for a radical change
[1:52:24] are you with me now
[1:52:28] it's a spirit of the lord
[1:52:32] and he's kind and he's patient
[1:52:34] and he just works on us
[1:52:37] and he just works on us
[1:52:39] and this is how it works saints
[1:52:41] just so you won't feel bad about what's
[1:52:43] happened in your life
[1:52:45] god starts cleaning you up
[1:52:47] and we know it's god right we know it's
[1:52:49] the lord
[1:52:50] and he cleans us up
[1:52:52] and we're like praise the lord
[1:52:54] the chains of that circumstance are gone
[1:52:56] thank you lord and then you feel
[1:53:00] the brillo pad
[1:53:01] come right back
[1:53:03] and starts cleaning us again
[1:53:06] you see we multifaceted
[1:53:10] and when we found deliverance
[1:53:12] through the word the moving of the
[1:53:14] spirit
[1:53:16] that unlocks the door for him to come
[1:53:18] and deal with the next
[1:53:22] and with the next
[1:53:24] and with the next
[1:53:26] you know they say that pressure
[1:53:28] is good it brings out the best in you
[1:53:33] amen
[1:53:34] i don't like pressure
[1:53:38] no i'm sorry i don't like pressure
[1:53:41] what's much more beneficial
[1:53:44] than god having to pump up the pressure
[1:53:49] is for us
[1:53:50] to yield
[1:53:54] when god comes with his brillo pat i've
[1:53:56] told you about my grandmother
[1:53:58] my grandmother anne
[1:54:01] you're spending the night at my house
[1:54:02] child you ain't leaving here with dirty
[1:54:04] elbows
[1:54:06] they're gonna be bright red like a
[1:54:07] stoplight but they won't be dirty
[1:54:10] you see we can either yield and let the
[1:54:12] holy spirit move
[1:54:14] and come down
[1:54:16] and i said
[1:54:17] now let me put it in this way
[1:54:20] the prophet of god about this and
[1:54:23] certainly there's lots of counselors
[1:54:25] talked about this but
[1:54:26] one of the greatest encouraging things
[1:54:28] to a man and brothers you can all thank
[1:54:30] me and pay me later
[1:54:33] is when you walk in the door
[1:54:36] i have a wife that's there
[1:54:38] you didn't pay off the trash this
[1:54:39] morning
[1:54:42] that just makes the guys like i just
[1:54:44] love coming home
[1:54:49] i don't know
[1:54:51] look
[1:54:57] what a man likes is when he opens the
[1:54:59] door and his wife is there
[1:55:02] and she's like
[1:55:03] hi honey
[1:55:05] thank you for working hard for me
[1:55:08] thank you
[1:55:10] and he slips his arms around her
[1:55:14] and there's something just changes an
[1:55:16] atmosphere
[1:55:24] what is it
[1:55:27] a yielding
[1:55:30] she yielded to him
[1:55:32] he yielded to her
[1:55:35] and all of those other things
[1:55:38] yes he did get the trash
[1:55:40] out of
[1:55:43] the garbage can
[1:55:46] and he did set it
[1:55:47] close to the back door to take out
[1:55:52] but he forgot his hat he turned and
[1:55:54] found his hat and then it's chilly out
[1:55:56] there i'll get back it and then he
[1:55:59] walked out the door
[1:56:02] and when his wife comes to the back door
[1:56:05] all she sees
[1:56:10] is trash
[1:56:13] and not only that the triple seal hefty
[1:56:15] bang
[1:56:17] doesn't hold water like they said
[1:56:25] and the day is lit
[1:56:30] but you see god's raised up
[1:56:32] a group that's going to go over
[1:56:35] and she's going to complete the plan
[1:56:37] and that plan is i
[1:56:40] will have a people holy submitted
[1:56:43] to me
[1:56:45] a people that says if it's not in the
[1:56:47] word
[1:56:48] i'm not in it
[1:56:50] if it's not your spirit lord do you know
[1:56:53] we can have the truth saints
[1:56:55] and have totally the wrong attitude
[1:56:58] we can possess the truth like a hammer
[1:57:01] but without the right spirit
[1:57:04] we are the one who's wrong
[1:57:07] oh my
[1:57:09] but look
[1:57:10] i oh sorry to be so presumptuous
[1:57:14] amen i've been raised up
[1:57:17] and the word of god shows us there's not
[1:57:18] a generation to come
[1:57:20] there's not a church age messenger to
[1:57:22] come there's not another season to come
[1:57:24] so i want to ask you a direct question
[1:57:26] today are you that group or not
[1:57:29] amen and if we're that group let's claim

[1:57:48] friends to
[1:57:50] my daughters
[1:57:51] young lady it was like a daughter to us
[1:57:53] many years ago
[1:57:56] and uh
[1:57:58] they had his funeral yesterday
[1:58:00] we prayed for carl
[1:58:03] and you know it's just interesting
[1:58:05] saints that you
[1:58:07] you listen as they're speaking and
[1:58:10] i i enjoyed this uh we were just
[1:58:12] watching it online
[1:58:15] um
[1:58:16] i enjoyed this and
[1:58:18] there was a bikerish bikerish-looking
[1:58:19] dude there
[1:58:25] and he said when i met carl
[1:58:29] he told me
[1:58:31] you're going to be my project
[1:58:35] the guy 7th day adventist but still
[1:58:38] changed life
[1:58:40] because someone looked at him and said
[1:58:43] my ministry
[1:58:44] is standing right here in front of me
[1:58:47] i'm gonna this is my uh this is where i
[1:58:50] get to do my part for the lord i get to
[1:58:53] show the spirit of christ i need to just
[1:58:55] i get to show the spirit of the lord
[1:58:56] this guy's got long stringy hair and
[1:58:58] he's a biker and he's rough and he's
[1:59:00] scary
[1:59:01] but something in me
[1:59:04] says
[1:59:04] you're going to be my project
[1:59:08] imagine how you'd feel your biker i
[1:59:09] could squish you with one hand and kick
[1:59:11] you to the curb
[1:59:13] but there was something there
[1:59:15] you see god
[1:59:17] has
[1:59:18] a people
[1:59:20] who's got a ministry
[1:59:22] now we'll close here sister emmy would
[1:59:24] you please come that way i i will have
[1:59:26] to
[1:59:29] now i've read this in the church here
[1:59:31] many many times through the years
[1:59:33] but i love i love this quote
[1:59:37] a momentary consideration of church
[1:59:39] history will prove how accurate this
[1:59:41] thought is in the dark ages the word was
[1:59:43] almost entirely lost to the people
[1:59:45] but god sent luther with the word the
[1:59:48] lutheran spoke for god at that time but
[1:59:50] they organized and again the pure word
[1:59:52] was lost for organization tends towards
[1:59:55] dogma and creeds
[2:00:00] if you preach more than 45 minutes
[2:00:01] you're out of the will of god because
[2:00:03] that's what brother branham says
[2:00:05] it's right you realize how long we've
[2:00:07] been out of the word of god saints
[2:00:11] i'm sorry when i was a newbie as a
[2:00:12] pastor as a minister
[2:00:14] i still couldn't
[2:00:16] preach for 45 minutes
[2:00:18] that was just the warm-up
[2:00:22] so what do we do we create dogmas and
[2:00:24] creeds
[2:00:25] not the simple word
[2:00:27] they could no longer speak for god then
[2:00:29] god sent wesley and he was the voice
[2:00:31] with the word in his day and the people
[2:00:33] who took his revelation from god became
[2:00:35] the living epistles read and known of
[2:00:37] all men for their generation
[2:00:41] and when the method has failed god
[2:00:43] raised up others and so it has gone on
[2:00:45] through the years until in this last day
[2:00:48] now don't read any further i know some
[2:00:50] of you could quote a verbatim but don't
[2:00:51] read any further
[2:00:53] in this last day
[2:00:56] okay so let's not look back when brother
[2:00:58] branham was here
[2:01:01] this message my brother and sister the
[2:01:03] proof that this message is true
[2:01:05] is what
[2:01:09] there's a bride on the earth today
[2:01:12] there's the vindication saints we can
[2:01:14] look and say well brother branham uh uh
[2:01:16] prophesied and it came to pass brother
[2:01:18] branham uh read their uh you know
[2:01:20] discern the intents of their heart and
[2:01:22] that was true and and that's that's a
[2:01:24] vindication
[2:01:26] now the real vindication sitting here
[2:01:28] this morning
[2:01:30] men and women filled with the holy ghost
[2:01:32] raising families filled with the holy
[2:01:34] ghost that's exactly what the word said
[2:01:36] it would
[2:01:37] there's our vindication
[2:01:39] hallelujah you know you can draw
[2:01:40] something out
[2:01:42] you can draw something out i just was
[2:01:44] watching this deal kind of got
[2:01:46] interested recently in machining work
[2:01:48] and and these guys had all these
[2:01:49] blueprints but nobody had actually
[2:01:51] verified that the point something
[2:01:53] something of this and the four point
[2:01:55] this this to the decimal point of
[2:01:56] whatever brother jason kind of knows he
[2:01:58] was in the bigger steel but now they do
[2:02:00] stuff in this major and uh when you add
[2:02:03] up the two point blah blah and the three
[2:02:05] point the one point this point point
[2:02:07] that point and they're greater than
[2:02:10] the overall measurement
[2:02:14] when you get down to the end
[2:02:15] you've got a problem because that one
[2:02:17] hole's out here
[2:02:19] in no man's land
[2:02:21] right so it's all gonna line up
[2:02:23] no matter how perfect the machine is
[2:02:27] millions of dollars in these cnc
[2:02:29] machines controlled by computers with
[2:02:32] men who have to write very intricate
[2:02:35] programs to make it all work
[2:02:38] men who make hundreds of thousands a
[2:02:40] year just because they can program that
[2:02:42] machine
[2:02:43] but if it doesn't all dovetail
[2:02:47] we got nothing
[2:02:49] so what was it is
[2:02:51] until in this last day
[2:02:55] what we read earlier
[2:02:57] is the people that got raised up
[2:03:01] this last day another people
[2:03:03] in the land
[2:03:05] who under their messenger
[2:03:08] right we're not trying to step out
[2:03:09] people are like
[2:03:10] you guys are saying something the
[2:03:11] prophet didn't say
[2:03:13] you know imagine that saints you wonder
[2:03:16] sometimes where people are at
[2:03:18] individual look you in the face and say
[2:03:19] you are not allowed to read between the
[2:03:21] lines
[2:03:22] one moment
[2:03:28] the prophet of god says you will read
[2:03:31] between the lies
[2:03:32] now what kind of spirit would lead
[2:03:34] somebody to try to keep you
[2:03:37] in the dark
[2:03:40] young people i we're just gonna we're
[2:03:42] gonna dumb you down i'm gonna dumb you
[2:03:44] down so far that when we tell you in
[2:03:46] church to stand on your head you're
[2:03:48] gonna ask for how long
[2:03:50] no sir
[2:03:52] we're gonna enlighten you by the word of
[2:03:53] god
[2:03:54] that you can take every spirit and test
[2:03:57] it
[2:03:58] every spirit intestine
[2:04:03] to say under their messenger
[2:04:07] will be
[2:04:11] the final
[2:04:14] final
[2:04:16] can somebody tell me what the word final
[2:04:17] means
[2:04:19] [Music]
[2:04:24] you're all right
[2:04:26] sister carrie's like real simple final
[2:04:28] periods
[2:04:29] [Laughter]
[2:04:31] no look saints
[2:04:34] the voice in the land is what
[2:04:38] the work is finished
[2:04:41] christ has come
[2:04:44] word is manifested now it's coming to
[2:04:46] fruit
[2:04:48] you know i'm going to eat of the fruit
[2:04:49] of the tree when the tree gets another
[2:04:50] 20 feet taller
[2:04:52] sorry this is
[2:04:54] all the bigger the word comes because
[2:04:56] it's coming to maturity it's not going
[2:04:58] to come well when we see this
[2:05:01] come on i don't want to hurt anybody's
[2:05:02] feelings i know we have family and
[2:05:04] friends and whatnot
[2:05:07] but there's nowhere in the scripture for
[2:05:09] us to just start adding to the book he
[2:05:11] didn't leave
[2:05:12] a lot of empty pages at the back of the
[2:05:14] book for us to just to do it in fact
[2:05:18] if there was another
[2:05:20] book of acts written
[2:05:23] not when another book is written but if
[2:05:25] there was
[2:05:27] we would be writing it saints do you
[2:05:29] realize that
[2:05:30] god's not going to raise up someone else
[2:05:32] to write that book of acts
[2:05:34] he would commission you
[2:05:36] and if there was another book of acts
[2:05:38] written to be recorded for another
[2:05:40] generation to look at they would be
[2:05:42] seeing people with names
[2:05:46] that
[2:05:46] resembled your names
[2:05:48] [Music]
[2:05:52] sister miriam
[2:05:55] there's a miriam in the bible
[2:05:57] and if there was another book of acts
[2:05:58] written it would be miriam in this day
[2:06:02] that would record once again
[2:06:05] believing the word of god
[2:06:07] hallelujah look saints
[2:06:09] we come under that messenger and i'm
[2:06:12] proud to be i'm not ashamed at all of
[2:06:14] what i believe i'm not ashamed of where
[2:06:17] i come from i'm not ashamed of who god
[2:06:19] said i am amen and i will under that you
[2:06:23] know what that is that's the ultimate
[2:06:25] sign of respect
[2:06:27] to come
[2:06:28] and say here's the revelation god gave a
[2:06:31] prophet to our day
[2:06:33] and that word has come down and becomes
[2:06:35] so real in me
[2:06:37] that i'm gonna go live
[2:06:40] i'm gonna go
[2:06:42] live
[2:06:44] one more anecdotal thing reminds me of a
[2:06:47] guy
[2:06:48] bought a swing set like a lot of men he
[2:06:50] told his little girl honey i'll have
[2:06:52] this swing set set up for your birthday
[2:06:54] party
[2:06:55] so there he is
[2:06:57] in the dark in the backyard he can't
[2:07:00] read the directions so he throws the
[2:07:01] directions away
[2:07:03] and he's putting it all together and
[2:07:06] here's this one board the holes line up
[2:07:09] but it's too long
[2:07:11] and he's out there in the backyard
[2:07:14] these ridiculous people
[2:07:16] can't even get their boards done
[2:07:19] takes that thing
[2:07:20] cuts it off puts it in place
[2:07:23] [Music]
[2:07:24] in the morning he gets up and his wife
[2:07:26] says honey
[2:07:28] where's the handrail for the playstation
[2:07:32] he looked around and here was a board
[2:07:34] and he picks it up
[2:07:35] it was up there
[2:07:37] the holes line up
[2:07:40] but it's too short
[2:07:42] [Music]
[2:07:46] don't
[2:07:47] try to change the word
[2:07:50] the prophet said god was going to raise
[2:07:53] up a people
[2:07:54] instead of trying to question who where
[2:07:56] how why don't we look at that and say
[2:07:58] lord can i be that people
[2:08:00] if you're going to do something
[2:08:01] supernatural and you're going to pour
[2:08:03] your spirit out our young men and our
[2:08:05] daughters are going to prophesy lord can
[2:08:07] it be our young men can it be our
[2:08:09] daughters
[2:08:11] lord can we sit here and say lord if
[2:08:14] someone's going to receive the spirit of
[2:08:16] god lord let it be me
[2:08:19] let it be our church i don't feel like i
[2:08:22] fit lord but i i'm not gonna try and
[2:08:24] change myself because i believe your
[2:08:26] plan is perfect
[2:08:27] i'm not gonna look and say you know this
[2:08:29] sister she'd be better this way and i'd
[2:08:32] rather be better that way i believe god
[2:08:34] knows what he's doing saints just let
[2:08:36] god be god in our life and let the
[2:08:39] spirit of the living god come down in
[2:08:41] our midst and instead of looking and
[2:08:44] backing up from that of like i don't
[2:08:45] know where they're going but i'm why
[2:08:47] don't you stop and say lord show me the
[2:08:50] way i'm supposed to go
[2:08:51] [Music]
[2:08:52] show me lord the way i'm supposed to go
[2:08:56] let the spirit of the living god come
[2:08:58] down and speak to my life and change me

[2:09:03] saints and i'm not pushing you out of my
[2:09:05] mind but you know more and more i'm
[2:09:07] focusing lord help me be right

[2:09:25] a project

[2:09:30] a holy ghost testimony

[2:10:10] in a youth camp and i gave my heart to

[2:10:24] there's men and women
[2:10:25] see they were boys and girls but they're
[2:10:27] men and women now
[2:10:29] they walked away
[2:10:31] i know of many cases right now we won't
[2:10:32] mention names and places not all right
[2:10:34] but they walked away at the same time of
[2:10:37] life that i walked away and this is why
[2:10:39] it moves me so much they walked away by
[2:10:42] god's grace it was still 20 years for me
[2:10:45] to make my way back
[2:10:47] they're now
[2:10:48] 50 47
[2:10:50] to 56 years later

[2:11:35] mom and dad have quit
[2:11:37] the message
[2:11:40] anointed by a spirit
[2:11:42] i believe the holy spirit the little boy
[2:11:45] comes into the kitchen
[2:11:47] one evening
[2:11:49] it says mom and dad
[2:11:52] 10 years old no one thinks a 10 year old
[2:11:54] spiritual
[2:11:56] 10 years old says mom and dad we've made
[2:11:58] a mistake
[2:12:00] we need to go back to church
[2:12:03] mom and dad says we are not going back
[2:12:06] that is a cult
[2:12:07] [Music]

[2:12:12] years
[2:12:13] later
[2:12:14] [Music]
[2:12:16] that boy
[2:12:18] finds himself in an altar
[2:12:23] and for 50 years all i've thought about
[2:12:26] is why did my mom and dad do this to me
[2:12:32] i wanna want you to catch this
[2:12:35] what stopped him he knew
[2:12:37] he knew in his heart where he belonged

[2:12:46] a spirit
[2:12:48] a spirit of scarecrows
[2:12:50] a spirit of darkness a spirit of fear
[2:12:53] a spirit of will they accept me
[2:12:56] a spirit of this and a spirit of that
[2:12:59] that finally broke through
[2:13:02] found himself in an altar weeping giving
[2:13:04] heart back to the lord
[2:13:07] god giving deliverance to him
[2:13:09] of 50 years of chains
[2:13:13] come on saints

[2:16:44] testimony recently
[2:16:46] with a young boy
[2:16:49] coming in the presence of god

[2:16:56] some pentecostal thing tell them that's
[2:16:58] not god that's not god that's not god
[2:17:01] he walked away
[2:17:03] a lot of years have went by

[2:22:21] amen
[2:22:24] john saw the believers
[2:22:28] do you believed and saw the believers
[2:22:30] amen
[2:22:32] you believe john saw you
[2:22:35] because if you were in the number of the
[2:22:37] believers that john saw john saw you
[2:22:41] now i'm going to bring that a little
[2:22:42] closer home the prophet of god goes
[2:22:44] there and he sees all the believers in
[2:22:46] their national attire walking amen and
[2:22:50] he saw that worldly church moab
[2:22:53] he saw her prancing along she thought
[2:22:56] she was so gorgeous and no doubt in the
[2:22:58] physical realm she maybe was but he saw
[2:23:00] her in the way that she thought was
[2:23:03] serving god and brother branham's heart
[2:23:05] breaks and then he's like oh no and then
[2:23:07] he hears this onward christian soldier
[2:23:10] and he sees the bride in every national
[2:23:13] dress and whatever coming over and he
[2:23:15] sees them going by you believe the
[2:23:17] prophet saw you
[2:23:19] hallelujah he didn't say i saw a few
[2:23:22] people he said he saw the bride
[2:23:24] hallelujah so look at the continuity is
[2:23:27] god allows on to see the bride why
[2:23:29] because he's showing john the clear
[2:23:31] picture
[2:23:33] and he saw brother brown was allowed to
[2:23:34] see the bride because he was showing
[2:23:37] brother branham the clear picture
[2:23:40] hallelujah not an abstract not well
[2:23:44] there will be something like this he
[2:23:46] showed him the actual bride of jesus
[2:23:50] christ and i want to go a step further
[2:23:52] if i can this morning or afternoon
[2:23:54] whatever you want to call it amen when
[2:23:57] you come to jesus christ i hope you
[2:24:00] didn't see some abstract picture i hope
[2:24:03] you saw him jesus christ the word
[2:24:07] hallelujah he said i don't want you to
[2:24:10] just have some abstract thought of who i
[2:24:12] am in this final age the revelation of
[2:24:17] jesus christ would be made manifest
[2:24:21] hallelujah oh my goodness my brother and
