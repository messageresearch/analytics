[6:00] one of you. Amen.
[6:04] Well, I feel exhausted this
[6:07] morning under the sun and doing things
[6:10] yesterday, but I was telling brother
[6:12] Paul, I said my body feels tired, but
[6:14] like I have a lot of like deep down
[6:17] inside. So hopefully you got that same
[6:20] that same energy. Amen. Believe it's the
[6:23] life of Christ within us.
[6:24] Amen. Amen. I'd like to start. This
[6:27] song's been on my mind the last week.

[6:31] Our trials will soon be over.
[6:37] Amen. We're floating down the stream of
[6:42] time. We have not long to
[6:46] stay. The stormy clouds of
[6:50] darkness will turn to brightest
[6:55] day. Then let us all take courage.
[7:00] For we're not left
[7:03] alone. The lifeboat soon is
[7:07] coming to gather the jewel
[7:12] home. Cheer my brother,

[7:31] strangers here. We're seeking a city to
[7:36] come. The lifeboat soon is coming to
[7:41] gather the jewels home.
[7:45] Sometimes the devil tempts me and says
[7:50] it's all in
[7:52] vain to try and live a Christian life
[7:57] and walk in Jesus
[8:00] name. But then we hear the master say,
[8:06] "I'll lend you a helping hand.
[8:10] And if you'll only trust in me, I'll
[8:14] guide you to that
[8:17] land. Then cheer, my brother,
[8:21] cheer. Our trials will soon
[8:25] be. Our love ones we shall meet, shall
[8:30] meet upon that golden
[8:34] shore. We're pilgrims and we're
[8:37] strangers here. We're seeking a city to
[8:42] come. The lifeboat soon is coming to
[8:48] gather the jewels
[8:51] home. The lifeboat soon is
[8:55] coming. By eyes of faith, I
[8:59] see as she sweeps through the
[9:03] waters to rescue you and me.
[9:08] and land us safely in the port with
[9:12] friends we love so
[9:16] dear ready cries the
[9:19] captain oh look she's almost

[9:48] come. A lifeboat soon is
[9:52] coming to gather the jewels
[9:56] home. Oh, now's the time to get on board
[10:01] while she is passing by.
[10:05] But if you stand and wait too long, you
[10:10] shall forever
[10:12] die. The fair is paid for one and all.
[10:17] The captain bids you
[10:20] come and get on board the
[10:24] lifeboat. She'll carry you safely
[10:29] home. Then cheer, my brother.
[10:33] Cheer. Our trials will soon be
[10:37] whole. Our loved ones we shall meet
[10:41] shall meet upon that golden
[10:45] shore. We're pilgrims and we're

[27:55] so you all just worship with me. Um, but
[27:57] I just couldn't get off my mind. Even

[28:56] I've had many tears and
[28:59] sorrows. I've had questions for
[29:04] tomorrow. Many times I didn't know right
[29:08] from wrong.
[29:11] But in every
[29:15] situation, God gave blessed
[29:19] consolation that my trials come to only
[29:23] make me
[29:28] strong. Through it all, just sing it
[29:31] with
[29:32] me. Through it

[29:41] Jesus. I've learned to trust in
[29:46] God. Through it
[29:50] all, through it
[29:53] all, I've learned to depend upon his
[29:59] word.
[30:03] I've been a lot of places and I've seen
[30:08] a lot of
[30:10] faces. But there have been times I felt
[30:14] so all along.
[30:20] In my lonely
[30:22] hours, those precious lonely
[30:26] hours, Jesus let me know that I'm still
[30:31] one of his
[30:35] own. Through it
[30:39] all, through it
[30:43] all, I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[30:48] I've learned to trust in
[30:51] God. Through it
[30:55] all. Through it
[30:59] all, I've learned to depend upon his
[31:04] word.
[31:08] So I thank God for the mountains and I
[31:12] thank him for the
[31:15] valleys and I thank him for the storms
[31:19] he's brought me
[31:23] through. For if I never had a
[31:28] problem, I didn't know that he could
[31:31] solve them. I didn't know what faith in
[31:35] God could do.
[31:40] Through it
[31:43] all, through it
[31:47] all, I've learned to trust in
[31:51] Jesus. I've learned to trust in
[31:55] God. Through it
[31:59] all, through it
[32:03] all, I've learned to depend upon you,
[32:13] through it all.
[32:17] Through it
[32:20] all, I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[32:25] I've learned to trust in
[32:29] God. Through it
[32:32] all. Through it
[32:36] all, I've learned to depend upon his
[32:44] word. Through it
[32:49] all, through it
[32:53] all, I've learned to trust in
[32:57] Jesus. I've learned to trust in God.
[33:03] Through it
[33:06] all, through it
[33:10] all, I've learned to depend upon his
[33:15] word.
[33:19] Amen. Amen. Thank you, Sister
[33:22] Ruth. Hallelujah.
[33:30] Amen. Thank you that I've learned to
[33:34] Whatever whatever comes my way, just go

[38:01] covers me there with his
[38:08] hand and
[38:10] covers me
[38:12] there with his hand.
[38:18] and trolled in his
[38:22] brightness.
[38:24] Transported I
[38:27] rise to meet him in clouds of the
[38:36] sky. His
[38:38] perfect
[38:41] salvation, his
[38:43] wonderful love.
[38:46] shall shout with the
[38:50] millions on
[38:54] high. He
[38:57] hideth my
[38:59] soul in the
[39:01] cliff of the
[39:04] rock that
[39:06] shadows a dry
[39:09] thirsty land.
[39:13] He
[39:15] hideth my
[39:17] life in the
[39:20] depths of his
[39:23] love and covers me there with his
[39:32] hand. And
[39:34] covers me
[39:37] there with his hand.
[39:43] Amen.
[39:45] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. As we
[39:49] change the order of the service, ask our
[39:51] brother Paul to come this morning. I'd
[39:52] like to sing number
[39:54] 826. Let's stand as we sing
[39:57] this. Lord, we come to you in worship.

[43:54] L

[44:00] long to
[44:03] worship you.
[44:10] Hello.
[44:12] Hello
[44:15] him. How I
[44:18] long to
[44:21] worship
[44:24] you. Hallelujah. Is it good to be in the
[44:27] house of the Lord today? Amen. As we
[44:30] look at this, I just really appreciated
[44:33] your special sister Ruth. The words of
[44:36] that song I feel like fit so perfectly
[44:40] what was on our heart today. Amen. And I
[44:43] just believe that fit in perfectly. I
[44:46] just want to definitely give a uh very
[44:50] happy Mother's Day to our mothers. Amen.
[44:53] Just uh a real blessing and uh God's
[44:56] blessed us with uh wonderful mothers in
[44:59] this assembly. Amen. and and uh just uh
[45:03] to see how God chooses to bring a
[45:07] heritage down. Uh he pro made a promise
[45:11] to
[45:12] Abraham that his seed would possess the
[45:15] gate of the
[45:16] enemy. But brother Brandham says that
[45:20] mother was the key. Amen. And so we so
[45:25] appreciate that. Amen. And um I know we
[45:28] don't normally make these announcements
[45:30] over the pulpit, but I just uh want to
[45:35] say happy birthday to my lovely wife. Uh
[45:40] she's been a wonderful wife, a wonderful
[45:44] mother. Uh just u such a support to me
[45:48] through the years and I I really
[45:51] appreciate her. She gets to celebrate
[45:53] both today. Amen. her birthday and
[45:57] Mother's
[46:00] Day. Amen. Before we go into the word, I
[46:04] also want to announce I I meant to do
[46:06] this last week and I I don't know where
[46:09] my thoughts were, but communion next
[46:11] Sunday, um May 18th, 5:00 p.m. here at
[46:15] the church. So, we look forward to that.
[46:18] Amen. Let's just uh turn to the word.
[46:22] Amen. I thank our musicians. Amen. Uh
[46:25] lovely song service. I appreciate that.
[46:28] It's a lovely atmosphere. Amen. Um Amen.
[46:32] God is good to us. I want to speak to
[46:35] you this morning on persuaded. Yes, sir.
[46:38] And uh there's only about 50 titles that
[46:41] I put uh already persuaded, fully
[46:45] persuaded. I will be persuaded. I you
[46:48] know, it just goes on and on. So, we
[46:50] just shortened it down. Uh, you know,
[46:53] uh, I was just reading yesterday and,
[46:56] um, Hebrews series and brother Brennham
[47:00] makes a comment how it seems like, I'm
[47:03] paraphrasing, it seems like too much for
[47:05] us, but God always breaks it down in
[47:09] simplicity. And so, as I've got these
[47:12] long lengthy titles, I was like, just
[47:14] break it down in simplicity and and
[47:17] we'll call that good. Amen. So good to
[47:20] see each and every one of you. Let's
[47:22] turn in our Bibles this morning to
[47:24] Romans the 4th chapter and u starting
[47:28] with the 13th verse. uh as we'll speak
[47:31] along this thought of persuaded I don't
[47:34] know um as the Lord would lay on our
[47:37] heart possibly there would be further uh
[47:41] um uh versions as it were of this uh
[47:46] maybe a part two or three who knows but
[47:49] uh because there's so much in the
[47:50] scripture that that deals with being
[47:53] persuaded amen to to do that because
[47:56] when you are persuaded you actually have
[47:59] a complete belief in what you are
[48:03] persuaded of. So anything short of a
[48:06] complete belief, you are not persuaded
[48:09] in the first place. Amen. Romans
[48:14] 4:13-2. For the promise that he should
[48:17] be heir of the world was not to Abraham
[48:20] or to his seed through the law, but
[48:23] through the righteousness of faith.
[48:25] That's right. For if they which are of
[48:27] the law be heirs, faith is made void,
[48:31] and the promise made of none effect.
[48:34] Because the law workketh wrath, and for
[48:37] where the no law is, there is no
[48:39] transgression. Therefore, for it is of
[48:42] faith, that it might be by grace. to the
[48:45] end the promise might be sure to all the
[48:48] seed. Not to that only which is of the
[48:51] law, but to that also which is of the
[48:54] faith of Abraham, who is the father of
[48:57] us all. Now, we recognize and the the
[49:01] prophet brings this out so clearly. We
[49:03] are not his genetic seed. We are his
[49:06] spiritual seed. Amen. And I have a
[49:09] choice. You have a choice. And I say,
[49:13] I'm fully persuaded I am his spiritual
[49:16] seed.
[49:18] Amen. You look at this. It's beautiful.
[49:22] As it is written, I've made thee a
[49:24] father of many nations before him whom
[49:27] he believed, even God who quickenth the
[49:30] dead, and calleth those things which be
[49:32] not as though they were. And if you have
[49:34] a need today that seems like it is not,
[49:37] it's time for you to start declaring
[49:40] that it is.
[49:42] Amen. Hallelujah.
[49:45] Who against hope believed in hope that
[49:47] he might become the father of many
[49:49] nations according to that which was
[49:51] spoken. So shall thy seed be. And being
[49:54] not weak in faith, he considered not his
[49:56] own body now dead when he was about a
[49:59] hundred years old, neither yet the
[50:01] deadness of Sarah's womb. He staggered
[50:04] not at the promise of God through
[50:06] unbelief, but was strong in faith,
[50:09] giving glory to God. So before he ever
[50:11] saw the manifestation, he was praising
[50:14] God for it. Amen. Lord, let that be a
[50:17] lesson to us. Amen. And being fully
[50:20] persuaded that what he had promised, he
[50:23] was able also to perform. And therefore
[50:26] it was imputed to him for righteousness.
[50:29] Now it was not written for his sake
[50:31] alone that it was imputed to him, but
[50:34] for us also to whom it shall be imputed.
[50:38] If we believe on him that raised up
[50:40] Jesus our Lord from the dead, who was
[50:42] delivered for our offenses and was
[50:44] raised again for our justification.
[50:48] Lord, we thank you for your word today.
[50:50] Ask you to bless this time in the house
[50:52] of God once again. Father, we just ask
[50:54] you to bless our mothers, Lord. Just uh
[50:57] thanking you for the godly example,
[50:59] Father, that has been given to them
[51:01] through the word. But Lord, we thank you
[51:04] for the manifestation of the godly
[51:06] example here in our midst of these
[51:09] faithful mothers, Lord, serving you,
[51:11] raising their children according to the
[51:13] word. I ask you, Father, bless them
[51:16] today in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[51:19] You may be seated. Amen.
[51:24] Now as we look at the word today
[51:28] uh of that
[51:30] we we want to come back and just visit
[51:33] for a moment the very fact that the
[51:38] emphasis here in verse 21 is that being
[51:42] fully persuaded and uh my brother and
[51:45] sister when one is fully persuaded it
[51:48] does not leave room for another opinion.
[51:51] It does not leave room for doubts and
[51:54] fears and question marks as it were. But
[51:57] being fully persuaded says I believe
[52:00] regardless of what my circumstance is.
[52:03] All of that I can see around him my but
[52:06] me looks like it wouldn't be so. But I'm
[52:09] persuaded. And my brother and sister, I
[52:12] I heard a a a man make a comment
[52:15] recently uh and not fully understanding
[52:18] what he said, but some of the words
[52:19] caught me. And he says, "I see in the
[52:23] physical realm not one bit of evidence
[52:27] of a rapture."
[52:31] Now, we could say just a second, but he
[52:33] said in a physical realm, not one bit of
[52:37] evidence for a rapture, but in my soul,
[52:42] I know I am already raptured in the name
[52:46] of Jesus Christ. So, you look at that,
[52:49] it's what we're going to look at, what
[52:50] we're going to see, and are we persuaded
[52:52] that we have to see it in the flesh? Now
[52:55] I do believe as the word is being
[52:57] ministered that what we take in in the
[52:59] word in our life each and every day will
[53:03] come to the surface in our life. In
[53:04] other words, we cannot say we're filled
[53:06] with the Holy Ghost without one shred of
[53:08] evidence in our natural life. God
[53:11] changes us to fit the word and that
[53:13] evidence comes forth. Now my brother and
[53:16] sister, you know, the world has a phrase
[53:18] for years and they my mama used to say,
[53:21] you know, I I used to live on Mountain
[53:23] Dew and Twinkies. you know, and she'd
[53:25] tell me, "You are what you eat." And I
[53:27] tell you, I'm a wreck. But now I'm
[53:30] eating different diet. Amen. And there
[53:32] was a time in our life that that we were
[53:34] what we ate of the things of the world,
[53:36] of this life out here. And that diet of
[53:40] affected us, but we thought the diet was
[53:42] okay. But one day, by God's grace, we
[53:45] woke up and realized what I'm eating is
[53:47] not who I want to be. And our diet
[53:50] changes to fit what our desire is. Amen.
[53:53] if you follow me. And so being fully
[53:56] persuaded that the promise had been
[53:58] made, my brother and sister, I say this
[54:00] morning, thank you, Lord, because we can
[54:03] testify that what he has promised, he is
[54:06] able to perform. Amen. We're not here
[54:09] blindly following something. When you
[54:11] blindly follow something, you're in a
[54:14] cult. Amen. When you just blindly
[54:17] follow. But you see, God didn't say,
[54:19] "Close your eyes and just blindly follow
[54:21] me." He said what you do and these are
[54:24] the words of the prophet you pray for
[54:26] revelation and God will give that to
[54:28] you. So God while we have to have faith
[54:31] to follow and we don't want to follow
[54:33] according to intellect or emotion or
[54:36] circumstance at the same time God's
[54:39] laying seed down in our hearts and
[54:41] souls. He's laying it in there. That's
[54:43] giving us direction and giving us
[54:44] guidance that we can walk with a
[54:47] confidence, my brother and sister. Not
[54:48] blindly following, but walking with a
[54:51] confidence that the word says it. And I
[54:53] believe it. And that's what touched me
[54:54] out of the special today. Amen. It's
[54:57] always back to the word. Back to the
[54:58] word. Back to the word. Take us back to
[55:00] the word, Lord. Amen. Now, I just want
[55:03] to go ahead and go into Romans 8:33
[55:06] through39 to lay a little bit more
[55:08] foundation here. Who shall lay anything
[55:11] to the charge of God's elect? Now, you
[55:15] could probably preach on this for a year
[55:17] or two or three, my brother and sister,
[55:19] but this is not for us to use as as our
[55:22] our scapegoat or excuse. Uh but this is
[55:26] the fact that God looks at you and I and
[55:29] says, "I covered them with my blood, so
[55:32] this sin will not stick." It it will
[55:35] not. You know, a brother, I liked how he
[55:37] said it. have taken the full context,
[55:39] but he says, you know, we as believers
[55:41] are like
[55:43] teflon. I thought that was kind of
[55:45] funny. Okay, it's not going to stick.
[55:46] Sin is not going to stick to you. Amen.
[55:50] So, it won't be held to your elect, to
[55:53] the elect. Amen. To your account. It is
[55:55] God that justifith. Who is he that
[55:57] condemnth? It is Christ that died, yay,
[56:00] rather, that is risen again, who is even
[56:03] at the right hand of God, who also
[56:05] maketh intercession for us. And the
[56:07] prophet told us, not only is he our
[56:10] advocate, our lawyer, he is the
[56:12] prosecutor. And when the lawyer and the
[56:15] prosecutor are the same one, they always
[56:17] manage to work it out because brother
[56:20] Brandham lays this so clearly, so
[56:22] beautifully, it wasn't our fault. We
[56:25] were trapped into it. Amen. So God looks
[56:28] at this in a different fashion. Amen. So
[56:31] who also maketh intercession for us? Who
[56:33] shall separate us from the love of
[56:35] Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or
[56:39] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[56:42] peril or sword. As it is written, for
[56:45] thy sake we are killed all the day long.
[56:47] We are counted as sheep for the
[56:49] slaughter. Nay, in all these things we
[56:53] are more than conquerors through him
[56:55] that loved us. Amen. I'll never I don't
[56:59] many other people might feel like that,
[57:01] but my brother and sister, I never get
[57:04] tired of hearing that I am a conqueror,
[57:06] that I'm more than a conqueror. A
[57:08] reminder that whatever happens in this
[57:11] world, God's already raised us up above
[57:13] that and made us the conqueror of that.
[57:16] Amen. Because the word says that we're
[57:18] going to put this under our feet. Now,
[57:20] it's not us in our ability, but it's the
[57:22] word in us. Amen. In other words, the
[57:25] only way that you lift a foot
[57:27] spiritually today is Christ lifting your
[57:30] foot. Amen. But we are going to be there
[57:33] and we're going to rise above it. In
[57:35] fact, we're going to walk on the ashes
[57:37] of it and it will be Christ. When we get
[57:39] to the other side, my brother and
[57:41] sister, there will be no one there
[57:43] saying, "I did this and I did that." But
[57:46] we're going to be looking to the throne
[57:47] and we're going to be saying, "It was my
[57:49] Lord Jesus. It was him. He come and he
[57:52] raised me up out of the ashes. He raised
[57:54] me up out of the miry clay of the pit.
[57:56] He's raised me up into heavenly places.
[57:59] And I'm here today because of his
[58:01] wonderful, incredible grace." Amen.
[58:04] Hallelujah. I thank you, Lord. Nor he,
[58:06] nor depth, nor any other creature shall
[58:08] be able to separate us from the love of
[58:11] God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[58:15] Amen. Verse 38 once again to emphasize
[58:17] on that. For I am persuaded. Can we say
[58:21] that this morning? For I am persuaded.
[58:24] Amen. My brother and sister, it doesn't
[58:26] matter if the next person down the pew
[58:28] uh is persuaded or not. You have to be
[58:31] persuaded. You have to stand here today
[58:34] without one question mark or whether or
[58:36] not you're a son or daughter of God. You
[58:38] have to stand here today without one
[58:40] question mark that the blood of Jesus
[58:42] Christ covered your sin. one question
[58:44] mark whether this Bible in its entirety
[58:47] is true or not without one question mark
[58:50] that God wanted you to hear the word and
[58:52] made you able to hear the word. We need
[58:55] to be fully persuaded that there is
[58:57] nothing that can separate us and there
[59:00] is nothing my brother and sister you
[59:02] know I I think about it this way you
[59:04] know the prophet of God told us uh that
[59:06] uh you know uh when uh when the bird
[59:09] flies over you know and certain thoughts
[59:11] come in your mind and certain struggles
[59:13] that you have I don't know if you have
[59:15] mind battles but in in that realm of
[59:18] mind battles I know I kind of said that
[59:20] understated but anyway my brother and
[59:22] sister when when you have a kind battle.
[59:25] The prophet of God said, "It's one thing
[59:27] that the bird flies over, but just don't
[59:29] let him stop and build a nest." But I
[59:31] tell you, even if he has stopped and
[59:33] built a nest, you can this morning reach
[59:36] up and knock that nest out and say, "I
[59:39] am free from your uh influence, Satan,
[59:42] from the mind battle that you put upon
[59:44] me, or whether I have the Holy Ghost or
[59:46] not, or whether I'm really sealed or
[59:48] saved, or whatever it might be, and all
[59:51] of that, my brother and sister. So, you
[59:52] have a nest and it's been built this
[59:54] morning, but all we have to do is stop
[59:56] and say, "Lord, I'm ready to be free
[59:58] from that and take that nest and knock
[1:00:01] it away and dispose of it." Amen.
[1:00:03] Because God never intended for us to
[1:00:05] carry that all the days of our life,
[1:00:07] struggling over something from the past
[1:00:10] or something that that you don't
[1:00:12] understand and it bothers you. Amen.
[1:00:14] Sometimes it might be something that
[1:00:16] come down through your family. I
[1:00:18] remember one time we were uh back east
[1:00:20] and and we were preaching and and I I
[1:00:23] just preached a very convoluted or I
[1:00:25] thought so uh service and and uh when it
[1:00:28] was all over I told sister Jerry I said
[1:00:30] man I I just think I mangled that this
[1:00:33] morning. I just couldn't seem to stay on
[1:00:35] thought and kind of wandered here and
[1:00:37] kind of wandered there. But in the
[1:00:39] evening service, amen, another brother
[1:00:41] was ministering. And in the evening
[1:00:43] service, a brother uh what we would say
[1:00:46] broke church order. And the song
[1:00:48] leader's leading songs. And a brother
[1:00:50] stands up and says, "Brother, can I say
[1:00:52] a word?" And the brother said, "Yes,
[1:00:54] brother." And he goes to share something
[1:00:57] that was relevant in his life. He was
[1:00:59] there, a deacon in the church, and he's
[1:01:01] encouraging the people in the church,
[1:01:03] telling them, "Just trust God. Trust
[1:01:05] God." And he says in the morning
[1:01:08] service, one of those things that
[1:01:09] brother Paul could not figure out why he
[1:01:11] wandered over is God was dealing with
[1:01:14] me. And he said, "I have high blood
[1:01:16] pressure, so high I should be having a
[1:01:18] stroke even right now. And I'm on every
[1:01:21] bit of medicine the doctors can give me.
[1:01:23] My daddy died of a stroke. My mother is
[1:01:25] crippled because of a stroke. And I'm
[1:01:27] terrified as a stroke. And I'm standing
[1:01:29] here telling you, trust God. And I'm
[1:01:32] struggling to trust God." My brother and
[1:01:34] sister. You see, God cares. It wasn't
[1:01:37] about the man behind the pulpit. It was
[1:01:39] God saying, "It's time for my children
[1:01:41] to be free, to get rid of that that nest
[1:01:44] that Satan has built and let them be
[1:01:47] free." And that opened a chain of
[1:01:49] events. I've never seen a service like
[1:01:51] this before. And before he was finished,
[1:01:53] another individual stood up and was
[1:01:55] waiting and said, "Can I speak?" And
[1:01:57] when he was finished, another individual
[1:01:59] stood up and said, "Can I speak?" And it
[1:02:01] went on like this, individual after
[1:02:03] individual. And my brother and sister,
[1:02:05] you look at this, you see there comes a
[1:02:07] season that God wants you and I to come
[1:02:10] to the place that we're persuaded that
[1:02:13] we're not supposed to be under Satan's
[1:02:15] influence. We're not supposed to be
[1:02:17] under his control. We're not here as his
[1:02:21] little puppets and that. But we're
[1:02:23] convinced, amen, persuaded fully that we
[1:02:26] are sons and daughters of God and that
[1:02:29] the word was given for us. Amen. Not a
[1:02:32] hope for this. And maybe if I was
[1:02:34] spiritual like them. But we sit here
[1:02:36] today even the least in the kingdom. God
[1:02:39] has given us the authority to be an
[1:02:41] overcomer today. And so the limitation
[1:02:45] is oursel.
[1:02:47] Lord help us.
[1:02:51] Amen. To be fully persuaded.
[1:02:54] Amen. I have fond memories of that
[1:02:57] service. The brother that was supposed
[1:02:59] to be preaching the evening service had
[1:03:02] a topic. He'd even bounced it off of me
[1:03:04] and said, "What did you think?" And I
[1:03:05] was like, "That's pretty heavy." But he
[1:03:07] got up and he started preaching. And
[1:03:08] after all this had happened, he just
[1:03:11] stands in front of the people and says,
[1:03:13] "Praise God, the Lord has just spoken to
[1:03:16] me. We're going to have a deliverance
[1:03:18] service tonight." And we did. Amen. It
[1:03:22] was incredible.
[1:03:23] Incredible things that probably man
[1:03:26] would not ever just willfully speak out.
[1:03:30] And God started dealing with them and
[1:03:32] speaking and giving deliverance to that.
[1:03:35] Amen. My brother and sister, you see,
[1:03:37] God is here to set us free. Praise the
[1:03:40] Lord. Not momentarily.
[1:03:43] Not just the easy things in our life,
[1:03:45] but to set us completely free. Amen. We
[1:03:50] have a promise of the word in this hour.
[1:03:52] Do we not have a promise today? Amen. Uh
[1:03:55] the prophet said, you know, this is uh
[1:03:57] points us back into the word. Amen. not
[1:03:59] his ideas but is there he's preaching
[1:04:02] the word. Now I just do want to say this
[1:04:05] my brother and sister he preached the
[1:04:06] word but did he have to preach it every
[1:04:08] word
[1:04:09] verbatim? Now brother Brandham says I
[1:04:12] preach what Paul preached but he didn't
[1:04:16] puppet Paul he preached the word. So we
[1:04:20] have to realize my brother and sister to
[1:04:22] preach what Paul preached doesn't mean
[1:04:24] we puppet Paul. To preach what the
[1:04:26] prophet preached doesn't mean we have to
[1:04:29] puppet the prophet. Amen. So God comes.
[1:04:32] So the promise of this word is to
[1:04:34] restore all things. Now my brother and
[1:04:36] sister I remember a man he he was
[1:04:38] actually being very critical of the
[1:04:40] message. Uh almost like you know what I
[1:04:42] had the Holy Ghost before I ever came to
[1:04:44] the message. I had understanding of
[1:04:46] Godhead before I ever came to the
[1:04:48] message. Now the thing that said
[1:04:50] everything he said I would have to say I
[1:04:52] believe that's true. But what he didn't
[1:04:54] have was the correct attitude or
[1:04:57] atmosphere around him. It was almost as
[1:04:59] like I didn't need this. I already had
[1:05:01] it all. Well, my brother and sister, if
[1:05:03] there was one that had it all, he would
[1:05:05] be raptured already. Amen. He would be
[1:05:07] taken out already. God would have uh
[1:05:10] promoted. You see, every one of us
[1:05:12] needed a restoration of some kind or
[1:05:14] another. Now, this man, it might be just
[1:05:16] he needed a restoration of his attitude,
[1:05:19] his spirit, the atmosphere around him
[1:05:21] needed to be turned back. So he knew the
[1:05:23] word but he didn't really have the
[1:05:25] atmosphere of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:05:28] Amen. He didn't have that that and so
[1:05:30] you know there's things so the word in
[1:05:32] this hour was to restore all things. And
[1:05:34] there are some people that are pushing
[1:05:36] it off. Those who believe the prophet
[1:05:38] has to come back and I'm sorry if I
[1:05:40] speak a little blunt this morning but we
[1:05:42] really need to. Amen. Those who believe
[1:05:44] the prophet has to come back to restore
[1:05:47] that. my brother and sister uh they've
[1:05:49] really missed the essence of what
[1:05:50] brother Brham uh taught us because he
[1:05:52] showed us that the word was doing the
[1:05:55] restoration. Amen. And so as a prophet
[1:05:58] opened the book for you and I and he
[1:06:00] gave us a very clear vision of the book.
[1:06:03] Is the book open? Amen. As he gave us a
[1:06:05] very clear vision of the book, there is
[1:06:08] that action that is required on our
[1:06:10] part. In other words, we're not going to
[1:06:12] sit on our hands and wait for the
[1:06:14] prophet to come back. Now, my brother
[1:06:16] and sister, it's kind of like the old
[1:06:17] argument of the man who was not a
[1:06:19] believer. And he asked the believer, he
[1:06:21] said, 'Well, you know, um, you say you
[1:06:24] believe and you're going to die anyhow.
[1:06:27] I don't believe, I'm going to die
[1:06:29] anyhow. And he says, so what's the
[1:06:32] difference? And the Christian says to
[1:06:35] him, well, sir, when you who don't
[1:06:38] believe, when you die, it's over. It's
[1:06:41] finished. When I die, it's just
[1:06:44] starting. Amen. Amen. So there's a
[1:06:47] difference of the approach, right? That
[1:06:48] man didn't feel like he needed anything.
[1:06:51] And this man, the believer says, you
[1:06:54] know what? When I die, it is just the
[1:06:58] beginning. This this is just the
[1:07:00] preliminary to what it's really all
[1:07:03] about. It's not about this life here,
[1:07:05] this flesh here, the joy and the riches
[1:07:08] and this and that of this life. My
[1:07:10] brother and sister, this is just the
[1:07:12] preliminary. Amen. So as the word is
[1:07:14] restoring all things. Now we look at
[1:07:17] this and sometimes you know I want to
[1:07:19] say this correctly. So it says it would
[1:07:23] reveal the mystery of Jesus Christ.
[1:07:25] Right? Not mysteries.
[1:07:29] But yet this is the this is the part
[1:07:32] within the mystery is many components.
[1:07:36] So people get confused when they say,
[1:07:38] "Well, the the Godhead was a mystery and
[1:07:41] baptism was a mystery." But my brother
[1:07:43] and sister, when you have the mystery of
[1:07:45] Jesus Christ, when you have the
[1:07:47] revelation of Jesus Christ, all the rest
[1:07:50] of this falls into its correct position.
[1:07:54] Means see you can't have the full
[1:07:55] revelation of Jesus Christ without
[1:07:58] baptism,
[1:08:00] without understanding of Godhead,
[1:08:02] without understanding the deity of
[1:08:04] Christ. Amen. As you look at this, you
[1:08:07] know, people would say, "Well, we we
[1:08:08] understand God placed us here to live
[1:08:10] the word and and I'm so glad I chose,
[1:08:13] but we didn't choose. The word says that
[1:08:15] he chose for us. We did not choose. No
[1:08:18] man himself has ever willed himself to
[1:08:21] serve God." So, if there's a desire
[1:08:24] there, remember brother Brandham talks
[1:08:25] about that. He uses that example of the
[1:08:28] little boy eating the pedal on the
[1:08:30] bicycle. You see the only reason that
[1:08:32] boy would eat the pedal on the bicycle
[1:08:35] as his body was crying out for what was
[1:08:38] in the pedal which happened to be sulfur
[1:08:41] and it was there it was crying out for
[1:08:43] that and we're here today my brother and
[1:08:45] sister because God has come and he has
[1:08:49] placed such a hunger. I don't care what
[1:08:52] Satan's tripping you over what he's
[1:08:54] throwing in your face of what he's
[1:08:56] causing you to doubt. If there's a
[1:08:58] hunger for God, there is a hunger to
[1:09:00] satisfy that. Quit looking at your
[1:09:03] details and let your soul be satisfied.
[1:09:07] Amen. You come to the place, my brother
[1:09:09] and sister, I don't think any doctor
[1:09:11] would have ever come to that child and
[1:09:13] said, you know, mother, I think that uh
[1:09:15] to diagnose your child's need here, I'm
[1:09:18] going to take the pedal off of my
[1:09:20] child's bicycle and give a prescription
[1:09:22] for bicycle pedals to your child.
[1:09:26] No, it don't work that way, my brother
[1:09:27] and sister. No one had an understanding,
[1:09:29] but there was something about that. I'll
[1:09:32] just tell you, maybe you guys are
[1:09:33] different, but I've never in my whole
[1:09:35] childhood and all the crazy things that
[1:09:37] we did in our childhood, I never once
[1:09:40] ever took a bite out of a bicycle
[1:09:43] pedal. No, because there was nothing in
[1:09:47] the bicycle pedal to satisfy me. It
[1:09:50] wasn't calling for that. And today we're
[1:09:52] here. No matter where you are, whether
[1:09:55] you are fully persuaded today, whether
[1:09:57] you struggle with some thoughts and some
[1:09:59] things in your life, my brother and
[1:10:00] sister, the very fact that you are
[1:10:03] crying out for more of God says there's
[1:10:05] more of God for you. Why don't you get
[1:10:08] down and get serious about getting more
[1:10:11] of God? Amen. Hallelujah. How you want
[1:10:13] to set that in order, I'm not here to
[1:10:15] tell you, but you can cry out. Reminds
[1:10:18] me of a man. Amen. in the message was
[1:10:20] just kind of a wild crazy guy. And one
[1:10:23] day he just in the struggle of his life,
[1:10:26] he was on drugs a little bit. Not
[1:10:28] serious, you know, I mean kind of
[1:10:29] degrees of sin. Amen. So not, you know,
[1:10:32] not serious
[1:10:35] drugs. And he goes out in the
[1:10:39] woods and he yells at God. That's how he
[1:10:41] puts it. I yelled at God. I didn't talk
[1:10:43] to God. I yelled at God. If you're real,
[1:10:46] prove it. He said, "Don't do that
[1:10:51] cuz God will prove it."
[1:10:53] And he said, "I went through everything
[1:10:55] you can imagine." And while it was going
[1:10:58] on, I said, "I can't even complain cuz I
[1:11:01] told God, prove
[1:11:04] it." There's another way to say, "Lord,
[1:11:07] if your word is true," did any of you
[1:11:08] have opportunity to watch the little
[1:11:10] video about the little girl that
[1:11:12] drowned? Amen. Go. It's posted to to
[1:11:17] Grace Tabernacle on on WhatsApp. Amen.
[1:11:22] This is a man who had heard from a
[1:11:24] brother, a witness. God sent a prophet.
[1:11:27] The word is true. The word is true. And
[1:11:29] he took it that and he accepted. He
[1:11:31] received some of that, but he couldn't
[1:11:33] receive. He was not fully persuaded. And
[1:11:36] when his little girl is drowned in the
[1:11:38] swimming pool and he's there in the
[1:11:41] doctor's office and they say, "There's
[1:11:43] nothing we can do for your child." He
[1:11:46] cries out, "My brother and sister, if
[1:11:48] the God of William Brandham is
[1:11:51] real, touch my child." Amen. And God
[1:11:55] raises that child up.
[1:11:58] You see, God will accept our challenge,
[1:12:00] my brother and sister. Don't be timid.
[1:12:02] It says, "Come boldly before the throne
[1:12:04] of God." But you've got to be persuaded
[1:12:07] that when God answers, you will follow
[1:12:11] through with your part. Amen. and you
[1:12:14] say, "Lord, if you do this, I'll serve
[1:12:16] you faithfully all the days." You got to
[1:12:18] be persuaded that when God comes on the
[1:12:21] scene, you'll do it. Because otherwise,
[1:12:23] God will look down and see that little
[1:12:26] seed in your heart that you're not
[1:12:28] sincere. And you say, "But God didn't
[1:12:30] answer my prayer." Well, you weren't
[1:12:32] serious or sincere about it, so God had
[1:12:34] no obligation. Oh, you say, "Is that the
[1:12:37] way God works?" Yes, my brother and
[1:12:38] sister. You want to make the rapture,
[1:12:40] you're going to be all of the word.
[1:12:42] You're not going to be the part that
[1:12:43] makes you comfortable, makes you happy.
[1:12:45] You've got to be fully persuaded that
[1:12:47] this word is completely what you need.
[1:12:50] Amen. Hallelujah. So, we look at this
[1:12:52] this mystery, these components, the
[1:12:55] Godhead. My brother and sister,
[1:12:57] depending on what church or background
[1:13:00] you come from, many of you here maybe
[1:13:02] never knew any different, just raised up
[1:13:04] uh you know, in this. But when you
[1:13:07] recognize that that how deceptive the
[1:13:09] godhead is uh that they come and they do
[1:13:13] everything in the name of and it's there
[1:13:15] my brother and sister it sounds right it
[1:13:18] seems right but when you become
[1:13:20] persuaded that every one of those names
[1:13:23] now if you study a a lot or a little
[1:13:26] even on this you'll realize they have
[1:13:28] presented it in such a fashion that if
[1:13:31] you are looking at it in any other
[1:13:33] fashion than three parts
[1:13:36] hearts. Three, and they almost have it
[1:13:39] right,
[1:13:42] manifestations. But if you don't believe
[1:13:44] the trinity, you're a
[1:13:46] heretic. And what's that? It a bird
[1:13:48] trying to build a nest.
[1:13:50] Trying to tell you that if you don't
[1:13:52] believe it like this, you're wrong. But
[1:13:55] the truth of it is, Satan's so
[1:13:56] persuasive, he comes and he fashions
[1:13:59] this in such a way. And my brother and
[1:14:01] sister, it's like one guy, you know, his
[1:14:03] argument was, "Everybody believes in the
[1:14:06] Trinity." And the man he was talking to
[1:14:08] says, "No, that's a false statement."
[1:14:11] The guy says, "How dare you make us say
[1:14:13] I made a false statement?" Not everyone.
[1:14:16] That's right. Amen. In your mind,
[1:14:18] everyone believes. But you see, God
[1:14:22] brought it down. So what is a mystery of
[1:14:26] baptism? Amen. these components. God
[1:14:28] started putting these in place. Amen.
[1:14:31] And so you look at that the deity of
[1:14:33] Christ and remember brother Brandham
[1:14:34] gives the example the little woman says
[1:14:36] you make too much of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:40] He was just a
[1:14:42] man. Brother Brandham I don't need to
[1:14:45] explain the whole story. Brother
[1:14:47] Brandham then says you know what yes but
[1:14:49] you've missed the fact that he was God
[1:14:52] and man. Anybody here today that is God
[1:14:55] and man? Hallelujah. Every one of us
[1:14:58] sitting here needs to have the
[1:15:00] revelation that we are God and man.
[1:15:03] Amen. Because it is Christ on the
[1:15:06] inside. Christ in you, the hope of
[1:15:08] glory. If he's in you, Amen. You're not
[1:15:11] your own. Amen. You know, a a host is
[1:15:16] what what contains or supports something
[1:15:19] else. and and all this flesh is doing,
[1:15:22] as it were, if I'm using the right
[1:15:24] words, hosting a tabernacle for our Lord
[1:15:27] Jesus Christ. That's all it is. Cuz my
[1:15:29] brother and sister, you go to the
[1:15:31] graveyard, you go dig up a casket that's
[1:15:34] 20, 30, 40 years old, and you're not
[1:15:37] going to find a person inside there.
[1:15:39] Amen. And yet, when you think about
[1:15:42] Beyond the Curtain of Time, the prophet
[1:15:43] of God meets that beautiful young woman,
[1:15:45] and she's saying, "Oh, my precious
[1:15:48] brother." And brother Brandham's like, I
[1:15:50] I I don't know. I don't think I've ever
[1:15:52] met her. You led her to the Lord in her
[1:15:55] in her 90s, right? See, that body that
[1:15:58] was hosting all of the natural things of
[1:16:01] life, all the cares of life all the way
[1:16:03] up into the 90s, my brother and sister,
[1:16:06] the end of life, the horizon is right
[1:16:08] there. And God says, "But that's my
[1:16:10] seed." Amen. I let it go for as long as
[1:16:13] I let it go, but that's my seed. And in
[1:16:16] her 90s, she receives the word and is
[1:16:19] saved. And she's standing there beyond
[1:16:21] the curtain of time. And no wonder, I
[1:16:23] say all of us would say, but no wonder
[1:16:26] she's there. Oh my precious brother. I
[1:16:29] come as it would be. Maybe this is just
[1:16:31] human thinking. I come so close to the
[1:16:34] end of my life without knowing the Lord
[1:16:36] Jesus Christ. I'm so glad God sent you
[1:16:39] into my life. But you see, God had a
[1:16:42] divine appointment that he scheduled the
[1:16:44] whole time from the day she was born and
[1:16:47] cradled in her mother's arms.
[1:16:50] God had an appointment with her. Amen.
[1:16:53] Amen. You might say, "But maybe she had
[1:16:55] opportunity as a as a teenager to to
[1:16:58] receive the Lord. Maybe she had
[1:17:00] opportunity here. Maybe she had
[1:17:02] opportunity there." My brother and
[1:17:04] sister, I won't go in and debate all of
[1:17:06] that with you, but I'll tell you, she
[1:17:08] had a divine appointment. And God kept
[1:17:10] that appointment and saved her soul
[1:17:13] there in her 90s. Amen. And at that
[1:17:17] point, she was persuaded enough by what
[1:17:19] she heard. You know, imagine what you
[1:17:21] can hear in 90 years.
[1:17:24] God's not
[1:17:25] real. God's
[1:17:27] supernatural. We don't need a God.
[1:17:30] Completely dependent on God. It all
[1:17:33] depends on whose voice is persuading
[1:17:36] you.
[1:17:46] Predestination so simple yet so
[1:17:49] complicated. In doing a little bit of
[1:17:51] studying, you listen to a preacher
[1:17:54] explaining on the internet why
[1:17:58] predestination is
[1:18:00] false. And I'm
[1:18:02] like, what did I hear in the background?
[1:18:05] He just ripped a page, two pages, three,
[1:18:09] four, five pages out of his Bible.
[1:18:14] Yeah.
[1:18:15] He's just there.
[1:18:20] That's not how God works. We're free
[1:18:23] moral agents. Well, I'll tell you what.
[1:18:27] If there's sulfur in the
[1:18:28] pedal, the child will find the pedal.
[1:18:34] If the seed is in the individual,
[1:18:38] they will find the light that brings
[1:18:40] life to the seed.
[1:18:44] Oh, my brother and sister, what about
[1:18:45] free moral agency? That's right. I made
[1:18:47] some stupid decisions and God never
[1:18:49] stopped me. That's right. Is it okay to
[1:18:52] put it that strongly? I told God once,
[1:18:55] I'm not to emphasize, I don't want to
[1:18:56] get sidetracked here, but much to the
[1:18:58] detriment of my own family, I told God,
[1:19:01] "No way." One time in my life, that was
[1:19:05] free moral agency.
[1:19:07] I told him, "Absolutely, I will not. I
[1:19:10] cannot. I shall not." And God says,
[1:19:14] "Okay, maybe when I've ground you into
[1:19:16] dust, you'll look at it differently."
[1:19:19] And God started grinding. Amen. And I
[1:19:23] looked at it differently. Amen. You see,
[1:19:26] God's will be done. Amen. You can say no
[1:19:30] all you want to say. In the end, God's
[1:19:31] will will be done. Hallelujah. And the
[1:19:35] evidence of the Holy Ghost. I'm just
[1:19:37] touching on a few of these here. Brother
[1:19:39] David touched on Wednesday night there.
[1:19:41] Touched, I guess, to the e edge of those
[1:19:43] things. Uh we're looking at this, my
[1:19:45] brother and sister. Evidence of a Holy
[1:19:46] Ghost. My I just watched a little video
[1:19:49] clip the other day. took place down in
[1:19:51] Florida and um they're there and the
[1:19:53] preacher has
[1:19:55] dreadlocks just I don't know I I
[1:19:58] wouldn't expect it to find a man who
[1:20:00] looked like that tattooed up and
[1:20:02] dreadlocks behind the pulpit but that's
[1:20:04] where he was at and he makes a
[1:20:06] declaration that the Holy Spirit has
[1:20:09] fallen on you and all of a sudden this
[1:20:12] person starts crowing like a chicken and
[1:20:13] falling on the floor and barking like a
[1:20:15] dog and he's like say see the Holy
[1:20:18] Spirit's moving on
[1:20:20] him. I can't find one strategy of
[1:20:22] evidence in the Bible to support that
[1:20:26] behavior. But remember, the word said
[1:20:28] there'd be a strong delusion come upon
[1:20:30] the people. And so, as they're there, my
[1:20:33] brother and sister, this was this might
[1:20:35] shock you, but uh as they're there, he
[1:20:37] once again declares, "The Holy Spirit
[1:20:39] has fallen on you." And this young woman
[1:20:42] is there. She falls to the floor, starts
[1:20:44] riffing like a snake and hissing. And
[1:20:47] he's like, "Yes, look how the Holy
[1:20:48] Spirit is moving on her."
[1:20:52] My brother and sister, it looked more
[1:20:53] like demonology.
[1:20:55] But you see the world we live in.
[1:20:58] People, look, I'm talking about a
[1:21:00] coliseum full of people. Not not a
[1:21:02] little group with just a little handful
[1:21:04] of people that just are, you know, from
[1:21:06] the fringes. This place is packed out
[1:21:08] full of people. And and they're
[1:21:10] declaring this. And God comes down and
[1:21:13] sends a prophet who comes and says, "No,
[1:21:15] here's what the evidence of the Holy
[1:21:18] Spirit looks like." Amen. And we
[1:21:20] stopped. And many people remember the
[1:21:22] man who had went here and he went there
[1:21:25] and he went there and there and there
[1:21:27] and there looking for confirmation. What
[1:21:30] is the Holy Spirit? And do I have it?
[1:21:33] And then he comes to brother Brandham
[1:21:34] one day. Are we okay here? Amen. He
[1:21:37] comes to brother Brandham one day and he
[1:21:39] asks him the same question he's asked
[1:21:41] over and over and over again of
[1:21:42] preachers and brother Brandham says now
[1:21:45] you you picked up a pamphlet. You picked
[1:21:48] up a little something and you read that
[1:21:49] and something happened in your heart and
[1:21:52] you said I've got to serve God. Brother
[1:21:54] Brandham says that's when you receive
[1:21:56] the Holy Ghost. Look, it's not about all
[1:21:59] this other nonsense out here. But it's
[1:22:02] when God comes down. Amen. He's not
[1:22:04] going to make us crow like chickens and
[1:22:06] bark like dogs and slither like snakes.
[1:22:09] He's coming down and what's he doing?
[1:22:11] He's changing a heart. And that man, my
[1:22:13] brother and sister, the prophet of God,
[1:22:16] so words it in such a way that that man
[1:22:19] receives what he had already received.
[1:22:23] Did that make sense? Because you can
[1:22:25] hear the word preached. You can hear it
[1:22:27] preached in authority and anointed. And
[1:22:29] if you are still questioning, well, that
[1:22:31] worked for brother so and so or for
[1:22:33] sister so and so. They've got the Holy
[1:22:35] Ghost. They're a real Christian, but
[1:22:37] myself, it's time for us to stop and
[1:22:40] receive what we've already received.
[1:22:42] Amen. When God said, "I've poured my
[1:22:44] word into you and you believe my word
[1:22:46] and you acted on my word and your life
[1:22:48] changed." There's an evidence. Amen.
[1:22:51] It's not how we shouted, what we sang,
[1:22:54] what we prophesied.
[1:22:56] My brother and sister, there's so many
[1:22:57] people today that are caught up in these
[1:23:00] other things. Can someone say thank you
[1:23:02] Lord that we come down in the simplicity
[1:23:05] as the prophet of God said, God will
[1:23:07] make it simple. And it is simple enough
[1:23:10] that we receive the very life of Jesus
[1:23:13] Christ. Amen. That very word coming down
[1:23:16] in our life has changed us and moved us
[1:23:19] into a position where we could say, you
[1:23:21] know what, God said it. I just believe
[1:23:23] it. That's the word. I want the word. I
[1:23:27] receive the word. Hallelujah. And I I
[1:23:31] I'll move on. But there's many many
[1:23:33] things that have been set in order and
[1:23:35] and it come down just a a putting in
[1:23:38] place. Amen. Not new
[1:23:41] mysteries, wasn't baptism, evidence,
[1:23:44] Holy Spirit. All of this has been right
[1:23:46] out in the open, but never aligned.
[1:23:50] Yeah. Now John the 8th chapter 32nd
[1:23:53] verse. And you shall know the truth and
[1:23:55] the truth shall make you free. See when
[1:23:59] you look at
[1:24:00] this you have to have a relationship
[1:24:03] with truth. Amen. It's not just I heard
[1:24:06] truth. Many person heard truth. Amen.
[1:24:10] And walked away from it. But to have a
[1:24:13] relationship with truth. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:17] Who's the truth? The truth is not just
[1:24:20] words, it's a person. Amen. So when you
[1:24:24] have that relationship with truth, see,
[1:24:26] not just
[1:24:27] knowledge, then many a man read his
[1:24:30] Bible cover to cover. I met a man here a
[1:24:33] while back. He told me, "I'm on my fifth
[1:24:35] time of reading the Bible cover to
[1:24:38] cover." I won't go into it because it's
[1:24:41] a little
[1:24:43] bit odd.
[1:24:46] I'll just put it this way so you catch
[1:24:49] the
[1:24:50] gist. His
[1:24:52] language didn't reflect the language of
[1:24:55] a man who's read his Bible five times.
[1:24:59] So you can read the Bible five times and
[1:25:02] it not change your life.
[1:25:06] So here again, is it all right to share
[1:25:09] an opinion this morning? Amen. It's not
[1:25:11] worth a lot. It'll take a whole semi
[1:25:13] load of opinions be worth a
[1:25:15] penny. But my brother and sister, it's
[1:25:18] not about how many times you read it,
[1:25:21] how fast you read it. I read it in a
[1:25:23] year. I had to read four chapters every
[1:25:26] single day for the whole year to to read
[1:25:28] this in time. Did you get anything from
[1:25:31] it? I'd rather read one book in a whole
[1:25:34] year and receive every bit that comes
[1:25:38] out of the book and come into me or to
[1:25:41] you and it be a lifechanging event.
[1:25:44] Amen. Because I'm telling you, my
[1:25:46] brother and sister, when you are there
[1:25:48] looking at genealogy in the Old
[1:25:50] Testament, Amen. Now, it's all relevant.
[1:25:52] Don't misunderstand me. But that's not
[1:25:54] going to save you. Amen. To understand
[1:25:57] the generations not going to save you.
[1:26:00] Amen. So you can read all you want about
[1:26:02] the generations and it won't change a
[1:26:04] habit that you have. It won't change a
[1:26:06] temper. It won't change you know
[1:26:08] whatever it might be. And you see it's
[1:26:10] the relationship you have with the word
[1:26:13] is what changes you relationship with
[1:26:15] the truth. Now if the truth sets one
[1:26:18] free one must be fully persuaded.
[1:26:21] In other words I just want to use simple
[1:26:24] examples. If the word says don't lie,
[1:26:27] you have to be fully persuaded that you
[1:26:29] are not going to lie. If the word says
[1:26:32] that you're not going to kill, you have
[1:26:34] to be fully persuaded that you're not
[1:26:36] going to kill. And it gets down to those
[1:26:38] things that are a little closer to home.
[1:26:40] Amen. The lust of the flesh and pride of
[1:26:43] life and all of these things like that
[1:26:45] that we make excuses for. Well, I I make
[1:26:49] a joke out of this, but I don't mean to
[1:26:51] make a joke out of this. Well, I have a
[1:26:53] temper because we're Germans. Well, the
[1:26:55] Lord will come along and prove to you
[1:26:57] you're not a German so that you don't
[1:26:59] have that excuse any longer. Amen. So
[1:27:02] then we realize, look, I don't need an
[1:27:05] excuse. I need to just be persuaded that
[1:27:07] the word is true. And when I get
[1:27:10] persuaded that the word is true is when
[1:27:12] I really will apply it.
[1:27:16] When I really will hold on to it is when
[1:27:18] I'm persuaded that it is there. Now my
[1:27:21] brother and sister, the old phrase, I
[1:27:23] think it's Dale Carnegie said this uh a
[1:27:26] man convinced against his will is of the
[1:27:29] same mind or opinion still.
[1:27:33] So you look at this, my brother and
[1:27:35] sister, you see, we can come and prove
[1:27:38] to you the scripture, prove to you God
[1:27:41] sent a prophet, prove to you these
[1:27:43] things, but if you are not persuaded, it
[1:27:46] will have almost zero effect in your
[1:27:49] life. Amen. So, what we got to do is not
[1:27:52] fight over the word. What we got to do
[1:27:54] is ask the Lord, Lord, let me see it so
[1:27:57] that I can be persuaded that your word
[1:27:59] is true and this is what you want me to
[1:28:02] do. My brother and sister, God's not in
[1:28:04] the game of fooling people. Amen. God
[1:28:07] doesn't come and say, you know what, I
[1:28:08] I'm going to just fool these people.
[1:28:11] Now, he did say in his word that he
[1:28:13] would let a strong delusion come upon
[1:28:16] the
[1:28:18] people. But the strong
[1:28:20] delusion, this might sound tricky to
[1:28:22] you, didn't come out of the word.
[1:28:26] But the delusion will use the word.
[1:28:30] Oh yeah. To delude. Amen. But that
[1:28:33] spirit
[1:28:34] that was from Satan.
[1:28:37] Amen.
[1:28:39] Now look at this. Brother Brown preached
[1:28:41] about three kinds of believers. Y'all
[1:28:43] remember it well. Amen. The unbeliever,
[1:28:46] the makebeliever, and the real believer.
[1:28:49] See, uh we're not going against what the
[1:28:51] prophet of God said here. So don't don't
[1:28:53] don't misunderstand what I'm fixing to
[1:28:56] say. But when we break this down,
[1:28:58] there's really only two positions.
[1:29:03] Persuaded
[1:29:05] or not.
[1:29:07] There's two positions. If you're
[1:29:09] persuaded, you're a believer. If you're
[1:29:12] not persuaded, you are a makebeliever
[1:29:16] and an unbeliever. Now, when you look at
[1:29:18] this, I I don't know if I honestly I
[1:29:21] can't remember at the moment whether I
[1:29:22] included the quote or not, but you see
[1:29:24] the the makebeliever, the unbeliever, he
[1:29:26] just disregards it. The makebeliever
[1:29:29] looks for the opportunity to justify why
[1:29:31] he doesn't believe it.
[1:29:35] Hallelujah.
[1:29:36] See how easy it is. Kadesh
[1:29:38] Barnea. Amen.
[1:29:42] Beor Dayan
[1:29:44] Kora. People not fully persuaded. If
[1:29:48] they had been fully persuaded, Israel
[1:29:50] would have walked out of Egypt and they
[1:29:53] wouldn't have stopped walking until they
[1:29:54] walked into the promised land. Amen.
[1:29:57] Because their shoes weren't going to
[1:29:58] wear out. Their bodies would not have
[1:30:00] been weary. They would have just going
[1:30:03] and pressed right into that. But you
[1:30:05] see, they weren't fully persuaded. The
[1:30:07] Red Sea becomes an obstacle. Uh the
[1:30:10] Pharaoh's army, oh my goodness, we've
[1:30:12] just been drawn here to the desert to
[1:30:14] die. The only reason that they could be
[1:30:16] that is they never were fully persuaded
[1:30:19] that the promise to take them in the
[1:30:21] promised land was valid because
[1:30:23] otherwise there's no way Pharaoh's army
[1:30:25] could have come and stopped them from
[1:30:28] going in if they believe the promise. If
[1:30:30] they stood on it, that my brother and
[1:30:32] sister, I'll bring it to this day right
[1:30:33] here. There's people that are looking
[1:30:36] for something to happen to give them
[1:30:38] something to believe there's going to be
[1:30:40] a rapture. And there's people that are
[1:30:41] here saying, "I am the rapture." Amen. I
[1:30:44] am the word come to life in this day. I
[1:30:47] am the tabernacle. Amen. And I'm in a
[1:30:50] wilderness, but God's in this
[1:30:51] tabernacle. Cuz it's not the badger
[1:30:54] skin, my brother and sister. It's what's
[1:30:56] dwelling inside the badger skin. Sorry I
[1:30:59] called you all badgers. But you look at
[1:31:02] that. It's not you, my brother and
[1:31:04] sister. It's Christ in you. Brother
[1:31:06] Brandham even puts it this way, it's God
[1:31:08] in you. And we got to understand, as
[1:31:11] brother Brandham also says that God,
[1:31:13] Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, it's all
[1:31:15] the same thing. Amen. Don't let somebody
[1:31:18] dice that up in your life. My brother
[1:31:20] and sister, God is God and he's present
[1:31:23] here today doing his will in the midst
[1:31:26] of his people. And I'm persuaded of
[1:31:29] that. Amen.
[1:31:32] Hallelujah. So these two positions
[1:31:34] either fully persuaded or not persuaded.
[1:31:37] Why do people act like they do? They're
[1:31:39] not persuaded or they're fully
[1:31:41] persuaded. Depend on how you want to do
[1:31:43] this, my brother and sister. Why do
[1:31:45] people live on the fringe of the word?
[1:31:47] They're not fully persuaded. Amen. Why
[1:31:50] do they argue with the word? They're not
[1:31:52] persuaded. Amen. All kinds of things.
[1:31:55] But here again, I want to I just feel to
[1:31:57] put clarity to this. The outside world
[1:32:00] would say, "Well, you guys are in a cult
[1:32:01] because you just blindly follow." No,
[1:32:03] I'm sorry, my brother and sister. I
[1:32:05] believe this word, and I want to
[1:32:07] punctuate it with an amen, but God's
[1:32:10] also laid on my heart an understanding
[1:32:12] to pick up my Bible. Amen. And pick up
[1:32:15] history as it were, and to look through
[1:32:17] that and be able to say, "The prophet
[1:32:20] said this." There it is. Oh, here it is.
[1:32:22] Manifested through history, coming
[1:32:24] alive. The promise was to this last day.
[1:32:28] I can trace this all the way down. We're
[1:32:30] in the last day. Amen. That's why it's
[1:32:33] supposed to be here. Look what's
[1:32:35] happening around this prophecy about a
[1:32:37] pope from America, my brother and
[1:32:39] sister. People coming up with all kinds
[1:32:41] of wild explanations. And when you take
[1:32:44] their explanation and took back to the
[1:32:46] prophecy the prophet made there and you
[1:32:49] take that back, okay, I can kind of
[1:32:51] almost see how they come to this
[1:32:53] conclusion. Amen. Some of them got the
[1:32:55] rapture going to be in a day or two. I
[1:32:57] pray that it is. Amen. I also pray,
[1:33:00] Lord, let me be ready. I might be the
[1:33:03] one that's hindering the rapture. I say
[1:33:05] this to make a point to you. I might be
[1:33:08] the one, Lord, don't come with and
[1:33:10] don't, you know, leave me, Lord. I want
[1:33:12] to be ready for that rapture. I want to
[1:33:14] be part of that. But you see, what we
[1:33:16] got to do is just stand up today. Be
[1:33:19] fully persuaded that this word is
[1:33:21] redeeming our souls. Amen. And the flesh
[1:33:24] is irrelevant.
[1:33:27] Amen. Oh my.
[1:33:30] Your flesh. I'm sorry to tell you. Your
[1:33:32] flesh
[1:33:34] is irrelevant. Amen. I feel That's
[1:33:38] right. I'm attracted to this over here.
[1:33:40] Well, maybe you're attracted to that
[1:33:42] because that's all you look at. That's
[1:33:44] right.
[1:33:46] I I just can't help, you know, my you
[1:33:50] outdate myself. Forgive me. I just can't
[1:33:53] help but listen to to my rock and roll.
[1:33:56] I just I can't stop listening to it. You
[1:33:59] know why you can't stop listening to it?
[1:34:01] Because that's what you're feeding on.
[1:34:03] Amen. And what you feed on is what gives
[1:34:06] you your strength. And so when it gives
[1:34:09] you strength, you feed more on that.
[1:34:13] Lord, help us. Amen. Lord, help us. I'll
[1:34:17] tell you just personal testimony. I've
[1:34:19] shared it before. It took years for me.
[1:34:22] Now, I wasn't serving God. I definitely
[1:34:24] wasn't a preacher. None of that thing.
[1:34:26] But took years to break the spirit of
[1:34:28] rock and roll.
[1:34:30] Oh, it wasn't every day. Wasn't all day.
[1:34:33] It would come up in the strangest of
[1:34:36] places and the strangest of times.
[1:34:43] And I would tell
[1:34:46] myself, that song brings back such good
[1:34:50] memories, "Oh
[1:34:53] my, back to my childhood, driving
[1:34:56] through the Arizona desert at 120 miles
[1:34:58] an
[1:34:59] hour. Windows rolled down, the music
[1:35:02] turned up as loud as it will go." Such a
[1:35:05] good memory.
[1:35:08] A memory of me 120 miles an hour on my
[1:35:11] way to hell. Yeah. A good
[1:35:15] memory. No.
[1:35:20] No. Rock of
[1:35:23] Ages cleft for
[1:35:25] me. You know, it's
[1:35:28] interesting. When I become persuaded
[1:35:30] that wasn't who I
[1:35:32] was, the music went
[1:35:35] away. breaking the speed
[1:35:38] limit like that. Let me put it that way.
[1:35:40] I'm I've been guilty, you know, we won't
[1:35:43] start throwing stones here. Amen. But um
[1:35:48] you know, driving like a wild man, you
[1:35:52] know, all strangely enough, when I
[1:35:55] become fully persuaded, this all started
[1:35:58] leaving. I didn't have to go fight with
[1:36:00] this to get rid of this spirit. You say,
[1:36:03] "But I'm fighting with this." You're not
[1:36:04] persuaded. That's it.
[1:36:07] Lord help
[1:36:09] us. Lord help us. You
[1:36:14] know one thing that's persuaded people
[1:36:17] have in
[1:36:19] common, the word is their absolute.
[1:36:22] That's right. One thing every one of us
[1:36:24] should have in common is the word is our
[1:36:27] absolute.
[1:36:29] Amen. The unpersuaded, this might be a
[1:36:31] little direct. Forgive me if it is. But
[1:36:33] the unpersuaded hold to various ideas or
[1:36:36] ideals as equal to truth. That's right.
[1:36:41] Yes, sir. Had a man tell me one time,
[1:36:43] "Ah, the message." I don't know why they
[1:36:45] tout that. I learned about the Godhead
[1:36:47] while I was in the Lutheran
[1:36:50] church. You know what I had to do? I had
[1:36:52] to go home, get on the computer, look up
[1:36:55] Lutheran Church's view of the
[1:36:57] Godhead. And I was like, "That explains
[1:37:01] it.
[1:37:05] not
[1:37:06] persuaded in the fashion that God laid
[1:37:09] upon brother Brandham's heart to lay the
[1:37:11] Godhead
[1:37:12] out. Got its own little thing here and
[1:37:15] its own little seed
[1:37:17] there. And then you wonder why
[1:37:20] individuals struggle with the message
[1:37:23] because they're not persuaded. That's
[1:37:26] right. That's right. They still hold to
[1:37:28] teaching they had when they were a young
[1:37:31] man.
[1:37:32] another church, another religion,
[1:37:34] another age, which the prophet of God
[1:37:36] said the spirit of that age forsook
[1:37:40] Christ and the church died.
[1:37:44] And they're holding on to a dead letter
[1:37:47] and placing it as equal to the message.
[1:37:50] Yes, sir. Oh my my brother and sister,
[1:37:52] you'll find that all kinds of behavior
[1:37:54] is explained when you can come down in
[1:37:57] the basic principle of persuaded and not
[1:38:01] persuaded. Because if we're following
[1:38:03] the message, we should be message
[1:38:05] people. The message should be persuading
[1:38:07] us. Actually, it's the Holy Spirit
[1:38:08] persuading us this is the truth. Amen.
[1:38:11] But if we're holding that this is an
[1:38:13] aberration from this because I think
[1:38:16] this is more important or or No, my
[1:38:18] brother and sister. Wrong. Wrong. Come
[1:38:20] on.
[1:38:22] Amen. Hebrews 10 19-2. I need to I need
[1:38:26] to definitely Oh my I really need to
[1:38:28] hurry. Hebrews 10 19-20. Having
[1:38:31] therefore, brother, boldness, enter into
[1:38:33] the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a
[1:38:36] new and living way. Right. forsaking the
[1:38:38] old denominational teaching and
[1:38:40] speaking, amen, which he hath
[1:38:42] consecrated for us through the veil,
[1:38:44] that is to say, his flesh, and having a
[1:38:46] high priest over the house of God, let
[1:38:48] us draw near with a true heart. Amen.
[1:38:52] Not a not a heart that's mildly
[1:38:54] converted. Amen. But a true heart. Amen.
[1:38:59] In full assurance of faith, having our
[1:39:01] hearts sprinkled from an evil
[1:39:03] conscience, and our bodies washed with
[1:39:05] pure water, let us hold fast to the
[1:39:07] profession of our faith without
[1:39:08] wavering, for he is faithful that
[1:39:10] promised. Let us consider one another to
[1:39:13] provoke unto love and to good works, not
[1:39:16] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[1:39:18] together, as the manner of some is, but
[1:39:21] exhorting one another, and so much the
[1:39:23] more as you see the day approaching.
[1:39:25] Amen. Now, I hope you all don't mind.
[1:39:27] going to have another blunt moment here,
[1:39:29] my brother and sister, if you don't
[1:39:31] believe you need to uh assemble
[1:39:33] together. Amen. You're not persuaded
[1:39:35] that this scripture is true. You're not
[1:39:38] uh persuaded that the word is the
[1:39:41] absolute if you say, "I can I can do
[1:39:43] what I want to do where I want to do."
[1:39:46] My brother and sister, Holy Spirit
[1:39:47] through the age. Amen. I I'm telling
[1:39:49] you, I don't want to get too too deep
[1:39:51] into that, but that comes up, it pops up
[1:39:54] here, it pops up there, pops up
[1:39:55] everywhere. Just stay home. listen to
[1:39:57] it. We're getting prepared for when they
[1:40:00] shut our churches down that we'll have
[1:40:03] we'll know the presence of God and have
[1:40:05] that in our home. Really, my brother and
[1:40:07] sister, if that was what God planned,
[1:40:10] that's what would be in his word. Amen.
[1:40:13] What he said was for us to come
[1:40:14] together. It's not about the preacher.
[1:40:16] It's not about anything. It's about
[1:40:18] obeying the word. Amen. It's not a
[1:40:20] preacher giving you a command, come to
[1:40:22] church. It's the word that is speaking.
[1:40:25] And we're either persuaded this word is
[1:40:27] true or we're not.
[1:40:32] That's right.
[1:40:36] Can I be bold?
[1:40:39] If the alternative is to stay
[1:40:42] home and the prophet said go back to the
[1:40:45] original, right?
[1:40:49] Do we have more revelation than the
[1:40:51] prophet?
[1:40:55] My brother and sister, you say, "But but
[1:40:56] but no, my brother and sister, one, if
[1:41:00] you really are listening to what the
[1:41:01] prophet of God said, when it comes down
[1:41:04] to that
[1:41:05] tribulation, Joseph's wife was in the
[1:41:08] house."
[1:41:10] I'm not going to sit here and just say,
[1:41:12] "Well, praise God. We'll hide in our
[1:41:16] house, have church in our house so they
[1:41:18] won't shut us down." You think that's
[1:41:19] going to stop them?
[1:41:22] Okay, you guys into conspiracy theories.
[1:41:27] Man, Brother David, you put me in a bad
[1:41:29] spot. Just be patient for this
[1:41:31] conspiracy
[1:41:34] theory. Walked through the airport in
[1:41:36] Boisey here a few weeks ago on our way
[1:41:38] to South
[1:41:41] Africa. I fumbled around with my ID
[1:41:43] giving it to the guy and I didn't get it
[1:41:45] shoved in the slot all the way. The
[1:41:48] little camera screen went boop and
[1:41:51] before it even reads my driver's
[1:41:53] license, he says, "Welcome, Mr.
[1:41:58] Hay." Sister Jerry and I get off a plane
[1:42:00] in Atlanta. We subscribe to Global Entry
[1:42:03] years ago just to fight the long lines
[1:42:07] that, you know, 2,000 people arrive in
[1:42:09] Atlanta on the same
[1:42:13] flights. You know, seven or eight, 10
[1:42:16] airplanes all
[1:42:19] That hall fills clear full of people. I
[1:42:21] don't know if you've ever experienced
[1:42:22] that. We got global entry. We walk over
[1:42:26] here. They made us walk, can you believe
[1:42:28] this? All the farthest side of the
[1:42:31] building. And I'm like, it used to be
[1:42:33] over there. Walk up. Little sign says,
[1:42:37] "Stand on the
[1:42:38] footprints. Stand on the
[1:42:41] footprints." Screen says, "Approved.
[1:42:44] Proceed." Yeah, we're here to the back
[1:42:47] of the church from the booth and I don't
[1:42:49] even know why the man did it. Maybe God
[1:42:50] was just making a little point to me.
[1:42:52] Amen. We're walking towards the officer
[1:42:55] that's in charge of that thing. He looks
[1:42:57] up and goes, "Paul and Jerry
[1:42:59] Halelet." Yes, sir. Keep on walking.
[1:43:03] Yeah.
[1:43:05] And we don't want them to know we
[1:43:07] believe the message.
[1:43:10] There's my conspiracy theory.
[1:43:14] We're going to hide in our house and
[1:43:15] they'll have no clue we believe this
[1:43:20] message.
[1:43:23] Seriously, come on. I'm persuaded that
[1:43:26] God has made you and I more than able to
[1:43:32] face everything of our age. Every
[1:43:36] calling he has placed upon us. We are
[1:43:39] more than able. I don't need to hide.
[1:43:44] Amen. I don't need to conceal. I don't
[1:43:47] need to try and use some kind of
[1:43:49] anonymity to to disappear from their
[1:43:52] screen. They know who you are.
[1:43:56] And if they don't right now, the devil
[1:43:57] will come and make sure they know. H.
[1:44:01] So, what is getting the bride ready, my
[1:44:03] brother and sister, for a
[1:44:08] rapture? Well, the preaching of the
[1:44:10] word. uh understanding God sent a
[1:44:12] prophet and no my brother and sister
[1:44:16] what is getting a bride ready is whether
[1:44:19] or not she's accepting the full
[1:44:21] propituation of the word in other words
[1:44:25] I sit here today fully persuaded this is
[1:44:30] the truth that's what's getting us ready
[1:44:33] Kadesh Barnea my brother and sister you
[1:44:36] know what would have changed everything
[1:44:37] about Kadesh Barnea it was not about
[1:44:40] them going out and slaying the enemy and
[1:44:43] proving the thing. The fruit that they
[1:44:44] hauled back was just an evidence to the
[1:44:47] people that didn't go over into the land
[1:44:50] that this is really true. And what would
[1:44:52] have changed them at Kadesh Barnea would
[1:44:54] just send a simple saying amen to the
[1:44:57] word. They didn't have to perform a
[1:45:00] great act. They didn't have to do
[1:45:02] anything. They just simply had to say
[1:45:04] amen. See how deceived they got? Now,
[1:45:08] we're not talking about saying an amen
[1:45:09] in church as to whether you receive it
[1:45:11] or not. Don't don't let the devil put
[1:45:12] that in your head. But my brother and
[1:45:14] sister, it's down in your heart. If you
[1:45:16] can't say amen to it down in your heart,
[1:45:18] amen, we got a serious issue. Cuz we
[1:45:20] should be convinced. Amen. We should be
[1:45:23] persuaded this is the truth. If not, if
[1:45:25] you think the Mormons have it, go be a
[1:45:27] Mormon. If you think the Catholics have
[1:45:29] it, go be a Catholic. Amen. My brother
[1:45:31] and sister, it's it's there. But you'll
[1:45:34] notice now the the uh prophecy over the
[1:45:37] papacy taken place many years ago.
[1:45:41] According to that prophecy, this is the
[1:45:43] last pope they'll ever
[1:45:45] have. Now, it gets complicated. Well,
[1:45:48] how do we know? Well, we
[1:45:52] don't. But we
[1:45:54] do. Want to hear another conspiracy?
[1:45:59] Revelation says the
[1:46:03] spirit and the bride say come. Amen. I
[1:46:07] want to ask you a question. Has there
[1:46:10] ever been a time in the years that we
[1:46:12] look backwards that a bride has been
[1:46:15] more prepared than right now to be
[1:46:20] declaring come
[1:46:25] oil in your lamp. Come. Amen. Receive
[1:46:28] the fullness of the gift. Come.
[1:46:31] You see, my brother and sister, ages
[1:46:33] gone by, they were they they testifi
[1:46:37] there. Some of them testified,
[1:46:38] Philadelphia age, they testified
[1:46:40] probably stronger than we do. Amen. They
[1:46:43] had a lot of gifts. They didn't have the
[1:46:44] fullness of the word. And if they didn't
[1:46:47] have it, they couldn't be persuaded of
[1:46:48] it because God through the prophet says
[1:46:51] now all they had to do is believe the
[1:46:52] word for their age. And we're coming
[1:46:54] down to the outpouring of the fullness
[1:46:57] of the mystery of Christ in you and I.
[1:47:00] Amen. Are we making any sense? Let me
[1:47:02] hurry up and finish here. Amen. So, look
[1:47:06] at this. I'm sorry if that sounded
[1:47:07] blunt, but my brother and sister, you
[1:47:09] know, uh there's just just a point when
[1:47:12] when little things get sent to you, you
[1:47:15] see little things and people are almost
[1:47:17] like, see, if you if you still have a
[1:47:18] pastor, how you like this one for a
[1:47:20] statement? If you still have a pastor,
[1:47:22] you need to get a revelation of the
[1:47:23] message. Well, you know what? Um, I I do
[1:47:29] have a revelation of the message. That's
[1:47:31] right. And it told me to have a pastor.
[1:47:35] And it told me to go to church. And it
[1:47:38] told me I needed to receive the Holy
[1:47:39] Ghost. Amen.
[1:47:43] Persuaded.
[1:47:46] Yes, sir. Fully persuaded. Yeah.
[1:47:50] in the seventh church age here for the
[1:47:52] brothers to put that up. Amen. Now,
[1:47:55] don't get led astray here. When I said
[1:47:57] that God and his ways never change, I
[1:47:59] did not say that the church and its
[1:48:01] messengers could not change. The church
[1:48:04] isn't God, so she can change. But what I
[1:48:07] said was because of the unchanging God
[1:48:09] with unchanging ways, we can go back to
[1:48:12] the beginning and see the first and
[1:48:14] perfect act of God, then judge by that
[1:48:17] standard. That is how it is done. The
[1:48:20] true church will always try to be like
[1:48:23] the original at Pentecost. Now, my
[1:48:25] brother and sister, I don't know why I'm
[1:48:26] I'm pushing on this. Forgive me, but my
[1:48:29] brother and sister, they didn't go to
[1:48:31] their own upper
[1:48:32] room on the day of Pentecost.
[1:48:36] They went to church. They joined
[1:48:39] together. They exhorted one another.
[1:48:41] They talked about the goodness of God
[1:48:42] and the opening of the word and the
[1:48:44] presence of the Holy Spirit to the level
[1:48:46] that they knew that. And God was so
[1:48:48] honored by what they were speaking and
[1:48:51] fellowshipping and worshiping that he
[1:48:53] come right down in that room. And that
[1:48:54] was our day of Pentecost. It wasn't
[1:48:56] taking place in my upper room. Brother
[1:48:58] Alex lives in a house. Sister Rachel
[1:49:00] lives in a house that's got an upstairs.
[1:49:02] Amen. I don't know. Maybe maybe I'd have
[1:49:05] to go to their house to be in the upper
[1:49:07] room. Amen. We don't have an upper room.
[1:49:09] Amen. But you look at that. No, that
[1:49:11] isn't what God's talking about, my
[1:49:13] brother and sister. That was them coming
[1:49:15] together by the leadership of the Holy
[1:49:17] Spirit. And it was not an invitation
[1:49:20] only, my brother and sister. The
[1:49:22] invitation was placed in the heart. And
[1:49:25] it was the heart, the Holy Ghost, that
[1:49:28] led them to the upper room because God
[1:49:30] knew who needed to be there. Amen. Now,
[1:49:33] that experience come out of the upper
[1:49:35] room and was spread and given, broke a
[1:49:38] sunder, as it were, the Holy Spirit
[1:49:40] amongst the people. But my brother and
[1:49:42] sister, there had to be an upper room.
[1:49:44] And the prophet of God is laying here
[1:49:46] that it is this that God takes us right
[1:49:48] back to the original. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:49:52] Unchanging God with unchanging ways. And
[1:49:54] we can go back to the beginning and see
[1:49:56] the first and perfect act of God and
[1:49:58] then judge by that standard. That is how
[1:50:00] it is done. The true church will always
[1:50:02] try to be like the original at
[1:50:04] Pentecost. The true church of today will
[1:50:07] try to approximate that early first one.
[1:50:10] and the messengers to the churches
[1:50:13] having the same spirit of God in them
[1:50:15] will try to approximate the apostle of
[1:50:17] God. Now when you look at this word
[1:50:19] approximate is not an
[1:50:23] imitation right the leadership of the
[1:50:26] Holy Spirit will not come we can't say
[1:50:29] brother David I'm sorry to use you for
[1:50:30] an example but brother David and I both
[1:50:32] can't stand in this pulpit and say we
[1:50:34] both have the Holy Spirit and preach two
[1:50:36] entirely divergent ideas of what this
[1:50:39] message is. Amen. If we've got the Holy
[1:50:42] Ghost Amen. I'm saying both of us we
[1:50:45] have the Holy Ghost. It's going to bring
[1:50:46] us into where we're so aligned that we
[1:50:49] will literally, and this happens, we'll
[1:50:51] literally I go, I'm going to have to go
[1:50:53] home and tear up them notes cuz they'll
[1:50:55] sound like I'm preaching brother David's
[1:50:56] sermon. Amen. And he shared the same
[1:50:59] thing, my brother and sister. You see,
[1:51:01] God's not separating into two different
[1:51:04] ideas. Amen. A man says, "Why is their
[1:51:06] denomination?" Amen. I like this man. He
[1:51:09] was in a denomination, but he said,
[1:51:10] "It's because man's opinion of the word
[1:51:13] separates us."
[1:51:14] And there's the thing. We're not here
[1:51:16] for the opinion of man's word. What did
[1:51:18] the original say?
[1:51:21] Amen.
[1:51:24] Won't be exactly like him, but the true
[1:51:26] messengers will be the ones that come
[1:51:27] the closest to Paul, who is free of all
[1:51:30] men, sold out to God, gave forth the
[1:51:32] word of God only, and manifested the
[1:51:35] Holy Ghost in power. No one else would
[1:51:37] do. You have to work from the original
[1:51:40] as like beggets like. The true church
[1:51:42] will always be the one that tries to
[1:51:44] follow in the steps of her founders at
[1:51:46] Pentecost. And her messengers will
[1:51:48] follow the Apostle Paul, the first
[1:51:50] messenger, to the first church. It was
[1:51:52] that simple and that wonderful. Can
[1:51:55] someone say amen to that? Look, I'm
[1:51:57] going to hurry along here. Eve walked in
[1:52:00] the light until she was persuaded
[1:52:03] differently.
[1:52:05] That's right. Absolutely right.
[1:52:10] That's right. My brother and sister, he
[1:52:12] wasn't an unbeliever the whole time, but
[1:52:14] she stopped long enough to listen to
[1:52:16] someone's persuasion.
[1:52:18] Not the word. Persuasion, right? Another
[1:52:22] voice come to her and she gave heed to
[1:52:25] it. Amen. And the word has come. Can we
[1:52:28] say amen to that? The word has come and
[1:52:32] another voice come in this day.
[1:52:35] And what did that voice tell us to do?
[1:52:40] Go do what the word said. That's right.
[1:52:45] Really simple. Did I condense that down
[1:52:48] too far for us to grasp?
[1:52:51] Prophet said, "Keep it simple." Right?
[1:52:53] Holy Spirit keeps it simple. Condense it
[1:52:56] down. A prophet's message in this day
[1:52:59] condensed right down.
[1:53:02] Just do what the word says. That's
[1:53:04] right. Now, if there's no revelation of
[1:53:06] the word, you can't do what the word
[1:53:07] says. So then it right comes back that
[1:53:09] God's pouring revelation. Amen. Shining
[1:53:11] the light on a seed that already exists
[1:53:14] in you. That's right. Amen. God didn't
[1:53:16] come on the day you were saved and put a
[1:53:18] seed in you. Amen. That seed was there
[1:53:21] the whole time. Amen. Amen. Just do what
[1:53:25] God told you to do. Live the word.
[1:53:29] That's all you got to do. Now, in the
[1:53:30] message, three kinds of believers.
[1:53:32] Hurrying right along here. But the real
[1:53:34] believers don't question nothing.
[1:53:37] Now, see, if you take that, some people
[1:53:38] will say, "See, proof you're in a cult.
[1:53:40] You don't question anything." But you
[1:53:42] see, I don't need to question it when I
[1:53:44] hear truth. That's right. When I hear
[1:53:46] truth, I don't need to question it.
[1:53:48] Truth is truth. That's right. Amen.
[1:53:54] It's written in the word. They believe
[1:53:56] it. And they just go on. That's right.
[1:53:59] That's it. Always. It's written.
[1:54:02] If it isn't written, why you just stay
[1:54:04] away from it? No matter what happens,
[1:54:07] it's got to be written. See? And they
[1:54:10] say, and they see that written word and
[1:54:12] they believe it. And they see God moving
[1:54:15] in his word. They see the hour of the
[1:54:17] message, the time, and they walk with
[1:54:20] it. Amen. I want to be that kind of
[1:54:22] believer, fully persuaded. Amen.
[1:54:24] Hallelujah.
[1:54:27] Hallelujah. Oh my. see what we can move
[1:54:32] right along
[1:54:37] here. Are we okay with some direct
[1:54:39] things? I'll close here. You see, if
[1:54:42] we're persuaded, we will honor God.
[1:54:44] That's right. Right.
[1:54:47] We want to honor him. That's right.
[1:54:51] And we'll present ourselves as sons and
[1:54:53] daughters of God. That's right.
[1:54:56] Okay. Don't justify your attitude.
[1:55:00] have the attitude of Christ. That's it.
[1:55:04] What will be the attitude that honors
[1:55:09] God? The spirit about us. Kind of like
[1:55:12] attitude but deeper. The spirit about
[1:55:17] us. What are we
[1:55:19] like? You know, Abselon had following.
[1:55:26] Sure did. What was his spirit?
[1:55:32] our
[1:55:35] clothes. My I don't mean to offend
[1:55:37] anybody, but I'll tell
[1:55:40] you. I think we ought to maybe clean our
[1:55:42] closets out, go through again and say,
[1:55:45] would I want to meet the Lord Jesus
[1:55:47] dressed like this?
[1:55:49] That's it. That's as far as I'm going to
[1:55:50] go on clothes.
[1:55:52] Would you be happy to meet the Lord
[1:55:54] Jesus in your closet? Oh, it's that's
[1:55:57] just not sisters. No, that's right.
[1:55:59] Absolutely right. No, that's not just
[1:56:02] sisters, my brother and sister.
[1:56:06] Our close. Period. Amen.
[1:56:10] See, if we're
[1:56:12] persuaded, our statement will be, I will
[1:56:17] honor God. Amen. Not I'm going to try
[1:56:19] to. I will honor God.
[1:56:24] If we're not persuaded, we'll always be
[1:56:26] pushing against it. Yeah, that's it.
[1:56:30] See, you see the example comes right out
[1:56:32] in the message. They said, "Well,
[1:56:33] Brother Brandham, we can't buy clothes."
[1:56:36] Brother Brandham said, "Well, they still
[1:56:37] make goods and sewing machines." But you
[1:56:39] see, they use that as an excuse that
[1:56:41] that um we're pushing against we're
[1:56:44] pushing against it. We're pushing
[1:56:46] against it. And to push against it
[1:56:48] legitimately, we need a reason.
[1:56:51] But it's the word. There's no reason
[1:56:54] will counterbalance the
[1:56:56] scale against the word. Satan would give
[1:57:00] you just piles and piles of reasons,
[1:57:03] but it won't counterbalance the scale of
[1:57:05] the word. I'm just going to run right
[1:57:07] down what these notes I wrote here.
[1:57:09] Amen. We we'll be pushing against it
[1:57:11] with our music,
[1:57:13] with our attitude, with our clothes,
[1:57:16] with our opinions. That's right,
[1:57:20] as though God would be influenced by us.
[1:57:27] Lord, I think the dress code is a little
[1:57:29] too
[1:57:30] strict. I can see God now. Well, you
[1:57:35] know, I've taken your opinion into
[1:57:38] account. Unfortunately, I can't unprint
[1:57:41] all of the scripture that's been printed
[1:57:44] through the ages. So, I'm going to
[1:57:46] maintain my position, and I suggest that
[1:57:50] you change yours.
[1:57:57] I don't even want to serve a God that
[1:57:59] could be changed by my opinion.
[1:58:04] And I'll tell you this as we
[1:58:06] close, only a religious spirit will be
[1:58:09] impressed by how close we can live to
[1:58:12] the world. That's exactly right. You
[1:58:15] want an example of that? Brother Brown
[1:58:17] talking about the chariots on the wall,
[1:58:19] the cliff going over the mountain. Yeah.
[1:58:23] I can drive so close to the
[1:58:26] world and I can drive so close to this
[1:58:29] edge. Maybe, you know, let me put it
[1:58:32] this way. I can drive so
[1:58:35] close to this
[1:58:37] edge. Legalism.
[1:58:41] I'll be blunt, sisters. You mind if I
[1:58:44] use you for an example? Thank you.
[1:58:48] Your dress dragging the
[1:58:50] ground will not make you any more of a
[1:58:54] believer. That's exactly right.
[1:58:58] But let's not go liberal and say, "I see
[1:59:01] a picture of Sister Rebecca standing
[1:59:03] there with her daddy and her dress, the
[1:59:06] tops of her kneecaps are showing." So,
[1:59:08] we have a Why don't we find middle
[1:59:11] ground? The prophet of God says, you
[1:59:13] know, drive against the wall, drive
[1:59:16] against the ledge.
[1:59:18] Just drive in the middle of the road.
[1:59:21] Is this all right? Nobody Nobody's
[1:59:23] feeling offended. I hope.
[1:59:26] See, we got to be persuaded, my brother
[1:59:28] and sister. It's the middle of the road.
[1:59:30] It's not this ditch. It's not this
[1:59:31] ditch. Amen. The middle of the
[1:59:34] road. Oh
[1:59:36] my. Come, Sister Ruth, if you would,
[1:59:39] please.
[1:59:41] Amen. Being persuaded Romans
[1:59:44] 8:37-39. Nay, in all these things we are
[1:59:47] more than conquerors. This our original
[1:59:49] scripture. Through him that loved us.
[1:59:51] For I'm persuaded that neither death nor
[1:59:53] life, nor angels, nor principalities,
[1:59:55] nor powers, nor things present, nor
[1:59:57] things to come, nor height, nor depth,
[2:00:00] nor any other creature shall be able.
[2:00:03] And I don't believe the Lord would be
[2:00:05] offended for me to change
[2:00:08] this. nor height, nor depth, nor any
[2:00:11] other creature shall be able to separate
[2:00:14] me. That's right. From the love of God
[2:00:17] which is in Christ Jesus. And you want
[2:00:20] to as I close here, you want to know one
[2:00:24] of the last
[2:00:25] great thoughts of persuaded
[2:00:30] is it's so
[2:00:33] incredible. God was
[2:00:35] persuaded that you're worth it. That's
[2:00:38] right.
[2:00:40] That to me is the greatest of all the
[2:00:43] things that would be
[2:00:44] persuaded. As he
[2:00:47] said, they're worth my blood. They're
[2:00:51] worth my life. They're worth what I will
[2:00:55] give for them. They're worth it. Amen.
[2:00:59] Hallelujah. Let's stand. Two
[2:01:02] roads. Amen.
[2:01:06] I don't want to
[2:01:08] sound bluff or whatever, but I will not
[2:01:11] be apologetic for preaching what the
[2:01:13] Lord laid on my heart. Amen. It's time
[2:01:17] for us saints. That's right. Oh, we're
[2:01:20] all spooked. The message is all spooked.
[2:01:22] The ripple has went through the message.
[2:01:24] A pope from America. What's that got to
[2:01:27] do with you doing what the word called
[2:01:29] you to do?
[2:01:31] The prophet didn't say, "Ah, when you
[2:01:33] see the Pope from America,
[2:01:36] then you go over here and you get it all
[2:01:40] sorted
[2:01:41] out." No. Over and over again, he says,
[2:01:44] "Now take
[2:01:46] this, put oil in your lamp,
[2:01:49] and live for him every
[2:01:53] day." Not the day that they elect the
[2:01:57] pope. You want to realize the
[2:01:59] conspiracies are already coming out? I
[2:02:00] don't know why I keep using this word
[2:02:03] conspiracies. Do you know this is right
[2:02:05] in the realm of the shortest time to
[2:02:08] confirm a pope ever?
[2:02:12] It's already settled. They already knew.
[2:02:14] Yeah. Why? Because they can't do
[2:02:17] anything but what the word led them. The
[2:02:19] Holy Spirit led them to choose that man
[2:02:23] in this season, in these circumstances.
[2:02:26] They had no other choice. That's right.
[2:02:29] Oh, but they they made the decision
[2:02:31] themselves. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Like the
[2:02:36] Holy Spirit never had any influence on
[2:02:41] mankind. Let me part this with
[2:02:45] you. Did
[2:02:49] Lot choose
[2:02:52] Sodom of his own choice?
[2:03:01] Do you know the truth of it
[2:03:03] is? Lot couldn't have chosen anything
[2:03:09] else because only two
[2:03:14] sides. Lot was on the plains of memory
[2:03:17] and Adam was in Sodom. I mean Adam
[2:03:19] Abraham in
[2:03:20] Sodom. No, no choice.
[2:03:24] Everything that was was an anointing, a
[2:03:27] desire placed. It was put there. Why are
[2:03:30] you here today instead of driving a
[2:03:32] go-kart at whatever that place is,
[2:03:35] Meridian? Playing putt putt golf today.
[2:03:39] Maybe even riding a water slide. I don't
[2:03:41] know. Maybe it's not open. I don't
[2:03:44] know. Yeah. Let me tell you. Talk about
[2:03:47] anointings. Driving by the
[2:03:50] lake. There's people out there that
[2:03:53] water running down the canal is the same
[2:03:56] water landing in that lake. I put my
[2:03:58] hand in the water, it's like that water
[2:03:59] is cold. And there's people out there
[2:04:02] enjoying the lake with no clothes on in
[2:04:05] that same water that makes me go
[2:04:09] brr. Talk about
[2:04:11] anointings. It's the age that we live
[2:04:14] in. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:04:18] There are two
[2:04:22] roads you may
[2:04:26] take, one by
[2:04:30] side and one by
[2:04:36] faith. Take the word of God.
[2:04:41] Oh, what you
[2:04:45] see, what you
[2:04:49] believe is
[2:04:55] what your
[2:04:58] wings to the words of
[2:05:03] faith. You can
[2:05:07] fly a high
[2:05:13] Do not
[2:05:17] struggle. It's by
[2:05:21] grace. Set your
[2:05:25] wings to the winds of
[2:05:30] faith. Oh, watch your
[2:05:35] knees. Watch your cry.
[2:05:41] Watch your
[2:05:44] mountain. Oh, much too
[2:05:48] high. Speak the word of God. Oh, help us
[2:05:53] Lord to speak. I am
[2:05:58] by. It will
[2:06:02] move. You will fly.
[2:06:08] Set your
[2:06:11] wings to the winds of
[2:06:16] faith. You can
[2:06:20] fly in a higher
[2:06:25] place. Do not
[2:06:29] struggle. It's by grace.
[2:06:35] Let your
[2:06:38] wings through the winds of
[2:06:43] faith. Oh, watch the
[2:06:48] goal in the
[2:06:52] sky. He does not struggle.
[2:06:57] He does not
[2:07:01] strive for the
[2:07:05] power that makes him
[2:07:10] rise is
[2:07:14] already in the
[2:07:19] sky. Set your
[2:07:22] wings to the winds of faith.
[2:07:28] You can
[2:07:31] fly in a higher
[2:07:37] place. You not
[2:07:41] struggle. It's by
[2:07:46] grace set your
[2:07:50] way to the winds of faith.
[2:07:57] Amen. Amen. Let me sing the song. Uh, my
[2:08:01] hope is in the
[2:08:05] Lord. I stand in awe within the
[2:08:15] presence, the living sacrifice, the only
[2:08:18] source of life. Hallelujah.
[2:08:22] I stand in all within the presence of
[2:08:28] the
[2:08:31] Lord. In whom the wisdom of the
[2:08:36] aes
[2:08:39] lie. For whom the rageing of the
[2:08:45] sea
[2:08:48] subside. A
[2:08:50] livinging
[2:08:53] sacrifice, the only
[2:08:56] source of
[2:08:58] life. My
[2:09:02] hope is in the
[2:09:06] Lord. From this time
[2:09:10] on and ever more.
[2:09:16] Oh my
[2:09:19] hope is in the
[2:09:24] Lord forever more.
[2:09:33] stand of mercy's come with a rising
[2:09:40] sun. Who meet the sinner in his
[2:09:48] brokenness. Who offer healing and
[2:09:52] forgiveness.
[2:09:57] And those who trust in
[2:10:01] him will find their
[2:10:04] hearts at
[2:10:06] rest. My
[2:10:09] hope is in the
[2:10:13] Lord. From this time
[2:10:18] on and ever
[2:10:21] more. Oh, my
[2:10:26] hope is in the
[2:10:31] Lord forever more. My
[2:10:39] trust, my
[2:10:43] trust is in the
[2:10:47] Lord. From this time
[2:10:51] on and ever
[2:10:54] more. Oh my
[2:10:59] trust is in the
[2:11:03] Lord
[2:11:05] forever
[2:11:10] more.
[2:11:12] Amen. Amen.
[2:11:24] When you're persuaded on something,
[2:11:30] just it means, you
[2:11:34] know, you believe in that so much. And
[2:11:38] with his word, what his word says to
[2:11:43] us. No matter I
[2:11:46] keep you all know doesn't what this
[2:11:50] flesh sees, what it feels, what it
[2:11:52] understands does not
[2:11:54] matter. What his word says I am
[2:11:57] persuaded. I am persuaded. What his word
[2:12:00] says is real. Every day that becomes
[2:12:02] more and more real to me.
[2:12:07] There is nothing else that
[2:12:11] matters. Praise his name.
[2:12:18] Hallelujah. Let's sing that song. The
[2:12:21] battle is the
[2:12:22] Lord's. It's his. It's all his. I give
[2:12:25] it all to him.
[2:12:28] What I'm going to do is going to screw
[2:12:29] it up. What he does matters.
[2:12:33] Amen. Help me out. I can't remember the
[2:12:36] the tune to
[2:12:39] this. There is a
[2:12:44] soul in times of
[2:12:48] need. that gives me
[2:12:53] hope, that brings me
[2:12:57] peace. In every
[2:13:02] trial, through every
[2:13:06] test, my savior
[2:13:11] stand in mighty defense.
[2:13:16] Oh, and the road you
[2:13:20] walk leaves you tired and
[2:13:25] warm all his strength is
[2:13:29] gone and your heart feels
[2:13:35] torn. Remember,
[2:13:38] God is greater than the stone.
[2:13:44] Take courage
[2:13:47] for
[2:13:49] battle is the
[2:13:52] Lord. When the waters
[2:13:57] rise, he calls my
[2:14:01] name and bids me
[2:14:05] come out on the way.
[2:14:10] He holds my
[2:14:13] hand lest I should
[2:14:18] falter and makes me
[2:14:22] stand upon the water.
[2:14:28] When the road you
[2:14:31] walk leaves you tired and
[2:14:36] warm, all your strength is
[2:14:40] gone and your heart feels
[2:14:45] torn. Remember,
[2:14:48] God is greater than the storm.
[2:14:55] Take courage
[2:14:57] for the battle is the Lord.
[2:15:06] Amen.
[2:15:08] Amen. I love the the words to that
[2:15:11] second verse. Bids me come out on the
[2:15:13] water.
[2:15:15] Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:15:18] as we're dismissed this morning. Like to
[2:15:22] just sing that uh listen to your listen
[2:15:25] to our hearts.
[2:15:32] Amen. What is your heart crying out for
[2:15:35] this morning?
[2:15:40] How do you explain?
[2:15:45] How do you
[2:15:49] describe a love that goes from east to
[2:15:55] west and run deep as it is
[2:16:00] wide. You know all our
[2:16:05] hope. Lord, you know all our fear.
[2:16:12] When words cannot express the love we
[2:16:16] feel, but we long for you to
[2:16:22] hear. Listen to our
[2:16:27] hearts. Hear our spirit
[2:16:32] sing. A song of praise that
[2:16:37] flows from those you have
[2:16:43] redeemed. And we will use the words we
[2:16:47] know to tell you what an awesome God you
[2:16:54] are. When words are not enough to tell
[2:16:58] you of our love, just listen to our
[2:17:02] heart.
[2:17:06] If words could fall like
[2:17:11] crane from these lips of
[2:17:16] mine. And if I had a thousand
[2:17:21] years, I would still run out of
[2:17:26] time. So if you listen to my
[2:17:32] heart, every beat will
[2:17:37] say, "Thank you for the life. Thank you
[2:17:42] for the truth. Thank you for the
[2:17:49] way. Listen to our
[2:17:54] hearts. Here our spirit
[2:18:00] sing the praise that
[2:18:05] flows for those you have
[2:18:10] redeemed. And we will use the words we
[2:18:13] know to tell you what an awesome God you
[2:18:20] are. When words are not enough to tell
[2:18:25] you of our love, just listen to our
[2:18:32] heart. Amen. Lord be with you this week.
[2:18:35] God bless each one of you. Happy
[2:18:37] Mother's Day again. Love you. God bless
[2:18:39] you.
