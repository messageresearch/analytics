[38:10] oh my
[38:12] you know sometimes i have to admit
[38:15] saints this morning
[38:16] early
[38:19] i did the little if you'd call it i
[38:21] don't know routine
[38:23] i normally do
[38:24] i sit down in the evening time and i
[38:27] write all the thoughts and all the
[38:29] things and i write them all down
[38:33] sometimes i don't even start to put it
[38:35] as it were in the ipad it's just there
[38:37] and i'm pondering at night
[38:39] i go to bed
[38:41] and i pray lord
[38:43] tonight make this real to me
[38:46] and i got up this morning and i started
[38:48] down this path and i
[38:50] found myself going off on this little
[38:52] crossroad
[38:54] i got out there a little ways and seemed
[38:56] like something said turn back
[38:59] and i come back to my thought and went a
[39:00] little further and i turned off on this
[39:02] little crossroad
[39:04] something spoke to me and said turn back
[39:07] so i just spoke to brother jason here i
[39:08] wish he'd remove the camera
[39:11] from my office because you see saints if
[39:13] i had ordered a song service this
[39:15] morning
[39:16] i'd have to say by god's grace i never
[39:18] thought of a single song here but if i
[39:20] could order it it would be this song
[39:21] service every song speaking to me
[39:25] and bringing me back to the crossroads
[39:27] that i in my thinking wanted to turn
[39:30] down
[39:31] i say thank you lord
[39:33] thank you lord hallelujah
[39:35] amen just before we go here i just want
[39:38] to remember the graham family on
[39:39] vacation
[39:41] i'm not sure i'm envious
[39:43] yes i'm envious
[39:45] anyway they're going to be gone for
[39:47] several weeks in arizona it's not all
[39:48] fun for brother adam he's going to paint
[39:51] uh his father
[39:52] mother-in-law's house and do some fix up
[39:55] work that needs done so remember them
[39:57] it's just not a total vacation just
[39:59] mostly
[40:01] anyway
[40:04] also
[40:06] service today when we dismiss you the
[40:08] service won't be over we're going to go
[40:10] downstairs
[40:11] and brother chris is going to have the
[40:13] grand privilege of baptizing his
[40:15] daughter this morning amen and
[40:19] so as as it is
[40:21] to be a minister
[40:23] and to be in that own place right there
[40:25] of your own child coming to you and
[40:28] desiring
[40:29] and being able to give that advice and
[40:32] leadership as
[40:33] as not just a father
[40:35] but as a minister of the gospel so uh
[40:38] when we are done today we'll just all go
[40:41] downstairs uh i don't want to explain it
[40:43] right now but that's probably how we'll
[40:45] do baptisms in the future uh versus
[40:48] putting the tank up here and
[40:50] and stuff so
[40:52] amen i want to speak to you this morning
[40:54] now having said what i said
[40:57] i gave this sermon
[40:59] 10 different titles this morning
[41:03] and then i'd get another inspiration
[41:05] from a crossroad
[41:07] and i rename it and then i come back and
[41:10] i said i'm going to take it back where i
[41:11] was in the original and i gave it
[41:12] another name
[41:14] but names don't really matter what we're
[41:16] looking for the title on the book right
[41:21] it's what's in the book
[41:23] and the word says that the life
[41:26] is in
[41:27] the book
[41:29] that's why we eat the book we don't just
[41:30] carry the book around and say i have a
[41:32] book
[41:33] right
[41:34] man i don't want to go down this avenue
[41:36] but i want to kind of make this point
[41:37] home too many people are walking around
[41:39] with a message book saying i'm in the
[41:41] message
[41:42] but we got to get the book from out here
[41:45] in here
[41:47] amen and when we get the book in here
[41:50] people are going to be saying um there's
[41:52] something different about you
[41:55] what is it i've ate the book
[41:58] amen i've ate the book and the book is
[42:00] good
[42:01] and you know now pardon me for using
[42:03] such a simple analogy
[42:05] all of you have some favorite little
[42:07] snack
[42:08] but my brother and sister
[42:11] if you're there
[42:14] well i'll just tell on sister jerry
[42:17] she makes queen elizabeth cake
[42:20] some of you if i don't
[42:22] offend anybody sister yulia said i like
[42:24] that cake amen
[42:27] and uh but let me tell you sister jerry
[42:29] when we were in monmouth
[42:31] for the sake of time i think and she
[42:33] made it a little different sister you
[42:35] lit you wait till you taste this new
[42:37] version
[42:40] and i ate a piece
[42:43] and i got up and i said i know i
[42:44] shouldn't eat this but this is just too
[42:46] good
[42:48] for just one helping
[42:51] too good
[42:53] and i had to go back get another piece
[42:56] now forgive me for my analogy
[42:59] but that is the gospel if we're not oh
[43:02] saints let me say it this way if we're
[43:04] not in the position that you have to go
[43:07] back for another bite then here's an
[43:09] altar and we need to pray through but
[43:12] when we get in that position we just
[43:13] can't stop eating the book it becomes so
[43:16] real so alive it tastes so good even
[43:19] though maybe there's something in our
[43:21] life that the book
[43:23] now becomes bitter
[43:25] because
[43:26] i realize lord i
[43:28] i have to now purge this from my life i
[43:31] ask you father come and wash this away
[43:33] from me
[43:34] deliver me from this certain affliction
[43:37] amen let's just go into the word today
[43:40] once again overall title i just couldn't
[43:42] break tradition
[43:44] um two sides of obedience and i want to
[43:46] speak to you on spiritual maturity
[43:49] and then because i couldn't give up on
[43:52] all these thoughts i have another title
[43:54] which i didn't give to the brothers to
[43:55] put on there but it's spiritual maturity
[43:58] in heavenly places
[44:01] amen we don't want to come as
[44:02] theologians i don't i don't want to be a
[44:05] theologian
[44:06] amen hallelujah
[44:09] as brother rich sings over there and
[44:11] they send greetings to the church
[44:12] brother rich sings this song i i never
[44:14] knew it till i heard it from them i
[44:16] don't want to be a goat
[44:19] nope
[44:20] i don't want to be a goat nope somebody
[44:24] help me finish that i can't remember the
[44:25] other words
[44:28] because a goat has no hope that's right
[44:30] amen and it just strikes me what a i
[44:33] think it's probably a children's song
[44:34] and i'm a child at heart
[44:36] and you know you just listen to and it's
[44:38] like yep lord i know who i am
[44:40] i know that i was called i've been
[44:42] redeemed it's a finished work but lord
[44:45] don't let me display
[44:47] any goat nature
[44:50] but then the devil comes and
[44:52] scratches on the screen door
[44:54] and we find ourselves
[44:56] but
[44:57] but
[44:58] but
[44:59] but
[45:00] oh that's a goat nature saints
[45:02] but we're going to have a butt here
[45:04] today that we're going to talk about so
[45:06] let's go to our bibles to ephesians
[45:09] the first chapter first verse
[45:11] and um
[45:13] just pray today
[45:16] um
[45:19] you know i hope you don't mind saints
[45:20] just lately
[45:22] some things in my life
[45:24] uh some things you know the lord dealing
[45:26] with
[45:28] uh
[45:29] in me you know some little complexes
[45:31] that he finally said it's time to stamp
[45:33] them out
[45:34] uh little circumstances around us where
[45:37] you say lord
[45:38] uh i i didn't ever intend to do someone
[45:41] any harm or anything but yet you know
[45:44] little things come and we have to deal
[45:46] with that and
[45:48] you know the lord's just gracious isn't
[45:49] he
[45:51] and um so as the word speak to us my
[45:53] brother and sister we just come to
[45:55] certain places and then we realize what
[45:57] it is that god wants us he wants
[45:59] something that you're going to preach
[46:00] now brother branham said often times
[46:03] okay so anybody who has ever felt i
[46:04] preached at you you can lift your hand
[46:06] and say yeah i think you preached at me
[46:08] no don't
[46:10] but did you know the prophet of god said
[46:12] that often times the minister is
[46:14] preaching on what is happening
[46:17] in his own
[46:18] life
[46:20] so if we took that in that light
[46:23] instead of saying i'm offended the
[46:25] pastor's preaching about me having a
[46:27] temper well what you don't know is maybe
[46:29] the pastor who hasn't had a hiccup in
[46:31] years
[46:33] had a little temper tantrum
[46:36] oh
[46:38] i hope you all don't get too
[46:40] shook up about that
[46:42] but you see then god takes that and
[46:44] causes that minister to go back in the
[46:47] word
[46:48] and he starts looking at his own life
[46:50] and starts examining whatever it might
[46:51] be i just use temper tantrum as an
[46:53] example and he starts looking at these
[46:55] things and he's oh my oh my
[46:58] and then we recognize everything happens
[47:00] as brother david shared with us god's in
[47:03] control
[47:05] and so as satan comes up like a roaring
[47:07] lion and says wow i sure swatted him
[47:09] into the dirt but god actually said you
[47:12] know what for him to preach this in
[47:15] sincerity to the people i think maybe he
[47:18] might need to experience that
[47:21] and then in stomach instead of coming
[47:23] judgmentally the minister can come and
[47:25] say i know what this is like
[47:28] and by god's grace we overcome it by
[47:30] god's grace we can press to the mark of
[47:32] the high calling
[47:34] amen
[47:35] ephesians 1 1-5
[47:39] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[47:41] will of god
[47:43] declaring i'm only in this position by
[47:45] god's will
[47:46] to the saints which are at ephesus and
[47:49] to the faithful
[47:50] in christ jesus which means we don't
[47:52] have to go to ephesus to receive this
[47:55] amen
[47:56] grace be to you and peace from god our
[47:59] father and from the lord jesus christ
[48:01] covered all the bases right there in the
[48:02] godhead my brother and sister
[48:06] blessed to be the god and father of our
[48:07] lord jesus christ
[48:09] who hath blessed us
[48:11] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[48:14] places in christ
[48:16] according as he hath chosen us in him
[48:20] before the foundation of the world
[48:24] that we should be holy
[48:27] and without blame before him in love
[48:31] so we can't take all of this and leave
[48:33] love out right the apostle paul included
[48:35] love here
[48:37] now he also declared in the word that
[48:39] love is corrective so don't think that
[48:41] the pastor
[48:43] the minister or our lord jesus christ
[48:45] doesn't love you because he corrected
[48:46] you it's a very integral part of our
[48:50] christian walk
[48:51] having predestinated us into the
[48:54] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[48:57] himself
[48:58] so in case i don't catch this a little
[49:00] farther along i want you to focus for
[49:03] one second here
[49:05] who
[49:06] did he bring this adoption into
[49:10] himself
[49:12] we're not adopted into the message as it
[49:16] were we're not adopted to be baptist
[49:18] methodist pentecostal
[49:21] we're adopted
[49:22] into jesus christ
[49:24] himself
[49:26] so if the devil comes and tries to give
[49:29] you any other identity
[49:33] are you with me
[49:34] the devil comes and tries to give you
[49:36] any other identity
[49:39] you hold up your adoption papers and say
[49:43] my adoption papers say that my father
[49:46] is jesus christ
[49:48] amen almighty god elohim jehovah prince
[49:52] of peace mighty god
[49:55] sorry devil i'm already been adopted
[49:58] i've not been put up for adoption again
[50:01] because my adoption papers say that this
[50:03] work that my
[50:05] father
[50:07] has started
[50:09] it's a finished adoption there's no room
[50:12] for a last-minute denial
[50:15] and sending us back to the orphanage
[50:19] hallelujah
[50:20] ma doesn't that make you happy
[50:22] and here we are a group of faithful
[50:25] god-fearing believers and it still stirs
[50:28] something within our soul to say thank
[50:31] you lord that the final a seal of the
[50:35] adoption has been put in place
[50:38] oh my oh my oh my
[50:41] having predestinated us into the
[50:42] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[50:45] himself according to the good pleasure
[50:48] of his will heavenly father we ask you
[50:50] this morning
[50:52] lord let us just step into a realm
[50:54] father where it's just you and us
[50:57] lord no thoughts of man and no
[50:59] distraction and lord we would actually
[51:01] just rebuke any spirit of distraction
[51:03] that might to try to bring us father
[51:05] from being able to see the full
[51:07] conclusion of the word in our life and
[51:10] father ask you today speak to us
[51:12] lord the prophet of god encouraged us to
[51:15] pray for revelation and lord i lift my
[51:18] own heart and my own hand this morning
[51:21] lord reveal your word to me
[51:23] father don't let it be limited but what
[51:26] i see at this present moment but father
[51:29] i ask you to open the windows of heaven
[51:30] and speak to our hearts today in the
[51:33] name of jesus christ bless all those
[51:35] father who are not here with us today
[51:38] lord touch each heart give healing
[51:41] virtue father whatever is necessary in
[51:44] the lives of your children we ask we
[51:46] commit this to you now in the name of
[51:48] jesus christ amen you may be seated
[51:51] saints
[51:55] good to see you sister to bethel amen i
[51:58] don't pronounce that right
[52:00] i
[52:01] i'm i've been around jay too long
[52:05] and words names that i think i i've i've
[52:08] just known and i find myself
[52:10] you know kind of like just
[52:12] hacking them up
[52:13] [Laughter]
[52:14] and i say that in all humor amen
[52:17] now this morning saints i want you to
[52:19] just uh look at this for just a moment
[52:22] there are four references
[52:24] uh in the bible concerning heavenly
[52:27] places and they're all in the book of
[52:29] ephesians in chapters one through three
[52:32] and so i want to if the lord wills
[52:35] maybe go through all four of these
[52:37] verses over time here and uh touch upon
[52:41] this but we'll look at this now and the
[52:43] ephesians
[52:45] my brother and sister were scholarly
[52:46] bunch of people they were they were not
[52:49] a bunch of uneducated neanderthals but
[52:52] they had a real basis of education they
[52:55] had an understanding and it is in this
[52:58] place and time that paul comes and he
[53:01] starts to refer
[53:02] in these four scriptures of heavenly
[53:05] places and so i wanted as we take our
[53:07] thought today from ephesians one i just
[53:10] want to pull this out i started
[53:12] originally i had quite a bit side roads
[53:15] quite a bit of things connected to the
[53:17] other four and then something spoke to
[53:19] me and says hey you've got from now to
[53:21] the rapture to preach this so just bring
[53:24] it back keep it simple amen so as we
[53:27] take our thought from that look at the
[53:29] apostle paul is speaking very positive
[53:32] to the believer
[53:34] isn't that beautiful i'll tell you what
[53:36] saints i there's times that we as
[53:38] ministers uh have to speak some pretty
[53:40] strong things but be honest if i i can
[53:43] share from my heart i like preaching a
[53:46] positive gospel amen we are believers
[53:49] now does that mean that we don't have
[53:51] little things we deal with well we'll
[53:53] get on that in a little bit because the
[53:55] devil would like you to believe every
[53:56] time you ever even scuff the toe that
[53:59] you have somehow backslid but we stand
[54:02] here knowing that we have a very
[54:04] positive gospel and god has come and he
[54:08] didn't wave oh i hope this don't sound
[54:11] kind of sacrilegious but uh uh you know
[54:15] sometimes you know little things just
[54:17] stir you and you know our little teddy
[54:19] dog if you have anything that resembles
[54:22] food in your hand he sits down and he
[54:25] can sit straight up and he just looks at
[54:28] you and says you're obligated to share
[54:30] with me
[54:34] but you'll never find the lord jesus
[54:35] christ holding your adoption paper over
[54:38] you
[54:39] beg
[54:41] come on beg
[54:43] it's not how god works
[54:45] he declared it in his word he says it's
[54:47] done and therefore it is finished and i
[54:50] will bring it to pass aren't you glad
[54:52] amen our adoption paper is not locked up
[54:54] in a box somewhere it's been revealed to
[54:56] us amen it's made so alive that we have
[55:00] come and even so much that we are
[55:02] desiring right the scripture is talking
[55:04] about a new name my brother and sister
[55:06] we're not here to preach on that this
[55:08] morning but i'm telling you it's become
[55:10] so real to us that we're longing for to
[55:13] the revelation as it were of that new
[55:15] name which it's not as complicated as
[55:18] some people like to turn it you know
[55:19] that you're going to look in the rock
[55:21] and you're going to be there but the
[55:22] real true bride now you go into three
[55:24] kinds of believers the prophet of god
[55:26] lays out i won't go into that because
[55:28] you're you're well aware of that but he
[55:30] lays out the atmosphere and the
[55:32] attributes of those people that will sit
[55:35] in the house of god and the devil would
[55:37] like to tell you today that you're
[55:38] probably make believer or unbeliever
[55:40] because maybe you've had some struggle
[55:42] in your life in the last day month year
[55:45] years
[55:46] but that's not how it god looks at it
[55:48] and so it's there the devil would come
[55:50] and try to anoint the believer to
[55:53] believe maybe he's just make believing
[55:54] this because i have great trials and
[55:56] i've had struggles and i've had failures
[55:58] but we're going to touch on that in a
[56:00] minute but you look at this and realize
[56:02] what god is doing he's bringing you here
[56:05] and he's causing you
[56:07] to press through
[56:09] this great
[56:10] cloud
[56:14] now
[56:15] you realize there's two clouds of
[56:17] witnesses
[56:20] amen the scripture because it's speaking
[56:22] in a positive sense
[56:24] doesn't talk about the cloud of witness
[56:28] of those demons
[56:30] released out of the river euphrates
[56:33] that all testify that you're lost
[56:36] all testify of your failure
[56:38] testify of your inabilities
[56:42] those are not the witnesses we're paying
[56:44] attention to saints
[56:46] but they're here
[56:49] and we can't just shoo them away leave
[56:51] me leave me they will come back at their
[56:54] opportune time
[56:56] right so they're looking at your life
[56:57] and they're saying now is a moment to
[56:59] put fear in them
[57:00] now is a moment to put doubt in them now
[57:03] is a moment to get them to look and
[57:05] realize that they have just stumbled
[57:10] and so that host of witnesses is present
[57:12] with us
[57:13] right the prophet of god preached on the
[57:15] two spirits in the framework of the
[57:17] christian church
[57:18] and praise the lord
[57:21] it was just real simple multiple choice
[57:24] the holy ghost
[57:26] or satan's anointing
[57:28] hallelujah just reach out on your touch
[57:30] screen which is right up here
[57:33] just reach out on your touch screen and
[57:35] say you know what satan i i just in my
[57:37] mind i refuse to accept
[57:40] and then we'll go a little further and
[57:42] go down into the soul realm or the heart
[57:44] realm and say absolutely without a doubt
[57:47] i don't accept
[57:49] and then just stand on that never move
[57:51] from it and the lord will take care of
[57:52] the rest
[57:55] now
[57:56] take this now
[57:59] in verse 3 speaking so
[58:02] positive here
[58:03] who hath blessed us
[58:06] blessed be the god and father of our
[58:08] lord jesus christ who hath blessed us
[58:11] and and i cut a bunch of stuff out today
[58:13] saints because it just can go on and on
[58:15] and on but the prophet of god says now
[58:17] look at this and when he says who hath
[58:20] blessed us he yeah brother branham says
[58:22] now now look at this that is past tense
[58:25] that is not something to be in the
[58:28] future something that might happen but
[58:30] god has already blessed you saints can
[58:33] you lift a hand and say thank you lord
[58:35] i'm already blessed
[58:37] amen now the problem is is people say
[58:39] where is this blessing now it's
[58:41] different that god has already given the
[58:43] blessing to you as to when he actually
[58:46] manifests it in your life
[58:48] so we're thinking that if god's already
[58:50] blessed me then that should be so
[58:53] evident right here right now of what
[58:55] this is but my brother and sister it is
[58:58] and and we'll refer to this again but in
[59:00] the stature of a perfect man you know i
[59:03] think what i'm going to do is build me
[59:04] an elevator and get from the bottom to
[59:07] the top in one easy step but it doesn't
[59:10] work that way you have to labor you have
[59:13] to press into and you have to lay claim
[59:16] to amen and then by the profession of
[59:20] your faith you are able to attain to
[59:22] these things now it's not just simply we
[59:25] see it we understand it that we could
[59:28] come and say okay now i'm going to just
[59:30] go and i'm going to start manifesting
[59:32] all of this and i'm ready for the camp
[59:34] stone
[59:35] no it's god who determines when we're
[59:37] ready for the capstone amen so we cannot
[59:40] so you look at that and realize now that
[59:43] we
[59:44] are already blessed and so if the word
[59:47] says it
[59:48] amen now just let me sidetrack a little
[59:50] bit something that spurred me today and
[59:52] i see now why it was now look at this
[59:54] this morning i'm there studying and i
[59:56] come across some things that brother
[59:58] branham said in the message and it
[1:00:00] stirred another thought which pushed a
[1:00:02] button and stirred another thought if
[1:00:03] you guys can follow me
[1:00:05] and i just go and turn on the computer
[1:00:07] and i type in there should a christian
[1:00:10] woman have long hair
[1:00:14] now we know what we believe right
[1:00:16] and we know why we believe it right we
[1:00:18] don't believe it because somebody just
[1:00:20] decided to preach it to us we believe it
[1:00:22] because it's the word
[1:00:24] and so it was interesting my brother and
[1:00:26] sister if you could ever just put in a
[1:00:29] whole bunch of bottle rockets in a big
[1:00:31] barrel and lie them all that's as
[1:00:33] scattered as the thoughts are concerning
[1:00:36] that people would take answers like well
[1:00:39] god loves us we can do what we want
[1:00:44] good good deal that's the devil's
[1:00:46] doctrine
[1:00:48] you just do what you want but you see
[1:00:50] the heart was never converted
[1:00:52] so the want is the want of the flesh so
[1:00:56] they may as well said just do whatever
[1:00:57] your flesh
[1:00:59] allows you to do
[1:01:01] all the way to and i told sister jerry
[1:01:03] this morning i said you know they might
[1:01:05] have been message or their pro
[1:01:06] pentecostal but one person a lady she
[1:01:09] she put it in this little forum she put
[1:01:11] it very clear
[1:01:13] she said if god said it
[1:01:17] just
[1:01:18] do it
[1:01:22] i like that right isn't it nike it's got
[1:01:25] to just do it
[1:01:26] well wonder they might have got that
[1:01:28] anointing out of something besides just
[1:01:30] some man's mind
[1:01:31] see if god said it just do it
[1:01:34] so it's there that when we are blessed
[1:01:36] my brother and sister you might as well
[1:01:39] can i be presumptuous this morning you
[1:01:41] might as well start lifting a hand up
[1:01:42] and start confessing i'm blessed
[1:01:45] i'm blessed huh i'm either got problems
[1:01:48] in my life i've got financial problems
[1:01:50] relation ships i don't know why no stop
[1:01:54] stop the word says you're blessed so
[1:01:58] let's speak the word
[1:02:00] amen and just start declaring i'm
[1:02:02] blessed the wheels fell off the car i'm
[1:02:04] blessed
[1:02:10] you see it's a past tense position
[1:02:13] and as i said already it does not really
[1:02:15] matter when god chooses to manifest it
[1:02:17] he's already given it to you so in the
[1:02:20] bank of heaven there is every blessing
[1:02:23] that you need every spiritual blessing
[1:02:26] is placed there and i would declare
[1:02:27] there's also every natural blessing
[1:02:31] oh i was so fortunate that this come
[1:02:33] along when it did
[1:02:37] i'm so blessed that god answered this
[1:02:39] prayer when he did
[1:02:42] you know what it is
[1:02:44] god's up there saying
[1:02:45] now's the season
[1:02:47] now's the need
[1:02:49] now's the time
[1:02:52] and we just think oh god heard my prayer
[1:02:54] and answered it the scripture tells us
[1:02:56] the answer is already on the way
[1:02:59] so you can choose to believe god got in
[1:03:01] a hurry frantic like you are
[1:03:05] and you know
[1:03:06] sent an angel by express
[1:03:08] i don't know roped a star
[1:03:11] grabbed the sun beam of light and
[1:03:13] hurried down and delivered it just in
[1:03:16] the nick of time
[1:03:21] that'd almost be like a santa claus
[1:03:23] story
[1:03:29] but you see
[1:03:32] we're blessed
[1:03:35] with all
[1:03:37] spiritual
[1:03:38] blessings
[1:03:40] now there's quite a few different
[1:03:42] definitions of the word all i mean three
[1:03:44] letters have you know multitude of
[1:03:46] definitions but my brother and sister
[1:03:48] all doesn't mean partial
[1:03:50] all doesn't mean something missing all
[1:03:52] doesn't need the necessary need to
[1:03:56] add
[1:03:57] all is a complete yes
[1:04:00] and he says we've been blessed with all
[1:04:02] spiritual blessings now my brother and
[1:04:04] sister we can sit here and i don't know
[1:04:06] maybe i'm different than you but uh we
[1:04:09] can sit here and and you know we can
[1:04:11] pray oh lord i need you to bless me here
[1:04:13] and bless you there but really you know
[1:04:15] what it is saints is god's just waiting
[1:04:17] on us
[1:04:18] that's way farther in my notes but we'll
[1:04:19] include it twice just to get it home and
[1:04:22] my brother and sister uh we're not
[1:04:24] waiting on the lord
[1:04:27] he's waiting on us
[1:04:30] and so it's a time and a season for us
[1:04:32] to come into this
[1:04:34] now we can look in natural studying and
[1:04:37] you know i researched some time back a
[1:04:39] deal you know young men or young people
[1:04:42] that become wealthy uh you know parents
[1:04:44] die in accidents and they inherited
[1:04:46] millions while they were still in their
[1:04:48] teens
[1:04:49] and there's very very few of those
[1:04:51] stories turn out to be a success story
[1:04:55] because usually they become overwhelmed
[1:04:58] caught up and lifted up in that position
[1:05:01] look through the bible
[1:05:02] and see the multitude of those kings who
[1:05:05] come into kingship as a child
[1:05:08] and how many of them carried through and
[1:05:10] served god
[1:05:12] there's only a handful that are
[1:05:14] referenced through scripture but you'll
[1:05:16] also find it's even smaller handful
[1:05:19] that were found faithful
[1:05:24] a lot of it you know what it was
[1:05:27] wasn't that the heart
[1:05:29] didn't want to
[1:05:31] they were given bad advice
[1:05:35] they prayed and they thought god was
[1:05:36] going to answer it in the morning
[1:05:40] they desired and they thought it should
[1:05:42] become to them in that time
[1:05:46] but those that waited on the lord
[1:05:49] you see they had a heritage that carried
[1:05:51] through and the scripture talks about
[1:05:53] how they were faithful
[1:05:55] just as their fathers were
[1:05:59] and some were not faithful
[1:06:02] as their fathers were
[1:06:05] you see it's all in the position that we
[1:06:08] would take
[1:06:10] you see because we either have to take
[1:06:12] the past tense and put it into the
[1:06:14] present tense or we will one start
[1:06:17] looking back
[1:06:18] and we will question it and if we are
[1:06:20] looking into the future tense as the
[1:06:22] saying goes we will miss what god is
[1:06:24] doing now so my brother and sister we
[1:06:27] stand here this morning knowing that we
[1:06:30] have received all spiritual blessings
[1:06:32] but i'm praying that the lord delivers
[1:06:35] them as it were in my life when it is
[1:06:38] necessary or maybe when i am mature
[1:06:40] enough to handle this right because a
[1:06:44] authority or power without character is
[1:06:47] satanic and so there we see many a
[1:06:50] person that has been caught up in these
[1:06:52] spirits because they got lifted up in
[1:06:54] their own revelation of the word they
[1:06:55] got lifted up in their own position and
[1:06:58] so you know if we are sitting here this
[1:07:00] morning the recipients of all spiritual
[1:07:03] blessings i want to ask you saints just
[1:07:06] if the devil's been bothering you
[1:07:08] what part is missing
[1:07:12] what could we this morning as believers
[1:07:14] of the message
[1:07:15] say is missing
[1:07:19] now you see satan will come and tell you
[1:07:22] because of a certain situation in your
[1:07:24] life there is something missing
[1:07:27] well satan just scrambled the words my
[1:07:29] brother and sister and turned it around
[1:07:31] in such a way and presented it back to
[1:07:32] you yeah there's something missing it's
[1:07:35] usually called a complete surrender
[1:07:38] see satan wants us to view that the
[1:07:40] message as it were the gospel of jesus
[1:07:43] christ is insufficient for your life
[1:07:46] and maybe even bring it back directly
[1:07:48] into the message insufficient for you
[1:07:57] just listening to a little clip the
[1:07:58] other day i'll just throw this out to
[1:07:59] you
[1:08:02] it's been talking about why they don't
[1:08:03] believe brother branham would be god's
[1:08:05] prophet because they had several
[1:08:07] instances of people prayed for and they
[1:08:09] felt so much better they walked and they
[1:08:11] did all this stuff but in a few days one
[1:08:13] man's wife nine days later she's dead
[1:08:16] she's in the grave and the man's like
[1:08:18] but the prophet said she was healed
[1:08:24] do you see what the equation is saints
[1:08:27] they put it all back to him
[1:08:30] he said she was healed it was right here
[1:08:33] in her hand
[1:08:36] to accept it
[1:08:39] come on now i can say this remember i
[1:08:41] told you about the preacher preaching
[1:08:43] things that he's done
[1:08:45] so thank you lord for healing
[1:08:48] some of you when we were back in the old
[1:08:49] church you you remember these things and
[1:08:52] then i get out the next morning and my
[1:08:53] knee
[1:08:54] hurts so bad
[1:08:56] i can't even walk
[1:08:58] and i'm like oh my am i going to live
[1:09:00] with this my whole life my needs been
[1:09:02] fixed by a doctor there's nothing else
[1:09:04] he can do
[1:09:06] oh my
[1:09:07] i can't imagine another you know 30
[1:09:09] years 40 years like this
[1:09:14] see how slippery the devil is
[1:09:16] he reached right in there healing
[1:09:19] is right here
[1:09:20] to be claimed
[1:09:22] deliverance is right here to be claimed
[1:09:25] revelation is right here to be claimed
[1:09:29] but we've got something else on the
[1:09:31] forefront of our mind something else
[1:09:33] that is the distraction and i'm
[1:09:35] distracted because i'm ahead of myself
[1:09:36] but look at this my brother and sister
[1:09:38] they come along and say couldn't be real
[1:09:40] declared my wife was healed and now nine
[1:09:43] days later she's in the grave
[1:09:48] i don't know
[1:09:51] what her position was
[1:09:55] but he obviously didn't believe
[1:10:00] you see we can't claim a promise my
[1:10:02] brother and sister
[1:10:04] while we disbelieve that very promise
[1:10:07] we not cannot claim these things of the
[1:10:09] gospel
[1:10:11] and then hedge our bet right remember
[1:10:13] brother brown talks about that that
[1:10:14] native in africa that come there and and
[1:10:17] he wants to know why are you carrying
[1:10:19] that what was that little
[1:10:22] little mud or something idol
[1:10:25] well just in case this god jesus
[1:10:30] can't defend me from the lion
[1:10:34] my daddy was carrying this
[1:10:36] when the lion came for him and he had
[1:10:39] this idol and he lit a fire
[1:10:41] and the lion left
[1:10:43] and they can't make the connection
[1:10:50] now i say this with a bit of humor
[1:10:52] because it's sad but
[1:10:57] his next time out in the bush
[1:11:00] and the lion come
[1:11:02] he better have some matches ready
[1:11:06] because his idol
[1:11:07] will not do one thing concerning that
[1:11:10] lion now my brother and sister we cannot
[1:11:14] say but i i prayed that god would heal
[1:11:16] me
[1:11:18] and then have
[1:11:19] a pocket full of matches
[1:11:22] are you with me
[1:11:24] and that's not going to work you either
[1:11:26] believe or you don't
[1:11:28] and i think in the age that we live in
[1:11:29] we have too many people that straddle
[1:11:31] the fence on this and they say well it's
[1:11:33] just natural for us as humans to be
[1:11:35] slightly skeptical my brother and sister
[1:11:38] i'm not natural human i am as i spoke to
[1:11:41] you earlier a son of god adopted i have
[1:11:45] the papers it shows who i am in fact it
[1:11:48] goes deeper than just the papers the dna
[1:11:51] of that blood flows through me now i i
[1:11:54] was gonna put this down this is not my
[1:11:57] original thought but it inspired me i
[1:11:59] was gonna put this in and i didn't but
[1:12:01] i'm gonna go ahead and say it i'm gonna
[1:12:02] tell you my brother and sister because i
[1:12:04] carry the dna you carry the dna of our
[1:12:08] lord jesus christ your blood will not
[1:12:11] mix with the devil
[1:12:14] there is no life
[1:12:16] in the devil for you
[1:12:22] and the blood
[1:12:23] carries the life
[1:12:25] it will not cross
[1:12:27] there is no serpent seed in us
[1:12:31] hallelujah
[1:12:33] now what would we say that we're without
[1:12:35] today my brother and sister we've
[1:12:36] encountered those that say well the the
[1:12:38] seventh seal
[1:12:40] ah i want to ask you i'm not going to
[1:12:42] argue with it the people who want to do
[1:12:43] that they can just go ahead and believe
[1:12:45] what they want but i just want to ask
[1:12:47] you a simple question did god put
[1:12:49] redemption on hold
[1:12:52] because the prophet said that the
[1:12:54] seventh seal the opening of the seventh
[1:12:56] seal was redemption to the bride so did
[1:12:59] god say well i opened up they caught a
[1:13:01] glimpse of it i'll put it on hold
[1:13:04] no sorry
[1:13:06] the mercy seat is on the heart of the
[1:13:08] believer and wherever the believers at
[1:13:10] the mercy seat is present
[1:13:13] and we'll tie that lord willing here in
[1:13:15] just a few minutes amen so we look at
[1:13:17] this
[1:13:18] i think what it is myself
[1:13:20] remember i preached an opinion here
[1:13:22] recently i'll share one with you
[1:13:24] i believe the problem that we're not see
[1:13:26] the thing that we're not seeing this or
[1:13:28] the problem that's present with us
[1:13:31] is that we're not in the right position
[1:13:34] my brother and sister remember what it
[1:13:36] was when they come and moses had tried
[1:13:38] to appease the people
[1:13:40] and it come down that joshua had learned
[1:13:42] his lesson right jehovah joshua
[1:13:47] and they said you know what we're just
[1:13:48] going to stay on this side of jordan
[1:13:52] it's a land of full of grass and and
[1:13:55] we're cattlemen
[1:13:57] joshua didn't say now well look uh we'll
[1:13:59] compromise build a bridge of jordan so
[1:14:01] you can come and go
[1:14:03] no he said you'll either cross over or
[1:14:06] you will die
[1:14:07] just like your father's
[1:14:10] now if we preach that way in message
[1:14:12] churches my brother and sister there'd
[1:14:13] be a whole lot less people in message
[1:14:15] churches because they want to build
[1:14:16] bridges
[1:14:18] the prophet of god said we're not
[1:14:20] wanting mixers we're wanting separators
[1:14:22] and if the word said depart out of that
[1:14:25] land get your feet and get the dust from
[1:14:27] your feet and go on then we don't want
[1:14:29] to say what lord i'd like to build a
[1:14:31] bridge now god was gracious to them and
[1:14:33] he allowed them after they fulfilled the
[1:14:35] word to come back and claim that land on
[1:14:39] that side of jordan but my brother and
[1:14:41] sister he didn't let them claim it in a
[1:14:43] spiritual sense it became an entirely
[1:14:46] natural gift of god to them
[1:14:49] no spiritual connection at all but they
[1:14:51] had to first fulfill the prophecy which
[1:14:54] was connected to the spiritual realm
[1:14:56] they had to fulfill that just like you
[1:14:58] and i
[1:14:59] hallelujah
[1:15:00] amen now i'll just throw this in for a
[1:15:02] little context for you to grab people
[1:15:04] say well i don't know about brother so
[1:15:06] and so he's got a lot of money he's
[1:15:07] worth a few million dollars of this that
[1:15:08] and the other and i just don't know
[1:15:10] about that you know my brother and
[1:15:12] sister i want you to catch this
[1:15:14] fulfill the portion of seek ye first the
[1:15:17] kingdom
[1:15:18] and all these other things were added to
[1:15:20] them reminds me when they had the fire
[1:15:22] in chile and it burned up all those
[1:15:24] believers homes i got a phone call from
[1:15:26] a brother in in canada and he said
[1:15:29] brother paul he said um look i want to
[1:15:31] help
[1:15:33] and i said well brother we're really
[1:15:35] close to our goal of what we need he
[1:15:36] says well i don't care about your goal
[1:15:38] the lord laid on my heart to help
[1:15:41] and then he told me how much money he
[1:15:43] wanted to send to chile and i was like
[1:15:44] wow that's as much money as we have
[1:15:46] already collected
[1:15:48] and the brother says now please keep
[1:15:50] this a secret.
[1:15:52] because nobody in my church
[1:15:55] knows that me and my sons have this kind
[1:15:57] of money
[1:16:00] i was like okay
[1:16:02] we fell into a lovely conversation
[1:16:05] and he says i
[1:16:06] i have proven the words that you cannot
[1:16:08] out give god
[1:16:10] i send money to every need that we hear
[1:16:13] about and i send and i don't send
[1:16:15] sparingly and then we come and and we
[1:16:19] bid on a project and and we win it and
[1:16:22] and there's like no one else bids and we
[1:16:24] just get it and we're so blessed that we
[1:16:27] we just do so well and so i say family
[1:16:30] we can give more and they give more and
[1:16:32] then he says i come and it comes again
[1:16:35] and we get blessed again and he said i
[1:16:37] can't out give god
[1:16:44] now the point i want to drive home to
[1:16:46] you
[1:16:47] what kind of life are they living that
[1:16:49] nobody in their church knows
[1:16:52] that they're worth millions
[1:16:57] simple humble godly
[1:16:59] priorities in order
[1:17:04] maybe god does know who to give the
[1:17:06] money to
[1:17:10] you see the thing that we have my
[1:17:12] brother and sister
[1:17:13] i think sometimes we're simply not in
[1:17:15] the position you say well i'd like the
[1:17:17] lord to do this and do that but we're
[1:17:19] not in the position to see
[1:17:21] or receive
[1:17:24] why
[1:17:25] no more than when my son
[1:17:28] when was he was 10 years old would i
[1:17:30] give him a pickup
[1:17:34] and just to these parents i'll throw
[1:17:36] this in right now anchor it in your
[1:17:38] reference
[1:17:39] make your children earn it
[1:17:42] you don't want your child squealing the
[1:17:44] tires and abusing the rig and jumping
[1:17:46] curbs and whatever else make him work
[1:17:48] hard for that
[1:17:52] you children that are coming up close to
[1:17:53] getting your driver's license i'm going
[1:17:55] to remind your parents over and over
[1:17:57] again you make them labor for that then
[1:18:00] they'll respect it
[1:18:02] now i want you to look at this what
[1:18:03] would we be if god just handed blessings
[1:18:05] out to us just random box fulls of
[1:18:07] blessings
[1:18:09] we wouldn't respect a single one of them
[1:18:12] but god knows how to bring us into a
[1:18:14] place
[1:18:15] so
[1:18:16] i i share that as a opinion that way you
[1:18:18] can just toss it if you want to but i'm
[1:18:20] wondering if it's just simply you know
[1:18:22] people say well i'm not seeing the
[1:18:23] blessings of god well you're probably
[1:18:25] not in the right position and you're not
[1:18:27] in the right maturity to receive that
[1:18:29] maybe as the prophet of god was speaking
[1:18:31] about that spring maybe god's still
[1:18:34] washing the clutter and the twigs and
[1:18:36] all the garbage out of you and you're
[1:18:38] not ready my brother and sister for that
[1:18:39] position now you see as i look at this
[1:18:42] and going back to the scripture i've
[1:18:44] looked through the word of god and i
[1:18:46] cannot find a single promise of these
[1:18:49] blessings to the believer that's in
[1:18:51] carnal places
[1:18:55] nowhere does he say you know what i'm
[1:18:57] going to do that in fact we can use a
[1:18:59] lot as an example
[1:19:00] imagine my brother and sister the
[1:19:02] difference if lot had said you know i
[1:19:03] think i want to stay up here on the
[1:19:05] plains of memory
[1:19:10] abram wouldn't have no choice but to go
[1:19:11] down
[1:19:13] to the well-watered lands
[1:19:17] of sodom
[1:19:20] but you see the blessing was given to
[1:19:23] abram
[1:19:25] abraham
[1:19:29] i imagine there had been a revival broke
[1:19:31] out down there on the plains of sodom
[1:19:35] and then it had been fire and brimstone
[1:19:37] and that all these all these carnal
[1:19:39] whatevers that were there in this city
[1:19:42] would it would have had to have departed
[1:19:44] they couldn't have stayed there with the
[1:19:45] word in their midst
[1:19:47] but you see you see the very nature that
[1:19:49] was in sodom was a nature that was
[1:19:51] calling out to lot and lot was attracted
[1:19:55] to sodom he could see the neon signs
[1:19:59] from up here
[1:20:03] i don't know have any of you ever topped
[1:20:04] out
[1:20:05] highway 95
[1:20:07] or 95 93 i mean
[1:20:10] and have you ever topped out highway 93
[1:20:12] north of las vegas
[1:20:15] when you top the rise
[1:20:18] it's just a glow
[1:20:21] you still have 90 miles to drive
[1:20:27] lot was up there
[1:20:29] with abraham
[1:20:31] and he could see the glow of sodom and
[1:20:33] he says i want to know the glow
[1:20:36] and abraham says i've got enough
[1:20:38] right here in my heart that's already
[1:20:40] got me lit up
[1:20:42] i don't need a las vegas
[1:20:45] i don't need a sodom
[1:20:47] but look how gracious god was there was
[1:20:50] enough there oh i'm so distracted excuse
[1:20:52] me but look there was enough there that
[1:20:55] when lot was in his position god sent a
[1:20:58] messenger to him and said come up to the
[1:21:01] mountain
[1:21:02] come up to the mountain there's a light
[1:21:04] on the mountain come up to the mountain
[1:21:06] and what was lot's answer
[1:21:08] i can't go i'm afraid
[1:21:12] we've got no reason to be afraid of the
[1:21:13] holy ghost saints come on if the devil's
[1:21:15] got you shook up and you're afraid of a
[1:21:17] complete surrender to our lord jesus
[1:21:19] christ then i ask you get down and pray
[1:21:22] through we have no reason to be afraid
[1:21:26] of giving our whole heart mind soul and
[1:21:28] body to the lord jesus christ that's the
[1:21:30] devil saying oh you might have to give
[1:21:32] up this and repent from this and do this
[1:21:35] and do that my brother and sister it's
[1:21:37] the devil is the author of fear
[1:21:40] and if you wonder who's the god of this
[1:21:42] evil age you go on any continent in any
[1:21:44] place and fear is running rampant right
[1:21:47] now
[1:21:49] amen people are afraid
[1:21:52] hallelujah
[1:21:53] my bible says these things have to come
[1:21:55] before i get out of here
[1:21:57] amen let it come then lord
[1:22:00] so look at that see
[1:22:01] we look for spiritual blessings my
[1:22:04] brother and sister not in carnal places
[1:22:09] in heavenly places
[1:22:13] now i don't think we have a real problem
[1:22:14] in our church
[1:22:16] i still feel compelled to preach it
[1:22:19] if you tell me
[1:22:21] you don't have enough time in your life
[1:22:25] to come to church
[1:22:27] i'm going to be obligated to tell you
[1:22:29] you're deceived
[1:22:32] we don't have enough time left in this
[1:22:34] world to not be in the house of god
[1:22:38] not that well you know i have this i
[1:22:40] have that well my job brother paul well
[1:22:42] why don't you pray for a promotion
[1:22:45] demotion
[1:22:46] or god put you in motion to go get
[1:22:49] another one
[1:22:52] come on it's too short of time saints
[1:22:56] besides that we're teaching our children
[1:22:58] priorities
[1:23:02] lord help us
[1:23:04] see now look what what's happened
[1:23:06] satan's misdirection
[1:23:08] i thought this was a kind of a lovely
[1:23:10] thought satan's misdirection
[1:23:13] reminds me one time a little story i
[1:23:15] read
[1:23:16] how these guys down south america had
[1:23:18] set up a little robbery ring this was
[1:23:20] not that far in the past
[1:23:26] people fly into the international
[1:23:28] airport in buenos aires
[1:23:31] and they walk out on the curb and they
[1:23:32] say taxi
[1:23:35] they get in the taxi they tell them i i
[1:23:37] want to go
[1:23:38] here
[1:23:41] the taxi leaves out gets on the
[1:23:42] interstate takes an exit the people say
[1:23:44] uh where are we going he says oh this is
[1:23:46] a better route
[1:23:50] now i hope my humor doesn't offend
[1:23:52] anyone
[1:23:53] they usually would find these people
[1:23:55] alive and well
[1:23:57] in their underwear
[1:23:59] walking on the highway back to the city
[1:24:03] because you see they were misdirected
[1:24:04] and taken out and the taxi driver
[1:24:07] delivered them
[1:24:08] as it were to the den of thieves
[1:24:13] now the government argentina don't
[1:24:15] really care about you as an american so
[1:24:17] much so hey if you're healthy
[1:24:21] they're not even going to investigate
[1:24:23] go look for your empty suitcase they're
[1:24:25] not going to try and figure out who this
[1:24:26] is
[1:24:27] but they will tell you um next time
[1:24:30] make sure you know who's taking you
[1:24:33] to the city
[1:24:35] hallelujah
[1:24:37] there's a city
[1:24:39] on mount zion
[1:24:42] hallelujah i've got a certain guide
[1:24:45] to deliver me to that city and it's not
[1:24:48] this ministry or that ministry it's the
[1:24:51] holy ghost
[1:24:52] hallelujah so what do we do we seek
[1:24:54] direction not of the council of men
[1:24:57] although god uses men but of the counsel
[1:25:00] of the holy ghost is what brings us into
[1:25:03] that full assurance of our position so
[1:25:06] satan tries to
[1:25:08] misdirect mentally
[1:25:10] anybody ever have a mental battle
[1:25:15] you know your own little daisy
[1:25:17] god loves me
[1:25:19] god loves me not god loves me god loves
[1:25:21] me not god loves me god loves me not
[1:25:24] nope get another daisy
[1:25:32] well it was important enough the prophet
[1:25:33] of god preached greatest battle ever
[1:25:35] fought
[1:25:36] right so we can laugh about that and
[1:25:38] we'd say well i it was important enough
[1:25:40] the prophet of god come and dealt with
[1:25:42] that
[1:25:43] now look what satan's stated position
[1:25:46] interact with me if you want to what
[1:25:47] what is satan's stated position
[1:25:54] he's a deceiver
[1:25:57] now
[1:25:58] in that we could take the context
[1:26:00] deceiver liar et cetera
[1:26:02] but the scripture also calls him a thief
[1:26:07] and what he's doing is he's trying to
[1:26:09] steal your inheritance
[1:26:12] now your name is already in god's word
[1:26:15] amen it's already laid out these
[1:26:17] promises are yours but satan's trying to
[1:26:20] steal your inheritance that you actually
[1:26:23] will then spiritually live like a pauper
[1:26:26] after all you have no money you have no
[1:26:28] future you have no blessing
[1:26:32] the word says you've already been given
[1:26:34] all the blessings
[1:26:36] satan comes and tries to steal all the
[1:26:38] blessing so that while you remain
[1:26:40] believing in jesus christ you live like
[1:26:44] a spiritual pauper
[1:26:48] because you don't really believe you can
[1:26:49] overcome
[1:26:50] that issue in your life
[1:26:52] now saints i would never ask you to no
[1:26:54] more than i would myself want to
[1:26:57] but if we were to start
[1:26:59] declaring
[1:27:02] those things that are the thorn in our
[1:27:03] flesh
[1:27:06] you know what i'm talking about
[1:27:08] every one of us would have something
[1:27:10] we'd say this is the thorn in my flesh
[1:27:13] and i would for the sake of conversation
[1:27:16] ask you
[1:27:17] is that not covered in the word
[1:27:24] and i believe the answer from you would
[1:27:25] be yes it's covered in the word
[1:27:28] then we have to ask ourselves why is
[1:27:30] this a thorn
[1:27:32] i already have
[1:27:34] deliverance
[1:27:35] healing
[1:27:36] and restoration
[1:27:38] i already have it
[1:27:40] why is this still a thorn
[1:27:44] because we either have allowed satan to
[1:27:46] keep us out of position
[1:27:54] or he's so clouded our mind
[1:27:57] that we think
[1:27:59] that can't be for me
[1:28:01] that's too glorious that's too beautiful
[1:28:04] that's too supernatural that's two
[1:28:07] that's two that's two
[1:28:12] now when satan stole that from you
[1:28:15] did that really mean he got it
[1:28:19] no sir i would be taking a little bit
[1:28:21] liberty with it but the prophet of god
[1:28:23] said you know if satan come in under the
[1:28:25] blood he'd be your brother
[1:28:28] so he's not really stealing that
[1:28:30] blessing from you he's just keeping you
[1:28:33] from getting to it because he really
[1:28:35] doesn't he handles the word
[1:28:38] but he handles it in a deceptive fashion
[1:28:41] so he never really wants to get a hold
[1:28:43] of the supernatural word even though
[1:28:46] satan operates in that impersonation of
[1:28:48] the supernatural he doesn't really want
[1:28:50] the true word my brother and sister
[1:28:52] because the true word brings repentance
[1:28:55] and let me drive this home the true word
[1:28:58] brings repentance and when people say oh
[1:29:01] i'm in the message i believe the message
[1:29:03] where's the repentance
[1:29:05] you say but i'm a believer i'm a
[1:29:07] believer well we'll touch on this in a
[1:29:08] quote in just a minute amen now look his
[1:29:11] stated position to keep you from your
[1:29:13] inheritance to keep you
[1:29:16] on the bottom rung of a spiritual ladder
[1:29:19] if he can keep you from climbing up that
[1:29:21] now look i know this is a little awkward
[1:29:23] for me to bring this out this way but
[1:29:25] they did research my brother and sister
[1:29:27] and they took and hung a banana up in
[1:29:30] the top of a cage a monkey cage they
[1:29:33] hung a banana up there and um then they
[1:29:36] took the rope that led up to the ma to
[1:29:39] the bananas and they made that when the
[1:29:42] monkey got up within a certain distance
[1:29:45] of the bananas they shocked him
[1:29:49] almost sounds cruel doesn't it but they
[1:29:52] were proving a point and well
[1:29:55] it's a good point spiritually also
[1:29:58] so after they had shocked this monkey
[1:30:01] enough
[1:30:02] he no longer
[1:30:04] climbed the rope to try to get the
[1:30:07] banana
[1:30:09] then they introduced another
[1:30:11] member in the church i mean another
[1:30:13] monkey
[1:30:16] and that monkey went
[1:30:18] that's a banana guys why don't you go
[1:30:20] get the banana
[1:30:21] and the other monkey is like
[1:30:24] if you know the story of my life
[1:30:27] if you knew what i've gone through
[1:30:30] you would understand why i don't try to
[1:30:33] get the blessings i mean the banana
[1:30:38] and the other monkey would start to
[1:30:39] climb the rope
[1:30:42] to get the banana
[1:30:45] and they no longer had to shock them
[1:30:47] because the first monkey would jump on
[1:30:50] that monkey and drag him down to the
[1:30:53] ground and no doubt gave him a speech
[1:30:55] about how you have no rights
[1:30:57] to take that banana
[1:30:59] then they introduced the third monkey
[1:31:02] and the fourth
[1:31:03] and the fifth
[1:31:05] the sixth seventh eighth ninth tenth
[1:31:10] and then to prove that the research was
[1:31:12] not flawed they cleared all the monkeys
[1:31:14] out
[1:31:15] hung a fresh banana put a new monkey in
[1:31:18] the cage and didn't do anything and that
[1:31:20] monkey went up there ripped that banana
[1:31:23] off there climbed over on a perch peeled
[1:31:25] that thing and ate it
[1:31:28] oh god let this old creed and traditions
[1:31:30] just die
[1:31:32] let those spirits that would come and
[1:31:33] tell us the supernatural is finished
[1:31:36] that you've went too far that you're too
[1:31:38] weak and it's not for you and it's not
[1:31:41] for you and mother you can't pray for
[1:31:43] your baby you have to have the pastor
[1:31:46] nonsense my brother and sister we need
[1:31:49] to get the old monkeys as it were out of
[1:31:52] the church and we need to introduce a
[1:31:54] fresh spirit in the church that we would
[1:31:58] realize that promise of god has already
[1:32:01] been given to me and i don't care what
[1:32:03] you think i'll fight you over it
[1:32:06] and then if you fight him over it
[1:32:09] they call you
[1:32:10] anti-christian
[1:32:12] unmessage-like
[1:32:14] and have no love
[1:32:16] well it's because i love the word more
[1:32:18] than i love you
[1:32:20] but the word will compel me to love you
[1:32:24] i might have to do it at a distance
[1:32:26] though
[1:32:27] and i might have to love you in my
[1:32:28] prayers
[1:32:31] because
[1:32:33] one says the monkeys i mean the banana
[1:32:35] is mine and the other says
[1:32:37] no no that's for the ministry only
[1:32:42] that's for them over there only
[1:32:46] are we doing okay
[1:32:48] amen so satan wants to keep you at the
[1:32:50] bottom of the spiritual ladder
[1:32:52] now don't lift your hands i don't
[1:32:54] embarrass no one
[1:32:55] but maybe a little mm-hmm to yourself
[1:32:58] any of you ever been kicked back to the
[1:33:00] bottom room
[1:33:02] amen i'll tell you what i'll do i'll
[1:33:04] lift my hand for every one of us because
[1:33:05] if we're fighting a true fight of faith
[1:33:08] we've been kicked back to the bottom
[1:33:09] rung and we thought i ain't even a
[1:33:11] christian
[1:33:13] i ain't even a christian because a real
[1:33:15] christian would never have done that
[1:33:17] well praise the lord let's just go right
[1:33:19] here in hebrews chapter six part two
[1:33:23] ah
[1:33:24] brother david told me a while back i
[1:33:25] can't say cherry pick no more but you
[1:33:28] know what it is when you pick them
[1:33:29] luscious little fruits right out in the
[1:33:30] middle of the tree you didn't pick all
[1:33:32] of them over here and all of them over
[1:33:33] there you just saw one that was hanging
[1:33:35] out there that looked bigger and juicier
[1:33:36] than the rest and you picked him and
[1:33:38] that's kind of what i'm doing
[1:33:42] the problem of god
[1:33:44] the prophet of god says right here in
[1:33:46] hebrews chapter six part two
[1:33:49] i don't act clean and pure and holy to
[1:33:51] make myself a christian
[1:33:55] oh we can try doing that have you ever
[1:33:57] tried doing that when i first started
[1:33:58] coming back to the lord and you know i
[1:34:01] i've done a lot of stupid things in my
[1:34:03] life i started coming back to the lord
[1:34:05] god gave me a godly wife she's like i'm
[1:34:07] going to take the children i'm going to
[1:34:08] serve lord paul kind of no matter what
[1:34:11] you do
[1:34:12] but i want to do it with you
[1:34:14] and so i started kind of cleaning up my
[1:34:16] my act and cleaning up my thoughts and
[1:34:18] cleaning up my deal and and you know
[1:34:20] cause before that i used to lie to my
[1:34:22] wife
[1:34:25] and tell her i had to work on sunday
[1:34:28] then i'd go work on sunday and help him
[1:34:30] feed and
[1:34:31] then i'd be done
[1:34:33] feeding we were feeding about 30 000
[1:34:35] head of cows and i'd be done feeding
[1:34:37] about the time church started so it was
[1:34:38] just too late for me to go
[1:34:42] praise the lord
[1:34:43] like those people who set their alarm at
[1:34:45] 10 15.
[1:34:48] and they say i i would have came today
[1:34:49] but i just i would be late
[1:34:52] come on don't lie to yourself no lie to
[1:34:54] everybody else amen all you got to do is
[1:34:56] take the old alarm clock and turn him
[1:34:58] back to about 6 15
[1:35:00] and no matter how slow you go at that
[1:35:02] point you'll make it
[1:35:08] i don't act clean and pure and holy make
[1:35:10] myself a christian
[1:35:12] but christ
[1:35:14] in me
[1:35:16] not next to me not in the car not in the
[1:35:19] house
[1:35:20] amen my wife being a good christian is
[1:35:22] kind of going to rub off on me and when
[1:35:24] we get there i'm going to say look you
[1:35:25] know this word says that we're one flesh
[1:35:28] and she lived godly and i just lived and
[1:35:31] so
[1:35:34] don't i get in for free
[1:35:36] no
[1:35:37] but christ in me
[1:35:39] lives that in me
[1:35:41] now we'll i'll expand on this not now
[1:35:44] because i'm going to be too long right
[1:35:45] now anyway but we'll expand this as we
[1:35:47] go into these other these other uh
[1:35:49] verses other chapters in future dates
[1:35:52] here my brother and sister you see
[1:35:53] because one of those if you just want to
[1:35:55] cheat and go read those
[1:35:59] said he makes us
[1:36:01] to live in heavenly places
[1:36:05] trevor cox
[1:36:07] you
[1:36:08] will
[1:36:09] live in heavenly places
[1:36:15] wouldn't work would it
[1:36:17] sorry because we have this old flesh
[1:36:20] but look at this now
[1:36:22] but christ in me lives that in me
[1:36:26] you know what that is when you get in
[1:36:28] the scripture and really go dig down
[1:36:29] into that you'll find that it's making
[1:36:32] you
[1:36:33] what's on the inside is making the
[1:36:35] outside conform to what's living on the
[1:36:38] inside amen and so it's there that it
[1:36:42] lives that in me and i love him
[1:36:44] and if i do anything wrong it condemns
[1:36:47] me
[1:36:49] oh but look at this now people be i'll
[1:36:50] tell you i could name their names right
[1:36:52] now write out loud but that wouldn't be
[1:36:54] fair and right
[1:36:56] not christian
[1:36:58] no people would say whoa stop right
[1:37:00] there see if you did this without it
[1:37:02] saying that brother branham said it and
[1:37:04] you said oh i do wrong it condemns me
[1:37:06] they jump all over you the holy spirit
[1:37:08] does not condemn a believer it convicts
[1:37:11] him
[1:37:13] okay
[1:37:14] good
[1:37:15] read it your way
[1:37:19] and if i do anything wrong it condemns
[1:37:21] me
[1:37:22] now look at just
[1:37:24] the basic definition
[1:37:26] of condemn
[1:37:29] is
[1:37:29] censor
[1:37:32] or express disapproval
[1:37:37] oh
[1:37:40] amen who's been censored this last week
[1:37:42] [Laughter]
[1:37:44] and who's going to say thank you lord
[1:37:45] for censoring me amen and to those
[1:37:49] people who have such an high and mighty
[1:37:51] thoughts my brother and sister you know
[1:37:53] look right here he said and if i do
[1:37:55] anything wrong it condemns me right
[1:37:57] there i'll say now brother branham's not
[1:37:59] talking about you you you he's talking
[1:38:02] about himself and he says right there
[1:38:05] i'll say god forgive me every day i got
[1:38:08] to ask forgiveness every day and you do
[1:38:12] too
[1:38:13] certainly you do
[1:38:14] so the prophet brought himself right
[1:38:16] down out of some people's supernatural
[1:38:19] stratosphere and put him right down and
[1:38:21] the prophet of god is telling us that
[1:38:23] every day i'm saying lord forgive me
[1:38:27] every day something touching his life
[1:38:30] that is lord forgive me and i tell you
[1:38:33] what that does it gives me a great bit
[1:38:35] of joy because i never pass a day of my
[1:38:38] life but what i find myself saying lord
[1:38:40] forgive me for that action for that
[1:38:42] speech for that thought that behavior
[1:38:44] lord forgive me
[1:38:46] and then after a while you come back and
[1:38:48] you're like my i'm just so repetitive
[1:38:50] about this
[1:38:53] well
[1:38:54] you have encouragement to be repetitive
[1:38:57] you've got encouragement to never let
[1:38:59] your day go by but what you stop and say
[1:39:01] lord forgive me for the weakness of my
[1:39:04] flesh and thoughts and actions and
[1:39:06] emotions and whatever it might be
[1:39:08] hallelujah amen because you see god
[1:39:12] is not wanting you to act like a
[1:39:14] christian he wants you to be a christian
[1:39:17] amen now obviously there's something
[1:39:20] that happens uh in our lives that we
[1:39:22] just start acting like
[1:39:24] christians but see
[1:39:27] let me just turn a corner here
[1:39:29] the devil would like to come along
[1:39:32] okay everybody stop
[1:39:34] now don't fall asleep if you're tired
[1:39:36] just close your eyes
[1:39:38] and think about the last thing
[1:39:40] you ask the lord to forgive you for
[1:39:47] and the devil will come along
[1:39:50] and say that's why you
[1:39:52] can't live in heavenly places
[1:39:56] that's the reason you'll never be an
[1:39:58] overcomer
[1:39:59] that's the reason you cannot be
[1:40:03] what the word said
[1:40:08] someone say amen
[1:40:09] i don't think i missed the mark very far
[1:40:12] amen
[1:40:14] you see what it is is satan like to give
[1:40:16] you idea you can't live in heavenly
[1:40:18] places but the word says
[1:40:21] the word says
[1:40:22] can somebody repeat that with me the
[1:40:25] word says
[1:40:28] hallelujah
[1:40:29] that i've already received spiritual
[1:40:32] blessings
[1:40:34] in heavenly places
[1:40:36] amen the limiting factor will be my
[1:40:39] ability to die
[1:40:44] i don't die
[1:40:45] i cannot receive those blessings because
[1:40:48] god's not going to bless us with a
[1:40:50] carnal spirit
[1:40:52] he blesses us with the holy spirit
[1:40:56] so satan holding you down
[1:40:58] now remember that song we sing sometimes
[1:41:00] satan had me bound
[1:41:02] but jesus set me free
[1:41:04] look i'm telling my brother and sister
[1:41:06] this message is a message of liberation
[1:41:08] this is not a message for us to sit in
[1:41:10] church and be living under condemnation
[1:41:13] of days gone by if you still have that
[1:41:16] you either need to tell the devil he's a
[1:41:18] liar or you need to get it under the
[1:41:20] blood for sure and both of those you can
[1:41:22] do right now
[1:41:24] you don't need a confession booth you
[1:41:26] don't need a month or six months or a
[1:41:28] year you can do that before you walk out
[1:41:31] of here and then we'll put the devil
[1:41:33] right back where he belongs and put him
[1:41:35] as the scripture says under our feet
[1:41:39] hallelujah
[1:41:41] no longer just going through life beaten
[1:41:43] down beaten down beaten down it's time
[1:41:46] my brother and sister for us to claim
[1:41:48] our liberty
[1:41:50] amen
[1:41:51] hallelujah the lord is our liberation
[1:41:55] the word brings liberty
[1:41:57] you know what heavenly places is not a
[1:41:59] feeling
[1:42:07] yeah
[1:42:09] it's not a feeling
[1:42:10] i like that feeling
[1:42:12] of liberation though
[1:42:14] i love that feeling when the holy
[1:42:16] spirit's moving
[1:42:18] you know
[1:42:20] i was just telling brother jay
[1:42:21] i'll just make my little rose public
[1:42:24] i was blessed by the song service on
[1:42:25] wednesday night
[1:42:27] i come to church
[1:42:29] oh my
[1:42:30] do i just go ahead and tell you all the
[1:42:32] things that i'm concerned about and i'm
[1:42:34] praying about
[1:42:36] well i probably shouldn't it embarrassed
[1:42:38] some of you
[1:42:40] but i just felt under a great burden i
[1:42:42] come to church wednesday night in the
[1:42:43] song service
[1:42:45] all of a sudden we're just not hardly a
[1:42:47] song into the song service i literally
[1:42:50] felt a weight lift off of me
[1:42:53] and i felt myself just i just wanted to
[1:42:55] worship the lord and then brother chris
[1:42:57] comes out it was brother chris wasn't it
[1:42:59] i can't remember it seems like a month
[1:43:01] ago
[1:43:02] brother chris comes out
[1:43:04] just starts preaching laying the word
[1:43:06] out there
[1:43:07] and i walked out of church just feeling
[1:43:09] mighty fine
[1:43:11] hallelujah
[1:43:13] amen
[1:43:14] hallelujah it wasn't it wasn't brother
[1:43:16] jay it wasn't brother chris it was god
[1:43:18] said you know what i don't want you to
[1:43:20] walk out of here i've got a message that
[1:43:23] brings liberty
[1:43:24] i don't want you finding some post and
[1:43:26] putting your ear on it and say i'm just
[1:43:28] going to be bound the rest of my life
[1:43:30] i'm just going to serve my mistakes
[1:43:33] oh you know that's what a lot of people
[1:43:34] are doing
[1:43:35] come on saints i'm telling you the truth
[1:43:38] this morning you're not serving god
[1:43:41] you're serving your mistakes
[1:43:43] and hoping god will forgive you of your
[1:43:46] mistakes
[1:43:47] wrong interpretation of the word
[1:43:50] you put it in sincerity under the blood
[1:43:52] and he said i will forgive you
[1:43:55] now the prophet of god when he told the
[1:43:57] story about the ink and the bleach he
[1:43:59] didn't say now some of you will have
[1:44:01] sins that the blood can't dissolve
[1:44:05] no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[1:44:09] bleach doesn't work on bic ink
[1:44:14] no i'm telling you the bleach works on
[1:44:16] all ink
[1:44:18] the blood works on all sin
[1:44:21] hallelujah
[1:44:23] you see heavenly places is not a feeling
[1:44:25] saints
[1:44:26] and it's not a declaration of doctrine
[1:44:35] what do you think church we self-publish
[1:44:37] our own
[1:44:40] creed why do they call them books that
[1:44:42] people they have in them churches
[1:44:43] brother david you know where they have
[1:44:45] all the rules and bylaws and all of
[1:44:46] their um it's just far from my mind but
[1:44:50] you guys know what i'm talking about
[1:44:52] should we
[1:44:53] kind of their creed yeah
[1:44:55] should we publish one of those do we do
[1:44:57] we need one of those around here
[1:44:59] or
[1:45:00] can we just from our heart accept this
[1:45:03] one
[1:45:05] and then we'll take the holy spirit on
[1:45:07] our life and we'll sign as it were that
[1:45:09] page in heaven
[1:45:11] it says lord i believe your word
[1:45:14] i believe your word you see the problem
[1:45:16] is when man got interjected in there
[1:45:17] satan said now if i can keep them down
[1:45:19] here at the level of the church
[1:45:21] come on saints
[1:45:22] if i can keep them down here at the
[1:45:24] level of the church they'll feel really
[1:45:26] good
[1:45:27] i'm going to church and i'm feeling
[1:45:29] mighty fine
[1:45:30] everybody's going to see this new suit
[1:45:32] of mine
[1:45:33] but if they really saw me from time to
[1:45:35] time
[1:45:36] they would know this suit and i
[1:45:40] are not saved
[1:45:44] because it's never going to be a
[1:45:45] relationship between you and the church
[1:45:48] it's not a relationship between you and
[1:45:50] a preacher a denomination it's going to
[1:45:52] be hello in the carnal interpretation
[1:45:56] not going to be a relationship between
[1:45:57] you and the message
[1:46:00] that's why i insist saints that when we
[1:46:03] talk about the message
[1:46:05] we recognize that is jesus christ
[1:46:12] now in some parts of the country you
[1:46:14] crucified for that and i don't mean
[1:46:15] anything out of that my brother and
[1:46:17] sister but let's just mark it for what
[1:46:19] it is that when we have our vocabulary
[1:46:21] and we're talking about the message and
[1:46:23] the message changed my life then you
[1:46:26] could say
[1:46:27] jesus christ changed my life we can put
[1:46:30] that as an interchangeable thing but if
[1:46:33] you literally mean it well i can go
[1:46:35] introduce you this afternoon right now
[1:46:37] drive you up to a man that tells you the
[1:46:38] baptist church changed his life
[1:46:41] and we'd be no different
[1:46:43] if we don't recognize this message is
[1:46:45] jesus christ
[1:46:48] so what is it
[1:46:49] it's a spiritual position in jesus
[1:46:51] christ that's heavenly places
[1:46:53] my brother and sister we cannot say we
[1:46:55] are filled with the holy ghost and live
[1:46:58] under a cloud of depression all the time
[1:47:01] that cloud might come and that cloud
[1:47:03] might go and circumstances of life come
[1:47:05] and they go but if you never found
[1:47:08] liberty my brother and sister i
[1:47:09] encourage you to go back and get to the
[1:47:12] altar and ask god to reveal the real
[1:47:14] truth of the message because jesus
[1:47:16] christ never bound the people don't go
[1:47:19] through he bound spirits but he never
[1:47:21] bound the people he set the people free
[1:47:24] and bound the spirit
[1:47:27] and that's what we want in this church
[1:47:28] can we say amen we don't want to bind
[1:47:31] people we don't have rules and we're
[1:47:33] going to dictate to you what to do here
[1:47:35] and to do there my brother and sister we
[1:47:37] want the spirit broken
[1:47:40] did you know if people actually
[1:47:41] recognized the spirits of this age a lot
[1:47:44] of these things they dabble around in
[1:47:46] they'd never touch it
[1:47:48] if god pulled the veil from their eyes
[1:47:50] and they realized this good friend who
[1:47:52] influences me
[1:47:55] is the devil
[1:47:58] and you say brother paul that's kind of
[1:47:59] harsh but look if they're keeping you
[1:48:02] from the word
[1:48:03] and influencing you against the word
[1:48:06] that's a demonic spirit
[1:48:09] but if you recognize the spirit i think
[1:48:11] a lot of these things people dabble in
[1:48:14] had a brother tell me here recently
[1:48:17] he said i was so discouraged brother
[1:48:18] paul
[1:48:20] he said
[1:48:21] one of my children
[1:48:23] was looking at some deal on the internet
[1:48:24] and said dad i think you probably ought
[1:48:26] to look at this
[1:48:29] this whole group of message kids
[1:48:31] belonging to this little forum
[1:48:34] debating the merits
[1:48:36] of pop rock and whatever they call all
[1:48:39] of that stuff
[1:48:42] come on young people
[1:48:44] have courage enough to stand up and say
[1:48:46] that's not of god
[1:48:48] that's not of god that'll take a soul to
[1:48:50] hell right there and it won't be my soul
[1:48:53] because i'll get away from that because
[1:48:55] i recognize as it is the old proverbial
[1:48:57] then there's somebody there with a
[1:48:59] forked tail pitchfork and horns
[1:49:02] we wouldn't touch it with a 50-foot pole
[1:49:05] after we've seen that
[1:49:06] god help us look i want to put it to you
[1:49:08] right here
[1:49:09] pray that god opens your eyes to the
[1:49:12] spirits of your situation
[1:49:15] pray that god opens your eyes so you can
[1:49:17] see what the anointings are around you
[1:49:20] amen i was reading a little deal a
[1:49:23] minister not him nothing to do with the
[1:49:24] message
[1:49:25] and he says it's strange
[1:49:28] the harder you try to help people
[1:49:31] the more they fight you
[1:49:35] we're here to help not to hurt
[1:49:39] but they can't
[1:49:40] tell
[1:49:41] the difference amen right oh my so you
[1:49:44] didn't condemn the person that's right
[1:49:47] amen
[1:49:48] now we sang a song and i can't remember
[1:49:50] the name of that song but i got all
[1:49:52] excited hope you all don't mind i hope
[1:49:54] you didn't leave your your
[1:49:56] food cooking on the cooktop there
[1:49:59] because it's probably going to burn
[1:50:02] praise the lord
[1:50:04] come on amen
[1:50:08] because this quote here
[1:50:10] is a whopper
[1:50:12] of a quote it's an 18-wheeler
[1:50:16] amen we might have to get brother sergey
[1:50:18] to go to his truck to haul this quote
[1:50:19] away
[1:50:20] but look at this
[1:50:22] and elijah had been up on mark mount
[1:50:24] carmel for a long time god been feeding
[1:50:26] him by the ravens and finally there come
[1:50:28] a time where god was preparing that man
[1:50:30] for a great outstanding miracle and he
[1:50:32] called all israel together and thought
[1:50:34] surely if they could see the
[1:50:36] supernatural hand of god
[1:50:38] move they would believe that god was god
[1:50:41] now look we just had some preaching
[1:50:43] dealing right on this subject put every
[1:50:45] stone in the right place no cut stones
[1:50:48] it's got to be built right and when you
[1:50:50] come you can call on bail
[1:50:52] all you want
[1:50:55] is he sleeping
[1:50:56] maybe he's gone he's over here he's busy
[1:50:59] you're on call waiting
[1:51:03] call israel supernatural hand of god
[1:51:05] move that they would believe that god
[1:51:06] was god for the nation was polluted with
[1:51:08] a backslidden king ahab and wicked
[1:51:10] adulteress jezebel
[1:51:12] and they brought the nation under
[1:51:14] idolatry and it was breaking the heart
[1:51:16] of this servant of god and do you know
[1:51:19] as i said the other night people we
[1:51:21] better check up on our experience for
[1:51:23] the holy ghost is only going to anoint
[1:51:26] in the last days those who sigh and cry
[1:51:29] for the abomination that's did in the
[1:51:31] city
[1:51:32] you see the problem we have around the
[1:51:34] message
[1:51:35] is we just kick dust at them
[1:51:43] you just keep kicking dust and i'm not
[1:51:45] saying this belligerently you just keep
[1:51:47] kicking dust and wait and see what kind
[1:51:49] of attitude you end up with
[1:51:52] you will not end up with a submitted
[1:51:54] holy ghost
[1:51:56] attitude because god's not going to give
[1:51:58] you all spiritual blessings in a carnal
[1:52:00] place
[1:52:03] sign cry for abominations in the city
[1:52:07] today we can shout and we can scream and
[1:52:10] we can speak with tongues and have signs
[1:52:11] and things but where is that sincerity
[1:52:15] of so sincere about the word of god and
[1:52:18] the church of god until it grieves our
[1:52:20] heart to see sin going on
[1:52:22] and elijah had come into all of this can
[1:52:24] we say amen to that it should grieve our
[1:52:27] hearts we shouldn't just say well they
[1:52:29] don't believe like us
[1:52:32] their churches is full of nonsense they
[1:52:34] don't believe like us it should grieve
[1:52:35] our heart that satan could deceive a
[1:52:38] people to think that all kinds of sin
[1:52:41] and nonsense in the house of god is
[1:52:43] acceptable
[1:52:45] i want a holy fire let me just you know
[1:52:47] i i just want to give clarity in case
[1:52:49] somebody's listening on the internet or
[1:52:51] here or whatever i want to give clarity
[1:52:53] to where i stand i want a sin
[1:52:57] killing
[1:52:58] fire of god to flow through this church
[1:53:02] and i don't mean it just you or you i
[1:53:05] mean every one of us that it would come
[1:53:08] through here and quench the hunger and
[1:53:10] burn the sin out of us amen burn the
[1:53:13] refiners fire burn us
[1:53:16] not just give us a little warm where
[1:53:18] we're uncomfortable
[1:53:21] burn us
[1:53:23] melt us down lord because otherwise
[1:53:26] church we're going to stand as a church
[1:53:28] together on that day and find out that
[1:53:30] we came short but i didn't come here to
[1:53:33] come short you didn't come here to come
[1:53:36] short we came here because the word is
[1:53:39] living in us and the word has compelled
[1:53:42] us
[1:53:44] hallelujah anything short of that right
[1:53:46] there is man's works in men's labor and
[1:53:49] the word says that will fail
[1:53:51] hallelujah
[1:53:53] amen
[1:53:56] he made a challenge to them let the god
[1:53:58] that is supernatural let him that can
[1:53:59] show himself alive let him be god if all
[1:54:03] your theologies he was speaking to them
[1:54:05] if baal miss god if he can answer let
[1:54:07] him answer let god that answers let the
[1:54:09] god that keeps his word be god
[1:54:13] look my brother and sister you could
[1:54:14] almost take that over to the devil
[1:54:17] the devil keeps his word
[1:54:20] come on
[1:54:21] come on he makes all kinds of promises
[1:54:23] here but he's also made a promise behind
[1:54:25] the back of the people that said i will
[1:54:28] take you to the lake of fire with me
[1:54:31] jesus come and said today you'll be with
[1:54:33] me in paradise satan is right there with
[1:54:36] his own promise of redemption
[1:54:39] i'll take you
[1:54:40] as my bride
[1:54:42] to the lake of fire
[1:54:44] and he'll keep that promise
[1:54:46] oh you better believe it
[1:54:50] if that isn't a challenge tonight to the
[1:54:52] world again let the god that keeps his
[1:54:54] word be god so what happened he called
[1:54:57] them together and the god of heaven
[1:54:59] answered in a supernatural sign to
[1:55:01] israel that he was still the god that
[1:55:03] could answer by fire and i want to say
[1:55:05] tonight today that he is still a god
[1:55:08] that answers by fire today he's using
[1:55:11] the holy spirit
[1:55:13] amen and it comes and it moves in our
[1:55:16] midst my brother and sister it's not
[1:55:18] paul's preaching it's not david's
[1:55:19] preaching it's not uh uh anyone's
[1:55:22] preaching amen it's not brother chris is
[1:55:24] preaching it's not that's not what
[1:55:26] brings it up it's god speaking it's god
[1:55:29] speaking it's god that says you know
[1:55:31] what this is what i'm going to do this
[1:55:32] is how it is i'm going to bring this to
[1:55:34] pass i make a promise to you i speak to
[1:55:37] your heart i deliver you i provide for
[1:55:40] you i bless you it's not a man preaching
[1:55:44] that into your life it's the holy ghost
[1:55:46] coming down speaking the word out to you
[1:55:51] oh hallelujah
[1:55:57] it's funny when you
[1:55:58] read they criticize the mormons for
[1:56:01] believing their gods
[1:56:05] when it's just so absolute close to the
[1:56:07] truth
[1:56:09] and the world can't stand that right
[1:56:11] because for them under that anointing
[1:56:14] they've got to put god
[1:56:15] over here behind a curtain once again
[1:56:21] we can't see him
[1:56:22] we can't really hear him
[1:56:25] god doesn't really talk to us then the
[1:56:27] flip side of that is you got these
[1:56:28] people anti-word just live in any way
[1:56:30] and they get up on tv and whatever else
[1:56:32] and they say and the lord told me
[1:56:37] you sir leave your wife
[1:56:40] and marry that woman and if people go
[1:56:42] out and get a divorce lawyer and say
[1:56:44] well it was prophetic
[1:56:45] really
[1:56:47] it was devilishly prophetic
[1:56:51] yeah it was their god that's right
[1:56:54] balaam talking
[1:56:56] yeah vision challenge tonight the world
[1:56:58] again let god keeps his word so what
[1:56:59] happened he called them together the god
[1:57:01] of heaven answered in a supernatural
[1:57:03] sign to israel that he was still the god
[1:57:04] that could answer by fire and he did
[1:57:06] just what he always did answered prayer
[1:57:08] kept his word i told you this was a
[1:57:11] super size
[1:57:12] quote here amen hallelujah we just now
[1:57:15] made it to the kingpin amen after all of
[1:57:18] this
[1:57:19] still it wasn't sufficient and little
[1:57:21] old elijah didn't he didn't know what to
[1:57:24] do
[1:57:24] so he ran to a juniper tree
[1:57:29] and those of you
[1:57:31] in your time of trouble
[1:57:33] went off and hid
[1:57:35] and the devil come and said oh aren't
[1:57:37] you man or woman enough to just stand up
[1:57:40] no no i want you to follow this we sang
[1:57:42] a song brother jay you sang it this
[1:57:43] morning right here
[1:57:45] amen i can't remember the name of that
[1:57:46] song but i just about leaped out of my
[1:57:49] any of you remember right at the moment
[1:57:50] that i said hallelujah and clap my hands
[1:57:52] that was a song
[1:57:56] look at this
[1:57:57] little elijah he didn't know what to do
[1:57:59] say run to the juniper tree i'm glad
[1:58:01] there is a juniper tree all god's
[1:58:03] peoples needs to go to that juniper tree
[1:58:06] it's a place where he was so discouraged
[1:58:09] he didn't know what to do so he ran out
[1:58:11] to himself god under the juniper tree
[1:58:13] many of us feel like going there and
[1:58:16] today when we see the institutions
[1:58:17] filled with people of god nervous
[1:58:19] breakdown tension oh it makes us all
[1:58:21] want to run to the juniper tree i i
[1:58:23] think we could express it like the old
[1:58:25] colored lady said down south when she'd
[1:58:27] been hit by an automobile now tell me
[1:58:29] there is a little humor in the gospel
[1:58:31] when you read this hit by an automobile
[1:58:33] a car had struck her and they asked her
[1:58:36] if she wanted to sue for damages
[1:58:38] and she said lousy no child i don't need
[1:58:41] damage i need repair
[1:58:44] hallelujah
[1:58:46] amen i don't care it's a set here let me
[1:58:49] put it what went through my mind oh the
[1:58:51] devil drugged me down oh drug me down
[1:58:54] into the pits of despair and i was the
[1:58:56] biggest alcoholic i was the biggest
[1:58:58] fighter the biggest liar the biggest
[1:58:59] thief i'm sorry you're trying to get
[1:59:02] damages
[1:59:04] but i'm here to tell you
[1:59:05] i was lost but now i am found
[1:59:08] amen i have had the blood of jesus
[1:59:11] christ poured over me i know what it
[1:59:13] feels like i know what grace and mercy
[1:59:16] feels like
[1:59:18] hallelujah
[1:59:19] lousy no child i don't need damage
[1:59:23] hallelujah oh i'm sorry i just a little
[1:59:27] something forgive me for my humor
[1:59:30] and i think that's about the way the
[1:59:32] church needs tonight is a repair a place
[1:59:34] under the juniper tree so we can be
[1:59:36] alone and the prophet that great day how
[1:59:39] disappointed he was
[1:59:41] that he had done just exactly what god
[1:59:43] told him to do and he thought surely if
[1:59:45] i did that the people would believe it
[1:59:47] but he come to find out that all the
[1:59:49] miracles that god told him to perform he
[1:59:51] did it and still
[1:59:53] jezebel
[1:59:56] you want to know how powerful that
[1:59:57] jezebel spirit is
[2:00:01] i'll tell you how powerful it is and i
[2:00:02] hope this don't hurt nobody's feelings
[2:00:04] it's powerful enough to come bring
[2:00:06] people into the house of god dressed
[2:00:08] like they're walking a street
[2:00:11] it's powerful enough that people who lie
[2:00:14] cheat and steal would sit in the house
[2:00:16] of god and give their ill-gotten gains
[2:00:19] and boast about what they've done for
[2:00:21] the church
[2:00:23] it's powerful enough to take the word of
[2:00:26] god and water it down that the people
[2:00:29] would walk out saying i said amen to the
[2:00:31] word of god today without ever catching
[2:00:33] the revelation of what is preached
[2:00:35] that's how powerful this spirit is
[2:00:38] jezebel quite a quite a woman
[2:00:41] amen
[2:00:43] not only refused it but she said she
[2:00:45] would stop his campaign she couldn't
[2:00:47] have no more of those campaigns she'd
[2:00:49] cut his head off if he did you see when
[2:00:51] the devil gets ahold of a person he just
[2:00:53] this does them awful
[2:00:55] i've seen it happen saints i i don't
[2:00:57] even want to go into it but i will put
[2:00:58] this out young people please listen to
[2:01:00] me i went to a church not that far from
[2:01:02] here the town of greenleaf west of
[2:01:04] caldwell
[2:01:05] 50 young people in that church and only
[2:01:07] a little dinky handful of them serve the
[2:01:09] lord today and the rest my heart goes
[2:01:12] out so i'm not judging them scattered
[2:01:15] many of them
[2:01:16] four or five husbands four or five wives
[2:01:19] absolute wreck
[2:01:22] oh
[2:01:24] it humbles me when i think of the fact i
[2:01:27] never had the holy ghost i didn't know
[2:01:29] what i was doing i wanted to do this i
[2:01:31] tell the story with a little humor i was
[2:01:33] living in colorado a little girl worked
[2:01:35] in the mcdonald's cutest little thing
[2:01:37] you ever saw blonde hair blue eyes all
[2:01:39] you decide that's wonderful and all she
[2:01:41] was so friendly to paul and i'm paul
[2:01:43] finally got his courage up and said hey
[2:01:45] would you like to go to a movie
[2:01:47] she reached across the counter patted me
[2:01:49] on and she goes oh paul i think you
[2:01:51] misunderstood i i like you love you
[2:01:54] like a brother
[2:01:58] now you say what has that got to do with
[2:02:00] it
[2:02:01] i would have been there myself
[2:02:04] but god's grace
[2:02:06] god's grace god rich in mercy he said
[2:02:09] i'm not gonna let you go that way so i'm
[2:02:11] gonna cause you to face rejection and
[2:02:13] then one day jerry come along and i say
[2:02:15] this in love and humor one day jerry
[2:02:17] come along and she said yes i know you
[2:02:19] had bad breath and i know you wore those
[2:02:21] shabby clothes and i know this and i
[2:02:22] know that but i love you anyhow
[2:02:25] hallelujah and we can say that in humor
[2:02:27] but i see what it was god said okay
[2:02:29] you've come to the time this is the one
[2:02:33] that wasn't you out there this is you
[2:02:36] here
[2:02:38] oh hallelujah
[2:02:40] you see when the devil got a hold to a
[2:02:41] person he does them awful he thought the
[2:02:43] signs and the wonders of a living god
[2:02:45] would be sufficient but it wasn't so
[2:02:47] elijah's now his heart's broke and he
[2:02:49] says right here so his poor heart was
[2:02:51] broke and he ran to the juniper tree for
[2:02:53] refuge and he laid out there and i can
[2:02:56] see him leaving his servant many miles
[2:02:58] behind he went to himself out under the
[2:02:59] tree all of us have a little place to go
[2:03:02] when we get in those troubles i've got a
[2:03:04] little cave that the fbi couldn't find
[2:03:06] me that i get into and stay in there two
[2:03:09] three days have to wade up a creek and
[2:03:11] over a hill and through a branch and go
[2:03:13] under a tree go down into a cave and
[2:03:16] there's always somewhere that we can
[2:03:18] retreat and get in the presence of god
[2:03:20] again and i believe friends that no man
[2:03:23] has a right to profess christianity as a
[2:03:26] christian until he's found such a
[2:03:28] retreat
[2:03:32] can i interpret what the prophet of god
[2:03:33] is talking about
[2:03:35] without that kind of retreat
[2:03:37] we retreat
[2:03:39] into possessing things we retreat into
[2:03:42] behaviors we retreat into bar stools we
[2:03:46] retreat into music we retreat into
[2:03:48] relationships we retreat to something
[2:03:51] and as a real christian we have a place
[2:03:53] can we say amen we have a place to
[2:03:56] retreat to and that's jesus christ in
[2:03:59] christ alone
[2:04:00] hallelujah
[2:04:02] amen
[2:04:04] there is somewhere that we can retreat
[2:04:05] get in the presence of god again and i
[2:04:08] believe friends that no man has a right
[2:04:09] to profess christianity as a christian
[2:04:11] until he's found such a retreat they may
[2:04:14] come a time when men who are worldly
[2:04:17] trained
[2:04:18] not godly scent might be able to explain
[2:04:21] all the supernatural away from the bible
[2:04:26] you know what time the prophet of god
[2:04:27] was talking about right here
[2:04:29] right
[2:04:31] now
[2:04:32] the internet is full of people
[2:04:35] who are explaining away
[2:04:38] everything amen
[2:04:43] oh
[2:04:45] my oh my
[2:04:48] i want to go there lord but i i just
[2:04:50] believe i shouldn't
[2:04:52] amen
[2:04:54] prophet of god said if you have a
[2:04:55] question don't do it so
[2:05:00] they're explained all the supernatural
[2:05:03] now look at this
[2:05:05] follow these saints
[2:05:08] they might be able to satisfy the carnal
[2:05:10] mind
[2:05:14] these people on the internet
[2:05:16] that have all declared you're in a cult
[2:05:21] sister jerry obviously excluded
[2:05:24] my granddaughter leah obviously excluded
[2:05:28] but when's the last time brother paul
[2:05:29] told you
[2:05:30] what to do
[2:05:39] go study it out
[2:05:40] one of the key elements of a con of a
[2:05:43] cult
[2:05:44] is control
[2:05:46] i can't speak for any other church on
[2:05:48] the face of the earth but i'll tell you
[2:05:50] what grace tabernacle is not in a cult
[2:05:53] we are serving jesus christ as our lord
[2:05:56] and savior and we are led by the holy
[2:05:58] ghost and the holy ghost will give the
[2:06:00] answers that we need we don't need
[2:06:02] psychology we don't need some mental
[2:06:04] conception we don't need some guy over
[2:06:07] here some guy over there we need to get
[2:06:10] down serious and say lord i would like
[2:06:12] an answer to my question i would like a
[2:06:15] direction to my life i would like a
[2:06:18] solution to my problem
[2:06:22] because i tell you what if this church
[2:06:24] ever would turn into some kind of a cult
[2:06:26] count me out i'm gone i won't even come
[2:06:28] around to resign i'll just be gone
[2:06:30] because you see i have a hard enough
[2:06:31] time to decide what we should do our
[2:06:33] family
[2:06:34] much less adding the burden of trying to
[2:06:36] tell you what to do
[2:06:38] and i've said this in bad humor before
[2:06:40] and i say in bad humor and i'm actually
[2:06:42] repenting to you i've said before if
[2:06:43] this is a cult i'll go to the back with
[2:06:45] the offering plate you guys give me all
[2:06:46] your money on the way out but you know
[2:06:48] what i don't want the devil to even
[2:06:49] anoint something like that so i retract
[2:06:51] that and ask for your forgiveness to
[2:06:53] ever say that in the house of god
[2:06:55] we're not inviting no spirit that comes
[2:06:58] of that persuasion of that behavior
[2:07:01] we're only going to invite the holy
[2:07:02] ghost to come into this house to lead us
[2:07:05] we've been talking preaching about
[2:07:07] building a house i want to say today
[2:07:09] emphatically undeniably lord i want you
[2:07:13] to fill this house
[2:07:16] nothing else but you lord
[2:07:19] oh hallelujah
[2:07:21] amen look
[2:07:23] they might be able to satisfy the carnal
[2:07:25] mind that doesn't know god that the days
[2:07:27] of miracles are passed and no such thing
[2:07:29] as the holy ghost but if a man has ever
[2:07:31] had an experience where you met god huh
[2:07:34] huh come on church amen never had an
[2:07:37] experience where we met god
[2:07:39] amen
[2:07:40] all the theologians in the world could
[2:07:42] never take that experience away from you
[2:07:45] you met god face to face and you know
[2:07:48] what you're talking about
[2:07:50] oh i'm gonna say something that sounds
[2:07:51] harsh and i don't mean it too but every
[2:07:53] one of these people that's come along 20
[2:07:56] 30 40 years well let's just start at day
[2:07:58] one to 40 50 60 years and then say no
[2:08:01] done with this this wasn't that no i'll
[2:08:04] tell you what it is my brother and
[2:08:05] sister they never got saved they never
[2:08:08] had a personal experience with god
[2:08:11] hallelujah because if they did they
[2:08:13] would look at this i'm not defending the
[2:08:15] message as per say but i'm talking about
[2:08:17] that relationship with god
[2:08:19] amen they can't walk away from that
[2:08:23] you met god face to face you know what
[2:08:25] you're talking about like moses at the
[2:08:27] sacred sands in the backside of the
[2:08:29] desert when a man ever meets god upon
[2:08:31] them sacred sands of that secret place
[2:08:33] of retreat no devils in hell can ever
[2:08:36] take that away from him for he knows he
[2:08:38] talked face to face with god
[2:08:41] now look i'm sorry but i just got to
[2:08:43] make point on this you'll see people say
[2:08:45] and the lord told me
[2:08:47] and you don't even have to go pray or
[2:08:49] get deep in the supernatural to go just
[2:08:52] a second amen just a second that's not
[2:08:55] what my bible says
[2:08:57] that's not what the word of god said to
[2:09:00] me from the word
[2:09:02] amen and yet they will go and plow and
[2:09:05] they'll make comments to you you don't
[2:09:07] know what the holy spirit spoke to me
[2:09:11] well i'm sorry and i'm not saying this
[2:09:12] to be derogatory but there was a spirit
[2:09:15] spoke to you but it wasn't the holy
[2:09:17] spirit because if it was a holy spirit
[2:09:19] you would be able to come and you could
[2:09:22] search this out maybe you need a
[2:09:24] reference maybe you need to kind of find
[2:09:26] a guide but you would go in the word and
[2:09:28] you'd say that voice told me
[2:09:30] there it is
[2:09:32] oh thank you lord amen
[2:09:36] but when they can search it cover to
[2:09:38] cover and never find
[2:09:40] something that would support it but yet
[2:09:42] say it was the lord spoke to me
[2:09:46] come on saints
[2:09:48] come on saints that's the day we're
[2:09:49] living in
[2:09:50] as i said earlier these times amen we
[2:09:52] acknowledge it's the times it's the
[2:09:54] seasons
[2:09:55] it's coming
[2:09:56] amen you met god face to face you know
[2:09:59] what you're talking about
[2:10:01] amen no devils in hell can ever take
[2:10:03] that from him for he knows he talked
[2:10:05] face to face with god they can explain
[2:10:07] anything they want to
[2:10:09] you got to love it though when they
[2:10:11] start explaining the trinity
[2:10:15] well it's like three distinct persons in
[2:10:18] one
[2:10:20] but it's one god
[2:10:22] and uh
[2:10:25] no we have no scripture to support it
[2:10:27] it's complicated
[2:10:33] now i say that a little bit derogatory
[2:10:36] but i'm telling you
[2:10:38] that spirit
[2:10:39] is strong enough to
[2:10:42] deceive
[2:10:44] millions
[2:10:46] millions saints
[2:10:48] not just a few quacko's over here
[2:10:52] all the way from rich and sophisticated
[2:10:56] to as it were the down and out he
[2:10:57] deceived in every class and place and
[2:11:00] continent
[2:11:02] that's a powerful spirit
[2:11:04] that's why saints i tell you i'm sorry
[2:11:06] i'm taking so long this morning
[2:11:09] that's why i tell you take it back to
[2:11:10] the word
[2:11:12] you take it back you don't trust me you
[2:11:14] don't trust brother david you don't
[2:11:15] trust brother chris you don't trust
[2:11:17] brother david nash or brother jose
[2:11:20] hernandez or any visiting minister it's
[2:11:22] your soul it's your soul it isn't like
[2:11:25] you're questioning you're doubting
[2:11:27] you're afraid it's your job
[2:11:30] it's your job take it back to the word
[2:11:32] amen oh you say what are you saying
[2:11:34] brother paul
[2:11:36] take it back face to face
[2:11:40] not a second hand
[2:11:42] third hand
[2:11:44] face to face
[2:11:45] some would say we'd be leaving the
[2:11:47] prophet behind but i tell you i have
[2:11:48] quotes where the prophet of god said
[2:11:51] that there will be young mens come
[2:11:52] someday
[2:11:54] they'll carry this word on
[2:11:58] he didn't say i'll have mechanical
[2:12:00] things or all of this other he declared
[2:12:03] young men would come and the word of god
[2:12:06] the word of god declares it also my
[2:12:08] brother and sister
[2:12:09] they can explain anything they want to
[2:12:11] but you were there when it happened and
[2:12:13] you know what you speak of
[2:12:15] hallelujah can someone say amen to that
[2:12:19] hallelujah
[2:12:21] now look at this
[2:12:22] come on i got to get closing
[2:12:25] uh
[2:12:26] the prophet told us pray for revelation
[2:12:28] yes sir i told you i want to bring this
[2:12:30] right back
[2:12:32] i want to bring this about i told you
[2:12:33] earlier i want to bring this back around
[2:12:36] we're taught to pray for revelation but
[2:12:37] i tell you what i want you to do i want
[2:12:38] you to pray just as your brother i'm not
[2:12:40] making a doctrine out of this i want you
[2:12:42] to pray that the lord would reveal the
[2:12:44] spirit of your situation
[2:12:47] to you amen
[2:12:51] come on
[2:12:52] the spirit on your situation that the
[2:12:55] spirit of the situation would be
[2:12:57] revealed to you
[2:13:00] some of us
[2:13:01] wouldn't be nearly so excited
[2:13:03] about the situations around us amen if
[2:13:06] we actually saw the spirit
[2:13:10] yes sir oh hallelujah
[2:13:14] let me just go on
[2:13:17] now
[2:13:20] i already hit this about the statue of
[2:13:21] the perfect man i'm just going to skip
[2:13:23] over it but i'm telling you my brother
[2:13:24] and sister spiritual growth is a
[2:13:26] struggle
[2:13:27] don't think you're going to sit on these
[2:13:28] church pews right here and just somehow
[2:13:31] just grow spiritually
[2:13:33] you're going to have to struggle amen if
[2:13:35] i could emphasize i actually forgot to
[2:13:38] ask the brothers if they could put up
[2:13:39] the statue of a perfect man but i want
[2:13:41] to emphasize to you my brother and
[2:13:43] sister in a very expanded way that the
[2:13:46] statue of perfect man would be like
[2:13:48] these steps
[2:13:49] and like your newborn baby
[2:13:52] imagine your newborn baby
[2:13:54] trying to climb up these steps
[2:13:58] near impossible
[2:14:01] but as
[2:14:02] your newborn
[2:14:03] feeds on the word
[2:14:05] and he grows
[2:14:08] then pretty soon i hope i hope i
[2:14:10] won't speak out a turn but
[2:14:12] pretty soon he'll be like little sammy
[2:14:15] at the
[2:14:16] grace kids and
[2:14:20] this is a couple times ago
[2:14:23] they had some desserts far on the
[2:14:25] counter
[2:14:26] he got up in that chair and he's leaning
[2:14:28] forward
[2:14:29] he's trying to reach it
[2:14:33] he can't quite reach it
[2:14:36] so he said i have a solution
[2:14:38] i'm going to get up on my own two feet
[2:14:42] come on i hope you follow me
[2:14:44] he didn't say mama
[2:14:47] he did look around see brother paul was
[2:14:49] watching him
[2:14:50] and i think he was thinking
[2:14:52] what's he gonna do and i hate to admit
[2:14:54] this in public but i'm thinking well i'm
[2:14:56] already slid over into a grandfather's
[2:14:58] spirit
[2:15:00] give him the sugar
[2:15:07] sister yulia i'm sorry to tell on your
[2:15:09] son
[2:15:11] brother sergey but
[2:15:13] i thought it was pretty funny because he
[2:15:14] looked around and all he saw was me
[2:15:16] watching him he just climbed up on the
[2:15:18] counter and i don't mean he climbed up
[2:15:19] on and crawled over to that food he
[2:15:21] climbed up and walked over there and
[2:15:22] bent over and got what he wanted
[2:15:25] hallelujah and i'm telling you i thought
[2:15:27] isn't that the truth of how it is there
[2:15:29] was a day you couldn't make it up the
[2:15:30] steps of the stature of a perfect man
[2:15:33] but then the day comes and we're growing
[2:15:35] and we're growing and we're growing and
[2:15:38] pretty soon we're not stopped down here
[2:15:40] at the bottom saying oh praise the lord
[2:15:41] this has been revealed to me we're
[2:15:43] looking up
[2:15:45] lord i want that up there
[2:15:47] now lord if i've got to climb if i've
[2:15:49] got to do whatever's necessary i'm going
[2:15:52] to get that
[2:15:53] amen little sammy became an inspiration
[2:15:56] of a fought hallelujah stature of a
[2:15:58] perfect man we can sit there and lean
[2:16:00] over the banister as it were of heaven
[2:16:02] and say lord if you just give that to me
[2:16:04] or we can say it's there somebody has
[2:16:06] prepared it it's in front of me and i
[2:16:08] know that i want that i desire that i
[2:16:11] believe that is for me
[2:16:15] and then we get up and we start marching
[2:16:17] we start climbing we start moving up my
[2:16:19] brother and sister and we don't sit back
[2:16:21] and say well if the lord wants me to be
[2:16:24] a better christian
[2:16:25] we are here something inside of us
[2:16:27] saying i want to be
[2:16:29] i want to be your word manifested i want
[2:16:31] to be the witness of this age i want to
[2:16:33] be the word in flesh that's what i want
[2:16:36] to be lord
[2:16:38] and i'm going to press to the mark of
[2:16:40] the high calling until i become what my
[2:16:43] heart's desire is
[2:16:47] oh hallelujah
[2:16:49] but i'm telling you you were there when
[2:16:50] it happened and you want to know what
[2:16:52] you're talking about
[2:16:53] amen now look at this
[2:16:56] hallelujah
[2:16:58] oh my more quotes one more please
[2:17:02] please
[2:17:05] okay
[2:17:07] now look at this
[2:17:09] prophet's talking here
[2:17:10] in the seventh church ages smyrning
[2:17:12] church age now my brother and sister
[2:17:15] there's a lot that goes with this
[2:17:17] in front of this behind i encourage you
[2:17:18] to go read
[2:17:20] a lot right there
[2:17:22] but he comes down here now and he says
[2:17:24] now comes our triumphal capstone on the
[2:17:27] baptism of the holy ghost galatians 4 4
[2:17:29] 7.
[2:17:30] but when the fullness of time was come
[2:17:35] the fullness for that time right
[2:17:39] or this time
[2:17:43] see it'd be easy to say okay um
[2:17:45] yeah
[2:17:47] that was
[2:17:48] back there
[2:17:51] but when the fullness of time was come
[2:17:52] god sent forth his son made of a woman
[2:17:54] made under the law
[2:17:57] to redeem them that were under the law
[2:18:00] that we might receive the adoption of
[2:18:02] sons
[2:18:03] and because ye are sons god has sent
[2:18:05] forth the spirit of his son into your
[2:18:07] hearts crying abba father wherefore they
[2:18:10] are no more a servant
[2:18:13] but a son
[2:18:14] and if a son then made an heir of god
[2:18:17] through christ
[2:18:19] you know you know what this tells me
[2:18:20] saints
[2:18:21] when this speaks to me i have
[2:18:25] and i want to apply this can i just
[2:18:27] beforehand get you to agree that this
[2:18:28] would apply to you you don't even know
[2:18:30] what i'm talking about
[2:18:31] but i want you to agree
[2:18:34] i
[2:18:34] have no inheritance
[2:18:38] in satan's house
[2:18:41] i have nothing i don't want a toothpick
[2:18:44] i don't even want the lint behind the
[2:18:46] curtains i want nothing out of satan's
[2:18:49] house
[2:18:50] because you see i've been called into
[2:18:52] adoption to receive oh hallelujah and
[2:18:56] because
[2:19:02] because he sent forth the spirit of his
[2:19:04] son into my heart into your heart
[2:19:07] hallelujah crying abba father what is it
[2:19:11] my father my father it's not just him
[2:19:15] people are like well predestination i'll
[2:19:16] serve god because of predestination
[2:19:18] you've missed the mark of predestination
[2:19:21] god put a desire it's not god oh this is
[2:19:24] for next service i'll repeat it amen
[2:19:26] it's not for god to make you go to do
[2:19:28] that but god put something that seed
[2:19:31] down in your heart and soul that is so
[2:19:33] strong it is so hungry there's where it
[2:19:36] is that he makes you to dwell
[2:19:40] in the heavenlies
[2:19:41] people say well god can't make you oh
[2:19:43] yes he can
[2:19:45] not strong-armed
[2:19:47] but he puts a desire
[2:19:49] in there that is so strong
[2:19:53] that you find yourself compelled
[2:19:57] compelled
[2:19:59] hallelujah
[2:20:02] i hope you got that
[2:20:03] because that's actually not by my words
[2:20:05] my brother and sister but that's
[2:20:06] actually pretty deep
[2:20:08] when the holy spirit can compel you
[2:20:11] that it actually makes you rise up from
[2:20:13] your current woe is me and press into
[2:20:16] the word of god
[2:20:20] hallelujah can i finish part two this
[2:20:22] morning
[2:20:24] see now you're no more
[2:20:27] you're no more a servant but a son and
[2:20:29] if a son and heir of god through christ
[2:20:31] there it is jesus christ come forth died
[2:20:33] upon the cross and accomplished
[2:20:35] redemption restoring to the original
[2:20:37] owner by means of purchase or paying the
[2:20:39] price and hereby placed us as
[2:20:42] sons
[2:20:43] look at this saints it's right here this
[2:20:45] is beautiful he did not make us sons for
[2:20:50] we were already his sons but he placed
[2:20:53] us as sons for as long as we were in the
[2:20:56] world in the flesh
[2:20:58] oh my that flesh got to die now
[2:21:01] we could not be
[2:21:03] recognized
[2:21:05] oh who wants to be recognized as sons
[2:21:07] and daughters of god amen hallelujah i
[2:21:10] don't want them to recognize me of some
[2:21:12] religious person or some this or that i
[2:21:14] want to be recognized as a son of god
[2:21:18] hallelujah placed as his sons amen we
[2:21:22] were held captive by the devil
[2:21:26] that's right
[2:21:30] oh my
[2:21:32] sister emmy come
[2:21:34] i've got to
[2:21:35] i've got to
[2:21:36] we're held captive by the devil but we
[2:21:38] were sons nonetheless and hear this
[2:21:44] and hear this
[2:21:46] because ye our sons god has sent forth
[2:21:49] the spirit of his son into your heart
[2:21:51] whereby
[2:21:53] i'm going to add a couple words in there
[2:21:55] whereby you can
[2:21:57] cry
[2:21:59] my father
[2:22:00] my father
[2:22:02] this is not just words to us my brother
[2:22:04] and sister this is the heart's cry of
[2:22:06] the bride of christ
[2:22:08] father father upon whom did the spirit
[2:22:11] fall at pentecost
[2:22:12] sons at corinth upon sons while they
[2:22:15] heard
[2:22:17] the word
[2:22:18] oh hallelujah
[2:22:20] oh hallelujah
[2:22:22] now look at this
[2:22:24] i want to share a little something
[2:22:28] side note sunday school
[2:22:31] maybe it'll speak to you
[2:22:33] in the king james you'll find that in
[2:22:35] other versions of the bible they have
[2:22:37] changed words
[2:22:38] substituted used words in different
[2:22:40] fashion
[2:22:42] but in king james the word defeat
[2:22:44] appears two times in the bible
[2:22:48] niv and different ones they take the
[2:22:50] word smote
[2:22:51] [Music]
[2:22:53] and put defeat in that place
[2:22:56] but you see my brother and sister
[2:22:59] defeat
[2:23:00] is to be a conqueror
[2:23:02] victorious
[2:23:04] smote actually means
[2:23:06] to strike with a firm blow
[2:23:09] so look what they've done by watering
[2:23:10] the bible down niv in a bunch of these
[2:23:12] different versions they have not made
[2:23:14] you a conqueror they just said you took
[2:23:16] a swipe at the devil
[2:23:20] and you think reading the word of god
[2:23:21] don't affect you i'm here to take the
[2:23:24] word that says i defeated him
[2:23:26] amen i'm not here just taking a swipe at
[2:23:28] the devil that means he's alive to come
[2:23:30] back and and and do what he does but i
[2:23:33] want to defeat this devil
[2:23:34] amen i want him done but look these two
[2:23:37] times the word defeat appears in in
[2:23:41] king james
[2:23:43] second samuel 15 34 2nd samuel 17 14 and
[2:23:47] both of these are concerning absalom
[2:23:51] god declaring i've come to defeat the
[2:23:53] spirit i'm paraphrasing i've come to
[2:23:55] defeat the plans and the spirit of
[2:23:58] absalom
[2:24:00] he didn't just take a swipe at the
[2:24:01] spirit of absalom he defeated it
[2:24:05] oh hallelujah now look my brother and
[2:24:07] sister if the lord would just put that
[2:24:09] bird in there two times in the king
[2:24:12] james version i don't want you as your
[2:24:14] pastor
[2:24:16] i want to encourage you
[2:24:17] i want you to think about it
[2:24:20] don't use that word
[2:24:22] don't let the spirit of that word come
[2:24:24] upon you
[2:24:26] we are here as overcomers
[2:24:28] of the word
[2:24:29] we are overcomers of the age that we
[2:24:31] live in the spirits of it and the word
[2:24:33] in us is more than able
[2:24:36] hallelujah can we say amen i'm more than
[2:24:39] able
[2:24:40] hallelujah okay i don't want to sound
[2:24:42] like i'm lying to you but here's here
[2:24:43] we're done right here amen
[2:24:46] i want you to take this scripture with
[2:24:48] you hold on to it tight
[2:24:51] deuteronomy 31 6 be strong
[2:24:54] and of good courage
[2:24:56] fear not
[2:24:58] nor be afraid
[2:25:00] of covid
[2:25:04] of the government
[2:25:06] of
[2:25:08] laodicea of the antichrist
[2:25:12] come on see didn't didn't put any
[2:25:13] limitations on this
[2:25:15] don't be afraid of them what are the
[2:25:17] what are thems
[2:25:18] what are thems
[2:25:22] any spirit that's not subject to the
[2:25:25] word of god
[2:25:26] is the thems
[2:25:30] for the lord
[2:25:31] thy god
[2:25:33] now do you realize how direct that is
[2:25:35] that couldn't be spoken to a mixed group
[2:25:37] of believers
[2:25:39] the lord
[2:25:41] thy god
[2:25:46] he it is that doth go with thee
[2:25:50] he will not fail thee
[2:25:52] nor forsake me
