your Bibles tonight turn with me to Isaiah chapter 14 we'll read this and we will pray and be seated Isaiah 14 verse 12 how art thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the Nations for thou Hast said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high yet thou sh shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we are so happy to be in your house tonight Lord we we love the word and we we want we ask that you'd speak to us Lord father we we've all come Lord we all have uh different lives that we each live and they're intertwined and they're connected in some way but we all have those things in our hearts that we need answers to Lord we all have those things things where we need strengthening Lord the areas of our life those those parts that may be only shared between the husband and wife of of strengthening needed Lord and but God you you you are there always you're you're there in the kitchen late at night you're there in the bedroom late at night you're listening you're hearing us as we talk as we express ourselves as in prayer or or to each other Lord you're paying attention so God tonight this is a if we could take the Liberty to say a compilation father of of the past few days Lord you've come maybe the past few weeks months years you've come to say something tonight help us to listen Lord help us not to interject our own ideas our own opinions father from the pulpit or from the Pew Lord but let us be open with our hearts laid out before you God that you could lift us to a higher place tonight we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated tonight I'd like to take the the uh thought tonight on the battle of the twins with the subtitle of origin of sin and righteousness this started out as uh being titled the origin of sin but it just sounded too dark I just couldn't couldn't leave it that way but we're going to look we're going to go back and and and we're going to look at a few things here tonight so we read in Isaiah um how where Lucifer he was uh the son of the morning and he was in heaven he was with the angels at that point point in in time or at that point um you see that that uh Lucifer got the idea um that he wanted to be lifted up above uh God and he wanted to take God's position you know he he thought he could do a better job and so the problem is is that nobody can be God but God and um that's a fundamental truth that we even as Believers sometimes forget because we we start to take matters in our own hands and and we we we start to try to fix situations and as soon as a human tries to fix a spiritual situation um it gets pretty messy uh things don't work out the way that we want them to and next thing you know we're going back to God and saying God look I'm sorry I made this aess can you please help me clean it up and much better would it have been if we started there but as we do that a few times or few dozen times depending on the type of learner you are um you come to the place where you stop you say Lord I need your help right now I need you to come and show me the next step to take and sometimes he doesn't actually give us an answer he leads us to a scripture but that is an answer sometimes in devotions we read a chapter we read a story and God speaks to us and we say oh my situation aligns with this but the fact of the matter is God is God okay and when we try to take his place we lose out but that's not our topic tonight our topic is the Battle of the twins so I want to I I want to look at at the origin of sin and righteousness I don't know maybe we'll have another one on the Battle of twins some point I have no idea but we left ourselves an out um 1 Timothy 2:14 uh the scripture say and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression now I know we are all very familiar with this but when when something is someone is deceived they genuinely do not know that they are doing wrong they think they are doing right they are deceived they are completely blinded to their actions now we could say and say we could take the part and say well you know Eve I mean she was deceived she thought she was doing the right thing um but she knew she was taking the wrong steps on her way to deception so there was a point in time where she she knew hey this is not the right place to be where was Adam why wasn't she with Adam there's many different things we could we could take the Liberty to go into but the fact of it the fact is that she was where she shouldn't have been now the Bible says there was two trees in the garden The Garden of the knowledge of Good and Evil and the the excuse me the tree of the knowledge of good and evil or the tree of life and God said stay away from that tree now we know being from the word of God and from the the message that that we've been given that that that that that was the serpent was a man like you know you and I but he just was a little bit different and um that the fall was Eve had sex with the serpent and so this tree its location how that all played out we're not exactly sure but we do know there was this thing they needed to stay away from so she was over there she went to it it didn't go to her she went to it and she was having this conversation so she was deceived but there was a step along the way that she where where a point where she could have turned and so um there was a scripture in my head and it slipped away but the so this the reason I dropped this in here is because Adam wasn't deceived Eve was deceived but what led up to that and and and what what could have Eve have done differently I mean we could go all kinds of different directions of what she could could have done differently but she had a choice that she had to make she had a choice so the deception came based on her choice okay now in in the sermon uh and this also sets our point this is the beginning right this is where it all happened right here in this scripture and uh in the Garden of Eden in this quote here the greatest battle ever fought brother B says this F this great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on Earth it originated in heaven and this is kind of what started me I don't know how long ago uh I put this thought down with this quote because um I got to this quote because I heard somebody say talking about something and they say well you know the origins of that is from the Pentecostal church back in the four uh 50 60 somewhere in there and and at the moment that I heard that it stumbled me for a minute because I thought well they're right and but I thought but it doesn't it doesn't ring true and I know some of you are sitting there and you're thinking wow I thought brother Chris had a much better head on his shoulders but um it took me a minute I had to digest that that's the way I am a lot of times I got to go back and think about something later on all alone without the the pressure of a conversation and and I began to ponder on this and I thought why I know this isn't true but but why what what is the answer to this and and I begin to look and and at the and and this I came across this quote and I I thought isn't that interesting of course sin originated in heaven because the devil can't create anything he's a perverter he did not create so he didn't he he couldn't create Sin Sin had to originate in heaven and the definition of sin is unbelief so you can you hear Brother B when he preaches and he says this there's like there's a halt in the congregation and because we think of sin and we think of as as as you know going down to the grocery store and stealing something from the shell that's a sin or or saying a lie or or checking out a woman or checking out a guy right it's you're you're you're uh we that is sin but sin is unbelief and so if we took this all the way back and we begin to unpack the origin of sin and the origin of righteousness we're going to come to something I want you to just hold on because I know I I was studying this out and I thought you know what I might lose them for just a minute but just hear me out okay so faith is righteousness now in this quote here SP says um but but what is sin it's unbelief okay so sin is unbelief so what what's the opposite of unbelief belief he says what is righteousness Faith so faith is believing right all things are possible or nothing is impossible to God all you have to do is have faith right brother brandom said that many many many many times people will come to the line he said look you got to have the faith so if sin is unbelief then the opposite of sin is belief it's faith faith is righteousness he says and sin is only right righteousness perverted so sin wasn't created sin was righteousness falling from its position okay so sin is a byproduct of something it's a byproduct of unbelief so sin is unbelief so sin wasn't created sin happened okay sin happened because Lucifer had the idea that he could be God if Lucifer thought he he could be God now he's the origin of sin okay so we start with him if Lucifer thought he could be God somewhere in his relationship with God he forgot who God was he he lost faith in God's leadership he lost trust in God's leadership because he said I can do it better if he trusted God completely for God to make the decision as a pastor of Heaven he wouldn't have challenged his position so there was a lack of faith so you see you cannot have sin you cannot have unbelief if you have faith so we say all the time well we got to get rid of Sin Sin isn't something you have to get rid of sin is a lack of something sin is not a substance you can say well yeah I can go down and sin sin down that wherever I mean the bar I'm sinning that's but it's not a substance because sin is unbelief unbelief is the opposite of faith faith is light unbelief and fear is Darkness you can't grab a hold of Darkness but you can grab a hold of light so sin is because you're lacking something so you say well the world came into existence Adam and Eve fell in the Garden of Eden I'm trying to slow myself down part of that is keeping the coat on helps so so sin in the Garden of Eden is where where it all started right so what happened Eve moved out of her position and so did Adam Adam said sure I'll eat the fruit he didn't want to lose Eve beautiful story beautiful type of Christ so he moved from his position God had told him this this is where you stand this is what you do you see there one of one of the definitions of paradise is a Walled Garden so as a father my position in the home is is to build this wall around my family economics uh food shelter all of that trust uh and I make this stable position with by the grace of God and I must maintain those walls around my family so that inside of there there's a paradise they can they can play they don't have to worry about somebody kicking the door down and taking us out or or doing some whatever it is they have trust they have faith so they can play all day long I mean they got chores and school and things but that's a part of their development and that is what develops them into stable adults God did the same God do the same thing he has a our pastor preached on the laws of God he has a parameter he has a wall that walls that he has built around us and they're not for our harm and they're not legalistic you don't take a legalistic approach and say well God says I can't do this and I can't do that look sometimes my kids as much as I love them they come to the wall sometimes and I and there's discipline and there's a reminder that's the wall stay over there in the garden okay so kids test the boundaries and they test test the boundaries because they want to know are do will they hold so when they test the boundaries you better be ready to hold them because if they don't hold they'll push back and they'll go even farther next time and they will feel unstable Paradise is no longer existence because they can just go and do whatever they want now God builds this position he he builds this place around us and then we get the we we have the word of God and we have all of these things and and God this walk built around us it's we call it a hedge okay so God let the devil in to to attack job God put the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil in the garden you think well okay why would God put evil in Paradise you it had to be present if in this paradise that wasn't there Adam and Eve would not have a choice there always has to be a choice voice you see your flesh that's why your flesh you know we need to stop saying well I I can't wait to drop this robe of Flesh and and and I can't this flesh and this flesh we need to stop looking at it like that look the flesh is necessary for your Perfection you need it your flesh is chaos okay it's out of control right we all know when that person Cuts us off in traffic and we honk the horn we just we lost it what happened chaos our flesh is chaos what keeps chaos confined is order Order and Chaos you have to you chaos is undefined without order order is undefined without chaos there's no reason to Define order if there's no chaos you wouldn't even have the word because there's there has to be the opposite so you can't even have faith would be undefined without sin a god A Healer would be undefined without something to heal so that's why God let the allowed the Garden of Eden to unfold you see predestination is God looking down through time and seeing the choice you're going to make he didn't force you to make the decision he saw the choices you would make and predestination goes back to for knowledge and for knowledge goes back to forget the last one but that's what it is you look ahead God saw ahead in time God saw what you would choose so God knew what Adam and Eve would do but he put it there because now their Exile from the garden is their choice okay and their return back to God is their choice so they're worshiping God because they want to God already had people who worshiped him because they had to they're called Angels why some of them fell and some of them didn't that's God's answer I don't know but Angels the cherubs they don't have a choice they got to worship they got two you know two Wings on the top and two Wings on their feet or whatever however it goes you forgive me for butchering it but they they you know holy holy that's all they do they have to do that that that doesn't make God God but you worshiping God by choice completes him so it's absolutely necessary to the equation of redemption that your flesh is present okay so faith is the opposite of sin or righteousness faith is righteousness now in in and for further clarification on faith being righteousness we have the scripture in Romans 4: 20-2 and this is talking about Abraham and it says he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief through sin unel it we' we've defined that he staggered not the promise of God through sin but was strong in righteousness strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform so faith in the word faith in what God gave him so because of this Faith he was strong in faith there was no room for unbelief no room for sin okay and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness so his faith in the promise was his righteousness this is where this comes from because everything brother B preaches goes back to scripture now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him so it wasn't just for him that it was written that his faith in God's promise made him righteous It Was Written Paul says for us as well he says for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our our justification sanctification justification right it's all right there you see this is where people go off the rails and they say well you just got to believe if you truly believe if you truly believe in God you would dis you would come to the revelation of water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ believing believing isn't just believing isn't just saying um yeah God's real you know we were created by God fundamentally I really believe this everybody deep down inside believes in God I don't see how you couldn't they all know right you you put that you put a gun to some agnostics head what's he going to do cry for Mercy he's not going to say yes hell I'm coming for you right there's something lodged down deep inside of these people where they know good and what good and bad and you see people debate this all the time well how do we get morals what's good and bad bad where does that even come from right well it's just a set of laws that we all determin on say well if you all decided to be Nazis does that make it right the answer is no correct so God fundamentally we're all based upon this idea that God exists so this isn't a debate but we believe on God therefore true faith in God it brings you to something now Hebrews 11 vers1 very familiar scripture now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seeing so faith is a substance now we've covered this before but what I wanted to what I wanted to look at is the the opposite of this because if you can if you can ever catch the Revelation that sin isn't the substance that sin isn't isn't isn't a thing now sin is is something you can do but it's not a thing if you can never catch that then the antidote to sin in your life now we're not Sinners we're saved God has saved us so so where there's no sins imputed to us but we have sins right we make mistakes if we can ever realize when we come to a place where we struggling with something and we can realize that that something is not of substance but it is a lack of something we will address the situation much differently that is why it's so important for the token to be applied into your home because then there's no room for unbelief there's no room for sin now you have to constantly keep a watchful lie so falling from position now there's a man very famous man in the Bible by the name of David and he did something completely terrible he took a man's wife and then he murdered the man but he was go a man after God's Own Heart and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle that David sent joab and his servants with him and all Israel they destroyed Now Catch key in on this this was the time when the Kings not the generals the Kings go forth to battle and David sent joab and his servants with him and all Israel and they destroyed the children of am Ammon and besieged rabah but David carried still at Jerusalem so there's a little there's a little clue in there that is that David was supposed to be out to war so first off David just like Eve just like Lucifer out of their position this is why brother bam says if the bride could ever realize who she um this is why he says position is labors on how important position is because to be in your position is to be in a in a in a place where there's Faith righteous which is the rebuttal of sin it it's the it's what keeps sin back okay and when you get filled with the Holy Spirit that's an everlasting Faith right but still we we have things that we have to deal with so that's the beginning right you get saved you get the Holy Ghost that's the beginning now sin you're no longer a sinner you're clean you're a Son of God but you have sins and we need to get rid of those right we need to keep getting rid of those keep keep the keep the house clean and keep pressing on and that is why well I don't want to get off too off topic and it came to pass in an evening tie that David arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of the King's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon and David sent and inquired after the woman and one said is not this BBA the daughter of el the wife of Uriah the hittite the message of his grace of Grace how could David take uriah's wife the beautiful bath Sheba when he had 500 of his own good question but seeing her taking a bath now see imagination right begin to work he didn't have the strength to fight what he saw so he entertained it till it manifested in adultery but seen her taking a bath and there's the negligence now she just forgot to pull the shades down when she was taking her bath and know that the that King made a trip there by there every day down over that wall so fault on both sides right husbands is out fighting the battle and here you go so both out of their position see this is where sin starts Faith holds you to your position your faith faith in the word of God holds you to your position as soon as you move out of that position you're free game for the devil because you stepped out from behind God's will now this this is not some choices are temporary some choices are permanent okay you decide to cut your ear off it's pretty Permanent Choice but so sometimes in our lives we we we we come to face things and we can say well you know we can look at the will of God and say oh this is just you know um big big stuff and and but you can slip out and slip back in that fast you you can you can you can step out and say there there's something crosses your path for a split second then you step back into to your position you're fighting it right you're fighting it as soon as your flesh pulls you and there's that moment you step back you say God forgive me right you just steep out and steep back in and that's what you have to constantly do is keep the chaos in order now if if if the chaos is stronger than the order well then you know whole cities fall off into the ocean right uh what was that Island uh several years ago I was a kid when it happened the whole island Sri Lanka it was got wiped off the map basically with a big tsunami look chaos took over that's a natural example but the Earth is manifesting the sin because the Earth has fallen fell with the sin so the Earth is manifesting groaning and travailing right so the effects of of of the sin on the earth you got the flood just threw everything in into chaos but order so when chaos is stronger than order then chaos prevails but if order can hold its position now how do you hold position now see we're not dsts or we're not yin-yang and all that kind of stuff we are we are Sons and Daughters of God but this principes still apply because the devil can't create so the Dost yinyang all that came from somewhere see they just robbed it of God and twisted it and made it perverted but you see God gave us the flesh but he gave us a soul now the greatest Paradox to me is the son or daughter of God bringing flesh into control that cannot be done outside of the Holy Spirit yeah so God provided this way and he provided this choice that we could make to to we could either pick from the Tree of knowledge or the tree of Faith righteousness life right it's like the black dog and the white do dog whichever one we're feeding okay so are we feeding chaos or are we feeding order are we are we feeding the the spirit of the Soul within us and and then are we looking at at the problems as are we looking at the things that the devil brings to us and and are we saying oh I need to I need to throw that away you don't throw sin away because you can't sin isn't a substance you can't throw it in the trash sin isn't like trash you pick up and throw sin is is something's missing you see we were created with a spot for faith when I say faith I'm talking about capital F talk about Christ we were created with a spot for that and every human being drives to fill that void they always have a choice that everyone has a choice and they drive to feel that void now if you drive to fill that void with Christ you are satisfied you are hungry for more but you're satisfied you there's peace there's hunger and there's thirst like you know we we we we always need water but we're not dehydrated we're thirsting we're we're we're always hungry but we're not dying of starvation but knowledge on the other hand a tree of knowledge of good and evil evil more specifically doesn't ever satiate you're you're never you're always hungry you're always thirsty and you're dying of dehydration and you can cons consume as much as you want and you'll still be slowly wasting away right but you had but the the choice is there so the best way to fight the the things in our lives we we we wish weren't there is more faith because faith is is belief the footsteps of a righteous man or ordered of the Lord say God any more Direction in my life are you feeding the thing that brings you direction see many times you say well you know I've prayed about it and I've thought about it and I just I'm not hearing an answer meanwhile we we're feeding this side we're feeding the tree of knowledge some of it's good right it's a knowled tree of knowledge of Good and Evil but it's not the Tree of Life you see good good good is is good but it ain't going to make you Victorious right so praise the Lord now in the the day on Calvary he says and sin did not start on Earth sin started in heaven Lucifer the devil was a condemned creature for his Disobedience so we're looking at where where does start and and and defining defining sin and in the same time defining Faith right these are the the battle of the twins Esau Jacob Cain Abel uh um uh Sarah and and um Hagar ishmail and Isaac right Children of the free woman Children of the Bond woman the wheat the tears the True Vine the false Vine it's the battle of the Twins and this is where it started it started in heaven When sin was born When sin happened and it happened because of Lucifer's Disobedience before he ever struck the Earth sin began in heaven where God put the angels and so forth you see but Lucifer would have never disobeyed if he had had faith in God Disobedience to God in our lives comes from our lack of faith how do we get more faith Faith cometh by hearing the word of God sin began in heaven where God put the angels and so forth upon the same basis that he put human beings on knowledge the tree of knowledge the tree of life and the tree of knowledge where man could take his choice you know what I goofed up that was supposed to say life that's why I didn't look right but it's Faith it's the same thing the Tree of Life tree of knowledge where man could take his choice and when Lucifer was given the preeminence to make his choice he wanted something better than God had that started the trouble something better which really isn't better but let me back up here he said where God put the angels and so forth upon the same basis that he put human beings on knowledge so God put them on this basis of knowledge and they had a they there was a choice that had to be made and and and Lucifer you see God knew this was going to happen he he planned it this way because he needed chaos character is a victory not a gift right you see you we can you say well I just can't wait to get to glory and to to shed this robe with flesh um start utilizing it your flesh is a tool when you face opposition use it to your advantage when when when you face with with a battle sharpen your sword don't say oh man I just I just wish I didn't have this flesh no it's that attitude towards it that is causing you to be in that position God's trying to to push you say look son you got to get this through your head you need to overcome it see God doesn't want to save you he wants you to overcome he's coming back for though the Overcomers by the blood of the lamb and the word of the testimony they overcame so God's not here to pull you out or pull you through he's here to give you the guidance and the leadership you need to overcome but if we look at it through a victim mentality as oh the flesh has attacked me the devil's at me again oh the cares of life oh the world is so dark oh Hunter of Biden and China and all this stuff I better get another AK we're looking at it all wrong as the world descends into greater chaos the bride ascends into more order why because we need a lot of chaos to get out of here you're going to take a plane and you're going to take off take a little tiny CES the 150 okay tiny plane I me me and brother Trevor would be like this you take off hey no problem now you get you get those big jets that have the the what in the under the wings they've got like eight 16 wheels eight on each side and a couple in the front and the back forget what they are massive cargo planes it takes a lot of engine and a lot of speed and a lot of flaps to get that thing off the ground but what more of an accomplishment when that thing lifts into the air than when a tiny CES 150 lifts into the air I'm going to lose my analogy if I don't end it soon so chaos is needed to increase the engine power of order right you need more wind to get the plane off the ground you say wind that wind is terrible no wind doesn't let you you have to have wind to fly you have to have opposition right okay what makes a great boxer opponents defeated opponents what establishes a kingdom above the others defeated opponents so you aren't down low because your flesh you know because of the Fallen state of humanity now you're down low because you stopped fighting you you you you let sin you let sin you you you you stopped you stopped feeding from the Tree of Life and as that life Departed sin took over because sin is a byproduct of no faith because sin is unbelief all right Exodus 12:13 and we're closing soon and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt so the children of Israel had a choice and they were given um an equation and the equation was kill a lamb roast his flesh take some hisop and paint blood on your doorposts that was the equation now the way God works because God is in math as soon as you take one of those things out of the equation you get a completely different answer you'll come to an answer but it's a completely different answer if I give you know let's keep this simple so I don't get lo I don't uh make a fool myself but if I give my daughter an equation to to multiply 2 * 6 and she substitutes 6 for four she'll arrive at an answer she will have solved the equation but it's not the answer I wanted I wanted 12 God wanted them to pass over he wanted them to cross over now if you think about it yeah God used this as a um this was brought on because of the of pharaoh and he wanted to take his first born but none of the other plagues involved Goan why this one wh why did why did God want to use this to test because it was time for them to say to to make a choice either I'm going to follow God or I'm not because I am sure there were those who thought it was absolutely goofy to put blood on their doors and they didn't and then they laughed at everybody else it had to be there folks look at Noah I mean look at look at just history in general and a Christian takes the word of God there is something there to mock it it's chaos mocking order right hey we got to figure it out look just come over here be as crazy and wild as you want anytime you want without any consequences but so so here they are with the blood now they have a choice to make and now you say well the blood saved them and the blood of Jesus Christ saves you but you would never do that without faith you would never say I'm going to fill the void I'm going to pass over and I'm going to take this equation from God I'm going to take this path from God you would never ever do that if you didn't have faith in God so God said look you're about to go off across the desert and do all this stuff and face all these trials I need to sh I need you to make a commitment I need you to say I'm going to have faith because they would have never done it they wouldn't have done it and some of them didn't do it because they lacked Faith because there had to be that that element to show them that is what happens when you don't listen to God so obedience brought them over they overcame they passed over you want to pass over the river Jordan into the promised land to live a life for Christ full of the Holy Ghost you have to take this same equation the lamb the sacrifice Faith which is his s the blood of Jesus Christ it's the same thing but you see the very origins of righteousness say oh I want to be righteous the very origins of that is faith in God so God has to then prove himself to you in a way not that we're standing here saying prove it to me God no God comes along and he shows you he shows you you can believe in him he builds your faith you see that's the Paradox of it right we have a choice but at the same time God chose you you didn't choose god brother bom says now that sounds like an absolute hypocrisy total look you just contradicted yourself both ways but you still have a choice and God doesn't force you to make the choice but he gives you what you need to make the choice he leads you he guides you he says look I think this is better over here I know this is better over here so he guides you that way and your faith in him as your Shepherd you say okay you go that way right say well if God says it's better over there then it's better over there the greatest mistakes I see in people's life is when they say oh no that can't be any good look at look at how it looks you know that person's got to be making mistakes and you want to grab them by the collar and say have you asked God have you even I almost took a part two of the morphism of Christianity and said what and TI subtitled it what happened to prayer you can never pray too much I I heard you know we use our car you can't has this feature feature I call it a bug um that you can't start the car and not have the radio turn on it's just weird it will happen so we have it tuned to 88.1 I think this Rejoice radio right very conservative and um a lot of times and I think this is where our pastor gets it too because he's always talking about what these denominational preachers are saying a lot of times it's a preacher I'm like hey this is pretty good so I listened to it for a second and this man was talking about prayer and and he's talking about you know praying without ceasing and and he he I should have grabbed it but I didn't cuz I forgot about it but the Lord's bringing it to my remembrance now he he references this man who wrote this thing and and and I'll I I will I will butcher it but I'm going to give it a try anyways and and we'll find it later together he says this man writes this thing on prayer and he says I I I the other day I went to do my daily prayer and I looked at will my my self- will and I said will are you ready to go to prayer and will says I am if you are so me and will got up and went to go to our closet for prayer and all of our emotions begin to the emotions began to pull back and and suddenly suddenly I I was tired and suddenly I had all of these things and I was unhappy and and but me and will we went to prayer anyways and we drugg the emotions along and as me and will were praying I I suddenly found one of my emotions out playing golf on the golf course and I had to go get him and bring him back a few minutes later one of my emotions was was was out building a tractor I had to go get him and say look we're not doing that right now we're praying with Will so I came back to Will and we begin to pray some more and if you had to ask me when I finished did you have a good time I would have had to say no I didn't my emotions were all over the place but then the next day came and I looked at will and said will are you ready to go for our daily prayers and will says I am if you are and I said okay let's go so we drug emotion along now emotions would kep crazy again and I had to go back and Wrangle them up and bring them back together and if you would have asked me when I finished did you have a good time I would have had to give you the answer no I didn't now as this went on day after day within a couple of weeks something happened me and will we're discussing about ready to go through our daily prayer and as we begin to we looked to emotions we begin to walk away emotions looked at each other and said you know what we might as well just go along cuz they're going to do it anyways so they came along willingly and then another week or so later something happened I me and will had decided it was time for our daily prayer we went to prayer in our closet and and one of the emotions you know they by that point they were coming along Free Will and they were there they were never you know real good players in the game they're there begrudgingly but they knew hey they didn't have a choice so they sat around while we prayed and and suddenly one of the emotions got got a little bit a little excited and said Hallelujah and all the rest of them said amen and if you would asked me now did I have a good time I would have to say yes and how true that is prayer takes work but if we can look our self-will in the face and you say look today we're going to go to prayer and your self-will answers back and says yes let's go don't let your emot emotions rule you you rule your emotions that's why we can't just serve God based on how we feel because our emotions are going to feel all kinds of things because our emotions are grounded where in our flesh but will is down on our soul the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak so next time it's time for your daily prayers just drag emotion along and one day they'll catch Revelation too and you the the the the Life of Christ the faith that will raise within you will put those emotions and they'll start to say amen hallelujah as you seek God In Prayer you see we look at prayer all wrong it's not it's not this thing where where we just we just go and we just talk it's it even fails me on how to explain it it's it's this time where where we just we have to just do it we we we just you you have to do it you have to go pray you you cannot live without it and and I begin to think on these lines from the this this preacher and I thought I imagine myself future self and I thought who would I be if I prayed like I should what kind of what kind of atmosphere will we have in the church Wednesday or Sunday if we all prayed like we should what's holding us back what's holding us back we all have something that's holding us back we can chalk it up to not enough time or or or this that or the other we could figure out something but then our emotions will be giving us excuses but God said lamb sacrifice Faith blood brother man preach a message called the token that's it right there the only way to bring your flesh into subject to go pray regardless of how you feel is an increase of Faith because if you have belief if you have righteousness you will fight against unbelief you will fight against chaos stronger than you ever have before when you realize it's just a lack of something I just need more not don't start going and get you need to you need to rip this out no when someone comes to the Lord don't hand them a skirt and say okay now go put this on no just watch the word feed them sometimes sometimes we have to cover modesty right it's part of the word of God the Bible says a a woman shall not wear what that which pertaining to a man so it has to be talked about but it takes Revelation for it to manifest on the outside it takes Revelation you see I I'll say this in closing if I can close there's such an atmosphere right now it takes Revelation for order to bring chaos under control it takes Revelation for for what's inside of here to bring your flesh in subjection so you literally need a revelation to go to prayer every time you do do you guys know what Revelation is revelation is Faith do you realize it's actually very simple Lucifer son of the morning fell from Grace because he stopped believing in God each of us fall from time to time because we stopped having faith in God because we got weak because we stopped feeding Faith because because because but if we could anchor ourselves on the truth what does the scripture say know the truth and the truth shall set you free why because truth all truth comes from God and if it comes from God it's God's word and if it's God's word it's Loos and if it's Loos it's God's life and if it's God's life it is Faith for I am how's that scripture go the victory that overcomes the world the blood of Jesus Christ The Plan of Redemption the fall of Adam and Eve everything was so that you could be where you are today and God could give you what you need so you could bring flesh under control and as every time you do that you get a Little Bit Stronger you get a Little Bit Stronger you get a Little Bit Stronger you're the best way to get strong Progressive overload so every time you work out you add a little bit more weight you never stop adding weight now there's limits to the human body but you reach that point some lift 900 lb some lift 1,50 some lift 1100 lb but God puts you underneath a load over time to constantly increase your faith so he gives you the word of God to give you the faith and he gives you the battle to test your faith because then if you put your faith you say oh I got it I believe it God immediately puts you to test the faith why because then that Faith becomes a revelation you say wow yes I know right the first time you do something you never done before for and you do it you know as a kid there was this there was this rope swing at this people's house and I don't know how big the cliff was I was a little kid but it looked like it was about three stories and this rope swung you out over the edge and back onto the cliff on the other side when I finally did it the Elation the the the the wow I did it right you you couldn't you couldn't take that from me when once you live it once you live the vision of Christ you live out faith and God says look if you just pray and believe I'll heal you and God heals you nobody can take that from you and next time sin comes knocking on your door you can say look I'm sorry but God already healed me once and so I know he can do it again but it takes iterations of that it takes that over time so that's why God put us in time we see nothing is out of order chaos is present but God's in control God is controlling everything time is a tool in his hands amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus thank you for your the word tonight Lord thank you for speaking to My Heart Lord if if we could just remember when we have these moments where we maybe get more upset than we should or whatever it would be the flesh chaos takes control if we would just realize we don't need to get rid of the bad attitude we need to get more of the good attitude we need to get more of the faith help us to to to Really take a hold of that so that when we get up in tomorrow or before we go to bed tonight we would say you know what there's battles coming I'm going to pray I'm going to read my Bible bble I'm going to listen to the sermons of brother brandom I'm going to feed on the word of God and we would be fighting the battle on the offense rather than the defense and we would no longer feel uh things out of control and we would begin to com uh progress forward and and begin to see the word of God and and have a relationship with you like we've never had before Lord Jesus just it's by your grace and your grace only we can't manufacture this we can't just we can't make this up we can't without you so we're asking you to come and Lord when you remind us because you always do help us to listen help us to make the decision to go to prayer to read to feed to come to church to to do what you're calling us to sometimes that's the battle sometimes the battle isn't to do devotions or not sometimes the battle is doing what you want us to do but we're afraid to take the step because we don't trust you enough strengthen us for the choices in our future Lord strengthen us so so we're paying attention we're listening or we're we're we're we're we're waiting for that still Small Voice to come and speak it for the decisions we have to make thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord for your word thank you for for who you are thank you for calling us thank you for giving us Revelation thank you for for Redemption thank you for grace and mercy help us Lord to take what you've done to us and impart it to our
