[31:04] bring up a couple little things i just
[31:07] sincerely desire your prayers
[31:10] there is
[31:12] um
[31:13] some things that have transpired in this
[31:15] week
[31:16] um that
[31:19] very heavy burden upon my heart and
[31:23] you know sometimes the the lord
[31:27] you might say he reaches outside of this
[31:29] pasture
[31:31] and desires for us to
[31:33] to
[31:35] you might say
[31:37] um
[31:37] carry or enter into burdens to needs and
[31:41] and uh just have some very heavy
[31:44] very heavy uh burdens upon my heart i
[31:47] just uh desire your prayers amen
[31:50] i'd like to speak to you tonight god
[31:52] bless you thank you
[31:54] beautiful beautiful song service
[31:57] uh
[31:59] i would like to speak to you this
[32:00] evening our position of strength
[32:03] and uh i'd like to just bring this as
[32:06] just an encouragement
[32:08] we're not going to talk about how you
[32:09] get into that strength because you see
[32:13] it's already
[32:14] been delivered to us
[32:16] we don't have to say now i'm i'm going
[32:18] to go become a strong christian
[32:21] we'll to the very end lord willing in a
[32:24] quote we'll we'll kind of tie that in
[32:27] but my brother and sister you see
[32:29] the
[32:31] doctrines you might say of the message
[32:33] are important are they not
[32:37] but remember
[32:38] the theme song
[32:40] that the prophet had i've been reading
[32:42] and i've been studying and i i just
[32:44] can't get over
[32:45] how
[32:47] deep
[32:48] brother branham's theme song
[32:50] really means to us
[32:53] as he
[32:54] tried to present it to us not forcing us
[32:58] to take his theme song as our theme song
[33:02] but to realize just how important it is
[33:05] to just only believe
[33:10] i don't have answers
[33:12] neither do i
[33:14] but i believe in the one who does
[33:18] i might bear sickness within my body
[33:22] and i've gone to doctors and i've taken
[33:25] my vitamins and my pills and this and
[33:28] that
[33:30] but i serve the one
[33:31] who made this body
[33:34] and i believe him
[33:36] when he said i am your healer
[33:40] i believe him
[33:42] and we could go on and take the whole
[33:44] service just touching on each one of
[33:47] these
[33:48] and i don't think it's
[33:50] necessary but it really comes down my
[33:53] brother and sister that we just have to
[33:55] believe
[33:57] we've already been given
[34:00] the position of strength
[34:03] because you say well i'm so weak that's
[34:05] right
[34:06] he said when you're weak i'm strong
[34:10] now this isn't you know there's marital
[34:12] relationship that that oftentimes we see
[34:15] this happen and and when one spouse is
[34:17] very strong in a situation the other one
[34:20] needs that strength and they counter
[34:22] balance each other but you'll notice
[34:24] that god never said now when you're
[34:27] strong
[34:28] you'll cover my weakness
[34:31] no no no
[34:32] no no
[34:35] he said just be weak
[34:38] be weak just lay yourself down
[34:42] realize i can't do this
[34:45] but
[34:46] the christ
[34:48] the anointed one see it's not about
[34:51] let's just oh jesus christ my brother
[34:53] and sister he wants to be the anointed
[34:55] one
[34:57] and we're the one you might say in our
[34:59] own life that's here to anoint him
[35:03] oh remember that little lady that come
[35:05] in
[35:06] poured out the oil
[35:08] on our lord jesus's feet
[35:11] brother branham uses her as an example
[35:13] sometimes about the christians of the
[35:15] day who would never be able to dry his
[35:18] feet with their hair because they'd have
[35:19] to stand on their head
[35:24] this is an amazing god provided
[35:26] everything she needed to do
[35:29] and provided the lamb
[35:31] and the lamb was right there
[35:33] no one else wanted to acknowledge the
[35:35] lamb
[35:37] so do you realize this is two sides to
[35:39] look at this story
[35:42] god provided her deliverance
[35:47] and she
[35:49] provided
[35:50] the true anointed worship that should
[35:53] have been in that house
[35:57] see how god always balances this out
[36:00] said not only am i going to let her find
[36:03] redemption for her soul
[36:06] i'm going to let her of all people
[36:09] be the one
[36:11] who worships me
[36:13] see all the fine
[36:15] finery
[36:17] sophistication wealth position
[36:21] couldn't worship him
[36:22] let's never get lifted up church
[36:25] let's remain humble before our lord
[36:28] psalms the 18th chapter
[36:30] the first three verses
[36:34] will lay down the foundation of
[36:38] what
[36:39] what this really stirs in my heart
[36:41] tonight
[36:46] now we see different
[36:51] ways that the scripture is laid out
[36:53] we're actually going to skip right down
[36:55] to the end he said
[37:00] and he said i will love thee oh lord
[37:05] my strength
[37:07] a great acknowledgement that there was
[37:10] no great man
[37:11] who was a ruler of a kingdom a great man
[37:15] that was honored amongst the people and
[37:18] cherished
[37:20] he's speaking now i will love thee
[37:26] oh lord my strength
[37:28] the lord is my rock right that's the
[37:30] foundation
[37:32] and my fortress and my deliver
[37:37] my god
[37:39] my strength in whom i will trust
[37:43] my buckler and the horn of my salvation
[37:46] and my high power which is
[37:49] a refuge
[37:52] i will call upon the lord who is worthy
[37:55] to be praised that's why that's
[37:58] i just have to say
[38:01] the song touched me and maybe slightly
[38:03] different fashion than it would touch to
[38:05] you i believe the same but just another
[38:07] little
[38:08] little touch because of what we're
[38:10] thinking tonight
[38:12] it's worthy to be praised saints
[38:15] worthy for us to break all the barriers
[38:17] of i am tired
[38:20] i'm weary i'm discouraged i'm this i'm
[38:23] that and lift hands
[38:25] to give praise to him
[38:27] this is not about well i don't want to
[38:30] be conspicuous forget those anointings
[38:32] that the devil would throw out
[38:35] what will people think who cares what
[38:37] people think
[38:40] nobody's going to come back after the
[38:41] rapture and go to their neighbor and say
[38:43] now what do you think
[38:47] it's time for us to just think about
[38:49] what god thinks
[38:50] and say lord all i care about is what
[38:52] you think
[38:55] i will call upon the lord who is worthy
[38:58] to be praised so shall i be saved
[39:02] from mine enemies do you realize in the
[39:05] context of this sentence
[39:08] it is in this activity
[39:11] david's making a declaration in this
[39:14] activity so shall i be saved from my
[39:16] enemies in other words i'm going to have
[39:17] to call on him
[39:19] and i'm going to have to give him praise
[39:21] and i'm going to have to be the one who
[39:23] opens my mouth and declares him to be my
[39:26] rock to be my fortress to be my
[39:28] deliverer to be my god be my strength we
[39:32] can't hold that in and be as it were the
[39:34] secret believer god wants to hear
[39:38] our voice
[39:40] god doesn't want a silent bride he wants
[39:42] a bride that's willing to tell him
[39:45] you know in the natural you know a man
[39:48] likes to hear
[39:49] you know that that uh thank you honey
[39:52] for for laboring for me thank you lord
[39:54] for being a provider i'm to the husband
[39:57] i mean and and thank you for these
[39:59] things that are done
[40:02] there's a little boy in every one of us
[40:03] and
[40:04] although we recognize it might be our
[40:06] responsibility to haul out the trash we
[40:08] like to also be thanked
[40:13] for hauling out the trash
[40:15] did you hear that wives
[40:19] but it's your job it is
[40:22] but you know how
[40:26] antagonized you are when it doesn't
[40:28] happen
[40:32] god's not antagonized my brother and
[40:34] sister when we don't give praise to him
[40:37] actually his heart is broken
[40:40] then all that he's done
[40:42] has no more response
[40:45] than that
[40:47] heavenly father we ask for your
[40:48] blessings on the word this evening
[40:51] lord ask you to lead us guide us
[40:53] strengthen us in your precious name amen
[40:56] you may be seated
[40:58] i forgot to give this little preliminary
[41:00] announcement
[41:02] um
[41:04] april 30th is a saturday
[41:07] and 39 years ago it was a saturday
[41:11] and uh sister jerry and i will slip off
[41:14] for a couple days to celebrate our
[41:16] anniversary
[41:18] and i'd like to say it's been 39 years
[41:21] of wedded bliss
[41:23] but um
[41:25] praise the lord she had no clue who she
[41:27] was marrying 39 years ago
[41:30] and uh but it's been good god is
[41:32] gracious and so we covet your prayers
[41:35] brother chris will be ministering this
[41:38] coming sunday amen
[41:40] now as we look at this i just want to
[41:42] call your attention
[41:44] that as we look at this my brother and
[41:46] sister we need to identify with these
[41:49] words they shouldn't just be words that
[41:51] we read and say okay that was good uh
[41:54] david you know he spoke those words
[41:57] that's wonderful we need to identify
[42:00] with these words now to say amen to
[42:04] every word of god right the prophet of
[42:06] god now we can choose different ways but
[42:08] there's basically six different ways the
[42:10] prophet of god uh uh speaks this and my
[42:13] brother and sister he says one of the
[42:15] identifications of having the holy ghost
[42:18] is to say amen to every word of god now
[42:22] we would think that a person could just
[42:24] simply impersonate saying amen to every
[42:28] word of god but let's just look at
[42:30] baptism just quickly the two-thirds of
[42:33] the christian world or more actually
[42:36] could not say amen to acts 2 38. now
[42:39] they put it in a context of yes that's
[42:42] scripture that's beautiful but they
[42:43] don't act upon it so amen means so be it
[42:47] which is also part of the equation of us
[42:50] acting on the word so it's there that we
[42:53] realize that to say amen to every word
[42:57] of god you're going to have to have the
[42:59] holy ghost
[43:00] it's not going to be no educated person
[43:03] my brother and sister it's going to be
[43:05] the anointing of god himself on you so
[43:09] to identify with that word you're going
[43:12] to have to say amen to it so i just pray
[43:14] that the lord just comes and moves upon
[43:16] us and stirs our heart day by day that
[43:20] we don't simply say amen have you ever
[43:22] sat in church and because 932 other
[43:24] people said amen you said amen
[43:29] never right because you never sat in a
[43:30] church with 932 people
[43:33] how about with 50
[43:37] people do that my brother and sister
[43:39] people say amen to the word
[43:42] oh my you're going to draw me into a
[43:45] i have set in services
[43:48] where men spoke from the pulpit of the
[43:50] church they were in things that were
[43:53] absolutely contrary to the bible and
[43:57] shocked
[43:59] that half a church says amen to that
[44:02] see sometimes people don't realize what
[44:04] they're saying amen to that's why it's
[44:06] our responsibility to get into the word
[44:09] right and to study to show ourselves
[44:12] approved is not a equation if i'm going
[44:15] to be a preacher it is my brother and
[44:17] sister part of that well done my good
[44:19] and faithful servant is to study the
[44:22] word that you know what to say amen to
[44:26] because it is real it's the holy ghost
[44:28] speaking through you to you amen etc so
[44:31] as you look at that we we need to find a
[44:34] place that we fully identify with the
[44:38] word of god now my brother and sister if
[44:40] we're sitting here tonight and we are
[44:42] you might say upset or have some little
[44:44] root of something taking place because
[44:46] god hasn't healed you then you are not
[44:49] in harmony with the word amen if you
[44:52] don't believe god is your provider
[44:54] tonight then you are not in harmony with
[44:58] the word and this goes on down to the
[45:00] list of the things that are natural or
[45:02] normal to humanity
[45:04] that if we find ourselves uh you might
[45:07] say uh roughed up over things that we
[45:10] think god should have done now you want
[45:12] an example i'll just throw you one real
[45:14] quick here the prophet of god goes to
[45:16] pray for that little girl and she dies
[45:18] and brother branham goes back and tells
[45:20] god you owe me an apology
[45:23] now god didn't say oh my i'm sorry
[45:28] no what did god do
[45:30] just let him set
[45:32] brother branham uses the word himself i
[45:35] think moped or something of that nature
[45:38] so he's over there just
[45:40] god owes me an apology
[45:43] but in the meantime you'll notice that
[45:44] god had given him a vision
[45:47] and in the context of that when he comes
[45:50] to pray for a child he knows something's
[45:53] wrong
[45:56] now see how this is he doesn't come back
[45:58] and say okay now that's two strikes lord
[46:01] no
[46:02] he realizes the fault is in himself
[46:05] he realizes his ability to pray for the
[46:07] child and see the supernatural take
[46:09] place in that child is not upon him as a
[46:14] man but it's all upon the lord jesus
[46:16] christ and him being in the right
[46:18] position to be the conduit
[46:21] and so as the word was manifest god is
[46:23] working in our life and so we have to
[46:26] come and there would be times you know i
[46:28] wish sometimes except for if it was me
[46:30] but i wish sometimes that people would
[46:32] just really really
[46:34] realize how strongly their thoughts are
[46:37] projected how their their resistance to
[46:42] what is preached or the circumstance how
[46:44] that it would rise up because it would
[46:47] cause a lot of people to behave
[46:49] differently when they realize they're
[46:51] not pushing against the preacher he
[46:52] might feel it but you're actually
[46:54] pushing against god
[46:56] and so it's there that we want to be
[46:58] able to say amen to every word with
[47:01] freedom with liberty that's why we
[47:04] should be praying lord show us guide us
[47:07] lord i'm coming to church hungry tonight
[47:09] because i want you to show if there's
[47:11] something wrong with my life or in my
[47:14] household as it were the circumstances
[47:17] surrounding because lord i want to be
[47:19] closer to you i want to be right and so
[47:22] that's the thing about us coming to a
[47:24] place that we must identify with the
[47:26] word and you say but i live maybe a
[47:28] household where you know not everyone's
[47:30] a believer and there's certain spirits
[47:32] that are there god's already provided
[47:34] for you amen god's provided the way for
[47:37] you he's given you that stalwart solid
[47:40] grasp on the word that these spirits of
[47:42] unbelief would not
[47:44] wipe you or wash you away amen
[47:47] hallelujah you see because this word my
[47:49] brother and sister now this is going to
[47:51] be hard because sometimes my wife says
[47:53] well i think you've got a grumpy spirit
[47:55] on you
[47:56] you know
[47:57] i i just say that in humor tonight so
[48:00] don't don't get too you know because
[48:02] it's like oh smile paul
[48:05] you can do it
[48:08] now i know that doesn't happen in your
[48:09] house
[48:13] but you see we're right here in the 18th
[48:16] chapter of psalm again
[48:17] and we want to go down to the 29th verse
[48:20] and just
[48:21] take an example of what david's
[48:23] experience
[48:24] of saying amen to the word and acting
[48:26] upon the word and professing the
[48:29] position that god is in his life he was
[48:33] not without uh struggles
[48:36] he had children that wanted to overthrow
[48:38] him he made mistakes concerning the
[48:40] kingdom god had to chastise him he had
[48:44] uh relationships that god said you know
[48:47] what you're going to pay a heavy price
[48:50] for this relationship but god didn't
[48:52] cast him out
[48:54] he knew then that how much god loved him
[48:57] because his relationship was such as it
[49:01] were that it should have been the finish
[49:03] of david's ministry as it were or his
[49:07] leadership in the kingdom it should have
[49:09] been the finish but god said i love you
[49:11] so much david but david
[49:15] you're going to pay
[49:16] a heavy
[49:18] price for this
[49:21] well i'll tell you what my brother and
[49:22] sister i i pray the blood of jesus
[49:24] christ covers every bad decision we ever
[49:27] made
[49:28] but i tell you what's more important
[49:30] than that i'm not justifying that side
[49:32] of it but i'm telling you what's more
[49:33] important that god loves us
[49:36] because we could say i'm trying to do my
[49:37] very best i don't do nothing so that i
[49:40] don't make a mistake that's a mistake
[49:42] we're supposed to project jesus christ
[49:46] and we don't always do a real good job
[49:48] do we there's times we open our mouth
[49:51] and we wish we'd have just kept our
[49:53] mouth shut because we seem to be
[49:54] blundering along
[49:56] but god is gracious now look at psalms
[49:59] 29
[50:00] 18 29
[50:02] for by thee now david still in my
[50:05] opinion kind of prophesying his natural
[50:08] position and his spiritual position
[50:11] you see because you can't have a divide
[50:14] my brother and sister between your
[50:16] natural position and your spiritual
[50:18] position
[50:19] you can't say i'm filled with the holy
[50:21] ghost and be a bank robber
[50:24] you can't be the biggest liar in the
[50:26] church and say i've got the holy ghost
[50:29] there is a direct interconnection
[50:32] with
[50:34] the carnal flesh man and the spirit
[50:38] otherwise we have to go find us a two
[50:40] soul church and there's not one in the
[50:42] valley that i know of so we'd have to go
[50:43] start one
[50:46] but we'd probably find a few people that
[50:48] would come with us
[50:50] than happy to rob banks by day and go to
[50:52] church by night
[50:55] but look what he says
[50:57] all the david's problems have come upon
[50:59] him but he comes along and says for by
[51:01] thee i have run through a troop
[51:05] and by my god have i leaped over a wall
[51:09] hallelujah every one of his enemies he
[51:12] was not cut down by them he was not
[51:15] hamstrung by them but he ran through
[51:18] them left every single bit of the carnal
[51:22] every bit of those things that were
[51:24] afflicting him and yet there was more to
[51:26] come right it cost him he never got to
[51:28] build the tabernacle my brother and
[51:30] sister because of decisions that he made
[51:33] and things that happened and he knew
[51:35] that in his old age but yet there was
[51:38] still a something that gripped his heart
[51:41] because he knew the love of god
[51:43] he knew that god had declared as it were
[51:46] that he was a man after god's own heart
[51:49] maybe god didn't speak those direct
[51:50] words right to david but there was that
[51:53] assurance of who he was and because of
[51:55] that he kept running
[51:58] hallelujah he never said hey i made a
[52:01] mistake today i gotta stop and just let
[52:03] everything that's happening fall down
[52:05] because i made a mistake it's just all
[52:08] going to come to a blundering halt
[52:10] no i'm telling you why he ran
[52:13] my brother and sister he's still just
[52:16] like you and i
[52:17] day by day
[52:19] lord forgive me
[52:21] lord forgive me
[52:22] so he said i for by thee i run through a
[52:25] troop and by my god have i leaped over a
[52:28] wall as for god his way is perfect can
[52:31] we acknowledge that today
[52:33] hallelujah he didn't say his way was
[52:36] easy
[52:38] he said it was perfect
[52:40] the word of the lord is tried
[52:43] do you know my brother and sister this
[52:45] spoke to me so much do you realize as we
[52:48] read this that we read hebrews 11 of the
[52:51] saints of old
[52:53] do you realize every promise and every
[52:55] example and everything that was done in
[52:57] this bible if you and i will put forth
[53:01] the effort serving god god will do the
[53:04] magnificent supernatural incredible i
[53:08] don't know enough words tonight to
[53:10] magnify that god will do it for you
[53:12] because this is already tried
[53:14] this is not a new experimental religion
[53:17] this is not a new hey god's got
[53:19] something new on the scene let's see if
[53:21] it will work today my brother and sister
[53:24] we can take a hold of this and say if
[53:26] you need healing my god is a healer you
[53:29] need a deliverance my god is a deliverer
[53:32] there's no hope so there's no i think so
[53:35] we can say this is my absolute because
[53:39] it is a word that has been tried and
[53:42] proven
[53:43] oh thank you lord
[53:45] hallelujah
[53:47] the word of the lord is tried he is a
[53:49] buckler to all who that trust in him
[53:53] for who is god save the lord
[53:56] and who is a rock save our god
[53:59] my brother and sister
[54:01] this scripture gives us example about
[54:03] building on the rock
[54:05] now if the word of god declared that the
[54:07] storms would come we faced them haven't
[54:10] we
[54:11] has everyone that's built
[54:14] faced a storm
[54:16] aren't you glad
[54:17] you had enough revelation to build it on
[54:19] the rock
[54:21] you know
[54:23] we see people now just bear with me if
[54:25] you would we see people they build their
[54:27] house on the rock but the carport's on
[54:29] the sand
[54:30] and they're shocked when they wake up in
[54:31] the morning and the carport's gone
[54:36] now you see that's because they've tried
[54:37] to straddle
[54:40] they've tried to straddle
[54:43] and god says you know what you can't
[54:45] straddle
[54:46] so what i'm going to do is actually do
[54:48] you a favor of the things in your life
[54:51] that you are doing that will not stand
[54:54] the test i'm going to tear it down for
[54:56] you now
[54:58] can somebody say thank you lord for
[55:00] tearing it down now
[55:02] because if it won't stand the tap test
[55:04] we don't want to get all the way to the
[55:06] end
[55:07] and have it fail then i say lord judge
[55:10] us now
[55:12] judge us now lord that the foundation
[55:14] that we have built upon will stand in
[55:17] laodicea
[55:19] hallelujah
[55:21] who is a rock save our god
[55:24] it is god that girdeth me
[55:26] with strength and maketh my way perfect
[55:30] now if we're going to believe the words
[55:31] of david
[55:33] are we going to believe the words of
[55:34] david
[55:35] these words are just as tried and tested
[55:38] as the words of the apostles
[55:41] david faced things
[55:43] challenges his own lust of the flesh
[55:46] pride of life his own ego his own
[55:49] whatever
[55:50] everything that could have gotten away
[55:52] in david's life got in the way but his
[55:55] life proves that when you come to god
[55:57] sincerely
[56:00] aren't you glad we can be anointed with
[56:01] a spirit of sincerity
[56:03] we don't often hear that preached about
[56:06] the spirit of sincerity but my brother
[56:08] and sister we can go through the word of
[56:10] god and read it like a novel
[56:16] and then wonder why it doesn't work
[56:18] but a sincere approach to the word of
[56:22] god
[56:24] the prophet of god put it
[56:26] in words
[56:28] my brother and sister
[56:30] giving us the security to know that if
[56:32] we would come
[56:34] he said you know what
[56:36] whatever you're doing
[56:38] check your motive
[56:42] well i don't want to go to hell
[56:46] wrong motive
[56:52] reminds me of a story i read once about
[56:54] a king
[56:58] come to a place in his life that he so
[57:00] distrusted everyone
[57:03] kicked his own wife
[57:05] from his room
[57:07] chained the doors from within every
[57:09] single night
[57:12] because that was the only sin
[57:14] security
[57:15] that he had
[57:18] and he become angry and he become bitter
[57:22] and the more angry he become and the
[57:23] more bitter he become the more insecure
[57:25] he become
[57:28] and he got bigger chains
[57:31] and more things to keep people from
[57:33] getting in
[57:35] and a wise man come to him one day
[57:38] and said oh king can i share wisdom
[57:41] and he said share wisdom
[57:44] and he says
[57:46] you can love
[57:48] the people
[57:50] into your very heart
[57:54] and he leaves
[57:57] and the king's like i don't understand
[57:59] what he means
[58:01] but as he ponders it we'd call it
[58:03] revelation as he ponders it
[58:05] he starts to realize all the people i've
[58:07] distrusted
[58:09] they're still there
[58:12] they still love me
[58:14] and i would be secure if i would love
[58:16] them back
[58:20] very simple thought
[58:24] you see that's what god's doing
[58:27] he's loving us back
[58:29] in our own insecurities
[58:32] he's loving us back in our own weakness
[58:35] our own frailty of humanity he's loving
[58:38] us back he's wooing us to himself
[58:44] now i want to touch on verse 32
[58:47] the word girded
[58:50] you realize my brother and sister we
[58:52] talk about
[58:53] christ in us the hope of glory
[58:55] but you look at this scripture now it is
[58:57] god that girdeth me with strength
[59:01] he's wrapping
[59:03] his strength
[59:04] around us
[59:07] we could say well praise the lord i'm a
[59:09] christian now i've i've got great
[59:12] strength and you would try to rely upon
[59:14] your strength that you believe you have
[59:16] in you and you would find yourself
[59:18] failing
[59:21] but when we realized god's wrapping his
[59:23] strength around it's it's when you wrap
[59:26] we are here tonight each one of us
[59:28] clothed in in cloth and clothes of of
[59:31] different designs and whatever that that
[59:34] cloth
[59:35] does not become part of you
[59:38] i don't want to sound crass but we will
[59:39] go home tonight
[59:42] and we'll jump in our jammies and the
[59:44] nice dress and the nice uh certain tie
[59:47] or whatever that it would be it all goes
[59:50] on a hanger or goes in a hamper that
[59:52] clothes did not become a permanent part
[59:55] of you it is there wrapped around you
[59:57] and we can realize my brother and sister
[1:00:00] we have to stand and submit and let god
[1:00:03] gird us with strength
[1:00:05] we can't tell god i'm powerful i don't
[1:00:08] need this i don't need this i don't need
[1:00:10] this we've got to stand if i could
[1:00:12] demonstrate this in such a fashion we've
[1:00:14] got to stand as the tailor i had one
[1:00:17] suit tailored i think it was in my life
[1:00:19] and it was experience i wasn't real
[1:00:21] thrilled with you know
[1:00:23] you know they're there and you know the
[1:00:25] whole time they're flashing their hands
[1:00:27] the lady actually turned out to be
[1:00:28] phenomenal but do you know it's there
[1:00:31] that it's there and it's got a little
[1:00:32] bit here and a little bit there and you
[1:00:34] got to pull this there and you know you
[1:00:36] have a little bump here and we need to
[1:00:38] hide that so we're going to loosen the
[1:00:39] shirt up like this and pull it this way
[1:00:41] and do this and that is the shoulders
[1:00:43] needs to be perfect this way and the the
[1:00:46] the deal you can tell i just buy shirts
[1:00:47] off the rack now
[1:00:50] but you know the link's got to be just
[1:00:52] right actually sister jerry puts a lot
[1:00:54] of effort in
[1:00:55] for me to look halfway presentable
[1:00:58] but you see you have to stand there
[1:01:02] and when the tailor says turn
[1:01:04] you have to turn
[1:01:06] put your arms down
[1:01:08] lift your arms up
[1:01:11] do this
[1:01:13] do that
[1:01:15] even really good tailors will ask you
[1:01:17] where do you carry your wallet
[1:01:20] and they'll want the wallet to be in the
[1:01:21] pocket
[1:01:23] so that they can adjust the pocket
[1:01:26] to where it looks the same
[1:01:31] do you see it saints
[1:01:33] god says i want to make you the
[1:01:35] strongest
[1:01:36] i want to make you powerful
[1:01:39] but you're going to have to stop
[1:01:41] and stand
[1:01:43] and let me wrap
[1:01:46] myself
[1:01:48] around you
[1:01:50] and i will cover
[1:01:52] your insecurity
[1:01:54] i will cover your weakness
[1:01:58] i will cover your complex
[1:02:04] and i'll even take your strengths
[1:02:08] and i'll make it to where you recognize
[1:02:09] your strength is no longer as important
[1:02:12] as you thought your strength was because
[1:02:14] we're now wrapped what
[1:02:16] in his
[1:02:18] strength we're now wrapped in the word
[1:02:21] of god because the word is the very very
[1:02:25] heart of god it was such an expression
[1:02:28] he put it to the page that we could
[1:02:30] carry it and read it and hold it and
[1:02:32] find security in it because we're humans
[1:02:35] and those things matter to us
[1:02:38] but you see we've got to stop long
[1:02:40] enough
[1:02:42] you imagine a tailor in the natural
[1:02:44] before we move on you imagine a tailor
[1:02:46] in the natural
[1:02:47] and you'd be walking around the room
[1:02:48] maybe on your telephone and they're
[1:02:50] trying to adjust your suit and your
[1:02:52] shirt and skirt and whatever it might be
[1:02:54] and you're just uh well you know just
[1:02:57] oh i can only imagine what that would
[1:02:58] look like
[1:03:00] worse yet what it would be feel like
[1:03:03] sorry
[1:03:05] but you see
[1:03:07] to be girded with strength
[1:03:10] we have got to stop
[1:03:12] amen and if he says i hope you follow me
[1:03:15] tonight i'm not trying to force anybody
[1:03:17] to do any behavior i just have to speak
[1:03:19] my heart
[1:03:21] he's there and as the tailor says paul i
[1:03:24] want you to lift your hands because i
[1:03:26] want to see if the shirt pulls right is
[1:03:29] there enough room within the shirt
[1:03:31] sleeves and so is to lift your hands and
[1:03:33] so as a natural tailor would be there
[1:03:36] saying i need you to lift one hand
[1:03:38] another hand both hands i need you to do
[1:03:40] these things god is here tailoring his
[1:03:43] word to you and i saying i'd like you to
[1:03:45] lift your hands
[1:03:47] i'd like you to know what it feels like
[1:03:50] when you're wrapped in strength of god
[1:03:53] when you're wrapped in the word of god
[1:03:55] to be able to lift your hands and say i
[1:03:58] think lord wrapped in your word that i
[1:04:01] look good but lord i need your word of
[1:04:04] security that i truly look good
[1:04:07] otherwise it'll be in our own thinking
[1:04:09] i'm such a good believer
[1:04:11] i've been in the message
[1:04:13] as i get older just so if you guys ever
[1:04:15] see a negative reaction from me
[1:04:17] as i get older
[1:04:19] you might say i'm just going to use a
[1:04:21] very abrasive word so that anything
[1:04:24] after that will be less right it
[1:04:26] irritates me
[1:04:28] when people stand there
[1:04:30] well i've
[1:04:31] been in the message for 40 years
[1:04:35] good you've been in the message 40 years
[1:04:37] how long has the message been in you
[1:04:42] come on saints how long have you stood
[1:04:45] still
[1:04:46] and let the word of god
[1:04:48] gird you
[1:04:50] oh that's hard my brother and sister and
[1:04:52] i don't mean it to be to be abrasive
[1:04:55] but it is something that
[1:04:57] i just feel like the lord laid upon our
[1:04:59] heart that we have to realize we got to
[1:05:01] stop
[1:05:03] and we'll reaffirm that in just a little
[1:05:04] bit
[1:05:06] amen
[1:05:07] now i want to ask you
[1:05:09] saints can we trust the lord enough to
[1:05:11] claim his word as our own
[1:05:17] amen
[1:05:20] oh the religious world and the critics
[1:05:22] that all just freak out
[1:05:25] but this is my word
[1:05:28] yeah every word in this book right here
[1:05:31] is my word
[1:05:32] but you some of it's for the unbeliever
[1:05:34] right
[1:05:35] but you know why that's there
[1:05:37] it's there for you as a reminder
[1:05:40] it doesn't apply
[1:05:42] when god said it's not for the idolaters
[1:05:44] we're not idolaters so it doesn't apply
[1:05:45] to us but it reminds us we don't want to
[1:05:48] fall under a spirit of idolatry
[1:05:50] it reminds us of the things we don't
[1:05:52] want to do kind of like you know i
[1:05:54] remember one time years ago i got pulled
[1:05:56] over for speeding and uh and the man i
[1:05:59] happen to know him and that makes it
[1:06:01] worse
[1:06:03] and he says so
[1:06:05] paul why was you driving too fast on
[1:06:07] this road that you drive all the time
[1:06:12] and you know human nature i hope you
[1:06:14] don't want to vote me out over this
[1:06:16] human nature is you're going to find an
[1:06:18] excuse
[1:06:19] okay now moment of truth how many of you
[1:06:23] think first to offer up the excuse
[1:06:26] come on okay i see some heads nodding so
[1:06:29] the next step of sincerity would be your
[1:06:31] hand being lifted but anyway we'll
[1:06:33] settle for what we've got
[1:06:37] and i just looked at him and
[1:06:40] i said
[1:06:41] i don't know
[1:06:46] okay just keep it down
[1:06:48] it walks off
[1:06:52] but it was an eye-opener to me the first
[1:06:54] thoughts that rolled across
[1:06:57] was to conjure up an excuse
[1:07:03] i
[1:07:03] you know i've got um
[1:07:09] i don't know
[1:07:13] god doesn't want our excuses saints
[1:07:17] let's stop
[1:07:20] we have been
[1:07:21] girded
[1:07:23] with the strength
[1:07:25] of the word
[1:07:27] which is the holy ghost
[1:07:30] what we need
[1:07:32] is that submission
[1:07:34] not the excuse
[1:07:37] let the first anointing that comes on us
[1:07:41] be the anointing of lord you've wrapped
[1:07:43] me in strength
[1:07:45] i can do better
[1:07:47] i can do better than i don't need to
[1:07:49] offer an excuse well it's because of
[1:07:51] this i can't serve the lord it's because
[1:07:54] of this i can't serve the lord it was
[1:07:55] because of them
[1:07:58] forget that
[1:07:59] when you come face to face in that stop
[1:08:02] and just say lord you have girded me
[1:08:04] with strength and you have made my way
[1:08:07] perfect and i'm going to live that
[1:08:10] i can live that i will live that
[1:08:17] you imagine standing before god and
[1:08:19] trying to give him an original excuse
[1:08:25] wow you get a pass i've never heard that
[1:08:28] one before
[1:08:35] that's also why i believe
[1:08:37] that within the body of believers
[1:08:40] you'll find people that suffer from
[1:08:42] every single malady whether it's health
[1:08:46] emotional whatever it is you'll find
[1:08:49] people that have come from circumstances
[1:08:51] that are so
[1:08:53] dark and so deep they don't even want to
[1:08:55] talk about it in public and the reason
[1:08:58] that's going to happen my brother and
[1:08:59] sister you say but if god was such a
[1:09:01] loving god
[1:09:02] you got to understand god
[1:09:06] doesn't think like we do his ways are so
[1:09:09] much higher than our ways
[1:09:11] but i believe i'm on the right track
[1:09:13] here i don't believe i'm wrong in the
[1:09:14] fact that you're going to find in this
[1:09:16] body of believers people suffering from
[1:09:18] every malady because people will come
[1:09:20] one day and say i was molested as a
[1:09:22] child that's why i can't serve god and
[1:09:25] in the host of the believers there will
[1:09:27] be i was too i was too i was too and on
[1:09:31] right down through the line and my
[1:09:34] brother and sister that breaks our heart
[1:09:35] just even thinking about that but god oh
[1:09:38] if i could put it without sounding so
[1:09:40] based god has covered all the bases
[1:09:44] no one's going to come with an original
[1:09:46] excuse to god
[1:09:50] and so in that god has brought us to a
[1:09:53] place
[1:09:55] that we can trust him enough
[1:09:57] to say this
[1:09:59] is my word amen
[1:10:01] this is who i am
[1:10:04] and this is the life
[1:10:07] i was called
[1:10:08] to live
[1:10:10] oh my brother and sister i hope that
[1:10:11] soaks in real deep
[1:10:14] amen now let's just look in ephesians 3
[1:10:17] for just a moment
[1:10:18] now i'm just going to throw this out i
[1:10:21] had a brother challenge me with this
[1:10:22] before and i got kind of through all of
[1:10:24] it but i didn't honestly go through all
[1:10:26] of it he said have you read all of the 3
[1:10:28] 16s in the bible
[1:10:31] it's kind of interesting because you go
[1:10:33] through the bible and there's some
[1:10:34] really profound things in the third
[1:10:37] chapter and the 16th verse going on
[1:10:39] through the bible
[1:10:41] anyway just a little brain teaser you
[1:10:43] might say for you
[1:10:44] no doctrines there no must must do
[1:10:48] just kind of interesting ephesians 3 16
[1:10:52] that he would grant you according to the
[1:10:53] riches of his glory isn't this a good
[1:10:55] one
[1:10:57] to be strengthened with might by his
[1:11:00] spirit in the inner man
[1:11:03] now i tell you my brother and sister
[1:11:05] there's a lot of people around that
[1:11:07] would come very boldly in a carnal or
[1:11:09] physical realm as a believer you're
[1:11:11] gonna believe this and you'll do this
[1:11:13] and you'll do that but we're not looking
[1:11:15] for that kind of leadership are we we're
[1:11:18] looking for the leadership that skips
[1:11:20] right by this old flesh right here and
[1:11:23] moves right down by the spirit into the
[1:11:25] inner man
[1:11:27] oh if i couldn't god would grant it to
[1:11:29] me i would get you guys all just to so
[1:11:31] open up tonight that you would be
[1:11:33] vulnerable
[1:11:35] oh this sounds scary brother paul wants
[1:11:37] us to be vulnerable
[1:11:40] yes sir
[1:11:41] so that we could shovel
[1:11:43] the riches of his glory
[1:11:46] by the might of his spirit in the inner
[1:11:48] man just just to fill it up
[1:11:50] just to fill it up trust god
[1:11:53] trust god that's what he wants to do for
[1:11:56] you and i saints amen he wants to
[1:11:59] strengthen us by his spirit not
[1:12:01] intellectualism
[1:12:03] not boisterous or forceful in our
[1:12:05] personality but in the inner man in the
[1:12:08] spirit realm
[1:12:10] amen that christ may dwell in your
[1:12:12] hearts by faith that ye
[1:12:15] being rooted and grounded
[1:12:17] in doctrines
[1:12:21] we've got a problem in the message
[1:12:22] saints
[1:12:24] we getting dog fights
[1:12:27] over doctrine
[1:12:31] i've been guilty
[1:12:36] joking with brother jason in the back
[1:12:37] room
[1:12:39] it's pretty tough i mean you got to
[1:12:40] really get down and repent god
[1:12:43] when your thoughts was i'm going to kill
[1:12:44] this guy
[1:12:48] no you got i'm serious saints
[1:12:51] that might have come across a little
[1:12:52] humorous but i'm serious because we'll
[1:12:54] never have to pull a gun out we'll never
[1:12:56] have to have a knife or a hatchet or
[1:12:58] whatever it might be never see him in
[1:13:00] the crosswalk i just accidentally hit
[1:13:03] the gas
[1:13:05] then i had to back up and see if well
[1:13:07] anyway
[1:13:09] no
[1:13:10] see dwell in our hearts by faith that we
[1:13:13] being rooted and grounded in love and
[1:13:16] the prophet of god said without perfect
[1:13:18] love we won't make it anyhow i lift my
[1:13:21] hands tonight and say lord help me
[1:13:24] help me lord that i could have perfect
[1:13:26] love i don't want to just talk about it
[1:13:28] saying i wanted to captivate my life i
[1:13:30] wanted to captivate your life
[1:13:33] i wanted that we could come to a place
[1:13:36] that say i don't see it that way in the
[1:13:38] scripture or in the message that's fine
[1:13:40] brother i love you
[1:13:42] i love you and let's just keep on loving
[1:13:44] each other until the lord reveals that
[1:13:47] one or both of us is wrong
[1:13:50] don't you like that when you're in an
[1:13:52] argument
[1:13:53] and you just know they're wrong
[1:13:56] but along in the argument you realize
[1:13:58] you're wrong also
[1:14:01] man that is a that is a paradox
[1:14:04] i mean that would just cause you to stop
[1:14:06] and just go ah
[1:14:08] what
[1:14:13] may be able to comprehend with all
[1:14:14] saints what is the breadth length depth
[1:14:17] and height
[1:14:20] is this possible saints yes
[1:14:24] the word of god says
[1:14:26] i'm going to just paraphrase it
[1:14:29] before it's all over
[1:14:32] the full mystery of christ
[1:14:36] will be
[1:14:38] revealed
[1:14:41] let's start working on it
[1:14:43] amen we don't have rosaries but add it
[1:14:46] to your prayer list
[1:14:48] amen because we need to come to a place
[1:14:51] that we are not affected by the carnal
[1:14:55] spirits of this age
[1:14:58] amen
[1:14:59] and to know the love of christ right
[1:15:01] there's personal
[1:15:03] amen now i don't mean to pick on brother
[1:15:05] david but it's a very strong theme and
[1:15:07] i'm glad he carries it and it's not
[1:15:09] giving up on it and that is you must be
[1:15:11] born again you don't think that sentence
[1:15:13] says that do you
[1:15:15] but that's what it says right there and
[1:15:16] to know the love of christ ye must be
[1:15:20] born again
[1:15:22] to know the love of christ
[1:15:24] there is no way we can say i just feel
[1:15:26] so lovey i i won't go into it but i'm
[1:15:29] telling you i've interacted with people
[1:15:31] in just the last while that their idea
[1:15:34] of loving each other is that you
[1:15:36] compromise on your doctor and i'll
[1:15:37] compromise on our doctrine and we'll
[1:15:39] just come together and worship together
[1:15:41] i'm sorry my brother and sister i'm not
[1:15:43] compromising
[1:15:45] that's not love
[1:15:47] amen i gotta love this word right to
[1:15:49] have the love of christ means i've got
[1:15:51] to have an unshakable
[1:15:55] love
[1:15:56] in the word
[1:16:01] thank you
[1:16:03] amen
[1:16:04] you might be filled with the fullness of
[1:16:06] god now unto him that is able to do
[1:16:09] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[1:16:11] ask or think according to the power that
[1:16:12] worketh in us amen is there anybody here
[1:16:15] that this scripture applies to tonight
[1:16:17] amen this is a word that's a living word
[1:16:20] this is not something we dug off the
[1:16:22] shelf and knocked a layer or two of dirt
[1:16:24] off of and said oh look what this was
[1:16:26] written back in history this is living
[1:16:28] tonight saint this is the very power of
[1:16:32] god that he said i'm going to give you
[1:16:35] this power
[1:16:37] to take this word
[1:16:39] and to love when you thought it was
[1:16:41] unlovable
[1:16:42] to forgive when you thought it was
[1:16:44] unforgivable to give patience and
[1:16:47] kindness and charity to those you
[1:16:49] weren't sure were worth it
[1:16:51] now let's be honest with ourselves
[1:16:53] there's times
[1:16:54] that we've looked at people and thought
[1:16:56] man they don't even deserve grace
[1:16:58] they need judgment
[1:17:01] but you know the firing squad always
[1:17:02] works better when there's three or more
[1:17:05] and if we got our way
[1:17:08] we'd find ourselves standing next to
[1:17:09] them saying wait i was judging you
[1:17:13] why am i on the firing line
[1:17:18] come on
[1:17:20] lord help us that's all i can say saints
[1:17:22] lord help us
[1:17:24] but he said that he is able to do the
[1:17:26] exceeding abundantly all that we ask or
[1:17:28] think
[1:17:29] now i'm going to ask you are you
[1:17:30] self-limiting god
[1:17:35] i need god to do something
[1:17:40] but i'm not worthy
[1:17:44] i made a mistake this last week brother
[1:17:46] paul
[1:17:49] i made a mistake
[1:17:50] five years ago
[1:17:53] and i'm still paying the price for it
[1:17:55] today
[1:17:57] good
[1:17:58] i have found
[1:18:00] a
[1:18:01] law
[1:18:03] that pardons me
[1:18:05] no no no no i have found a love
[1:18:09] that pardons
[1:18:11] and i want to share the love of jesus
[1:18:12] christ with everybody around me because
[1:18:15] i know that what i have meted out
[1:18:19] shall be meted unto me
[1:18:24] according to the power that worketh in
[1:18:27] us become an eternal thing
[1:18:30] unto him be glory in the church by
[1:18:32] christ jesus throughout all ages world
[1:18:35] without end amen
[1:18:38] now let me just hurry along right here
[1:18:40] we'll just go right into this 1958 his
[1:18:43] wonders to perform
[1:18:45] oh if christ is presented in the right
[1:18:48] way
[1:18:52] feel free to speak out what is the right
[1:18:53] way
[1:18:57] if you don't believe i'll let me let me
[1:19:00] give you the right way circa 19
[1:19:04] 70
[1:19:06] 6.
[1:19:09] if you don't believe this message
[1:19:13] you
[1:19:14] are going to hell
[1:19:17] is that the way to present the message
[1:19:25] well
[1:19:26] it sure appears to me your serpent seed
[1:19:29] first off the denominational christian
[1:19:31] won't even know what you're talking
[1:19:32] about when you mention serpent seed
[1:19:37] and then you've just decided that you
[1:19:38] have some kind of supernatural
[1:19:41] to just know i saw your tail flicker
[1:19:45] no my brother and sister those are old
[1:19:48] denominations
[1:19:50] critical spirits that wouldn't even give
[1:19:53] the speaker into the rapture
[1:19:56] god help us
[1:19:58] god help us but god's given us a
[1:20:00] strength saint
[1:20:01] what is that strength
[1:20:03] oh let me just kind of cut a little bit
[1:20:05] to the line here that strength is to
[1:20:07] live this message day by day by day by
[1:20:12] day
[1:20:13] walking
[1:20:15] walking
[1:20:16] and people will be saying in these times
[1:20:18] that we live in in these circumstances
[1:20:20] here look at the saints in the ukraine
[1:20:23] the world my brother and sister will
[1:20:25] marvel of how a people could stand so
[1:20:27] solid on the word of god in that time
[1:20:31] it's one thing to have national pride
[1:20:32] and and there's certainly nothing wrong
[1:20:34] with loving your country but we love
[1:20:36] jesus christ way more than we love our
[1:20:38] country
[1:20:39] and we can stand in the worst of times
[1:20:42] fight for our country but fight for this
[1:20:44] gospel
[1:20:46] and how do we fight for this gospel by
[1:20:48] presenting christ in the right way
[1:20:51] the world will respect it
[1:20:54] i i'll tell you i've got a i've got a
[1:20:56] lot of friends
[1:20:59] that haven't darkened the door of a
[1:21:00] church in years haven't picked up a
[1:21:02] bible in years they acknowledge that god
[1:21:04] is real but they use him as curse word
[1:21:05] more than they speak about him in any
[1:21:07] other fashion
[1:21:10] and i know i've shared this and i don't
[1:21:11] mean to make it about me but
[1:21:13] i've walked in before when the little
[1:21:15] store was there at that time and
[1:21:17] they're all rowdy and i'd go up there
[1:21:19] and get some of that really really
[1:21:20] nutritious uh
[1:21:22] convenience store burritos you know the
[1:21:24] ones that are filled with vitamins and
[1:21:26] give you a lot of a lot of strength
[1:21:29] and you go sit down at the table and you
[1:21:31] bow your head and the table goes silent
[1:21:34] now they didn't go silent because they
[1:21:36] think you're freaking a geek and they're
[1:21:38] all staring at you they went silent
[1:21:40] because they respect
[1:21:44] praise the lord
[1:21:46] the world will respect it if there's any
[1:21:48] respect in them certainly it is if it's
[1:21:50] brought the way of divine light that
[1:21:53] night now brother brown's talking about
[1:21:54] a time and a service and a church
[1:21:56] service and a man here you'll catch that
[1:21:58] here
[1:21:59] that night when we left the church he
[1:22:01] had a lantern in his hand said i would
[1:22:04] i'd give anything parson if i could only
[1:22:06] believe that god would forgive me of my
[1:22:08] sin now we're not dealing with a guy
[1:22:11] that stole some gum
[1:22:13] out of the old country store
[1:22:16] i've killed two or three men
[1:22:20] now he's coming face to face with god
[1:22:23] knowing he's a murderer
[1:22:26] and no doubt other sins to go with it
[1:22:29] and he's struggling
[1:22:31] with something that all of us struggle
[1:22:33] with
[1:22:35] well let me put it this way all of you
[1:22:36] that have a past
[1:22:39] by god's grace some of you raise up
[1:22:41] serve god all the days of your life and
[1:22:43] you're not guilty of a lot of things
[1:22:45] but we we
[1:22:47] oh where'd this go on
[1:22:50] and i know i'm a guilty sinner but when
[1:22:52] i seen them things happen
[1:22:55] in that great big magnificent church
[1:22:59] what's wrong with the saints that we
[1:23:01] think that somehow god's more present
[1:23:04] in the bigger building
[1:23:10] god's present
[1:23:12] in his
[1:23:13] tabernacle
[1:23:15] amen
[1:23:18] he said we're two or three thousand are
[1:23:20] gathered together in my name
[1:23:23] no sir god cut it right down to the
[1:23:25] chase and made it right down into the
[1:23:27] base of simplicity that you can come
[1:23:29] where two or three are gathered in my
[1:23:31] name you know what that could be that i
[1:23:33] don't mean to lift up the preacher don't
[1:23:35] misunderstand me but that could just be
[1:23:36] the preacher and an unbeliever
[1:23:41] unbeliever this desiring god
[1:23:44] when i see them things happen in that
[1:23:45] little church i'm aware that there is a
[1:23:47] true and living god see this is part of
[1:23:49] that correct
[1:23:51] presentation
[1:23:53] that little church and the man's
[1:23:54] realizing there's a true god
[1:23:57] there's a real god
[1:24:02] will forgive you i said he will forgive
[1:24:04] you and he wants to forgive you that's
[1:24:06] something i think we overlook sometimes
[1:24:08] saying so i hope i'm not belaboring this
[1:24:10] too much but this all just spoke to me
[1:24:12] so much he once
[1:24:15] he wants saints can i say it
[1:24:19] with sincerity enough he wants to
[1:24:22] forgive us
[1:24:23] and we fight and we hide and we make
[1:24:26] excuses for why i can't come and do this
[1:24:30] and god's there saying please please
[1:24:33] just come
[1:24:35] receive it
[1:24:39] he wants to forgive you and the very
[1:24:41] hunger in your heart means that he's
[1:24:42] working on your soul
[1:24:44] isn't that beautiful
[1:24:46] now look at this
[1:24:49] he said if i could only feel it
[1:24:52] now brother brown look at this he's kind
[1:24:54] of confident isn't he
[1:24:57] you'll feel it
[1:25:01] when you get this correct
[1:25:04] you'll feel it
[1:25:07] praise god
[1:25:10] i'm such a good christian
[1:25:14] that's not the kind of strength he
[1:25:15] promised us
[1:25:18] oh no
[1:25:20] not a preacher that's like if you don't
[1:25:21] straighten up i'll come back there and
[1:25:23] slap you out in the aisle and drag you
[1:25:24] up here to the altar
[1:25:27] no no no that's not what he's looking
[1:25:28] for
[1:25:30] he's looking for a life
[1:25:32] that is such
[1:25:33] a perfect mirror
[1:25:38] that's reflecting christ back
[1:25:42] isn't that wonderful
[1:25:44] amen
[1:25:46] when i feel it
[1:25:48] i'll believe it
[1:25:50] this is a powerful line right here
[1:25:51] saints
[1:25:53] believe it
[1:25:55] and then you'll feel it
[1:25:57] people get this back i i i attended that
[1:25:59] church just didn't seem nothing happened
[1:26:01] to me uh you know i don't i don't i
[1:26:03] don't know why they have to you know
[1:26:04] them women ah this is the conversation i
[1:26:06] had right on that step one time
[1:26:08] i don't know why you'd have a woman have
[1:26:10] to not cut her hair and wear a dress
[1:26:13] i don't get it
[1:26:16] but you just told me that you have not
[1:26:18] felt the presence of god
[1:26:21] in years in a church like you felt
[1:26:25] this morning
[1:26:35] but i didn't feel it
[1:26:40] i didn't feel it
[1:26:42] all the way down here
[1:26:45] well how far do you got to feel it
[1:26:49] how far do you got to feel it saints
[1:26:52] it's the word of god
[1:26:56] believe it
[1:26:58] then you'll feel it
[1:26:59] i wished i know how to do it
[1:27:02] i said where do you live across the
[1:27:04] mountain about two miles
[1:27:06] how did you get there how do you get
[1:27:08] there
[1:27:09] up over the ridges and through the pass
[1:27:12] i said it's very dark
[1:27:14] but i got a lantern
[1:27:16] you can't see your house
[1:27:18] with your lantern
[1:27:20] no that's right
[1:27:23] then how do you know
[1:27:25] you're going to get there
[1:27:28] just take the lantern in your hand and
[1:27:30] you're standing in the light you walk in
[1:27:32] the right direction
[1:27:34] every step
[1:27:36] you make the light will light up the
[1:27:39] road
[1:27:41] i said that's the way you find christ
[1:27:44] stand in his light
[1:27:46] i want to interject this right now so i
[1:27:48] don't have to circle back
[1:27:50] you want to get strong
[1:27:52] you want to have supernatural strength
[1:27:55] get in the light
[1:27:57] walk
[1:27:58] in the light
[1:28:01] i'll just throw a personal antidote in
[1:28:03] here just because we're as good as
[1:28:05] finished
[1:28:10] from my childhood
[1:28:12] i got addicted to rock and roll
[1:28:19] and the closer i got to god
[1:28:23] the harder the battle was
[1:28:27] to deal with this
[1:28:28] i've gotten serious trouble from sisters
[1:28:30] here in this church from just making
[1:28:32] little quips about those things from the
[1:28:34] past so so i
[1:28:36] lord lord willing i'll be done forever
[1:28:38] to even bring another one of those up
[1:28:41] but you see those things come and let me
[1:28:43] just let let me just give you
[1:28:45] just a little bit of this
[1:28:48] brother paul used to be pretty good at
[1:28:50] riding a dirt bike i was an adrenaline
[1:28:51] junkie
[1:28:54] and i discovered when i was probably
[1:28:55] about 16 had my own pickup
[1:28:59] i could almost assure that i would have
[1:29:01] a wonderful day riding my bike
[1:29:04] if i listened to certain music
[1:29:06] going out to the desert
[1:29:09] and i would get out of the pickup
[1:29:11] and i would already be just
[1:29:16] oh man
[1:29:18] literally i don't want to be too graphic
[1:29:20] but i'd be pulling on my riding gear and
[1:29:22] i would literally have such an
[1:29:24] adrenaline rush
[1:29:25] just from music
[1:29:27] i didn't need any drugs
[1:29:30] i just already just
[1:29:33] and guys i rode with used to say man
[1:29:35] paul you are so weird and i tell them
[1:29:38] yeah
[1:29:39] but let's ride then i'd leave him in the
[1:29:41] dust
[1:29:42] i'd have to stop
[1:29:43] out in the middle of the desert out
[1:29:44] there and wait for him
[1:29:47] and they're like we don't know how you
[1:29:48] do it
[1:29:51] but god revealed it to me how i did it
[1:29:55] i was building my carport
[1:29:58] on the sand
[1:30:01] and the devil
[1:30:03] liked the idea that i was building my
[1:30:04] carport on the sand
[1:30:08] and he give me
[1:30:09] a strength
[1:30:13] or you followed me
[1:30:16] but you see i come one day just like all
[1:30:18] of you have had to come and
[1:30:21] some will still have to come
[1:30:23] and realize you know what
[1:30:26] the only way i'm ever going to find
[1:30:27] christ
[1:30:32] brother harold hildebrand preached a
[1:30:33] service many years ago
[1:30:36] i promise you saints i have never
[1:30:38] mistreated you that way i have never
[1:30:41] stood and stared at you the whole
[1:30:43] service
[1:30:46] that's what brother harold did to me or
[1:30:48] at least that's what i thought he did
[1:30:53] and he made a declaration over the pulp
[1:30:55] in the little church in star idaho
[1:30:59] about if you're ever going to meet
[1:31:00] christ you've got to give up everything
[1:31:03] that's an enemy to christ
[1:31:06] and i realized
[1:31:08] i was holding on to these things have
[1:31:11] you guys ever had a really really
[1:31:13] serious weekly adrenaline rush
[1:31:17] like
[1:31:18] you just had to go get it again
[1:31:22] and i didn't have to go to an alley i
[1:31:24] didn't have to go to a back street i
[1:31:26] could just go out
[1:31:28] in god's creation
[1:31:32] but it controlled my life
[1:31:36] but i come along
[1:31:37] and just like this man saying how am i
[1:31:39] going to do this
[1:31:40] just like brother brown speaking there
[1:31:42] that's why this is real to me saints
[1:31:43] that's why it stirred my heart when i
[1:31:45] read this
[1:31:46] he's telling him every step you make the
[1:31:49] light will light up the road i said
[1:31:51] that's the way you find christ you've
[1:31:53] got to get the lantern out and you've
[1:31:56] got to hold it in front of you you don't
[1:31:58] hold that lanyard behind you you don't
[1:32:00] leave it in the trail you hold it out
[1:32:03] and you let it shine the light on what's
[1:32:05] before you
[1:32:06] amen and so brother brown says see stand
[1:32:09] in his blessings stand in his power
[1:32:14] now i'm taking this word right here even
[1:32:16] though power doesn't necessarily mean
[1:32:18] strength but i i trust you'll give me
[1:32:20] that grace to just let that carry right
[1:32:22] over into that we want a supernatural
[1:32:25] power we want the strength of almighty
[1:32:28] god and we come sometimes say how is
[1:32:30] this i can't seem to find it to overcome
[1:32:34] or to to meet the challenge of the day
[1:32:36] and it's there he says now you've got to
[1:32:39] stand in his power let's go back to my
[1:32:41] early statement i didn't even think i'd
[1:32:43] preach this long i thought we'd be gone
[1:32:48] stand
[1:32:51] in his power
[1:32:54] don't drive off don't walk off don't
[1:32:56] climb up don't do this don't
[1:32:58] people say excuse me people say
[1:33:01] well i listen to the prophet while i do
[1:33:03] my dishes
[1:33:05] i'm a hardliner
[1:33:07] you're either listening to the prophet
[1:33:08] or you're doing your dishes
[1:33:10] but you really can't get the full depth
[1:33:13] of that
[1:33:14] doing both right
[1:33:16] just an opinion i'll put it that way
[1:33:19] i don't know but he promised oh he says
[1:33:22] stand in his power if you're sick how
[1:33:24] are you going to get well i don't know
[1:33:26] but he promised to do it and the holy
[1:33:28] spirit is a witness of his light and his
[1:33:32] resurrection just walk in the light and
[1:33:34] go the right directions towards calvary
[1:33:37] and it'll lead you to your healing and
[1:33:39] to your blessing just take the light
[1:33:40] with you as you go
[1:33:42] my brother and sister this is the thing
[1:33:44] that we must do we cannot set the very
[1:33:47] lantern down that is providing the light
[1:33:50] to us it'll work for a while but we'll
[1:33:52] never get home
[1:33:55] we'll never get home because the time we
[1:33:57] start to get close to home are you with
[1:33:59] me
[1:34:00] you'll be walking in darkness again
[1:34:02] i'm telling you oh i shouldn't be so
[1:34:05] direct forgive me
[1:34:07] but i'm telling you there's a mini a
[1:34:09] message believer has set his lantern
[1:34:12] down and he says i walked in the light
[1:34:16] is it present tense or past tense lord
[1:34:18] help it to be present tense not i walked
[1:34:22] as in past tense but to be i am walking
[1:34:26] in the light and you say brother paul
[1:34:28] how does this come together with looking
[1:34:30] at this in our position of strength well
[1:34:33] i'll tell you how it'll be my brother
[1:34:34] and sister it'll take strength to keep
[1:34:37] walking in the light
[1:34:39] it will take strength and that strength
[1:34:41] is comes from almighty god and he has
[1:34:44] given it to us tonight we are not here
[1:34:47] hoping or begging or looking for
[1:34:49] something to show up it's right here in
[1:34:51] our fingertips in our hearts amen in our
[1:34:54] mind in our mouth amen we have the
[1:34:57] supernatural strength that the word of
[1:34:59] god promised to deliver us to the finish
[1:35:02] line
[1:35:02] oh people say i don't feel like i have
[1:35:04] any strength brother paul i don't feel
[1:35:05] like i have any power i don't feel like
[1:35:07] i'm worthy i don't feel like that i want
[1:35:09] you to stop
[1:35:11] and i want you to go see what the bible
[1:35:12] says about you
[1:35:15] no no don't let the devil anoint you to
[1:35:17] the pages concerning judas
[1:35:20] that's the devil
[1:35:22] remember what the prophet of god said
[1:35:26] if god's dealing with you still
[1:35:30] there it is
[1:35:33] thank you lord
[1:35:34] i'm telling you it's getting saints i
[1:35:36] can't speak for you i can't even speak
[1:35:37] for my own wife or children or
[1:35:39] grandchildren but i'm telling you
[1:35:41] that god is just putting the hammer down
[1:35:43] on me
[1:35:46] that come over good
[1:35:49] look i shared with you the other day
[1:35:50] trying to be transparent with you
[1:35:52] i'm no different you are god called me
[1:35:54] to stand behind a pulpit but i'm no
[1:35:56] different you are
[1:35:57] and i've got my little library room and
[1:35:59] it's coming together i've got these
[1:36:00] shelves and i've got books and the
[1:36:02] message and some other you know things
[1:36:05] goofy westerns that we read from the
[1:36:07] time we could read
[1:36:10] but i'm picking books up
[1:36:16] books
[1:36:17] that i have had my possession for 25
[1:36:20] 30 years
[1:36:22] walking over it's like i probably should
[1:36:25] take this good will why poison somebody
[1:36:27] else's mind
[1:36:28] if god convicted you that it was poison
[1:36:30] your mind why would you poison someone
[1:36:32] else's mind with it so i'm pulling the
[1:36:34] drawer out and i'm dropping them in
[1:36:35] there
[1:36:41] yeah
[1:36:42] and the wife i'm going to tell on her a
[1:36:44] little bit i'm trying to get out of the
[1:36:45] habit of throwing her under the bus
[1:36:47] i don't want to have all the body shops
[1:36:49] complaining about how to fix their bus
[1:36:53] the wife what are you going to do with
[1:36:55] these books she comes in and sets them
[1:36:56] down
[1:36:57] on my desk
[1:36:59] and i pick one up is the reader's digest
[1:37:01] condensed
[1:37:03] there's four stories in there now that
[1:37:05] story's junk that's right oh that's a
[1:37:06] good story
[1:37:08] maybe i'll keep this one
[1:37:10] i mean after all
[1:37:13] it wasn't too provocative of a
