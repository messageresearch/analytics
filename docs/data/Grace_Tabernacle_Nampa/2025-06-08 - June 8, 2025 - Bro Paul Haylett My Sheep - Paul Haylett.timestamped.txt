[27:58] Heavenly Father, as we bow our heads
[28:00] before you, the King of Kings, the Lord
[28:04] of
[28:04] Lords, our eternal salvation, our
[28:07] strength,
[28:09] you chose
[28:10] us. You chose us in yourself before the
[28:13] world began. Aren't you worthy enough of
[28:15] praise for that?
[28:18] We can't direct our own steps. We can do
[28:20] nothing without you.
[28:22] You put us in these bodies, but who are
[28:25] we but that soul realm that came with
[28:27] from you before the foundation of the
[28:29] world. We were in your thinking.
[28:32] You expressed us in a word and we are
[28:35] here Lord to worship you, to honor you,
[28:38] to give glory and honor to you. Move
[28:41] upon this people. Yes. We give you
[28:43] preeminence to do as you want to do to
[28:46] speak your word through your servant
[28:47] this morning. We're here to receive you,
[28:49] Lord. We're here to accept you. We bring
[28:52] these requests before you. They've been
[28:53] mentioned. Now, in the name of Jesus
[28:56] Christ, let every one of those be
[28:58] ministered to and met according to your
[29:00] desire and perfect purpose. We call for
[29:03] life for those that are sick. We call
[29:05] for salvation. Lord, save those that are
[29:08] savable here this morning.
[29:11] Deliver us. Reveal your word to us,
[29:14] Lord. Amen.
[29:16] How can we honor worship if we know not
[29:18] who you are, where we're going, or what
[29:20] we're to do? Lord, we're asking for
[29:22] revelation.
[29:24] How did Abel know what to do and how to
[29:26] worship except by
[29:28] revelation, Lord. We are not of of the
[29:31] serpent seed. We are we are children of
[29:33] the king, the king of kings. We are your
[29:36] seed. We are your life, and we're here

[29:43] Not only here in this assembly, but
[29:45] leaving here raised to a higher plane to
[29:47] worship and honor you in spirit and in
[29:49] truth. We go out of this house, out of
[29:51] this place to give worship to you every
[29:55] moment of our day, Lord. Oh God, let our
[29:57] minds be stated on you. Keep us behind
[29:59] the wall of your word.
[30:02] Have we not been proven to us, Lord,
[30:04] that your word is our is our keeper, is
[30:07] our savior, is our refuge. Yes, Lord
[30:10] Jesus. Then let us hold a stand us
[30:12] behind the wall. Don't let us reason
[30:14] with the enemy. But take the word. It's
[30:16] our absolute. It's our It's our
[30:18] perfection. It's absolutely what you've
[30:21] given us for deliverance. Lord Jesus
[30:24] never said to Satan, "I rebuke you." He
[30:26] said, "It is written." Lord, let us
[30:28] stand behind that. You showed us what
[30:31] the weakest of Christians can do. And
[30:33] now Lord because of that we are taking
[30:35] you at your word because of these
[30:37] requests right now in the name of Jesus
[30:40] Christ. May you not only move here among
[30:42] us but move on every one of those that
[30:44] are listening those online those Lord
[30:47] that are sick those that are traveling
[30:48] every one of them. You've heard the
[30:50] request. Yes. Now, Father, in Jesus
[30:53] name, we believe that we receive what we
[30:55] asked for and we praise you and thank
[30:57] you for answering prayer and we expect
[30:59] to hear it answered and to receive it
[31:01] because you said so in Jesus Christ's
[31:04] name and for your glory. Amen. Amen. And
[31:07] they everyone said, "Amen." Amen. Thank
[31:10] you, Lord.

[31:57] began. My life was in his
[32:05] hand. He knows my name.
[32:12] He knows my every
[32:19] thought. He sees each tear that
[32:24] falls and hears me when I
[32:32] call. I have a father.
[32:39] He calls me his
[32:43] [Music]
[32:45] own and he'll
[32:47] never leave
[32:50] me no
[32:52] matter where I
[32:58] go. He knows my name.
[33:03] [Music]
[33:06] He knows my every
[33:11] thought. He sees each tear that
[33:17] falls and hears me when I
[33:22] [Music]
[33:24] call. I have a father.
[33:30] [Music]
[33:32] He calls me his
[33:37] own. And he'll
[33:40] never leave
[33:43] me. No
[33:45] matter where I
[33:51] go. He knows my name.
[33:58] He knows my every
[34:04] thought. He sees each tear that
[34:09] falls and hears me when I
[34:16] call. Amen. I'm the
[34:21] last. He'll never leave me no matter
[34:24] where I go. How many times have you
[34:26] needed him and the words? I will never
[34:28] leave you nor forsake you. Come back to
[34:30] your mind. Praise the Lord. Amen. I'm
[34:34] actually going to sing a different song
[34:35] here.
[34:37] Um, I wanted to
[34:40] just as you were just playing before the
[34:43] service, it just struck me a a quote I
[34:45] read this morning and
[34:49] um if I can even find it
[35:00] now want to sing so sweet to trust in
[35:03] Jesus. Amen.
[35:08] [Music]
[35:10] You know, I love this song. There's no
[35:13] no greater thing than to trust in
[35:16] [Music]
[35:21] him. Sorry. Just give me a second
[35:25] here. And I've probably read this
[35:28] before, but I'm going to read it again.
[35:30] Amen. And he's only asked us one thing.
[35:34] to believe what he
[35:36] said is the truth. To believe what he
[35:38] said is the truth. Amen. That's what
[35:40] he's asked us to do. And he'll bring it
[35:42] to pass. Oh, how beautiful. You expected
[35:45] a spontaneous thing to happen. Sometimes
[35:47] it just takes a little bit of faith. It
[35:50] won't make a miracle, but if you'll hold
[35:52] on to it, it'll bring you out. Just stay
[35:55] right with it. Like he said, the seed of
[35:58] a mustard, the smallest among all seeds.
[36:01] But did you ever notice mustard won't
[36:02] mix with nothing? You can't cross
[36:05] mustered up with anything. It won't
[36:06] cross. And if you've got faith, just a
[36:09] little bit of faith that won't cross up
[36:11] with any unbelief or any churchianity or
[36:14] dogmas. Just stay right with God. Just
[36:16] stay right with it. It'll bring you
[36:19] right on through the fog. Take you right
[36:21] out. Yeah. Just stay right with that
[36:23] faith. Amen.
[36:25] Amen. I like the the the first part of
[36:27] that when you were playing that this
[36:28] morning just struck me. And he's asked
[36:30] us to do one thing. To believe. Amen. To
[36:34] believe what he said is truth. Amen. And
[36:37] I just was like, I I I got to sing that
[36:39] song. I love this song. Means so much to
[36:42] me. It is so
[36:46] sweet to trust in
[36:50] Jesus. us to
[36:54] take him at his
[36:58] word. Just to
[37:02] rest upon his
[37:06] promise, just to
[37:10] know. Thus says the Lord.
[37:16] Jesus.
[37:18] Jesus. How I trust him. How I've
[37:26] proved him more and
[37:31] more.
[37:33] Jesus.
[37:35] Jesus.
[37:37] Preious Jesus.
[37:40] Oh, for
[37:42] grace to trust him
[37:47] more. Oh, how
[37:50] sweet to trust in
[37:55] Jesus. Just to
[37:58] trust his
[38:01] cleansing
[38:03] blood. Trust in
[38:07] simple faith to plunge me. Need the
[38:15] healing
[38:17] cleansing
[38:19] flood.
[38:20] Jesus.
[38:23] Jesus. How I trust him. How I've
[38:30] proved him more and
[38:35] more.
[38:36] Jesus,

[41:51] full
[41:53] grace to trust him
[41:57] [Music]
[41:59] more. Can we say amen to that this
[42:02] morning? Lord, just help me to trust you
[42:04] more. Help me just to surrender my own
[42:08] thoughts, my own ideas, and be able to
[42:11] just say, "Lord, lead me to the right,
[42:13] to the left. Just lead me to your altar.
[42:16] Lead me to your presence, Lord. That's
[42:18] what I desire today." Amen. God bless
[42:22] you. Like to greet each and everyone. Uh
[42:25] Ethan, good to see you again. Amen. I'm
[42:28] going to take the liberty if I can to
[42:31] say God bless you, Sister Megan and
[42:33] Sister Aspen. We greet you today. And I
[42:37] hope this doesn't spook you, but I would
[42:39] like to have just a moment to talk to
[42:41] you at the end of church if you don't
[42:43] mind. Amen. That would be wonderful. and
[42:46] uh just a real privilege. Uh these two
[42:49] young ladies have what I'm going to say
[42:51] is a fantastic grandmother. Uh she is
[42:55] just uh has such a desire to her
[42:58] granddaughters and uh is so proud of
[43:00] them. Uh if you guys probably would
[43:02] blush just to hear all the wonderful
[43:05] words that your grandmother has said
[43:07] about you. And uh so God bless us all
[43:10] with grandmothers like that. Amen. And
[43:13] uh, of course, Sister April. God bless
[43:15] you today. And uh, we haven't seen um,
[43:19] Camden, Logan, and the kids. And I I
[43:22] guess your mom's here. Uh, Sister Sammy,
[43:25] God bless. Oh, there you are. Uh, God
[43:27] bless you. Good to see you. The travel
[43:29] back and forth and all of the activities
[43:31] of life. Amen. And our sister Maria, God
[43:34] bless you. To see you here today with
[43:37] your beautiful baby. Amen. If you don't
[43:40] mind, just a couple little little
[43:42] announcements, little greetings. I give
[43:44] you greetings from brother Jose
[43:45] Hernandez in the Tri Cities. Um, Brother
[43:49] Jose has just been very diligently
[43:53] seeking the will of God and and uh has
[43:56] been voted in as pastor there, the
[43:58] little group there in the Tri Cities.
[44:00] and um they have uh moved forward and uh
[44:04] he sent me a lovely little message uh
[44:07] here that uh they have um now committed
[44:11] to a name for the church and it is
[44:14] Bethlehem Bible Fellowship. So just
[44:17] remember Bethlehem Bible Fellowship in
[44:19] your prayers and uh if you um have
[44:24] opportunity to be in the Tri Cities,
[44:26] it's just a mere 240 miles, you know. Um
[44:29] but um I'm sure that they would love for
[44:32] you to come and fellowship with them.
[44:35] Amen. Youth group this coming Friday,
[44:38] 700 p.m. here at the church unless
[44:41] otherwise announced. Um so um we'll see.
[44:45] I I I don't want to take too much
[44:47] liberty, but I must say um Brother Alex,
[44:50] Sister Rachel, I really enjoyed youth
[44:52] group at your house. Hint hint. Um don't
[44:56] want you to be too bold, but anyway,
[44:58] we'll announce it'll be here at the
[45:00] church unless announced different. And
[45:03] uh on June 18th,
[45:06] um that uh Wednesday, there'll be no
[45:10] service. We'll be taking sound equipment
[45:12] and different things from the church
[45:14] here. And so there'll be no Wednesday
[45:17] service as we get ready for camp. And uh
[45:20] the following Sunday service will be at
[45:24] camp. So I would encourage each and
[45:26] every one of you uh even if you're maybe
[45:29] can't by by because of work schedules,
[45:31] family situations, can't attend, please
[45:34] make the effort to drive up and and be
[45:36] part of that. I believe you'll be
[45:38] blessed. And uh so uh I forgot to write
[45:42] the date of that Sunday. Um
[45:46] 22nd.
[45:47] Yeah. Uh there'll be no church here at
[45:50] the at the tabernacle. Uh it'll be there
[45:53] at camp. So, okay. Is that all clear? Uh
[45:57] lately, just a lot of things have been
[45:59] weighing on me and I find myself mixing
[46:02] up dates and places and names and all
[46:05] kinds of things. So by God's grace, I
[46:08] want to speak to you today if you don't
[46:10] mind. We turn our Bibles to Ezekiel the
[46:12] 34th chapter. Thank you musicians. Thank
[46:14] you, brother Isaac. Amen. Song services.
[46:18] God is so gracious. Always seem to just
[46:20] speak right to my heart and and I
[46:23] appreciate that. It's just wonderful.
[46:25] Amen. Ezekiel 34 uh 26 through31. I want
[46:30] to speak to you this morning. Uh
[46:32] actually it would be an overall title of
[46:34] God's achievement but um I I'm I don't
[46:38] want to get too complicated so we just
[46:40] named it my sheep and um so we'll just
[46:44] take this out of that and uh today are
[46:47] there any sheep here? Amen. Amen. I
[46:50] thank God that we can stand in a
[46:52] position and say you know what I am
[46:55] God's sheep. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[46:58] And I will make them and places around
[47:02] about my hill a blessing. And I will
[47:05] cause the shower to come down in his
[47:08] season, and there shall be showers of
[47:11] blessing. How many of us this morning
[47:13] are desiring a shower of blessing? How
[47:15] many of us would say, "Lord, I just ask
[47:18] you just to rain down your blessing on
[47:20] me." See, this is not selfish, my
[47:22] brother and sister. The word com tells
[47:25] us in a very very complete form that we
[47:28] are here and he's here to grant the
[47:31] desires of our hearts. And I say this
[47:33] morning once again, anyone desire a
[47:36] shower of blessing today? Amen. That God
[47:39] would just rain down on you. Amen. And
[47:42] the tree of the field shall yield her
[47:44] fruit and the earth shall yield her
[47:46] increase and they shall be safe in their
[47:49] land and shall know that I am the Lord.
[47:52] Now, my brother and sister, I don't mean
[47:54] to preach this out, but I want to make a
[47:56] couple points here. Amen. It says here
[47:59] that the earth shall yield their her
[48:01] increase, and they shall be safe in
[48:03] their land. And that land is your
[48:05] habitation. Amen. Amen. Wherever you are
[48:09] at, that land, your habitation, God has
[48:12] promised you would be safe in that
[48:14] position. And I I believe that. I
[48:17] believe right. Amen. you know, in that
[48:19] midnight hour, the scripture tells us,
[48:21] you know, just uh uh call out his name,
[48:24] cry out to him, and uh he shall come.
[48:28] Satan will have to flee. So, we have a a
[48:32] solid, secure assurance we're going to
[48:35] be safe in our land. Amen. And you know,
[48:39] you can take that right down, place that
[48:41] in your home, uh your family, your own
[48:43] life. Amen. And uh I know that I am the
[48:48] Lord and shall know that I am the Lord.
[48:50] And I have broken the bands of their
[48:52] yoke and deliver them out of the hand of
[48:54] those that serve themselves of them,
[48:56] those that use them. And they shall no
[48:59] more be prey to the heathen. Neither
[49:01] shall the beast of the land devour them,
[49:04] but they shall dwell safely, and none
[49:07] shall make them afraid. And I will raise
[49:10] up for them a plant of renown, and they
[49:14] shall be no more consumed with hunger in
[49:16] the land, neither bear the shame of the
[49:20] heathen anymore. Thus shall they know
[49:23] that I, the Lord their God, am with
[49:26] them, and that they, even the house of
[49:29] Israel, are my people, saith the Lord
[49:32] God. and ye my flock, the flock of my
[49:36] pasture are men, and I am your God,
[49:40] saith the Lord God. Amen. If you have a
[49:43] need today, just lift your hand in your
[49:45] heart today and just ask the Lord to
[49:47] come and speak to you. Heavenly Father,
[49:49] we just come before you today, Lord. You
[49:52] know my hearts. You know my prayers,
[49:54] Father. Lord, just come down and anoint
[49:56] us today, Lord, that the word would
[49:58] come. And Lord, as you deal with us as
[50:01] individuals, let the word come and touch
[50:04] us all, Father, for we need you. We are
[50:06] a needy people. We need your strength.
[50:09] We need your wisdom, Father. We need
[50:11] your Holy Spirit to pour down upon us,
[50:14] Father, to just cleanse us and refresh
[50:16] us in the day that we live. We ask you
[50:19] now to move in this service, move in the
[50:21] hearts of sons and daughters of God in
[50:23] the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[50:27] You may be seated. Amen. Now, as we
[50:30] would look at this
[50:32] today, we would look at this and really
[50:34] taking a focus from the 31st verse. Ye
[50:38] are my flock, the flock of my pasture
[50:42] are men, and I am your God, saith the
[50:45] Lord God. We look at this, my brother
[50:47] and sister, it's speaking of or denoting
[50:51] ownership. And uh regardless of how
[50:53] mankind feels today, you know, uh let me
[50:56] take this back in a natural sense. I
[50:58] remember some time back a young man
[51:00] saying you know uh I I would like to to
[51:04] be like you Paul and I want to work for
[51:07] myself and have no one else as my boss.
[51:10] But let me tell you as someone who has
[51:12] worked for himself for three decades
[51:15] there's always someone who is your boss.
[51:18] Amen. It might be, in my case, I don't
[51:20] want to get too uh distracted or carnal,
[51:22] but it might be the banker or it might
[51:25] be the company you signed a contract to
[51:27] grow a crop for them, a seed crop or
[51:30] something of that nature. There's always
[51:32] someone you might say is your boss. Now,
[51:34] let's bring this over in the spiritual
[51:36] realm. We have a boss on the earth
[51:39] today, and that boss is either Satan or
[51:41] the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, it all
[51:43] depends on who you want to boss your
[51:46] life and who you choose for a boss.
[51:48] Amen. Nothing like meeting people who
[51:50] have worked for for 30 or 40 years and
[51:53] say, "I hate my job. My boss is a
[51:56] tyrant. Why don't you leave? I'm afraid
[51:58] to leave." Well, my brother and sister,
[52:00] may God break the fear that would be on
[52:02] sons and daughters of God to break away
[52:05] from this boss that cruy uses humanity
[52:08] and destroys their lives because they're
[52:11] afraid of God. You see, Satan has pulled
[52:15] one over on people, pulled the wool over
[52:17] their eyes because they they're afraid
[52:20] of what it would be to serve God while
[52:22] they serve a cruel taskmaster. And it's
[52:25] there, my brother and sister, that God
[52:27] is wanting us to to break away from that
[52:30] and realize uh who is the boss of our
[52:33] life. Who do we desire? And this is
[52:35] speaking uh ye are my flock. Amen. And
[52:39] the flock of my pasture. It denotes an
[52:43] ownership. And I tell you my brother and
[52:45] sister, I want to be identified in Jesus
[52:48] Christ. There is nothing to be ashamed
[52:50] of in the world today. People that say
[52:52] there is no God. people that say we
[52:55] don't need a God just dig deeper and
[52:57] look at their lives and realize how
[53:00] there are things in their life that they
[53:02] are so miserable about and they feel
[53:05] they're trapped into something and and
[53:07] in the world today look it don't have to
[53:09] be religion to tell you even the medical
[53:12] field is starting to say people are
[53:15] using their term that they come up with
[53:18] I don't know how long it's been around
[53:19] quite a while but people self-medicate
[53:22] themselves
[53:24] And now you know obviously our sister
[53:26] being a doctor would would understand
[53:28] fully and I I believe our our sister is
[53:31] also involved in the medical field and
[53:33] my brother and sister it's one thing to
[53:35] take a prescription that is for a
[53:37] purpose but when we come that we need to
[53:40] medicate our lives to such because we
[53:43] can't face yesterday or tomorrow maybe
[53:46] not even today and and we deal with that
[53:48] in that fashion and it shows that in
[53:51] that there is an ownership that is not
[53:53] of God. There is something controlling
[53:55] that is not of God. But I'm here today
[53:58] to proclaim the liberty of Jesus Christ.
[54:01] Amen. To proclaim that we can be here.
[54:04] Will the challenges of your life go
[54:06] away? Will the troubles of your life all
[54:08] go away? But you have a way of escape.
[54:11] You have a place to come. And you can
[54:13] self-medicate if you don't mind. Pick
[54:15] your Bible up. Amen. Pick up the message
[54:18] and start reading it. And you'll find
[54:20] that those depressing spirits will
[54:22] depart from you. Those fears and those
[54:24] anxieties and those doubts will depart
[54:26] from you because we are what we feed on.
[54:30] Amen. And sometimes we just get so numb
[54:33] to the things of life. We'll find oursel
[54:35] not on evil, but we'll find ourselves
[54:37] feeding on something just because we're
[54:40] numb. Amen. And so God help us. Amen.
[54:43] That we would realize that we are under
[54:45] ownership. Amen. Now you look at this.
[54:48] The world today would probably declare
[54:49] this as some form of a sexist statement.
[54:52] I'm sorry to put it that bluntly, but my
[54:54] brother and sister, they they don't want
[54:56] to talk about husband and wife. Take it
[54:58] back to the Bible. It's always now just
[55:01] your partner. Well, my brother and
[55:03] sister, the word of God says that we are
[55:05] truly in the in the marital
[55:07] relationship, we are partners, but
[55:09] there's got to be someone who's got the
[55:11] final word. Amen. And when you realize
[55:14] by the word of God, God said, "You know
[55:16] what? uh uh the man is the one that's
[55:19] going to have the final word. And people
[55:21] will say, "Well, well, I don't know
[55:23] about that." Well, my brother and
[55:24] sister, I tell you what, I kind of like
[55:26] that myself because we're uh noted in
[55:29] the Bible as the bride of Jesus Christ.
[55:32] In other words, we have a husband. And
[55:34] when it comes to the final
[55:36] responsibility, I want my husband to
[55:38] have the final responsibility. I I want
[55:41] God to have the final responsibility for
[55:43] my life. He said, "I will lead you and
[55:46] guide you into some of the truth some of
[55:49] the time." No, he said, "I'll lead you
[55:51] and guide you into all truth." This is
[55:54] an emphatic, solid, foundational
[55:56] statement that you can now say, "God is
[55:59] leading me into all truth." And it's in
[56:02] that place that we can place his trust.
[56:04] I was just listening to a brother uh
[56:06] minister and uh just a little blip of it
[56:09] and he's you know talking about a a
[56:12] individual that he was dealing with and
[56:14] and uh he's talking about how God moved
[56:16] in that man's life and how the man just
[56:19] a very rough rough character and uh he
[56:22] give his life to the Lord and and his
[56:24] life completely changed and somebody
[56:26] asked him does he attend your church and
[56:29] he said I can't find anywhere in the
[56:31] word where the word says I cause them to
[56:34] attend my church. The word says get them
[56:36] to Christ. Amen. Amen. God will put them
[56:39] where he wants them to be. It's not a
[56:42] requirement to get them to your church,
[56:44] but it is an influence to us to get them
[56:47] to Jesus Christ. Amen. Now, if the
[56:50] Lord's going to lead you, do you believe
[56:51] that scripture? I'll lead you and guide
[56:53] you into all truth. Now, if we believe
[56:56] that scripture, then the obligation is
[56:59] no longer say on grace tabernacle. It's
[57:01] no longer on whoever witnessed to you.
[57:04] It's no longer on this or that person.
[57:06] But then it is upon Jesus Christ and he
[57:09] freely accepts the responsibility to
[57:12] lead you to all truth. Amen. But we got
[57:15] to be willing when he leads to follow.
[57:18] Amen. Amen. And so we look at this and
[57:20] and realize how beautiful this is
[57:22] because he's now making a claim on you
[57:25] and I. Now our full responsibility I
[57:28] like what brother Isaac shared. Our full
[57:30] responsibility is to believe. Amen. You
[57:33] see, it don't matter. We can go along
[57:36] haphazardly following. You'll see people
[57:39] many years they say, "Well, I I was a
[57:41] Christian for 40 years and and then I
[57:44] just got discouraged and I quit." My
[57:46] brother and sister, I'm sorry, this is a
[57:48] little bit blunt. But that person was
[57:49] just following along.
[57:52] They weren't of the flock. That's right.
[57:54] God doesn't just lose people along the
[57:56] way with the flock. Oh, I started out
[58:00] with a hundred and somehow I lost 50 of
[58:02] them. Oh, big deal. No, my brother and
[58:04] sister, he climbs, as we all know the
[58:06] story. He climbs down through the rocks
[58:08] and the briars and everything to go and
[58:11] redeem that one lost lamb of God. Amen.
[58:14] My brother and sister, that's the kind
[58:16] of God we serve. Amen. Because we are
[58:19] his sheep. Amen. Now, if we put it in
[58:22] the natural, I remember a guy one time
[58:24] just making a flippant statement. He
[58:26] said, "Oh, Paul, that's just $10." I
[58:30] said, "Whip your wallet out right now.
[58:31] Throw a 10 on the floor and see what
[58:33] happens to it." Yeah. And he's like,
[58:35] "Well, what do you mean?" And I said,
[58:36] "The minute you drop it, I'm grabbing
[58:38] it." That's right. And if you just think
[58:41] a $10 don't matter, you can just stand
[58:43] here all day long and drop $10 on the
[58:45] floor because in the talking natural in
[58:48] that that $10, Amen. A 10 here, a 10
[58:51] there until it will add up. So the
[58:54] flippant idea that well the Lord just
[58:56] barely touched me. My brother and
[58:58] sister, stand still, trust the Lord,
[59:00] receive a blessing, they come
[59:03] individually. Amen. God's not going to
[59:06] deliver the truckload of blessing to
[59:08] you, but he wants us to stand and
[59:10] receive every little blessing. I tell
[59:13] you, sometimes those blessings are are
[59:15] are incredible how they come because
[59:18] they come seemingly so insignificant
[59:21] that we're not shocked. You know, as the
[59:23] phrase is, our hair is not blowed back.
[59:25] Oh, I got blessed. It was so. But my
[59:28] brother and sister, when you stop at the
[59:29] end of the day, the end of the week,
[59:31] amen, the end of the month, the end of
[59:33] the year, the end of your life, amen,
[59:35] and you realize how many blessings God
[59:37] has poured out upon you, you won't be
[59:40] able to number those blessings. Amen.
[59:43] That's the life of a believer. God
[59:46] continually blessing everywhere you go,
[59:49] my brother and sister. Continually
[59:51] blessing. Just to share, I think I
[59:53] shared this at communion just here
[59:55] recently. We're coming to church and
[59:57] we're coming down. We always drive down
[59:59] Orchard and and I know they just didn't
[1:00:01] see us. And it's understandable. We I
[1:00:03] think have all probably done that. But
[1:00:05] this car pulled off a side road right
[1:00:07] there. I believe that was Florida. and
[1:00:10] they pulled right out. And as we were
[1:00:12] driving down the road, too fast to stop,
[1:00:14] this car pulls out. And then he sees us
[1:00:16] at the last minute and swerves away. I
[1:00:19] think if my window would have been down,
[1:00:20] I could have reached out and touched
[1:00:21] their
[1:00:23] hood.
[1:00:24] Oh, I was lucky.
[1:00:28] No, I'm a son of God. I'm blessed. Amen.
[1:00:32] Yes, sir. Now, just because you get in
[1:00:33] an accident doesn't mean God took his
[1:00:35] blessings from you. But look at this, my
[1:00:37] brother and sister. You see, it all
[1:00:39] depends on how you want to look at your
[1:00:40] life. You say, you know, life's been
[1:00:42] good to me. Well, you can account it to
[1:00:44] your ability, your luck, your whatever
[1:00:46] you want. Or you can stop and say, you
[1:00:48] know what? The Lord is blessing me.
[1:00:50] That's how I'm going to receive it. Is
[1:00:52] the Lord is blessing me. And I look at
[1:00:54] this and he said he'd lead me to all
[1:00:56] truth. All truth is all encompassing. In
[1:00:59] other words, every segment of your life,
[1:01:03] he's leading it. He's a part of it. Now
[1:01:07] Ephesians the 2 chapter 13- 22 he said
[1:01:12] but now in Christ Jesus ye who are
[1:01:16] sometimes were far off
[1:01:19] all I got to do is go back in my teenage
[1:01:22] years that's right go back in my
[1:01:24] testimony and tell you how far off you
[1:01:28] can be raised in church
[1:01:32] in this case we're message believers you
[1:01:34] can be raised in the message Yeah. And
[1:01:36] wake up one day and find yourself so a
[1:01:39] far off. That's right. Amen. But that's
[1:01:42] not what the scripture says. Those that
[1:01:44] were sometimes were far off, this is
[1:01:46] placing a past tense, were far off and
[1:01:48] are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
[1:01:51] For he is our peace. Anybody want peace
[1:01:54] in your life? Amen. Who hath made both
[1:01:57] one and hath broken down the middle wall
[1:01:59] of partition between us. Amen. Now, I
[1:02:02] want to insert this just real quick
[1:02:04] here. That middle wall, my brother and
[1:02:06] sister, is a veil.
[1:02:09] Okay? Please, please hold that as a
[1:02:11] note. That middle wall is a veil. In
[1:02:13] other words, it's not completely solid.
[1:02:16] You can take people that every other
[1:02:18] word is a curse word. But why would they
[1:02:20] use the name of Jesus Christ as a curse
[1:02:23] word if they didn't think the name was
[1:02:24] real? Right? So, Satan's anointed them
[1:02:27] to come and acknowledge that Christ is
[1:02:30] real, but using him as though he would
[1:02:33] curse.
[1:02:35] No, that's not what the scripture says.
[1:02:37] Anyone who would believe, he'll save
[1:02:39] them. Amen. So, we can get all
[1:02:42] complicated, but if you would believe
[1:02:44] and completely commit and completely
[1:02:45] surrender, he says, "I'll save you."
[1:02:48] Now, the fact that he is the only one
[1:02:51] that can do that is a great big picture
[1:02:54] that we'll step on another day. So, he
[1:02:57] says, now look at this. Having abolished
[1:03:00] in his flesh the emnity, even the law of
[1:03:03] commandments contained in ordinance.
[1:03:06] Now, people would say, now does this
[1:03:08] scripture mean the ten commandments are
[1:03:10] no longer
[1:03:12] valid? No. My brother and sister, Jesus
[1:03:14] said, I didn't come to do away with the
[1:03:16] law. I come to fulfill the law. In other
[1:03:20] words, were we once by law could never
[1:03:23] have fulfilled the word of the law, the
[1:03:26] scripture says he wrote it in the
[1:03:28] fleshly tables of our hearts. And we
[1:03:30] realize by God's grace, I can believe
[1:03:34] the word. Amen. And the word is what's
[1:03:37] changing me, not the written law. That's
[1:03:41] right. So when we hold on to the word,
[1:03:43] my brother and sister, and make that our
[1:03:45] absolute, amen, then you will find
[1:03:48] yourself step by step, day by day,
[1:03:50] fulfilling the law. You'll find when
[1:03:52] it's all over that we will have
[1:03:54] fulfilled every drop of the law. Amen.
[1:03:58] For our day, for what God has called us
[1:04:00] to, we'll fulfill that. Amen. Because
[1:04:03] you see, some of that law was to Jews
[1:04:05] and Jews alone. So we are not Jews.
[1:04:09] We're not called to fulfill those things
[1:04:11] because people say, "Well, if you're a
[1:04:13] real Christian, you won't mix uh linens
[1:04:15] and polyesters and these and that. You
[1:04:18] won't do all that if you" No, my brother
[1:04:19] and sister. The rule that God put on
[1:04:22] Israel was for Israel. Now, we got to
[1:04:25] remember, I'll sidetrack for a moment if
[1:04:27] you don't mind for a moment here. You
[1:04:29] look at this. I just read a a wonderful
[1:04:32] book uh uh that Sister Sue got for me on
[1:04:35] Israel. And in that is it's very very
[1:04:38] well written because the author makes a
[1:04:41] great declaration and separation between
[1:04:45] secular Israel and Orthodox.
[1:04:50] And so you can stand for the Jewish
[1:04:52] nation. You can fight for your country
[1:04:54] and you can do certain things and not
[1:04:57] really even believe in Jehovah. That's
[1:05:01] right. You're just a Jew and we as Jews
[1:05:04] have a promise. Yeah. That promise came
[1:05:06] from Jehovah. But we'll set Jehovah to
[1:05:08] the side. We're going to focus on the
[1:05:10] promise. My brother and sister, you
[1:05:12] can't have a promise of eternal life ex
[1:05:14] you accept the one who gives eternal
[1:05:17] life. Amen. So you can fight and say,
[1:05:19] "I'll live good. I'll live perfect." But
[1:05:21] I don't want to acknowledge there's a
[1:05:22] God behind this. You'll find yourself
[1:05:24] coming up short at some point in your
[1:05:26] life. So we don't want to be, as it
[1:05:28] were, secular believers. We don't want
[1:05:30] to just say there is a God, there is a
[1:05:32] Bible, there is a church. But we want to
[1:05:35] know the God of the Bible. We want to
[1:05:38] know the God that says, "You ought to
[1:05:39] assemble yourselves together." We want
[1:05:41] to know the God that made the promise
[1:05:43] for our day and said, "I will come and
[1:05:46] before I smite the earth with a curse, I
[1:05:48] will fulfill my promise and bless you
[1:05:51] and uh redeem you and draw you out and
[1:05:54] make you who are not a people, make you
[1:05:56] my people." Amen. I want to be his
[1:05:59] people, my brother and sister. That's
[1:06:01] what my heart cries for. I don't want to
[1:06:02] just be a a go to church Christian. I
[1:06:05] want to be identified as being one of
[1:06:08] them. I want to be identified as part of
[1:06:10] Jesus Christ. Amen. So he says here that
[1:06:15] uh uh and he abolished his flesh and
[1:06:18] immity and law of commandments contained
[1:06:21] in ordinances for to make in himself of
[1:06:23] twain one new man. So making peace that
[1:06:26] he might reconcile both unto God in one
[1:06:29] body by the cross having slain the
[1:06:32] enmity. Amen. The conflict between. Now
[1:06:36] we have to understand this in a
[1:06:37] spiritual context because you see every
[1:06:40] one of us here today faces some kind of
[1:06:42] internal
[1:06:45] conflict.
[1:06:48] Being a Christian filled with the Holy
[1:06:50] Ghost does not just
[1:06:52] eliminate internal conflict, which is a
[1:06:55] very foundational factor that brother
[1:06:57] Brandham said uh about uh the the
[1:07:00] greatest battle ever fought. The fact
[1:07:01] that the battle we're fighting, my
[1:07:03] brother and sister, isn't out here flesh
[1:07:04] and blood, scriptural, right? But it's
[1:07:06] not flesh and blood. The battle's right
[1:07:08] here in the mind. Amen. This person says
[1:07:10] this is what's right and the other
[1:07:12] person says this is what's right. I want
[1:07:14] to know what God said was right. Amen.
[1:07:16] And when we can find what God said was
[1:07:18] right, we will find that a lot of the
[1:07:20] battle will be finished. But does it go
[1:07:22] away completely? No. We face a battle
[1:07:26] every single day. That's right. And that
[1:07:28] battle really is not People say, "Well,
[1:07:30] that battle's between, you know, God and
[1:07:33] Satan." Not really. That battle is not
[1:07:37] even between you and
[1:07:39] Satan. Am I confusing anybody?
[1:07:43] That battle is between you and what you
[1:07:46] believe.
[1:07:50] Because when you believe the word and it
[1:07:52] became your absolute and you're sold out
[1:07:55] to the word. Yeah. Right. Satan no
[1:07:57] longer. Jesus, my brother and sister,
[1:08:00] look how Satan tried to anoint, maybe
[1:08:02] you don't look at it this way, but how
[1:08:03] Satan tried to anoint Jesus to go to the
[1:08:06] peak of the temple and leap off. You
[1:08:08] know what he was really trying to do? He
[1:08:10] was trying to get Jesus to commit
[1:08:11] suicide. Yeah, that was in his mind. You
[1:08:14] go up there and jump off and surely the
[1:08:16] angels will get you. But Jesus didn't
[1:08:19] come and say, "Well, uh man, I don't
[1:08:21] know. That's a long ways up there and I
[1:08:23] might get hurt and what if the angels
[1:08:24] don't come?" But Jesus comes and takes
[1:08:27] Satan back to the word. Amen. He was
[1:08:31] showing us my faith even as Jesus Christ
[1:08:34] because I'm showing you as a people a
[1:08:37] foundational stone that you can build
[1:08:40] upon. It is not how I feel. He was
[1:08:42] hungry. Amen. He was, you might say, a
[1:08:45] little discouraged. Everything been in
[1:08:46] the wilderness and Satan's coming
[1:08:48] throwing this onslaught at him. But
[1:08:50] really what Jesus come back and said
[1:08:52] through those verses, if you look at
[1:08:53] them very closely, I believe the word.
[1:08:56] Amen. The word said,
[1:08:59] amen. That's right. There's where the
[1:09:01] battle's at. Satan's out here. He's
[1:09:04] whispering in our ear. But when you are
[1:09:05] sold out and absolutely believe the
[1:09:07] word, you stand there and you'll do just
[1:09:09] exactly what Jesus gave us for an
[1:09:11] example. The word says, well, the word
[1:09:14] says I'm his sheep. The word says I'm
[1:09:17] his lamb. The word says I have been
[1:09:20] redeemed and the blood has covered me
[1:09:22] and I have been called of God before the
[1:09:25] foundation of the world. That's what the
[1:09:26] world says when it speaks. The word says
[1:09:28] when it speaks to me. Amen. It's not
[1:09:31] speaking I don't know who I am. I'm lost
[1:09:33] in this world. I'm a drift. I'm not sure
[1:09:35] what I am or what I should be. I don't
[1:09:37] know. No. My brother and sister, thank
[1:09:39] God. Somebody ought to thank the Lord
[1:09:41] this morning that when the word spoke to
[1:09:43] you, it said, "You are my son. You are
[1:09:45] my daughter. You are my chosen." Amen.
[1:09:49] Not the the whole world didn't hear that
[1:09:51] voice.
[1:09:52] Amen. Praise God. There's a voice
[1:09:54] speaking to us. Amen.
[1:09:58] And so let me find myself again get too
[1:10:01] excited here. Abolished in his flesh the
[1:10:04] immity the war. Amen. Even the law of
[1:10:07] commandments contained in the ordinance.
[1:10:08] For to make it himself of twain one new
[1:10:11] man. Amen. So making peace. And that he
[1:10:15] might reconcile both unto God in one
[1:10:17] body by the cross having slain the
[1:10:20] imnity
[1:10:22] thereby. Now I want to draw this word
[1:10:24] out immnity for just a moment.
[1:10:26] When you're not a
[1:10:31] Christian, you're just serving the flesh
[1:10:33] you're serving. Are you at peace with
[1:10:35] Satan?
[1:10:40] I'm going to throw a twister on you
[1:10:41] here. Is it okay if I throw a little
[1:10:42] curveball at you? You will not find one
[1:10:46] person on the earth that's at peace with
[1:10:48] Satan. That's right. Satan is their
[1:10:51] adversary, no matter their status of
[1:10:54] life.
[1:10:56] He's there to destroy them. Amen.
[1:11:00] Remember Ruth,
[1:11:03] Boaz, he has to go. They make their
[1:11:07] declaration of
[1:11:08] love and he says, "I I have to go
[1:11:11] because there's one closer than I." Now,
[1:11:15] my brother and sister, some people go,
[1:11:16] "Well, this baffles me a little bit,
[1:11:18] Brother Paul, but the one closer for you
[1:11:20] and I, cuz we were born in sin and
[1:11:22] shaped in iniquity. Who's the one
[1:11:25] closer?
[1:11:31] And that near kinsman says, "No, no, I
[1:11:35] can't do that because it will mar my own
[1:11:38] testimony." Let me tell you, my brother
[1:11:40] and sister, if Satan loves us so much,
[1:11:42] he would lay his life down for us. But
[1:11:46] he knows if he lays his life down, he's
[1:11:49] got at best some little small percentage
[1:11:52] of an opportunity to raise it up again.
[1:11:54] In other words, he knows that it's not
[1:11:56] going to happen. And so, Satan will
[1:11:59] never lay his down his life down for you
[1:12:01] and I because he knows he does not have
[1:12:04] the key or the seed of eternal life. And
[1:12:07] he's not going to die for you. He's not
[1:12:10] going to give himself for you. He's not
[1:12:12] going to become your redeemer. He's your
[1:12:14] destroyer.
[1:12:15] Amen. And people follow that and and I
[1:12:19] hope I want to skip ahead a little bit
[1:12:20] here. The reason they follow that is
[1:12:23] because they don't know who they are.
[1:12:28] Satisfy the flesh. Now, y'all that knew
[1:12:31] me for years back. I struggle with this
[1:12:34] to this day. My
[1:12:37] addiction. Those who know me well could
[1:12:39] voice it right now. What? My
[1:12:42] addiction? Yeah. ice
[1:12:47] cream. And the old
[1:12:50] Paul only thought about satisfying my
[1:12:54] desire for the ice
[1:12:57] cream. Now, take this natural here and
[1:12:59] bring it into a spiritual realm. But you
[1:13:02] see, God wakes us up one day and we
[1:13:05] realize it's more than satisfying this
[1:13:09] flesh.
[1:13:10] It's more than than satisfying our taste
[1:13:14] buds. It's more than what makes me feel
[1:13:17] good. And look at the world we live in
[1:13:19] today, my brother and sister. Uh uh uh
[1:13:22] recreation, entertainment dominates the
[1:13:25] world that we live in. What is he doing?
[1:13:27] He's feeding them that ice cream of the
[1:13:30] flesh and they're satisfying that. In
[1:13:32] the meantime, they're dying. Right? But
[1:13:36] God comes along and says, "I'm going to
[1:13:37] instill by the word discipline in you."
[1:13:41] That you're going to be able to stop and
[1:13:43] say, "You know what? That's not who I am
[1:13:45] out there." Amen. I no longer find
[1:13:47] pleasure out there. I find pleasure in
[1:13:49] my Lord Jesus Christ. Hey, and I'm
[1:13:52] telling you, I had a I had a young man
[1:13:53] in some youth meetings. He told me, he
[1:13:56] says, "Brother Paul, what I'm struggling
[1:13:57] with is being a Christian is
[1:14:00] boring." Wow.
[1:14:03] Um, okay. Uh, I mean, how do you answer
[1:14:06] that? Uh, I mean, I don't
[1:14:11] know. There was another brother there
[1:14:13] and he was like, "Try bungee jumping
[1:14:15] with a Bible in your pocket or
[1:14:17] something. That'll make it exciting."
[1:14:19] But my brother and sister, how do you
[1:14:20] answer somebody who thinks that serving
[1:14:23] God is boring?
[1:14:25] I tell you, I haven't had a boring day
[1:14:27] in my life. Amen. And the devil's either
[1:14:30] attacking, amen, God is blessing, or
[1:14:33] God's blessing while the devil is
[1:14:35] attacking. Amen. There's nothing boring
[1:14:38] about this. But you see how Satan frames
[1:14:40] it. It's all about how it's
[1:14:43] framed. And so you look and see today,
[1:14:46] my brother and sister, he come and
[1:14:48] preach peace. Verse 17,
[1:14:50] um, and preach peace to you which were a
[1:14:53] far off and to them that were nigh. So
[1:14:55] whether you're far off or nigh, he's
[1:14:57] preaching peace to you. And for through
[1:14:59] him we both have access by one spirit
[1:15:01] and to the father. Now therefore you are
[1:15:03] no more strangers and foreigners but
[1:15:06] fellow citizens with the saints of the
[1:15:09] household of God. Amen. That's why you
[1:15:12] walk through the door with an open
[1:15:13] spirit and open desire to serve God.
[1:15:16] It's not some process to become a
[1:15:18] brother. It's not a process to become a
[1:15:20] sister. It's not a process to become
[1:15:22] part of the church. We don't have
[1:15:23] membership roles. We don't have
[1:15:25] something you've got to serve. I've got
[1:15:26] a friend and and he said, "Bro, Paul,
[1:15:28] just thought you'd like to know. Uh, you
[1:15:31] know, he calls me preacher Paul." "Yeah,
[1:15:32] I thought you'd like to know." And I was
[1:15:34] like, "What is that?" I got accepted
[1:15:36] into the church. And I was like, "Oh, I
[1:15:38] I you've went there for a year." "Yeah,
[1:15:41] you have to go for a year faithfully to
[1:15:43] be accepted into the church." And I
[1:15:45] said, "You need to go read your Bible."
[1:15:48] Amen. When you say, "Lord, I believe
[1:15:51] he's accepted you into the body." Amen.
[1:15:54] Oh my brother and sister. He said,
[1:15:56] "There was a time or two I did and said
[1:15:58] some things that I thought that was
[1:15:59] going to, you know, disanol me out of
[1:16:01] this." Oh, my brother and sister, if
[1:16:03] that was the case, you're all disenol.
[1:16:07] Is there a perfect one here
[1:16:08] today? Not one except for our Lord
[1:16:12] Jesus. You see, so these ideas have been
[1:16:14] put in there that people think that they
[1:16:16] have to somehow still earn their way,
[1:16:20] work to achieve this
[1:16:24] and are built upon the foundation of the
[1:16:26] apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
[1:16:28] himself being the chief cornerstone, in
[1:16:30] whom all the building fitly framed
[1:16:32] together growth into a holy temple in
[1:16:35] the Lord, in whom ye also builded
[1:16:38] together for a habitation of God through
[1:16:41] the spirit. Now my brother and sister,
[1:16:43] this word habitation is what you were
[1:16:45] called to be. Amen. It is not an
[1:16:48] absolute in the spiritual sense. It's
[1:16:50] not a not a building not a building with
[1:16:52] a name over it. Amen. It it's who you
[1:16:55] were called to be. You were built to be.
[1:16:58] Now, I believe we're here as as
[1:17:00] believers. We know that God called us
[1:17:03] before the foundation of the world. So,
[1:17:05] as we stand here this morning or sit
[1:17:07] here this morning, my brother and
[1:17:09] sister, God's not having to recreate
[1:17:11] you. You always were a son or daughter
[1:17:14] of God. Can we say amen to that? Amen.
[1:17:16] We always were. This is who we always
[1:17:18] were. But we had an identity crisis and
[1:17:22] that's exactly what's happening in the
[1:17:24] natural in the world today that people
[1:17:26] have lost their identities. I'm sorry.
[1:17:28] Uh you know it just turns me a little
[1:17:31] bit when you see some 6'2 or three guy
[1:17:34] who's changed his name to Mary.
[1:17:37] There's something wrong. What is it? I'm
[1:17:39] not condemning the man. He's got a soul.
[1:17:41] I want to see that soul saved. But you
[1:17:43] see what it is is a spirit where they've
[1:17:45] lost their identity. That's what it
[1:17:48] really comes down to, my brother and
[1:17:50] sister. Not a a sexual orientation as
[1:17:52] the world tries to defend it as. They've
[1:17:55] lost their identity in Jesus Christ. And
[1:17:58] as they drift, Amen. Sorry to be a
[1:18:01] little random here, but I just read a
[1:18:03] little blip about this couple almost
[1:18:05] passed away from this experience, but
[1:18:07] they were out in the Pacific Ocean,
[1:18:09] southern Pacific, got in a in a water
[1:18:12] spout and it ripped the mast off of
[1:18:14] their ship, ripped the rudder off of
[1:18:16] their their sailboat a and uh they they
[1:18:19] used the engine for as long as they had
[1:18:21] gasoline, but it was never intended to
[1:18:23] propel them across the ocean. And then
[1:18:26] they're just a
[1:18:27] drift. and wherever the whims of the
[1:18:30] ocean were and they still had some
[1:18:33] nautical equipment had solar to charge
[1:18:35] that and and they're there and it was
[1:18:38] like something on the order of 11 days
[1:18:40] later the the chart in their in their
[1:18:43] cabin of their boat showed that they had
[1:18:45] drifted over
[1:18:47] here and then they drifted over here and
[1:18:51] 11 days later were there within a few
[1:18:54] hundred yards of where they first
[1:18:56] started drifting.
[1:18:59] Oh my, my brother and sister. Is that
[1:19:01] not the truth of humanity and life in
[1:19:04] this day when we lose who we are? We'll
[1:19:07] just drift and drift and drift and years
[1:19:09] might go by and you'll find yourself
[1:19:11] right almost back where you started. And
[1:19:14] I'll tell you a positive side. And the
[1:19:15] reason I bring this up because I know a
[1:19:17] man who walked away from serving God at
[1:19:20] 18 years old and 40 years. He's 58 years
[1:19:24] old. Well, actually he's my age, so he's
[1:19:26] 63 now. But for 50 years, my brother and
[1:19:30] sister, 40 years, he he drifted in life
[1:19:33] and he found himself back and he come to
[1:19:36] a day he says, "Now, why did I quit
[1:19:39] serving God?" All those years of
[1:19:41] drifting brought him right back. And he
[1:19:43] thought, "Well, if I go back to church,
[1:19:45] they're going to walk in there and say,
[1:19:46] "Oh, a
[1:19:47] prodal. Oh, this. Oh, that." But
[1:19:51] something compelled him. Something
[1:19:52] gripped his heart. And one Sunday
[1:19:54] morning, he got out of bed and he put on
[1:19:57] the best clothes he had and he went down
[1:19:59] and went into the church and he went in
[1:20:01] there and sat on the back row. Now, he
[1:20:03] didn't look like he did when he was a
[1:20:05] kid. But somebody says, "Are you?" And
[1:20:07] he said, "Yes, I am." And they threw
[1:20:10] their arms around him and started
[1:20:12] crying, "Oh, God has brought you back."
[1:20:17] And he says, "At that moment, I hadn't
[1:20:18] even decided I was coming back. I
[1:20:20] thought I was just testing the waters.
[1:20:23] But you see, someone saw something. Saw
[1:20:26] the supernatural power of God. What was
[1:20:28] it? Not just a lost lamb that was on a
[1:20:31] rock in the canyon in the briars, my
[1:20:33] brother and sister, but they saw someone
[1:20:36] who was a part of God's flock. Amen.
[1:20:39] Part of God. And it was part of that.
[1:20:41] They recognized that. And the man says,
[1:20:44] "Well, I don't know. That was a a hard
[1:20:46] experience." He said he felt like he had
[1:20:48] worked a whole hard day of labor. And he
[1:20:50] said, "But maybe I'll go back on
[1:20:52] Wednesday and I'll try it again just
[1:20:54] just to see if it's the same." And it it
[1:20:56] feels the same way. I don't know if I
[1:20:58] can do this. He goes back on Wednesday.
[1:21:00] He goes home from a Wednesday night
[1:21:01] service and he's like, "That was
[1:21:04] refreshing." But I'll tell you what
[1:21:06] Satan wanted to do. Satan wanted to tell
[1:21:08] him that Sunday service was too rough.
[1:21:10] You don't want to live a life like that.
[1:21:12] You don't want that pressure. Well, I
[1:21:14] tell you, the pressure, my brother and
[1:21:15] sister, is a pressure we put on oursel.
[1:21:18] It's a pressure that Satan anoints
[1:21:20] people to to put on people. But God's
[1:21:23] not pressuring. God says, "This is my
[1:21:26] lamb, and I'm calling my lamb home, and
[1:21:28] my lamb will come home because he is my
[1:21:31] lamb. Amen. She is my lamb. She will
[1:21:34] come home."
[1:21:37] And God's word is true. Amen. No. So,
[1:21:39] God's looking for a habitation. Are we
[1:21:40] doing okay? Amen. I'm sorry. Just a
[1:21:43] little excited this morning. I like
[1:21:45] being excited. Actually, I I probably
[1:21:46] shouldn't even apologize. I like being
[1:21:48] excited to preach the word. Amen. Now,
[1:21:51] look at this word 22. In whom you also
[1:21:54] build it together for a habitation of
[1:21:56] God through the spirit. Now, habitation
[1:21:59] is called to be or built to be a
[1:22:02] dwelling place. Amen. It's not a rented
[1:22:05] room. Let me tell you this morning,
[1:22:08] saints, God's not wanting to rent you as
[1:22:11] a habitation.
[1:22:13] You are his habitation. You are his that
[1:22:16] he called. You are his that he created.
[1:22:18] You are his that he identified. And you
[1:22:21] are his that he is redeeming right now.
[1:22:24] Well, actually, you're already redeemed.
[1:22:25] But he's bringing you back. You see, not
[1:22:28] a rented room. Amen. I'm glad hotels
[1:22:31] exist. When I was a backslid teenager, I
[1:22:34] slept in cars. I got pretty good. I knew
[1:22:36] right where to put this and to put that
[1:22:38] so I could sleep comfortable. And it
[1:22:40] sounds silly. Amen. I don't know why I'm
[1:22:41] making this point. Sounds silly. I had
[1:22:43] thousands of dollars under the seat, but
[1:22:45] to me it was just such a waste to waste,
[1:22:47] you know, expensive different age. A
[1:22:50] whole $45 on a room just to sleep there.
[1:22:54] So, I just slept in my truck. I was
[1:23:01] homeless. I was so proud of my
[1:23:05] habitation. No, I wasn't. I wasn't. I
[1:23:08] faced a lot of ridicule, a lot of
[1:23:10] questions like, "What's wrong with you?
[1:23:12] Now, my brother and sister, God's
[1:23:14] telling us here through the word, he
[1:23:17] wants us to not be a rented room.
[1:23:22] He wants to own us. Amen. And that's
[1:23:26] what scares people. You mean I can't be
[1:23:28] my own man or woman if God owns me?
[1:23:31] Well, actually, you will become what you
[1:23:35] really are when you recognize who you
[1:23:39] really are.
[1:23:42] Satan by a strong delusion has people
[1:23:45] thinking they're
[1:23:48] successful when really they're just a
[1:23:51] rented room
[1:23:55] a little bit of time. I want to know is
[1:23:58] salvation temporary
[1:24:01] or
[1:24:05] forever? Depends on whose theology
[1:24:07] you're listening to.
[1:24:10] If you were ever, if you're of God
[1:24:13] now, you always were. That's right. Of
[1:24:16] him. Amen. If you ever were, you are
[1:24:19] now. Amen. That's how simple it comes
[1:24:22] down, my brother and sister. God's not
[1:24:23] here just ready to rent a room. He wants
[1:24:26] to own you. He wants to occupy. Maybe
[1:24:29] the word own isn't quite right. If that
[1:24:31] would be okay if I change that. He wants
[1:24:34] to to to claim you. Amen. This is not as
[1:24:38] it were ownership. I paid a Wait, he did
[1:24:41] pay a price for us.
[1:24:44] Wait, he did redeem us by his blood.
[1:24:51] Wow, I'm in a conflict. Do I claim
[1:24:54] ownership
[1:24:55] or long-term lease?
[1:24:59] Come on, saints. Let's not dodge around
[1:25:01] this.
[1:25:03] We are his. That's right. Let's give him
[1:25:06] full rights to what he has redeemed.
[1:25:09] Give him full rights and be able with
[1:25:12] with not trepidation, not with shame
[1:25:15] say, "Well, I'm serving the Lord." No.
[1:25:17] To be able to say, "Praise God. I'm
[1:25:19] redeemed." Amen. And I belong to Jesus
[1:25:22] Christ. I am his and he is mine. Amen.
[1:25:27] You know, it actually takes revelation.
[1:25:29] You realize that now we can talk about
[1:25:31] in the flesh by knowledge and say,
[1:25:33] "Well, I'm a son of God.
[1:25:36] And the waves of
[1:25:38] life, the troubles of life,
[1:25:40] circumstances of
[1:25:42] life can cause us to say, "Well, I
[1:25:46] thought I was a Christian. I don't know
[1:25:47] if I'm a
[1:25:48] Christian. Had a little trouble at work
[1:25:50] today. Had a little trouble with family.
[1:25:51] Had a little trouble. Had my own version
[1:25:53] of road rage." You know, I love that
[1:25:55] when the brother shared the story with
[1:25:57] us years ago about how that his son left
[1:26:00] that little kid's toy with a steering
[1:26:01] wheel and a shifter and a horn and he's
[1:26:05] driving in the road and he's frustrated
[1:26:06] and he's just like, "Oh, what's wrong
[1:26:08] with these crazy people?" And he looks
[1:26:10] over and there's this kid's toy laying
[1:26:11] in the seat and he picks it up and he's
[1:26:13] just there. These cars are driving silly
[1:26:16] and he he's just sitting there in his
[1:26:17] lap and he's holding the horn
[1:26:21] down. Now, he didn't do it with his own
[1:26:23] horn, but it became an
[1:26:25] outlet. And he said he wouldn't give the
[1:26:28] toy back to his
[1:26:29] son. He's driving to work and whatnot.
[1:26:32] Found himself all the time with his
[1:26:34] thumb on it. And then one day, a brother
[1:26:36] was preaching in their church and he's
[1:26:38] like, "Lord, deliver
[1:26:39] me." Regardless of how I express it, I
[1:26:42] still have rage. That's right. Let's not
[1:26:46] fool ourselves, okay? God wants to
[1:26:48] deliver us from those kind of things.
[1:26:50] Amen.
[1:26:55] So when you have a revelation of who you
[1:26:58] are, Satan cannot take that away from
[1:27:00] you. Satan never gave it to you. Satan
[1:27:03] cannot take it away from you. Amen.
[1:27:06] Aren't you glad? Satan's not going to
[1:27:08] come like a robber in the night and take
[1:27:10] the revelation of who you are from you.
[1:27:12] Amen. But when you hold on to the word
[1:27:14] and fully commit yourself to it, sell
[1:27:16] out to Jesus Christ. Amen. and know who
[1:27:19] you are. There's nothing on earth, Amen.
[1:27:22] I remember years ago, um, some of you
[1:27:24] would know this sister, Amen, got cancer
[1:27:27] and and took her right down. on our
[1:27:29] sister Beth took her right down to the
[1:27:31] point that the doctors just even gave
[1:27:33] her minutes to live. But then the Holy
[1:27:36] Spirit come down one night, moved right
[1:27:38] through the house, touched her life. And
[1:27:41] now the medical for that kind of cancer,
[1:27:43] there is used to be a zero
[1:27:47] chances of survival. And now they have I
[1:27:50] don't know how many zeros they have
[1:27:52] there, but there's a one on the end of
[1:27:53] it because she is the one. And I'll tell
[1:27:56] you my brother and sisters, Satan would
[1:27:57] like to destroy you and I. He says that
[1:28:00] looks like a lamb of God. It's not just
[1:28:02] someone walking around on the earth.
[1:28:04] That's a lamb of God. I'm going to send
[1:28:06] the wild beasts. I'll send the the
[1:28:08] briars. I'll send the cliff and the
[1:28:10] rock. I'll send the raging river going
[1:28:13] through the chasm. I'll do all of this
[1:28:15] to destroy that lamb. But I tell you
[1:28:17] what, my brother and sister, the
[1:28:18] shepherd shows up every single time and
[1:28:22] saves the lamb. Amen. It's not just a
[1:28:26] common lamb. It's a chosen lamb. A
[1:28:28] pre-seelelected lamb. A lamb that's been
[1:28:31] blessed before the foundation of the
[1:28:33] world. Forgive me for getting too
[1:28:35] excited here. But when you know by
[1:28:37] revelation who you are, there is nothing
[1:28:39] going to stop you from serving God. And
[1:28:42] the scripture says there's nothing can
[1:28:44] separate you from the love of God. Oh my
[1:28:48] brother, I'll tell you, it's amazing
[1:28:50] sometimes what we
[1:28:52] experience. just uh just recently
[1:28:55] talking to a man and he puts it out. He
[1:28:57] says, "I know I know better and I don't
[1:28:59] know why I'm ashamed to even say this to
[1:29:00] you, brother Paul, but I sometimes
[1:29:03] question, does God love me?"
[1:29:06] Banish that come from the devil. Amen.
[1:29:10] You wouldn't even
[1:29:11] care. You wouldn't even care if God
[1:29:15] didn't love you. That's right. You would
[1:29:18] be void of any desire to even serve God.
[1:29:22] But he loves you. Amen.
[1:29:26] If I'm being too aggressive, forgive me.
[1:29:29] Psalms 100:es
[1:29:32] 1-5. Now, we maybe want to read this
[1:29:35] more often in church till we break this
[1:29:37] stiffness around the church. I'm not
[1:29:39] talking about being some wild crazy
[1:29:42] Pentecostals running off, bouncing off
[1:29:44] the
[1:29:45] walls. Make a joyful noise unto the
[1:29:48] Lord, all you lands. Serve the Lord with
[1:29:51] gladness. Come before his presence with
[1:29:54] singing. Amen. Know ye that the Lord, he
[1:29:57] is God, and it is he that hath made us,
[1:30:02] not we ourselves.
[1:30:06] Well, praise God. Amen.
[1:30:09] I bump shoulders with a lot of people
[1:30:11] and I'm sorry to just keep referring
[1:30:13] back to it, but when you run into
[1:30:15] somebody kind of almost puts their
[1:30:16] thumbs in their deal, I'm a self-made
[1:30:19] millionaire.
[1:30:21] And I tell you what, these quotes come
[1:30:22] up. No man hath made himself.
[1:30:29] And whatever success we have as sons and
[1:30:32] daughters of God is God's blessings
[1:30:36] raining down on us.
[1:30:40] My anybody blessed in this building.
[1:30:43] I'll tell you what, I'd have to lift
[1:30:45] both hands a foot. Jump up and down.
[1:30:47] Amen. Whatever. God has blessed me
[1:30:50] beyond measure. Amen.
[1:30:55] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:30:57] It is he that hath made us and not we
[1:30:59] ourselves. We are his people and the
[1:31:02] sheep of his pasture. Enter into his
[1:31:06] gates with thanksgiving and into his
[1:31:08] courts with praise. Be thankful unto him
[1:31:10] and bless his name. For the Lord is
[1:31:13] good. Can we say amen? His mercy is
[1:31:16] everlasting. Amen. And his truth
[1:31:18] endureth to all generations. Amen.
[1:31:22] Hallelujah. You see what it comes down
[1:31:24] to is no way an individual can serve God
[1:31:26] on his own. That's right.
[1:31:29] Can't do it. That's right. And we're not
[1:31:32] called to live in the gate.
[1:31:37] Not called to live in the gate.
[1:31:41] You know, take you back to my days of
[1:31:44] working with
[1:31:45] cattle. The one that bothers you the
[1:31:48] most is the one that thinks it can just
[1:31:49] stand in the gate all the time. two feet
[1:31:53] in and two feet out.
[1:31:57] Amen. You don't know which end that you
[1:31:59] want to do. You know, it's like uh uh
[1:32:01] how do I get them to move? Well, I never
[1:32:04] took joy in in doing that, but somebody
[1:32:07] invented this battery powered thing
[1:32:09] called a hot shot and you just get on
[1:32:11] the end that needs to go the other
[1:32:13] direction and they'll move. Amen. How
[1:32:16] would you guys feel today if God come
[1:32:18] right in the house of God and start
[1:32:19] using a hot shot on you?
[1:32:21] We'd be offended. We We walk out of
[1:32:23] church. We'd say, "Man, I am never going
[1:32:26] back there."
[1:32:29] Well, maybe God needs you to move.
[1:32:31] That's right. Maybe God wants to shock
[1:32:34] you. That's right. A little bit to get
[1:32:37] you to move. That's right. Because you
[1:32:40] see, otherwise we just stand in the
[1:32:42] gate. And you know, there's another
[1:32:44] interesting fact from my days of working
[1:32:46] with cattle. Amen. is that you will see
[1:32:49] that there are those cattle that they
[1:32:52] usually are the same ones that stand in
[1:32:53] the gate. They're also the ones who walk
[1:32:55] the fence. That's right. And u you got
[1:32:58] this whole big beautiful pasture out
[1:33:00] here. Amen. And um you know, hope you
[1:33:05] don't mind my analogy. Got this big
[1:33:07] beautiful pasture to feed off of and the
[1:33:11] only place they can go is John 3:16.
[1:33:14] They want to walk the fence.
[1:33:17] Well, my brother and sister, there's a
[1:33:18] lot more than John 3:16's here. Amen.
[1:33:21] There's a whole pasture full of
[1:33:24] luscious, luscious food to bless them.
[1:33:27] But they'll walk the fence because you
[1:33:29] see, they can the same two feet that
[1:33:31] were outside of the gate, men are
[1:33:33] longing to be outside of the fence. And
[1:33:35] they can then justify themselves. Well,
[1:33:37] you know what? Really, God loves me so
[1:33:39] much. He gave his only begotten son for
[1:33:41] me, so therefore all is well. No, he
[1:33:44] gave you the whole pasture to feed on.
[1:33:47] Amen. He gave you the whole thing. And
[1:33:49] you know, when you're out on ranch
[1:33:51] rangeand, sometimes, you know, you have
[1:33:53] to have a rider that comes out and and
[1:33:56] uh just pushes the cattle away. And
[1:33:58] people are like, "Isn't that kind of
[1:33:59] cruel to push the cattle away from the
[1:34:00] water hole?" No, I'll tell you, it's not
[1:34:02] cruel at all because they'll eat
[1:34:04] everything in sight around the water
[1:34:06] hole and never move from the water hole
[1:34:09] because that's the easy way. But I tell
[1:34:12] you what, the cow that brings back a big
[1:34:14] calf, amen, the cow that comes back
[1:34:17] healthy her own self is the cow that's
[1:34:18] willing to walk over the hill. Amen.
[1:34:20] She's willing to go seek out something
[1:34:22] better. She's willing to go seek out
[1:34:25] those things that are difficult.
[1:34:28] Oh, but I want easy life as a Christian.
[1:34:31] I want to be God's sheep. I don't want
[1:34:33] easy. If God says walk, then I want to
[1:34:36] walk. Amen. If he says go seek out more,
[1:34:39] there's more to be had. Go find more.
[1:34:41] Amen. A deep calling. There has to be a
[1:34:44] deep to respond. And if you want to be,
[1:34:47] pardon me, putting this way, if you want
[1:34:49] to be a water hole Christian, then just
[1:34:51] be a water hole Christian. But if I got
[1:34:53] to climb a mountain, and go through a
[1:34:54] valley, walk across a desert to get what
[1:34:57] God has for me. I want to be that kind
[1:34:59] of believer. I want to say nothing's
[1:35:02] going to stop me from being what God
[1:35:04] called me to be. Amen. I don't want it
[1:35:06] easy. I don't need it easy. I don't need
[1:35:08] to be rich. I don't know it to be
[1:35:10] anything. And he promised that he would
[1:35:12] give us what we needed to survive, what
[1:35:14] we needed to live here in this life. He
[1:35:16] promised that to us. So why are we going
[1:35:19] to be fence walking believers?
[1:35:22] Let's go and search out the deep things
[1:35:25] of God. Amen. So you know what uh
[1:35:30] individual when God wakes you up, aren't
[1:35:34] you glad God wakes us up?
[1:35:36] Amen.
[1:35:38] When he wakes you up, just say, "Look,
[1:35:40] I'm going to serve you, Lord. I I I just
[1:35:42] don't I don't
[1:35:45] know. I keep getting distracted here.
[1:35:48] Forgive
[1:35:51] me." So, do we believe God already knows
[1:35:54] who's his? Yes, sir. Some people say
[1:35:56] there's no way there's free moral agency
[1:35:58] if God already knows who he is. Ah, but
[1:36:01] don't misunderstand. God didn't make you
[1:36:03] serve him. That's right. God placed in
[1:36:06] you. That's right. A desire. That's it.
[1:36:10] A seed. And the more that seed is
[1:36:15] watered. You mind my farmer
[1:36:18] analogies? So, here we are. We're
[1:36:20] already working on kneeh high
[1:36:23] corn. Amen. So, we're going to satisfy
[1:36:26] the old farmer's thing about kneeh high
[1:36:28] by the 4th of July. Those of you
[1:36:30] sometimes see sister Jerry's social
[1:36:31] stuff. Our idea kneeh high is about
[1:36:33] right here. But my brother and sister, I
[1:36:37] I've got corn that's this tall also.
[1:36:42] And as the pivot is going around in
[1:36:43] circles, irrigating, there's some of
[1:36:45] that corn that's just outside of it.
[1:36:48] It's thirsty all the time, but there's
[1:36:51] nothing there to satisfy it. Will it
[1:36:54] stop growing? As long as there's a
[1:36:57] little water, it'll still grow.
[1:37:00] And sometimes it'll even bring forth
[1:37:01] fruit, just not much. That's right.
[1:37:04] Amen. That's right.
[1:37:07] But boy, I tell you what, in the center
[1:37:09] of that pivot
[1:37:11] in that fertile soil of the soul. Amen.
[1:37:15] Amen. We've already got corn that's all
[1:37:17] the way up here. Amen. Cuz it's
[1:37:19] thriving. It's happy. Every day it's got
[1:37:22] its hands up saying, "Oh, praise God.
[1:37:24] The sun came up again. I've got
[1:37:27] everything I need to satisfy myself. I'm
[1:37:29] just going to take in and push out and
[1:37:32] just keep on growing. And God said that
[1:37:34] he's already ordained your pathway. And
[1:37:38] God never called a son or daughter of
[1:37:39] God to be some dehydrated runt stunt of
[1:37:42] a plan, a runt stunt of a believer. He
[1:37:45] called us to live in his blessings. And
[1:37:47] I already read the scripture to us that
[1:37:49] he's pouring those blessings out on us.
[1:37:51] Amen. Let's be here with our hands up
[1:37:54] and receive the blessings that God's got
[1:37:56] for us and say, "Lord, I'm going to take
[1:37:57] that in and I'm going to live
[1:37:59] everything, this word, this blessing
[1:38:00] you're pouring out on me. I'm going to
[1:38:02] live that." Amen. I don't want to be
[1:38:05] over here this little runed, stunted
[1:38:07] plant that will never produce a seed.
[1:38:10] Amen. Excuse me. I'm getting carried
[1:38:13] away, but I I'm excited today to be
[1:38:15] carried away. Hallelujah. Now in John 10
[1:38:21] um 25 through30 he says Jesus said I
[1:38:24] told you and you believe not the works
[1:38:26] that I do in my father's name they bear
[1:38:28] witness of me but you believe not
[1:38:31] because you're not of my sheep right wow
[1:38:36] you know that reminds
[1:38:37] me where brother Brandham I looked at
[1:38:40] the quote today I didn't include it but
[1:38:41] brother Brandham was telling the story
[1:38:43] about that shepherd well-trained
[1:38:46] sheep In other words, they weren't just
[1:38:49] throw a little feed and left alone. And
[1:38:52] he goes to walking down the street in
[1:38:55] town and there's
[1:38:58] fruit, apples and pears and all of this.
[1:39:03] And the sheep just walk behind their
[1:39:06] master and they walk by all these
[1:39:09] delectable
[1:39:11] things, but that's not where the
[1:39:13] master's taking them. That's right. And
[1:39:15] then they're trained well enough that if
[1:39:18] the master even stops and steps to the
[1:39:21] side, they keep right on
[1:39:24] going. Well, I quit serving God because
[1:39:27] my pastor quit serving God. I don't pray
[1:39:30] because they don't pray. I don't live
[1:39:33] right because they don't live right.
[1:39:35] Well, that's a lot of excuses people
[1:39:37] have for veering off the path that God
[1:39:39] has given. Well, because they did, I
[1:39:42] did. Well, how about we go a little
[1:39:44] further and say, because I've been well
[1:39:46] taught by the word of
[1:39:48] God, God's message in this hour doesn't
[1:39:52] come to a point and say, "Well, wing it
[1:39:53] from here." It takes us right from the
[1:39:56] beginning, takes us all the way through
[1:39:58] our growth stages in our maturity, right
[1:40:02] into the redemption, and takes us right
[1:40:04] into a rapture. It doesn't come to a
[1:40:06] point and people be sitting there
[1:40:08] saying, "I don't know what to do from
[1:40:09] here. I don't know what to do. I don't
[1:40:11] know what to do. Everybody around me
[1:40:13] lost their way. Should I lose my way,
[1:40:15] too? No, my brother and sister. I'm his
[1:40:17] sheep and I'm in his pasture. I don't
[1:40:19] have to follow someone else. I have to
[1:40:21] follow his word. Amen. And when I follow
[1:40:24] his word, Amen. I don't have to worry
[1:40:26] about what that man across the country
[1:40:27] has got his little podcast and his
[1:40:29] little broadcast. I don't have to worry
[1:40:31] about these people over here that are
[1:40:33] sliding off the edge and going back to
[1:40:35] the world. I don't have to worry about
[1:40:37] how these people interpret it. I don't
[1:40:39] have to do anything because I've got his
[1:40:41] word. I've got his direction. But the
[1:40:44] word says it wasn't just something we
[1:40:46] held in our hand. It's written in our
[1:40:48] heart. Oh my. Aren't you glad we don't
[1:40:51] have to, you know, I always joke. I said
[1:40:52] this to a policeman once. He did not
[1:40:54] appreciate it at all. But I had
[1:40:57] forgotten my wallet and I I did a little
[1:40:59] something. Um uh I think I d was driving
[1:41:02] just a little too fast or something. He
[1:41:04] pulls me over and um and I kind of knew
[1:41:09] this guy. It pays to know the deputies
[1:41:12] in your area. But anyway, he comes up,
[1:41:16] he looks at me like
[1:41:19] like insurance. I said, "Sir,
[1:41:23] uh you're probably not happy about this,
[1:41:24] but I forgot my wallet this morning. I I
[1:41:26] don't have my driver's license." Well,
[1:41:29] you know, according to Idaho statute, da
[1:41:30] da da da da, you know, you're not
[1:41:32] supposed to legally drive a car without
[1:41:34] your license. And I said, sir, but when
[1:41:36] I laid my license down, I didn't forget
[1:41:38] how to
[1:41:42] drive. I quoted you the law, sir. And I
[1:41:46] said, "And I gave you a valid reason,
[1:41:49] sir." He says, "Paul, get your wallet,
[1:41:53] and I don't want to ever catch you again
[1:41:54] without it."
[1:41:55] Now, my brothers and sisters, think
[1:41:57] about my
[1:42:00] logic. I'm not with believers. I'm not
[1:42:03] in church. Did I forget how to be a
[1:42:09] Christian?
[1:42:11] H
[1:42:13] even when Satan would be
[1:42:16] there. Uh, now I those of you that
[1:42:19] speed, you know, I
[1:42:23] mean, don't think I'm judging you cuz my
[1:42:25] family is probably the greatest
[1:42:26] offenders
[1:42:27] here. And
[1:42:29] uh, but
[1:42:33] look, whatever caused you to
[1:42:37] speed, we know better.
[1:42:42] And you don't tell the police officer,
[1:42:44] "I'll speed if I want to.
[1:42:47] you'll also collect a ticket whether you
[1:42:49] want to or
[1:42:51] not. So you see our attitude how we
[1:42:54] approach these things. Now this will be
[1:42:56] a little personal but how many of you
[1:42:59] have broke the law recently
[1:43:05] natural spiritual
[1:43:07] we broke the law.
[1:43:10] We should have been judged.
[1:43:14] We knew better.
[1:43:17] But I love grace.
[1:43:19] I love grace.
[1:43:22] You see, we are lambs. We're sons and
[1:43:25] daughters of God. But God still placed
[1:43:28] grace in our lives as a como uh a um
[1:43:33] component of our life every day. Grace,
[1:43:37] grace, grace. You see, my brother and
[1:43:41] sister, how much God loves us. How he's
[1:43:44] labored to redeem us. how he's wanting
[1:43:46] to show us I care for you and I've made
[1:43:48] a way already for you. I tell you, I'm
[1:43:51] so thankful. I'm so thankful I'm a
[1:43:55] sheep. Amen. I'm a lamb of God. I don't
[1:43:59] need to say I'm too mature for that. I'm
[1:44:01] not too mature to cry. I'm not too
[1:44:03] mature to repent. I'm not too mature to
[1:44:06] to seek the will and the wisdom of God.
[1:44:09] I don't want to ever become too mature
[1:44:11] to submit myself to the word of God.
[1:44:13] People say, "I'm too much of a man to do
[1:44:16] that." Well, I'll tell you what, my
[1:44:17] brother and sister. The size of the
[1:44:19] muscle do not make the man. Amen. How
[1:44:22] humble they are before God is what makes
[1:44:24] the man. Because remember, we were
[1:44:27] created and there was a connection in
[1:44:29] the image. Talking about science here, a
[1:44:32] connection in the image to beast.
[1:44:37] A son of
[1:44:38] God or a beast of who?
[1:44:42] The beast has brought forth its own
[1:44:45] seed. Sons of God are humble, not
[1:44:48] arrogant. Amen. Amen. Now, let me just
[1:44:51] close this up right here. I want to ask
[1:44:54] you, I won't preach this here. I just
[1:44:55] want to ask you, what's your outlook?
[1:44:57] What's your point of view?
[1:45:00] What are you looking at? What are you
[1:45:02] coming to church for? Amen. Amen. See,
[1:45:06] we need to know that. How do we see
[1:45:08] oursel?
[1:45:10] Are we placed here by our
[1:45:12] circumstance? More of the hand of
[1:45:14] Almighty God.
[1:45:17] We're here because he chose us to be
[1:45:18] sheep. Amen. Amen. He made the decision.
[1:45:23] And you can never make yourself a sheep.
[1:45:26] But when you recognize you are a sheep,
[1:45:28] the devil will never ever convince you
[1:45:31] you're a goat. Amen. God bless you.
[1:45:35] Amen. Let me just preach this last
[1:45:37] little paragraph I got written here. You
[1:45:39] see, there's a reason Satan's coming so
[1:45:41] hard in this hour right now. My brother
[1:45:43] and sister, I I don't recommend you
[1:45:45] follow these things, but in in the
[1:45:47] denominational world, there are megaurch
[1:45:50] pastors falling right and left. And I'm
[1:45:52] not judging or condemning them. My heart
[1:45:55] actually breaks because they've ended up
[1:45:57] in a position where it was man's
[1:45:59] leadership and they're trying to satisfy
[1:46:01] the people. They're trying to keep their
[1:46:03] the people in their church. you know,
[1:46:05] you you got 5,000 people or 10,000 or
[1:46:09] 20,000 that you're trying to keep them
[1:46:12] in the program, keep them engaged. And
[1:46:14] I'll tell you, my brother and sister,
[1:46:16] they struggle under that and the
[1:46:18] pressure and the temptation is there and
[1:46:20] it destroys them. It's very clear, it
[1:46:22] destroys them. But I tell you what, when
[1:46:24] God puts the desire in a heart of a son
[1:46:27] or daughter of God and they catch a
[1:46:29] revelation that I'm a lamb of God, you
[1:46:32] don't have to hothouse them. You don't
[1:46:34] have to babysit them. You don't have to
[1:46:36] do all these things, coaxing them to do
[1:46:39] it. When something's in the soul,
[1:46:41] they're there and saying, "I don't go."
[1:46:43] Although all hail assales me, I shall
[1:46:47] not be moved. They're holding on not to
[1:46:50] a church, not to a preacher, not to a
[1:46:52] ministry, but to a promise of the word
[1:46:55] that's in their heart, recognizing this
[1:46:58] is who I am. I am a lamb. Amen. and I am
[1:47:03] in his pasture. Amen. He already
[1:47:06] promised. I read the word to you. Amen.
[1:47:10] Don't be afraid of the wolf.
[1:47:15] Some people we know live kind of east of
[1:47:18] us back up in the mountains have cattle.
[1:47:21] They've sat right there fishing games.
[1:47:23] Spent tens of thousands of dollars and
[1:47:26] building wolf fence to keep the wolves
[1:47:29] on the
[1:47:31] mountain. and they sit right there and
[1:47:33] watch a wolf jump over an 8- foot tall
[1:47:35] wolf fence.
[1:47:38] You got no place to hide but Jesus
[1:47:41] Christ. Amen. Hallelujah. And we got
[1:47:43] nothing to fear because we are hiding in
[1:47:46] our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Sister
[1:47:48] Ruth, would you come? Musicians. Amen.
[1:47:51] I'll tell you, I'll just call that good.
[1:47:53] Times up. Uh but but look at this. Amen.
[1:47:57] I want to just share this one
[1:48:00] last one last portion here if you don't
[1:48:02] mind. Is that okay? Amen. People come to
[1:48:06] a place. It's like a spirit of the age.
[1:48:08] We got to defend
[1:48:09] ourselves. Somebody be like, "Well,
[1:48:12] well, what about this?" Well, I tell you
[1:48:14] why this and why that and I I've I'm
[1:48:17] just I'm going to defend
[1:48:19] myself. My brothers and sister, God
[1:48:21] never called you to defend yourself. He
[1:48:23] called you to actually surrender.
[1:48:26] Find a place outside of Christ to defend
[1:48:29] yourself.
[1:48:32] Let the word living in you defend you.
[1:48:34] Amen. Christ can't be defeated. That's
[1:48:37] right. Satan cannot defeat you. Amen.
[1:48:40] When you catch the revelation of who you
[1:48:42] are, Satan will never defeat you. That's
[1:48:45] where you live life with liberty. Amen.
[1:48:48] I'm a son of God. I'm from the
[1:48:49] foundation of the world. I've been given
[1:48:51] eternal life. I didn't have to earn it.
[1:48:52] God gave it to me. But I want to live
[1:48:54] for him. I will live for him. And then
[1:48:58] it's the very life of Christ in you.
[1:49:00] Amen. That defends you. Hallelujah. Song
[1:49:04] of
[1:49:04] Solomon. Now think about
[1:49:07] this. Second chapter verses
[1:49:10] 8 10
[1:49:15] or you got verse 10. I think we missed
[1:49:18] it there brothers. The voice of my
[1:49:20] beloved, behold, he cometh leaping upon
[1:49:24] the mountains, skipping upon the hills.
[1:49:27] My beloved is like a row or a young
[1:49:29] heart. Behold, he standeth behind our
[1:49:32] wall, and he lookth forth at the
[1:49:35] windows, showing himself through the
[1:49:38] lattice. Now, I wanted to tie this back
[1:49:41] together to what I said earlier. That
[1:49:44] veil, that lattice is the same as the
[1:49:46] veil that we talked earlier. We're
[1:49:49] looking through it. When you look
[1:49:50] through a veil, a lattice, a screen, you
[1:49:53] don't see things perfectly clear, but
[1:49:56] you do see what's there. And so, here is
[1:50:00] the word of God, Christ himself coming,
[1:50:03] and he's revealing ourselves to us right
[1:50:06] here, right
[1:50:07] now, through the
[1:50:10] lattice. The scripture says the day will
[1:50:12] come when we get to see him clearly. And
[1:50:15] that's not a rapture. That's not on the
[1:50:17] other side. That's a maturity. As sons
[1:50:19] or daughters of God, we come to a place
[1:50:21] that it's no longer I need to serve
[1:50:23] Jesus Christ, but it comes to the place
[1:50:25] he's real to me. He's so real to me.
[1:50:29] Now, let's just look at verse 10 here.
[1:50:36] Amen. My beloved spake and said unto me,
[1:50:41] Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come
[1:50:45] away. Amen. Amen.
[1:50:47] That's our day. That's right. Rise up.
[1:50:51] That's right.
[1:50:52] [Music]
[1:50:54] Rise up. Just any old person.
[1:50:58] Sorry to put this natural analogy
[1:51:01] there, but there's something wrong with
[1:51:03] relationship. If a man would walk in to
[1:51:07] a
[1:51:07] group and say, "Rise up, my love." And
[1:51:11] all the women in the in the room all
[1:51:13] stood up, people would be like, "What's
[1:51:15] going on?
[1:51:17] But you see, if his mother, his wife,
[1:51:21] his daughters were
[1:51:23] there, maybe like a natural
[1:51:26] sister, he might use a phrase like that
[1:51:28] and it not be out of
[1:51:30] place. Rise up, my
[1:51:32] love. But God's speaking to a bride
[1:51:35] today, my brother and sister. He's
[1:51:36] speaking to his
[1:51:38] lambs, and he's telling us, "Rise up, my
[1:51:41] love, and come away.
[1:51:45] come away. And you know, everyone that
[1:51:49] he has
[1:51:50] called recognizes that call. Amen. That
[1:51:53] we are his beloved. Amen.
[1:51:56] We are his beloved. Can someone say,
[1:51:59] "Thank you, Lord." Thank you, Lord.
[1:52:01] Amen. That we can recognize in this
[1:52:03] hour, we're not just churchgoing people.
[1:52:06] We're not members of an organization,
[1:52:08] but we have been called from the throne
[1:52:11] of God, from the foundation of the
[1:52:14] world. He said, "I have called you. I
[1:52:17] have birthed you, and I wrote your name
[1:52:20] in the palms of my
[1:52:23] hands." I'll tell you what, my brother
[1:52:25] and sister, if the devil ever comes and
[1:52:28] tells you you're not a daughter of God,
[1:52:30] you're not a son of God, you just tell
[1:52:32] the devil to go look at the palms of our
[1:52:34] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. It'll be right
[1:52:37] there in the palms of his hand according
[1:52:39] to the word. Amen. It'll be right there.
[1:52:42] Your name is there. Amen. Amen. If God
[1:52:44] would allow you, Satan, you grubby old
[1:52:46] guy, he allow you to look at the book,
[1:52:48] you'll find my name in that book. Amen.
[1:52:53] I don't care what you say, Satan. You
[1:52:55] might ridicule me, belittle me, beat me
[1:52:59] down, roll me in the dirt, drag me,
[1:53:02] bloody my nose. None of that matters. My
[1:53:04] name is in the book. Hallelujah. I tell
[1:53:07] you, that makes me happy this morning
[1:53:09] that my name can be found in that book.
[1:53:11] It's not just a story to be told, but
[1:53:14] it's a reality of sons and daughters of
[1:53:16] God. Hallelujah. Let's stand and just
[1:53:18] sing a song or two. Amen. I tell you, I
[1:53:22] got more more stuff here, but uh that's
[1:53:24] fine. Amen.

[1:57:35] by the binding chains of
[1:57:39] [Music]
[1:57:42] sin,
[1:57:43] but the great

[2:00:33] I thirsted in the barren land of sin and
[2:00:39] shame and nothing satisfying there I
[2:00:43] found.
[2:00:47] But to the blessed cross of Christ, one
[2:00:50] day I came, where springs of living
[2:00:55] water did
[2:00:58] abound. I'm drinking at the springs of
[2:01:02] living
[2:01:05] water. Happy now am I. My soul they
[2:01:11] satisfy. I'm drinking at the springs of
[2:01:15] living water.

[2:03:20] Amen. Help me. Now when I look around
[2:03:25] and see the good
[2:03:28] things he's done for me, I
[2:03:33] know I'm
[2:03:35] unworthy of them
[2:03:40] all. But his
[2:03:43] blessings he freely gives I
[2:03:47] owe my whole life to him. I've got so

[2:04:29] so much to
[2:04:32] thank him
[2:04:37] for.
[2:04:39] Sometimes while on life's way, I
[2:04:44] kneel and I stop and pray. Say, "Thank
[2:04:48] you,
[2:04:49] Lord, for all you've done for
[2:04:53] [Music]
