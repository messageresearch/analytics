up our brothers and sisters over in ukraine and russia lord father it's uh time of just chaos lord and war physical war lord and father every day lord the things that they're having to go through lord

things i may not know and there are some places i can't go but i am sure of this one thing my god is real for i can't feel him in my soul my god is real he's real in my soul [Music] my god is real for he has washed and made me whole his love for me it's like your goal my god is real for i can't feel him in my soul i just can't how it felt when jesus took my sins away ever since that day ever since

wonderful been given a gift hallelujah the world measures things in things like gold and silver and diamonds i'm glad god said i'm going to express to you a way you can measure it i have just given you all the gold there is in the world that would be a fraction of the representation of his love to us god bless you good to see you again i'm sorry i forgot your name but uh our visitor in the back was with us for a little bit on this last sunday and it's good to see her again we pray the lord bless her today just have a couple things that i want to go through here just please remember us as we travel going to be going uh to oh i hate to even say this out loud where it's warm [Laughter] we're going to be going to florida going to go to a marriage seminar that our brother barry coffey is putting on and um i always find a little humor in this you know sister jerry and i are going for sister jerry and i because i believe everything that's good can be better and brother trevor sister carrie brother chris and sister kristen christian we're going to go enjoy this time there and but my real heart's desire saints and that's what i'd ask you to pray for is i'd like to go to this marriage seminar and by god's grace be able to assimilate or absorbs things that might help me be a better pastor give better advice counsel in the times of trouble and so yes we are going to enjoy ourselves just a little bit reminds me of a little video clip of a pastor baptizing a young girl cute little girl and he's talked to her and she's like yes yes i i've asked the lord forgive me and yes and the pastor says now sweetheart after you get baptized and get the holy ghost where are you going disneyland so we're not exactly on that par but we might be but anyway please remember us in prayer and brother david's going to be preaching this coming wednesday sunday and the following wednesday so be lifting our brother david up in prayer that um the lord will just lay upon his heart just one of those 50 or 100 sermons that he has waiting just to choose the right the correct ones amen and so um i would ask that you uh would also remember uh brother vasily and sister toma they haven't been feeling well their heart's desire was to be in the house of god today and so just lift them up lingering effects of whatever little viruses and different things that might affect us and i believe what i've heard is that sister thomas mother had traveled to see her off and now is somewhere along the way back to danesque uh in russia with believers but she's caught there because of the conflict so please uh just remember and i'm sorry i can't recount what huh she's in russia i believe because they typically go out of kiev and go and go down if i understand right travel through russia and back in because of that occupied zone so let's just remember that and i'm what is sister thomas mother's name nina let's remember our sister in prayer lord be with her and um so also last announcement um or last two things i want to say um we have made great progress in the basement and sisters you have mentioned that when we quit making a mess that many of you had a desire to come and help clean and i believe we really literally are at the end of making a mess so i i say this from my heart just feel free if you have time feel the leading to come and just do your part i know sister sophie and sister grace sister ruth uh come friday evening and they might have gone away feeling like they didn't do a whole lot but i'm telling you every piece of the puzzle right every piece brings a completion of the puzzle so if you can only come for a little bit um you know and just i don't know do one little thing just remember you're you're filling a piece of the puzzle and uh so um just bring that to you the last thing i'm very excited about and we put a lord willing in front of this but our brother andrew is going to come and preach for us lord willing on june 12. and you know he's a fiery young man he gets excited he's not ashamed to jump and shout and yell hallelujah and and we're looking forward to that you know a new dimension i don't know if you know a new dimension in their life sister mariah is due i think middle of august uh with their first child so we're really thrilled for them as just going forward so anyway um brother andrew's been you know he just always keeps in touch he's always encouraging always sending little quotes and you know that's good saints i have something that's been a burden on my heart we brought it up as a prayer request but i want us to just take a moment and from the depths of our hearts as brothers have been sharing with me videos different things showing what's happening and and the ukraine to see as it is literally brothers have just a little bit of food they're not only afraid as it were to go outside but it doesn't matter because the market down the street is completely empty so there's nothing to go out for and the thing that stirs my heart so much and you see the responsive it is some people give up in the time of adversity some dig deeper brothers are having prayer meetings over the phone they don't dare leave their house they don't dare leave their basement and yet they're declaring the battle is not ours the battle is not ours it's the lord's and so as one brother shared this is simply satan trying to disrupt but he can't because the bride as the prophet said the bride is secure in the arms of her bridegroom and so whatever comes they have said thy will be done lord so let's just sincerely lift our hearts here feel free just to just to cry out in your own way remember brother chris what he preached here the other day and we lift our prayers in the morning and we lift our prayers in the evening and they come as a sweet saver before the lord let's lift our prayers this morning on behalf of our brothers and sisters russia ukraine but not just them all of eastern europe is in travail people are nervous people don't know what to do people nervous enough that even in the uh joining countries are already fleeing their borders to pull back just in case russia doesn't stop and so you see that fear is something that's been been just pressing look around us in the world we live in right now there's a fear for everything and satan is trying to press that fear because he knows that if we fall under that anointing of fear we will fear everything even to the place and i won't go into it it's on my sermon today we'll even fear the presence of god under that anointing of fear let's just lift our hearts to the lord for a moment oh heavenly father lord we just cry out to you this morning lord this is the part of the body of believers this is our family lord brothers and sisters in christ and father many of them already displaced lord many of them unable to go to church unable to see family lord many of them without food lord and water provision father but lord we know that your hand is upon them and lord as they are anointed by the word to declare my god is in control it is not my battle lord may we enter into that with them lord may our prayers come before you as a sweet odor today on behalf of our brothers and sisters lord and all of those people father and those nations in those areas father they might not know you may this be a season lord that they would be anointed to cry out to you and come close to you father lord it is kind of a shame in humanity that it takes a crisis lord but father whatever is necessary may father this be a time and a season that lord prayers are lifted to you and faith is risen up father to claim the promises now father we ask you lord whatever it is would be your perfect will lord we just desire that father your word decr declares that we would pray for life so lord we're asking you father give provision of water and food and of physical safety father lord come down in such a powerful way lord to raise the faith of the saints father to reach out lord and declare for you said that you would give the desires of the heart and lord these are not desires for worldly pleasure worldly wealth but lord desires for the security of brothers and sisters and of families and children lord we ask you father lord as we stand here today in relative security father we ask you lord to come into the battle and stand on behalf of our brothers and sisters and lord realizing in the day that we live in lord we may never see warfare in our street but lord spiritual warfare is raging around the world as satan knows his time is short and father i ask you just to give security and faith into the heart of your children lord that we would stand holding on to your word claiming your word confessing your word lord we ask now that you would just move even at this moment upon the saints in the ukraine and russia father just lord be their portion i pray today will bolster their faith lord that they might speak the very things the desires of their heart lord as we lift this to you now we thank you for your grace we thank you for mercy we thank you for your word lord for it's your word that secures us father we thank you today in the name of jesus christ amen and amen thank you brother jason musicians amen good to be in the house of the lord today hallelujah i want to speak to you this morning just a little title of when you see and um you know there comes a time my brother and sister that we'll kind of take hopefully by god's grace expound this a little bit this morning to be able to uh fill out this thought of when you see you know it's a beautiful thing to know my brothers and sisters um that god is present with us also here i wrote a quick note and i forgot it right here just as i was coming out my phone flashed and sister conscious sent a prayer request for brother prashant that he has sprained his neck and it's not getting better so let's just in our prayers this morning amen even as we're moving forward just lift up brother prashant's sister concha to to be with them be their portion today amen let's turn in our bibles to john the sixth chapter i have quite extensive readings out of the book of john so we'll be taking quite a bit of our thought if you have a red letter edition bible you'll see where we're where we're coming from um and as we look at this this morning we want to lay down the thought as it were of seeing and to just analyze it for a moment uh maybe break it down that we'd have a little greater clarity of the scripture and in these things john the sixth chapter starting with the 28th verse then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god not ask you this morning who wants to work the works of god now jesus lays out this clear pattern that might been so simple they missed it just on that alone this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent now my brother and sister if we have no faith in the messenger you can't say i believe the message without having faith in the messenger and so you know the critics let me just deviate for just a moment the critics of this day want to destroy the messenger while if you just go scan the networks as it were and just really see how many of them are actually preaching the message but they've taken this portion because they liked it and were inspired they've taken this portion but they don't want to be identified with the messenger because if you're identified with the messenger then you have to either have the praise or the shame that went with the messenger now we can take that into our day saints but let's go ahead and just take it back to jesus day they were like isn't he the son of mary you know what that meant you know remember mary that little girl down there was with child before her and joseph ever got isn't he her son so you have to be identified with the glory as it were and with the shame amen so here's the works that you believe on him whom he has sent they said therefore unto him what signs show us thou then that we may see and believe thee what thou dost what dost thou work our fathers now i'm going to dramaticize this they're standing there talking to him what are you going to do that we can believe because our fathers were there at the most supernatural event to ever take place in israel up to that time as they speak to the most supernatural event that's ever taken place in israel that we may see and believe thee what does thou work our fathers did he manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat then jesus said unto them verily say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven the message you believe where did it come from if you go on the internet it came from william branham but search the scriptures we'll take it back and anchor it right down to a foundation of where did it come from if it came from man then man must empower it moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth light unto the world then said then to him lord evermore give us this bread and jesus said to them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst but i said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not and i want to this is a little part of my my title today i want to take that as it is here because you see when you see it makes all the difference in your life but you've seen me and believe not and all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will and no wise cast out for i come down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the father's will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing now somebody ought to be able to say thank you lord amen no matter what happens in life our struggles our failures and all that satan would squawk my brother and sister you realize as satan if if he was allowed as it were to publish the annuals of your life would certainly have something like the inquirer he would never talk about the time prayer for others in your times of faith he would never talk about who you are and the foundation you're built on he would be there saying and they did this and they did that and we saw dirt on the hem of their garment over here and we saw this failure you see my brother and sister it all depends on who's writing this story i read once now i hope you catch the significance of this read once that the reason that all of these magazines like that are right at the checkout counter because if there was anywhere else in the building no one would waste the effort to go find them they put it right there now catch this at the time of checking out all the trash would be brought up in an expose you but god's version my brother and sister is empty page empty page empty page empty page oh thank you lord and it won't matter my brother and sister where or when or how it's just simply what god has done i should lose nothing but should raise it up again in the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day heavenly father lord we just ask you today lord open our eyes and father may today give me clarity father just to express this father it's not about lord what we see in this flesh lord it's not about what the world around us telegraphs to us but lord it's about you and it's about your word and the revelation of your word and father i pray today open our eyes lord that we truly can see lord of the day that we're living in not just your word but the signs also father bless lord the saints today those that are with us and those that are not father may you be with them equally father and may your holy spirit move in our midst i ask in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated as we look at these for a moment my brother and sister i want to go back as it were into these last verses for a moment we'll probably revisit them again a little later but you see i want to take this emphasis out of verse 40. this is the will of him that sent me so jesus is expressing to the people of what god has placed or the holy spirit had placed into him as a desire to express and he's expressing it this is the will that everyone which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day and my brother and sister i pray today that you can see or understand that we express this not as a judgmental fact to the world today but a true revelation of what god would bring out of his word and not just our ideology if you want to call it that because you see my brother and sister as the scripture says not all of israel was israel and so we're living in a day of christianity a huge portion of the world identifying in christianity and i believe that same principle would apply in the day that we live in not all that claims the name of jesus christ is a christian and so it's there that we'll look and and hopefully today be able to uh express to you uh this thought of seeing or recognizing what we are looking at and to recognize there's a time and a season uh i believe a lot of us uh could go back to a point in our life we read our bibles we had the identity of christians but there was so much that we did not see and my brother and sister i think it's just is equally important to recognize what we did not see in the season to be able to recognize where we have come from where we are moving to because it is by reading of the word of god that we have a closer relationship this is god in written form correct and so it's there that we can read this but if we don't understand the pages we don't understand what's in there my brother and sister now the word of god is is right here in the bible inspiration is right here and so it is sometimes bottled up in such a fashion uh uh that that people just don't get it they can read it uh they can read these things and uh and not have any comprehension and so i just moving forward on this i want to go into the sermon the deity of jesus christ jesus comes three times he came the first time to redeem his church he comes a second time to receive his church he comes the third time with his church everything in the bible travels in trinity's threes but all in one christ he remember the first time to redeem his church the second time to receive his church third time with his church as king and queen now that stirs my heart saint amen i get to come back as it were not looking as it is in the sense of our human flesh but i get to come back in a feminine form and be the queen the bride of jesus christ amen now that does not make us effeminate there's people of carnal minds it's like well these people talking about being the bride of christ that's just as perverted and they go off on some tirade that have total lack they are in the carnal they do not even see the types of the word expressed so if they cannot see that my brother and sister they must not be identified with it because the minute you become identified in the fact that god is calling back a wife a bride amen that you then recognize your position amen it don't make us brothers any less masculine we just recognize the relationship and how it's placed now but on his first coming we'll speak of just a little bit then on his being here and then on his second coming on it and then on the third time if the lord willing now in these days there was a great persecution against the church caesar augusta had made a great plan that he would tax all the people and that was only done for one purpose now you realize my brother and sister i want to lay this down as we're seeing things happening on the earth today there is only being done for one purpose so the mass confusion that went through all of the region you must go back to the place of your birth that we can tax you imagine what the roads must have looked like because families had moved from here to there and there to there and whatever and mass confusion so much so that as it were when joseph and mary arrive in town there's not even a place for them but look at what the prophet lays it out only done for one purpose and that's god's great prophecy would be fulfilled now i want you to think about what's going on in the world today okay this is kind of a crossing over of the world today and our thoughts here you see these things are being done for one purpose and that's that prophecy would be fulfilled now our hearts go out and trust me i've shed tears praying for the saints in ukraine and russia but my brother and sister on the other side when their voices echo back and they say this must come to pass god's will be done and they're the ones suffering there's an understanding they're seeing the plan of god unfolding before them and so this is done for one purpose that god's great prophecy would be fulfilled only thing you have to do when you see something in the bible sounds just a little mystic a little superstitious to you now we're not focusing on the mystic or the superstitious but i want you to focus on these words to come and a little superstitious to you just give god a little bit of time god is in no hurry we're the one that gets in a hurry just give god just a little bit of time and you will see the old prophetic wheels cogs run right up into the picture it will develop just like bringing up a picture and we are looking in the signs of the time my brother and sister a prophet of god said america would be bankrupt and could not pay it and it was there that their children are now they're spending the money the children 40 years from now will be doing i just heard a man say the other day if america went on an austerity movement it would take 100 years to erase this debt prophet said we'd be bankrupt here we are now look at these things you see it applies the scripture said that satan as a roaring lion now i'm not saying he is a roaring lion but it's as because you see if he is the roaring lion my brother and sister then that would mean that he would be an equal as it were to the line of the tribe of judah so he's coming as in other words he's projecting himself as a roaring lion and it's there of the intimidation my brother and sister of the fear of the doubts of the insecurities in the church ages the closing down as it is brother branham says and i was going to put the page down and i didn't bother because i actually had an old church age book in my hand when i looked this up and i know many of us uh you know are reading brother george has got his formatted uh to where it's a little easier to read so you can find it it's right there uh in the cusp of the philadelphia uh and church age and it's actually well anyway you can find it brother branham says there now watch russia watch russia king of the north now my brother and sister we'll look at that and we're seeing that now of flexing and i i have many brothers who have jumped and said this is it this is a thing this is it's going to happen now i i believe it very well could don't misunderstand me but i want you to take this quote that i just read you and i want you to stop and you will look at that and see that god don't want you to jump to conclusion god don't want you to suddenly get afraid of it is that oh my this is it it's happening god don't want you to react that way god wants you to give him time because he promised he would reveal these things to you he promised that there would be no mystery left to the bride of christ we are not here my brother and sister to measure our relationship with the lord by how close we are to the rapture because if it operated that way according to the nature of human humanity we would just wait until we knew five minutes come on do you agree with me too many of us are that way oh i've got time still he said i don't want you to react to this watch russia oh we got to get desperate my brother and sister i apply this to myself but we should be desperate all the time we should not come to a moment of desperation we should be desperate before the lord we should be lifting these things up amen the prophet of god said he'll come for those that are sighing and crying for the abominations in this city oh god don't let it take something like a russian evasion invasion for us to suddenly have a desperation to start praying for the world but it should be a part of our daily life it should be something within us that we're reaching out and saying you know what lord we have prophecy we have the scripture it's going to come to an end i don't know when but lord if you will just grant my prayer i will be ready there will be no moment of pleading see let the picture develop you see we have no need to speculate saints a lot of speculation flying around people are like well believe this is this brother brown said this brother brown said this good what happens if russia apologizes it goes home every one of their declarations becomes mute will they do that in the carnal world we'd say probably not but have you ever heard of a faint you know boxers do it all the time and the guy's like oh guard myself and it comes from a different direction see let's not waste our time trying to figure out what that is let's spend our time figuring out what this is let's spend our energy and our effort of lord instead of being afraid let me spend time in preparation you see as it says there it'll develop just like the bringing up of a picture it's going to come whether we're over here or not now you see i just would like to put this out to you with a sincere heart maybe it just you would maybe grasp onto this and take it but with a sin's heart sincere heart to say to the lord lord help me be ready morning noon or night not just sunday or wednesday or not just when we see the blow coming as it were but let us be ready morning noon and night and i tell you saints we want to do something for the saints of the ukraine and russia and whatever eastern europe that's impacted i'll tell you what we can do oh yes the doors might be opened they're working on that to be able to send monetary help my but if there's nothing on the store shelf pray in earnest pray in earnest for them the prophet of god said prayer changes things now if this is the season that russia moves to fulfill scripture then so be it but god will provide amen god will provide so let's provide a sweet odor before the throne to provide for them their necessity now let's look for a moment of what we see with our eyes what we see with our eyes my brother and sister oh prophet we're surrounded completely by the enemy oh my servant come up into heavenly places come on we can apply that come up to this place right here come on up get out of your point of view what you see with your eyes and get up here in heavenly places and you will recognize there's more with us than there is against us and that we are surrounded by the presence of almighty god but the eye will tell us the eye and the mind will tell us there's no hope and god says i am the author of hope oh i've got many more notes here but i believe you caught that my brother and sister our eyes can look at the circumstances and we'll be there saying okay how does this apply and how does that apply my brother and sister you see uh gog and magog are gonna come to pass whether we give two thoughts about it or not oh brother what's gonna happen if this happens and if that happens brother what's gonna oh in the middle east and what are they doing over here and what's gonna go on and how does this affect the bride of christ well if the bride of christ is caught up in a nervous state of affairs she's gonna have a breakdown that's not what the word said the word said that we would come and he is our peace amen he is our mighty fortress he is our provider he is our guide and once again to bring it in those words he's our comforter now you can't claim comfort in a tizzy i've got peace while i melt down no no no come on saints it's time for us to say look we are but one little cog in this wheel as it were and i'm gonna make sure that when the wheel comes around to the bride in the united states and more pacific to the state of idaho more specific to the town of nampa that my cog in the wheel is going to be ready in the time of need i'm not going to be having a meltdown oh lord i was so focused on what's happening with israel and so how about what happened here and what happened there i forgot to be prepared myself and if trouble comes our way i pray we have the kind of faith that we'd be picking our phones up and calling brother let's pray together families let's pray together amen the gods will be done amen that we can stand the test of our position of who we are in our cog in the wheel that we'll stand the test in the meantime the saints in south america and africa and wherever else as they are praying to fulfill their part in the body of christ my brother and sister when this body doesn't break down over what's happening somewhere else and is fortified in the word of god for our position in the body of believers then when it comes to us we will manifest and fulfill that without a collapse you see as we look with our eyes our eyes can be deceptive reminds me of a story i read a man went hunting was not a real experienced hunter had only been a christian i mean a hunter for a short while and he's there in the woods and he bought a tag for everything he looks across the canyon and there's the biggest bear he's ever saw in his life he gets his rifle up zeroes in gets himself steadied it doesn't move puts another shell in doesn't move four times as he's hiking down in the canyon to go up the other side he meets another hunter the hunter said was that you shooting he says yes it's me shooting he says what was your shooting at he said the biggest bear you ever saw the guy got all excited he says well well you know i'm not seeing anything i'll just go with you and help you and they hike up out of that canyon and they get over there and there is a fire blackened stump with four holes in it and he tells the other man he says i am sure i saw a bear they hike down go back to where he shot look across the canyon it looked just like a bear but you see unless the bear is petrified it will move so he didn't look at all the signs his eye told him my brother and sister we look out here our eyes are going to tell us a lot of things it's telling a nation that's moved now from one fear to another if you don't think that that is ordained to be that way that we move from one great thing to catch our attention remember church if you look back through time you'll you'll remember that i preached on the distracted generation that is what's exactly we're seeing i'm not boasting on paul but that's what we're seeing happen right now is a distracted generation is being one flash to another flash to another flash and they're looking at that and behind the scenes little things like the un is bringing up a resolution before the council that the next get it the next plague or pandemic the next one they're planning on it they're not saying you know we hope this never happens again the next pandemic we need to have a world order that has authority over nations to control this to make every citizen and every nation accountable to the same rules and you know it's going to pass the u.n and our nation will jump right on that bandwagon giving their authority to someone else now that's happening in the natural oh my goodness the un's going to come and force you to be vaccinated while the devil's eroding everything underneath you in a spiritual realm don't be distracted don't be distracted my brother and sister now we look at this let's look with what our we see with our hearts remember now i was going to put the quote back in but i'll just reference it uh i i read it to you the other day brother chris referenced it now my brother and sister satan chose the head god chose the heart so the eyes are in the head and and we'll touch on that a little later here the eyes are in the head but god deals with the heart and so as it is we'll look at this now what do we see with our hearts we go to john 14 and he says here let your head are you with me he says let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me father's houses many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you amen you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there may there ye may be also and whether i go you know and the way you know now i want to ask you how are you going to know were we given a little handbook mcnally quickest way to heaven scenic route to heaven cheapest route to heaven most memorable route to heaven why is it because your heart has seen the revealed word no true believer saw this message with his eyes you saw it with your heart your eyes was the design god used for you to take the input of the written page your ears was the input of the the sound that come but it was the heart that received the word and as this comes my brother and sister this is now this is where i'm going to get a little rough as it were this is where the separation is coming between the so-called christian and the true believer because the heart is then giving guidance where one would say those things don't matter anymore it's old testament but jesus said i didn't come to do away with that but no that's old testament you don't understand that's an old covenant doesn't apply to us we're under grace well i'm telling you the scripture also teaches us that grace grace to disgrace is not god's plan and so grace is a a poor excuse for poor christian behavior the lord will forgive me while i rob this bank lord will forgive me while i cheat my employer the lord will forgive me why i do this or i do that no my brother and sister poor excuse so whether i go you know so what is he telling them john is telling them that the true believer which is you this morning is going to know the plan of god you know how you're going to get there and you can see by revelation through the word what god is doing to get you there he said i'm not going to take you halfway and lose you along the path those i have begun this work in i'm going to finish this work and so it's there that god says i'm going to reveal to you he didn't reveal it in our mind my brother and sister oh the mind is there to comprehend it but it is the heart and many people will quit because they never allowed their heart to see the word they were content to be able to take a position set in that position and say praise god i'm a message believer well that's good that's a good mental position to start with but to be a believer in jesus christ is the path that the word is leading to not just to say oh i i know this is right compared to all others well the rest will fail and the denominational spirit on this will also fail that's exactly right amen now john 6 and 36 like i said i got a lot of scripture in john here but i said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not you see here is the dividing line of the seeing with the heart and jesus acknowledging you saw me you have eyes you're able to focus you saw me but you don't even believe so they're seeing him meant nothing yeah come on i hope you get that their seeing meant nothing because they couldn't believe and he stood right there in their midst oh look at this my brother and sister-in-law what we see amen now as we'll look at this we'll realize going once again just jumping actually a few verses and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up last day now my brother and sister once again i believe you caught the point you're you're very uh how do i say this you're smart people you understand you have revelation but you look at that and see my brother and sister here we have those that seen him didn't believe that's it and now we have the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son what is it it's looking beyond the veil you can't look at what's on this side of the veil and say well i was in church i was in the house of god i was there i saw you got to look beyond the veil to see christ in his majesty see him in his glory see him in his proper position of who he is and why he come and even why we were created you have to see that and when you see that you see the place that you are in the economy of god i'm not just a sinner saved by grace i am a crown jewel of my lord jesus christ oh that sounds so arrogant no it isn't just recognizing the facts i've seen him can you say amen i've seen him amen i didn't didn't find a religion that fit me i didn't find a religion you know my son and i was driving around in phoenix one time we went by drove by this this um church grounds i said oh what college is this he just laughed he goes oh that's something something cathedral it's a church they had football fields soccer fields basketball courts gymnasiums and he says i worked with a man he said i always would talk to him about the message you know it's funny because my son technically he'd say his backslid still talking about the message paradox huh he's talking to this guy the guy told him he says yeah my wife and i we changed church this week my brother's like really i mean my son's like really he goes yeah yeah we're going over there to the cathedral and my son's like so why i thought you guys were happy with your church he goes well we were but um they have a way better softball league okay everyone that seeth the sun are you catching that poor analogy going to church for what softball league not to see the sun better program they have free daycare my wife will go back to work now is this what church is about the less we would feel built up in ourselves we have very similar things in our world amen amen so as we look at this we're looking how he declares that that the one that seeth the sonnet believeth on him see before you can really truly believe my brother and sister you have to see him now look at this i i didn't include this i thought about this but i'm going to be too long anyway but look the prophet of god says now those that have never risen beyond that level they don't know but when you have risen to another level those that have risen to that level is now they see that they have never seen before but the others when you are talking to them i'm paraphrasing this when you're talking to them they would say i see but you see they can't see because they've never crossed that riven veil they've never been here so what they're seeing is something entirely different and their view is here while the view of the true believer filled with the holy ghost is here and they're talking about i see and they're saying i see and we think we're on the same page but it's impossible to be on the same page between the unbeliever make believer and the true believer do we elevate ourselves and boast on ourselves absolutely not amen there's nothing for us to boast on but my brother sister you need to recognize that by able by god's grace you are able to see what the world here is not seeing i went to a funeral this last friday and this is actually stark humor and i'm sorry to put it this way but my brother and sister there's ministers in churches that are so uninspired one thing i'll say about that minister that preached that funeral he had the whole group going to heaven to see this man again then what difference is there why try reminds me of a kid years ago that i knew smart kid intelligent i should say and i asked him you know i was thinking about quitting school i asked him why don't you why don't you just quit and he goes oh he said have you ever noticed that when you get your diploma it doesn't say what your grades were i'll get the diploma even if i get it with a d-minus when i was pardon the phrase half backslid i used to think lord if i could just make it to heaven if i'd be the doormat in the door of heaven i'll be happy but you know what happened i seen him i've seen him oh yes the doormat in heaven as it were figuratively would have eternal life but i seen him and i said i don't i don't want to be a doormat any longer i want to be right here before the throne because what i have seen is so beautiful and so precious and i want it so much that i no longer will be satisfied to be a doormat i want to be there and i want to sit right there at the throne of almighty god i want to be as it were along with a few other people i want to be right there where i can reach out and touch him imagine i don't know how god will work that out but as long as i'm there i'm not going to be the doormat i'm going to be a son of god shouting i'm standing on the sea of crystal and i'll be shouting hallelujah and glory to god my brother and sister knowing that i was privileged by almighty god to see him in his majesty and his righteousness in his holiness not just a god that saves some people but my god my husband my bridegroom that's who i want to see hallelujah amen so i want to see the sun in how god intended for us to see the sun i want to see him in the full revelation of the word not a watered down version hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah so as john is speaking he i just know john was hoping that the people would catch the essence of what was recorded what jesus was speaking i mean and catch the essence of it john saw that as important enough he writes it but my brother and sister see there's this other kind of seeing which is not the vision of a mortal man you do you realize what you see saints what god has granted you to see is not the vision and understanding of mortal man it is the revelation of eternal life so god has opened the channel to you personally of the essence of eternal life that you could catch whatever he says now you know where i'm going and you know how to get there what because the essence of eternal life has been revealed to you and it's no longer hey what do i do and how do i do this there's something inside of you just read this morning where the prophet of god says there is such a thirst in a real believer that they can only satisfy that by the presence of god oh i tell you it's what brings the drunks my brother and sister that's what brings the drug addicts that's what drink brings a street walker that's what brings them out of that life out of that culture and changes them and the world says we don't know how it happened oh hallelujah oh now let's go on verse 12 uh chapter 12 verse 44. jesus cried see this wasn't some casual conversation jesus didn't say now look guys reason with me let's discuss this you know there's a better way no jesus cried amen he cried out he he gave great expression force he that believeth on me believeth not on me now this is getting dicey oh this is getting dicey now this don't fit my message understanding of the godhead heathen okay i i know you're smart but i'm just gonna break it down because i need to break it down for me because i'm breaking it down for the 40 second time you're just hearing it for the first time today he that believeth on me that's me yeah come on believeth not on me i believe on him but i'm not believing on him i'm stumped now because i believed on you but i'm not believing on you but on him that sent me apply that to today's saints oh yes there's them crazy people following a man yeah well i follow that man i follow his teaching but i'm not really believing on him i'm believing on the one that sent him i'm believing i'm the one that sent him hallelujah he that seeth me seeth him that sent me oh come on let's apply this right down into some good modern 21st century message theology amen look where this come from and people say how can you follow that paul i thought you had more sense than that i had a friend he quit but he was determined to convince me that i wasn't looking at it quite correct while he was unlike church number eight or nine trying to find a place that would preach something he could digest yeah i told him you've heard me talk about this i told them look as soon as i find something better i'm gone just don't expect that to happen yeah because you see this scripture right here john 12 44-45 i saw it i saw it saints god was gracious enough to open my eyes i could see this i saw what he was saying and recognizing that there are men that god has used through the ages they say oh yes i believe the old testament i believe all that but that can't happen in our day god you're just not capable utter nonsense saints amen so we're not believing on the man we're believing on the god that's in the man and the god that's in the man just happens to be the same god that's in you and i and so the same spirit and the spirit speak to each other just like evil spirits right they speak to each other amen the holy spirit that's in the word is speaking to you and i and we can speak back to the word and say that's what i believe now why do i believe that i don't know why i believe that but that's what i believe because you see my mind will not be able to dictate what i believe my heart is what saw the word my heart is what saw the life my heart has saw god not my mind not my eyes not my ears but god oh hallelujah are we okay to keep going for a little bit amen john 14 17 even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive doesn't that make you feel like an oddball got a whole world out here hundreds and hundreds we're up in the billions aren't we on the earth something like that can't see it why you well let me unfold this little theory that while there was still a void in the mind of god he was like paul when he's working in the basement of the church come on you little board get in here where you belong no don't ouch that hurt oh people be what's wrong with this guy now if you'll forgive me for making an analogy like that here's god in the universe i'd like to have someone that would love me so much they'd serve me through thick and thin they'd serve me no matter what happened and he looks off through the galaxies and the eagle nebula and all this the black hole of all these things and he said there's no one but i really want someone to love me now maybe you can grasp this real good maybe you don't if you don't i pray that you pray about it but you see god starts speaking your name where did it come from i don't know the mind of god so much larger than my mind i can't even comprehend it but i could start in the front row and move all the way to the back row and declare and to each one of you god spoke your name and eternity recorded it and he said let it be us and it had to come to pass now we can be all oh my life is so miserable we have family problems we have financial problems we have this problem we have that problem and church is so boring well let me remind you all if you're not getting fed at church that means your baby because babies have to have the bottle brought to them placed in their lips and supported so they can drink the bottle but a real true mature christian goes out and says i want meat and they find meat and they prepare the meat and they eat the meat without someone having to do that so i tell you that sounds a little harsh but if you don't feel fed maybe you might look in the mirror and see why you're not fed up i love you i'm not trying to be harsh amen but you see we're not looking at the vision of mortal man even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it what seeth him not they saw jesus a man walking on the shores of galilee my brother and sister they'll look once again in this day for a man walking on the shores of galilee but they fail to recognize that that was a time and a season of the expression of the prophecy and word of god and it is not the word for this day the word for this day is that oh let me just read it amen because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you amen i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you isn't that a great security of feeling i'm not going to leave you my brother and sister i'm sorry to dwell on this but this is what god laid on my heart i'm telling you we got some believers that are over there in eastern europe and they are there in dire circumstances some of them not having come out of their basements in days and they are not comfortless [Applause] why because they've got amen oh how do i even describe it amen they shall call him the prince of peace amen we go right down the list it burdens our heart there's believers that are testifying this is not our battle this is the lord's battle and he's already prevailed now that doesn't excuse us from prayers and support if we can send money to them and these kind of things but i'm telling you there's much more than the things of this life the carnal needs of this life there's much more to that and that is that comfort and peace of the soul to know that i gave myself to the lord jesus christ he's taking care of me hallelujah we look so much to the flesh we look so much to the carnal things of life oh god help us oh help us amen but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you see me oh look at the beauty of this my brother and sister it's not just about i come to the message this is about that relationship that i have met my lord and savior face to face and i looked upon him and he looked upon me and we are looking oh some i've said it myself god forgive me but we're like oh i just hope i can keep those words well done my good faithful servant if we will follow the word we will hear the words it won't be a question of maybe we follow the word we'll hear the words hallelujah amen because i live you shall live also oh isn't that beautiful amen hallelujah now i love this sermon here christ is revealed in his own word this is just a tremendous sermon because you see what the prophet of god does is he just takes you back to the word back to the word back to the word back to the word and he says now my mind's racing fast enough i'm going to get my stuff messed up here brother branham says if you read your bible and you don't see christ in every page or word verse go read it again you see it comes back to seeing if you don't see him amen now there's an opinion okay am i allowed to mark opinion i'm opinionated as all get out my family's told me so no i just but anyway i read the church age book in a year i read my bible in a year i read the seals book in a year and some who read all three in a year but i have one question for you when you read that what did you see you know when i was younger and i used to think that really meant something i'd read 400 page books in two days and all the high points of the story i could recount them to you but sometimes you'd have to turn around and flip back through the book to find out why fred did what fred did because you don't know why fred did what fred did because you glossed right over it and i read my bible in a year and i got no more out of it than i did when i read it in a year last year now go ahead read your bible in a year i'm not i'm not speaking against that but while you're reading three four five chapters a day why don't you take another 10 minutes and focus on a few verses and actually digest those and pray over it and say lord what does that really mean i need to know what that really means because you see if we don't know why fred did what fred did the only thing we can do is start going backwards trying to find out why did fred do what fred did well if you want to know what the whole deal in that story was fred killed his best friend now why would fred kill his best friend i don't know somewhere i missed it and if you don't know who you are and you don't see christ in every line and every chapter every book if we don't see that saints reading it a year means nothing we got to go back now and start searching where did i fall into this how did i fit into this where was this it's more about revelation than volume we can say well i've listened to every i remember there was a sister years ago my brother and sister and she would have chewed you up like a mad beaver with a chainsaw but she had listened to every message in the message seven times and she'd ripped your own leg off and beat you with it something's missing she didn't get something in there she decided volume i'm not speaking ill of her but subsided volume was more important than revelation i'm here to tell you if you never listen to every message the prophet preached and you haven't read every word or verse in the bible but you have seen christ then you have seen a great thing reminds me of a brother telling me one time he said i was there in the genealogies and i was reading and they begot and they begot and they begot and he woke up that's what the genealogy will do to you and he begot and then you're like wait there's two names here is this the same no it's not reason was you fell asleep your bible closed you thumbed yourself back there and ended up on a different page that's not going to do it for you but meeting the christ of the bible face to face to be able to say i've seen him i've seen him in his word and i'll never be the same it's a brand new book to me oh hallelujah now let's look i've got to hurry along here christ is revealing his own word you can't see with your hands the technical people will tell you well yes i can if the lights are completely out i can walk through the room you guys have memorized your living room bedroom right and you can get out of bed in the middle of the night in the dark and you can walk to your bathroom and hit the door absolutely without air until your wife puts a mirror on the wall that reflects the light of the crack of the door perfectly and you find yourself in the middle of the night and you're like what happened because you're asleep and it's like i i what happened and then you realize that's a mirror wow come on life lessons sometimes you know the prophet said the pastor preaches things that he's going through himself come on you realize your hands work fine in the dark after you've hit something yet it's part of the body you can't see with your ears yet it can hear you can't see with the nose yet it smells you can't see with lips though it speaks see that was the pentecostal age but now it's the eye time now not get caught up here in like what he was just talking about looking with the eyes don't get caught up with this catch the revelation the seeing ah the seeing it's the eye time the seeing not with natural eyes but with a spiritual eye see the revealed word now see now there's a one moving factor to be on the eye is that right the next is intelligence which is christ him itself who controls the whole body no moving i like this little humor in here if you see most of you probably already read ahead of me but no moving no motion beyond that see everything else has moved see move your feet move your muscles and your legs move everything move your ears can move i had a friend once that could just make his ear go amazing gift your ears can move your nose your lips and so forth but after your eyes there's nothing that moves that's why they claim that men get boldheaded [Laughter] oh my i tell you what i've already made it too far but i might have to start an exercise program but look at this i say the profit of god's got a sense of humor that's why they claim the men get bald-headed is because you see there's no exercise to develop the muscle in the hair the scalp you see and it's not got a cushion so that they can get blood in there the blood won't pump through see it won't go up in furnished blood of course the hair root lives by blood and now we find out that that part you see there is nothing beyond the eye now let's find out it shall be light about the middle of the day no at the evening time what is the light sent for so you can see hallelujah that's why this revealed word of the hour is talking about a light shining in the darkness in the evening time is called we can see thank you lord we're not going to wander around in the dark well god's in a trinity but not that kind of trinity a different trinity how many trinities can there be see where you're at shall be light about the evening time now you take that now and compare it over malachi 4. he promised that there would be a light come again in the evening time see for behold i will send you elijah the prophet and he will restore the children back to the fathers and the fathers to the children is that right lest i commit the earth with a curse now let's take john or saying luke 17 30 and watch what jesus prophesied they're saying as it was in the days of sodom it'll be the same now i want you to listen real careful here because if you don't you'll get stumbled on this now notice this is at the time when the son of man would be revealed right sodom time amen and as it was in the days of sodom the revealing of the son of man now the son of man was actually revealed potentially i think the prophet god could have said absolutely i don't think he had to put the word potentially there but the lord probably spoke to him he put that potentially just for a few moments there just before sodom was burned now that man was elohim that was god and jesus is god and god was revealed potentially right there for a few moments to talk to abraham in the investigation judgment just for a little bit the son of man was revealed the son of man the son of man elohim do you see it church the son of man elohim was revealed just for a few minutes for the very next morning she was burned when before the sun could come up again now look at this my brother and sister if that was a type of our day then the son of man potentially i hope you get this was revealed to you oh the technicals of the messages say now if he is stepped from the throne then the mercy seat is finished it's empty but the prophet of god said the mercy seat is in the heart of the believer so for you and i the mercy seat will never be empty did you make the connection there the son of man potentially you know why use the word potential because not everyone would see it if he said there he is right here then the whole world could looked upon it with revelation but it wasn't its potential because it's reserved to those it was reserved for and that's how you saw christ that's how you saw your bridegroom that's how you saw the lord jesus is because it was opened and the potentials of the word revealed it to you and you looked at that and said i believe and the word i've read the scriptures i won't go back and read them again you saw that and it become real to you and the world will say no no no you are in a cult you're in this you're in that you're following this you're following that and you'll say nope i'm sorry you think it's in a building in a book somewhere it's right here this is where it's at because i saw him all the potentials of the word was open to me and i had a clear vision and i saw it and i claim it oh hallelujah saints i hope it's real to you if it isn't it's just simply because i could not express it to you in the right fashion oh my amen i want to just throw this out i won't i won't elaborate on it but you see when elohim come down met with abraham this is before the judgment of sodom there was god himself in flesh and abraham recognized that amen he didn't say can i see some credentials can you like perform something proof to me you're who you are why because it was a word in him responded because he had already had a face-to-face encounter with the revelation of the word some people are so looking for the man so looking for the man you know i look i i don't like touching on these things but i believe sometimes we have to so people so many people are looking for as it were brother brown to come back my brother and sister what we need to make a rapture has already been drawn out of this word and given to us through a message that didn't come from brother branham it come from god himself and god said i choose this man as my vessel to carry the word and just as we read this scripture earlier my brother and sister it's not as it is the man we give reverence and we give honor i can't wait to meet him one day to shake his hand to thank him for his surrender to the word but my brother and sister we saw the verses right here it wasn't him it was god in him and brought the word out and so the very god that was in him is in you and i amen and we would no more glorify ourself hmm now look what abraham saw he's there a promise he got to see god in his grace and mercy because otherwise sarah had been struck dead on the spot and he got to see prophecy of the word and he saw the word you catch that he saw the word now look at the difference rich young ruler thought he saw the word he stood in the presence of the word and declared i have fulfilled all of this from my childhood and he stood in the face of the word and said the works that i have done by being obedient to the word of god has secured my position so he stood in the presence of the word and said i don't need any more oh please don't let that spirit that spirits around the age people around the message are saying i got enough of this message i don't even really need to dig into it anymore that's a lie of the devil my brother and sister that's a spirit that came right from that anointing that was on the rich young ruler that thought he had done it all well i'm telling you obedience to the word my brother and sister will not put you in the rapture amen oh scripture says obedience is better than sacrifice but you won't find the word saying obedience will put you in the rapture we have to have that personal seeing of jesus christ in our life in our relationship otherwise well we can be obedient rich young ruler was and so if obedience in the 21st century would get us in a rapture god's got to go raise the rich young ruler back up and restore him you see he done that by works of obedience not by revelation abraham moved forward by revelation and in the revelation he still made mistakes get that in obedience when we go to apply and be accounted worthy by obedience we don't want mistakes because mistakes then negate our obedience but when you go forward in revelation and you make mistakes you repent and god does not erase the revelation have you noticed that we get revelation and the devil comes acting like that roaring lion and we think oh lord i failed you god doesn't come back and say now you lose that position i'm sure glad it's by revelation because that obedience thing is just really hard especially you know to those who that repent every day those that don't make mistakes don't have to repent every day probably obedience is not that difficult for you i'm sorry i shouldn't be humorous about that but you see the rich young ruler never really saw the word he obeyed the word he never really saw the word because if he had saw the word he would have saw the word made flesh in front of him so people say i have a revelation of the message but they don't see christ right in front of them and they don't see a transforming power in their life i'm sorry my brother and sister it's hard it's hard to accept that now let's just go through here we're going to close well i've already took so much time my exposition of seven church ages philadelphia church age brother brown here says revelations 3 13 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches every age ends with this same warning it is a constant plea that the churches listen to the voice of the lord in this age the plea is even more insistent than in former ages for in this age the coming of the lord truly draws nigh the question would perhaps arise is there another age beyond this one if there is another age beyond this one why the urgency the answer lies herein the last stage will be a short one a quick work of consummation i i want you to go back if you want to and study this out my brother and sister consummation is not a casual relationship consummation is intimacy amen amen so it's going to be a quick work of an intimate nature this little bride's not going to say we're chris christians we're message believers no sir she's actually going to kind of come across as a fanatic you know that whole thing you first get married and you want to be really close to her she wants to be really close to you it's that time you know this the love of my life she would say i gave myself to him and i took his name and he would be there saying she gave herself to me and took my name same thing different words and they just like to do everything together they it's just so close it's there and this short quick work my brother and sister oh i don't mean to grind any axes please forgive me but i don't really want to hear about how many years people have been in the message it means nothing it means nothing if they have lost the intimacy if they have come to the place that the real boast that they have in their life is that they've been in the message for 50 years no sorry i'm not impressed what impresses me is a burning desire of the intimacy of the word that i can't just do look i i've been really busy this winter i don't know why things have been that way some of you will definitely relate and my own wife here a few days ago i said somehow i will do this for you and she goes i don't want you to do that for me i want you to be here and talk to me and be around me and you know it strikes you deep in the heart you see we can give good gifts to god we can labor and we can do all these things and say i did this for you lord i did this for you lord but you see that's not what he's looking for he's looking for the fire of intimacy the fire of when we come as it were into his presence that he sees our heart and we can see his heart and we are so excited but you see satan comes and just as it is in many marriages one of the most common most common things it's brought into divorce court is often under the subtitle in reconciliable differences but when they dig deeper the actual written out thing will be we've grown apart and have nothing in common come on church the devil wants to divorce you from the word he wants you to get to where i'm a message believer everything's going to be all right i'll tell you what i refer to it all the time and i'll take you back briefly here i can assure you they were all concerned about esther when she said i'm going to go i'm going to talk to the king asked her you can't do that because if he rejects you and he doesn't lift up the scepter then you will never see him again and you will just live as it were in exile but she had a secret that they didn't know she had saw his heart and she knew she wasn't just a queen to a king but she was the queen to the king and there she had a confidence to stand on the word of god in her hour and say i have need and i'm coming boldly to the throne hallelujah oh hallelujah where was i last stage will be a short one a quick work of consummation and not only is this so but one must always remember that in the eyes of god time is so very fleeting yea a thousand years or about a day and if he is coming within a few hours as he views time then he surely must warn us with all urgency and his voice must continually sound in our minds no no because that's where we see the revelation of jesus christ our bridegroom is in the heart must continually sound in our hearts to be ready against that coming amen oh thank you lord now look i'm glad actually praise the lord this broke off right where it did i had no idea but this is perfect but the musicians come please oh there are so many voices in the world so many problems and needs crying for attention but there will never be a voice so important and so worth attending as a voice of the spirit so he the hath and ear to hear let him hear with the spirit saith unto the churches i want to read that again so many voices so many problems and needs crying for attention is that not the truth but they'll never be a voice so important and so worth attending as the voice of the spirit you know how hard it is saints our hearts are breaking we have through the years we've seen this south africa apartheid things happening believers drug out of their cars and beaten in the streets oh my we got to do something about this pinochet south america people just disappear your son might walk out the door and go to the grocery store and never be heard from ever again only to find out he became one of the tens and hundreds of thousands that they shot and threw in a pit somewhere what's happening now eastern europe come on there's two sides to every coin saints we need to give attention and prayer to the needs of the saints in all these different places but not at the expense of losing the ability to hear the voice of the spirit in grace tabernacle in nampa idaho we can give all kinds of money and time and efforts and do all of this but if the spirit leaves here and we can't hear it we're the losers it is they may have i know that many won't be happy to hear me say this in this way they may have to give their life but that don't mean we come to a place that we waste ours yes let's hear the voice let's attend to the voice of the spirit saints let's see who jesus christ really is let us see the beauty of the gospel of jesus christ in our lives hallelujah you love the lord today oh my oh my hallelujah hallelujah my redeemer is faithful and true let's just stand and worship the lord for just a few minutes amen hallelujah i thank god saints he's given us eyes to
