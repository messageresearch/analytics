there's words on the page but lord may your spirit come and speak this morning i don't care about the words i don't care about the how well the words are put together god i want you to speak this morning lord jesus we are of need of you this morning we always have need of you father i ask lord jesus you would just take now this precious atmosphere that we are in this morning and use it for

that you would have your way we love you so much [Music] of our hearts lord jesus we love you we're so grateful lord that we have you father with us in us lord working through us giving you saying into your hands now this morning for you to speak to us we ask in jesus name amen let's stand to our feet so we're gonna read from mark chapter four i believe it's been said already but we want to just say it again that our thoughts and our prayers are with the hayley family paul and jerry each one this morning amen mark chapter 4 verse 35. and the same day when the even was come he saith unto them let us pass over unto the other side when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships and there was a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto him master carest thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said under the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm joel 2 25 says and i will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word can be seated this morning so my title this morning i'm just going to back up a couple of slides so you can see it is uh after the storm and the subtitle is our restore saith the lord so i have one more scripture here okay we'll get to it so so storms inspire faith in us job 19 verse 23-25 says oh that my words were now written oh that they were printed in a book that they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock forever for i know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and um i i this is a sermon that i kind of pulled from the archives and the original inspiration was if you look at the weather around you or you look at the clouds now you can't have clouds without there being some kind of storm coming whether that's just a light rain or in any or any anything similar to that and and there's so much more definition in the sky the sun sets prettier when you have clouds for the sun to bounce off of there's a sweet smell of rain in the air after a storm and um the clouds give this guy definition and it's it's just beautiful and as the per individual that's one of my favorite times and it's actually a great time to catch fish too um but it's just a fresh air and and uh with without that storm there wouldn't have been that fresh smell of rain there wouldn't be the the the flowers blooming on the cactus in the deserts there wouldn't have been life coming forth from the earth or that sweet atmosphere or that beauty in the sky and so begin to think about this thing and and um you know in the storm the lord speaks in the storm the lord protects us and in the storm psalm 17 8 says keep me as the apple of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy wings so in the storm we're hidden under the wings of jehovah and we sing that song and perfectly lines up with this is that the jehovah shama you know jehovah rapha all the the seven redemptive names of jehovah are exactly what we need when we're going through a storm and it's it's more than enough it's more than we need and that's kind of hard to to grasp sometimes in the storm because it's very loud it's very wet it's dangerous in some situations but i don't want to focus on the storm because many times the lord he gives us he gives us things he gives us gifts in certain seasons and and um those those seasons that we go through we all we always go through something um we always go through something because the lord's trying to give us something we had it on the side i know if it's still there but character is a victory not a gift and so uh someone can can stand up here and and say you know say those words but when you're living them it's a totally different story um we can talk about you know oh you know that storm i was in out on the mountainside hunting and it was crazy it was life-threatening and everything but you're standing there okay telling somebody and that person's going oh wow you know they're not really affected because they weren't in the storm um but there's one thing we know about christ and that and that his mission here when he came down and walked the shores of galilee his mission was to bring us full redemption while he did that his mission as well was to experience everything we experience when we go through something and we and and we read this scripture in in mark and and and every scripture there's many different angles and things you can bring from it because it's god's eternal word it means one thing in one season to you and it means something totally different in another season to you and so when you when we read this story many times we continue through verse 40 and 41 and we talk about the lack of faith in the disciples but i want to focus on the ending of the story in verse 39 where god even then the lack of their faith god stands and calms the storm he doesn't get up in the middle of the storm and start to rebuke them the first thing he does when they call out for help in the storm is he stands and speaks to the storm and there's a great lesson we can take from that for for our own situations dealing with people in our own lives um always be quick to be in the will of god and the will of god in that time was for jesus to stand up in the boat and speak to the storm that peace would come and then it was after that that christ gave instructions to the disciples but when the storm was happening all around the disciples and they were afraid the lord rises up and he speaks peace to the storm now in order to focus on our topic which is after the storm we have to address the storm so we're getting there praise the lord so the disciples probably are asking themselves um why why the storm but jesus is in the boat wireless storm guess what jesus is always in the boat as long as you're in the will of god jesus is always in the boat so why the storm you would think that that would be a protection against everything about you nothing would happen so why the storm and um but the we'll get to a quote here in a little bit the the the reason for storms there's many reasons the bottom line is that god is building our character god is is working within us and and so the right the the reason of a storm in this scenario here was the writing of a testimony the writing of the testimony that the disciples could then go forth and preach hey it doesn't matter when you're in the storm god's in the boat he'll speak to that storm and bring peace you just have to have faith so a lesson was taught and the testimony was written for them and for us today and down through time when the scripture has been preached on and so um brother barum says in in the the sermon at thy word 1948 he says then when he come out there to the side of the mount isn't that something i believe the apostle said that our trials are better than gold to us think of it god might have let you get sick in order that you might be a testimony what is the purpose of your creation for god to be glorified he needed the attributes of a savior so he needed he needed to to he needed you to fulfill those attributes he needed the attribute he wanted to fulfill the attributes of the healers or he created you he needed to be god so he created you to worship him so you and christ i mean you are the perfection if you will bold statement you are the perfection of christ because he needs you amen but we need him and it's the paradox of the relationship of god but in our trials are better than gold to us think of it god might have let you get sick in order that you might be a testimony that he might heal you that you can stand on his word i said it once before we need to stop asking why and ask how god can't glorify you in this situation now why is this happening to me but how can i glorify you in this situation how can i worship you because that's the end goal amen and i i cut a little bit out i didn't cherry pick i just cut a section of the story out there's a long quote he goes on to say a little bit later now isn't that a thought to think of now sister you're sitting there with the blinded eyes with the glasses on probably bad eyes or you wouldn't even have the glasses now isn't that something to know that god let that sight get in that condition that he might give a testimony isn't it wonderful that we would know that he come up why is he blind and they said whose sin he or his father now he's talking about the story of the blind man that he healed he put mud on his eyes and he said go wash in the pool and he goes and washes in the pool and then the the religious leaders pull him aside and they interrogating him never once glorifying god for his healing but interrogating him and then they asked jesus the question you know um the people there well who who who and i may have the wrong blind man story you forgive me if i do but a blind man's eyes are open and they're asking why was he blind because of the old testament you know was was it a curse on him from his family and he says no it's it's none of that it's simply that god may be glorified and he said this case neither but that the works of god might be done god wanted some witnesses now he sent his gift of healing to heal you that you would go out and be a witness then stand the test of faith praise the lord to testify of his grace amen to come forth like gold tried in the fire there's little comfort in growth and little excuse me there's little growth in comfort and little comfort and growth the storm is not comfortable um the storm is not picture perfect the storm isn't exactly textbook um the storms can change directions you see if you you read any kind of history of storms or train tornadoes you know it's going to go this way and it just turns and goes the other direction storms are unpredictable you know they say there's 70 70 chance of rain in an hour and an hour it's blue skies or they say there's a light chance of rain with with clear skies and it's uh the biggest thunderstorm you ever seen so they're unpredictable see uh people can can stand and try to try to to to tell you and try to confine god to a box and um try to to to to say oh it's this situation and when this happens it's this situation but then something happens in their life that's if you will outside of the box because it's not about a prescription it's not about a textbook it's about the revelation of christ and with that revelation comes the strength for those things outside of the box for those things that are different for those things that we don't fully understand ourselves but god is the author and finisher of our faith and he's the author of every circumstance that we experience as christians amen and the one thing that we can always know about the storms we go through that we will come forth like gold tried in the fire praise the lord but now like i said my title this morning was after the storm um i hope you can see that well it's just a beautiful picture and on this side of the clouds there is no storm we're enjoying the beauty of the storm so there is beauty in the storm there's beauty after the storm there isn't much to to uh let's be real this morning it's hard to be thankful in the storm it's hard to to always know exactly what god's doing or what's happening but yeah but once we come to the other side after the storm you see for a believer there is always hope before a christian there is always hope amen and it's not the storm this and the storm and the storm and the storm and the storm we can preach about the storm and the storm of the storm but guess what what is after that and then what is the victory i mean because you keep your eyes on victory there was a young boy who will rode his bike across the plank we all know the i'm very familiar with the story why did he win against everybody else his eyes were on the victory amen and as believers our eyes sometimes get off the victory now the scripture says i pressed towards the mark of the high calling in christ jesus amen our eyes are on the end of the goal our eyes are forward to our deliverance and uh praise the lord so following the storm um in the story that we read of the disciples the disciples were out on the sea and uh they went through a storm but if you continue reading on there's a story in the next chapter and there was a man plagued with demons mark 5 15 and they come to jesus and see him that was possessed with the devil and had the legion sitting and clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid my orders messed up but after the storm came deliverance god brought those disciples through that storm but they were on their way to an appointment with destiny they were on their way to an appointment that had been in the book since before the foundation of the world before there was ever a son before there was ever stars in the sky before there ever was the green fields of pasture upon the earth before there was anything that testified to life there was an appointment said in the books an appointment with the man of galeria amen a man that had that had that had become a maniac become bound by demons bound by spirits amen brought down and i wish i could remember what brother branham says as the cause of that um but the situations in his life that brought him to a point where now he was bound and needed deliverance but on the way there to the deliverance amen god brought his disciples to the storm now did that boost their faith for that appointment absolutely it boosted their faith you know perhaps god was when he was laying out the books of time and and everything that would happen he said you know i mean i need my disciples to have that boost of faith to be with me when this happens and so i'm going to take them through this storm you see god always knows exactly what's going on around us and he was already there he already wrote it down he already addressed the situation and then he gave us everything that we could possibly need he gave us more than that amen just in case if you will just to cover the margin amen but god is is always present and so after the storm god brought deliverance amen and if there isn't a more classic or more or more um a better example of a storm it's it's the life of job but we that's a it's a long book and i can't read the whole book this morning but but job experienced great tragedy in his life job lost everything that that was dear to him he lost everything that was his business and all these things and it was just an absolute storm um one of those storms where it's the middle of the day but it's almost pitch black and um the thing about the thing about the lord is is is uh he's not gonna rate this storm is worse than this storm we do that we do that god just calls them storms and god says this measure of faith i've given to him and this measure of faith i've given to them every storm is just god working in us amen working on us but if you get to the end of the story of job job 42 10 and the lord turned the captivity of job when he prayed for his friends also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before so is the point of storms for us to just get more stuff absolutely not if you think that you're going to go through a storm that takes all your stuff and then i don't know god will just deal with that you see sometimes we as because we're human we can we can hear somebody talk and we can think we can be convinced but god knows the very thoughts and intents of the heart amen see that's why he doesn't look at this he looks at the heart thank goodness because we say some pretty dumb things but when a person's intent is for that lamborghini or whatever it is god sees that in their heart and if they're a child of god he will address that so you can't fool god you can fool me you can be fooled but you can't fool god god knows exactly what's going on the restoration of the bride tree brother branham says but it's in that in the um the top part where i will restore saith the lord i will i'll send forth the evening light it'll bring back bring back the word make it manifest i will restore all that i promise all that i promise the same holy spirit will bring bear the same signs i'll have an easter a resurrection for the bride just same as i had for the bridegroom see evening lights come out to shine same as in the morning same signs same things the same light will produce the same fruit that they had there if it's shining on the same tree amen proves his word now fulfilled i will restore saith the lord amen what christ does for the bride as a whole he has to do for each individual each individual makes up the bride of christ and so if god has a mission if god has a calling to bring the bride to a position amen for the catching away for the rapture god has to work with each individual because the bride is a multi-member body you can't you can't he can't do it on the whole without doing it to the part and so i just think it's beautiful you take you take the the the progression of the church ages and you look at the beginning we had the word we had the life but then that life went down amen it fell down the sea went down into the ground for the dark ages even but god began to bring that forth and we see that the the scripture that we read the beginning in joel and and and and the testifying of the returning of the restoration not replacing the restoration of the word and so therefore we can look at the bride and we can begin to talk about you know how god's going has god how how god has brought the open word god has brought the full manifestation of redemption to the bride to bring her to that position for departure amen god has had has taken but at the same time now god has taken each one of us and we're going through a progression of our own ages you could apply that to the the number of years but that's not how god works because what about those he calls home at 25. or 15 right but we all have a progression just like just like the bride progressing through those church ages i mean just like the word progressing god's word is progressing in all in inside of each one of us and working on us amen and so we go through dark ages sometimes and then we're storms we go through those storms but god is is bringing us down because when when when things are are pushed aside and and when there's a distress image it brings us into this this condition of our heart where we're just soft and and we don't have to necessarily be totally distressed but but we're we're in this place where we're where the the clay has as if you will maybe been smashed down a little bit and and and we're soft we're soft because our our emotions and our and what we're going through immensely as god can can deal with us when we're tired and and and and god just knows how to bring us into these these seasons because well what makes the cactus bloom what makes the cactus soft the storm it's a storm all that rain all that rain coming down what what what what burns off the um you know when the forest gets too full of brush you know we live close to the forest so we have to control forest fires but um the when the forest gets too thick with the brush the fires come through it and clean it out then new life comes from that so it's just it's it's in it's in nature it's in the bible it's in history where god has has this this cycle of of the storms and the whole purpose is not the storm the whole purpose is not the the tribulation that's why you know uh sometimes um people have misunderstandings of of uh that we go we we build character going through the things we suffer and they stayed down in that suffering they wallowed down there i'm not trying to say anybody to anything to anybody directly this morning they wallow down in the in the mire and in the mud and i've talked to them and you can feel the it just oozing off of them and that's not where that quote and those scriptures end it's not suff we're not called to suffer you're not necessarily called to just be dirt poor your entire life are you dirt poor because god's called you to if you are guess what you'll be so positive about the five dollars you have in your account you'll not be talking about how poor you are if you're down in a trial and you're suffering you're not going to be talking about constantly how oh you know and that's all you ever talk about and people will help us to be patient with our brothers and sisters but that's not what we're called you're not called to stay there if we were we wouldn't be singing about how god brought us from the mirey clay we wouldn't we would be singing about jesus still in the grave you understand redemption story down through the ages applies to your life redemption restoration after the storm i will restore saith the lord i will restore it's a restoration what is restoration because we have replacement which means we we just pushed that away we got a brand new thing but the bible says restoration what is restoration rising from the ashes the underdog the story of david and goliath the story of israel restoration the story of david and bathsheba restoration the story of of gideon and and and the restoration of the children of israel the story of us and our restoration through redemption you see the entire you can go in the message and search this and you will find it time and time again the entire purpose of christ is the is the purpose of redemption and if that is true for our if you will doctrine what we believe then that same thing it's not just oh lord help me to say this it's not just like um this is the word okay and then this is us and somehow there's a separation oh we the deep things and oh that preacher doesn't preach deep enough um i'm sorry but that those deep things have to connect to us if it doesn't loop back to your personal story there's a connection that wasn't made there's a wire that's not hooked up because there's no power if you don't have power in your life there's a wire that's disconnected you say well how did that wire disconnected i don't know if you don't know ask god to show you where there's a disconnection in your because guess what there's power every house out there on the street that's hooked to the city of napa has power and if there's a plug in your house that's not working it ain't because the city of napa failed is because there's a connection missing in your in in the in the wires to give that plug power so if you're down and suffering and you're wallowing in the mud and that's all you do there's power missing there's a disconnect those disconnects can come from hurt that we experience as human beings that disconnect can come from from from depression or anxiety there can be a disconnect but god is the great connector amen when there's a problem in your house and you can't figure out what's going on you call the electrician and he comes up and guess what he has all the tools he has all the tools it takes him about five minutes you spend two hours takes him about five minutes he just plugs it in goes the other end plugs it in okay then he works his way back all right you gotta disconnect here cuts the hole in the wall right there fix his head but god has called us to victory amen god has called us to find victory after the storm after the storm he brings us through look i love that i i feel bad because i keep bringing up getting it but i just love the story of guinea and i think in my season of life it kind of applies but and that's that's why but um the story of gideon israel was in trouble of their own doing they did it to themselves they started to worship idols and worship other gods in other words they stopped applying their time to their relationship with god because anything that takes you from your relationship with god has become an idol that's word that's in the message so they had turned from gideon himself had turned from the worship of god to the worship of his father's religion of a man-made religion but still god brought restoration god brought the man on the scene god brought what needed to be done to bring restoration even though israel put themselves in that position so in that suffering back to that amen god will send you what you need to bring you into victory to bring restoration because that's why is it restoration because that's not what that's not who you are that's not what you're called to be you say but that's who i am no it's not no it's not that's what the devil says about you if if i told you this this pulpit's green you'd laugh and say that man needs to be checked out i can't convince you this that this pulpit is green i'm lying to you the devil does the same thing he says your life is is is is hopeless but that's not what god sees god sees the pope that it is god sees your life for the color that it is your true colors amen your true colors are the colors of christ amen god is calling and and and that's not blasphemy because guess what brother branham says confess your healing work towards or imagine if you will that body that's perfectly healed and step into it that was some that was some bold stuff for the day he was in i mean it's still bold today people people want to get caught up in in in different things um well what i'm trying to say is that's faith the evidence of things not seen faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen and then god on wednesday night we talked about the logos god in creation made what is now of what was not amen god is doing the same thing in our lives he is making what was what is now what is going to be what is the fulfillment of his word of things that are not amen you can't find christ you know in your flesh if you will but god is come and he's he's bringing you back excuse me he's bringing you back to your full restoration you're a new creature in christ jesus i hope that made sense i got a little bit jumbled up there but forgive me anyways god is bringing restoration so his restoration of the word brought resurrection to the people of god and down to the ages who were lacking victory so restoration the restoration that god is bringing brings us into our victory brings us through the storm the victory the disciples had in the ship on the sea of galilee over that storm amen for one was already there everything you need to overcome is already within you everything that you need to get to the place where you can talk about the storm that was is already packed inside of you is already down deep within you god is just it's just the logos is just brooding over you to unpack and unfold those potentials that you have you see when you keep your eyes on the goal your eyes of the oh keep your eyes on you as an overcomer get the eyes on you as victorious you're testifying in faith to what god has already put within you and god will recognize that faith and bring forth life on your behalf bring forth that victory amen it is not how does that scripture say it is not the word doesn't blasphemy but to say we are equal or abraham thought it not robbery to be equal with god in other words he had his eyes on the goal he had a revelation of the redemption story of jesus christ amen and that redemption story applies to each and every one of us in our life as a whole and in our life as seasons amen the palmer worm the caterpillar and the locust fed for age after age and then restoration was brought forth by the power of christ amen praise the lord you will have storms amen your boat will be rocked but it's after the storms that we have a revelation of grace a revelation of god's grace to you amen gives you the ability to apply grace to others also keeps you humble because you realize this would be nothing without the grace of god when you see that that that person displaying the demonic spirits that they're inhabited by when you see that person walking on the side of the street you don't go oh you go god give them grace god help them amen if it was not for the grace of god i would be there that's the revelation of grace sometimes storms we go through are just to remind us or give us a revelation of his grace and then a true restoration of an individual into the kingdom of christ brings with it a revelation of grace amen john newton wrote that song amazing grace why because of the storms that he went through and guess what that song came to him in the middle of a storm in the middle of a storm what was humming the tune there was a tune that that the slaves in the hold were humming he didn't know the words to they were they were they were there was this tomb and that's what he put the words to the very product of his sin the very product of his denial of christ brought the music of grace sometimes the very the very product of the children of israel in the time of gideon brought the music of god's grace brought forth the sound of god's deliverance but the bible says you want something that you need deliverance from god will deliver you from that and turn that into a testimony to help someone else saints of god there i am thoroughly convinced there is nothing as a child of god you can do amen that will break god's will for your life amen that's right he will bring you is there times or are we where we step out yes because we're human yes because we still have a choice but god's predestination for you is for you to walk in that position even as a child of god but john newton in his time of struggle amen came forth the song of grace came forth the sound of grace amen amen and that sound amen went and ultimately john newton gave his heart to god after some struggle isn't that true for some of us a school of hard knocks but there there again there again storms that god wants to bring us through because he wants us to be able to say to someone else but i've been there that's it i've been there not not in a bragging way we've never done that you know not like that but when when you've experienced something that someone you know is going through you can have heart what did brother better have to do when he lost the feeling for the people he had to go back and like say god give me the heart because yet you can't be affected without the heart for your brothers and sisters and that heart comes from a revelation of grace after the storm god brings peace amen after the storm god brings peace peace be still that same peace that caused the winds to cease and the storm to calm that same peace goes from a pla from being applied to the storm to being applied to you and god brings you peace god can bring you peace in the midst of the storm god giving you peace in the midst of the storm in the midst of what you're going through we praise the lord amen god god will prepare you for the storm that's right god will prepare you for the storm i remember an individual i won't use names an individual was speaking and and before they preached they were there was a song we were singing and they said let's sing it again and we sing it again then we sing it again and we sing it again almost like too many times but not you know what i'm saying like more than normal and it was that song peace of god cover me in the middle of their sermon their relative took their own life they went home to that but god in that moment right in that moment was washing over them with that song peace of god cover me preparations for the storm they were about to go through and they stand today testifying that they weathered that storm but you see god always prepares us the first time i i spoke this and and i'm not gonna i'm not gonna give excuses this is what god lead in my heart the first time that i spoke this there was a brother and a sister in in the in the church and she was sitting there thanking god for bringing her through all the storms that they had gone through and she felt like she was finally in the calm after the storm two days later her husband died of a major heart attack god preparing her for the storm even in the time where she was thanking god for bringing her through the storms and she felt like things were finally at peace two days later the world was turned upside down but god was preparing her for the storm what what is what what is the whole what's what why why after the storm brother chris you just keep talking about storms because that's what we have to look at amen that's what we have i'm not saying any of this in arrogance i've weathered some very difficult storms so i know what it's like to be in the i don't know every storm maybe i never will but in those storms it's let's be real it's not always like this we can just say oh i have faith no there are days where it just feels like i don't even know what i'm gonna do i don't know what i'm gonna do next i don't know i don't know but you still gotta go live your life you just want to sit down and and tune out but you can't you can't sometimes you have the opportunity to and you you should take those times to to let off the pressure but even in the midst of the pressure of the world you can let off the pressure in christ amen and god will give you the strength to look with eyes what is the anointing for the age that we live in it's the eagle anointing to see clearly to see they can fly above the storms they can see the other side of the storm god has given us the grace and the revelation to see through the storm the world around us the storm the storm that's never ending till god comes the storms in our life we can see by his anointing past that why why is it that you know that that song where paul and his family brother paula fontaine and his family wrote about are you she the bride of this last day right those those patriarchs of faith are going to be standing saying how did you do it how did you do the hardest age the hardest age how did you do it you know how you did it god anointed you to do it you know how you're going to weather the storm you're in today god's going to anoint you to do it you know how you're going to weather the storm that's coming up in front of you god's going to anoint you to do it amen and god has called us to look past amen look past onto the other side amen because the word of god will always stand true amen and remember storms always bring great deliverance amen amen so my prayer today and i'm i'm closing musicians want to come my prayer today for myself and for you as believers is that god will give us the grace to be able to say thank you for the storm thank you for the storm there's a song at brother uh john singh so thanks for the storm lord amen but i did i didn't get the music to that song i'm just gonna i'm gonna try to sing it acapella because i just feel led to you i'll blood trick but when the sun finally broke through the clouds i hadn't felt him for so long and i wondered why the storm what have i done wrong but he could see much further down the road i could have
