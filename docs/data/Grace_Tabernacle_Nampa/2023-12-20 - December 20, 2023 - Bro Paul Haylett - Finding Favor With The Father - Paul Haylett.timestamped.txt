[26:22] where two sisters had come to his
[26:25] meeting from a couple hundred miles away
[26:27] one had stomach ulcers and the other had
[26:29] a gler on her
[26:31] neck or a tumor on her neck sorry and
[26:35] um he just had the word of the Lord for
[26:38] him said thus they sayith the Lord

[26:40] healed and
[26:43] um didn't happen right
[26:46] away it uh they got the car and they
[26:48] drove home you know 3 4 hours or 2 three
[26:52] hours home and uh the next
[26:56] morning still didn't
[26:58] happen but they kept
[27:01] believing and
[27:03] um even the one lady with the ulcers her
[27:06] husband came to her and said you

[27:30] told me my
[27:32] name he told me what was wrong with me
[27:35] and then he said thus sayith the Lord
[27:36] you're healed and I believe it and she
[27:39] said if it if 50 years goes by I'll keep
[27:42] saying it but I believe I'm
[27:45] Healed well within the next day she said
[27:48] said she was washing the dishes and a
[27:51] cool feeling came over
[27:53] her and um she didn't think nothing of
[27:56] it

[38:01] just want to speak to you uh uh this
[38:04] morning this evening uh maybe of the
[38:07] overall topic what is your vision uh but
[38:10] uh I want to uh title our thought
[38:13] tonight uh finding favor with the father
[38:17] and um just uh want to thank our
[38:19] musicians amen uh we uh went the other
[38:23] night and visited sister Joanne I'm not
[38:26] sure how the family is on the visiting
[38:29] schedule but we were given kind of an
[38:32] open uh open door to to go visit and
[38:35] definitely remember our sister she's in
[38:37] a lot of pain every time she would kind
[38:40] of try to adjust herself in the bed you
[38:42] could see her uh wise uh from the pain
[38:46] and um so you know our sister Joanne
[38:50] she's there I must admit a little feeble
[38:55] lifting a hand up and saying and praise
[38:57] God I'm healed amen never giving up amen
[39:02] the devil would say you you've had your
[39:04] years or your this or your that but
[39:06] remember the word now my brother and
[39:09] sister this is spoken to the prophet but
[39:11] the prophet really was just bringing
[39:13] what the word was spoken to us amen
[39:16] don't fear amen never fear amen our King
[39:22] our Lord our savior is present with us
[39:24] amen let's turn in our Bible this
[39:27] evening and I meant I even mentioned
[39:29] this to Sister Jerry then got caught up
[39:31] in other things um if some of you know
[39:34] how to pronounce these names uh you know
[39:37] just feel free to do it or you can just
[39:40] sit back and listen to me slaughter them
[39:43] uh because I've never really been that
[39:45] good at pronouncing many of these names
[39:47] in scripture but Joshua the 15th chapter
[39:51] just have a little thought tonight uh
[39:53] you know uh sister Jerry always tells me
[39:56] don't say it's going to be short don't
[39:57] say it don't say it keep it to yourself
[40:00] because every time I think I'm going to
[40:02] have a short service I somehow find some
[40:05] inspiration or go off on a tangent
[40:07] whichever you would call that but uh
[40:10] tonight Joshua 15: 13 through 19 and um
[40:15] you know we're going to just draw this
[40:17] little thought out of the scripture
[40:20] tonight just to uh recognize that there
[40:23] comes a time that we as believers amen
[40:27] Sons and Daughters of God we're going to
[40:29] identify today uh with uh Caleb's
[40:32] daughter uh so we're all going to step
[40:35] into that position and recognize where
[40:38] she was coming from and I think she
[40:41] would be very symbolic as it would be as
[40:44] a daughter of God the bride of Christ
[40:47] and recognizing something's been
[40:49] promised to her and
[40:52] yesterday she didn't necessarily go to
[40:54] seek that maybe a few
[40:57] months period of time previous never
[41:01] felt an anointing to claim it but we're
[41:04] going to look in the scripture here and
[41:07] unto Caleb the son of Jeep thuna he gave
[41:10] a part among the children of Judah
[41:12] according to the Commandment of the Lord
[41:15] to Joshua so this is the
[41:18] word now being fulfilled even though
[41:22] it's being passed down it's moving down
[41:25] but there comes a season and the word
[41:26] must be fulfilled Can someone say Amen
[41:29] it we we're seeing the word fulfilled
[41:32] and it might be you know I would love to
[41:34] have seen it uh you know some things
[41:36] manifest in my own life years
[41:38] ago but God even brings us to a season
[41:41] as we get older that we get to see the
[41:44] word fulfilled and we get to see the
[41:46] seasons come and so here we see now that
[41:50] uh was given apart among the children of
[41:52] Judah according to the Commandment of
[41:54] the Lord to Joshua even the city of arba
[41:57] and the father of anak which is a city
[42:00] uh which city is Hebron and Caleb drove
[42:03] then the three sons of anch jesiah and
[42:06] hamian and talmi the children of anch
[42:09] and he went up then into the inhabitants
[42:11] of De and the name of deir before was
[42:15] well I don't know how to even pronounce
[42:18] that karath seur and Caleb said he that
[42:22] smiteth Karo safur and taketh it to him
[42:27] will I give Asha my daughter to
[42:30] wife young ladies how do you feel if
[42:33] your daddy comes along and says you know
[42:35] what young men just go conquer these
[42:37] guys and I'll give you
[42:41] Victoria doesn't say anything about love
[42:44] doesn't say anything about any of that
[42:46] it's just you do this and here's the
[42:49] prize wow but you know God he never
[42:55] fails he knows what he's
[42:57] doing there might be a backstory there
[43:01] maybe this young man was very brave
[43:05] because he was very much in
[43:07] love you know imagine now it'd be like
[43:11] huh if my best friend goes up there he
[43:14] gets my
[43:16] girl I'm going to be brave Lord help me
[43:18] be brave because I'm not going to lose
[43:21] my girl to someone else because they
[43:23] were braver than
[43:25] I H just a side
[43:28] thought and so it was there he that
[43:31] smiteth and taketh it to him will I give
[43:34] uh my daughter to wife and oan the son
[43:38] of kazaz canaz the brother of Caleb so
[43:41] remember the the Bloodlines were a
[43:43] little different in that day took it and
[43:46] he gave him see here's a young man rises
[43:49] up boom done finished I get the
[43:53] girl gave him Asha his daughter to
[43:57] wife man I tell you how that comes down
[44:00] I think many a young man in love would
[44:03] figure he'd try and conquer the world
[44:06] and it came to pass as she come unto him
[44:09] that she moved him to ask of her father
[44:12] a
[44:14] field so something's happening here this
[44:17] is a
[44:19] catalyst now
[44:21] remember this
[44:24] promise is not to her new
[44:28] husband he is actually wanting her new
[44:32] husband to speak to his
[44:34] father-in-law to take care of business
[44:37] but she comes writing up and I want to
[44:39] be polite tonight and we'll just um
[44:44] we'll just cover it this way and it came
[44:45] to pass as she came unto him that she
[44:47] moved to ask of her father a field and
[44:50] as she lighted off of her donkey and
[44:53] Caleb said unto her what would EST
[44:57] thou who answered give me a
[45:00] blessing so here's a daughter coming
[45:03] Desiring a blessing anybody need a
[45:05] blessing tonight amen give us courage
[45:08] Lord to just be brave enough to ask for
[45:11] the blessing amen we're Sons and
[45:12] Daughters of God the blessing's there
[45:15] for us to ask she could have said well I
[45:17] don't want to bother my dad I don't want
[45:19] to I don't know you know just how this
[45:21] is but this girl was bold and she says
[45:23] you know what I I'm now a married woman
[45:27] uh and uh this is going to be Legacy of
[45:29] my family this is my legacy of God's
[45:31] promise that was spoken through Joshua
[45:34] and I'm going to claim it I'm going to
[45:36] claim it maybe she intended for her
[45:38] husband to claim it as it were but the
[45:41] promise was actually to
[45:43] her so never forget who the promise is
[45:48] to give me a blessing for thou Hast
[45:51] given me a
[45:53] Southland give me also Springs of water
[45:58] and he gave her the upper Springs and
[46:01] the nether Springs which is the lower
[46:04] Springs Heavenly Father we just ask you
[46:07] to bless this time together tonight be
[46:09] with our brothers and sisters who are
[46:10] not here tonight Lord strengthen them
[46:12] and father for those that Doe to weather
[46:15] whatever it might be just ask for your
[46:17] hand of Mercy on each and everyone in
[46:19] the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be
[46:24] seated so as we can go back in scripture
[46:27] and we can see the word that was spoken
[46:29] to Joshua and my brother and sister when
[46:32] God spoke to Joshua to rise up and go
[46:34] and possess the land he he didn't say go
[46:37] see if you can possess the land but he
[46:40] gave him a direct command to possess the
[46:43] land and uh I think sometimes we maybe
[46:46] give up a little too easy maybe there's
[46:48] something in our life a little little
[46:50] Thorn In the Flesh as the Apostle Paul
[46:52] said and you know we just kind of give
[46:54] up overcoming that thing after after a
[46:56] while maybe maybe a need for healing in
[46:58] our body and you know after a while we
[47:00] just decide we're going to live with it
[47:02] but my brother and sister when God gives
[47:04] you a promise when God gives you h a a a
[47:07] a very clear Vision out of the word it's
[47:10] not to see if you can amen we are not
[47:13] here today hoping to overcome things
[47:15] like cancer uh overcome the spirits of
[47:18] this age the word has declared that we
[47:21] are more than Overcomers and so we
[47:24] really need to approach everything thing
[47:25] that we're doing with the idea or fact I
[47:28] should say we're more than Overcomers
[47:31] not I'm trying to overcome but literally
[47:33] declare whatever this is Satan depart
[47:37] because I'm more than an overcomer so
[47:39] that is defeated in my life and I will
[47:41] manifest it I thought it was very nice
[47:43] brother Isaac sharing that because you
[47:45] see when it was thus sayith the Lord you
[47:47] are healed you have to carry on if you
[47:50] got up the next morning and said I guess
[47:52] that whatever that was it wasn't for me
[47:55] my brother and sister sometimes it takes
[47:57] action it takes some sometimes someone
[48:00] rising up and saying you know what I
[48:03] don't care what my feelings are my
[48:05] circumstance is God said it I believe it
[48:08] and I'm going to keep walking until I
[48:10] see it
[48:11] manifested amen and the problem we have
[48:14] sometimes is Satan is so good at warming
[48:16] in there and undermining the things of
[48:19] God that after a while we can make
[48:21] statements like well I guess healing
[48:23] wasn't for me Deliverance wasn't for me
[48:26] this wasn't for me or that wasn't for me
[48:29] that's not what the word said the word
[48:31] said it's been given to you amen and
[48:33] when a prophet of God put thus saith the
[48:35] Lord on it my brother and sister that
[48:37] should give even more confidence but I'm
[48:39] telling you my brother and sister when
[48:41] it said by your stripes you are healed
[48:43] that is thus saeth the Lord amen when
[48:47] you are delivered my brother and sister
[48:49] of all of these Spirits it is thus saith
[48:53] the Lord amen now is it more encouraging
[48:56] to maybe have a prophet of God to stand
[48:58] there and to declare that to you but
[49:01] we're living in an age of revealed word
[49:03] my brother and sister and every bit of
[49:05] this right here is thus saith the Lord
[49:08] and let's take it with the same
[49:09] confidence if the prophet was standing
[49:11] here and spoke it to us amen whether
[49:14] we're claiming a son or a daughter
[49:16] claiming a family member a husband a
[49:18] wife whatever it would be my brother and
[49:21] sister when the word said that we can
[49:23] come and claim them I heard a minister
[49:25] I'll just share this I heard a minister
[49:27] bring it this way if you have to tear
[49:30] the roof off and lower your family into
[49:33] the presence of God Amen start tearing
[49:37] the roof off don't sit back and say well
[49:39] I just hope I just hope I'm just
[49:42] thinking no my brother and sister if you
[49:43] need to tear the shingles off and lower
[49:45] them down in the presence of God start
[49:47] tearing the shingles off amen now you
[49:51] see it's not as we have here the Lord
[49:54] speaks to Joshua tells him to rise up
[49:57] and possess the land as I said already
[49:59] not go see if you can possess it or not
[50:02] this is not an experiment my brother and
[50:04] sister this is the word of God coming to
[50:07] pass amen so when you go to possess the
[50:09] land what does that really mean now we
[50:12] we don't want to Sidetrack into this but
[50:14] you see even in such a strong promise we
[50:18] recognize today wasn't didn't they share
[50:20] with us brother Trevor sister Carrie
[50:22] sister Jerry wasn't that Israel
[50:23] possesses 177%
[50:26] yes 17% of the land promised to them so
[50:30] you see my brother and sister even in
[50:32] possessing the land Israel is there as a
[50:36] nation but they did not fully possess
[50:39] the promise of the spoken word for them
[50:43] amen so it's one thing to say we've got
[50:45] the land but do we have all the land
[50:47] that God has promised us amen and that
[50:49] is a full complete deliverance a full
[50:52] and complete filling of the Holy Spirit
[50:54] a full and complete revelation of Jesus
[50:57] Christ not partials not we tried and
[51:01] we'll settle for this but God help us my
[51:03] brother and sister to possess the land
[51:07] amen and he also told them divide the
[51:09] land so you look at this and and you
[51:12] know people are have different ideas and
[51:14] they'll say well you know uh uh we see
[51:17] the Holy Ghost fell uh fell here and we
[51:19] see the Holy Ghost fell here and you
[51:22] know where does this fit uh you know
[51:24] even even well I don't want to get into
[51:27] a negative aspect but people will be
[51:29] like well some of that is just reserved
[51:31] for the ministry give me a
[51:33] quote give me scripture it's just
[51:35] reserved for Ministry all that was in
[51:39] Christ H did he pour it out or not amen
[51:43] we have to believe it's been poured out
[51:45] we can't sit back and say he held some
[51:47] back and gave it away secretly or or
[51:50] just left it on the Shelf it's been
[51:52] poured out my brother and sister we are
[51:54] here to possess the land amen not
[51:57] worried about what the inhabitant
[51:59] spirits of the land are but simply
[52:01] possess the land because this is who we
[52:04] were called to be
[52:06] right and you know what happened in
[52:08] Israel as we see it today even they
[52:11] allowed certain people to stay certain
[52:14] things they they created
[52:18] alliances you know I find it interesting
[52:21] just following a little deal along
[52:23] through some college students that m and
[52:25] large you can tell don't even believe
[52:27] there's a God and they bring up well if
[52:30] God is such a loving God why did he tell
[52:32] these people tell his people the Jews to
[52:36] kill everybody that don't sound like
[52:38] love but you see my brother and sister
[52:41] how God chose to phrase that I'm not
[52:44] concerned about what I see in that is
[52:47] God's telling you and I not to allow
[52:50] someone else some other Spirit to
[52:53] inhabit Our Land amen we've got to kill
[52:57] every single Spirit every single
[53:00] inhabitant because This Land is Our Land
[53:03] we're not here by compromise we're not
[53:05] here by some kind of shared joint tency
[53:08] we are here to be filled with the Holy
[53:10] Ghost God help us amen be filled with
[53:14] the Holy Ghost and let this be our land
[53:17] amen that we have possessed in the name
[53:19] of the Lord Jesus Christ so he tells
[53:21] them to possess the land he tells them
[53:23] to divide the land and it's there that
[53:26] time comes that you know division of the
[53:29] land my brother and sister uh I don't
[53:32] want to get too far off track tonight
[53:34] but you know God has gifts in the church
[53:36] but God didn't give everybody every
[53:39] gift so in the division of the Land
[53:42] There are some that have been given
[53:44] certain gifts and and uh they are to
[53:47] edify the body now never to edify the
[53:50] person it's there to edify the body so
[53:53] we don't run around as it would be by
[53:55] some kind of jealousy that this brother
[53:57] has this and I don't have well maybe
[54:00] your gift would be a gift that would be
[54:02] hardly recognized and that would be a
[54:04] gift say that you every day through
[54:07] prayer are lifting up and building up
[54:09] the body of Christ not a very public
[54:11] display right we're not publicans we're
[54:13] not going to or or the Pharisees we're
[54:15] not going to stand on the corner oh and
[54:18] I pray for you and I pray for this and I
[54:21] no no our prayer our gift might be a
[54:24] prayer Warrior gift that would be
[54:26] completely out of sight and out of mind
[54:28] but effective amen necessary to be done
[54:32] and sometimes we look at this and and
[54:34] you know say well that brother he's just
[54:36] so blessed God gave him this gift well
[54:38] my brother and sister maybe you don't
[54:40] know the full struggle of that gift you
[54:42] don't know what he sacrifices to fulfill
[54:45] God's call in his life and so it's there
[54:48] that we recognize that God is is
[54:51] dividing the land to each one of us
[54:54] according to to his desire not even
[54:56] according to our own Talent OR
[54:59] ability I always find it amazing that
[55:02] people that maybe don't have the best
[55:04] voice many times are very prolific in
[55:07] singing uh specials and things like that
[55:10] and people are like boy if I had a voice
[55:11] like that I would not sing well you
[55:13] don't understand they're manifesting a
[55:15] gift that was not in the flesh it was in
[55:17] the spirit and they are giving praise to
[55:20] God because they've been anointed to
[55:22] praise God and they're not going to let
[55:24] a poor voice
[55:26] I mean how many of us if God gave us a
[55:28] choice you know make you short and
[55:32] stubby make you you know have a big word
[55:34] on your nose give you a poor voice make
[55:38] you knock needed we wouldn't go through
[55:40] that list yes yes yes that's what I want
[55:43] to be yes but you'll find the body of
[55:46] Christ possesses every
[55:50] attribute so do we have to have a great
[55:54] voice to share a
[55:58] gift no no don't be thinking I'm trying
[56:01] to be political here and get specials
[56:04] out of you and encourage some of you
[56:06] that doesn't sing to sing well maybe I
[56:09] am but anyway look at this my brother
[56:12] and sister you see when the Anointed God
[56:15] doesn't care about the vessel he cares
[56:17] about what's in the vessel and when he's
[56:20] in the vessel The Vessel will be able to
[56:23] possess the land that God has given them
[56:26] are you with me tonight amen so look at
[56:29] this so as it is it's one thing divide
[56:32] the land and for the people to lay claim
[56:35] to the land but my brother and sister
[56:37] sometimes we lay claim to things I hope
[56:39] this doesn't pinch too much sometimes we
[56:41] lay claim to things that we make no
[56:44] actual effort to
[56:48] obtain I
[56:50] repented I got baptized I go to church
[56:57] so automatically I have the Holy
[57:00] Ghost right no you see there has to be
[57:05] something deeper inside to express the
[57:08] desire to possess what God promised us
[57:11] amen and I pray that each and every one
[57:14] Amen in this uh assembly this body of
[57:16] Believers would be filled with the Holy
[57:18] Ghost but it's not an automatic it's not
[57:21] just a given there's been many a person
[57:23] my brother and sister that thought that
[57:25] they could just sit back and do nothing
[57:27] and God would do this work for them but
[57:29] there has to be a faith that rise up
[57:31] there has to be an action that's taken
[57:33] and sometimes that action might just be
[57:36] your voice declaring thank you Lord for
[57:39] healing me and that voice if you could
[57:41] see would be like a wave going out
[57:44] through the atmosphere and it's changing
[57:46] everything around you and it's then
[57:48] increasing your own faith when you say
[57:51] I'm Healed I've got the Holy Ghost I'm
[57:54] going to make a a Rapture what you're
[57:56] doing is your voice is ringing out it's
[57:58] changing you know this is scientific
[58:00] right a voice creates a wave as it is a
[58:04] sound wave that goes out and it's
[58:06] changing an atmosphere around you what
[58:08] are you doing possessing the land I'm
[58:10] going to possess my healing I'm going to
[58:12] declare I'm Healed until the physical
[58:15] manifestation appears and proves that
[58:18] I'm Healed I believe it and I declare it
[58:21] and it is there that as Sons and
[58:22] Daughters of God we have to come to a
[58:24] place let our voice be raised up and let
[58:27] the impact of the wave of our voice
[58:29] touch the the world Amen the atmosphere
[58:33] I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ and when
[58:35] we grasp that not just as token words to
[58:38] be spoken but from our soul and we speak
[58:41] that forward we will start to live like
[58:44] the bride of Christ we'll start to think
[58:46] like the bride of Christ walk like the
[58:48] bride of Christ read the word like we
[58:50] are the bride of Christ because there
[58:53] has to be something that comes to prove
[58:56] my brother and sister that we are
[58:58] actually possessing this
[59:00] land amen I've had such scattered
[59:03] thoughts on this I hope it's making
[59:05] sense to you tonight amen you see
[59:08] sometimes we lay claim but nothing
[59:09] really happens amen but I'm here tonight
[59:13] to tell you that we are called to a
[59:15] higher calling amen we're not to be out
[59:18] here like the world and approach it all
[59:20] like the world we're not of them amen we
[59:23] were never called and in fact we were
[59:25] called to come out of them amen so
[59:28] there's a separation where we approach
[59:30] this land this promise that is given to
[59:32] us in an entirely different fashion amen
[59:36] and as we know it's then spoken to us
[59:38] that footsteps are possession my brother
[59:41] and sister I don't mean to be rude
[59:42] tonight but are we walking are we moving
[59:46] forward oh I I brother Paula had a rough
[59:49] week I don't feel like I didn't ask
[59:51] about feelings God didn't ask about
[59:53] feelings he asked you to possess the
[59:56] land and can we keep walking in the good
[59:59] days and the bad days mean moving
[1:00:01] forward possessing the
[1:00:03] land it's a it's actually a requirement
[1:00:06] my brother and sister we're going to
[1:00:08] have to possess the land am amen you
[1:00:12] know no we're not possessing leoda we're
[1:00:15] not possessing as it would be some chunk
[1:00:17] of land in the state of Idaho we're
[1:00:20] possessing a spiritual land a spiritual
[1:00:22] position that we move forward in amen so
[1:00:25] it here once again I want to just
[1:00:27] reiterate this your
[1:00:30] voice let it announce to the
[1:00:34] world let it tell the
[1:00:38] devil you know I remember years ago I
[1:00:40] used to think boy that brother's
[1:00:42] confident telling the devil get out of
[1:00:45] my way but literally we are my brother
[1:00:48] and sister you got to remember the sons
[1:00:51] of anch were some big guys they weren't
[1:00:54] little runty guys they were some
[1:00:55] Warriors they were you might say almost
[1:00:58] born and bred of these Mighty Warriors a
[1:01:01] a Fierce People and no wonder some you
[1:01:05] know there at kades barnea looked out
[1:01:07] and said we can't conquer these guys but
[1:01:09] you see what they had lost in that short
[1:01:12] period of time and the prophet of God
[1:01:14] speaks about this in our day how in such
[1:01:17] a short period of time we've lost the
[1:01:20] revelation of who we are and what we are
[1:01:22] supposed to be doing by the time they
[1:01:25] had waited across Jordan and marched
[1:01:27] into the land they had already lost the
[1:01:30] revelation of what it was to be the
[1:01:32] Conqueror yeah amen they had lost the
[1:01:35] Revelation that they were going to go
[1:01:37] out Scout the land they were going to
[1:01:39] see Victory m not how big the men are
[1:01:43] not how Fierce it is how walled the
[1:01:45] cities are they were supposed to go into
[1:01:48] the land and see Victory and come back
[1:01:51] and have a report brother Trevor we are
[1:01:54] going to going to take this land Lord
[1:01:56] amen it's been given to us I'm going to
[1:02:00] possess this land now I lay that out as
[1:02:02] a foundation a little bit as we move
[1:02:04] forward because sometimes my brother and
[1:02:06] sister things are easy come easy
[1:02:11] go God actually wants us to fight yeah
[1:02:16] sometimes God makes us walk out of this
[1:02:19] life
[1:02:21] spiritually scars on us you imagine
[1:02:24] imine you imagine we all make it to
[1:02:27] heaven we are rejoicing on the other
[1:02:30] side and there's not a scratch on us and
[1:02:33] all around us are these Warriors of the
[1:02:36] faith that are battle
[1:02:41] scarred I think they would look at us
[1:02:43] and say there's something wrong
[1:02:45] here
[1:02:48] amen but we're going to come and be just
[1:02:50] as battle scarred as any generation as
[1:02:54] any church age see we can't go on
[1:02:58] flowery beds of East we're going to be
[1:03:01] battle scarred you know let's not ask
[1:03:04] God to hide us in a bush
[1:03:06] somewhere let's ask God to let us
[1:03:09] manifest what's already in US amen and
[1:03:12] possess what's already been granted to
[1:03:15] us Amen Let me hurry along
[1:03:18] here you see as we looked at this
[1:03:21] scripture my brother and sister we see
[1:03:23] that she comes and approaches her father
[1:03:27] and uh you know the acknowledgement is
[1:03:30] is that you've already given me the
[1:03:32] South land so she already Is possessing
[1:03:35] now through a gift right that was thus
[1:03:38] saeth the Lord brought down and pass to
[1:03:40] her amen you ever notice how God does
[1:03:43] work in families he does carry things
[1:03:46] often times not always but often times
[1:03:48] he runs it through lineages and brings
[1:03:50] things down and I think that's beautiful
[1:03:53] amen but you see that it was there that
[1:03:57] she says you know I I want a blessing
[1:03:59] you've already given me the land I've
[1:04:01] already got possession of some of this
[1:04:03] in other words I can identify the
[1:04:05] ownership now if I could just put it to
[1:04:08] you this way tonight we already
[1:04:09] recognize that God sent Malachi for and
[1:04:12] revealed it opened it up to us and we
[1:04:15] see that in the word and we go then
[1:04:18] further into the word and we see all the
[1:04:20] promises that were meant to be fulfilled
[1:04:23] in this day men they couldn't be
[1:04:25] fulfilled in the sixth Church age or the
[1:04:27] fifth or fourth or third or 2nd or first
[1:04:29] but they are be fulfilled in this day
[1:04:32] and we'll look at that and realize hey
[1:04:34] there is a lot of responsibility that
[1:04:37] comes back on you and I it's not just
[1:04:39] God sent a prophet right we can all
[1:04:41] recognize that it's not just God sent a
[1:04:44] prophet what did that Prophet bring to
[1:04:46] us he brought us the Revelation that we
[1:04:50] possess the key to the land amen as
[1:04:53] Peter had the key key to the gospel amen
[1:04:55] the keys to the gospel God has through
[1:04:58] the revealed word of this hour given us
[1:05:00] the key to unlock this mystery or be
[1:05:03] able to see this mystery of who we are
[1:05:06] in this day and that's why it's so
[1:05:08] troubling when you see Believers of the
[1:05:10] message who don't really see who they
[1:05:13] are they just see there's a great
[1:05:15] mystery there's a message here there's
[1:05:17] something here but you see my brother
[1:05:19] and sister I hope this is this type not
[1:05:21] Doctrine tonight but you see what
[1:05:23] happens is you can have the land in
[1:05:27] other words see that God has sent a
[1:05:28] prophet and revealed word in this day
[1:05:31] but what good is the land if there's no
[1:05:37] water water represents life it can be
[1:05:40] represented as a spirit amen it is there
[1:05:44] my brother and sister that we possess
[1:05:46] land in other words know this message is
[1:05:48] true but if there's no water to make it
[1:05:50] grow and produce life we can have the
[1:05:53] Dead letter amen and know that that is
[1:05:56] truth without the life that would spring
[1:05:59] forth out of that you know when people
[1:06:03] are confident if I could just put it to
[1:06:04] you this way it doesn't always work for
[1:06:06] them but my brother and sister you want
[1:06:08] to know a confidence of the times and
[1:06:10] the seasons is when you go more North
[1:06:12] and see wheat Farmers planting wheat
[1:06:15] into ground that is dry six in deep but
[1:06:19] they still plant the seed because they
[1:06:22] know the water is going to come
[1:06:24] they know that it's going to rain in the
[1:06:26] right season and when that soil gets wet
[1:06:29] and it soaks down and the moisture
[1:06:32] that's underneath and the surface comes
[1:06:34] together they know that that is going to
[1:06:36] bring life amen have you ever felt dry
[1:06:40] Hallelujah we felt dry did you know
[1:06:42] though that you were a son or daughter
[1:06:44] of God Amen and so God brings in the
[1:06:47] season amen what we know deep down
[1:06:50] inside of us is there he brings a new
[1:06:54] moisture as it were he brings uh Showers
[1:06:57] of blessing come down on us and it
[1:07:00] Springs something to life amen some it
[1:07:03] just stays dry and it dies some don't
[1:07:05] have enough moisture the parable of the
[1:07:07] SE my brother and sister to get them
[1:07:09] going but there's a people can someone
[1:07:11] say Amen tonight there's a people that
[1:07:14] God said I planted you in good soil and
[1:07:17] I'm bringing the water of the word into
[1:07:19] your life I'm pouring my spirit out upon
[1:07:22] you and you are going to bring forth
[1:07:24] fruit Hallelujah not to be raised up to
[1:07:28] die and Wither on the road side but uh
[1:07:30] there it is and so here is is Caleb's
[1:07:34] daughter telling him I've got the land
[1:07:36] you've given me land but this land is
[1:07:38] not going to produce what it should
[1:07:40] produce unless I have the spring I need
[1:07:42] the water for my sheep or goats or
[1:07:45] horses or camels or whatever it is I
[1:07:47] need water uh to water them but maybe I
[1:07:50] also need water to grow feed for them
[1:07:53] and so dad what I want you to do amen
[1:07:56] finding favor with the father amen she
[1:08:00] come I want a
[1:08:01] blessing you know the minute that Caleb
[1:08:03] said I'll give you a blessing she didn't
[1:08:06] have to name
[1:08:08] Springs but if you see the spiritual
[1:08:10] type of this make that connection you'll
[1:08:13] realize she recognize the
[1:08:19] land can I just put it real
[1:08:22] personal my church AG book doesn't mean
[1:08:25] nothing unless I'm
[1:08:27] anointed to see what it really says yes
[1:08:34] sir take it down the prophet of God said
[1:08:36] your Bible when you get that Revelation
[1:08:39] your Bible becomes a whole new book why
[1:08:42] is it not a new book for
[1:08:44] everyone because you need the washing
[1:08:49] you need the life you need the
[1:08:52] spirit you need water and it's really
[1:08:57] easy to live isn't it when you're on top
[1:08:59] of the mountain right so she got the
[1:09:01] upper
[1:09:02] Springs I think even the positioning of
[1:09:05] it my brother and sister to me is a
[1:09:08] significance because he gives her the
[1:09:11] upper
[1:09:12] spring but the upper spring won't do any
[1:09:15] good when they're in the valley are you
[1:09:18] with me amen when you're on top of the
[1:09:20] mountain praise God all is well you
[1:09:23] still need a
[1:09:24] drink and when life is tough and you're
[1:09:27] in the valley you really need a drink
[1:09:30] amen so she wasn't wanting to just
[1:09:32] settle for it just a little bit you know
[1:09:34] I'll dig you a little ditch or we'll
[1:09:36] carry you some water she wanted all of
[1:09:38] it can someone say I want all of it amen
[1:09:41] I want all you've got for me Lord I
[1:09:43] don't want to just settle for a little
[1:09:45] bite or a little sip on a Sunday or on a
[1:09:47] Wednesday or at a special meeting I want
[1:09:50] all you've got for me and it's here in
[1:09:52] the book just describing amen what God
[1:09:55] promised through Moses and handed down
[1:09:58] to be manifested through Joshua right
[1:10:01] Jehovah savior amen coming down and
[1:10:04] Caleb a True Believer standing there and
[1:10:06] he laid enough seed in his own family
[1:10:09] that one day his daughter recognizes hey
[1:10:12] I've got an inheritance it's not daddy's
[1:10:15] inheritance it's not Uncle Joshua was
[1:10:18] inheritance this is my inheritance God
[1:10:22] has promised this to me
[1:10:24] and I want it oh can we say Amen tonight
[1:10:28] I want it it's my
[1:10:30] inheritance problem is we raised way too
[1:10:33] many people young and old in the message
[1:10:36] that they thought it was a prophet's
[1:10:38] inheritance failed to realize they
[1:10:40] stopped it at Moses or Joshua amen
[1:10:44] didn't realize that the promise of the
[1:10:45] word made it their inheritance made it
[1:10:48] their overcoming power made it their
[1:10:51] healing made it their anointing of the
[1:10:53] holy spirit amen made it their uh
[1:10:57] anointing of the blood washing over them
[1:10:59] cleansing them they didn't have to look
[1:11:01] back to another
[1:11:03] day I hope I'm making sense
[1:11:06] tonight you look at this my brother and
[1:11:09] sister see Asha recognized her
[1:11:13] need it's not about her daddy
[1:11:16] anymore are you are you with me not
[1:11:19] about what happened at Katie sparia
[1:11:22] she's standing in the the
[1:11:24] land on the
[1:11:26] land and says this word of Malachi
[1:11:31] 4 is for
[1:11:35] me not just fulfilling scripture you are
[1:11:37] the scripture fulfilled you are God
[1:11:40] fulfilling the word in this hour the
[1:11:42] Lord amen so it's there she says you
[1:11:46] gave me the Southland give me the
[1:11:48] Springs of water and he gave her he
[1:11:50] wasn't stingy right God's not stingy
[1:11:52] amen father wouldn't give his children a
[1:11:55] serpent or a Rock Amen so he gives her
[1:11:58] the upper Springs and he gives her the
[1:11:59] nether Springs which is the lower amen
[1:12:02] and you look at this we've made our
[1:12:05] claim on the land isn't it wonderful I I
[1:12:07] tell you my brother and sister it's a
[1:12:09] supernatural claim otherwise we'd just
[1:12:11] be dare I say in public we'd just be
[1:12:15] Baptists we'd be nazarine or really want
[1:12:19] to water it down and stretch it out we
[1:12:21] might even be Mormons or Catholics
[1:12:25] they recognize that God is
[1:12:26] real they recognize many of those
[1:12:29] believe God's A
[1:12:31] Healer but something's
[1:12:33] lacking because they believe they're
[1:12:37] fulfilling Joshua or I should let's take
[1:12:40] it back to Moses Moses's
[1:12:43] words and then Joshua's
[1:12:46] word by just going to
[1:12:49] church quite honestly I'm glad God never
[1:12:52] called me to be
[1:12:54] a Catholic
[1:12:55] priest because quite honestly I don't
[1:12:57] want oh this will come out
[1:13:00] wrong as a man I don't want to hear your
[1:13:06] problems I hope that's not too blunt I
[1:13:09] said as a
[1:13:10] man not as a Shepherd I I will I'll
[1:13:13] claim my my position but as a man I just
[1:13:16] sitting today you know my brother
[1:13:18] volunteered me for something and I'm
[1:13:20] hearing this whole dialogue going on and
[1:13:23] my brain is playing over and over again
[1:13:25] this short clip drama drama drama drama
[1:13:31] pretty soon I'm just like
[1:13:33] drama
[1:13:35] drama in my flesh I couldn't sit in a
[1:13:39] little box with a line of
[1:13:44] people forgive me I yeah just
[1:13:48] go open the door you're all forgiven
[1:13:51] just go
[1:13:55] but you see the word for the hour opens
[1:13:59] the door to your confession
[1:14:04] box and no I'm not on the other side of
[1:14:08] the little
[1:14:09] screen
[1:14:11] amen I know that's a little
[1:14:13] straight I warned you guys that as I get
[1:14:16] older I get
[1:14:18] Bolder but you see it we have a
[1:14:20] supernatural
[1:14:21] claim this is this is what God has given
[1:14:24] for you and I I cannot go no one else
[1:14:27] could have come to Caleb and said I'm
[1:14:30] here to possess your daughter's claim
[1:14:33] the only one who could claim the claim
[1:14:35] was her she had to be the one that made
[1:14:38] the claim even her new husband I don't
[1:14:41] believe he was some a shy guy I don't
[1:14:43] believe he was whatever but the truth of
[1:14:46] it was is the inheritance came through
[1:14:49] Caleb came through his daughter it was
[1:14:51] not someone else claim climing it for
[1:14:54] her she had to claim it that's why oh
[1:14:56] God help us that we would be able to
[1:14:59] live this gospel and present this gospel
[1:15:01] that our children would grow up
[1:15:03] realizing here's the land here's the
[1:15:06] word and I can claim it I don't need to
[1:15:08] have a high priest that would be a
[1:15:10] natural man I don't need to have this I
[1:15:12] can claim this and then I can step into
[1:15:16] the land that's been given to me and I
[1:15:18] can live on that land anointed by the
[1:15:22] Holy Spirit Washed by the Water of the
[1:15:25] word nurtured by drinking of the
[1:15:34] fountain have any of you ever received a
[1:15:37] half-hearted thank
[1:15:40] you I don't think any of us could
[1:15:43] ever say you know it just
[1:15:47] happens do you know where they got the
[1:15:48] term Indian
[1:15:50] giver or as a politically Cor correct
[1:15:53] would say today indigenous
[1:16:00] Giver did God ever give any of you ever
[1:16:03] a promise then take it away from
[1:16:06] you so you have a Promised
[1:16:09] Land we've got no excuse to not claim
[1:16:13] that
[1:16:14] land amen no matter how hard the trial
[1:16:17] is no matter what we have to do it's
[1:16:20] been given to us let's claim the land
[1:16:22] amen if you don't really feel like you
[1:16:24] have faith just keep walking the faith
[1:16:26] will come as you move forward amen
[1:16:29] hallelujah now let's look at
[1:16:32] this we recognize my brother and sister
[1:16:35] that we need to have water in our spirit
[1:16:38] we need to have uh a nurturing as it is
[1:16:41] and we can look in the natural and see
[1:16:44] that to make land
[1:16:45] live uh you you have to have water amen
[1:16:49] we we live in what was called the high
[1:16:51] desert right this area it grew pretty
[1:16:53] good Sage Brush but somebody realized
[1:16:57] that if this land had water this land
[1:16:59] would be fertile and it would grow and
[1:17:02] that's why in the spirit I hope you're
[1:17:04] following me I'm not going to take the
[1:17:06] time to break it all down in the steps
[1:17:07] tonight we're Believers amen but when
[1:17:10] you come and recognize that when we've
[1:17:12] come to a place that we're droughty
[1:17:15] let's just be honest has anyone ever
[1:17:16] been droughty amen that's when we kind
[1:17:19] of start to protect ourselves we curl up
[1:17:22] our leaves really don't want to
[1:17:23] fellowship with anyone I don't want to
[1:17:26] sing I don't want to this I just curl my
[1:17:28] leaves up amen sister Kristen you would
[1:17:30] understand like the desert and the
[1:17:32] cactus right you know I I've been
[1:17:34] privileged to see the the the beauty of
[1:17:37] the desert uh just north of flag uh I
[1:17:39] mean uh Phoenix there going up to
[1:17:41] Flagstaff in that super rainy season and
[1:17:44] it's like I've never seen this before
[1:17:46] cuz every Cactus has blooms all over and
[1:17:48] it's just beautiful well what's a cactus
[1:17:51] normally look like
[1:17:56] droughty get too close to me
[1:18:00] brother but that's not what God called
[1:18:02] us to be the water of the word watering
[1:18:07] Our Lives softening us and we just keep
[1:18:11] soaking it in and soaking it in and
[1:18:14] soaking it in I I forget what they say
[1:18:16] now uh I read this here recently how
[1:18:20] much water uh sagora Cactus can hold in
[1:18:26] the wet season it's tremendous I mean it
[1:18:29] just they just pull water in and pull it
[1:18:32] to every fiber of them so much if you're
[1:18:36] lost in the desert you can cut one of

[1:19:33] life but the letter of the law kth and
[1:19:36] so it's there that God if he give us the
[1:19:38] land did he give us a land Saints amen
[1:19:41] if he gave us a land he gave us water to
[1:19:43] make that land
[1:19:45] live amen not to be a detriment I oh I
[1:19:49] just you know if my family hadn't gotten
[1:19:51] the message I wouldn't find myself
[1:19:52] condemned no you'd find yourself
[1:19:54] condemned you would find yourself with
[1:19:56] these problems but here's the life
[1:19:58] here's the land go into the land step
[1:20:01] into the land and say God you gave me
[1:20:03] this land This Is My Land I'm going to
[1:20:05] live in this land I'm not going to be
[1:20:07] some you know shrunk up withered old
[1:20:10] Christian over here but I'm going to
[1:20:11] flourish in this land I'm going to be
[1:20:14] amen an overcomer in this land and a
[1:20:16] delivered in this land and everything
[1:20:19] that's a promise of the word I will find
[1:20:21] in this land
[1:20:24] amen no need to go find another
[1:20:27] land just need to look and live in the
[1:20:30] land God's given us amen an upper spring
[1:20:35] and a lower
[1:20:36] spring no matter where we
[1:20:39] are ain't that
[1:20:41] awesome I know you guys don't have these
[1:20:44] problems but some days I just feel so so
[1:20:48] discouraged and beaten down I just wait
[1:20:52] I just did did that a few days ago
[1:20:53] anyway um just feel like sitting down
[1:20:55] and
[1:21:05] crying not much response maybe a few of
[1:21:08] you feel like that
[1:21:13] occasionally but the word said look and
[1:21:19] live are we looking to Egypt
[1:21:26] are we looking to the promised
[1:21:29] land we looking to what we had or what
[1:21:32] God has already given
[1:21:35] us you see it's going to just depend on
[1:21:38] where we look and the Satan Satan's just
[1:21:41] like a you know the
[1:21:42] circus I I I told one of the men today I
[1:21:45] said the only thing missing from this
[1:21:47] program this morning is some monkeys in
[1:21:49] a
[1:21:49] cage and then I re clarified that cuz I
[1:21:52] thought thought maybe I am the monkey in
[1:21:54] the
[1:21:55] cage but you see my brother and sister
[1:21:58] it's all in what we're
[1:22:00] possessing possess a bad attitude
[1:22:04] nothing's right I know that you guys
[1:22:06] don't do that but it might be people
[1:22:08] like you that sometimes get a bad
[1:22:10] attitude you know like you wake up on
[1:22:13] the wrong side of the bed and especially
[1:22:15] if your bed's pushed against the wall
[1:22:16] it's rough when you wake up
[1:22:19] and but look we're human
[1:22:24] and we'll carry the bad attitude come on
[1:22:26] preach with me Saints we'll carry the
[1:22:28] bad
[1:22:29] attitude just as long as we feel
[1:22:35] Justified we can make it from 6:00 a.m.
[1:22:38] to 11:00 p.m. carrying that but you ever
[1:22:43] take oh are you with me you ever take a
[1:22:46] drink from the spring and you'll find
[1:22:50] yourself turning back and going and and
[1:22:52] say forgive me I'm sorry you were still
[1:22:56] wrong but anyway I don't want to have a
[1:22:58] bad
[1:23:00] attitude
[1:23:02] Hallelujah I know you guys don't do that
[1:23:04] kind of stuff Paul
[1:23:07] does that's why sister Jerry is probably
[1:23:10] considered a
[1:23:11] saint but
[1:23:14] anyway but back to the thought we'll
[1:23:16] carry that just as long as we choose to
[1:23:19] carry it but if you ever stop and start
[1:23:22] drinking
[1:23:25] it might be scripture it might be a
[1:23:28] quote it might be a tape but you start
[1:23:31] drinking that Spirit can't stay there we
[1:23:35] have the perfect remedy my brother and
[1:23:37] sister Satan tried to poison the land we
[1:23:41] put the water of the word on the land
[1:23:42] and it becomes fertile again in a
[1:23:46] heartbeat Hallelujah no matter where we
[1:23:48] are up the mountain down the mountain or
[1:23:50] whatever there's a spring of Living
[1:23:51] Water amen Amen on our Mountain we need
[1:23:53] living water in our Valley we need
[1:23:55] Living Water now I want to just uh uh
[1:23:58] I'm not saying this will go real quick
[1:24:00] here as it were because it's quite a big
[1:24:01] quote I hope you don't mind amen but we
[1:24:04] know one thing my brother and sister
[1:24:06] there is always a fountain open in the
[1:24:08] House of David now like the little
[1:24:11] Welshman here in broken sisters like the
[1:24:13] little Welshman said or one time when
[1:24:15] they had the Welsh revival going on
[1:24:17] there were some dignitaries from the
[1:24:19] states some of these great doctors of
[1:24:21] divinity went over to Wales to find out
[1:24:24] where and what all this was about so
[1:24:27] they had on their turned around callers
[1:24:29] that's about how I feel about ties but
[1:24:32] anyway they had their turned around
[1:24:33] collars and their pug hats and they was
[1:24:35] walking down the street here come a
[1:24:38] little cop uh uh along whirling his
[1:24:41] little old billy club in his hand and
[1:24:43] whistling down at the cross where my
[1:24:45] savior died down there for cleansing
[1:24:48] from sin I cried there to my heart was
[1:24:50] the blood applied Glory to his name
[1:24:53] walking down the street and they said
[1:24:55] this seems to be a religious man we'll
[1:24:57] go ask him and they said mister and he
[1:25:00] said yes sir amen he said uh we're here
[1:25:03] from the United States and we're a
[1:25:05] delegation and we come over here to
[1:25:07] investigate the Welsh Revival uh soall
[1:25:11] and we are doctors of divinity and we're
[1:25:13] here to look it over he said we want to
[1:25:15] know where the Revival is and where it's
[1:25:17] held and he said
[1:25:19] sir you have arrived
[1:25:23] I want to ask you tonight have we
[1:25:25] arrived amen by God's grace amen we
[1:25:28] don't got to go look ain't got to go
[1:25:30] look for no
[1:25:32] Revival we are the Revival
[1:25:37] amen I am the Welsh Revival amen the
[1:25:41] Welsh Revival is in me and here is where
[1:25:44] it's at that's the way it is when you
[1:25:47] live by that Fountain of Living Waters
[1:25:50] amen amen I'm telling you this this all
[1:25:54] this thought just came together so
[1:25:55] lovely I I just love this quote it just
[1:25:58] you know leaped out in my studies to me
[1:26:01] that's what it is this is how I
[1:26:04] am
[1:26:06] when I start curling
[1:26:09] up and start getting
[1:26:12] prickly somebody say amen
[1:26:15] amen is when I haven't been drinking
[1:26:20] from the fountain yeah but when I drink
[1:26:24] from the fountain I can't help it praise
[1:26:29] God oh you know the story brother Brown
[1:26:32] told about the lady looking out the
[1:26:34] windows and one day she cleans her own
[1:26:37] window oh praise God the neighbor lady
[1:26:42] cleaned her
[1:26:44] Windows
[1:26:46] yeah when we use that
[1:26:49] Fountain everything looks better
[1:26:52] everything is better amen drink drink
[1:26:57] again when you live by that Fountain of
[1:26:59] Living Waters it's living all the time
[1:27:02] bubbling over and over and over and over
[1:27:04] and over and there is no end to it not
[1:27:07] go see if some water if we had rain here
[1:27:10] not long ago that's not it it's that
[1:27:12] Fountain of Living Water as I say it
[1:27:15] gives its water
[1:27:18] free you don't have to put Rags on it to
[1:27:21] find out some educational rag for you
[1:27:23] can send him out to preach and see if he
[1:27:26] spells his words right you know I'd
[1:27:27] flunk
[1:27:28] this I I would seriously flunk this you
[1:27:31] know I look at this and I'm thinking
[1:27:33] thank you Lord because I would never be
[1:27:35] able to make it through their
[1:27:37] school if he spells his words
[1:27:40] right speaks them right if he uses his
[1:27:44] nouns and pronouns and so forth and
[1:27:48] adjectives many of them I just want want
[1:27:52] to make a comment I just wanton
[1:27:54] to many of them don't even know what
[1:27:57] they are but he's living at the fountain
[1:28:01] just the same see the same it don't have
[1:28:04] to depend on local rain to fill it up or
[1:28:08] local
[1:28:10] Revival for it it don't have to do that
[1:28:13] for its power and its Purity is within
[1:28:17] itself amen yes sir Hallelujah I can
[1:28:21] scrub this out outside man and I can
[1:28:23] tell this outside man you will not this
[1:28:25] and you will not that but that will not
[1:28:27] change the inside man but when the
[1:28:29] Inside Man drinks from The Fountain and
[1:28:33] he changes pretty soon we start seeing
[1:28:34] that outside man becomes a different man
[1:28:37] altogether I thank the Lord for that
[1:28:40] Hallelujah his power to purify that
[1:28:43] might make a good sermon title amen for
[1:28:46] its power and its Purity is within
[1:28:48] itself why it's Christ in you and that's
[1:28:51] where the the word is its own power and
[1:28:54] when a man can receive it in his heart
[1:28:56] it's got its Purity it's got its power
[1:29:01] it's right in the word itself and it
[1:29:03] Springs forth the
[1:29:06] life I think Caleb's daughter had a
[1:29:11] revelation this land is of no value if
[1:29:16] there's no water I have to have the
[1:29:19] water and I say tonight this word this
[1:29:22] message we love so much without the
[1:29:25] spirit of God watering us moving in US
[1:29:30] it won't produce
[1:29:31] anything and I think God designed it
[1:29:33] that way because there are those that
[1:29:35] say there was I went I was in a message
[1:29:37] church for 20 years there's nothing
[1:29:39] there maybe they never made it to the
[1:29:42] Fountain but to those that have made it
[1:29:44] to the Fountain and they flourish yeah
[1:29:47] and life is abundant and they produce
[1:29:49] fruit you realize it takes water
[1:29:52] to produce fruit yeah now it's
[1:29:54] interesting just one last thing
[1:29:56] musicians if you please come one last
[1:29:58] thing remember when we were where were
[1:30:02] we the old olive trees on the mountain
[1:30:06] up there
[1:30:08] um Garden yeah they were talking about
[1:30:13] how
[1:30:14] old how old they
[1:30:18] are I don't want to be a weakend
[1:30:20] Christian
[1:30:22] I don't want to be a five-year Christian
[1:30:24] I don't want to be a 10-year Christian I
[1:30:25] don't want to be name the
[1:30:27] years I want to be a a Christian
[1:30:32] period not for a period of
[1:30:35] time to wake up one day and say I run
[1:30:38] out of water I can't produce fruit I'm
[1:30:42] done
[1:30:44] no we're living by the
[1:30:47] fountain in fact the very
[1:30:50] Fountain is
[1:30:52] producing everything that we are the
[1:30:56] very spirit of God I hope that this made
[1:31:00] sense tonight just a little thought
[1:31:02] that's just been walking and talking and
[1:31:05] driving around with me I just felt
[1:31:08] tonight might be a good night to express
[1:31:11] it you see my brother and sister let's

[1:31:33] presence we'll find that that will do a
[1:31:37] lot to take away the isms and sisms and
[1:31:39] the struggles and the things of Life
[1:31:42] that'll take a lot you know years ago

[1:31:56] absolutely they were a little
[1:31:59] [Music]
[1:32:01] surprised it's actually quite
[1:32:04] inexpensive but it requires absolute
[1:32:09] commitment whatever we have need of the
[1:32:13] fountain will provide and we'll flourish
[1:32:17] we'll grow we'll be strengthened and
[1:32:20] we'll have revelation can we say Amen
