God's wonderous Grace to me he hath made known nor why unworthy Christ in love redeemed me for his own but I know who I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day I know not how this saving Faith to me did impart nor how be believing in his word brought peace within my heart but I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him again against that day I know not how the spir moves convincing men of sin raling Jesus Through the word creating faith in him but I know who whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is a to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day I know not what of good or ill may be deserve for me of weary ways or golden days before his face I see but I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that let's all dance together and sing but I know who Lord may come at night or noon day Fair nor if I'll walk the veil with him or meet him in the a but I know whom I have belied and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day oh but I know who I have believe it and God bless you to keep that which I committed unto him against that day one more time but I know who I have believe and am persuaded that he is a able to keep that which I committed unto him against that day can we give the Lord a hand clap of Praise of thank you for his grace his Mercy his goodness to us amen hallelujah hallelujah good to be here today amen amen just once again Welcome to our visitor and uh God bless you brother Andrew I enjoyed our our little time the other night uh amen it's always like the preacher syndrome after we get done I'm like why did I talk so much but uh Lord bless that time God bless you brother good to see you again each and every one of you amen I just like to say I'm looking forward to welcoming our brother Phillip in church amen Hallelujah um I just saw a picture of him there with a uh little cap on and I don't know I could be wrong but I thought another Sammy amen handsome little guy I'm going to tell you I think sami's a handsome little guy amen so that's good let's remember our brother Isaac uh due to the negligence of others uh brother Isaac has had to work today and uh so we just want to remember he called me right before the service just desired to be remembered desired our prayers that uh they could accomplish what is necessary I also want to announce brother Bob's funeral uh will be on uh Friday the 18th so this coming Friday fle a funeral home in Caldwell there on the boulevard where sister Joanne's funeral was at 10:00 a.m. and the gravide will be at the Marsing Homedale Cemetery um and uh which if you don't know where that's at go to Marsing drive straight through town and uh I don't encourage you to miss the curve but at the curve it's straight ahead amen you do have to turn off but um then we want to have a fellowship here at the church I I don't know what to say for time but um that can all be sorted out I guess and um so have a little Fellowship here at the church following uh just uh remember the family in prayer you know brother Bob had a good long life uh got to see the mighty hand of God in his own life in his family uh but um in those places and people he rubs shoulders with uh but still it leaves a void amen and um every loved one that passes on brother sister leaves the void so let's just remember all of that amen well praise the Lord let's turn in our Bibles I want to speak to you this morning on the humanity of Christ and uh you know it uh often times if we're not careful we put we put the Lord so far out there that he actually becomes Untouchable and uh we lose lose the context of scripture when it says that he knows the feelings of our infirmities we we lose that context we we start thinking that it's just almost impersonal Satan would like to turn it into an impersonal God that we serve but he is very very personal and uh we can see that all through scripture how that that God uh is is personal enough that it actually scares mankind that's right God can be so personal that man just is like oh my what but remember why run from him he knows the thoughts and the intents of our hearts amen so we can run and hide and he still knows oh yeah and it didn't change a single thing in our life except for we did a lot of running that's right and and uh and Satan loves that Satan you know and it's even evident in the very nature of humanity the fight or flight and Satan wants us to always run he wants us to run away from problems run away from our reality oh did I say that out loud run away from our own reality that if I run far enough I somehow will leave it behind but I'm sorry it is who you are until you have a new birth that's exactly right and at the new birth amen we can stop turn around and fight amen say it no running no longer running Satan I finally recognize who I am in Jesus Christ and this is something worth fighting for hallelujah oh no not not that we're afraid to go to hell but for the joy of serving him amen for the joy of who we are in Jesus Christ am am amen let's turn in our Bibles amen the humanity of Christ let's turn in our Bibles to Hebrews the 5th chapter 8-14 and uh very common uh scripture for us amen sister suoth I forgot to thank you for the gifts but I appreciate that amen very much and uh God bless each one of you Hebrews 5 and 8 though he were son so his identity is already settled amen that's right identity is already settled yet he learned yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered yes sir and being made perfect so he come through the suffering just fine and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that say Jesus Christ is is a savior see there's a problem we're running into in the world today how Satan has Twisted the word just having a conversation with a gentleman the other day and I make him nervous we're we're we've been friends since all the way back in school known this man for forever every time I get near him he always reminds me that religion is a very personal thing and you don't have to talk about it few days ago he looked me in the face and says now Paul I'm a Believer it was all I could do maybe I shouldn't have restrained myself but it was all I could do to keep from saying and the devil believes also that's right sir it takes obedience that's right the author of Eternal salvation to all them that obey him called of God a high priest after the order of MDC of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing you are now remember I I I'm not one to call back to things remember recent service here about hearing yes sir so many things are tied to our Hearing in the natural your hearing the loss of causes a fundamental erosion of the mind which they call Alzheimer's and Dementia it has to do with our balance so many things are tied in hearing natural but spiritual that's right absolutely right for when the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belong to them that are of full age amen are we of full age today Saints even those who by reason of use yes sir amen got to use it got to get out you got to fight you got to believe you got to confess that's right that's right yes sir have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil Heavenly Father we ask you to bless this time in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated now if we would turn first Peter 2 21- 2 as we look at this Humanity of Christ I want to bring it down on a personal level of how oh you'd say yes of course God would understand us he created us but my brother and sister it's much deeper his understanding than we comprehend verse 21 for even here unto were you called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps now I would like to say wouldn't it seem like it would be so easy just simply to look down and say I'm going to follow these steps but how clever Satan is to put so many distractions in our lives so much he confused uses us we have times when people that we respect so much and view so much and and yet they seem to fail they seem to waver and and if we're not careful we start looking at them and not at Christ and just as it is you know we can walk out on the water my brother and sister do you realize walking out on the water is not nearly as complicated as we think it is if we could just look Beyond ourself as long as we look at self we'll never walk on water amen as long as we look at self we'll never rise into Heavenly places as long as we look at self we'll never attempt to climb out of our Valley but when we look Beyond ourself and look to Christ and Christ Alone we'll find that we can then uh take his example and we can take a holdz of that example and realize it's it's not being a Christians not for sissies in fact being Washed by the wave of the spirit of L de is the that's the weakling route is just to let go and wherever it takes me I'll go whatever it was meant to be was meant to be a good story Satan but that's not the story of a son or daughter of God a son or daughter of God was not meant to drift my brother and sister but they were meant to hold on be anchored in the Rock Amen and it takes strength to hold on to the rock it is not something that we do for a moment or a season of time but it is something something that you determined in your mind in your heart soul and your body that I'm going to hold on to the Rock and whatever storms may blow you'll say I'm still holding on and then you'll realize when the storm has passed it wasn't you your strength waned long ago but it was him holding you holding on Amen and when he's holding you amen you can stand this test of time amen that we should follow in his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth and I want to just not get sidetracked but my brother and sister the word of God he doesn't hold sin against our account so when you read this and you say well okay that was Jesus Christ he did know sin do you realize in God's eyes you did no sin that's right you fit in this scripture you are a part of this economy because God said no my blood has washed over them has washed them wider than and snow and I see nothing because I'm looking at them through the blood amen blood my brother and sister so I I want to use the word symbolic but it is so ingrained into the very uh plan of God that that blood more powerful amen more powerful my brother and sister than any one thing you know how deceiving Satan is I'll share this with you sister Jerry and I come across a little clip the other today this man is talking about how that they found a cave and in there they could see there was a stain and they scraped some of that and they went and tested the DNA have you guys seen this amen and they tested the DNA and in there was an unidentified DNA and they also found the DNA of Mary really oh people rejoicing they found God's de DNA they found the blood of Jesus Christ and the DNA of Mary and the DNA of God Amen here of Jesus Christ but my brother and sister there was not one part of that we understand by the word that was tied back to Mary God used her for an incubator and if Mary Rose up today like there are longing for her she would say you guys are deceived amen because this was not me and God this was God Alone alone amen so there's no way to take this DNA back to Mary Mary would deny it if she was here today but how clever they are to be able to tie the whole story together of maryom Amen it's a religion unto its own my brother and sister and if we're not careful we'll take it in the birth of the word are you with me in the birth of the word people will then say Oh yes this is of God but it's also got this with it no I'm sorry it's of God and of God Alone this is not a word that takes man to make it happen man is the subject the tool that God uses to manifest and bring his word to pass but you'll never get there and find that in that great book it'll be written that you and Jesus Christ it's Christ alone it's the word alone it's his life alone that brings life in US amen that's right and it's so easy how these things can be slid in there who did verse 22 who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled when I read this scripture my brother and sister verse 23 I don't want to use the word condemn cuz that wasn't it convicted this convicted my heart I still find in the right time in the right place I want to push back I want to react to this I want to let them know what is right and wrong who when he was reviled reviled not again Lord help us amen when he suffered he threatened not amen amen but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously amen we would like to think that we have good judgment Would we not and our judgment is so flawed we can't even recognize the flaw our judgment is so prejudiced or biased that we can't even recognize it you know you're pretty close to truth when you recognize you're wrong about the truth bet see because that's what the word was meant to do is to cause us to recogn where we were short amen who his own self bear our sins and his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live un righteousness by whose Stripes you are healed for you were a sheep going astray imagine that you know as I've shared with you Church before I still have occasional bouts of vertigo if you meet me on the highway you might want to pull off in McDonald whether you want to go there or not just till I'm passed but I I want to tell you and hopefully you can see this little analogy when you have vertigo you think you're walking a straight line but you're not amen and sometimes as you learn to recognize the natural symptoms I want to be healed of this amen amen yes I'm almost scared anymore to climb on top of Machinery cuz I can be standing up there 2 feet on solid metal and suddenly just that's not not a good feeling right but you see we're a sheep going astray and if we had a witness of those sheep they would say praise God we're on the straight and narrow way but they're actually going astray but are now returned and to the shepherd and the bishop of our souls where we once was drifting away God has come now often times people think that Christians are arrogant because the very fact that they would say God save me from The Wretched wreck of this world that I was am and they say well you're no different no that's true that's right I'm no different there's still this Humanity that's standing here it still has flaws it still has weaknesses but I'll tell you what it has that it never used to have is a desire in its soul to serve you Lord I'm going to stand on your word I want to go forward I want to walk the way you called me to walk and that didn't use to exist but it does now more each and every day more and more and more and that will be right there that one day I believe this just my own little personal glimpse of it that Enoch not the perfect man we think he was but he was perfect in his approach to God and one day I could see Enoch walking and he's there saying Lord I just want to please you and that next step was a little higher I want to serve you Lord that next step a little higher it wasn't some oh you're so perfect Enoch go now but he was there expressing a heart's desire of who I want to be Lord who you call me to be and who I will be amen amen cuz if we're only just hoping to achieve that's it you'll spend your whole lifetime hoping amen that's right but somewhere along the line the word says that you're going to speak your confession will become your identity that actually scares me even though it's wrote on chalkboard in our garage don't let anything negative you know are you any of you with me I'm not hopefully I'm not out on the plank off the pirate ship amen and we'll find ourselves speaking negative even though we know that that's not who we are and that's not what we want to accomplish and that's not what we've been anointed to do but Satan is so clever to get in there and he has broken the communication and what we know to do when I would do good evil right is present in the broken communication with me the heart says but the brain says that's it and then whichever one has preeminence at that moment that's that's right praise God Amen I'll tell you what I'm not afraid to admit today that I was a sheep going astray but I don't plan on staying astray and I don't want to be astray today I want to stand on the word because I was going astray but I'm no longer going astray because of the humanity of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah now humanity is a quality of being human now in the world we live in they say now that they have developed robots AI that are so realistic that at a reasonable distance or whatever you can't separate them from Humanity they make them look so and act so my brother and sister what they don't have is a soul that's right and no chip brother pant no grain of sand is ever going to give them a soul amen no conscience of the rights and the wrongs amen none of that can come because that was a gift of our creator that's right Hallelujah and now humanity is benevolent and kind and charitable now my brother and sister you look at this in the world today you'll find that that just watching a little on the street interview and and they said well are a Christian I used to be well why aren't you now well God is not the kind loving God that everybody says he is now I don't know backstory my brother and sister but I tell you what I have grieved I have grieved the Holy Spirit Come on can we say amen I have grieved the Holy Spirit and he was kind and he was compassionate and he was loving and he come back and brought me back into Fellowship not a God that casts me to the side not a God that says oh you failed one too many times you're done amen but a kind benevolent God Amen that is there one who loves us his grace is sufficient for our life and he was the author of your life that's it with some variable in there right permissible will that's right but let's not go to seat on permissible will God knew what our life would be he knew some would be drunks and prostitutes on streets he knew people would be murderers he knew what people would be and he said I'm going to save them anyhow I'm going to claim that Soul anyhow the devil would say it's so tarnished it's so black it's so whatever and God says hey I tell you what I got more than a three-step plan amen I've got a whole book that I wrote and I'm going to give them and they're going to be anointed to eat that book and when they eat the book it's going to be belly it's going to make their belly bitter to look back and say oh Lord what I did to grieve you but Lord I want more of the book give me more of your word amen amen that's he was kind he knew what we needed for restoration you know for some people as I've shared before met a brother back east had killed a man amen become a Christian in prison boy it just doesn't seem like that's a perfect recipe but it is it is amen a perfect recipe that's right cuz in that same prison God chose to let him out but in that same prison now there's dozens of Believers when's the last time we went into a Maximum Security Prison sat in the cafeteria and talk to people who killed people who did horrible things God knows what he's doing that's exactly right cuz I'm telling you there's no degrees of sin so what's the difference between you and a murderer that's exactly right yeah well people say the scripture says God wrote the scripture let him divinely interpret it yes sir amen cuz maybe I I I don't know if the Lord will have me preach this or not but I've just been mulling over a thought my brother and sister that maybe it's time for a changing of our thinking we've got it all boxed up but it might not be the same box that God's using I'll tell you what I would say thank you Lorden amen because you know I'll give us a little history lesson here amongst the Puritans they live so pious but history records that down inside they were full of anger because they were trapped in their own piety did I say that right yeah trapped within themselves of their own righteousness yeah that's it and the word says our righteousness is filthy rags imagine I would stand before you and tell you I'm so much more of a Christian than you and I would be presenting this and God would be looking down seeing a man in filthy rags why we see ourselves as this great overcoming almost sinless seething inside Lord help us amen Lord help us let me look through your lens Lord not mine right amen but God knew what we needed for restoration aren't you glad you know our brother da he he rest does restoration work on all kinds of of potteries and different things like that even a few paintings and and whatnot and and uh one day he was sharing with me to do uh restoration it it don't matter how good your paint is or how original your paint was or somehow you figured exactly what to do to make that just if we joked about this you turn Paul loose with this magnificent piece of pottery that's been broken what are you going to put it back together with well I'll tell you my brother and sister subf Flor adhesive will hook almost anything together but it won't restore that Pottery back to its original right right you know you can buy subfloor adhesive Home Depot big tubes $77.99 you imagine how much Pottery you can fix with that but it's not the right thing that's right so as we're trying to bring Restoration in the church through our own thinking through our own process through our own approach to things we just end up with a mess and it's all done it's glued together they don't smoke they don't drink they don't dance they don't do this they don't do that but it's not the perfect restoration God says I'll come and restore amen everything that's been eaten and taken away and everything that's been broken and everything I'll restore that will we let him do it his way or will we do it our way amen and when we do it our way we wonder why it never quite works out amen hallelujah our need for restor ation Can someone say thank you Lord for restoration of the word in our life amen not just to say I've got the word and this is what's correct but let the word be you that's it and when the word is you then you match the miror perfect image of the original amen amen it's not made possible by religion yes sir in fact sometimes I think religion actually makes it worse yes sir amen amen self-help Hallelujah I love self-help yes sir man I couldn't get it right the first time but now I read a book and it's going to be perfect no my brother and sister self-help is not an answer sir amen there's only one book that's got the answer in it but you got to have the Holy Ghost to even interpret this book correctly amen without the Holy Ghost it just becomes another book we read that is a form of selfhelp are that's exactly right amen yes sir and it won't make a difference if the pastor or the priest gives you Absolution you are forgiven cuz I said so the scripture says they're ravening wolves that's it there's only one way to fix it that's it that's through the word that's it through a restoration of a man's soul back to Jesus Christ amen to be able to look at the word and say you know what that's me that's it help me Lord forgive me Lord that's me David was in that position amen when it was spoken to him and it was there of the sheep and it was there and David passed righteous he was not in a righteous position but he passed righteous judgment amen and said that man ought to be and he told him that's you David and David didn't dig out books and say I'll prove to you that's not me I'm the king I'm above reproach I'm above this I've been a message Pastor I've been a Christian I've been no David said oh God forgive me amen because the word come right down to his soul and said you know what I I see I see that's what I've done I see that's who I am God forgive me that's right and God told David it's going to cost you David that's it but I forgive you that's it people get mistaken at the idea that they go out and sin willfully that it's just oh forgive me Lord and just march on no sir God this might not come out right so don't judge it by Paul's words but God will extract a price from your life amen Saul Paul man we don't know this for a fact cuz we couldn't dig into his mind but my brother and sister it seems to be very clear through history that Paul speaking of some of those Thorns they weren't all physical amen Paul would have relived some of those Saints yes sir that he had slain as he stood there and held their cloak imagine now a man committed to God at this stage of his life God using him as an oracle to speak the word and change lives and go to sleep at night and have images y yeah right that's it maybe he saw Steven's face Maybe Steven come every night not as a ghost not as a haunt but as a memory and Paul would say oh I have a thorn in this flesh did that stop him from being an oracle of God preaching the truth standing up laying it down straight that it could so strong and so straight it's lasted the ages amen that's pretty strong and that's pretty straight to last the ages my brother and sister but God still allowed Paul to have to deal with that that's it oh help us Lord amen you know I I actually have several books like this you know how to wire a house electrical how to wire a house I don't know why I ever you know forked over the five bucks to own a book that says how to wire a house I know how to wire a house amen but sometimes you know the feebleness of humanity just needs a reminder if Isaac was here brother Isaac was here he would say I know what you're talking about Paul because you know what's happened I've messed up wiring a three-way switch so many times that now my way of fixing a three-way switch Isaac come do this three-way switch I don't care it's in the book that's it I still sometimes get confused on the leg Yeah and which one comes to the ground and comes back and get it all wired up take a tester go over to the other box the little light comes on how can that light come on and the light that this little tester light comes on and the light doesn't amen but that's what we got for religion today that's it right yeah yeah the real light that we really are trying to get lit up doesn't come on but we have tested it but then when you get that right so now why didn't Why didn't well he did but he didn't why didn't God just give us a book and we can how to be a righteous man get up in the morning wash your hands three times make sure they're pure before you pick up the book and uh then read at least 32 verses short prayer Lord don't worry about the rest of the world today bless me why didn't he just give us something like that but every one of us pick up this book but I want to ask you a very straightforward question does it always speak come on there's parts of this book we would stumbled the rest of our life over what it meant the theologians and the wise men the wise and The Prudent are still stumbling why do you understand that's it because he said it's not just about giving you the book it's about making the book live in you that's it and when the book lives in you we can be of a lower IQ and I say that because that's kind of where I fall my brother and sister not no super smart person you can be of that lower etron of the IQ and it speaks to you and it's real and it's living and it's powerful amen but the wise and The Prudent are still going looking oh there's been another another dialect found in Northern Iraq we got to go learn it see if it applies to the word well why don't you just get Revelation that's it why don't you instead of spending time and all that brain wave why don't you just get close to God and let him show you what the book says hallelujah you know there's a difference in school some of you I know are very brilliant very smart God bless you for that some of us we got to put our hands on it right but once we've ever put our hands on it we can do it again and again and again and again amen had a person asked me one time this is actually even before we started putting GPS on tractors how do you make your row so straight brother Paul I made these rows so straight because of the million crooked rows I made before it and that's what God's doing in your life did he stop you red lights flashing someone running out in your life don't go there no God just let you go he let you make that mistake and then he inspired you out of his book to realize that's not what it's about that's right and brought us back but our next attempt might not been much better I know this isn't necessarily fitting but it's a good analogy when I was a young man first started farming I could start on the Square edge of a field and I had an edge to to drive down to put the first Rose in and by the time I got down there to about where sister Alice is at it looked like I was riding cursive no matter how I started but then now we're at the other end I'm not going to walk back there then as we come to the other end suddenly we have another reference and somehow the Crooked rows just start getting straighter and straighter until literally your last pass through the field would be back straight again but you would look in the middle and it' be like that's confusion but you see my brother and sister that's what God's doing with you and I don't go looking back in the middle of your field you look where God started in your life and you look where God is finishing in your life and he'll take care of everything we used to joke that there's more corn out there because the rows were longer but my brother and sister God is working we need to look to this Finish Line we don't need to look back to that midpoint of our life where we made mistakes I I know a a brother awesome wonderful brother amen when the more I got to know him he started telling me about all the false doctrine that he had got his family in and all the issue that had been there and I said well okay brother it was just inspiration the Lord speaking I said brother but where's your family now he said every one of my family is serving God Amen in truth today I said then don't look at the middle of that field don't look at it when you were 30 years old not really serving God like you should have been and your your you know son is is uh you know just following in Dad's footsteps right amen need need him following dad's footsteps now that's right amen right so what did he do he come he come right down to our level stepped right in there and said you know what I'm going to come and in fact I'm going to come in such a fashion that the world's going to call me illegitimate I'm going to lower myself so low that the identity associated with my name is illegitimate wow that's pretty low but I'll tell you pardon me I wouldn't want to offend anybody but he's come in this hour right here of what they said was illegitimate is proving to be God's work right amen it's not man's works it's not what kind of pedigree that we can put amen but it's whether the Life of Christ is in the man amen that's right amen and if the life is in the man it don't matter what he has where he's been who he knows cuz he knows him that's it that's right amen so what's he doing almighty God came down to our level to woo us to come to his that's it that's don't stay where you're at no let me show you amen where I came from amen that's where you belong that's right he wants to lift us up to his level amen Heavenly places in Christ Jesus many have been there amen I hope every hand in this building would go up that we could say I've been in Heavenly places I have had Jesus Christ standing right with me he's been with me in the morning the noon the evening the Midnight Hour he's with me I've been in his presence he's been here with me yes sir amen that's his level that's it where's our level I'll tell you what he'll take you places that legalism will never take you amen you can be a Pharisee you can stand and say I've done all of the law it did the Rich Young Ruler not one bit of good that he had followed everything perfectly his heart was not in it amen he was unable to press out of his own place his own position to press out of that and say I'll claim that out there it's the unknown amen it's the unknown my brother and sister amen until a man has ever been there amen look prayer line people coming you notice that they get to a certain place they didn't just walk right up they got to a certain place oh they were being respectful no there was a presence there it was unknown to them they were nervous about that presence it won't harm you that's right that's right come into that presence step Across the Threshold of your own life and your own inhibition it won't hurt you well I believe but I've never been in that presence then quit stopping amen keep walking and walk right into that presence there's nothing there saying don't come any closer he amen amen legalism the law can ever take you there there no that's why we got to be real careful when the spirit of legalism starts to show up now you got to get this right you got to hit that Mark you got to hit this you got to hit that you got to hit that I I've told y all about this before and I hope you catch the analogy of it amen we went to Sun Lakes many years ago amen it was brother Jason's fault that I even got a hold of a golf club and went out there on the course with them you know kind of like you guys know brother Jason H not quite the way the story is but it's the way I like to tell it amen and brother Jason's like you know if you're not a chicken you you'll just get a hold to one of these and you'll do so I'm out there you know and these brothers some of them you know they they go all fairly regular pray for them but they're you know they're standing there and I'm like okay I was I said I'll be the last that's fine and these brothers some of them you know just wow another one big curve but it comes right back lands with in and here's Paul and they're all like Paul you're natural thank you until about the ninth hold brother Jason looks at me and goes you're going to break your wrist like that you are holding the club you got the wrong hand on the top and wrong one on the bottom and your wrist turned like that you're going to bust your wrist this is how you do it oh I want to do it right wait we already played the fourth hole and no matter how hard I tried to hit the ball correctly there way I hope you follow me their way finally we got down the last couple holes on the golf course and I said Brothers I'm rebelling I got a hold the club there said yeah you'll break your wrist that's what the every uh uh teacher whatever tell you you're going to break your wrist swinging like that and I said well it hasn't broken yet and I got a hold of that yeah you know wrong hand forward you know and the breaking of the wrist it the last two holes all the rest of their balls had drifted off a little bit mine went right down see this proves I'm right and you're wrong what did it prove nothing nothing because there comes a lesson when we serve God our way that you can't go any further amen the brothers one of them pointed it out to me I respect the brother he said brother Paul you have to realize you're hitting it all the way to the green but this is like a little mini course you know these these half the distance and you'll never hit it the full distance holding it like that because you can't put enough power in it you know what I did I gave up golf forever right at that moment and that's what happens when people can't come over find overcoming power because they're trying to move forward their own way and they won't wait and learn those that wait upon the Lord amen they won't wait they won't learn and they get to a certain point and they say you know what I just can't overcome this well quit doing it your way let God do it his way Hallelujah now I'm way off time here way off time amen so look at this let's look for just a moment let me hurry through this look for how he come down for you and I an eternal God now down at our level amen that in itself is incredible amen that an eternal God would care enough about you and I that he would leave the ramparts of heaven where all heaven and all Earth actually worshiped him and he would come down and SLO through the dust of Nazareth amen the road to emus and slog where animals had been you understand what I'm saying there's nothing pretty about this amen so he came to our level and what's even greater than that is he cares about your infirmity that's it the devil would like you to believe that well that's just how it is amen I'm telling you I'm sorry I don't want embarrass anybody but whether it's a struggle of the heart and of the mind my brother and sister it's just the word that fixes the problem amen it's not us we cannot do one people say well why don't you just change my brother and sister until you've been there you won't don't know the battle that's being faced and how in the human element it's impossible to change but when you ever get in the presence of almighty God Amen now look I want to hurry here he was dealing with our infirmities he felt our infirmities he's dealing with our humanness amen eternal life Christ himself bringing the hidden truth from the word amen right here's Jesus bring Eternal truth extracting it is it okay amen extracting it out of the word and here's the apostles I'm a better preacher than you there's more hits on my sermons on the internet than yours amen I've been invited to more churches than you I I'm the greater of the Apostles really the King of Kings is over here extracting the gold of the word amen and we're here worried about who's the greater amongst us amen Lord help us amen all I can say is is Lord help us amen we're nothing but specs in the kingdom of God that's exactly right Hallelujah let's look for a moment just how he came to us so it's there that he come and this man that changed our lives Chang the world in John 4: 6 and 7 we know the scripture so well now Jacob's Well was there and Jesus there for being wearied with his journey set thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour and there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus saith unto her give me to drink your savior yeah come down so low he's weary and he's thirsty reminds me of my work day your work day yeah come down he said I'm going to be like you amen amen now let's jump CU I I kind of wasted it's not waste forgive me but I used time amen let's go to Matthew 4 now as we look at Matthew 4 here he is hungry then was Jesus led up the spirit to the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil but when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward hungry hunger now I I say this if you don't mind me putting a little humor this is a hard one for me because I'm hungry about every four hours forget 40 days and 40 nights just four hours but he went out there not to prove he could fast for 40 days and 40 nights he went out there to come back that I yes I'm going to be selfish here that I would realize it's not the natural it's not these things he fasted 40 days and 40 night and when the tempter come un him he said if thou be the Son of God command these Stones be made bread how many times in our I'm going to say frustrations have we misused the word of God misused the power of God misused the intent of God but here he is what's he doing he's showing us in a time of Hunger frustrations and whatever that's the time to go back to the word amen not to go to Natural not to look to Natural not to try and satisfy it with natural but he says the answer is it written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God but here again it shows our lord Jesus loved us so much amen that he suffered a hunger that we may never some of you may have but many of us will never fast 40 days and 40 nights now we come down here and this is a little bit uh of the same we're back into John 46 and 7 and as we look at this my brother and sister uh it's there that we'll see in John 46 and 7 same as it was there about being weary uh being thirsty we see John 19 and 28-30 and Jesus knowing that all things now now I want you to catch a correlation between these two uh and Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled said I thirst The Thirst he experienced on the cross let's just look at it for natural for a moment so much more severe than even the thirst after traveling and is sitting there at the well I thirst I hope you catch this we got to separate natural I'm not talking about just a glass of water no that's right we got to separate natural amen from a thirst of the Soul that's right amen and when the soul is thirsting don't satisfy it with something else that's exactly let it be satisfied by the presence of almighty God and I tell you I'm one of those guys forgive me but there's times I have tried to satisfy natural I mean spirit spiritual with natural that's right H right amen amen I'm not ashamed to admit it no now we go to Matthew 4 1-3 and so here again my brother and sister this is not about thirst or hunger about Temptation that's right so these kind of all tied together just Temptation the devil knows you better than you know yourself am imagine how awkward it be if each one of you in appropriate fashion I just followed you around all the time until I had your life categorized on a stressful Tuesday at work what will they do they'll run out turn right go half a block to the burrito wagon they'll get a burrito they'll tell you'll tell yourself this thing's disgusting but I'm hungry you go back in your office at 4:00 you'll take a Tums and at 5:00 you'll say ah I'm done and get up and go and drive aggressively all the way home you wouldn't want me to share everybody that kind of a story of your life how do you know this cuz I watched you yeah I tell you what I like brother Donnie Reagan's approach I want to live such a life that when I throw the covers back in the morning and put my feet on the floor the devil's going no he's [Applause] awake help us send reinforcements instead oh this could be humorous if we could just carry this out instead we roll our feet out of bed and put them on the floor oh no it's going to be another horrible day Lord help me to survive through this day let's forget about being Victorious just let me be a Survivor and all them demons were like hey you know we almost got him down let's call for reinforcements but not the kind that we have to send over to that Donnie guy's house we don't want guys that are showing up here with all kinds of armor we want guys that are just aggressive they'll toss the armor down we're going to run this guy in the ground today car won't start no no no no I had that wrong I read a little deal about this it's pretty funny I wish I could find it it all starts you get out of bed you go downstairs almost fall down the stairs you go in the kitchen you put the button on the coffee machine it won't grind the beans and then you remember you bought the wrong kind of beans oh then you have to do this and you do that and you finally go out and you get in the car and the car won't start and then you're walking to the bus stop going to ride the city bus and you realize the bus is pulling up and you have to run the last two blocks and you get to theice office and the B boss said this is the fourth time this week you've been late what's going on it's my car buy a battery yeah um look I yeah anyway come on my brother and sister who are we who are we cuz I want to take you back I'm off track here but that's all right we're not derailed we just took a different track one thing that strikes me I'm reading a book about about job tried like gold and the author of it makes this point all is going wrong and job worshiped amen everything seems to be at a kelter and job worshiped they accused job and job worshiped come on Saints the very God that is in job amen not was in job amen still in job the very God that was in is in job is in you and I in the time I told sister Jerry when I rode that read that portion of it I said I got something to read to you Jerry but I said please don't jump all over me and she's like what and I said here and I read it to her and she goes oh I get it every trial job worshiped spare me from naming all your names but in your trial did you worship amen Matthew 16:2 24-28 I'm going to bounce through it real fast here and Jesus said to his disciples any man will come after me let him deny himself this is about suffering right and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life from for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited if he should gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his Works verily I say unto you there shall be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom amen now my brother and sister you say what's that scripture got to do with suffering because if you truly die to yourself to serve the Lord Jesus Christ you are going to suffer amen is this suffering worth the gain you bet yes or would we rather have a more pacifistic religion devil if you don't fight me I won't fight you you can make that compromise and obedience we talked about this in young adults this morning Hebrews [Music] 58-14 though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered how are you going to learn obedience reading a self-help book no sir no my brother and sister no it it takes obedience amen and being made perfect it became the author of The Eternal salvation to all them that here again acknowledge he exists no obey him amen called of God and high priest after the order of mzd of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered saying you're all dull hearing wow my my brother and sister you could offend so many people in so many churches you're dull you can't hear a thing but what forget about what man would say what does the word say that's right the word says they're Dole of hearing and sometimes we are too I want to balance that for when the time you ought to be teachers you have need for one to teach you again what be the first principles of the Oracles of God and have become such as we have need of milk and not of strong meat come on let's take it back to the Natural for a minute you go into a restaurant you order a nice big old steak who's my guinea pig Titus front row ready volunteered front ranks always r at the front of the charge into the enemy that's the guys who sit at the front so we all I know there's only so many seats on the front row but if you really want to show everybody who you are you get on the front front row and tell him I'll be the first in the battle anyway imagine brother Titus and I go to a restaurant brother Titus I know he doesn't really like steak but um it just yeah so but um he orders a steak the waitress says how do you want this he says I want it just like this this and this do you want mushrooms yeah go ahead and put some mushrooms on it how do you want that okay about 15 minutes later 20 minutes later waitress comes with this gigantic glass of milk walks away uh I didn't order that oh sir the reason you got that is we determined that you're not mature enough to eat that steak you imagine how In the Flesh that people would be so offended oh yes they would be livid how dare you determine I'm not mature enough to eat that steak do you realize down in many hearts they're exactly the same way when it comes to that spiritual meat right I've been a Christian for 40 years how dare you say that this steak this meat is too much for me but when it's not the preacher judging it's God judging God says no you're not mature enough to handle this you're an immature Christian I don't care how many years you've went to church how many plaques you got for perfect attendance how many committees and boards and councils that you have set on you're immature that's right and it's there by the display of behavior yes sir the immaturity but you see my brother and sister you take the bride of Christ amen she has got that eagle anointing amen amen and she will dig in and she will fight for it amen hallelujah now I hope you don't mind I need to kind of skip over a couple other things here just a few more quotes and a few more scriptures seven Church ages brother Brown says here a quick look of these scriptures involve the Lord Jesus Christ overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition Matthew 4 wherein Jesus was tempted of the devil to overcome personal Temptation Of Satan by the word and by the word only amen right that's right back to the scripture right he didn't go quoting something else out of somebody else's book he took him back to the word amen in each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly with the to the Temptation Of The Garden of Eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and pride of life Jesus overcome by the word eve fell to uh to the personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word Adam fail in direct Disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say this is the only way to be an overcomer also it's the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because the word Can't Fail amen amen what an assurance it's not going to be based on my pastor told me you know uh you know depart from me but my pastor said no my brother and sister when you put it back to the word and it's the word that gives direction to your life amen amen hallelujah now notice again how Jesus overcame the world's system of religion when he was repeatedly badgered by the theologians of his day he constantly applied the word he spake only what the father gave him to speak there was not a Time time when the world was not utterly confused by his wisdom for it was the wisdom of God Amen now you look at this this is where God sent Jesus Christ down for you and I in such a fashion that instead of just telling us it can be done he showed us how that's what's important that we actually now know how amen now I don't want to Badger you I don't want to bully you I don't want to be but my brother and sister don't go whining if you don't have God in your life that's it he has showed you amen it's here it's in his word amen if the devil is beating you up now I know we're all Christians here so the devil never beats any of us up except for this morning and maybe by this afternoon come on let's be realistic let's be realistic I'm glad that spiritual black eyes don't show up because I'd sure hate to stand up here and preach to you and everybody be like wow Paul's got shiners my brother and sister but what happens this is part of the whole process going back God allows you you know as it is the boxer the guy there you know and they're doing their things have you ever boxed I have okay I don't want to use you because I don't want a shiner brother Andrew you ever boxed oh you and I are on the same page amen so you you see these guys they looking at each other and they're doing this and you know somebody in the crowd's like hit him cuz they're just you know why they got no confidence me and brother Trevor he'd be like brother Paul you're my pastor I love you pow I'd be like what was that brother Trevor man what did you pow pow pow oh but no we're out there with the devil now look if you don't hurt me I won't hurt you well the devil's not afraid he knows you can't hurt him unless you got the word that's it and when you got the word he'd rather just say I'll give up I go I was boxing with a friend one time I actually have messed around with that a little bit but this brother this playing around he didn't hurt me too bad he's just playing around and he was saying you know brother Paul what it is is you have to do this often enough until your hand already knows what your brain is going to tell it I'm like novel thought that your hand could already know what your brain's going to tell it then we had a lovely spiritual conversation and he says you have a trial you have a struggle and when you in your body in your mind your spirit your soul already know what the word has told it to do you don't have to try and figure out what will I do that's right what will I do the devil's howling on my doorstep what do I do what you do is you take the word and you defeat the Devil every time I'm going to cut this off I literally had way more stuff than I thought I did here I still got probably 30 minutes so amen praise the Lord yes yes that was meant to be that was meant to be the save me uh look yeah amen I just want to read the last quote I'll skip over my notes here the last quote I has was the unveiling of God now to catch the full context you'd need to go back and look at it notice veiled in a human flesh Moses was that word speaking what was to be later put behind the badger skin so that so Christ is our Moses Christ is our Moses he was God veiled in human flesh veiled in humanity in flesh that's right he's the same yesterday today and forever he was veiled by Badger skins he was veiled and this time he was veiled in a man see now notice the same yesterday today and forever promised his word to this age he is still Christ The Promised word to this age veiled in human flesh amen the word is God amen amen what flesh is he veiled in today Saints Hallelujah God hiding himself amen we're not having to go find no insult to the pope but we don't need to go find us a pope we don't need to go find us a great man because God said I'll be with you even in you amen and I recognize I am the you knew that he was talking about can you say Amen to that and when God deals with us Satan's on the other side the counterpart saying remember your mistake remember the failure remember the shortcoming remember your weaknesses remember the besetting sin but I'll tell you what I do is I remember that the word's in me amen it might take me a little bit might take me a little bit might take me coming across the quotation I need to show to my wife yeah yeah I want to share one last thing maybe you'll find humor in it I don't mean it to be a joke but Luther by things he was criticized and friends that abandoned him come to a stage in his life that he got so low so depressed that he just staggered about and his dear wife said you know I see my husband's distress Lord how do I help him how do I what Can I Do Lord inspiration come to her when Luther come into the house that day she was dressed in black from head to foot and he looks at her and says who [Music] died and her response was God and he said what yeah you're walking around here acting as though God died it was sufficient to change Luther's Outlook I showed that to Sister Jerry and I was like I have just opened a giant AB balb here that is she's going to but you see Saints when we get to the place that every bit of Victory promised to the believer every bit of Life promised to the believer and we stay in our woe wowy woo [Music] thing we're basically telling God that's it you're dead to my circumstance that's not us Saints right amen amen that's not us amen let's go back to the word and realize that in the humanity of Christ he experienced it so that you would know how to overcome it amen amen amen are we Overcomers amen hallelujah I am an overcomer amen hallelujah hallelujah amen amen I don't have a page number but that um he became me [Music] hallelujah it's a key of blank d he became me let's just stand Saints Worship the Lord for a minute become here my [Music] gra he became me so that I might

morning could we say that's a blessing amen that God would come in such a fashion that he would take everything that we had amen would take it into himself amen and then let us be Sons and Daughters of God everything I I left out another portion of what kind only the bride sits on the throne with the King he doesn't share his throne with anyone amen we just was invited actually a long time ago
