trust any true child of god that is their desire as well as to truly surrender all amen it's a perfect song to go into what we're speaking this morning so believe that that was the leadership of the holy spirit and why don't we stand and turn in our bibles thank our pastor for his confidence while he's a way to allow me to speak to the sheep here trust the lord will speak to your heart as he has spoken to mine and trusting he'll speak to me even more this morning as a preacher you get you get you get into double dip you get it when you study it and you get it when you preach it praise the lord amen matthew chapter 1 verse 18 i ask you to turn your bibles but i didn't tell you where to turn to sorry matthew chapter 1 verse 18. amen now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privily but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name immanuel which being interpreted is god with us then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord had bitten him and took unto him his wife and he and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name jesus isaiah 7 14. can we maybe turn this monitor down just a tad bit here thank you isaiah 7 14. okay isaiah 7 14 therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel that's bar heads heavenly father lord jesus we thank you for this opportunity this morning to get to hear from you lord it's it's a privilege lord many people call themselves christians yet this morning all they'll hear is the thoughts and ideas of a man but lord you have so called and so foreordained us in this position that we get to hear from you lord i give myself to you and i ask that none of my thoughts none of my opinions would come across the desk this morning but father it would be strictly and totally you lord i just surrender to you each one i pray would do the same this morning that father even lord jesus would they hear something they hadn't understood before they would be open lord jesus that father you could deal with their hearts lord jesus knowing all things are done for the glory of god we commit these words into your hands and pray that you just speak to our hearts this morning be with our pastor eyes he's away may he be refreshed lord in his time lord and once again we remember sister conscious tomorrow thank you lord commit all these things into your hands in jesus name we pray amen you may be seated praise the lord so my title this morning is the unconventional can you put that up there because i don't it's a mouthful the unconventional uninhibited shameless will of god amen deuteronomy 23 2 says the bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the lord even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the lord so we just read here about mary and she becomes with child of the holy ghost and uh mary was pregnant as a virgin to the world it was an illegitimate child that's why i read you this scripture here so there's a scripture in isaiah that says the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive there's a scripture that says the bastard child it's not entered into the congregation of the lord even to his tenth generation so the jews and the israelites of that day all they saw was this girl who is pregnant out of wedlock even though there was scripture to back it up and joseph a holy man at this direct descendant of david it wasn't just that you know joseph have one time did his genealogy he said oh i'm a descendant of david no the jews and the israelites knew who they were where they came from all of that was carefully recorded and there was a status behind that this joseph was a well-respected man partly because of his lineage i'm sure and considered a had a having a voice at the gate if you will in a seat at the gate and he was a holy man he knew the scriptures but even him who knew the scripture was minded to put away mary she had given her testimony and angel came down and spoke to me and said i would be conceived with child and this would be that child of the holy ghost the messiah and they had scriptures to back that up but there was also scripture about bastard children and the fact that any child born out of wedlock was not of god and so here's joseph perhaps wrestling with this and it's funny sometimes you know we we face situations and this is just not so much in my notes we face situations and we try to figure it out on our own without going back to the word and then you know as humans you know we fight ourselves and then one day we oh yeah open up the word and there's the answer right there but sometimes you can read it and not even see it and joseph had read it isaiah was a prophet they had the scroll there i'm sure it was heard in the synagogue and yet even he didn't have a grasp of what was going on because let me ask you if a girl came up to you and told you that how much would you believe it you say well there was a scripture no no no here we have joseph right here no different than you so would you accept it that's right people say oh you know if i was back in the time of jesus i would have been a disciple are you one today it's no different you're looking to the past when it for them it was the present we're looking to to to they were they were they were looking to their past and their future but see this is one thing that i've learned in my few years i've been on earth i never say never and i don't ever say i guess you could say forever i don't know what god's going to do i want to keep my thoughts open i don't want to i don't want to say this is my future and create a box that god can't get into that god i want to be here with you all for the rest of my life but i don't know what god hasn't planned so i say i'm here now because it's the will of god who knows otherwise when god comes knocking on your door and says hey moved in the middle of nowhere west africa siberia russia you're willing and open to that to give it some thought sometimes god's will is that absurd and if we're not careful as human beings we we create this little world around us that god can't penetrate the jews had created this world around them of their traditions of their prophet moses they had this this this whole idea figured out what the future was going to be oh they prayed for the coming messiah but when he came it wasn't how they thought it was going to be so they conjured up a future event this is going to be the coming of the messiah yet it was directly contrary to the word so you can you can look to your future and you can have an idea of what it's going to be but make sure that idea lines up with the word of god you have something you want to do brother manass is going to college we have a sister here who just graduated they have an idea you have an idea of what your future is going to be but don't ever think because of what you've done up to this point determines what your future is going to be you serve god you say god you listen god can call you see okay before i became a software engineer i was a carpenter for uh 10 years or so and i was in the carpenters union and i went to the carpentry the school there prior to that i already had the knowledge but that was the way into the union and i learned a great deal and i can look at that and say that was wasted time because i don't even do that anymore but that's not the truth god can send you to college for four to eight years to four years just to maybe get uh a degree in business and then take you to the middle of timbuktu and have you pastor a church for the rest of your life was those four years a waste of time no because god puts you in that spot to either be a witness or to teach you important life lessons that's what happens when we limit a limitless god we try to we try to put him we he created us yet we think we have control over him how absurd is that if i say i i oh i don't know yeah if i can't come out it's like you know forgive me if i get too secular but these are stories of robots taking over the world you create they created the robots and the robots decided to take control of them we know that's not going to happen it's but that's what you try to do with and you can't do it you can't do it all you're going to do is make your life miserable but we're humans and so we do it that's why this morning the lord is reminding us that sometimes his will is unconventional but although it's unconventional the will of god is uninhibited and it's shameless you say shameless mary was pregnant and she wasn't married shameless is the will of god through the eyes of the word not the eyes of man man said joseph and mary what a shame so he knew the scripture and he didn't have a revelation of it a messenger had to come to him in the night and speak to him and god had to give him a revelation there is the devil has a perversion for everything god has set in place there is false revelation you know the best way to tell if revelation is false but why is it that there is so much lack of revelation a false revelation you can show them the scripture and they won't understand it does that does that stop you from witnessing no no no no it should say thank you lord for your grace that i can see your willet in the word so this was a scandal okay this is a small church talk travels fast even in a big church it does you're talking about a village of what 400 2 000 people i don't know bethlehem joseph was a respected man everybody knew joseph yeah i'm not i i'm taking some liberty when i say that but let's let's just look at take a dose of reality this is a small town and he was a respected man no doubt many of the old women were trying to get him married off because here he is he was a lot older than mary you know past the normal married marriage age how any girl that gets joseph you know she's going to be well taken care of and so joseph and this is the funny thing about people about humanity joseph begins to talk to mary and everyone's like oh there he goes isn't it sweet you know that mary is such a good girl just love her and joseph man he he couldn't do no better then mary goes off to collect some herbs in the forest and she comes back and she saw an angel and she's pregnant and then the talk they become the talk attack of the town over dinner and in the the corners of the coffee shop we always knew mary was trouble isn't that humanity works it's not joseph's fault so you know jose i told joseph don't get mixed up with that pretty little lady she's got that wild stare in her eye but we knew mary was trouble you just said she was the best girl for joseph two weeks ago or a couple of months i don't know how long it took for it to get around a girl pregnant outside of marriage brought forth the true vindicated word now joseph's stuck with a problem he loves mary he loved her he believed she was better than this so he says you know what i can't stone her i'll just secretly put her over then god comes to him in a dream and we know the rest of the story but imagine yourself as joseph you know people are coming up joseph it says in the word you need to stone her come on man do what you're supposed to do pressure you think you have pressure no not to invalidate your pressure we you go through but you understand the situation he's in you say well it's easy the scripture says it joseph was no different than you what is it today you're facing what what is your mary is your mary in the your your life right now that god is trying to say this and this and this but all you can see is your preconceived ideas this is man's ideas versus gods man would have a much better plan right if it was up to man jesus would have been coming from a staunch jewish home baked into the temple politics you know they would know who's who and what's what schooled under the high priest starting a ministry with the blessing of the high priest and then one day there's just moving in the temple and everyone says this is the messiah perhaps that was how they thought it was but that was man's idea because man see the man likes it all pretty and clean but god likes to cause major disruptions why to get us to realize that well nothing is impossible for god to get us to to to look past what somebody might look like now and see that see a god within them that just needs a little bit of nurturing if everything was pretty and clean where would that leave everyone in the highways in the byways where would that leave a lot of us that's a funny thing right god save someone brings them out of the muck they get in a church they get the wrong spirit and now they're looking down their nose at everyone else forgetting they were at one time no difference god help us to never forget god's grace in our life because guess what will happen god will put you flat on your nose praise the lord so but instead of this this great this great uh young man being raised in the temple all this stuff that they had the ideas of coming down on a white cloud whatever they had the idea instead of their idea you end up with a girl from the village who's pregnant out of wedlock and this this is their words this bastard child is supposed to be the word but the bible says in abraham's grace covenant he says when god represented himself he represented himself from a heaven a bird the meekest of all the birds the dove and god in the holy ghost is itself same-self person if it didn't jesus had two fathers in matthew 1 18 said that which is conceived in thee is of the holy ghost he wasn't a bastard child he was wholly born of god so he was the son of god that's right so the natural eye says he was an illegitimate child but he wasn't and there was scripture to back it up he said well there was scripture to back it up otherwise see sometimes people can can look at the word of god and if they don't look at the word of god through the eyes of faith it can seem to contradict itself yet god said a virgin shall conceive for us we look back and say well it's that's obvious it's laid out in the word but what was the problem these the jews the christians they weren't christians they were jews i'm going to blend these two examples together the other christians around it had closed off their minds their hearts to any teaching they had their hand selected scriptures and quotes that supported their thesis and they didn't bother to say emma they they were they were full of pride that's what it was they were full of pride and it goes directly in in the natural types directly you meet somebody you can't tell them nothing they know it all you can't tell you can't teach them anything how far do those people like that people like that go only as far as what they know which a lot of times isn't very far so the same thing in the spiritual if we close off if we you know this goes right back to to camping down on something right well what is we're not called to camp down we're called to move the people of god were were nomads they raised their sheep they moved and that directly ties into us as a spiritual we're called to keep moving forward why do you think footsteps is possession what is that what do what how do you get footsteps you walk you move you can't get footsteps if you're standing in one spot and so god is calling us to move but what happens is is something comes along and we hear something and we stop and we camp down and we think it's because it's because humans are finite forgive me if i can mix the words up but god is infinite so with with our in the way we're our nature the flesh man is is limited there's beginning and there's ending and there's arriving so we think if we're not careful sometimes around the message that one day we're going to arrive we'll never need to go to the altar again we'll never need to apologize for anything because we have arrived you are never going to arrive until you walking the streets of gold and then guess what for eternity eternity you're going to be learning about god it never ever stops it can't stop because god is eternal but we're non-eternal we're finite so we don't we we try to say you know it's it's how i don't know maybe i'm funny like this but if i'll sit down i don't know if you've done this before and i'll try to think about what it is to be eat forever and ever and ever and ever and ever eternally it's kind of a little bit unnerving if i'm being perfectly honest but that's because my flesh knows nothing that is eternal everything in our life has a beginning and an end this bottle had to be had a beginning and it was full of water by town i'm preaching there will be no more water the water ended right this sermon will end this day will end the service will end our lives will end amen our flesh will end our spirits will not and so what happens is we need we need to have something this the flesh needs something to uh an arrival point an ending point and if we're not careful and that happens because i know there's times in our lives where we're we're where we struggle with this then there's times where we don't but the true word of god is going to unfold it so i'm addressing if you will those people not you but like you sorry i had to steal that it's just really good um i'm talking about years refusing to grow because it's right here they've got it they're there preachers can come and preach the word of god can be played and heard but there is no growth well a lot of times it's because there's sin unconfessed undealt with sin so here here here it is that these this this scandal has happened sometimes i jam jump back a little bit just to get back where i was so that tangent that one was free um so yet the will of god is unconventional i venture to say pretty much every time it's unconventional it's never exactly how we thought it was going to be but what is it it's uninhibited joseph and mary took him to the temple to be circumcised a bastard child in the temple right i don't know if there was anybody there that day who knew them but i'm sure it word got around that they took him there how dare they they're contradicting the word yet they were fulfilling the word to a t do you see it do you see it they weren't looking at it through the eyes of faith and revelation they were looking it through the eyes of their traditions you get camped down on tradition god is going to come along and disrupt your life i can say that because it happened to me i had my future figured out and then god did a mic drop on my life and i was left with a choice accept it because it lined up with the word i sat down i listed it out pros and cons pros list was like this long and cons this was about that long that tells me something does it go against the word of god no then why are so many people so vehemently against it see what what is this what is it what does it mean to be uninhibited expressing one's feelings or thoughts on self-consciously and without restraint in other words acting upon the will of god without restraint regardless of everyone else's opinion you cannot stand upon a man's opinion of the word you have to stand upon god's revelation of the word otherwise you can find your life to a box a man-made box notice god created the universe and it's a it's a continuum a continuum man-made boxes our houses are square our roads are square right yet the world is round because there is no ending that's right there's no ending there's no there's no yeah praise the lord everything that god does can continue amen but man can't do that they try i remember recently reading an article they buried this clock in california somewhere so that in you know the apocalypse and everything else whoever that's alive then can dig up this clock and know exactly what time it is that's the gist of it i don't know maybe something here's red and that's not exactly what it was about but why joseph and mary found their position on the word by divine revelation and stood upon it nobody can talk you out of a revelation from god you cannot restrain the moving of god if you fight against the moving of god god is gracious and if you're a child of god he will come back around to you but if you fight against the moving of god you will be left behind [Music] that's straight but that's the truth but god is gracious and sometimes without realizing it our lives are within the permissive will of god but god will come back around and say okay last time we did this this is what happened let's try that again because god is a god of grace and understanding and as long as you're a child of god you will come to that understanding that what they stood upon joseph and mary with their child it was lined up 100 with the word because though the natural eye said he was a bastard child he wasn't right so they weren't bringing a bastard child into the temple you have to find your place in the word and stand upon it brother chris you just told us we can't stand we have to move when you stand upon relation in the word it is through that standing to say that word we use is is a is a type right it's the path you're walking on your feet are firmly planted on the word and you're moving forward with god praise the lord the will of god is uninhibited you can't stop it you can't stop the moving of god the will of god is shameless no fault to be found in the will of god from the word oh there's plenty of faults to be found if you're looking through the eye of man looking at the life of brother branham there's faults to be found where was the crack up with all of that i believe the science stuff looking through the eyes of man looking at man that's all it was because if you don't find a place to stand upon a revelation of the word it doesn't matter someone will come along and convince you otherwise but that's not our topic this morning our topic is the unconventional uninhibited shameless will of god i want my desire this morning for myself as well as lord what in what are you trying to if you're trying to tell me something right now and i'm missing it what is it don't let me build a box around my religion don't let me build a box around my life totally build a box around my future that's right what i do on the daily basis lord a.m am i open enough to hear that rustling in mulberry trees i say i'm praying for the will of god and i'm looking for the will of god but am i looking in only the places i want to look or am i saying lord even direct my eyes even direct my heart to the right place to look that's right even show me am i am i missing something is there is there something you're you're saying or where you're standing here and i'm saying give me your will give me your will but i'm only turning my head this much help me to see full circle lord help me to look around you you know you go you ever go you go hunting sometimes if you don't keep looking all around you we were hunting one time and um up right on the border of the denali national park and we were sitting on this hill and we had been glassing for hours but only into this one draw so i was tired of sitting i got up and i walked to the other side of the mountain and there was a moose if we didn't get up and look on both sides we would have missed that moose but sees as you get up and you go and you look right sometimes you can get so focused on one area of your life god's over here going hey hello look over here and you're going i don't see you lord i don't hear you lord that's right are we plugging our ears praise the lord don't resent that the truth amen if you're resenting it there might be something deeper within you fighting against that no fault to be found with the will of god the natural eyes saw shame in joseph and mary's union yet based on the word it was shameless for however long they were in bethlehem for the rest of their lives joseph and mary were marked amen joseph gave up his seat the gate his respect what respect is there if a man can't stand upon these convictions of his revelation in the word of god i don't care what man calls respect oh we respect him why because his bank account has six figures why because because he's you know has a porsche or a mercedes or or why because because he's you know this pastor's son or or he's gone on the mission fields i don't care what he's done if he's wrong he's wrong and we will be wrong i'm going to i will be wrong as hard as it is to imagine just kidding i've been corrected and if i can't accept correction i have no business standing behind this pulpit god help me god help us we have no right if we can't be willing to say i was wrong or i am wrong help me lord to understand better because as soon as you lose the ability to admit you are wrong you lose the ability to learn anymore because to learn more is to say what you knew wasn't sufficient enough was was wrong or you were wrong you have to be willing to admit you were wrong in order for there to be growth there's a concept in the in the world the secular world about mindset having the right mindset people can have the mindset of you know my family was plumbers for four generations so i have to be a plumber or they have a mindset of i can't do that because i'm not smart enough without ever giving it a try that's a secular world so in the spiritual world do you have the mindset that you're a child of god that literally anything is possible with god that there is nothing impossible for you through god do you have the right the right are you thinking about yourself the right way are you accepting god's word for who you are or are you accepting the devil's version of who he wants you to be see you can't deny that see gene of god within you so start living your life like you are a child of the king because you are praise god so don't amen the word of god the will of god is shameless people might disagree with it but if you if you find god gives you that revelation of what it is it's the big topic right now and i i don't even like to bring it up um preachers versus no preachers you can't find it in the word of god and if you can't find it in the word of god how can it be the will of god if there's a movement it doesn't matter if there's hundreds of thousands of people in the agreement with it and it has the label of the message on it and it's contrary to the word it's still wrong but if we limit god to a box that's what happens because what is that box it's man's ideas praise the praise the lord so in your life in in in what you do in your spiritual walk have you shut off the fountain see it's ended have you shut off the fountain or is god still able to move in your heart if you say oh i've arrived i figured it out there's a stigmatism where if you come to the altar for prayer you're not a you're you're you're not a grown christian that's not true who was the first one of the to the to the altar when brother brown had his meetings a lot of times it was him are we he was preaching sorry if excuse me if he was in the congregation and there was not the car he said he's one of the first ones there do i need to hear that so that i can come to the altar no the word of god says he loves a broken and contrite spirit that doesn't mean that scripture doesn't mean you have to be strung out on drugs in sin unconverted no that means maybe you just spoke harshly to someone and you're here asking for forgiveness because you're soft towards the things of god it's uh scientifically proven i guess or an agreed idea but it's actually proven that if people don't do new things as they get older their ideas and things get set in stone and they're not willing to learn anything else so you have to actually you have to actually as a as in the world that we live in as a person you have to actively continue to learn or you'll just get set in stone and nobody can teach you anything it's like that old saying you can't teach an old dog new tricks you can if that old dog keeps is willing to keep learning throughout his life so take that as a tidbit for the world we live in keep learning doesn't matter what it is just keep learning and the same with the spirit of god keep learning keep asking yourself lord is there something more i need to learn because guess what the answer is yes there's always more to learn and it is what i'm doing now still your will that's it god can call you to go to like going back to go to college to get a degree as a doctor and you think because he did that he wants you to be a doctor but that's not necessarily true so you get out of call and you go yep god paved the way he called me to go to school to be a doctor so i'm going to be a doctor and you push and you push and you push and you become a doctor and you're no longer in the will of god this is just an example so god starts you off on a path but keep asking yourself as you're walking lord am i still in your will am i still in your will is this still what you want me to do am i still doing what you've called me to do and sometimes he calls us to go do things for a short amount of time and then we go back to what it was we were doing before we think oh we wasted all that time but god says no no i was teaching you an important lesson maybe simply to show you the wonders of life praise the lord how good it is to hug your kids every evening don't become so set in stone god can't teach you anything there's only one one rock we want to become like and that's jesus christ you know what happens if you get concrete pour on your feet and it dries you don't go anywhere ask god to broaden your horizons that's a that's a favorite cliche in the secular world gotta broaden your horizons you know people i heard i said one time about christians and i'm sure it included us because we're in a cult but um you know don't don't let your don't don't follow religion in a bathtub or something like that in other words it's constrained to this one thing you're gonna you've gotta broaden your horizons what they're saying is you gotta accept everything false or true but that's not what i'm saying this morning when i say broaden your horizons i mean say for example i read through the song with solomon then that's like a book no one talks about but if it's in here there's a point so i said lord i don't understand what i'm reading but there's it's in the bible so it's important it's got something to say you notice it's like oh lamentation or lamentations leviticus those the books of the law you know most times your devotions you're over here in the new testament and there's nothing wrong with that but if leviticus is in the bible it's there for a reason i don't know what i'm trying to in say words don't brought on your horizons the the entire bible is christ the entire bible is christ every last word of it is nothing but the truth so god can change the way you think and he can change the way someone else thinks so when i say we're talking about so far building a box around your personal life but don't build a box around someone else's life and say they're never gonna change now they've been that way for 30 years laura just just the way it is no it's not god can change we never know who's who in the kingdom of god i don't care what they've done i don't care what they've said about the message i don't none of that matters god can change anybody don't limit a limitless god but brother bible says in 1953 earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the saints if you can limit god you can limit christ and if you limit the church today in its possibilities you're limiting god but all things whatsoever you desire when you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it he said that i believe it and i know it's the truth the trick is you can say you're not limiting god but you can if you have the wrong mindset about your future you can if you have the wrong mindset about what you're experiencing in life and so you're you're saying i'm not limiting god but you're only i keep saying this but you're only looking at this portion instead of the whole big picture this comes to mind someone i know been looking for a place to live and they've been hitting roadblock after roadblock after roadblock but yet they're praying and they're seeking but but but in but but they're not looking past a certain point and i can't go in and tell them this because it takes god to reveal it to them that they're looking and they're and they're pushing and they're searching and i do i know the will of god no i have some ideas that are based on the bible but god is god he does whatever he wants but from the outside looking in i say yes you're looking for the will of god and you're seeking the will of god for your life but what about this over here you haven't even entertained this it's like a job you know someone prays and prays and prays and i'm not telling you to quit your job but for this job to work out and i wish this job worked out and i you know it is it's hindering my family and this job and i just pray lord smooth it out smooth it out smooth it out never ever asking do i need to quit this job and find a different one that's what i'm trying to say when i say broaden your horizons and i'm not telling you to quit your job find one first before you do if you need to change careers praise the lord lord is there something i'm missing that you're trying to tell me but i've confined your will to a box if you aren't careful you'll build a little world around you that stops god from moving remember every single word in the book is truth being open to learning more about god requires that you be open to the possibility that you are wrong amen amen says from that time 1962 he says don't want to hurt your feelings but how can you women sit here and know that the bible tells you that it's wrong forever you to cut your hair that you dish on this excuse me dishonor your husband when you do it you prove yourself as a woman of the street when you do such a thing and because of the angel you should have long hair what angel the angel of the covenant the angel the messenger of the day the seventh angel which is sounding today then still know that you're wrong your adam might might have let you go ahead and act wrong even say it don't make a difference it certainly does make a difference every commandment of god is right eve only turned her just aside for a minute if you're wrong admit you're wrong your own life proves you're wrong now you say oh we know not to cut our hair but here's eve with direct word from god don't talk to that tree but she's over there talking to that tree talking to the serpent and the serpent says well but did he really mean it you say oh that's obvious is it now can i go back and put you in the garden of eden as eve and you still tell me the same thing if you're a child of god with revelation of the word absolutely but what about our day-to-day life what what what are what are we doing that that god is saying and then maybe there's nothing maybe you're within the will of god praise the lord thank god for his grace maybe you're already open to the possibilities whatever in the world god wants you to do praise god keep on doing it amen if not remember that there is nothing on this earth god can't call you to do that's it yeah you know the big one is you know like like it's always easy it's hard but it's always easy for people to say oh yeah i'm called to be a missionary to africa or missionary to the philippines or a missionary to you know some third world country because that's the accepted norm for a missionary what if god is calling you to brooklyn new york are you open to that a possibility brother evonicarian we just pray for his is he sick or his wife he has a church in the bronx i've been there actually by the lord's given the opportunity they most of them live in new jersey and where they live is pretty nice it's it's all big city there but it's i liked it it's nice there's plenty of trees and kind of has a small town feel yet they all drive into new york into the bronx to go to church because he feels led they have money but he feels led to keep his church right there in the bronx and they have some their congregation is lives in the bronx too but their churches and classic new york sandwiched between buildings the next building is this far away it's a storefront you walk in the door and you bump into the first pew the cars in the street are double parked and all the keys are hung on the back hook so the someone because they're below a big apartment complex somebody will come knocking on the door deacons will go okay which car okay and they'll go on move the car so they can get their car out it's not an ideal situation it's absurd it's not pretty it's not nice the church is nice i don't want them to hear this and be like hey it's a nice church great people you're this but why everyone you want to have a nice church you know in this location with the nice building and everything because that's not what god wants him to do that's not what god's called him to do god has called people to have churches in nice locations in nice buildings yes absolutely don't get astigmatism in your head that anything nice is not of god that's not true whatsoever god can bless his people and can live well and be well for your entire life and there's nothing contrary to the will of god with that show me up show me show me in the scripture where it's wrong david had all them wives all that money he's still in the little god solomon same thing but that's where god called brother yvonne karen that's his that's his mission on earth is the bronx not somewhere overseas so is god calling you to you know but see i don't know how to explain this but it's like it's okay to go to the third world country and get your hands dirty but it's not okay in america to get your hands dirty i don't understand that you look past that loser i don't want to say a loser cause that's that's not right forgive me you look past that person who's just a mess i don't know why doesn't that guy get a life you have the perfect life for him why don't you tell him about it i've been praying about this lord help me not to not to go i don't want to touch that have not to help me not to have that attitude it doesn't matter who they are what they are how they smell shake their hand amen tell them god bless you god loves you talk to them i don't care how weird they are or the conversation could be extremely awkward there's a song actually and and it's so called one awkward moment could that one awkward moment spare that person from hellfire i guess could that one awkward moment be the words to prevent someone from committing suicide could that one awkward moment be that one chance where they accept the truth is it too much to ask for one awkward moment no guess what it's awkward sometimes and you know what 99.99 of the time it might not go anywhere but there's always that point zero one percent there's always that one percent and then 99 of the time maybe it'll be weird so you maybe you've had maybe you've witnessed this to people time and time again and you go why do i even do this anymore how do you know you didn't witness to somebody some random person on the street or in the grocery store then two weeks later they move to lima ohio and they meet someone else in the grocery store who tells them and they go hey i just had a conversation like that with somebody a month ago can i come to your church guess what you would never ever ever hear about it does that mean god didn't do anything no no see we as humans we want we want we want that reward we want that we want that satisfaction of seeing a job ended job done guess what this is something that i've been praying lord that i that i i my attitude when it comes to to ministering when it comes to being a youth leader when it comes to to to just trying to direct trying to show the love of christ lord and i'm human i'm not saying i'm perfect but lord i don't care if i ever hear about it i just want to be content with doing it i don't want to find my contentness in knowing that it worked i don't want to confine my contentness in knowing i was a good um youth leader or a good preacher or anything i just want to find contentment content you know what i'm trying to say in just doing it every day every wednesday every sunday just lord i find my peace in the fact that i'm doing it lord i don't see it's don't get me wrong it's good to hear it it's encouraging to hear it but i don't want to stop doing it because people stop telling me how it's doing that's right i want to do it because god called it and that is the paradox saying to god you serve god just because you serve god not because you're looking for a reward that's love that's the love of christ you serve him because you love him not because you're looking to have a nice house because you're looking to get blessed because you're looking you don't serve your church sitting in the pew saying amen because you want to become you know recognized true help true help is when it comes unselfishly there is no conditions you just help because you see the need and you want to help there's a big you can see it sometimes you know someone's like i really want to help really want to help you say okay can you vacuum the church twice a month they never show up they wanted you to say sure can you play the piano wednesday and sunday or can you work in the sound booth they want a prominent position they don't really want to help they want to be recognized as someone i i've been through that i'm ashamed to say it but i've done it god help me i amen are you helping are you serving just because you love god and you love the people of god or are you serving for a reward sister i mean you guys come this morning praise the lord i hope something was said this morning that spoke to your heart i know the lord spoke to my heart it's important not to limit god into a box because that revelation he has for you might completely turn your world upside down and my might mean you've been doing the wrong thing for the last 10 20 30 years do you realize that amen i don't know that came across kind of flat but maybe we just need to raise it a key praise the lord let's bow our heads this morning heavenly father lord jesus i trust that your will be done this morning lord your will is unconventional but it's uninhibited and it's shameless help us to remember that in our day-to-day life for jesus [Music] the broader spectrum of what we're going through the people we know lord help us to remember lord that your will is sometimes very disruptive of our lives and what we have figured out lord it's time and time again through the scripture even thinking of king josiah disrupted the entire kingdom when he found out things were being done according to your word lord you went through the temple the money changers and whipped them up one side and down the other because of compassion because your will wasn't being done lord it was the accepted norm though to deal the sell the sacrifices in the temple it was the accepted norm but it wasn't your will help us to never be confined by what would be considered our or duty will be considered the norm never to be confined by that but to ask lord is your will contrary to what the people say my duty is oh god i thank you for your mercy and your grace lord for what you've brought us through the the battles that we've faced the times lord jesus when we've had to turn our back on situations and walk away because it was your will lord give us the strength to carry on give us the strength lord when things don't look like they're getting any better to just keep on doing what's right help us lord to serve you with every fiber of our being lord father to never serve you out of out of conditions but to serve you unconditionally oh lord jesus [Music] oh thank you saints while you just lift your hands and just thank him for his grace this morning lord we just feel your sweetness come down just now lord your presence soften our hearts lord jesus help us to be willing to be molded by your will of jesus help us to be willing to be molded by your your will for our lives lord if there be some here this morning that have built a box around their religion lord around their life and you're just trying to get in as a gentleman you're knocking or may they drop those barriers of unbelief and may you have the liberty to come inside and change their hearts lord jesus lord that each one will be open father to whatever it is you have them to do maybe they're nothing they need to change maybe they living in the will of god but their heart has gotten a little bit hardened by oh the battles we face lord jesus the battles this church grace tabernacle has been through lord in the past couple of years lord jesus father if there be some oh still remaining some unforgiveness no remaining i pray that obama gillian would come and wash over that lord father we would not that we would say not that we would apologize for standing upon the word the father that we would accept the fact that even those who hurt us may be potential sons of god even though who those who offend us they have the potential to accept revelation of christ i thank you lord jesus for your grace continue lord to give me forgiveness help me to forgive those whether they apologize or not to forgive and apply the love of christ we thank you lord jesus thank you for this wonderful time this morning i hope it was just as good for everyone in the congregation as it was for me lord i i'm sorry i'm such a mess but god your grace is so good thank you lord jesus christ's name we pray [Music] let your word be born in the major of my heart let it live in me let it start live inside this
