[37:39] Chris and tell him to put on his suit
[37:41] and tie and to come down here and greet
[37:43] the people but I have a feeling they

[37:49] our brother Ivan here this morning you
[37:53] know his Brotherhood his friendship his
[37:58] loved brother Chris yeah
[38:00] whether Ivan got in a truck and trailer

[38:17] Lord for first
[38:19] traveling mercies amen our brother
[38:23] Sergei we appreciate him coming in this
[38:25] morning just to help cover to make sure
[38:28] everything was working well we
[38:31] appreciate that kind of dedication we
[38:35] also want to just bring greetings to you
[38:37] from our brother jewel Forney had a
[38:39] lovely conversation with him yesterday
[38:41] lengthy conversation just dealing you
[38:48] know a little bit of business you might
[38:50] say and just discussing things and we're
[38:53] just looking for the day when all of
[38:54] this changes brother jewel come visit us
[38:58] we also have just a lovely testimony of
[39:01] what God has done for our brother jewel
[39:04] has lowered his blood pressure all of
[39:09] these factors that were influencing him
[39:12] so detrimental II the Lord has just come
[39:15] on this scene and brother jewel was just
[39:18] sharing with me that he has not felt
[39:20] this good in in years and so he's is
[39:23] just helping with a group of believers
[39:25] they're in North Carolina just to help
[39:30] move them towards the rapture so I bring
[39:33] greetings to you from brother jewel
[39:35] sister Vanessa amen let's just stand as
[39:38] will turn this morning to the Word of
[39:40] God want to thank our musicians the
[39:42] special song you will find that what I
[39:45] preached this morning will be very
[39:47] similar I was a per sheet if of the song
[39:50] that sister Jerry's sister Jolin and
[39:53] sister Aaliyah sang for us because we're
[39:57] going to talk this morning on who was
[39:59] worthy amen
[40:00] so I want to just title this today
[40:03] redemptions manifestation and so we just
[40:08] laying a little foundation before we go
[40:10] into the reading of the word that if
[40:13] there is my brother and sister a
[40:15] redemption having taken place there will
[40:18] be an evidence of that redemption amen
[40:22] we cannot remain the same and say that
[40:27] we have received redemption we cannot
[40:29] just be the old man the carnal man
[40:31] unchanging through the
[40:32] years but when Christ has come we are
[40:36] the scripture says a new creation and I
[40:39] say thank you for that Lord by your
[40:42] grace and mercy so let's just turn in
[40:44] first Corinthians starting with the
[40:48] first chapter of the eighteenth verse
[40:50] quite a lengthy reading of Scripture so
[40:52] we'll read a portion of it and allow you
[40:54] to be seated amen first Corinthians one
[40:57] and 18 for the preaching of the Cross is
[41:01] to them that perish foolishness but unto
[41:04] us which are saved it is the power of
[41:06] God
[41:07] can we say men to that it is the power
[41:11] of God to us for it is written I will
[41:13] destroy the wisdom of the wise and will
[41:16] bring to nothing the understanding of
[41:18] the prudent where is the wise where is
[41:22] the scribe where is the disputer of this
[41:25] world hath not God made foolish the
[41:28] wisdom of this world now I would want to
[41:31] just interject real quick when you look
[41:33] at the the words of wisdom that are
[41:36] coming from all the great political
[41:38] leaders around the world to me it drives
[41:42] home this scripture that God hath made
[41:46] foolish the wisdom of this world and
[41:49] you'll see my brother and sister as time
[41:52] goes on that they will become a paradox
[41:55] and a conflict or contradictory to their
[42:01] very own thinking their own words
[42:04] because while they believe they have
[42:07] wisdom we know that wisdom true wisdom
[42:09] only comes from God for after that in
[42:12] the wisdom of God the world by wisdom
[42:14] knew not god it pleased God by the
[42:17] foolishness of preaching to save them
[42:19] that believe for the Jews require a sign
[42:22] in the Greeks seek after wisdom but we
[42:25] preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a
[42:28] stumbling-block and unto the Greeks
[42:31] foolishness Heavenly Father we just ask
[42:33] you this morning Lord to come Lord be
[42:36] with the Saints wherever they may be
[42:38] this morning and their home Lord abroad
[42:40] on the road wherever it might be we ask
[42:43] you Father to deal with the hearts of
[42:45] your children
[42:46] her father your word is here it is
[42:49] present it is powerful and we want to
[42:51] receive it with open arms and open heart
[42:54] this morning Lord to let the word work
[42:57] in us we thank you for the opportunity
[42:59] for the privilege to be a part of this
[43:01] great plan of God and we ask for your
[43:03] blessings now in the name of Jesus
[43:05] Christ amen
[43:07] you may be seated but we preach Christ
[43:10] crucified my brother and sister what a
[43:13] beautiful thing that we look into to
[43:16] realize that as we preach Christ
[43:18] crucified we're not speaking of one that
[43:21] is dead we're speaking of one that is
[43:23] alive and as it's been shared this
[43:26] morning with me from another pastor
[43:29] another friend of mine you know my
[43:31] brother and sister the church may be
[43:33] empty but so is the tomb so we have
[43:35] nothing to be ashamed of today that the
[43:38] circumstances of this life might have
[43:40] hindered us from coming together to to
[43:43] worship together on this Resurrection
[43:46] Day but what we do glorify my brother
[43:49] and sister and lift up is the redemptive
[43:51] power of our Lord Jesus Christ it
[43:54] doesn't mean we have to be all in the
[43:57] same room for that power to be unleashed
[44:00] we can be setting as it would be in
[44:02] spirit on one mind and one Accord and
[44:04] God coming down wherever we might be in
[44:08] our home or on the road or wherever and
[44:11] God will deal with us and in each one
[44:14] hearing of the word will have an effect
[44:17] that is necessary for our life and I
[44:20] thank God for that
[44:21] but we preach Christ crucified under the
[44:24] Jews a stumbling-block and unto the
[44:26] Greeks foolishness but unto them which
[44:28] are called now see how God I just love
[44:31] this you know through the years I've
[44:33] probably been a little redundant about
[44:35] this but you see God puts his
[44:37] quantifiers on the word and and but unto
[44:41] them which are called my brother and
[44:43] sister so when the call is made and we
[44:45] respond to that this puts the scripture
[44:48] in a whole different context to us and
[44:51] so but unto them which are called both
[44:53] Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God
[44:55] the wisdom of God because the
[44:58] foolishness of God is wise
[45:00] than men and the weakness of God is
[45:02] stronger than men I say thank you Lord
[45:05] because no matter what man would come up
[45:08] with God is greater and I say thank you
[45:11] Lord now look for you see your calling
[45:14] brethren how that not many wise men
[45:17] after the flesh not many mighty not many
[45:20] noble are called and I want to just take
[45:23] a moment just for us to stop and think
[45:26] about it and look around us and realize
[45:29] my brother and sister look around you
[45:31] look at yourself and we see the evidence
[45:34] manifested of this very verse right here
[45:37] that you see God doesn't call very many
[45:40] that are great great men he calls the
[45:42] highway and by way the common man the
[45:45] man that that needs a savior and well
[45:48] every man needs a savior but those that
[45:50] there are something there exist and he
[45:52] calls them and you look we see the
[45:55] evidence manifested and God doesn't
[45:57] raise up too many kings and potentates
[45:59] and presidents and great intellectual
[46:02] men God come after the common man who
[46:05] could have faith in believe and so as we
[46:08] look around we will see the evidence
[46:10] manifested and the definition of the
[46:13] word manifested is to be displayed to
[46:17] show exhibit to be demonstrated and the
[46:20] pluralities of those words displayed and
[46:24] and shown it applies to all of those so
[46:27] we see as we look around we see the
[46:31] evidence of what is God is manifesting
[46:33] around us and we see how that God would
[46:36] choose a people and then choose to bless
[46:39] those people choose a common people and
[46:41] choose to bless those people I say thank
[46:45] you Lord amen because certainly today we
[46:47] have nothing to boast about in our
[46:49] intelligence and yet we would find many
[46:52] great people profound people called of
[46:57] God but God has chosen the foolish
[46:59] things of the world to confound the wise
[47:01] and God had chosen the weak things of
[47:04] the world to confound the things which
[47:07] are mighty you know my brother and
[47:09] sister we I've heard several brothers
[47:13] through the
[47:13] years kind of preach along this line but
[47:16] when you look at how simple it is when
[47:18] God made a blade of grass now man can
[47:22] reproduce grass he can take and and
[47:26] hybrid that may be one kind of grass
[47:29] with another he can transplant it he can
[47:32] do a lot of things but he cannot create
[47:34] the blade of grass and so you know I
[47:37] just remember my brother on Peterson
[47:39] speaking on the topic of being drawn to
[47:42] a higher kingdom my brother and sister
[47:45] what would be nutrients as it were in
[47:47] the soil of this earth water and
[47:49] minerals and all of the things that make
[47:51] up the earth you draw out of that and
[47:54] something grows and here we have of the
[47:57] common things of life a common people
[47:59] you would say and God has drawn out of
[48:02] the things of this earth and drawn up
[48:04] through them people that are vessels
[48:06] worthy to give praise and glory and
[48:09] honor to our Lord Jesus Christ I say
[48:11] Lord draw us into a higher Kingdom amen
[48:14] so as you look at this you see how that
[48:16] God is working and he said the base
[48:18] things of the world and things which are
[48:20] despised hath God chosen yay
[48:23] the things which are not to bring to
[48:26] nought the things that are that no flesh
[48:29] should glory in his presence have you
[48:32] ever noticed my brother and sister every
[48:34] time man starts to glory in his position
[48:37] in God if people will lift up a pastor
[48:40] or a minister evangelist something and
[48:42] they lift him up put him on a pedestal
[48:43] God has a way of bringing that down and
[48:47] and reminding us that we cannot glory in
[48:51] ourselves but we glory in his presence
[48:54] every ability every talent that we have
[48:56] everything we've ever done for the Lord
[48:59] was the Lord using us or giving us the
[49:02] privilege to be a part of what he was
[49:04] doing
[49:05] amen so it's there that but of him are
[49:08] ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made
[49:12] unto us wisdom and righteousness and
[49:14] sanctification and redemption that
[49:17] according as it is written he that
[49:19] glorieth let him glory in the Lord we
[49:22] want to just bring God's blessings upon
[49:24] the word today we thank you lord
[49:27] amen now my brother and sister around
[49:29] the world today there'll be many many
[49:31] churches many ministry whether it be
[49:34] online or if they have the opportunity
[49:36] to meet in person my brother and sister
[49:39] there'll be many preaching or speaking
[49:41] today of the death burial and
[49:42] resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ
[49:44] and that is a beautiful subject I don't
[49:47] believe we should ever allow ourselves
[49:48] to become tired of speaking on that
[49:52] subject to realize what God has done for
[49:55] us by decision amen just as it is
[49:59] God did not I always you know mix up the
[50:02] word and kind of throw it out there that
[50:03] our Lord Jesus blood was spilled but it
[50:06] was not spilt as the prophet of God says
[50:09] it was poured out denoting an
[50:11] intentional act that God did for you and
[50:14] I and I say it's beautiful when we think
[50:16] about Calvary we think about the
[50:19] sacrifice that was made how that is so
[50:23] beautiful because it was intentional and
[50:25] as the scripture says he first loved us
[50:27] amen so it's there as we go back just a
[50:30] little bit and just touch upon the chain
[50:32] of events and you know every one of
[50:35] these events that come up to the
[50:36] crucifixion of our Lord Jesus was a
[50:39] fulfillment of prophecy these were not
[50:41] just happenstance these were not just
[50:43] something that come to pass in a certain
[50:46] way just by chance but we'll see that
[50:49] each one of these was to fulfill
[50:50] prophecy my brother and sister they knew
[50:54] that Barabbas was worthy to be crucified
[50:58] but they were anointed and we have to
[51:02] recognize that while they knew the man
[51:04] was worthy he was a murderer he was a
[51:07] robber he was he was just a a vile man
[51:10] but they were anointed and they so hated
[51:14] the word that come and exposed their
[51:17] position and under that anointing that
[51:19] they cry out that our Lord Jesus would
[51:22] be crucified my brother and sister every
[51:25] portion of that coming down fulfilling
[51:27] prophecy to bring it to pass exactly
[51:30] according to the Word of God and I say
[51:33] thank you Lord because the word is
[51:35] prophesied in this last day there would
[51:37] be a people that would only be able they
[51:40] would not even
[51:41] be able to embrace Satan's plan but they
[51:44] would only be able to say Amen to the
[51:46] Word of God for this day and they would
[51:49] stand solid upon the word because as the
[51:51] song was sang this morning where there
[51:54] is a deep calling there is a deep to
[51:56] respond and my brother and sister if the
[51:59] deep is out there and there's no calling
[52:01] then there's something missing in that
[52:03] individual and it don't matter how
[52:05] available the deep is the Word of God
[52:07] the presence of God the Holy Ghost no
[52:10] matter how available that is if there's
[52:13] nothing crying out for that then there
[52:16] will be no moving or no shifting in that
[52:18] person's position and so as we look at
[52:21] this we realize that by prophecy when
[52:23] our eyes are opened isn't it interesting
[52:25] as sons and daughters of God when the
[52:28] word is open your Bible is opened to you
[52:31] the message of our hour enlightens the
[52:34] the the world around you you know my
[52:37] brother and sister I'm not speaking to
[52:39] the make believer that might go for a
[52:41] season and change his mind and turn back
[52:43] I'm talking to the real believer that
[52:45] isn't it amazing that when the light
[52:48] comes and illuminates something to you
[52:51] you can never walk away from that you
[52:54] can never unsee it so as the word is
[52:58] being open to the bride in this day we
[53:00] cannot go back and unsee it my brother
[53:03] and sister we will not apologize for
[53:05] what we have saw in this scripture we
[53:08] will not apologize for those things that
[53:10] the prophet of God said were hidden as
[53:13] it were not his exact words but hidden
[53:15] in plain sight my brother and sister why
[53:18] was it on that time in that season that
[53:20] the Messiah walked right in the midst of
[53:23] Israel and they could not see him the
[53:26] word says that their eyes were blinded
[53:29] and we were living in a day my brother
[53:31] and sister where many people are blinded
[53:34] to the day that we are living and what
[53:36] God is doing
[53:37] so these chain of events that led to
[53:41] Jesus crucifixion his death burial and
[53:45] resurrection they were prophecy and no
[53:48] less today my brother and sister is the
[53:51] chain of events that are taking place
[53:53] right now
[53:54] any less than prophecy being fulfilled
[53:57] the word has declared that the season
[54:00] would come that it was just like Sodom
[54:03] well my brother and sister I said years
[54:05] ago look at this oh the time must be
[54:08] nice it's like Sodom and yet we're many
[54:11] many times worse now than it was then
[54:14] and maybe we're still not there yet my
[54:16] brother and sister but you look at this
[54:19] whatever the word has prophesied we can
[54:22] look at that and we don't need to worry
[54:24] about it people get all excited oh my
[54:26] goodness they're gonna make us carry
[54:28] some kind of ID card this is the mark of
[54:30] the beast it's got to be oh they're
[54:32] making this they're gonna take the money
[54:34] away and give us some kind of electronic
[54:36] currency they're gonna oh they're gonna
[54:38] my brother and sister don't fret about
[54:39] it
[54:40] amen because these are just the
[54:42] fulfillment of prophecy coming to pass
[54:46] that this will lead right up to the end
[54:48] time but the word tells us when you see
[54:51] these things drawing nigh look up your
[54:54] redemption is drawing nigh don't be
[54:56] looking down here at the circumstance of
[54:59] Laodicea but look up because our
[55:02] redemption is drawing nigh to us
[55:05] hallelujah don't become distracted in
[55:08] the day that we're living amen
[55:10] now you see everything happening fulfill
[55:13] prophecy John 19 and 30 my brother and
[55:17] sister what an interesting scripture as
[55:20] we look at this and so we come he said
[55:23] when Jesus therefore had received the
[55:25] vinegar he said it is finished he didn't
[55:35] explain himself he didn't say now this
[55:39] ties to this and this tossed it is
[55:41] because you see for those that were
[55:44] ordained to see it saw it those that
[55:49] were not ordained to see it you could
[55:51] not have explained it to them
[55:53] you could not have diagrammed it broke
[55:55] it down put it on the whiteboard you
[55:57] could not have given enough scripture
[55:59] enough quotations for them to see it so
[56:02] to those that it is given to see they
[56:05] see it and so as he says here when Jesus
[56:08] there
[56:08] received the vinegar he said it is
[56:10] finished he bowed his head and gave up
[56:13] the ghost now my brother and sister you
[56:15] look at this this right here is not the
[56:18] start and this is not the finish so
[56:21] please don't misunderstand today but
[56:24] this was a stage of the word being
[56:27] revealed or fulfilled this was a stage
[56:31] and as Jesus is there and says it is
[56:34] finished he is telling us now that the
[56:37] full manifestation of the plan of
[56:40] redemption is now on display Amen you
[56:43] say well it wasn't my brother and sister
[56:46] until he was a resurrected that it
[56:49] really no my brother and sister the
[56:52] sacrifice of the Lamb is what said it
[56:55] all in motion for mankind and so there
[56:58] as we had the Old Testament type of man
[57:00] coming he had to offer up something with
[57:03] blood and it was there that he's offered
[57:06] the lamb he's offered the lamb he's
[57:07] offered the lamb but the lamb never
[57:09] dealt with this sin issue the blood was
[57:13] merely a covering but God said once and
[57:15] for all I'm going to deal with the sin
[57:18] issue and in that I will come and I will
[57:22] become the personal sacrifice for my
[57:26] people and so it's there as a plan of
[57:28] redemption is now on display he paid the
[57:31] price and I'm thankful I think we would
[57:34] all say you thank you Lord that you
[57:36] chose to pay a price for us amen the
[57:39] lamb my brother and sister we know by
[57:42] the word of God the lamb slain before
[57:44] the foundation of the world was now put
[57:47] on display in front of you and I
[57:50] figuratively in front of the world the
[57:53] lamb this scripture says he was slain
[57:56] before the foundation of the world my
[57:58] brother and sister now God put that on
[58:01] public display so as we all see that
[58:04] just as it is people say well praise the
[58:06] Lord I got saved now my name's on the
[58:09] book of life and I'm gonna go on no I'm
[58:12] sorry my brother and sister this was all
[58:14] settled God set this in motion before
[58:17] the foundation of the world so we didn't
[58:20] seek out God God
[58:22] and the word would come my brother and
[58:24] sister that deep calling Amen that was
[58:27] within us was placed there by Almighty
[58:30] God determined a pre determinate results
[58:34] and people say well how is that well
[58:36] I'll tell you how its predetermined
[58:38] because God being omniscient omnipresent
[58:41] looked down through time and said
[58:43] there's one with a seed right there I'll
[58:45] write his name God is not going to drag
[58:48] you to the altar God is not going to
[58:50] force you to do this but he knows how to
[58:54] come in such a way that the very thing
[58:57] that is deep within you oh I thank the
[59:00] Lord for that because if our path was
[59:02] headed off in the wrong direction it was
[59:04] going to take more especially you know
[59:06] in the nature of cynical people they
[59:08] they want to question everything they
[59:10] want an answer they got to see why but
[59:13] my brother and sister when you can take
[59:14] a cynic and they're headed down their
[59:16] path of life and that deep call in them
[59:19] starts to turn them around I say thank
[59:22] you Lord there you have the power to
[59:24] turn us around amen and we don't even
[59:27] have to be out here in sin we can be
[59:29] faithful in the house of God and
[59:31] something just creep into our life a
[59:33] little bit and we start to go a certain
[59:35] way a certain little spirit certain
[59:37] little attitude something start us in a
[59:39] way and God has an ability because he
[59:42] placed that in us it's there it's alive
[59:45] it's real and he turns us around that's
[59:48] why he can make that assurance and he'll
[59:50] never lose a one you see Satan can't
[59:52] trick yes my brother and sister Satan
[59:54] can't bring it around in any such a
[59:57] fashion to cause it to not work because
[59:59] Satan already defeated knows he is
[1:00:02] subject to the word oh thank you
[1:00:06] amen I'm glad that lamb is on display in
[1:00:08] front of us today now brother Branham
[1:00:11] says right here in the breach amen
[1:00:13] it's a lovely lovely quote and I trust
[1:00:16] this morning you'll be able to catch
[1:00:18] what stirred my heart and Johnny in this
[1:00:20] spirit see John wasn't standing there as
[1:00:22] a carnal man
[1:00:23] John in the spirit standing up here in
[1:00:26] heaven he'd just been lifted up now from
[1:00:28] the church agency he saw the church ages
[1:00:31] and he was taken up in the fourth
[1:00:34] chapter said come up higher
[1:00:36] I'm going to show you things that will
[1:00:39] come and he saw one sitting upon the
[1:00:41] throne with this book in his hand in his
[1:00:44] right hand think of it now and then in
[1:00:49] this book was a title deed to redemption
[1:00:52] and it was sealed with seven seals oh my
[1:00:58] brother and sister this stirs my heart I
[1:01:00] just hope you can see I rejoice I
[1:01:01] couldn't sleep this morning I got up a
[1:01:03] little after four went and set in my
[1:01:05] office and just rejoiced amen so here's
[1:01:09] this book there's a title deed but it
[1:01:10] was sealed with seven seals and then an
[1:01:13] angel come forth this strong angel
[1:01:15] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[1:01:17] worthy to open the book to take the book
[1:01:20] who is able to open the seals who is
[1:01:23] able to open this book see the angel
[1:01:25] asked it John saw it the angel asked it
[1:01:30] and he said now who is worthy let him oh
[1:01:35] my maybe I'm just feeling this this way
[1:01:38] but let him said the angel let him hear
[1:01:42] is the book of redemption my brother and
[1:01:45] sister will look at the seven seals we
[1:01:48] can look at it now there'll be people
[1:01:49] who say they're not open I'm not here to
[1:01:51] argue with you if you don't see that
[1:01:52] they're open now this fine I believe
[1:01:54] they're open I believe the majority of
[1:01:56] the church that I pastor believes if not
[1:01:59] all that the seals are open I'm not here
[1:02:01] to argue that but I'm here to tell you
[1:02:03] here was a book sealed with seven seals
[1:02:06] and a prophet of God shows us clearly
[1:02:08] this is the book of redemption it is not
[1:02:12] just a mystery here and a mystery there
[1:02:15] to be unveiled but this is the very book
[1:02:19] of redemption which means that within
[1:02:21] the seven seals it contains the bride of
[1:02:25] Jesus Christ
[1:02:26] she is not external to that she is in
[1:02:30] that mystery that needed to be revealed
[1:02:33] now you put that in there and think
[1:02:35] about that and hold on to that idea now
[1:02:38] my brother and sister but let him said
[1:02:40] the angel let him here is the book of
[1:02:43] redemption here is the plan of
[1:02:45] redemption here is the only way
[1:02:48] you'll ever be redeemed but I was
[1:02:54] redeemed before the foundation in the
[1:02:55] world but it had to be manifested it had
[1:03:00] to be open God wasn't going to take who
[1:03:03] was the Bride of Christ as it were as a
[1:03:06] mystery back to heaven with him he
[1:03:09] revealed that here and he revealed it
[1:03:12] and you say but we still don't know who
[1:03:14] the Bride of Christ is but I'm telling
[1:03:16] you my brother and sister the prophet of
[1:03:18] God showed us that the Bride of Christ
[1:03:19] is coming to a knowledge of who she is
[1:03:23] he says when she sees who she is right
[1:03:28] he didn't say when this great ministry
[1:03:30] over here or angel sees or someone over
[1:03:34] here sees he says when she sees who she
[1:03:37] is so there is now a revelation that is
[1:03:40] unfolding to the Bride of Christ on the
[1:03:43] earth today because when she sees who
[1:03:47] she is she will become an invincible
[1:03:50] army and so this revelation of the plan
[1:03:54] of redemption the book of redemption
[1:03:55] must be opened in this hour that the
[1:03:59] bride my brother and sister now we can't
[1:04:01] sometimes if we're preachers and we get
[1:04:03] a little carried away
[1:04:04] we might judge people by their actions
[1:04:06] but maybe they've been taught a certain
[1:04:08] way and they don't see something but God
[1:04:10] is shining that light in their path and
[1:04:12] they're starting to realize and they
[1:04:14] don't even realize all well I'm now the
[1:04:17] bride what they realize is is they're
[1:04:19] having victory after victory over
[1:04:22] personal things in their life and their
[1:04:24] family that they are able things that
[1:04:27] control them they're now able to control
[1:04:29] that by the grace of Almighty God what
[1:04:32] is she doing she's seeing that God is
[1:04:35] with her and that she has power over the
[1:04:38] spirits that have held her hostage or
[1:04:40] held her in bondage and so as she's
[1:04:43] moving forward she starts to realize who
[1:04:46] she is and it's not me the powerful me
[1:04:49] the Conqueror but it's Christ in me that
[1:04:52] is taking care and and fulfilling these
[1:04:55] things of the word and so there it is
[1:04:57] changing the position my brother and
[1:05:00] sister of a son or daughter of God
[1:05:02] so let's come forth who is able open the
[1:05:04] book Angel asket John sought who is now
[1:05:07] who is worthy maybe I'm just feeling
[1:05:09] this this way but let him said the angel
[1:05:12] let him here is the book of redemption
[1:05:14] here's the plan of redemption here's the
[1:05:16] only way you'll ever be redeemed for
[1:05:19] here is the title deed to redemption of
[1:05:22] the whole heavens and earth let him come
[1:05:24] forward if he will oh my now speak or
[1:05:27] forever hold his peace
[1:05:28] let him come forward and claim this book
[1:05:30] who is worthy to do it brother Branham
[1:05:34] said that in the breach I encourage you
[1:05:37] paragraphs 155 157 just go listen to the
[1:05:42] whole sermon don't just go pick out one
[1:05:44] spot it's incredible message amen
[1:05:46] because as you look at that you realize
[1:05:49] that the plan of redemption we can say
[1:05:51] well it was all in in Jesus Christ he
[1:05:54] his death burial resurrection there was
[1:05:56] a plan of redemption my brother it's
[1:05:58] much deeper the world today for a low
[1:06:01] gamut of Christendom a whole gamut of
[1:06:04] that is saying yeah Jesus died was
[1:06:07] buried and resurrected but it is not
[1:06:10] producing what the word said so there's
[1:06:13] something deeper than just resurrected
[1:06:16] understanding or seeing a death a burial
[1:06:18] and resurrection amen you have to see
[1:06:21] what is contained in there now as we'll
[1:06:25] look at this I want to bring further
[1:06:26] clarity and souls that are in prison now
[1:06:30] brother Branham goes on along this same
[1:06:33] thought a few months later approximately
[1:06:37] eight months just shy of eight months
[1:06:38] later he preaches this he said but one
[1:06:41] day he rose from there and come forth
[1:06:42] where was the book at it was still in
[1:06:45] the abstract owner God Almighty and John
[1:06:48] looked around and he wept because there
[1:06:50] was no man even worthy to look on the
[1:06:53] book and especially opened the seals to
[1:06:56] reveal what the hidden mystery was the
[1:06:59] mysteries was in the seven seals and
[1:07:01] when those seven seals was open that
[1:07:03] opened the entire Bible now here again
[1:07:08] I'm not here to cause problem with those
[1:07:10] who don't believe the seals are open but
[1:07:12] I'm just simple enough my brother and
[1:07:14] sister I'm not
[1:07:16] intellectual and when I read this it
[1:07:18] tells me when those seven seals open
[1:07:20] that opened the entire Bible so if we do
[1:07:23] not have seven seals open we do not have
[1:07:26] an entire Bible opened so I stand on
[1:07:31] that I believe it's open because here we
[1:07:34] are my brother and sister I believe that
[1:07:36] the Bible is an open book to the bride
[1:07:39] of Jesus Christ amen
[1:07:41] it is not something that we are going to
[1:07:43] go and to a rapture with only a partial
[1:07:45] understanding the word said at the
[1:07:48] sounding of the seventh angels messenger
[1:07:51] the mysteries of God should be finished
[1:07:54] come complete not just finished as in
[1:07:57] put a period on it but it would be
[1:07:59] completed and so it's there as we look
[1:08:02] at this I'm not like I said I'm not
[1:08:04] apologetic this morning nor am i trying
[1:08:07] to be overly aggressive this morning but
[1:08:10] my brother and sister I believe that God
[1:08:12] sent a prophet in our day to open the
[1:08:15] book and make it a revealed book not a
[1:08:19] book of mystery does that mean that Paul
[1:08:21] understands it all no it does not mean
[1:08:23] that Paul understands all of it but the
[1:08:25] impact or the influence or the word of
[1:08:28] being brought forth the power of the
[1:08:30] word I believe is open and it is here
[1:08:33] and we might not be able to explain it
[1:08:35] like a theologian but my brother and
[1:08:37] sister I believe that the open book has
[1:08:40] an effect upon you and I'm and it's
[1:08:42] bringing us you and I not someone else
[1:08:45] not another church not another country
[1:08:47] you and I to a place that we are able to
[1:08:50] say amen to every word of God upon
[1:08:54] saying amen to that word it releases the
[1:08:57] power in that word now we as a prophet
[1:09:00] of God shows us we do not have power but
[1:09:03] we do have authority amen our just
[1:09:06] listening I listen to several sermons
[1:09:09] this last few days in the tractor and
[1:09:11] I'm sorry I can't quite place which what
[1:09:13] was in but brother Brannon once again
[1:09:15] references that little policeman his
[1:09:17] hats big enough it's down over his ears
[1:09:19] and he's there with that uniform that's
[1:09:21] too big he stands out there in the
[1:09:23] street but my brother and sister when he
[1:09:25] raises that whistle puts it to his lips
[1:09:27] and blows it and
[1:09:29] his little Oh scrawny arm out there that
[1:09:31] little hand it is not his power that
[1:09:33] will stop those cars it's the authority
[1:09:36] behind them we're not here looking for
[1:09:38] some kind of power to personally come
[1:09:41] and bind Satan to personally come and
[1:09:43] overcome Satan but we're here my brother
[1:09:46] and sister with the authority to unleash
[1:09:49] the word that has been restored in our
[1:09:51] day the word that a prophet of God set
[1:09:54] back in order we have been given the
[1:09:56] authority to use that word amen for the
[1:10:00] benefit of our personal life as in
[1:10:03] salvation and for our wives and our
[1:10:05] children and our families and those
[1:10:07] around us we've been given that kind of
[1:10:09] authority I say we use it I say we quit
[1:10:13] sitting back saying well I hope I say we
[1:10:17] start saying the word says the word says
[1:10:21] that we can claim this the word says
[1:10:23] that when we submit ourselves to the
[1:10:26] Word of God that glove and the prophet
[1:10:29] of God obligated himself it's not you
[1:10:32] and I putting him under obligation God
[1:10:34] Himself obligated himself to bring it to
[1:10:38] pass well thank you lord thank you lord
[1:10:41] oh my now where was I amen
[1:10:50] what was it still in the abstract owner
[1:10:51] mysteries in the seven seals there we
[1:10:53] are
[1:10:54] but when those seven seals was opened
[1:10:56] that opened up the entire Bible the
[1:10:59] seven seals it was sealed with seven
[1:11:00] mysteries and in those seven seals held
[1:11:02] the entire mystery of it and it was the
[1:11:05] book of redemption , new Testament what
[1:11:12] was this the New Testament now being
[1:11:14] brought to life all that took place in
[1:11:16] the New Testament being brought to life
[1:11:19] not the old it only proclaimed for the
[1:11:21] New Testament they have been made cannot
[1:11:25] be made perfect without us Hebrews 11
[1:11:27] and we'll touch on that in a minute see
[1:11:29] see now the redemption only come when
[1:11:32] the Redeemer died you see the prophet of
[1:11:36] God didn't say that Redemption only come
[1:11:39] when the Redeemer resurrected
[1:11:42] says redemption came when the Redeemer
[1:11:45] died you see my brother and sister it
[1:11:48] was a given because of prophecy that
[1:11:50] when the Redeemer was sacrificed
[1:11:52] crucified he died he would resurrect it
[1:11:59] wasn't we hope he would resurrect and
[1:12:01] we're waiting that's a human element
[1:12:03] that sought that way but to God it was a
[1:12:05] matter of I will die I will put my son
[1:12:08] Jesus Christ on the cross I not God
[1:12:12] dying but I'll put my son on the cross
[1:12:14] and then as he gives up the ghost that
[1:12:17] body will go into a grave and it will be
[1:12:21] there for three days
[1:12:22] amen and he will resurrect because this
[1:12:27] is a part of my plan of redemption this
[1:12:31] is my evidence to humanity that I'm
[1:12:35] alive and well and if they will live in
[1:12:37] me they have resurrection power in them
[1:12:40] also amen
[1:12:42] I'll tell you my brother and sister as
[1:12:44] we have heard it many times
[1:12:46] may if Jesus had not been named Nazareth
[1:12:49] at the at the graveyard if he had just
[1:12:52] said come forth that whole cemetery
[1:12:55] would emptied itself but God was very
[1:12:58] specific when he brought that out and
[1:13:01] anointed that to come forth that he
[1:13:03] named what it was and I tie that back my
[1:13:06] brother and sister to those whose names
[1:13:08] are on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:13:10] amen they are named by God we are not my
[1:13:14] brother and sister we are not contained
[1:13:16] I hope you catch this we are not
[1:13:19] contained within the general
[1:13:21] resurrection alone you see the general
[1:13:25] resurrection will be those that come
[1:13:27] forth to stand before God to be judged
[1:13:30] at the white throne of judgment we are
[1:13:33] not coming forth in a general
[1:13:35] resurrection as to just be one of the
[1:13:38] common but when that day comes and that
[1:13:41] word is spoken and that of thunders you
[1:13:44] might say around the earth and it claps
[1:13:47] you might say on the backside and comes
[1:13:49] back around every son and daughter of
[1:13:51] God whether they be in the ocean they
[1:13:54] were burnt up they were fed
[1:13:56] the wild animals it's not been a matter
[1:13:57] to God he knows where every molecule in
[1:14:00] every portion is and so when Redemption
[1:14:03] my brother and sister starts to come
[1:14:05] forth in that that we would call the
[1:14:07] resurrection or the rapture when that
[1:14:09] starts to come forth every molecule
[1:14:12] knows where it belongs everything knows
[1:14:15] where it's supposed to fall in place
[1:14:16] there won't be a mystery there won't be
[1:14:18] over there going well is this my hip
[1:14:20] boner is this know my brother and sister
[1:14:22] they'll know hallelujah I hope I'm
[1:14:25] making sense this morning hey man I I
[1:14:27] preach sister Jerry comes in this
[1:14:29] morning she says who are you talking to
[1:14:31] I don't worry about I'm just talking to
[1:14:33] myself amen I was excited this morning
[1:14:36] knowing I didn't really have an order to
[1:14:39] put it in but God was good I believe
[1:14:41] amen so redemption only come when the
[1:14:45] Redeemer died and they were potentially
[1:14:47] under the blood of lambs not the
[1:14:49] Redeemer hadn't been redeemed yet until
[1:14:51] the Redeemer came notice now when this
[1:14:54] Redeemer John looked around and here
[1:14:56] said God on the throne with a book in
[1:14:58] his hand had been sealed with seven
[1:15:00] seals and the whole plan of redemption
[1:15:02] was in it and it had been lost by the
[1:15:05] human race Adam and God it went back
[1:15:08] where Satan couldn't take it he just
[1:15:11] calls them to lose it oh my brother and
[1:15:14] sister let me assure you that Satan
[1:15:17] never walked around with the Lamb's Book
[1:15:19] of Life saying I've got it I've got it
[1:15:21] all he did was cause them to lose it so
[1:15:25] realize that this devil never was there
[1:15:28] trying to pick the lock on the seven
[1:15:31] seals my brother and sister
[1:15:32] he put his interpretation to it he did
[1:15:35] all that he did but that seven seal my
[1:15:38] brother and sister this plan of
[1:15:39] redemption is God's plan it's nobody
[1:15:42] else's plan it's no Vicar it's no Pope
[1:15:45] it's no Bishop it's no hierarchy it's no
[1:15:48] great man my brother and sister this
[1:15:51] plan is God's plan and it will always be
[1:15:53] God's plan
[1:15:54] always has been always will be
[1:15:57] hallelujah the whole plan of redemption
[1:15:59] was in it and it had been lost by the
[1:16:01] human race Adam it went back where Satan
[1:16:04] couldn't take it
[1:16:05] he just caused him to lose it but where
[1:16:09] did the book
[1:16:09] Oh - then didn't belong to the human
[1:16:12] race
[1:16:13] blessings didn't belong here here the
[1:16:16] human race had lost it so when we're
[1:16:19] right back to the original owner that
[1:16:21] was God hallelujah that way we can say
[1:16:23] today I've always been in God's hands
[1:16:26] amen there's never been a time in my
[1:16:28] life even when I was not professing not
[1:16:30] living not doing what I should my life
[1:16:33] was in his hands I believe there's a
[1:16:35] song talks about that my life is in his
[1:16:38] hands amen
[1:16:39] it's never actually people like well you
[1:16:41] know when I was a young man it's kind of
[1:16:42] sad actually I back slid you know a
[1:16:45] people way back when we spoke to my
[1:16:48] parents oh how sad it was that your son
[1:16:50] is lost and you know at the time it just
[1:16:52] simply made me mad that people could be
[1:16:54] so rude but you know later on when God
[1:16:57] started to deal with me I realized my
[1:16:59] brother and sister no matter where my
[1:17:00] position looked like it was on this
[1:17:03] earth I was always in God's hands so I
[1:17:07] look back and I say well thank you Lord
[1:17:09] I'm not here to boast about some of the
[1:17:11] experiences I had but some of the things
[1:17:13] that show me clearly Who I am in Jesus
[1:17:16] Christ took place while I was not even
[1:17:18] serving him and so God used those things
[1:17:20] out there to reinforce Paul's need for
[1:17:24] Jesus Christ in his life hallelujah I
[1:17:27] believe that would apply to each and
[1:17:28] every one of us amen
[1:17:31] so went right back to its original owner
[1:17:36] that was God and here he set with it and
[1:17:38] he called for some man somebody to come
[1:17:41] and claim it John looked around and
[1:17:43] there was no man in heaven no man on
[1:17:45] earth nobody no angel I just read a
[1:17:49] quote last night you know brother
[1:17:52] branham's talking about we were made to
[1:17:54] be men will always be men we're not
[1:17:56] angels my brother and sister we're not
[1:17:58] angels God created us to be men women
[1:18:02] amen not angels some people have these
[1:18:06] crazy ideas that we somehow come from
[1:18:08] angels and come down to the earth but
[1:18:10] well you can choose believe your idea or
[1:18:13] the prophets whichever amen no angel
[1:18:17] nothing could take the book or loose the
[1:18:19] seals or even look on it no man was
[1:18:21] worthy John said he wept
[1:18:23] bitterly then an angel came to him said
[1:18:26] we've not John for the Lion of the tribe
[1:18:28] of Judah hath prevailed and he is worthy
[1:18:32] now imagine my brother and sister I
[1:18:34] believe John was just a man obviously
[1:18:36] used of God anointed of God to fulfill
[1:18:39] the word for his day and so it was there
[1:18:41] that you would see him being led by and
[1:18:43] by God to do what he's done and now John
[1:18:47] is there and you know the the voice
[1:18:49] speaks to him weep not John for the line
[1:18:53] of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and
[1:18:55] he is worthy now look John turns now
[1:18:59] brother branham house kind of here
[1:19:00] paragraph 148 you see John looked to see
[1:19:04] a lamb brother Ramzan stops or see a
[1:19:07] lion and what did he find you see the
[1:19:12] voice told him that the Lion of the
[1:19:13] tribe of Judah has prevailed he turned
[1:19:16] to look to expecting to see a lion but
[1:19:19] what does he see here he sees a bloody
[1:19:21] lamb and lamb that had been slain how
[1:19:24] long since the foundation of the world
[1:19:26] that the lamb came forth walked up to
[1:19:30] him that had the book in his right hand
[1:19:32] received the book climbed up on the
[1:19:34] throne and sat down that's it it was
[1:19:36] over oh my brother and sister do you get
[1:19:39] it here it is it's over Jesus as he's
[1:19:42] hanging on the cross said it is finished
[1:19:45] but you see like an author writing a
[1:19:48] book he did not put a period when he
[1:19:51] said it is finished
[1:19:52] it is not a period as in nothing else
[1:19:56] could come after this but this segment
[1:20:00] this portion taking place was finished
[1:20:03] in other words there was no need to come
[1:20:06] back and modify it no need to come back
[1:20:09] and add to it to get an explanation or
[1:20:12] an authority to bring it to pass
[1:20:14] but it was finished it was fully capable
[1:20:17] of fulfilling everything that it was
[1:20:19] asked to do it was over when when the
[1:20:23] seals was revealed
[1:20:31] my
[1:20:37] maybe the books not open but the word
[1:20:43] says the lamb had prevailed to open the
[1:20:46] book
[1:20:52] when the last one that was everything
[1:20:55] that he had redeemed there was nothing
[1:20:57] he come to redeem say why didn't he
[1:20:59] redeem them 40 years ago two thousand
[1:21:01] years ago see their names are on the
[1:21:04] book of life in that book and he had to
[1:21:07] stand here because it was God's purpose
[1:21:09] to redeem them their names were put on
[1:21:12] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:21:13] foundation of the world and the lamb was
[1:21:15] put there with it to be slain are you
[1:21:20] with me there is the names on the Lamb's
[1:21:23] Book of Life and God put the lamb right
[1:21:26] there with those names to be slain he
[1:21:30] didn't come afterwards and say now look
[1:21:32] we got to find a lamb we've got to do
[1:21:34] something to redeem this as he put the
[1:21:36] names in the book he put the lamb right
[1:21:38] there with the names right there with
[1:21:41] the book my brother and sister to be
[1:21:43] slain and here come the lamb when was
[1:21:45] slain come back to make intercessions Oh
[1:21:48] hallelujah I love this you see it's not
[1:21:51] just a matter of a crucifixion on a
[1:21:53] cross it was not a matter of just being
[1:21:54] placed in a grave it's not just a matter
[1:21:57] of a resurrection all of that was a part
[1:22:00] of the plan of redemption and so if you
[1:22:03] have a plan my brother and sister and
[1:22:05] you empower the plan you execute you
[1:22:08] might say mmm that's funny I use that
[1:22:09] word execute the plan and you started to
[1:22:13] be set in motion my brother's sister
[1:22:15] there has to be a manifestation of that
[1:22:20] plan there has to be a revelation there
[1:22:23] has to be something my brother and
[1:22:25] sister that would be then put upon
[1:22:27] display there has to be something that
[1:22:29] would be brought forth to show something
[1:22:32] exhibited something demonstrated you say
[1:22:36] well we have a plan well you know look
[1:22:38] at the government right now they have
[1:22:40] hand I don't know they might be on their
[1:22:42] 15th or 20th plan the world is on there
[1:22:44] whatever amount of plans we're gonna
[1:22:46] stop a virus we're gonna stop a virus
[1:22:48] the virus will stop when God ordained it
[1:22:52] to stop not one minute sooner not one
[1:22:55] minute later my brother and sister just
[1:22:57] like the mystery that the world
[1:22:58] acknowledged they could not understand
[1:23:00] how at that moment of time on the day
[1:23:04] and the
[1:23:05] of time that World War one stopped it
[1:23:08] wasn't that they announced there has
[1:23:10] been a treaty or a surrender there was
[1:23:12] men on the battlefield that knew nothing
[1:23:15] about a treaty or surrender but there
[1:23:18] was something passed over and they quit
[1:23:20] shooting at each other and Men started
[1:23:22] rising up out of the trenches and
[1:23:24] looking at one another not as a
[1:23:26] combatant not as an enemy but as mankind
[1:23:30] and there was something I've read a lot
[1:23:31] of history on that there was something
[1:23:33] anointed those men I remember reading
[1:23:36] about I believe it was a British soldier
[1:23:37] and he was quite a good soldier very
[1:23:40] good at the craft of warfare and there
[1:23:43] was something come upon him that
[1:23:45] something swept over him and he said I
[1:23:47] cannot take another life what is it 90
[1:23:54] of Almighty God the power of God my
[1:23:57] brother and sister stronger than
[1:23:59] national politics stronger than
[1:24:01] denominational spirits stronger than
[1:24:04] ideology the anointing of Almighty God
[1:24:07] more powerful my brother and sister
[1:24:09] sharper than a two-edged sword God is in
[1:24:12] control hallelujah sorry if I silenced
[1:24:15] Trident this morning I'm just actually
[1:24:17] very excited as I look at this that I
[1:24:20] can come I can walk with confidence in
[1:24:23] this plan that God has laid out in my
[1:24:25] generation I don't have to worry about
[1:24:27] going so far being deceived drugged off
[1:24:30] and pitched in a pit somewhere I can
[1:24:32] stand with full confidence this is all
[1:24:34] part of the plan of God that has been
[1:24:36] unfolding and unfolding all the way from
[1:24:39] the foundation before the foundation of
[1:24:41] the world amen to know that we are part
[1:24:44] of God's plan hallelujah oh my oh my oh
[1:24:48] my you see what it is it's bringing to
[1:24:51] pass my brother and sister the prophecy
[1:24:54] of the Word of God coming to our day and
[1:24:56] you see oh not only did God record the
[1:25:01] name on the lamb book of life he put the
[1:25:03] lamb right there to be slain amen now
[1:25:06] look at this I love this watch him
[1:25:10] there'll be a lot of impersonation a lot
[1:25:12] of everything else but there was really
[1:25:15] somebody was going to be saved
[1:25:18] really was somebody going to be saved
[1:25:20] it's not an abstract my brother and
[1:25:22] sister it's not a theory if you go into
[1:25:26] some of the definitions of manifested on
[1:25:31] the Internet
[1:25:31] some of them are talking about theories
[1:25:34] coming to pass and different things like
[1:25:36] that this was not a theory this were
[1:25:39] this was a plan of God not a theory that
[1:25:41] this will work not a theory my brother
[1:25:43] and sister met hundreds upon hundreds of
[1:25:46] thousands are going to die in the United
[1:25:47] States and they're going to be littering
[1:25:48] the streets it's not a theory of what
[1:25:50] this is going to happen here this is a
[1:25:52] plan of God and God said in the latter
[1:25:54] times that they would even be plagues
[1:25:56] come upon the people they would be
[1:25:58] curses come upon them because they
[1:25:59] rejected God my brother and sister they
[1:26:02] can go for all the vaccines they want
[1:26:04] and they might even be allowed by God to
[1:26:06] develop one to come forth and say look
[1:26:08] what we have done but here again taking
[1:26:11] it back like it was in World War one if
[1:26:13] God does not ordain the time in this
[1:26:15] season it'll just mutate beyond their
[1:26:18] vaccine and mutate beyond their vaccine
[1:26:20] and as many will die my brother and
[1:26:22] sister as was ordained to die just as it
[1:26:25] was in the wilderness when the brazen
[1:26:27] serpent was raised up my brother and
[1:26:28] sister if they refuse to look back to
[1:26:31] the brazen serpent sin already judged if
[1:26:35] they refuse to look back they died so
[1:26:37] even though some people say well how
[1:26:40] could that be but even though the brazen
[1:26:42] serpent being present in their myths
[1:26:44] many refused to look Oh hallelujah well
[1:26:50] I've seen a little cartoon and I forget
[1:26:54] the words it was on it
[1:26:56] you know covent that guy sitting a
[1:26:59] little booth kovat 19 or something you
[1:27:01] know you know the end is coming death
[1:27:05] and whatever come you know here get your
[1:27:08] deal in a big long line
[1:27:09] booth right beside it Jesus is coming
[1:27:12] come and it's empty you see the people
[1:27:15] right now now this is gonna be a little
[1:27:17] harsh forgive me
[1:27:18] but there's people around the message
[1:27:20] that what's coming it might not be
[1:27:23] really what's in their heart but what's
[1:27:24] coming out of their mouth is we're
[1:27:25] terrified of this virus well hallelujah
[1:27:29] I might die today I'll just put that
[1:27:31] corner
[1:27:32] so people just don't have to get too
[1:27:33] upset sister Jerry will bet she'll get
[1:27:36] over my brother and sister I can't die
[1:27:39] one second before God ordains it my if
[1:27:45] God had so much confidence in his own
[1:27:48] power to let Daniel his prophet be
[1:27:51] throwed in a lion's den he didn't go
[1:27:53] down there and put a brick mason in
[1:27:54] there first he didn't go put up a wire
[1:27:56] fence
[1:27:57] he didn't give Daniel you know some kind
[1:28:00] of high voltage shocking whatever to
[1:28:02] defend himself God Himself come right
[1:28:06] down there now my brother and sister the
[1:28:09] Holy Ghost wasn't given yet but that was
[1:28:10] the presence of Almighty God we could
[1:28:12] stand today and say that was a Holy
[1:28:14] Spirit that was protecting Daniel in
[1:28:16] that lion's den the angel of the Lord
[1:28:18] come right down there Daniel didn't go
[1:28:20] down there and say well Lord you know I
[1:28:22] hope this lion only stop and bless his
[1:28:24] food before he eats it Daniel said Lord
[1:28:26] thy will be done and that's why I say
[1:28:28] today if I don't live through this day
[1:28:31] I'm not concerned about it because God's
[1:28:34] will be done
[1:28:35] but my brother and sister I refuse to
[1:28:37] allow myself to be infected with the
[1:28:40] virus of fear that came from the pits of
[1:28:42] hell while I hold on to the message with
[1:28:45] one hand and I terrified of what's going
[1:28:48] on on the earth on the other hand come
[1:28:50] on my brother and sister let's get the
[1:28:52] blood over the doorpost let's get the
[1:28:54] blood on the post and the lentil let's
[1:28:56] not stand back and say well if this and
[1:28:59] if that no should we wash our hands
[1:29:01] should you not shake hands with people
[1:29:02] that you know you don't know and and you
[1:29:04] know do all these kind I'm talking
[1:29:06] common sense here but my brother and
[1:29:08] sisters some people are possessed with a
[1:29:10] fear and that's fear won't end with this
[1:29:13] virus because there'll be something that
[1:29:15] will come on the earth right behind this
[1:29:16] and they'll be run right behind that and
[1:29:18] one right behind that and pretty soon
[1:29:20] they'll be tiptoeing instead of walking
[1:29:22] around like a conqueror Oh hallelujah
[1:29:25] so if I die today or tomorrow people
[1:29:27] will be able to say well we think Paul
[1:29:29] was wrong that's fine I just beat you to
[1:29:31] glory is all you look at it any way you
[1:29:33] want I just beat you there you should be
[1:29:35] jealous hallelujah
[1:29:43] the church was predestinated to be
[1:29:45] without spot or wrinkle did I hear that
[1:29:46] word right
[1:29:47] the church was predestinated God didn't
[1:29:50] say I now I just hope that there is a
[1:29:52] church that does not have spot or
[1:29:54] wrinkle I'm hoping that somehow this
[1:29:56] will work out that they really show up a
[1:29:59] church that has not been tarnished by
[1:30:01] Laodicea no my brother and sister the
[1:30:03] prophet of God said the church was torn
[1:30:05] was predestinated I mean to be without
[1:30:07] spot or wrinkle she is going to be there
[1:30:12] now I've become kind of a realist you
[1:30:14] might say when I read these things a
[1:30:16] prophet of God said because if he was
[1:30:18] just merely bantering words and then we
[1:30:20] can get right down to the very very
[1:30:22] serious things of the gospel and just
[1:30:25] decide that he was just kind of throwing
[1:30:26] out some kind of phraseology so when
[1:30:29] he's talking about this predestinated to
[1:30:31] be without spot or wrinkle now you can
[1:30:34] say well I'm a son of God I'm a daughter
[1:30:36] of God I believe in predestination I
[1:30:37] believe we could all lift a hand on her
[1:30:39] head do whatever you want to do I
[1:30:40] believe in predestination my brother and
[1:30:43] sister how about you believe in
[1:30:44] predestination it won't be just you'll
[1:30:46] see the word for this day but if that
[1:30:48] word that you saw will produce a church
[1:30:51] a people without a spot or a wrinkle in
[1:30:56] their life Oh hallelujah I don't know if
[1:30:58] that's possible brother Paul I'm human
[1:31:00] well I'm gonna say here right now and
[1:31:01] say I believe it's possible because he
[1:31:03] said it hey man I don't have to bring it
[1:31:06] to pass I don't have to manufacture this
[1:31:08] I don't have to go out and talk to the
[1:31:10] little sheep every day now you push out
[1:31:11] a little bit of wool today my brother
[1:31:13] and sister it's just gonna happen
[1:31:15] because God said it hallelujah amen
[1:31:17] she's going to be there and then lamb
[1:31:21] died for that purpose Oh hallelujah
[1:31:24] don't you just love this Amen brother
[1:31:27] branham I I won't go ahead and preach on
[1:31:29] that time is fleeting brother I'm
[1:31:31] talking about the three stages of grace
[1:31:32] my brother and sister God's grace is
[1:31:34] sufficient amen when the last name on
[1:31:37] that book is redeemed the lamb come
[1:31:38] forth took the book I'm the one that did
[1:31:40] it the angels cherubims four and twenty
[1:31:42] elders beasts everything uncrowned
[1:31:44] themselves and fell down before the
[1:31:45] throne and said worthy art thou John
[1:31:48] said everything in heaven and earth
[1:31:50] heard me hollering oh I tell you what
[1:31:53] I'd like to have some brothers like John
[1:31:55] in the church
[1:31:56] I'd like to have some people that when
[1:31:57] they saw their name saw they were part
[1:31:59] of this great plan of redemption that
[1:32:01] they just hollered so loud it shook the
[1:32:03] heavens I tell you I'm not speaking down
[1:32:06] to you folks come on this morning but
[1:32:08] I'm telling you this is a monumental
[1:32:10] moment this is an incredible thing that
[1:32:12] God has done that all of the sickness
[1:32:15] and the sin and all the unbelief and all
[1:32:17] the circumstance and God just raised you
[1:32:19] right above that said you don't have to
[1:32:21] wallow down there just trust me and ask
[1:32:24] and just raise up come come right up
[1:32:26] here into heavenly places and rejoice
[1:32:28] for what I've done for you it's already
[1:32:31] finished hallelujah oh hey men screaming
[1:32:35] hallelujah and praises to God the scream
[1:32:37] went up why their names was in that book
[1:32:40] to be revealed and the lamb had revealed
[1:32:43] it all my brother and sister you see God
[1:32:48] has opened his plan of redemption to us
[1:32:51] we are not sitting here as a great
[1:32:53] mystery of what happens next
[1:32:55] come on Saints oh there will be those
[1:32:58] that are the critical thinkers and
[1:32:59] they'll say well Paul you don't know
[1:33:01] what's happening next oh no I do I do
[1:33:03] know what's happening next
[1:33:05] I'm gonna go day by day I'm gonna walk
[1:33:07] right down through this this stage of
[1:33:10] life and day by day I'm gonna be filled
[1:33:12] more and more and I'm gonna have more
[1:33:14] confidence I'm gonna have for coming
[1:33:16] power I'm gonna realize the sword that's
[1:33:18] been placed in my hand was for me to use
[1:33:21] against the enemy not just pack around
[1:33:23] and rattle against my boot amen and not
[1:33:25] next step will be another step and I'll
[1:33:27] come up with more authority I'll come
[1:33:29] and the word we'll be opening up more
[1:33:31] and more and more Holy Ghost flowing in
[1:33:33] and the next step I know what's going to
[1:33:35] happen my brother and sister and
[1:33:37] rapturing faith is going to be poured on
[1:33:39] us like a bucket ice water no it isn't
[1:33:41] my brother and sister it's going to be
[1:33:42] poured into you just one little bit at a
[1:33:45] time until the day comes when you need
[1:33:48] to be able to speak that delivering word
[1:33:50] and you'll come right out of your mouth
[1:33:52] and you'll say mountain be removed and
[1:33:54] it will come to pass and you won't be
[1:33:56] saying yes sir I knew it you'll be
[1:33:59] saying thank you Lord the power of God
[1:34:03] coming down and I tell you my brother
[1:34:05] and sister I know what it'll be I'm not
[1:34:07] concerned there's people like well if
[1:34:09] you think you know when
[1:34:10] coming when is he coming back that's not
[1:34:12] my problem all I've got to do is step
[1:34:14] into my correct position and let the
[1:34:16] Word of God flow into me
[1:34:18] the power of God flowing in and me
[1:34:20] saying thank you lord thank you lord and
[1:34:22] I'm growing and I'm growing and I'm
[1:34:24] growing and one of the things I
[1:34:26] appreciate about brother Ron Spencer and
[1:34:28] he spoke it for years and it resonate
[1:34:30] with me is that a that we come to the
[1:34:33] place that we can stand and say boo
[1:34:36] devil I don't have to be scared of you I
[1:34:39] don't have to dodge you I don't have to
[1:34:42] do this it's you that's got to get out
[1:34:44] of my way
[1:34:46] it's you that will be placed according
[1:34:48] to the word under my feet hallelujah
[1:34:51] we're not placed under Satan's feet he's
[1:34:53] placed under our feet and this my
[1:34:55] brother and sister is what happens when
[1:34:58] we recognize who we are in the plan of
[1:35:01] redemption if you're a church goer go to
[1:35:04] church hallelujah but I'm not just a
[1:35:09] churchgoer I don't believe you were just
[1:35:11] a churchgoer we are sons of the king and
[1:35:14] as I spoke to you here a few Sundays ago
[1:35:17] we have got the DNA of the King of Kings
[1:35:21] of God all mighty yellow him we've got
[1:35:24] his DNA in us and that DNA automatically
[1:35:29] makes you and I an overcomer hallelujah
[1:35:32] all the brother Paul if you only knew
[1:35:34] the challenges I was facing I don't know
[1:35:36] the challenges you face I don't know
[1:35:38] what's going on in your life I don't
[1:35:40] know whether you got two cents or two
[1:35:42] million in the bank account it doesn't
[1:35:44] matter to me
[1:35:45] this word is true and I believe it and
[1:35:47] if you only got two cents do like that
[1:35:49] little woman and go throw them in the
[1:35:51] offering and then ask for God's
[1:35:52] blessings for your faithfulness my
[1:35:54] brother and sister it's not about our
[1:35:56] natural security blanket that we have
[1:35:59] developed and got sitting down here and
[1:36:01] the First National Bank of whatever we
[1:36:03] need to have something in the First
[1:36:05] National Bank of glory hallelujah and
[1:36:08] it's there you can draw on that deposit
[1:36:10] and God will work in your life
[1:36:12] oh my oh my as there were my brother and
[1:36:15] sister and the writing of the book of
[1:36:17] Redemption the author declared it was
[1:36:20] finished but I don't think he put a
[1:36:22] period there
[1:36:24] that's finished don't worry about it's
[1:36:25] all done you see now it's got to be
[1:36:28] manifested now it's got to have somebody
[1:36:31] that was ordained or predestinate as we
[1:36:33] just read that's gonna step out in
[1:36:35] laodicea and say God's Word said it I
[1:36:38] believe it and I'm gonna overcome it I
[1:36:40] will come to the place I'll be able to
[1:36:42] stand before him and he will say well
[1:36:44] done my good and faithful servant he's
[1:36:47] not going to have to pull out this

[1:37:09] sisters sometimes we have to go down
[1:37:11] before we can go up amen
[1:37:14] sometimes we have to come to the place
[1:37:16] we're willing to submit to God before
[1:37:18] God can ever give us the authority
[1:37:21] hallelujah oh you know I I have a bad
[1:37:24] habit of throwing Jerry under the bus
[1:37:26] don't want to Easter to go by without at
[1:37:28] least trying you know when Jerry and I
[1:37:31] first got married I'm not trying to give
[1:37:35] an absolute example of this but when
[1:37:37] Jerry and I first got married I believe
[1:37:39] it was the first time in her life that
[1:37:40] she had Liberty and I just remember we'd
[1:37:44] been married for two or three months and
[1:37:46] one day I come home from work and
[1:37:48] there's these two huge envelopes on the
[1:37:50] counter in our house and I asked her
[1:37:53] what are those and she kind of him hard
[1:37:55] around or like well I went over and
[1:37:58] picked it up they were both from the
[1:38:00] bank and I saw my goodness them big
[1:38:02] thick envelopes and back in them days I
[1:38:05] used to use that sticky stuff where you
[1:38:07] could peel the envelope open and then
[1:38:08] seal it back up and I peeled that thing
[1:38:10] open and and here's check after check
[1:38:13] after check what was the least amount
[1:38:16] Jerry it was like 60 58 cents she wrote
[1:38:20] a check for 58 cents and even 36 years
[1:38:23] ago 58 cents wasn't much money but you
[1:38:29] see she caught the revelation that her
[1:38:32] name was good on that check
[1:38:37] she caught my brother and sister oh I
[1:38:39] hope you see this today let a little
[1:38:41] humor a rock in your life today she
[1:38:44] caught the revelation that it wasn't
[1:38:46] only for big things I can write a check
[1:38:49] it isn't that I've got cancer and I'm
[1:38:52] dying I can write a check it might be
[1:38:54] that you're just troubled by a spirit or
[1:38:56] even something that you don't understand
[1:38:58] in the word and you can say Lord I'm
[1:39:00] writing a check today

[1:39:07] everybody knows John 3:16 if you know
[1:39:09] know it you don't know it all you got to
[1:39:11] do is say Lord I'm writing a check
[1:39:13] because I want to understand that oh my
[1:39:15] brother and sister she caught that
[1:39:16] revelation she went here mostly she
[1:39:19] walked amen back in those days we
[1:39:21] actually lived in the edge of town she
[1:39:22] just walked right down into town and go

[1:40:12] for fifty eight cents you need God just
[1:40:15] to come maybe you're not sleeping well
[1:40:17] at night got some pain in your body
[1:40:21] write the check write the check the plan
[1:40:24] of redemption included you having a
[1:40:27] checkbook a prophet of God clearly
[1:40:29] showed us that write the check make your
[1:40:32] claim hallelujah because you see my
[1:40:37] brother and sister we I believe are in
[1:40:39] this season of the manifestation of the
[1:40:42] spoken word and there's got to be a time
[1:40:44] we are not going my brother and sister
[1:40:46] to step from nothing at all no faith at
[1:40:48] all to fit
[1:40:50] Mountains God wants you to exercise the
[1:40:53] plan of redemption has a plan for you to
[1:40:56] learn how to fly mother Eagle Oh what
[1:40:59] does she do she goes right up there I
[1:41:01] love how brother branham describes that
[1:41:03] he gets them little eaglets to clamp on
[1:41:05] she takes them out there and shakes him
[1:41:07] off and they're just falling like
[1:41:09] whatever they're there squawking and
[1:41:11] tumbling and whatever and she comes and
[1:41:13] she gathers them up again and she takes
[1:41:16] him up and she does this over and over
[1:41:17] again and I'm telling you my brother and
[1:41:19] sister where the carcass is the Eagles
[1:41:21] will be gathered but these aren't ground
[1:41:24] burden to eagles these are not Eagles
[1:41:26] that walk everywhere they go and they're
[1:41:29] going along they're looking at some road
[1:41:31] map saying well okay if I go down here
[1:41:32] twelve miles turn left and go over here
[1:41:35] climb over the hill there'll be a
[1:41:36] carcass there these are eagles that God
[1:41:39] trained to fly and when they get that
[1:41:41] revelation that they can fly and they
[1:41:44] see the carcass what is it they thrill
[1:41:46] they would rather fly and then sit on
[1:41:48] the earth they would rather fly in the
[1:41:50] heavenlies than sit on a tree limb and
[1:41:53] squawk at each other but we've got to
[1:41:55] catch the revelation that we were born
[1:41:57] to fly and that we are Eagles that we
[1:42:00] can write the check amen hallelujah oh
[1:42:03] you know what this might be a strong
[1:42:05] statement but I don't believe we can say
[1:42:07] that we've received redemption if there
[1:42:10] is no manifestation if we have not one
[1:42:13] bit of evidence that God has come and
[1:42:16] redeemed us and it's changed our life if
[1:42:18] we still got that old Bulldog nature
[1:42:21] we're going to plow through nobody can
[1:42:23] hold a conversation with you because
[1:42:24] you're always right and you you get
[1:42:26] dominate everything around my brother
[1:42:28] and sister I don't think you can say
[1:42:30] that you've received a Redemption if you
[1:42:32] don't have the manifestation of the
[1:42:34] nature now brother Branham said in God's
[1:42:36] a provided place of worship amen
[1:42:39] did we skip over that no it's right here
[1:42:42] God's provided place of worship amen
[1:42:45] so what's brother Brown say here in
[1:42:48] paragraph two oh eight but I just want
[1:42:50] to jump right down here brother I
[1:42:52] haven't got it right on on par there and
[1:42:54] I find out a better results he's talking
[1:42:56] about the prayer line and and laboring
[1:42:59] and struggling to pray over these and he
[1:43:01] says you know
[1:43:04] I find out better results by just
[1:43:07] getting myself into God's arms and
[1:43:09] saying Lord God you promised it it's
[1:43:11] your promise it's not mine it's yours
[1:43:13] you promised you would do it and I've
[1:43:16] seen you do it see the prophet of God
[1:43:18] speaking my brother and sister here in
[1:43:21] this you can go to paragraph 208 if you
[1:43:23] want to find a reference on that later
[1:43:25] but my brother and sister you look at
[1:43:27] that see the Prophet God's talking about
[1:43:28] how when he used to labor under this and
[1:43:31] under that now he's just settled himself
[1:43:33] back in God's arms and he's just like
[1:43:36] Lord it's your gift you made the promise
[1:43:37] to these people you're the one that's
[1:43:39] gonna make it pass and now he's just
[1:43:41] doing it and he says and I find better
[1:43:43] results by just getting myself Oh
[1:43:47] who wants results we can get some
[1:43:50] results my brother and sister we can get
[1:43:51] better results it will just get
[1:43:53] ourselves into God's arms let's go over
[1:43:56] there not stand off and say now Lord you
[1:43:59] got to prove this to me just get in his
[1:44:02] arms don't you love it I as a
[1:44:04] grandfather as a grandfather I can
[1:44:06] relate to this even Aliyah she's growing
[1:44:09] up now turning into a big girl on me but
[1:44:11] you know what there's nothing I thrills
[1:44:13] my heart more than to have my
[1:44:14] grandchildren kind of either sitting on
[1:44:16] the arm of the chair or in my lap and I
[1:44:18] can get my arms around them and hold
[1:44:21] them there's something that just
[1:44:23] energizes my soul something that right
[1:44:26] down to the very depths of me that this
[1:44:28] is a gift God gave me my brother and
[1:44:30] sister when we come to the place we can
[1:44:32] lay our self in God's arms and just
[1:44:34] receive what he's got Oh hallelujah and
[1:44:37] I'm going to believe you're going to do
[1:44:39] it because I've been baptized into your
[1:44:42] body in your spirit here to identify
[1:44:44] that's the truth amen
[1:44:45] that's the place of worship then you get
[1:44:48] into a place all things are possible
[1:44:51] then you get into place that that your
[1:44:54] motives your objectives for your
[1:44:56] achievements it's just exactly in the
[1:44:58] will of God and when you lay your hands
[1:45:00] there and believe it it's going to
[1:45:02] happen can we say amen to that today and
[1:45:05] believe that amen when we get to that
[1:45:08] place that all the things that we're
[1:45:10] wanting to do what we're trying to
[1:45:12] accomplish and all of that we just get
[1:45:14] it exactly into God's will and then you
[1:45:16] just start coming
[1:45:17] place I believe it I believe it prophet
[1:45:21] of God says did you believe that
[1:45:22] congregation said Amen hallelujah oh my
[1:45:28] I'm gonna run out of time here this
[1:45:30] morning in that terrible do it all the
[1:45:31] time well hallelujah someday someday as
[1:45:37] we as humans you know we'll be able to
[1:45:40] the Lord of this give us a bigger gas
[1:45:42] tank hallelujah instead of putting in 20
[1:45:45] gallons we'll be able to put in 120 when
[1:45:48] you read and comprehend Hebrews 11 and
[1:45:51] all that is contained in Hebrews 11
[1:45:54] lovely chapter you know we call it the
[1:45:56] faith chapter but in that when you read
[1:45:59] all of Hebrews 11 you are getting the
[1:46:03] thumbnail view of every trial every
[1:46:06] temptation every struggle and ever
[1:46:09] overcoming event that took place in
[1:46:12] these people's lives all that's
[1:46:14] contained there the trials and the
[1:46:16] victories those that gave their lives
[1:46:18] and those as the scripture said those
[1:46:20] women whose children were raised from
[1:46:23] the dead you see we we see it all right
[1:46:26] there amen and Hebrews eleven forty
[1:46:29] years referenced earlier in a quote
[1:46:31] their God having provided some better
[1:46:33] thing for us that they without us should
[1:46:36] not be made perfect you see what we have
[1:46:41] in this day my brother and sister is you
[1:46:43] might say a final ingredient to the Word
[1:46:47] of God the plan of redemption as it
[1:46:50] encompassed all of mankind through the
[1:46:53] ages the plan of redemption needed one
[1:46:55] last little something to make it perfect
[1:46:58] and that was you and I and we are here
[1:47:02] in a very unique time because we're
[1:47:04] seeing a mixture of all the spirits of
[1:47:07] all the church ages we're seeing all of
[1:47:09] this mixed together the greatest
[1:47:11] religious spirits of all time the
[1:47:13] greatest deceptive spirits of all time
[1:47:16] and we're seeing it all blended together
[1:47:18] and when I say of all time my brother
[1:47:20] and sister that means that the word in
[1:47:23] this day is stronger than anything that
[1:47:26] Satan can offer so here we're coming
[1:47:28] down to the most deceptive time not
[1:47:31] there has to be a power being poured
[1:47:33] into the church part of the plan of
[1:47:35] redemption said right before this is all
[1:47:38] finished I'm going to pour such power
[1:47:40] into my church and they are going to
[1:47:43] believe that they have the authority to
[1:47:45] exercise that power and they will be
[1:47:48] able my brother and sister to speak and
[1:47:50] it will happen now you say brother Paul
[1:47:52] I just don't see that certainly it's
[1:47:54] happened in my life well you just keep
[1:47:56] claiming it you don't talk about the
[1:47:57] negative you know speak about what you
[1:47:59] see speak what the word has declared to
[1:48:02] you because they without us should not
[1:48:04] be made perfect I'll tell you this
[1:48:07] morning my brother and sisters I want
[1:48:09] them to be perfect I want them to be
[1:48:11] perfect that means you and I will
[1:48:13] fulfill our calling in this word in this
[1:48:17] day what I would say our calling in the
[1:48:19] message hallelujah now in the message
[1:48:22] their token brother Branham says now
[1:48:25] there's Easter Sunday I don't like to
[1:48:27] claim exemptions amen I tried to reign
[1:48:30] you know myself back brother David back
[1:48:32] sometimes because we we preach too long
[1:48:34] but if you just give me an X or a few
[1:48:37] minutes maybe this morning amen in the
[1:48:40] token brother Brown says we're not to
[1:48:43] come together to talk about the message
[1:48:47] now that doesn't mean we can't get
[1:48:49] together and talk about the message but
[1:48:50] look what he's saying we're not to come
[1:48:52] together to talk about the message we
[1:48:54] are come together to get in the message
[1:48:57] and the message is Christ he is the word
[1:49:03] that's right we're to get into it get
[1:49:07] beneath it yes sir that's what we're
[1:49:09] supposed to do he was not responsible
[1:49:13] this is talking about now in Egypt and
[1:49:16] the blood on the doorpost on the lentil
[1:49:18] this is so you go back in the token
[1:49:20] you'll find where brother was talking
[1:49:22] about that amen he was not responsible
[1:49:25] for any person out from under the blood
[1:49:27] not one no matter who he was he was not
[1:49:31] responsible all he had to do take not
[1:49:33] only himself but his whole family they
[1:49:35] were only safe when the token was
[1:49:39] displayed look when the token go back
[1:49:44] you'll find them what is that
[1:49:45] when it means the same synonym you're
[1:49:50] gonna find amen
[1:49:53] hope this won't offend nobody there only
[1:49:56] safe when the token was manifested oh
[1:50:02] you can say whatever you want to say and
[1:50:05] you can know whoever you want to know
[1:50:07] but my brother and sister if the blood
[1:50:10] was not displayed the Death Angel didn't
[1:50:16] stop and say you're friends with who
[1:50:19] you've been in church how long the blood
[1:50:24] was either there all my brother and
[1:50:28] sister we cannot feel safe until this
[1:50:32] token is displayed you go back right
[1:50:36] back to the old Webster and you'll find
[1:50:38] that it's a direct correlation
[1:50:39] manifested and displayed go together we
[1:50:43] cannot feel safe until this token is
[1:50:46] manifested it's displayed that's right
[1:50:50] you must come under this token God's
[1:50:52] Holy Spirit and it displays to you hmm
[1:50:56] can I keep interchanging nobody get
[1:50:58] offended there's nobody here to be
[1:51:00] offended I guess so hopefully you're not
[1:51:02] offended out there and it manifests to
[1:51:05] you Jesus Christ in other words it
[1:51:08] displace Christ to you not just
[1:51:12] something we talked about your message
[1:51:14] believers praise God sent a prophet good
[1:51:17] he sent a prophet where's the
[1:51:18] manifestation where is the display of
[1:51:21] what God did oh my I spoiled that didn't
[1:51:26] I kind of got a little negative for a
[1:51:28] moment and it displays to you Jesus
[1:51:33] Christ because it comes and lives in you
[1:51:36] wait this is saying the Holy Spirit's
[1:51:40] living in us it's Jesus Christ right
[1:51:43] because he said right up here at the top
[1:51:44] of the quote am i right he said right
[1:51:48] here we always wonder what the message
[1:51:49] is the message is Christ I think that
[1:51:55] ought to be simple enough if we want to
[1:51:56] describe somebody what is the message
[1:51:58] Jesus Christ hmm my well I've been told
[1:52:05] for quite a while now say what the
[1:52:06] Prophet said hallelujah we can all feel
[1:52:11] safe until this token is played that's
[1:52:12] right
[1:52:12] you must come under this token God's
[1:52:14] holy spirit and it displays to you Jesus
[1:52:16] Christ because it comes and lives in you
[1:52:18] as I said last night and up in New York
[1:52:21] at one of the message if I told you that
[1:52:23] Shakespeare lived in me I would do the
[1:52:26] works of Shakespeare because I couldn't
[1:52:28] help it I'm no more myself I am dead
[1:52:30] Shakespeare and I can't live together in
[1:52:32] here Shakespeare was a poet and I'm a
[1:52:34] minister we can't live together amen but
[1:52:39] I am dead to myself then and Shakespeare
[1:52:41] lives in me the works of Shakespeare
[1:52:42] I'll do the life of Shakespeare and me
[1:52:45] will be lived out like Shakespeare if
[1:52:48] the life the Beethoven is lived in me I
[1:52:51] would be like the Tobin if the life of
[1:52:54] John Dillinger lived in me I would be
[1:52:56] John Dillinger that's right and if the
[1:52:59] life of Jesus Christ lives in the person
[1:53:02] they become identified with him its
[1:53:07] Christ in you not a church member not a
[1:53:09] system but a resurrected power can
[1:53:13] someone say amen to that
[1:53:14] hallelujah it's the Holy Ghost is a
[1:53:17] token upon you that your life says amen
[1:53:20] to every scripture the promise is
[1:53:22] written in here and you are not yourself
[1:53:24] no more oh I'll tell you my brother and
[1:53:27] sister this just strikes home because we
[1:53:29] all in vocabulary use this but some
[1:53:32] people really mean it your Christ you
[1:53:34] don't think your thoughts you don't
[1:53:36] think your thoughts you say I that was
[1:53:39] in cry I think yeah you don't think your
[1:53:44] thoughts you say I think you got no
[1:53:47] thoughts coming nah hmm good we all say
[1:53:51] that I think how many times have we done
[1:53:53] that I think well praise the Lord if you
[1:53:56] think the bolt should go from the bottom
[1:53:57] up or the top down
[1:53:59] that's fine my brother and sister it
[1:54:01] really should go from the top down
[1:54:02] because then if the nut falls off at
[1:54:04] least the bolt will stay there hmm
[1:54:07] there's a reason behind some of this
[1:54:08] engineering isn't there
[1:54:11] but it's not up to what we think you
[1:54:15] don't think your thoughts you don't
[1:54:16] think your thoughts you say I think you
[1:54:18] have no thought coming the life that was
[1:54:20] in Christ is in you the mind that was in
[1:54:23] Christ is in you the works that was in
[1:54:25] Christ is in you and Christ himself is
[1:54:28] in you and you are dead your life is
[1:54:33] hidden God through Christ sealed in
[1:54:35] there by the Holy Ghost you are not your
[1:54:39] own hallelujah the whole plan of
[1:54:42] redemption my brother and sister wasn't
[1:54:44] to produce a bunch of Christians that
[1:54:47] went around saying I think I know III we
[1:54:51] are nothing he is everything and what I
[1:54:56] am is because Christ is in me you say
[1:54:59] well brother Paul there's people in the
[1:55:01] world they have their wisdom they have
[1:55:03] their deal they're successful that's
[1:55:04] right my brother and sister the Word of
[1:55:06] God clearly covers that it shows where
[1:55:08] the Spirit come from it shows what their
[1:55:10] motive is it shows what their objective
[1:55:12] is why would you compare yourself to the
[1:55:15] world they are of their seed you are of
[1:55:18] the royal seed and the royal seed flows
[1:55:21] through our veins the DNA of Jesus
[1:55:24] Christ is in us I say Lord I want to be
[1:55:28] what you have said I would be and I want
[1:55:32] the nature so Lord I want to see
[1:55:35] redemption manifested in me that I can
[1:55:39] put you Lord on display hallelujah oh my
[1:55:43] brother and sister I tell you what I
[1:55:45] just get so excited about these things
[1:55:47] oh praise the Lord sister Amy would you
[1:55:50] come amen brother Shawn I just think we
[1:55:53] I've got some other notes here but we're
[1:55:55] just going to stop right there amen
[1:55:58] you say what you're going to do right
[1:56:00] here I do want to finish the last of
[1:56:02] this little quote here on the token amen
[1:56:06] so look here he says you're not yourself
[1:56:08] no more your Christ see it's not
[1:56:11] responsible for anybody the whole family
[1:56:13] must be brought into the token must be
[1:56:15] splayed it had to be if it wasn't
[1:56:17] displayed then it was of none effect you
[1:56:20] could believe in it you could say oh yes
[1:56:22] I believe it but that didn't do it
[1:56:26] you say well well I'll tell you what
[1:56:28] I'll do I'll put it in a bucket speaking
[1:56:30] of the blood I'll set it over here on
[1:56:32] the wall but really I think as long as I
[1:56:35] have it in here if I have the blood over
[1:56:38] here no sir you can't be a secret boy
[1:56:41] about it no sir
[1:56:42] you've got to have it you've got to have
[1:56:45] it on display that was the purpose of
[1:56:50] putting it on the door so he could see
[1:56:52] it on the lintel and on the doorpost
[1:56:54] once again I want to drive this home not
[1:56:57] very close that very relationship
[1:57:01] between display and manifest it's
[1:57:05] something you're not ashamed of you want
[1:57:07] the whole world to know that you are
[1:57:09] dead and your life is hid in God through
[1:57:12] Christ my brother and sister you see our
[1:57:20] Lord Jesus death burial resurrection was
[1:57:23] much more than just something for us to
[1:57:25] preach on once a year it's much more
[1:57:28] than just something that we would come
[1:57:30] in a certain season it's a very life of
[1:57:33] the bride of Jesus Christ it is who she
[1:57:38] is
[1:57:38] amen we are dead
[1:57:43] and buried in our life is hid in Jesus
[1:57:48] Christ hallelujah brother Jason would
[1:57:52] you just come and help us I just when I
[1:57:54] was studying this morning I found myself
[1:57:56] singing onward Christian soldiers you
[1:58:00] know I think about that I get excited
[1:58:02] when I think about the prophet of God as
[1:58:04] he's there and he's looking at the bride
[1:58:08] saw that vision and he sees the bride
[1:58:10] going and as she comes around that
[1:58:13] second time she starts to go up and
[1:58:16] she's singing onward Christian soldier
[1:58:19] my brother's sister I get excited about
[1:58:21] it because I believe he actually saw me
[1:58:23] I believe I was right there in that row
[1:58:25] then that midst of that bride maybe if
[1:58:28] God was to segregate it down by nation
[1:58:30] maybe within the nation there would be
[1:58:32] the states and the churches that were
[1:58:33] there I don't know exactly but I believe
[1:58:36] that he saw me in I'm gonna lay a hold
