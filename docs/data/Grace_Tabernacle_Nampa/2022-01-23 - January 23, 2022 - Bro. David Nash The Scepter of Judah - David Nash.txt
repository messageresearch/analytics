got a cough drop here i'm crunching so give me just a second everybody's going around they got the scratchy throats and all that and we just came up from texas a few days ago and down there it's you know i hate to tell you this but it was 82 degrees one day and [Laughter] and and humid right because it's texas and when just before that we'd been well spent about three weeks in central america which is also warm and humid and then went from that to ohio where it was freezing cold why do people live there and from there to michigan which was worse i just well praise the lord are you happy to be a christian this morning i'm happy to be a christian and happy to be back before i actually get started uh don't go away just just we'll because we're i want to just speak for a few minutes before we actually get into the message a lot of things going on you know not just here but there and worldwide and sometimes we get confused and wonder you know what is happening what is going on and i wanted to read a scripture and it's in second corinthians i ask brother jason i showed him the notes and i don't know if some of you know me and i said y'all want this one which is the you know the shorter version or do you i've added two more scriptures to this page which is the he said the five hour version i said well maybe two and a half so i'm sure brother paul understands and thank you for the invitation to be here this morning brother god bless you but in ii corinthians it's not such that hasn't happened before to certain people in different ways it's the fourth chapter i hope i think we got the right one written down i believe it's the eighth verse you know actually that started the seventh he says but we have this treasure in earth and vessel so that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us it was a good song we just were singing there that uh we're not the responsibility he is we're just the ones i remember it was brother williams years ago said when he was talking about marriage and i've used it many times since then he said some people say well it's 50 50. some people say well it's 70 80 or you know did they got all these different numbers and i liked what he said marriage is 100 and it's remember that christ is number one and we're the two little zeros and it's the same way in a marriage with christ we're just the little zeroes he's number one he is our everything he is our all and we're the little zeros but i went to a bank here a while back and there you know the the teller said something about well the zero's nothing i said then why don't you add a few more onto the deposit she wouldn't do it i don't understand but if it's nothing then why are they so important and that's how it is to god he's the number one and we're just the little zeros but to him you're important so important that he gave his own life and he continues to give it day by day hour by hour moment by moment that we might be like him so he says we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency in the power of god and not or may be of god and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always a bearing always bearing about in the body the dying of our lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest where in our bodies are you perplexed are you wondering what's going on is there is there trouble anywhere is that how the song goes absolutely and so i just wanted to just like i said i don't know we may get to the long one yet brother uh what's been happening and we know it's been happening all along but uh you know a year and a half two years ago roughly now the devil decided you know his time's about up and just like any good runner good good athlete good skier what diver what swimmer whatever it is you always try to save just that extra little to get you across the finish line and to win your battle and with the the thing that people call covet in this country and central america everybody just calls it the virus uh and all these other things the entire earth is being anointed with an antichrist spirit he is pouring it out with everything that he's got and you can say well how do you say that well we know that in the garden of eden when satan came to eve through the serpent he's all he said was thou shalt not surely die but the word said ye will surely die we know that eve received in her mind and then into her heart and then into her body that little not surely die and because of that we're in the condition that we are today and so satan is trying everything he can with this anointing whether it be by disease whether it be whatever it's antichrist the entire thing is an antichrist anointing and it's simple to see it when you see they say don't go to church wow i just read in the word that says you should be going more as you see the day approaching they say stay six feet away from each other and uh you know cover your face i don't like to say this but i've only found three or four places in the scripture where it talks about covering the face once is for the lepers and they have to stay six feet away from people and go around saying unclean unclean the other one was and if we get to it later if you see you all still want me to stay here you know said judah believe that tamar was a harlot because she had her face covered whoo and another one was when haman when they're getting ready to hang him and said they covered his face huh interesting stuff isn't it and how that you know they're telling us all to do these things and they're all just simple antichrist just just believe their word just believe they're not but i love what jesus christ does for us because if you go to where david in the bible he he done wrong he took a woman that wasn't his and had the man killed i mean that's pretty rough stuff and yet when the prophet came to him god in a fleshly body with the word of the lord to him and gave the little the story about the lamb brother branham when he was talking about this particular scene he said david proved that he still had righteousness in his heart because he gave the right judgment he said that man should die right judgment and the other thing about it was it's not only david that's involved in this it's the woman also that he's taken because the woman and the man had become one according to the law so it wasn't just david that was falling into this thing but the prophet came back and used the very words that the serpent used against eve and said david you'll not surely die exact same words at this time they were spoken by the grace of god by the word of god and the grace of god came on the scene he paid for it lost his kingdom all the things he went through but the grace of god is there for the believers brother sister we're perplexed there's sickness there's all kinds of things going on i mean the world is lit up brother branham again he said the whole world would go crazy before we get out of here it's got to be getting close that's all i can say because it's pretty crazy and so uh but how did this anointing and it wreaks havoc on individuals wreaks havoc on families it wreaks havoc on the streets i can't imagine i don't want to imagine what it would be like to be an unbeliever right now they are so tossed and ten and tempted and turned and most of them i'm amazed every once in a while i'll run into somebody that actually is still using their own brains uh you know and not you talk to them and they don't the first thing they do to see what google said about it or whoever you know but it's true but you see the righteousness of god is still dwelling in man by the holy ghost and so if you're perplexed and you're having trouble just know that the corinthians did too and they're waiting on you and i are just watching you and i as this picture plays out to the very end to where that we can speak and there's an old song i don't know if you would remember it but it's when you begin to see your loved ones walk around the ones that you've laid there in the ground you remember yeah an old time song it's a reality you'll be seeing them one of these days they're the bible in uh hebrews chapter 12 said they're here we are encompassed now by a great cloud of witnesses you might think you're just this little church but right here maybe just above the ceiling there's millions times millions going hang on believe the word of god press forward speak the word and every demon has to tremble resist the devil and he'll flee [Music] and when you have like abraham lincoln said you got nowhere else to go he said i go to my knees and on those knees or in your heart or wherever your altar is this morning say god remember me and just those words save to see a thief on the cross lord remember me so god bless you this morning as we should i close or can we shall we go ahead and can we sing that song i'm so used to singing in spanish lord you are so yes that's the one let's just stand and help me get loosened up a little bit the smiles are helping god bless you so many faces i see and know it's wonderful to be back oh lord you are so proud to me oh lord you are oppression to me and i love you yes i love you because you first loved me and i love you yes i love you because if first love leave their eyes closed sing it as a prayer oh lord [Music] are so precious to me oh lord you are so precious to me and i love you yes i love you because you first love me their eyes closed just think as you're singing i love you i love you there's some people somewhere a bride of christ singing yo te amo yo te amo there's another bride about as far away as you can get on this earth saying in madagascar africa i wish i could remember how to sing it lingala there's a bride of jesus christ that's there that's uniting around the word of god this morning and believing to receive the fullness of the promise of god not to die in the wilderness those who thought they were grasshoppers but to stand like joshua and caleb and said this land is mine let's just sing it one more time as we approach the word sing your heart so precious to me [Music] lord you are so precious to me and i love you yes i love you because you first loved me [Music] of you yes i love you because [Music] you first loved me praise the lord you feel better you can tell i've been in central america i started to sing in spanish it's a love song this whole relationship brother branham said nothing gets there but perfect love and it's a love affair with jesus christ not to keep you standing long let's turn thank you sister brother thank you uh to the other end of the book uh genesis we'll start with uh well i believe it's chapter 38. we'll start with chapter 38 of genesis uh but and it's probably most of people that read the bible will start with genesis and they do okay with that most of that and then when they get into other uh books they forget things thank you god bless you but uh so you're probably familiar with this it's the story of where uh judah had given tamar or his son with with tamar and the first son died second son died and the third son he was afraid to give it to him because he was one thing he was too young and he was worried that the third son might die so judah being the man that he was he tells his daughter to go remain a widow until the third son is ready and he can be the husband but things don't always work out the way we think they do and so we'll start with the 12th verse i believe it is and in process of time that this so it's uh 38 verse 12 and in process of time the daughter of shua judah's wife died was that my reading yeah and judah was comforted went up to the sheep shearers to timnath he and his friend hira the adult edualamite and it was told tamar saying behold thy father-in-law go with up to timnath to shear the sheep and she put her widow's garments fro off from her and covered her with a veil wrapped herself and sat down in an open place which is by the way to timnath for she saw that sheila was grown and she was not given unto him to wife when judah saw her he thought her to be a harlot because she had covered her face and he turned unto her by the way and said go pray thee let me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law and she said what will thou give be that thou mayest come in unto me he said i will send thee a kid from the flock and she said will thou give me a pledge till thou send it and he said what pledge shall i give thee watch what she asks for because this is the pledge this says he is giving these things by his word okay what pledge will that and uh she said the signet the bracelets and the staff that's in my hand and he gave it to her and he came in unto her and she conceived when she had received these things okay she conceived by him and she arose and went away and laid off or laid by her veil from her and put on the garments of her witterhood and judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the edualamite to perceive his pledge from the woman's hand but he found her not and if you drop down it says that when she's found to be with a child you can't hide those kind of things uh he said you know here's righteous jupiter right he said we're gonna same just like david we're going to kill this girl because the you know the work the law which scripturally speaking wasn't even written yet but they should have been killed and burnt with fire because he even says there in verse 24 let her be burnt when they bring her in in verse 25 and she was brought forth she sent to her father-in-law saying by the man whose these are i am with child and she said discern i pray thee whose these are the signet the bracelet and the staff and judah acknowledged them and said she hath been more righteous than i because that i gave her not to sheila my son and he knew her again no more so let's turn over to 49 which is actually happens after this verse 30 or chapter 38 and i know we've spoken from this particular scripture before from an entirely different angle and i just pray the lord will bless it to us today it's in verse or chapter 49 and it's the prophecy that uh jacob is prophesying over all his sons and such and when he comes to judah starting there at 49 verse 8 the prophecy goes judah thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee judah his alliance well from the prey my son thou art gone up he stooped down he cast as a lion as an old lion who shall rise him up we realize that's speaking of the three or three comings of the lord but then it continues in verse 10 the scepter shall not depart from judah or a lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto him shall the gathering of the people be i'm going to read one more verse there binding his full unto the vine and his asses colt unto the choice vine he washed his garments in wine in his clothes in the blood of graves lord jesus thy word is precious it's precious in my sight i think how that we sometimes the unworthy lord and even the things that we do and we talk about how that it was our sin that sent jesus christ the calvary how the things that we do and say sometimes helped cause the pain and yet it was because of that pain that you poured out the blood the paradox of life how that the very pains that caused it caused the way of escape for us so i come before you this morning humbly asking every sin every unbelief every perplexed of times whatever it might be will be relieved from your people this morning and the gathering lord gather them unto the great judah the lion of the tribe of judah even our lord jesus christ by your word i ask it in the name of jesus christ with all my heart amen please be seated might seem like it's kind of a strange combination of scripture but as we think about it and we look into the scripture if we were to the subject i suppose this morning would be uh the scepter or the of the the scepter of judah because it's talking there and it says the scepter shall not depart as a sub or as a name if we could put a name to it i'd put writing on it and because the scripture is you know we tend to think of it as in chronology everything in chronological order brother branham of course told us it's not in fact you can jump from one type and shadow here and the very next line is a type and shadow from something that happened way back there and the next line is something else because it's god's word and it's eternal and when we to really perceive it and understand it it takes a new birth you must be born again you have to receive jesus christ if you've not received jesus christ now is a really good time ask him right now don't wait till the end it might be too late and i'm not saying that to scare i'm saying it because it's just the truth you must be born again you must meet jesus christ i tell people all over the the world where we go it's not where you go it's who you know literally you must know jesus christ an intimate as we saying a love affair relationship many people met jesus but some of those that met him put him on a cross and nailed the put the name somebody put the nails in his hands but you have to meet him in love honor and respect and when you do that then he returns that we've heard brother branham preach about when love projects and how that when love goes out it's like it goes right back to the old law whatsoever man soweth actually also reap and if you pour your love out to him what kind of harvest do you think you're gonna get brother paul's a a great farmer and he puts a seed in the ground he's not expecting to get just one little piece of corn back he's hoping for a really good year where that that stock comes up but it's full of corn well it's just a natural law and as we pour out to jesus christ he pours back in abundance and it never ceases to amaze me sometimes when i look at the word of god i'm expecting you know just maybe a what brother jason saying the 20-minute version but all of a sudden when the holy spirit comes he just pours it out and i remember brother branham talking about sometimes that how when the holy spirit would come he said he couldn't write it down fast enough he said it's just because he's i like to remember a lady in new york we went to came back from africa one time and i only had just a little bit of money in my pocket and bought a couple of pancakes and she gave me just a little tiny deal of syrup and i'm looking at these two big pancakes and i walked back and i said ma'am i i do missionary work and she said something wrong and i said well i'm a protestant i believe in baptism not sprinkling and you know she she laughed and uh but that's how it is with the word of god it's a baptism and it's the whole body experience we get wet in the word of god and when he comes on the scene he pours out i love that scripture in psalms where he said i am poured out like water the i am god jehovah in jesus christ came and poured himself out poured himself out just totally bathed that we might receive the love and respect of jesus christ back to us by the love of god and so here we see tamar and how that you know it looked like an unrighteous act that she'd done she was as it were promised and again as we far as we know the law wasn't written as we know it you know because moses did that later on 400 years later roughly and but the existence of it or the concept of it however it was done was already there and it was such that she since she couldn't conceive from the first nor the second and the third was not really old enough yet and when he got old enough judah was just a little gun shy because he'd already lost two sons but he was the father of the household he was the one that would receive this promise a promise of god through a prophet named jacob who was his daddy as we would think and how that that promise would come upon judah and how that judah was to be the one that would start that lineage as we would call it or that bloodline going down through history to this one meets this one meets this one and how that that bloodline was to bring forth a particular time and a particular place to where god would step down and by the holy ghost speak through an angel messenger to marry and tell mary you know you're going to have a son and his name shall be called wonderful counselor mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace she had the question how can this thing be it's never heard of ever before in history and he said the holy ghost will overshadow you and you'll bring forth his son so judah is the one that has the seed line to bring this natural event into the place where it needs to be so that god can step into it and prove himself the king the everlasting father the very things that the angel had spoken to her it's not a myth it's not just a christmas story it was god moving on the scene and showing himself so ever so secretly and yet at the same time ever so easily seen as we can look back on it and we can read the lineages and the things you know when i first came to the lord if i really had to go to sleep i'd start reading the lineages it works you relax and so and so begat and so and so and i never paid a whole lot of attention to it until later on in life but it was god's way of hiding himself in simplicity the simplicity of you know this boy meets this girl ooh they get the funny look in the eyes and they're done for man i remember when my wife and i god bless her she wanted to be here this morning but she wanted to make sure she's over everything too and you know how they said that they'd look at us and god those two are worthless because you know you get that thing and here we are but so that in that simplicity god was creating and creating through this in this particular case by natural selection so what is the the point where where are you going brother david why you you mentioned tamar and you mentioned this and how that it was a righteous thing actually in judah proven that he had righteousness in him because had she had played the harlot that would have been the proper judgment bring her here we're going to stun her and burn her with fire because that's what happens to a harlot including this harlot day in which we live think about the masks what's god telling you about this generation just something to think about but we know that judah so he had righteousness in him he had the proper judgment but when she was to be presented to be burnt with fire she had something to present back and when this generation is to be stoned a prophet said with stones out of heaven i can't remember what you say 800 pounds or something like that and then burnt with fire we have something to turn back to we have something to show it was the proper judgment there is a proper judgment that will fall upon this generation upon this nation upon this world in which we live perplexed of times and all these things and this anointing the confusion what is it what does babylon mean it's the pouring out of every evil spirit why because it's all coming back into existence so it can be judged and sent to the lake of fire but at the same time little bride we're moving upward we're moving upward where does it start right here it starts the moment that you receive jesus christ and it begins to grow and so she presents back to him she said here the man and she doesn't say he's wrong she said but the man whose these are is responsible for this and all of a sudden what does he look at what does she have in her hands what do we have in our hands this morning to present before the king of kings when the judgment is about to fall well first off the name tamar means punk just simply means palm tree so she was named after a palm tree and we think there's lots of palm trees around at least not here but other warmer places in the world and how that her name simply means means palm tree but when i got to looking up what did ah our end time messenger tell us about the palm tree the first place i even found it where he was talking about it was when a judgment scene when shadrach meshach and abednego were about to go to the fire under the persecution of the king of babylon confusion and he said that god had watched it and i know some most of you probably heard the story about how this angel wanted to go on that angel and he said no i'll go myself and he said that god stands up off his throne and takes a palm frond off the tree of life and he goes down and fans the fire way with a palm frond that he got from the tree of life when he left the throne how many times in shadows are laying just in those little just in the name then how that tamar represents the tree of life she is to become she is a church a bride and she is going to become the holder of the tree of life even by her name and so the palm tree and so when she's given her first two husbands and they both died and she still once she had a desire to do that which is expected of a church bring forth children tell somebody about jesus christ it's not just the pastor the ministers we're just here to point you to this it's the church's responsibility brother branham one time said it's so easy to be a christian he said the first things he gave four simple rules tell somebody about jesus christ feed my sheep pray for the sick i forgot the fourth one but so simple and how that this palm tree she wants to bring forth life and she's willing to even do that which was unseemly and par another part of her name actually means to struggle she struggled with it here she was you know married twice essentially and not with child and how that she had this desire by her name my her very name i i'm tree of life i'm a palm tree and i have nothing to show for it and how that she struck she she probably just struggled with it and thought what can i do what can i do and now the the other son he's grown and i i don't have it and she presented herself as a harlot knowing that if she was caught she could be killed and burnt with fire knowing that judgment could await her and she be destroyed but she said the right thing when he said i'm going to give you a lamb from the flock there's another type running i mean they're going all over the place this morning who's the lamb jesus christ where's it going to come from the lineage of judah judah says i'm going to give you a lamb wasn't good enough wasn't the right time she needed something right now she couldn't wait for the lamb so she said you know how do i know you're a righteous man well what do you want she said i want first she said the ring the signet do you realize what she asked for when you run the hebrew translation or the dictionary signet is a seal it's the seal the ring the signature or the promise it's like you go to the bank and you know they you go to i want to buy a car and they want your signature that's your promise that you'll pay it's all in the ring we use it in the wedding vows who giveth this man who giveth this woman god bless you this word it's good to see you and how that you know who giveth this ring and so forth because that's the seal to the promises that have been made in that ceremony and it also means to be locked up or stopped to close up to make an end to to mark seal up or stop what's it talking about when the man and the woman have made that vow and they come together and seed is transferred from one to the other what happens to the womb it's stopped and only a very short amount of time is there so that no other seed can be transmitted into it and we all we know it no wonder adam took his wife quickly so when she takes the signet she's saying i will receive the seal i receive the promise and the possibility that my womb be sealed to the promise all in the ring and then she the next thing she asked for and i found this i had to really dig a little bit because you know we think of bracelets as those copper things that people wear or you know plastic ones or gold ones or whatever they are but from the hebrew the bracelets there were a cord a thread a twisted twine a lace a line a ribbon a ribbon we would call it or a wire and that that is twisted together and i've seen him a person gave me one a few years ago in leather just as a friendship thing and how that god uses those things excuse me receive the bracelets a twisted thread and it also means to wrestle with like when wrestlers are twisting and fighting and it's like torturous it's a hard thing and so we realized she had fought within herself about what to do and now she's asking for the seal and the thing that shows i fought for this i fought for it and she receives that twisted and there's another thing when you start to run thread through the scripture i think the first place i remember finding it anyway was when the spies went down into went down into where rahab another harlot lived and how that when the king sought to kill them he would have judged him and killed him but she hit him and she let him down by a scarlet cord and here she's saying i want the cord i want and what did it represent prophet told us represents the blood of jesus christ so she asks for the seal the closed womb and the scarlet cord upon her wrist the blood of jesus christ before the lamb arrives and the next thing the scepter or the staff she said i want the staff and what the staff means it says is well it's just a staff and we know it represents jesus christ it was a wooden staff david used it well everybody talks about the sling and the stones but they forget when david went to meet goliath he said he walked with the staff in his hand he held calvary in one hand and the stones of revelation in another hand that were bound in a leather pouch signifying the sacrifice of the lamb oh the word of god just goes on and on and on it pours out and so she asks for the staff and you know when you begin to read about the staff it's a branch and how that you know you can't carry the whole tree around but you can break the branch off and use it as a staff for walking or they make lances and arrows and all those kind of things out of it this is all in that uh the definition a rod a shaft a branch off of the vine who's the vine jesus said i'm the vine you're the branches and she's asking for a piece of the vine i want a piece of him i want every bit of piece of him i can get and this is what she's asking for i want a piece of the vine but that represented something even more it represents the tribe you see when she asked for that what was she asking for it's the lineage of judah that's not even spoken yet that's going to go through time and bring us jesus christ and how that that staff that she now possesses will take her into the lineage of jesus christ the very savior of the world the god of heaven who the bible said spoke all things into existence who by the word of his mouth could take that palm frond from the tree of life and blow the fire back from those that were thrown into the fire my lord and my god what did she ask for she asked to be a member of the tribe that would present jesus christ down through history in one of the actual they believe it was you know you were when you're reading definitions it's this this this there's a b c and so on one of the last ones it said was life support and then it goes to a root word which means stretched out or to extend to spread it out to bend or to bow or to pitch the tent that's i think was the last one to pitch the tent or turn aside so when she asks for this staff she's asking to be part of the lineage she's asking for the right to bear the seed of judah which becomes in chapter 49 has a law a wealth of promises my brother shall praise thee hand shall be in the neck of his enemies which actually we've covered this before it means to sever the head when it says in the neck it's not giving a massage you know it's cutting the head off quite a promise laying in that staff that staff of life and so and it continues there and it then it talks about christ but then in verse 10 it says the scepter shall not depart from judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet till shiloh come and then there's that those lovely little dots that denote time as our pro as the prophet of god said and unto him shall the gathering of the people be this scepter this staff the staff of life this branch and and i believe i said they're the you know one of the definitions to spread out or to hold out extend forth where do we see the scepter again where do we see that life being passed again when esther it looks like all of israel is about to be destroyed under the hand was it was the assyrian or the babylon i forgot which it was where they were at at that time but how that they laid it again upon the woman and she was called to be a queen but she had no children and when she comes before the queen the king and this time again judgment is present if he doesn't acknowledge her with the sector she's done for her finished and it says she erased herself in her queenly garments she dressed herself like a queen oh bride of jesus christ dress yourself in the robes of righteousness of jesus christ that when you present yourself before the king the scepter the life when he held out that scepter he was actually saying what did he say hey what do you want esther you can have half the kingdom what was he talking about his son his heritage exactly you can have my child i'm offering you the tribe of the king and she was arrayed and she received her request a raid as a queen and received the right to the tribe and the right to life to her that scepter was a tree of life life or death friends you must come before king jesus be dressed right have your heart right it says created me a clean heart and renew a right spirit in me bring to me a spirit of righteousness he is our righteousness and we become the bible says his righteousness and as we read from corinthians it's in him amen us being in him those two heroes make it a great big equation bride of christ and so it said the scepter will not depart and we know if you read the lineages how that going down down down through history and how that there's a king david and how that when he went before goliath he had the scepter or the rod in his hand the right to the tree of life he held it in his hand and with the revelation of the slain lamb in his side pocket and on the on his sling what a god we serve it's jesus christ everywhere in the scriptures and not just one place or one little look at it there's several of these things i'm trying to keep it on track because we could go out this branch or we could go out this you know and but she asked for those things and when she went before or was to be taken before judah and she presented those things what did she receive the life that was in her hand the blood that was on the wrist and the seal that guarded her womb against any other seed because this seed was so important that god was going to watch it all the way to the end time in where we are and he's going to use this same type and this shadow of a woman that struggled with inner self that what can i do judith's coming i gotta do something and she did the only thing that she could think of to do she presented herself as a harlot and judah in his righteousness takes a harlot but what i love the scripture where abraham is getting ready to slay isaac on the mountain and we read in i believe it's romans i want to say that how that said that abraham believed he was going to take isaac he was really going to do it because it said that he believed if god had given him that promise once against all hope he could give it back to him again and when he gets ready to slay the child and the spirit of the lord comes down the angel of the lord however like i you know it comes he comes look god comes down and he tells him don't do it abraham and what does he see well there's a lamb or a ram caught in the brush we see at the end time a ram or i mean it a ram caught in the brush and how these types they just go go go go and it's god he turn breaking himself here brother david here brother sister what what do you have need of this morning it's not about me it's about him every single step is jesus christ and how that as this end time as we're about to be thrown into the fire or the fire awaits i'll put it that way what i said we'd call it riding on it we're riding on the promises of god that's just maybe before we close pray for me keep your hand your finger we'll go back to 38 once more before we're finished i believe it is in zechariah it starts out the first part of zechariah i think it's like the fourth for i'd have to look again now but it's uh i believe it's four and six he says it's not my mount not not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the lord but there's another place in zechariah where it's talking about the king cometh and that's verse 9 or chapter 9 of zechariah nine and verse nine he's there and he says uh rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout o daughter of jerusalem behold the king cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon occult the full of an ass and then if you go from there over to john the 12th chapter what do we see in john chapter 12 this is when jesus is entering jerusalem just before calvary and i believe it's about the 12th verse uh as he's entering yes says on the next day much people that were come to the feast when they heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem they took branches of palm trees why palm trees you know there's other trees that grow in israel i've been there i've seen them but it says they took branches of palm trees and they cried whose and went forth to meet him and they cried hosanna blessed is the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord and jesus when he had found a young ass sat there on as it was written fear not daughter of zion behold thy king cometh sitting on the asses colt and it goes on to say that the disciples didn't have a clue what was going on but it was a scriptural fulfillment he was riding on it he was writing on the very scripture that said he would do this here was the king he wasn't a king yet he was and yet he was the king of judah so to speak but you remember judah had to come together with all of israel back in chronicle we find that happens and how that here is jesus and it said this was done to fulfill that fear not the king comes sitting on the asses cold and so here's jesus and they're throwing out ah the king got up and took a lot a frond from the off the palm tree the tree of life and they're throwing out the palms and they're calling out hosanna to the king and he's riding on the promise that he will become the king because right then he's an unseen king he's unrecognized and remember when david through that just how the scripture repeats over and over and how that he wrote into jerusalem on the back of a donkey i'm sure they had nice horses why a donkey because it's the word of god presenting itself again and again again so the bride of christ you'll not miss it it's all jesus christ and so here he is he's riding on the very promise spoken of by zachariah and that's not the only place because we read it back there in genesis 49 right binding his fall into the vine in his asses cold unto the choice vine he washed his garments in wine and his clothes in the blood of grapes the promise of genesis 49 and how it ran through time and it hooked up with zachariah and then we see it in jesus christ and we see that same humility coming through all the way to us we have a different promise i'm not planning on riding a donkey out of here but our promise is you shall not all die you shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye there's other promises that relate to the bride of jesus christ let's just i said we're getting ready to close uh look let's look at isaiah 28 for just a moment to help you understand we started out by talking about you know perplexed of times and all that and the struggles that we're going through but watch isaiah 28 jesus i love you he starts out there and he's talking about the crown of pride to the drunkards and so on at the first verse there of uh isaiah 28 and he comes down and he's talking about those things and and uh i want to make sure i get the right spot here uh well picking it up at verse 5 in that day shall yes verse 5 28 5 in that day shall the lord of hosts be a crown of glory and for a diadem of beauty unto the residue of his people and for a spirit of judgment to him that sits in judgment and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate what's our command in this day and age the greatest battle ever fought not only see taste your feel smell but all the imaginations the reasoning the memories all the things that you are being anointed of and that are being bombarded you can't even walk in a grocery store without here and you know when i find myself in times of trouble mother mary comes to me antichrist doctrine and you have to listen to it in a grocery store i've heard it been there done it and we are being anointed of those things there's a scripture that said they'll believe a lie and be damned by it oh they don't like to use that word it's not politically correct of course it's not because it's telling them who they are and where they're going well okay so this anointing is for a spirit of judgment everybody says now brother branham said don't we don't want judge he said you don't want justice justice is different than judgment justice is the receiving of the reward that you get from the judgment no i don't want justice in that sense because i know what this man would deserve but the spirit of judgment is to have the ability to know right from wrong what was the elijah ministry all about they didn't even know right from wrong it had been 2 000 years since a prophet had been on the scene since the days of paul who spoke romans corinthians galatians ephesians to give us proper judgment so what is where are we going with this i'm riding on it i'm riding on the fact that he has sent a spirit of judgment to teach me to teach us to teach you right from wrong and to have the spirit to stand on it or write on it to know that when you are in the proper position of judgment you have somebody that'll stand there behind you with a signal with a seal with the blood of jesus christ with the staff of the bloodline i am a part of jesus christ by the blood of jesus christ by the seal of the holy ghost but let's back up just one more can you just grant me a couple more minutes here we started out it says in that day that's talking about our day because if you go on down it talks about receiving the holy ghost and in verse 12 it talks about the refreshing what's so special about the refreshing here's here's another branch go for it brother david it's another branch refreshing and when you go over to the book of acts it says that at the time of the refreshing the wind from those palm leaves from the tree of life your sins are blotted out blotted out is what it says i believe in acts and we had a message that he said it's like a bucket of bleach a great big deal of bleach and when you confess your sins he said it's like you take a little ink dropper and you got all of them in that little ink dropper and you drop it in the bucket and he said the bleach is so strong it tears that ink down in one place he said to where it's as though it never existed your sins if they are put under the blood that he call it the clorox of the blood of jesus christ your sin never existed and even a god who knows all things who sees all things which is what he said to abraham abraham called him jehovah jireh which means the god provides and god sees because god saw his heart he knew he'd go through with it and the god that sees refuses to see something that never existed if that doesn't make you love jesus christ i don't know what will your sin never existed once it's confessed and put under that blood never existed and there was a woman who said give me the give me that ring give me that twisting that jesus in the garden prayed until he wept and the blood flowed from his body twisted tortured over this decision and he just wrote on that promise the king comes riding on the fall of an ass all the way from genesis and i believe there's two or three other places that mentions it or it sho or it shows it in type and shadow jesus was riding on his own promises from the word and he's called the word of god i'm writing this morning on the promises of god we who were unworthy and fit on whatever you want to call it we who were typed and shadowed in the scripture like tamar the harlot like rahab as a harlot like ruth as an outcast from an un unclean nation are made clean by the seal by the blood of jesus christ and by the staff of life that said if any man come i will in no wise cast him out oh bride of christ do we really really understand who we are amen equations big we might be the little zeros but we have one tremendous tremendous i can't say it enough tremendous awesome god his name is jesus christ if you don't know him if there's someone listening out i don't know i suppose it was going out this morning and you don't know jesus christ please ask him into your heart amen ask him to come and give you the tokens it says in one place that she received at the hand and the word of judah the scepter will not depart from his hand the life of jesus christ will not depart from your life because he said so not only did he say uh you know if any man comes he said i will never leave you nor forsake you i'm riding on it when i find my face in the gutter and think about some foolish decisions things that i've done or said where can i look but to that bleach blood of jesus christ and to the promise of the word of god that said i'll never leave you or forsake you he can't because your womb is sealed and the staff of life is now dwelling living and presenting itself to a dying world through your bodies know ye not ye are the temples of the holy ghost do you love him this morning enough honduras my little my great niece went with me to central america her name's hannah some of my suppose many of you know her and you know we talked about some different things but how that god he is so good so awesome and the promises of god every nation kindred tribe it's a promise i don't care if you're from who knows where slovakia or central america or the jungle of brazil or chile or madagascar wherever you are whoever you are he said i'll never leave you forsake you once you receive him receive this morning the word of life this word is called the staff of life and i'm riding on it god bless you as we stand sister if you could come gracious heavenly father love you we thank you and we look to the promises of god not only look thereon but receive thereon by the grace the blood and the life of jesus christ father you

isn't it wonderful sometimes how the lord does things thought will come on your mind and you're thinking oh my and then the minister speaks it and you know i was just thinking about this this morning you know brother david started off and said you know the 20-minute version or the two-hour version or but my brother and sister this word of god is not a time limited version it is a lifelong version amen the word being placed in us building us up building us up giving us the strength the courage the wisdom that we need and you know you think about as brother david was speaking today what is the proper judgment for this age now i know there's a lot of avenues that our minds can go down but my brother and sister when you get right down to the very basis of it all the proper judgment for this age is the bride taking her fault to the throne putting it brother david touched it putting it under the blood and being able to walk away without condemnation there's the proper judgment for the age all those who do that will not be judged in any other fashion see that's the beauty of it right there to get the proper judgment that is us in communion going to our lord jesus christ and saying lord forgive me i thought this i did this i said this and then it's gone it's done finished there's the proper judgment for an age that's what the prophet of god showed us that our calling is to go to the word first and the word corrects us yes amen i love that amen and also brother david as he was speaking as it come you see the signet the bracelet the staff was all because it was not the season for the lamb that's right we are standing here today now don't misunderstand me but we're not here today in the season of the segment [Music] we're not here in the season of the bracelet we're not here in this season as it were now the staff of the word of god is always in season but we're not here as it were in the season of the staff today thousands upon thousands of people carried this to the house of god but will not walk away with true revelation of what this is but we are in my brother and sister the season the time of the lamb the lamb has come we're standing here in the lamb's presence he's speaking to us now let me just jump over here here's tamar and they're saying you know what she's with child and and where did this come from now my brother and sister the denominational world says we have thousands of years of recorded history as us as the church and where does your revelation come from and tamar was able to stand there and say my revelation came from the father of the family it came from that one amen who his word is the word that either commuted or executed judgment that's where this revelation comes from it is not a man revelation it is not our own revelation but it is the revelation of our god amen of our lord jesus christ that he's placed into the very body of believers for us to come and bear it to fruition hallelujah amen i'm glad our revelation come from the father of the house hallelujah now pardon me i know some young children sometimes i'm sorry for the day i'm just thinking about this now look at this brother david says well look at this song i've got to be in the grocery store and i've got to listen to this end times mary [Music] i'll tell you what then he turns around saints and then he sings that song be it unto me about jumped out of my seat because what is the revelation do you realize in times of trouble mary oh come on grab your seat belts in times of trouble do you realize mary is speaking to you today mary oh this is not mariology [Music] mary is still speaking but not as an idol in heaven but as our sister as the prophet of god says she has the holy ghost also so she's speaking as our sister saying look sage just speak these words just hold to this be it unto me be it unto me lord according to your word hallelujah let's sing that again hallelujah [Music] to your world according to all your promises i can stand sets me free

in here kind of felt a little down but he's in the house and when he's in the house saints everything else every spirit every thought that is contrary to the word of god [Music] little girl was lying there they just laughed at jesus when he said she's only sleeping as he took her by the hand she began to live again some began to praise the lord some began to say he's in the house yes death has to flee and now there is [Music] used to be now there is hope there's no more doubt praise his name praise his name he's in the house [Music] we were like that little girl dead in all our sins [Music] till jesus touched this heart of mine gave me life again i'm just a house of clay ever since that blessed day there's a life that shines on me for all the world to see he's in the house dead has to flee now there is life when darkness used to be now there is hope there's no more doubt [Music] praises name all praise his name he's in the house oh he's in my house death has to flee now there is

with my servant goes with my sermon goes with my sermon brother david gets up starts preaching it's like goes with my sermon goes with my sermon hallelujah hallelujah i'll tell you what my brother and sister he knows my name i am not just wandering through a world randomly you know god doesn't do random young people if you think that god is random you need to stop god's romantic right [Music] as humans we can be random [Music] he knows my name i was just reading the prophet of god said someone questioned me and said what do you mean brother brown that he knew my name before the foundation as he said just exactly that as he created every particle that made this universe amen he named [Music] and go i'm paraphrasing this we come and go through life you see my brother and sister he says it can't be destroyed it can't be destructed we just go back to our original element with his naming of haas before the foundation of this morning isn't that beautiful you have to just preach right now i have a good and before even time began my life was in his hand he knows my name he knows my everything he sees these tears and balls and he hears me when i call [Music] i have a father he calls me his

knows my everything hallelujah let's make sure we call on him no matter where we're at no matter what our situation is as our brother david was explaining there she was tamar she didn't casually say i'll go down by a road i'll present myself as a heart but she was crying out where oh god where is this seed that i'm supposed to bring forward where is this life i am supposed to bring things oh god i i pray lord let us be anointed let the saints of grace be anointed let our hearts cry hell lord where is this that i am supposed to bring forth and our young people lord the world has such a strong
