burden is easy amen my burden is light my yoke is easy amen let's Stand Together happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen amen I little message here I had some other things in my heart I thought the Lord was surely going to direct me down then I then he just changed it but it's all right because I realized then it would been too much for tonight so I'd have to take it some other time have some things in Revelations 19 I'd like to share sometime the Lord willing but this will just have to come before it and believe it will so I want to title this tonight the bride's standard of living the bride's standard of living let's have a word of prayer our heavenly father as we approach your word tonight we do so with rejoicing and Thanksgiving knowing Thy word cannot and will not return void but it will accomplish what you've sent it to do Lord what a position to stand in is your word you said in your own word you said it is he that worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure Lord what a consolation what a rest Lord that we have to know this that you you are perfect in all of your ways Lord we just thank you so much father to be yolked with you to know that we are free the darkness has passed we are walking in the light what a glorious Revelation in this hour what a glorious hope we have to know that soon and very soon this that we have in us will change our mortal bodies what a trust we have in thee Lord bless your word tonight open it to every heart that Lord can receive I pray and in thy name we commit this to you in Jesus Christ's name and For Your Glory who stands present with us now to confirm the word and to and to reveal it to our soul we give you thanks and for your glory amen amen I'd like you to turn with me in your Bibles to 1 Corinthians 16 or two I'm sorry 1 Corinthians two and we'll begin reading here about the i' say about the 10th verse I just want to kind of back up I want to uh come down to verse 16 as something but I want to read these up before that and I and I just want to uh trust you catch what's is said tonight bride standard of living recognizing our position we must get our position amen God wants us to realize our position the bride's ultimate the bride's ultimate bride's here this morning T night right bride's ultimate the ultimate is is the absolute the amen so the bride's ultimate is down in that Third Realm the soul that predestinated seed that's been alive Made Alive and quickened which is Jesus Christ revealed in you which is the new birth Christ birthed in you it's a word birth amen a spoken word birth amen so first Corin Corinthians 2 and I begin reading here let's just take verse 9 but is as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God the hidden things we know in this hour this day the the the the hidden Mystery of God is revealed the finished mystery how many you say amen amen the finished mystery of God and we're rejoicing and walking in that Revelation that's what the bride's position is is is that secret amen that God would only he said the seals were only open to the bride did you know that the Seven Seals and notice it's Seven Seals opened not six seven Seven Seals are opened he said it over and over again it's those Seven Seals opened have been opened are opened amen all right so so 1 Corinthians and verse 10 and I read verse 10 verse 11 for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now you see you must the spirit of God's the only thing that can to open his word to you to you amen now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit of but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God Amen which things also we speak and amen the which things hold this real tight now which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual see it's an inside teacher but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God so why pay attention to him when it comes to the word he has no say in this amen amen the word itself is your ultimate amen all right but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them so don't try to figure it out don't try to get educated and try to explain it just rely upon God to open his word reveal it to you amen so he said they are foolishness unto the natural man see for neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual notice but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man so don't look to your your your your man's side to judge you that's not what's judging you amen don't look to that and say oh my goodness I failed I did this and judge yourself a failure God never said you were God never called you a failure he calls you his word he calls you himself right that's right all right so we're come into this more and more but verse 16 for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ Revelations chapter 12 now we know let's just read verse 10 because we know when the prophet said when the bride goes up raptured Satan is kicked out because he has a right to come up and accuse Us in Heavenly places even yet that right but when the bride goes up Satan's cast out he comes and in and and incarnates himself becomes what this that old Dragon becomes the Beast yeah then he breaks the Covenant with Rome or excuse me makes a covenant with Israel excuse me Rome does Amen but the prophet said we wouldn't be here when that's made so how close are we Israel has their hands on the money Wall Street amen that's right so look how look how much the war is costing her all right so anyway I won't go into all that that's another message okay so anyway back to it again and I heard this verse 10 I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before God day and night now look verse 11 how do how how did they come to this Rapture little bride how how did they come to this what they overcome by and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony they love not their lives unto the death amen amen you may be seated I want to read a quote to you out of the message this day the scriptures fulfilled now but in this day we know what this day is we know we turned a corner it's the bride age amen we're in the bride age nobody can enter into that that time but the bride it's a bride time it's a bride age it's seed time and he said but now but in this day there is to come a super Royal Seed of Abraham let me read that again there is to come a super and the prophet called it a super race it's his own race Christ's own race God's Own race race there's to come a super Royal Seed of Abraham that's exactly what it would be or what he how he said it that's exactly what it'd be would be a royal bride amen there's to come a super Royal seed and it would be a royal bride to the Royal promised son as I spoke last night it won't be a natural seed it'll he's speaking last night meaning he was preaching seed is not air with the shu it'll be a spiritual seed there is to be a spiritual bride amen amen he that is spiritual there's to be a spiritual bride rise up which will be the Royal seed of the royal faith of Abraham's royal son amen she will have the same Faith she's the seed of that faith she's the seed of him amen same Faith she's to come forth with his faith she is to come on the scene in the last days and the time and place is a promise that's given to her amen what a day what an hour what a promise that we see now being fulfilled this day this promise is being fulfilled the bride clearly is seeing this and coming in Union with this Revelation this is what bringing her together amen because it's one headship we're under amen not not two headships if we have two heads we have two opinions we only have one opinion that's that's our ultimate that's our absolute down in that inside of the inside where we live where we dwell our dwelling place is in Christ right we're hid in the in the secret of his Tabernacle Psalm 275 we are HID in the secret of his Tabernacle amen we we've we've spiritually we've already spiritually raptured into a position that Satan can't touch us did you know that you're hid away Satan can't touch you there there's no plague in fact no plague can come nigh your Dwelling Place in Christ there's no plague can come nigh that Dwelling Place it can touch it might touch the body but it can't touch you right I'm talking about the real you that Soul you yeah yes amen that spirit of God the the original Faith the original word in you living that's your identification so we'll go into this as we go on further then he goes on to say according to Mal he said there's a promise given to her that she's to come on the scene think of it we're fulfilling scripture right we're a fulfilling prophecy according to Malachi 4 he said which is a scripture there's to rise a message that will shake the hearts that will shake the hearts of the people right back to the apostolic fathers again other words the original Faith there is to rise on the scene in the power of Elijah Same Spirit same power they'll rise in the scene of wilderness man that'll come out and will have a message amen that will run right right straight back to the word again to restore right back to the word not restoring any organization any denomination he's restoring the original word the original Faith The Original Seed is got to come back again in the bride form who is this it's Christ see there's got to be a bride coming of Christ before we have a meeting in the air so we realize he's in his coming he's in his coming can we can we realize that tonight that our position are placing as the anointed word for the hour the prophet said he manifested the word of his hour and he said today the bride will manifest the word of this hour amen it's the same person just in another form the bride was the mystery of Adam Eve was the mystery of Adam the bride today is a mystery within a mystery because Christ Christ was the complete revelation of God God revealed is that right well who's who's your bride all that God was he poured into Christ the complete revelation of himself and now Christ in you will make you the complete revelation of the whole thing amen see there's got to be this promise made manifest the bride seeing her position she's seeing that she's absolutely delivered freed amen but but watch I'm going to come to this the prophet and I'll come to where that said that but he said but she's living well below and at that time not so much now we're coming into that position that place but living below her way below her privilege yeah her position her place see but as we grow in the presence of God we're growing up right right absolutely what do we grow up into the head that's the adoption that's Perfection that's the stature of a perfect man not the man this man but Christ the man in you and I we're growing up into that position that's our stature that's the option that's the placing that's what was preached to us Sunday the maturing of the word we grow up into him in All Things even Christ so what is that headstone it's perfect love it's Christ himself what's the bride to be Christ himself amen yes it's himself in the bride form not another person it's himself the bride the bride is his body the bride is bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh that's what she is see this is a great mystery Paul said but I speak of Christ and the bride because Christ was I mean I mean the bride was Christ's body his own self he didn't hate his own flesh but he he cherishes and nourisheth it and what ought our marriages do right all right see we ought to be a a physical manifestation of that Revelation spiritual Revelation see there there's a there's that there now don't don't expect that you say well Brother David we if we have a mistake no you you make mistakes but that's not what you're judged on God's already opened the book He's already declared your judgment right case is dismissed he's already opened the book in this hour is a book within the book you know we've already been through that there's a Lamb's Book and that's a complete revelation of Jesus Christ is that right but there's any but there's a bride part in there in that book in a section and that was the little book opened and you found your name in that book now that's an eternal security thank you you couldn't be moved from that you can't lose that you can't no way take because you were Justified because justification means you never sinned in the first place you never committed it in the first place amen so so we see a message arises bring us right back to that word run us right St back to the word that's the hour he said we're living in then consider now I ask you at this hour you people of Jeffersonville in 1933 the supernatural light that fell down yonder on the river that day when I was baptizing 500 in the name of Jesus Christ and I was about a 20-year-old boy he said what did it say Jeffersonville what did it say it said the voice said as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming your message will forun this his second coming amen amen amen you know the second coming is called in the Bible an advent it's a it's a second Advent an advent is a period of time it's not just one sudden thing it actually is taking place it's an advent and he forrun the message the seals opened up if the seals were never opened up we' have never seen it but he identified himself already in the heavens because the Bible said the Lord himself shall descend what's he descending for to unite with who himself in the form of his bride see this is the Revelation that that if unless you have an ear to hear unless the holy spirit's in you you'll miss it see but we're not going to miss it if the holy spirit's dwelling in you you have his mind and you can spiritually discern having his Spirit you are spiritually Discerning the word of God for the hour and the season and and by that and through that you become that manifestation all right and so he said so he said now he says behind it your message will F on the second coming into all the world then watch he said this day this scripture is fulfilled what a statement what a positive statement when Jesus Took the book from the priest and stood up to read the scriptures let here read it out of my book and he took it what did he do Under the great that powerful anointing that was upon on him never a greater anointing than that the fullness of God was in one man what did he do under that anointing shout and dance and speak in tongues no it was an emotion he sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth right that's right think of that amen what an anointing but that same anointing you may have a measure of that but it's in you now right and it's anointing that word to live it walk it and talk it and you can't in your own humanness do that think of that there's no reason to look and try and try and try you just need to give yourself over and recognize it's he that works in you it's he that does it all it's him that's accomplished it all right so let's let's go he said now so we see brother random said in in the message I think it's paragraph 233 you've heard me quote this many times but now we see the Promise being fulfilled now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in coming in his bride amen amen amen amen I wish I could just shout that to the rooftops amen life is following him amen Right Out of Heaven just like he said all right now let's turn to Mark 11 I want to go into this a little further Mark 11 very familiar scripture verse 22 and Jesus answering said unto them have faith in God now if you have a skull field and it's it's right I make reference this cuz not a lot I don't reference skull Fields things except where it was correct but he said here have faith in God and it's a little G and it means have the faith of God now that's exactly what the prophet said was in his working he said he said a Believer is and this is a direct quote out of perfect Faith he said a Believer is are you ready you want to know what a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you amen the believer is you want to know your identification of believer the believer is the faith of God that moves in you all right he said and what is it it's the word Hebrews 4:12 said the word is living and operative and the prophet said she would be the word living and in action so this is what we this is the True Believer see and you don't have to receive anything else no matter what your flesh man tries to tell you as long as you've met that it's the divine revelation to you what is the Revelation to you a Vindication it's proven and God backs that up in your life because does things and works through you things that you never could do in yourself amen so it's already recognized you your failures he's not going to recognize the failures because he's already taken your failures he's already received your failures the chastised me peace was upon him and with his stripes we are already healed so he's already taken your failures your mistakes your faults and buried in M Calvary yes and Rose up and you and I'm coming to this in just a minute because I want you to hear what he said and you Rose up with him already rose up with him he that believeth liveth and believeth in me shall never die so now you know how the battle you say I'm in a battle but see how the battle's going to go you're not fighting a battle for to get Victory you've already got Victory you're fighting the battle to manifest and prove Victory right amen it's already you're already Victorious but without a battle that would never be made manifest one of God's attributes is that he's Victorious and you're Victorious see in him amen if he's his ways are made perfect then he turn around and said he's made your way perfect why because you can't be in have your way not be made perfect right what a rejoicing what a joy what a peace we have see all right so he said Mark 11:22 goes on to say verily verily I for verily verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith now the prophet said how how can I a man say that well that was revealed to him when those squirrels were created he said it was not me it was not my inspiration it was God's inspiration speaking to me and saying you speak what you will that was a revelation to him then he understood how it would work the just shall live by faith so by faith God said to him you say it he never said I'll say it but it was God saying it through him but he uses man to say it so whatsoever you say now that's all the way through the prophet's message you'll you'll notice Moses was directed and I'll come to a quote here he said where the bride is the same thing Jesus himself could do nothing in his own is that right but it was shown him by the father and he said this same Harmony is to exist between him and his bride he shows her she performs his will in his name amen and the seed then the water the word that's gone forth is watered and it comes to pass if it doesn't come to pass it wasn't God that said that through your lips so there's got to be a backing up there's got to be a proving there's got to be when the word is revealed the word brother Bram said is then Vindicated which means it's been it'll have to be proven you God can't have a a true Revelation and then nothing happened behind that right yeah there's a change see and of course revelation we know is a stimulation that stimulates the believer to speak to walk to do yes there's an action behind this amen all right so so so we see here he said now I'll just I'll just and and he believes those things which he says shall come to pass you'll have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them right right didn't say believe you'll get believe well I hope I get them he said believe you receive them right as soon as it's spoken you settle it in your heart that settles it the word's gone out it's got to be manifest believe you receive them right now amen and you shall have what does it say and you believe you say and you shall have them okay now and when you stand praying forgive yes if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespass but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses see so forgiveness one of the great characteristics of Our Lord was forgiveness and that's the same thing in his people it's the same thing all right what is an ultimate is the last word what is an ultimate is the last word the ultimate is the amen it's the end of all Strife your ultimate amen so your ultimate is down here in that Third Realm of the Soul that's your tpost that's your ultimate you're going to be whatever you are there yeah that's it you can be anointed in the second realm but whatever you are in there even though can be anointed in the second realm just to do Miracles and signs and wonders and cast out Devils amen is that right like a real believer but not have that ultimate or have that tie poost in the soul it'll never hold true to the word you'll never really be able to understand or receive the word yet anointed to do these things yet not have it and brother Brandman said still and can be lost so you see where it is is in that Soul realm it's there that the word is opened amen there is where you're hid there is your Refuge amen now the same thing is this if you are a son of God and I'm a Son of God or a daughter of God we were in God at the beginning so if we know where we came from amen then we know who we are right because wherever we came from you are a living attribute you were a living substance of God right there amen and we know what faith is the faith that's moving in you is genuine substance of things hoped for and the evidence of Things Not Seen see you have substance you've already got got it amen and so we we are already married but we're going to a full complete marriage right we already have a Rapture but we're going to a full complete Rapture right we are because we have to see it and have it in faith first amen everything is done by faith Hallelujah all right so now you were in God at the beginning and when Jesus became the fullness of the word then you were in him germ form amen amen you are in him germ form that was his germ you were in him his own [Music] germ amen so when he became flesh you did in him right in germ form all right when he was crucified we was crucified in his body praise the Lord what was he cruci he was judged we were also judged all right when he rose from the dead we rose with him yes when he rose from the dead we rose with him you see he said we rose with and now since we have recognized it now that since we have recognized your day and its message now that we've recognized it and awakened remember how brother brandham said in the Seal's been no nothing to stir the bride as yet nothing to awaken it'll take those seven th ERS the Revelation contained the seals to Waker her and then a year and a half later he said he said this this this book called Herald of his coming crying out constantly crying we need a prophet we need a prophet we need a prophet he said and they don't recognize that this day the scriptures fulfilled the prophet is right there but so simple though they didn't see it they were looking for something way off something something big and missing God's Simplicity see and then he said but what they haven't recognized now he said there had been no Awakening but it took those seven Thunders and then he turned around and said' but what they haven't recognize is the Awakening of the Bride so something took place there's an Awakening took place and there's still an Awakening and we recognize see we're recognizing our position and what this word was sent for and we a part of that finished mystery of God himself a big portion of of that amen okay a finished mystery and so and and so we we were in germ form we crucified we crucified with him we arose we arose with him and now since we have recognized that now we sit together with him in Heavenly places in Christ already seated there yes nobody's going to move you off of that position you've already positioned all right see for he if we if we're Sons and Daughters of God we are God's children seed then we are attributes of God then we were got eternal life and God is the only only eternal life there is right see then we were in him from the beginning and when Jesus became all that word we were a part of him then amen there you are that's so we be we we become himself revealed complete revelation of himself amen Eve was a mystery of Adam or the finished mystery of Christ she was the finished mystery of Adam all right now he said but when it comes to see you he said we're part of him amen there you are when that's in there there is no devil when that's in there in where when that's in there down in that inside of the inside you've entered behind that Veil you're sealed in amen when you're truly born again you're sealed there's not two ceilings you're sealed but you grow to adoption you grow to maturity amen you grow up into him it's already started the growth has already started amen amen amen all right now now he said there you are when that's in there there's no devil no powers no nothing can ever move it that's the Ty poost of the Soul glory amen you can be anointed out here in this Spirit he's talking about the second realm of our spirit in this spirit and and desire and do these other things but when it comes to This Ti poost to that word you'll never move from there it'll hold right steady and true to that word as that can be that second realm what what the prophet say the light goes DM and then it goes dark and then it grows dim and you have ups and you have downs and you still see but in there there's no ups and downs you're a branch that's budded and bearing fruit he said I'm the vine and you're the branch yeah and you've got living man at Eed on that never run never grows stale it doesn't give out it's there amen think of it think of our position we have a positive position people amen he said he said I've introduced you to him I've got a decrease he must increase and he said the bride he said the bride would he said she comes to her oh that she'll come to her positive position not a negative position it is a positive position and therefore we have no reason to receive those negative things negative thoughts thoughts amen see it takes vigilance doesn't it takes vigilance over your mind it takes vigilance over the battlefield amen and the battle's getting hot and heavy but what is it we've overcome that hot and heavy it is we've done we've done conquered that devil see that's why we're we're fighting to prove that we're already a conqueror we're more than the Conqueror amen all right so so that they'll never move he said no matter it'll hold steady and true to that words can be outside of that regardless of what you do you're still lost see that if that TI poost is in the soul it'll hold steady and true outside of that regardless of what you do you're still lost see what the birth is the new birth had to meet the seed God had to Quicken the seed he come for his own to Quicken that seed that seed been quickened in you oh you say if I just only knew it oh you'll know it because why it's a revelation amen it's unveiled and it's not a group it's an individual it's you amen amen and it's for you if you believe it amen now no he came himself to redeem that lost son Hallelujah God did not entrust his Plan of Salvation to another he trusted only himself amen God was made flesh and dwelt you know and then he still only trusts himself amen that's right all right he said God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and redeemed us unto himself were saved by the blood of God how many believe that we saved by the blood of God the Eternal God indwelt a mortal body now where is he great is the mystery of God and list where God was manifest in the flesh where is he now he was embodied there where is he embodied now he's embodied in the body of his bride hallelujah what does that make you then it makes this flesh his flesh amen it makes this man his son because it's a mask that masks that unveiled word amen see the lids been taken off of the lids been removed we're now seeing what was hidden in there and we're in there we see oh that's me how'd you come to your place by the word How It Happen by the message the word see amen the word opened all right amen if the word opened you opened you were opened the mystery is revealed you're the mystery praise be to God hallelujah all right now he says now the blood of God the Eternal God indwelt the Mortal body in order to take away sin he became the lamb in order to shed his blood and enter into the veil with it amen amen now he said consider this this is in the church age book consider this since it is the blood of God it is perfect blood and if perfect blood is loosing us I said us you and I from the power and bondage and defilement of sin then the loosing is perfect and complete right that's it isn't that wonderful brother Paul it's perfect and complete there is now therefore no condemnation Romans 81 hallelujah amen so you see the devil says oh see you failed you did this you walked by flesh don't you listen to his opinion amen you never failed anything amen God has already ordained you not a failure he's already said you're perfect well I don't feel like it no you don't feel like it I don't look like it you don't look like it but where is perfection it's in Christ where is Christ in you and who are you that Christ what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to take us out of our old dark denominationalism self not only out of the old dark denomination but just the out of that old dark dungeon of self he delivered us you're free from that you don't have to walk by that no more you're born again what is that born again it's a word birth birth it's him birthed in you it's his himself birthed amen amen am Hallelujah all right now who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect Romans 8:33 and 34 who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth that declares us righteous you realize he's declared you righteous yes he's already made the Declaration do you believe his word do you believe what God said about you yes not what you think about you not what the old carnal man thinks about you he's going to him hon he's going to question but that inside of the inside being the word will never question God's word it can't it it's only a Believer it does not sin it can't sin Hallelujah all right so he said so who is he that condemneth who is he that condemneth it's not God condemning you you're freed from condemnation and and he that is in Christ he there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who do what they do not walk after the flesh right but they walk after the word amen who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen amen amen did you realize Romans 81 said that you can't you can't serve two masters you can't be be careful don't be caught between two opinions you only have one opinion one absolute one ultimate that's the word and he didn't ask you to go figure it out go go try to know a whole lot and go try to explain it he said just simply take me at my word and I'll take care of the rest of it you believe it and settle it right there amen that's what faith will do that's what royal faith will do amen now so there it is his death gave us the blood the blood has loosed us who can say amen amen I am loosed by the blood amen how they overcome him by the blood by the blood is that right yeah Satan can't break through that blood he can't come through that blood and you have to come through the blood to get in the soul realm you have to come through the blood to get into the inside the inside and the inside the inside life in there is your token that you've come through that blood amen you have have to have the blood you have to have the token you're not going to make it home in a Rapture without the token you're not accepted without the token the token identifies you are recognized your faith is recognized to be his faith it's his spirit in you and that token identifies it Hallelujah there you are that's the importance of the token which is what his own literal life dwelling living walking speaking acting in you the word is working mightily in me but not only in me everybody can say it's in me but let's see it through me isn't that right let's see it manifest through me if you say you have it it'll live itself right it'll manifest itself you say have thus sayith the Lord then watch it come to pass if it doesn't you never had thus sayeth the Lord Hallelujah no matter how much you feel like it how much you think it's so until it's revealed to you and you move on that Faith then you move on his faith God's word God's word's got to act hallelujah amen all right now so the blood is loosed us there's now no condemnation How can there be there's nothing to be condemned for because the blood is loosed us from sin we are free we are Guiltless amen thank you Lord we're Guiltless we're perfect we are absolutely sinless you can't live in the sinless one and not be sinless you can't have the one sinless one living in you and not be sinless the blood's been applied and there's only one way of being perfect perfect in him is through the blood of God's provided that for you amen all right so don't listen to man he's loosed us we are free we're Guiltless so don't listen to man don't listen to man amen that's right this old wobbly old fell out here don't you listen to him that's you he's carnal he's an enemy he's against you amen but he's brought under control by the word right brought under obedience by the word greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world yes amen amen all right so then we are guilt listen don't listen to man listen to the word you are loosed by the blood listen to the word listen to what he's telling you tonight you are loosed by the blood you're loosed you're are freed oh I'm free I can just do anything I want you sure can but you're not going to have any desire in you to do what's displeasing to him though you may do it but but you have no desire to do it that's he's not judging you by your mistakes he's judging and looking at you at what desire you have there's no intent in you to do it at all thank you Lord amen that's exactly right you have no when a man's one purged by the blood has no more desire no more conscience no more will or or a willingness to do anything I have no desire for any of that amen that's right all right listen to the word you are loose by the blood now don't get tied down by traditions and Creeds and organizations don't be led astray by listening those that deny the power of the word and deny that Jesus saves heals and fills with the Holy Ghost and power you are God's free men loosed by his own blood and so the blood's in effect it's a affected it's in you you are his blood did you know that the bride is his blood do you know the bride church is his blood by his Spirit what is the blood it's life she's his own life amen she's his seed she's his race she's his Royal seed she's royal royal it's a it's a royal race amen Royal Blood all right now pick up your pen and write he said notice the harmony notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus Ned did did never did anything and I I already spoke on this but he never did anything until it was first showed him by the Father John 5:19 you say well he saw that by Vision that's true but it was still a revelation to him right this is what the prophet's trying to drive home when he the spirit of Truth has come he will reveal these things to you that I've spoken that's the evidence of having the Holy Ghost is having the ability to hear and receive the word for your season right it's a revelation to you and the Revelation is the the quickening power of the Holy Spirit upon the word revealing it and it stimulates amen amen it's refreshing yes it's a refreshment all right now he said and but he said this harmony this harmony between the father and the son is now to exist between the groom and his bride which is what his body the bride is his body all right he shows her her who his body he's showing you're a part of that body I may only have the measure of a of a grain of mustard seed but I'll tell you what there's enough measure in that Mustard Seed of himself to move mountains to call for these things he's not measured big and little he is what he is in whatever measure you have I have amen that unites us together as one person now I could go a lot on that in the body we know okay and our our pastor has spoken about that all right now he shows her the harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life he shows her his Word of Life boy talk about a wife he shows her his word doesn't hold it back from her he reveals it to her all right she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will rais it up again he said here is the secret of this here's the secret the word is in the bride amen the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word and then she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayeth the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass watch now that's the evidence that it was not your thought was his thought it comes to pass all right First Kings 18:2 1 and Elijah came to all the people and said how long halt you between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him [Music] Amen on the seventh seal book this is the one brother George had put out here and I've got it all marked up terribly here but anyway on on page 219 and paragraph 95 I want to read something here watch these two opinions said Christ wants his wife pure with the word the way she must be because nothing not one jot or one tit or anything will pass from the law from the book that book till it's all fulfilled Jesus said both heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away don't put any private interpretation to it he said he wants her pure unadulterated not even a flirt I wouldn't want my wife flirting with some other man see another opinion he said and when you go to listening to any kind of Reason beyond that you're listening and you're flirting with Satan amen see the the word is flawless yes it's perfect it's complete it's powerful it's salvation it it's it's Christ doesn't it make you feel religious God wants you to stay unadulterated stay right there with that word stay right there with it all right don't go to two opinions don't be caught between your opinion of how you feel your senses which opinion are you going to to take right are you going to take What God Says are you going to take what your flesh man says right that's no evidence what your flesh says what it feels how it feels how it reasons an imagination all these things see you're possessors of those Gates the seed of God shall possess the Gate of the enemy Satan may try to come through those Gates but that's not the opinion you're listening to so don't get halted between two opinions you've only got one opinion to follow that's your ultimate that's the amen that's the word amen there is our absolute amen that's right our TI poost is the word Psalm 628 said trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him God is a refuge for us Sila meditate upon it Sila meditate upon it how can a man say that the bride of Christ goes into the tribulation I can't understand it see she's took away from the tribulation if the church has been judged and they have judged themselves and have accepted the blood how can God judge a man that's perfectly totally sinless there's no such a person every that you say there's no such a person every Born Again believer True Believer is perfectly absolutely sinless before God he's not trusting in his works right in the blood of Jesus that his confessions dropped into is what he trusts the Bible says so he that is born of God does not commit sin let's turn to 1 John 3:9 a minute 1 John 3:9 let me read that scripture whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin sin is unbelief for his now watch I wanted to read this because here's why for his seed remaineth in him it remaineth in him it doesn't he's not coming in well you failed takes it out right no it was placed there predestinated there positioned there remember from the very beginning we said it ultimate is down in that Third Realm the soul that that predestinated seed all right see so he said for his seed remaineth in him and he can and he cannot you might as well just soak it up good right now he cannot sin he cannot sin Hallelujah the joy of the Lord is my strength he cannot sin because he is born of God praise the Lord who's begotten you who where did you come from if you know where you came from you know who you are and if you know who you are you certainly know where you're going amen finished work praise the Lord what he did in the open of the seals he just come to claim lay claim on what he already redeemed right and he takes the book and he takes Ruth to be his wife there it is see she's born again she see look at Sarah she's she's birthed she in the natural they had a change of body is that right in the spiritual we are a new creation right and we're able then to receive seed they couldn't receive it when they were in their old bodies like that they had to be changed and they had to come through a birth then they went down to a a guer and remember God I don't know why I'm saying this I'm going to drop this in anyway there they went down to gerer after the change yeah yes and Satan almost got to her like he did the the Eve I mean like he did like he did Eve first before Adam and and just like he did the the Holy Ghost Apostles they went out there and what happened they those that spirit that that Spirit of antichrist come among them yeah subtle religious said we're in the message too we believe the message too why we believe God sent a prophet but look let's let's this little things just little sayings just little Spirits moving among them and they begin to walk and Satan got to her first before God did but that can't happen today God gets to her before aik did amen he tried to but God had the womb closed up amen praise be to God that's you're taking a man's wife yeah but he said he said she's my sister he's his and you go have him pray for you a liar you go have a liar pray for you CU I don't recognize his lie I'm telling you that he's my seed and unless he prays for you I'll kill the whole bunch and I'll close every womb around and your wives will never have children well that just kind of caps off what we said tonight doesn't it all right okay so so what happened she had to grow up a little bit what was taking place but he said I'll visit you in the time of life I'm going to come to you in the time of life but I've got to change you first amen and I've got to bring you to that time of life and I will come to you and the prophet said and the Word was predestinated to come to her again it's got to come to her again again in this day there's to come a royal seed a royal bride and she's pregnated I've got that I think I have that quote right here yes I think anyway we'll get to it let me just continue on yes yeah he said the other is pregnated by the word of God and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride the other is pregnated by the word of God what are we pregnated with we are here to to do what to bear his name yes amen yes sir we're we're bearing his name everything that goes with that name the bride is here to make manifest watch what he said here the other is pregnated by the word and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride who will bring it forth see will bring forth the body the body of Christ at that time isn't finished yet it may be finished now we don't know see but it's not finished yet how many knows that a man and woman is one and Christ is one well it's not finished as far as we know because when it is we go home right okay a man and woman is one and Christ is one body and I'm not saying we all got it we got it all and no I need more of him am yes if I didn't have that pull in me that's why I lay in that word every day that's why I go out and pray I've got to spend time with God yeah and you ought to be spending time with God too Redeeming the time for the days are not only evil they're corrupted and they're sickening and they're rotten yes they are that's the truth don't put any confidence in any of this you get a union with Christ God Will Take Care you take care of it to take you right into the body change see because what we've got as a new creation is the revealed word in US is that right we know we've come to a change we know we're in Union with the marriage of the Lamb is is said will come it has come it's already come it is come it is and what for the wedding supper we're going to a celebration it's going to take us to the meeting in the air it's got to where're in we come into the secret place in Union now laying in his presence ripening and ripening into what the full manif estation the full development the full maturity of himself yes okay so and so the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the one body again remember the two come together they're no longer Twain they're one no longer is you Twain brother brandham said that he says now no longer is this bride Twain They are now one he said life has left that shut amen literally he said I said I'm going to tell you he said life has left it what followed Rider on White Horse Life where did it come out of dark denominationalism what was Revelations 4:1 the Rapture already in progress amen what I don't get started in that that moving into other sermon I wanted to preach so let's leave it alone but anyway getting back to this the two ga makes one body again like Adam was at the beginning man and his wife are now are one notice Genesis 21 after they come back what happen I'll meet you in the time of life and Sarah shall have a son and Sarah conceived yeah and bear a son and said this son of this Bond woman will not be Heir it spoke right out of her mouth shall not be air with this son my son seed is not air with the shuck amen all right now now she the true bride is so sold out to him he said they're they're they're one him and his wife are one and the bride so sold out to him she has no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word amen amen now I've just got just a few moments and I'm done here now okay we covered that all right now okay you cannot sin how can he make man a sinner when the bleach of blood of Jesus Christ stands between him and God and would scatter sin until there's nothing left of it see see how can that pure blood of Christ ever let sin pass there it cannot amen now Jesus said be perfect now we've been through that and he made a way for it all right now referring back to Mark 11:22 I've just got a couple things here out of the church out of their seals here now just a moment page 248 and I want to share these things with you because it goes right along with what we're saying here page 248 paragraph 21- 23 and that's the way the blood of Jesus Christ does that and this is in the for seal that places a man across the chasm again as a Son of God and the created power of God is in him and at least whatever God command it can command it to be done it will be done and so we get back right God commands it watch that Union with us with him amen do you think he's on time always on time does he know what you got to go through he knows what you're going through will he make a way through it he has to amen and it'll always be by his word all right now verse chapter or paragraph 22 then Moses under the blood of bulls he met the light the pillar of fire in that burning bush and stood down there on a commission that God had given him and he was a prophet and when the word of the Lord came to him he spoke and even things were created by the word now watch and now verse 23 and now if it will do that under the blood of bulls what what about the blood of Jesus Christ not only covers but remits sin altogether and you stand in the presence of God as a redeemed son now see the church is far below its promised standard of living see see now we've grown up yes we're coming we real we're realizing it now see we're really coming into a maturity all right now he said but he's saying they're so far below they've got to grow other they got a greenness has got it baked out of them I think too many times we're probing instead of really coming out and facing the issue you all right now page 252 paragraph 45 he says remember if the truth is revealed I've already said this but say it again the truth is also Vindicated all right now now when Moses when Moses went out under the inspiration of god notice what he went out under the inspiration of God and said let flies come flies came right but who did he he Moses said but where' the inspiration come from Brother Braham said I've never saw a vision it was just an anointing come over me you need squirrels how many do you want say it see and many other times storm same way okay see he didn't move it and say it until he said say it but then the prophet out of his own mouth said it and you shall say Amen whatsoever you say then he didn't speak the word then he didn't he said and if he said let flies come and they didn't come then he didn't speak the word of the Lord he spoke his own word he might have thought there ought to be flies but no flies came because God hadn't told him so and when God tells you anything and says you go do this and I'll be right with you for this is my word and he shows it in the Bible then God stands right behind that and it's see it's revealed it's Vindicated stands right behind that it's not even written in the Bible if it's not even written in the Bible God stands behind it anyhow if it's God's word and then if it's outside of that it's revealed to prophets see you realize that all mysteries of God are made known to prophets and to them alone what do you do that for because God lord lord would do nothing but he reveals what he's going to to do is through his secrets of prophets he makes it manifest what's that ought to do to us gives us courage right because we are manifestors of that message that's why the message came amen we saw what God did he doesn't change okay now all right now I just let's see okay paragraph 50 okay I'm going to bypass some of this the word itself is Spirit it is Spirit in word form then you see when it's quickened it's brought to life and the spirit of the word goes to work in Acts he said look because look here a thought has to be a thought before it can be a word and then when a thought is presented it is a word now this Bible is God's thought that he has placed in the word and then we receive it what are we receiving we're receiving receiving the thought from him it becomes a word all right God revealed to Moses what to do and Moses spoke it and it happened that's when it really comes from God now we find out that stimulates that it gives Joy because it's God's word and the new wine stimulates when it reveals the word then it brings Joy beyond measure all right okay now let's go on I've just got just a couple more here 266 123 he says now we find him coming last night with his great sword let me just see here yeah sword of the word God's word the great sword we see him coming 1 Thessalonians 2 and we also 2 Thessalonians 2 we also see it in Revelations 19 he said he ALS he said out we find out that he also gets killed with the sword the sword of the word talking about the Antichrist God's word a sharp sword slays him puts him right down wait till those seven Thunders utter their voices have they are they yes all right to that group who is he speaking of to that group see to that group who really can take the word of God and hand it there it'll it will slice and cut they can close the heavens they can sh shut this or do that whatever they want to he said Glory he will be slain by the word that precedes from his mouth what's the Bible say the spirit of the Bride say she becomes the final voice yes all right where is it then all right where is this message where is that voice of the Resurrection all right it's sharper than any two-edged sword but they they again could call for a 100 billion milon tons of flies if they wanted to amen see what is it wanted to will what is the will of God his word okay whatever they're what whatever they say is going to happen because it's the word of God coming from the mouth of God Amen it's his word but he always uses man to work it amen God could call for those flies down in Egypt but he said Moses that's your job here's your Harmony now all right he said I'll tell you what to do will he tell us will he show us person individually will he show us it may be just as simple as in your in your home in your job where it is it may not it's not a public show brother sister amen amen it's not these things are not even known to the public it's not a public show but it's but but it's still being manifest whether it's they see it or don't see it or you see it alone all right it's always uses man to work it I'll just tell you what to do and you go do it he fully did that see and he chooses men all right now okay okay I'm not going to go there I've already gone that bleaches the sin out okay okay now one more I'm sorry I don't mean to well I've just I've just got to let you go here okay 214 I thought I was going to have a short time on this all right number 66 always we think that now watch this before being a word it is a thought I was coming right back to what he said before not the same quote and a thought has to be created how's the thought created through a word okay all right so God's thoughts became creation when they were spoken by a word so it's God's thoughts now watch what he says that's when he presents it to you as a thought his thoughts it's his thoughts and it's revealed to you then it's still a thought until you speak it amen on the inside of that Third Realm the next realm the Third Realm of the soul is predestinated by God that's where the real seed germ lays is in there that's our absolute that's our opinion all right all right now I'm closing now when it was now when it was now excuse me thou then if it was Jesus was the fullness of the of God manifested he was the fullness of the godhead bodily therefore when he came to the Earth was manifested in flesh you were in him then okay I've already read that quote I had a copy twice okay I'm sorry let's go on final thing now if we are those attributes of God this is things that are to be we cannot live by Creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the Bride is a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour my this day this promise it's fulfilled the bride not a Creed or denomination but a living Oracle what is the Oracle word a Living Word of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God watch displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we are now living amen AM stand with me praise the Lord a lot more could have been said obviously there's all kinds of quotes to go with this everywhere and you know what I'm glad we see it that way brother Paul I'm glad the people see it that way because it's so personalized now you know I don't have to even read quotes we just say it right let the people if they're in the word they're going to receive it they're going to know it they know what you're talking about is that right that's right but each one of us brings a word a little differently a little different way of ministering it and so we've got to just remain in our position you know that's what God wants us to do get our position and stay there amen praise the Lord I want to sing that song T so sweet is it to trust in Jesus trust in him put your whole soul in him just trust in him I think it was that scripture I read let me read it once again here this that Psalm 62 stood out to me yeah trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him God is a refuge for us we're hid in the secret of his Tabernacle aren't you glad you're hid raptured amen all right amen it is so sweet to trust in Jesus just to take him at his notice that's it just to rest upon his Pro just to know thus sayth the Lord Jesus Jesus how I
