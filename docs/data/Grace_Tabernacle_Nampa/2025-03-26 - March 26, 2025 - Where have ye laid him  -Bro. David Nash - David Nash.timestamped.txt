[2:48] Christ.
[2:51] Um, I'm having to use a different mic,
[2:53] so apologies for
[2:55] that.
[2:57] Um, see what we
[3:00] have. Let's go to number 730. I've been
[3:03] thinking about this song, and I don't
[3:06] think we've sang it since uh since
[3:08] Brother Jason, but I believe we know it.
[3:13] [Music]
[3:16] There's a light in the
[3:20] window shining there before
[3:24] me. Someone standing at the open
[3:30] door and I can see the crystal river and
[3:36] I know it'll be forever. Lord, I've
[3:40] never been this homesick
[3:45] before. Oh, see the bright light
[3:49] shine. It's just about home
[3:53] time. I can see my father standing at
[3:58] the
[4:00] door. This world is but a
[4:04] wilderness. I'm ready for deliverance.
[4:09] Oh Lord, I've never been this homeick
[4:15] before. And I can see the family
[4:20] gather. Each face they're all
[4:24] familiar. No one will be feeble
[4:31] anymore. And oh my lonesome heart is
[4:34] crying. I feel to spread my wings for
[4:38] flying. Lord, I've never been this
[4:42] homesick
[4:45] before. Oh, see the bright light shine.
[4:50] It's just about home
[4:53] time. I can see my father standing at
[4:58] the
[5:00] door. This world is but a wilderness.
[5:05] I'm ready for
[5:08] deliverance. Oh Lord, I've never been
[5:11] this home sick
[5:15] before. And what a day that will
[5:20] be. Each saint in
[5:24] victory walking through those gates
[5:27] forever
[5:30] more. And as we greet one another, every
[5:36] sister and every brother. Lord, I've
[5:40] never been this home sick
[5:44] before. Oh, see the bright light shine.
[5:49] It's just about home
[5:53] time. I can see my father standing at
[5:58] the door.
[6:00] This world is but a
[6:03] wilderness. I'm ready for
[6:07] deliverance. Oh Lord, I've never been
[6:10] this homeick before once more. Oh, see
[6:16] the bright light shine. It's just about
[6:21] home time.
[6:23] I can see my father standing at the
[6:29] door. This world is but a
[6:33] wilderness. I'm ready for
[6:37] deliverance. Oh Lord, I've never been
[6:40] this home sick
[6:45] before. Amen. Uh number 465
[6:49] [Music]
[6:54] please. The love of the Lord is
[7:01] perfect, converting the soul.
[7:07] The
[7:08] testimony of the Lord is
[7:13] pure, making wise the
[7:20] simple. More to be
[7:23] desired are they than gold, yay, than
[7:28] much fine gold.
[7:33] Sweeter also than
[7:39] honey and the honey
[7:45] cold. The statues of the Lord are
[7:52] right, rejoicing the heart.
[7:58] The commandment of the Lord is
[8:05] pure,
[8:06] enlightening the
[8:10] eyes. More to be
[8:14] desired are they than gold, yay, than
[8:19] much fine gold.
[8:24] Sweeter also than
[8:30] honey and the
[8:32] honey
[8:36] cold. The fear of the Lord is
[8:43] clean,
[8:44] enduring forever.
[8:47] [Music]
[8:50] The judgments of the Lord are
[8:55] true and righteous allto
[9:01] together. And in
[9:04] keeping them there is great
[9:08] reward. There is great
[9:14] reward. And in keeping of
[9:17] [Music]
[9:20] them there is great
[9:23] [Music]
[9:26] reward. Amen. Let's go to the key of C
[9:30] number

[9:41] [Music]
[9:43] Noah had
[9:49] drifted on the flood. Many
[9:55] days he searched for land.
[10:02] in various
[10:07] ways. Troules he had
[10:12] some but not from
[10:15] [Laughter]
[10:18] above. God gave him his
[10:23] son on the wings of a
[10:29] dove. On the wings of a
[10:33] snow white dove, God sends his pure
[10:40] sweet love aside from above.
[10:48] On the wings of a
[10:54] dove, Jesus our
[10:59] savior came to earth one
[11:05] day. He was born in a
[11:11] stable in a manger of hay.
[11:18] Though he
[11:20] [Music]
[11:22] rejected but not from
[11:25] [Laughter]
[11:28] above. God gave us his
[11:34] son. On the wings of a
[11:38] [Music]
[11:40] dove. On the wings of a snow.
[11:45] white dove. God sends his pure
[11:51] sweet love aside from
[11:58] above. on the wings of a
[12:04] dove. Though I have
[12:09] suffer in many a
[12:15] way. I cried for
[12:21] healing both night and day.
[12:27] [Music]
[12:28] Faith wasn't
[12:33] forgotten. By the father
[12:39] above, he gave me his
[12:42] [Music]
[12:45] son. On the wings of a dove.
[12:52] On the wings of a
[12:54] snow white dove, God sends his pure
[13:01] sweet love a sign from
[13:08] above. On the wings of a dove. Sing that
[13:12] again.
[13:15] Oh, on the wings of a
[13:17] snow
[13:19] white
[13:21] dove, God sends his pure,
[13:25] sweet love, a sign from
[13:30] [Music]
[13:32] above on the wings of a dove.
[13:36] [Music]
[13:40] Let's go to the key of D as we prepare
[13:41] for prayer number
[13:45] [Music]
[13:50] 235.
[13:52] Thank
[13:54] you
[13:58] Jesus for the things that you have done
[14:03] for us.
[14:06] Though I can't repay the love that you
[14:10] have given me, I thank
[14:15] you
[14:19] Lord.
[14:21] Thank
[14:23] you
[14:27] Jesus for the things that you have done
[14:32] for us.
[14:34] [Music]
[14:35] Though I can't repay the love that you
[14:40] have given me, I thank
[14:45] you Lord. One more
[14:48] time. I
[14:50] thank
[14:52] you,
[14:56] Jesus, for the things that you have done
[15:01] for
[15:03] us. Though I can't repay the love that
[15:08] you have given me, I thank
[15:13] you,
[15:17] Lord. Amen. We'll go to
[15:21] prayer. Uh let's remember brother uh
[15:24] brother David, sister Diane, sister Ruth
[15:26] as they travel and as well as brother
[15:29] Gideon. And um I haven't seen a report
[15:32] on baby Charlie, so we'll remember him
[15:35] in prayer as
[15:36] [Music]
[15:37] well. Amen. I don't have anything else,
[15:40] so let's just bow our
[15:41] heads. Gracious heavenly father, we come
[15:44] before you this
[15:45] evening, Lord, to give you praise,
[15:48] express our gratitude and thankfulness,
[15:50] Lord, for gathering us here together in
[15:54] one spirit. Lord, we just love you and
[15:56] thank you for all your grace and mercy
[15:57] to us, Lord. undeserving, but we still
[16:00] thank you and you're always faithful to
[16:03] be with us and to guide us and keep us,
[16:05] Lord. And we pray for these needs, Lord,
[16:07] for those who are traveling. I pray that
[16:09] you keep them safe, Lord, and just bring
[16:11] them to their destination and accomplish
[16:13] your will for this trip, Lord. I want to
[16:16] remember my brother Gideon. Just ask
[16:17] that you intervene, Lord, to touch him,
[16:21] Lord. Just restore him, Lord God. Just
[16:24] committing him into your hands, Lord.
[16:26] Pray that you have your way.
[16:28] We also pray for baby Charlie, Lord, as
[16:30] we have already been praying, Lord. And
[16:32] we believe that the answer is on the
[16:34] way, Lord. And just pray that the
[16:36] parents have faith and and hope that
[16:40] you're their deliverer, Lord, and you're
[16:41] the healer. And we just come before you
[16:44] bringing these needs, Lord. You see our
[16:46] hearts. You see our needs and desires.
[16:48] They're all open before you, Lord Jesus.
[16:50] So, we just leave them at your throne.
[16:52] We give you thanks, glory, and honor. I
[16:53] pray that you bless the service and that
[16:56] you be with us in the name of the Lord
[16:57] Jesus Christ.
[17:00] Amen.
[17:02] [Music]
[17:06] Amen. Listen number
[17:11] 560. Yes.
[17:14] [Music]
[17:17] Sometimes I feel
[17:21] discouraged and think my life in
[17:27] vain. I'm tempted then to
[17:32] murmur and of my Lord complain.
[17:39] But when I think of
[17:43] Jesus and all he's done for
[17:48] me, then I cry, "Oh rock of
[17:55] aes, high thou me.
[18:02] Oh rock of
[18:06] aes hide thou
[18:12] me. No other
[18:17] reuge have I but thee.
[18:22] [Music]
[18:23] When life's dark veil I
[18:28] wonder
[18:30] far far from
[18:33] thee. Then I cried, oh rock of
[18:38] [Music]
[18:40] aes, high thou me.
[18:46] Sometimes it seems I dare not go one
[18:53] step farther
[18:56] on. And from my heart all
[19:02] courage has slipped away and gone.
[19:09] But I
[19:11] remember
[19:13] Jesus and all his love for
[19:19] me. Then I cry, "Oh rock of
[19:25] aes, high thou me.
[19:33] Oh rock of
[19:37] aes hide thou
[19:42] me.
[19:44] No other
[19:48] reuge have I but thee.
[19:54] When life's dark veil I
[19:59] wonder far, far from
[20:04] thee. Then I cry, oh rock of
[20:10] agees, hide thou me.
[20:17] Oh, what a friend is
[20:21] Jesus. Such anor for my
[20:27] soul. So tender, true, and
[20:33] gracious. I'm safe and his
[20:38] control. My help in time of danger.
[20:45] My strong defense is
[20:49] he. Oh thou blessed rock of
[20:56] aes high thou
[21:01] me. Oh rock of
[21:07] aes high thou me.
[21:14] No other
[21:19] reuge have I but
[21:23] thee. When life's dark veil I
[21:30] wonder
[21:31] far far from
[21:34] thee. Then I cry.
[21:38] Rock of
[21:41] aes, high
[21:44] thou
[21:48] me.
[21:49] [Music]
[21:52] Amen. Why don't we stand together as
[21:54] brother David comes and
[21:57] sing? I'd rather have Jesus number 757.
[22:09] Hey, I'd
[22:11] rather have
[22:14] Jesus than
[22:17] silver or
[22:19] gold. I'd
[22:22] rather be
[22:24] his than have
[22:27] riches untold.
[22:29] [Music]
[22:31] I'd
[22:32] rather have
[22:35] Jesus than
[22:38] hell or land.
[22:42] I'd
[22:43] rather be
[22:46] led by his
[22:48] nail scarred
[22:51] hand than to
[22:53] be a
[22:56] king of a
[22:59] vast domain.
[23:01] [Music]
[23:02] and be
[23:04] held in
[23:06] sin dreads
[23:11] away. I'd
[23:14] rather have
[23:17] Jesus than
[23:22] anything this
[23:25] world
[23:27] affords to today.
[23:33] I'd
[23:35] rather have
[23:37] Jesus than
[23:40] men's
[23:42] applause. I'd
[23:45] rather be
[23:48] faithful to
[23:50] his dear cause.
[23:54] I'd
[23:55] rather have
[23:58] Jesus than
[24:01] worldwide fame.
[24:04] I'd rather rather be
[24:08] true to his
[24:12] holy
[24:14] name than to
[24:16] be the
[24:19] king of a
[24:23] vast
[24:25] domain and be
[24:27] held in sin
[24:31] and
[24:36] sway. I'd
[24:38] rather have
[24:41] Jesus than
[24:46] anything this
[24:49] world
[24:52] affords to today.
[24:58] And he's
[24:59] fairer than
[25:03] liies of
[25:06] rare
[25:08] bloom. He's
[25:10] sweeter than
[25:13] honey from out of the
[25:18] cold. He's all that my
[25:23] [Music]
[25:25] hungry
[25:27] spirit needs.
[25:30] I'd
[25:32] rather have
[25:35] Jesus and
[25:37] let him
[25:40] lead than to
[25:43] be the
[25:46] king of a
[25:49] vast domain.
[25:52] and be
[25:54] held in
[25:57] sins dread
[26:02] sway. I'd
[26:05] rather have Jesus.
[26:11] [Music]
[26:21] Hey, thank
[26:23] you. Praise the Lord. I was glad when
[26:27] they said, "Let us go into the house of
[26:29] the Lord."
[26:31] I'm happy to be here this evening and
[26:33] thank brother Paul for the invitation to
[26:35] speak to you. It's always a pleasure and
[26:38] an honor to speak to the bride of Jesus
[26:41] Christ. And you know, sometimes we get
[26:43] in churches and we look around, boy,
[26:45] there's where did everybody go?
[26:48] And and uh you know there's a spot there
[26:52] in Zechariah where it says uh who hath
[26:55] despised the day of small things. That's
[26:57] right. So we know that God watches out
[27:00] for the small things. And uh the other
[27:04] thing about it is I remember one time I
[27:07] was in college and I don't remember
[27:09] biology what class I was out there in
[27:11] the fields for and I was sitting by a
[27:13] highway and these big trucks are roaring
[27:16] past.
[27:17] couple of big trucks go by and other
[27:19] than that it was kind of out in the
[27:20] country so there wasn't many people
[27:22] looking and I happened to look down and
[27:23] there was a crack in the highway and I
[27:26] thought wow and I looked but there was
[27:29] color in the crack and there were some
[27:31] little tiny tiny flowers growing down in
[27:35] that crack and here you had those big
[27:37] trucks that would have smashed him in an
[27:39] instant just inches away from the top of
[27:42] them little those little tiny flowers
[27:45] and I thought what a god God that we
[27:48] that we serve that he would make little
[27:50] tiny flowers to grow in the crack of a
[27:52] highway. And I just so if you another
[27:58] scripture he said there's if there's two
[28:00] or three of you here praise the Lord and
[28:03] said that he's here and that's what we
[28:06] come for any that's what I come for
[28:08] anyway. And then the other thing when we
[28:10] think about it in Hebrews the I think
[28:12] it's the 13th chapter or 12th chapter I
[28:15] forgot which he said that you know that
[28:17] we're encompassed about by a great cloud
[28:19] of witnesses and sometimes I have to
[28:21] remind myself and I look around and that
[28:26] other realm is you know we're getting
[28:28] closer and closer and closer. It's
[28:30] coming down and we're actually moving up
[28:34] and there could this place could be
[28:36] thousands in here tonight in a great
[28:39] coliseum that we can't see. But you know
[28:42] what? They have to hear the same end
[28:45] time gospel that we hear because the
[28:48] gospel they had in their age is enough
[28:51] to bring a resurrection.
[28:53] But in uh I remember I forgot which tape
[28:56] it was but he he said that you know the
[28:58] first shall be last the last shall be
[29:00] first and how he said that what that is
[29:03] is the people that are here in the last
[29:06] age are the ones that will receive as it
[29:09] were that double anointing or we would
[29:11] call it a bride anointing which is
[29:13] enough for us to walk in
[29:15] without dying
[29:17] actually. But he said when when that
[29:20] anointing strikes us that we will turn
[29:23] around and call for the previous age. He
[29:26] said because we know who they are. Yeah.
[29:29] You know the brother sergeants, the
[29:30] brother all the different people that
[29:32] you know Paul's parents, we could just
[29:34] go on and on. And then they will as they
[29:37] receive the anointing, then they will
[29:40] turn and call for the next age and the
[29:42] next age and the next age until the last
[29:46] or the first will be the last ones to
[29:49] come forth and the last will be the
[29:52] first. So
[29:55] never I try to never limit God in
[29:58] knowing these things. It encourages me
[30:01] and like I said, it's a privilege to be
[30:04] here tonight. So, let's just bow our
[30:06] heads. Thank you, sister. That's so
[30:07] beautiful. God bless you. Uh, heavenly
[30:10] father, we as we get ready to approach
[30:13] your word, I'm I'm asking you, Lord,
[30:16] show us, lead us, guide us, direct us
[30:19] because, Father, there's so much water
[30:21] under the bridge and so much time has
[30:24] passed since we were here last. God,
[30:26] what a privilege to be here again
[30:28] tonight. So I give you this service and
[30:30] above all things Lord I give you myself.
[30:34] Lord get me out of the way that you can
[30:37] speak hearttoheart from your heart to
[30:39] the heart of your people through this
[30:41] vessel that they might receive something
[30:43] from you that when they walk away from
[30:46] this place tonight if we would walk away
[30:48] Lord Jesus that they be closer to you in
[30:52] Jesus Christ's name.
[30:55] Amen. Praise the Lord. I was telling you
[30:59] know the brother that wow I've got about
[31:03] three different things and sometimes I
[31:06] look at it like a smorgus board. You
[31:08] pray what for what you need. You know
[31:10] you go to one of those big places and
[31:12] they got all this food. Well, you know I
[31:15] go for the meat and the
[31:17] dessert or sometimes I just go for the
[31:20] salads. So you pray and we'll see what
[31:24] the Lord will do. I was trying to make
[31:27] sure that I, you know, I like to not
[31:29] repeat, but uh I know
[31:32] that some my wife in particular has said
[31:36] that, you know, she likes it about the
[31:37] fourth time because then I've got all
[31:39] the stuff that doesn't need to be there
[31:41] out. So, so but since we were here last
[31:45] while, we did 12 services in 14 days in
[31:48] Nicaragua. I was in uh down to brother
[31:51] Stans in Florida. We've been to Canada.
[31:54] We've been to brother Riches. We spoke
[31:56] last weekend in Fresno. And
[32:01] uh so if my head's a little fuzzy, you
[32:04] you please forgive me and pray for me.
[32:07] Let's turn to
[32:09] uh and I know you're familiar with this
[32:12] story. It's John the 11th chapter. And
[32:14] it's not just a story. It's actually
[32:17] factual. And
[32:29] uh and this is where Lazarus has uh was
[32:34] sick and they sent to have Jesus come.
[32:37] And when uh he doesn't come and he
[32:39] doesn't come and he doesn't come and
[32:42] then finally he turns to the disciples
[32:45] and says, "Lazarus sleeps. let's go wake
[32:48] him. And so as that transpires, the
[32:52] disciples, they don't really understand.
[32:53] They go, "Oh, if he sleeps, then he's
[32:54] going to be okay." But Jesus has to just
[32:57] tell him, "Look, he's dead."
[32:59] Okay? And you know, that'll be like
[33:01] modern terms. That's guys, he's he's
[33:03] gone. He's dead. And so he uh goes down
[33:07] to where the place is, and we'll pick it
[33:09] up, and I'll read a chunk of that story
[33:12] or the what it says about it. And as
[33:16] he's coming down, he comes to
[33:19] Martha and
[33:22] uh says, well, start I guess it's about
[33:25] I'm having a little hard time. I walked
[33:27] off without my glasses. Verse 16. So
[33:30] it's chapter 11 verse
[33:32] 16
[33:34] or maybe it's 18. Now Bethany was nigh
[33:37] unto Jerusalem about 15 furlongs off.
[33:42] And many of the of the Has anybody got
[33:45] any
[33:46] readers? Thank you. Boy, I'm working out
[33:50] of a new Bible. And this little tiny
[33:52] letters. Thank you. Oh, wow. Look at
[33:54] that. I can see the the letters again.
[33:57] I'm sorry. And many of the Jews came to
[33:59] Martha and to Mary to comfort them
[34:01] concerning their brother. Then Martha,
[34:03] as soon as she heard that Jesus was
[34:04] coming, went and met him. But Mary sat
[34:07] still in the house. Then said Martha
[34:09] unto Jesus,"Lord, if thou had been here,
[34:12] my brother had not died. But I know that
[34:14] even now whatsoever thou wil ask of God,
[34:16] God will give it to thee." Jesus saith
[34:18] unto her, "Thy brother shall rise
[34:20] again." Martha saith unto him, I know
[34:22] that he shall rise again in the
[34:23] resurrection at the last day. Jesus said
[34:27] unto her, I am the resurrection and the
[34:30] life. He that believeth in me, though he
[34:32] were dead, yet shall he live.
[34:37] And whosoever that liveth and believeth
[34:39] in me shall never die believest thou
[34:41] this? She said unto him, Yay, Lord, I
[34:44] believe that thou art the Christ, the
[34:45] Son of the living God, that should come
[34:47] into the world. And when she had thus
[34:49] said, she went her way and called Mary
[34:51] her sister secretly, saying, The Master
[34:53] has come and calls for thee. And as soon
[34:56] as she heard that, she arose quickly and
[34:58] came unto him. Now Jesus was not yet
[35:01] come into the town, but was in the place
[35:03] where Martha met him. And the Jews
[35:05] therefore that were with her in the
[35:07] house, and comforted her, when they saw
[35:09] Mary, that she rose up, hastily, went
[35:11] out, and followed her, saying, She goes
[35:13] unto the grave to weep
[35:15] there. Now then, when Mary was come
[35:19] where Jesus was, she saw him, and she
[35:21] fell down at his feet, saying unto him,
[35:23] "Lord, if thou hast been here, my
[35:25] brother had not died." What did we just
[35:28] see? She's given the exact same
[35:30] testimony that her sister gave.
[35:34] Bible says if any two can agree on any
[35:37] one thing they can have what they ask
[35:39] for. So we continue just a couple more
[35:43] verses. Uh thy brother had not had died.
[35:46] Then when Jesus therefore saw her
[35:48] weeping and the Jews also weeping which
[35:51] came with her, he groaned in his spirit
[35:53] and was troubled. And he said, "Where
[35:56] have you laid him?" They said unto him,
[35:58] "Lord, come and see." Gracious heavenly
[36:01] father, we've read your word, a long
[36:03] portion, Lord, but you're able to break
[36:05] it out and take the little nuggets as we
[36:08] call it out, Lord, to speak to hearts in
[36:10] Jesus name. Amen. Please be
[36:14] seated. As we look at this portion of
[36:18] scripture, it gives us kind of a a vivid
[36:22] picture of what was going on at this
[36:24] particular time. We know that Jesus had
[36:27] waited and waited and waited knowing
[36:30] that God was going to manifest himself
[36:33] in a special way. He waited until
[36:36] Lazarus had passed away. And then when
[36:40] he goes to that uh down there to see
[36:43] him, the first thing that he comes to,
[36:45] of course, was Martha. And here was
[36:48] Martha, a real believer in that Jesus
[36:51] was the Messiah. And and she makes that
[36:55] statement, bold statement, if my you
[36:57] know, if you had been here, my brother
[36:59] had not have died. And so she's showing
[37:02] that she had faith in that whatever. And
[37:05] then she says after that, whatever the
[37:08] you know, I know that God hears your
[37:09] prayers and whatever he tells you or
[37:12] whatever you ask for, God can give it to
[37:14] you. So she's extending that faith not
[37:17] only to the fact that if you would have
[37:19] been here she's saying you know it's
[37:21] still possible
[37:23] and so she as she is looking at that
[37:27] uh and she then she begins you know
[37:30] Jesus the watch carefully the how the
[37:34] the scripture lays this out because the
[37:36] next thing that Jesus said is thy
[37:38] brother shall rise again. Now what is
[37:42] that that he's
[37:44] telling? He said thy brother shall rise
[37:47] again. And as he says thy thy brother
[37:50] shall rise again. He is actually giving
[37:53] a prophesy or prophesying of an event
[37:57] that is about to transpire. He is
[38:00] speaking or prophesying that that
[38:04] Lazarus is going to come forth. Now, the
[38:06] common uh as it were doctrine of the
[38:09] day, she'd been around the Pharisees.
[38:11] She believed in a resurrection. And as
[38:13] she believes in the resurrection and
[38:15] such, you know, she said, "Yay, Lord, I
[38:18] know that he's going to come forth again
[38:21] at the resurrection at the last day."
[38:23] Good doctrine, right? Beautiful
[38:25] doctrine. You know, it's and that
[38:28] portion of scripture, that doctrine
[38:31] about the resurrection at the end at the
[38:33] at the last day is still waiting in
[38:35] front of us, right? As it were, you
[38:38] know, cons considering as the bride of
[38:40] Jesus Christ will be taken out of the
[38:42] way before that great judgment day
[38:44] appears. And so, it's good doctrine all
[38:47] the way down. But watch what Jesus said
[38:50] after that because at that point he said
[38:55] she's given him good doctrine but the
[38:58] word always corrects the error right
[39:02] because there's something special about
[39:04] to take place and the word correcting
[39:07] the error said I am the resurrection.
[39:12] this thing that we call resurrection
[39:14] isn't uh some event that we're waiting
[39:17] for and then we're going to oh wow look
[39:20] at this. No, the I am is the
[39:23] resurrection.
[39:26] I am the resurrection. God himself is
[39:30] our resurrection.
[39:33] It's a person, the person of the I am
[39:37] God under the name of Jesus Christ
[39:40] because he's the one spake speaking it
[39:42] as the son of God. But the God of the
[39:46] resurrection is the I am God who's
[39:49] living. We would call it the father
[39:51] living in the son. And he's telling them
[39:54] this is the correction to what you're
[39:56] looking for in a resurrection. I am is
[40:00] the resurrection. No, I am. Forget it,
[40:03] man. You're not going
[40:06] anyway. You know, you see these bumper
[40:08] stickers. I haven't seen one for a
[40:09] while, but used to say, you know, in
[40:12] case of rapture, this car is going to
[40:13] crash or whatever. Well, I can't say one
[40:17] way or the other. I can't judge that.
[40:20] But you know what? If they don't have
[40:23] the I am living on the inside, they're
[40:27] not going to be there. It's just that
[40:29] simple. They'll make it to the other
[40:31] resurrection
[40:32] that that Martha was talking about, but
[40:35] they're not going to make it to that
[40:36] first one. Because then he continues. He
[40:39] said, "Though he were dead, yet shall he
[40:41] live." He just gives that
[40:43] description. Those who died in the
[40:46] Christ of their
[40:48] day, they will live again because of the
[40:52] I am that they represented in each
[40:55] ensuing age behind as it were. And he
[40:58] said but but he that is alive and remain
[41:02] you I am the resurrection and the life
[41:04] and the the word life there is actually
[41:06] Zoey which means God's life or it
[41:10] actually is life
[41:13] life. There is no mention of death
[41:17] whatsoever in that
[41:20] word. So he said I am the resurrection
[41:22] and I am life. That is eternal life,
[41:26] God's life. And he said, "And and he
[41:29] that's alive shall receive that
[41:32] portion." And the only qualification
[41:35] that he gives, and I I think he says it
[41:37] twice there, is do you believe
[41:41] this? And whosoever believeth or liveth
[41:44] and believeth in me shall never die. Do
[41:46] you believe it? Believest thou this?
[41:49] Yeah. And
[41:51] so and she said yay Lord I believe that
[41:54] thou art the Christ the son of God which
[41:56] should come into the world. So twice
[41:59] there he said the believe believe. He is
[42:03] saying that the the qualification is you
[42:06] must believe that he is the I am and
[42:09] that the I am is the person of the
[42:11] resurrection and the person of what we
[42:14] would call the rapture or the the
[42:16] ability to step from this life into
[42:19] another life without death. And so it's
[42:23] a person. It's not something we're
[42:26] waiting for. It's something that we get
[42:28] on the inside of us. It's something that
[42:30] we what how did he bring as we continue
[42:33] with this? What was the first thing he
[42:35] said to do about it? He prophesies, "Thy
[42:39] brother shall rise again." And she said,
[42:41] "Yeah." And then he says, "Uh, you well,
[42:44] you know, that's good doctrine, but I am
[42:48] is the resurrection and the life." And
[42:50] he has just prophesied how that
[42:53] resurrection and life is going to come
[42:56] on the scene. It's by words of prophecy.
[42:59] What's words of prophecy? This whole
[43:01] book is a prophecy about God, about
[43:05] Jesus
[43:06] Christ in
[43:08] God. God revealing himself in Jesus
[43:12] Christ. And so as he continued on
[43:15] there, she goes her way and she calls
[43:18] Mary. And when she calls Mary, her
[43:20] sister secretly, uh, she said, "Hey, the
[43:24] master's come and he calls for you." And
[43:27] as soon as she heard that, she rises
[43:29] quickly or rose quickly and comes to
[43:32] him. And they weren't uh says Jesus was
[43:36] not yet come into the town, but they
[43:38] were in that place where Martha had met
[43:40] him. So they're outside the
[43:43] town, outside the camp.
[43:48] Where have we heard that before? And you
[43:50] go back into the Levitical laws, the
[43:52] Exodus, all those things. And where was
[43:56] the resurrection? Where were those
[43:58] things? Where were the as it were, the
[44:01] ashes to the lamb? Where was the the the
[44:04] sacrifice made? Outside the camp. So
[44:08] here he is outside the camp and he's
[44:10] meeting with his believers outside of
[44:13] the religious system because all the
[44:15] Jews and stuff are there outside of the
[44:17] religious system, outside of the the
[44:20] political systems, outside of
[44:23] everything. He was not yet come to the
[44:26] town, but was in this place where Martha
[44:27] met him. And the Jews then which were
[44:30] with her in the house comforted her. And
[44:33] when they saw Mary, she rose up. They
[44:36] went out and they followed her, saying,
[44:37] "She goes to the grave to weep
[44:41] there." And so, watch what happens. The
[44:45] believer goes out. Mary goes out. She
[44:49] meets Jesus, but she doesn't go out by
[44:52] herself. There is a group of
[44:54] people crying and weeping. And you know,
[44:59] they used to even hire people to weep at
[45:01] at funerals. And here you have these
[45:04] Jews and they're oh, you know, and are
[45:07] all distraught and all upset about
[45:10] it. And here they are following her out
[45:14] there and
[45:18] uh and they're saying, "Oh, she's going
[45:20] to the g the grave to weep there for her
[45:23] brother." and and when she comes to him,
[45:26] she falls at his feet and she
[45:28] says,"Lord, if you had been here, my
[45:30] brother had not have died." And there's
[45:32] that testimony again in total one-
[45:36] on-one agreement almost. I believe it's
[45:39] word for word there with what her sister
[45:41] had said. If any two agree on any one
[45:45] thing, you can have what you ask
[45:48] for. So, here they are agreeing on this.
[45:52] their faith has come together. They both
[45:55] believe that had Jesus been there, he
[45:57] had not have died. And Mary, I mean
[46:00] Martha took it the next step to say,
[46:02] "Nevertheless, whatever you ask, God
[46:05] will do." And so as she says this and
[46:07] they go there,
[46:11] uh it says when Jesus therefore saw her
[46:14] weeping and the Jews also weeping which
[46:17] came with her, he groaned in the spirit
[46:20] and was troubled. I want to labor on
[46:23] this just for a few minutes because
[46:26] there's those are special words when you
[46:28] look at the how they come out of the
[46:30] Greek. They have special definitions
[46:33] just as we have, you know, words with
[46:35] multiple definitions. When it says that
[46:38] he groaned, it means that he sized like
[46:41] we would
[46:42] go or shag grin or it also means to
[46:46] straightly charge or to murmur like what
[46:49] do these guys want? It's kind of a so
[46:51] it's it's like this, but it even goes a
[46:54] little bit further in it. It has the
[46:57] second word in the definition which
[47:00] takes it on a little more power perhaps
[47:02] is
[47:04] indignation which means he was actually
[47:06] kind of angry about it. He was upset. It
[47:10] was bothering him that these people came
[47:14] out. But behind those particular words
[47:17] is where it begins to get interesting
[47:19] because as you go through it in the
[47:20] Greek it comes forth as you know this
[47:23] word is this but it actually came from
[47:25] this which came from this and it starts
[47:28] breaking it down and you know in
[47:30] English-speaking countries we usually
[47:32] tend to start it at what from the left
[47:34] and we go to the right and we tend to
[47:36] make it bigger as it goes but both the
[47:38] Hebrew and a lot of times in the Greek
[47:41] they start with the big part first and
[47:43] then they get smaller and smaller and
[47:45] smaller to get it down to what the
[47:47] actual root of the meaning
[47:50] is. Do you
[47:52] understand? And so it actually as you
[47:56] begin to break it down, it says that
[47:59] this word groaned, it's he's standing
[48:02] between in a fixed
[48:05] position
[48:06] between time, place, and a relation of
[48:10] rest. And it can mean in, it can mean up
[48:14] and it can can be it's a place
[48:17] between and it has that part breaks down
[48:20] into two words. So he's standing between
[48:24] time and a place and then the other part
[48:27] is purpose.
[48:30] So he is groaning or he's kind of upset
[48:33] about this because he has a purpose to
[48:37] be there and he's looking at what these
[48:40] people are doing and crying and weeping
[48:42] and he's already announced I am the the
[48:46] resurrection and the life. He's already
[48:48] prophesied thy brother shall rise again.
[48:51] And so here he is troubled at this. He's
[48:54] indignant about it. And the last part of
[48:57] that definition was it it's uh the
[49:01] purpose to go to the origin
[49:05] point. I want that to sink in the origin
[49:10] point. He is taking it back to in the
[49:14] beginning was the word. The word was
[49:18] with God and the word you know is God.
[49:21] And so he is standing there with the
[49:23] purpose to take us to the origin of why
[49:27] he's even there.
[49:30] important because the next
[49:33] word says that he was troubled and that
[49:36] means stirred up agitated and I thought
[49:39] this part was ining interesting because
[49:41] it says to to royal like water and
[49:44] that's ro o i l which means it's like
[49:48] and and the description it gave as in
[49:51] when water is just starting to
[49:55] boil. So, what's going on in the heart
[49:58] of
[49:59] Jesus? He is there. He's just had this
[50:03] wonderful testimony from his two
[50:05] believers. And here's all these Jews and
[50:07] they're weeping. And he's groaning. He's
[50:10] a little bit upset about what's
[50:12] happening with all these other people.
[50:14] They're not believers like Marth Martha
[50:17] and and Mary. And he's troubled in his
[50:21] spirit because he's there with a
[50:23] purpose. And that purpose is to go back
[50:26] to the origin of where the earth the the
[50:29] word came from in the first place. He is
[50:31] taking us back to the I am God who is
[50:35] the resurrection and the life. He's
[50:38] actually troubled because he is
[50:40] expecting the I am God to be on the
[50:44] scene. And he is there with that purpose
[50:47] and it's troubling him at what he's
[50:50] witnessing in front of him.
[50:53] And so as he looks at
[50:57] this, he groans in his spirit and and it
[51:00] says that he was troubled. So he's he's
[51:02] like water that's about to boil. He's,
[51:06] you know, this inside of him, this
[51:08] spirit is is starting to build up to
[51:10] where he's going to just boil over and
[51:14] maybe thinking he ought to rebuke him or
[51:16] something. I I don't know what's going
[51:18] through his head, but he's boiling over.
[51:20] He's upset. He's right to the place to
[51:22] where he wants to
[51:25] boil. Wow. And he's standing there at
[51:29] the origin point with a purpose. And
[51:33] he's about to boil or to come forth like
[51:36] water that is being released from its
[51:39] water and going into the heavenlies. The
[51:41] boiling point.
[51:44] H interesting when you really look at
[51:46] some of these things, I think. And so
[51:52] uh
[51:54] then because the water is turning back
[51:57] into water vapor or
[52:03] air, air laden with water. And so as we
[52:07] look at this, he's troubled and then he
[52:10] speaks these words. And this is really
[52:12] if we were to put a title on this
[52:14] tonight. And he said, "Where have you
[52:17] laid
[52:20] him?" What words do you think he didn't
[52:25] know? Right. Right.
[52:29] Honestly, he had already told him,
[52:31] "Well, he's dead and he's told them all
[52:33] this thing and he's made his prophecy
[52:35] and he's declared the witness to the
[52:38] word or the correction as it were of the
[52:40] error." And so he's turning and he's
[52:42] about to boil inside of him and he turns
[52:45] to
[52:46] them. Where have you laid him? He's
[52:49] asking them, "Where have you laid him?"
[52:53] Oh my. Oh my. He's not asking for
[52:56] himself. He is posing that question to
[53:00] them. Where have you laid him?
[53:05] Well, and so and they said unto him,
[53:10] "Lord, come and see." And so they're
[53:12] telling him, "Well, well, we we'll show
[53:14] you, you know, just just come along with
[53:16] us and we'll show you." And then, of
[53:18] course, it says that Jesus wept and and
[53:21] how, you know, if we were to read on
[53:23] down and they're saying, "Well, man,
[53:25] this is the guy that opened the blinds
[53:27] uh blinded eyes and all that. Couldn't
[53:29] he done something for his friend?" And
[53:31] and so these are the things these are
[53:33] the things that that's going on in the
[53:35] conversation behind him. And and as he
[53:38] looks at it, but that question keeps
[53:41] recurring at least to me in my heart and
[53:44] mind this question is where have you
[53:46] laid him? Well, who's him that he's
[53:48] talking about? Who is
[53:51] him? Well, it's Lazarus, right? Yeah,
[53:57] it's actually Lazarus.
[53:59] Where have you laid
[54:03] Lazarus? Do you And as we begin to look
[54:07] at when he says where have you laid,
[54:10] that means to where have you stretched
[54:13] him out pro prostate? Is that how you
[54:16] say it?
[54:18] Prostrate. Those two words confuse me
[54:20] from time to time. I'm sorry. But
[54:23] they're saying that they they've got him
[54:25] stretched out on a stone somewhere is
[54:27] what it boils down to. And so here he is
[54:29] stretched out because he been he's been
[54:32] laid down. He has been took he's been
[54:34] all wrapped up in these in these
[54:37] gravecloths and stuff. And if they've
[54:39] got him laid out flat on a rock
[54:42] someplace and as he's laying there in
[54:45] that position, but we go right back to
[54:48] who is it? Well, it's
[54:52] Lazarus. Where have you laid Lazarus?
[54:55] Where have you put Lazarus? like a dead
[54:59] man. Where is Lazarus that's all wrapped
[55:02] up in death clothes? Right? I want to
[55:05] know where this guy Lazarus is. Is he's
[55:08] my friend and I want to go see
[55:11] him. But and so he's saying, "Where have
[55:14] you laid Lazarus?" Well, we look at the
[55:16] name the name Lazarus. What is he
[55:20] actually speaking to that crowd of
[55:23] people that he's about to boil over at
[55:27] the boiling point or at the point of
[55:29] origin because he's there for a purpose
[55:32] and he says where have you got Lazarus
[55:36] outstretched and wrapped up like a dead
[55:38] man and Lazarus means the stren like
[55:42] strength the strong one the ram the
[55:46] chief or the highest the the posts of
[55:51] the door. That's the part that holds up
[55:55] this all the the stuff above it. And
[55:59] this is I'm just telling you what
[56:01] Lazarus means. And it's the post of the
[56:03] door, the oak
[56:07] tree. That's part of the name of
[56:10] Lazarus. The oak tree. Huh. The lentil.
[56:14] Or that's the, you know, the part at the
[56:16] top of the door. And the lintil, the
[56:19] strong body, the twist and strength, the
[56:23] powerful one, the mighty
[56:27] strength. This is Lazarus. He is asking
[56:31] them, "Where have you laid the strength
[56:35] of the Almighty?" Like it's dead.
[56:42] Where have you put it? Where have you
[56:46] put the strong and mighty one of God?
[56:50] Where have you put the
[56:53] ram? Michael, Michael, the the
[56:58] archangel, where have you put the one
[57:01] that holds up the ceiling and the roof
[57:03] and all that? Where have you put the
[57:06] lentil to the
[57:10] door? The door? Who's the door? H right.
[57:16] Yeah. Jesus said, "I am the door." Where
[57:21] have you put the strength? Where have
[57:24] you put the strong body, the powerful
[57:28] one, the chief or the
[57:30] highest? Where have you put him so that
[57:34] it looks like he's dead and wrapped up
[57:37] and
[57:39] finished? And there's one more. We
[57:42] mentioned it. The oak tree. What does
[57:45] that have to do with these other
[57:48] things? The oak tree, you know, I've
[57:52] been had the privilege, the honor to be
[57:54] in Israel, I think three or four times,
[57:56] three times anyway. And how that we had
[58:00] u brother Ruven, God bless him, a Jewish
[58:04] Christian man. I believe he was born in
[58:06] Israel. He was the guide for us with
[58:08] when with brother George Smith when we
[58:10] went and I would call him one I known a
[58:14] lot but a couple times when I had
[58:15] certain Bible questions because he was
[58:17] like a Bible
[58:19] encyclopedia and I asked him one time
[58:22] was because I was uh doing a little
[58:24] study on the plains of memory and I
[58:26] mentioned and he said well I can't go
[58:29] there now because it's Palestinian
[58:31] territory but I'll tell you this much
[58:34] David I've been there when I was younger
[58:36] And he said, "The oak tree is still
[58:40] there."
[58:42] 4,000
[58:43] years and the oak tree is still there.
[58:46] So what's it talking about? Because
[58:49] Jesus is saying, "Where is the oak tree
[58:54] experience? Where have you put it so
[58:58] it's dead?
[59:01] Why have you bound it up and laid it on
[59:05] a slab of
[59:07] rock? What is it? Well, it was remember
[59:12] Melzdc. That was the place where Melzdc
[59:16] met with
[59:17] Abraham. And he's asking him where is
[59:21] your personal MelzDC experience?
[59:29] Think about it. It's all in that name.
[59:32] Just all just laying there in that name.
[59:34] And he's saying, "You have the mighty
[59:37] strength of Israel, the experience of
[59:40] Melzdc with Abraham, of whom you're
[59:43] supposed to be the seed of Abraham, and
[59:46] you've got it wrapped up in death
[59:48] clothes. Where have we laid him?
[59:56] Where is Lazarus? Where is that
[1:00:01] experience
[1:00:03] that could turn and say, "Where's your
[1:00:06] wife
[1:00:07] Sarah?" He said, "Well, she's in the
[1:00:09] tent behind
[1:00:11] me." And he said, "Why did she
[1:00:14] laugh?" She didn't even laugh outside
[1:00:17] out loud. Bible said she laughed within
[1:00:20] herself. And if you want to really get
[1:00:22] into some grace tonight and you go
[1:00:25] further into those same scriptures and
[1:00:28] eventually it comes back to Sarah and
[1:00:30] she said when she has the child she said
[1:00:33] God made me
[1:00:36] [Music]
[1:00:37] laugh was all part of the plan and we
[1:00:41] think we know I think I know something
[1:00:43] about all this stuff.
[1:00:45] No, God made her laugh so that he could
[1:00:48] display who he was as Melzdc and the oak
[1:00:52] tree
[1:00:54] experience. And Jesus is asking him
[1:00:57] where have you put that experience and
[1:01:00] why does he look dead and wrapped up in
[1:01:03] grave
[1:01:04] clothes? Where have we laid him?
[1:01:11] And so we look at that and we know that
[1:01:14] what happens after that he comes down
[1:01:17] and they make the statement you know
[1:01:19] couldn't he have opened the he opened
[1:01:20] the eyes of the blind couldn't he done
[1:01:22] this so his brother you know Lazarus
[1:01:24] didn't die and
[1:01:27] uh when he comes to the grave I mean
[1:01:29] down in verse
[1:01:31] 3839 he comes to the cave and the stone
[1:01:34] was lay upon it and Jesus said take away
[1:01:38] the stone
[1:01:40] stone. He is telling them that behind
[1:01:44] the
[1:01:45] stone is where Lazarus is. He says, you
[1:01:48] know, take away the stone. Why is he
[1:01:51] saying this to them when he's asked that
[1:01:54] question? Where have you laid the mighty
[1:01:57] strength of God? And whose uh
[1:02:01] responsibility is it to move the stone?
[1:02:04] Well, we know what stones represent
[1:02:06] because it was Peter on that day in when
[1:02:10] and Jesus asked him, "Whom do you say
[1:02:12] that I am?" And and Peter comes back,
[1:02:16] you know, he's pointing the finger to
[1:02:18] everybody else. Well, you might be
[1:02:19] doctrine number 377 or you might be a
[1:02:23] certain minister or a certain church or
[1:02:25] a certain country. I mean, they got all
[1:02:27] kinds of
[1:02:28] stuff in what we call the message of the
[1:02:31] hour. And so Peter is saying, "Well, it
[1:02:34] could be this, could be that." You know,
[1:02:35] maybe and and and Jesus asks that
[1:02:38] question, and I love to ask it. Who do
[1:02:40] you say that he is?
[1:02:43] Who do you say that he is? And where
[1:02:45] have you laid him?
[1:02:49] And
[1:02:51] so he says it's their
[1:02:53] responsibility to roll the stone away to
[1:02:58] take the
[1:03:00] revelation because Jesus said flesh and
[1:03:02] blood didn't reveal this but my father
[1:03:04] which is in heaven revealed this uh unto
[1:03:07] you and on this
[1:03:11] uh on this is what I'll build my church
[1:03:13] on the revelation and he's saying, "Roll
[1:03:18] the revelation so that you can see the
[1:03:21] glory of
[1:03:22] Israel and see that it's been laid down
[1:03:25] as though it's
[1:03:27] dead." That the experience that Abraham
[1:03:31] had will be before
[1:03:34] you if you take and move the
[1:03:40] stone." And
[1:03:42] so they do it. And and of course, you
[1:03:45] know, Martha, Lord, he stinks. He's been
[1:03:48] dead for four days. Like, do you really
[1:03:50] want us to do
[1:03:51] this? Yeah, I do. And he said, "Set I
[1:03:55] not unto thee that if thou would
[1:03:57] believe, you would see the glory of
[1:03:59] God." What's he do? He goes right back
[1:04:02] to the only requirement for this whole
[1:04:07] process. Did I already tell you if you
[1:04:09] believe it, you'll see it?
[1:04:12] Friends, if you want to see the glory of
[1:04:14] God, believe it. Yes. If you want to see
[1:04:18] that dead man come
[1:04:20] forth, roll back your stone, look at the
[1:04:23] stone,
[1:04:25] take the darkness off of the glory of
[1:04:28] Israel and open the
[1:04:31] tomb. And so,
[1:04:36] uh, you would see the glory of God. And
[1:04:39] they took away the stone where the dead
[1:04:42] was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes
[1:04:44] and said, "Father, I thank thee that
[1:04:46] thou hast heard me and knew that thou
[1:04:48] hearest me always, but because of the
[1:04:50] people which stand by. I said it that
[1:04:53] they may believe that thou hast sent
[1:04:56] me." So he's saying this prayer not
[1:04:58] because he needs to pray but so they'll
[1:05:02] hear that he has communion or
[1:05:05] communications with the father with the
[1:05:08] I am that has brought him there for the
[1:05:11] purpose to bring forth the glory of
[1:05:17] Israel to restore the oak tree
[1:05:21] experience to restore the power that
[1:05:24] holds up the household.
[1:05:32] And when he had thus spoken, he cried
[1:05:34] with a loud voice, Lazarus, come
[1:05:39] forth. Oh, thou glory of
[1:05:43] Israel. The power of God, the strength,
[1:05:47] the the the lentil, the every all of
[1:05:50] those things. He's saying it, bring that
[1:05:53] forth.
[1:05:56] Lazarus, come forth. Let the glory of
[1:06:00] Israel be manifested again to this
[1:06:08] people. And he that was dead came forth
[1:06:11] bound hand and foot with grave clothes,
[1:06:13] and his face was bound about with a
[1:06:15] napkin. And Jesus saith unto them, he
[1:06:19] then never touches the guy, right? He
[1:06:22] tells them, he tells us, you loose him,
[1:06:26] right? You roll back that. You get that
[1:06:30] revelation in place to where you can see
[1:06:32] the glory of Israel and then you loose
[1:06:35] it to the
[1:06:37] world. Said, "Loose him. Let him
[1:06:41] go." And they go and they take away the
[1:06:47] death from the glory of Israel, from the
[1:06:51] power, the strong and mighty, the
[1:06:54] strength, the strong
[1:06:57] body, from the oak tree
[1:07:01] experience. They remove the death so
[1:07:04] that that glory can come forth and live
[1:07:07] again before them.
[1:07:10] Loose him, friends, and let him go.
[1:07:13] Amen. Loose him. Let him go. Move your
[1:07:18] revelation so you can see into the tomb
[1:07:21] so you can see that which was dead and
[1:07:24] let it come forth and live again. And he
[1:07:27] said, "If thou can't believe, all things
[1:07:32] are
[1:07:34] possible." and he that was dead and
[1:07:36] okay, he said, "Loose him and let him
[1:07:39] go." Then many of the Jews which came to
[1:07:42] Mary and had seen the things which Jesus
[1:07:44] did, they believed on him. When they saw
[1:07:49] the glory of Israel come forth, they
[1:07:51] were witnessing the glory of Israel in
[1:07:56] Jesus Christ
[1:07:58] manifesting that oak tree, manifesting
[1:08:01] the power, manifesting the strength, the
[1:08:04] ram, the
[1:08:05] chief, the highest
[1:08:08] authority. They witnessed it not
[1:08:11] just because Lazarus came forth, but
[1:08:14] because the power of God had brought him
[1:08:17] forth. That goes all the way back to a
[1:08:19] prophecy. Thy brother shall rise
[1:08:23] again. Do you love him tonight?
[1:08:27] I love him. Let's just sing that as a
[1:08:29] sister comes. Where have you laid
[1:08:34] him? Loose him and let him
[1:08:39] free. Praise the Lord. Do you know that
[1:08:42] consume me? I know you do. I've heard
[1:08:45] you play it before.
[1:08:47] Loose him and let him free. Let him go
[1:08:53] free. Let the glory of Israel come
[1:08:58] forth. Gracious heavenly
[1:09:02] father, I love you
[1:09:05] tonight. Perhaps simple message to some
[1:09:08] and yet to me it's powerful
[1:09:11] Lord because you question us Lord as we
[1:09:15] stand like those Jews and those other
[1:09:17] people have to look at the purpose of
[1:09:20] God and the purpose of being here
[1:09:22] tonight is to
[1:09:24] loose the power of
[1:09:27] God. Let our revelation go and see
[1:09:31] Lazarus rise in our lives.
[1:09:35] rise in this
[1:09:36] church. Rise in the hearts of people.
[1:09:42] Rise that we can tear back the the death
[1:09:46] that surrounds it and let that
[1:09:48] revelation of God live in us as we
[1:09:52] experience our oak tree, our
[1:09:56] MelzDC in this day, and this
[1:09:59] age. Father, I love you. I thank you and
[1:10:02] I praise you above all things. May all
[1:10:05] that's be said and done tonight, if
[1:10:08] there's anything I miss, please just
[1:10:10] blot it from their memories and their
[1:10:11] minds as I give you this service in the
[1:10:14] name of Jesus Christ. And we'd ask you
[1:10:16] to consume the sacrifice as you did in
[1:10:19] the days of Samson and many other times
[1:10:22] in the scripture.
[1:10:25] And we would sing this
[1:10:26] song for your glory and honor in the
[1:10:30] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:32] [Music]

[1:12:14] Lord,
[1:12:15] by
[1:12:17] you. Just one more time.
[1:12:21] Oh,
[1:12:23] consume me, Lord. You're asking God for
[1:12:28] you to be on the sacrificial
[1:12:31] altar. You're asking God to come down
[1:12:34] and reveal again the glory of God, the
[1:12:39] chief one, in your life, in my
[1:12:42] life. Sing it with all your hearts.

[1:14:00] used
[1:14:02] Lord
[1:14:04] by you.
[1:14:07] Gracious heavenly father, you've heard
[1:14:09] their
[1:14:10] [Music]
[1:14:12] hearts. Consume the sacrifice, Lord, and
[1:14:15] let Lazarus come forth in every heart
[1:14:18] and life to show the resurrection
[1:14:22] power to show the power of God again
[1:14:27] living in this entity we call the bride
[1:14:30] of Jesus
[1:14:32] Christ. I love you. I do love you. I
[1:14:35] thank you for this service. I I really
[1:14:38] enjoyed it myself. I I got to be honest.
[1:14:41] Some people call it a burden. Oh Lord,
[1:14:44] you're never a
[1:14:46] burden. You're never a burden to me. I
[1:14:49] thank you and I praise you. So God, we
[1:14:52] give you this service for the honor and
[1:14:53] glory of God. As we came in the name of
[1:14:55] Jesus Christ, so we go in the name of
[1:14:59] Jesus Christ. And as the the brother
[1:15:02] comes to close, as it was, give the
[1:15:04] glory to Jesus. And
[1:15:08] we will, this might be too high for
[1:15:12] me. Can you drop that down a couple?
[1:15:15] We'll give the glory to
[1:15:20] Jesus. That might be too low. Tell of
[1:15:24] his love. His

[1:16:56] through
[1:16:58] this. Uh, I only have the chorus. I'll
[1:17:01] just sing that.
[1:17:04] He's
[1:17:06] alive and well, living in me to
[1:17:13] tell the
[1:17:15] world that he is the
[1:17:21] same. He's the same
[1:17:26] yesterday,
[1:17:28] today, and forever.

[1:17:38] well. Oh, he's

[1:18:14] [Music]
[1:18:18] Amen. As we get ready to dismiss number
[1:18:21] 223.
[1:18:24] So thought of the song and be a good one
[1:18:27] to dismiss
[1:18:30] on. At night I
[1:18:33] lay in bed and
[1:18:37] I
[1:18:38] begin to cry.
[1:18:42] [Music]
[1:18:45] And my mind just fails to
[1:18:50] know
[1:18:53] exactly
[1:18:57] why. Oh, I can't
[1:19:01] explain with tongue or
[1:19:04] pen the spirits
[1:19:07] groaning deep
[1:19:11] within. It must be
[1:19:14] God here in my soul. Cuz I feel the
[1:19:23] poor. Oh, I feel the
[1:19:30] poor. I hear the call.
[1:19:39] And I know his
[1:19:41] spirit's
