us in this hour to stand Lord with boldness we come before your throne of mercy and your throne of grace we bring these partitions before you Lord Jesus you knew him before the foundation of the world

[Music] that was oh I love hi love [Music] Oh [Music] I love the that was hallelujah what a beautiful atmosphere thank you Lord Jesus we just bless the name of the Lord tonight amen well I just want to greet each and every one that's still at home just pray that the Lord just his presence be as real in your home as he is here tonight and we're just so thankful for God's grace amen for those not well our brother Grady sister Zahra they're taking care of him to remember them we have others that just keep kind of reaching out and you know want to remember the Dettwiler family and brother Bob sister Joanne brother Joshua those that are still at home amen sometimes we we miss some of them so each and every one you know it's it's because I spent years every winter out on the road gone away from the family I always just have a special spot for a brother vasily brother Sergei and just the life that it is out there and we want to just remember a brother Sergei somewhere out on the road between here in Texas or Texas and somewhere Lord just be with them amen good to be a son or daughter of God tonight isn't it amen you know tonight gonna speak some straight things but I I trust before we're finished that you'll have just a real joy in your heart amen that will just recognize what God's doing he said I just looking at this in question and answers I forget exactly what year that was do you remember sister Jerry I she started reading it and I started stealing it from her and reading it and someone posed a question there about you know if you were a son or daughter of God and and you'd kind of have drifted away would God let you just go and brother branham comes and says you know now if you're a real son or daughter of God he will bring you back amen and and you know I don't plan on drifting away right but it's an assurance something they stir in your heart that that God's not like our society of today that by something and just in a little short time throws it away I was talking to a man today he works for one of the equipment dealerships and and he made some comments to me and and he as a young man attempted to make a living farming and and it just wasn't working they were going broke and it was interesting to me he said and I had to come three years ago to a point I made decisions and he said I decided my wife was worth keeping and my family was worth keeping and my life was worth keeping and I let the farm go and I thought I spoke openly I spoke very blunt to him I said that encourages my heart that you would express that you had a wife and a family that was more important than these other things now think about who we are in Jesus Christ God said I would let this whole world be burnt over I would do whatever it takes I would go offer myself because you're my family you're my wife and you're worth keeping oh my heart just rejoiced as I was thinking about that thank you lord I'm worth keeping hallelujah hallelujah let's just stand this evening as we go into the thought tonight just you know this has just been on my heart lately Saints this preparation of the inner man you see we can do all kinds of things I've just seen a little advertisement for a little donut thing that you put in your mouth and you bite down on it and it tones the muscles and supposedly pulls your face up and makes you look much younger I think I'm gonna get one but anyway but I thought look mankind does they do so many things for the outer man my you drive down the street there's these monster buildings are these fitness centers and everybody's going in there to run and lift weights and to sweat and to do this to make the outer man oh but hallelujah God's anointed a bride in this last hour and he said she's not going to be concerned now I'm not saying we ignore the outer man just like mad doesn't matter but what God anointed us was to focus and say you know taking care of the outer man is okay but it's the inner man that I want ready for that day that time and Lord just anoint me with a spirit to be prepared in the inner man hallelujah you know you could you could in this life you might say physically a wreck but if the soul was fine-tuned in the presence of Almighty God then hey look you got to go back to that youth you got to go back to all of that and I say Lord let us focus on the inner man amen now this has been something that was kind of something bittersweet tonight my brother and sisters to study this and there's so much more to it I had to kind of condense it down you know but as I was studying this and what brother Branham says and looking at this and it struck me Oh God help me forgive me Lord because you see Saints if the flesh or carnal man is controlling the spiritual man our flesh is not dead come on now I'm not expecting you know just to Rara but look that's deeper than we think well I just don't feel like reading my Bible I just don't feel like praying I just don't feel like going to church and we could go much deeper with that I don't like what the what the preacher is preaching I just listened for just a few short minutes oh brother Jason Watkins preaching this evening of course he's preaching to him to a video camera to a microphone with just a few there at the church but he was preaching it says isn't that interesting God's plan you see we want the preacher to make us feel good we want to go to church and leave feeling good but God wants you to go to church and leave a better person amen so it's not us hearing what makes us happy but it's hearing what we need Oh God give us men that got a heart for the Bride of Christ that will preach the word and anointed by the Holy Ghost to what we need not what we want to hear because if it's what we want to hear look my brother and sister the compromises at first a very shallow slippery slope but it becomes much steeper later on because we talk about we're all making the rapture you're not doing what you should you're doing this you're doing that you're lying you're cheating you're stealing you're drinking you're smoking you know you're fornicating you're there bad bad but you are all gonna make the rapture you said I'm saying and everybody's like yeah right I forget that I'm doing these things because I'm gonna make the rapture how about someone loves us enough to preach the word that says you know what get your act together because every seed will bring forth of its own kind and we don't want that kind of seed following us amen oh let us sow the seeds of righteousness and holiness sow the seeds of anointing of the Holy Ghost hallelujah Romans 8 and 1 verses 1 through 10 amen so we look at this evening just a little foundation there is therefore now no condemnation can someone say Amen to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so we could take verse 1 and we could counter produce that there is now condemnation to those who are not in Jesus Christ amen who walk after the flesh and not after the spirit right so every one of these scriptures my brother and sister unspoken has its counterpart amen for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free thank you from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh he didn't send him sinful flesh but in the likeness amen sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the Spirit for to be carnally minded is normal hmm but unfortunately in loud Asiya it is becoming the normal look I believe it was 1959 I was reading brother Branham said and they'll be their anointed by that saying Christians and I can drink and it doesn't bother me I can smoke and it doesn't bother me and I can dance and it doesn't bother me my brother and sister now whined the years down here and here we are 2020 and what is the mantra of the modern church I am saved I can do all these things it doesn't bother me hmm well hallelujah well if we're in this spirit if we're in Christ the Holy Ghost is going to bother you Alleluia well thank you lord we walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after the flesh do mind the things those last but they they're after the spirit the things of the Spirit for to be carnally minded is death not normal not accepted it's simply death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God rather neither indeed can so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh I say amen to that but in the spirit if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you let Miriam ffice eyes that if Christ be in you we testify tonight he's in us hallelujah the body is dead because of sin but the Spirit is life because of righteousness Heavenly Father we are thankful for the opportunity to come tonight and Lord as I have shared with the church Lord not to point to ourselves but just to make the point Lord come show us our shortcomings father don't let us blindly walk forward Lord with something in our life whether it be a spirit upon us a false doctrine a misunderstanding of bitterness Lord don't let us go forward father come through the word come through your moving of your spirit father correct us and give us a heart that is soft and tender Lord not a heart that's brutish and a bully but Lord Oh spirit that is tender before you one that would quickly say forgive me and would be quick to forgive those around them Lord I pray father for your hand of mercy guide each one Lord I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated so as I chose here out of Romans the eighth chapter because we want to set in place the importance of being after the spirit or in the spirit you see many people and I don't want to go you might say as it would be to the negative side tonight but many people have come to a place and we'll touch on it just a little bit later also but they've come to a place that they believe as long as they mentally and intellectually can accept or be able to say amen to that you know you need to be baptized acts 2:38 I say amen to that so therefore I'm a believer now my brother and sister the thing is is wherever the presence of God is brother branham makes this statement you'd be aware of it brother branham said that wherever the presence of God is the supernatural is present and so we are in a position here now because the word has been opened in our generation that we are now accountable people might say well you know I didn't understand that I didn't see that I didn't my brother and sister this is why the prophet of God made emphasis that we should pray for revelation first and foremost he says we should be putting that right up at the top of our list to pray for revelation but yet we live in a time around the message that many people are saying we don't need anymore revelation we've got enough to make it in the rapture well my brother and sister when we have all we need to go in the rapture we will go amen so we don't want to sit here thinking we've got it made in the shade we're just waiting for the ship to come to the dock and we're out of here my brother and sister the word clearly shows us that when that last seed is in we are gone amen so there someone might even be me okay we're not throwing it off on someone else we ought to all say it might be me Amen we might be the one hindering the rapture we're all looking for the lost seed out there but some of that seeds got to come to maturity and so lord help us I certainly wouldn't want to be the one that would hold up the rapture but I don't want the rapture to go without me amen so lord I need your grace I need your mercy Lord get me ready help me get ready hey men because I believe amen when I'm preaching tonight I believe with all of my heart amen sometimes people would be like well you know the scripture says that they would be those that would come in at the end time they would be preachers they would be that evangelists they'd be that teacher that would be there to deceive the very elect well I believe the word I believe that's possibility amen no matter where you go and that we as the Bride of Christ should be aware of that and that's why the prophet of God told us you take it back to the word now my brother and sister just because we got a vindicated message amen a vindicated prophet on the scene brother Brown never said and tell your when you're convinced then I'm vindicated I'm that messenger after that you don't have to worry about taking him back to the word no my brother and sister he said you take it back to the word because the word is you a nice anchor amen that's our absolute where we can go to it and I actually cut the quote out because I'm sure I'll be too long tonight I don't profess that to claim it but I just started cutting some things out and one of those this brother branham talking about circumstance I won't go into a whole thing but he says now I would say this and I would say that but he said now I can be wrong but the word is never wrong remember my brother and sister when it come down to seven hundred and seven thousand and people then wrote questions to brother branham brother branham is the Bible wrong brother Brown's response is the Bible is never wrong amen so my brother and sister we can do this now I don't know if I left a little question I want to just clarify this on Sunday I was talking about how at the beginning there of the sermon marriage and divorce now I wasn't talking about a man I was talking about ministers men who have been married and divorced and believed they still have rights to the pulpit now right in the very early portions of marriage and divorce brother Branham says if there is a spiritual question or I mean sorry sorry-sorry back up if there is a scriptural question there is a scriptural answer now he doesn't say go check out my certain sermon for the answer but he says it's a scriptural answer and we're looking my brother and sister in the day that people by interpretation of the message are coming up with a different conclusion than this word of God amen so you know what some people don't like that don't think we're progressive enough don't think we're in tune enough with the revelation of the message I think I'll just stick with the prophets side of it when he said if it's a scriptural question it'll have a scriptural answer and if I can't find their answer in the Bible I won't accept their answer and so it just makes it actually quite simple for the believer because he can then just simply say well brother so-and-so I'll just use myself brother Paul preached this is that in line with the Bible now my brother and sister no matter how many quotes I might give you or how many ideologies I might give you or brother so-and-so said if it doesn't line up with this you have every right to say I refuse that amen but if it does line up is we'll touch on that in just a little bit I'm getting ahead of myself amen but if there comes a time in a place Amen where every bit of rubber if you have can pardon the expression every bit of rubber has to hit the road if you're gonna go anywhere at all Amen you can't just have one side of the tire setting there and say well we're gonna take a trip you gotta make a move Amen all the rubbers got to hit the road and once again I just say this not in any animal you know animosities or anything but my brother and sister it's come a time for people to quit saying say only what the Prophet said that's the byline cuz usually they have the quote to produce to you of what the Prophet said but let's say all all a double-l all the prophets said man with all that the prophet said we have balance amen which brother George sends greetings to you amen whenever I think of balance I think of the fact that he's like brother Paul your pulpit it's not balanced but it was just given to us it wasn't of my creation so amen now look I want to go right in here and carry this thought right over into revelations 1 and 9 is where we'll start I John who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the isle that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day you see pop wasn't there I mean John wasn't there just currently like I don't know why God sent me here John knew there was purpose in his life and he knew that the only way that John could live was with the Spirit of God alive in him and so there he is a on that particular day now my brother and sister we know that John because this is a law did not give any exemption whatever struggle you had Enoch had Amen whatever things face Enoch faced a man whatever you faced John faced amen so God's not going to give a pass or an exemption to any generation amen everyone faces the challenge of the day now obviously they didn't have to worry about internet to Netflix and a lot of things like that my brother and sister they didn't have a lot of the nonsense in the same way but remember those spirits were still there amen so he said I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day oh that makes me excited especially studying this and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega now my brother and sister this could not be an angel this could not just be a Messenger of God because they could not take the position to say I am Alpha and Omega this was none other than our Lord Jesus Christ himself hallelujah the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus Smyrna and unto Pergamos and unto Thyatira and unto Sardis and unto Philadelphia and unto Laodicea and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks now we'll touch on that in just a little while and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man oh look at this John had revelation my brother and sister he wasn't just saying hey there was some guy standing there it was likened unto the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle so we look at this and realize that John anointed by the spirit entered into that spirit my brother and sister the prophet of God showed us so clearly how that the Holy Ghost is a gentleman and he comes where he is invited and he is also timid as it were like a dove and if the atmosphere is not correct he will go up as it were to the limb and wait till the atmosphere is correct but the key we must remember tonight is he goes where he is invited oh lord I asked you come here Lord tonight not only just come here tonight go home with us amen be with us in the morning noon the night Lord because that's the only way we can be satisfied my brother and sister a world crying out for peace reading articles about how this is a troubled age they're talking about the the the whole narcotic addiction the whole thing it's a worse pandemic than this virus will ever be my brother and sister but they still won't stop it's enough that they can't stop they won't stop the flow of drugs come on we can knock whole nations down to the beat them right down to the ground but we can't stop oh my brother and sister know this nation the prophet of God said 1956 What did he say about America they rejected God now when something starts to rot my brother and sister it doesn't rot from the outside in it rots from the inside out now how rotten is this nation that it's now reached the surface it's pretty rotten hallelujah so you see what's happening is is we're looking at a time now that all of these things are coming into fruition and what is happening is Satan is doing his very best to keep you and I out of the Spirit of God amen we get burdened with work with health with family all of these things that burden us that come down and weigh upon us that comes to the place now if I'm not preaching to you tonight don't reject it just say Amen because it'll this be the truth it doesn't have to apply to you but brother and sister we can get so out of the spirit that we cannot even sometimes pray that God would come on the scene to deliver us we simply become complete we paralyze all my child's lost what am I going to do we cry day and night we cry day and night we serve the prince of feasts amen he is in our present he is the one in control we need to stop and say Lord I've got to get out of this old carnal thinking I gotta get into your spirit which is a spirit of peace now peace does not mean lackadaisical peace does not mean that we become lazy well God will take care of it we have our part to play but we need to have the confidence that God is in control and we can trust him amen so if Satan is trying to get you out of the spirit and into the flesh to where you worry here and you be there my brother and sister rebuked that in the name of Jesus Christ take that very need that you have if you have a child not serving God I have a child not serving God if you have family as it were sons and laws daughters and laws grandchildren whatever it might be my brother and sister it can weigh very heavy upon it and you can just fret and fast but if you notice it doesn't change Amen but when you get a piece about it and you say Lord I held that baby in my hands and I handed him to the preacher or maybe he was the preacher and you just committed that child to the Lord you saw them under a commitment get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you saw them labor and you saw them slip away and we're not happy about the slipping away but my brother and sister I would rather with confidence claim them in Jesus Christ then be the sourpuss that is always crying my children are lost my children are lost how about we testify my children are coming back amen my health is coming back amen the Liberty I had in Jesus Christ is coming back and as we make those steps you will find as you enter into the Spirit of God you enter into his presence you find a Liberty like you never had before you find a Liberty that the wheels fall off the car and you're able to say lord thank you I'm fixing to see a supernatural event the wheels will either be put back on the car or there's a better car coming amen now that's just a carnal example but my brother and sisters see we can't have it two ways we cannot be out here sighing and crying although is me and be in the spirit of the Lord hallelujah now we are called to take one position or the other amen we have no ability now I say this if you'd understand from a farmer's point of view my dad used to the struggles that started in the original message Church here in the valley my dad you know as things were starting to heat up people taken sides one side thinking no big deal for the pastor to have a racehorse and go traveling with young ladies to this place in that place and and some people just didn't have any problem they make statements like well I have confidence in my pastor well my brother and sister I trust people too you trust people we just don't trust the devil amen and so you know the thing is the scripture told us to flee from the very appearance amen so it is a matter where there anything went right or wrong it didn't look good amen boy if we would just judge things a lot of people would just judge things by that and that alone they wouldn't have to worry about details they just say this ain't looking good they'd run from it hallelujah oh my I better get going along here else we'll be here all night and already just really squashed that on Sunday didn't I amen now look here my brother and sister in the church ages the patmans vision brother Branham says here in Revelations 110 I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet I was in the spirit isn't that just beautiful my I love that you could just call those words the whole of the Christian life hallelujah amen that stirred my heart to think of it it's the whole a man I'm in the spirit not just a spirit but the spirit of the king Amen hallelujah if we are going to live as Christians we have to be in his spirit now my brother and sister I said I was gonna make some direct statements tonight so don't take them too radically serious unless they apply and then take them very radically serious but if we're living life day by day week after week month by month year by year and we're not in his spirit are we Christians don't say that is condemnation but it's an evidence right we all go through droughts don't we my brother Chris sings that song down in the valley amen well you know what the deserts usually down in the valley and when you're down in the desert my brother and sister life is tough and you don't feel in the spirit but somewhere along the line God's going to bring you back up out of that valley or that desert and bring you into a mountaintop and there you're going to look back and realize just as the song says that something was formed something was secured in you down in the valley that's where you have the decision to make I will serve Him or I will quit oh my brother and sister when it's all easy everybody's a Christian hallelujah now I grew up with this drilled in my head my daddy used to say it all the time he'd say son if farming was easy everyone would do it so you know that would apply to a lot of things right I want to apply it tonight to being Christians if being a real Christian was easy everyone would do it hallelujah we have to be in his spirit John was not talking about being in his own spirit now my brother and sister the prophet of God talked about sometimes you know that people talk about being in the spirit having the Holy Spirit brother branham even refers to it but really what they're doing is just sharing their spirit we don't want to share our spirit my brother and sister that would be a wreck that would be a real wreck that would have not brought this these visions had to be the Spirit of God it has to be the Spirit of God with us - or all our efforts are in vain Paul said I will pray in the spirit I will sing in the spirit I will live in the spirit amen if there is anything good that will come to me has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word hallelujah there we are here's the prophet of God once again taking us back to the word Amen there's the confirmation Amen and may manifest by the results it bears my brother and sister here's the thing we cannot no matter how we we dress it up it doesn't matter you put a tutu on it it doesn't matter if you put perfume on it a pig is a pig it will bring forth the fruit or manifestation of a pig amen now that's a little bit blunt speaking but my brother and sister the problem we've got around the message is we have people that are closeted this and closeted that and this and that and whatever and then stand up and say we are the message my brother and sister that's why sometimes I've I've been criticized for saying this so I'll probably get criticized again but at some times it just really bothers me to use the term message because you can look from A to Z and almost everything is I believe this message but what is it producing I hold this message as it were to a very high standard in fact as brother Tim prayed Lord we're not worthy but we're worthy Lord what a paradox I'm not worthy but I'm worthy amen because my brother and sister hold this message to a high standard we don't want to lower this message down where it's just common to be trampled on a man as the scripture said throwing the Pearl before the swine my brother and sister I sometimes wonder if the hog isn't in church I probably didn't need to have said that did I as surely as John needed to be in the spirit to receive these tremendous revelations fresh from Jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelation that God had given to us to live by in his word for it is the same spirit look at this look at it this way all too many read the Bible where it says in acts 2:38 repent you know let me back up I I got a note about this later in my thought but I just wanted to to put this now brother Branham talks about in other places in the message I didn't bring him out tonight because I didn't want to draw it out but brother Brown says we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that God has given to us to live by in his word now brother branham's talking about how to see and he is explaining that the word to see the kingdom of God is not as it were with our eyes to see the kingdom of God but it is to understand now my brother and sister to understand God my brother God's ways are so much higher than our ways amen there's no way that we as humans are going to understand God this is why I always find it interesting when you hear these people interpreting the Bible and they're saying well this means God meant this my brother and sister they don't have a clue what God meant unless they have revelation that fits from Genesis to Revelation unless it has continuity all the way through the Word of God they are taking an intellectual approach by some interpretation of a language of a region of a certain age and saying that's what it meant but brother Branham comes along and says now this isn't to see with your eyes this is to see or understand like an individual would say I just don't see it I just don't understand it so we come to the place to understand how important understanding is or seeing that takes a revelation from Almighty God amen you can't just intellectually pick it up and say I see it my brother and sister God's got to reveal it to a real son or daughter of God amen hallelujah well all too many read the Bible where it says in acts 2:38 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and just pass right on they don't see it if they saw it now I hope this this struck me deep I hope it strikes you deep too if they saw it by getting in the spirit they would know that if they want to receive the Holy Spirit they need to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and God would be duty-bound to fulfill his word by filling them with the Holy Ghost but if we just read the scripture as is we'd share hey read acts 2:38 somebody with no anointing reads that well I don't see any different I've been told this so many times I don't see any difference between that and Matthew 28:19 you know it's baptism we did we just have to be baptizing and they just had two different little methods that they did it you know kind of like the difference between you know the Methodists and the Episcopalians and and the Lutheran's and the Catholics and and so we don't see no big deal see they're not in the spirit they're not catching anything that the word is conveying but thank you lord can we say thank you Lord when we saw that we knew there was something much deeper there wasn't just some scripture to be fulfilled okay if I go do this but the key that unlocked acts 2:38 my brother and sister was the revelation that in death now take this back to the water when the angel was on the water there was power in the water amen and when the angel left the water was just water and every true son and daughter of God with a revelation of who they are in Jesus Christ when they went down in the water I can assure you there was an angel of Almighty God on the water where they were baptized at that time right there if they did it mechanically with no more knowledge as a young child maybe just stirred in their heart without an understanding you would say well would there be will they really do that my brother and sister in the innocence of a child being moved by the Spirit of God to fulfill that scripture I can assure you an angel of God come down and visited that water when that child was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now child will have to go on catch a full revelation of who they are and when they catch that but you understand God obligates himself as a prophet of God said here and he's not going to withhold that from a child who in sincerity and innocence went down in baptism without a full understanding amen otherwise some people now forgive me for putting it this way but some people their baptism would be null and void until they were 50 or 60 years old and after 30 or 40 years and the message caught a revelation but you see God knew and God visit him there at that time and said now it might take a season for this to be fulfilled but I will fulfill it and they were a candidate and they were moved by my spirit to take acts 2:38 in to their soul and say this is the truth hallelujah much different than a completely intellectual approach to it hallelujah but did not get in this spirit when reading did we ask God for His Spirit to teach us the real truth of it I wonder sometimes my brother and sister if we really truly honestly are approaching the things of the word of God the message correctly how often now I don't know so I have to just put this out this way you receive reject say okay I don't fit that but it's the truth however you want to do it but my brother's sister I wonder how many of us actually stop and say Lord reveal this to me not some big broad cross section of like Lord reveal the message to me but how about stopping on even our particular Scripture and say Lord I need you I know there's more here Lord I need you to reveal this now my brother and sister you can't sit there as some cold formal powerless Christian say Lord reveal to me that will not apply you've got to get in the spirit and in sincerity ask God for the word to be opened up oh but when the word is opened up our life will never be the same hallelujah Amen we can't just stop and say oh praise the Lord I got a new revelation here Jack doesn't work that way I'll tell you what it does it checks down through the heart and says heart is everything all right hearts said everything in order hearts stand up for the word hearts amen to the word heart produce the word oh that's when you can start checking things off hallelujah oh my did was God for His Spirit to teach us the real truth of it if we did mmm we don't call the elders we call the elders to confess our sins be annoying didn't prayed for and that would be that it might not come immediately but in his spirit is all over there's no other Court of Appeal God will fulfill his word oh we need to get in the spirit grace burn Akal amen we need to get in the spirit and then things will be done see we can't be a cold formal power church and say well we believe the message we know God sent a prophet I believe God called me okay everything else will just kind of work its way out look I want to see things get done amen I want to see some of our our our loved ones and some of around us that are struggling and have issues and and things I want to see them delivered amen so what we got to do is come to the place we get in the spirit and then see things don't go through the acts first get in the spirit then go through the acts and watch what God will do hallelujah and it's not set back and wonder if and when and where and how God's going to work in our church let's get in this spirit he'll do the work we need to get in the spirit hallelujah now look how God works now we understand that the Bible teaches us that a man cannot even understand the Word of God without the Holy Ghost so we have thousands or tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of people who are interpreting to themselves or to others the scripture and without the Holy Ghost it has to then fall back automatically my brother and sister falls back into an intellectual we're not exempt around the message from this kind of things this is where mid of the false doctrines come in is because men without the Holy Ghost maybe they're anointed speakers they must be gifted men to speak if they hadn't been a preacher they might have been a politician or a corporate leader or of a civic leader but my brother and sister that doesn't account for getting into the spirit and getting into the mind of God to be able to speak so without the Holy Ghost we don't even have any right to interpret or get into the Word of God because without it we cannot now here it is my brother and sisters we look at this uh-oh got ahead of myself we're good though first Corinthians 2:14 brings up a good point but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God it didn't say might not right he said he received not period that's just blunt plain out didn't get it natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him now man night might not declare it is foolishness but if you want to know whether one believes it's foolish or real it's very simple test you know how we apply that test or how that a test is applied not us applying it but whether they do it or not in the story of the Titanic many people drowned because when they said you probably should put your life jackets on many of them said this ship is unsinkable so the announcement put on your life jackets was foolishness to them now the Holy Ghost said that Lord would come as a thief in the night we judge that whether that's true or foolish by our preparation to that coming event lord help us help us Lord get us in the spirit to realize when you warned this when the prophet of God said we are so close to the coming of the Lord and people are like it's been 50 years well my brother and sister foolishness will tell you we have plenty of time if we are anointed and in the spirit I think what we ought to do so I think we ought to put our lifejackets on right now and if the ship doesn't sink I'll just take my lifejacket off later are you with me I think what we ought to do is get ready for a rapture right now and if it doesn't take place and maybe they would be those in here that would be young you know brother Ivan brother Chris but there Jay is not so young but anyway sorry about that buddy maybe they'll be burying us I say this in sincerity they may be burying us saying last rites and and prayers said in song sung but I would rather go every day Lord I'm ready Lord I'm ready Lord I'm examining my life from top to bottom inside and out I'm going back to your word and I'm asking you Father show me anything that won't go through the filter and if I die of old age praise the Lord well amen neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned so men must get in the Spirit of God for these things of God to even make tents may Amen now look I just want to bring this about so God was bringing John into a position you see the book of Revelation had to be written God had a plan a format by which he was bringing it out as it would be to come to speak as they often term the book of revelations a book of apocalypse to bring about the whole picture of what was taking place and the culmination of time and how that those wicked the tear would be brought together and the tear would come now my brother and sister when it comes into one-world government when it comes to all of these kind of things there will be a forcing but you have to understand the prophet of God shows us very clearly in the word and that the mark of the beast takes place long before the force of the tribulation hits mankind amen before they have realized that they are now bound into the system they will have already rejected the Son of God amen they will offer already rejected the word for their day and then when they feel the crush they will cry out but just as it is in some countries where they have had a transformation from serving God to to becoming almost heathen nations what will happen is is they will not many of them will not be crying out for mercy from God but they will actually be cursing God they will curse God for the very existence that they are caught in not realizing the reason they are where they're at is they rejected God back up the road somewhere else they'll view it as some failure they will blame it upon the churches that will blame it upon ministries they will blame it on all kinds of things but my brother and sister there'll be no pastor now look I know this is going to be a bold strong statement no matter what a pastor has done to humanity my brother and sister no pastor will send a single soul to hell because we within you and I between humanity sons and daughters of God we have within us the ability to lay everything on the altar committed to God ask God for strength ask God for guidance and I'm gonna say some blunt things right here my brother and sister I was preaching in a church one time and I use this very example and I was talking about how that there are certain things we go through in life certain things that we will we will experience and we won't like those things those things are hard they're crushing things but you see my brother and sister I use example about how that there will be no excuses on the on that day the white throne of judgment no excuse no one will come before God and say well this was my circumstance of what happened in my life and because of that I wasn't able to serve God I use the example of somebody being molested and a sister in the church young woman just starts sobbing my brother and sister is hard it breaks your heart you don't know what all the circumstances are but I'll tell you what it is it won't matter whether it's from a drug active a drug addict or a prostitute someone molested someone whatever it might be God will bring someone from that and deliver them fill them with the Holy Ghost put the Spirit of God within them make them an overcomer because there'll be no excuse on that day hallelujah and you say but brother Paul that's just said that's pretty blunt no I'm making the point my brother and sister we have no excuse we have the presence of God the Spirit of God is here in our midst all we got to do is let go and let God have his way amen but as long as the flesh is still alive it will keep us from getting into the Spirit of God Lord let our flesh die tonight hey man let us die to our cell and let Christ live amen hallelujah because we are beyond that we are called beyond that the word has provided a way beyond that for us hallelujah people are bitter all this thing happened to me all these years ago this certain thing happened to me I'm bitter my brother and sister you let go of that you get in the Spirit of God you commit that to the Lord you pray for the person that hurts you because God's lifted you above that and filled you with the Holy Ghost empowered you with the Spirit of God that you can rise into the heavenlies we're not an eagle that's been blowed down in the brush we're not an eagle that's decided to roost on a chicken coop pole we are sons and daughters of God called to rise into heavenly places to soar in the heavenlies in the spirit of Almighty God hallelujah we're the power of God can be let go to be put on display but if we got it all bound up we got people my brother and sister I don't say this lightly it makes my heart broken but we got people saying about the seals all know know this and that and whatever but I'll tell you they don't got to worry many of those people don't got to worry about whether the seals are broken because they have bound the Bible up so tight that it's not even living it's not even living and if the Bible's not living you don't need to worry about whether the seals are open or not if this word is not enough to deliver you from your bitterness and your angers and all you've got cooped up held up inside of you if it's not enough to deliver you from that it won't matter whether all of that is finished or not hallelujah sorry for being so blunt but look at it my brother and sister you can't say I'm filled with the spirit but I've still angry at someone from 25 years ago you can't hate your brother and say you love God the scripture says you're a liar oh that sounds blunt but it's a truth if we got that kind of bitterness and that kind of angers and those things bound up and you say that you love God my brother and sister you might as well find a mirror somewhere look in that mirror and say Lord forgive me I'm a liar No hallelujah hallelujah you hear people say well this person did this and this person did that and I can never forgive them well you'll never move any further in your relationship with the Lord so you better find an altar right now and you better get down there and say Lord they hurt me they were unjust they were this they were cruel they were whatever but Lord forgive me and Lord I forgive them because I want to fly in the heavenlies I want to enter into the Spirit of God I don't want to be some earthbound eagle hallelujah walk around with our thumb in our suspenders I'm an eagle praise God well if you're an eagle start flying hallelujah Oh hallelujah huh well Brown says here and here you him look it's come to a place friend that this world is so awful it's going to make you prove every inch of ground you stand on we're not gonna say I hear it so much I've heard it preached and I'm not speaking down on this but it there's no content behind it when they preach us all we're the Bride of Christ we've overcome all things okay I believe that how thin is his ice I won't go there I'll just say if the life in us the atmosphere of our church right on down to our brother deals don't prove it don't claim it Amen it's time for us to get a great big mirror look in it and say Lord forgive me I've been lying I've been lying Lord it's gonna make you prove every inch you stand on Satan's going to do it remember Sunday up I shared that quote brother Brown said the devil he's doing his pushing but God's pushing back hallelujah and my God can push a whole lot harder than the devil can amen amen so you know what but God's gonna let you and I my brother and sister sometimes God just sets back just enough to see if you and I are actually going to invoke the word amen hallelujah you know I remember reading a story once a man a man committed a crime pretty much everybody knew he committed a crime but they couldn't prove he had committed the crime so they used some other little petty crime to get him drawn into court and then the prosecuting attorneys you know digging into this digging into this and they're sitting there and they're waiting for the man all he had to do is invoke the Fifth Amendment or whatever I'm not gonna I'm not going to wonder that what did they determine they used yeah I'm gonna remain silent because I would incriminate myself but what you know what he did the prosecuting attorney brought it in such a way that the man he never uses he you know and he starts and he lets out one detail and he lets out another detail and he lets out another detail and and the man's lawyer is as like stunned so stunned he doesn't even response basically a man just admits right in front the whole court that he did the crime my brother and sister the devil's here to tell you home brother Tim I believe God ordained you to say those words the devil's here to tell you you're not worthy you're not worthy you're not worthy and if we're not careful we start saying it I'm not worthy now I'm not talking to the term that brother Tim was preaching but I mean in that real deep down in the soul I'm not worthy I'm not worthy and you know while we could invoke that and and not incriminate herself but if we just keep doing that but what God wants us to do is stop and say sorry I'm forgiven I'm forgiven I'm sorry you can't find no record there's no record of me ever ever being a sinner ever being caught in the lust of the flesh and the pride of life I've never been a lover of pleasure I've never been Hetty or high-minded Amen because I have been forgiven it's been wiped from the record hallelujah so you're gonna have to prove every inch of ground you stand on that means even when you feel unworthy you have to remind yourself Jesus Christ made me worthy the word said I am worthy and it's coming to a time where impersonations I think you'll like this most of you probably already read the quote I'm so slow we're impersonations and carnal thinking is going to be circumcised from the now remember God always puts that um what would you say the word just slipped my mind he always puts an emphasis right there's always something that quantifier there's the word always puts a quantifier always you go through the scripture there's always a quantifier impersonation I don't think he's going to be circumcised from the real true body of Christ you see what's happening now the prophet of God said three kinds of believers in the church but my brother and sister have you noticed that when the Holy Spirit comes down that two-edged sword starts to swing and how the make believer and the unbeliever always draws back but the real believer stands there it's hard you will quiver you will shake you will cry you might even scream and sob and whatever but you'll be standing there saying cut it away Lord cut it away from me I don't want to go another day Lord cut it away but to make believer and the unbeliever they start to run because they're afraid of that word but we recognize God will not cut one bit deeper than is necessary to get the unbelief and sin out of our life and he's saying right here this impersonation and carnal thinking is going to be circumcised which requires a knife and a cutting away and he's going to have a body that's pure and holy and filled with his spirit walking in his spirit doing the works that he did be faithful to that and if there would be one call we could cry out tonight no be faithful to that Saints don't let anything come in there and disrupt that be faithful and wants something real they're hungry and thirsting to find the real thing they don't want psychologies talking about the real believer this is a real believer oh I'll tell you my brother and sister unless something changed in the message when I hear people say we've got enough of a message oh it scares me to death not only do I feel sorry for them it scares me because what do they think or where do they think they are and that they can get I'm not hungry anymore I'm not thirsty anymore just give me a nibble here and give me a nibble there oh ho no not me I'm a real eagle I've been exercising my wings I've been flying by faith amen I'm hungry over time hallelujah and that applies naturally to hallelujah they're hungry and thirsting to find the real thing they don't want psychology they don't want some intellectual speech they want something that gives them the assurance something that makes this Bible live again hallelu I don't want a Bible as a book that we can read I wanted to live hallelujah Oh hallelujah let me hurry right along here yes I need to hurry right along amen look here in the in the Tok don't just come this far and say I believe the message see we're getting a lot of that and I know people I've been criticized I've been hammered on more than you can imagine in the last year over over me pushing on this but I promise you as long as you allow me to be your pastor God allowed me to be your pastor I'm gonna hammer on this because you see if we don't the message will just slide right off into denominationalism it will slide off very easily but the prophet of God made this statement my brother and sister I'm heard men say well the prophet of God missed it because the message has become a denomination but I thought to myself I didn't say anything it was in a in a public more or less forum area I didn't say anything my brother and sister because I didn't want to cause a ruckus but I'm telling you I felt like saying that's that's your church that's your version of the message that's who you are don't include me don't include grace Tabernacle in the denominational spirit cuz will reject that every single time hallelujah we're looking to be led by God we don't need to get a cue from somebody else on what we need to do we don't need someone to pick the tape for us to listen to we don't need some heavy-handed guidance from someone who thinks they're more spiritual than else we're gonna get in the spirit if we have been immature god help our immaturity if we have been a little negligent god forgive our negligence but we're not going to yield to some man-made leadership hallelujah I believe the message you oh just say what he said that's all you got to do just say what he said the prophet of God said you obeyed the messenger that might include fine in a church with the Holy Ghost filled pastor and being faithful at opposed to duty oh just say what he said we know we don't need the other part well good to those who you might hear this he told you obey the messenger well hallelujah if I sound strident I don't mean it I say it from my heart coming to Christ you say well I believe every words said brother branham that's good but that just being able to read this it almost be rude if these people are like oh I'm a believer oh you read you're not illiterate oh that sounds a little rude doesn't it take the message take it in - hmm he skipped the head right there didn't he right he just skipped right through the intellect the mental comprehension all of that skipped right through it take it into your heart that you must have the token the very life that was in price be in you when I see that I'll pass over you oh look it's not about we know the message we can quote the message let me finish this I know a brother he's a good man but I'm just referencing this to the ability that people have or sitting in his house one night in Tennessee and I was trying to remember a quote I just read and and you know like I've always been this way I got to stop but even at this moment I'm studying out of three different messages and I don't remember which one which quote and which thought came from because I got them all jumbled together because to me they're just one giant pool with beautiful things in it amen but look the brother just so intellectual this brother I do believe has Holy Ghost does have a revelation of the message but so intellectual so smart I said well you know brother branham said Dada and he goes oh that's in Christ the mystery of God revealed paragraph 128 if you say so I know the prophet of God said it and I said at this and he goes oh that souls that are in prison paragraph 256 okay yeah I don't even remember my phone number brother but I know price real and I always in this heart that's one thing I know see so what we got to do get beyond I I believe the message the devil the prophet of God said that devil Billy but the devil cannot get in the spirit of the Lord he had his chance he got lifted up in his pride in his position he had his chance he rejected it he'll never have another chance to get in the Spirit of the Lord so he's constantly now just following along impersonating and persecuting by the word that was meant for his deliverance now the seven churches back to the Patmos vision denominations which are man directed cannot be born of God my brother and sister the minute that they lose the Holy Ghost leadership and lose operating under the Spirit of the Lord it is no longer of God period which means if it goes there it actually brother Branham in another place says it never was in the Lord in the beginning wow that's pretty fun for it is the spirit not a man that gives life how thrilling it is to think of those seven lamps drawing life and light resources of that main bowl because they had their wicks dipped therein now I want you to take this right back to the book of Revelation as we was earlier when John is there now what does John see John turned to see the voice that spoke and being turned I saw the very first thing he doesn't see not that is as the son of man the very first thing he sees is seven golden candlesticks now I want you to keep that in mind as we as we look at this now how thrilling is think those seven lamps a drawing life and light from the resources of that main bowl because they had their wicks dipped there in each church age messenger is depicted here his life is on fire with the Holy Ghost his wick life has been immersed in Christ through that wick he is drawing the very life of Christ and by it gives out light to the church can we say thank you Lord what kind of light is he giving the very same light that was in the first lamp that was and right on down the ages to the present time of the last day messenger the same life and the same light is manifested by a life that is hid with Christ in God not only can we speak most of the messengers but every be Oh hallelujah what a fire Alleluia quantifier but every true believer is from yes it's dramatically not just oh you poor little believer sister carry no you poor little believers dramatically this is it Oh what it is my brother's sister I'll be accused once again a shovin brother branham to the side but people don't understand the law of the first-fruit and whatever the law of the first-fruit would declare as the bounty of the harvest let all of the harvest be the same and the first fruit was our Lord Jesus Christ and the first fruit of our age was brother Branham and we will come exactly like him because our wick is stuck into the same pool of oil and we are drawing the same lies oh not a life that had to pass through a prophet and then come down to us our wick is in the same oil the same reservoir hallelujah then a prophet of God was pulling from Oh are we come under our prophet of our age yes we have we could not circumvent that we could not leave him out of the picture but my brother and sister my wick your wick is stuck in that same oil Oh hallelujah I can get in the Spirit of God if I can just die to my flesh you know the prophet of God said that was a secret dry to this flesh Oh hallelujah oh and I'll tell you what my brother and sister look at this now we go on they're all drawing I'm not making this up I don't want to sound presumptuous or whatever I don't want to sound rude I'm just saying what the Prophet said they're all drawn from the same source they have all you know who that all is don't you and including the messenger of our age and the true believer Alleluia they've all been dipped into the same Bowl they're all dead to themselves and their lives are hid with Christ in God they are sealed in by the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4:13 grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption hallelujah oh man can pluck them I love this I should have I got him on my screen right here a great big highlighted and colored up letters and stuff here cuz look at this now he's talking about you and I no man can pluck them out of his hand nobody nobody this is why I made that statement earlier that no preacher can send you to hell because no one can pluck you out of God's hand hallelujah no matter how they lie in preachers there ever was no matter how many deceivers no matter how many Judas's show up on the scene you won't be turned to the side because you are bought with a price you are his amen you are hid in Christ Oh hallelujah no men can pluck him out of his hands their lives they'll have to get down and determine what the word tampered with means his some people some people you know a time years ago I gave a brother I had hoped he would be a brother I gave him a house to live in I put the whole bill in the furnace I paid the electric bill I did all this stuff just trying to help them to come and get into church and serve God one day I come to a situation I said I'm sorry but life has changed I need the house back and to this day they blame me for not serving God Wow i tampered with him did I know my brother and sister I know this is gonna sound rude and it's gonna be on the video and I don't much care right at the moment what I should have done is take the Word of God way early on in our relationship and I should have just booted him with it and said look God said we're in a hot house plants we're rugged God said through a prophet that the real believer won't be offended by the Word of God and I have hot house you I have tried to protect you I've paid bills for you I've done all of these things for you I've patted you on the back I've done this but you see if it's not in there no amount of pampering Church I probably should say this on a Sunday morning but after our last experience of this last year we're no longer pampering anybody now people think this is rude and it'll probably come in as backlash and I just don't much care next time somebody sits in our church and pulls their car keys out and rattles them at about thirty minutes I'm gonna ask them if they're trying to put them in the offering plate because they're gonna give the car to the church or if they need help to their car because they want to leave but you see we're done pampering we're done pampering people want special attention people need something special I can't go to your church unless I'm special well my brother and sister it isn't my church it's God's church we're not here we're not here to be pampered because the prophet of God dealt with that talked about them hothouse plants oh wow I better change the subject here before we all go home with a frown on her face but you see my brother and sister it comes down to a time in a place that we cannot sacrifice ourselves emotionally mentally in whatever trying to hold up somebody that wants to find fault with everything in the church if all you can see is Fault in the church you're in the wrong church go find a church that you don't find fault in and then just hope or least go back to the Bible make sure they're preaching the truth to you but as I said I just heard brother Jason speaking tonight God sends the preacher to preach what God wants you to hear not what you want to hear amen if I let it be out of the mouth of two or three preachers yeah no man can pluck them out of his hands their lives cannot be tempered with the visible life is burning shining giving light and manifestation of the Holy Ghost the inner invisible life is hidden in God and fed by the Lord's word Satan cannot touch them not even death can touch them for dayit death has lost its sting the grave has lost its victory thanks be unto God they have this victory in and through the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen o Lord let the Holy Ghost come down let us bind this flesh when this flesh says I'm too tired to worship when this flesh says I'm too tired to do this I'm too tired to do that find that flesh in the name of Jesus Christ don't let the flesh man control the spirit man hey man sister Emmy would you come hallelujah amen I smell smoke it might burn a bridge burning but my brother and sister there ain't no turning back Nihao hallelujah ain't no turning back anyhow oh my oh my oh my praise the Lord aren't you glad Amen Satan can't touch him amen but the part the line I want to reiterate there the visible life is burning and shining giving light and manifestations of the Holy Ghost the what was the word visible hallelujah well I'm happy down in my soul don't question me I'm rejoicing just cuz it doesn't show well I'm sorry Saints I'm just gonna gripe and whine and cry and scratch until I somehow get through if it's on the inside it will show up on the outside oh yeah that song doesn't say God working on the inside trying to get on the inside working on the outside trying to get on the inside no on the inside working to the outside hallelujah oh praise the Lord you love the Lord tonight Saints oh my oh my oh my well hallelujah I've got something that the world don't have brother Jason help me out here I sing like a preacher hey man I was joking with brother Ron Peterson went one time I said why is it that the better service you preached the worst you're seeing at the end of it amen amen yeah well I'll tell you what the devil never gave this to you Saints and he can't take it away hallelujah let's just worship the Lord for a couple minutes I've kept you just a few minutes long but I tell you it's just hard that's just hard to stop well praise and I've got something that the world can't give the world can't take it away well I've got something that the world can give and keeps me day by day I've got something worth talking about it makes me sing and it makes me shout I've got something that the world can't give and the world can't take it away well I've got something that the world can't give and the world can't take it away yes I've got something that the world can't give and it keeps me day by day I've got something worth talking about makes me singing it makes me shout I've got something that the world can't give and the world can't take it away Oh hallelujah well at Holy Ghost and fire and it's keeping me alive amen hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah now look I don't mean now I want to clarify something I don't mean no ill no nothing to nobody but my brothers and sisters I'll just admit to you right now that the last year I have been so bound as a minister it might have showed maybe it didn't I don't know but I have been so bound because there has been so much brother Branham didn't mean that that isn't what that says that isn't what he really meant this is this this is that look I'll tell you I got tired I got so close to my brother and sister I'll just be honest with you tonight maybe too honest I came just about the thickness of that page right there - resigning as I reach the points I I can live without this I can live without that spirit causing you to guard everything that you know is the truth but you're trying to find a way that won't cause it conflict well tell you praise the Lord I thank you for your prayers amen but keep praying for me because I'm only about that far from resigning but that's progress I stand corrected sister Kara but I tell you Saints I tell you God never intended for us to come to the house of God to be bound up God never intended for us to throw a whole sermon out because the preacher stumbled over a few words because his mind was going a lot faster than his mouth or his mouth was going a lot faster than his mind you see if we can't come to maturity to come to a place to say okay I see what he was doing I see I see where this brother has been preaching Benton didn't devote in years almost two decades of his life to come to this place and any certain will suddenly just throw us all out and turn us into some weird thing oh my brother and sister you see prophet of God if we had a clue don't feel sorry for me I may have vented just now but don't feel sorry for me but I'd like to do is stop and think about the sacrifice the prophet of God made from church to church across the nations around the world constantly be hammered our church we were taught correctly our church doesn't believe that oh this isn't right you're a Holy Roller you're this you're that constant I was just reading a little article the other day the man writing and he was saying well you know brother Branham was doing great as long as he followed Gordon Lindsay's advice well my brother and sister God didn't send Gordon Lindsay to restore a message to this age amen you see the mind of denomination we've been faithfully taught you must stick with our faithful teaching well how about the liberty of the revealed word amen the third poll coming and giving us an open book hallelujah the book isn't closed and we're hoping we can figure it out the book is open and the Bride of Christ is eating that book as it were one page at a time day by day every single day she's eating the book hallelujah and sometimes the book gives us indigestion it better but I tell you what it does you go to bed I just experienced this the other day I don't know what a but I ate something my stomach this rawrrr off half the night but middle of the night sister Jerry slid a hand over I was I was awake there I probably was making so much noise she couldn't sleep and I knew she's praying for me somewhere along here I kind of spoke of this the other day I drifted off to sleep and even though whatever a yesterday upset my tummy I woke up in the morning I was hungry that's the life of a believer right there Lord forgive me Lord help me Lord I'm guilty but Lord I plead your blood Oh Lord and you wake up in the morning can't help ourselves Oh hallelujah now look I'm not speaking ill of anybody I just want to go to church not even just be the preacher all the time God blessed us with a couple fine ministers in our church and I'm probably going to start relying on a more I'm going to become a lazy pastor but my brother and sister God meant for us to come in the house of God not to find a yoke to be bound into but we've been set free we've been set free and I'll tell you what as long as I'm pastor a sovereign a crow will fight for that Liberty we'll fight for our our position in Jesus price to take the revealed word of the hour apply it to us in every way hallelujah well it's that Holy Ghost and fire and it's keeping me alive it's keeping me alive keeping me alive it's that Holy Ghost and five and it's keeping me alive oh Jesus is keeping feel raided and it's bubbling up inside bubbling up inside whenever bubbling up inside well it's all over beat and it's bubbling up inside Jesus is keeping me alive or its sanctifies be holy and it's keeping me alive keeping me alive yes it's keeping me alive well it sanctifies be holy and it's keeping me alive Jesus is keeping me alive while I prayed it down from heaven and it's keeping me alive keeping me

it's keeping me alive it's that Holy Ghost and far and it's keeping me alive oh Jesus is keeping me alive this is Stan give the Lord a hand clap a praise tonight lord I just ask your father Lord let us move beyond the flesh Lord let us just move into the heavenlies Lord live in your spirit Lord live in your presence I pray now Lord we ask fault let it be visible on the outside Lord what's happening on the inside Lord that the life of Christ would be made evident to the world now father Lord as we look in your word we see over and over Lord you said that you would be with us even in us now Lord I didn't get to that part of my sermon tonight but Lord you come down to make your abode in us you're not just on the bus with us Lord you're not just sitting in church with us but you said that you would be with us even in us and Lord I tonight make the declaration Lord you are in me oh I pray every son or daughter of God would be able to lift a hand tonight and say thank you Lord you're in me you are working on the inside you're changing even the molecular structure of this being huh it's no longer something born of the flesh but it is now something born of the Spirit born of the very life of Jesus Christ we have become your DNA Lord we thank you for that as for your hand of Mercy Lord guide the church Lord guide each one father pray now Lord we all have our way we express things but Lord in my way i express it Lord let that two-edged sword come Lord whatever is in my life father that is not right lord if there be something of unbelief Lord if there be something of doubt or fear Lord come and circumcise that from us cut it away Lord that we could be that pure church and that your prophet was speaking about here Lord because that is our heart's desire that's what we long for and Lord I say this with all conviction of my heart and soul that is what we are not something we're going to become someday but Lord is a prophet of God showed us Lord we always were sons and daughters of your therefore Lord I always was a part of you Lord I always have had faith Lord that faith just as being revealed and Lord the very life is being revealed but Lord I belong to you the Lord I am of you I am in you you are in me I am bone of your bone I am flesh of your flesh I am life of your life I am spirit of your spirit Oh father Lord we claim that or reclaim that Lord Jesus
