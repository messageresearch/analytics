perfect and Hallelujah you know sometimes we Face things in the in the day little circumstances you realize maybe you didn't respond correct or circumstances seem to go sideways and you know Satan's right there to just tell us you've got a problem but I was just reading where the Prophet said and we'll touch on that tonight a little bit it's what voice we listen to there's the whole key to it all what voice amen amen do we listen to amen Hallelujah good to see our brother David Nash amen and I believe brother Isaac you guys are going up to Tri-Cities this coming weekend so brother Isaac's going to go up and uh and uh do a little technical work I believe for the little church there in Tri-Cities amen so you know uh at some point in time somebody broke in and robbed them and that's one of those times you think things went sideways you know how would that be how could someone be low enough to break into a church but the devil's been trying to break in forever amen so yeah exactly so so you know it just uh does so we'll look forward to and uh sister Jerry and I if you just pray for Jerry's stepmom uh Betsy uh we're gonna go up this weekend and uh see see them she has um just had a hard row uh to to go with the brain tumor and removal and it growing back and every time they take it out it comes back quicker and you know the Lord's given us opportunity before and I pray that this time the Lord also gives us opportunity amen I want to just speak to you once again on our journey thank you a beautiful song service actually several songs just spoke to my heart and also I wanted to mention we want to remember Daniel in prayer amen and that God would just continue to to work on him there's things working down inside of him and and we just want to see that come to fruition to serve the Lord and I know Sister April mentioned uh on Sunday that uh the consequence of going to help in Turkey is her work schedule so just remember her uh that they've got her on the grindstone for a while here till she gets back into a normal routine let's turn in our Bibles I want to speak to you on our journey and we've been talking about when our lord Jesus is on the road and tonight I want to just title this our road to this spoken word amen so you know uh it's so beautiful that we can look in scripture and see the parallels of of the word as it was recorded in that day and realize it's alive and well and representative of today amen so we don't have to look at historical scripture and say my that was interesting history it's here it's now it's part of who we are and God's giving us in this dark age is the prophet of God declared this would be the declining in in the Candlestick or the declining and darkness almost completely covering everything that we are here in that age and and this age I should say in this time and to have the insight into the word of God that has been given to us what a privilege God has given of this insight to see what the whole plan of Satan remember job he didn't understand what was going on but by God placing that in the word and revealing that to us we realize that God has opened the Hedge on our lives and Satan has that opportunity but by God's grace we also know through the word God's opinion of us amen that we can sit here and God says these are my servants I have full confidence in them and so we can stand today in the test and the trials the struggle and not be discouraged and wonder what is going wrong do I have a secret sin but to recognize that that Satan is truly roaring amen but he is not even a lion in the context of scripture because our lion is a lion of the tribe of Judah and he's a conqueror amen and that's the God we serve amen our road to the spoken word tonight will start in Matthew the 8th chapter we'll read verses 5 through 17 and I just trust there's so much more you know I was there and I wanted to draw more out of this the first four verses are you might say another story uh but I as when I got down to this I was like I need to condense this and you know it's interesting I trust that truly we do have a good service tonight it has started off very well today I spent my lunch hour uh finalizing my my thought and just as it was getting to the point I'm looking at the clock I've already taken an hour and 20 minutes for lunch and I need to go back to work and my iPad crashed and everything I had just disappeared and you know it's interesting because sister Jerry's like well maybe the Lord wanted you to speak something a little different because you've been studying by inspiration you look up little thoughts and you have little things and isn't it strange that you come back just a mere four hours later to try and get this all back together and you can't remember that one little quote that you had and there was another scripture what was that I never wrote it down it was by inspiration I looked it up and brought it and put it in there and we just pray God's will his way is perfect tonight amen amen Matthew the eighth chapter starting with the fifth verse and when Jesus was entered into Capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying Lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented and Jesus saith unto him I will come and heal him not I'll come and we'll see what happens just a matter of fact statement I will come and heal him the Centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed my I want to be that kind of Christian amen I want to be able to voice that kind of confidence amen as the prophet of God says we should be able to trust God that much thank you Lord for I'm a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it when Jesus heard it he marveled now this must really my brother and sister there was a much deeper impact right because our lord Jesus is marveling I want to do something in my life not not to show to the public not to show to anyone else but I want to have an expression in my life that my Lord Jesus would Marvel and say this is my daughter this is my son oh Hallelujah I'll tell you that just stirs my heart he heard it he marveled and said to them that followed verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel and I say unto you that many shall come from the East and West and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven but the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out into outer Darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth Jesus said unto the Centurion go thy way and as thou Hast believed do you realize Saints this is a little farther but I just feel to put it right here he had already made a declaration of what he believed he didn't have to go away and say now what will it be what will happen because it's going to be what I believe and do you realize as the prophet several ways that he says what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost in our day we're not here to try and focus it to this one pinpoint but I want to bring this the prophet said evidence of the Holy Ghost in our day is recognizing and acting on every word of God for our day now that's a pretty encompassing statement right we just don't come down and say ah oh I believe and I go to a message Church no no this this is the life within the life this is the truth expressed and we are ministering amen every single day what we believe Lord help us Heavenly Father we ask for your guidance tonight Lord just lead us guide us father may come forth beneficial to your people Lord that we could go away tonight encouraged Lord strengthened father those that are not here tonight or for the Chris I believe is in Oregon for Brother Rich his brother rich is having or had a mouth surgery father dental surgery we just ask you Lord just to be with him give him a quick recovery and Lord be with the bride of Christ our brothers and sisters not here tonight the many needs that there are in this assembly we ask you to touch father each and every one in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated thank you as my throat got all scratchy this afternoon Brother David I was even joking with sister Jerry that it might be a short notice to call you up and say Brother David you got about 20 minutes to be ready but you know a real minister of God has always got something burning amen the fire never goes out amen now as Jesus was on his journey my brother and sister are going through the land and it wasn't just that he decided he would walk to and fro and here and there but what he was doing was at the key time you might say a Divine appointment that he was making his presence making The Presence of Jehovah known in the land and it is that in the day that we live in God has repeated once again now there are millions of people who do not know the revealed word of the hour my brother and sister but there's still a voice in the land is that not correct there's still a Ministry still you might say if you would understand correctly a prophecy amen Prophet still going now my brother and sister when we are prophesying today it is not our ministry but it is the ministry of Jesus Christ manifested in us so we can't stand up and say I I have a Ministry you know and and raise our self up but today tonight we should be able each one to lift our hand and say I have a Ministry amen whether it's a mother to her children or that neighbor or however it might be we have a Ministry and as our lord Jesus was traveling through the country as we have just touched on different examples here he was there making the presence not not of this man and now we have a book at home that I have been reading I've been gleaning a few things from because even in a book written in this fashion it was a National Geographic and uh it is a a big thick book about Jesus and some of the things the man writes he writes things such as you know Jesus was perplexed whether his ministry was making a difference almighty God in flesh perplexed oh my brother and sister I'll tell you what's perplexed is their understanding of God is what's perplexed amen that they believe it because they're having a hard time even though they would say he's Divine they cannot put him in the realm of truly who he was and what he was here for and so our lord Jesus is traveling through the land and you know as he comes my brother and sister into Capernaum it is there that you know the crowd the throng is with them always and you know he had just come from the presence of a leper and I want to save the lepers for a another service well we'll uh lump some lepers together amen but you look at that and realize he just had a supernatural encounter with one who was considered unclean and this is just the point on that that I want to make my brother and sister it's one thing to recognize that a man is unclean on the external but God didn't come just to deal with the extra Eternal and he knew what Spirits there would be on the internal and he come to deal with the unclean period amen and I'm glad my brother and sister because I was born in sin and shaped in iniquity and God come amen and has changed our lives thank you Lord Jesus for that and so as he comes into the entrance or he's coming into Capernaum this Centurion now this man my brother and sister just by the very nature I can see him he's not some little Ruddy fellow but he is a man that no doubt the crowd separated for him as he would come a man no doubt of great uh uh courage and Valor and strength and presence to him and as he comes through the crowd he's not coming to show his natural abilities not coming to make some great declaration but there is something that has gripped him something that has come upon him and it is his a desire to his servant now we don't know what this relationship was how close this servant was to him and you know you might say as maybe a right-hand man just knew the nature of his master and just knew how to make life good for him and and that but this man comes and he has such a desire to his servant that he has made the effort we don't know just how far he traveled uh brother Branham says you know we don't know exactly where he come from he could have this or he could have that and it's irrelevant he put out an effort above and beyond he no doubt could have just said well if he dies I'll get another servant but he was a man no doubt that had a good heart a kind heart a Desiring heart might even have been touched by the gospel and he's coming and he's beseeching our lord Jesus now the word beseech is to keep the definition simple is fervent so this was not a hey if you find time are you headed this direction or that direction can I have a moment out of your busy schedule but he was fervently asking our lord Jesus oh my brother and sister this is going to pinch Paul I don't know if it'll pinch you but I wonder my brother and sister if the devil hasn't affected our prayer life enough that we have a hard time getting fervent are we approaching our lord Jesus fervently or do we just say well Lord you know this need and you know this need and you know this need Lord bless them help them guide them heal them touch them but to be that it struck me as I was studying this Lord let me get back to a place that my prayers are on fire they're fervent prayers not just prayer amen so he's asking fervently and my brother and sister we have spoke about it in the church here the prophet of God speaks about it we don't want to if we'll quit focusing on ourself and focus on those around us and then be able to with confidence know your brothers your sisters are praying for you as you pray for them and then we enter in fervently we'll have a lot less help me Lord prayers and then help my brother help my sister and as those prayers are you might say Crossing each other will come and find that God is going to move more than us praying Lord help me my situation I have this I have that and we would come and here's a centurion and he's fervently asking our lord Jesus not for himself but for I'm going to use the word a mere servant a servant that doesn't even in the context of scripture have a name he's just at his house James the fifth chapter verses 15 and 16. amen yes I moved ahead a little fast there sorry and the prayer of faith shall save the sick so we're looking at a context here I want to tie this in my brother and sister because this is how we tend to look at things the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him this is what my brother and sister as verse 16 says this is what fervent effectual prayer does it causes healing to come and it also causes repentance to come and God is willing to tie the two together go listen to the prayer lines go read the prayer line many times the prophet of God is declaring and the world criticizes but he says if you will confess and repent from this God will heal you and they say well he's putting something a requirement to this my brother and sister the word puts a requirement it's not a man amen it's telling you that the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he has committed sins they shall be forgiven why this has to be a heart that is Desiring the things of God firing to be taught Desiring to receive amen now I'm going to step out into limbo land if you don't mind for a moment I just believe as I read this scripture there was a servant that was sick back home who was believing that when his master met Jesus that he would be healed I don't believe he was there as a skeptic as a Critic and the Masters trying to force or Force something upon him there was a servant maybe a conversation had taken place and he says you're dying and he might say I am dying we're going to find Jesus amen please find him I want to live I desire to live and I I need I know there's things that need to change but I'm willing to give them up if he will touch me and I believe my brother and sister that because and we'll touch on this in a moment we often times outcome and believe that our approach is in a certain fashion must be done in a certain way and God sometimes comes and he confounds the wise he confounds he educated in those that have researched and tried to pinpoint what God's going to do next what I want to do is not pinpoint what God's going to do next I want to just walk in his perfect will that whatever he does next I'm in the middle of it amen I'm not on the outside trying to figure out how to get back in but I want to live a life where I'm in the middle of God's Will and when he moves I move with him amen confess your faults one to another and pray one for another so here we're coming now my brother and sister I I tie this if you don't mind me going there I tie this that here is a centurion who cares enough about a servant you realize in this case in that time of history that servant was no doubt a Slave and he cared enough for that slave because he didn't have a as it were Master of the world approach he had love for a servant oh God help us help us the lowly in our midst as we just a few Services ago from the small to the Great amen confess your faults one to another pray for another that she may be healed the effectual fervent amen not casual not weak need not limped not a Beggar's prayer but the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man of veileth much I'll tell you what my brother and sister I want my prayers to make a difference amen I want them to go and if Satan's trying to build a stronghold I want my prayers to come and I want them to batter down Satan's stronghold I don't want him to go and sign a treaty with him I don't want to sign some kind of agreement you don't bother me I won't bother you but I want my prayers to Avail much amen I want him to make a difference to the kingdom of almighty God amen and I'll tell you sometimes I don't say this is a boast or to lift up but I'll tell you sometimes when you voice things you just have to live it and lately it seems like I've been waking up about 2 30 3 o'clock in the morning I'm not happy about waking up at that time of the morning I want to be asleep but I find myself rolling over in bed and just starting to pray and I just do my very best to pray through the whole valley as it were to touch lives because it's like if the Lord wants me awake at 2 30 in the morning then there must be a reason for me to be up at 2 30 in the morning and so you go and this touches my heart because I want my prayers not to be just going out there and bouncing off the ground I don't want my prayers as an individual told me once brother Paul I feel like my prayers make it to the ceiling and no further I want my I want to have that confidence I want you to have that confidence that our prayers reach the Throne of almighty God and our prayers are coming as a sweet odor Before the Throne amen you can see by this man's approach to Centurion that he believed that Jesus was and Is A Healer he come in this approach making a declaration I need you I need you I can't change my servant's position the priest can't change it you see he might have had an entirely different priest we think you know Jewish priest but the preacher let me put it that way he won't make a difference he had enough Revelation my brother and sister to go straight to the source of life amen so it's there that he he recognized himself as not worthy now that was not demeaning him this man was a man as he makes in his own declaration a man of authority to be able to say come and they come and go and they go and do and they do he knew his position and I'm sure that when the time was sufficient and correct and inappropriate of the time he had no problem saying go come do this do that and yet he comes and says you know what I am not worthy to have you in my house brother Branham ads he says he would not even have been worthy to come into Jesus presence hmm my brother and sister but he did why because he was anointed amen there was a purpose that God had brought it and it wasn't even I don't believe just the healing of his servant I believe this man received a touch from God because you cannot my brother and sister come in the presence of the Supernatural and leave the same the prophet of God said we leave Better or Worse what are we going to choose my brother and sister I don't think it's even a decision to make I want to go away better amen come in the presence of almighty God and I want to be able to walk away a better man a better brother a better Christian amen able to express more of the faith that God has given to you and I amen so he comes with a declaration I'm not worthy amen now we look at this my brother and sister maybe he didn't know much more than that even brother Branham says we really don't know the word doesn't really show us we don't know what did he know what had he heard Rahab had heard of the power of the supernatural God of Israel while she's living in the middle of Jericho oh don't tell me that God can't send the message wherever God wants to send the message and have the message reach whoever he wants the message to reach oh my people act almost like afraid oh we're not going to get the message where it belongs my brother and sister God will get the message where it belongs it's his message he'll deliver it oh my God thank you Lord he delivered it to our house amen thank you Lord so so we don't know what he knew but he might not have known much more than that my brother and sister but look how much more that we should know in this hour in the day that we're living amen we should have a revelation we should have a grasp of what God is Desiring we have the word of the hour the revealed word of the hour we're not here as job was in limbo of what was happening in his life his friend says the secret sin he's examining saying I don't have a secret sin do I Lord no I don't believe I do and his friends are still insistent you had to do something wrong he was in limbo but we're here today recognizing the spirits of the age recognizing the demons that are opposed of us the things that would happen how that Satan would put the stumbling Stone in front of us and God says I'm not going to keep you from stumbling in other words you are still maybe years and years of not having a temper tantrum find yourself up upset over something and we oh Lord what happened but what God was doing was just giving us a reminder of his Amazing Grace it was not a sign that we have backslid and Fallen but a reminder you might say a memorial of God's Amazing Grace in our lives and what it does is it starts to come that where the prophet of God puts it this way when our experience starts to get stale God will make it fresh again oh it might be a little repenting time at an altar to get it fresh again but God's not going to let his bride their experience get stale oh thank you Lord amen and how much more we should know today my brother and sister the faith that God has given amen a prophet's words that says the faith all the faith everything you need these are just my way of putting it uh the faith in everything you'll need to make the Rapture is already my brother my sister already in you we don't got to run over here and search for it I've got to find some experience I gotta run over here I gotta go to this I gotta go to there I need to talk to a special person it's in you God's using that that stumbling Stone might actually be a releasing of something in your life that would cause you then to stand up and say I am resolved no longer to linger but I'm pressing forward Hallelujah amen now we look at this uh now I just love verse 7 Jesus says um yeah I'll come and heal him that's pretty matter matter of fact isn't it no deal like well tell me what the circumstance is is he a good guy a bad guy is he a faithful servant an Unfaithful servant is he fruitful Jesus said he's looking at this man and I'll tell you my brother and sister this is why the scripture tells us to be careful of the company we keep that's right if we could go into the mind of God we'd look at that but there's scriptures that deal with it so I believe we do have the mind of God amen he looks at Centurion and says my a servant to a man like this now this is just brother Paul saying this okay a servant to a man like this is going to be a good man but did Jesus really look at that because if he was looking for just good men I might have got left out Jesus many years ago I won't go into the whole gist of it I didn't know how to pray you have somebody that's been a good Christian for a lot of years maybe up in age a little bit and things catching up with them and you hear they're in the hospital and you think Lord would it be better you just took them home I didn't know how to pray then one day it's revealed to me Lord thy will be done and we always pray for life but we're giving that open door because really Saints what is life to a believer so when you're giving permission as it were because you realize we have to give God permission the prophet of God said that the holy spirit's a gentleman won't go won't come in where he's not invited amen so this context I've been told that I'm totally messed up on this but we have to give God permission and so by praying in that fashion Lord thy will be done but we're praying for life you are there open the door whether it's natural life or spiritual life amen you are and then surrendering your desire to God's desire and my brother and sister sometimes it's just that simple Lord we have to give them to you that thy will be done so it's there that Jesus says I'll come and heal him and now we're seeing something this very very incredible the Centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou should cometh under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed now you realize what was happening there my brother and sister this Centurion who is a gentile is speaking by Revelation something that uh maybe he understood in its context but maybe he did not anointed to speak of that because you see what he was doing he was actually opening a new dispensation to the Gentiles he was actually opening a new expression from the word amen because it's completely scripture where he was standing and it's there at this time that he is dealing Jesus is dealing with the Jews and now as he deals with this Centurion he speaks of something that is not often in or ever heard are you with me I put this taking this from a quote here uh as that he was speaking a new dispensation a new opening of the word and brother Branham says in Hebrews chapter 3 amen that uh it's there he says now Paul trying to get later on get down here the experience that he had see trying to relate The Experience he typed it to the Old Testament he said now we've entered into a new thing to this new dispensation by Jesus Christ old times the Lord appeared to them by the prophets but now he's by his son Jesus so in the presence of Jesus this Gentile Centurion has a revelation that is expressed from him maybe it was not a intellectual theological understanding but it was the heart speaking when he makes this declaration don't come to my house just speak the word oh my brother and sister I want to type this in in many ways tonight but it would take too long but you see it comes down why we don't have a Mecca we don't need to go to a certain place we don't need to go into a church and rub the foot of a statue or rub the hand you know brother Brown talks about that and I have been privileged to be in different places in Europe and to see that and they've replaced those hands you can see that and they're almost completely rubbed off again to see a young woman in complete uh despair coming in putting her coins in the Box lighting the candle going over and putting the candle and bowing before a statue and rubbing the feet while she's crying my brother and sister God has come and given us a new revelation are you with me amen this new dispensation by Jesus Christ old times the Lord appeared to them by the prophet now it's by his son Jesus and he began to type the experience and show them what was taking Place how the signs and wonders and everything what's wrote and you want to express or expand on that just go look that up and read before and after but it's looking there I took this thought as it struck me this new dispensation what was happening God was saying I'm going to deal with the Gentiles differently than I deal with the Jews and I'm going to open the word to them and actually give in one sense a greater portion than the Jews ever had because now and taking this going to bring them behind the veil into my presence amen and I'm going to reveal myself as a bridegroom amen you realize that God didn't come to Israel in that context he come in that way and Israel only knew that way and here is a centurion and and he is now speaking out something that must have confounded those around him and Jesus is astonished and says you know I haven't seen this great of faith not in all of Israel he's speaking of all these people who have not enough Faith to take out and simply State the word now we'll touch on this a little bit more in a minute I'm not confusing am I I find myself my thoughts are just racing so fast that I'm kind of struggling a little bit forgive me and so it's there that he says just speak the word only and so then he goes uh verses 9 and uh tan and he and he describes that I'm under Authority and I have soldiers and I say to this man and uh to another come and go and my servant do and he doeth and Jesus Marvels as we read all her earlier and he says verily I say unto you I've not found so great faith no not in Israel look at this my brother and sister he had a revelation people would have come and said where did you get that I can't find that in the message well I'll tell you what happened was as I heard a prophet make a declaration one day he said you know this love letter I'm over in Africa and the wife sends this letter and I'm reading the letter I'm reading the words on the line but I'm reading between the lines and people will say you're going to get messed up if you read between the lines but not when it's a love letter you won't get messed up if it's just a letter on the page right here you read between the lines you'll get confused but when this becomes a love letter to you you'll read between the lines and the prophet of God says the word will speak to you the word Jesus Christ will speak to you between the lines oh my brother and sister have been told people like you're gonna just take your track Church into a wreck reading between the lines well I'll tell you what my brother and sister if I'm reading your love letters I'm not going to be able to understand totally but when I'm reading my love letters amen there's something that speaks out that no one else understands and brother Branham says and she's there I'm doing the laundry what's that going to say to anyone else must have a lot of laundry what is spoke to the prophet of God and he declares this I miss you I love you I'm thinking of you oh Hallelujah aren't you glad you can read between the lines amen so it was there a revelation just speak the word now my brother and sister I'm going to condense some of this I have down here it just seems like time escapes but look at this now how many times the prophet of God he told us that you have to come to the place that the book becomes alive to you amen there's a reason he said it has to be alive he wasn't just filling the page with words it's at the point that it becomes alive that something stirs in the heart of the believer amen and that's why the prophet of God said pray for Revelation amen you come as a centurion you've got a sick servant and you come and you say hey there's rumors around Israel that you've been doing some strange phenomenal kind of things and I'm just wondering if you'll come down and you'll do that on this no my brother and sister this man come he was already convinced he was already sold out he was already a believer amen cause only a Believer can speak the word in that fashion people say we don't have any evidence that the man was a Christian but I'm telling you you have to have the Holy Ghost to declare that Jesus is the Christ and he come in that essence of declaring you the word just need to speak okay we can scramble those words can't we just speak the word or the word just needs to speak amen and when the word spoke my brother and sister there was something that stirred in this man's heart amen and Jesus says you know what hey I I I see this Revelation in him and he's trusting in the spoken word oh my brother and sister Jesus said it was manifestation of great faith I have not seen such great faith in all of Israel look how this is Faith is always coming up as a point isn't it almost every minister is always touching on faith faith faith and here comes a man brother Trevor I just my heart just jumped up and down amen here comes a man who says word bear with me a little bit Saints word just speak just speak I believe if you'll just word of God Speak fall down like rain oh Hallelujah amen and he caught that Revelation and Jesus says that was great faith and I want to just come to you my brother and sister and here we are today I believe we can lift our hands and say we are here and we have heard the word speak and we said amen to the word and we come before God whether at home or in church speak my Lord speak my Lord now look we'll say I I need more faith can can we honestly just admit that we sometimes say Lord I need more faith well I want to tell you when you are saying Speak to Me Lord speak the word speak truth to me Jesus Christ because he's the same yesterday today and forever is saying I see great faith oh my brother and sister are not Faith to go out and make this happen and make that happen but Faith to stand and say speak the word my Lord and my heart my soul will respond to it it will bring life oh Hallelujah look at this now in the message the countdown Hallelujah I believe that's right there now the first thing is these things that we're talking about are they so are they not we know the Bible promised it but is he here God is here to do what we what he promised that he would do God is here see can we say Amen to that God is here see we've gone beyond speaking with tongues now I want to I want to just throw a little Clarity sister and Jerry and I have a conversation my brother and sister when the prophet of God says we've gone beyond speaking in tongues he is not cutting it off he is not throwing it to the side he's telling us that it is not the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost that's been preached this Doctrine we understand that it's not proof as the world wants to make it proof amen he's saying we've be gone beyond speaking with tongues that's all right see we've be gone beyond these little things and some people will take that and say see now that's just nothing but look what brother Branham is really showing us is God has led his dear children along amen and when he leads us to your children along there's a time and a season that we pass through every bit we cross our Red Sea we have crossed our Wilderness of sin we have come into our time of Purim or the purging of the cleansing we've come through all of these we've got our feasts my brother and sister hasn't went away it's just come in another manifestation where God has raised us up in Revelation to look at what God was doing in the Old Testament and what he meant in the New Testament and find a perfectly mesh together he didn't throw one away the word says He didn't come to do away with the law but come to fulfill the law I say Lord fulfill the law in me fulfill it me Lord that whatever you desire Lord I don't have to dodge it I don't have to find an excuse why not I can come and say Lord just let the life manifest in me let me be who you want me to be now look at the reason brother Brown I'm saying this and see we're into a place now we've got to have astronaut Faith he doesn't say now if you're going to be spiritual you need astronaut Faith he says you've got to have we're living in a different age with a culmination of spirits with Satan attacking on every uh away every behalf no you got to have astronaut Faith amen amen because if we stay EarthBound all we're going to do is talk about living in Heavenly places we've got to get on the rocket of the revelation of God's word and get up out of the muck and the mire my oh my that's astronaut power see now look at this some of you may be already read ahead I don't know what to do about you guys that's astronaut power look at this now to realize that we're in Christ already and we're not like struggling to get in Christ amen what we got to struggle to realize is that we are already shaking off our Earthly bound uh bindings or chains uh whatever you want to call it we're shaking that off already and moving up into a relationship into Heavenly places that's how realize we're in Christ already just more of Christ see to list Lift us up in Heavenly places the old method now look at this the old method of praying laying hands on the sick that's good that was Luther's day's friend now you've got to understand in the countdown what brother Brown's talking about the progression of man amen so that we make sure we understand where he's going there that was Luther day's friends back in the automobile and so forth were beyond that now what are we doing we're moving up into Heavenly places we're not Earthbound we're moving into Heavenly places amen remember Jesus come to the Jews the old days Jairus said Jairus said come and lay your hands upon my daughter and she'll live but the Romans said I'm not worthy that you come just speak the word oh look where the Prophet was sending us or trying to get us to go my brother and sister to come that mothers sisters brothers you don't have to be preachers you don't have to be this or that you just going to come with a revelation that God put in you in this day speak the word I've got a sick child in the name of Jesus Christ I declare healing amen I need a situation Lord you know my motive you know my heart you know the purpose I call you on the scene amen God asking us in a way or commanding us in a way amen speak the word amen he recognized the power of Christ see this is how brother Branham this is how brother Branham describes this Roman Centurion he recognized the power of Christ that he was over all things what did he do he come submitted himself now get this he didn't debate himself he submitted himself do you know in the natural world of business when you're interacting with people they might be younger than you they might whatever it would be but you're talking a position of respect one way to come and deal with him is in the very Forefront of your business dealings sir regardless of their age you are doing and you'll find or at least I have found in my life they almost always reciprocate and instead of some casual you or that or Bob or Paul it is on a higher level and the Centurion had come saying I have authority and I know I have authority I speak it happens but I'm submitting to you oh isn't that beautiful that we can come with confidence let me express it this way we can come in confidence in this life as a confident believer a confident businessman or whatever it might be and submit to the Lord it doesn't make us less of a man or a woman amen it just puts us in a correct position that we can step into and it unlocks a channel amen now look at this he recognized the power of Christ that he was over all things now if Christ is over all things he's got to keep his word he is King he is God he must keep his word The Works that I do shall you also oh my I like that amen God's got to keep his word he obligated himself when he said the works that I'm going to do you're going to do also so what was it my brother and sister as Jesus spoke the word he has declared to you and I that you will speak the word and when you speak the word it will bring results oh what are the words that we're going to choose to speak that will be the real question amen amen now as far as healing somebody nobody can do it because it's already done it's already done it's just a recognition of it see the recognition that he is in our presence my goodness my brother and sister there's people in the message that still believe God's gone somewhere out in The Ether and we're here just calling out to him they struggle with the idea that God is in US come on here's the word and he's declared it the scripture declares it the prophets of all declare it the word of God to this day has come and declared that he is in US amen recognize he's in our presence do you believe that amen so you look at that and see that he has come and the Centurion recognized that he was standing in a presence that knew all was in control of all and he knew oh you're not going to find this on the page but I believe it in continuity of the word he knew that he had the faith to unlock that power amen wow you know what the difference is of that the difference between a confident Christian and one that's not sure where they stand day in and day out knowing that he's given us Authority amen not the power but you don't need the power if you've got the key to unlock my brother and sister the Centurion come with the right key now let me hurry along here I'm getting getting stretched out now I had several quotes and I don't know that I need to read them all so we'll hit some high points here amen God has promised to meet the need of the hour he always does that and we need the voice of God today to meet the need of the hour to meet the time that we're living in is that not true my brother and sister we need God's voice but now I I don't mean to say this controversial but my brother and sister the voice of God there is not anything else but our Lord Jesus Christ amen that's what the prophet of God is speaking amen he wasn't speaking the name of something of an entity he was speaking of our Lord Jesus Christ amen so it's there we need the voice of God today to meet the need of the hour to meet the time that we're living in and after he has promised it we can rest assured that he will keep his promise that's the confidence that the believer has in his maker that he promised to meet the need Can someone say thank you Lord amen and today one reason that the church is in the condition that it's in is because there's so many voices so many other voices to attract the church from the voice of god Till It's very doubtful that many would hear the voice of God though it spoke right in their midst oh God help us Grace Tabernacle help us Grace Tabernacle not to come there's so many voices that God would be here in our midst speaking and we couldn't hear him oh my the prophet of God said it's happening amen we don't want to come to that we need to stay right to that and stay tuned to The Voice amen they perhaps wouldn't even understand it because it would be a foreign thing to them they have got themselves so much centered on the voices of the day wow I tell you what that is to me very strong and if we notice in our scripture reading that the voice of God was foreign to them and it's become that way again today that the voice of God so many other voices and then if God promised he would give us that and if ever the voices are contrary to the voice of God then it must be the voice of our enemy oh I don't mean to take it there my brother and sister but I have in in position of Pastor Minister heard so many voices that had quotes to back up their voice I don't want quotes to back up my voice I want God's voice to back up my voice amen I want his word to declare and be able to stand and say I'm only saying what the master said amen so if it isn't if it's contrary to the voice of God it must be the voice of our envy and I'm not pointing this at no one please trust me on that to confuse us that we would not understand the voice of God when it spoke do we listen to the kind or priest or Jesus prophet of God says now who helped him when they were sick paid the doctor bill the kind whole priest who helped him and they were trouble over here kind old priest who helped him at this time who helped him that time the kind old priest but when it come to the word in their presence they listened to the kind old priest God help us amen God help us only hear that voice amen Hallelujah I want to hurry right along here amen Hebrews 10 22 23 says let us draw near with a true heart and full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscious and our bodies washed in pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering my brother and sister I'll tell you what the Centurion he didn't come there saying if maybe you can or whatever he come there all you have to do is speak the word he didn't wait and if Jesus paused for a moment say well uh no he knew by Revelation all it took was a spoken word and the world would change for him and his servant and I don't think you could have shook him from that I think if Jesus had put him to the word test I believe he would have just stood right there and said nope you don't even need to come to my house nope you don't need to come to my house you want to come to my house that's fine come to my house you don't need to come to my house what I need is not to go to this place sorry to make this reference Mecca I don't need to go over here to this or over to that what I need to hear is a spoken word of God I need to hear the voice of God oh my because when you hear that voice prophet of God says once I heard that voice I recognize that voice he also said that when you come into the presence of that he never lost you might say that physical almost fear that was there but he realized it was the presence of God and the presence of God came to bless him it blessed him with Revelation it blessed him with you might say the guideline of the word of the hour restoration it also blessed him with correction thank you Lord for correcting me thank you Lord for a heart that could receive correction um now jumping to Romans 10 real quick verses 8 through 10 but let's say it that the word is neither even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach now Paul's speaking to the Romans but my brother and sister the Centurion had this Revelation right here and he come amen and the word of faith was in his mouth and Jesus recognized that and was there and was astonished here this man has the Revelation that the word of faith is coming from his lips and if God would honor a centurion amen he'll honor you and I oh God help us that our language would be lifting up and let the word of faith come from our lips that we would speak this out amen and if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus Shall Believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation hear this Roman Centurion would not have been able to take the word I don't believe and explain that to you and I but it came to him by Revelation and he spoke it forth and it brought forth healing of his servant and I believe his life was changed oh my oh my oh my amen now look look let's jump back to Matthew 8 and 13 real quick here amen amen sister vika if you would come Matthew 8 and 13. let's look at this now and Jesus said unto the Centurion go thy way and ask thou Hast believed so be it done unto thee [Music] prophet of God preached blessings and cursings can they come from the same water can it come from the same mouth and I want to take it a little further can it come from the same heart let's not let Satan confuse us because that's what he's trying to do let him not confuse us you just speak the word Lord I'm here to receive it I believe it I will act upon it because that's the seed that's been planted in this good soil don't you love it amen I just love it because it lays out to me such a beautiful picture right here my brother and sister why the prophet of God express to you and I over and over and over to speak the word speak the word why because it's Christ in US and as he spoke and the Centurion servant received the blessing of it Christ in you and I I want to say this tonight not drama not profound but from my heart God bless you amen that's my heart God bless you that there's power my brother and sister in those words amen there's something that shakes the foundation of hell when Sons and Daughters of God start speaking blessing on Sons and Daughters of God and we don't do that as backslapping good old boys we do that as Sons and Daughters of God knowing my brother and sister that our profession of faith amen God Honors that hallelujah amen go thy way as thou Hast believed so be it done unto thee and his servant was healed in the self same hour oh my oh my I tell you my brother and sister I want more of Jesus Christ in this church I want more of Jesus Christ in my life and my family amen I want to see this group of Believers blessed beyond measure you might say well we have some issues we have some things yeah okay are we going to speak to the issue or is the issue going to speak to us amen I want to come to a place that I speak to the issue amen Lord take us above these little things take us above doubts take us above timid Spirits where we can't reach out and take a whole to the word of God take us above these things that keep holding us back we rise up Satan comes in and we back away we rise up Satan comes in we back away I'm telling you my brother and sister we've wore out that path it's time for us to climb higher hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let's just stand praise the Lord for just a moment or two before we go Alleluia Jehovah Jireh 250. amen [Music] just
