it's going to be church for eternity amen praise the lord we stand tonight amen praise the lord i didn't mean that to sound negative in the in that in that way but amen acts chapter seven if you have your bibles you know i was sitting in the back thinking take this coat off now before i get started and i was praying for for different needs in our body and just praying that the lord would speak to our hearts tonight and i began to think you know we're we as humans we say and i won't keep you standing for long we say sunday is a greater service than wednesday night and meetings greater than sunday morning and camp meetings greater than meetings but that's what we say and the reason that is is because we ourselves don't live in a place that we don't live in that place of close connection with the lord in close connection with the lord you don't need your flesh worked up because your spirit's already on fire so tonight in in you know wednesday night this is no different than any other service you've ever been in the most powerful service you can think of guess what the word is still being spoken tonight the same word that god designed that god spoke from the beginning amen so have faith whatever your need is it doesn't matter that it's wednesday night doesn't matter that it's brother chris it's god's word being spoken acts chapter seven acts chapter seven verse 18. 7 18. so here we have um stephen he was called by the church by by god through the the vote to be one of the first deacons and he was out preaching the word of god excuse me i know it's goofy but if i leave that it's going to drive me crazy because it's not being used so he's out preaching and they arrested stephen and he begins to i call it stephen's rebuke he begins to to minister and his title was ye stiff neck uncircumcised people and uh about a portion of his way through the sermon he starts with abraham he starts at the beginning of the church of israel and he gets through abraham and joseph and he gets down to begin the story of moses verse 18 acts 7 18 tell another king rose which knew not joseph the same dealt subtly with our kindred and evil entreated our fathers so that they cast out their young children to the end they might not live i was reading this and i thought you know what the pharaoh didn't just come and say okay y'all are slaves now it says they dealt subtly so a little bit here a little bit there a little bit here tell at the end of the of the end of of of the the program they found themselves completely in bondage it wasn't just overnight and the devil does a thing same thing it's a slow fade um verse 20 in which most in which time moses was born and was exceeding fair and nourished up in his father's house three months and when he was cast out pharaoh's daughter took him up and nourished him for her own son and moses was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians and was mighty in words and deeds and when he was full 40 years old it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of israel and seeing one of them suffer wrong he defended him and avenged him that he that was oppressed and smote the egyptian i'm going to pause there and we're going to pray because i don't want to keep you standing for too long heavenly father lord jesus we thank you for your word tonight we ask that you would speak to us lord father by the power given to us lord as your children as your bride we bind every hindering spirit in the name of jesus christ lord that your word would have preeminence lord that you would have full control of the service full control of our thoughts our hearts lord and father you would increase our revelation increase our strength inspire us lord give us that touch that deliverance and healing we ask lord we commit these things into your hands in the name of jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated tonight so we have moses here who's 40 years old and my my title tonight is appointment with destiny and my subtitle is it happened on holy ground appointment with destiny i have quotes to back up the word destiny in case you're thinking i'm getting carnal on you so moses here in in the scripture is 40 years old and before we read the next verse so don't skip ahead this is a man a very intelligent man there wasn't a law in the land he didn't know he could tell you paragraph 365 subject a and uh this is the the law he knew he was he was he was mighty in words and in deeds okay so think think about that as we read uh 24 and seeing one of them suffer wrong he defended him and avenged him that was oppressed and smote the egyptian he knew he was breaking the law he wasn't just caught up in the moment and and no he knew what he was doing he was a smart man but you see he had it figured out he talked to any criminal they had it figured out uh until they got caught but you see here he moses had it figured out he'd gone over the details in his head and his and he thought about it and and he went out if you go and you read in exodus he went out among his brethren so he was walking around seeing what was happening taking into account he began to formulate because he felt that calling in his life he felt that that poll in his life that he wanted to rescue his his brethren and we we take that that type sometimes it many times just say you know he he thought of uh uh he would just go ahead and do it his own thing um and and moses was was trying to take the the word of god the promise the promise was they would go into bondage but that they would be free he was trying to take that promise into his own hands and whenever whenever a man or a church or a system begins to take god's word destiny your destiny in their own hands they begin to play with that that is a religious spirit a religious spirit says we look we see the promise of god you see it's it's religious it looks like the real thing it's close but they say we want to take this and we want to put it in our time we want to set it into our into motion at this time and we want it to look like this a certain way but but it it's so close it would deceive the very elect but there's one thing with the religious spirit it relax lacks excuse me the authority of christ so so moses here he goes out verse 25 for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that god by his hand would deliver them but they understood not so there went his plan his plan was hey they're going to understand and the rebellion's going to rise up and i'm not going to have to worry about pharaoh but his plan disappeared it vaporized and the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove so two israelites fighting and would have set them at one again saying sergi our brethren why do you wrong one to another but he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away saying who made thee a ruler and a judge over us will thou kill me as thou didst the egyptian yesterday you know one thing about a church news travels fast then fled moses at this saying and was a stranger in the land of midian where he begot two sons and when 40 years were expired another 40 years i haven't even lived 40 years i'm not even ready to leave egypt if i was moses it's a long that's a lot of time to be sitting on something to be sitting on a calling to be to feeling this way and then to run no doubt moses beat himself up for 40 years thinking i made a mistake i've ruined it but he had an appointment with destiny and moses at this saying okay excuse me when 40 years were expired verse 30 there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sinai an angel of the lord in a flame of fire in a bush which was christ tell them i am that i am and when moses saw it he wandered at the sight and as he drew near he stepped aside to go look at this bush that burned but but then it wasn't consumed behold to behold it the voice of the lord came unto him saying i am the god of thy fathers the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob then moses trembled and durst not behold then said the lord to him put off thy shoes from thy feet for the place where thou standest is holy ground now i took a little bit of time to kind of figure out you know in my in my engineer brain i like to over complicate things and and by god's grace and his simplicity and his spirit he helps me overcome that and i began to think about shoes and and the simple fact of it is is that people are very proud of their shoes these aren't these are just you know whatever's but these are oxfords status gucci if you're into that or genuine leather handmade in the united states or genuine leather handmade in in italy people feel important with their shoes and you feel a little bit less uh confident when you're barefoot let me tell you something do you think if you went do you feel confident going into an interview with a full suit barefoot absolutely not so here is moses and the first thing that god requires of him is put aside your pride and show respect but it says respect to take his shoes off you're standing on holy ground moses take off your shoes these are probably special boots handcrafted in egypt that had lasted 40 years he'd always taken good care of them these are his egyptian boots and the lord said look you can't meet me walking on a other a man's religion i want you to stand and come into contact nothing between i want full contact moses so he says take off your shoes for the place where thou standest is holy ground i have seen i have seen the affliction of my people which is in egypt and i have heard their groaning and then come down to deliver them now come i will send thee into egypt this moses whom they refused saying who made thee a ruler and a judge the same did god send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush you see the first time around it was moses on his own but the second time around there was a change of ownership now it wasn't moses going back it was god in moses going back but you see god likes to make sure you have faith so he sent the same man that everyone's been gossiping about for 40 years you remember that guy that thought he could deliver us and he ran into the wilderness and we hadn't seen him in 40 years you remember that guy wow you know people talk about him at the potlucks the sunday paul remember that guy yeah that preacher you know whatever he he lost his revelation he ran off into the wilderness and and he's probably dead by now that same guy god sent back and everyone had to swallow their pride not only moses had us all his pride but the rest of israel had to swallow their pride and then to make it worse the first meeting moses had with with pharaoh caused everyone to have more work make bricks without straw this moses guy has me convinced no the flesh man would say this moses guy has done lost it he was at 40 years too long in the desert and now he's going to come back and tell me how to have church i'm an israelite he's what the the news is his parent wasn't hebrew but he was raised by egyptians you see the rest of israel had to lay down their pride so that god could use them because israel was coming to the time of a fulfillment of a promise they had an appointment with destiny and you can see the test of this generation in of israel when they come for the river jordan 10 out of the 12 spy says we can't do it in other words there was something in them that was crafted those years in bondage that they never found deliverance oh they were out of egypt they were in the desert they walked through the red sea they they walked through the revivals they walked through the camps they walked in the message for years and years but when it came time for adoption when it came time to make their move to step into their position they couldn't do it in the great shining light 1957 brother battle says but it gives us consolation to know this that we do not hold our destiny god holds our destiny and he has ordained it to be so there is nothing will ever interrupt the program of god even a man taking matters into his own hands and killing another person 40 years in the desert moses thought he had made a mistake and that was the end of it 40 years later god moved in him because you cannot corrupt the program of god we are bound he says he says if there is nothing will ever interrupt the program of god we are bound to arrive you just stop right there and preach a whole other message we are bound to arrive and don't steal that adoption number one election looks back to foreknowledge and predestination looks to destiny so election looks to foreknowledge predestin foreign knowledge looks to predestiny excuse me election looks to foreknowledge foreknowledge looks to predestination and predestination looks to destiny if you go back and you listen to this portion of the sermon that's what he says he says don't forget that that election looks back here here it is i was a cuckleberry i was born in sin shaped an iniquity come to the world speaking lies born agai among sinners father and mother and all my whole family sinners i was a cuckleber but all of a sudden i become a wheat grain what did how did it happen what is that election god before the foundation of the world elected that the cocoa border was to become a grain of wheat now i know i'm a grain of wheat because i'm saved how do i do it look back and see that he predestinated it long time ago by foreknowledge he seen that i would love him so he made a propitiation through his own son that through him i might become from a cocklebur to a grain of wheat now where am i at now i'm saved i'm walking in the grace of god what does predestination look to destiny where will he take me to it where am i going amen that's got you there you are now i i i i have a quite a few quotes here and i'll try to to cut them in and and cut the splice not in that way um that's just to stumble those make believers but you see we read this quote so the election looks to foreknowledge foreign looks to predestination and predestination looks to destiny we want to pick up we want to turn to to actually before we do that we'll read these these other quotes here in the first seal 1963 now the lamb is standing now tonight as we enter into the sixth chapter he's got the book in his hand and standing to starting to reveal it and no i would have absolutely today had and and i hope that people are spiritual so he says think about he says be spiritual please he says i would have had a horrible mistake on that what's that he he goes before this and he explains what that is the seal the sixth seal on the preaching of the seals that if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock today when the holy spirit came in the room and corrected me on something that i was writing down to say i was taking it from an old context i had nothing on it i don't know what the second seal is no more than nothing but i had got some old context of something that i had spoke on several years ago so he goes on to say without reading the rest of the quote that he had some some information some other things that you know other people had said of the men had said and he was like he said you know intellectually put it all together this is how i'm going to speak this seal and so on and so forth and um i'll try to slow down here for our brother alex um and and so he he had this this context and he and he was about to set things in order but then the whole the angel of the lord came down and set him straight you see it was brother branham like it was moses but then on holy ground at at the appointed time god came down into the room and he came under new ownership the word he was going to speak came under new ownership how can this be a message that we follow of a man it can't be so now that was just was just a little nugget in there so in in uh in the uh adoption number four if you haven't realized it by now i've been listening to the adoption series recommend it um seal what is a seal what is a seal a seal is first thing it shows is a work that has been completed amen a completed work the next thing it shows is ownership you know one of my one of my subtitles at first was was change of ownership but you can take this it started on it happened on holy ground as that transition where you go from what you were doing of your own strength and you take off your shoes of religion and you step on god's holy ground full contact with god and then now you come underneath a new ownership because then your thoughts are not your thoughts your desires are not your desires they are the desires that god has given you and placed within you but but the only way you can have this position is when you're in your position standing on holy ground now okay so the next thing it shows is ownership and the next thing it shows is security keeping it safe for instance i used to work for the pennsylvania railroad i used to work with my father on the railroad so he goes on to say they worked and and the inspector would come and and i like this part he says and but before that car was ever sealed the inspector come through there and he pushed on it he shoved on this one he shook that one i'll condemn it they'll break all the pieces before they get there condemn it take them out do it over the inspector condemned the car why because he put some pressure on it and it fell apart like god likes to put the pressure on you god put the pressure on abraham god put the pressure on the children of israel before they stepped over into their destiny they had an appointment to meet but you see before you can meet your appointment you have to be prepared god's going to do surgery on you before you go into the or the operating room you have to be prepared maybe you have to make sure you haven't consumed anything for 24 hours no liquids no solids so they can operate on you there's certain things that have to be done to prepare you for your appointment now you see so so so god comes along and people say oh you know i got the holy ghost and and everything's gonna be all good now or they come to church and they repent and they're baptized and they have yet to be sealed excuse me i jumped ahead there they're yet to be sealed and god begins to put the shake on them god begins to push them around they say well i thought god was a god of love you see people for people don't understand why is there a misconception or a misunderstanding of god's love because there's only two things we either have the the true or the perverted and what does the devil want to do he wants to pervert that divine love why because it is divine love that gives you revelation of christ in your life because god is love agape something that we're that perfection of love that we are striving for so so he comes along and he shakes and he pushes things around and and rattles things and if it rattles he says hey it's not ready to go yet and he says the holy ghost is the inspector he shake you a little bit and you rattle do you believe all the word of god i don't believe that old jesus name stuff condemn it you rattle i don't believe in divine healing or no such thing still rattle take them out so you see god begins to work and to push and to press on you and everything down forth but then once everything's packed good in good and tight full of the gospel oh every word of god is good everything is perfect i believe every word skip on down to paragraph 149 then the inspector closes the door what does he do he puts a seal on it then he gets down there and gets a hold of these little okay so he he puts a seal on it once he's done the rattling and the shaking god took moses now we know this was this is the old testament but it's god's word coming to life and so god took moses and he went ahead and put him through the back side of the desert you see moses took his action to took the what god was was calling him to do into his own hands and he began to begin to try to bring his destiny to pass he began to try to to to set things in order for himself he was doing it underneath the wrong anointing he had yet to have he had yet to meet christ on the backside of the desert he had yet to meet christ on mount sinai in the burning bush he needed to meet the i am he had not yet met him but then moses goes out and he runs off and he's in the wilderness for 40 years and then he still hasn't met him but 40 years later amen he steps aside and he and he meets christ but you see what i want to do is i'm kind of got off my topic there what i want to focus on tonight tonight is that is that moses in his mistake in his in his own thinking and what he was trying to do and how he he if you will messed it up did not break the plan of god he did not break the program moses had an appointment with destiny nothing on earth can keep you from that appointment not even yourself he was a baby in a basket on the river preserved by the enemy taken up by an egyptian woman you see god you say god sent him into the world yes for 40 years you could say 80 because you didn't meet god until another 40 years later but you see we look at present circumstances and we try to come to a an end result by but we leave god out of the picture i i've god's been dealing with my heart and on this thing nothing can happen to you as long as you're living under the blood nothing can happen to you unless god says so and if god says so isn't that his perfect will i don't care what it is i don't care what what what circumstance or what's wrong you're not there outside of god's will it's god's perfect will he will not take you from this earth until he is done with you we were driving today and kind of took a little drive this morning we do it sometimes and and we we were going to pull off of indiana onto karcher and there was a car in front of us with the car behind it and as the car was going straight across karcher they go the car over here goes to turn and this dump truck loaded dump truck full speed which is about about 55 goes right through the stop sign eight feet from the front bumper of both the cars we almost witnessed the death and the guy was freaked out but you see even those people god wasn't done with them it doesn't matter what happens so and you know i i can say this because i uh a good friend of of mine who was a good friend of of charlie collins charlie and rachel collins the ones that passed away in the explosion he was it was his buddy and we spent some time with uh brother troy and his and his family and when we were in ohio we stayed with them for a few days and lovely family our kids just got along real great together we got along great together and he said he shared with me this that the day after the funeral brother danny steeman was ministering and he preached on job god giveth and god taketh away blessed be the name of the lord and you would think in your call of mine how dare he preach that but troy was there troy was a good friend it was a tragedy for him and he said it was one of the most powerful services he could have ever been in you see nothing happens to you there was two different people that were supposed to be there for that explosion that weren't a whole family and then charlie's brother seven minutes after his brother left that house exploded another family was supposed to be there they got held up by different circumstances they had to eat dinner and the brother got held up by the cop they got pulled over and the cop just happened to talk to him for 30 minutes and they should have been there you see god will not take you from the scene until you've had your opponent with destiny in other words god has a plan for you now i say that that's the extreme side of the situation life or death but no matter what you're struggling with no matter what addiction you're struggling with no matter what sickness you're struggling with god has an appointment with destiny for you and there is nothing you can do nor the devil to keep you from that appointment moses life was threatened after killing the egyptian but god preserved him by sending him into the desert moses thought he was running for his life because he'd made a mistake but god was guiding his footsteps because he had a wife to me on the other side of that desert in midian and the sun god wasn't on this side of the desert you see saying that god god god is on the other side of the desert god was on the other side of the desert for paul he spent three and a half years undoing god was undoing all the false doctrine he had been living underneath through the purging of the word paul didn't go hang out with peter for three and a half years and have seminary no paul onto the backside of the desert he went to the desert of arabia and he spent here and and and his revelation was on the other side of that desert you're in a desert right now let me tell you this by thus saith the lord that's the word of god that's not my my own thing god is on the other side of your desert no matter what it is you're going through i do not care the best thing that you i care okay the best thing that you can do instead of focusing on the desert and the sand and the lack of water the best thing that you can do is focus on christ because when you get to the other side of the desert you don't want to wander for another 40 years you see what happened they did their desert time the children of israel did their desert time but when they got to the end they didn't use that desert time to be prepared to meet christ so they wanted another 40 years but i'm gonna i'm gonna bring in a twist twist to that a little later but deliverance didn't come for the children of israel though it was a promise of the word it was a promise of the word that the children of israel would be delivered but it had to come at god's appointed time moses had an appointment the children of israel had an appointment nothing could break that it had to be at that 80-year mark of moses's life because god said god had a number of years and and we know that once once moses went back underneath the ownership once moses went back after he after he had had his experience on holy ground then god brought deliverance if we look in the book of joshua chapter 5 we'll see here another example if you go and you look and you search in the bible and uh i i i depended upon just a bible application on my computer and i searched it there's only two times where it says take off your shoes you're standing on holy ground with joshua and moses joshua chapter 5. but you know what we can look through the word and see that the the the priest was had to walk into that holy ground a certain way so this isn't the only two scriptures but in the context of taking off your shoes and it was interesting if you think about moses had to take his shoes off to step in onto the holy ground to talk to christ and when john the baptist is baptizing jesus he says i am not worthy to unbuckle his shoes that one's just there for you to chew on mo uh joshua chapter 5 13. and it came to pass when joshua was joshua was by jericho now joshua and the children of israel are eating the old corn of the land manna has ceased to fall from heaven and now they're eating the sustenance of the promise see manna was a a manna was food to get them to the promise manna was the temporary food but it was not the food of the promise it was a shadow but once they crossed into the new land they began to eat the old corn in other words the word restored we know that today we're in the old corner because it's the word of god restored back and it came to pass when joshua was by jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword so now joshua for some reason i always picture it this way the children of israel are back at camp rejoicing enjoying the delicious food i heard tell manna wasn't very good tasting it was it provided sustenance but uh the open word just it just gives you a lot more and uh so you know they're out there rejoicing having a big old feast and i i just always picture it this way so this is this is completely my opinion and joshua kind of walks away from the party and he he goes down walks a mile or two down down to look over at jericho the quiet of the evening and night that night and he and he's looking and he's thinking lord i don't know what we're going to do we're in the land of promise this is the first obstacle but as yet all joshua knew was god said i will give you the land but god hadn't said how joshua's a man of war he wants a plan he needs a plan laid out a plan of attack how many soldiers are going to go here how many what artillery are we going to use are we going to sneak attack are we going to are we going to do a siege what are we going to do to take on jericho so joshua is standing there formulating his a plan and his mind but you see before he can even come even come to a decision on how to attack he looks up and he sees this man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as captain of the host of the lord am i now come and joshua fell on his face excuse me face to the earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my lord unto his servant and the captain of the lord's host said unto joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place were on thou standest is holy and joshua did so joshua says what's the plan lord the lord says hang on a second take off your shoes we get in a hurry god's on a hurry he knows everything and if you're going to read and then he tell he gives him specific instructions on how to take jericho but you see joshua was standing on holy ground joshua had an appointment with destiny and it happened on holy ground now in this in the same context of this of the scripture of the story of jericho there we bring up another character and i bring this character up often but you see i was thinking about it the word of god is alive and and every time you look at it through the lens of a situation through the lens of an of a different anointing all the same all the anointing of christ but a different situation circumstances that you're looking in a thought that you have in your heart you see things a little bit differently and but it's all the same true word of god so we have the character rahab now we want to talk about the children of israel we say oh they they wandered in the desert for 40 years and they made a mistake and they did they didn't take the word of god bc but everything that god does he has a program and everything is going according to his program the fall in the garden of eden was according to his program god doesn't lose time for one he can he's eternal but god doesn't go oops i have to put things on pause no no god's program is perfect now i want to read this in in um the story of rahab sometimes you'll find a quote and it's and it's maybe a few paragraphs long but brother branham had a way of telling a story and this is in um why little bethlehem and and we find out that it was also also became the home of the harlot rahab talking about bethlehem when israel had passed over the borderline of the jordan river into palestine we are acquainted with the story of rahab the harlot let's picture her this morning for a few minutes now as a young lady a beautiful young woman now here's where i'm going to take liberty a beautiful young woman let me ask you 40 years ago was rahab in position for her appointment with destiny no so when the children of israel came to the river jordan to cross over now you think you messed up your life i'm going to tell you something when they came up to the river jordan to cross over god said no no no rahab's not ready you see what god does god's program is perfect you say oh the children made a mistake and they did everyone answers for the decision that they make but rahab wasn't ready for her appointment with destiny but says a young a beautiful woman who's whose some misfortune in life had been forced in being a pagan had been forced into the life that she was living yes she was forced by god's program because god said i want a gentile a woman and i want her to be a harlot so no one has any questions in their mind of how far can i go to save somebody that i have called the day and age that we live in we have a lot of harlots there's it's just something unfortunately kids do in high school and younger sometimes in the world that we're living in but god said look i can take this and make her my bride showing the power of the blood of christ you see rahab was not ready for her appointment with destiny now i was listening to adoption number two and brotherhood said this and i just i rejoiced because i began to realize because i always stumbled at the scripture god god jacob have i love esau have i hated and i thought well esau never even got a chance but in this quote god revealed this to me he says and now i want to stop on that word of predestination now predestinated isn't say i'll choose brother neville and i won't choose brother bueller that isn't it it's the foreknowledge of god that knowed which one would be right and which one wasn't right in other words god knew esau would not choose the birthright esau didn't choose the birth let me lord help me say this now esau didn't not did not choose the birthright praise the lord esau did not choose the birthright because god said esau i hated esau choose the birth didn't choose the birthright because he didn't want it and god saw that when god was predestination predestinating there was a time in heaven where god laid out the books and began to write down the names and when he got to esau he looked ahead and he said no he won't he won't even choose the birthright so he was given a chance but god saw he won't choose it so he wasn't predestinated so it wasn't that god said i think we got that so by foreign knowledge god knowing what he was going to do he predestinated by his foreknowledge to make all things work together for the good to them that love god that he might in the age that is to come call all things together in one which is christ jesus remember election looks to foreknowledge foreign knowledge looks to predestination predestination looks to destiny jacob had an appointment with destiny do you realize you can take this idea this thought down through every person in the bible down through every person in history amen everyone has an appointment with destiny and the world wants to take destiny and they want to construe it all around and say oh just live any old life you want well that's a perversion of what is the truth so rahab was a young woman a young lady and it was it was time for her appointment with destiny and many times people are forced into the life that they live now i'm back in the rahab quote paragraph 50. i was in the prisons the other night to see a man who was taking a sentence so he talked about a man kind of forced into it by drinking different things uh 51 and this young woman after she had got her first hearing of israel of a god who was a god that answered prayer not only a god to pray to but a god that answered back you see free moral agency god knew when rahab heard the words of israel she would believe so he predestinated her and he set an appointment in the books of time that rahab would come to meet her destiny on holy ground he said holy grail excuse me she was uh the the the the spies were in the house of a harlot how can that be holy ground wherever you go as a child of god you are on holy ground now unless you walk out from underneath the blood and go into a bar but you have possession of the atmosphere around you when you are harnessed to the will of christ it was that atmosphere set in place that rahab experienced and and and so it goes on to say here he says but a god not only a god to pray to but a god that answered back she was looking for a god that answered back not not an idol where it just sits there dumb when she heard that there was a god of miracles who could perform miracles who dried up the seas and rained bread out of the heavens her heart began to tremble not in not not in the tremble of i'm afraid for my life but in a fear that this is god see the rest of the world was looking for a way to escape israel but rehab was looking for a way to get into israel and her heart began to triple and she got the first message from two preachers that went over there quickly she accepted it with all her heart that debunks the tape thing and there was a scarlet cord abound at her window for a protection of her house because that she had received the message where do you think she got that scarlet material and what do you think it was used for god will take the the the addiction in your life the the struggle in your life and brother man says well take that and turn it into your testimony for others to experience so god took her bondage and used that to represent his token the power of god to deliver amen praise the lord and so uh that and so he says and i might add here did you know that she typed the gentile church she was a gentile she was a type of the gentile church when they heard the message we were all out in spiritual prostitution committing spiritual fornications against the god of heaven and all kinds of stuff all kinds of denominations and religions you see another thing another reason rahab had to be a harlot was because god's showing that today he would call people out of denomination call people out of the daughter of the of the daughters of the that committing spiritual fornication and make them virgins we were all out in spiritual prostitution committing spiritual fornications against the god of heaven and all kinds of stuff all kinds of denominations and religions but when we heard that there was a god that still lived that could perform miracles quickly we received the message there was there was applied the blood of the lord jesus which made the scarlet cord and to keep from going into detail you know how she hung it from her window publicly the blood was displayed publicly that's the way the blood has got to be displayed hanging on the outside to show there's something taking place inside amen praise the lord and paragraph 55 and then when she and then we see her when she was taken in as one of the israelites she fell in love with the man who was a captain and a prince of judah he was the captain of the israelite armies his name was salmon and we know the rest of the story there that god took her and and and and and gave her to the prince which with brother brown says well anyways uh you can go you can go listen to that tape while bethlehem so rahab had an appointment with destiny just just to back up and just go over this again real quick so when the children of israel got to the river jordan rahab was not ready so now what can god do in history what can god do with time what can god do with your life to make sure you're ready for your appointment now we can have multiple appointments yes it doesn't stop until we graduate into glory we have appointments after appointments you wrestle with something maybe you need revelation of a scripture or or something in the message you don't quite see i'm telling you tonight and i'm telling to myself there's an appointment with destiny there's a time when god will say you'll turn to the to the to open your book and you'll open psalms 23 and you'll read verse 4 and you'll understand revelations whatever 18 2. i don't know if those are connected i'm just making this up right well they are connected because it's all over god you see it doesn't matter god god god god's not worried about the material things we say oh we need this in place it has to be done this way god that's not god's not worried about that god's not worried about that it's wednesday night it's his word and his word brings life christ knew that rahab would accept his invitation as a child of god with his seed within you there is nothing you can do to stop your appointment that could be your appointment to receive the holy spirit and become into the kingdom of god i could you be your appointment of healing it could be your appointment of deliverance it could be your appointment of of revelation of the god's word a revelation of a scripture it could be anything but there's nothing that can keep you from that not this is what i really want to drive home tonight is not even you can stop the program of god stop the program of god in your life you can't do it no matter how many times you stumble and you fall as long as you're a child of god which i believe every one of you is you can do nothing to stop it you can't look at your present circumstances and say no i've done messed it all up i've tried it and over and over and over again and this thing and the other and you well maybe you gotta no i'm not gonna say that you can't stop it god has an appointment and god always keeps his appointments your day is coming how long did gideon hold out within his bondage before his appointment with destiny how long did gideon hide behind the wine press and and to thresh the wheat and to provide food to eat how long did he sit there and do that before his appointment with destiny but you see gideon was there when the appointment came gideon a mighty man of valor who was living in a state of weakness still in his if you want to say mistake by hiding he met his appointment right on time how long did shamgar beat himself down for being weak in faith before his appointment with destiny how many seasons passed where shamgar said i should have done something i'm an israelite why didn't i do something why didn't i take up and defend my family i love them i would i would give my life for them why did i not do anything shamgar beating himself down saying he's weak in faith how long did that happen before shamgar's appointment with destiny and do you read about that time no yeah in the annals of history in the book of god's history you know what you're going to read at the end of time you're not going to read how you fell you're not going to read how you messed up you're going to read and shamgar by faith to canoxico sean by faith took an oxco brother david by faith took an ox kill that's all you're going to read because the rest has been wiped out by the blood of jesus christ did samson fail his calling go ahead no he didn't he was called to give his life between those pillars in doing so slew more in his death than he did in his entire life samson had an appointment with destiny and the only way to get there was to fall in the lap of delilah have his eyes pulled out from him set in the chains of bondage of the enemy and then brought up to sport for the enemy then he was ready for his appointment with destiny saints of god you cannot do anything to miss that appointment christ sees a desire in your heart he testifies you look at somebody from the outside and you say how can they be so callous you do not know what's going on inside their heart and you do not know when their appointment with destiny is going to happen the only thing you know is that it will happen on holy ground that's all you know so why don't you condition yourself to be ready to receive them when they walk out of the cave having talked face to face with the burning bush that's what we need to be god's dealing with harder situation and i begin to think we need to be prepared for when god brings them into deliverance because how dare we face their deliverance and have to swallow our anger we want to be ready to say we know what was coming praise god we want to be in a position of forgiveness before they're even worthy of it because they have an appointment with destiny and your bitterness cannot keep you from that i heard a story this could have been from our pastor there was a man and a woman in a message church they married i don't know if they had kids i'm not quite sure i don't think they did and she turned her back on the message and she left her husband and he prayed for years that she would come back and she he believed she would come back well she goes out into the world and she marries a worldly man sometime goes by they get a couch from her parents who are message believers and her worldly husband who's never heard of the message he lays down on the couch one afternoon to take a nap and sticks his arm in between the cushions and pulls out a sermon you talk about an appointment with destiny and he starts to read that and then he asks his wife well what is this and says oh you don't know part of that and he says no i want more of these so he gets more books from her parents and he reads it long story short they both end up back in the same church she left sanctified and filled with the holy spirit serving god and there's that man her own her first husband sitting there and he takes them to the office and he tells the pastor you need to command them to separate because i prayed for my wife she's back and she's living in adultery and the pastor you know i believe on the anointing of the spirit of god in wisdom says but two wrongs don't make it right something to that effect and that man standing before his answered prayer storms out of the church i don't know where he is today i don't know the rest of the story but i do know that that couple is still serving god so what is it what why did i tell that story because god sometimes answers our prayer differently than we think he should but we want to be prepared in our hearts to receive it regardless of how it might be different than we thought it would be amen but in in that in doing that you can't mess it up still because if you are destined to receive that you will amen but i don't want to i don't want to i you know i just felt checked there i don't wanna take i don't wanna take any of your responsibility away because you have responsibility yeah it was rehab had to put that cord out the window yes you have a responsibility to turn your back on sin you have your responsibility to stand and do what god calls you to do to rid yourself of that sin so take your shoes of pride off no matter how fancy they are gucci don't save you the key is to keep standing on holy ground living under the blood standing in god's presence doesn't have to be in church it's just when you are keeping yourself sanctified and lined up with the word of god and in fellowship with christ you keep standing there and now you say well i'm standing here but i'm in the midst of the fiery furnace the world is burning down all around me excuse me show us the father and it suffices our picture looks pretty dark right now for believers doesn't it let's just turn our camera or our binoculars and look up you know all the time there's something going on on earth there's something going on in heaven i can see him let's look at him a moment i could see him sitting on his throne oh my his priestly robes all around him i can see coming to his right a noise what is it let's call it gabriel the great archangel run up to the side of him pull this sword said master have you looked down in babylon three true believers are meeting their end have you beheld them i have obeyed you all since you created me let me go down i'll change the scene just in a few moments i believe he could don't you yes i believe he could the big sword pulled and david seen him with it joshua seen him when he crossed the river said i am the captain of the host of the lord i've seen that sword drawn said lord let me go down master i can hear him say gabriel you've been a good angel since the day i created you you have obeyed me but i just can't let you go all the while this is unfolding in heaven there is children of israel standing before the king then then now now the king's giving his decree the furnace has been cranked up hotter now they're stepping and they're walking and god's still having this conversation you say well if you were watching this scene unfold and you could see both sides of the equation be seeing hey hurry up hurry up god's sitting there in his glory and his and his sovereignty gabriel you've been a good angel since the day i created you you have obeyed me but i just can't let you go i can see gabriel put his sword back into the sheath take stand attention to his side oh my everything in heaven obeyed him that's right all but the heart of men they don't want to obey him they don't want to believe him look coming to the to the left here comes another angel look at him god has ministering spirits angels i believe on this one right here now not far and he stood what is his name wormwood bitter waters i can hear him say oh master have you looked out in babylon let me go down there this morning you gave me the keys in the anteluvian destruction i poured the waters over the earth you know one moon has controls of all the waters of the earth the bible says and there he says i'll go down and walk i'll wash babylon off the face of the earth i believe he could have done it don't you he said master look down there i can hear him say wormwood you have been a good angel you did obey me and break up the springs of the deep and so forth and destroyed the world in the days of noah but i just can't let you go i can see you he says woodward but maybe i have it wrong taking his place again in standard attention have you considered another angel said all the while the steps of the children of israel the three hebrew children are getting closer and closer they're about a couple of steps away from the fiery furnace as the conversation continues he said yes i've been watching them all night long oh brother if he was con he was considered about three he's considered about three thousand here tonight too his eye is on the sparrow another the children of israel have stepped into the fiery furnace you're watching both scenes unfolding you're saying hurry up hurry up god you're going to be late his eye is on the spiral he knows right where right now what you have need of he knows why you come to this meeting i can hear him say i can't let you go you fellows because i'm going myself as they step into the fire furnace god says i'm going myself now nebuchadnezzar or whoever it was looks in the furnace he says how many men did we throw in there i can see him rise you think i'm crazy don't you you're going to call me holy roller anyhow so you might as well go do it notice i love him i owe my my all my life wrapped in him i see nothing but him i can see him rise from his throne his garments drop around him gets out there and way back over in the north country i see a big thunder head i can hear him say come here oh my i can hear him say east wind west north south come here everything minds him that's right i can hear him say go over there and get under that thunder head and roll it over here here comes the east north south and west winds go under the big thunder head and here it comes churning up at the side of the throne i can see him step step off on that oh my say winds i'm going to drive you like horses this morning i'm going down into babylon you think that stop there saints of god he is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and as you step into the fiery furnace in whatever situation you are talking about you are faced with what you're going into god is up there saying i'm going down into babylon where do we live today babylon the world is great darkness people say you can't live a life for christ you can't be perfect and god says i'm going down to babylon no matter what you're facing i can see him reach up and get a hold of a zigzag lightning with his hands you see zeus ain't got nothing on christ pass by the tree of life and pick off a branch they made their last step thrust trusting god's word and about the time they stepped in there was one like the son of man standing by their side with a palm fanning away even with hot breezes down talking with them fellowshipping with them saying you see what god does after a great battle he begins to have fellowship abraham faced the kings and he fought a great battle and he turned aside the desire and the lust for the spoils of of that battle and he walked back into the desert and then he had fellowship with god god gives you a great battle so kingdom he can open the doors he says how many did you put in said three there's four one looks like the son of god all creation will testify every knee will bow nebuchadnezzar in his state of hedonism stood and testified that is the son of god as christ died on the cross that that centurion looked up and said this is the son of god he's the same yesterday today and forever his powers cannot fail he cannot god is in his son yes he believed that god is in his people god is here tonight if he could say god is here tonight in 19 august 19th 1950 i can say today god is here tonight no matter what it is you're facing no matter if you're walking in the fiery furnace if the door is creaking open and the men around you have died from the heat and you're stepping in don't worry god's coming down into babylon he's taking the molecules god can bend atoms to his will because he created them everything was designed with one no matter what it was that god created the human body the elements of the atmosphere no matter what it was he created that everything has one baseline the answer to him your bones answer to god your body answers to god your your blood answers to god your brain no matter what it is answers to god it has to obey when god's word speaks now in closing i'm closing here in a minute i just want to bring this in if you go in joshua you read the story of akin aiken got in a hurry he saw the spoils of the world and he thought wow i could do so much for the kingdom of god with that stuff he got into his own head and he took the spoils of babylon excuse me the spoils of jericho which is also let me know babylon but if you continue to read the story you read of the men that died and ai when they went to battle because israel had a great sin and so they they called the lots and aikens called and his family everything is destroyed but keep reading god brought deliverance to israel akin got in a hurry the very next battle god says take it all you see god will test you he'll give you jericho oh you'll have a revival the walls will come down they'll be shouting and they'll be victory but there's still no money to pay the bills god puts something out an opportun something is presented god allows the devil to tempt you something is presented don't be aching turn your back on the spoils of jericho and then watch god watch god come and give you the spoils of ai everything you wanted given right there this is not a prosperity gospel this is a testimony what happens when you stand on holy ground and god keeps his appointment and you meet your appointment with destiny god brings down total deliverance keep on reading joshua then takes the book and reads it cover to cover every last bit you see after a great battle after a great hardship musicians want to come tonight israel had gone through this situation their own brother had committed fraud upon them they lost 36 men they're facing this difficulty they're facing their first defeat but then let's push aside aiken because we're not aching by the grace of god we are his children we've stepped through the battle now god's going to give you victory or god already has and i want you to take this tonight in your heart with bow our heads tonight i want you to take the night take this in your heart tonight [Music] every promise in the book is yours all the spoils of the enemy are yours you see all of that stuff was just a perversion of the right thing [Music] god has brought you through a great battle and now you are facing your victory or god is going to bring you through a great battle and you will face your victory your appointment with destiny thank you god when you reach that point and all ai is destroyed go and claim every last promise as being yours regardless of what it is regardless of how lofty it might seem we're the ones who put limits on god god is a limitless god but we in our finite in our flesh we put a cap on god but we have no authority to do so god can't god's program cannot be hindered you have an appointment with destiny heavenly father lord jesus i pray tonight lord that you would energize the faith of your people perhaps they've come through an episode with aiken a battle with a religious spirit they faced false doctrine toe-to-toe they're weak in body but god may you give them strength to fight against ai lord and may they look past the present circumstances look past the walls of the city and look to all the promises that you have in store for them god we know that none of this can be attained except that we stand on holy ground our appointment happens on holy ground lord i am i thank you for your word i thank you lord jesus oh thank you jesus father we have situations in our body i am not a visiting minister i live here i go to this church we have sicknesses in our body spirits of aiken trying to infiltrate the rings but god we serve you and we know your spirit is more powerful than anything the devil can conjure up the father feeling anointed to do so i claim our victory over that spirit of religion we are not called to live underneath a man's idea we are called to live underneath the anointing and the revelation of who you are to us so in the name of jesus christ i call for deliverance lord that that spirit would not come inside this church lord a spirit would not infiltrate the hearts of the people here tonight but we would find true freedom in your word father we cannot find freedom and we cannot find deliverance we cannot find these things outside of your word and lord aiken is outside of your word father i didn't expect it to turn this direction but god i pray lord jesus that you would just bring that touch father lord if no matter where it comes the devil will try to sneak in the corner and come in the crack and hide it underneath the ground may you just expose him 100 percent father that we as a people we as the people of grace tabernacle could stand under the word and maintain our position [Music] and in doing so lord maintain our freedom not by our own works although our works are required but god by your spirit we're the spirit of the lord there is freedom may there be so much spirit of god in our hearts if there'd be so much anointing in this church that that religious spirit could find no room to sit down thank you lord jesus thank you lord jesus [Music] that there are angers on let us [Music] jesus [Music] in his presence of course we are standing on holy ground [Music] and i know that there are angels all around [Music] us praise [Music] jesus [Music] you know how do you find a religious spirit what did joshua do he went to prayer brother says you can never pray too much prayer keeps you close to god prayer keeps that spirit of christ moving within your life then there's no room for anything else amen praise the lord let's sing it again we are standing unholy i always stand tonight lift your hands and praise him you know you can praise him before you've seen the victory because you already have oh we are standing on holy ground and i know that there are angels all [Music] around us [Music] we are standing [Music] oh i am standing [Music] it personal on holy ground [Music] and i know that there are angels [Music] i will pray jesus now for i am standing in his presence [Music] you sing i surrender all just a couple of verses standing on holy ground but you gotta take off your shoes and surrender all to

father lord jesus truly our hearts desires to be fully surrendered to you like that last verse lord that sacred flame or there's one thing about the old testament lord they could never sacrifice without fire lord we lay ourselves down at your feet father that you lord may kindle that flame within us lord jesus that holy spirit lord father you made that transition lord the day of pentecost let us know the fire is still needed and those tongues of fire fell upon those in the upper room even though that same holy spirit is alive and well today living in within us lord jesus father i pray for those whose flame has died down a little that you would provoke them to put fire wood on the fire lord that they would not let that go out because how can we see the walk father unless that fire is alive [Music] lord we know that your word is a promise you've given to us lord jesus and there will be a wise virgin ready we want to count ourselves in that number lord jesus father may you go with
