you must fight be brave [Music] far in life [Music] [Music] [Music] amen amen it's a human instinct to duck on the firing line amen hallelujah we just want to remember just as i was thinking after brother jason had come out there's you know many that are not here tonight whether the brother vasily or the sergey out on the road or the bob sister joanne at home and others that would be at home our daughter joe lynn didn't go to work today under the weather and you know just little normal winter sniffles and whatever amen is that or it's the second round of coven um but um we're not worried about that either right hallelujah amen so we just thank the lord for his grace and his mercy and his guiding hand tonight i want to uh just speak to you under the title something good is happening and uh i just pray you know i just kind of have went back through different things we've spoke on in the last few months and things a little inspiration to my heart uh just to look at this and so if it seems like some of these things are you know brother paul's just on the same vein he maybe was three months ago well i think they call it a recap amen we're coming down to the year of 2020. and um you know 2020 my brother and sister the whole world is telling us how terrible the year 2020 was that was all a matter of your perspective see you can look at that and say you know what we are a year closer to the marriage supper of the lamb we're a year closer today we get to stand before the throne of almighty god and worship him beyond what would be human endurance have you ever thought about that worship god there's no clock your body's not going to go my i need to set down i am tired i had a hard day today no we're a day closer a year closer to just standing there on that sea of crystal before the throne of god and just pouring our hearts out and saying thank you lord amen you know the song i think the lafontaine sing that one are you she my brother and sister i don't think that we as humans will comprehend what it is not of what we have done but what he used us for when you think of talents and the ones that were given talents and what they did with them and one was given talent i want you to take talent now not in the terms of a weight of silver or gold but i want you to take it in the term of talent amen what god give you for ability you see they were those who took their talent and brought back those offerings to god and one said i don't have enough talent now i might be talking to those that never sing a special but i might not be either you see our talent might not be to sing but it might be a talent just simply to live the liberty of this gospel your talent might be that you just wholeheartedly grabble holds of the word of god and your life then expresses a great testimony to man that you're a real christian amen let's not bring our talent back to him though that's right and say i was afraid to do anything amen i was afraid to step out i was afraid to i thought my you know unless they you you know saints i say this in a bit of humor brother jay kind of chides me every once in a while on this but you know what i don't care what the song is i can convert it to f and you guys laugh and i i have no problem with that but you see you say c or d or whatever and i don't have a clue what you're talking about so i have to make a decision am i going to sing or because i don't know what d is i'm going to be silent no sir my talent i say this humorously my talent is convert every song to f and i don't know what f is but it's where i it's what i can sing it's what my my ability takes me to and see we have to decide i hope you see where i'm going you have to decide well i i can't do this as well as they do i can't do this as well as they do i i'm gonna do it the talent god give me was to say amen to the word to pull that word in and feed on it and and so i don't do it as well as this one or do it as well as that one or look as good you know reminds me one time it was kind of a a um not an insult it was never meant that way but it did strike pretty hard you know we were visiting a church once and there was two brothers there that had the exact they were actually a a combo that was like at macy's you know the shirt came with the tie and on a sunday morning here is two brothers standing there with the exact same shirt and the exact same tie and uh the one sister i think she had just a little bit of something in her and she looks over her husband and says it doesn't look as good on you as it does on him but you see it it's not an earthly comparison that we're looking for we're not trying to be measured against this one or measured against that one we want to be measured against the word of god and let the word shine through and let the word reflect in us what god desired to reflect something good is happening let's just stand and go into the word let's just make sure that we lift up one another um and the day that we're living in my brother and sister there's just the devil is absolutely out roaring and um some of the things that uh you look at you hear you study you're just like someone with good sense how could they even possibly think those thoughts how can they come to that conclusion and then we're reminded that the word says he would give us a sound mind so that means someone has to have an unsound mind we're not dinging on anybody we're not doing this my brother and sister let's just look at the natural sister sue not here tonight just remember her brother in prayer a long history goes there but got his medical license revoked in the state of oregon because he stood up and said you don't need a mask it won't work and they just make an example out of him sound mind no i'm sorry you read testimony after testimony people i washed my hands 15 times a day i wore a mask never walked out of my house my husband worked from home and uh we never did this i wore my mask in the car i wore it everywhere i went and i did everything and our family has coven well let me tell you i did drywall brother adam and i had this conversation you just put one of those cheap masks on your face and go sand drywall take the mask off amen i'm sure brother gideon can testify of these things your face will be white and that's just drywall dust amen you see sound mind but you see it's fear rip them not a sound mind a sound mind they'd stand up and say you know what we're just gonna stand with confidence this will work but no fear has overcome them and my brother and sister the fear that you were seeing natural the prophet of god told us there's always a spiritual attribute with it let's turn in our bibles tonight to hebrews 11 and 38. brother alex did you get the church whatsapp i sent that has a little video on it would you look at your phone i'm just going to ask you if there's any possible way that you can send that to our deal and after some point here projected on the screen i know we've done it before but i wouldn't have a clue how but uh hebrews 11 38 through 40 very common scripture to us saints amen of whom the world was not worthy that statement is still applicable they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect heavenly father we ask you lord for blessings upon your word tonight father just ask you to lead us guide us let us speak only according to thy word lord may the full effect lord of your word move amongst your saints tonight lord i i believe sometimes uh not even sometimes lord i believe most of the time we miss the full effect of your word oh lord help us to be open lord in receiving of you lord the spirits have already been bound we'll stand upon that confession of our brother david lord that you'll come and move with liberty tonight in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated you know as we look at this scripture we have read it uh my so so many times we've preached on it and uh we look at this and realize uh the very depth of this word i i believe my brother and sister has still missed we have missed just a little bit of that and uh as we look at this i i read and you no doubt read of the saints of the ages and when i read of it i'm always in awe because you you read these as it were we'll call them stories uh and and you see what the saints are what they went through uh and what god used them to accomplish and it is tremendous and when we look at that my brother and sister it's easy for us to actually look back and say my look what they did but you see what we need to do is be looking right now because the word shows us and our lord jesus spoke these words out that said we would do greater things than that now we're not looking as it is to have a checklist of we did this we did this we did this it's talking about our day-to-day life amen and there will be my brother and sister such a joy such a pleasure that it is to be sons and daughters of god not that we have accomplished or we have obtained as the apostle paul said not as though we have obtained it but yet we are here knowing with confidence we are a part of it amen it's not as though we must uh say you know brother david did this now i need to you know they call it one upmanship right now you know we do these kind of things oh my i caught this fish and and it we can't help it and be totally honest you know it's a real thing it's not a fish story you know like i was up there and i caught this fish and and you know you you just can't help yourself it's like i caught a bigger one it's just a human element but see we're not here to look back on the saints of old and say you know what we're going to do greater things as brother branham encourager shows us it would be more things we're not here to keep a score and and to place ourselves in a position see we're doing this but to just live naturally and have a joy of our salvation and a thrill to to be sons and daughters of god and i think sometimes you know as the scripture says to not be weary and well doing satan knows that's why the word reminded us to to not become weary because satan knows he can just keep grinding and grinding and grinding and we come to a place that the labors of life overwhelm us and we find ourselves and now i'm not chiding you tonight church i'm just speaking that we would come to church and there's not an enthusiasm in there because the laborers of the day i'm so guilty i'll lift my hands amen i'm so guilty but we must come to a place that the things of this life do not control us amen we'll kind of touch on this now i want to share a little video amen that that was shared with me uh by some brothers amen this is in zimbabwe and you know it's uh just an amazing thing my brother and sister to see a real joy you know what this joy is about they receive some bibles amen they had a whole shipment a whole a pallet as it were of bibles that was given and come into their area of zimbabwe and was given to them now if brother alex will just click on that i just want you to see what some joy of having a bible is [Music] i want to bottle that and bring it home better yet i want to find my quiet place and have that joy of my salvation renewed to where just to lay our hands in this same region a brother will leave it unnamed but a brother is doing a work there they've shipped pallets hundreds hundreds and hundreds of church age books in their languages have been delivered to them placed in their hands and the enthusiasm and the joy that these believers are expressing my brother and sister i think we ought to stop and reevaluate what our life is i'm preaching to myself okay so you can't be offended because paul's talking to paul but we're worried about whether our shoes are are just right and our clothes are just right and you know whether hey you know i wore this dress uh two sundays ago and now i wore something else last sunday if i wear it this sunday will they notice we are not even care about such things amen hallelujah we could have a sister's only sermon on that oh come on sisters have a sense of humor come on remember brother branham said if you're a real believer you can't be offended but you see my brother and sister as we read of the saints of old there was a thrill there was an excitement as they were coming and the word was being presented to them and and they were becoming converts to christ we see something was happening that overwhelmed them and we see you know peter be an example as jesus speak to him and says you know before this time uh uh you know at the time that the crows you know you're going to have denied me and peter never thought that was possible but he was there in that time and as that young maid says now i i perceive by your clothing your words and everything you know you've been seen with them you're this and he denies it and the crows and peter is stricken in his heart so he quit church and moved to a backside of a desert and no that was something inside of him something so great that even his own betrayal was not sufficient to get him to stop now when i use that word betrayal you understand in what context i bring that but you see even facing himself in that bitter moment knowing that exactly what our lord jesus had spoken to him had come to pass against every bit of his will but behind those words the power of our lord jesus giving the keys to peter overrode peter's flesh that ought to be enough for us to say thank you lord the promise of the word overrode the weakness of the flesh and peter rose up after many bitter tears and went right back to fulfill the very commission or talent that he was given i think in awe of what they experienced can you imagine as it were to be a bystander when jesus told them to push their boat out and cast the net off the other side to be the bystander that knew that the whole fleet as it were a fisherman were not finding fish the reason is the holy spirit went out and rounded them all up and put them in one part of the lake you know what i'm saying god said i'm going to hold them in reserve because i'm not going to just let it be they caught a few i'm going to have something happen here that will bring a maze to the people and so the witnesses that saw that and he tells them push it out a little bit and cast your net on the other side and my brother and sister those fish under that anointing swam for that net they didn't have to drag the net around that boat was stationary and those fish swam to that under the anointing of what they had to fulfill and all nature will fulfill the word of god amen and so we see what is happening here this supernatural effect and we look back and say oh lord we would love to have something like that happen it is it is right happening it can happen in our house it can happen in our church we have to set the atmosphere for it but remember the holy spirit the prophet of god said is a dove he's a gentleman and we have to create an atmosphere that he says this is where i want to be amen we think of what they experience and how they became reference points for us have you ever used someone as an individual as a reference point i'll just tell this in the natural many years ago as i i started farming on my own i had more i don't know if it was courage just desire and ability to take a risk and it didn't take very long for me to realize there were farmers around me that were growing much better crops than me you've heard the phrase flattering amen copying someone is a highest form of flattery i wanted to succeed i wanted to survive so i started as it were looking over the fence what are they doing different than me and you know it wasn't great big things it didn't matter what color their tractor was or how new it was it was what they were doing not as it were what they were doing it with yes i heard a man say one time i so respect brother so and so he's just the most solid christian that i know i believe god ordained this i heard another brother says i don't know anyone who prays as much as this brother this one was looking up to the brother in awe because he was the most solid christian he knew but then the ingredient of how he was the most solid christian was revealed amen and so as you were there if we would have a form of flattery let us look to those that are the solid believer not the man find what they're doing because you see each and every one of us possesses the ability amen we possess the ability but we must let it come to pass they become reference points the believers these saints i say today lord let us become a reference point for someone else amen this is not boastful this is not us claiming some some position that's unattainable but lord just anoint us to live a life that becomes a reference point amen to the positive amen look at the sacrifices that we they made you look down through the scripture and and you just read and understand all of the sacrifice that was made by the saints through the ages they they just tremendous the scripture tells us they were sundered thrown in the flames and fed to the wild animals and they were starved and abandoned in the dungeons and all of these things that we just look at that and it's hard in our mind to comprehend what they went through think of the apostle paul how long he languished isn't this terrible he languished in prison for such an extended period of time except for we're thankful for his writings that took place in prison when there was no other distraction and nothing else to focus on but to have a prayer life and open up and receive from god and to pin it [Music] i think when we get there we'll need to go say thank you paul for your sacrifice and when it was done and god said this is finished they took him out and beheaded him doesn't seem like a worthy finish for a man who laid the gospels before us but when we get there he'll be shouting hallelujah just like the rest amen think about what they've done saints think about this sacrifice that was made and you know when you read that uh it's just so real hey man i hope it is that real to you that you just you you just don't you don't have to have a hollywood makeup of this just in your heart you see how real it was as believers they placed the words so firmly before them that there was nothing going to draw them to the right or to the left nothing could be offered in them to them amen it was so real i don't you know there was nothing could be offered to them that they would say i want to trade this experience for this here there was nothing there you see if it had been possible satan would have anointed them to be offered see even judas in his betrayal i was just reading those scriptures and how jesus i don't know if the modern church could handle jesus sitting across the table from us he looked right out here the one who's going to betray me is whose hand is on the table with me now i freeze time pause let's look down the table no hands no hands no hands hands no hands no hands no hands and they all the scripture says started to examine themselves in question is it i is it i but you see the word had already declared this symbolism as it were of who the betrayer was he's the one who's taking sop with me now and you look and i just i'm not trying to make a huge point but you look at this how simple it came down that pause whose hand was on the table dipping their bread at that moment and jesus spoke that out so blunt that anyone could see i wonder sometimes why didn't our lord jesus just say for all of you to know judas is the betrayer but you see he had to let the word be fulfilled it had to come about he had to let every detail of the revelation come forth and here we are today my brother and sister and not to go back and dig into these things of of uh the seventh seal and uh some turmoil we've had here in the church but you know you read your bible and it says these things have to be revealed these things must be manifest we can't skirt that we can't step beyond that we can't push it off in the future it's god who's in control of that amen and we have to let those things come so that they will be played out according to the script that god has written aren't you glad tonight because you see we've been identified in that script amen we don't have to go on as it might be for years now wondering wondering wondering wondering amen we can stand tonight and say i'm so glad i'm one of them because that revelation of that word has come forth what is it doing it's bringing forth this bride who is a viable and and i cut this out i didn't bring it forth tonight uh we will lord willing here soon but my brother and sister i'll just give you a glimpse of this when brother branham's talking about every seed about mankind being brought forth after the image of god brother branham says they're a seed of the word amen oh think about that it's you we know this it's a you might say a kind of recap hallelujah but you see when we recognize you're a seed of the word but the word's got to be planted see god don't circumvent that god doesn't circumvent that amen that seed has to be planted that seed has to be water that seed has to have sunlight that seed has to have revelation that seed has to be placed in an atmosphere and god said you know nope i'm not going to take you fast forward from here to there even the 11th hour worker people are like well god gave advantage to 11th hour worker no my brother and sister i'll tell you what the 11th hour worker had he had the example or the reference point are you with me they hear the word brother role soriano just shared a text a whole church there in the philippines been witnessing to the ministry in the church the pastor of the church and that pastor received the message of the hour and it would be if i understood the text correctly this coming sunday they're baptizing all of the ministry in that church and the whole church has received the lord jesus christ now my brother and sister this is a late hour no doubt god could have called them in many years ago but i'll tell you what you'll do you'll find that they will mature so quickly they will mature so quickly according to the word the 11th hour worker but you know why they can mature so quickly oh because there's more word they were ordained no god uses patterns my brother and sister it's because they now have reference points that they can look and when they have a question they can say brother we don't understand this and brother from experience many hours of prayer praying for revelation can now come not in an intellectual way but come and open the word to them and what would took many years for to come to pass for you and i they will grasp it i say thank you lord amen it's not a shortcut my brother and sister god did not give them a shortcut they must repent they must be filled with the holy ghost they must pray for revelation they must lay hold on the word feed on the word but they will because they're part of the plan of god oh my thank you lord so look at this we recognize that just without a doubt they would not exchange that for another experience and i would say tonight i believe with all my heart and i trust that tonight this word of god our lord jesus christ is so real to us that there would be nothing here that we would exchange it for nothing on this this earth here that we would exchange that experience for now i'm telling you my brother and sister we've seen we've seen people with talents and i'm not speaking against people with talents but we've seen people with talents and i'll i'll take it back out of the present tense message and take it back into what brother branham said and look the list go through the message look at the list of those people that brother branham said now that gift that he had was from god but he sold it out for a fleet of cadillacs they had a gift but they sold it out for popularity hallelujah well i got something i want to sell out to but this world can't supply it amazon don't got it walmart don't got it it's not even on back order because they don't know nothing about it amen hallelujah now look at this in the message forsaking all now i've cherry picked this out so i encourage you once again to catch the full context but i believe these words just grasp the essence of what we're trying to communicate what did they leave talking about coming out of egypt what did they leave they left the hot sun under the task master down in egypt what did they get for leaving that warm sunshine down there they got to walk in the pillar of fire's light leaving that hot sun down there to walk in the light of god's pillar of fire what an exchange now it breaks our heart because we have the whole picture of the word right to realize that the elders died in the wilderness i've spoke this many times and and i i believe it's true but i don't want to speak it as doctrine because that wouldn't be fair but i believe brother trevor with all of my heart if just one of them would have been able to grasp that revelation and you had a rough day and you come and you heard joshua preach and you heard caleb preach and you were just thrashed out and you're discouraged because there's a lot of discouragement in the camp wait there's a lot of discouragement in the message right now so maybe our camp has some discouragement now i'm trying to break my habit now all you think i pick on sister jerry you'll notice she moved closer but i say this in sincerity as joshua and caleb got up if there just had been one brother in the camp that said i'm discouraged i'm tired it just seems like this whole journey has not went like we thought it would but that was what god promised us when we were down in egypt joshua and caleb are telling us exactly what god promised they haven't taken away from it they haven't added to it that's what they said and if they could have brought themselves to the courage of saying amen then there would be just as the nature of mankind another brother another brother another brother would have said that's the truth that's the truth amen but you see satan had come in so subtly in that group of people they had got so down-hearted because you know if the lord would just give us a glimpse through history and we heard every word that moses had said there would be some words that they'd be able to say but that ain't the way moses said it before but you see they didn't catch the revelation of what moses was saying they were measuring words kind of like a teenage girl maybe her first love boyfriend or maybe it's the boy loves me loves me not loves me loves me loves me now where was i um loves me not loves me loves me not i'm confused well i want it to end on loves me so i gotta go backwards and figure this out and her friend will go you're wrong you're wrong it's supposed to be he loves you not forget the words i'll be kind in this little thought the little girl grows up marries the boy it was real love but how many times with that little daisy or whatever it is that they're doing there marigold or whatever come up with loves i'm sorry those words don't affect the heart moses said i'm so messed up i need somebody else to speak for me and god says you've got a brother use aaron we have a prophet saints this said things that now the critic has come and said he loves you not well i don't care what the critic says my word which is the bible says he loves me and it won't matter how many loves me not that i hear around the world he loves me it isn't how many mistakes we've made because i find it interesting and i'm just going to take a poke at this because there's a little something rumbling around but i'm going to take a poke of this i find it interesting that the critics who say brother branham made mistakes have themselves on the internet contradicted themselves i would like for them to just go back in their own words and say when i reach a stage that i never never contradict myself i'm going to become the world's greatest critic but you see they can't and they won't because it is the nature i've got a wife that works at keeping me from doing that i'll say well we were here doing this and this and she's like that ain't where that happen but some of them still get out say amen sisters come on you know i'm telling the truth we as people have memories and they're not perfect but you see when we start to look at what we're exchanging for we realize it's not how perfect i am or how perfect you are but it's how perfect he is there becomes the guiding light there becomes the foundation there becomes the place we place our confidence in my brothers and sisters i'm not placing it in any man i'm not placing it are you amen no we've went beyond that those days are behind us we're placing our confidence in jesus christ and the manifested word it's interesting that god chose to use men isn't it brother brown says oh what an exchange i'd like to take that exchange wouldn't you congregation says amen a pillar of fire walk in the natural sunlight where they was driving under task masters to come out there and walk in god's light under the power of the holy spirit a pillar of fire that was leading them to a promised land now don't read no more for a moment a very clear path right what was god's promise to them not moses promised come on let's get this right not moses promise moses was the mouth moses could not fulfill that word so god's promises them is you come out we will go through the wilderness and i will take you back to your land understand this is the land they were identified with as a people not the land in the middle not the land they come from but the identity my brother and sister is not laodicea not this world not anything of this our identity is beyond all of this and if we're not careful satan turns our identity to this here the size of the house the size of the bank account the kind of the car we got the clothes that we have all of this things that's where he turns our attention but you see the focus was never the wilderness of sin the focus was never all those cities of ammon and whatever that they traveled through and conquered whatever that was never the focus the folk was was back to the promised land and satan worked so hard to draw their vision from the promised land and pace it down here and the people said you know we need a little pick-me-up now i hate to make confessions but i i like to be transparent i've started drinking coffee it's horrible but praise the lord it tastes like a hershey's chocolate bar while i'm drinking it see the rest of you you miss something there you guys drink this bitter stuff that curls your eyelashes and whatever else when you could settle for something that tasted so good i can see you're all against me i'm probably voted out but i've decided to quit because it's hard on my testimony but you see my brother and sister when we start to look at what it is and what we are focused on and what it is that we're called to we recognize satan works so hard to come down and make and this is the reason i brought up coffee nothing against those of you that drink coffee that's your your right yeah relax but you see i had someone recently tell me paul you don't drink coffee and i said that's right and i proved it when sister jerry and i and thank you church for your gift that uh you know sent sister jerry and i off on a little weekend we pulled up the little coffee shack in cascade sister jerry ordered her whatever it was and i looked at the lady she says do you want something sir and i said well uh i do um i want a hot chocolate with some caffeine in it and she says i know exactly what you need you see i don't want your original when it comes to coffee i'm good with the distraction and satan's good with the distraction he makes this distraction better tasting than the original and so i use coffee because it just is a nice analogy pretty soon you look over and there's cream there's sugar there's chocolate there's well anyway pumpkin right i gotta make sure i preach at all of you so nobody thinks i'm picking on you but you see how satan makes the so so desirable so here they were walking god's light on the power of the holy spirit a purif pillar of fire that was leading them to a promised land now we know all that happened along the route to the promised land don't we moses gets frustrated at the people he must have been a tad bit frustrated with god and he strikes the rock again and now we see how that brought about a representation of the smiting of our lord jesus christ it's all tied right into scripture but you see by the spoken word moses could have walked there stood upon the word that he was given and not let the frustrations of the people now i say this but i personally have experienced i know brother david has experienced this i'm sure brother chris has experienced this that the frustrations of the people can and will influence us and we find ourselves striking when we should be praying striking when we should be asking for revelation striking when we should wait on the lord amen and they the people got frustrated moses on the mountain look we're looking for revelation church we're looking for revival we're looking for leadership and moses is on the mountain but i tell you i got an idea right here if all you sisters now just think about the time period all you sisters pull those bracelets off all you pull those big earrings off all you sisters pull those ankle bracelets off and all this stuff and let's melt them down and let's make us a calf obviously the calf's going to get us to the promised land right it is under that anointing that anointing suddenly brings them to a place they're willing to receive revelation that's not in the original word believing that's going to bring the same deliverance and the same guidance are you with me now brother brown says same thing today walk out of the light of this world the things that's of the world to walk in the light of god it leads you to the promised land so we have a very clear path from the center i hope you're with me from the center of our wilderness of sin we have a very clear directive to follow to get into the promised land amen it doesn't include any uh uh kadish barnias it doesn't include you know any times with with uh all all of those i'll i'll just condense it down with all of those things that happen it doesn't include any of that it's just simply walk in the light we don't need another great revelation we don't need another great strong voice we don't need a detour amen so you look at this i just think that's good my brother and sister walk out of the light of this world the things that's of the world to walk in the light of god it leads you to the promised land amen now look at this i need to hurry right along but i made my mind up before i started that we reach a certain point we'll just stop verse 39 and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise you see because there's a time and a season for everything god had already ordained my brother and sister that this would be the season that god would come and place the word in a perfect form in a perfect people to bring about the culmination of the original promise so god didn't have to come and say well you know uh um this story is incomplete like an editor you know coming reading somebody's book they're writing this story's incomplete you've got to have another chapter or you took the story this is where it ought to end we're cutting this off god don't have to do that god knew exactly what was necessary placed it in the right position and so as it is now there's a time and a season and they received a good report now this is not like a checklist this is not as though god was going down through there and checking these things off it's not as it were a report card that they failed so you've got to have another class to bring this forward but my brother and sister god they were doers let me just put it that way you understand that the saints of old were doers not perfect they made mistakes but they were doers right we read the word we have ample evidence they took god at his word and they are doers amen and in spite of that god said i'm going to bring it out to a certain point because i have another age another people that are doers they're not going to just talk about this you see those saints of old sought and found god's provided way now i'm going to just throw just kind of a little human element in here if if you can have any of you ever experienced the situation the position the mental state of if they can do it i can do it too in the natural yeah i destroyed a good dirt bike once on that principle he can do it i can do it too well he could do it i only tried but you see that's not where we as the bride are it's not us saying they did it we can do it too because it's the same holy ghost it's the same promised word and it's still the same revelation that they walked in is right here present so it's no longer this element of of the apostles and and the and the all of the saints of old they oh they could do this you see it was the holy ghost in them that calls them to do that and the same holy ghost is here and i say lord be in us also lord in your full power your full authority because what that will do is bring us to the place we fulfill this same word so it's no longer whether we're equal spiritually or we're this or we're that or they were such great men no my brother and sister they were men anointed of the holy ghost they were women anointed of the holy ghost and we are too hallelujah they surrender to god and we are too and so god's bringing to pass the fulfillment of his word to bring them into the place that they needed to be now do we understand uh symbiotic relationships right oftentimes there's a host and terminology would say a parasite but we'll look at this by in the spiritual sense we have a symbiotic relationship with our lord jesus christ simply put we can't live without him he's our host his life is our life and without him we have no life therefore we die so this symbiotic relationship my brother and sister is not a three-sided relationship one relationship boy jesus shook him up didn't he when he said you gotta eat my flesh and drink my blood well we're out of here this has this this church has just did a hard left but you see they missed the symbiotic relationship they missed that relationship and that was the only relationship that mattered it wasn't the church and the priest or in this day the pastor it's not the church and something else it's not some of you here and some of you there and i'll put this in this just to put a little plug in there just to kind of poke it just in case that spirit ever shows up if we ever as a church get to the point that we don't come to church because brother so-and-so is preaching then i'm going to tell people right now anybody that's listening anybody that's here you need to find you a place in the altar because that's not the holy ghost our symbiotic relationship is not brothers so and so and and i really just feed i've heard this so often this makes me sick well i really can feed on brother so-and-so's ministry are you feeding on the word or the man if you're feeding on the word then you'll receive the word wherever it comes from now we can have favorites that's fine i hope i'm on somebody's list come on some of you i'm sorry i shouldn't i shouldn't do that forgive me but when you guys get too serious sometimes i get nervous see the symbiotic relationship brings us well we can't live without him now the unbeliever says he can live without god that's his that's his declaration he can live without god but the believer amen we're speaking to believers till that the believer recognized an undeniable need it's not like i can and it doesn't matter i can go for a season you know i read a nice little quote don't who wrote who wrote it but it says let me save that that's not what it said let me say that i'll touch on it in just a moment see the believer recognize the undeniable need in other words day by day the believer says i need not i probably should or i could or i would but they say i need god in my life and there's an unquenchable desire for more of the lord now i'll read my little quotation here that i read this quotation says the one who says that they have enough of god has not met him yet hallelujah there's just no way when we meet god that we could say you know i've got enough of you lord i got enough to last the rest of my lifetime no there's an undeniable desire in the heart of that believer i need more of god hallelujah now let me hurry right along here we know we've been taught we hear it faith cometh by hearing but we also know that it's possible to hear but not to here right they hear with the ear but they're not hearing lest the scripture says i'd have to save them ouch our lord jesus is rough isn't he because if they actually heard what was said i would have to save them yes my oh my that sounds rough but i'll tell you what you do you should make us happy and say thank you lord that my ears are open and we know it's possible to read and not comprehend right that's right i it's just plain and simple we can put it in all kinds of natural forms these young people are learning uh uh all these math equations and this kind of stuff now they never had that when i was a kid you know and and they i had a young man say brother paul can can you answer this and i looked at him and i said what is it i can't even answer it because i don't even know what it is and he said well it's an equation out of trigonometry with some other thing added to it and i said uh i think they invented a calculator or something for that i said what are you using it for and he explained what he was using it for and i said let me show you how i figure that out and he he was there with this paper clear full of all these numbers and i said well you just run this and you do this and you do this and he says well that's too simple yeah praise the lord so i just what i need to do is just look at the word in simplicity right god in simplicity not in the hardest form of the equation but let's break it down into simplicity same young man asked me he says well brother paul how did you guys used to i have to admit i've fallen to the spirit of laodicea now i either drive a trap around the field to figure out how big it is because the computer and the tractor will tell me or i ride a four-wheeler around the field holding on to my gps unit but you know what we used to take a big long tape and run it out and figure out our rectangles and our triangles and we come up with the right answer some of you kids ought to come out and go to school with me of course plan on eating some dirt while you're at it but you see if people can hear but not hear they read but don't comprehend let me put it this way if christianity in general brings understanding of god then revelation 17 should cause the world to shudder not blindly press forward in their darkness their sin and their debauchery it ought to cause them to shudder because it tells us right here the seven angels and the seven vials and i'll show you the judgment of the great that sit on the waters and how the kings of the earth have committed fornication now these kings my brother and sister are a term that is listed as actually archaic so if you brought the bible into modern times it would talk about monarchs it would talk about presidents it would talk about prime ministers you understand what i'm saying we're not trying to change the scripture with whom all of this leadership of the world has committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk in the wine of her fornication this my brother and sister if the mere claim of christianity would bring enlightenment this chapter we won't go through the whole thing but this chapter should cause the whole world to shudder and find an altar but they just call it a mystery and it has nothing to do with them are you with me so if christianity in general brought understanding the world would be in revival right now now i'm going to just bounce forward over some things john 14 8 we'll look at this my brother and sister and i hope that me cutting this short doesn't um doesn't upset you know the the understanding or where we're going but just to show the reflection my brother and sister of what it is that god having chose something greater in you to make them perfect are you with me you see we actually have an obligation to the saints of old not a checklist obligation but an obligation to believe and confess the word exactly as god brought it to bring it to pass because by following that we not only secure our own salvation we according to the scriptures bring the saints of old into a position of perfection pretty healthy responsibility isn't it but you know what reason i titled my thoughts something good i started out actually i had to reword this something good is going to happen stop stop stop stop stop stop something good is happening we don't want to get into this deal that we're looking you know over the hill when god no he's working right now saints come on you can only imagine where we would be today if it wasn't for the lord amen we can only imagine what kind of mess hallelujah amen sister emmy would you just come we'll just we'll just cut this off right here still got quite a bit of stuff right here matthew 4 1-11 our lord jesus being led up into the wilderness being tempted of the devil you know his answer come right back just the same answer that you and i can put to work today it is written it's written here's the word it's written i don't have to defend this message i just need to live it it's written god's got it all in control what god spoke will come to pass i have confidence in that can you say amen to that tonight amen i hope this is just a little bit encouraging to you just to realize see what god's doing through the ages we're looking back at the apostle paul and matthew mark luke and john timothy and titus and all of these men we're looking back going wow that's incredible what they experienced if god opened a portal in heaven they would be looking out here and go my there's the bride the other part of us and they're in laodicea and they're still living it they're overcoming in laodicea look at this all the wickedness we faced in our day and they're facing it plus much more and they're living it oh lest i close the service on a downbeat we're here going my goodness if the devil just comes with another left hook i'm toast if this happens i'm just if i lose a job if this no it's got it all with control saints amen i know i've recounted this many times but it's still it's burnt into my senses reading the fox's book of martyrs a story in there i wished i had marked the page and had it to share probably ought to go back and find it but a man of wealth brought down to the stake to be burnt and they said just look recant you're a lovely family you've got all of this don't let that waste just recant and under the pressure he said yeah okay they let him go the devil says i turned one but the story goes that he spent the whole night tossing turning crying out to god bitter tears lord i betrayed you forgive me [Music] and with no one there to say oh come on go do it go do it just what was burning in his soul walked away from what we would all call logic right he's home free they think he's given up brother branham says don't think you can serve god secretly god's called us to an open gospel an open book [Music] and he goes down the next morning it's a lovely story some of you might be familiar with it he goes down the next morning and they said what are you doing here and he says you know what i'm recanting my recanting and they're like what are you what do you what are you thinking i can only see it being played out but what are you thinking because you gotta understand that that romanish spirit is really not about god and it's really actually not about religion while it is about religion but it's not really about god as religion it's about their form of worship their idol [Music] which isn't a god amen remember they bring the ark the old statue pitches over on his head they're kind of uptight about it standing back up what happened here what was he doing saints sitting on an unfirmed foundation and falling over no sir that god was bowing down to jehovah [Music] and this man's there and they go to tie him up to the stake and he says hey don't don't tie me here i'm so committed i'm going to stand [Music] but you know they never did that anymore because even as the flames licked up his body he lifted his hands and cried out in worship asking god to receive his soul and he was there with his hands lifted up and they did everything they could to push his hands his arms but they couldn't get close to the fire saints don't think that this gospel was a cakewalk and that we have just received the bitter blunt end of the ages no sir they fought they served they sold out they committed themselves oh could we do any less i ask oh but lest i close it on a bad note something good is happening we're recognizing it's no longer us we have our weakness of the flesh and of the mind and of the spirit and god comes in and takes all of that and changes us turns us into a new creature in christ jesus not that he just now changed us saints but now the reflection i was sitting in an accountant's office yesterday he had a beautiful picture somewhere up in the tetons the little words says in this big mountains there and there's a lake but there's a breeze on the lake remember i preached about that the reflection i told jerry says look at the water look at the water it's not a perfect reflection i liked her response she said not a perfect reflection but there is a reflection oh god if my reflection's not perfect lord i'm not gonna quit i'm not gonna i'm not gonna run away amen i'm gonna follow that anointing that was on peter and i'm gonna say oh lord forgive me and i wanna go back and i'm gonna just let the word bring me to a place i'm a perfect reflection amen love you saints god bless you tonight amen we'll just we'll just stop right there amen the name of the lord [Music] a strong tower [Music] a [Music] [Music] oh be the name of the lord oh blessed be the name of the lord oh blessed be the name of the lord oh blessed be the name of my lord oh blessed be the name of my lord oh blessed be the name of the lord most oh i run into [Applause] [Music] oh blessed be the name of my lord oh blessed be the name of my lord most

can someone say amen to that i'm not gonna be a new creation i am a new creation let's just stand and praise the lord just another song or so brother jay i'm gonna need you here i like this song but i just can't sing it because it's got the wrong letter at the bottom [Music] again that's what i am [Music] i'm a new creature i'm a brand new man [Music] hallelujah oh i've been born again we all all things are passed away [Music] [Music] hallelujah can we say thank you amen lord hallelujah hallelujah as we close amen let's just sing that i got the life of god in me i got so many songs wrote here we'd be another 45 minutes you know sometimes you're just studying and you're reading and you get an inspiration and you find yourself singing something while you're studying and i just learned write that down there's an inspiration connected in here hallelujah sometimes you get more inspiration than you get sermon amen hallelujah god bless you saints we love you and the lord see all this coming sunday now we'll announce again this sunday i don't sometimes trust technology did those of you with younger children get the invite of the uh um sister yulia shakes her head yes so i assume everybody
