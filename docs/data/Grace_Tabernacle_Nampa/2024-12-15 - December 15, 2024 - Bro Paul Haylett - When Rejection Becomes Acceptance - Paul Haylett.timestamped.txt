[37:35] speak to you
[37:37] today when
[37:39] rejection becomes
[37:42] acceptance now might seem like a little
[37:45] bit different title thank you musicians
[37:47] God bless you it might seem like a
[37:49] little different title but you see uh we
[37:53] live in a day and age that um uh we are
[37:57] called to make a stand we have to we
[37:59] have to literally stop and say you know
[38:02] what uh I'm not of this world that's
[38:04] exactly right and and that has to become
[38:06] the very essence of who we are is our
[38:10] identity cannot be partially in Christ
[38:14] that's right and partially in the world
[38:16] but we have to come to a place that that
[38:19] we would stand and so I kind of put it
[38:22] as today's thought goes two ways we
[38:24] reject Christ then we can be accepted of
[38:26] Satan
[38:28] and we reject Satan we can be accepted
[38:31] of Christ amen so it comes to a time
[38:35] that our rejection becomes acceptance
[38:38] and so if we tur in our Bibles to
[38:41] Matthew's 16th chapter and
[38:45] uh certainly trust that the Lord would
[38:48] just help us today to to articulate this
[38:53] correctly um
[38:57] we uh as we look in 16 verse 24-
[39:03] 28 uh we just take a a bit of our
[39:07] thought from this today quite a bit of
[39:08] scripture so just a little prayer please
[39:10] to help us through this then Jesus said
[39:13] unto his disciples If any man will come
[39:16] after me let him deny himself take up
[39:20] his cross and follow me so I think we
[39:24] could easily if you wouldn't mind we
[39:26] could easily put this point right here
[39:30] let him reject
[39:33] himself amen amen amen for whosoever
[39:37] will save his life shall lose it and
[39:39] whosoever will lose his life for my sake
[39:42] shall find it for what is a man profited
[39:46] if he shall gain the whole world and
[39:48] lose his own soul or what shall a man
[39:51] give in exchange for his soul for the
[39:54] son of man shall come in the glory of
[39:56] his father father with his angels and
[39:59] then he shall reward every man according
[40:02] to his Works whether they be acceptance
[40:06] or rejection amen verily I say unto you
[40:09] there be some standing here which shall
[40:11] not taste of death till they see the son
[40:13] of man coming in his kingdom and I say
[40:17] Amen to verse 28 amen it might be that I
[40:20] will be gone but some of you still here
[40:24] by the grace of God to see that
[40:25] fulfilled amen Heavenly Father we just
[40:28] ask you to come today Lord so good to be
[40:31] gathered once again with the Saints Lord
[40:33] and father just ask you to bless this
[40:36] time May the word come so powerfully
[40:38] father not because of the power of the
[40:41] man but because of the power of your
[40:42] revealed word and father come powerfully
[40:46] this morning Lord deal with hearts that
[40:48] I would know nothing about deal with
[40:50] lives and situations father that maybe
[40:53] are hidden as a deep secret within that
[40:56] person but Lord we are coming today
[40:58] asking you Lord just to recharge us let
[41:01] the word invigorate us father let us
[41:04] give us strength father into this bodies
[41:07] father that we can rise up and proudly
[41:10] proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[41:12] there' be no question of who we are and
[41:14] what we are here for we ask for your
[41:17] blessings in the name of Jesus Christ
[41:19] amen you may be seated
[41:25] Hallelujah whenever
[41:28] whenever I hear this
[41:31] song whenever it comes
[41:37] forth take this whole world and give me
[41:40] Jesus whenever I hear that song it it
[41:43] always is a reminder along this thought
[41:46] it it uh brings me to a place that it's
[41:49] like stop for a moment Paul and and
[41:52] measure what is your motivations and
[41:55] what is what is uh touch in your life
[41:58] what is putting you in a position uh to
[42:01] make certain priorities and ultimately
[42:04] we come to this place where by God's
[42:06] grace we realize that truly it is a
[42:09] revelation to us in this day that take
[42:12] this whole world that's it that's it you
[42:14] can have all of the wealth of this world
[42:17] but give me Jesus amen because life my
[42:20] brother and sister while a life of
[42:22] wealth let me just uh don't don't get
[42:24] too caught up in what I'm going to say
[42:26] here a life of wealth must be glorious
[42:29] to be able to live and do and have
[42:32] whatever you would desire but even if
[42:34] you live to a long age say a hundred
[42:37] years old that will be as just a flicker
[42:40] in time ultimately you will come to a
[42:43] place that you would be I'm I'm coming
[42:46] to to that age right now it's it's kind
[42:49] of coming upon me a little bit where I
[42:51] stop and I say where have the years gone
[42:54] that's right and so imagine you live to
[42:56] be a hundred but you're still going to
[42:58] be a 100 years old and you would look at
[43:01] that and as it says there what would you
[43:04] give my brother and sister what would we
[43:07] give for our soul those men with
[43:09] billions of dollars at that age taking a
[43:12] last breath would give every dime
[43:14] they've got for one more breath and so
[43:17] it's there in that time that wealth must
[43:19] be nice but my brother and sister how
[43:21] can we place value on eternal life amen
[43:24] to know that when this life passes
[43:27] that it is just now a transition of
[43:30] molecules moving into the presence of
[43:33] God to be reborn as it is in our youth
[43:36] again in that strength of Youth but it's
[43:38] not just about the youth but to know
[43:41] that what we live for Christ here we get
[43:43] to continue to live for eternity amen
[43:47] that is what makes it so beautiful is
[43:49] that we just get to continue on what is
[43:51] the priority of this life becomes the
[43:53] priority of Eternity and I thank God for
[43:56] that amen so the gospel challenges us to
[44:00] be in this world but not of this world
[44:02] and you know that's a actually a greater
[44:05] challenge than I think we give credit
[44:07] for my brother and sister it's it's a
[44:09] here in this world we we realize to the
[44:12] young people I don't want to be a downer
[44:14] to you but you know you're going to get
[44:18] a little bit older and then you get to
[44:21] work work work work work
[44:29] but when we were young we couldn't wait
[44:30] to be 18 to have a car to have our own
[44:32] bank account to be able to do what we
[44:34] wanted to do and then as a
[44:37] whisp
[44:43] gone to those of you are broke you
[44:45] wished you had
[44:48] more to those of you that have
[44:50] sufficient maybe God would anoint you to
[44:52] share that's right so we look at this my
[44:55] brother and sister to be in this world
[44:58] but not of this world can you get into
[45:00] the lake without getting
[45:02] wet so we realized the very eff of life
[45:06] is putting us right on the front line
[45:08] there's no such thing as hiding out in
[45:11] leoda to just pass the time to find the
[45:15] right moment to appear but it's there my
[45:18] brother and sister that that if you're
[45:20] going to jump in the lake just expect to
[45:22] get wet amen if it's cold outside and
[45:25] you don't wear a coat just expect to get
[45:27] cold and if you're in Leo deia just
[45:30] expect the devil to be here trying to
[45:33] make you
[45:35] lukewarm isn't this scripture so
[45:38] interesting when it says that I work
[45:40] that you would be hot or
[45:45] cold so we would almost be better off
[45:48] today if you follow me it's not my
[45:49] desire for you but if you would follow
[45:51] today God would rather that we would
[45:54] simply be absolutely cold yeah
[45:57] than to be lukewarm right but yet look
[46:00] at the world we live in today Satan
[46:02] reads his
[46:03] Bible he looks at that and says you know
[46:06] what I know how God feels about this
[46:09] because I can read the word too then I
[46:12] don't want to just pitch them out he
[46:13] doesn't really honestly Saints he
[46:15] doesn't really find as much pleasure in
[46:18] causing a man or a woman to just go
[46:20] throw their life to the world as he
[46:22] finds that pleasure in putting them in a
[46:24] lukewarm position cuz in a lukewarm
[46:28] position he knows that God is going to
[46:30] spew them out of his mouth which taken
[46:34] in context is complete rejection almost
[46:38] an
[46:41] insult imagine sitting at a
[46:47] table a sister recognizes you don't like
[46:49] her
[46:51] food but you sit there faithfully and
[46:53] eat everything on your plate
[46:57] she says well that wasn't his his food
[47:01] that wasn't what he really liked but
[47:03] imagine we're sitting at the same
[47:04] sister's table and we spit it
[47:07] out sisters can you imagine with me for
[47:10] a moment the ultimate of
[47:13] insult
[47:16] right I know this is truth I've sat down
[47:19] in certain countries and they dished up
[47:21] food and I took the first bite and
[47:24] stopped and they thought I was just
[47:25] blessing the food again
[47:28] but I was there Lord please help
[47:32] me and you got to be careful because if
[47:35] you close your eyes or look away for a
[47:36] moment they think Phil's played
[47:41] again but you see my brother and sister
[47:44] what would it be could I go call them
[47:46] sister if I had then done such an insult
[47:51] no so we see Satan's trying in this day
[47:55] to bring us to a place where just simply
[47:57] lukewarm because he knows God will not
[47:59] accept us and actually we become an
[48:02] insult to the gospel to say I'm a
[48:04] Christian but I'm Luke
[48:06] war God help us come on Saints we're not
[48:10] here to to try to move you by fear even
[48:13] though the scripture gives us permission
[48:15] that by fear to draw you out but you see
[48:19] we're not here by fear to do this but
[48:21] let's not be the lukewarm Christian that
[48:24] would bring such an insult
[48:27] such a slander to our Lord Jesus amen
[48:31] there is very serious influences in this
[48:33] age is there not we we look at the day
[48:36] and age that we live in you know to some
[48:39] I I don't I don't want to pin this on no
[48:40] one else there's been a time in my life
[48:43] I was just C certain that you know I
[48:45] would just work really hard and I would
[48:47] make a lot of money and you know and I
[48:50] had a whole scenario a whole list mapped
[48:52] out about what I would do with this
[48:54] money when I earned it and and you know
[48:57] God has blessed sister Jerry and I don't
[48:59] misunderstand me we we've done well you
[49:02] might say in life but it's nothing like
[49:04] what my initial ambition of my life put
[49:07] it at and God said you know you're
[49:10] actually my son and and I have made a
[49:13] commitment to you uh and I will not lose
[49:16] a one and so along the way God just
[49:18] keeps allowing things to happen that
[49:21] humble us that bring us to a place that
[49:24] we realize I am not in control of my own
[49:29] destiny God May bless me God may give me
[49:32] a few Comforts in life a few possessions
[49:35] in life but my destiny is not in my hand
[49:38] it's in his hand and God says if I see
[49:41] something that is detrimental to you I
[49:44] reserve the right to either bring you to
[49:46] the place that you outright reject it or
[49:50] to make it so painful you draw away from
[49:53] it
[50:01] James 4:4 says ye adulterers and
[50:04] adulteresses know ye not that the
[50:07] Friendship of the world is enity with
[50:09] God whosoever therefore will be a friend
[50:12] of the world is the enemy of God Amen I
[50:17] don't believe there's a single one of us
[50:18] sitting here this morning that would say
[50:20] I I I don't have a problem being an
[50:22] enemy of God my brother and sister you
[50:24] talk about a scary position
[50:27] amen because God's going to put every
[50:29] enemy under his feet amen I I I wasn't
[50:33] designed you was not designed to to be
[50:36] in that position we was called in fact
[50:39] the scripture uh gives us a a a forward
[50:42] view of what it will be my brother and
[50:45] sister we're not just going to be
[50:46] standing around in heaven praising God
[50:48] we're actually going to be as his bride
[50:51] in the
[50:52] throne that means we're in him amen
[50:56] we're not just sitting there not just a
[50:59] spectator we are a part and parcel of
[51:02] redemption of the plan of God of the
[51:05] king of kings amen and so as we look at
[51:08] this we recognize how Satan is so clever
[51:12] that he would cause us now if this
[51:15] doesn't fit you please don't don't
[51:17] reject it but he would cause us to come
[51:20] to a place that we don't call it
[51:22] compromis but we believe we can kind of
[51:24] straddle it we can kind of be just a
[51:27] little bit out here in the world and we
[51:30] can be uh maybe a little bit more so
[51:33] into the gospel but my brother and
[51:36] sister God's looking for 100% as we said
[51:38] already either hot or cold 100% in or
[51:42] 100% out amen and God has more respect
[51:45] for that so it's there see how how Satan
[51:49] is so clever that he slips in little
[51:52] compromises yes sir I I just I I I don't
[51:55] want to preach to you and expect you to
[51:58] line up to the word without
[52:00] acknowledging that we have our own
[52:01] things and and I I'm I'm I guess you
[52:05] would say a verocious reader I love to
[52:07] read it doesn't kind of matter what it
[52:10] is in a sense I love to read and yet God
[52:13] convicted me here some time back that I
[52:15] have books in my
[52:19] library that I wouldn't not want to hand
[52:21] to my Lord
[52:22] Jesus and say have you read this that's
[52:27] I had an initial thought of I'm going to
[52:29] take these books and I'll go send them
[52:31] down to to the Youth Ranch or something
[52:33] and then I was like if it's filth to me
[52:36] it will be filth to them and I threw
[52:38] them in the trash and they're now buried
[52:41] somewhere out in the landfill and that's
[52:43] where they deserve to be CU they are
[52:45] trash but you see what happens is is I I
[52:48] I hope you follow me this morning how
[52:50] clever Satan is to come and bring us to
[52:54] a position of compromise and we don't
[52:57] even know we're
[52:59] compromising we don't even realize that
[53:02] we have backed away from being red hot
[53:05] and are starting to go into the realm of
[53:08] lukewarm now this is the same Library
[53:10] saints that I have the message in
[53:13] bookcases stacked up book after book
[53:15] after book and it's all there my brother
[53:17] and sister you see dwelling in the same
[53:21] place vessels of Honor vessels of
[53:25] Dishonor that's it
[53:29] do we compromise and say a happy medium
[53:31] is good That's what Satan desires he
[53:35] desires for us to come to a place that
[53:37] we have enough of the
[53:39] message to
[53:41] offset enough of Lucifer's
[53:47] message God help us yes sir amen God
[53:50] help us you see we come to that
[53:53] place we have to reject
[53:58] to be
[54:02] accepted and you have to be willing to
[54:05] accept the
[54:09] rejection every one of us has to come to
[54:11] a place we're willing to give up what
[54:13] God's asking us to give
[54:15] up you know for some it might actually
[54:17] even come down to a
[54:21] job it might be if God has called us oh
[54:24] here's a job out in the middle of
[54:25] nowhere will make much money we'll be
[54:27] able to take our children to all kinds
[54:29] of special meetings and youth camps and
[54:31] this and that we'll be there for New
[54:33] Year's and communion and and then we're
[54:35] too busy to get in the car to go and
[54:39] Satan tricked
[54:42] us that we what we thought was a
[54:45] blessing was actually a trap of the
[54:48] devil amen and so we look at this my
[54:50] brother and sister now don't
[54:53] misunderstand me there are circumstances
[54:55] there are times but I'm talking about us
[54:57] making a life decision that keeps our
[55:00] children out of the house of God for
[55:02] year upon Year and that there's no
[55:05] reconciling that if God asks you to to
[55:08] or opens a door and you need to amen you
[55:11] need to go somewhere you need to take
[55:13] care of some work and do that my brother
[55:15] and sister I would trust there's more of
[55:17] Christ in you than to backslide in that
[55:20] period of time amen but you have to
[55:23] understand see that God wants us to be
[55:24] in the house of God and he wants wants
[55:26] us to be in fellowship and when we
[55:28] compromise on either one of those you
[55:32] will have a detrimental effect come and
[55:34] influence your life so it's there to be
[55:37] a friend of the world is an enemy of God
[55:39] and and so Satan's clever enough to un
[55:42] draw people unwittingly into this trap
[55:45] it's not like we willfully right go walk
[55:48] out and say you know what I'm just going
[55:50] to just step out of Fellowship because I
[55:52] don't need them people
[55:57] God said you did
[55:59] Sir now I can understand maybe you don't
[56:02] like those
[56:03] people that's
[56:06] fine but let me be harsh maybe when you
[56:09] get another dose of the Holy Ghost
[56:10] they'll look better that's
[56:15] right hope that didn't offend
[56:18] anybody and I have a quote to back it up
[56:21] if I need need to okay prophet of God
[56:23] talking about them sisters you know and
[56:25] the one looking out the window and
[56:26] whatever else you know about the time
[56:28] that she cleaned her window suddenly the
[56:30] sister across the lady across the deal
[56:33] there looked much
[56:34] better oh Lord take the
[56:37] isav Lord let us clean the
[56:40] windows let us come to the place that
[56:42] we're looking out and our brother and
[56:44] sister if we don't
[56:46] agree we still love them amen we still
[56:50] respect them and so that's what s Satan
[56:53] coming so clever see he works his way in
[56:57] and this is what I I I like and I've
[56:59] made kind of light of this in the past
[57:01] but you know my brother and sisters
[57:02] there's a lot of ways to to sing that
[57:04] song
[57:06] justifying you know I never did it in
[57:09] the first place it's their
[57:13] fault but you see what God wants us to
[57:16] do is come down that he don't care whose
[57:18] fault it is because if we come down to
[57:20] what we deserve my brother and sister
[57:22] none of us could sit here this morning
[57:24] under the presence of the Holy Spirit
[57:26] because we deserve much more than God
[57:29] said I will give you and it's there when
[57:32] I say that you know what I'm talking
[57:33] about we deserve the negative amen and
[57:36] God said I'm going to give you the
[57:37] positive I'm going to bless you when I
[57:40] should by all right you would be cursed
[57:43] but I'm going to bless you because I've
[57:45] taken the curse into my own
[57:51] flesh and straddling that fence between
[57:54] the world and the gospel it's not
[57:58] something we were ever even designed to
[58:00] do that's
[58:02] right to quote my late
[58:05] father he would put it this
[58:08] way he would tell me talking about
[58:11] spiritual things straddling the fence is
[58:14] no problem Paul until you come to a
[58:18] post and ultimately at a post you have
[58:20] to get off one side or the other so get
[58:23] off now that's right
[58:27] amen and God will bring I'm talking to
[58:30] Believers okay don't don't misunderstand
[58:32] I'm talking to Believers we might as
[58:34] well get off the fence now amen and not
[58:37] make God Force us off the fence Amen Let
[58:41] God move us to a place that even if it's
[58:44] difficult even if it's difficult my
[58:47] brother and sister now we have to use
[58:48] good judgment getting on the fence if
[58:50] you don't mind just a moment of of humor
[58:53] here as a young man we had dairy cattle
[58:56] my dad did not like Bob wire because it
[58:58] you know cuts the cattle up just like
[58:59] horse people don't like Bob wire it cuts
[59:01] up the horse and um I also learned the
[59:04] hard way my dad never told me about when
[59:06] you stradle the fence which side to get
[59:07] off of but if there's a hot wire on that
[59:10] one side amen get off the other side
[59:14] amen if there's judgment off one side
[59:16] get off the other side amen we're not
[59:18] here to be going through life in a
[59:21] constant state of continual shock amen
[59:25] God wants to bring us peace joy
[59:27] happiness amen so look what Satan's
[59:30] trying to do he's trying to get us to
[59:33] get so comfortable in this world that we
[59:35] think we can just kind of bounce back
[59:37] and forth between the two you know it
[59:39] was interesting Brother David and sister
[59:41] Diane was there in the conversation in
[59:43] North Idaho and and a brother up there
[59:46] was sharing a little bit of his life uh
[59:48] and some things that had happened in his
[59:50] life and you know he was there and come
[59:53] into some troubled times and Men He
[59:56] thought were're
[59:57] Brothers you might say put the hooks to
[1:00:01] him you see my brother and sister
[1:00:04] sometimes God is going to allow that to
[1:00:07] happen that we will not judge by
[1:00:10] personality or how much or how fine of
[1:00:13] life and how whatever they own and how
[1:00:16] many they own that we would judge by the
[1:00:18] word and the word says that we should
[1:00:21] judge all things righteously that's
[1:00:24] right and as we judge righteously God's
[1:00:27] promise that he would lead us and guide
[1:00:29] us and and you know part of that judging
[1:00:31] righteously is actually acting asking
[1:00:34] God to show us what we should do instead
[1:00:38] of doing what seems to be best
[1:00:41] convenient or
[1:00:44] obvious we need that kind of leadership
[1:00:46] because you see Satan will lead us into
[1:00:49] a trap of his
[1:00:53] own so if you look at this now
[1:00:56] we'll never be comfortable in this world
[1:00:59] I just want to make this announcement
[1:01:01] this morning this uh you know to glare
[1:01:03] this out here right now we will never be
[1:01:07] comfortable in this
[1:01:12] world just like we would not be
[1:01:17] comfortable in countries on the Earth
[1:01:22] today you would not
[1:01:26] feel safe you would not feel like you
[1:01:28] belong there I've had a few of
[1:01:31] experiences like
[1:01:33] that in in life amen when you find
[1:01:36] yourself in a
[1:01:38] circumstance that that the people you're
[1:01:40] surrounded with they would just as well
[1:01:43] throw you in an alley as a rag as they
[1:01:46] would to speak to you and we realize I
[1:01:48] don't belong
[1:01:50] here now it is that we in our spirit
[1:01:53] Satan now uh bear with me today I don't
[1:01:56] even know what to call this kind of
[1:01:57] service I just know this is what God
[1:01:59] laid upon my heart my brother and sister
[1:02:02] when we have DED the presence of the
[1:02:05] holy spirit in our life we end up in
[1:02:09] circumstance or location or place or
[1:02:12] purpose that we never were meant to be
[1:02:15] in but our spiritual sense is dulled and
[1:02:20] we find ourselves there and then a
[1:02:22] glimpse of something reminds us this is
[1:02:25] not my world I don't belong here Lord
[1:02:28] help me that's right and then when we
[1:02:31] get out of that D State and we come and
[1:02:34] God dealing with us we realize you know
[1:02:37] what how how did I ever end up in this
[1:02:41] condition now let's be honest this
[1:02:43] morning you don't have to lift a hand
[1:02:45] you don't have to acknowledge anything
[1:02:47] but I believe every one of us sitting
[1:02:48] here this morning would have to say yes
[1:02:50] and I'm not being arrogant I'm not
[1:02:52] trying to be bold it's just a fact how
[1:02:54] many of us have come to the point that
[1:02:57] we have hardly got enough fire in us to
[1:02:59] say Amen hardly enough fire in us to get
[1:03:03] up out out of our house and go to the
[1:03:05] house of God enough fire in us to get
[1:03:07] down and pray earnestly
[1:03:11] amen am I kind of on the right
[1:03:13] track and then we come to a place that
[1:03:16] by the grace of God we
[1:03:18] recognize and we say how did I get here
[1:03:22] well don't beat yourself up please
[1:03:25] honestly don't don't start I must not be
[1:03:27] a real Christian no my brother and
[1:03:29] sister this shows the adversary that you
[1:03:32] are facing is so clever to bring you to
[1:03:36] a place that you don't really care about
[1:03:39] God at all maybe you know that you've
[1:03:41] got sin in your life unbelief in your
[1:03:43] life and you'd say well I guess I'm so
[1:03:45] far gone it doesn't matter
[1:03:48] anyhow that's a famous lie of the devil
[1:03:52] it doesn't matter anyhow but you see my
[1:03:55] brother and S sister even if you don't
[1:03:57] feel like it please believe me this
[1:03:59] morning even if you don't feel like it
[1:04:02] God called you God brought you this but
[1:04:05] he opened the word to you he give
[1:04:07] Revelation to you he let you see who you
[1:04:10] are and the devil's trying to get you to
[1:04:13] look at the other side of the coin and
[1:04:15] not even recognize not give any credit
[1:04:18] this is what we're doing we're doing
[1:04:19] disservice to the holy spirit because we
[1:04:22] won't even acknowledge his presence amen
[1:04:26] amen
[1:04:30] amen and yet we'd still say God sent a
[1:04:33] prophet I believe the
[1:04:36] message as lukewarm as lukewarm as
[1:04:38] lukewarm as lukewarm can
[1:04:44] be and then Satan would just leave you
[1:04:46] alone for a while because he's got you
[1:04:50] where he wants you but you see the word
[1:04:53] amen we believe the word don't we amen
[1:04:56] the word says I've never lost a one amen
[1:05:01] so all the way out in lukewarm L oia God
[1:05:05] comes and brings a beautiful reminder to
[1:05:08] us of who we are and why we're here and
[1:05:12] the word suddenly Sparks alive you might
[1:05:14] be doing something this is a little bit
[1:05:16] of a testimony of an individual I was
[1:05:19] doing something totally unrelated to God
[1:05:21] and a man who just has a a a mega church
[1:05:24] kind of relationship ship with God
[1:05:26] starts telling him just how good God is
[1:05:30] and he's sitting there going oh my this
[1:05:32] man I won't go into this whole testimony
[1:05:35] this man is is here in his theology
[1:05:38] telling me how I should be excited about
[1:05:42] what God's doing and I haven't been
[1:05:44] excited for
[1:05:46] months and God used that to draw him
[1:05:49] back and say Lord why am I not excited
[1:05:55] yeah yeah does that immediately mean
[1:05:57] he's not a Believer not saved not called
[1:06:00] not
[1:06:01] chosen
[1:06:03] no it's a time we have to
[1:06:07] reject to be received
[1:06:11] amen and as long as we're willing to
[1:06:14] compromise we'll face those kind of
[1:06:17] battles that's why we should stand up
[1:06:19] and
[1:06:21] say God is my God his people Are My
[1:06:26] People amen I will worship in the way
[1:06:28] he's called me to worship and I will
[1:06:30] serve him in the way he's called me to
[1:06:32] serve
[1:06:33] him with no compromise you see Ruth is
[1:06:37] not just a sister's chapter that's right
[1:06:41] it's the believer the bride it's who we
[1:06:44] are to come with a revelation my brother
[1:06:46] and sister that truly your God is my God
[1:06:50] Amen so as we look at this now in John
[1:06:53] 15 and8 uh 18 and 19 there said if the
[1:06:57] world hates you you know that it hated
[1:07:00] me before it hated you see and
[1:07:03] oftentimes young people we'll come to a
[1:07:05] struggle because we're kind of mocked
[1:07:06] and looked down on because we're
[1:07:08] Christians and and you know we then try
[1:07:11] to kind of compromise or strid that
[1:07:13] fence I did it through my whole high
[1:07:15] school
[1:07:18] years I straddled the
[1:07:20] fence I don't say this to be humorous I
[1:07:23] just want to tell you what anointing
[1:07:24] will do to you you I would walk out of
[1:07:27] the
[1:07:28] house I didn't have a tie on obviously
[1:07:31] nice shirt looked good respectable I
[1:07:35] would get on the school bus before I
[1:07:37] made it to the back of the school
[1:07:40] bus roll the Cuffs up unbutton the shirt
[1:07:44] the walk went from what I would call
[1:07:47] normal do you see these kids you see on
[1:07:49] the streets today I'm sorry to
[1:07:51] disappoint them Poor Boys they're
[1:07:54] nothing new they're not original they're
[1:07:59] copycats walk to the back of the
[1:08:03] bus now at my age you might find that
[1:08:06] hard to imagine at that age it came
[1:08:08] naturally
[1:08:10] yeah you know what I looked like when I
[1:08:12] got off the school
[1:08:14] bus sleeves rolled down pants pulled
[1:08:21] up you know what that's called a
[1:08:24] chameleon
[1:08:27] yeah you see I fit perfectly into the
[1:08:29] environment I was
[1:08:31] in that's also called the Great
[1:08:34] deception that's right to still think in
[1:08:37] your heart I'm a
[1:08:39] Christian and then blend into the
[1:08:43] environment that's not what God called
[1:08:45] us to God called us to be a light to the
[1:08:48] world he called us to stand out he
[1:08:51] called us to be
[1:08:53] representation of him amen and I'm I'm
[1:08:55] telling you my brother and sister when
[1:08:57] Jesus walked in the room they knew he
[1:08:59] was there that's right amen it wasn't
[1:09:01] because his clothes it wasn't because
[1:09:03] the way he walked it wasn't the latest
[1:09:05] Styles it was the spirit the presence of
[1:09:08] almighty God was in him I want to be a
[1:09:11] Christian amen right that's what it is
[1:09:14] right to be Christlike Hallelujah so if
[1:09:17] the world hates you don't worry about it
[1:09:19] they hated him before they hated you and
[1:09:22] if you were of the world the world would
[1:09:24] love his
[1:09:27] I wonder if any of you will identify
[1:09:29] with this you get out in the world and
[1:09:32] as much as you would try to be part of
[1:09:33] the world you don't fit in that's right
[1:09:37] and if you don't realize that that's
[1:09:39] Christ in you then you'll just start to
[1:09:41] think that you're some strange Oddball
[1:09:44] whatever that that just is weird to
[1:09:46] everybody but my brother and sister
[1:09:48] that's Christ keeping you from the
[1:09:50] compromise he's keeping you from coming
[1:09:53] to the place that you look like the
[1:09:55] world in a lukewarm version of
[1:09:58] Christianity that's not what we're
[1:10:00] called
[1:10:02] to but I have chosen you now I've been
[1:10:06] studying recently might preach on this I
[1:10:09] mentioned at a time or two about um
[1:10:12] Calvinism and Armenian ISM and you know
[1:10:15] they have their arguments about
[1:10:16] predestination and and how it all fits
[1:10:19] together but my brother and sister let's
[1:10:20] forget about Armenian ISM and Calvinism
[1:10:23] and let's just take the word for what it
[1:10:24] is and and am I reading this correctly
[1:10:27] in John 15 that it says there uh you
[1:10:30] know that uh because you're not of the
[1:10:32] world but I
[1:10:34] have chosen you yes
[1:10:38] sir does the scripture have that correct
[1:10:42] or did we choose
[1:10:44] him see the word says that we've never
[1:10:47] come to him he's always come to
[1:10:51] us and people say well predestination
[1:10:54] well that's deceptive to think that God
[1:10:57] chose you and he's going to let other
[1:10:59] people go to hell but he chose you to
[1:11:02] keep you from going to hell and then
[1:11:04] they just conviently they don't quote
[1:11:07] all of the Bible that's
[1:11:10] right now my brother and sister you can
[1:11:13] walk and be part of without being chosen
[1:11:17] but ultimately
[1:11:18] time we'll do the separation
[1:11:27] everything is tested amen with time amen
[1:11:31] that's right and many a person today has
[1:11:33] come down to this point and said I'm a
[1:11:35] believer I'm a believer I'm a Believer
[1:11:37] my family's been Believers for 50 60
[1:11:39] years it doesn't matter any of that are
[1:11:41] you standing the test today or have we
[1:11:45] compromised that's are we Sliding Away
[1:11:48] to another idea to another thought to
[1:11:51] another Spirit or are we standing on the
[1:11:54] word amen amen now if he would choose
[1:11:57] you out of the world and he says that he
[1:12:00] was going to have a people called out of
[1:12:01] the church then the denominational
[1:12:04] Church would really have to be
[1:12:06] classified as the
[1:12:09] world
[1:12:10] ouch it it's kind of
[1:12:13] rough sounds like we're
[1:12:15] judgmental no we're realists that's
[1:12:18] right we're
[1:12:19] realist brother brandham didn't call him
[1:12:21] a lodge just because he was angry at
[1:12:24] them no right he called them a lodge
[1:12:26] because that was the spirit that was in
[1:12:29] them what was that
[1:12:31] Spirit outright unbelief no they believe
[1:12:34] Jesus is the
[1:12:36] Christ they believe you need the Holy
[1:12:38] Ghost they believe he's coming
[1:12:41] back but there's so much they don't
[1:12:44] believe yeah and you say but they don't
[1:12:46] publish that that's right but their life
[1:12:49] does yes that's right their life does
[1:12:51] which side the fence are they on that's
[1:12:54] right or are they
[1:12:56] straddling amen so I'd say it's a good
[1:12:59] sign if the world rejects you yeah who
[1:13:02] are they after all that's right
[1:13:05] right yes you're trying to impress
[1:13:09] people that don't even care
[1:13:16] that's
[1:13:19] my James
[1:13:22] 4:7 and8
[1:13:25] look at this now how God deals with this
[1:13:27] he says submit yourselves therefore to
[1:13:31] God so what is this now if you submit
[1:13:34] yourself to God that means that you have
[1:13:37] to
[1:13:39] reject this
[1:13:41] world this
[1:13:44] Kingdom the one who has is sitting on
[1:13:47] the throne right now see Satan can come
[1:13:49] today and speak to you and talk about
[1:13:52] come and sit with me on my Throne
[1:13:54] because he has been given a
[1:13:57] throne so he's speaking the very same
[1:14:00] words that the gospel is
[1:14:04] speaking and people would say hey I've
[1:14:07] been invited to sit on the
[1:14:09] throne but what's beyond the
[1:14:13] throne Satan doesn't have a sea of
[1:14:17] Crystal
[1:14:19] Satan well I I won't go there that's a
[1:14:22] little bit blunt
[1:14:25] submit yourself therefore to God see one
[1:14:27] of the first things we have to do to
[1:14:28] make this work is actually come to a
[1:14:30] place of submission yes resist the devil
[1:14:35] that's our second step and let's just be
[1:14:38] honest with each other that can be hard
[1:14:39] sometimes he is such a clever
[1:14:43] salesman he presents it in such a
[1:14:46] beautiful
[1:14:48] fashion look who will like you look how
[1:14:51] you'll be accepted
[1:14:55] just temporal though that's right
[1:14:57] nothing Eternal there it's
[1:14:59] temporal acceptance that's temporal
[1:15:03] means I could like you today brother
[1:15:05] Trevor and disown you tomorrow
[1:15:09] temporal and when Satan cannot even
[1:15:11] redeem himself is he going to give his
[1:15:14] life to redeem
[1:15:16] you story of Ruth that's right yeah
[1:15:20] right he would not because he was afraid
[1:15:23] that it would uh Mar his inheritance
[1:15:26] which was life he knew if he laid his
[1:15:29] life down he would be incapable of
[1:15:33] raising it back
[1:15:35] up did our lord Jesus ever be recorded
[1:15:38] as having a fear of raising his life
[1:15:41] back up he says I'll lay it down for you
[1:15:45] and I will raise it back up for you amen
[1:15:51] Ma you talk about selfless
[1:15:53] sacrifice talk about the giving of one
[1:15:57] my brother and sister he wasn't afraid
[1:15:58] to lay his life
[1:16:01] down he wasn't lukewarm that's right he
[1:16:07] said we have
[1:16:09] Redemption and it requires a
[1:16:12] token and the token must have a
[1:16:16] price oh that reminds me the note I
[1:16:19] didn't write
[1:16:22] down is the token of free gift
[1:16:29] that's a little thought twister isn't
[1:16:32] it is the token a free
[1:16:38] gift almost like Calvinism Armenian ISM
[1:16:42] we're going to argue both sides of
[1:16:45] this the token is a free
[1:16:48] gift after Israel killed the lamb
[1:16:55] took the hiss up and put the blood over
[1:16:57] the
[1:16:58] doorpost it was
[1:17:02] free wait brother Paul we don't have a
[1:17:05] Works gospel no but we have an action
[1:17:08] gospel true God requires an action out
[1:17:11] of you and I he's not going to come down
[1:17:14] here and grab your hand and take it out
[1:17:17] here and grab the lamb and drag the lamb
[1:17:20] over here and then take your hand and
[1:17:23] grab the knife and SL lay the lamb and
[1:17:26] put the blood in the bowl and then take
[1:17:28] your hand and go out and get a handful
[1:17:30] of hsip and come back and make you dip
[1:17:34] that hsip in the blood and then lift
[1:17:36] your hand to Mark the doorpost yeah
[1:17:39] right no sir some point in time we have
[1:17:41] to catch a revelation of who I am and
[1:17:44] because of I the revelation of who I am
[1:17:47] I look at the word and the word is a
[1:17:49] living
[1:17:50] word problem we're doing my brother and
[1:17:53] sister we're turning the mess message
[1:17:55] into a historical gospel God wants it to
[1:17:59] be a living gospel he has redeemed us
[1:18:03] he's paid the price he's given
[1:18:05] everything we need for Redemption and
[1:18:08] now he doesn't want Works he wants
[1:18:10] action he wants you to be able to say I
[1:18:13] believe this and then to apply it to
[1:18:15] your own life is God going to come down
[1:18:17] and force you to be a
[1:18:19] believer absolutely not there has to be
[1:18:22] something in you that says there's
[1:18:24] action required here if the word says
[1:18:26] repent I Repent if the word says be
[1:18:28] baptized I get baptized if the word says
[1:18:30] do this I do it not works my brother and
[1:18:33] sister
[1:18:35] obedience entirely different category
[1:18:38] people are by works I can do good things
[1:18:40] I can do good deeds I'll give to the
[1:18:42] poor I'll this I'll that my brother and
[1:18:44] sister that's works but my brother and
[1:18:46] sister whenever God comes down and
[1:18:48] starts to move in the life of a son or
[1:18:50] daughter of God there's something stirs
[1:18:52] inside of them and that find Fire gets
[1:18:55] bigger and bigger it's not the fire
[1:18:57] going out amen remember the little story
[1:19:00] about the man you know that that had hit
[1:19:02] the gold you know struck it rich and
[1:19:05] went out there and his dog is barking
[1:19:07] and and he he goes out finally he's so
[1:19:09] upset at the dog barking he kills the
[1:19:14] dog his
[1:19:16] rejection now look at that story a
[1:19:18] little different way our conscience
[1:19:21] sometimes the Holy Spirit dealing with
[1:19:23] us barking barking barking I'm not being
[1:19:27] disrespectful don't misunderstand what
[1:19:29] do we do we kill our
[1:19:33] conscience and then the enemy kills
[1:19:37] us oh my brother and sister you see lot
[1:19:40] of things in life that we just don't
[1:19:42] look at it in the correct fashion amen
[1:19:46] draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh
[1:19:49] to
[1:19:53] you isn't it interesting I hope I hope
[1:19:56] nobody's upset that I put it this way um
[1:20:00] isn't it interesting when it comes to
[1:20:06] courtship there's something this why we
[1:20:08] must do courtship correctly because
[1:20:11] there's something in
[1:20:14] us that draws us nigh to the
[1:20:20] girl
[1:20:23] boy something in it draws us
[1:20:26] nigh and ultimately if we're not careful
[1:20:28] we can go too far and hug and pet and
[1:20:30] get in
[1:20:31] trouble but draw
[1:20:34] nigh becoming
[1:20:37] irresistible even if it's accepted in
[1:20:39] public this right here sometimes is what
[1:20:43] we settle
[1:20:44] for fck can just hold her
[1:20:48] hand imagine courting a girl and you
[1:20:52] didn't care whether you saw her or not
[1:20:58] I'll call her when I feel like calling
[1:21:00] her and if I don't feel like it I
[1:21:02] won't that's not
[1:21:06] love I won't go into
[1:21:10] that but let me just
[1:21:12] say that's how Satan's got many a
[1:21:17] Believer when I need
[1:21:21] something I want to draw nigh
[1:21:25] when I don't need anything I'm happy
[1:21:29] just like I
[1:21:34] am who knew so many things in life would
[1:21:37] tie together so
[1:21:39] much I tell you my brother and sister
[1:21:42] when I was courting sister Jerry the
[1:21:45] roads were not nearly as nice as they
[1:21:46] are now to go up there but they was
[1:21:48] sometimes I drove every weekend to the
[1:21:50] Tri Cities and I would stay till
[1:21:53] midnight 1 in the morning morning her
[1:21:55] parents said you have to be here at the
[1:21:56] house we would be sitting in the front
[1:21:58] yard as it were and finally I got to go
[1:22:02] home and then I had work to do I would
[1:22:05] sleep on the side of the highway I've
[1:22:07] slept almost every spot there is to
[1:22:09] sleep between the Tri Cities and cwell
[1:22:11] idah
[1:22:12] home because when you look up in the
[1:22:15] reflector is saying hi nice to meet you
[1:22:17] it's time to park but you see my brother
[1:22:20] and sister I couldn't stay away from her
[1:22:22] because I loved her amen
[1:22:25] can we transfer that over to a
[1:22:28] relationship with Christ amen I can't
[1:22:33] stay away from
[1:22:36] him you see how slippery Satan is often
[1:22:40] times we've become a feast and famine
[1:22:42] type relationship that we we want to be
[1:22:44] close to the Lord when we have a
[1:22:47] need but the Lord said you know
[1:22:49] sometimes when you ask I don't answer
[1:22:51] because you asked a miss right one to
[1:22:54] Heap it to your own lust
[1:22:59] amen somebody smile at me okay I'm I'm
[1:23:02] starting to feel like I'm
[1:23:05] lecturing but what can you say when God
[1:23:07] lays it on your heart right you say yes
[1:23:10] sir I'll preach it amen you see what
[1:23:13] Satan's goal is and and this will tie in
[1:23:16] here in just a few short minutes this
[1:23:18] will tie in now to to a quote I'll read
[1:23:20] to you but what's Satan's goal the
[1:23:23] destruction of your soul Soul yeah
[1:23:25] ultimately but remember we're talking
[1:23:27] about the fact he doesn't have to cause
[1:23:29] you to go be a drunk or a drug addict or
[1:23:31] a womanizer or manizer or whatever they
[1:23:34] call them and and he doesn't has cause
[1:23:36] you to do that he's just got to break
[1:23:38] your fellowship and he's fine to let you
[1:23:40] go to church he's fine for you to
[1:23:42] confess the name of Christ when he knows
[1:23:45] the connection's broken that's it so
[1:23:47] look at
[1:23:48] this Satan's goal wants to keep you
[1:23:51] Earthbound he's not even looking at this
[1:23:54] present moment but ultimately sometimes
[1:23:56] it's right here in this moment now bear
[1:23:58] with me I I'm just saying this cuz I
[1:24:00] want to encourage you believe it or not
[1:24:01] I believe this is an encouraging service
[1:24:04] and it's there but look at this my
[1:24:05] brother and sister how many times have
[1:24:07] we walked through the doors of church
[1:24:09] and sit on the Pew and walked out and
[1:24:11] did not really be blessed was not
[1:24:14] blessed because there was something else
[1:24:16] that was all stirred up in our life and
[1:24:18] we sat here in church and instead of
[1:24:20] thinking about what God's trying to tell
[1:24:22] you we think about our problem yeah yeah
[1:24:25] and so what what's happened we walked
[1:24:26] out Deliverance was in the room do you
[1:24:28] believe that every time you come to the
[1:24:30] house of God that Deliverance is in the
[1:24:32] house of God Amen that's what the word
[1:24:35] says amen and so if he can keep you
[1:24:38] Earthbound thinking about the lack of
[1:24:40] Finance thinking about this problem or
[1:24:42] that problem then what is it he's
[1:24:45] keeping you out of heavenly places
[1:24:47] keeping you
[1:24:50] Earthbound and if we're not careful we
[1:24:52] walk out of church still blaming someone
[1:24:53] else that's right and that's what I love
[1:24:56] about being the youngest we always could
[1:24:59] just take that
[1:25:00] thing this is
[1:25:04] Paul wh what what do you mean this is
[1:25:06] Paul you it can't be my
[1:25:11] fault but my sister on the other hand it
[1:25:15] could be her fault yes I need someone to
[1:25:19] put it
[1:25:20] on well look there's plenty of
[1:25:23] somebody's yeah yeah we go in the house
[1:25:26] of God Satan is already planning a way
[1:25:30] to keep you Earthbound amen he wants to
[1:25:33] keep you firmly planted in your your uh
[1:25:36] bitterness in your animosities in your
[1:25:40] complexes and all of that thing keeps
[1:25:42] you firmly Earthbound When God says
[1:25:45] you're supposed to be in Heavenly places
[1:25:47] by now prophet of God saying you know
[1:25:49] what we should have already taken a
[1:25:51] Rapture well you know it's probably
[1:25:52] people like me that stopped it
[1:25:56] well that's better than me saying people
[1:25:57] like
[1:26:00] you wouldn't we agree it's better the
[1:26:03] pastor takes the burden than
[1:26:05] you but you see what's happened is Satan
[1:26:07] has made us Earthbound every time that
[1:26:11] something moves the Holy Spirit comes
[1:26:12] and really stirs us and we're fixing to
[1:26:15] let go of a complex we've had a
[1:26:16] bitterness we've had and it's so and
[1:26:18] then just as we're fixing to take a step
[1:26:21] into Heavenly places Satan comes in
[1:26:25] and firmly back to the ground again and
[1:26:28] then we wonder why is there not victory
[1:26:30] in the church well that's cuz like a
[1:26:32] plane you're
[1:26:34] grounded you can't fly in that condition
[1:26:37] we all get upset when you're at the
[1:26:39] airport and they say we have a
[1:26:41] maintenance issue on this plane and
[1:26:42] it'll be a little bit sister Jerry and I
[1:26:44] we went to Canada had that issue we're
[1:26:46] sitting there man that plane's set there
[1:26:47] for an hour why didn't they fix it then
[1:26:50] and then you stop and you think I don't
[1:26:52] really care when they figured out it had
[1:26:54] a problem I'm just glad they want to fix
[1:26:56] the
[1:26:56] problem cuz I don't think us putting our
[1:26:59] hands out the window doing this is going
[1:27:01] to make any
[1:27:02] difference so you see it doesn't matter
[1:27:05] what stage it is in our life or
[1:27:07] relationships and all of these things
[1:27:10] just be thankful that God would expose
[1:27:13] the deficiency amen and help us Lord to
[1:27:16] get off the ground that's right amen now
[1:27:19] Satan wants to keep you Earthbound which
[1:27:21] is nothing more than a state of defeat
[1:27:24] that's right you know every time Revival
[1:27:25] sweeps the church Satan's right behind
[1:27:27] it with problems and we act like every
[1:27:30] single time that it's some new Starling
[1:27:32] thing that happened we had a glorious
[1:27:34] Revival and Trouble Follows right behind
[1:27:37] it oh my goodness what happened de we
[1:27:40] had such a beautiful time that's right
[1:27:44] God loves you enough he pull the Hedge
[1:27:46] back and say you know what you rejoice
[1:27:49] then I want to see what you're going to
[1:27:51] do now yes will you still
[1:27:55] Rejoice no I can't
[1:28:01] Rejoice it's just too
[1:28:06] hard month from that oh the promises are
[1:28:09] true thank God I'm the
[1:28:12] bride why don't we equal this out I
[1:28:14] don't want to ride a plane that does
[1:28:16] this you have to wonder is the pilot
[1:28:19] awake is there a pilot but he said I
[1:28:22] will lead you and I will guide guide
[1:28:24] you when it goes like this Saints are
[1:28:28] hands just like they
[1:28:30] would on an airplane I've seen this
[1:28:32] happen we have seen people pull their
[1:28:35] crucifixes out faster than you can take
[1:28:37] a breath look like the plane's going to
[1:28:40] slam down on a Runway and they just
[1:28:42] magically appear and they're
[1:28:45] like and you're like what's
[1:28:50] that when the roller coaster goes down
[1:28:53] the hands go up
[1:28:54] that's right when the plane starts to go
[1:28:57] down the hands go up amen When Trials
[1:29:02] come and Satan tries to blow you into
[1:29:05] the to the Dead
[1:29:07] Fall the hands go
[1:29:11] up but the normal reaction of humanity
[1:29:14] I'm sorry to just labor on this but
[1:29:15] normal reaction of humanity is we run
[1:29:18] into a roadblock and you know what
[1:29:21] happens hands go down head goes down woe
[1:29:26] is
[1:29:27] me you want to know how I can preach
[1:29:29] that I've practiced it
[1:29:33] am and we shouldn't preach it unless we
[1:29:35] practice it amen I've done that Saints
[1:29:39] but I tell you God's coming and
[1:29:41] reminding this bride this chosen bride
[1:29:44] that he has chosen out of the Nations
[1:29:46] every Kindred Every Nation every tongue
[1:29:49] and he's teaching her when the adversary
[1:29:52] comes amen you you just wait because I'm
[1:29:56] there to raise up a wall against him be
[1:29:59] patient before you start saying oh woe
[1:30:02] is me Woe Is Me Lord why did you let
[1:30:05] this happen stop and say I'm going to
[1:30:09] stand right here and I'm going to see
[1:30:11] the Deliverance of the Lord I'm going to
[1:30:13] see the power of God come and change
[1:30:16] this situation because Satan you have no
[1:30:19] control over my
[1:30:21] destiny you know we forget about that
[1:30:25] right if you've ever had a situation I
[1:30:27] don't want to go into it but you ever
[1:30:28] have a situation that is so extreme that
[1:30:31] it just feels like it has blown you to
[1:30:34] pieces and you get there and and our
[1:30:37] reaction is always to be whoa where are
[1:30:39] you
[1:30:42] God why didn't God why didn't God come
[1:30:45] and just come right over real close to
[1:30:48] us
[1:30:49] and and
[1:30:52] say I'm here
[1:30:56] that's what we'd like isn't it for God
[1:30:59] to come real close to us and say yeah
[1:31:01] I'm right
[1:31:02] here you know why he doesn't do
[1:31:07] that cuz he already
[1:31:10] said he was right
[1:31:13] there this is his voice amen this is his
[1:31:17] word this is him that's it just like he
[1:31:21] couldn't heal you or do anything
[1:31:23] anything more for you than he's already
[1:31:26] done because he's already healed you
[1:31:31] amen by God's grace we have the answer
[1:31:34] now I'm going to I'm just move along
[1:31:36] here real quick I didn't realize time
[1:31:37] was fleeting well I knew time was
[1:31:39] fleeting I didn't know it's this
[1:31:40] fleeting Ephesians
[1:31:43] 47-8 and 21- 24 and I'm just going to uh
[1:31:48] bounce through this real quick every uh
[1:31:50] one of us is given Grace according to
[1:31:52] the measure of the gift of Christ now
[1:31:55] you know what's interesting I I I just
[1:31:58] want to be you know a little
[1:32:00] straightforward with
[1:32:03] you I'm such a
[1:32:06] knucklehead I think God's probably given
[1:32:08] me more grace than he gave most of
[1:32:12] you and I'm not going to ask if you
[1:32:14] agree cuz some of you might actually
[1:32:18] agree but you look at
[1:32:21] that maybe I to make my point maybe I
[1:32:25] got more grace than you did but I needed
[1:32:28] it
[1:32:29] right and God didn't say oh it's too bad
[1:32:32] I didn't give you enough
[1:32:34] Grace he's given
[1:32:37] us sufficient that's good thank you
[1:32:39] brother David
[1:32:42] enough can we believe the
[1:32:45] word should we believe the word then
[1:32:48] let's confess it that's right I made a
[1:32:51] mistake but I've been given enough Grace
[1:32:52] to overcome this mistake this life that
[1:32:55] God called me to I didn't call myself to
[1:32:57] this life he called me to this life and
[1:33:00] he's provided for every single thing
[1:33:02] that I need to make it through this life
[1:33:05] and come out and I don't care if I stood
[1:33:07] next to a brother who has been an
[1:33:08] absolute Saint his whole life never made
[1:33:11] any drastic mistakes never went off the
[1:33:13] rails never anything I stand there next
[1:33:15] to him I'm going to declare I'm just as
[1:33:18] much a Son of God as you are amen
[1:33:21] because I've been given Grace sufficient
[1:33:24] for my need and I'm going to stand here
[1:33:26] today and confess that because it was
[1:33:28] God's Gift Sir Paul didn't choose it
[1:33:30] Paul didn't make it happen it was God's
[1:33:33] Gift
[1:33:34] hallelujah amen now here I want to in
[1:33:37] verse eight if you'll just look at verse
[1:33:39] eight when he ascended up on
[1:33:43] high we always have all these problems
[1:33:46] and we blame the
[1:33:48] devil sometimes I think the devil's
[1:33:50] right out here on the step of the church
[1:33:54] well that step would be better CU he can
[1:33:56] sit on the
[1:33:57] steps he's out there
[1:34:00] crying cuz we blame him for things he
[1:34:04] knows he's not in control
[1:34:09] of boy y'all look at me with this sheep
[1:34:12] eyes well you're all sheep so
[1:34:16] you no he's getting blamed sometimes
[1:34:20] because you see right here if we could
[1:34:21] really believe the word for what it says
[1:34:23] he's already LED captivity amen captive
[1:34:29] amen captivity is not free reign in your
[1:34:34] life it is got a quote for it if you
[1:34:37] need it because we stepped out from
[1:34:40] underneath the
[1:34:43] blood now if we stepped out from
[1:34:45] underneath the blood where does that put
[1:34:51] us lukew
[1:34:58] a borderline
[1:35:02] garment hand out of the word foot out of
[1:35:05] the word it doesn't stop there erosion
[1:35:09] is
[1:35:10] eternal we believe the Earth was created
[1:35:14] right yeah did it look like it looks now
[1:35:16] when it was created think so
[1:35:20] no
[1:35:22] no so when you get out from underneath
[1:35:25] the blood just a
[1:35:28] finger if you don't change the course
[1:35:32] it'll soon be your
[1:35:34] hand and you don't change that course
[1:35:36] it'll soon be a
[1:35:38] foot and then we'll come to a place that
[1:35:40] marriages are in Jeopardy children have
[1:35:42] gone crazy everything is what we'd say
[1:35:46] why
[1:35:47] Lord but you see we allowed it to happen
[1:35:53] God's not going to grabb you Saints and
[1:35:56] drag you back
[1:35:58] under he might grab your
[1:36:00] heart but he's not going to cause your
[1:36:02] flesh to obey we get this idea that
[1:36:05] because we're in the message we believe
[1:36:06] God sent a Prophet this can't happen to
[1:36:09] us I'm here to tell you it can happen to
[1:36:15] us and it's time for us to wake up yeah
[1:36:18] amen have our own woke moment Amen to
[1:36:21] wake up to realize Satan not you we're
[1:36:24] not talking about you don't
[1:36:25] misunderstand that I'm talking about you
[1:36:27] Satan is so
[1:36:29] clever that he's going to give us a
[1:36:32] reason that's it and we fall into the
[1:36:35] Trap and then wonder why it
[1:36:39] is let me Skip Along
[1:36:41] here so as you look at
[1:36:45] this well how about maybe you guys would
[1:36:48] agree Ephesians 4:7 how about just
[1:36:51] Ephesians 4 homework
[1:36:54] go home read all of Ephesians 4 it's a
[1:36:57] tremendous chapter because it really
[1:37:00] gives insight to what is happening we
[1:37:04] look at this my brother and sister that
[1:37:06] we hear him been taught by him and the
[1:37:09] truth is in him amen that's where we
[1:37:12] need to stay and we got to remember
[1:37:15] captivity has been LED captive am
[1:37:20] there's not one thing here that you can
[1:37:22] offer as an excuse of why you're not on
[1:37:25] fire for God and if you don't mind I'll
[1:37:28] just point these fingers right back at
[1:37:30] Paul amen because I'm not here to preach
[1:37:33] down to you I'm here to give the warning
[1:37:35] God laid on my heart that if we're not
[1:37:38] careful this will creep into our
[1:37:41] lives and we won't even recognize it
[1:37:44] won't even recognize
[1:37:48] it
[1:37:50] h down in Florida
[1:37:53] woman disappeared she was walking across
[1:37:56] the Lawn Lawn and all fell
[1:37:59] in
[1:38:01] gone giant hole in the ground right
[1:38:03] there not one bit of sight of that
[1:38:10] woman
[1:38:12] Satan I'm going to type this natural
[1:38:15] spiritual been eroding
[1:38:17] away not
[1:38:19] overnight for years turns out there's
[1:38:22] Cavern there
[1:38:26] and all that was the dirt that we were
[1:38:28] secure to walk on and live in
[1:38:30] and just slowly eroding
[1:38:33] away and then
[1:38:37] poof they're not going to go search for
[1:38:40] it because there's weird noises down
[1:38:41] there and it has twists and turns and
[1:38:44] they're like well don't know that we
[1:38:47] should sacrifice someone when it's
[1:38:49] pretty obvious that her and all the dirt
[1:38:52] completely disappeared
[1:38:55] my brother and sister people disappear
[1:38:57] out of the
[1:38:58] church like this and we say did we
[1:39:01] offend them maybe someone did but the
[1:39:04] scripture says that we don't take
[1:39:08] offense oh did I step on something I
[1:39:11] shouldn't
[1:39:13] have cuz I want to ask you I I just feel
[1:39:17] very if you take offense maybe they
[1:39:20] shouldn't have said what they said done
[1:39:22] what they did
[1:39:24] did but the real Spirit to take offense
[1:39:27] is our
[1:39:29] spirit God help us Satan slippery coming
[1:39:35] right in breaks off Fellowship we blame
[1:39:38] the other person we blame the pastor we
[1:39:40] blame this we blame that why don't we
[1:39:43] just stop look in the mirror and
[1:39:45] say why was I offended about
[1:39:50] that maybe if we would humble ourselves
[1:39:53] and
[1:39:54] repent restoration would come God help
[1:39:57] us
[1:39:59] H so if Ephesians if you would take it
[1:40:02] as homework
[1:40:04] please now I've got so many scriptures
[1:40:07] it tells us not to be in Romans 12 not
[1:40:10] to be conformed to the world but be
[1:40:12] transformed conformed is to comply with
[1:40:16] and transformed is to be changed see
[1:40:19] there a lot of difference right there my
[1:40:20] brother and sister when the world molds
[1:40:23] you
[1:40:24] and when Christ molds you are they even
[1:40:26] similar no no they do not produce the
[1:40:29] same results Romans 12 1 through3 now
[1:40:33] count down please brother
[1:40:35] Chris
[1:40:41] amen oh this screen
[1:40:45] has okay doesn't matter about this
[1:40:49] screen but now friends may I say this
[1:40:52] has come to the age of the astronaut we
[1:40:54] have moved out of the airplane age we
[1:40:56] got more power now now remember that
[1:40:59] this is a prophet of God not teaching us
[1:41:01] aerodynamics it's the prophet of God
[1:41:03] preaching word to us we've moved out of
[1:41:06] the airplane age we got more power now
[1:41:08] the astronaut age has come in what is it
[1:41:11] not we've come into a spiritual age of
[1:41:14] astronauts see going above it's not this
[1:41:18] it it's not it's the same Spirit only
[1:41:21] more power right you know you can preach
[1:41:24] that the the the word has changed and
[1:41:26] the bride this and the bride that but
[1:41:28] God just took his Eternal Word and just
[1:41:30] poured more power in it and when he
[1:41:32] poured power in it my brother and sister
[1:41:34] it was actually you and I that
[1:41:39] changed only more power only lifted
[1:41:41] higher can go higher see more believe
[1:41:44] more be more like Christ not the O
[1:41:47] automobile not the horse and buggy not
[1:41:49] even the airplane but the astronaut he
[1:41:51] sweeps on and above each one it's called
[1:41:55] The Eagle age in the Bible God calls His
[1:41:58] prophets Eagle age we realize over in
[1:42:00] the Bible we find in Malachi 4 that were
[1:42:03] promised that in the last days now he
[1:42:05] likes His prophets to Eagles he calls
[1:42:09] himself Eagle he is the great Jehovah
[1:42:11] Eagle he is able to achieve to himself a
[1:42:15] bride that right there is a startling
[1:42:17] statement he is able to achieve to
[1:42:21] himself a bride
[1:42:25] but wait we have prophets
[1:42:29] teachers evangelists
[1:42:33] pastors every one of them is God's
[1:42:38] achievement our pastor is the greatest
[1:42:41] Pastor
[1:42:44] ever okay I wouldn't even
[1:42:47] argue it's just God if he is the best
[1:42:50] preacher ever it's just
[1:42:52] God so when we go to give praise we're
[1:42:55] going to give praise to God that's right
[1:42:57] there's where it comes
[1:42:59] down amen uh that with a ministry that's
[1:43:02] so exactly like a man and his wife
[1:43:04] becomes one and when Jehovah gets his
[1:43:07] people like
[1:43:08] him he's working to get us like
[1:43:11] him then he lives in his
[1:43:14] people ain't that awesome such
[1:43:18] Simplicity yeah praise God I am
[1:43:21] different than the world out here amen
[1:43:23] Hallelujah God lives in me amen thank
[1:43:25] you Lord I mean my it goes to prove you
[1:43:29] know some he lives in a 20 room house
[1:43:32] and some he lives in a little dinky
[1:43:35] Shack on the side of whatever but he's
[1:43:37] living in
[1:43:40] me but we like the more
[1:43:42] spiritual we like the better dressed all
[1:43:46] quotes right you know what I'm talking
[1:43:50] about but God said God said
[1:43:53] prophet's voice it'll make that silk
[1:43:57] dress hug that gingham gown that's right
[1:44:01] cuz it's not the external cloak it's
[1:44:05] Christ Living in the
[1:44:09] person lives in his people they are one
[1:44:12] it fulfills the scripture exactly like
[1:44:13] he said in St John 14:12 he that
[1:44:16] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:44:17] shall he do also it also fulfilled what
[1:44:20] Jesus said to take place as it was in
[1:44:22] the days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[1:44:24] coming of the son of man now I want to
[1:44:25] ask you a question right here we're
[1:44:27] fixing the close sister Ruth as you'll
[1:44:30] come Whoever thought it would come this
[1:44:35] far I can remember years ago we were
[1:44:38] still over in the other building I
[1:44:41] preached this is Sodom the rapture's
[1:44:43] coming soon cuz it can't get any
[1:44:47] worse I laugh at myself now because I
[1:44:50] missed that Mark like so far can't get
[1:44:53] any
[1:44:53] worse my brother and sister back in them
[1:44:56] days pronoun was part of writing a
[1:44:58] sentence
[1:45:00] yeah and now it's a whole identity right
[1:45:04] perverted one but still an identity see
[1:45:07] so we're coming into the Fulfillment now
[1:45:10] do you
[1:45:11] realize as much as you who wants to
[1:45:14] volunteer husband and wife to be the
[1:45:16] victim I mean the
[1:45:19] example as much as we fuss as husband
[1:45:22] and wife
[1:45:25] [Music]
[1:45:27] When God says you're
[1:45:29] perfect you're
[1:45:32] perfect it's not the husband's
[1:45:36] fault it's not the wife's
[1:45:39] fault it's the flesh
[1:45:44] amen I'm just want to stir your minds
[1:45:48] up what
[1:45:50] if the bride as we spoke on
[1:45:55] job righteous and upright man and God
[1:45:58] still tests
[1:45:59] him what if we're in just the continued
[1:46:03] time of
[1:46:05] testing and God's actually waiting for
[1:46:08] Sodom to come to
[1:46:12] fruition see often times we preach it
[1:46:15] like oh we've got to get ourselves ready
[1:46:17] get ourselves ready I want to ask you my
[1:46:20] brother and
[1:46:21] sister if you have have the idea that
[1:46:23] Enoch and job and all of those men never
[1:46:27] made a
[1:46:28] mistake you're
[1:46:32] mistaken and God called them righteous
[1:46:34] and upright and men after his own
[1:46:40] heart I'm not trying to tell us to let
[1:46:44] down actually this should cause us to
[1:46:46] just turn it up a little
[1:46:48] bit but you see Satan wants you to
[1:46:50] believe it's your fault
[1:46:53] oh yeah you're the one you're inadequate
[1:46:57] you're
[1:46:58] unworthy but God said you're worthy
[1:47:01] that's right God said he's put
[1:47:02] everything in you that you need Amen to
[1:47:05] make it in this
[1:47:07] journey amen so don't let Satan turn
[1:47:11] this back on you that you're not good
[1:47:15] enough and will never be good
[1:47:18] enough God could be letting I'm just
[1:47:21] saying this in a context God could be
[1:47:23] letting the last little bit of the cup
[1:47:26] of
[1:47:27] iniquity to be filled
[1:47:32] up CU I don't want to blow you away but
[1:47:35] I want to put this out to
[1:47:37] you do you not face some of the same
[1:47:40] battles today that you faced a year
[1:47:43] [Music]
[1:47:46] ago you not have Satan try to build a
[1:47:50] nest in your head today just like he did
[1:47:53] a year
[1:47:57] ago are you going to stop the devil from
[1:47:59] trying to build a nest in your
[1:48:02] head
[1:48:04] no
[1:48:06] no but the prophet said when he's
[1:48:10] trying you don't let him that's right so
[1:48:13] does that mean that battle's going
[1:48:15] away I think it will get more intense
[1:48:18] myself cuz Satan sees you for who you
[1:48:22] are
[1:48:24] and he wants to stop you and if he has
[1:48:27] to just ratchet it up and cause you
[1:48:31] battle after battle struggle after
[1:48:34] struggle whether he wants to come in the
[1:48:36] mind and fight with you if he wants to
[1:48:38] come in the flesh sickness and disease
[1:48:41] and fight with
[1:48:47] you you see it's a balanced picture
[1:48:53] Prophet says you'll be ready right on
[1:48:56] time why don't we accept that part of
[1:48:59] the message we will be ready right on
[1:49:06] time
[1:49:07] Saints don't let the devil pull it over
[1:49:10] on you take a hold to the promised word
[1:49:13] stand upon that word and realize now let
[1:49:16] me finish this real quick and then we're
[1:49:18] done as it was in the days of Sodom so
[1:49:20] shall it be at the coming of the son of
[1:49:21] man I have to admit I never quite
[1:49:25] thought
[1:49:26] Sodom looked like this but this is
[1:49:29] Sodom so it shall be in the coming of
[1:49:32] son of man now is the astronaut age and
[1:49:34] the astronaut sees things that the horse
[1:49:36] rider automobile and airplane either
[1:49:39] sees so truly in this day by the words
[1:49:42] of a prophet we're seeing more of the
[1:49:44] word of God than they have in any
[1:49:48] age and you notice the scripture doesn't
[1:49:50] say that our day
[1:49:55] without
[1:49:56] them it says them without us that's
[1:50:01] right so when you feel defeated you feel
[1:50:04] struggle you have these things remember
[1:50:06] God chose His best for the most wicked
[1:50:09] age that the Earth will ever
[1:50:14] see Apostle Paul have more value than
[1:50:17] [Music]
[1:50:20] you no
[1:50:24] sounds boastful doesn't
[1:50:26] it but it's the
[1:50:29] truth God used them to set the gospel
[1:50:33] and they live the gospel for their day
[1:50:35] and you're sitting here
[1:50:37] today in the most deceiving darkest age
[1:50:42] ever and God's Shining Light On You amen
[1:50:46] Revelation amen is opening up to you who
[1:50:49] you are amen hold on to it Church don't
[1:50:52] let the devil take that away from you
[1:50:55] the airplane still down here bouncing
[1:50:56] around in the clouds and having blowouts
[1:50:58] and hit downs and everything else but he
[1:51:00] goes beyond the clouds of Creeds and
[1:51:02] denomination moves on up in the heavens
[1:51:04] Plum away from everything the astronaut
[1:51:06] age we are living in the astronaut age
[1:51:09] amen my church age book you know the
[1:51:13] astronaut age is in
[1:51:16] there so seven Church ages but we have a
[1:51:19] you know kind of like government
[1:51:20] regulations we have a subpart b
[1:51:23] part
[1:51:24] 131 well I'm telling you the astronaut
[1:51:27] age is in there amen God is giving it
[1:51:31] we're living the aster just as sure as
[1:51:33] God is testified by the natural
[1:51:35] happenings there so is he testifying now
[1:51:38] that if if we've achieved an astronaut
[1:51:41] God has achieved what he promised to
[1:51:44] achieve in the last days according to
[1:51:46] Malachi 4 only one thing he has to do is
[1:51:49] get
[1:51:50] somebody any somebody's here
[1:51:53] get somebody in his hands that can cut
[1:51:56] loose from the airplanes and the
[1:51:57] Automobiles and what more not not look
[1:52:01] back to what it was come on Saints let's
[1:52:03] bring this let's bring this message
[1:52:05] these words of a prophet let's bring
[1:52:07] them current to this day right here but
[1:52:10] how come on I I don't I'm not being
[1:52:11] negative I don't mean to be but what do
[1:52:14] we we often times we're referring back
[1:52:17] amen we're looking at the power the
[1:52:19] manifestation of the word we're looking
[1:52:21] back why not not look up and claim it
[1:52:23] for
[1:52:24] oursel why not allow us did the prophet
[1:52:28] himself not say that we have now a
[1:52:30] second book of
[1:52:34] Acts if we were writing the second book
[1:52:36] of Acts I wonder what it would look
[1:52:40] like I rebuked the fever and the fever
[1:52:42] didn't go away why
[1:52:46] Lord I feel defeated all the time lord
[1:52:48] and seems to be no end in sight why Lord
[1:52:52] would that be our book of Acts
[1:52:55] absolutely not Saints it's time for us
[1:52:57] to get out of the horse and buggy and
[1:53:01] start moving forward maybe our life
[1:53:03] testifies it let's let our voice testify
[1:53:06] it am I preaching too
[1:53:11] long thank you cuz sometimes it only
[1:53:13] takes
[1:53:19] one lift him up in the presence but more
[1:53:21] power
[1:53:23] okay not look back to what it was but
[1:53:25] more power to lift him higher lift him
[1:53:27] into the presence of God lift him up
[1:53:29] there where all things are possible now
[1:53:32] see it's happening there is no doubt to
[1:53:35] it so does the spiritual astronaut as
[1:53:38] the natural astronaut goes on above the
[1:53:40] Plaines the planes always wrecking up
[1:53:43] fussing in the clouds everything like
[1:53:45] that there can be nothing greater no
[1:53:47] more achievement than the
[1:53:49] astronaut amen do I need need to
[1:53:52] interpret that for you or did you get
[1:53:56] it there is no greater
[1:54:01] achievement than
[1:54:05] you it's time we believe
[1:54:08] that instead of looking at the negative
[1:54:11] and looking at what's wrong in our
[1:54:13] life God chose you you are the greater
[1:54:17] achievement amen amen
[1:54:22] only thing he has to do is just keep
[1:54:24] putting more power he'll go anywhere he
[1:54:26] wants to see because he's done gone into
[1:54:29] space isn't this beautiful airplanes
[1:54:32] still down wrecking fussing grounded
[1:54:35] everything like that but the astronaut
[1:54:37] don't have to be grounded he goes on
[1:54:39] above the clouds he goes on on above
[1:54:43] above the Creed on above the
[1:54:44] denomination on above those who Say It
[1:54:46] Isn't So It Isn't So he has got a guide
[1:54:49] the Holy Spirit the word tells him so am
[1:54:52] and he moves
[1:54:55] on Amen let's stand I know I preached
[1:54:58] way too long and I I
[1:55:00] apologize amen but look at this my
[1:55:04] brother and sister you see what's what's
[1:55:05] the word

[1:55:19] forward Ephesians 1 we'll just go for
[1:55:22] verse six here to the praise of the
[1:55:24] glory of his grace wherein he hath made
[1:55:27] us accepted in the Beloved see we've

[1:56:02] to let it just soak
[1:56:04] in just trusting God dealing with
[1:56:08] us you
[1:56:10] see I think Saints forgive me but I
[1:56:14] think we still got a few things to let
