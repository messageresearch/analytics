[34:08] amen
[34:10] you know we're in the back just speaking
[34:12] for a moment and i asked jay what is the
[34:15] songs you're singing tonight he says
[34:17] i'm not going to let you see because
[34:19] you're going to tell me hot
[34:21] that's what i'm preaching on
[34:26] well whether i saw him or not
[34:28] we've talked about we and we've talked
[34:30] about manifested with oh anyway i'll
[34:33] just preach it to you
[34:35] amen good to be here tonight
[34:37] hallelujah love the lord thank him for
[34:39] his grace and mercy
[34:41] amen let's just stand as we go into the
[34:44] word
[34:44] it's been actually almost exactly a
[34:47] month since i speak
[34:48] i spoke the first part of we are
[34:50] witnesses
[34:51] but uh
[34:53] just uh in reading my bible my daily
[34:56] readings i just um
[34:58] you know come across these scripture and
[35:00] it just stirred my heart made me so
[35:02] happy
[35:03] i got to thinking as i as i read this
[35:06] what a personal gospel
[35:09] this is not an impersonal blanket that's
[35:11] been just thrown over the people and but
[35:14] this has become a
[35:16] personal
[35:18] gospel and people might say no now we we
[35:21] question this and we question that and
[35:23] you know if we didn't have
[35:26] anything but a
[35:28] universal understanding
[35:31] we might stop and say
[35:33] oh yeah okay
[35:36] but when it's personal
[35:38] and someone says there's no power in
[35:40] this message
[35:41] and you're like
[35:42] this changed my life
[35:44] people say well we wonder if god's still
[35:46] a healer and you're standing there
[35:48] saying he healed me
[35:50] and people say well you know i've just
[35:52] been bothered by spirits my whole life
[35:56] and you're there god's delivered me
[35:59] a personal gospel
[36:02] how beautiful that is that god didn't
[36:04] say i'm just gonna throw out something
[36:06] kind of with lots of little voids and
[36:08] little holes and you're gonna have to
[36:10] surmise and you're gonna have to try and
[36:12] put this together
[36:14] but he said no i'm gonna
[36:16] create a personal
[36:18] message
[36:20] let's turn in our bibles
[36:22] this morning
[36:24] this evening
[36:25] tonight
[36:29] i'll get on the right page first john
[36:31] the first chapter
[36:33] now as we're looking at these scriptures
[36:35] saints i
[36:37] i hope you don't mind i'm kind of happy
[36:39] in my heart today i've got to sit on a
[36:40] tractor all day and there's not much
[36:42] better than that for a job
[36:44] and um you know you look at this and and
[36:47] uh
[36:48] there's a whole bunch more verses that
[36:49] were there and i was like
[36:51] hallelujah preach it all to him little
[36:54] voice says
[36:56] just
[36:57] give them a little bit
[36:59] because a little bit is sufficient so
[37:02] anyway i i cut the other half a dozen
[37:05] verses off and i trust that tonight this
[37:08] will speak to your heart
[37:09] first john 1 1
[37:11] that which was from the beginning
[37:15] and feel free to say amen and oh my and
[37:18] whatever else that you feel like saying
[37:21] that
[37:22] which was from the beginning which we
[37:25] have heard
[37:27] which we have seen with our eyes
[37:31] which we have looked upon
[37:34] and our hands have handled
[37:39] not of silver not of gold
[37:42] not of other precious treasure
[37:45] but of the word
[37:46] of life
[37:49] no greater treasure on this earth
[37:52] and god has allowed us to handle it
[37:57] for the life was manifested
[37:59] and we have seen it and bear witness
[38:03] and show unto you that eternal life
[38:06] which was with the father and was
[38:09] manifested unto us
[38:12] so it's not saints still something that
[38:14] we're grasping out into the future
[38:18] and i say to those tonight
[38:22] if there's things that you look at and
[38:24] say i don't have an answer for
[38:27] you just keep praying
[38:29] our god is an on
[38:33] he is not leaving this as it were as a
[38:36] myth for us a vapor for us to just keep
[38:39] trying to grasp
[38:41] but he wants to make it
[38:43] a personal
[38:44] gospel
[38:51] stick to your words paul
[38:53] hallelujah for the life was manifested
[38:56] and we have seen it
[38:58] i love that
[39:00] and now to just add words in there
[39:03] because it is in a context we bear
[39:05] witness so it's no longer we look back
[39:07] and say the apostle paul was faithful
[39:10] john was faithful brother branham was
[39:12] faithful
[39:13] we are faithful
[39:16] and showing to you that eternal life
[39:18] which was with the father was manifested
[39:20] unto us that which we have seen and
[39:22] heard declare we unto you
[39:25] that ye also may have fellowship with us
[39:29] truly our fellowship is with the father
[39:31] and with his son jesus christ and these
[39:35] things right we unto you that your joy
[39:38] may be full
[39:40] heavenly father we ask you lord just to
[39:42] speak through your word to us tonight
[39:45] make this so real father we walk out
[39:47] tonight with the joy just bubbling up
[39:50] within us lord to realize how blessed we
[39:53] are in the day that we live father not
[39:57] lord just sitting here tonight with
[39:59] religion
[40:00] the father we're sitting here tonight
[40:02] with you
[40:03] and father the very spirit lord that you
[40:06] said you would pour out upon your people
[40:08] father has been poured out and we are
[40:11] the recipients and i say tonight thank
[40:13] you lord
[40:15] thank you father
[40:16] we ask this in the name of jesus christ
[40:19] amen
[40:20] you may be seated
[40:26] now i want to just take just a moment
[40:28] tonight and and just go down through
[40:30] this
[40:31] um
[40:33] and just kind of the things that reached
[40:34] out and spoke to my heart and i trust
[40:37] that they would
[40:38] now some of the songs that we sang
[40:40] tonight um you know yes i would be
[40:42] cherry-picking to say oh oh manifested
[40:45] was in this song and and we here and
[40:48] this here and but i'm telling you it did
[40:51] speak to my heart and i'll look at this
[40:53] as we go into the first verse that which
[40:56] was from the beginning which we have
[40:58] heard my brother and sister when we look
[41:00] at this we realize that the word that we
[41:03] are living in today and we are living in
[41:05] the word right it's not just in an age
[41:07] of the word we are living in the word
[41:11] and if we're not in the word saints then
[41:13] we need to stop and ponder what it is we
[41:15] are doing because we don't want to spend
[41:18] our time in this age just under an
[41:20] anointing of a cloak of religion
[41:23] many people live under the cloak of
[41:25] religion and they're comfortable there
[41:27] because there's not much sacrifice
[41:29] required to live under the cloak now
[41:31] remember if you do this and i'm sorry i
[41:33] kind of that my own studies have done
[41:35] this but my brother and sister there's a
[41:37] lot of a lot of stuff that goes back
[41:40] into the old roman catholic church and
[41:43] and i say the old roman is still
[41:45] prevalent here today but many times my
[41:48] brother and sister the symbolic side of
[41:50] it was that a priest
[41:53] you know living a life that they lived
[41:55] and you know what they did is they put
[41:57] on this cloak or this gown this robe or
[42:00] whatever you want to call it when they
[42:02] went to preach and symbolically it was
[42:05] covering them in the flesh so therefore
[42:08] they could come as a holy man to the
[42:09] people but you see i thank god in the
[42:12] hour we live in that he's come and the
[42:15] holy ghost is what is cloaking this
[42:17] flesh it is not some robe it is not some
[42:20] other thing but it is christ himself
[42:23] covering this flesh he says i have
[42:25] covered you with my blood amen and my
[42:28] own precious blood is sufficient that i
[42:31] think is a new niv but you look at that
[42:33] and realize the beauty of that my
[42:35] brother and sister not a garment that we
[42:37] put on with everything being a symbolism
[42:41] but the holy ghost takes all symbolism
[42:43] away and is reality
[42:45] amen and that's the life i like that's
[42:47] the life i want to live it's a life of
[42:50] reality amen so we have from the
[42:53] beginning now my brother and sister is i
[42:55] speak on these things i i talking uh
[42:58] talking with brother david for just a
[43:00] moment today uh he'll be ministering for
[43:03] you this coming sunday but uh my brother
[43:06] and sister look at the spirits of the
[43:07] day we have a cancel culture
[43:10] we have a woke culture we have all these
[43:12] cultures
[43:13] now i want you to take and not get too
[43:16] crazy about this but i want you to just
[43:18] take and ponder this and realize how
[43:21] each one of these things that's
[43:22] happening is
[43:24] symbolistic of what is happening in the
[43:27] bride i'm telling you as never before in
[43:30] our generation the bride is waking up
[43:32] she is woke
[43:34] amen she is coming to a reality of who
[43:37] she is and the fact that the word is the
[43:40] prophet of god says when you catch that
[43:42] revelation the bible will be a brand new
[43:45] book to you and i believe it's happening
[43:48] i know so many people that are like
[43:50] coming out of a fog coming out of a i
[43:52] don't know what you would say just a
[43:54] days as it were and getting sincere and
[43:57] talking with brothers and they're
[43:58] talking about hey there's people that
[44:00] were part of this church 25 years ago
[44:03] and they just walked in the door this
[44:05] last sunday and sat down and said i've
[44:07] been miserable for 25 years and i just
[44:10] have to turn my heart back to the lord
[44:12] and we're seeing an awakening taking
[44:14] place and we see a cancel culture my
[44:17] brother and sister where they're on all
[44:19] this social media stuff and maybe it has
[44:21] its place it just don't have a place in
[44:23] my life so much but you look at this and
[44:25] you see my brother and sister this
[44:27] cancel culture and satan is there saying
[44:30] these people are speaking truth cancel
[44:31] them but i'm telling you it's exactly
[44:33] the opposite it's the holy ghost coming
[44:35] down on this same bride that is waking
[44:38] up and she's cancelling satan's voice in
[44:41] her life
[44:42] she's saying that voice no longer has an
[44:44] influence it no longer has a place his
[44:47] behavior has no longer a place in my
[44:49] life and his spirit has no place in my
[44:52] life and there it is but satan comes
[44:54] verbalizes it vocalizes it blows it up
[44:57] and the world's all caught up in the
[44:59] canceled culture my brother and sister
[45:01] the bride is caught up in this canceled
[45:03] culture she is there saying i am
[45:05] finished with the voices of laodicea i'm
[45:08] finished with the spirit of laodicea and
[45:11] i'm going to move forward and serve the
[45:13] lord with all of my heart
[45:15] amen so you see as we look at this what
[45:18] was from the beginning was the original
[45:20] word and so all in the original word my
[45:23] brother and sister that is encapsulated
[45:25] if you would say in the original word
[45:27] has been manifested and has been given
[45:30] back to the bride of christ in our
[45:32] generation all put in order you might
[45:35] say pardon me for putting it this way
[45:37] but god even delivered it with a nice
[45:39] little ribbon around it
[45:44] you know who it came from
[45:47] the signature the card the words
[45:50] all are identified
[45:54] hallelujah i would sure hope that a
[45:56] young man courting a
[45:58] girl she wouldn't open a card
[46:03] and be like
[46:04] i wonder who this is from
[46:10] he's cute blue eyes blond hair curly
[46:13] he's this he's that
[46:16] you see courting is not a random affair
[46:21] are you with me
[46:23] it's serious business you ought to know
[46:24] who's courting you and who you're
[46:26] courting
[46:27] amen the lord jesus christ has been
[46:29] courting the bride of this age for
[46:31] centuries
[46:41] now would you participate with me
[46:42] tonight
[46:44] who has seen with their own eyes
[46:47] hallelujah
[46:48] we don't have to say now pastor is this
[46:51] true
[46:54] we've seen it with our own eyes
[46:58] which we've looked upon
[47:00] my brother and sister we
[47:02] are
[47:03] as the scripture says a chosen
[47:05] generation we're a special people
[47:08] we're the we're the apple of his eye and
[47:11] and he has come and revealed himself now
[47:14] understand the opening of the word is
[47:16] the revelation of jesus christ himself
[47:20] it is not just another religious deal
[47:22] this is why people say well why what is
[47:24] so important about the seventh seal
[47:26] being open my brother and sister that's
[47:28] his love letter to the bride in our day
[47:31] and we ought to know who wrote the love
[47:33] letter to us
[47:35] and we don't want it to be a church or
[47:36] some ministry or some person here we
[47:39] need to know who wrote that love letter
[47:41] to us and the seventh seal was the
[47:44] opening of the plan of redemption where
[47:46] he said i've come oh i hope you're with
[47:48] me i've come not just to redeem your
[47:50] soul but i've come to give you my name
[47:56] oh my brother and sister that that stirs
[47:59] my heart when he said i love you enough
[48:01] i'm going to give you my name
[48:05] hallelujah
[48:08] and our hands of handle
[48:10] of the word of life
[48:13] believe or not still
[48:15] the top-selling book
[48:17] in the
[48:18] world but how many
[48:21] read this book
[48:24] and it means almost nothing to them
[48:30] do you realize how special you are
[48:33] because you see the love letter
[48:36] that i wrote to jerry
[48:39] is universal in one sense
[48:42] she's got a
[48:43] box or two full of them
[48:46] i don't know this younger generation how
[48:48] they're going to store their
[48:50] love texts
[48:56] maybe
[48:57] maybe we'll have to have some courtship
[48:59] classes and
[49:00] remind the young men young women when
[49:02] you're serious about that boy or that
[49:04] girl that nothing replaces a pen and a
[49:08] paper
[49:10] yeah
[49:12] somewhere on a zip file i have all my
[49:15] love text
[49:20] god said i'm going to write it down
[49:23] you can handle it every
[49:25] single day in fact i actually want to
[49:28] commission you to pull it out every
[49:31] single day
[49:33] and read my love letter
[49:37] see how beautiful it is so if you need
[49:38] an example of why you should write a
[49:40] letter
[49:42] god started off writing a love letter
[49:45] to you and i
[49:47] hallelujah
[49:48] so you look at this and realize my
[49:50] brother and sister god loved us so much
[49:52] that he just let us lay our hands
[49:55] directly to the word of life and we can
[49:56] take that back into luther's day and
[49:58] people would say you know now where was
[50:00] luther out in all of this and he still
[50:03] smoked and drank beer and did whatever
[50:05] but my brother and sister you understand
[50:07] but part of the significance of what god
[50:09] did was god said i am going to use him
[50:13] to put this word into the letter form
[50:16] that every man could handle
[50:19] amen i've just knocked my mic off and it
[50:21] won't let go of my belt and i'm sorry
[50:26] but look at this how it is to be able to
[50:28] handle the word of life it should should
[50:31] be such a thrill to us to know that god
[50:35] loved us enough to literally lay this
[50:37] love letter right down into our hands
[50:40] that we could possess it hold it cry
[50:43] over it
[50:45] worship with it
[50:47] amen
[50:49] be strengthened encouraged and corrected
[50:53] how beautiful is that yes brother chris
[50:55] come help me
[50:57] i'm suffering from old men's eyes and i
[51:00] can't see and
[51:02] so you look at this now i in verse 2 i
[51:04] want to just hurry along for the life
[51:07] was manifested
[51:09] now my brother and sister i've had folks
[51:10] kind of get up to me you know and say
[51:12] well you you just overdo this manifested
[51:16] but my brother and sister i want you to
[51:17] think about this thank you brother chris
[51:19] i want you to think about this if we
[51:21] talk about how that there is a word of
[51:24] god for our day there is a life an
[51:26] opening of the word but if we can't
[51:29] really see the evidence of it how long
[51:32] before we get discouraged
[51:34] how long before
[51:36] we're hearing about a healer but we
[51:38] never see anyone healed we're hearing
[51:40] about a deliverance but there's never
[51:42] seemingly a deliverance see we as humans
[51:45] were designed in such a fashion that god
[51:48] said i know that you will need the
[51:50] evidence i know that you will need the
[51:53] tangible to be able as humans right this
[51:56] is not believer unbeliever this is
[51:59] humans
[52:00] and so we need to see god move in our
[52:02] midst and so when you see my brother and
[52:05] sister as it were in the world we're
[52:06] living in today and and
[52:09] being toned down toned down toned down
[52:11] to where you know we're a christian if
[52:13] we acknowledge there's a god
[52:18] but where's the other side
[52:22] see even that's a two-headed sword
[52:25] because if we don't accept the freedom
[52:27] it may as well be supposed to
[52:33] but we should be able to declare
[52:36] i have been set free
[52:38] the chains
[52:39] are broken amen
[52:43] see a very personal gospel
[52:47] hallelujah
[52:48] might not mean much to somebody who's
[52:50] lived a very tame life
[52:53] but
[52:54] it's a little homework go
[52:57] see what the scripture says about
[52:58] imaginations
[53:00] they never robbed the bank or threatened
[53:02] the life or done anything ridiculous
[53:04] outside there but the scripture looks at
[53:07] what our mind conjures
[53:12] we have to be able to take a hold of
[53:14] that and say
[53:16] mind
[53:18] as much as it seems difficult
[53:21] i am putting you under subjection
[53:24] to the word
[53:26] oh i can hear the birds fluttering now
[53:30] no problem we'll just keep swatting them
[53:31] away they're not going to make a nest
[53:35] see a personal gospel you say well my my
[53:37] mind goes this way another person say my
[53:39] mind goes this way but it doesn't matter
[53:42] god's in control
[53:43] for the life was manifested
[53:45] and we've never had an evidence of it
[53:48] and
[53:49] no no my brother and sister it's very
[53:51] evident in the day that we live in
[53:53] and if you'll be honest with yourself
[53:55] it's very evident in your life that
[53:57] you're not the same individual that you
[53:59] were
[54:00] in the past
[54:04] so
[54:05] all of this comes and what does it bring
[54:07] us to in the second verse
[54:09] is that god my brother and sister let me
[54:11] if you'll give me liberty with the word
[54:13] god said i didn't do all of this for you
[54:16] then to walk around under your little
[54:17] personal cloud of woe is me but i did
[54:21] all of this for you i opened your eyes i
[54:24] took you to walk in the light i've
[54:26] healed you i saved you i have given you
[54:29] peace i've done all of this now i have a
[54:31] requirement from you
[54:33] and that is that you'll stand up and
[54:34] bear witness
[54:36] you see the witness my brother and
[54:38] sister is very important
[54:40] because the case cannot be compelled
[54:44] without witnesses
[54:47] and whether the witness is true or false
[54:49] must
[54:50] be brought forth
[54:58] been amazing
[55:01] how that we can have god do so much in
[55:02] our life and i'm not chiding you church
[55:04] but i'm just saying god can do so much
[55:06] in our life
[55:08] and we can so carefully hide that
[55:12] that you can be healed and no one knows
[55:13] you can be delivered and no one knows
[55:15] you can have prayers answered and no one
[55:17] knows
[55:18] that's bearing witness but not
[55:26] it should be a vocal gospel
[55:29] that the world knows god healed me
[55:32] you don't have to give the gritty
[55:34] details
[55:35] go on answering a prayer about how i
[55:38] and pretty soon people are like look
[55:39] like they've been nuclear
[55:42] okay brother
[55:44] wonderful
[55:47] but you see if it's that person's
[55:48] experience it's that person's life he's
[55:51] thrilled that god's delivered him from a
[55:52] murdering spirit
[55:54] or whatever spirit it might be to him
[55:56] see so we have to have a little judgment
[55:58] but my brother and sister i tell you you
[56:00] get around the world and you get to talk
[56:02] to people and you'll find out that
[56:05] life's a little grittier under the
[56:06] surface than many of us experience
[56:10] the brother back east i've mentioned him
[56:13] here before
[56:14] heard the message in prison
[56:17] north carolina
[56:19] maximum maximum security prison
[56:25] for taking a man's life
[56:31] wow
[56:33] how can that be
[56:35] it's a personal gospel
[56:38] and god brought word truth life right
[56:41] down into the maximum maximum security
[56:44] placed it in his hand
[56:47] and he read it
[56:48] and said this
[56:50] is truth amen
[56:52] and then god
[56:54] i'm going to use the word manufactured
[56:56] his way out of prison
[56:59] god come and took it from life plus
[57:04] to
[57:06] we have seen such a change in you
[57:09] and your case has been brought before a
[57:10] parole board
[57:12] and they
[57:13] are going to release you
[57:16] now tell me my brother and sister does
[57:18] our god
[57:20] not want to make this personal
[57:22] it's not a blanket gospel he just threw
[57:25] out i want you to realize tonight that
[57:27] no matter what maybe the preaching of
[57:29] the word maybe brother paul preached
[57:31] something and it kind of went ouch with
[57:33] you and you look at that now look erase
[57:36] paul out of there now
[57:38] and put in there god cares enough about
[57:40] me
[57:41] to speak to these little things in my
[57:43] life that maybe aren't quite lining up
[57:46] it isn't paul
[57:48] it isn't paul come on
[57:50] because every list of faults i could
[57:52] prepare on you you could prepare one
[57:54] just as great greater on me
[57:57] it is not about that it's the personal
[57:59] gospel of jesus christ coming to you and
[58:02] i say i am leading you i am guiding you
[58:05] all the things i spoke in my word
[58:08] concerning you i will fulfill them and
[58:12] it must become personal
[58:15] i hope you catch that personal can be
[58:17] everything the way we do our hair uh the
[58:19] clothes we wear
[58:21] our language our attitudes and god will
[58:23] come and deal with that because he's a
[58:25] personal god
[58:31] can you imagine now
[58:34] off track just a little bit but these
[58:35] are thoughts that i deal with
[58:39] you show up to peter at the gates
[58:42] and peter says
[58:45] hey you know you've got everything else
[58:47] right
[58:50] and i feel really bad i feel really
[58:53] really bad because i wanted to talk to
[58:55] you about your attitude but i was afraid
[58:58] i would offend you
[59:00] and um anyway because of your attitude i
[59:02] can't let you in
[59:12] did i make my point
[59:15] you would say
[59:16] lord or peter whatever
[59:19] why didn't somebody deal with my
[59:21] attitude
[59:23] i would have changed my attitude but it
[59:25] never got dealt with
[59:28] see that would be an unjust god wouldn't
[59:32] an unjust god but our god's not just
[59:35] but he's also a god that doesn't have
[59:37] excuses
[59:39] amen see we bear witness and show unto
[59:41] you that eternal life which was the
[59:43] father was manifested unto us
[59:47] in other words my brother and sister
[59:48] taken in the right context it was
[59:50] manifested unto us it was actually
[59:52] deposited in you and i
[59:54] it wasn't just an example put on the
[59:56] wall that you can read that and
[59:57] hopefully you'll understand and hope
[59:59] you'll do that but god manifested this
[1:00:01] life by depositing it right into you and
[1:00:04] i amen it's not a surface thing it is
[1:00:08] something deep down within our soul now
[1:00:10] look at this what the definition of
[1:00:12] manifest is it's able
[1:00:14] to be seen
[1:00:16] clearly shown or visible
[1:00:19] easy to understand or recognize
[1:00:22] now my brother and sister you know just
[1:00:24] talking to people you know and they're
[1:00:26] like yeah this whole uh this whole
[1:00:28] serpent seed thing that that's just
[1:00:30] nonsense that's just that's just well
[1:00:32] how how did it happen then give us your
[1:00:34] take how did it happen we don't know how
[1:00:36] it happened it's a mystery we can't see
[1:00:38] it
[1:00:40] but to the bride of christ they look at
[1:00:42] that and they say it makes perfect sense
[1:00:45] here is this here's this this come this
[1:00:47] word said this this word said that
[1:00:49] coming all the way back down and jesus
[1:00:51] said you're of your father the devil
[1:00:53] and they can't recognize that my brother
[1:00:55] and sister and they think you're strange
[1:00:59] well i won't use the word strange on
[1:01:01] them but you have to wonder when people
[1:01:03] say i don't see it i don't see it i
[1:01:05] don't see it but the word says it was
[1:01:07] manifested to us so that means it had to
[1:01:10] be brought to a place that it was able
[1:01:12] to be seen first off right the word has
[1:01:15] to be able to be seen
[1:01:17] amen and then it is clearly shown and
[1:01:20] clearly made visible amen that's the
[1:01:23] revelation that comes in the hour we
[1:01:25] live in a personal gospel where god says
[1:01:27] i'm going to open your eyes you're going
[1:01:28] to see my word and i'm going to manifest
[1:01:31] or bring to fruition this word that's in
[1:01:33] you
[1:01:34] and we get to be the recipients of that
[1:01:37] now in the sermon
[1:01:39] it is the rising of the sun now i keep
[1:01:41] finding myself coming back to this
[1:01:43] sermon amen it's been a while since i've
[1:01:46] kind of touched on it but i find myself
[1:01:48] coming back to it and he says here the
[1:01:50] trinity of the devil
[1:01:53] death
[1:01:54] hell and the grave
[1:01:56] for satan is the author of death he is a
[1:01:58] possessor of hell and also the grave
[1:02:01] that was the trinity of satan being
[1:02:04] caused by one thing and that was death
[1:02:06] death you go at the grave being a sinner
[1:02:09] you go to hell all the very one thing
[1:02:12] the trinity of satan which was death
[1:02:14] that had held man in captivity all these
[1:02:17] years
[1:02:20] now i want to make my emphasis
[1:02:24] for everything satan's got
[1:02:27] he had to
[1:02:28] draw it
[1:02:30] from god
[1:02:32] he cannot create anything can he
[1:02:34] amen he is not a creator
[1:02:38] he is not the originator
[1:02:41] amen
[1:02:42] so we have the trinity of the devil
[1:02:44] which is death
[1:02:45] uh
[1:02:46] death hell in the grave now we come down
[1:02:48] here but now the true trinity of god
[1:02:52] being one manifested in christ who was
[1:02:55] life and had broke the seals and
[1:02:58] conquered the enemy and rose up the one
[1:03:01] true and living god i am he that was
[1:03:04] dead and am alive forevermore and have
[1:03:07] the keys of death and hell so here is
[1:03:10] the trinity of god where he is life but
[1:03:13] truly in reality he possesses the keys
[1:03:18] now you can claim you own something
[1:03:20] little thing i just saw the other day in
[1:03:23] certain cities uh they're having huge
[1:03:25] issues with this where people wait till
[1:03:27] someone goes on vacation they break into
[1:03:30] the house and then the laws in those
[1:03:32] communities which tend to be liberal
[1:03:34] communities are such that when these
[1:03:36] people come home from their vacation or
[1:03:38] travels someone's living in their house
[1:03:40] they can't even kick them out
[1:03:44] they have to go through an eviction
[1:03:46] process
[1:03:47] because we need to be fair and equitable
[1:03:52] one of the comments on that was their
[1:03:55] first mistake was they called the police
[1:04:00] and the second mistake was they asked
[1:04:03] them to leave when they should have told
[1:04:05] them
[1:04:06] now i say that i share that with you my
[1:04:08] brother and sister
[1:04:10] because sometimes
[1:04:12] we go about
[1:04:14] evicting the devil from our life in
[1:04:17] entirely the wrong
[1:04:20] fashion
[1:04:22] the devil will you
[1:04:23] please
[1:04:24] leave
[1:04:26] will you please clean up the floors and
[1:04:28] the trash and
[1:04:30] the damage you've done in my life
[1:04:33] when we should come on the authority of
[1:04:34] the word and say satan
[1:04:37] i rebuke you in the name of jesus christ
[1:04:39] and then make up your mind
[1:04:41] that you're going to back up
[1:04:43] what you have spoken
[1:04:46] right this is the thing brother brown
[1:04:47] talks about this i'm getting a little
[1:04:48] sidelined but maybe it's necessary
[1:04:50] people are there and they say oh praise
[1:04:52] the lord i was prayed for and i'm healed
[1:04:54] and they go home and go oh my i feel
[1:04:56] sicker than ever
[1:04:58] shouldn't even come from our mouth
[1:05:00] we should declare no matter what i'm
[1:05:02] healed i'm healed i'm healed but you're
[1:05:04] doubled over in pain i don't care i'm
[1:05:06] healed
[1:05:07] amen
[1:05:08] so you look at this now
[1:05:10] oh very one thing the trinity of satan
[1:05:12] which was death it held man captive in
[1:05:15] captivity all these years but now the
[1:05:17] true trinity of god being one manifested
[1:05:19] in christ who was life and had broke the
[1:05:22] seals and conquered the enemy and rose
[1:05:24] up the one true and living god i am he
[1:05:26] that was dead and i'm alive forevermore
[1:05:29] i have the keys of death and hell god in
[1:05:31] one made man and dwelt among us and
[1:05:34] conquered every can we say that
[1:05:37] every enemy
[1:05:39] and had proved that the trinity of satan
[1:05:41] was conquered and that the trinity of
[1:05:43] god was made known because only god
[1:05:45] alone had the power to bring life back
[1:05:48] again he was at emmanuel god had been
[1:05:50] manifested in flesh
[1:05:53] now look at this
[1:05:54] no wonder he could claim there matthew
[1:05:57] the 27th chapter all powers in heaven
[1:06:00] and earth is given into my hand i send
[1:06:03] you to be my witnesses to all the world
[1:06:06] now if he sent them to be witnesses my
[1:06:09] brother and sister they had to have
[1:06:11] something to testify on
[1:06:14] he couldn't he wouldn't send forth an
[1:06:16] empty witness i'm a christian what does
[1:06:19] that mean well i believe there is a god
[1:06:21] and i go to church
[1:06:25] now i don't recommend you guys go dig
[1:06:27] through all this stuff
[1:06:28] sometimes i feel compelled to there's
[1:06:31] things that i'm studying i want to know
[1:06:33] the counter type of this and i i dig
[1:06:35] through these things my brother and
[1:06:37] sister this is what a lot of the
[1:06:39] denominational churches have come to in
[1:06:42] the day that we live in i believe there
[1:06:44] is a god and i go to church
[1:06:47] that's not christianity there's supposed
[1:06:49] to be a christ-like life
[1:06:52] in other words something had to be
[1:06:54] manifested had to be brought forth where
[1:06:56] it could be seen visibly
[1:07:01] i have a good friend
[1:07:02] i really appreciate the man very
[1:07:04] successful farmer
[1:07:06] i've tried witnessing to him several
[1:07:08] times and he always tells me paul
[1:07:11] paul
[1:07:12] faith
[1:07:13] is a very personal and private thing
[1:07:18] not to be discussed
[1:07:21] and i'm not judging my friend
[1:07:23] but i'm like
[1:07:25] you've never had a real experience
[1:07:28] because if you ever have a real
[1:07:29] experience and somebody talks to you
[1:07:32] about god talk to you about jesus christ
[1:07:34] about the holy ghost there's got to be
[1:07:36] something there to respond back and say
[1:07:38] i identify with that
[1:07:43] now that doesn't mean we have to go get
[1:07:44] on the corner of shinden and whatever
[1:07:48] but practically stand in the street and
[1:07:49] wave a sign and scream that's not
[1:07:51] manifesting either
[1:07:54] amen
[1:07:56] all powers in heaven earth is given unto
[1:07:58] me everything else is powerless he'd
[1:08:00] conquered it now and then not only that
[1:08:02] he sent the word to his disciples his
[1:08:05] believing fear not for i am he that was
[1:08:08] dead and is alive again forevermore and
[1:08:10] i have the keys to death and hell i've
[1:08:12] already conquered it don't fear anymore
[1:08:15] for
[1:08:16] every
[1:08:17] foreordained
[1:08:19] predestinated seed of god shall come to
[1:08:23] life when that light spreads across the
[1:08:26] earth
[1:08:27] now that ought to give us hope for loved
[1:08:29] ones
[1:08:30] amen whether they're our children our
[1:08:32] parents
[1:08:33] whatever kind of relative it might be a
[1:08:36] husband or wife to know that every
[1:08:39] predestined seed of god
[1:08:41] must come to life when that light shines
[1:08:44] on that
[1:08:46] and we are a people who believe the
[1:08:47] light is shining don't we
[1:08:49] amen
[1:08:54] of the glorious gospel in every age
[1:08:56] it'll bring forth the crop that god
[1:08:58] ordained to do
[1:09:00] he had raised from the dead that's quite
[1:09:02] a lengthy quote so bear with me
[1:09:05] amen
[1:09:06] oh what a wonderful thing that is i am
[1:09:08] alive or quickened
[1:09:10] the word means the word quicken the
[1:09:12] greek word means it's something that's
[1:09:14] made alive after death that's me
[1:09:17] like the seed that goes into the earth
[1:09:19] it has to die every bit of the seed it
[1:09:21] has to rot every bit of the seed every
[1:09:23] bit of the life that was in the seed has
[1:09:25] to come forth again he was quickened not
[1:09:27] only that and will send the same life
[1:09:29] that quickened me the power that brought
[1:09:32] me from the grave i will send it upon
[1:09:35] you
[1:09:37] we're not a powerless church saints
[1:09:39] we're a personalized church we are a
[1:09:42] body of believers that every affliction
[1:09:45] and every need has already been
[1:09:47] identified and he says i've already sent
[1:09:49] the answer
[1:09:50] hallelujah amen so the power that
[1:09:53] brought him from the grave he sent it to
[1:09:55] you to quicken you that where i am you
[1:09:58] will be also
[1:09:59] see there's this personal gospel god
[1:10:01] didn't just blanket my brother and
[1:10:03] sister not nor did he take the seed and
[1:10:05] we look at these things and sometimes we
[1:10:07] wonder how is it that predestinated
[1:10:09] works but god knew that each one of you
[1:10:11] would be here tonight and god knew what
[1:10:13] i would be speaking tonight and he knew
[1:10:15] the situation of every one of our lives
[1:10:18] tonight amen can't we trust a god to
[1:10:21] guide us when he has that much knowledge
[1:10:23] of our own life and we don't even know
[1:10:25] our own mind
[1:10:31] always amazed i shared this many times
[1:10:33] but i am amazed we have people
[1:10:36] explaining god
[1:10:38] who can't even explain themselves
[1:10:42] but you see god has sent this down
[1:10:44] personally to you and i you know amen
[1:10:47] and i'm going to say something that's
[1:10:49] just going to shake some people right to
[1:10:50] their heels and i'm sorry it will
[1:10:53] but
[1:10:54] this message
[1:11:00] it's right there
[1:11:02] amen
[1:11:03] that's the message right there
[1:11:05] god himself
[1:11:08] see now don't get me wrong you know what
[1:11:10] i believe i've given my life to this and
[1:11:12] i'll continue to give my life to this
[1:11:14] but my brother and sister do we get this
[1:11:16] we often times say the message the
[1:11:19] message the message
[1:11:21] this is the message right here
[1:11:23] the same life that raised me up our lord
[1:11:26] jesus speaking that same life that
[1:11:28] raised me up i have sent it unto you
[1:11:31] that you would be quickened also
[1:11:35] that's the message of this hour my
[1:11:36] brother and sister the very spirit and
[1:11:39] life of our lord jesus christ coming
[1:11:41] down to you and i bringing life in us in
[1:11:45] a dark dying ugly world amen that's the
[1:11:48] message right here
[1:11:50] hallelujah you can go a little farther
[1:11:52] down in my scriptures and you'll find
[1:11:53] what it says there it says the message
[1:11:56] is amen but we'll just continue to move
[1:11:58] forward here now look
[1:12:03] don't fear anymore i'm going back in the
[1:12:05] quote here don't fear anymore for every
[1:12:07] foreordained predestinated seed of god
[1:12:11] shall come to life
[1:12:13] when the light spreads across the earth
[1:12:15] now once you understand that the context
[1:12:18] in the word shall
[1:12:20] is a strong assertion
[1:12:23] or
[1:12:24] declaration
[1:12:26] so this is not might maybe could
[1:12:29] possible
[1:12:30] this is an absolute
[1:12:34] so what we have is an absolute
[1:12:36] that this very life that he is talking
[1:12:39] about
[1:12:40] will come
[1:12:42] can we all have confidence tonight and
[1:12:45] just simply put it behind us and say has
[1:12:48] come
[1:12:50] we don't need to just look off over here
[1:12:52] looking for some day when god's going to
[1:12:53] come now the prophet of god talks about
[1:12:56] a quick powerful work my brother and
[1:12:57] sister and i know people around this
[1:12:59] message identifying in that sense around
[1:13:02] this message that are waiting they're
[1:13:03] sitting on their hands
[1:13:06] waiting for this quick powerful work
[1:13:08] i think it's taking place
[1:13:10] because we're gonna understand what's
[1:13:12] quick in god's eyes is not maybe quick
[1:13:14] in our eyes we can't uh interpret this
[1:13:16] and through our thinking we have to
[1:13:18] interpret this through god's thinking
[1:13:20] and god comes and
[1:13:23] what does he do with his own word
[1:13:27] he confirms it amen
[1:13:29] his own word by what
[1:13:32] making it come to pass
[1:13:37] and people are sitting on their hands
[1:13:38] waiting for some kind of quick powerful
[1:13:41] work
[1:13:42] and i can tell you around my house oh
[1:13:44] i'm not talking about the address and
[1:13:46] the brick or whatever i'm talking about
[1:13:48] my house
[1:13:50] god's doing a powerful work amen
[1:13:53] god's dealing with me saints in ways i
[1:13:55] never ever thought
[1:13:57] and all i can do is say lord forgive me
[1:13:59] for this and forgive me for that and
[1:14:01] what it is you know what god's doing
[1:14:04] you see have any of you ever refined
[1:14:05] anything
[1:14:09] so if you haven't it's not a novel
[1:14:11] concept
[1:14:13] you take
[1:14:14] gold silver lead
[1:14:16] brass
[1:14:18] you get it hot enough to melt it
[1:14:21] but really what you still have even
[1:14:22] though it's hot enough to melt now you
[1:14:24] still have
[1:14:25] any any
[1:14:27] dipper that you would take from that and
[1:14:29] go you'll find it's contaminated still
[1:14:33] we're precious
[1:14:34] we're gold
[1:14:38] are you with me
[1:14:40] so god's drawing you out and we're
[1:14:41] saying praise the lord i'm gold
[1:14:45] but god just put you over here in
[1:14:46] another kettle
[1:14:48] and then depending on what material that
[1:14:50] they're refining
[1:14:52] they'll shave
[1:14:56] a flux
[1:14:58] into that
[1:14:59] you know what the flux does
[1:15:02] it causes all this let's use lead we
[1:15:04] used to reload a lot of bullets with
[1:15:06] lead it will draw all this stuff to the
[1:15:09] surface
[1:15:10] you can scrape that off are you done
[1:15:14] no
[1:15:16] you do it again
[1:15:18] and depending on how pure you want the
[1:15:20] bullets to be
[1:15:23] it's how many times
[1:15:26] that you have the flux thrown in
[1:15:28] and the refiner's fire lit underneath
[1:15:31] now i have a simple question for you
[1:15:33] tonight saints
[1:15:35] how
[1:15:36] pure do we want to be
[1:15:44] you see if we don't want to be very pure
[1:15:46] we could just call it good
[1:15:51] but as i preach to you
[1:15:52] obedience brings some mission
[1:15:56] and what we're doing we're coming
[1:15:58] and we keep coming back to him it's not
[1:16:00] him forcing his will on us
[1:16:02] we keep coming back to him purify me
[1:16:04] lord
[1:16:05] cleanse me lord give me a clean heart
[1:16:09] and he says okay
[1:16:11] here's a little flux
[1:16:13] turn up the heat and then it seems as
[1:16:15] though we forgot the prayer in the
[1:16:16] midnight hours of asking the lord to
[1:16:18] purify us and then we're here going i
[1:16:21] don't know what's going on in my life
[1:16:22] but it feels like everything's going
[1:16:24] wrong
[1:16:26] don't worry
[1:16:27] it's all part of the process
[1:16:30] because it's a personal gospel
[1:16:32] and you see we can't just purify the
[1:16:35] church as one whole
[1:16:37] because the church is made up of you
[1:16:40] the individual
[1:16:42] now as we look at this my brother and
[1:16:44] sister
[1:16:45] we realize that god's making a strong
[1:16:48] assertion
[1:16:49] and um
[1:16:53] really if god declares it to be so it's
[1:16:55] just done
[1:16:56] that's it
[1:16:57] i'm sorry i want to speak to you like a
[1:16:59] farmer sitting in a tractor here but uh
[1:17:03] you know it's just tough luck if if
[1:17:05] if you want to make a rapture and your
[1:17:07] hearts cry as lord purify me
[1:17:09] and then the lord turns the heat up in
[1:17:11] your life and seems like everything is
[1:17:13] just going wrong
[1:17:15] quit complaining okay
[1:17:17] i just quit whining quit quit all the
[1:17:19] sniveling and and quit all this woe is
[1:17:22] me stuff oh no don't worry about his
[1:17:23] saints i'm preaching at paul tonight and
[1:17:25] if it hits you too that's good
[1:17:29] but you see we can't ask to be purified
[1:17:31] and cleansed
[1:17:33] and then complain about the process
[1:17:37] so when you say in that midnight hour
[1:17:39] lord give me a pure heart cleanse my
[1:17:41] heart lord then just buckle down
[1:17:44] just buckle down and say lord also give
[1:17:46] me a stiff back you know not not a
[1:17:48] stubborn one but just a stiff one to
[1:17:50] just maintain and press forward
[1:17:53] because you ask from the depths of your
[1:17:55] heart
[1:17:56] that midnight hour
[1:17:59] god says
[1:18:00] okay
[1:18:01] i'll do that
[1:18:02] i'll purify him
[1:18:04] now think about it my brother and sister
[1:18:07] to hear those words well done my good
[1:18:08] and faithful servant
[1:18:13] compared to something like
[1:18:16] you know you came so close to making the
[1:18:18] rapture
[1:18:20] if you had just
[1:18:23] submitted yourself
[1:18:25] one last time
[1:18:28] instead you quit
[1:18:31] i know we all preach real politically
[1:18:33] correct or most the time don't we
[1:18:37] but i don't want to hear no sniveling if
[1:18:38] you're quitting
[1:18:41] if you ask god to carry you through and
[1:18:44] take you in a rapture and present you as
[1:18:46] that beautiful gorgeous oh can i just
[1:18:48] close my eyes and imagine for a minute
[1:18:50] that absolute gorgeous bride she is like
[1:18:53] nothing you have ever seen just she's so
[1:18:56] regal she's so beautiful she's she's
[1:18:58] just oh
[1:19:00] everything that you could ever imagine
[1:19:05] that you quit
[1:19:09] because it got too hard
[1:19:12] because to purify us god had to
[1:19:14] turn the heat up a little bit more from
[1:19:16] what it was last time
[1:19:20] we asked the lord to
[1:19:21] make us rapture ready
[1:19:24] but we'd like to do it with bunny
[1:19:25] slippers and popcorn in a recliner
[1:19:29] and god says
[1:19:31] i've got some rugged christians
[1:19:34] the reason i know they're rugged is
[1:19:35] because i've actually talked to them
[1:19:37] one-on-one i've dealt with them and i
[1:19:39] know what their heart is and i know what
[1:19:41] they've gone through and i know what
[1:19:43] they believe
[1:19:45] and they're worthy to bear my name amen
[1:19:49] reminds me of a true story in nebraska
[1:19:52] history
[1:19:56] pioneer
[1:19:57] this lady
[1:19:59] was the very
[1:20:02] example of pioneer spirit
[1:20:05] outlived three husbands
[1:20:09] her family still exists today
[1:20:12] covering a vast expanse of the black
[1:20:14] hills and and nebraska there and and
[1:20:18] account some 300 or something
[1:20:20] descendants
[1:20:23] and you know what saints somehow this
[1:20:25] rugged spirit now i hope you follow me
[1:20:28] here somehow this rugged spirit that was
[1:20:30] in some of them's great great
[1:20:32] whatever it is however far goes back
[1:20:34] grandma
[1:20:36] that spirit still exists in that family
[1:20:38] today
[1:20:40] and that family will tell you we start
[1:20:41] something we finish it
[1:20:44] i would love to have her for a
[1:20:46] grandmother
[1:20:47] but then again maybe i wouldn't have
[1:20:50] because maybe she just said
[1:20:52] get your hide over here you little
[1:20:55] and get back to work
[1:20:57] i don't know
[1:20:59] but it always struck me when i read that
[1:21:01] story
[1:21:02] because that pioneer spirit in her
[1:21:06] and
[1:21:07] it wasn't that she outlived her
[1:21:08] husband's every one of them died in some
[1:21:10] kind of
[1:21:11] incident one of them
[1:21:13] indians
[1:21:14] that's not racist
[1:21:19] one was a horse
[1:21:21] one was some other i don't remember
[1:21:24] and she just kept going forward
[1:21:27] see
[1:21:28] she once told one of her children
[1:21:32] if i had ever looked back
[1:21:34] i would have went to missouri where i
[1:21:36] come from
[1:21:39] but i never once
[1:21:41] looked back
[1:21:42] because this
[1:21:44] was my life
[1:21:46] saints that's what god's trying to do
[1:21:47] today
[1:21:48] amen we've got to come if we start
[1:21:50] looking back my goodness egypt's going
[1:21:52] to look good
[1:21:54] hallelujah except for all the rivers
[1:21:56] over there drying up which is
[1:21:58] prophetic
[1:22:00] think about it
[1:22:02] amen
[1:22:04] so let me let me hurry along here
[1:22:06] amen so we've seen it in verse three
[1:22:09] we've heard it and we declare it
[1:22:12] that we can have fellowship and truly
[1:22:14] our fellowships with the father and of
[1:22:15] the son jesus christ and these things we
[1:22:17] write unto you that your joy would be
[1:22:19] full he's not trying to just give us a
[1:22:22] portion to come to another day to get
[1:22:24] another little portion in other words
[1:22:27] it's not subsistence or a subsistence to
[1:22:30] a mere existence but my brother and
[1:22:32] sister he said i'm gonna make your joy
[1:22:34] full and in the good days it's full and
[1:22:37] in the bad days it should be full and
[1:22:39] whether the sun is shining it should be
[1:22:41] full so we can stand here and say yes a
[1:22:43] frown might be upon my face but i'm
[1:22:46] telling you my heart is full because i
[1:22:48] know who i am in jesus christ and he has
[1:22:51] come and has given me it's not a future
[1:22:54] 10th saint where we are at today we can
[1:22:57] stand and say he has given us his name
[1:23:02] we walk under his name today we claim
[1:23:04] the promises today under his name
[1:23:09] remember
[1:23:10] when that woman come to jesus
[1:23:14] her approach
[1:23:15] in the heart
[1:23:17] was good
[1:23:21] thou son of david
[1:23:27] didn't even
[1:23:28] seems like he wasn't very kind doesn't
[1:23:30] it
[1:23:35] the whole time he knows her heart
[1:23:40] but what she had to do was take
[1:23:43] we're not talking about calling
[1:23:45] ourselves dogs let's not get into some
[1:23:47] kind of crazy ideas
[1:23:49] but she had to come and take
[1:23:51] one last step
[1:23:54] of submission
[1:23:56] and says
[1:23:58] yay master
[1:24:01] but even the dogs
[1:24:04] even the dogs eat the scraps
[1:24:09] she no longer come in some spiritual
[1:24:11] position claiming something she had no
[1:24:14] right to
[1:24:15] she came in the right way
[1:24:18] now look my brother and sister i used
[1:24:19] that example unless you would dwell on
[1:24:21] that and think okay i've got to do no my
[1:24:23] brother sister the word of god
[1:24:25] has showed us
[1:24:28] that we
[1:24:30] are the bride of jesus christ
[1:24:36] ask what you will
[1:24:37] ask anything in my name
[1:24:41] and it shall be given you
[1:24:43] what is this that's very personal
[1:24:45] hallelujah to be the bride of the lord
[1:24:47] jesus christ how much more personal can
[1:24:50] that be
[1:24:51] how much more now look i kind of skipped
[1:24:53] over this but let me just jump backwards
[1:24:55] real quick if you don't mind
[1:24:57] amen let's look at this here
[1:25:01] hopefully i didn't cut that out
[1:25:03] i might have
[1:25:05] no here we are
[1:25:07] now look when we read these scriptures
[1:25:08] and and this is why i got excited in the
[1:25:10] song we were singing because it's here
[1:25:12] talking about we we now look at this my
[1:25:15] brother and sister we is a personal
[1:25:17] pronoun in the first person
[1:25:21] plural
[1:25:25] so when john is speaking
[1:25:28] well when all the apostles are speaking
[1:25:30] and they are speaking of these things
[1:25:32] when they say we my brother and sister
[1:25:35] they are then making an inclusive group
[1:25:38] and declaring it's us we speak as one
[1:25:42] we're plural
[1:25:44] but it's a personal pronoun
[1:25:46] you realize what that means don't you
[1:25:48] i hope you do brother jason was joking
[1:25:51] with me
[1:25:53] joking with me in the back
[1:25:55] that there's a reason that there's only
[1:25:56] certain keys that i like in music and
[1:25:59] those because those letters were
[1:26:01] reflected on my report card
[1:26:05] that just cut me right to the heart
[1:26:09] i like f
[1:26:13] but look even i in my state of education
[1:26:17] can grasp what it means to be a personal
[1:26:21] pronoun in the plural which means you
[1:26:24] and i are equal we're included together
[1:26:26] in this we can speak for one another
[1:26:29] so when one stands and the apostle paul
[1:26:32] makes a claim when john makes a claim
[1:26:35] when all of these apostles make a claim
[1:26:37] my brother and sister they were speaking
[1:26:39] it was inclusive to you and i it drew us
[1:26:42] right into their speech their position
[1:26:45] their authority their declaration that
[1:26:47] we included right into it and now i want
[1:26:50] to bring it closer to home when the
[1:26:51] prophet of god speaks these things go
[1:26:53] study the message there is not enough
[1:26:55] quotes not enough pages to print not
[1:26:56] enough screen that you can do and he
[1:26:58] speaks in these terms he's speaking in
[1:27:01] this into an inclusive and drawing us in
[1:27:04] it wasn't me the prophet me with
[1:27:06] revelation me with this he drew this
[1:27:09] bride of this day into this word of this
[1:27:12] hour and said you are this word
[1:27:16] you are this life you are the overcomer
[1:27:20] hallelujah
[1:27:22] oh my brother and sister how the gospel
[1:27:25] has come and been so personal
[1:27:28] but yet
[1:27:29] we are so connected
[1:27:32] people are like oh we're looking for
[1:27:34] unity to come into the bride i'm telling
[1:27:36] you unity has come into the bride and
[1:27:39] it's called the holy ghost
[1:27:41] amen and though nothing will draw us
[1:27:43] closer together than us under the
[1:27:45] anointing of the lord jesus christ
[1:27:48] hallelujah
[1:27:49] amen because here it is i'm glad this
[1:27:51] quote's still up i'll send the same life
[1:27:54] that quickened me these are the prophets
[1:27:56] words but i believe it just as though my
[1:27:59] brother and sister that quickened me the
[1:28:00] power that brought me from the grave i
[1:28:03] will send it upon you to quicken you
[1:28:07] now how many of you believe that
[1:28:10] so that means we
[1:28:11] believe that
[1:28:13] we as a body of believers
[1:28:16] a real body of believers believe that
[1:28:19] but yet it's a personal gospel to us
[1:28:22] amen
[1:28:24] now let's just go into christ the
[1:28:25] mystery of god revealed and then we'll
[1:28:28] just hurry it's only about
[1:28:31] three paragraphs i think
[1:28:33] amen excuse me i just was sure i'd be
[1:28:36] done by now i'm sorry saint
[1:28:37] no i'm not sorry
[1:28:41] justified in his sight
[1:28:43] why are we justified
[1:28:48] come on saints
[1:28:49] enter in with me
[1:28:51] i gotta already got my dancing out of
[1:28:53] the way so i don't have to embarrass you
[1:28:54] all by me dancing around out here amen
[1:28:57] we are his victory
[1:29:01] what is the victory identified in
[1:29:04] my brother and sister the victor
[1:29:06] is where victory
[1:29:07] is always identified
[1:29:11] do you know
[1:29:13] if you're on a nfl team and i'm not much
[1:29:16] into sports but
[1:29:17] if you're on an nfl team
[1:29:20] and your team wins the super bowl
[1:29:23] and you're just the ball boy
[1:29:25] you get a ring amen
[1:29:30] imagine
[1:29:31] now it's not the ring that's worth fifty
[1:29:33] five thousand dollars
[1:29:37] but it forever identifies you as being
[1:29:39] on a winning team
[1:29:47] yeah some people say
[1:29:49] the scripture said leave houses lands
[1:29:51] father mother sister brother whatever
[1:29:53] that you're supposed to be a loner
[1:29:56] that's not what it's talking about
[1:29:59] we're identified
[1:30:00] now
[1:30:01] and have always been identified as sheep
[1:30:06] sheep like each other
[1:30:08] except for when they don't
[1:30:11] the church
[1:30:12] is his victory
[1:30:14] we come forth in this last days with
[1:30:16] this glorious gospel showing his victory
[1:30:20] he died for this purpose and we are
[1:30:23] proof
[1:30:24] of his victory
[1:30:26] come on saints look at him if there ever
[1:30:28] was a sign that god could have chose
[1:30:30] that he had overcome the world he could
[1:30:33] have chose the sun the moon the stars he
[1:30:35] could have raised a mountain up as a
[1:30:37] memorial he could have done his and he
[1:30:39] chose you and i
[1:30:41] wow
[1:30:42] now
[1:30:43] okay maybe somebody needs this i love
[1:30:46] you first
[1:30:49] if you say you represent jesus christ
[1:30:52] and therefore by this quote represent
[1:30:54] his victory and you walk around and your
[1:30:58] attitude and your behavior and your
[1:31:01] words

[1:31:12] brother paul no you're not you're
[1:31:14] telling me what you see you're telling
[1:31:16] me what you feel
[1:31:18] you're not telling me the reality this
[1:31:20] is the reality
[1:31:23] he died for this purpose and we are
[1:31:26] proof of his victory amen when we see
[1:31:29] him coming down and living among the
[1:31:31] church that's his victory look saints
[1:31:34] tonight would can i can i just be over
[1:31:36] exuberant over confidence tonight we
[1:31:39] have the evidence of his victory and
[1:31:42] it's right here on this wednesday night
[1:31:44] sitting right here in these chairs
[1:31:47] hallelujah we're not just going to
[1:31:49] church we're here as celebrating his
[1:31:52] victory amen a testimony of his victory
[1:31:57] well brother paul i don't feel so
[1:31:58] victorious we're not celebrating you
[1:32:02] you're supposed to be dead
[1:32:05] he's the one that's living
[1:32:12] when we see is coming down and living
[1:32:14] among the church that's his victory so
[1:32:16] that he couldn't keep him in the grave
[1:32:18] neither can they keep us
[1:32:22] now my brother and sister i want to put
[1:32:24] this
[1:32:25] to a spiritual realm
[1:32:27] some of us
[1:32:29] are living lives
[1:32:31] like they've already tossed our bones
[1:32:33] in the grave
[1:32:38] well god of prayer now if this is
[1:32:40] something that hits you i'm not mocking
[1:32:42] you
[1:32:42] i'm speaking to you to change your
[1:32:44] approach
[1:32:46] brother paul
[1:32:47] i've got prayers i've prayed for seven
[1:32:49] years and god's not answered it
[1:32:53] well you ought to be pretty close to
[1:32:54] purified by now
[1:32:57] god just keeps throwing some flux in
[1:32:59] there and keeps turning up the heat
[1:33:01] and the devil is trying to get you to
[1:33:02] deny your very claim
[1:33:05] but why don't you turn around and say
[1:33:07] hallelujah
[1:33:08] if nothing ever changed in my life if
[1:33:10] i'm a if i have a disease if i
[1:33:12] have this issue i have this of thorn in
[1:33:14] my flesh and i go all the way to a
[1:33:17] natural grave with that
[1:33:20] i'm still the victory
[1:33:23] i am still the evidence of the victory
[1:33:26] and i got something to shout about
[1:33:28] because i'm on the winning team and
[1:33:31] we'll always be on the winning team
[1:33:34] hallelujah
[1:33:36] oh my so he couldn't keep him in the
[1:33:38] grave neither to keep us that's right
[1:33:40] we're bound right and we're already
[1:33:43] potentially arise because we've raised
[1:33:46] from the dead unbelief in his word
[1:33:50] my that actually is a pretty big thing
[1:33:52] do you know that saints well i could go
[1:33:54] on do we have another couple hours
[1:33:56] come on i'll tell you what i've got some
[1:33:58] notes that just take me down this avenue
[1:34:01] and looking my brother and sister what
[1:34:02] unbelief has done to us
[1:34:06] it's the erosion
[1:34:08] of the moral
[1:34:10] of our spiritual
[1:34:12] bones
[1:34:15] eroded it away
[1:34:17] where we can't run
[1:34:19] we can't jump we can't shout
[1:34:21] we can't praise god
[1:34:24] because the erosion
[1:34:26] has taken away
[1:34:28] the underpinning
[1:34:30] of the relationship
[1:34:32] but we're not pentecostals brother paul
[1:34:35] no
[1:34:36] but that pentecostal anointing come from
[1:34:38] god
[1:34:40] and he never
[1:34:41] rescinded it
[1:34:43] he never took it back
[1:34:48] but i can show you oh how many quotes i
[1:34:50] won't even try to quote it because i'll
[1:34:51] mess it up and then somebody will say i
[1:34:54] twisted the message
[1:34:56] look how many times go study it how many
[1:35:00] times brother brown talks about the old
[1:35:03] cold formal spirit
[1:35:07] see what satan's trying to do he's
[1:35:08] trying to erode that
[1:35:10] so that we just get to the place i'm not
[1:35:12] preaching that way to your saints i'm
[1:35:14] not trying to get you to jump and shout
[1:35:15] and scream but there will be something
[1:35:17] bubbling up in the heart and soul
[1:35:19] that satan can't quench he can't stop it
[1:35:22] he can't quiet it
[1:35:24] because we've been raised from dead
[1:35:26] unbelief in his word from denomination
[1:35:29] creeds to an eternal word of the eternal
[1:35:32] god which is him himself working
[1:35:37] hallelujah look saints let me tell you
[1:35:40] i'm gonna boast just a little bit
[1:35:42] tonight when god was looking for
[1:35:44] somebody to do a job and there was a
[1:35:46] whole whatever however many millions and
[1:35:48] millions of people on the earth and i
[1:35:50] tell you how special i am tonight god
[1:35:52] looked down on the earth and said i'm
[1:35:53] going to choose you you you you you
[1:35:56] you to do this work for me
[1:35:59] why us
[1:36:01] come on why didn't he do it himself snap
[1:36:03] of the fingers a voice
[1:36:05] he said no i'm gonna come down and i'm
[1:36:07] gonna live in you and you are gonna do
[1:36:09] this and so i'm going to manifest myself
[1:36:12] in you because this is my
[1:36:15] plan
[1:36:17] now
[1:36:18] if we're going to write god a letter or
[1:36:20] send him a voicemail telling him his
[1:36:22] plan doesn't work please let me know
[1:36:25] because i want to be on the other side
[1:36:26] of the county from you
[1:36:29] i want to be on the other side of town
[1:36:30] at the least
[1:36:32] when you start telling god you're wrong
[1:36:35] you're wrong
[1:36:36] you should have done it this way
[1:36:41] eternal word of the eternal god which is
[1:36:43] him himself working through us
[1:36:45] manifesting himself that he is the same
[1:36:46] yesterday today and forever and then the
[1:36:49] word moves on down into the body from
[1:36:51] the head what is it this same word
[1:36:53] nothing can be added or taken from it so
[1:36:56] the same word moves from the head as the
[1:36:59] day comes close down into the body down
[1:37:02] into the body vindicating they are
[1:37:05] one
[1:37:07] hallelujah
[1:37:09] they are husband and wife they are flesh
[1:37:12] of his flesh word of his word life of
[1:37:15] his life spirit of his spirit see amen
[1:37:18] how do you know it bears the same record
[1:37:20] the same fruit the same word see
[1:37:22] manifest christ
[1:37:25] same life same god same spirit same word
[1:37:27] same book
[1:37:29] amen same signs things that i do
[1:37:32] shall also amen
[1:37:36] well we're waiting for you to walk on
[1:37:38] water
[1:37:40] i haven't had any need to walk on water
[1:37:41] yet
[1:37:42] but when the day comes and i need to
[1:37:45] the word of god says i will amen i have
[1:37:49] never had to cast a demon out of a crazy
[1:37:52] man among the tombs but i tell you what
[1:37:54] i have been
[1:37:57] i've been there
[1:37:59] with a little girl with his spirit on
[1:38:00] here
[1:38:04] i've been there
[1:38:06] when that little girl with spirit
[1:38:11] who thought it would be good i'll just
[1:38:13] speak it blunt to you
[1:38:15] sounded fun
[1:38:19] to go be a prostitute
[1:38:24] declaring to her parents
[1:38:27] when the day is right
[1:38:30] i'm gone
[1:38:32] and i'll have the money to do anything i
[1:38:34] want to do
[1:38:40] are we playing game saints
[1:38:44] to see the power of god come down
[1:38:47] and that little girl
[1:38:48] is now mother of at least two children
[1:38:52] serving god
[1:38:54] because
[1:38:55] we serve an awesome
[1:39:03] the counter of that if you would say
[1:39:05] as a young man climb out the bedroom
[1:39:07] window
[1:39:09] part of a gang
[1:39:11] coming to the day that the initiate
[1:39:13] initiation of that gang
[1:39:15] is to murder somebody
[1:39:18] needs to be done on a public street
[1:39:20] in daylight
[1:39:23] and if you want
[1:39:25] you become
[1:39:28] the one that they use
[1:39:30] and someone else is willing
[1:39:33] and to see god change an atmosphere
[1:39:36] where this young man hid for a while
[1:39:41] and finally said i can't hide my whole
[1:39:42] life people said move to another part of
[1:39:44] the country
[1:39:46] and he says isn't that the same as
[1:39:47] running
[1:39:49] went to his pastor
[1:39:51] they prayed through
[1:39:52] and he got up one morning and said lord
[1:39:54] live or die
[1:39:56] i'm going to serve you openly
[1:39:59] and he walked right out in the streets
[1:40:00] and he's there and he's meeting his
[1:40:02] fellow gang members that he walked away
[1:40:04] from first time ever in this game
[1:40:06] well the most violent gangs in santiago
[1:40:09] chile
[1:40:11] counted for hundreds and hundreds and
[1:40:13] hundreds of murders
[1:40:16] and he says lord if that's what it takes
[1:40:18] i can't leave you
[1:40:20] god so change the spirit of a whole gang
[1:40:22] of saints
[1:40:24] they see him on the street and they're
[1:40:25] like oh we love you buddy
[1:40:27] so good to see you we miss you
[1:40:30] what is it
[1:40:32] a personal savior
[1:40:34] a personal god amen amen hallelujah
[1:40:38] sorry to keep you
[1:40:39] sister ruth would you come i will stop
[1:40:42] just start playing when you get to the
[1:40:43] piano
[1:40:47] notice
[1:40:50] the vindicated word in his body is his
[1:40:52] very victory and the reason of his death
[1:40:54] see the death not in the spirit when he
[1:40:57] died he only died in the flesh his
[1:40:59] spirit went to hell amen oh where are we
[1:41:04] you know okay
[1:41:06] went to hell and preached souls in
[1:41:07] prison that right his flesh only died
[1:41:09] then he raised it up again and quickened
[1:41:11] it quicken means made a lie i already

[1:43:20] question and there it's a holy ghost
[1:43:23] it's a spirit of god it's a shady eye
[1:43:26] it's an oh we could just keep going and
[1:43:28] going and going right down but the word
