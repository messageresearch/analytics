something every gift it just I just say God help us to do with them and use them according to your will amen that's my desire and I just thank you again God bless you for your giving amen amen so if you'll stand with me I'd like to turn to the word I'd like you to turn with me to Psalm 91 start with a verse verse and I think I'll read Psalm 90 to actually to begin with and if you have a scull field Bible it's just right across the page but I'll just read Psalm 9990 verse1 and that's a beautiful Psalm if you can read that sometime it's the prayer of Moses the man of God and uh Psalm 90:1 said Lord is he your Lord amen thou Hast been our Dwelling Place in all ver chapter 90 verse one chapter 90 I'm reading that first then 91 I'll go to 91 just after Lord thou Hast been our dwelling place I want to emphasize Dwelling Place in all generations Psalm 911 he that's the individual that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide abide that's not in and out now that's live there abide there shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noisome pestilence now those are plagues and those are those are F the Fowler one that sets a trap you know who that is the Trap Setter the thief he shall cover theee I want you to catch these words now we're talking about where you're dwelling he shall cover thee with his feathers right and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler you know what this truth is that's the word that ought to be you ought to be grown up enough now to know if you're born again that that's your absolute there's no adding to that or taking from it the truth is our absolute all right shall come and and and see let me catch my where I was yeah Thou shalt not be afraid for the tear by night nor for the arrow that flyth by day see it's kind of speaking of our day isn't it nor the pestilence right Allelujah let that soak them in it nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness notice where they're walking right but you're not walking there bride you're in the light for you are the child a children of light you're the child of God in him is no Darkness so if you're in God you're in light and light doth make manifest the darkness so you have nothing to fear all right so he shall he said nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth you ever see a waster the Bible speaks of a waser that wasteth at Noonday A thousand shall fall at thy side 10,000 at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee why because of where you're dwelling right amen I'm making that emphasis because of where you're dwelling it can't come nigh thee it can't come nigh your dwelling place so you've got to know that's something different this old flesh carnal man out here okay we're coming down to Brass tax tonight get you to see your place where you dwell all right and then see and a thousand shall fall at thy side let me read that again 10,000 in the right hand but shall not come nigh thee Only With Thine Eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou Hast made the Lord which is my refuge the most high watch because thou Hast made the Lord none of these things because because verse n because thou Hast made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation thy habitation all right there shall be no evil now why because of verse 9 because of verse one because of what we just read here for there shall no evil befall thee right neither shall any plague come nigh thy habitation Hallelujah dwelling kind of puts a little different picture I trust that you'll catch the picture tonight thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways now remember nothing can come upon your flesh but what your Shepherd allowed it but I want to reiterate no plague or evil can come nigh thy dwelling that's that's right so it sounds like it's contradictory but it isn't all right all right thou said bear thee up and they shall bear thee up these angels shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou Dash thy foot against the stone Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder the Young Lion and the dragon Thou shalt trample under thy feet well you know what thy feet is the body of Christ because he has set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him and see if you're in the body of Christ every every demon every devil every sickness every evil is under your feet already cuz that's where you dwell you're dwelling in the body that's your dwelling place we get there by one Spirit baptism one birthing we are birthed into that body whose birth the seed the seed is birthed amen the seed is quickened the seed comes to life remember don't forget this as we go on the bride is the word living and in action all right so you see for he shall give his angels charge they'll keep pick thee up your feet will cover will trample under feet the dragon amen amen all right Thou shalt said because he has set his love upon me therefore deliver him I will set him on high because he hath known my name we're coming down to a different scripture in a minute about that name known my name known it okay he shall not just just not mentioning a name but you know it because because that happens to be your name also that's right Hallelujah wherever you dwell you're one with who you where you're dwelling right that dwelling where you live in is who you are yes all right now he shall call upon me he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble and I will deliver him and honor him are you going to have trouble yes but not there yes you have trouble but that dwelling place that faith that perfect faith of the son of God that Faith his faith can knows no hindrances that's a direct quote okay now in trouble I will deliver him with long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation aren't you happy that he has showed you and is showing you his salvation finished work all right you may be seated I'd like you to go to 1 John 4:4 I'm just going to read these I got other scriptures to read as we go along 1 John 4:4 I do not want to keep you tonight I just you just pull and God will speak 1 John 4:4 1 John 4 and4 says you are of God Amen little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you yes sir than he that is in the world well I might overcome them no you overcome them for greater is he that is in you than the outer man than the outer man that wants to just contrary every every word that God will speak to you you want to reason it out the flesh man see oh yeah it's still the flesh man's still carnal but the but the flesh man don't live in the soul anymore right Hallelujah carnal man see the carnal life carnal Spirit don't live there anymore it's dead so that old husband's dead you've been eternally separated from that Old husband I don't care what this feels like what it looks like how it is it's your enemy abolutely it's your enemy the greatest enemy I've got is David David is the greatest enemy I've got but he's conquered you are fighting a defeated enemy that's right Hallelujah you got to recognize he's defeated recognizing because you're recognizing who you are and your position in Christ amen greetings to those on the internet they meant to tell those whoever's on there amen greetings God bless you trust the word is is Quicken to you tonight we are we are we are we are we are we have received you that born again have received the Holy Spirit in you that spirit is a quickening spirit amen and is sent to you to Quicken every word to you amen it's the inside teacher when you receive him he's an inside teacher he's there to Quicken every predestinated word to you and he'll see to it that you because you're already in the Rapture and the Rapture is already a revelation to you you already have the Rapture because it's a revelation to you that's right you have to proceed to it because it's already substance amen well that was a good one amen amen remember and don't you ever forget Faith God's faith is revelation of his will the revelation of his word that's the faith of God yes amen what God recognizes is his faith he's only going to recognize one thing and that's his word Made Alive in you the token right that's the only thing that's going in the Rapture right amen amen amen you got to have the token so it's more than just believing a message it's living the message the only way you can live the message is for the token to live it through you amen you've got and the token has to be on display it's just not a secret boy about it the token will be living through you the token must be on display and you in order to be on display you have to apply it amen you apply it it must be on display all right it's not emotion it's a Living Word it's not your feelings it's not because you danced and shouted and spoke in tongues and could even prophesy those are all good but you can have that without the word in your soul right because your spirit can be anointed to do that but that word in you is going to recognize the day and hour which you live and will receive the word for the season and that's what we're wanting to hear we're wanting to hear the word preach for the season because there's where the bride will respond to because she's a he's a part of it amen amen she's a part of the season it's you're heing your season and there had to be a word spoken spoken spoken for you in this season for you to come alive to because God God's New Birth is a spoken word birth you're birthed under the word for the season Hallelujah that's the blood in effect we walk in the light as he is in the light the blood of Jesus Christ then cleanses us from all sin I I'm kind of pulling off here a little bit but it's all part of the sermon tonight all right let's go back to our scripture here I was reading you are of God little children have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen Psalms 18 I'm I'm sorry it's not Psalms it's Proverbs I wrote that down wrong Proverbs 18 The Book of Proverbs the 18th chapter very familiar scripture but remember I said I'd come back to that name we read there the name okay Proverbs 18 I my hands are just kind of shaking I'm trying to turn my Bibles Le uh Pages here and all right the 10th chapter that's first excuse me 18th chapter 10th verse the name of the Lord is a strong tower that's right is a strong tower the righteous runneth it's just a casual thing I'll believe this if I want to believe it I'll come to church when I want to come to chur church I I'll take the word when no it's not a you run into it this is your Refuge this is your safety place this is your dwelling house this is your life right the name of the Lord amen the name of the lord it's got to be in you that's right that's right it's got to be it's got to be there's got to be a name here you can run into and if you run into it then it's the person right the name of the Lord is not some imagination you're not just quoting a name in the past here you hold the name when the word speaks from you it's the name when the Holy Ghost prays through you it's in his name it's him speaking for it you got to recognize who you are and know that you speak for it when you pray in his name it's not a vain word amen it's not a vain name you're not just repeating a name you're actually speaking the name you're you're the the person himself speaking forth the word living speaking right now if it couldn't if if nothing could stand before that yesterday what about today it can't stand before that person yesterday how can to stand before that person today that person Jesus Christ who's revealed in you who you are right see you're not it can't be revealed than you and not be who you are because you're the new birth and the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ and I'll build my church upon that amen amen amen we might as well speak it plain absolutely you are of God yes amen you're birthed of God you came from God You Came From Heaven you're now here on Earth manifesting eternal life through a body of clay prise the Lord that's who you are is the eternal life amen that chokes the carnal man I know because he can't say A you make yourself God well brother brandham happened to say on the on the uh the uh mighty God unveiled he said that's not so far off the truth is it it just depends on which side you're looking at of the veil right said why you make these people you make yourself God he said that's not so far off the truth is it brother we are minor Gods we are the little God we are Adam was a god Eve was a god they were God they were under their God they were who he was just in a smaller form as children all right I got to stop going off of these and get to the message here I won't get done all right now so the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous runneth into it and is fearful unprotected no unsealed rewind rewind your Refuge your protection sir absolutely your lifeall your dwelling place no plague can come nigh that dwelling the Lord Satan's afraid to touch that that's right but he can touch the outer man trying to get you away from your position get you off of it and God said okay go ahead I'll let you touch them they'll go through pressures outside they'll go through trials but where they dwell you can't touch that you can't hold that and brother sister that means everything to us if we'd get the revelation of who we are and where we dwell we wouldn't fear what's coming around or maybe so and hope so and maybe so and not so but but but but if I have to go through this if I have to go through that you went through it because God allowed you and ordained for you to pass through that but it can't touch that Dwelling Place amen this is only a temporary tent don't you forget the real tent's waiting for you and he can't touch that one either hallu Hallelujah that's right if if this Tabernacle of our Earthly dwelling and old tent out here be dissolved we have one waiting and it happens to be Eternal the Lord You Can't Stop Eternal don't let the devil fool you can't stop Eternal that's right you just need to recognize by Revelation by Revelation who you are and when you go to speak let God Inspire it by Revelation and Quicken it to you inspire you to speak in it's not you the man speaking it's it's him speaking right because you said it in the name of Jesus Christ what do you expect to get then the manifestation of his promise because faith is speaking not just speaking it's Faith speaking he's a high priest of our confession is that right of Faith hold fast the confession of your faith absolutely amen amen God won't miss the time you just stand right there with a right mental attitude toward the word and see if he doesn't inspire you and Quicken to you when to speak and how to speak and believe it right there and it's done and you know it's done why it's revealed to you right amen amen remember he said a right mental attitude you give the word a right mental position and hold that steady with the word that's inside your soul and there's nothing going to stop that word from being manifest amen now that's a whole another message of attitude yeah amen so all right now so let's look at this a minute 713 says the Lord is my habitation my strong habitation you don't have to turn to that I just I'll just uh just refer to it he said it's my strong habitation he he said he said be thou my strong habitation where where unto I may continually Resort thou thou Hast given commandment to save me for thou art my rock and my Fortress Psalm 62 said he's my rock he's my Revelation he's my refuge he's my strength amen if you go to Psalm 626 and 7 nothing and and the and David says he is my rock and I shall not be moved he is my ref refug and I shall not be moved oh David you were just moved yesterday you went through pressures and you went through this and you got a little excited and you that wasn't him that's what we've got to recognize you have two Natures here in the same body and that one in the soul is who you are this out here is not who you are this has UPS in its downs and it's done this and it's sought this and you said this when you shouldn't have said this and you had this attitude and the attitude and the devil said see there you aren't what you thought you were I happened to know that's not me that's right the word revealed in me cannot be plagued that's right and there's all kinds of plagues out here in the Earth today there's nudity plagues Insanity plagues right absolutely nervous plagues right everything you want to come along and try to plague you with the devil will try to do it but he's got to have permission but it will not move your Dwelling Place therefore it can't move you right got to recognize your position you're now seated in Heavenly places in Christ with every devil under your feet every devil he put them under our feet the Bible said he put them under our feet he put them under his feet the Bible said his feet well that happens to be our feet not human feet the bride the body of Christ amen that's under his feet right amen he is our dwelling all right a plague if you were going to give it a a a a meaning plague means a stroke plague disease Mark plague spot plague spot befall means it see uh I just said it will no evil shall befall let's read that again let's go back there and pick that up in Psalm 91 verse 9 because verse uh 10 there shall no evil befall thee befall as to meet encounter approach or be opportune no plague no evil shall befall thee Nei neither or neither shall any plague stroke plague disease mark spot you come nigh nigh nigh means to come near approach enter into draw near so you see it's not talking about this old flesh man it just I just read it here he's my dwelling he's my habitation you're in Christ God brought you in Christ you've passed from Death To Life you've resurrected what a resurrection that was at Calvary on that Easter Sunday the Sunday but we're in the Sunday again and what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is this is to be resurrected out of Dead denominationalism come out of that dead you can't find the living among the dead so quit looking around among the dead to find the living right you're going to find him outside of That Shook is where you're finding him he's come out of the Shu the brides come out the Lord right good Absolut amen that's right brother M said the shuck is dead said frankly it's dead and dried up right right and you and the the bride is raptured out of that this is the light time this is seed time this is the grain again this is Christ unveiled in you the mystery of Jesus Christ the finished complete mystery of the whole thing he's already taken the book that contained it and loosed it you're the seventh seal revealed right prise God you're the mystery when you see the mystery revealed When You See It revealed when you see the mystery that was hid I'm getting a little ahead of myself right here then you see your name because you're the mystery amen of the book right that's right brother BR says not calling your name like David deard Orman Neville he said it's the mystery that's revealed that's who you are you're the mystery read what the mystery of what what's Christ who is Christ The Mystery of God revealed and all that Christ was he poured into his bride then who's the bride the mystery of C of God the mystery of God or mystery of Christ revealed yeah right unveiled that's to you personally he would make this known to individuals not to groups individuals and individuals in their position know their place in the body they're not willing to take somebody else's place compare themselves with them because they know who they are they know they are an attribute measure of God himself amen now just lot a little bit ahead of myself but nigh so it can't even come nigh your dwelling the Bible said come nigh your dwelling your dwelling this is the word dwelling home dwelling home habitation what's that word dwelling your home your dwelling your habitation amen if this is my home I'm a man most miserable because I'll tell you what that's what the that's what that's what Paul said if I have if I how do you say that now if I if I in this life only have hope I have a men all men most miserable amen so see it's not there it's in Christ you're not miserable in Christ you're alive in Christ it's not a misery to In Christ it's a rejoicing it's a revelation upon Revelation upon Revelation from glory to glory to glory till we step into that final manifestation of his glory the rapture's already begun it's already revealed the bride the to the bride she's only one that's in the Rapture the Rapture is only for her yes because she's come out this is light time this is the age of beond the shook it's bride age and brother brandham said it's Rapture age Hallelujah and he shall descend with a message with the voice of the resurrection and the Trump of God he does all three while he descends amen and brother Brown said see the Lord himself descends and it said see here here he is here he is picture was taken right who's he uniting with his bride his word Thy word Shall Not Be Moved right I'm want to sing that after service the word shall not be moved why you're the word it can't be moved he's the word whatever he is you are all that he is you are and all that you are he isise the Lord unveiling of God unveiling of what who are you right you're the finished mystery of himself you're the complete revelation of the whole [Music] thing he held that as a mystery and wouldn't let that loose until this until the until the end time he kept it hid but he said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God would be finished righten who's the finished mystery of H of himself then see there it is you're the finished mystery yes brother brandham even said that he had one portion that he couldn't complete all that he had in his day so now he works in and through his bride you're the finished mystery you're the complete Myster mystery you're the finished mystery of himself he's not complete without the bride so there must be himself to be in Bride form for himself to be revealed the son of man's revealed again Hallelujah you talk about our message that's our message the message is simple it's eternal life in you that's the message it's God Jesus Christ in the bride form that's the message we're going and if we don't come to that Revelation you can't meet him in the air because it takes that Union to come to the meeting in the air glory to God hallelujah you type that in Abraham and Sarah go all all the way through the Bible with it all the way from Genesis you see the seventh seal revealed brother brand preached Christ The Mystery of God revealed it was the seventh seal he was preaching right absolutely the whole thing was underneath that seven seal all the mystery of it but had to be opened up if that wasn't opened up there would be no there would be no Rapture right but the Rapture was promised in this hour so that mystery of himself had to be fully completed revealed Hallelujah that's why re Revelation is so important to us all right you are in this Refuge Christ my rock just back and then and let off the pressure I'm here by the grace of God in the safety zone nothing can harm me now nothing can harm me now why in Christ I'm protected by the blood of Jesus Christ see the token identifies you are covered by the blood without the token you don't know that amen right because the token identifies that you come through the blood that's why the tokens required see the token testifies of that to you what is the token the literal life of Jesus Christ in you then predestinated as he was makes the seed Word Flesh in you like it was in him right not the fullness that was in him you're the majure you're the measure this is a measure but you're still him I don't care if you have a spoonful of him you're him absolutely right glory to God see this this this is what we pray for I don't know where that last one is but let that last one get a hold of that Revelation then what's going to happen the Rapture is revealed to her it's a revelation to her and if it's a revelation you in order to come to the full Resurrection in order to come to the full marriage in order to come to the full change it must be by Revelation yes praise God faith faith right amen amen amen so where's your absolute see what you looking for what are you searching out what are you seeking seek and you shall find right what are you seeking for more of him there's more of him for you there's a deep call to the Deep there's got to be a deep to respond to that call that's right that's right hallelujah amen see I'm protected by the blood of Jesus Christ a company of angels are encamped around me about me where we're in we're in the Refuge and have fellowship with him amen are you in the Refuge tonight it's a refuge it's a place to let off the pressure it's a city of what they call those cities cities of uh Refuge I guess what yeah City's a refuge are you in the city it's called Bethlehem House of God's bread that's right are you in the dwelling place are you drinking from the fountain are you walking in the light as he is in the light then you have Fellowship one with another right one with another who you and who him and you can't have fellowship with the body of Christ until you come into him right because there's only one place he put his name and only one place you can worship amen that's right and the worship is not just in truth it's in spirit and Truth amen you got to be in the light to have true worship you've got to be walking in the light you got to be walking with God to see the to to manifest to see and to behold the Simplicity of the Rapture you got to be walking with God that's what Enoch did and he was not not right like a cat I won't let that old Cat in here meow all he wants okay all right the great safety zone where all the devil's darts are passed away you must be in the you you when you're in the great safety zone the name of the Lord a mighty tower where all the devil's darts are passed away and anchored in Christ safe as we can be in there safe as you can can be in there when you're in there you're safe as you can be am all right in Christ sealed in there by the Holy Ghost you've got to be sealed sealed is not just having an emotion a ceiling is a ceiling you say a person says I'm sealed and then live some other life than the promised word for the season they weren't sealed they say they're sealed and have no revelation of the day and the hour which they're living in and can't are walking in the light still hanging to Old denomination see and and then but they've come in contact with the light and refuse it it's not sealed you can't be you can't have the Holy Ghost dwelling in you and not recognize the day and hour you're living and recognize your position in him you can't disbelieve the word when he's living in you he's the believer right that's right prise the faith of God in you is the believer go back and see if he didn't say that in perfect Faith the faith of God that dwells in you is the believer so recognize your position who you are see all right Christ the word is our absolute in every situation circumstance perfect Faith Masters every circumstance say well I I I did I I felt that I did that I forget about your eyes foret right either you accept that or you don't accept it see because the Bible said Galatians 2:20 I live by the faith of the Son of God what a resurrection this is from Death to life no more I that liveth but Christ and the life I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God the life I now live is the token God recognizes that token he'll never let go of that he he said once it's there it's there it'll never be removed he doesn't give it to you and take it away thank you Jesus thank you Jesus he doesn't put Christ inside of you then take it out it'll never leave you no matter how bad it gets no matter how much the outside has to go through this Refuge you're in this Dwelling Place canot be moved that's right God hallelujah no plague can come nigh that prise God Lord you see what is God trying to tell you you're more than a conqueror sir I've done conquered for you I've done rose up for you I've done everything every bit of life that's required for you to live I lived in Jesus Christ you're already done accepted in the Beloved you're already accepted you have the token already testifies you've come through his blood you are now accepted in the Beloved you've already been received in him every bit of what God required has been lived out in Jesus Christ for you because you were in him then yeah amen you died with him you Rose with him my that's right do I hear an amen that's the truth he's already been accepted for you you and you have the token identifying that's where you were when he went there you went there in him he was the fullness of the godhead bodily you were there where were you you were there you took the Judgment of sin in his body he lived a life that was accepted of God he accepted you glory to God he's always been your dwelling Hallelujah you just need to recognize it in the day you live because you come down here in a body of clay that you needed to have a birth again a new birth but you when the birth when the promised word for the season come forth and you've seen it manifested it's like that little voice on the inside of that eagle something responded to that voice because you came in contact with the voice you saw the voice manifested the word manifested through a bride Hallelujah all right I may not get through this message but I'm pretty well getting through it I'm just not reading some of the quotes now you say how do we know we're dwelling in him let's go to 1 John 4:13 1 John 4:13 chapter 4 1 John 4 and 13 hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he ha given us his token that's right right that's right his Spirit that's how we know the Lord because that spirit will receive the word that Spirit has a clear understanding that spirit will lead you into all truth when you see that manifesting in you and seeing that working not something you pump up and work up and have to say Glory Hallelujah all the time to get it to operate I'm not against that please forgive me I I'm not against saying Glory Hallelujah I'm probably very vocal because I love the I love the word right but that that's not your evidence your evidence is being able to receive I already brought that forth in the last meeting the genuine EV or the meeting before that I guess genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost in you was being able to receive the word for your day and our because it's revealed to you personally and it operates and it's working right amen amen so how do we we know we're in him by his spirit that he given us we know we dwell dwell dwell dwell that's right dwell right that's your house that's your home that's your dwelling all right all right see so let's go over real quick to 2 Corinthians 4 2 Corinthians 4 and verse s but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us you see you got to realize you're a weakling that's right God has put Talent inside of you when you were born you need to just give it to God not use it the wrong way but give it back to God put it in the bank put it in his hands but now there's talents that are you that are that are man-made talents brother Bram said God can't use those man-made talents that's right man-made intellectually made right God doesn't need he said brother Bram said God doesn't need I don't want to discourage anybody you say I could be pretty discouraging Brother David you just keep right on if you're feeling led to do what you're doing keep going right but if you're trying to produce something just remember just just remember you've got to come to this place that you're nothing and nothing plus nothing equals nothing right you're nothing without him you're nothing you can do nothing you're a nobody and nothing and and Moses had to come to that place and every one of us have to come to that place so that you can yield to him as long as you think you're something and have an ability a man made ability I know I can do this and I'll do it for him brother say he don't need that what he needs is your submission to him amen then let him guide you to do it because you know in yourself see sometimes you get so upset with yourself because you can't do it praise the lord well then just give it to God give it to God just let go and give it to God put a gift in your life give it to God and let go to it and let God use it amen well I just know I could study this and it would be usable of God no I I'm I'm sorry didn't come that way well I can take some psychology and bring it out to the people no no just leave your own psychology put it in the basket we don't need that we need revealed truth you need the word living in you'll take care of every one of your needs and your struggles and your strife let God do it we get in a hurry and think we've got to do it we've got to produce something we've got to do it that's denominationalism right am boy I'm saying some hard things tonight and I'm not afraid to offend anybody amen I don't I'm not saying that to be mean I'm not saying it to offend I'm saying it because I'm inspired to say it right amen it's the truth it's the truth then just line up with the truth say God I can't line up with the truth lord I can't that's where I want you yeah right that's where I want you I want you to let go of your cans and realize you can't and then give yourself to God and let me do it and do it the way I want to do it let me do it the sovereignly the way I want to do but Lord it might be contrary to what people think and what they how I feel in my reasoning nonsense right that's not your confidence is in your ability yourself or yourself or your reasoning or your feelings you have no confidence in that therefore we have no confidence in man amen Philippians 3:3 but we got all kinds of confidence where we dwell because we're dwelling in Christ now let me just quickly hurry through this I know you're letting me I'm just taking it all right when God and His word becomes one now watch what he says I'm I'm a Branham because I was born of Charles and Ella Branham Charlie and Ella they made me a Branham because of their seed their two agreements with their sperm Together made a seed and that made me that's natural right there had to be a ground to receive the germ from the man you understand that all right now to put it in the spiritual there had to be something there to receive right in uride and brother Bram said actually he said that seed was planted in you before the foundation of the world I've got the quote right here if you want it all right he said here he said then when God and His word becomes one God and His word becomes one when God's spirit Waters the seed of God the word of God it produces God it's not the individual wooo Glory I'm glad I'm out of the picture but the picture I'm in the picture amen because what is the picture the seals unveil the picture all right when God and His word becomes one when God's spirit Waters the seed of God the word of God it produces God and it's not the individual it's God for what you are dead you're not yourself no more you reckon Yourself Dead hollowed out waiting for the seed germ then what is it it isn't you no more it isn't the man it's God in the man amen right right see it's the seed germ like the beginning spoken word it's God's word made manifest in the man brother Chris if you're listening I stole your quote confession yeah but it wasn't just your quote I have as much hold on that as you do you know I'm only fooling with you right you can you can quote it anytime you feel led to quote it all right all right but I love it because it's personalized to me and it's becoming more personalized to me all Every day see this is our Victory we got to recognize this old man's been defeated it's that's not our victory in this our Victory is this promised word right here unveiled in you you're the mystery unveiled now you're the people of the open book now you're seeing your name because there's only one name given among men there's only one name and one place of worship right all right it's not you anymore okay God give over to God see you can't be a hybd and a son at the same time see it's either a son of death or son of life so if it's a son of death give it over to the devil let him kill it give it he said no he said he paused he said' give it over to God I mean and let him kill the devil that's in you run him out run him out Hollows you out empties you out see all right then let God plant his own life that germ that was to be you find you let let the god plant his own life in you then it's not you no more wo makes me excited it's not you stimulation of Revelation it's not you no more see it's not you no more more it's God's life because it's the God's word watered by the holy spirit will produce the same thing you see it he said greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world what is in you that's greater Christ the anointed word God that was in Christ which was the Revelation mystery of himself God that was in Christ is in you greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world then if he in you it's not you living anymore right it's not anymore you living that's right if God Christ is in you it's not anymore you living that's awesome can we receive that amen amen thank the lord we can receive it say God keep revealing it to me because that's what's taking you to a body change that's it all right he said he said it's not he said it's not your thinking what you think about this it's what he said about this then if he is in you because you have his mind see you have his intelligence then God poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into his bride he now wants he now works in and through I'm just quickly running through this you are the word to begin with himself you are the word himself to begin with you were Eternal in him you had your time and season to come to the Earth see God planted you here all right he said you were the word to begin with you were himself the book He's see now watch I'm going to read a little further now he says now see that he was he see now watch Moses he said let be back up here then if he's in you he absolutely would not deny what he said he couldn't do it but he would keep what he he would keep what he said and he is trying to find that person that can vindicate himself through what's he looking for that seed that he can vindicate himself through because he works in and through the bride the final complete revelation of himself see now see then see that he was born Moses was born with his great gifts and quality there's a quality was in him it's in youde then had only taken something to flash across that that to bring that thing to life what had to flash across it the manifested word in its season all right that's who the bride is that's who Christ is all right so now he says now you see see the seed of God is actually placed in us from the foundation of the world and when that light first strikes the seed it brings it to life but the light first has to come upon the seed and when God in his Mercy rent The Veil he was brought into Plain View are you with me what about when this veil's rent into two from top to bottom what's going to come in plain view it identifies what's in you because when he when he would brought in plain view it found out it wasn't behind the curtains that rented from top to bottom when he was rent there's your mercy seat here's your mercy seat here's the Throne of God right talk about Mercy brother Paul put Sunday there's Mercy for the bride is that right certainly and as long as the bride's on Earth there's Mercy right then if he's on Earth where is he what form is he in amen whose flesh did he come in where's this coming of the Lord that's supposed to come to gather us and bring us up where we need to be for the capturing away the caught the the final catching away you're being caught away right now from Revelation to Revelation but what's the final catch up who are we going to meet but you've got to be changed from the inside out to meet him amen all right now see same now God rent The Veil now what brother Ram saying unveiling of God he said he's come in full View of you bride he's come in full view of you bride okay what did he say from that he said he said the book of his life the mystery of himself in Bride form is what you are the mystery finished the finished mystery the complete revelation of himself the seven seal message of the seventh angel the message of Revelations 10 of the seventh angel the mystery revealed to you is when you see your name in the book you are claimed you enter into Union with him you see yourself you see yourself you were already ready he's already ordained it and they went in with him to the marriage let us be glad and rejoice the marriage has come we're going to a wedding supper he's pouring in himself pouring in himself into you what did the brother Brown say when he did did that what was happening for he's pouring himself into you for the wedding supper all right he said he said we are it's a it's a it's a spiritual union right all right he said now but it has to be a spiritual union the only thing that's lasting only thing it's going to hold all right now same Now All That Glory was hid to them unbelievers by the veil he said so All That Glory hid that Glory hid and we are his glory I think how many y preach brother Bram preached it over and over again but I took a sermon on that we are his glory he doesn't share it with another he shares it with himself that's right amen because you're his glory that's absolutely right could we had several Scriptures it keeps in fact that keeps piling up scriptures to me I I don't have enough paper to write the notes okay okay but look said now all that Glory hid is hid for you is hid for us in Christ the word you ready the next statement who is our Temple Christ the word who is our Temple amen then where's your dwelling that's it Christ the word which is our Temple it's hid for you in there and when you enter into that little room inside of the inside he said you're in his presence and what does that make you that makes you part of that shakina glory amen amen what what was he preaching the unveiling of God what what why would he have to preach that it's a full unveiling and only the brid will see it right why because she has the receiving in her to receive it she's got a predestinated seed germ laying there amen it took the life to catch it Hallelujah okay let's see if we can't tie this up now you are you are a part of him as long as Christ is in you as Christ was of God because God was in him made him God what about Christ in you what's it going to make you okay that's Christ was in you and as Christ is in you the hope of glory you become part of Christ which is part of God because God in Christ brother R say I thought used to be one was one was the Holy Spirit and the other was he said but they're the same person all right it's just simply the revelation of the mystery of God revealed to you and in you personally that's the bride stand right no matter what anyone else says no matter what happens she knows where she is who she is and where she's dwelling and no plague can come nigh that dwelling you're going to be there you're going to Rapture you're going to be Chang changed and there's no nothing and nobody and nothing can stop it nothing can hinder it it can't come close to it then where is your confidence land is in him leading you amen all right now but if you're born again you're alive with Christ your affections on things above not on things of the earth Colossians 3:2 if you are born again see on that you're the seat of God actually plac it before the foundation world and the light strikes that seed let you put this down go to 2 Corinthians 4:6 because God who spoke the light into existence has shined in your heart what's he shining in your heart to do unveil a person that's the mystery there's your name in the book all right see the death death cannot touch you when you're born again you're Eternal with him if you're born to the spirit of God you you become part of God and are Eternal with him then death cannot touch you when you're born again you are Eternal if death can't touch you what about the rest of these things not even death can touch you right and they're all part of death they're all an attribute of death and he said death can't touch you that's right okay you are he said you are Eternal when you're born again death can't touch you because you are Eternal you have changed from a creature of time to a creature of Eternity you have changed from death into life unto life I'm talking about eternal from Eternal death to eternal life Colossians 1:13 turn to me over there real quickly and we'll try to wrap this down Colossians 1:13 he says who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated that's means changed or caught or raptured you have he ha translated us into the kingdom of his dear son now that's not my body that's my soul right are you with me Colossians 1:13 okay into the kingdom of his dear son okay then it goes down let's go over here to the to the um verse 26 even the mystery even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is the mystery of God revealed in you amen praise the Lord Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach I Don't Preach ourselves we preach him whom we preach that's what you're hearing tonight we're preaching him brother D but you just don't know how weak I am but you know how strong he isise that's the difference and put yourself back in him and say God you've already this is your word this is your promise this is where I know I dwell is in you everything you purchase for me is mine all of it is mine right and whatever God will Quicken to you is yours he said all right now 27 okay I read that okay I'll stop right there on that brother brandom in the book communion he says this he talking about that little flower where'd you come from you kind of understand what I'm coming from here he says he said I was born of Charles and El Bram and in their nature I was a sinner I came to the world a liar all the habits of the world was right in me but down in there too was another nature present see predestinated predestinated was in there by God in this same body two Natures in there yeah one black dog and there's a white dog all right well I catered to one as I grow I grewed as a baby dad D first thing I be became a liar everything else it's a sinner because I was raised up that way watch little watch the little uh uh Samuel and watch the little uh dein and watch how quick they want to slap one another down and pinch and bite and right what's doing that need a birth a new birth but right now they don't know what they're doing but that's why the parents need to start training now right because it's going to it's going to speak to them don't wait until they get old enough be teenagers and then try to change them you start molding you start training I don't know why I'm on that subject but you start training and molding that child in the way he should go start pouring in the word start pouring in the seed start pouring in life start bringing him in connection with that and let him see it lived in you if you have the Holy Ghost going to be lived in you amen you have a token to apply two Natures okay I don't want to get so caught up in this I take too much time CU I'm just about out of time that little flower he turns around and says now I went Co hunting and I'd do this and I lived over that and i' come home and they'd still party you know and all these things and I'd make a Windbreak and I'd be out there with my dog and he said i' seen the ground freeze to the winter had a fire over a certain area and all those circumstances situations but there was that flower next spring now you know it had to be a seed laying in that ground if the seed was in the ground and the light comes upon on that seed or the rain it's falling upon good ground right that right why because the seeds there what is that ground that brother man it was the heart that the Bible spoke of it was the heart thistles rocks but then good yes was the condition the ground was the heart not your flesh man the heart am amen all right then the then the tears he's a creator of all the the Earth and he SED his seed in the Earth all right I just hold on I'm about done okay this five minutes is going to make a difference Bud okay now now that's my brother I can talk to him like that he understands that language I'm firstborn too no I'm just I just forget that all right now who planted you now watch what he says where did you come from flower then he turned around and asked the same question who's he asking it to me I'm reading it you you're reading it he says well where' you come from he says who came out here and planted you what hot house did you bring you out of where'd you come from see what denomination did see what hot house that Little Flower I'd say Wyatt was froze and everything and I build a fire besides the freezing element as a heat element and all where'd you come from what was it there was another William brandham see another William brandom see a little spot of eternal life down there it couldn't have in there unless God placed it there that's right see your evidence then watch how this worked it was down there from the genes of God the word of God that was placed in there predestinated there placed in there each one of you can think of similar things it was working now I'm going to skip some and I'm going to look here yet all at once as I walked on that voice was talking don't never Smoke Drink You young fellas all over the see there was something moving already moving working in the body he said what was working down there it was eternal life working in the body what brought you here see where'd you come from you're back here again see there's something he said and I'm he said all at once I looked up that's just exactly what's happened all at once I looked up up who turned my [Music] head who turned my heart why would I respond to the word the next one next to me wouldn't have nothing to do with it okay he said he said now all at once I looked up and watch what he says I'm not the son of Charles and Ella branam this is the son of a union of Bob and Joan dehart but who am I really who's the real me thank God for my parents I thank God I come in this body but laying in there was something working it's still working all right he said from the genes he said from the genes of God I'm I'm not the son there's something calling my little Eagle I'm not a chicken there's something up yonder oh great Jehovah who you are open up I want to come home there's something in me calling then I was born again Watch how simple I was born again that little life was laying there the Water of Life was poured upon it and it began to grow amen now life was forgiven put in the sea of forgiveness that past life that old husband never to be remembered against me no more then who brings it to your remembrance all right then you know where you are you have authority over him all right now now but if you're born again you're alive in Christ you're part of him your affections are on things above and not on things of the earth amen all right now predestinated as he was makes the word see flesh in you the church as it was in him what's the secret of this I won't read when he what he said and pick up your pen and write except this portion you know about the harmony you can read that Harmony to exist all right watch what he said but here's the secret of this here's the secret of this harmony here's the secret see his word the bride's going to receive it she never doubts it but here's the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary but now I want to point you to something I'm pointing this to who you are you're the word in there who is in Mary right the creative spoken creative word is that right that's you he's talking about here right Mary was the Shu he had to come out of the Shu now you see what day you're in he had to come out of the Shu but you were the word that was in that Shu you were that predestinated here's the secret the word was laying there waiting for the light to shine on it just like he said it was laying there it was birthed in there excuse me the light shined on it it was given a birth now it's still laying it may be laying in That Shook but watch he had to come out of that so he's pointing to this fact that you are that word in there the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs a command of the word in his name see then when she commands the word in his name she has thus sayeth the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that's planted and watered it comes to harvest full Harvest serving its purpose now I am closing but I've got to close with this quote I know it's 9006 you're overtime Brother David don't you know your overtime no because I got to read this one more quote all right this is paragraph 172 and I this is in the message um well I I won't say what it you can look it up because I don't have the name of it right in front of me look here here's a little lady twisting herself down the street the reason I'm blaming this in here because there's a lot more plagues than just your feeling and sickness and look at the plagues of nudity oh Absolut and what's sad is walking down message aisles tight dress is so tight it shows every move they make don't tell me that's of God you're taking on The Same Spirit you're trying to compromise with the world you're trying to live between those two Realms right that's a plague that's hit a lot of the message churches but it can't come nigh your dwelling and if it can't come nigh your dwelling then take authority over that they I won't give you that place because that inside of you will stop it it won't let you do it amen it's a holy God okay now watch but here goes this lady twisting down the street Street this is for young fellows now here's a young man his eyes catches it he's a member of the church he's a Pentecostal he's whatever he is I'm glad he said that because he couldn't be a message follower therefore no now he says whatever he is but the first thing you know there's no hold poost in there what's he talking about in there the soul she'll say hello he's got her curly hair and kind of nice looking straight shouldered young man maybe tried to tried to live right she started walking up to him even a preacher the first thing you know what is it this out here this flesh desire and the spirit Little Spirit second realm the spirit down there yet anointed saying don't do it don't do it but what will it do it'll move right around there hold there it goes first thing you know he's trying to make a date with her he's com guilty of committing adultery whether he touches her or not but a genuine listen to these words I'm not going to try to preach on this I just want to read it but a genuine Born Again Son of God Amen you can't do it yourself it's totally impossible for a red-blooded male to walk before a female like that without something taking place I don't care you've got that that thing will walk there if you're not careful even a genuine child of God a Son of God there's an effect that if you gaze upon that that's going to affect your body it's going to do something you got to take your eyes off of that and the Holy Ghost in you will take your eyes off of that and don't take the second look all right are you with me okay because you know you're meeting that every single day absolutely absolutely nudity painted on us basically all right now first thing now you move around okay there it goes and a red blooded male okay without something taking place but when but when there is something on the inside he's going down the soul again that little born against something here though that man might have shouted spoken tongues jumped dance everything else Anointed with the spirit done all of the one signs and wonders that God said in here by his spirit Jesus said because why he's anointed do you see how the two Spirits can be so close you can't judge people that's not the fruit the fruit is the word for the season their teaching is what is in air these false prophets their teaching is what is in air not their not their signs and wonders not their miracles not their faith for healing it's their teaching they do not recognize the word for the season so so their teaching is false and they are false prophets they're trying to teach a season past and not the season now you don't judge the man by his signs and wonders and how much he can cast out Devils you judge him by what he lives is it the word and what he teaches if he's a preacher what he's preaching is a word for the season amen and the life he lives is the word for the season that's the fruit the fruit for the season if there's be oranges this season it'll be oranges not grapefruit not lemons not tangelos because the tree at the top has put forth another limb from the root and it's genuine orange because it's an orange tree and it's genuine Christ in you the flesh is becoming word and the word's becoming the flesh what is he saying it's coming to a body change amen all right now quickly I didn't mean to say all that many of you will come in my name saying Lord see they do all that by the same anointing the anointing is all right nothing wrong with the anointing the false is not the anointing the false is what they are in the soul it's not the word it's not the word it's not the seed right the seed is what makes the difference why couldn't Cain receive the Vindicated word right before him because he was not God's seed he wasn't Adam seed all right see you can't put that in there but if there's a call in your heart I've got to have God as a young person I want him you didn't put that there you couldn't put the desire there there's something in you working that you as a young man don't know nothing about and it's working despite yourself it's working in you there's something that keeps drawing you to the word well I don't understand it you said you didn't say you had to understand it do you believe it God will take care of the revealing of it amen there's something in you I can't get away from this this is right I know this is truth you didn't put that there you didn't put the desire for God in you though you're pressured out here to try to do this and that and reason with it okay I know I'm late not too late right on time I only heard one amen that's all right all right many of you will come in that day and say Lord haven't I Prof prophesied in your name haven't I cast out devils in your name it's all true nobody can cast out a devil but God you know Satan can't cast out Satan nobody can heal but God but what are those false prophets and teachers working under that Spirit right but false in their teaching do you understand see how close the two Spirits are see one's a denominational Affair an organizational Affair that won not and cannot and will not receive the word for the hour and the time that's right and take offense to it and the other is a pure word and loves it because it's Christ again okay I'm closing that's that's I'm closing but down the inside of that man see depart from me I don't know you you've done all this but I don't know you workers of iniquity you know something you should do and you don't do it see just like Cain just like Esau just like on and on and on but down on the inside of that man Soul realm is that little TI poost in there that seat of God that was predestinated before the foundational world I don't care what takes place it holds him it's there to stay praise the Lord how many say praise the lord it's there to stay is that wonderful you hold that revelation of Christ in you it's there to stay there enough not enough devils in Hell could get you to stop that or get you even out of your position all right it's there to stay praise the Lord and when God hides anything it's act it's really hid listen to David and I'm closing on this listen to David here what he said in Psalms 27 when God hides anything it's hid that's all there is to it when God hides anything it's hid Tim I didn't mean I understand if you got to go I was goofing with you but I think you took a little offense to it and I don't blame you for doing it okay but but I think it doesn't hurt you and I just I I felt enough for you that I think you need to hear the rest of it as with myself I'm not talking about just you Psalm 27 but I know God will take care of that boy's sleep you watch and see if he doesn't you honor his word he'll honor you all right Psalm 27 verse four one thing I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life now we could go right on the what is the house Body of Christ yes sir that's right you're birth in there what is the body of Christ it's all Christ every member is all Christ all right all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple who' we say that who brother BR say the temple your temple was for in the time of trouble is this the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion hide me in his [Music] Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he's not going to hide me just out the open going hide me in the secret he shall hide me the revealed word is a secret He Shall Set me upon a revealed word Rock okay now when God hides anything it's really hid that's reason you're so hid if you're a Christian you're so dead and your life is so hid in God through Jesus Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost now he which establishes US with you in Christ and hath anointed us as of God who hath also sealed us and give us the earnest of the spirit in our hearts second Corinthians 1:21 and 22 has sealed us all right how is the devil if you're so hid in God your life is hid in God through Jesus Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost how is the devil going to find you he can't do it you're hid God hidees you amen what a hiding place in the bosom of Jesus Christ Our habitation our dwelling or aren't you glad you're headd oh a hiding place for you must reckon yourself dead in your life and your life in Christ hid in Christ sealed Away by the Holy Ghost the devil couldn't find you if he had to he couldn't do it you're hid in Christ the devil can't get to you am ohoo boy so who's you this or this word revealed word the devil can't get to you you're Christ that's your dwelling I in Christ Christ in me amen Christ in me I in him that's right you abide in me and my word in you brother BR said you know who you are okay it's not you anymore living it's the word all right devil can't get to you he has to come through the same process you did he can't do it because he has to come through the same process you did he'd have to Justified Sanctified and baptize with the Holy Ghost and that requires death he's already death he he can't die to he can't die to himself he can't he can't come through the blood right okay the devil can't do that you come through the same process if he did he'd be your brother so he can't get to you amen he can't come through that blood you are Christ the
