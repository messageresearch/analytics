[38:28] i want you not literally but i want you
[38:31] to white out enoch put your name in
[38:34] there
[38:35] that our heart's desire would be that we
[38:38] would walk with god and we would live
[38:41] pleasing
[38:43] not live you see the scripture doesn't
[38:44] say he lived religious
[38:47] that's right he lived pleasing
[38:50] amen quite a difference because we can
[38:51] be religious without being pleasing
[38:54] but if you are pleasing then god will
[38:56] put the right spirit on you to live
[38:59] amen hallelujah to be found worthy is
[39:02] our hearts desire today amen let's turn
[39:05] in esther the third chapter and today i
[39:08] want to just kind of uh uh i'm going to
[39:11] take a thought and i'm going to as it
[39:13] were stretch it out saint so i i hope
[39:16] today that your mind's uh your approach
[39:18] to the word of god would be i guess you
[39:20] would say elastic
[39:22] uh because sometimes we have these
[39:24] things hidden in the word of god there's
[39:26] types there's shadows there's things
[39:27] that are interconnected because he's the
[39:30] same yesterday today and forever so
[39:32] whatever pattern he used in the
[39:34] beginning we can anchor our soul on that
[39:36] same pattern today knowing that if god
[39:39] healed then he heals now if he delivered
[39:41] then he delivers now if he's saved then
[39:44] he saves now
[39:45] if he gave eternal life then he gives
[39:47] eternal life now
[39:48] amen and if he says i love you to them
[39:51] he says i love you to you
[39:54] amen
[39:57] after these things did king
[39:59] a hazaris
[40:00] promote haman the son of a matthew
[40:03] the agtite
[40:05] and advanced him and set his seed above
[40:08] all the princes that were with him
[40:10] now expand your
[40:12] thinking my brother and sister
[40:16] some things took place before
[40:19] the earth
[40:21] would be as we know it now some things
[40:23] took place in heaven
[40:25] some things were fulfilled or magnified
[40:30] and set his seat above all the princes
[40:32] that were with him
[40:33] and all the king's servants that were in
[40:35] the king's gate bowed and reverenced
[40:37] haman for the king had so commanded
[40:40] concerning him
[40:41] but mordecai
[40:43] bowed not nor did him reverence
[40:46] then the king's servants which were in
[40:48] the king's gate said to mordecai why
[40:51] transgressors thou the king's
[40:52] commandment
[40:54] now came to pass when they spoke daily
[40:57] unto him
[40:59] and he hearkened not unto them that they
[41:02] told haman to see whether mordecai's
[41:04] matters would stand for he had told them
[41:07] that he was a jew and when haman saw
[41:09] that mordecai bowed not nor did him
[41:12] reverence
[41:13] then was haman full of wrath
[41:18] and he thought scorn to lay hands on
[41:20] mordecai
[41:21] alone
[41:23] for they had showed him the people of
[41:25] mordecai wherefore haman sought to
[41:27] destroy all the jews that were
[41:29] throughout the whole kingdom
[41:31] of hazras
[41:33] even the people
[41:34] of mordecai
[41:36] now in this interesting saints if i
[41:38] could interject this
[41:41] you have one son or daughter of god
[41:43] stand up
[41:45] and say you know what it's been revealed
[41:47] to me of the word
[41:50] devil i'm done with you pushing back
[41:53] you know the devil doesn't just come to
[41:55] that man or woman's house
[41:57] he gets angry at the whole body of
[41:59] believers
[42:01] because you see he's afraid that the
[42:03] revelation of deliverance
[42:06] would come to the whole body
[42:09] and when the revelation of deliverance
[42:11] comes to the whole body
[42:13] satan's got trouble on his hands
[42:15] now if one's got a victory over here and
[42:17] everybody else is sitting there under
[42:19] the cloud woe unto me
[42:22] then satan says that's fine because
[42:23] after a while the people will view that
[42:25] one as a fanatic
[42:27] they'll view that one as being a little
[42:29] far out on the limb
[42:32] because the rest of us
[42:34] have no joy no victory
[42:36] no answered prayer
[42:40] but
[42:42] amen one of the most contagious things i
[42:44] was just texting with brother greg
[42:46] alford he gives greetings to you also
[42:49] he was like brother paul
[42:52] we're doing well here
[42:54] we have
[42:56] overcome
[42:59] we've had coven
[43:01] even though we're double vaccinated
[43:05] but all is well
[43:07] amen
[43:09] now you see my brother and sister we
[43:11] look at these things of the world and
[43:13] the world says this is what you've got
[43:14] to conform to
[43:16] hallelujah i hope you understand this
[43:18] this morning you rebels
[43:22] but you see we're not rebelling against
[43:24] god
[43:25] we're rebelling
[43:27] against lucifer
[43:29] and his kingdom
[43:30] aren't you glad this morning you have a
[43:34] reason to say i'm a rebel
[43:36] amen because you are not going to
[43:39] conform to the things of this earth and
[43:42] that's another sermon part six seven
[43:44] eight nine brother david you would
[43:45] understand that
[43:46] anyway
[43:47] look
[43:49] destroy all the jews throughout the
[43:51] whole kingdom of a hazardous even the
[43:53] people of mordecai in the first month
[43:55] that is the month of nisin in the 12th
[43:58] year of king hazaras they cast per that
[44:02] is the lot before haman from day to day
[44:05] and from month to month to the 12th
[44:08] month that is the month of adar
[44:10] haman said unto king hazarath there is a
[44:13] certain people
[44:14] scattered abroad and dispersed among the
[44:16] people in all the provinces of that
[44:19] kingdom
[44:20] and their laws are diverse
[44:22] from
[44:23] all people
[44:25] neither do they keep
[44:27] the king's laws
[44:29] therefore it is not for the king's
[44:32] prophet to suffer them
[44:34] if it please the king
[44:36] let it be written that they may be
[44:38] destroyed and i will pay ten thousand
[44:41] talents of silver to the hands of those
[44:43] that have charge of the business to
[44:45] bring it into the king's treasures
[44:50] and the king took his ring from his hand
[44:53] and gave it unto haman the son of
[44:56] hamadath
[44:57] the agtite the jews enemy and the king
[45:00] said unto haman the silver has given
[45:02] thee the people also to do with them as
[45:05] it seemeth good to thee
[45:08] heavenly father we just ask for your
[45:09] blessings today
[45:11] lord if you would just break open the
[45:13] word of life to us let it become so real
[45:16] to us father we walk out of here lord
[45:18] just shouting victory today not walk out
[45:21] of here saying that touched me or that
[45:23] was a good thought but lord let it move
[45:25] right down into the depths of the souls
[45:27] of your people that lord they can rise
[45:30] up and say i have victory oh in the day
[45:33] that i'm lit the day i was called the
[45:35] hour my circumstance i have victory lord
[45:39] that is our heart's desire lord bless
[45:42] your people bless the word today in the
[45:44] name of jesus christ amen and amen you
[45:47] may be seated amen
[45:50] god bless our visitors amen um look my
[45:53] brother and sister i hope today you can
[45:55] just kind of follow along a
[45:58] kind of a broad stretch i tried to break
[46:00] this down smaller and i found myself
[46:03] trying to as it were if i would put it
[46:06] in this example to explain the workings
[46:08] of the adam when i myself don't always
[46:11] understand what the working is amen so
[46:14] we'll just take this and i believe i'm
[46:16] preaching to real christians to bible
[46:18] readers bible believers and so as we'll
[46:21] look at this today you're going to have
[46:23] to just stretch out pull some of these
[46:25] things in and you know i find it
[46:26] relevant because you know while
[46:28] sometimes the preacher he doesn't have a
[46:31] clue what it is but god has already
[46:33] anointed many of you to read scripture
[46:35] read quotes study these things and it's
[46:38] there that the preacher because of his
[46:40] position is trying to fill in every
[46:42] little hole for you when you were there
[46:45] saying i just read that i just woke up
[46:47] to that i was just singing that this is
[46:49] real to me amen and so you know we know
[46:52] our god is an awesome god amen and he
[46:54] has a mighty work that he is performing
[46:56] in his people and it's in that work my
[46:59] brother and sister that that uh we find
[47:02] that we are all joined together oh how
[47:04] many times that we might just look i
[47:07] have friends in different parts of the
[47:09] world and maybe you just look into their
[47:11] world and i'm always amazed that uh we
[47:14] look into what friends are doing
[47:15] happening in the church you know in
[47:17] europe or somewhere else and find out
[47:19] wow this is stunning they're preaching
[47:22] on the same thoughts they're preaching
[47:23] on the same things there's no collusion
[47:25] here there is no memo that's been sent
[47:28] out in the month of june preach on this
[47:31] it's the holy ghost moving upon his
[47:33] people because you see my brother and
[47:36] sister this bride is not going to have a
[47:38] rapture for these over here and then
[47:40] rapture for those over there this bride
[47:42] will be ready for the rapture amen she's
[47:45] ready for the calling away she's she's
[47:47] not just piecemealed together but she is
[47:50] the complete revelation of jesus christ
[47:53] amen if we go to the second chapter of
[47:55] esther i i want to use this as a
[47:58] footnote and by god's grace we'll be
[47:59] able to tie this all back together but
[48:02] as king uh
[48:04] as and the king loved esther
[48:07] above all the women and she obtained
[48:09] grace
[48:10] and favor
[48:12] in his sight
[48:14] now look at this my brother and sister
[48:16] no other woman
[48:19] why woman represents what
[48:22] church
[48:24] no other one found favor
[48:28] like esther did
[48:31] found favor in his sight more than all
[48:33] the virgins so that he set the royal
[48:35] crown upon her head and made her queen
[48:39] instead of vashti and i i include that
[48:42] today because as it is in the title here
[48:44] we're seeing today
[48:46] to be found worthy or to find favor my
[48:49] brother and sister is so important we
[48:52] are not here just to be religious as it
[48:55] were to receive an attendance award of
[48:58] not missing a service in 50 years i just
[49:01] read a little article i'm not making fun
[49:02] of this i actually think it is very
[49:04] incredible and very commendable that a
[49:07] church back east i believe is in
[49:09] pennsylvania gave an award to a couple
[49:11] there uh they'd been married 50 years
[49:13] and had not missed a church service in
[49:16] 50 years
[49:18] they obviously didn't travel
[49:22] but you look at that and realize what
[49:24] what a commendation for for their
[49:26] devotion
[49:28] but my brother and sister 50 years
[49:29] without revelation uh 50 years without
[49:32] the holy ghost none of that would matter
[49:34] so we pray that these people actually
[49:36] had obtained that position of finding
[49:38] favor before god and not just an award
[49:41] because it was their life it was their
[49:42] social it was all that was encompassing
[49:45] to them and so we look at that my
[49:47] brother and sister and realize that we
[49:49] could live to be a hundred but if we do
[49:52] that without having god in our life in
[49:54] the control tower then we have we have
[49:57] not really accomplished anything great
[50:00] so as we'll look at this and see that
[50:02] the king loved esther above all the
[50:05] churches
[50:08] he loved the bride
[50:11] above all
[50:12] the other brides the other potential
[50:14] brides
[50:16] and she you see it doesn't say that her
[50:18] and 50 other girls
[50:20] found grace in favor it was she that
[50:22] found favor in his sight
[50:24] amen and i've preached on that and we're
[50:26] going to move on but i just want to
[50:28] reiterate this my brother and sister
[50:29] that's how she came boldly to the throne
[50:32] is she had caught a revelation that she
[50:35] had found favor
[50:37] see if we never come to the place that
[50:39] we have confidence to come before god to
[50:42] boldly approach the throne and ask him
[50:44] then we will spend our life begging god
[50:47] god's not looking for beggars he's
[50:49] looking for a wife that's got such
[50:51] complete confidence in him that she can
[50:54] say you know what my husband is the king
[50:56] of kings he is the lord of lords he's a
[50:59] ruler of all the creator of all and i
[51:02] have been given a decree to come boldly
[51:05] to the throne and to come boldly means
[51:07] you come with confidence
[51:10] now we'll lap into this by god's grace
[51:12] but remember the word says that if you
[51:17] have no condemnation
[51:21] then
[51:23] you have confidence
[51:25] in god yes sir
[51:27] i want to lay this little foundation
[51:29] just as a reminder
[51:30] god has never condemned
[51:39] people say i feel so condemned when i go
[51:41] to church
[51:44] something's wrong either you're
[51:45] misunderstanding it been taught wrong
[51:48] or maybe by god's grace today i can lay
[51:51] that foundation out for you you might
[51:52] understand but you see god never
[51:54] condemns god convicts that's right
[51:58] and conviction is what brings us to
[52:00] repentance
[52:01] and repentance is what brings us to
[52:03] spiritual growth
[52:06] see we can never skip over the
[52:07] repentance and expect oh i've got
[52:09] revelation
[52:11] not if you don't have repentance you
[52:13] don't have revelation
[52:14] you have an intellectual understanding
[52:17] but you don't have true revelation
[52:19] because true revelation means that there
[52:21] is nothing between you and god
[52:23] god can communicate or speak to you
[52:25] clearly
[52:26] amen
[52:28] so we look at this and realize that now
[52:30] out of esther the second chapter
[52:33] we see this great event laying this and
[52:35] here again let me be redundant that she
[52:38] obtained grace and favor in his sight
[52:41] more than all the virgins now we
[52:43] understand in life and in the word of
[52:46] god that at any one time multiple
[52:48] stories are taking place so it's not uh
[52:50] ever we read the book of esther and we
[52:53] can transplant esther right to the 21st
[52:55] century and overlay that and while you
[52:58] say well it doesn't fit perfect my
[53:00] brother and sister god is not here to
[53:03] come and satisfy your view
[53:07] god's here to reveal his word and reveal
[53:10] the life that was behind the word to
[53:13] make it real to you now we might use a
[53:16] word of concepts and say well the
[53:18] concept is now my brother and sister god
[53:20] does not deal in concepts in the
[53:22] definition that the world has today but
[53:24] the whole concept of the word of god is
[53:27] that it was the same from the very
[53:30] beginning of time and will be the same
[53:32] exact word amen god didn't say now it
[53:36] will be this until culture comes it will
[53:39] be this until you are woken well no
[53:41] maybe it will be till you're woken
[53:43] hallelujah it's when we wake up and
[53:45] realize who we are in jesus christ but
[53:48] not to this woke thing that's going on
[53:50] right now not to this that's all caught
[53:53] up in this and caught up god didn't say
[53:54] i'll be the same until we come to that
[53:56] day he said i will be the same from the
[53:59] beginning i am the alpha and i am the
[54:03] omega you can count on me
[54:06] you can count on me if i ever was a
[54:08] savior i'm a savior now if i was ever a
[54:11] provider i'm a provider now if i was
[54:14] ever a healer i'm a healer now now look
[54:16] my brother and sister the reason we must
[54:19] anchor that is because in the world
[54:21] today people are preaching that god is
[54:23] conscious of culture
[54:26] no i'm sorry whether you're talking
[54:27] about africa you're talking about europe
[54:30] you're talking about
[54:31] all of the different countries and
[54:33] cultures my brother and sister it's the
[54:35] same god
[54:36] amen he doesn't have a culture for this
[54:38] place and a culture for that place he's
[54:41] got a culture among his people that they
[54:43] hold the word up in reverence and the
[54:46] word becomes their anchor it becomes
[54:48] their guiding light it becomes
[54:50] everything to them it is no longer i am
[54:53] of this or i am of that we use these
[54:55] terms sometimes and i can't use it
[54:57] anymore
[54:58] because we did ancestry.com and found
[55:00] out i'm point like 003 german i used to
[55:03] blame it on the german in me
[55:06] but they're so little german and then it
[55:08] turns out they weren't even real germans
[55:09] they moved there from somewhere else
[55:14] so i can't come and say well it's
[55:16] because i did
[55:18] then i struggle to serve god i struggle
[55:21] to serve god because i have not made up
[55:23] my mind and my heart to give myself
[55:26] completely to him and the moment i give
[55:28] myself completely to him the culture of
[55:31] my irish temper and of my german
[55:34] stubbornness and all of this and all
[55:35] that it all fades away and i say i'm a
[55:38] new creature in christ jesus today
[55:41] all things have passed away and i no
[55:44] longer have an excuse i want to stand
[55:47] saint as much as we are in the flesh and
[55:49] as much as we are human i want to stand
[55:52] i am not of this world i'm not of an
[55:55] attitude i'm not of a spirit i'm of
[55:58] christ
[55:59] hallelujah
[56:01] just a temporary time on this earth then
[56:04] i get a walk through this and in that
[56:06] time i get to decide
[56:08] how committed i am
[56:10] how devoted i am
[56:13] what is my priority
[56:16] i get to decide that isn't it awesome
[56:18] some people are kind of scared well i
[56:20] wish god would just make the decision
[56:21] for me well i'm telling you i actually
[56:23] love free moral agency i'm in church
[56:26] today i'm excited i got up early this
[56:29] morning and i looked at the word of god
[56:31] and i was able to say lord let this live
[56:33] today let this be real today let this
[56:36] speak to somebody's heart today and i
[56:39] got to make that decision
[56:41] nobody wrong my phone this morning and
[56:44] said get out of bed go get in the word
[56:46] of god write these things down no
[56:49] something in my heart says i want to
[56:52] come and i want to bring something that
[56:54] would bless you
[56:56] and i tell you it's so much beyond the
[56:58] human element
[57:00] so much beyond the human element saints
[57:02] oh he's such a great preacher no he
[57:05] serves a great god
[57:07] and that great god said i'm going to use
[57:09] that manner that woman to do my work and
[57:12] it's no longer a one-man ministry this
[57:15] is a body ministry a bride coming in
[57:18] maturity to be able to say lord i want
[57:21] to please you i'm not pleasing the
[57:24] bishop i'm not pre uh pleasing the
[57:26] pastor or the board or the committee i'm
[57:29] not pre
[57:30] pleasing the group of people i'm
[57:32] pleasing god
[57:34] oh hallelujah
[57:36] now look at this my brother and sister
[57:38] any one time multiple stories taking
[57:40] place
[57:41] at just a simple example
[57:43] as this world is slipping off into the
[57:45] abyss
[57:47] let me just share with you over
[57:49] my just like always that's why i can't
[57:51] even tell jokes i'm just
[57:53] i always forget that one little key
[57:54] ingredient that makes a difference just
[57:58] over in england
[58:00] a school
[58:02] has now decided
[58:03] that girls cannot wear dresses to school
[58:07] because they're going to
[58:09] embrace the gender
[58:12] oh this is why i forgot
[58:15] something about the gender ed they're
[58:17] embracing it
[58:18] so everyone in the school now boys and
[58:21] girls has to wear trousers
[58:23] but you can wear shorts
[58:25] but they're getting rid their excuse was
[58:26] we're getting rid of the skirts because
[58:29] the girls were wearing above their knee
[58:32] but they can wear shorts that are above
[58:33] the knee
[58:35] it's not about the knee being exposed
[58:40] it's about that
[58:42] conniving slippery
[58:44] haman
[58:45] i mean the devil
[58:49] trying to come
[58:51] and set the stage
[58:53] where some family would be like well you
[58:54] know
[58:56] we want our daughter to dress right
[58:58] but the school says
[59:02] and then they introduce them into a
[59:03] culture
[59:04] that was not meant for a godly little
[59:07] girl
[59:09] and then the parents come along years
[59:10] later and say
[59:13] well we didn't have any idea
[59:17] that would cause that
[59:19] when we recognize the devil
[59:22] and his work
[59:24] then god brings and i'm way ahead of
[59:26] myself but god gives discernment to the
[59:28] body of christ the devil is exposed to a
[59:31] real christian
[59:33] amen when you realize that no matter
[59:35] what agenda they use they are going to
[59:38] one term and that is satan made a
[59:40] promise that he would get you away from
[59:43] the word of god from the principles of
[59:45] the word of god and so he just works on
[59:47] that and he works on that and he works
[59:48] on that
[59:49] amen we might come back and revisit that
[59:51] because it's a little out of line but
[59:53] you look at this well look at this the
[59:55] multiple story going on the world's
[59:57] slipping into the abyss but the bride of
[59:59] christ is putting on her royal garments
[1:00:03] amen esther did not come into the king
[1:00:06] dressed like a shag
[1:00:08] i'm sorry that's street language i
[1:00:10] shouldn't use it forgive
[1:00:12] me but when you see people in ripped
[1:00:16] jeans
[1:00:17] tank tops look like hobos
[1:00:21] going into the house of god
[1:00:23] to come before the king drafts like a
[1:00:26] hobo because maybe my king likes the
[1:00:29] latest fashions
[1:00:30] no i'm sorry kings don't like fashion
[1:00:33] kings like reverence they like uh you
[1:00:36] know respect they like honor and as the
[1:00:39] rules have been set and they're there
[1:00:41] just think about it in the natural this
[1:00:43] is how you go we wouldn't my goodness my
[1:00:45] brother and sister do you know even in
[1:00:47] this modern day if you went to the white
[1:00:49] house even as a war hero or some great
[1:00:52] uh
[1:00:53] philanthropist or something uh they're
[1:00:55] not going to let you in there looking
[1:00:56] like a hobo
[1:00:59] because you're disrespecting the office
[1:01:02] and so you look at this and see now in
[1:01:04] the world we're living how it is that
[1:01:06] they are so demeaning god in every
[1:01:09] fashion that he's become commoner
[1:01:12] not royalty saints he's become commoner
[1:01:17] but the bride of christ putting on her
[1:01:19] royal garments right she's clothed in
[1:01:20] the word of the hour
[1:01:23] she's not coming with some age-old
[1:01:25] religion and i'm not speaking against
[1:01:26] any church but my brother and sister
[1:01:28] when you see in the world today religion
[1:01:32] after religion church after church
[1:01:35] saying well you know what to reach the
[1:01:37] culture i mean reach the people we need
[1:01:39] to embrace the culture so they'll feel
[1:01:42] comfortable in our midst well my
[1:01:43] goodness here is a nice big hundred car
[1:01:46] train going to hell let's all get on it
[1:01:57] but here's what's interesting
[1:02:00] every woman
[1:02:02] had the same exact options
[1:02:05] esther did that's right
[1:02:07] see people say you guys think you're
[1:02:08] something special
[1:02:10] you guys think you're this you know
[1:02:12] those are all the signs of a cult
[1:02:14] well no i'm
[1:02:16] well okay
[1:02:18] saints i have something to break to you
[1:02:19] today i've been kind of
[1:02:22] nervous about putting this out
[1:02:26] but um paul haylett belongs to a colt
[1:02:30] now colt published a book
[1:02:33] and said
[1:02:34] you'll follow
[1:02:36] the rules that's right
[1:02:39] now if this would qualify me to be in a
[1:02:42] cult
[1:02:43] then i will stand up and proudly say i
[1:02:45] am in a cult
[1:02:47] but you see my brother and sister if we
[1:02:49] and i've shared this with you before if
[1:02:51] we got realistic to the modern church
[1:02:53] they would come and say we don't believe
[1:02:55] this and rip the page out and they could
[1:02:57] turn the bible into a pocket bible
[1:02:59] because there wouldn't be very many
[1:03:00] pages left in it and it would easily fit
[1:03:02] in their pocket
[1:03:04] and that is what's happening in the
[1:03:06] world today my brother and sister they
[1:03:07] say they testify of christ but really if
[1:03:10] you ask them they'll tell you we are of
[1:03:12] this church and we are of that church
[1:03:14] and we believe this and we believe that
[1:03:16] and you'll see i'm going to come back
[1:03:18] and hit this i hope i don't offend
[1:03:19] anybody but you'll see my brother and
[1:03:21] sister one by one every major religion
[1:03:25] on the face of the earth is embracing
[1:03:28] the spirit of laodicea
[1:03:30] and they are going against the word of
[1:03:32] god and they claim they're doing it for
[1:03:34] the people
[1:03:37] well what are they wanting to do with
[1:03:38] the people what are they wanting to do
[1:03:39] for the people where are they wanting to
[1:03:42] send the people i can tell you from an
[1:03:45] honest open heart and you know me i want
[1:03:48] to see you in the rapture i want to walk
[1:03:50] with you on those streets of gold i want
[1:03:52] to stand in the throne of almighty god
[1:03:55] and worship him and be able to look over
[1:03:57] and say god bless you brother sergey
[1:04:00] god bless you brother jason god bless
[1:04:02] you brother scott and be able to say
[1:04:04] that to every one of you we're not here
[1:04:06] to build a church we're not here to
[1:04:07] build some earthly kingdom we're not
[1:04:09] here to be in the fashion of religion
[1:04:15] brother brown said that religion was big
[1:04:17] business and if you don't think so
[1:04:19] you know
[1:04:20] stephen fertig
[1:04:22] 18 million dollar house
[1:04:26] every pastor hear me well church
[1:04:30] every pastor ought to have an 18 million
[1:04:31] dollar house
[1:04:34] really
[1:04:37] really i mean seriously
[1:04:40] as long as they're still missionaries
[1:04:43] in the jungles in the deserts the
[1:04:44] highways the byways
[1:04:46] an 18 million dollar house
[1:04:49] my goodness
[1:04:51] they ought to be charged with
[1:04:52] embezzlement from the kingdom of god
[1:04:55] amen
[1:04:58] so every woman every church has had the
[1:05:00] same options that esther did
[1:05:02] and some you know thought that the king
[1:05:04] would like the latest passions and those
[1:05:06] kind of thoughts going on we won't visit
[1:05:08] every one of those amen but i'm telling
[1:05:10] you in the day that we live in because
[1:05:12] the word of god promised it for no other
[1:05:14] reason alone but the word of god this
[1:05:16] bible promised that there would be a
[1:05:19] church there would be a people here a
[1:05:21] bride that says i want to be clothed in
[1:05:23] the word of god i want to be clothed in
[1:05:26] that i want the word wrapped around me
[1:05:27] and if the word comes and speaks to me
[1:05:30] not condemnation but conviction of the
[1:05:32] heart and i can look at that and say i'm
[1:05:34] not doing it correctly lord forgive me
[1:05:36] aren't you glad for that kind of spirit
[1:05:38] to be able just to have the lord move
[1:05:40] upon you and you can say lord forgive me
[1:05:43] i don't want to be contrary to your word
[1:05:45] i want to line up amen
[1:05:48] but you see my brother and sister while
[1:05:50] all of this is going on
[1:05:52] there is accuser
[1:05:54] that has access
[1:05:56] to the king
[1:05:59] oh we have types in the bible think of
[1:06:01] job
[1:06:03] the accuser
[1:06:05] mordecai
[1:06:06] has access to the king
[1:06:09] just
[1:06:10] like esther does
[1:06:12] the bride of christ a real christian the
[1:06:14] day we live in has been given the decree
[1:06:17] to come boldly to the throne of god but
[1:06:19] did you know that god left the door open
[1:06:22] for satan to come because he is the
[1:06:25] accuser of the brethren
[1:06:27] he's not standing outside a door in the
[1:06:29] dark making his accusation he has been
[1:06:32] given the opportunity to come right
[1:06:35] oh hang on
[1:06:37] right to the same throne room that you
[1:06:41] boldly come to god left the door open
[1:06:44] for the devil to come into that same
[1:06:45] throne room and make the accusation
[1:06:48] oh now you say but why would god do that
[1:06:50] well i'll tell you why my brother and
[1:06:52] sister in just a few minutes if i don't
[1:06:53] get sidetracked but you see this accuser
[1:06:57] has access to the king right we can take
[1:06:59] verse eight there and haman said unto
[1:07:02] king hauser there's a certain people
[1:07:04] scattered abroad and dispersed among all
[1:07:06] the people of laodicea
[1:07:10] can i have that liberty this morning
[1:07:12] spread all across the world in the age
[1:07:15] of laodicea
[1:07:17] all in the provinces of your kingdom
[1:07:21] what is this this is the devil coming
[1:07:23] telling there's some people and you know
[1:07:25] what he always mingles the truth
[1:07:29] well let me reverse that he always
[1:07:31] mingles
[1:07:33] some lie in the truth
[1:07:37] because look at this let me let me
[1:07:38] expound on this before we hurry on
[1:07:43] certain people scattered abroad
[1:07:44] dispersed among the people in all the
[1:07:46] provinces of thy kingdom their laws are
[1:07:48] diverse
[1:07:50] from the whole rest of this world
[1:07:54] this world is not my home
[1:07:57] i'm just passing through america my
[1:08:01] treasures are not
[1:08:03] in this world right here
[1:08:05] no years ago somebody kind of i won't go
[1:08:07] into the story but kind of made a little
[1:08:09] accusation with paul your benefit on
[1:08:10] being a pastor of a church
[1:08:12] it's about the money
[1:08:15] at that time i had an opportunity to
[1:08:17] have picked up another farm and and i
[1:08:19] looked at this and i'm thinking okay if
[1:08:21] i rent this other farm here big farm
[1:08:24] and because the guy rented at that time
[1:08:26] still renting it it would have been long
[1:08:28] term i wouldn't have known that at the
[1:08:30] time but
[1:08:32] and i remember i turned it down because
[1:08:33] i thought lord i can't pastor a church
[1:08:35] and do all of this god was teaching me
[1:08:37] that
[1:08:38] you know you can't serve two masters
[1:08:41] and it's hard sometimes even in the
[1:08:42] little world i live in right now out
[1:08:44] here as a farmer that is sometimes hard
[1:08:47] you've seen it this spring the weather
[1:08:48] has made it very difficult for me and
[1:08:50] i'm not happy about that saints i'm not
[1:08:52] like whoa praise god i don't have to
[1:08:54] preach
[1:08:56] i'm not happy about that but to have
[1:08:58] somebody say well it's about the money
[1:09:00] and i remember i told them i was a
[1:09:01] little frustrated i probably was a
[1:09:02] little forceful the wife says i do that
[1:09:04] once in a while
[1:09:06] i was like if it was about the money i'd
[1:09:08] go out here and i would farm more land
[1:09:11] because it doesn't talk back
[1:09:17] so you see we have to choose what world
[1:09:20] are we off
[1:09:23] what what what is it that we want to be
[1:09:25] identified as
[1:09:29] so we're the certain people but this
[1:09:31] world's not our home
[1:09:33] we're not of its culture
[1:09:35] my brother and sister i i look at things
[1:09:37] you know
[1:09:38] study things and look at what's going on
[1:09:40] around us and and i'm like you know um
[1:09:44] uh well let me just put it this way i've
[1:09:46] seen a bumper sticker once
[1:09:50] this says nobody puts a bumper sticker
[1:09:53] on a maserati
[1:09:56] yeah
[1:09:58] and it was a car that had about 40
[1:10:00] bumper stickers on the back of it
[1:10:03] it was like i don't know if you drive
[1:10:04] one forgive me but i think it was like
[1:10:06] some little fiat something sprite
[1:10:10] definitely wasn't a fiat pepsi or
[1:10:12] something it was a fiat sprite
[1:10:15] um
[1:10:17] so you see we're not of its culture it's
[1:10:19] like why what are what are people doing
[1:10:23] christians putting religious tattoos
[1:10:26] on their
[1:10:28] bodies the word of god says
[1:10:31] not to mark
[1:10:32] yourself
[1:10:35] but i'm doing this for the glory of god
[1:10:39] somebody's fooling you
[1:10:40] because that's contrary to the word and
[1:10:42] if it's contrary to the word then god
[1:10:44] won't bless it regardless of your
[1:10:45] intention
[1:10:47] amen
[1:10:48] amen we're not of its nature my brother
[1:10:50] and sister you go out here and there's
[1:10:52] people i know hey paul you know of
[1:10:55] course you would never do something like
[1:10:56] this but a bunch of us guys are going to
[1:10:58] go you know celebrate the end of the
[1:11:00] harvest
[1:11:02] well i'm celebrating the end of the
[1:11:03] harvest yes hallelujah it's good it's an
[1:11:06] end time and we're celebrating the
[1:11:09] harvest i think i'll go down to church
[1:11:11] with some sons and daughters of god and
[1:11:13] i'll lift my hands and celebrate this
[1:11:15] great harvest that god is performing
[1:11:18] i'm not going down to some nightclub and
[1:11:21] and drink free liquor and blah blah blah
[1:11:24] no that's not a celebration of this kind
[1:11:26] of people that haman didn't like
[1:11:29] amen now look at this my brother and
[1:11:31] sister first peter
[1:11:33] amen let's move forward here and catch
[1:11:35] first peter
[1:11:37] now first peter 2 and 8 a stone of
[1:11:39] stumbling in a rock of offense even to
[1:11:42] them which stumble at the word
[1:11:45] why are they stumbling at the word
[1:11:46] because there's something in them that
[1:11:48] doesn't want to obey the word
[1:11:52] not a man in a pulpit not a church with
[1:11:54] a name the word of god
[1:11:57] you're legalists i don't know if i'm
[1:11:59] legalist or not but i do know when the
[1:12:01] word says don't do it he means don't do
[1:12:05] it and when he says do this he means do
[1:12:08] it
[1:12:10] excuse me for getting excited i'm sorry
[1:12:12] i've had this all bottled up all week
[1:12:14] and now it's coming out
[1:12:16] hallelujah
[1:12:17] being disobedient wherein to also ouch
[1:12:20] this always hurts
[1:12:22] they were appointed
[1:12:24] amen
[1:12:25] but somebody ought to rejoice here in
[1:12:27] verse nine
[1:12:28] but ye meaning you and i here are a
[1:12:31] chosen generation a royal priesthood a
[1:12:34] holy nation oh this is the peculiar
[1:12:37] people that haman was talking about
[1:12:40] this is a peculiar people that don't
[1:12:43] follow the rules of this world
[1:12:46] these are people that have another that
[1:12:49] they're following
[1:12:51] that you should show forth the praises
[1:12:52] of him and called you out of darkness
[1:12:54] into his marvelous light now i don't
[1:12:57] mean trying to break these habits of
[1:12:59] getting too personal with you
[1:13:01] but who could lift a hand and say thank
[1:13:03] you lord for the marvelous life
[1:13:06] thank you lord that the light is shining
[1:13:08] down the word of god is opened up
[1:13:10] and i don't mind being you know i've
[1:13:12] told you this before and i'm not trying
[1:13:14] to point it to me but just to make the
[1:13:15] point
[1:13:16] i know how some of my farmer neighbor
[1:13:19] friends think
[1:13:21] so i just turned the i just turned i
[1:13:23] countered it on them

[1:14:23] little bit facetious but you see they
[1:14:26] think we're insane
[1:14:29] come on
[1:14:30] when has it ever been appealing my
[1:14:32] brother and sister to look at that but
[1:14:35] they're under an anointing that they go
[1:14:37] out in public and it's there that they
[1:14:39] dress and act in that fashion and they
[1:14:42] say we're normal
[1:14:44] i have to disagree politely
[1:14:47] and sometimes as i just shared with you
[1:14:49] some of my friends not so politely
[1:14:51] but you see my brother and sister it's
[1:14:53] there that when we recognize we're a
[1:14:55] chosen generation we are a royal
[1:14:57] priesthood this is your ancestry
[1:15:00] amen this is the religious as it were

[1:15:38] fact
[1:15:41] if he says it is it must be fact
[1:15:44] if he says that i'm not good enough to
[1:15:47] be a son of god or a daughter of god it
[1:15:49] must be fact
[1:15:51] if he says that i'll never make it it
[1:15:53] must be fact
[1:15:55] if he says i can't be healed it must be
[1:15:57] fact
[1:15:59] come on saints you see what the devil's
[1:16:00] doing
[1:16:01] amen to peculiar people why so we could
[1:16:04] show forth the praises of him now if we
[1:16:07] can't get the praises out then something
[1:16:10] is not working if we can't come forth
[1:16:12] with praises from our lips from our soul
[1:16:15] my brother and sister then satan's got
[1:16:17] something nipped in your life
[1:16:22] i'll give you an idea
[1:16:24] how the power of life is
[1:16:27] i don't know what to do about it either
[1:16:28] i got to talk to a friend that does this
[1:16:30] kind of stuff there's a tree in our
[1:16:32] backyard it's been there for i wouldn't
[1:16:33] know how long long time
[1:16:35] those who had been the house big tree
[1:16:38] do you know those tree roots go
[1:16:39] underneath our foundation
[1:16:41] go all the way across our crawl space
[1:16:45] and are now trying to come up in that
[1:16:46] little courtyard area that we haven't
[1:16:48] put a deck or patio in yet
[1:16:51] looking for life
[1:16:53] nothing's going to stop it
[1:16:55] and that route is just going along there
[1:16:57] and it's looking for life you know it
[1:16:59] didn't try and grow in the crawl space
[1:17:02] never put off one single sprout
[1:17:06] in the crawl space
[1:17:08] but when it went under the foundation on
[1:17:10] the other side of our house and came up
[1:17:13] said there's light here
[1:17:16] there's light here
[1:17:18] and in a dark age in a dark experience
[1:17:21] a lifetime of darkness
[1:17:24] it finally found light
[1:17:26] and it sprouted and it appeared and come
[1:17:28] up
[1:17:29] hallelujah
[1:17:30] aren't you glad
[1:17:31] some of us went through the crawl space
[1:17:33] for a long time it looked like we
[1:17:35] belonged there
[1:17:36] but god said you just keep going you
[1:17:39] just keep searching you just keep doing
[1:17:41] it and i'll lead you to the light i want
[1:17:43] to know why didn't it turn right why
[1:17:45] didn't it turn left why did it go the
[1:17:47] direction it went i'm talking about it
[1:17:48] went straight across the crawl space
[1:17:54] something in it said there's light over
[1:17:55] there
[1:17:56] there's life over there you wonder if
[1:17:58] we're not a chosen people or not my
[1:18:00] brother and sister
[1:18:02] otherwise we'd be just sorry i don't
[1:18:03] mean to do it in such a fashion so
[1:18:06] direct but otherwise we would just be
[1:18:07] another woman chasing drunk that's right
[1:18:11] but god said there's lie
[1:18:13] just keep going there's light
[1:18:16] hallelujah
[1:18:18] so the accuser has the access
[1:18:20] and what's he accusing you of
[1:18:26] one
[1:18:28] and some place in our life every one of
[1:18:30] us experiences you're not worthy
[1:18:32] come on can we be bold today has anybody
[1:18:34] ever experienced that i'm not worthy god
[1:18:37] wouldn't have chose me
[1:18:38] i i couldn't possibly be do you know
[1:18:40] what's happening saint
[1:18:42] did you know that when the devil comes
[1:18:45] and he makes these accusations it's not
[1:18:48] about
[1:18:49] how smart you are the devil don't
[1:18:51] condemn you
[1:18:53] iq is not high enough
[1:18:56] uh it's you're too tall
[1:18:58] or you're too short
[1:19:00] it's where you live
[1:19:02] i'm telling you
[1:19:04] i say our our brothers and sisters are
[1:19:06] not here this morning or sister sophie
[1:19:08] and sister grace are
[1:19:09] but i've had people tell me
[1:19:12] well you know those christians in africa
[1:19:14] don't have the revelation
[1:19:16] that we do
[1:19:19] and what rock did you crawl out from
[1:19:21] under
[1:19:23] every nation kindred and tongue
[1:19:25] especially the state of idaho
[1:19:28] no nonsense saints that's right god's
[1:19:30] people were created equal in his sight
[1:19:33] amen they are not a lesser they are not
[1:19:36] a greater they are sons and daughters of
[1:19:40] god
[1:19:42] and god made us equipped for certain
[1:19:45] callings for certain things and you
[1:19:47] might find one from here that's a little
[1:19:49] smarter person a little more determined
[1:19:51] over here a little of this or a little
[1:19:53] of that but he's given there you tom
[1:19:55] otherwise we'd say all people pray
[1:19:57] equally
[1:20:05] so what's the accuser
[1:20:07] he's telling you you're not worthy
[1:20:10] but did you know what he learned a long
[1:20:11] time ago
[1:20:14] when he comes to condemn you to accuse
[1:20:16] you
[1:20:17] he doesn't come
[1:20:20] with the satanic handbook
[1:20:24] it exists
[1:20:26] that's right
[1:20:27] he comes
[1:20:29] tell me if i'm not telling you the truth
[1:20:31] he comes
[1:20:32] with this right here
[1:20:35] and makes his accusations
[1:20:38] this is where he takes his foundation
[1:20:40] from
[1:20:41] you
[1:20:42] can't be you
[1:20:43] because you
[1:20:45] are here
[1:20:46] you don't this
[1:20:48] right here see you missed it
[1:20:50] you're not good enough
[1:20:52] you're not this you're not that oh we
[1:20:54] make mistakes come on let's let's be
[1:20:56] let's be real we make mistakes but satan
[1:20:59] comes and he says look i have the word
[1:21:02] of god and you made that mistake and i'm
[1:21:04] judging you from the word of god that
[1:21:06] you made a mistake
[1:21:08] oh isn't this clever of the devil amen
[1:21:11] but remember it was god that left the
[1:21:12] door open for that so if god didn't want
[1:21:15] you to have to face to face with the
[1:21:17] word now look my brother and sister the
[1:21:20] difference that is we say well i blame
[1:21:23] the devil he's just beating me down no
[1:21:25] my brother and sister i'm sorry the
[1:21:26] devil's not beating you down it's when
[1:21:28] you choose that's it come on when you
[1:21:31] choose
[1:21:32] condemnation over conviction it's when
[1:21:36] you come to the place that you say god
[1:21:38] doesn't love me or that preacher is hard
[1:21:41] on me i don't like his preaching because
[1:21:43] he's kind of loud this morning
[1:21:47] come on choose
[1:21:50] choose
[1:21:51] you know the old phrase
[1:21:53] i heard it a lot growing up if the few
[1:21:55] fits
[1:21:56] wear it
[1:21:58] if the shoe doesn't fit then say devil
[1:22:01] you're out of luck
[1:22:04] but you know there's been a time or two
[1:22:06] in my life you might seem this is a
[1:22:07] paradox
[1:22:08] that the devil trying to condemn me
[1:22:10] actually brought to light something in
[1:22:12] my own life
[1:22:14] so look at this now the devil thinks
[1:22:17] he's free thinks he's a free moral agent
[1:22:19] but god is putting the harness on the
[1:22:21] devil sometimes amen he allows those i
[1:22:24] know brothers that have went well i
[1:22:26] don't even really like to share it uh
[1:22:28] but i know brothers that their life
[1:22:31] would be just um my
[1:22:34] how do i say this politely
[1:22:37] utter wrecks will be a very simple
[1:22:40] utter wrecks have done things in their
[1:22:42] life they're ashamed that the world
[1:22:45] might find out
[1:22:52] and grew up in christian homes
[1:22:54] they're
[1:22:55] preachers children
[1:22:58] spent all the days of their life from
[1:23:00] first
[1:23:01] to 18
[1:23:03] going to church turn and go out a
[1:23:07] different avenue
[1:23:09] and as time went on you think oh my the
[1:23:11] devil's got control of them but you
[1:23:13] realize it's god that has the bit in the
[1:23:16] devil's mouth
[1:23:18] and god just lets the devil go here and
[1:23:20] lets the devil go there and let him
[1:23:23] wreak havoc in their life because god
[1:23:25] said i will bring them back amen they're
[1:23:29] mine and i will harness the devil to
[1:23:32] take them down a road that causes them
[1:23:35] to say i can't go any further and the
[1:23:38] devil's there take your life become a
[1:23:41] drunk in an alley do this and do that
[1:23:44] and in that moment of despair god raises
[1:23:47] something up inside of them and they say
[1:23:49] i remember a time before i gave my life
[1:23:52] to this before i let the devil lead me
[1:23:55] then i had a peace in my soul i remember
[1:23:58] a time at 16 years old that i love the
[1:24:00] lord and i'm telling you i could name
[1:24:02] their names right now and you could go
[1:24:04] verify it but it wouldn't be fair to
[1:24:06] them my brother and sister 41 years old
[1:24:09] sitting on a bar stool and some guy that
[1:24:12] he works with saying god's not even real
[1:24:15] these fools that believe there is and
[1:24:17] the guy stands up in the bar room and
[1:24:19] turns to him and says you're a liar i
[1:24:22] know god is real
[1:24:25] with a beer in his hand
[1:24:28] what was it god harnessed the devil
[1:24:31] brought it for that man to make a
[1:24:32] statement but there had to be a seed
[1:24:34] down inside there and that man put that
[1:24:37] beer down and walked out of there and
[1:24:39] then from that day on his friend said
[1:24:41] he's losing his mind he's losing his
[1:24:43] mind
[1:24:44] he he used to do this and he used to do
[1:24:46] this he used to do that and he'd do none
[1:24:48] of this now and now he's really quiet
[1:24:50] he's really morose he's he's just not
[1:24:53] what is going on
[1:24:56] until one day he couldn't do it
[1:24:58] any longer
[1:25:00] amen
[1:25:03] oh did i fail to mention that he was gay
[1:25:06] to add one more layer
[1:25:08] of the impossibility that people would
[1:25:10] bring
[1:25:16] the story is much longer
[1:25:18] but my sheep hear my voice
[1:25:22] and the master started calling and the
[1:25:24] sheep started responding
[1:25:27] you know it's a marvelous thing those
[1:25:28] people that are around livestock
[1:25:32] them dumbo goats them dumble sheep
[1:25:35] dumbo cows
[1:25:36] them dumbo horses
[1:25:38] them dumbo burrows
[1:25:42] dumbo pigs
[1:25:44] are more spiritual than a lot of people
[1:25:48] yeah
[1:25:50] i won't go there get sidetracked
[1:25:54] sister jerry had a boar one time
[1:25:57] you know
[1:25:59] oh let's skip it
[1:26:04] let's just skip it
[1:26:08] but satan's learned
[1:26:10] that he haman learned he can use the
[1:26:13] king's word
[1:26:14] against the king's people
[1:26:17] see so it is what is he doing
[1:26:20] satan's condemnation is to point out
[1:26:22] your shortfall to the words of the king
[1:26:25] you'll never you'll never live up to
[1:26:27] this you'll never rise up here you'll
[1:26:29] never do this
[1:26:31] amen but we see as
[1:26:34] well we see night and day saints
[1:26:36] come on saying see uh you ever do that
[1:26:38] do you ever wake up at 2 a.m
[1:26:41] i just had that happen here a few days
[1:26:43] ago wake up at 2 a.m in the morning and
[1:26:45] you're there and it's like why did i
[1:26:47] wake up
[1:26:49] i don't know why i woke up
[1:26:53] roll over in bed
[1:26:55] because i've learned this works
[1:26:57] you don't need to go to a doctor and get
[1:26:59] some drugs to go to sleep
[1:27:01] you need to roll over in bed put your
[1:27:03] face in the mattress
[1:27:05] and start praying
[1:27:07] and the devil will knock you out that's
[1:27:10] right
[1:27:10] and if he doesn't knock you out then
[1:27:12] you'll be able to start at one end of
[1:27:14] this valley to the other and from side
[1:27:16] to side from those pews to this pew to
[1:27:18] that until you went through it and
[1:27:19] you'll have this glorious opportunity to
[1:27:22] pray for everybody in the body of christ
[1:27:26] yeah you might get up the next day and
[1:27:27] you'll be tired and you'll yawn and
[1:27:29] you'll struggle through the whole day
[1:27:30] and you say oh that was terrible i slept
[1:27:32] bad but i prayed good
[1:27:36] thank you lord
[1:27:38] amen because the devil amen is going to
[1:27:41] accuse night and day
[1:27:44] amen he's ever unrelenting his brother
[1:27:46] david nash shared that right it's no
[1:27:47] longer a musket shooting the fiery dart
[1:27:50] it's a machine gun
[1:27:52] and he's pounding away
[1:27:54] amen we see his
[1:27:56] false accusations now i can't remember
[1:27:59] exactly how that deal
[1:28:00] is but you know fear
[1:28:03] is false
[1:28:05] however that goes
[1:28:07] okay false evidence appearing real i
[1:28:08] couldn't get the evidence part
[1:28:10] false evidence appearing real
[1:28:13] do you realize saints oh i hope i'm not
[1:28:15] keeping you too long when the devil
[1:28:17] starts to tell you that you can't and
[1:28:19] you won't and you're unworthy and all of
[1:28:21] this that is false evidence
[1:28:24] amen and i i'll kind of parry this down
[1:28:27] a little bit i can prove to you it's
[1:28:29] false evidence because before all these
[1:28:32] things come out before haman the devil
[1:28:35] got brave enough to make his accusations
[1:28:38] public god had already brought down and
[1:28:41] the king had already looked at esther
[1:28:43] and found her worthy
[1:28:46] oh it wasn't after these things come
[1:28:48] you're a jew
[1:28:51] my my queen my wife is a jew
[1:28:55] no sir
[1:28:56] the king had already deemed her worthy
[1:28:59] of his love worthy of the title worthy
[1:29:02] of the position worthy of the benefits
[1:29:05] that came with that
[1:29:07] before the devil could ever stand up and
[1:29:09] say hey
[1:29:11] she's connected to these people that are
[1:29:14] the rebels in your kingdom
[1:29:17] never had a chance amen god cut the time
[1:29:20] short on haman
[1:29:22] hallelujah
[1:29:23] amen
[1:29:24] but look at this so this false evidence
[1:29:26] appearing real
[1:29:28] now you know i know you know this but
[1:29:29] just to bring this in your mind in a way
[1:29:32] do you realize satan knows that every
[1:29:34] one of his converts is going to hell
[1:29:38] satan doesn't have a paradise
[1:29:44] satan's got nothing
[1:29:48] in colorado a few years ago
[1:29:52] very interesting story
[1:29:55] by god's grace and mercy sister jerry
[1:29:57] and i own a couple little pieces of dirt
[1:29:59] and so things in real estate kind of
[1:30:01] interest me
[1:30:03] and this case come up made it all the
[1:30:04] way to the colorado supreme court
[1:30:08] so here
[1:30:10] is a big house
[1:30:11] sitting on a lot
[1:30:13] and here is a big house sitting a lot
[1:30:16] but this lot
[1:30:18] is steep
[1:30:20] and the man wanted to build a shop in
[1:30:22] the back of this lot
[1:30:23] so he approaches his neighbor
[1:30:26] and he says my property's too steep
[1:30:30] if i built a shop up here
[1:30:34] could i drive up the edge of your
[1:30:36] property to get to my shop
[1:30:40] fred's my neighbor we barbecue together
[1:30:43] our kids go to school together
[1:30:46] we
[1:30:46] attend the same church
[1:30:49] we believe god is real
[1:30:51] i hope you follow me
[1:30:53] because the devil believes god is real
[1:30:56] you better know
[1:30:57] when he got slapped right out of heaven
[1:30:59] to the earth he knew god was real
[1:31:03] you know how time just goes by
[1:31:07] you know how the devil put that one
[1:31:09] little thing i'm not even going to
[1:31:11] presume to dig in your lives deep enough
[1:31:12] to tell you what it is
[1:31:14] although i believe god would reveal
[1:31:18] what it is
[1:31:20] and you've let the devil
[1:31:22] trespass
[1:31:24] in your life
[1:31:27] for how many years
[1:31:28] go ahead answer that to yourself
[1:31:30] how many years has the devil been a
[1:31:32] trespasser
[1:31:37] finally one day this man says hey my
[1:31:39] son's getting married i think i'm going
[1:31:40] to build a house on this lot tells a
[1:31:42] neighbor you won't be able to drive up
[1:31:44] there any longer
[1:31:45] we're going to build a house there
[1:31:48] and the neighbor said no you're not
[1:31:51] and he said what do you mean
[1:31:55] you're not building a house on that
[1:31:56] property
[1:31:58] and he said how are you going to stop me
[1:32:00] i'll show you
[1:32:02] how i'm going to stop you
[1:32:04] this neighbor here took that neighbor to
[1:32:06] court
[1:32:07] and because for seven years
[1:32:11] he had had complete access the man was
[1:32:13] clever he didn't drive up the edge of
[1:32:16] the property
[1:32:17] over time he moved the driveway
[1:32:21] into the middle
[1:32:23] of the property
[1:32:25] and in court
[1:32:27] someone helped me i can't remember what
[1:32:28] that term is
[1:32:31] huh
[1:32:34] well yeah they have yeah you're right
[1:32:36] we'll just use squadron's rights because
[1:32:37] i can't think of
[1:32:39] anyway
[1:32:42] in court
[1:32:43] the judge says now how long has this man
[1:32:45] been driving on this
[1:32:47] over seven years
[1:32:50] he
[1:32:52] catches spiritual side things
[1:32:55] he has
[1:32:56] rights
[1:32:59] now the devil comes
[1:33:00] and accuses you
[1:33:04] he's not going to come and say excuse me
[1:33:08] you push back and say no no no you have
[1:33:10] no right to my life no no
[1:33:12] i've been trespassing in your life
[1:33:15] for more than seven years
[1:33:17] i have rights
[1:33:19] that's why saints the scripture says
[1:33:21] when one would reject the devil and
[1:33:23] clean up the house if you don't fill it
[1:33:26] up
[1:33:27] he'll not only come and look in the
[1:33:29] window he'll go get seven more and move
[1:33:33] in and you'll be in worse shape than you
[1:33:35] was in the beginning so my brother and
[1:33:37] sister i want to make this point to you
[1:33:38] when the devil's coming to condemn you
[1:33:41] you have to put up the no tressing
[1:33:43] passing sign right then
[1:33:46] no give him time no i know i'll overcome
[1:33:49] this no i'm i'm working on it though
[1:33:51] pastor i'm working on it no drive the
[1:33:54] post in the middle of the driveway that
[1:33:56] the devil's using and put the no
[1:33:58] trespassing sign on it and say you're
[1:34:00] not welcome here because you realize
[1:34:03] saints the longer he trespasses
[1:34:05] the harder it will be
[1:34:07] to get rid of him
[1:34:10] anyway the courts realized there was a
[1:34:13] certain portion
[1:34:14] of deceit in the neighbors
[1:34:17] deal so the court did not award him
[1:34:21] get this
[1:34:22] please take this in your spiritual cap
[1:34:25] the court did not award him because this
[1:34:27] driveway was at the halfway mark of the
[1:34:28] property
[1:34:29] the court says there's a certain amount
[1:34:31] of deceit here
[1:34:34] so we'll only award him one-third of the
[1:34:36] property
[1:34:40] yeah
[1:34:42] you know what one-third of the property
[1:34:43] is
[1:34:47] one third of the property
[1:34:50] is that people will have a form
[1:34:53] of godliness
[1:34:56] they'll have a form
[1:34:59] my brother and sister
[1:35:03] just a form
[1:35:06] i was not called to just have form
[1:35:08] i was called to have liberty in jesus
[1:35:10] christ
[1:35:12] i was called to be able to walk as it
[1:35:14] were the term a freeborn son or daughter
[1:35:16] of god
[1:35:18] amen so satan knows
[1:35:22] satan knows
[1:35:24] amen
[1:35:25] that all his converts will be judged by
[1:35:27] the word of god
[1:35:29] so he knows that you're going to so he
[1:35:31] puts out a convincing argument that
[1:35:33] you'll decide you actually cannot live
[1:35:35] up to this my brother and sister i'm
[1:35:37] speaking strongly i'm sorry to our
[1:35:38] visitor this morning i'm speaking
[1:35:40] strongly but my brother and sister when
[1:35:42] you can go to church live any equine to
[1:35:44] life call yourself a christian you don't
[1:35:47] have god you have a form of amen
[1:35:50] amen and the devil know let them be just
[1:35:53] as religious as they can be but they
[1:35:56] won't read this serious enough to change
[1:35:59] their life and they'll look and they'll
[1:36:01] go to church and the preacher says man i
[1:36:03] feel condemned by the word and i'm
[1:36:05] uncomfortable being condemned by the
[1:36:07] word so i'm just going to water it down
[1:36:09] so it doesn't even condemn me the
[1:36:11] preacher
[1:36:13] but i'll tell you first and foremost not
[1:36:14] to put preachers in some elevated place
[1:36:16] but the word of god and the way god
[1:36:18] works it ought to move the preacher
[1:36:21] because if it won't move the preacher
[1:36:23] saints it won't move you
[1:36:25] if it won't cause the preacher to repent
[1:36:28] and live godly it won't cause you to
[1:36:31] repent and live godly and that's why god
[1:36:33] said i want my pulpit to be clean i want
[1:36:36] the people to look up and say you know
[1:36:38] what i'm going to stand on the pure word
[1:36:41] of god and preacher we're going to hold
[1:36:43] you accountable to stand on the pure
[1:36:45] word of god
[1:36:46] but we start watering it down because
[1:36:48] the preacher doesn't want to feel
[1:36:50] condemned either
[1:36:56] paul you don't have a right to preach
[1:36:57] like that no i do
[1:36:59] because i've walked down that road
[1:37:02] and i had to decide as i was preaching
[1:37:04] to you you wouldn't even have a clue how
[1:37:06] many times i'm preaching to you in a
[1:37:08] voice say
[1:37:09] listen
[1:37:11] listen paul
[1:37:13] and when i listened
[1:37:16] i wouldn't even tell you the times that
[1:37:18] it's almost just stop and walk away
[1:37:20] because it's like oh god
[1:37:22] i'm trying to get these people to live
[1:37:24] up to a standard
[1:37:25] and you just
[1:37:27] condemned me
[1:37:29] no no
[1:37:31] convicted
[1:37:33] the accuser says you're condemned
[1:37:37] but my god says
[1:37:39] i signed your pardon
[1:37:42] you may be condemned but i signed your
[1:37:43] pardon so what's the key that's left i
[1:37:46] have to reach out and take the pardon
[1:37:48] you have to reach out and take that and
[1:37:49] say you know what satan you're an
[1:37:51] accuser but you don't have the evidence
[1:37:53] convict me because my bible says that a
[1:37:56] son or daughter of god filled with the
[1:37:58] holy ghost cannot commit sin so
[1:38:00] therefore you have an empty lie of your
[1:38:03] condemnation and i'm going to stand on
[1:38:05] the word that i can't even commit sin
[1:38:08] because i will be quick as the holy
[1:38:10] spirit moves to put it back under the
[1:38:12] blood
[1:38:12] oh aren't you glad
[1:38:14] hallelujah you imagine if we were
[1:38:16] dragging all our baggage
[1:38:18] you imagine we'd need a church twice as
[1:38:20] big for the amount of people here today
[1:38:22] if we had
[1:38:22] excuse me
[1:38:24] i need this row
[1:38:25] for my baggage
[1:38:28] oh
[1:38:29] man we would have one of the biggest
[1:38:31] churches in nampa just for our little
[1:38:32] group because all of our baggage
[1:38:36] can i go on a little bit further
[1:38:38] amen now look here
[1:38:42] i love this
[1:38:44] oh my see who he's addressing
[1:38:46] not a bunch of babies
[1:38:50] to people that set in heavenly places
[1:38:52] and been blessed
[1:38:54] you see people have a hard time
[1:38:56] understanding that my brother and sister
[1:38:57] i've dealt with a lot of people and
[1:38:59] they're like i just don't see how see
[1:39:00] how see it like you see it
[1:39:03] have you ever been here
[1:39:04] no
[1:39:11] you know when the screen on your
[1:39:13] computer just goes through your picture
[1:39:14] album
[1:39:16] puts it up there
[1:39:22] i could talk about chile
[1:39:25] i could talk about different places
[1:39:27] south africa
[1:39:29] i could talk about all this kind of
[1:39:31] stuff just like you can talk about your
[1:39:33] places
[1:39:35] but you can never make it real enough
[1:39:39] to meet the person who's actually
[1:39:42] been there
[1:39:45] heavenly places some people are like
[1:39:47] well we had a really good service here a
[1:39:48] few weeks ago and brother andrew is
[1:39:50] coming next week and
[1:39:52] i expect it to be good um
[1:39:54] no they won't understand
[1:39:57] what it is to live
[1:39:59] in heavenly places but come on saints
[1:40:01] let's rise up to heavenly places don't
[1:40:04] listen don't question don't criticize
[1:40:06] don't look down on that don't say well

[1:40:15] places and ben bless now he said you

[1:40:21] all about oh i like that don't you i
[1:40:23] want to put your feet up in the heavens
[1:40:26] a little while instead of being so
[1:40:28] earthbound

[1:40:31] to give you a little a little boost a
[1:40:34] little revival a little stimulation amen
[1:40:37] i like this stimulation kind of builds
[1:40:39] you up especially when you know where
[1:40:41] you can say it's thus saith the lord
[1:40:45] now look some people get all nervous
[1:40:46] about these things like let's saith the
[1:40:48] lord but i'll tell you what this bible
[1:40:49] means to me when i read that i am a
[1:40:52] chosen generation amen i take that as
[1:40:55] thus saith the lord
[1:40:57] this is not something god's going to
[1:40:59] come back and say no i decided not
[1:41:01] enough people or too many people signed
[1:41:03] up i'm done with that no sir this is us

[1:41:08] it'll happen amen oh hallelujah

[1:41:14] can say it's lust saith the lord now i
[1:41:16] want to speak to you said you that sits
[1:41:18] in heavenly places in christ jesus been
[1:41:20] blessed together with all spiritual
[1:41:22] blessings
[1:41:26] amen i don't know how much reading you
[1:41:28] do saints and i'm not saying this or
[1:41:29] criticized but i'm telling you it's a
[1:41:30] sign of the times
[1:41:33] i read every article i can find that
[1:41:35] talks about conditions of churches in
[1:41:36] this day
[1:41:38] you'd be surprised how much reading that
[1:41:40] is
[1:41:42] do you realize what they're saying
[1:41:46] common theme
[1:41:49] creeping into the religious world
[1:41:52] the bible
[1:41:54] is not meaning
[1:41:57] in
[1:41:58] um
[1:42:00] oh my the word just slipped off me
[1:42:02] bible's not literal
[1:42:05] it's a
[1:42:06] theoretical teaching
[1:42:10] it's coming out
[1:42:11] do you know that one of the parts of the
[1:42:13] southern baptist conference that broke
[1:42:15] away or just gave up is what they did
[1:42:17] they just literally gave up and now they
[1:42:19] kind of tore down anything that
[1:42:20] resembled any form of holiness and just
[1:42:22] said wow whatever
[1:42:25] you know you know what it's crept in
[1:42:30] when one well-known preacher
[1:42:34] said now
[1:42:35] look
[1:42:36] god created us all equal
[1:42:39] and this certain lady i'm not going to
[1:42:41] name her name
[1:42:43] she is anointed of god to preach
[1:42:47] and they brought her into the church
[1:42:50] oh she's anointed all right
[1:42:52] fiery
[1:42:54] got a mind that would make mine look
[1:42:55] like it mine's a cheap rubbermaid
[1:42:57] garbage can
[1:43:00] but they forgot what the word said
[1:43:02] they didn't care any longer
[1:43:05] my i tell you what
[1:43:09] we're not against our sisters in fact we
[1:43:11] ought to be treating them like queens
[1:43:12] which means paul needs to treat his
[1:43:13] better
[1:43:16] they're not to be stepped on they're not
[1:43:17] a doormat they're not second class
[1:43:21] but the word said
[1:43:23] right the words
[1:43:26] it's not that we are demeaning or
[1:43:27] looking down but the word said
[1:43:30] and you see little things like that
[1:43:32] starting to creep in and they say it
[1:43:33] doesn't matter she's more gifted than
[1:43:35] all of us men put together
[1:43:39] says the bible
[1:43:40] if they're really gifted
[1:43:42] ignore this
[1:43:46] what is the devil doing
[1:43:48] his anointing
[1:43:51] and then
[1:43:52] when it comes to judgment
[1:43:54] the devil's not going to say hey she did
[1:43:56] all this great stuff that's what they'll
[1:43:58] be saying
[1:43:59] they'll stand before god did we not
[1:44:01] we cast out demons and we did mighty
[1:44:04] works in thy name the devil's going to
[1:44:06] stand there in the judgment and say hey
[1:44:09] you broke this
[1:44:12] and this is what you're going to get
[1:44:14] judged with
[1:44:15] and people are going to say no no we
[1:44:16] follow that
[1:44:18] and he's going to say no
[1:44:20] but remember
[1:44:22] the devil did you guys ever do this i
[1:44:24] remember doing a little bit as kids
[1:44:26] you know where you get the light just
[1:44:28] right and you can we used to have a
[1:44:30] little it's almost like a comic book i

[1:44:39] yeah
[1:44:40] secondhand light

[1:44:46] but it's not

[1:45:54] foundation of the world amen and long
[1:45:59] before haman got his decree to the king

[1:46:06] bride worthy to be loved and adored and
[1:46:09] to give his name to her oh the devil's
[1:46:12] making his accusation but i want you to
[1:46:15] remember god chose you gave a seal of
[1:46:18] approval amen to you before the
[1:46:21] foundation of the world he rolled up
[1:46:24] seven seals and he sealed them with the
[1:46:26] king signet and said inside here you
[1:46:30] will find redemption not in grace
[1:46:33] tabernacle not in the church down the
[1:46:35] street or the church down the street but
[1:46:37] in him
[1:46:38] oh hallelujah that's where the real seal
[1:46:41] was placed on it my brother and sister
[1:46:43] is when he placed a seal upon his own
[1:46:47] word and said i decree and signify and
[1:46:51] seal that these are my words
[1:46:55] oh hallelujah i could get off in a

[1:47:04] what the thunders are god's voice to you
[1:47:07] amen it's not a man's voice it's not
[1:47:10] this church's voice it's god's voice to
[1:47:13] you and he sealed as it were his voice
[1:47:16] with his own seal and said those are my
[1:47:19] true words

[1:47:23] and you will find life
[1:47:25] hallelujah

[1:47:38] sometimes a wife
[1:47:40] she's like hey try this

[1:47:46] breaks there's stress everywhere oh i
[1:47:48] don't want to go into that i don't want
[1:47:50] to go into that
[1:47:53] but sometimes the old outward man just
[1:47:54] looks like he's been beat up
[1:47:58] but the inner man

[1:49:19] praying and god opened the door he's

[1:49:23] anything
[1:49:25] i'm telling you i've prayed and god's
[1:49:27] opened so many doors for me that had
[1:49:29] nothing to do with my spiritual position
[1:49:32] had all to do with natural things
[1:49:35] is that a sign god loves me
[1:49:38] no sign at all
[1:49:39] but i tell you people have this idea
[1:49:42] well god just loves me because he did
[1:49:44] this

[1:49:47] morning to a beautiful sunrise that's

[1:50:18] to be so intimate to you i'm going to
[1:50:20] take it beyond you going to church and
[1:50:22] you put a name on the page and that you
[1:50:24] read your bible and that you pray i'm
[1:50:26] going to take it as it were into that
[1:50:28] other room and i'm going to become so
[1:50:30] real to you that when they come and say
[1:50:32] oh god's not real you'd be able to say
[1:50:34] no that's not right they say god's not a
[1:50:36] healer you can say no you don't know him
[1:50:38] then and they come and say well it's
[1:50:40] this and it's that and you say no and
[1:50:41] they say well how would you know because
[1:50:43] i've been in the bedroom with him
[1:50:47] i have an intimate relationship with
[1:50:49] jesus christ i have that personal side
[1:50:53] it's not a church relationship it's not
[1:50:55] of this relationship it's my
[1:50:57] relationship and he has come and become
[1:51:00] so real to me
[1:51:03] amen so please understand i hope that's
[1:51:05] not offensive to anyone the way i
[1:51:06] brought them out but people want to be
[1:51:08] wooed

[1:51:13] you'll buy me flowers and chocolates
[1:51:16] and give me the nicer things of life

[1:51:32] before the foundation of the world now
[1:51:33] watch we should be holy
[1:51:36] not our own holiness

[1:52:06] now if a hippie can have a conviction to
[1:52:08] look like that
[1:52:10] how much more sons and daughters of god
[1:52:13] could have some convictions amen
[1:52:16] unfortunately her husband her
[1:52:19] significant other had here almost as
[1:52:20] beautiful as hers but that's
[1:52:22] irregardless amen
[1:52:24] now watch we should be holy not our own
[1:52:26] holiness well you say do you believe in
[1:52:28] holiness brother branham sure
[1:52:30] not mine
[1:52:31] his
[1:52:33] my holiness nothing he is perfect
[1:52:35] oh now let me hurry along here bye
[1:52:38] uh so
[1:52:39] i i'm not going to preach this quote
[1:52:41] here to you
[1:52:43] this was from last week
[1:52:45] you can go home you can read it
[1:52:48] but see he's given
[1:52:50] this beautiful compliment
[1:52:53] on how that
[1:52:55] these believers are winning the battle
[1:52:58] through the name and faith of jesus
[1:52:59] christ right in the camp of the leaders
[1:53:02] of darkness
[1:53:03] now you look out here saints
[1:53:05] and to anyone that think i was
[1:53:08] throwing stones down on any other church
[1:53:10] i'm not
[1:53:11] but you see the direction that's going
[1:53:14] there's a church that's not three
[1:53:16] quarters of a mile from here
[1:53:19] rad but ran an ad
[1:53:22] about
[1:53:24] suggestions to make us more relevant in
[1:53:28] the community
[1:53:33] going
[1:53:36] to all the nations
[1:53:40] and do what
[1:53:43] preach the gospel
[1:53:46] there's our relevance
[1:53:49] there's our relevance
[1:53:52] now i think it's commendable that they
[1:53:53] have the resources to provide free
[1:53:55] daycare
[1:53:57] and they have
[1:53:58] the resources to provide food bank and
[1:54:01] and uh cook meals and do these things i
[1:54:04] think that's commendable
[1:54:06] but what was our commission
[1:54:08] our commission was to go and preach the
[1:54:10] gospel
[1:54:12] you want to be life-changing share the
[1:54:14] gospel
[1:54:15] amen
[1:54:17] so here it is
[1:54:18] so a tremendous commendation mighty men
[1:54:21] of david invaded the camp of the enemy
[1:54:23] bring david thirst quenching water so
[1:54:25] these giants of faith invaded the realm
[1:54:26] of satan's earthly storm that's all
[1:54:28] saints
[1:54:29] we have invaded the stronghold of
[1:54:32] satan's earthly
[1:54:34] amen
[1:54:35] so
[1:54:36] here i just want to make reference we'll
[1:54:38] move on real quick here
[1:54:40] uh this right here is when they brought
[1:54:42] a woman before jesus that had been
[1:54:43] caught in the very act now it doesn't
[1:54:45] get any more blunt
[1:54:47] come on saints
[1:54:48] i'm not trying to be crafts i'm not
[1:54:50] trying to be crude but i'm telling you
[1:54:52] when they said caught in the very act
[1:54:53] there wasn't a rumor that something
[1:54:55] happened in that house over there
[1:54:57] this is a fact it was right there
[1:54:59] red-handed right before them they had
[1:55:01] the evidence no shadow of a doubt
[1:55:05] and so they bring it because their real
[1:55:07] motive now for doing this otherwise
[1:55:09] they'd just drug her out
[1:55:11] and of course you notice they don't say
[1:55:12] anything about the man
[1:55:14] they were going to let the man go
[1:55:18] the woman
[1:55:20] now got put on the hook
[1:55:22] and cast out his bait
[1:55:24] to find something against jesus
[1:55:32] and so they come
[1:55:33] and they ask him he lifted himself up
[1:55:35] and said to them
[1:55:37] real simple
[1:55:39] their point was
[1:55:40] here she is
[1:55:41] here she is we caught her in the very
[1:55:43] act and i mean literally i got my
[1:55:44] polaroid i'm sorry i'm being this blind
[1:55:46] i got my polo right here's the evidence
[1:55:49] jesus doesn't look at her and go
[1:55:51] oh you wretched woman
[1:55:54] why
[1:55:56] because there was some seed
[1:55:58] that was chosen before foundation of the
[1:56:00] world somehow we think the bible just
[1:56:02] means it's for our day no my brother and
[1:56:04] sister all through the ages all through
[1:56:06] the ages there was a seed that had been
[1:56:08] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:56:11] world they could not fail they could not
[1:56:13] fall they could not be abandoned they
[1:56:15] could not
[1:56:16] oh
[1:56:17] and so what's jesus do
[1:56:20] he says unto them
[1:56:22] hey
[1:56:23] how about you guys that are without sin
[1:56:25] i mean after all your religious leaders
[1:56:27] you're the preacher
[1:56:29] the bishop
[1:56:30] head deacons you're this you're that
[1:56:32] presbyters whatever you want to call it
[1:56:35] jesus knew how to do it he just says hey
[1:56:38] he is without sin
[1:56:40] then he cast the first stone right now
[1:56:42] reason i included this is this what
[1:56:44] satan's done he's got ample evidence
[1:56:46] saints
[1:56:47] in satan's book of life
[1:56:49] he's got ample evidence to lay this out
[1:56:52] see what you did
[1:56:54] remember this remember that
[1:56:55] unfortunately while we throw it under
[1:56:57] the blood it goes in the sea of god's
[1:56:59] forgetfulness god doesn't even remember
[1:57:01] it uh our minds just
[1:57:04] grind crying
[1:57:06] right when i was 18 i did this and when
[1:57:08] i would say this and i did this
[1:57:12] right
[1:57:13] and the devil's got his own version the
[1:57:15] devil's book of life is what i would
[1:57:17] call it
[1:57:18] here it's recorded you did this
[1:57:21] but you see if you take that as the
[1:57:23] evidence right there then
[1:57:24] we're guilty
[1:57:26] see haman said there's these people that
[1:57:28] won't even follow your laws
[1:57:30] come on in this spiritual type are you
[1:57:32] with me today
[1:57:33] he was talking about us we can't even
[1:57:35] follow the law
[1:57:38] but by god's grace there was a decree
[1:57:40] that said i'll put forth a decree you
[1:57:43] defend yourself i'm not going to defend
[1:57:45] myself i'm going to let the word defend
[1:57:47] me
[1:57:48] amen so he stoops down and he starts
[1:57:50] writing on the ground and i'm telling
[1:57:51] you saints i've always wondered what did
[1:57:53] he write there
[1:57:54] is your curiosity ever took you there
[1:57:56] what did it what did he write there i
[1:57:58] mean could he possibly i don't know i'm
[1:58:00] just surmising okay don't take this
[1:58:01] literal but you know those men standing
[1:58:04] there in positions and
[1:58:05] maybe it was a name
[1:58:10] bethany
[1:58:13] and this man right here goes
[1:58:15] oh
[1:58:17] bethany
[1:58:20] how did he know i was having an affair
[1:58:22] with my secretary
[1:58:25] and another name
[1:58:27] amy
[1:58:29] and another one
[1:58:34] and one by one
[1:58:36] you notice what the scripture says
[1:58:38] from the
[1:58:39] oldest
[1:58:42] those in positions of authority elders
[1:58:45] example
[1:58:47] starts just working his way down through
[1:58:49] it i really would honestly like to know
[1:58:51] exactly what was wrong
[1:58:53] but i'll tell you what i do know it was
[1:58:55] personal
[1:58:56] god is not a god
[1:58:58] of the of the
[1:59:00] vague god is not a god of the
[1:59:04] presume
[1:59:06] god
[1:59:07] is a certain god
[1:59:09] they heard it being convicted by their
[1:59:10] own conscience right
[1:59:12] you notice
[1:59:14] convicted
[1:59:15] not condemned
[1:59:17] they
[1:59:19] oh i hope you catch the saints they were
[1:59:21] given the opportunity right then to
[1:59:25] repent
[1:59:27] condemnation drives away but conviction
[1:59:30] gives opportunity for repentance and
[1:59:34] jesus being jesus says i'm going to give
[1:59:36] you the opportunity they could have
[1:59:39] fallen oh my brother and sister i hope
[1:59:41] this is real right there in that moment
[1:59:43] they're gonna fall out on their knees
[1:59:44] and said i'll forgive me
[1:59:48] but instead
[1:59:49] instead they're like i'm gonna lose my
[1:59:51] position in the church i'm gonna lose my
[1:59:54] wife and my children's respect and i'm
[1:59:56] gonna
[1:59:58] i'm just gonna walk away
[2:00:00] i'm gonna act like this never happened
[2:00:03] i'm gonna act like god never moved
[2:00:05] through our church
[2:00:06] i'm gonna act like god never met me in
[2:00:08] the car on a lonely highway i'm gonna
[2:00:10] act like god never did these things
[2:00:13] but you see
[2:00:15] i just it struck my heart
[2:00:18] being
[2:00:18] convicted amen
[2:00:21] the door is now open
[2:00:23] for repentance
[2:00:27] jesus left alone and the woman standing
[2:00:29] in the midst and when jesus lifted up
[2:00:32] himself and saw none but the woman he
[2:00:33] said unto her woman
[2:00:35] where are those
[2:00:37] nine accusers
[2:00:40] saints i want to ask you this morning
[2:00:43] or put it to you this way
[2:00:45] if we'll move out of this earthly realm
[2:00:47] i'm worried about this and i have
[2:00:48] problems with that and these people are
[2:00:50] trying to do this to me and that's over
[2:00:51] there and they don't like me and
[2:00:53] move out of that move up into heavenly
[2:00:55] places
[2:00:56] and you know what living in heavenly
[2:00:57] places will do for us
[2:00:59] we'll be able to stand and look around
[2:01:02] and say where
[2:01:03] is my accuser
[2:01:05] amen where
[2:01:07] is my accuser
[2:01:09] all i see
[2:01:11] is the blood of jesus christ
[2:01:13] i see heavenly places i'm living in the
[2:01:16] realm with my lord jesus i'm not living
[2:01:19] down here in the trash and the streets
[2:01:21] as it were
[2:01:22] oh my brother and sister i believe
[2:01:24] there's no greater contrast if i could
[2:01:25] just share this with you real quick but
[2:01:27] you go and we we drive down the road and
[2:01:30] we see mcdonald's sack just throw it out
[2:01:32] and we see beer balls throw it out right
[2:01:33] you all seen it
[2:01:35] but you'll go and you'll see some shift
[2:01:36] of a culture
[2:01:38] and countries like chile
[2:01:40] you'll drive down the road and they'll
[2:01:42] be trash from the end of this pew
[2:01:44] to the height of that ceiling thrown up
[2:01:45] against the walls
[2:01:47] down the
[2:01:48] street
[2:01:50] and maybe i'll just throw this in for
[2:01:51] some shock factor
[2:01:54] young girls as young as some of our
[2:01:56] little sisters here
[2:01:58] standing on the street and you can guess
[2:02:00] what their purpose is
[2:02:02] why because someone listened to the
[2:02:06] accuser
[2:02:08] someone took condemnation and did not
[2:02:11] take conviction and therefore had no
[2:02:13] repentance and satan multiplies that to
[2:02:16] generation to generation we ought to be
[2:02:18] saying thank you lord thank you lord for
[2:02:21] what you have done in our lives amen we
[2:02:23] can raise godly children we can see our
[2:02:26] children grow up to be godly mothers and
[2:02:29] moving on through the generations as the
[2:02:31] lord tarries we'll die looking back in
[2:02:33] our family tree and say thank you lord
[2:02:35] that we were in that generation you
[2:02:37] chose we were the chosen people
[2:02:40] hallelujah
[2:02:43] see look at this now
[2:02:44] no man lord jesus said under neither do
[2:02:47] i
[2:02:49] that's it
[2:02:53] what was he doing
[2:02:55] oh you say you're reading too much into
[2:02:57] it paul no sir
[2:02:59] he was cutting condemnation
[2:03:02] out of her life
[2:03:05] pulling that out
[2:03:07] and i believe by revelation
[2:03:09] because he came to her
[2:03:11] he didn't call her a wretched woman
[2:03:14] he didn't
[2:03:16] he didn't go there
[2:03:18] but he says over here huh they're
[2:03:20] convicted
[2:03:21] and you're not condemned
[2:03:24] no hallelujah can somebody say thank you
[2:03:27] lord hallelujah hallelujah
[2:03:30] oh look my brother and sister
[2:03:33] amen this bride of this age already
[2:03:35] found favor with god
[2:03:37] hallelujah let me just keep going on
[2:03:39] here real quick
[2:03:41] uh sister ruth would you just come i've
[2:03:43] got to call this quit amen revelations

[2:03:48] amen and prevailed not neither was their
[2:03:50] place found anymore in heaven and the
[2:03:52] great dragon was cast out that old
[2:03:54] serpent called the devil and satan which
[2:03:56] deceiveth the whole world
[2:03:59] now when you look at that my brother and
[2:04:00] sister i want you to understand now it
[2:04:02] says with deceiveth the whole world
[2:04:04] you realize the scripture says
[2:04:06] that lest time be
[2:04:08] shortened there would be no flesh saved
[2:04:13] this is how
[2:04:14] per uh persuasive
[2:04:17] satan is
[2:04:19] and how weak
[2:04:20] the human or how frail the human flesh
[2:04:23] is
[2:04:24] we rely on our flesh we'll fall satan
[2:04:27] knows it's only a matter of time he just
[2:04:28] keeps grinding
[2:04:30] he keeps grinding i wish i could
[2:04:32] remember where i found that but brother
[2:04:33] brown made a statement he says
[2:04:36] you know the fiery darts he says uh
[2:04:38] that's why you have to get into an
[2:04:40] atmosphere
[2:04:44] so that those darts never get to you
[2:04:46] amen
[2:04:47] come on saints
[2:04:49] can we man up and just hear it straight
[2:04:51] it's time for us to quit oh i'm
[2:04:54] preaching to paul in case anybody's
[2:04:55] wondering i'm preaching to paul oh just
[2:04:57] this fiery dart oh i'm so low i'm so low
[2:05:00] i'm not even a christian i'm so low all
[2:05:02] right
[2:05:03] come on you got to get out of that
[2:05:04] because you're this up and you're this
[2:05:05] down and you're this way and you're that
[2:05:07] way and god doesn't love me and god
[2:05:09] loves me so much god doesn't love me god
[2:05:11] loves me so much
[2:05:12] come on let's man up and let's get in a
[2:05:15] position where we have an atmosphere
[2:05:17] which is the blood of jesus christ and
[2:05:19] that fiery dart never even gets to you
[2:05:22] amen
[2:05:24] hallelujah
[2:05:25] but look at this now
[2:05:27] see the whole world is casting the earth
[2:05:29] and his angels cast out with him now you
[2:05:31] can look at this and you can say oh my
[2:05:33] goodness this is terrible for us it's
[2:05:34] cast into the earth and our loud voice
[2:05:36] saying
[2:05:37] where
[2:05:39] in heaven
[2:05:40] now it's come salvation you see this
[2:05:43] whole message this gospel
[2:05:45] this word of god to you and i was never
[2:05:47] an earthly gospel
[2:05:49] it's always been a heavenly gospel
[2:05:52] so if we live down here and we're
[2:05:53] burrowing through the trash of laodicea
[2:05:56] and we're wondering if god really loves
[2:05:58] us or not life is such a struggle and i
[2:06:00] don't even know if i'm a christian it's
[2:06:01] time for you to climb up out of the
[2:06:03] trash get out of the gutter but god's
[2:06:06] not going to make you do that you can
[2:06:07] choose to live in the gutter but god
[2:06:09] wants you to get up and when you get out
[2:06:11] of there and you start cutting away the
[2:06:13] things of this world you start doing
[2:06:15] this
[2:06:16] what do you do you rise up in to
[2:06:18] heavenly places and then you start
[2:06:19] hearing voices in heaven
[2:06:22] people are like oh they hear voices
[2:06:23] that's just too weird no get out of the
[2:06:25] gutter
[2:06:26] come on to the naysayer that thinks that
[2:06:28] some christian stands up and says and
[2:06:30] god spoke to me oh that's just so what
[2:06:32] no get out of the gutter
[2:06:34] i'm not going to come down there so you
[2:06:35] can maybe somehow see that something's
[2:06:37] different you get out of the gutter and
[2:06:39] get up in heavenly places because that's
[2:06:41] where god's speaking
[2:06:42] god's not speaking in the gutter as it
[2:06:44] were my brother and sister he goes to
[2:06:46] the gutter he redeems out of the gutter
[2:06:48] he doesn't leave him in the gutter
[2:06:51] well you know god loves me and if he
[2:06:53] wanted me out of here he'd take me out
[2:06:54] of here get out of there
[2:06:56] come on man up get out of there
[2:06:59] get up into heavenly places now has come
[2:07:01] salvation i say amen and strength and i
[2:07:04] say amen and the kingdom of our god
[2:07:07] which i'm a part of i say amen and the
[2:07:09] power of his christ which is in me i say
[2:07:12] amen for the accuser of our brethren is
[2:07:16] cast down which accuse them before our
[2:07:19] god
[2:07:20] day and night amen
[2:07:24] i just sometimes i can't sleep my mind
[2:07:26] torments me
[2:07:27] cast him out
[2:07:28] amen
[2:07:30] oh no as long as you're in the
[2:07:32] oh i hope i don't offend anybody
[2:07:35] as long as you're in the
[2:07:36] victim
[2:07:38] mentality
[2:07:40] you won't do nothing
[2:07:42] but complain
[2:07:45] get up out of that gutter that's right
[2:07:46] man up
[2:07:48] stand up and say before the foundation
[2:07:50] of the world i was in the mind of god
[2:07:52] i'm written on his hand and i was part
[2:07:55] of his creation i'm the chosen of people
[2:07:59] and i refuse satan to give you
[2:08:02] trespass
[2:08:04] for your little driveway into my life
[2:08:06] i'm going to drive the post

[2:10:30] quote

[2:10:34] not to go much further than that
[2:10:40] lovely service here i suggest that you
[2:10:43] go listen to it read it
[2:10:49] you might ask that question has anybody
[2:10:50] ever asked that question
[2:10:52] lord how can i overcome i keep seems
[2:10:54] like i've failed lord how can i overcome
[2:10:58] the third great assault
[2:11:02] i like mysteries
[2:11:05] i present this as a mystery you go find
[2:11:07] out what the other two
[2:11:08] great assaults were
[2:11:10] solve the mystery find out what they are
[2:11:13] the third great assault satan offered to
[2:11:15] forfeit this kingdom this is powerful
[2:11:18] saints
[2:11:19] satan offered to forfeit this kingdom to
[2:11:21] him right when he when he was offering
[2:11:22] after jesus come from the wilderness he
[2:11:24] did satan said see these kingdoms of the
[2:11:26] world these are mine i deal with them
[2:11:28] whatever i want to i'll forfeit them to
[2:11:30] you and that's the scripture says i'll
[2:11:32] give this to you
[2:11:33] i'll give you all of this i'll give it
[2:11:35] to you
[2:11:38] see how slippery the devil is
[2:11:41] i do with them whatever i want to i'll
[2:11:42] forfeit them to you but remember he was
[2:11:44] trying to get him to forfeit without
[2:11:47] the cross
[2:11:50] give him the whole world
[2:11:53] the song says take this whole world but
[2:11:55] give me jesus
[2:11:57] amen
[2:11:58] though a man have all wealth and fame i
[2:12:00] think that's niv man have all wealth and
[2:12:03] fame but without the person of christ
[2:12:07] you are nothing
[2:12:11] forfeited without the cross if he did
[2:12:13] we'd be lost
[2:12:15] he could have took the kingdom but he
[2:12:16] must follow he must come back he was
[2:12:18] tempted to do it now remember the
[2:12:20] scripture says tempted of
[2:12:22] some things
[2:12:23] no scripture says he was tempted of all
[2:12:25] things
[2:12:27] so when you see this knowing what was
[2:12:29] going to come
[2:12:30] there was something inside of him was
[2:12:32] like
[2:12:32] take the easy way out that was the flesh
[2:12:34] speaking
[2:12:35] now if jesus christ could look at his
[2:12:37] flesh
[2:12:38] and deny it
[2:12:41] can't we
[2:12:43] can't we come to a place that we look at
[2:12:45] our flesh and say
[2:12:46] this is not good for me
[2:12:48] it's not good for me
[2:12:50] reminds me of brother donnie reagan one
[2:12:52] time
[2:12:53] pretty hard words
[2:12:55] but he's like you people that think you
[2:12:57] can take that bag of chips in that case
[2:12:59] of pepsi and sit down in front of your
[2:13:01] favorite movie and say lord bless this
[2:13:04] to my body
[2:13:06] or fooling yourself
[2:13:10] you are which we
[2:13:13] you are what you eat
[2:13:16] [Music]
[2:13:20] he could have took the kingdom must
[2:13:21] follow come back he was tempted to do it
[2:13:23] now death is a hard thing he was tempted
[2:13:26] to take his liberty and be the king of
[2:13:27] the earth without the cross
[2:13:30] but if he did his subjects would have
[2:13:32] died satan would have gladly made that
[2:13:35] proposition with him but he said get
[2:13:37] behind me satan he didn't do it he come
[2:13:40] and suffered and took the hard rugged
[2:13:42] round he took the route of persecution
[2:13:45] he took the route of death
[2:13:48] hallelujah and we this morning willing
[2:13:51] to do take that same route that he's
[2:13:53] taken are we willing to die are we
[2:13:55] willing to give ourselves up to god
[2:13:59] forfeit all the world and the things to
[2:14:01] serve for him see now he failed to do it
[2:14:04] willingly to forfeit it satan was to him
[2:14:07] but he didn't do it though jesus was
[2:14:09] tempted he overcame for us
[2:14:11] he endured all temptations for me and
[2:14:13] for you see he could have took it right
[2:14:15] then but what he did he took the other
[2:14:18] route for so that we could come be with
[2:14:20] him
[2:14:21] and if he paid such a price as that then
[2:14:24] how little would we be
[2:14:27] not to take it amen
[2:14:29] wow to me that was powerful
[2:14:32] this this was a little off route of what
[2:14:34] we were thinking today saints but just
[2:14:35] to look at this my brother and sister
[2:14:39] he declared us worthy enough
[2:14:41] he could have just said
[2:14:43] why should i suffer for them
[2:14:45] they're all guilty of my word anyhow
[2:14:48] every one of them think about it on the
[2:14:50] earth and that day right then my
[2:14:51] brother's sister everyone on the earth
[2:14:54] in that day right there was guilty of
[2:14:57] the word of god
[2:14:59] in their own merit and flesh would be
[2:15:01] found guilty
[2:15:03] but he looked down to the end and said
[2:15:04] my word says
[2:15:06] my word says my word says
[2:15:09] it is written it is written it is
[2:15:11] written there will be this one there
[2:15:14] will be that one your family your family
[2:15:16] your family your family he's like
[2:15:17] they'll be there they'll believe my word
[2:15:19] they'll act on my word and they will
[2:15:21] raise up in that last day as shining as
[2:15:24] the stars of the heavens
[2:15:27] giving glory and praise to me
[2:15:30] oh i'm glad he looked beyond the present
[2:15:32] circumstance i'm glad he looked beyond
[2:15:34] that i'm glad he remembered that he had
[2:15:37] written my name in the palm of his hand
[2:15:39] he had written my name in that book in
[2:15:42] his own precious blood and i remember
[2:15:44] that and said this is what this is what
[2:15:48] this is what i come for
[2:15:50] and yet because he took on that vessel
[2:15:53] of flesh
[2:15:54] you imagine if it was just as it would
[2:15:56] be could be and it can't but it would be
[2:15:59] that god had come down himself
[2:16:04] the beauty of it changed
[2:16:06] he took on flesh
[2:16:09] that your flesh
[2:16:10] could look at his flesh
[2:16:12] and say
[2:16:14] i believe i'm understanding what he felt
[2:16:18] i believe i understand the sacrifice i
[2:16:20] believe
[2:16:21] because i know how i feel
[2:16:24] every time i want to turn and run
[2:16:28] brother jason kind of jokingly in the
[2:16:30] office
[2:16:31] says about well it's good to have you
[2:16:32] back and i said yeah jay
[2:16:35] i don't know sister jerry and i had to
[2:16:36] pick up
[2:16:37] we had a credit card we had a bunch of
[2:16:39] cash
[2:16:40] we're already on the road
[2:16:42] i thought about just driving those few
[2:16:44] extra miles to arizona
[2:16:48] but you see we can't turn and run
[2:16:51] we can't turn and run
[2:16:53] we can't take the easy route
[2:16:55] we were predestinated to stand as
[2:16:58] soldiers of the cross to live a life
[2:17:01] right in satan's throne room
[2:17:03] and i'm telling you my brother and
[2:17:04] sister i can name this and i don't want
[2:17:06] to depress you some of you're looking at
[2:17:07] me all depressed here i can see it
[2:17:09] you're about ready to cry
[2:17:10] maybe you're hungry
[2:17:12] [Music]
[2:17:16] drag queens
[2:17:20] gender dysphoria
[2:17:21] [Music]
[2:17:23] insanity
[2:17:26] we got to take away your guns
[2:17:31] well why don't they work at getting rid
[2:17:32] of the devil
[2:17:35] i'm not talking about politics here
[2:17:37] sister jerry and i a few years ago in
[2:17:39] australia i asked one of the brothers
[2:17:41] there he's kind of anti-gun he was
[2:17:43] appalled
[2:17:44] that i had an innumerable amount of guns
[2:17:47] why do you have those
[2:17:50] they took our guns away
[2:17:52] it picked my interest so i'd ask another
[2:17:53] brother that seemed to be more
[2:17:56] understanding
[2:17:59] they took away your guns what happened
[2:18:00] to your crime
[2:18:02] oh death by hammer went up 300 percent
[2:18:06] death by screwdriver went up 250 percent
[2:18:11] death by strangulation went up so many
[2:18:13] percent
[2:18:15] why
[2:18:16] they didn't get rid of the accuser
[2:18:19] they're trying to eliminate this and
[2:18:20] eliminate this and eliminate this saints
[2:18:22] don't don't let that happen i'm done
[2:18:24] don't let that happen if i if i you know
[2:18:26] it'd be like going home today and saying
[2:18:28] okay to be a better christian i'm going
[2:18:29] to give up coffee
[2:18:32] some of you wouldn't make it through the
[2:18:33] day
[2:18:37] and it'd either be a hammer
[2:18:39] a screwdriver or a rope that you would
[2:18:42] use on someone else
[2:18:44] no no that's not the problem
[2:18:47] the problem is the accuser has been
[2:18:49] allowed to run rampant
[2:18:52] and he has robbed their sanity he has
[2:18:54] robbed everything from them and they are
[2:18:56] bankrupt and they don't know they're so
[2:18:59] in a delusion they said in this day a
[2:19:01] strong delusion would come upon the
[2:19:03] people they're in so delusion we'll take
[2:19:05] this away and that'll solve it it don't
[2:19:07] take this away and it'll no no and
[2:19:10] they're just going and that's why my
[2:19:11] brother and sister now forgive me but
[2:19:13] that's why they look silly as they do i
[2:19:15] was going to use a different stronger
[2:19:17] word but that's why they look as silly
[2:19:18] as they do we think what's wrong with
[2:19:20] this government what's wrong with all of
[2:19:21] this stuff because they're trying to
[2:19:23] take carnal things to solve a spiritual
[2:19:26] problem and it won't work and that's why
[2:19:29] i felt so strongly on my heart today and
[2:19:31] i have kept you and i'm not going to
[2:19:33] apologize it's time for us to make sure
[2:19:35] the accuser is out of our marriage the
[2:19:38] accuser is out of our child rearing the
[2:19:40] accuser is out of our prayer life he's
[2:19:42] out of our bible reading he's out of our
[2:19:44] fellowship he's out of our house
[2:19:49] and when the accuser gets out of your
[2:19:50] house peace moves in
[2:19:53] but as long as the accuser has reign
[2:19:55] then we'll be this is your fault and
[2:19:57] this is your fault and this is your
[2:19:59] because we take on the spirit of the
[2:20:01] accuser and we start to accuse those
[2:20:03] around us that we love and pretty soon
[2:20:05] we accuse god and say well god failed me
[2:20:08] how often do you hear that i've talked
[2:20:10] to many a young person that has come and
[2:20:13] by god's grace has come in chile it
[2:20:15] seemed like there was a season that that
[2:20:17] was very strong that young men
[2:20:19] especially there in chile were saying i
[2:20:22] don't even think there is a god i i
[2:20:24] don't even see that there's a god but
[2:20:26] god rich in mercy can someone say that
[2:20:29] you're rich in mercy come down into that
[2:20:32] nation come down amongst those young
[2:20:35] people and bound the accuser and today
[2:20:38] they have raised up and have beautiful
[2:20:40] families serving god why because they
[2:20:43] took it serious and bound the accuser
[2:20:45] and said i don't care where i've been i
[2:20:48] don't care what i've done i have been
[2:20:50] set free and i'm a new creature in
[2:20:52] christ jesus
[2:20:54] it's time for us to man up
[2:20:56] man up and kick that accuser out of our
[2:20:59] life and out of our church and out of
[2:21:02] our homes
[2:21:03] hallelujah let's stand and just worship
[2:21:05] the lord
[2:21:06] i'm sorry if i kind of yelled and
[2:21:09] got a little excited today hallelujah
[2:21:13] but you know what the accuser's done
[2:21:16] he can't take it away from you
[2:21:18] but he can sure cause you to forfeit it
[2:21:21] convince you to the point you're not
[2:21:22] worthy to handle it
[2:21:24] not worthy to receive the benefits of it
[2:21:28] that's not what my bible says
[2:21:30] my bible says that this was the free
[2:21:32] will gift of god
[2:21:34] to you and i
[2:21:36] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:21:39] open my eyes brother jay come and help
[2:21:41] me
[2:21:42] hallelujah
[2:21:44] oh hallelujah oh my
[2:21:49] i don't mean to make light saints but i
[2:21:51] left the other half of the sermon at
[2:21:52] home on the desk amen i tell you what
[2:21:55] i'm just so sick and tired of the devil
[2:21:59] do you ever have a friend like that
[2:22:00] now if they're in here in the church
[2:22:02] today just don't shake your head just
[2:22:03] stand real calm and look straight ahead
[2:22:06] but you ever had a friend that just
[2:22:07] constantly had to give you your opinion
[2:22:10] well you're you're not successful
[2:22:11] because of this
[2:22:12] you didn't do this you're there you're
[2:22:14] that
[2:22:15] you know what the devil is i mean i'll
[2:22:16] use brother david as the example here
[2:22:18] that the devil's just going to be there

[2:22:29] do that run over that stop sign that'd
[2:22:32] be fun

[2:22:38] the devil's the one that caused you to
[2:22:40] rob the bank and then he went and was
[2:22:42] the one who called 9-1-1
[2:22:44] yeah that's the accuser
[2:22:47] time time saints to kick the accuser to
[2:22:49] the curb
[2:22:50] let him go live in that gutter he
[2:22:52] thought he created for you

[2:40:50] now look saints
[2:40:51] brother andrew is going to be coming
[2:40:53] this coming weekend
[2:40:54] friday evening seven o'clock just like
[2:40:57] it was a youth meeting
[2:40:59] everyone's invited but brother andrew is
[2:41:00] going to speak focus towards the young
[2:41:03] people
[2:41:04] and i look forward to that because
[2:41:06] strangely enough in my ideas
[2:41:08] he's a young person
[2:41:10] that's scary he's fixing to have a child
[2:41:12] not him his wife
[2:41:15] but uh
[2:41:16] anyway a young man grew up in the
[2:41:18] message
[2:41:19] faced the struggles of growing up in
[2:41:21] church
[2:41:23] growing up in all of the thing and being
[2:41:25] a smart young man all these different
[2:41:27] factors there i believe he has something
[2:41:29] really good for our young people
[2:41:31] friday evening seven
[2:41:33] and then saturday some people say it's
[2:41:36] too early to be at six o'clock
[2:41:39] but
[2:41:40] if you're here at seven and go home at
[2:41:43] 11 you'll be too tired on sunday to
[2:41:46] shout lift your hands so
[2:41:48] six o'clock
[2:41:50] saturday evening
[2:41:51] sunday 10 30 regular service
[2:41:55] with
[2:41:56] fellowship afterwards
[2:41:59] okay i just want to make sure everybody
[2:42:01] i know there's some there here
[2:42:03] sister grace share it
[2:42:06] um
[2:42:07] with all the family make sure everyone
[2:42:09] knows amen
[2:42:11] if you see somebody's not here today
[2:42:12] make sure they know
[2:42:14] okay
[2:42:16] seven friday
[2:42:18] and everyone's welcome but the focus is
[2:42:20] going to be more young people
[2:42:23] and then we have a special surprise that
[2:42:24] will happen on sunday i'm i'm not gonna
[2:42:27] i'm not gonna
[2:42:29] disclose that right now you'll just get
[2:42:31] to see it
[2:42:33] it's a beautiful thing
[2:42:35] i love you in the lord each one of you
[2:42:37] i don't take your time up just for the
[2:42:39] sake of taking your time
[2:42:43] and i don't offer as an excuse
[2:42:49] but there's just so many nuggets
[2:42:54] you know they say that the preacher
[2:42:56] often times preaches
[2:42:58] what's happening in his own life
[2:43:01] so if it seemed today that i might have
[2:43:03] been a little rough a little pointed
[2:43:06] just remember there's three
[2:43:08] back at me
[2:43:11] the accuser
[2:43:12] he don't care how much victory you've
[2:43:14] had
[2:43:16] how many prayers have been answered
[2:43:18] what you've overcome he's still going to
[2:43:20] show up as it is the cat on the screen
[2:43:23] door
[2:43:23] and he's still going to be there because
[2:43:27] while you were called to do as it were
[2:43:29] your job he was called to do his job
[2:43:32] he's pretty faithful at his job
[2:43:34] but we have overcome
[2:43:36] by the blood of the lamb
[2:43:38] and by your testimony of the word of god
[2:43:43] amen we love you god bless you today
[2:43:46] amen
[2:43:56] right
[2:44:16] [Music]
[2:47:29] you
