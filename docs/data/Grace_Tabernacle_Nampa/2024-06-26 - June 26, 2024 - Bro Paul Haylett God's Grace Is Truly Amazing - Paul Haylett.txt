at the well the same God whose wonders to many to tell the the Raging Red Sea he's the same God who's living in [Music] me can we say Amen to that this evening to have that Revelation amen that it is the same God and we have been so clearly identified in the word amen we we're not here in the word just looking and hoping but we're here because we are knowing amen we've come to a knowing and to an experience of who I am when the word's talking about behold I send you Elijah the prophet we're not looking over the fence at someone else we stand up and say that's me that's me and I say thank you Lord amen and I I really appreciate brother Alex's song service you don't know obviously the thoughts that have went uh through my head concerning this and it's going to be a very simple thought tonight I I hope you don't mind uh something just very simple just something uh that you know just kind of uh you know just bouncing around in the head and then you think I I just need to kind of just Express this uh maybe as much for my own good is for yours but uh I want to speak to you tonight uh uh amen let me back up here uh I just want to remind you communion will be this coming Sunday 5:00 and uh we're so happy to have brother IL and sister Natasha and their children beautiful children you have uh have them visiting us amen with their family here and so by God's grace we just pray that you're blessed amen I want to talk to you about God's grace is absolutely amazing amen and uh you see the picture thank you musicians God bless you thank you brother Alex let's turn our Bibles to Genesis the 4th chapter verses 1-10 and um I I'll put it to you this way uh I had a little thought that was there in my in my thoughts and I if you look at my desk you'll see that I have a lot of thoughts that haven't made it any farther than being scribbled on a page and if that's seems awkward they tell you that people whose deaths are messy are brilliant so if that would help offset that but often times you have these these thoughts that are on a page or in a notebook or in your phone or however you would keep those and sometimes God just stores them up and at the right moment something happens from those and some of these right moments sermon Brother David preached recently sermon brother Dany preached at Camp some things that brother Chris has said and these thoughts of my own all jumbl together put together and um I hope that it makes sense tonight amen Genesis the 4th chapter veres 1-10 and Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bear Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord and she again be his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground and in the process of time this a little bit you know of what brother Chris preached a Wednesday or two ago time in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord let me just interject this right now just real quick I I'll lose the thought in the deal you realize that both of these men Drew their substance from the earth the Sheep ate of the grass growing in the earth Cain was bringing forth the fruit that come forth from the earth so I I'll elaborate a little more on that but we want to realize that that God had them very much anchored back to his creation they were they were not in another realm as we live in this day and age but they were right there connected to creation and Abel uh well back up in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very WTH and his countenance fell and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wroth and why is thou countenance Fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lith at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him and Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him and the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper and we see right here Cain was bold enough to lie to the Lord pretty strong isn't it stand in the presence of God tell a lie CU he knew exactly where his brother was and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crith unto me from the ground Heavenly Father we just ask you tonight just to bless this time together Lord just to be in fellowship with you father is is such a necessity for us but it's also such a blessing father for us to come together as Saints of like Precious Faith to to sing together to worship together together Lord to come in thy presence together Lord truly as close as Heaven on Earth can get as Sons and Daughters of God your bride worshiping in your presence we thank you for the opportunity ask you to guide us tonight in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated amen now as we look through these scriptures we realize that uh the whole story of Adam and Eve and we see that here at this point in time they've already had the experience in the garden they've already had all kinds of things take place around them Supernatural things not not just random things that have no no real meaning but the supernatural had already taken place in their presence and so as it is this stumbles a lot of people on the Earth today uh because uh they say well uh Eve said that she had a child from the Lord but we understand as brother brandham brought it out very clearly for us and by God's grace we catch that that all life comes from God Amen so it doesn't matter there's no other creation there's no other uh uh uh seed out there but what the seed that God had put together now the fact that it got perverted uh we still recognize was part of the plan of God because if it was not God would have spoke and put a stop to it but we see here that this life that come and we look at Cain and as they are there these two uh children and as it was the course of life when they were little babies crawling around uh it might not have been so evident but it was this two Natures from the very beginning two expressions of humanity and uh as they grew up my brother and sister uh it's irregardless of the occupation some people have been poked pretty hard by people that says well Paul you're a tiller of the soil we see on which side of this equation that you are on but you see it's irregardless of the occupation it really had nothing to do with being a tiller of the soil or the Sheep amen so it's there regardless of that our offering we might be Engineers doctors this that and the other uh whatever we have to offer to God is has to be presented to be acceptable in other words my brother and sister if we were fabulously rich but we cared about our position position with God God would recognize and accept our offering just the same as he would anyone else and if we are the poorest of the poor God will still accept our offering this had nothing to do with occupation amen and if anything I'd say sometimes our occupation might be more hindrance than blessing but we'll look at this and realize that uh as we are anointed in this day in this time uh the culmination you might say to realize just how important it is to be acceptable it's no longer we'll take care of this later in life we'll take care of this down the road we'll take care of this under great ministry my brother and sister God's dealing oneon-one and I say Lord come and deal amen deal with us father that we would just know how important it is for us to be pleasing amen and so I I I just want to focus just to hear more on this before we move on Amen and being a keeper of sheep was not Abel's righteousness amen now the fact that God placed him in that position I believe is a very symbolic uh to me I I don't want to be wrong on this but I believe it's very symbolic because he had very much a connection with the offering that he was giving maybe more so in that nature but my brother and sister being a tiller of the soil was not Cain's curse amen I'm emphatic about that because if it didn't work for Cain and it had to do with that I'm in trouble but that's not where it was amen it wasn't a keeper of sheep was the righteousness and a tiller of the soil was the curse my brother and sister amen now you look and we can see this very clearly in the word before there was ever a formal theological schooling before somebody said let's sit down and teach people about the word of God let's teach them how to preach let's teach them you know as brother brandham said to you know say Amen you know as they sometimes still do but you look at that none of that uh was uh uh there at that time in a formal sense but yet the private interpretation of the word was already taking place so is there sitting there under this anointing Cain is hearing everything that was said from his childhood up and his mind his Spirit you might say the anointing upon Him processed that in a certain fashion but here is Abel hearing the exact same words and the Bible we'll say just for uh if you'll excuse me the Bible spoke to him differently the word that he heard had an entirely different interpretation to him it was not his formal schooling it was not you know that was a little more attentive in Sunday school or or bi Vacation Bible School it was something much deeper than that and when the word spoke when it came forth amen he heard an entirely different word and I tell you that's what's happening in the day that we live in the bride of Christ there's men that can preach this Bible so eloquent so powerful but my brother and sister when you preach the word and there's no one to hear it from God's voice it's powerless it produces something that is polished and fine but it doesn't produce life amen oh as a prophet of God said somebody spit and sputter and do whatever else but bring the spirit of God the Holy Spirit down in the midst of the people Let It Be we don't need polish my brother and sister we need Revelation and the revealing as it is of the word to you and I let us hear it different amen Hallelujah so this private interpretation is taking place and you can look at this because I I put this this way in my notes by Revelation or by man's idea because you see my brother and sister God uses man so sometimes it has been a man's words or a man explanation that actually triggered something in you but it wasn't the man himself so we can have the two-sided thing of this people say I got a revelation from the Lord that's almost like saying I got a child from the Lord if it's not really the Lord my brother and sister it's not really Revelation amen so if it's there you can have it by Revelation or have it by man's idea but you see what was happening with Cain is there was an understanding that he was taking he was receiving it was actually outside of the word it was actually what you would say extra biblical they had a whole formulation and in that what was taking place with Cain he's right there a tiller of the soil I don't believe that that Abel was Far Over the Hill somewhere I believe that he saw his brother probably every day and they was probably a rub shoulders interacted maybe even sat down an eight together and there was two men with two Revelations side by side every day and we'll see that it produced two entirely different results in the same midst the prophet of God said it'd come right down it'd be right in the church the preaching of the word and I'll just put it in this way if you don't mind the preaching opening of the scripture the reading of quotes all of these things come together will produce two entirely different results because one will be a man's revelation and the other one's Gods one will be God speaking and the other man speaking and in that realm we see what was happening with Cain and Abel it it's almost pardon me for putting it this way but it almost makes you feel sad for Cain because he went to church and he really thought that polishing everything up and making it its finest was what would please God but where did that idea come from that's right the one who wanted to exalt himself even AB above the Mount of the most high he thought if I can get in a position of leadership then I could turn this church around if I could get in a position of leadership I could really reveal to these people what the holy spirit is doing if I was in this but God said that's not really what I'm looking for I'm not looking for a man that can do all of these things I'm looking for a man that will introduce the people to Jesus Christ and get the Holy Ghost living in them not show them an image of the Holy Ghost but get the Holy Ghost into them and then let that word bring them into Heavenly places amen if they don't get the word in them as a prophet of God explained to us like astronauts they're not pressurized they blow up and look around us I I'm going to speak a little bit direct we around the message have had plenty of explosions and the reason is is because I'm I'm sorry to put this this direct but they thought they could make a big beautiful church and God would be pleased with that and so amen they they had an understanding that was outside of the word that was taking place and this is where Cain got confused because he was just as sincere in fact the prophet of God said he would be more sincere than you are oh that might smart a little bit but we can see that sincerity in the world today more sincere my brother and sister that we would be but that sincerity without God's pleasure is worthless amen there's no value in that amen and so as private interpretation is taking place Amen on the other side we have Abel by revelation amen something about it I we're just assuming a little bit but bear with me something about Mom and Dad talking about when they were in the garden and maybe they didn't really talk about it much but they knew that at that time that that Bloody sheep skin slapping around their legs as they walked out something anchored down in his soul and said there's something about the blood there's something about the blood that God cares about that he didn't choose a giant fig Leaf he didn't choose a banana he didn't choose any other kind of covering not a religious covering not an intellectual covering but he chose a bloody covering amen and in that realm right there something comes down in Abel's heart and he says you know what if God if God used a lamb in the very beginning and I'm offering myself in my recognition of my Frailty and the things of my shortcoming then I'm going to offer a lamb and amen and let the blood be the covering Hallelujah you realize that it wasn't the skin of the Lamb it was the blood that was on the skin Hallelujah and Satan certainly in the day that we live in we can see this very clearly but Satan anointed man to be very certain very sure of his idea and so as as Cain is there he is as sure as sure can be if we could be taken back in time and sit down as it were uh uh maybe the fly on the wall proverbially that that we'd be there and listen to this you would say Cain is sincere we see his sincerity it wasn't a flippant thing I'm just going to throw some flowers and some fruit on the altar he was sincere that this beautiful bouquet and all of the fruit of the soil would please God after all it was God's cre creation it come from it's God's Earth God's seed really how far off could Cain be if Cain had been right what would have been nailed to the cross a basket of vegetables see it's all out of kelter but in the moment come on you you've had moment moments we've all had moments oh what I'm doing everybody just I don't care what they think they need to just be happy with this oh okay some of you do grin pretty loud I didn't make a mistake there your grin was really loud you see we all come to time every man is right in his own eyes and here is Cain just as right as right can be this will please God so Satan anoints a man to be sure of his ideas but God anoints men or moves men to be sure of their ideas because when a man is Anointed by the Holy Ghost he can stand assured that he has the right thing can we say amen amen it's when God's moving in our life I'm not talking about us having an idea I'm talking about God's in the control tower and we can then walk out with confidence what I'm doing is what God wants me to do his leadership is perfect his leadership is powerful his leadership cannot fail me and if I am in him and he is in me I can't be lost amen the devil can't snatch me away amen now many men are sure whether they're right or wrong some are very sure and they're sure their confidence has killed many a person brother Bram says in Christ revealed in his own word amen very short quote but I I just thought it fit perfectly notice now we come back we got to have something another that we have to hold on to is't this interesting that our marriage vows that we take is to have it to hold right because God knew that that would be important to us we have to hold on to that and we need that something has to be a TI poost in other words it's an ultimate and everyone must have an ultimate or an absolute I preached on it one time years ago on an absolute a place that has the last word now I'm surmising a little bit please forgive me but I believe if Cain could have got down on the very altar he placed all the flowers and the fruit and prayed through yes he to come up with a different point of view but you see there's a point and this will get deep and I'm going to just skirt the edge of it for sake of time there's a point that people get down and they pray and they get up believing they have an answer now we have examples in the message I didn't include it tonight for time but remember brother Brown's praying with that young lady and she gets down oh I've prayed through and brother Brown says no you haven't you're going to go out and be exactly like you was right she was in the institution you're going to be exactly like you was and then she gets down and prays some more and brother Bram said still not far enough and you see when she finally got into the what I would say the the complete position that God was calling her to when she raised her her head that time and said brother Brown I believe I've got it brother Brown doesn't tell her keep praying because he knew she had it now if you follow me if Cain had come to that kind of a position Cain would have got up from the altar started collecting the flowers and the fruit and he'd have went and found him a lamb amen he wouldn't have just went home he'd have found a lamb because he'd had the Revelation that the lamb is the only Redemption that he had but you see he had an intellectual understanding and if he got up from that altar under that condition he'd have went and got more flowers and fruit said my offering is not big enough I didn't give enough but you see only one little lamb is all it took amen so we have to have as Believers as real Christians amen we have to have an ultimate or an absolute amen and in that realm right there my brother and sister you know it can't be the pastor and it can't be the church as a body my brother and sister it has to be our Lord Jesus Christ and he's already spoke to you and I amen he's already put his thoughts his Direction in written form and as we sit here tonight you know often times people say I just don't know what to do I've got questions about this or questions about that then read till you find the answer amen and I'll tell you how faithful God is this has happened in my own life I know it happened to the prophet of God there at the cave but I tell you I've had questions before literally sat down very troubled and sit down pick up my Bible put it in my lap and my Bible fall open and I look down and read and there's my answer it doesn't get any clearer than that I don't need someone to explain it to me I don't need some guidance for somebody to to you need to do this and need to do that God come on the scene open his book spoke to us through the written word amen and I tell you that happens a lot more than people really sometimes grasp that God deals with us amen so look at this an absolute now an atheist a real atheist not the ones who just want to dodge talking about religion a real atheist has an absolute in fact many of those real atheists are stronger committed than many Christians you couldn't budge them with a bulldozzer amen now look at the agnostic agnostics are interesting as as one brother told me one time he said you know agnostics are just full of excuses if you can get them emptied out and put something else in there they'd probably a Believer but because they they just don't know what to do they've heard so much negative seen so much Negative they they just uh uh you know nothing's known absolutely nothing's known and we can't prove it after all we've never seen Jesus I want to ask you tonight have you seen Jesus he didn't come in a physical form to us but he has revealed himself to his bride she knows who she's marrying she knows who she's engaged to she know knows who has the answer to her life and she knows who she wants to take a name yes amen the Satan worshiper if you don't mind I'll share just a little brief Story one time many years ago I I had a painting contracting business and and um you know often times you know they they give you all this the new the the person buying the house wants these walls these colors this that and the other and uh most of the time you never meet them but one day the contractor called me up and said Paul um this lady had um some particularly large furniture that they moved upstairs and scraped the walls up and I I knew I was coming he said I I need you to go touch that up take care of that okay I think I'm going to a house that you know it's just going to me there but I realized there's somebody here now I don't want to be cross but the person who opened the door didn't look the least like a Christian to me but in the course of painting touching up her house which was way more extensive um than it should have been um she starts to share her life she had been raised in some kind of a cult she had literally watched a child been killed for some kind of satanic offering and was terrified as the child that she would be next and she gives her whole story of her life as she's laying this all out then comes what I'm going to call the punchline and then she tells me I'm a born again Christian now in my experience with this lady not judging her but just going from this experience there was nothing I had experienced at this point prepared me for the idea that she was a Christian does that make sense to you and in that I started to to kind of well first off I felt like running out of the house screaming jumping in my pickup and driving away you can keep the tools uh but then something else happened and I I started to ask her questions I started to ask her what was what was your experience like now you were a admitted Satan worshipper how is that different from worshiping god well actually not much now at the time I thought something missing but the more I pondered this I realized remember an angel of Light that's right so close to deceive the very elect if it's possible then this woman had an experience but in the Christian world no one had ever taken her all the way so she went from a Satan worshipper to worshiping God but never quite this sounds rough but never quite made it to the throne never quite made it on the sea of Crystal before before God to receive that very enthusiastic did tons of things for her church but my brother and sister there is the image that we see the word talking about that this lady had not let go of all of the ritual of satanic worship and she admitted it she said a lot of things I I just realize I've got to change I tried witnessing to her but she wasn't interested she's like I've talked to my pastor over and over again and and uh so I don't need to hear from you and I was well good it wasn't my job but understand the satanic worshipper thinks they're worshiping the correct the enlightened powerful we get down to the rubber meets the road you can blame it on the prophet he spoke it not me the make believer sits right here in church goes for 20 30 40 50 years never really grasp the word because if he had grasped the word he would have moved into a whole different category what have changed their life entirely but they sat there and said yep that's what the prophet said yep that's what the prophet said yep that's what the prophet said I want to know do you know what God said about it amen because when God speaks he doesn't speak just to our ears he doesn't just speak to our emotion he speaks to our whole being from our head to our toes and fingertip to fingertip God doesn't do superficial and so as it is there what had happened my brother and sister and the whole time Cain and Abel were there Cain got Anointed with a superficial amen Abel had something and pardon me for using it like this but it made his toes T tingle amen he just had something he knew this is the word this is the life this is what I've got to do and we find I'll get ahead of myself here but we'll find that the interaction the interaction my brother and sister the same verbiage can agree on so many things so Abel sitting right there maybe in the presence uh of his parents and he's talking to his brother Cain and Cain's going yeah yeah that's right that's right but something down here is hearing something entirely different Abel wouldn't know that they would have parted ways that day or before that day and said I'll see you at church on Sunday he comes with a bloody lamb and his brother comes with bushels and bushels of vegetables and flowers and fruits okay he has a different see how scary this is when people say they just have a little different view of the message just a little bit different good brother faithful they're they're great but one shows up with a lamb and one shows up with a basket full of vegetables and we see what the story is one pleased God and one didn't oh Lord help us to have that understanding that Supernatural understanding Lord I don't want to just hear a good preacher I want to know what you think Lord I want what you said to register in me that I know exactly what you're thinking Lord I don't want to hear it second or third hand hand or I don't want to hear it intellectualized I want to hear it straight from the Throne of God it come as a two-edged sword and if it cuts me to the mar of my bone I want to say thank you Lord and amen to the word what happened to the real believer abble was there he didn't say hey look I was reading this or I fought this but there was something inside of him that was saying how this was it and how this and that was there and there's just something inside of me keeps saying take the first of your flock imagine a man who would love his sheep so much he knew which one of those was perfect think about it well this one got a bad foot bad leg can't hear can't see scrawny he's the prime candidate no sir he went out and took the very best that he had and he slew it now I think this was a moment of truth that must have maybe shocked both of them and when they come to that Altar and one's there and I'm telling you my brother and sister imagine what it would be your Sunday Best and you went out in your backyard and you killed the lamb Abel showed up looked like a mess Cain showed up perfect in fact I can almost see Cain if you don't mind me putting it this way going in the last moment and putting this flower just like this and arranging these grapes right here and get yeah there it is and here's Abel yeah what do I do with these bloody hands somebody would have said Abel you got blood on your face but what can I do about it had Revelation that it wasn't a time to go home and take a shower figuratively if you understand what I'm saying I got to get this blood off of me I say no Lord don't let us ever come under anointing to get the blood off of us Satan comes by all kinds of things occupations and relationship ships and this that and other for us to take the blood off but my brother and sister I say Lord pour the blood on us father let the blood keep coming to cover me because I am a man as the Apostle Paul speak to us when I would do good evil is present with me we can interpret that many different ways but Paul felt enough to speak those words and tell you I'm trying to do my best but Evil's right here amen I'm sorry about getting so excited amen but look all of them feel that they're correct oh my yes yeah possessing the Gate of the enemy Paul said none of these things bother me for he was tied to an absolute Christ and every true achievement is tied to an absolute I've shared to the church about that young man quite a few years ago was getting ready to run in the Olympics and ripped I think it was his hamstring or something Achilles tendon something like that so bad that he was just done they said you're finished and and he was like I I am Olympian I'm going to win I'm going to do this and he come to that place in his life where he had trained all he could train and realized that that the coach that he had uh was not going to be able to take him as far as he wanted to go and so he goes applies to be trained by another Olympic level coach and from the very first moment that coach just starts telling him you you you don't have what it takes you're holding back I watch you run you're not giving your all you're you're holding back oh I'm as fast as everybody you're not as fast as a winner and he he just did it and the guy would be so angry he wanted to even strike his coach and his coach was just telling him quit doesn't sound like a very good quot coach does it quit I'm not quitting you already have no I haven't and then one day he was actually almost angry and he broke through and from that moment on the coach quit deriding him and told him this is the man I wanted to meet right amen I'm telling you my brother and sister let me put it just uh a little bit straightforward the Lord isn't interested in our excuses he's not interested in our own madeup limitations he wants us to run the race until we break through and when we break through we'll run the race like never before and we'll rise into Heavenly places and he'll be able to say that's the son that's the daughter that I called before the foundation of the world they're not giving me a reason why they can't they're standing here today saying I'm going to respond and I will prove that I am a Son of God hallelujah amen and every true achievement is tied to an absolute you don't need brothers or sisters that you not in a boastful way not in a carnal way you you just realize they're real prayer warriors they're just real solid people they're they're they're going to amen they're going to help the those around them they're going to press to the mark amen true achievement right not the best voice not the best looking not the best attendance not the best of anything but they have made the true achievement amen and it's God not them that shows it it's the Lord am you see the fact that they have an absolute and there's nothing on Earth we see in the critics of this message my brother and sister we see them still moving still doing their work but I tell you they are too late with the bride of Christ their words of negativity and their words that there's a better life out there fall on deaf ears because the bride of Christ knows where her achievement come from she knows who she is she knows that the word's been open to her and it's a living bloody lamb and she is not going to walk away she wants his name she wants his name more than she wants wealth or fame she wants him amen not a church somewhere not a certain this or a certain that she wants him and she's going to achieve that hallelujah amen tied to an absolute my absolute is the word and everybody else that's that's really born of the spirit their absolute is God's word I'm tied to it I laid my hands upon it amen maybe you'll just reach over tonight and just put your hand on your Bible I've laid my hands on the absolute amen it's here it's the truth I'm tied to it I laid my hands upon it and it took my place and I've identified myself with him he knew that uh he we knew that he promised to identify himself with us isn't that encouraging amen it's not just us saying we're Christians we want to be Christlike but it's Christ himself coming down saying I'm I'm willing to come and identify myself I'm willing to stand with you I'm willing to be seen and heard and let it show let it show Hallelujah we knew that he promised to identify himself with us now just read this real careful let's just slow down Paul calm down Paul calm down and it what's it we live in a day where they use all kinds of whatevers seen a little video clip some young girl doing the he they there the whatever and I thought my heart actually ACH might sound like I'm kind of making fun but my heart actually ate cuz here's a young woman you can just tell that she knows this is is not correct speech see there's confirmation she knows you know the eye darting and then goes into the the the they there whatever thing it's like what what's happened there's no absolute no absolute when you get an absolute you say you know what I'm going to be all that God created me to be God made me a man I will be a man if if he made me a woman I'll be a woman but most of all he made us Sons and Daughters of God and I'm going to be a son or a daughter amen none of this well we they they're the whatever stuff amen I laid my hands upon it you know what that is personal action you and I unction to a personal action and it holy spirit Jesus Christ took my place and I've identified myself with him amen we knew that he promised to identify himself with us and that brings genuine Faith sometimes I wished I could just block this out here let me you guys read that portion I'll block this portion out how many times do we I wished I had more faith I I this faith and this about faith and that about faith how about we just get in a position that we look at the word and say my Lord Jesus when he called me shed his blood for me amen and I committed my life to him it's not going to be me that makes a Rapture it's going to be him in me it's not my strength it's his strength it's not my Revelation it's his Revelation and there's nothing I can do it's all him and I don't even have faith enough for a Rapture but his faith in me is going to take me to a Rapture and when I come to that place I won't be able to go brother David we get on the other side I won't be able to say boy Brother David that last burst of faith I got no sir we're going to be standing over there like a bunch of bewildered pilgrims and said I'm here I made it Lord how did this happen it was you Lord amen because it's not our faith is his faith and his faith will produce oh oh thank you that brings genuine faith not your own faith his faith something that you don't control how many times are we like I want to go to these special meetings they they said that there they're going to be some Faith meetings you know like you're going to go there with a bucket and fill it up and go home sorry just go there and say Lord here I am just treat me any way you want Lord treat me any way you want Lord fill me up overflow father whatever you need I have no faith but see we promote and don't misunderstand me I'm not speaking down on that but we promote our faith we promote our faith and we ignore what he's trying to do to bring Faith up in us what is it it's a word it's a word it's Christ himself he's Faith he's the word that's coming up to give us an unction I I I won't go into it uh sister Jerry won't know what I'm talking about but she was there many years ago in Cloverdale amen I knew what it was to feel something Supernatural take place and walked out of that place and within four days God healed me my brother and sister I couldn't have told you that day oh God's healed me all I know is there was something flowed up through me I felt it and it was there and I'm sad to say by the time we got in a car and traveled home all the other circumstance of Life had slid that kind of to the backside until a few days later I was like I'm Healed I'm Healed you know what it was the Catalyst I say this in a natural sense brother bcll saying you know what communion is a good time to receive your healing and I said Lord I want to be healed that's all it took was that Paul's faith not even close I only had faith enough to say Lord I desire that that's where my faith stopped I didn't say I'm going to be healed in the name of Jesus Christ but his faith took that and brought it to a resting place and then carried it to fruition Allelujah he does it you don't control it he does it now notice then and then only when is the promise made to you not when we're saying I've got faith I've got faith I've got faith why don't we get right down and say Lord you said I believe it is here the evidence is proven the holy spirit's here and I am a son of of God and I just yield I just give myself Lord you know the old sign whose fool are you okay let's hurry along here see so in in sixth and seventh verses of Genesis 4 there the Lord speaks to Cain and ask him why are you wroth why is thou countenance Fallen if thou doest well thou sh uh and shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lith at the door I'm telling you that was as powerful of a of a evangelist type sermon as man can ever receive right there but you know where the thought of just how amazing grace is this is a son this is a son of Satan himself let's cut it right to the chase right there and the Lord says just do the right thing Son Of Satan he didn't use those words right but Son Of Satan Cain if you just do the right thing you will have eternal life is that not Amazing Grace that God would reach out to the very one that hated him tried to upset the whole Kingdom have a new plan and offers him here's the word here's the life just do the right thing and Cain knew what the right thing was but he sat there and there was already seeds planted there was already circumstance that was there imagine Cain sitting there going wait I can receive the same thing that that Abel did or this chance I can rise up and up and up and up to the sides of the north and actually be above this but it was already in him the seed had already been sown it had already sprouted was already coming into fruition it wasn't automatically that he was just cast down he had his choice God offered that to me Amazing Grace and here we are born in sin shaped in iniquity and every one of us is told the lie and God says just do the right thing I'm here to offer life just say yes and here's a seed in you and I that is crying out Lord I want to serve you Lord I want to do the right thing I want to have your Holy Spirit I want to have a a communion with you and yet maybe even in our own family they would say no that's fine talk about breaking your heart but God said I've got Grace this is why the word says that he would save everyone some people stumble over that well these people here they wouldn't do my brother and sister if if uh uh Cain had said you're right can can I go back lord and find a lamb can I come and kneel before you and and prostrate myself and offer this sacrifice he'd have eternal life but there was already something we can say predetermined we all understand predestination but my brother and sister there's the little caveat that shows that God's right there to offer life to those that he knows already have made their mind up no and he still says sincerely sincerely here's life that's right just receive it just receive it I want to I want to hurry up and close here amen so he's offering him eternal life amen and so to to Cain God's word the Lord's word was not the absolute that's right cuz when he says if you'll do the right thing if he'd took that is an absolute he' to submitted to it that's right and now I'm going to speak some harsh words we got way too many people around the message that say the messages they're absolute but they don't submit to it that's right their life is not a reflection of it they are reflection of a seed already planted now not all of that's bad don't misunderstand me sometimes these seeds that are planted oh you don't worship enough jump up on the pews and run scream shout oh you're too wild you're this you're that I remember a preacher one time in the message none of you have a prayer life how did he know that preaching to some of the finest solid Christians I've ever met in my life their whole life revolved around the word of God and this man had the boldness to declare you don't even have a prayer life what I'd like to know what was his prayer life yeah because you see he didn't encourage anybody he took faithful Christians and they walked out of the service at night and doubted they were even saved I don't think that's what God wants us to do he wants us to come face to face with our failure he wants us to come face to face with our shortcoming he wants us to come face to face and when the word is there my brother and sister and it speaks to us that we have an unction inside of us the holy spirit that says yes Lord yes Lord I I I want to repent from that I want to come closer to you I want your life Lord More Than This Very life and when we do that God what's he doing he's coaxing us he's bringing us in and you say well brother Paul okay that would be but my brother and sister it's got to start with the word being the absolute it wasn't with Cain Cain was under another influence he had another absolute you know what it was it was Beauty not bloody right it was beautiful amen there's no culture in a bloody lamb absolutely no culture at all now look I I I don't recommend you guys do this sometimes I I dive into things trying to follow through a thought but my brother and sister we're living in a world today the driving force in a modern church it's not the Holy Ghost it's culture and where culture is at there's no blood kide of the altar not a drop of blood not a drop he would attracted everyone that wanted a beautiful altar Abel side bloody bloody amen it's not going to attract culture it's going to attract those that have an absolute amen so you look at that what it is I want you to just kind of bump along through some of this you see how the word right before our eyes as it would be in 1 John 37-13 verse2 actually is what we're searching for not as Cain who was of that Wicked one so clearly identified that Spirit of culture that that beautiful offering the sincerity still had a wicked Spirit behind it create in me Lord create in me tonight Lord a clean heart right I don't want to speak all the right words and have a heart that is the heart that is considered Wicked amen now let me just Hebrews 11 and4 we know that scripture amen uh we just bump along here just real quick you know I I really I just find that very powerful verse seven you know if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted how powerful that is it's right there before him he could just make the decision I want to change I want to have a different understanding I want to have a revelation of you amen I look at this amen I think I've already spoken all of this here just in a out of order not out of order different placing I hope it wasn't out order Amen Let our cry be I need more of you Lord let our cry recognize the spirit because Cain come with such an arrogant Spirit he was certain his offering would receive accolades he was sure that the Lord would go Man Cain all that you've done and you've made this so beautiful and here's his brother he's over here with just a bloody lamb I mean after all that's kind of disgusting that Bloody lamb I don't think he had a shay knife or whatever the model day were just a nice clean little cut imagine so committed and such a type I give this to you Lord this I offer to you my best not Second Chance not second class and as he's doing this the blood just as it was in the temple and the Tabernacle the blood flying up and covering Lord I want to bring you a bloody lamb today I want to bring you my most sincere offering I want the blood all over me Lord let it be splattered on me let it run from my hands be on my face my head my feet amen amen hallelujah hallelujah see when we just cry isn't that what the word says just cry out his name when we just cry it don't have to be beautiful it has to be sincere amen let's just stand sister VI if you would come musicians Allelujah had some other things here but I think I pretty much covered it I trust this I don't know if it really would be even called preaching tonight but it something was on my heart I just needed to get it off how amazing is his grace much more amazing than sometimes I believe we recognize and act upon because we still make our mistakes we still start to drift away a little bit what does he do he doesn't say well I'll just sit here and watch them till they hit the ditch no sir he calls us back and when we are weak he is strong and when we're distracted he comes to get our attention every aspect that we can see in our life we'd say well I I sin today I sin [Music] today go back to the word repent from the action but go back to the word and he says you're sinless you can't tell me that's not Amazing Grace in the course of you just saying forgive me Lord he wipes it all away and allows us let's just bring it right here today allows us to come in the house of God tonight not under condemnation but we can come here tonight saying I know that as simple as that was it's under the blood and I can be in Liberty tonight and Worship the Lord that is amazing grace amen the book isn't growing my brothers and sisters with all of the accusation amen the the book's not growing the book is blank we are perfect in him Hallelujah 994 brother Gideon Amen brother Alex my voice is dying on me please a me in Grace how sweet the that see oh a richet like me oh I want was lost but now I'm found I was
