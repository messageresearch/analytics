suffering that's when the words really digested that's when it really becomes bitter in your stomach that's when you're really manifesting Christ in flesh amen we're thankful for revelation but the revelation will be digested amen then it becomes real then it becomes men manifest and then it becomes a word made flesh as God ordained it to be in this hour himself in bride form amen we're thankful for this amen as you're seated here I'm just thankful to be in the house of the Lord and then again I'm thankful to be in the house of the Lord amen I'm glad to be in the house aren't you really Chris I'm glad we have one place of worship one place where he placed his name outside of that you're not worshiping Christ unless you're in that place you've got to be in that place and that's by God's grace through faith he brings us into that place so thankful that he ordained that to the elect there's nothing we can do we can boast of nothing as humans we have no ability we have nothing we can do to serve the Lord nor service people outside of Christ in you amen so we're thankful for this amen I want to read a couple things here before thank you the musicians god bless you I wonder you a couple things here and I won't try to be long this morning just I want to start kind of a if it's the lord's will Sal ittle bit of a series I'll give you my title but I'm not gonna give you my subject yet but I want to title this here we stand I started the title it here I stand but it is I stand if you can take it and it is an individual affair so you just apply it to yourself that here we the broad eov Christ the bride who is Christ who has not divided but one under the blood we are one under the token we have the same life we have the same position I say position in Christ but different positions in that body amen so we know that God is among us we know that Christ is among us so I title this here we stand that's maybe part one I have several parts to that I'd like to take but but so we will just give you my subject here in just a moment but in the message ashamed brother Branham says he starts at paragraph 235 if you want to look at it you can look at that but in the message that shamed he said he started to sing that song you know where he leads me I'll follow and he starts to sing that portion where he said I'll go with him through the judgement and and the Prophet said as he said that he says in the I'll go with him through the judgment he says now he said that's what's going on right now he says now that's what's going on right now he is judging us now this isn't the white throne judgment although he justice from the throne hallelujah but this isn't the white throne and we know that the bride will won't be stood standing at the white throne being judged she has no judgment at the white throne judgment she is in the throne judging she's a part of the throne she's in God he's in Christ she's now been in fact st. John 5:24 said we've already been judged in him there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus amen Romans 8:1 so and then st. John 5:24 we can you know what I'm referring to there and Ephesians already one one said were already accepted in the beloved that that's he elected were already accepted chosen in him before the foundation of the world who's going to confirm that how do you know that is confirmed by the token is confirmed by the Holy Ghost the person of Christ in you not being necessary the anointing we have to have the anointing the anointing has to fall upon that seed but that brings forth a person because the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself to come right down and perfection again back to the word amen the word itself so so the life in you will man fess the promise word for the season and the hour and the time you're gonna have an ear you do have an ear to receive that word to hear that word amen so we thank God for the mercy that he's given us amen so then in the message in the message invisible Union now I have you probably saw me I don't you saw me it doesn't really matter if you did or not but I have several books with me that's because my printer is dead and and then I'm going back to the old school brother Paul I'm sorry you know we carried heavy books no I'm not really not that bad but anyway but I'd have a few things I want to refer to and and I have woke up in the middle of the night and thought my printer wasn't dead but my ink was dead and I didn't have printer ink so I've been waiting for a Costco to open up there there the photo department so I could get a refill and so it caught me anyway I just didn't worry about it went back to sleep after about two hours awake but anyway so so a minute I mean many things you know brother Paul knows any Minister know than me I just woke up and things begin to just open up I just couldn't get away from this message this morning and things just kept opening up to me so I had to go quickly look at it and find it and write it now where it is it where is it so we've we found it now on the message invisible union of the bride he says Lord I'm very thankful or I'm very thankful I'm very thankful Thanksgiving to you Lord for natural food yet not that but Lord the end time is here I'm thankful for this spiritual food Lord the spiritual food of the seven seals was promised to be opened you say that'll be something different no no you can't add one word it's already in there in where you say well wasn't written but it was in there it was in someone it was sealed in someone and John typed the bride a man so it was there and it was in the word it's in the written word it just wasn't written in Revelations 10 when John saw it said seal up what but brother about watch how he says this you can't add one word it's already in there just kid Alleluia it's just hid and if something hit he has the time to manifest or reveal it is that right now we're coming into the promised word for the hour okay then he says he it's already in there just hid it's sealed hallelujah it's sealed he said how many understands that Amen Congress say have we say Amen you say well that's a mystery we'll come forth oh no remember how I said another place those seven thunders be given to some man brother branham noises and all and will be giving us a man it's already in there it's written in there it's just hid he said he used to think it was something outside the book he said you can't God can't do that it's it's hid in the book all right so he says it's already read you can't add one word to it or take one word from it and dare anyone to do it better not all right don't add your thinking no and add your intellectual thinking don't try to figure things out just open up to God let him God reveal it to you as you have need of it that's what he said he would do not leaving his bride without revelation he said you'd the just shall live by faith and faith is a revelation he said it's already in there it's just got thoughts what he said it's already in there hid it's just got to be revealed in the last day amen all right then on paradigm BAM page 53 he's 52 he said some of you people that really believe this something revealed what's the message of the seventh angel something's revealed that's been hid is that right loose ends have been revealed it's a capping off time brother sister hope you understand that there's a capping off time happening the seven seals opened amen that's the completion all right we're not looking for another message to come we have the message to rapture the bride this is what he says right here some of you people that really believe that says be the truth we're entering another age we're entering the rapture age he says now the church he says he sailed this I'll save time here let me just get we're entering the rapture age he said it's got to get worse he said there's got to be something set for a church can't go like this he said all right he said it's got to be something and it's moving right now friend not it will it is it's moving right now friend it's on the move is on for the any bride here it moves on for the bride all right not another how many believe this and we're entering into another age not another not us not an eighth Church age another age he's called that the dispensational change it's a bride age Amen all right he's what they do he's come forth to do something this a child ate the the Seventh Seal opened for nothing he's doing something and it's happening and it's being revealed and the end of the move is on for the bride that's the truth he said that's thus saith the Lord move up now you consecrated Christians and want your record to find out your record move up now all right all right we'll just set that aside for a few moments all right now in the message that I know I'm getting to my scripture just hold on and the message serves is this the time I'm laying this foundation for you here serves is this the time he said now no I'll read my scripture first pardon me okay I want you to turn me to revelations chapter 1 and then revelations 10 those only two things if you'll stand with me and then I've got some other scriptures Lord willing to pass on amen and I appreciated the message Wednesday night brother Chris I mean that wasn't really Chris that was the Lord amen I believe that with all my heart God has by mercy by grace bridged a chasm that we couldn't get across is that right and he's asked you to walk it and the move is on for the bride all right so he's did that already our kinsman paid the price took the penalty of sin took it in his body redeemed his bride then he brought out a great thing which I want to bring out this morning there had to be a final stage of redemption there had to be a finished redemption and that was the claiming of the book what was in the book amen so let me just say to you revelation 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come amen all right now so we just will have to go to Revelation chapter 1 let's just start with verse 10 quite a bit of reading here but I was in the spirit and brother Paul has been speaking of this I'm it was in the spirit in the spirit are we in the spirit brother brought the scripture said he that has joined into the unto the joined unto the Lord is one spirit amen that's right that's right it's one thing to have that but to be in it's another thing amen we're talking with the little spirit we're talking about something in the soul you didn't put there it's quickened I was in the spirit John speaking type of the bride I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and we've had that we've had absolutely a sign in the heavens announcing this dispensational change here alright I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet not trumpets trumpet saying I was alpha I am Alpha and Omega the first and last you know the Prophet said a masterpiece they said she the bride is also Alpha and Omega why because she was in him before the foundation of the world to be manifested in her age this is the time bride moves on I may know we're entering the bride this is bride age he said the rapture age is the bride age all right so he said I often Omega the first to last what they'll see us write in a book a record and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia and Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum and unto Thyatira Sardis unto Philadelphia and unto Laodicea now remember this book right here the book of Revelation were taught is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ the whole Bible is a complete revelation but this book here completes the revelation without the written the writing of this book there'd be no completion without the revealing of this book there's no completion so it's the revelation of Jesus Christ all right now he said and I didn't say that brother Branham said it was a complete revelation of Jesus Christ and I turned to see the boys here was the sound of a device the sound of a trumpet and I turned to see it you mean you could see a voice the bride can and I turned to see the voice to speak with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to the foot and a Girt about the paps like a like a woman with a girdle a golden girdle that also is a type of Judge all right he said and and he said and his hips Kuzmin out and his gird golden girl his head and his hairs were white like snow and we know what that means judges down to white wig when they with the judgment and his hairs were white so I said in some other age we're living here in this hour he said his head and his hairs were white like wool white as snow his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass that burned in the furnace and his voice was as a sound of many waters brother Brown prayed that there would be thousands of lived voices thundering out the voice of God amen and there is and he had NC and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword amen brother Brown said like out of God's mouth to Moses mouth amen he said and we know that the that says the Kings sword fit the hand of the prophet he said it fit my hand perfectly a sharp two-edged sword this countenance was like at the Sun the Sun you know revelations a book of symbols we have the Sun shining in its strength what was shining in his strength his face his countenance amen all right and said and his right any late and when I saw him Oh hallelujah hallelujah wonder how many have seen him brother Branham says our Lord up there and quickening power lets us see his coming he said he said I'd when I seen him I fell at his feet as dead good place to start it's the only place to start Jesus had to start there before he went to Calvary he started it in Gethsemane and there that was appointed unto me I was in him then I died right there hallelujah too old man why because I died to him today I couldn't have done that unless I was in him dying right then those counted to leave I to pay tithes in Abraham it's accounted to you and I to have died in Gethsemane I was identified right there what would I do if I come down here in this day I'd have to fulfill in manifestation what was done then I would die out complete itself so when I saw him I laid on the I laid John said when I saw him I fell at his feet is dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not Oh hallelujah fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death and I went with him I died I was pierced with him I went with him I went with him to hell and my sin was put on the head of that devil and right there I conquered that death hell in the grave and took it off the side right there and raised up victorious and how do I know I have the very life of that blood living in me now showing like resurrected when he resurrected showing that I have a body waiting and I don't care where this body goes I've already dead to this old man and no matter what happens to this I will rise again hallelujah Amen all right so he said he said so I the keys of hell and death now at revelation 10 I know it's a lot of reading but you'll understand revelations 10 verse 1 and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud here we find him in Revelations one here is revelations 10 clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the Sun I wonder if it could be the S Oh N I wonder if revelations 1 if that wasn't his countenance was as the Sun som all right he said sun shining in his strength we don't have strength is his strength all right so he said his face is aware the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand glory you ever get the revelation of who you are and he had in his hand a little book open not closed open romance said it was closing in the fifth chapter open in the 10th all right he said any and he had in his little in his hand a little book a little book open and I wonder well we'll see what he said and he set his right foot upon the sea his left foot on the earth and crowd with a loud voice as when a lion roared a brother Ram said when the lion roars everything shuts up heaven was silenced is that right but brother Ram said those seven thunders didn't utter from heaven they under the earth Amen all right all right and he said and he added with a loud voice as when a lion roars Amen ewa beetles stopped everything the giraffe quit winning and all this you know everything shuts up he said I ought to because the lion spoke all right he said now he said other and he the lion roar and when he had cried seven thunders brother Ram said those seven thunders uttered their voices with this revelation contained in those seals is that right and it would absolutely turn the heart of the bride to the original faith it literally he said turn the heart of the bride to the faith that revelation so something in this that pertains to you and I and it couldn't be opened unless he thundered or he roared one thunder prophet said and seven messages and then you question it about the seventh seal being opened allelujah are with me I don't want to lose you here all right he said he said now he said and what is the seventh it's him it's him he brings us to himself we don't come on her own he comes to receive us we don't come on her own amen something's happening and the Prophet said the seven seals the mystery of his coming and the Prophet said the moves on for the bride so what's happening he saw her marching he saw her in step with the word and every step got a little higher just like inna who it's who is Enoch walking with she was the seventh from Adam who's the bride walking with then we'll have to take rapture because this is the rapture age and the raptures are to begun in US and if he begun in you he that has begun a good work will finish it so there you go and the rapture is begun it's already opened up if you're sealed in Christ and win at that little room you've already done raptured you just Scout your body's got to catch up with it and it'll take the revelation on top of Revelation faith on top of faith word on top of word to bring you there because this message that promised said it's for the going home of the bride it's not for another person it's for the going home of the bride because the bride is that person they are the same self person so what is the bride here in her in her manifesting her glory which is his glory what's she doing she's revealing the son of man again it's not here he her it's here ye him right hallelujah all right you may be seated sorry I get to preach and I love you Sandin but that's all right you can stand you want to stand listen to the word sand all right in the message services this a time now if I don't preach the way you like it then you just you just listen for a while and give me grace all right all right now we're gonna see something in this services it's the time I want to make this mention now there's only one thing left that's the seven thunders that we don't know and it would have not thundered in vain God don't do something just to be playing we play an act silly but not God everything with God is J&A it he doesn't just fool he doesn't kid he means what he says and he says nothing unless there's something meaning to it the seven thunders now notice he said and seven thunders right in the revelation here of Jesus Christ is some mystery the seven thunders here right in the revelation of Jesus Christ he's referring to this right here this book of revelations because it's the revelation of Jesus Christ given to his servant John to write is that right okay he said there's something he said he said there's this he said let me read it again and seven thunders right in the revelation here of Jesus Christ as some mystery does not the Bible say this is the revelation of Jesus Christ well there is some hidden mystery then of it some hidden mystery of what the revelation of Jesus Christ remember the Prophet said he's not complete without you not Co MP le te complete without you now Jesus when he come to this earth was the fullness of the Godhead bodily in one man is that right then you and I were in him then if we're bride we are in him then are you with me but that portion had there was still a mystery just like Eve was an atom a mystery until revealed a man she was a hidden mystery in the revelation of Adam she was a midden mystery of that revelation and Adam was not completely manifested until that time that she was revealed that was the capping of the creation and where did it happen not under the sixth day it happened under the seventh day that right there she was revealing Adam the full complete revelation of Adam it was a hidden mystery and Adam there's something hidden in this revelation of Jesus Christ that he said a hidden mystery of it what is it the seven thunders have it hallelujah the seven thunders have it something the seven thunders uttered was uttered and John heard it and he understood what it said and he was going to write about it but the word said seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel that mystery would be finished then there's a hidden mystery of that revelation and here we are and the Prophet said Christ revealed in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing and if it's complete then what's to follow a body change glory to God that's what takes us there without that brother Brown said but at John wept because if he hadn't have taken that book if he hadn't revealed those names if he hadn't have showed what he redeemed and claimed what he redeemed there's no marriage there's no wedding supper there's that the whole creations lost he had to take that book because he already our kinsman redeemed it are you with me he redeemed it he paid the penalty for it he went to Calvary for it he bridge the chasm for you and I and it's through the blood but unless you come through the blood and if you've come to the blood you're in the spirit if you come to the blood you're in Christ and if you come to the blood you've identified to be his seed you are identified to be his germ of life you are identified to be his own you're identified you're identified by that confirmation you're identified by Christ himself now Abraham's say well Abraham believe by faith yes but he had to have a confirmation of his faith and the token is that confirmation brother Branham said God expects us to display the token God expects us he said when you must have the token on display God's requirement is the token and the token and you identifies that you and Christ are one it's not like me and my wife I could be in one room see me in another you say you're one with your wife I see you but I'll see my wife but that's not so with Jesus Christ and his bride if you see her you see your husband if you see the husband you're gonna see the bride today hallelujah praise the Lord I get a little excited forgive me but this is something excited about those seven thunders hold that mystery something a hidden mystery in the revelation of Jesus Christ was kept secret sealed up concealed until this hour when is something sealed is kept silent that's what revelations 8:1 denoted what was coming forth and revelation was that mystery no wonder the devil so I I add now I'm gonna say it no wonder is because it's the spirit we're not dealing with people no wonder the devil hates that revelation of the seventh seal because it cats the bride off hallelujah without that we're be no rapture because he had it himself he had to take the book himself he had to lay claim to what he redeemed himself glory to God this is some old man's ideas this is what separates the bride from the rest this is what separates the bride from foolish virgin they're all good people we're not talking about good people we're talking about revelation of the word which is the evidence that you're in there and if you have a true revelation it's going to be vindicated by this word the thing that God will say seed will never do is deny this or unbeliev this word but they will see the word foolish virgin had enough oil to make sanctification but they didn't have enough oil to go in the rapture they didn't have any oil to go in the rapture they missed the wedding they missed the marriage the brides gone into the marriage and here she is and the foolish virgins still wondered whether it's opened or not we're in an invisible union people and there's a you there's a there's a maturing under that Union because this arising of the Sun it's delaying in the presence of the Sun it's a marriage and that marriage brings conception the purpose of that union was conception and the conception is the original life the original seed the original life is what the bride bearing she's revealing Christ to the people hallelujah hallelujah and that wasn't a public show that's not known to the public that's inside of a little room but it's declared outwardly by a lived life for the aged this is not the Pentecostal message that's good we believe that you had to come through the Pentecost but brother Branham said this isn't the Pentecostal message any cost represented that again he said this is for the bride this is where they going home of the bride how many believe that we've entered a raptured age hallelujah seven thunders have it for John was about to write the voice came from heaven said don't write it but seal it up but it's got to be revealed glory to God hallelujah and that's what the union's about it's revealed but God kept it a secret why because he would reveal it to his children his own and anything that come by revelation doesn't vindicate this word is not of God it has to be line up with the word I don't care how anointed you are okay how much you can shout how much you can prophesy if that thing's off the word it's not of God you say that's party powerful brother yeah it's powerful but it separates the tear from the wheat because this this little bride won't leave the word she can't leave the word she is the word she can't be to see because she is the word and anything that comes outside of that word is not of God I don't care if it's 99.99% truth listen the terror and the we can both be anointed in their spirit the spirit controls the body but the soul controls the spirit are you with me they can be anointed and that insight and that soul can use that spirit to cast out devils speak in tongues and prophesy are you with me beylin prophesy wasn't wrong Balaam's teaching was wrong he said we're all one we're not all one we're all the same people we ought to just come together where we're all invited to a feast you oughta just all assemble together and brother Graham said God hated that and he never did forgive Israel for that because you're a separated people unto Christ himself what separates the word the people we're not separating the word separates God has bride has one husband and that focus her husband is his her focus she only has one focus one person to please in this hour are you with me I'm talking about the bride the whole male and female but then God wrote in his word that a woman will be subject to her husband under obedience not a ruler not a knot of like a doormat but under the word what for all of you husbands that can't rule your homes by the word bring it out of the word and sweetness bring it of the word and love bring it out of the word on token bring your house under the word and quit bowing to these idols of fear afraid of what she's gonna do afraid of her actions ah I kind of hit a sore point but that's the truth you bout anything outside of that word and come between you and that word as an idol and Satan uses fear to get you to do it boy oh boy if that's isn't his one of his greatest tactics if fear but we just read here when I saw him I fell at his feet is dead I lost sight of myself and raced up under his power said fear not I'm the first and the last and I'm right here right now and I'm gonna take you all the way in I'm gonna take you all the way to that body change because you've got the you've got the reality you've got the confirmation you have the very assuring since I'd of you right now that what I'd begun I will finish what are you afraid about I don't know how far I won't get very far here this morning all right let's go to revelations five hey men my subject brides judgment my subject is the bride's judgment well you say brother Davis she doesn't stand B I'm not talking about the white throne I'm talking about judgment now I want you to look into the open book and see how God judges the bride because we've had a judge come forth that wasn't just some make-believe thing as some storing we found out in 63 there was the divine happening and it was identified Amen we'll get into that as we go right through here as the Lord will help us alright revelations five and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and who to loose loose means to free or set free the seals thereof and no man in heaven or in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I went much because no man was found worthy to open to read the book and neither to look thereon and one of the elders which said to me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David he's both root and offspring remember are you with me alright the Lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed to open the book and to loose open and loose other words there's something behind those seals that have to be revealed and in order to do it those seals have got to be loosed and brother Graham said he is those seals then what are the revelation of those seals but the revelation of Christ there you are you talk about the bride being free you're talking about brides judgment you talk about where we stand amen brother Brown said this Christ the mystery of God revealed let me just go there real quick on paragraph 503 in Christ's a mystery I'll just read this one a little portion first don't know how far we'll get but all this mystery is revealed only as he promised to his bride hell is against this truth you think you you think you have problems wait till it gets with you it's a little more maturity about it a little more open a little more open watch the devil raised up against the revelation well who do you think you are you're some special person yes I no I am but I'm special in his sight not special as a human special in him it's not my working it's his working it's his revealing it's the unveiling of himself the headstone in me that began as a cornerstone that he would build this church on but here in the end it's a headstone amen are you with me it's a stumbling stone to what is the revelation the stone the rock because he said behold I lay in Zion a cornerstone brother Branham was coming out of that vision and on the message serves this the time member he referred to the vision he had of those angels and he said I come out of that vision and and it kept referring to me look at look it and then behold he lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone is that right I lay in Zion I lay who laid it jesus said to Peter upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against it and the cornerstone becomes the head of the corner and it's all the doing of the Lord and it's glorious in whose eyes amen whose it's our eyes the bride's eyes is glorious because now he comes forth revealing the head which is the same as the corner but I'll build my church upon the revelation of myself and the gates of hell and Satan makes him so mad because the gates of Hell can't prevail against it amen so he kept it as mystery sealed up and where was a sealed in John he said he would lay it there is that right he would lay it in his bride is that right okay then where was the seal where is it sealed today you tell me where it's unveiled and I'll tell you where it's sealed because the seals been broken Christ has identified himself in you you are identified in him that isn't everybody that's to you here I stand here we the bride stand in that revelation he said it's this mysteries only revealed as he promised to his bride held us against the truth of the revelation of this mystery but the bride standing on it that's her stand hallelujah why do you hunger thirst Church why do you thirst it's a father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares in the world you let some pastor you let somebody else get it out of you when you know way down in your heart you better thank God that it's way down in your heart that you want that more than anything it ought to mean more and everything to you than houses lands money's jobs whatever it may be if you're still little down and wrong that you just need to die and Paul said I die daily we have to die we have to die to that we have to die to what people think we have to die to ourselves and that's the greatest thing you have to overcome is yourself and Jesus overcame himself father fit me please if you let this cup pass but nevertheless not my will but thy will be done and there he reconciled himself and gave himself over and there he died hallelujah my what's that mean to you and I I was with him then if brother Branham in Van Daan se Jun Bailey who God mighty God unveiled and all those message could say I was identified in Moses and to be a be a be a United States citizen I was identified with Washington when he went across to be a Christian I had to be identified I was identified with Enoch I was identified with Abel when he offered that rifice my revelation and God made a chain made the difference and he said it's Revelation that's the evidence not your religion not your feeling it's the revelation of the word and that expresses itself through flesh and stays with the word and will seed and receive the word for the season and that's not a thing you do about it despite yourself God does that why because our kinsman redeemer took our sin in his body and paid the penalty of sin and bridged away from there to Calcutta to rapture right into the Millennium right into the new city and said he'd come in this hour and reveal it and cap the whole revelation of himself off now we see the promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship coming in his bride going in her do we see it or don't we see it he said you see it he said he did he see he's now you see the seals when he was in his media Tara work back there redeeming through the ages but what was the message of the hour the seventh seal what was the seventh seal to do unveil that hidden word amen are you with me there had to be a hidden self hidden thing hidden in the revelation of himself here that had become expressed and had to be manifested you see why Satan had to hates this message for the hour for the time do you realize we're recognizing our day and it's message what's this we're waiting on us to get out of the way so two witnesses can come there under that seventh trumpet which is the same as the seventh seal and unveil to them what they missed and bring them right up to date and show them there that nation just it's a perfect type of Ruth and Naomi perfectly brother Chris perfectly here's a redeemer made a public that I read email me and I read it Ruth is my bride through that shoe Don among those elders and said it's done and you're witnesses and they said let his blood be upon us is that right but there was a few there about nine brother Bram said they caught the message 12 besides them see and a few other people about 120 that were in the upper room but 3,000 hurt them speak the truth in a new tongue what they have an ear to hear was that the promised word for the day who was speaking it war was he hid Paul Saul why are you persecuting me all right what does he do down here today the brides the word that's why she can't be deceived you say you're just boasting let me boast in him then let me tell you what he said about me let me tell you what he said he's already judged me absolutely in him sinless he's already took pain Ortiz he already come right down on Sunset Mountain identified himself brother Ram said a camera could take took the picture like a picture like a photograph and turned it to the right who do you see it's him very one I saw as a child out there praying for my daddy and he comes right back around here at the end and says see it was this the same person and brother Brown see he's come again x1 9 through 11 how many saw it not very many but is that my business and yours no just preach the truth are we going to rear approach for are we going to be misunderstood is it gonna be bring persecution you better believe it you ought to thank God for that because you're able to bear in your own body the sufferings every day but you need to die daily we need to deny yourself daily you need to take up your cross and daily you've got to keep yourself dead you've got to keep yourself off a high horse you've just got you have one purpose live the promise for the hour a man is that right and who's living it yeah well it isn't David that's for sure David's always arguing against this every day against what against the revelation he has his opinion but I'm taking his opinion because when you're dead to yourself then why listen to a dead man and you every one of you if you're believers in Christ are facing that every single day you trying to reason you away from the word cast down reasoning we don't let reasoning become an idol we don't reason with nothing if God said if that settles it you believe it you take him at his word and you just give it a right mental attitude and place it like that and God will reveal it and right when he does it that's it speak the revelation and go forward we speak faith and go forward let's speak our own thoughts we speak the mind of God and go forward amen so now take it back to Ruth now Ruth for and we'll just see how far we can go here I don't have chronic kind of not running out yet but we'll be long Ruth he did the work of the kinsman he said he performed he said formed that he performed the part of a kinsman I may believe it formed that part you don't believe that you got to start at the beginning yet you got to believe that amen amen is that right but we're talking about what the kinsman performed it for hallelujah you'd realize that that right there at Calvary right there the works were finished the work brother Bram said the work was finished work of what salvation the work of healing there it was worked you don't have produce something to get anything to work just accept it brother Bram said concerning healing he said you don't even have to pray just believe what God did for you just give it a right mental attitude by the end then the revelation of the word in your soul just give it a right place a right mental attitude in the spirit realm hold that word before you and what does it have to be your creation has to obey the create or see the battle we get so taken up and thinking the battle between me and somebody else listen the battle between God and Satan not between this man that man this woman that woman me me me no no that's not it at all if we can separate the individual from the problem it's not the individual I'm no different than anyone else I'm a man but that revelation determines the difference that revelation of what the word for the season amen that's what Satan's against but what do we recognize it as is that gonna stop us is that gonna let us compromise with the word no we're gonna keep walking right on walk in the truth doesn't matter what well this one don't like it and this one don't like it and I didn't get praise from this one and nobody said thank you and you're not dead yet we need to die well you may be dead but you need to die too that don't give it place because you have a word for it where's your absolute it's your head where's your husband in the little room where's your husband manifested inside and the inside of the inside you wonder why brother Bram said bolt at the inside of the inside after those seals open the inside of the inside because you can lay under the anointing of the Holy Spirit in your spirit and do the and if you're a cocklebur on the inside of the inside you'll live a cocklebur life anointed by the spirit the true Holy Spirit you'll live from that life you say that's not right then you haven't gotten the message because that profit tells it more than one place but you watch how that loosen was controlled after you say I don't believe in dates well does something happened in 63 that turned the corner I believe everything the Prophet said but watch it mature watch what he said mature I'll take what he said back here I can't take what he says appear watch out amen see because watch it mature things change because loose ends were taken care of loose ends in serpents eat loose ends and who's miss Kenzi loose ends and marriage and divorce loose and internal security brought it to a full revelation what for the taking home of his bride hey all I just love the Lord he just kept that so secret he that I'll just I'll I'll show my bride my love I'll just keep it away from the world I would even make it publicly known I'll just come in the time I come she'll know it and she'll come in union with me that sounds pretty radical it's not radical it's a love affair this is not a duty affair this isn't preaching the word I'm not telling up preaching cuz I got duty I'm called yes but I love him and I'd love to tell about him well you say don't you know that you offended the Pharisees Jesus when you said those words says let me say some more don't you realize you offended the seventy when you said let me offend Oh are you gonna go are you gonna go also don't you think that brother branham don't you think that the Lord spoke through him and things to make people wonder and ponder wonder about it well he said this over here even I've even gave a quote about two or three sermons back he even makes it look a little shady the Lord does his works will make it he said the Lord will make things a little shady so that people can't get it see our God who's he making himself known to there's no question inside the inside that the little bride you're born of the Spirit of God you're one with him and you're not gonna go out here and try to produce some made-up works affair you're not gonna have some denominational spirit hanging around you you're not gonna have all this stuff out here it's the work of God and he's in our presence and we see him praise the Lord all right now all right let's see how far we can go Ruth chapter 4:13 and so boaz took ruth now i've started on verse chapter 5 I'm gonna come back to that right here so boaz took ruth hold that place go back to revelations 5 and we know the marriage if you have any questions about the marriage come go back to proving his word right before his leaving the earth he placed that marriage perfectly in its order brother Bram did God did through that prophet we're not going to a marriage he said we're going to a wedding supper the son of man unites the revealing of the son of man not the sign of the son of man the revealing of himself himself not pointing to it but himself there's your third pull the opening of himself in you amen all right revelations chapter 5 now where'd we stop her okay we oh yeah verse five okay and he saith unto me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and loosed the seven not six seven seals thereof I don't believe they're open well they are no matter what you believe or not I'm apart I'm the mystery of the seventh seal if that seventh seal wasn't opened we wouldn't know our position that book wouldn't have been open that mystery would have been sealed up yet because unless God thundered out you and I missed it Amen now that's a very broad statement but that's still the truth amen God spoke God revealed God opened our Savior opened but income as a corner now it came as a head it's this revelation that caps the bride it seals it alright because it's a revelation of himself not another and it's not just a partial it is a complete revelation of himself hallelujah alright so now this say you say brother David you're just too deep no you're just not you just need to get some revelation because the simplicity lays in Revelation not in your mental conception of it let God reveal that word to you and you'll see it's so simple you wonder how you missed it you missed it because you're trying to figure it out intellectually and you'll never get it that's how simple God becomes all right revelations 5 again now I get so caught up on these little topics I got it I'm spreading my time real thin right now all right behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the lion had prevailed hath prevailed that means he overcame he wrestled and overcome all right to open the book and loose the seven seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and what what was the seventh seal sealing the book so when he judges his bride remember that remember the white throne judgment the books were opened and another book that's the white throne where's the third one right here revelations 10 they're not going out to be judged God's already identified us in him the book he took the book he loosed the record and what is his judgment you are me I wish I could say that the way I feel it way I know it she is him same person he said same word I'm husband your bride we're facing Eden now with a masterpiece family time to go right back to Eden glory to God we broke the cycle brother Paul this cycle been broken all right watch what he says here he said I he said and beheld and lo in the midst as roll in the four beasts and the myths the elders stood a lamb the Word made flesh it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes and are the seven spirits of God sent forth and all the earth and he came oh let me read it again and he came and he came what the sign tell us on sunset Mountain the fulfilling of prophecy brother Graham said it's a fulfilling a prophecy he came to forerun that under the under the commission like John the Baptist he was sent to forerun that then the corner was turned and he positioned us in the land then Joshua there right hallelujah amen what did Moses for run you could say he took all that way he formed the very opening of the word they came back with the evidence that spirit never left went right over to Joshua and Joshua type of the Holy Ghost absolutely come forth and began to reveal what Moses said and what Moses sent and and Wade signed it you're going in you're going in this land is given to you it's already promised Joshua and Caleb said we're more than conquerors let it go up at once and possess it because God gave it to us booyah hallelujah all right so he said and again stood a lamb it had been slain having seven horns seven eyes and he came and he came and took the book ruth 4:13 and boaz took ruth and she was his wife you say where do you get that from because brother Branham said that little book was the bride book and the bride book is the record of eternal life this is the only record first John five ten through 12 he that hath the son and this is the record that he have given to us eternal life and this record is in his son and he that hath the son half life he that hath not the son hath not life so what's the record revealing his own life bride you're judged glory eat the book then what are you afraid of it for eat it go to the Angels said give me the book I have a right to that book it's a marriage certificate I'm his wife give me the book eat it up and I mouth will be sweet as honey in Revelation always is you've said hear me in the church right now get revelation to say praise the Lord yeah that's right sweet but then when you go to eat it and it has to drop into the belly and it begins to be digested then you're gonna prophesy again when it gets down to that digestion that's rough because now it's against your flesh now it's against your reasoning now it's against what others think now it's this now that reproach and persecution but you'll have to bear the same thing he did because you and him are one unless it gets into that belly then you're really one hallelujah you think troubles and struggles and all this what would be what would mean oh praise the Lord for it cuz without that you can't know him you can't manifest him you're you're up at night and you're struggling you're this you're that you're tore up why because you heard something that just oh Lord I wish I could see that oh god help me to see that why do I did this way why do I speak it this way Oh Lord this and that you know what I mean you're just digesting the food is all that was another message I titled it's got to be digested now you got portion of it alright okay I have a lot of portions when I preach any may he took the book can we gather that in and he took Ruth took Ruth and he and she was his wife not like a union to me and he went in done to her I hope you're reading and he went in done to her and she did what conceived what did the prophets say go back to Christ the mystery of God revealed I don't have time to read it go back there and see what he said she's pregnant her womb was had predestinated womb only to receive the german life because that seed was planted in there to receive that germ and that germ was you before the foundation of the world and that German that was you before the foundation world finds you today praise the Lord praise the Lord amen and he took the book and when it conceived and she Barisan what is the conception his own life you have no other identity that makes you become the very Church of the Living God the very body of himself in flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone how does this flesh become his flesh brother Branham asked that question in in the rising of the Sun and he answered it he said go back to Romans 8:11 how does this flesh become his flesh when the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ shall also quicken your mortal body in other words bring it subject to the word subject to the word not something to some mental idea not subject to another spirit subject to the word if that seems down inside of you he will quicken you and bring your spirit and your body subject to the world amen all right so he took and when he had taken the book eighth verse the four beasts and and elders fell down you know John saw himself there that's why he could shout John looked to pass the curtain of time and said well there's John I'm one of those elders I see myself in the book I see myself bowing down here and here he was that he fell down before the lamb every one of them having said harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the Saints prayers of the Saints hallelujah and they sang the new song he couldn't take they couldn't sing it until the book was taken amen right not gonna sing this new song until the books taken that's what separates the bride from the rest and they sang a new song thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and redeemed us to God and by thy blood out of every kindred tongue people a nation and has made us to our God made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on this earth much could be read further I think you're getting the picture amen when he took that book he was mediating but when he took that book and claimed his redeem then he went he still interceded till that last one realizes who they are in the book and matured in that word then he doesn't take an immature pride home but he's honest but he is here receiving her home he is receiving her ready to meet her in the air don't place all the coming in the meeting in the air that portion of the greatest mystery of that coming is right now if you don't get it right now you won't meet him in the air that's all there is to it that's what's being unveiled the pastor knows how to bring it to the church I just got a preach what's on my heart I just got to lay it out he can pick up the pieces amen I put him together other words as the Holy Spirit leads him for the Sheep amen Chris can't preach any other way than he preaches I got a preach like I preach and bless God he's a God variety I kind of like that I kind of like that really well that I like it very very well takes all the fear about Who I am what how I act and what I do it's gone brother BAM said when the token comes in no fear what do you have to fear it's he that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure your crucified with Christ nevertheless you live brother Ram said there's the token it's not you living anymore it's Christ living in you so where is your confidence it's in that word in you that's what God said I wanted you to have confidence in that's why you got to deny yourself daily and take up your cross put yourself on that cross and follow me who is he he's the word of promise for the season he's the whole word what's in season the full word okay so it's hidden mystery now I'm gonna drop these things in I have time to look it up let me just tell you church age book he talked about that remember he said in the invisible union it's like two books but it isn't he said it's it's it's one book brother Brown then the church age started in church age he said it's one book there's no difference between the Lambs book the book of life the ride book whatever he book written in heaven I don't have time on this but I but I will tell you this in the church age book he typed it right out and said he said but there's a section in that book that's a little record a section that's the Bride section it's the eternal life record section and that section is written of her Amen well maybe I should let's see I've got about five ten minutes I have couple hours actually but when Christ who is our life shall appear where do we appear at Scripture we're hidden Christ sealed there brother brems that always hid in Christ brother branham always referred to it then sealed and sealed in him to the day of redemption is that right sealed what a great thing it is to know you're sealed then how in the world are you going to come out here and do contrary to the word and say you're sealed and how in the world well I will go any further with that all right let me just let me just refer what I mean here but what brother Brown said here in church age book page 280 if you want to put these down you can read page 282 82 to 83 to 84 and you'll find exactly where we're talking if you haven't read the Sardis in church age go back and read it get into it because it identifies that book and how he judges the people all right now watch he says here on paragraph 2 I'm in Somerton I can't look at summer in church age yeah here it is 280 first off blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin and indeed she shall be with him speaking of the bride in his throne of judgment judging the world and even angels her name each of her members was written in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world he says and goes on to say that those names could never be removed they can be be said out of the regular book of life but he said not out of that section a bride's judgment I'm not finished yet so just hold the token I mean hold still hold the token to crucify yourself now for a little bit we're gonna I wish he would shut up and all I didn't mean that I wish he'd be quiet so we could go get a lunch anymore all right you really want me to okay on page 282 he said he said being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will he chose us in himself he said thus God has so designed that those whose names are placed in a section of the Lamb's Book of life and cannot be a race for they are the names of his bride all right you go down here to 283 now the record of this wheat plant whose the whole wheat plant he's talking about whose end is to be reproduced the original the original seed and multiplied whose scuse me let me read again but then now then the record of this wheat plant whose end is to reproduce the original seed in a multiplied form is the book of life the wheat plant is this is page 283 283 I'm reading from I repeat he said the history or record of this wheat plant is the book of life of which a part of the book of life is the record of eternal life see even you can see that that life that record comes up through every one of those sections every one I mean of those carriers right through Pentecost amen this message of the seventh angel the third pole is not Pentecostal message and yet we have to come but brother I just let me just say something to you what are we talking about this morning things that are to be brother Brown said the the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a temporal gift for you do we have it every day are we baptized afresh yes but it's a temporal gift it's there to water the seed amen you better stander the spouts thend better start opening reading the book alright let the Holy Ghost water at then see alright but he said it's a temporal gift for you to you but he said the real gift is that soul down in there that born of God there it is there's the inside of the inside there's what God recognizes that'll live the word for the season if that's not the if that's not the wheat if that's not the true word seed laying in there ready for the germ ready for life to strike that see it'll never reproduce Christ but whatever the seed is it's going to reproduce what it is by the anointing of the Holy Ghost because it can fall on your spirit the Holy Ghost can and bear a cockle burr life if that's cocklebur see down in that soul but if it's real word seed what are you gonna bear it's gonna bear the promise of the hour it's gonna bear the word for the season it's going to bear Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever that's what it'll bear it'll believe in the supernatural because it is supernatural it is the original faith it is the original Christ it is Christ in head form and brother Ram said the head is now uniting with the body now let me just go a little bit further he says now a part of that life is the record of eternal life a section of the book of life this is convincingly seen by examining the wheat plant all right he goes on to tell about the wheat plant I'll just let you read it but he said the record of eternal life is a section again all right it's a little section a little book like brother Mannis it's a book within a book he said one place that's exactly right and then he said then he turned around in invisible Union and said this Lamb's Book of Life then he said isn't is different from there from there from the the I've got it right here I better just read it let me just read it here in the rising I think it's no let me think now invisible Union yeah paragraph invisible Union 303 let me just read something to you so you'd say you'd get what I'm saying here what he said about it invisible Union paragraph 303 God had to open those seven seals not in the denomination I've always been against it but out of the denomination that he might take a bride not a denominational bride he couldn't do it it's against his own word he opened those seven mysteries in there that shows forth brings forth those things that's been hid since the foundation of the world might be revealed in the last days two sons of God now brought he said they brought they they that forth they brought that forth now before the people that they see it they're you you you now in now see it there see it see it there you now to this under nominal bride there is your two books one of them is the Lamb's Book of Life your name on theirs predestinated on there you can't go because no no more than you can take away nothing else it can't go because you can't you can take mmm you can no more take that away than anything than nothing see because it was foreordained to be on there but the regular that's what I wanted to work but the regular book of life he said can take that off at any time so see now it takes what he said in the church age brings it out as a section he brings it out and divides the regular book of life from the Lamb's Book so the Lamb's Book in that in that what he just said here is that section of the record of his own life oh brother sister what are we trying to say what's God judging us there you are himself you are himself you are just himself in another form it's the revelation of the Son of Man it's more than just succumbing they key came in every age but this coming is different this is seat again it's the same time this is bride time this is bride age how many ever heard prophets say that bride times seed time bride age and what's he said when he unites with the bride he said then what is it it's the revelation of the son of man again see we're further down the line you wonder why these things are happening the way they are because it's just preparing for that Confederation to step in of churches see see is going to make it look so reasonable start getting money from the government doing all these things you know just make it so comfortable and then make stipulations with it it's contrary to the word be careful it'll look so reasonable and so light you'll want to stay in it that's why we that's why I thank God for a godly pastor thank God for godly ministry that can identify that thing though it looks reasonably right and say no it's not of God it's that spirit and the two spirits would be so close it would deceive the elected possible all right so see what we're seeing what was happening here says you don't he said if you don't repent the regular book of life it's off of that regular book you're going to stand judgment the bride don't even stand the judgment but goes in the rapture you see brother sister you see you've done things you've done things you know you need to go to those individuals and make that thing right that'll hang on you for the rest of your life unless you make it right you'll not go any further yeah well I may die I ask God to forgive me but when you got to go to individuals that you spoke evil of and you lied about and you think you just get by with it I Got News for You you better make it right or you're not going anywhere amen call the ministry a certain thing and all these other things about it and think you get by with that you can't I might as well say it I'm a minister I'm gonna point that thing and unveil that spirit right there because if you don't make it right you're not going anywhere else forward with God till you get it right I don't care how much we how much we can read how much we can dance and sing the cocklebur does that just as strong as the wheat does are you with me I know this is rough I didn't come here to pity party I come here to patch you ain't covered pad anybody but the Lord lays this in my heart I'm gonna say it judgment begins at the house of God you better thankful that God puts his finger on something because He loves you and it's for your deliverance not to demean you so be careful how you take what's being said it's not a man speaking to you it's the Word of God speaking to you you may not like the way it's said but you better judge it by the word I don't know why I'm saying this but God wants it said I'm just going to have to close because I got so much here but remember we got a bride's book you want to know where he said about to be in bride's book right here on gods only provided place of worship paragraph 260 he said he forward named them placing their names in this bride book now you tell me if that's not the little book if that's not a section of the book what did he come to unveil himself what's the bride's judgement let me get that let me finish right here let me just finish it right here I'm leaving a lot but let me just finish it right here is visible Union we'll just finish it we could say a lot Christ some mystery we always said a lot I've referred to you just search it out it's too much like brother Paul said of course I've never said that before but it's so much I can't get it all out I just have to break it down to several parts but sometimes you get caught up and you're going on something else you forget the part you before because it keeps unfolding unfolding everyday and unfolds I don't know about you but every day is something new I can't write down fast enough it is the truth absolutely all right now we could host show how your your the words in the book daniel said seal up the words brother Brad said the believers the words in the book seal the book seal the word in the book I with that's Daniel if you want to read it Daniel 12:4 four and nine four and nine believer the words in the book amen our stand he laid in Zion Isaiah 28:16 Romans 933 first Peter 2:5 all those the scriptures we could refer to her record is opened loose to her alone not another but his wife it's the word opened revelation 10 message of the seventh angel was the word opened it's a third pull and it opens it inside wherever he puts it I will plant in Zion I will place in Zion a cornerstone then he said I will put in Zion a headstone amen what are we seeing we're seeing the completion of the mystery of Jesus Christ and here we are who are we where do you stand this morning unless you're in Christ I'll tell you if you are you'll obey every word you can't wait to make things right you can't wait to ask forgiveness well it just takes a high atop me then take the high Delphia I was over here the other day I was over here down here there's a little nursery it opened up there on on karcher Road just past more 10th Street is a little nursery there it opened up and I went down there and I came there three times to find that they give you a free four four four four pack of yeah of perennials I was waiting to get my free pack I Tim and I went down there and bought mother about Mother's Day gift and they've given a feel we're out of them they'll come in later so I come back when they said later and we still don't have them I said okay be be there be Tuesday I went back Tuesday still ahem Oh I said okay well we just had technical difficulties and I took the wrong attitude I said all technical difficulties ripped it up and threw in the garbage can that's a little paper I had walked away boy did my heart smote me there brother branham ran out the door men carnal but thank God my heart smoked me I couldn't ask for another thing he said you treat you had the wrong attitude toward that woman you go back and make that right of course this body didn't argue about it try to reason with it well really Lord hello oh you all haven't been there I know but like further Paul said is somebody like you alright so I kind of like that brother Paul so I stole it from you anyway alright this said I knew I had to make it right no question I said yes Lord I will we're right back there I said I went in the house said I gotta go make something right I said I didn't have the right attitude done and you know what I walked back in there and nobody around she was the one taking the money and on the helping out and she why she had walked out right if I had just met her right there I thought Lord how perfect you know how to bring it just right down to where it needs to be alone I said I did not have the right attitude she said I know what I said I want you to forgive me it wasn't just well forgive me I'm deciding on just a little bit no I did wrong I said I had the wrong attitude I shouldn't have spoken to you that way I want you to forgive me it really touched her you said would God allow you to do things like that oh absolutely just to glorify Him but I couldn't wait to let me write I couldn't go another step further until I had to go back to that individual and say I did you wrong I had a man pull out in front of me going to church one time many years ago just Paul I thought what's he think he is slow us down like that not thinking that rascal going to church I was pastor I followed that man he was going to a post office in Camp Verde had a church in Camp Verde Arizona I followed that man all the way in to where he stopped at a post office I caught out and I said sir I want to apologize he looked at me I said I won't apologize to you I had a wrong attitude and you pulled out in front of me over there because God spoke to me and said I allowed that man to pull out in front of you I had control of that matter what are you murmuring about now eat on that one awhile murmuring complaining how many things do we murmur about every day I decided that just two or three times the other day but I caught it I caught it I caught it what's happening death to self dying dying dying lord I don't that's not in me that is not in me that was not me that said that because I Know Who I am and that wasn't you so what's it doing that word is a discerner don't tell me the deserters not working he works very well how many times how many people of you how many times and I probably will still go back to somebody to say I'm sorry well how many times somebody come to you and say I'm sorry I shouldn't have thought of that what do you do say well bless God you shouldn't have done it that's not what you say if you're a Christian you'll say brother no problem no worries you're forgiven genuinely if you won't from your heart forgive every man his trespass how Jesus said how am I going to forgive you yours because the very character of Christ was to forgive well that's been said that's off my chest let's finish this sermon I'm not past time brother Paul he already warmed me about being too late that's all right I'm not making fun of that well we turned the corner somewhere no reason why I or him or anybody other brother would want to keep you any later than what God wants to keep I respect you I respect your I expect your hunger and your growling stomachs and just don't lift your watch and rattle it and that right I don't see anybody doing that let me finish honestly let me just finish this there's a lot to say I can't say it remember brother Brown said she's she is within and without glorious two things here let me just finish it up page 80 of the church age book Christ is our life Christ is our life that's what the union is about we bear life we bear his life okay his life again right here on earth that's what it's all about riding God and bride form and thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold a beaten work shall the candlesticks be made his shaft his branches his bowls his knobs his flowers shall be of the same the true Church of Jesus Christ I was readin about it revelations one the true Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his attributes his own glorious after is her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest Minds me that I want time to read it but I didn't come to bring fear and failure but courage ability is that right you speak the word I give you my power to use that can be used you have the mind of God I could be used foolishly that's for sure she is all glorious within and without what he has she's the manifest there is no fault in her I didn't even hear an Amen there is no fault in her that's not my judgment if I was to look at you as a man and judge you what would I judge but if I look at the word of Judge you what am I going to judge you're his eternal possession prophet said you are his eternal possession you are his kingdom had the kingdom of God is within you you are his kingdom manifested and his kingdom is his domain and his throne rules over his domain so you're seated in his domain amen so there's no fault in her brides judgment here's how he judges us right here the books been open there's no fault in her how can there be when he's faultless how can she have sin with he sinless and she is him and she's in him how can she be anything but sinless quite a message we have two men to minister in this hour isn't it the opening of the word all right she's all glorious within and without so don't start kicking at yourself on me without side amen just remember he's got control just like the man pulled out in front of you who loved him to do it maybe to stop you from a millisecond to keep you from an accident down the road to don't murmur about what God because he's got absolute such control over you even your breath you take every time you take it I say god help us to praise Him in all things amen amen from beginning to end in she is the work of her Lord hallelujah talk about judgment and all his works are perfect she's her the work of the Lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up in her as some completed some the summing up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of God is summed up and manifested in her quite a load out brother Paul quite a load quite a burden to carry but quite a haul what a joy to know that he's counted us in himself worthy amen to take his life what did he do he saw in you himself he got you to where you'd lose sight of yourself so that he could take himself that's in you and work it didn't that something that's what he did with Moses Moses I've cured you I've got you where you're making excuses why you can't go out minister and I'm upset with you and if you'd only just realize I'm trying to get you to see and I've got you where you think you can do nothing so that I can anoint you and take what I put in you and use it there you are that's the bride okay so all that summed up now let's finish this here okay are you ready he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word in the book of life that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to to the world in the anointed bridegroom which foreordained you has washed you by the washing of the word that old husband is dead turtley separated he's gone he's dead quit listening to it listen you can't kill a dead man don't care what we anyone says about any of it what they think about you what differs that make they can't kill a dead man in that good you don't have to listen to him either you reckon him dead daily crucify him daily all right so he said now he's dead that means he's eternal separated you'll never meet up with never marry him again he's gone he's done away with he never was your husband to begin with all right your first huh that you are married to the anointed bridegroom which foreign aid you has washed you by the washing of the water of the word by the word the washing of the water by the word in the word see you are standing now watch here's a judgment you are Stanley completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to you bride now we go off the air just in a minute you are standing if you're standing on God's Word with God's Word every Amen every jot every tittle where are you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from them shucks and get out here on the wheat where you can right before the Sun I hear the coming of the combine you know the combine does ask a pastor separates isn't that right separates everything that isn't seed separates out and goes out the back end or somewhere as as of what no it isn't no it goes through a wind it goes to white a cycle doesn't it boy there's there it beats it up and everything else in difficult puts out everything and keeps the seed now that's why we come to church we're in a combining and boy the wind of the Holy Ghost begins to minister begins to move in that word what happens is separating separating separating separating I don't like separation but God does separating separating there's a difference between the seed and the shuck the seed shall not be heir with the shuck and when you begin to say I am my father 1 and these other things the shuck pulls away there it is the shuck pulls away you didn't pull away from them the shuck pulls away from the word because the word separates you just begin to preach the word for the season and watch the shuck watch that make believer watch that unbeliever carnal that's all they can see they will go right back to that old if it made them sick the first time why do you want to go back to the denominational thing again amen that's right a lot could be said right there he could tell you what the problem said about that to see but let's go on I'm wanting to get you this I'm on the close right here now where are you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away you're standing complete I'm telling you where you're standing he said you're saying he said I hear the coming of the combine we're in it he said I hear you standing you're standing complete justified like you never did it in the first place amen he said you are standing he said you are he said you are the pure you are you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born there's the key born of the Spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ remember where the real gift is that seed down in that soul he says and there in the soul there you grow up by the baptism the Holy Ghost baptize it there you grow up that's why you feed on an open book you cannot get enough of it you've got to do it every day you've got to get alone with that word every single day you can't get enough of it you think I'm trying to be something against you don't you I'm not I'm in the same boat you are everything I've said this morning applies to me as much as you or anybody in here but how I thank God for the opening of the word by grace and I want everything to be right search me Oh God look at the song we just say search me he's putting you through a combine this morning search me and he's doing it and he's putting a finger on something in your life that you need to do why would you run from it quit running from his presence run into his presence what would be a spirit that would be in you want to run from the presence want to lift yourself up wanting to be notarized earn order rotary we aren't here commending ourselves we have one purpose one thing to do bride that's to glorify Him okay you are the pure virtuous sinless bride sinless bride virtue a sinless bride pure of the son of the Living God every man and woman born of the Spirit wash the blood of Jesus Christ believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned the first place you are perfect tell the devil he's a liar get everything right with God and stand right there on that word God it's right here I've done what you said to do now it's up to you you had to you must do it amen you let a person really truly repent by faith through that blood and you watch what happens God will honor his word and give them that gift what that quickening power on that soul to take that word and bring it alive you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen you see the rain wasn't sent for the cocklebur of them or the weed it was sent for us the bride the supernaturals for us they live by it but so do we and we rejoice in it but there's one difference aren't the brides teaching is the word for the season that's right the prophets teaching was the word for the season where's the voice under her messenger where's the voice not another voice the voice Amen that's why the brides repudiated cast down kicked out in every age but especially in this one as we get further and closer to this don't you think something's not going to start raising up politically naturally churches everything else we see it forming what's it coming against trying to stop this bride he tried to stop me in that office this morning made me whole spill a hole most a bunch of water on the desk but Paul I'm sorry I got it wiped up and it went everywhere else but on my books I did I see the supernatural yes I'm trying to open one of those bottles in there and I that thing opened up but I couldn't get it undone from the the lid caught caught and well those little thingamajig trying to do a thing the jig that what open I couldn't and I did that try and twist it oh you devil and here I was trying to open it I said doesn't bother me so what got a bunch of Kleenex tired of wiping everything up lift the glass up all won't notice doesn't matter I just want to testify though the devil don't like it you don't like it when you preach like this because it uncovers sin and you know what we expect to come in this Tabernacle if you've got sin in your life if you've got things hidden didn't think nobody knows about it I want you to tell you something where two or three are gathered together the deserters here and he's gonna uncover that thing don't you come walking in here because you don't want that word doesn't cover you why is it being uncovered so you can be set free that's what light sent for you know the Bible said light doth make manifest sin alright I'm sorry I get tarried away when I eat but watch when I get carried away you think I'm carried away now wait till then I can't wait till then but I have to wait till then if I was supposed to die in the morning and a man took my place I cannot die for that sin somebody took my place Jesus a word took my place he became me and that a sinner that I might become him the word the word let me hold true to it not the church let me hold true to the word all that spiritual union of Christ in His Church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested vindicated just what the Bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day all right why it's called meeting so fast out there and those desert sand things taking place I couldn't even keep up with it and you know what I can say I can say it's doing the same thing to me individually it's happening so fast now brother Paul I'm sure it's just all of a sudden it's just here it's here it's here it's here it's here it just ties together ties together ties together one message over here right back over here ties together ties together and then tried to bring it in 30 minutes try to bring it to hours 510 no listen he said watch the word becomes the word we're near the coming of Jesus meeting United with this church when the word becomes the word Amen when the word becomes a word well that's all brother David see we still have to having come to do that no it's happening the words becoming the word but the flesh will become the word then will be changed we have to first be changed like Abraham was changed to see the son you say that again we've got to have our change before we can meet him in the air and we've got to be changed or we're not going to meet him physically changed but what is it it's a inside change first and it's happening and it's happening it's a mystery of a secret coming that the public doesn't know nothing about but it's lived right out before but thanks be to God for that because if there happened to be a predestinated seed down to one of those little lives that light strike that seed they're gonna say why are you so different what's wrong what's happened to you why do you speak differently you're like you're speaking in another language now their tongue that's right we were discussing that the other day another tongue a new tongue amen what it is a new tongue oh I'm not done yet you're standing completely you never sinned in the first place Chloe that's me too how many say it's you you never sinned in the first place god bless you my brother all these raise your hand god bless you you'd be an honest amen I'd never sinned in the first play why I'm in Christ you can't impute sin to Christ neither will you impugn it to the bride because she was in him before the foundation of the world a part of himself which is eternal life she was a very thought of himself and those thoughts are eternal amen all right God don't even even know it you never sinned the first place God don't even know it it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you never you were accused of it by the accuser but who stepped forth here in this day the judge went to come up and judge she is perfect she is sinless I find no fault there is no record of her ever sinning there is no record there you show me the records Satan you want to accuse her you show me the record you show me where the record is and I'll show you another record hallelujah I'll show you another record the books opened and I see the mystery of my name in that book the mystery is revealed he placed in me himself and that itself is opened up I am the message of the hour I am the opened word I am himself revealed that's judgment of God to his bride last and last and hallelujah praise the Lord let's go iced over there your virtuous I don't care much you're accused of it you're not accused by him your judge counted you absolute there's no case against you there is no judgment against you you word you are accepted I see where it's written here let your accepted in the beloved and I have and I see the confirmation of the token in that life there is no record other than that eternal life record hallelujah hallelujah that's something to rejoice about as something to give God thanks / he took his wife he took the book he opened the the marriage covenant he's loosed it you're his you're his property it's eternal life you're his possession he'll never lose you your name can never be wiped off of that record hallelujah what am I seeing I'm seeing the mystery unveiled that he placed in me before the foundation of the world and said I'll build it by the revelation of myself and I'll cap it off in this hour there's your seventh seal open amen you are the virtuous Bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless son of God standing with a pure unadulterated bride word he washed by the water of his own blood he might take you husband who was predestinated in the beginning right in the bosom of the father brother Brown said predestinated as he was makes that same word flesh in you as it was in him now what about it let's pray our Heavenly Father how do we stop that's just time going on going on you said we're wearing the wedding band of unpressed innate and unmerited grace a wedding brand of grace unmerited of our own oh how we thank you for Lord that we can see ourselves identified confirmed recognize in you by your own life by the by the own word Lord that we see who we are and that we've come and was in you from the foundation of the world chosen in you eternal in you there's no other record we are eternal life Oh God that just gives such a strength such a peace we've entered into your rest we've ceased from our own labors Oh Lord we're so thankful for the Cathy the capping the message in the hour capped off the bride Oh Lord how we thank you it's settled peace it's a seal that can't be broken glory was opened up to us and then Lord that opening is absolutely the manifestation of what you said that when it would get the heart the veil would be taken away when it turned to the heart the veil would be removed and we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory as by the word of the Lord all God then we have a great ministry this unveiled word is our ministry oh it's a joy Lord it's a joy to know you to know you his life Lord Jesus bless these words these people if it's broken up you forgive me I tried to say exactly what you gave in my mouth to say thou knowest Lord I commit it to you I commit the furthering we appreciate what every ministers

during the week and when we'd come to church Lord in the spirit oh god we we'd have an open heart Lord just here in my father and Lord let the word come and confirm and confirm and reveal and reveal and we grow and we grow and we grow it's not a drudgery to come back to church we can't wait for those doors open we can get in here with our brother and defeat on the word once again Lord we may not have this privilege too much longer but that'll never take away what you've planted in your bride no matter where she is she's the Church of the Living God Oh God and we know that you're going to church every day that doesn't take away from our going to church you said forsake not the assembling of ourselves together the more as you see the Day approaching Oh God we just place it all in your
