I was going to read a quote but I think I'm going to save it for another time Ephesians chapter five verse 14. I left the scriptures out so everyone had to turn in their Bibles Ephesians chapter 5 verse 14 to 33. wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time because the days are evil where wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord give giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God that's powerheads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just ask that you would just be with us tonight Lord that you would speak to our hearts Lord Jesus that everything you have for us Lord would be delivered to our hearts Lord Jesus and that father you would just touch it with your presence and your anointing Lord father whereas if it is the words of God it will to do just that Lord may you remove all the words of man Lord it be only your words tonight we ask we love you Lord we thank you may you bind every spirit that will be hindrance Lord tonight in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated this screen still isn't working okay all right well we will try to uh to uh work off the iPad and that um so we are in verse 22. Ephesians chapter five now um tonight I'm going to do something a little bit differently with the with Ephesians 5 verse 22. um I'm first of all I'm going to ask you to did you forget the jokes and I'm gonna speak I'm gonna speak to to this is going to be uh directed towards and see if this is working here is this one working it's turned on okay go go to the title slide we're gonna praise the Lord we're gonna labor through this I guess okay well the devil's mad so we're going to speak on tonight the balanced home and I wanted to take the subject of the man's position and so you think well why are we reading why submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord in verse 22 because we're going to take and we're going to use that to look at where a man's position is now we as as Christians as message Believers we we're all are very excited about the bride and the bride being in her position and in doing so we we leave and we we push into evangelism to to get people excited and to get to to preach the Deep things of the message and the Seven Seals and all of these things but did you know that if your home is not in Balance according to the word of God you will never be in your position I don't care how much you know about the Bible I don't care how much about the prophet about the message if your home is not balanced according to the word of God you will never be in your position as the bride of Christ home life is not just for Dr Dobson or Gary Chapman home life is for Christians and God has has set forth very clearly in his word exactly how that should look at it look like now you look at me and especially since I shave them looking a lot younger you think wow what would you know well I'm going to ask you to to to to Journey with me because I am learning and I'm sharing with you what I've learned I don't know everything over the past few years my wife and I have labored and we have uh in in tears prayers and frustrations and sometimes tears how do we raise our children how do we model our home towards the word of God how do we have that family whose children love to be at home who who they they they love Mom and Dad they they want and this perfect harmony according to the scriptures we we heard of different different classes for raising kids that we tried and we got some good things but we always come to a point where we said well this this isn't it and so God began to deal with my heart and he and he spoke to her and he said just start preaching it and you think well that's that's a bit foolish Chris like don't you think you ought to know it before you preach it well actually you preach as a minister we all have a Ministry You Preach where you live so as I study this to minister it I'm taking it and I'm applying it to my home so it's been a rough past few days because the devil knew we were going to preach this tonight so the lord loves everything in balance and I have a couple scriptures here you just forgive me and you can just leave it on this slide these were after thoughts um and it's in Proverbs 16 verse 11 if you want to jump over there with me just one little verse here Proverbs 16 verse 11. it says adjust Weight and Balance are the Lords so the Lord really likes a balance now in this picture you have the left side and the right side of the road and you have the center lane okay now we understand cars you know you go in One Direction you you drive on the right side you're going the other direction driving the left side but God's road is one way did you know that God's Road's one way so we walk the center line on God's Road and you you never have the whole road unless you have the far left and you have the far right so in this scripture here it says um it just went in the balance of the Lord's all the weights of the bag are his work now Solomon is referencing the law of Moses that talks about a man and you shouldn't carry uh uneven weights in a bag just even weights are in the bag that's what the Lord told them in the Mosaic law so Solomon's referencing that but he's saying hey God loves a balance but all the weights are in the hand of God the far left and the far right are in the hands of God the devil is in the hands of God so God uses all of these to build this robe that we're walking down go with me back to Ephesians chapter 5 verse 22. it says wife submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord so this is not about a man having control this is not about the men controlling but this is some this is to mirror your relationship with God and even though it's our subject man's position every every man every boy every woman every girl should understand a man's position because if you know a man's position you know when a man's not in position you can either pray for him or you can say um you talk to my pastor before you talk to me right so in verse 23 4 the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body now I want you to forget message culture the husband is not the um the uh with an iron fist you I am in charge of this home you will do as I say that is not at all what a man's position is let's finish the scripture we're never going to get to where we're going tonight therefore even as Christ is the head of the church so in other words the husband is the head of the wife as the Christ is the head of the church see too many times we separated we say oh there's God and there's me as a man or there's God and there's my husband but it's the same relationship the same it should be the same that's the man's position so Christ is the perfect example therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and in everything and and you don't have to be married to be in your position as a woman right okay there was headship in your life whether it's your father your grandfather your uncle your whatever it is there's different men that got places in your life for you to be for them to be your headship so husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word now can you take me to the um the first quote now brother Brown says here when you when you take a man that's now this is a bit funny but I don't um we don't mean it as such but hang on so he says when you take a man that's so sisified he may all right be balanced up all right now what he's saying is he may look everything like a man but there's something wrong and when you take a woman and wants to chop her hair and wear a pair of overalls and get out there and God bless I'll tell you there's something wrong A woman has the I only I bring this quote in here to show you that a woman and a man have their position a woman has a feminist spirit and a man is masculine we know that and you know that does a woman look right tries to be act like a man so in other words he it's not just because you know none of your sisters are wearing overalls and out there saying you know bless God I'll tell you right because that's what he says if you listen to him none of you guys are none of you you are doing that but it's not just those things you know sometimes we take uh things a little bit too literal and we say well well I'm not doing that but we're doing something on the other side here you can act like a man without wearing ever wearing overalls or ever cutting your hair you can have a masculine spirit so men men can have a feminist spirit they just you know their pushover all right they're too soft that kind of thing but a man is supposed to be a man but a man who's a real man of God is not cruel he's not a bully he's not rough oh he's roughing Rough and Tumble you know with the boys that kind of thing he's tough but he's not a brute he's not a beast that was for the Apes we were the next step so next slide now one thing that we know and we've been Faithfully taught here is that our position is our strength your position in the word of God directly correlates to your position in the home you see it let's not separate them anymore they're the same thing the home should be the word of God we don't have church and and the message and and dad's not sitting in the corner with headphones and never teaching the kids and he's just you know listening to the tapes he's out of balance that's that's not in the home and the wife is stewing in the corner saying well you know well no it's it's a balance and when it's balanced it's a beautiful Harmony so next slide so Christ's leadership now when it says that the husband is the head it means the husband is the leader that's what headship is headship is leadership if if it's anything but if it's anything outside of love it's dictatorship y'all want to go down to uh Venezuela now none of us none of us say hey sign me up or go to a dictator's country right it's control husband doesn't control the wife husband doesn't control the children as a as a man if you try to control your environment you breed rebellion in your environment Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft so your your kids aren't listening to you or or or or things are going right your wife you know she she's not she's not you know doing what you want her to do you don't you don't get after your wife you say okay I'm not leading in the right direction I'm leading in the wrong direction leadership is applying the word to your home not just to yourself it's not about us anymore it's not about us at one point in time we were single it was about us we serve God we made sure we were taken care of you know it was easy right took a nap when you want wherever you want when you want you're free of responsibility but then you take on this position as a man of a home now everything stops with you everything should be there is never a good reason as a man to raise your voice and yell and I'm probably the worst offender there's a never now I'm not talking about emergencies don't get too literal I mean in your home when you're dealing with your home you sh there's never a good reason to raise your voice if you're raising your voice you waited too long if it's if it's a situation with your children and you're raising your voice it's because you've lost patience because you didn't act soon enough Sometimes the best thing you can do is say you know what you go sit on your bed in your room I'm gonna go take five minutes and then we're gonna deal with this you don't need to raise your voice you know the the big thing in the world is is the the alpha male Like the Wolf right and uh guy you know guys young guys love that yeah like post a Howling Wolf on their Instagram and say you know forget the haters it's the Lone Wolf right but all of the all of the information that Maine Society knows about wolves actually was completely proved to be wrong because the original studies was of a wolf pack in captivity and the studies was yeah you know the strongest wolf comes in kicks out the other wolf and takes over the pack and then these guys decided to go and study wolves in the will in the wilderness for like 10 20 years or more and they found out everything they knew about was completely wrong a wolf pack is a family the alpha male is Dad guess what dad eats last in the wolf pack he makes sure the kids and his wife have the food that they need first then he eats you see when when it's like hey that's Dad's food that's control that's communism do you want a socialistic household or did you want to do you want a democracy actually brother says the best thing is a good King a good God-fearing King and that's what you want to be you want to be the king of your home okay you don't need um we don't want to get flagged um so next slide John 10 verse 1 to 5. John 10 one to five really really I say unto you he that interest not by the door into the Sheepfold but climeth up some other way the same as a thief and Robber but he that interest in by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep so he's got nothing to hide right because he's a Shepherd to him that the Porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he'd call his own Sheep by name and Lead it them out and when he puteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers okay that's the last verse so Christ is the best example there is next slide he is he says he says I am the Good Shepherd and know my sheep and have known of mine now in Ephesians 5 it says just stay on that slide there Ephesians 5 it says um husbands love your wives even as Christ also love the church the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church okay so you don't have to have very much deductive reasoning or very much common sense to realize that the husband should mirror Christ in how he conducts how he takes care of his home how he leads okay you wanna you wanna you know if you're in the business world and you want to be a good leader you read books about leadership and you lead read books uh written about leadership by people who show leadership okay one of the most popular persons today is Jocko willink he was uh he was a Seal Team Six he was a he was a uh I don't know captain or whatever but you read from men who have experience right Christ has the most experience ever ever right he's Eternal so he's already known how a home should go be way before there ever were homes by the way at home is not a house a home is in a house now sometimes like I said it's it's all in balance it's all in Balance so so you gotta you know a man's position could be is to provide for his family but if all he does is work he's out of balance so you know there there's a few different there's a few different building blocks to a marriage one of them is financial but if if all you do is focus on financial you neglect the spiritual emotional physical well-being of your family so it's it's in the balance so we want to know well what's the best way what what what is man's position now man's position is in the home and in the church and in the community so whether you're married or you're single or you're not married yet it doesn't matter this sermon applies to you whether you're a man or a woman you sisters need to know this because here's here's where the devil likes to slip in he came up with this really cool thing and you've heard me talk about it called the news feed so mainstream media doesn't understand the balance of a man and a woman they don't they don't so if you're not careful as a woman you begin to think this is how a man should act this is how a man should be okay you read books about men romance novels right there are certain ones that are okay you know but if you're not if if you are getting the wrong impression of a man then you meet a boy or you're already married you look at your husband and say why are you being so rude and rough when he's in his position and you're not because you have the wrong perspective of what a man should be so you need to know what a man's position is in the Bible just as much as you need to know what your position as a woman is because position is what strength you want to be a strong Christian he's coming to church and you and you you're reading the seals book and you're reading the church age book and nothing your life is struggling your home where are you at home our pastor just said well I think it was Sunday you know what what do you do Monday this is Monday this sermon is Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday that's what this is and this is God's word none of this is mine this is God's word and and and and so if we're not too careful we focus on that and we we neglect our home preach to me the seals talk to me about the seal I use the seals because you know it's around the message message culture again you know it's considered the highest right at least that's how I would I the circle that I grew up in looked at it that way okay I mean really because Christ is that but Christ is the seal so you want the seals opened your home that means dad sometimes you put the kids to bed guess what your that comforter to your wife you're helping your wife you just fulfilled the seven seal because you were acting like Christ you see there there's some things in in that we're taught in the met in the in the Bible that you can't necessarily put a b c d as a checklist not every time is it right you know you can't expect your husband to put the kids to bed every single night there's things that he has to be doing that are his position but it's a balance you say oh well you got to do everything and then you just sit on the couch now as a man you got to sit on the couch sometimes we work hard you see when a man is sitting because the Bible in Proverbs 31 it says the uh the husband okay you know what I'm gonna botch it so let's just proverbs 31. her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the Elders of the land so if we're not careful okay I I have seen relationships where the man goes too far to be helpful and he's not where we need him okay so men make sure that you're in the balance if you're if you have a duty in the church on a Sunday on a Wednesday you need to be in that Duty your wife should be taking care of the children because you are in you are working you were into you can't take your kids to the job site you can't have your kid sitting on a lap and you're at your home when you're on a meeting you need to be focused on what you're doing because guess what if you're not focused on that you're out of your position and your home life and your family they start to fall apart because your children and your wife forget your position and it's your fault sometimes we have to look at our wife and she's upset we have to say sweetheart can't do that right now I've got to take care of this In Love sometimes even in love with with the right attitude she might be a little bit upset but you're not telling her get out of here you're you're talking in love okay ologist so happy tonight next slide so a man's role or his position next slide so the man is The Shepherd of the home now when when a shepherd takes the Sheep somewhere he doesn't he leads them he's the ship the Sheep they don't know where the best grass is the shepherd does Shepherd says Hey the grass looks good over here eat over here and guess what what's the classic example the Sheep eating under the fence so sometimes you know their family gets to looking over the classic word the Joneses and they think well why can't we be like that so one some of the hardest times that I have to deal with as a husband as a father is when my kids come to me and they want to do something and I say no we don't do that and they ask me why they do it and they is somebody in the church that's really really hard but Dad we have to do that we are not raising we are not responsible for those other children can have compassion because I had to live that growing up that was the pastor this group wasn't super great they had all the fun without me but I thank God today that my parents said no because none of them serve God that's not a boast on me that is not a boss on anything that is my father was in his position when it came to that situation he knew there are boundaries and there are limits and guess what I felt safe at home and on the subject of control since we since we have some older youth here one time I was out with with my friends who were not believers they were most of them were good there was One Bad Apple says about that and uh good Christian boys except for one but we were out and and I stayed out late it wasn't even that late I got home at like 11 30. and we were hanging out more so than I ever had before and I was I I was enjoying myself this is cool hanging out with the boys you know there were some dirty jokes that happened I'm guilty and I came home not to my dad calling me or yelling at me when I walked in the door he was just sitting in his chair he's normally a couple hours already in bed I walk in the door and he's just sitting in his chair waiting for me and he said hey hey Chris I hate that he's like good night love you God if I went to bed that had more effect on me than him standing up and saying what were you doing out so late because I was convicted because he showed me he knew what was going on where I was and that's it I never did it again because I didn't want to ever have to see that do that again right he was leading by example you will the Bible says wives submit yourselves unto the husbands not husbands make your wife submit okay next slide now um desperation says now how can you have faith in your wife if you don't love her that's infilio you know sometimes you have to put a little few more sentences in the quotes to get the context now how about Agape to God how can it be if you don't love him now here's where I want to get to you if you said you love your wife and never tell her about it and never sit down and make love to her express it to her kiss her hug her and tell her she's the best cook in the country and all the things that you know and how pretty she is and how much you love her if you don't do that she'll never know it that's the way if you do love her you express it you can't say oh I'm not a touchy kind of guy I'm not no sorry you gotta get rid of that guy you need to love your wife Solomon says ravish her how to make you a little bit uncomfortable take her behind the door right okay she is your sweetheart see them boys are sneaking her in the back but they'll remember this one day when they're married and they'll appreciate me for saying it she's your sweetheart you put passion into loving her it's not enough to provide a home it's not enough to help with the kids it's not enough to to to help in the kitchen once in a while but the man did she told him get out of there you know so you don't have to make it a habit I'm just kidding it's not enough to do those things it's because you have to balance all of it now I didn't let me see if I can pull this up really quick I always forget directly how to say this quote but Theodore Roosevelt he said I wish to preach not the doctrine of ignable ease but the doctrine of the strenuous life now it's a lot of work and very strenuous sometimes to Hold Your Position if you many times there's stories of heroic events in battle that were just simply the soldiers held their position they didn't get in they didn't push forward they held their position and it gave the victory the same thing happens in your family when if you take this and Lord willing will will do a few parts and you start to apply this word not my words the word of God to your home guess what it's going to cause strife it's going to cause problems because the devil says say what and you're going to want to run to to YouTube and run to the movies but put a movie on not run to the movie theater right you're going to want to escape and say well just I'm just too tired today I'm sorry we're not allowed to be too tired to serve God right we must gird ourselves up to for the battle every day correct we have no problem as Believers talking about that but as husbands and fathers we say well I'm just too tired today you're not taking care of your family you're not in your position because you're too tired no we We Don't Preach the doctrine of ease but of the strenuous life God has called us to a battle and that includes taking care of your home now that doesn't mean as a man you have to stand on your feet 24 7. but that means in your position holding your position and wives you should help him in that position you should want him to stay in that position you should when you see him starting in his position because you're going to know what his position is you gotta stand behind him and say you got it even though that might mean things change for you you gotta say you got it and you push in with him the Lord puts a lot of emphasis on marriage marriage is the oldest is it institution or Constitution institution marriage is the oldest institution in the world it just sounds weird to use that word there but it is God started Genesis chapter 2 verse 15. and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden I don't have it in the slides and dressed to dress it and keep it and the Lord came out of the man saying hey you know here's the trees Verse 18 and the Lord God said it is not good that man should be alone I will make him and help me for him and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field Adam name them verse 21 and Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and took one of his ribs and close up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her unto the man now there's a very important point to that scripture and this Ruffles feathers sometimes so I say this in complete love because I want you as sisters in this church as a minister associate Minister here I'm responsible that you be the best you can be you are part of man you come from man you cannot do it on your own you have to have leadership Brothers do you realize the responsibility you have when a woman cannot even be her full potential without the leadership of a man and you can be single you can be your father or it can be another another you know figure in your life but it's leadership you cannot come to your full potential without the leadership of a man because you come from man foreign see this isn't a run the aisles kind of service so don't worry I'm not expecting it uh next slide so we just read that quote where brother Adam says you got to tell her how pretty she is you got to tell her what a good cook she is you know don't critique your wife's cooking in the right moment you sneak in and you've seasoned it a little bit more tell her it's the best thing you ever had because then should be like well I don't know what do you think can make it better right then there might be a discussion okay but don't just tell your wife you know I had a young couple we were we were visiting them and they're freshly married and and he asked me he said he said he asked me about that and I started laughing I was like I was like bro no and he didn't like my answer it was funny he did he was he was like what's the problem see Man versus women now you're coming together you totally do two different viewpoints I told the young people on Sunday morning the best mirror you can have is marriage you say wow I act like that so love communicated is love received not love in a box love communicated is love received it could be a box of chocolates it could be a kiss on the lips a kiss on the cheek a little hug it could be a little date you see it could be a little washing of the dishes I'll put the kids to bed tonight love communicated there's a whole spectrum of how we receive love love communicated is love received and that's a that is a two-way street next slide in uh time-tested Memorials of God and it was talking about men losing their affections for their wife and they don't love them as they did when they were sweethearts shame on you you ought to do it she's always your sweetheart absolutely that's the part she should be and you should treat her like that oh never let that little honeymoon cease because it isn't going to in heaven going to be just perfectly one there he says again in the same sermon I don't know if I put it right there yet and we should never forget to honor each other now I'm talking about husband and wife honor each other always be sweethearts never let it cease you don't chew your sweetheart out you buy her flowers even if she says no don't don't bother the best thing I learned when she says don't that's what she wants it the most so next slide just so before I so I know where I'm at okay so back to the scripture here it's not husbands make your wife submit hurry up make their wives no it's it's wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord so it's to God when you submit your heart and you give your heart to your husband you're giving it to to God okay submission now if you look up in the concordance strong concordance and you pull up the word submit in the scripture it this word submission here is is a Greek word and it's a military term meaning to arrange a troop divisions in a military fashion under the command of a leader in non-military use it was it was a voluntary attitude of giving in cooperating assuming responsibility and carrying a burden that's what submission is do you see any part in there that says you're the servant you're the slave she's not your slave you are her leader and that's a voluntary when it says wives submit is saying wives give in cooperate assume the responsibility of your position and carry the burden so the yoke is easy and the burden is lied right because it's God's position so as soon as you do this everything becomes easier in the home and husbands you have to if this isn't how your home is working right now you have to pull that out maybe there's a part of you that's not lined up with the word of God because if if the man is not subject to God his wife will never be in submission to him and the children are underneath the submission of the father and mother the the the continuity of the family the harmony of the home will never be there the ballots of the home will never be there unless dad is submitted to God now the wife can serve God still right but the home will be out of balance unless the man is in his position is submitted to God because who's our best example our best example is Christ right and what did what did Christ have to say about being in submissive being in submission to the Lord to Christ hang on here he said he was bound to the will of the father he walked into the pool of Bethesda I think it was if I got the wrong name forgive me he walked into there he could have healed everybody but we classic story we all know this but he didn't he went to the one person the one man and healed him of his infirmity and then he walked out because that was the will of the father you see how it's not cut and dry say well God can heal he's going to heal no it's it's not it's it's whatever God is leading you to so God LED Jesus to heal one person he was completely subjected completely submitted to the headship of the father that is the same position men have to take you can't find your you can't make up a decision where you're gonna go what you're gonna do maybe don't pray for God's will maybe just serve God maybe just learn more about him maybe just feed on the word more the best thing I can do as a man when I see my house in turmoil is start spending more time with God not more time telling my wife to get under control and get spanking getting after my children and putting them and you need to listen up and do all this stuff no there's chaos go to the word it's a very simple it's a very simple equation but we are complicated because as soon as you you're going to go home I hope if this steps on your toes I hope you can go home and say we're gonna do this we're going to change our home we're going to bring this home into balance all of a sudden you're going to have the worst headache you ever had in your life if you're gonna wake up in the morning you're going to be so tired now what did I do yesterday your back's Gonna Hurt it's just the devil right just the devil coming in now you can be a uh because we have young people here you can go and you can start help bringing balance in your home if your home is not the way it should be just layer on forgiveness slather the love of God don't be found be found innocent if you have a bad attitude I don't care I don't care what Mom and Dad are doing you can still have the right attitude because you are responsible for that and you can start to learn now what it means to have a balanced home because one day at the Lord should teres you will be in that position and you don't want to repeat the cycle because if you just carry the bitterness that you have in your heart in to your future you will repeat exactly what you hate about your parents to the T you will repeat it the only way you can break the cycle is with Christ and Christ has a role in the home Christ has a position very top that's his position but you know what what's the one thing that God does speaking of a man being in his position and wanting his family to be in position and balanced home what is the number one thing God doesn't does he's a gentleman and he never forces you to do anything a man should never Force his wife to do anything you will lead in love he never he never forced it you know you lead your children because if you just force your children into obedience as soon as you're not around they'll be the wildest kids in church when I see families as a whole as a unit together and I see Mom and Dad in strict control I am very wary of their children because as soon as mom went down and around they're the worst bunch of them but I see parents who are like now there's a balance I'm not talking about the ones who can't control their kids but I see I see kids who are who have the confidence to speak up and to talk and hey you know what's going on and Mom and Dad might have to say hey quiet down right but the kids are confident in their atmosphere and they feel that they can be themselves so when I see the family as you and I say oh that's how those kids act and sure enough Mom down around you want to know if you want to know your if you want to know your kids are in too much of a control ask how they act when you're not around if they're out of control you are too controlling and there's a balance right okay but if you ask say how oh your kids are so well behaved they get my kids wow wow you're doing the right thing because we want we don't want Titus I don't want you to serve God because I told you to because as soon as I'm not around and we have many examples of this in the message you're going to stop serving God I want you to serve God because you love God I want my daughter I want my kids to be obedient respectful because they want to and control never brings that out in them it never does and and so I knew this was going to happen I pray Lord help me stay keeping the channel the next slide here so likewise your husbands dwell with them according to let me just get a time check here dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel okay so that's scripture that scripture okay we'll save that for the next one and as being heirs together of the grace of life that you're wait a second that your prayers be not hindered what happened to the scripture in the message that's its culture what happened no I know there's some circles where this stuff is taught well taught and you see the fruits of that you see the fruits of that but as a broad spectrum what happened to the scripture that your prayers be not hindered oh I need uh you know I just need a closer walk with God wife shut up and sit down they don't go together it's not about how much you know or how many tapes you listen to it's about is your home in balance that your prayers be not hindered boy that hits me home it's home for me that your prayers be not hindered that's I'm I'm my my burden tonight is to get you to see just how serious God looks at a marriage and a family unit it's not just something that we do because he's handsome and kids are cute guess what that wears out and we say they say oh wow we've heard that a million times but it does it's a fact love never wears out Christ never wears out he's the same yesterday today and forever I was listening to or I was there's this quote where the brother man tells a story about the the girl who went out with the guy with cute feet right he smelled good see the devil give you any excuse and we laugh at that and we say cute feet but yet he plays the guitar so you're attracted to him or he's got a nice car right let's leave the Halos to the angels next slide here if you've wandered a way out in the world and you women's got to acting worldly and you men's got to letting them do it shame on you you're supposed to be the boss of the house you're the ruler the Bible said the man shall rule Now watch how brother immediately brings us back into balance not a dictator now a floor mat what he's saying is she's not your floor mat he made him a help meet a sweetheart okay so men you want a sweet heart lead your home you want a wife who's in her per position get in your position next one Christ is the perfect example how should a man be what kind of you know young ladies growing up I know don't I mean don't think about it but five years six years eight years fly by you want to know what kind of man you want to find okay guess what unfortunately if you frequent camps most of the time the guys who are the good ones aren't popular you if you're looking for a boy and you look at you're looking at a boy and you say you know kind of like him watch him after church what does he do if he splits move on you can come back later and check up on him because God could have done changed his life right you can't excuse them for good I know people who are married today fine Christian couples who he said sorry sister you need to get right with God and she wouldn't go right with God and then they got together now she didn't do it because of him but he just said hey things are going to work out like that right but he he he still likes her he watches from afar but you watch him he didn't stalk her Gabriella [Laughter] I got the why dear eyes when I said he watched her from afar so you watch that man what does he do is is he is he is he's on the front row or is he a couple rolls back is he serving God is he is he the nice guy or is he the now guy can can a guy can be athletic and still be on fire for God okay but watch where they're emphasis is what's their focus okay now husbands bring this right back to where we are tonight what's your focus there's things that I want to do in my life and I struggle with them because I realize I can't I can't really do that right now so I'm giving that up because right now my focus is my family now as most of you know I travel some to minister so I have to put make sure they're good they're set they're ready they know this is a family thing I'm not just going off say see no and my wife has to be in her position because she's got to take care of the kids you think you think about sister Branham I think it was a sermon I was just listening to today which is choosing of a bride I think he says he hadn't hardly been home for 15 years he said she's Snow White hair is gone because of the stress you think my goodness if you were too carnal you look at that say my goodness that guy needs to take care of his family better but he was in his position and she was in hers so we have a baseline in the scriptures of what our positions are and then from that each is different for each individual all right next slide if all of this comes into place the balance of the home the home is balanced it's beautiful Harmony next one but I would have you know that the head of man is Christ now this is the format this is the format of a family but whatever you know the head of every man is Christ the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God there are certain things now remember what I just said I just said that there's a baseline in the description for our positions now God's not going to ever ask you to do anything that doesn't line up with his word okay you understand that but brother Isaac here I'm called to the ministry the minister brother Isaac is not but that doesn't mean he has to be ministered to be in his position he has his position Caleb was called to the mountain Manasseh to the plains positions okay so when you're when you have the position that you're supposed to hold God will call you two certain things certain things by your personalities now brother Branham talks about he says he's talking to or they're talking about he's talking about a strain in the family he's specifically is an example of a young man and his family and different things and the strain in the family was that they just couldn't say they were sorry and brother makes attempts he says no matter how perverted you get that'll stay in your flesh okay so I'm laying a little Foundation here very well something I'm about to say so there's strains in your flesh there's there's gold veins right hidden things from your family that are in you you know we laugh about Irish German but it's true its personalities now the holy spirit gives you the ability to control those personalities but not in the fact that I have the Holy Ghost I can now do whatever I want I can cross those no if you're if you're a man who who who is drawn to to to you know anger and height don't take up boxing don't start taking up finding because you're gonna you're gonna gravitate to that side of you so that's not for you some guys can box every day of their life and never face them I don't okay whatever boxing baby was the wrong example but guys can do so and never phase them some guys can can get into hunting and fishing no problem of the guys there's a there's a there's a channel in them where where the men in the family all the way back years and years and years and years like to just neglect their duties and just be out fishing and hunting you're gonna have to control that okay so now women can have can have the tendency to lead because you have to lead your children children you got to sell that little boy you straighten up right you got to be you can be a leader of your home in your position so if a woman has a tendency to be a strong leader she has to watch where she positions herself in the home for example this is strict example it says each family on their own each unit on their own you have personality traits you have to be cautious of okay some families some couples it's okay if she does the budget but men you have to know where the money's at and what's going on because that's your position you're a man that's the economics of the home we don't want the CEO not knowing what's going on right he gets annual or quarterly reports where the money's being spent he knows where money is going he has to because he's in charge of the ship so maybe she does the books whatever I was going to be very transparent and bless my wife that can't work in our home my wife starts doing the budget if you're not careful what happens is then you say oh honey how much money can I have wow that is a terrible situation being because she is in the leadership position now for you they say well I you know finances isn't my weakness then make it your is it my strength then make it your strength there's books there's things you can do I had to I didn't know a sweet clue about money when I got married and I let my wife do the budgeting and it caused contention and resentment in our marriage to where she was more in charge in charge I don't know like using that word because it's so she was in the leadership role I am I'm a software developer for Cisco I don't have us a clue what they spent I don't need to know because they are my leadership if I knew more about the money than they did they would be under my leadership you see what I'm getting with this so we have to make sure are there things in our home that that we need to balance out you say well maybe maybe she's you know she can do the the majority of it but she's working the budget under your leadership no honey I think we ought to put more money here this month less money here and I'm sorry you wanted to to do this over here but we ought to do that here because you're the one in charge and you need to know what's going on you need to have a trajectory for the future because finances is one of I'm going to steal brother Jack Duff's thing here is one of the four tires of marriage is finances and if you've got a flat tire it's really hard to drive somewhere okay he puts the four tires as finances emotional mental physical spiritual last quote here I think it's the last quote Yeah they will love him love his and will have his potentials for he is their head and they are his subjects subject to his head headship of Christ was his notice what Harmony now I'm I'm pulling this this is the spoken word is the Original Seed you think well this is a this is a quote for for a sermon on the seals no no no no because all the quotes are for where we live notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything until scene of the Father the father showed him first see leadership showed him first you and your children to put emphasis on devotions in the morning show them first Harmony between God and Christ see John 5 19 so will the bride and he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death that is the same relationship you have with your husband you are in safety when you follow his leadership men you want your wife you say man I want my wife to be and secure and safe get in your position and lead your family the shepherd carries the Sheep over his shoulders carry your family on your shoulders she never doubts that nothing can harm or not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret ready here's the secret you want to know what's the secret to a good marriage what's the secret to a balanced home here it is the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus said the Lord then it is germanized so the Holy Spirit Waters it until it is grown and serves a purpose that is home life that's not just because revelation of the word of God will bring a balance in your home Revelation and intellectual knowledge of the message are very very close and if you're not careful as a man because we want to you know we're excited about the word and this I hope we should be we want to know more about the word if we're not careful we cross that and it becomes an intellectual knowledge of the message and then our family begins to get neglected now I I say that I need to be careful because maybe that's not a situation here in the church because I've noticed that sometimes we as individuals we can get stuck in the past so I say that because there's a situation growing up where a man in the church put all his emphasis on listening to tapes and he didn't work he didn't show up to church on time and his family was neglected so I had to be careful to not speak to you past the day I was pondering is especially as as a minister you know there's situations especially in your family right situations your children are not your wife is not your mother if your mother did hurts past hurts to you don't get stuck in the past when we when we got converted we got to live it of our past so don't look at your wife and accuse her because you never forgave your mother don't look at your children and accuse them because you never forgave your sister okay you see behaviors say wow they're locked in just like my sister and then you just rail on them because you're still mad at your sister or you rail on your wife because you're still mad at your mom we have to let the past go because we want Harmony in our home we want the balanced home and if we have the balanced home my we'll have some church the home is where you spend every day of your life so let's make that the best it can be right but this gospel this sermon is not the sermon of ease like Theodore said it's the string it's strenuiosity it takes hard work it takes Blood Sweat and Tears but it's worth it we'll use that saying around our house say well for something that's hard to do if we don't want to do it we say well you won't regret it and it's true if you begin to apply what's the scripture says about a home whether you're you know tonight was the focus was on men but it doesn't matter you begin to apply this whatever position you hold husband wife daughter son you can begin to apply the balance and you must realize that all the weights of the bag are the Lords see God doesn't care about our God does he does care but he's not focused on the current perspective he's focused on the goal think about you when you were your worst but God just said hey it's okay because she's lining up more he's lining it with my plan so out here on the other side this is where I'm worried about and this is just going to lead you there so maybe your home's not what it needs to be maybe you don't have the control to be in a position of a man to begin to bring your home into position do you have to remember that all the weights of the bag are the Lord's even when they're being improperly used because everything perverted perversion unrighteousness is righteousness perverted but God uses those things uses those things to put us into position let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you Father tonight Lauren tough words tough things to to take and take home and live but Lord they're so so important because that's home is where everything starts that all starts there Our Lives where we'll grow up and they'll grow up and get married or I grew up I then I got married my life started there am I at home I once was a kid I once was a six-year-old running around once was a teenager home is where it all starts and Lord we want to we want to we want to balance that out because we want to get out of here we want a rapture we can't bring our home into balance we'll never be in our position help us Lord may you just drive that home in our hearts Lord tomorrow we wake up and we're tired help us to to just remember it's all worth it [Music] thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord I pray for those in the midst Lord who Maybe Can't who aren't in the position of a man but they see change that needs to happen but you help them you give them strength may you give them inspiration may you give them courage to hold their position to do what they can to bring the balance of the home and to forgive that would help us to forgive [Music] thank you Lord Jesus Christ let me pray [Music] amen praise the Lord here we see that song I'm amazed that you love me you're playing that earlier wow I'm a man and that you love me I'm amazed how you care Through Your Precious Blood I found for them and my sins are washed they're all washed away my sins our washed away I'm a man that you love me I'm amazed how you care Through Your Precious Blood I found pardon and my and my sins are washed they're all washed away oh my sins are washed away amen praise the Lord aren't you thankful for that you see you can't forget it's the blood of Christ amen that brings you into that position what's that song Alex saying that the other day uh the blood that gives me strength from day to day and forget the name of the song What's that the blood never loses yeah you got it yeah the love will never lose its power okay let's stand that Jesus shed for me [Music] way back on Calvary the blood that gives me strength today it will never lose mountains [Music] flows to the Lord the blood that gives me strength ever lose its power it suits my doubt sad poems my fears that gives me stray from day to day it will never lose [Music] foreign [Music] before it reaches through the high is mountains and it flows to the lowest Valley the blood that gives me strength from day to day it will never foreign [Music] [Laughter] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] thank you thank you foreign
