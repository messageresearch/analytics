spirit s Spirit of my soul sweet over my soul sweet spirit s is complete amen good evening friends it's been I don't know a long time since I was here and been to many other places but we're just glad to be back in the house of the Lord with you this evening are you going to sing again okay and um we had a nice evening last night with some refreshments downstairs and I always appreciate the good music here this evening if you have your Bibles with you let's stand and read from Ephesians chapter 4. and um you probably I hope you've heard many of these things before we're just here to remind you we're not here to bring any great New Revelations any shortcuts or anything like that and I haven't discussed any dark secrets with your pastor we talk about once a month or so and he complains about a few things but I try to raise your spirits well you know him but we're here to to encourage you if you bring into the middle of the road where the light is okay Ephesians chapter four we're going to read two sentences one sentence starts with chapter on verse one uh I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called with all Holiness and meekness with long-suffering forbearing one another in love endure endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace it's one sentence the next one starts on verse 11. where it says and he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity and the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more like we used to be no more uh children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of man and cunning craft ends whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up unto him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that whichever rejoice applyeth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part making maketh increase unto the body of the body and to the edifying of itself in love and if you were paying attention three different times in love the word isn't meant to be a club to beat both people over the head because they're not living right the spirit will take care of that that's right you know the church is like a hospital everybody's welcome amen a lot of people don't want to come because so it hurts or they don't serve enough Donuts or whatever but it's like a hospital nobody's checking papers at the door and we come here to see what God has to say to us now look over a few pages to the right in Colossians chapter 4 see your Colossians chapter 4 right before Thessalonians where Paul is also writing in chapter 4 and verse 16. and when this Epistle of the to the Colossians is read among you cause that it be read also in the Church of the Leo seions and the e-like wise read the epistle from laodicea amen amen so it's all the word it all fits together you know let us pray father we thank you for this day you've brought us together we thank you Lord that you have ordained that we could be here and we can share your word with your people bless those that have come blessed those that are watching may you also Inspire them and Lord may you bring your word to pass in each one help us now in Jesus name amen you may be seated and before we get into the preaching them the word I just want to give you a little bit of a report I know that you people are very faithful in helping us with missionary work and some of that work is waiting for you downstairs in the form of the new seal book it's a new book new paragraphs yes we sanded it a little bit uh don't get scared we didn't change any meaning that's right but brother Branham knew his limitations he knew how far and how much he lacked in you know polish and everything while he was here he didn't allow anything to be printed verbatim you know the the at at and no he didn't he never let that happen uh if that would have been the case when he preached the seven Church ages um he said at the beginning now I'm going to write a book and you know all about the Revelation and so forth and he said I could have set up at the house and done it but I wanted to come down here and preach to you people and get the inspiration okay so you preached that whole series mentioned more than once about the book well when he got done life went on nobody lifted a finger and so um a little sister down in Georgia took it upon herself well you said books so I guess I'll do this and so she didn't have the fancy equipment we have today she had a real tape recorder a lot of work go forwards and backwards and backwards and forwards and type off everything he said okay so she comes up one day with a stack of papers so you said your book and so I did my little part now if he wanted to verbatim he could have took that to the printer and then I had a book in two weeks that wasn't what he wanted I knew him okay and so he worked at it worked at it five years later we have the church age book and three weeks later he's gone okay so um he wanted his work to be understood you know what he said you know what he meant to say and so uh just simple things like I come down today no I came down today now we speak English you don't speak some of you speak Russian or other things but you've got to have it in a word that that makes sense you can't translate a wrong verb anyway so I've taken the Liberty to go through the seal book with a fine-tooth comb and change those little things he came down today cause is because and so forth so anyway those are downstairs and you order them if you need more we have more okay um it was printed first in Spanish now these books are printed in China they do good work they have no idea what they're printing they just get the check print the book so um it was printed in Spanish first I think we printed forty thousand they went through all Latin America and um they're you know distributed here in America also and now we're going to print more of the English these are just the ones we sell here in America and Canada but our brother wants to print 40 uh like a hundred thousand to go to Africa and all these places that some of these people haven't even seen a book in years well let's give them something they can understand you know in their language and that's why I appreciate the scriptures that we have for over 500 years it's in our language it's in a words that you're going to understand we don't have to argue about it this is what it says okay so what we've read here is brother Paul the messenger first messenger he's setting truth into the church he's planting the seeds you see and it's all by Revelation he wasn't there at the Last Supper he wasn't there he was still small he was you know training as a Pharisee but he wrote these words from a very dark dinsy dirty prison in Rome it wasn't a jail like we have today with three meals in color TV no very very uh bad and um what he's written for us here in Ephesians is the the program for the Church of the Living God people like you that want to follow the truth now we've got big churches all of them down the same road big churches I don't know how they even pay the lights but you know um uh they're not they're not getting the Revelation they're reading the same Bible but it's it's just you know kind of plastic but the word is written for elect it's written for believers you see and so many uh read the word they memorize so forth but it's only for the elect of God you see and so um the uh we could actually say these are our marching orders you know it's our model it's our rules now I did bring the level again because you know I don't know if you had an earthquake or anything while I was gone that's pretty good uh I guess the carpet makes a little difference but um it's just a simple reminder it you know you got to stay balanced doesn't matter what you eat or how you drive your car or whatever you got to stay balanced you see and um uh these words that Paul wrote back here are important to us he said let this be read with the letter sins also that's us and so it was written to us also and so we're not just another church down the road we are connected to the original you see God has his word divided into portions we're in the seventh age and he sent us a message to return us back to the original amen connect us with the original now uh some of you been to Israel with us and a lot of times over there people ask us who are you people because we don't look like Baptists we don't look like Pentecostals but we look like the Orthodox women over there with the nice dresses and the nice hair and so if we're talking to Jewish people I tell them look we are the Orthodox of the Protestants they can kind of understand that you know and if we're talking to so-called Christians I tell them look we are the original Catholics we follow the teachings of Paul and Peter and Jesus and that shuts them up you know because they're not so what we have is important to us because when brother Brown had the experience of beyond the curtain of time uh you've read it all and you've heard it but the angel said and um and you're going to be judged for what you preached well if the angel comes and tells brother Paul that tonight he's going to want to go back there and race a few things because we're human we make mistakes uh brother Branham admitted to making some mistakes but anyway he said will Paul have to stand with his people well he'd be just yep sure will he says I preached the same word that he did exactly stayed with the same gospel now Paul didn't preach English don't get so critical Paul preached to all kinds of people brother Brian was way over here 2000 years later preaching the same thing but when he's when he said those words us and many more he said millions threw up their hands were resting on that that you preached you know there's a straight line all through this and so we have a lot of people today that are saying different things in different times but you see in in Paul's Ministry he um he traveled maybe 10 000 miles over 30 years walked a lot maybe wrote on an animal but he had been in an area called galatia and he had preached and been people baptized and he came back a few months later and some some guys that come along trying to twist people's minds yeah he said that but over here you got to do this and that and so he says over here in chapter one of Galatians verse 6 I Marvel I'm surprised that you're so soon removed from him that called you unto Grace of Christ unto the you know unto another gospel which is not another but there would be something that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ we have seen that this isn't some mystery he says but the we or an angel even if an angel comes out of heaven and preaches any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached you know by Revelation let him be accursed as I just said I'm going to repeat for those who aren't paying attention I say again if any man preach that's any man that's not just me or Silas that concludes Paul and me and William Brown and everybody else if any man you see um it comes and preaches any other gospel unto you than that which we have than what you have received let him be accursed that means throw him out he's going to the hot place so we got to draw some lines okay and it's not always about drawing people into the big circle they keep jumping out okay there's a limit you know and so we have this filter here to go by yes if it doesn't match scripture out of here that's right brother Brown says the same thing and so if it's not scripture it's heresy it's just that simple and if that hair lifts you well that's just the way it is but brother Ram says over here in the church age book in every age we have exactly the same pattern I wasn't just back there it's today also that is why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger there spreads of light through the ministry of others who have been Faithfully taught oh that's the catch right there Faithfully taught Faithfully paid attention and so forth but of course not all those who go out always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken remember Paul warned the people back then to say only what he said First Corinthians 14 37 If any man thinking himself to be Prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord not just a good idea not just because I felt like it what's Commandments of the Lord mean Authority authoritative worth following and absolute and that's what we're resting on That's the basis we're on the same basis so he says they add here they take away their and soon the message is no longer pure and the Revival dies down how careful we must be to hear one voice for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of God Paul warned them to say what he said even as Peter did likewise he warned them that even he could not change one word of what he'd already given by revelation how important it is to hear the voice of God by way of his Messengers and then say what has been given to them to say to the churches so as long as we're all preaching the same word it works fine but we get these things that are you know going across and no it doesn't work so what we're speaking about tonight I forgot to tell you Christians on the side roads if we were all on the on the same Highway it wouldn't be a problem but we've got some of these Christians are out there you know wandering out looking for something else you see and so over here in the seventh age do we still qualify for these words that we just read you see are we following the instructions or are we just coming to church to do Paula favor are we coming here to soak up the free air conditioning there's no free food tonight sorry that's tomorrow you missed it last night but um everyone has a place in the word okay God is in charge of the whole program so we've been called away from our hedonistic ways that we had as Gentiles and we are blood-bought children who are purchased with a price and when we leave the blood out of our message then we we don't have much okay so he has called us to adoption from our ways to his ways okay and I hope some of this will make sense to you and God will interpret it to you correctly but um we don't deserve it but it's God's grace that he's provided along the way that's the sign out front Grace Tabernacle we should be you know uh people that show that Grace to others we're forgiven we know how to forgive others okay in Romans 9 16 so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runeth but of God that showeth Mercy you see and God rich and mercy has made a way for me and you to be hooked into the truth not just because we you know like it and um when we get to the other side one of the things to me of course would be all kinds of things to enjoy but one thing will be I want to hear how you made it over how did you Russian people get here all places and enjoy the word you know I mean all those stories yeah this won't be no clock we can enjoy those stories you know and um uh the Living Word has made us and brought us into Focus uh because God has a photo album God made a photo album at your best amen when we had hair I was over to see your dad today yeah and I sat there for about 15 minutes now who's that guy over there and he kept looking at me well you don't look like George anyway we had a good time but um yeah he made a photo album of us at our best and that's where we're going back to we're following towards that Vision you see and um he has um uh called us to adopt us into full position as Sons and Daughters not cousins not Beggars but children with full rights and access to his Bounty and so the light came to a specific messenger in our age in our language even you don't have to worry about a translation like everybody else it's right there in Kentucky language everybody can understand and so he said in message perfect strength here's something to console us here's something that encourages out of weakness and humility God chooses the people to build his kingdom no he doesn't look for the best he uses all kinds of people you see if we ever get to heaven now you'd think that the prophet of God could be a little more encouraging wouldn't you and when you all get to heaven you know no he said if we ever get to heaven if we ever stand in the presence of God with his church we'll stand with a bunch of people that's been weak and rejected and cast out by the world and know it nothing amen well people don't know anything that's you know you don't have to know a bunch of just that just believe you see and so he says isn't it strange that God likened us to sheep a sheep is the most helpless thing there is nothing so insufficient of Defense as a sheep a rabbit can run a squirrel can get in a tree a dog can bite a lion can tear a horse can kick a bird can fly but a sheep is helpless now the this isn't real deep stuff but it's stuff that you need to understand because God is revealing himself in Simplicity you see that's the way God wants us realize that we are totally insufficient then God takes that person and begins to mold himself into that person make his hands do what God would have hands to do make his lips speak what God's lips would speak because they're not his it's not mine they're Gods he begins to build character begins to take this weakness and to make his own self now it was easy to see when brother Brandon was here that oh yeah Hebrews 13 8 that's right Jesus Christ same yesterday today forever okay well I got news for you that was 70 years ago we're the tomorrow we're we're the today now so it should show like we said the other day after where I was that we are what we eat amen I tell you that but you know if you if you lead KFC every day it's going to show right Paul yeah so we need a balanced diet that's why God gives five Ministries that we just read about okay so let's keep going here um so um we're talking about God manifested in human flesh 2023. we can look back at 2 000 years of History everybody and you know boys should understand in Nampa oh yeah God's truth no they're not all cut out for that the Bride is a special people you see and so it wasn't only in the for the scriptural Prophet but for members of his bride that Christ died for that's the ones they're going to reveal him today now Satan's not impressed of how many books and tapes and everything that you've got on the Shelf everybody's got some nice books I've been to homes where they got you know five different versions and 16 Bibles God Satan's not impressed with that but when your soul is fed and nourished on the word and you begin to manifest yeah right you see it I mean you you can talk all day about a certain diet but if it's not showing what your faults are advertisement you know but so um when when your soul is fed and nourished by the word and you manifest the word that's when Satan gets out of bed you know so the body of Christ is edified by the true Ministry of the word Under the Umbrella of the anointing of Malachi 4 and these five five Ministries are for variety and for a balanced diet and you can thank God that you have a pastor that's not afraid to have somebody else come in and say it differently but of a similar spirit you see okay so Saints are perfected by the word okay then we become more closely identified with Christ and Hebrews 13 8 shows so we come right into his very image by feeding on the body word the message of the messenger that God sent and we have a saying in Spanish that when you're hungry I mean when you're thirsty really thirsty you don't care what color the faucet is you just got to have the water so Jesus Christ is reflected in his bride across the world we look like him and um if we if we have his spirit because people they Wonder where's the Christians well when you walk by it people ought to notice that you're different oh where do you go to church what do you believe what we believe the scripture you know we don't have to have a sign on our chest like the people over here at the big church I mean they were on the plane the other day yeah Elder so and so they're 23 years old they're no Elder you know it should show in the way you treat people the way you react to things then they will ask the question see oh you believe the word yeah right here there's five comings of Elijah oh I don't know that a lot of people don't know that that's right they heard about Elijah in Elijah they don't know anything after that so we were not looking for God God is looking for us you see and by his Spirit that's how we respond to the call The Eagle was already an eagle right now I've Got Friends that'll argue all day that only when the eagle came flying over that's when the little bird converted to be an eagle that's not true we have something in us that responds to the word he was already an eagle you see and um so in the Scripture it shows what we should be especially here at the top of the right being of the tree you know and the top of the pyramid and so we've come tonight only to you know hold up the mirror of the word that you can see yourself in the word amen this mirror doesn't need cleaning like the one at you know the house or the hotel it's it's already clean it's got to get in the right position with the right light that you can see yourself oh that's me exactly right and so um we were forgiven and we're on our way to Perfection okay so what makes us different because we have a revelation that we're aiming at amen see Abraham was a natural guy and God said you're going to have a son by Sarah he thought it's the next month no time walked on went on 25 years later and if you study that real close Ishmael was born because Sarah got impatient she had this bright idea and um so when Isaac is born Ishmael is already 13 years old he's been telling everybody my son my son no this is your son over here and they're fighting until this day that's what the big fuss is about they're both children of Abraham and um as we've pointed out when we go over there when when God divided the land he gave so many square miles to Israel and his twelve sons and he gave so many square miles to Isaac and his 12th cents okay but because of the wars and because of all the corruption and all the confusion Israel today is living on 17 of the original Grant and the Arabs want to push him into the sea and America is making some wrong decisions and every time we tell them how to run their business we get natural disasters every time so that's all I have to say about that um so anyway yeah Abraham was going towards a vision it wasn't his imagination it was a revelation and it matched God's word okay so by faith Abraham he persevered he stayed with the original vision and after 25 years he was turned back now some of you might be hearing this for the same first time but Abraham and Sarah were already close to 100 not like your dad close to 100. but he was turned back young that they could have the son that was promised because God said so you see so it is with the Rapture it's right out in front of us we can we can feel the the anointing you see and um the scripture says he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved so we must get beyond what we call what brother Brown calls sense-bound existence that's right we're totally captivated by sense-bound existence the reason you're sitting there comfortable is because somebody is back there messing with the thermostat got it right about you know average Some People Want it colder Some People Want it hotter got to bring a blanket sometimes but we feel comfortable because of the thermostat and when people get married when they're over 25 or 30 that's the first argument the thermostat right I want it this way so we we got to get beyond our sense-bound existence brother Brenham used at four places in prayer and may we lay our tired weary Souls at your feet tonight and drink until we bathe into the beauty of God until we forget all about this sense-bound existence and move out yonder into a place in the Spheres beyond the stars where we can find favor with God find healing for our bodies and rest for our souls so it's not an imagination it's real another place God take us away from this sense-bound existence carry us out there in those Realms where all things are possible yes it is a place that we can attain to now come near to me father and anoint thy servant and pack me from this sense-bound existence into the Spheres where you live and may this be done through Jesus Christ's name that I might know the diseases and the thoughts of the people's minds he was human he lived in two dimensions and that was his prayer May every person in here that's Bound by sense-bound existence only trusting in what they can see here takes feel of smell may they fall away from that tonight and go into the Heavenly realms it is possible and that's why we're trying to say something here that will encourage you to get off of the side roads back to the original okay so we got we have to get beyond our comfort zone see that's comfortable what we're if everything is comfortable yeah nice who wants to go to heaven we've got heaven right here now it's going to get tough you don't have to look very far it's going to get really tough we're going to be out of our comfort zone and you know we depend on our surroundings but we've got to find our identity in the word of God you see and not with just good personalities and religious opinions and message camps message camps served their purpose and you don't have to try to you know smile and pretend like it's not true I know that every one of you came from some place where it was a certain way and we were right and they're all wrong we have that idea right I I knew that as a Baptist we were right all those guys are wrong Pentecost so forget it you know but God's word says a little different it brings us into a reality where we live the grace of God we love these people knowing that not everybody's going but God's the judge you see and so God has sent his word and he's declared us to be free we're not bound by these things you see in October of 63 Brethren preached a message pardoned but it's now coming into effect most of us were ignorant of God's plan back then most were only listening they weren't you know they were they were watching they weren't listening he was preaching he's going over their head they're watching but now it's when it's coming into effect and so what happened down through the years yeah because I I've been in this over 50 years that's right I'm not the young guy I look like and so we built fences okay fences with the best of intentions to secure our pet doctrines to secure our opinions of those that we thought were smarter than us that's right but it wasn't God's plan see and um people helped us to build defenses and um but now it's time to tear down the fences rise above the fanaticism rise above the barriers because we're free the scripture says if the son shall make you free you are free indeed and so we're pardoned we can fly into Heavenly places we can get back Beyond this sense-bound existence get out of our our comfort zone you see um you remember the story about Johnny Crowe somebody you know I don't know the whole story but but somebody captured a crow put a wire on him and had him in a little house had his little bowl of food a little bowl of water well that's all he could do go out there you know that half half moon existence and and that's the only farther he could go couldn't Fly Away but somebody come along and cut the wire one day but that's all he knew that that's all he could do he he didn't know that he was free well the other crows flew across Johnny you're free to come fly with us no I gotta stay right here this is my it's my little world no we're free yeah go beyond this nonsense you see so we can fly into Highway holiness but our journey begins at the foot of the cross amen and if you haven't been there you're not going anywhere you're going to hell you got to start at the foot of the cross very simple right and that's where Jesus Paid It All not just a portion you know and we continue with the payment plan the way the big church uh about you know they teach that but Calvary was a full payment amen and so if we fully repent baptized according to the scriptures then we proceed to receive the baptism the Holy Ghost like they did in the early church if you don't don't remember the book of Acts next time I come we'll start the book of Acts again yeah we need a review you know but um our goal we're not just going around circles oh we're going towards the Gate of the Resurrection we're headed someplace you see and our foundational scriptures Matthew or in Malachi 4 Matthew 17 and some of these places um this very Ministry that William Branham had is still going on is the Fulfillment of scriptures this day these scriptures are being fulfilled amen now I know that some of you got relatives and I got friends they don't think this is the Fulfillment of God's word well then go find him because Jesus said Elijah will come restore all things if that wasn't this ministry go search somewhere you know leave us alone okay so we have been turned and we are the message of the hour today it's not just tapes and books in Bible no we are the expression of God today you see it uh we are the Fulfillment of the ministry and so um the um the truth is that uh uh the message the word is for believers all those people going down the road they don't care yeah people you see at Walmart they don't care passing out tracks isn't going to solve too many problems no they have to come under the anointing of the word but they don't care they don't want to be under the word you see so it's for believers believers who have stayed with the original and not out on some tantrum amen new word right you haven't heard that lately but see Tantrums are when you go off on side roads well Paul who cares now we're going to go this way okay you're going to pay a price you see it and you're on a side road you're wandering away from Christ so we have to return to the faith of the founding fathers the way it was at its Inception and unadulterated and pure back to Paul's teaching because we're resting on that those aren't just good ideas you see so if we look back to the foundation acts 4 they took knowledge uh of them that they had been with Jesus as anybody even hinted that wow you're a Christian I'd like to I'd like to know what you believe I like to go to church with you did anybody think that you were an angel or that you were Jesus Christ people thought about William Branham that way because he lived such a life he lived a life that exemplified the word and they should be seeing that in US you see so um can they see it of us can they say it of us in Acts 11 when the Gospel of Jesus Christ was beginning they first called the disciples Christians at Antioch there was a city that's now up in turkey and uh and so um because there was a noticeable difference in the way they acted they they handled their problems differently than the other people they didn't gripe and gossip and everything they were Christians you see so can that be said of us we sing the song praise God there's been a change in me really yeah I mean if you don't believe these songs you shouldn't be singing them because it's it's it's it's prayer you know put to music and so um or are you comfortable here in dark laodicea because it's very dark amen now it doesn't look dark because you know we got this nice computer we got air conditioning everybody's got a you know forty thousand dollar car we got watches we've got cell phones what are you talking about dark we're talking spiritually because a long time ago 1959 brother brand was preaching in the islands of the Caribbean and a brother uh that was with him had a four-hour interview with him one day and he asked brother Branham why do you say so much about 1977 . I both stay with me this is going to make sense here in a little bit and so that's 18 years in the future who cares but brother I said what I said because as I was looking down through the stream of time which only a prophet can do he said when I saw 1977 it was so dark spiritually how could any believer live in such Darkness now we're 40 plus years the other side we're living in dark laodicea you better Shake yourself and get with the program okay so um there's many Overcomers and I know there's some here real Faith Warriors Prayer Warriors but my burden is for those that are defeated deceived children of God that are living below their potential living below their privileges those that are struggling they're not on the main road they're not they're not balanced they're off on these side roads because so-and-so said so and so because of this whatever they got all kinds of excuses we got to get back to the main road okay and all they need is for somebody to hold up the mirror of the word just just hold up Jesus said Paul said there's no other gospel this is the only gospel and there will be those that come along to deceive yes there's a lot of positive promises in the word and there's negative promises I tell you that but they're in there the one that is evident today is in Matthew 24 24 where Jesus said in the red letters that there's going to be something come along that's going to be so similar to the truth right there it looks exactly like it but it will be deceiving and it's going to deceive everything except the elect of God so there's a number that's elect we don't know how many with the Jews we know there's 144 000 which is a drop in the bucket to the millions that are on the planet but we know that number only God knows where they are they've lost the records now he also says there's this number it's going to be deceived now we don't know how many but it's coming to pass so be careful okay let's see where we're at um so the mirror has to be properly put up so the question is why are we not in position to totally reflect Ephesians 4 so that it may be said of us there goes a real Christian a lot of girls have long hair a lot of girls have long dresses that's right some of them got long tongues and some don't know how to dress and some of them don't know how to dress and carrying Bibles how are we going to tell the difference in the life and how they react to the word you see oh I wish I could live in over a coming life like them they remind me of Christ I see the spirit of the Bible in your life where do you go to church is anybody asking those questions lately yeah you see Ephesians 4 13 is a promise for us you see and so what keeps us from reflecting Christ and being the Fulfillment of scripture in the 21st century we've all been in this church a while we all know the truth we all got at least one Bible at home what keeps us from showing Christianity to the world God's Prophet says it's because we've gone off on Tantrums tantrum is a willful Outburst of annoyance or rage a fit a bad temper now you've seen those little kids in Walmart and other places you've seen adults on Tantrums sometimes they're on the airplane you know and so what we can do is calm down listen God might be trying to tell you something in a simple way I didn't invite you here tonight God did God brought you here you see can you people watch on the internet it's for you too so Tantrums are the cause of physical ills the prophet says God does not want you to be sad that's right it's okay to laugh in church that's right you know this is not a funeral so God doesn't want you to be sad you know what ill-temper does that old temporal that's one of the awfullest things it is about 60 percent of the cause of all sickness temper you better be careful yes sir them Tantrums when you fly loose remember you're only developing a cancer an ulcer or something when you do that when you get all stewed up I won't go back there anymore wait till I give them peace of my mind all right just remember you're the one that's going to pay for it that's right stay happy what did I tell you before make your wife laugh every day if he's only laughing at your stupidity make her laugh you know make him laugh that's your job so if you're sad it's only a small step to ill-temper then it's all downhill straight to sickness and death so stay happy Christians can laugh Tantrums are the cause of spiritual ills then the devil looked down and he said I got up now because see they they were over there on the Sea of Galilee which is only a lake about smaller than when you got out here the lake which it's called a lake but it's called Sea of Galilee is eight miles wide 13 miles long still there same Lake and so they got in the boat and they were headed out with Jesus up on the mountain praying so the devil says I've got a chance now they've gone off without him um and so he says if I can just get brother man says if I can just if he Satan can just get the Pentecostal church or whatever Church you know to start thinking more about their buildings and their well-dressed congregations than they do of an old-fashioned prayer meeting and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and a Godly life and clean up their women and clean up the men make them live holy and either tow the Mark or get out and not put up with so much emphasis on money the first thing you know you're going to find yourself going off without Christ because you've got all these plans and you know Boise for Christ and oh just get ready to go that's all yeah he says brother sister you remember this thus saith the Lord the church better clean up you're drifting too far out come back to the Lord come back to real prayer meetings amen we don't have to we don't have to get preaching every day you can hear tapes every day everywhere but we need real prayer meetings amen okay the devil looked down and said I've got them now he began to blow his poisonous breath the sea looked like the bottom is coming out of it I imagine his devils are sitting on every wave oh we've got them now we've got them to a sinking place and when the Pentecostal people or Grace Tabernacle or Tucson Tabernacle whatever Tabernacle when they begin to act up and their churches begin to act the way you're doing get in a little group of organizations ah we're against that group The Church of God against the assemblies assembly against the Church of God the Oneness against the tune is Tunis gets threeness on and on and on it's just the devil and he says I've got them separated I got them away from him it happens we better start paying attention on the side roads he says you did run well what happened what happened here your women begin to cut their hair and that's the first thing people do when they turn their back on the Lord just watch and then they don't know how to dress right and then they do this and they do that so your women begin to cut their hair use manicure paint on their face wear all kinds you know clothes what did your men do begin to carry on like everything you know loose living telling jokes some of them very not very clean you begin taking deacons with two or three wives all these kind of things he went off on a tantrum without him there it is that's why you see so in other words not following the rules now I travel a lot by car and I noticed it on the on the interstate and your brother that drives the truck the rules are only for certain people we drive amongst a lot of important people the rules aren't for them 70. I want to go 90. there they go and they turn left when they sure to turn right and all kinds of things going on but if you don't follow the rules you're going to have problems see so we get off on these side roads and that's as good as Satan wants it you know he's sitting there grinning yep got him separated got him not following the rules and we end up sad and defeated blindly off on some tantrum because many times we only go as far as to repeat when we should be doing it you see James 1 22 but he be doers of the word not hearers only deceiving your own selves you're not fooling God that's right you know so the prophet says the church has gone off without him see you've gone off on Tantrums my brother as long as Sin is in there I'm going to pound it as hard as I can with the gospel till we see the drops beat out until I can see God's great church with our arms around one another forgetting their differences bearing the sins behind them and going on to Perfection rooting out the Thomases the doubters yeah I don't care who they are that's right oil and water don't mix so when you get all the unbelief away God will come in and go to working amongst you but until you do that he won't do it you're drifting off Amen on Tantrums individually as groups or whatever so what are some of the results of drifting out and going off without him see if it see if you qualify it might be your problem one is fence building but we're so zealous to protect our religious ideas and our opinions and our favorite quotes we draw lines draw everybody out that doesn't do things our particular way the man of God says this great Pillar of Fire the angel of God the logos that went out of God that led the children of Israel through the Wilderness when it came amongst the people the day of Pentecost it separated itself and great looks of fire began to come up on each one of them um uh and God dividing himself amongst his people that ought to tear the heart out of anybody God tearing himself apart that he might divide himself a little bit with each one of us you see what it means can you see why I'm standing for the unity of every Church comma every Full Gospel Church every believer yeah well that narrows down real quick standing for the unity of every believer of the word we ought to we have one heart one mind one Accord no matter how much we differ in Scripture that might be look I love Paul and and Sharia but if I lived in a you know in the garage next to him we'd find something to argue about we're individuals we're going to see this scripture differently than that he says it no matter how much we differ in the scriptures one might see it this way has nothing to do with it but in principle we understand is one Great Mighty Army of God marching on because each one of you in your peculiarity we are peculiar I can't preach like Paul he can't speak Spanish but we work pretty good together you know I can't speak Russian either but I got friends that do so he says because each one of you in your peculiarity God has proved that he's ignoring your Doctrine because he gave you the Holy Ghost and the Bible said he gave them the holy ghost that obeyed him we put so much emphasis on perfecting the doctrine and we don't have anybody to fellowship with her because nobody sees it my way yeah so if I obey him in my peculiar way you obey him in your peculiar way he gave us both the Holy Ghost so we have to be Christian and Brethren and sisters enough arm up together that's not single file that's a cross arm up together um and March on for one great purpose the gospel that others can see that Hebrews 13 8 is still true today there is a people that's living the gospel so we need to put the arguments aside draw a line in the sand and go forward this stuff everything that happened yesterday and last week forget it it's back there you got pictures you got your cell phone but you can't change that that's right and you don't know if you're going to live to see sun come up tomorrow we hope we do you know we want to be back in church and I'm going to count heads and see who's missing tomorrow but uh we're living right now we're living in this section of time let's take advantage of the time we have you see and so um you know the the neighbors are watching your life they're watching very closely see how you live with all this inflation all you think we have problems we we it makes news when we have inflation up 0.2 percent one percent oh my area goes crazy well Venezuela has um inflation of four thousand percent those are the people we're trying to help because they don't have the money to eat much less to go to the doctor they've got hospitals that are total wrecks if you have if you have to have a baby or a gallbladder or whatever reason to be in the hospital they give you a list now here's all stuff you need to bring and there will be alcohol and bandages and all this stuff that we take for granted you've got to bring that with you and then pay the doctor no it's crazy this one sister we'll get back to this in just a minute here uh one sister I know is a good Chef okay she's probably 45 or so but anyway she's had a job in a restaurant and people liked her cooking when she made her special soup people would wait in line is to get her soup so she would work six days a week 10 hours a day and for that she was paid 35 dollars it's in it's just insane and so then they had a they contracted her for a wedding one day and uh I'm gonna feed 100 people at a wedding they supplied the food but she had to do all the cooking and the serving her and a Helper and when it's all over they gave her 15 dollars now she was glad to have the job but guess what she finally got smart and her son that lives by other part of South America sent her a ticket she got out of there she's got a lives in another country now so um people are watching how you react all this stuff we're living with you see and they they don't care what they don't really care what the Bible said they don't care what William Branham says they want to see a life they want to see somebody that actually shows it you see the message blind Bartimaeus brother REM says but we've taken another road he never did save Roman to have a seminary he did say preach the gospel heal the sick raise the Dead cast out Devil's freely you have received freely give and we've done everything else except that we've adopted schools education emotions and nomination and we put up barriers the methodists we have nothing to do with the Baptists Presbyterians have nothing to do with you two and the Catholics were over the whole thing yeah they want the whole thing because that's the spirit on them you see so um no wonder you can't believe he says so see we've got too much religious fanaticism yeah it's crazy right here in our range don't worry about how divided the Baptists are and all those people no in our ranks people carrying these same books and bibles right Victorious Christians can live above fanaticism when they take the word seriously and not just carry it around I don't care if you're carrying a tablet or books or whatever you're carrying show the life amen don't tell me how great something is if you can't live it see so this message is our life and people are watching to see our testimonies see if we match up Philippians 4 7 says the peace of God which passes all understanding all things you can understand I don't know how these cars work I don't understand I've got a car I've never lifted the hood we pay people to change the oil you know I don't understand how it works I just know you push the button and we can go so the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus Prophet says and no matter what the world has to say about you work to please God do everything you can to build the kingdom of God never to separate it build it together he says and if we need to build fences it ought to never be a denominational type fence it ought to be a love fence to keep out the insects to keep out the Palmer word he is the devil's number one Destroyer and as you demonstrate the love of God the enemy will have no commonplace to come in and we've got to keep the bugs out in the message rejected King the Holy Spirit wants us to have no fences no boundary lines he wants us to be one in him we are children brothers sisters God doesn't separate his children say I'll give this one cornbread and beans and I'll give this one ice cream and Pie he doesn't do that I'll give this one over here and I'll let him starve to death he feeds them all at the same table and the Holy Spirit should lead the church so if the holy spirit is leading the church we all get fed properly we all go away happy but if you come just to warm up the bench and stare at the preacher well you're not going to get much you know so with the Holy Spirit leading us not some favorite personality or favorite preacher he leads us and there's no respect of persons you see the scripture forbids respected persons there's only one worldwide Ministry not mine Ministry of William Branham okay that's where the bride feeds Prophet says what the church needs today is the opening up of these barriers that's holding them back and some Pentecostal Holy Ghost vitamins poured back in the church then it will change the atmosphere so if we turn off the air conditioner the atmosphere is going to change some people are going to fall asleep others can be oh I wish you guys do something you know but if we change the atmosphere to 72 degrees Smile everybody wakes up it's true okay so yeah we um we know that God is leading us so in the correct atmosphere love fences go up and Satan is uncomfortable he moves away and one reason we have these barriers is we've been focusing on our differences now I wouldn't want to be a policeman because where are you going to start all these people committing crimes crazy they have to focus on the difference that focus on the wrong things that's not our job you see we don't focus on the differences and we we always see why everybody else is wrong no you get yourself right and everything will look right you see so we tend to look over the ministry that God has provided in the body what's God if he doesn't see it exactly my way I'm not going back there fine go bother somebody else you know yeah so we must have mutual respect for each other and the measure of faith that God has placed in the other individual we're not all the same we don't understand things the same you know you notice that tomorrow at lunch so you know nobody's going to take it all I don't like that well that's not the case here this is the word you take it all that's right so um you know respective persons and arrogance are not fruit of the spirit another result of going off without him is Gossip oh I wish we could jump over this part gossip is Idle talk about the Affairs of others that has nothing to do with you it's none of your business stick with your problems see when you open a book you know your life is an open book you've heard that okay so when you have an open book on this page my problems on this page not my problems so when something happens you quickly put it on the page it belongs on and then you don't have to worry about it don't worry about other people's problems I got that problem too so you might think we're getting off the subject but it's like David duplicis A friend of brother randoms once said yes I get off the highway sometimes because all the people I preach to don't all live on the highway we go to go up in the alleys and find them bring them back you see so the spirit of God is always out searching for his own and so we're addressing gossip and um uh brother James over here in the in the Bible had a few nice things to say about that let's look over here in James chapter three and let's see here it's back here before Peter James chapter 3 and verse 5. where it says even so the tongue is a little member and boasts great things behold how great a matter a little fire Candles now I don't know about you but I have found people that at 20 years older tell me so many stories I said you haven't lived long enough to do all that yeah I'll just boast all kinds of things you know verse six and the tongue is a fire and a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of Nature and is set on fire of Hell sounds pretty bad for every kind of beasts and birds and serpents and things of the sea is tamed and have been tamed by mankind but the tongue can no maintain it is unruly evil full of deadly poison there with we bless God you know on Sunday the father and there with we curse men which are made after the similitude of God out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not to be so be careful mind your business take care of your children and we won't have a problem if you can't say something good about somebody just don't say anything your opinion is not work you know it's not needed I've been guilty and so the prophet says you see the reason he couldn't abide you were a lamb but when you became a wolf he had to take his flight nothing wrong with the dove it's you and when you let that Spirit come on you oh did I do that brother Brown yes when you went to listening to that gossip when you listen to that lie when you went to saying well I've got a right to come back and be a lamb come back and be gentle come back and know nothing come back and just submit yourself to Christ yes Lord walk meekly humbly I know that's against a lot of people's nature meekly humbly but that's the way Christians walk we don't join politics because we're not into the devil's stuff you know live quietly humbly gently and the dove will lead you but whenever you get to listening to gossip whenever you go to getting that temper up whenever you go to thinking you have a right to do this and that the dove just takes his flight then you don't have it anymore now she's not too far away she's sitting out there on the limb of Peace waiting for your nature to be changed another place he says now you may have tried to get rid of that ill-temper that slandering tongue that gossip on the telephone you might have tried every remedy you know of but you'll just but if you'll just let Jesus Christ come into you tonight he will operate on your faith and give you a faith that will climb beyond anything the world can produce because Faith or Revelation is the victory that overcomes the world first John 5 4. so we've said several times here about know nothing listen to what the prophet says about that he says oh you think I know a whole lot yeah you get your brain all worked up and it can't even work itself yeah in the computer world that's when it crashes you know because you put too much stuff in you know all the books you know the answers you know the Greek the Hebrew you got no place for the dove to roost but you know it all then the dove can't lead because you know too much the lamb don't claim to know anything it's got to have somebody else to lead it that's it don't know nothing I know we don't usually have a double negative in the sentence but that's why you talk only thing I know is Christ Jesus died to save me see that's God and simplicity that comes back to the very core so we're not supporting ignorance we're just teaching submission to the Holy Ghost you can know all kinds of things how to run your job how to operate the computer and all these things but submit yourself to Christ received so would God be uh welcome in all our conversations let's see brother Brown preached a message three kinds of Believers he could have had yellow and blue and white hats up here and give orders of the deacons to put hats on certain people then we'd all know who the three kinds of Believers are that's not what he did he preached the sermon painted the big picture okay now you decide which one you are and when you get over here eating pie coffee tonight and criticizing they won't know which one you are but God already knows so be careful okay so moving along we're almost done here um would God be you know welcome at our conversations are you honest are you sincere brother Brown says I don't want to be famous I want to be honest oh we look over that one we made him famous oh yeah around the world well yeah we're just sharing the message but we're not into big stuff we just want honest people you see so the first messenger Saint Paul over in Philippians 4 8 rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice and finally brother whatever things are true whatever things are honest whatever things are just whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely whatever things are a good report if they're be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things remember we're resting on that amen did he preach what Paul preached so that's another qualifier for our words and our experiences so don't waste your time on things that don't fit these categories right here the rest of it's not important you see if we can't say amen and follow the Scriptures it reflects badly on our experience you see but your actions speak louder than your words because your life is the only Bible that some people are going to read that's right they're watching you they know where you go to church you've made you know a little something about profit they're watching it's the only Bible they will read so repeating gossip is like feeding garbage to your family at the evening meal oh I never do that well listening to gossip makes your head a garbage can that stuff's going in eventually it's got to come out you know so stay away from Gossip if you can't say something nice about a person don't say anything at all keep your thoughts clean and guess what silence cannot be misquoted put that on your dashboard yeah so these are just a couple of the effects of going off without him we venture off into make-believe land presuming but we're on our own when you're all when you're off on a tangent without Christ you're on your own there's no backup you see and so come back to the Highway of Holiness if you remember back in the New Testament Mary and Joseph lived in Nazareth and they've gone down to Jerusalem they went down there once a year for the feast and everything and they went went down one time when she's about 12 they could have been down there for his bar mitzvah because he was raised Jewish that was the only religion there was at the time so anyway they're down there with all the family and they get ready and they're going home 60 miles away and they come to the evening of the first day and Mary says uh Joseph where's the boy well I don't know I thought it was your day to watch him and they went off without him they had left the promise of God back there you know and of course the interesting thing is that when they finally got back there and found him they didn't say like a normal mother especially a Jewish mother oh honey have you had anything to eat can I get you something and did you get some rest no her first thing according to scripture he made me look bad poor me what about the child it's right there so anyway the thing is they had started without him they had to go back and start over so God has not called us to build fences okay only fences of love to keep the bugs keep Satan out and they won't be welcome but God has called us to be worshipers not gossipers okay and I know you you might be bored but I'm just giving you some truth here that God can can do something and you'll remember what we said gossipers have a lot of free time you know have you read your Bible cover to cover but you know on your phone there's a schedule if you start tonight and read certain by you know certain chapters by this time next year you read the whole Bible it only took a few minutes each day so if you have free time that's what you do um have you prayed for the needs of the church and we come here and here's the prayer request somebody prays you go out and you forget it you talk about the car and the Nascar or whatever but have you prayed for the needs does the pastor need any help with anything yes he's got a job but he might need some help you know vacuuming or something you might volunteer piano needs dusting all kinds of things so if he has some needs but see God has called us to adoption sons and daughters that he can be proud of that's my son that's my daughter yeah prophecies the church was not to be raised on intellectuals but it was be tutored not by denomination but it'd be tutored by the Holy Ghost that's God's tutor so Holy Ghost will tutors children by this book we have a choice every day it's either scripture or it's heresy and I'm here to tell you what William random preached is scripture it's bible-based it wasn't his ideas didn't find out a Time Magazine he preached the truth so yeah scripture you have a choice of scripture or heresy you see and the church will be raised by the word and the Holy Spirit will teach the word not the catechism not the rules of the church but the power of the Living God Amen man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and if we want to say what he said okay over 200 places brother M says back to the word amen so it's not a suggestion you do it okay so Christians on the side roads are off on Tantrums without Jesus Christ but the word goes on a rescue mission bring them back we draw the circle a little a little bigger but then there's a limit my spirit will not always strive with man you want to keep jumping out fine you're on your own so um and the word looks everywhere goes over every Rock everywhere and like the mother Eagle she kept looking till she
