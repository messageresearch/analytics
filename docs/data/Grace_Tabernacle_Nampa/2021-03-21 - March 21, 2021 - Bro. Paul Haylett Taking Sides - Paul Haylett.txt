i can't overcome by my words but yes the word says you have to repeat what he said about you you want to unlock the power of god start repeating what god said about you and you will then believe those words and it will come to life to you amen you know it's just good today to be in the house of the lord amen woke up bright and early this morning and you know just uh thinking about these things and you know this is like the third version of the sermon uh but you know i believe that's what the lord wanted me to speak this morning the others were kind of harsh and judgmental kind of called us to the carpet softened it up and uh brought it to a place that we can all walk out without feeling too bad about ourselves today amen so you know i just want to a few things that we sometimes you know are in the back ready to do that sharing prayer requests and we kind of just go blank um just been on my heart i haven't texted him the last little bit and i should but my dear brother manasseh off to school we need to remember him in prayer amen we want him to come back now when i say this i don't mean it to be intellectual but we want him to come back with a wonderful education a great experience he's got some good christian friends in school and some encouragement so let's just make sure we remember our brother manasseh and then you know brother jason i don't know exactly what happened i've kind of heard some stories but i text him this morning you know he texts me and said i won't be there i've hurt my knee and i tried to get him to see if what i was told was true but he wouldn't tell me all he said was what happened was i was acting like i was 17 and i forgot i was 47. so anyway let's pray for brother jason he's uh kind of twisted his knee and and that's bothering him today so um we just want to remember him in prayer sister rachel i trust that you're having a lovely time here with family god bless you this time here you know it passes so quickly it just the scripture says our life is but a vapor you know sometimes if you're you might say on holiday you really really experience that vapor because what seems like oh it'll be wonderful we'll have these days together and then they're gone and but god's good and um you know all of all of the blessings that he pours out upon us i i would not trade one of them sometimes we say if i had known when i was young what i know now but you see this is the journey and you can take that in the natural certainly you know i say this jokingly but i i hope you understand the merit of that if we had that kind of wisdom we'd all just bought up all the real estate we could have bought up but you see we don't and we can't go back nor the truth be known do we want to go back because we're one day closer to our lord jesus christ one day closer to walking the streets as it is of gold and we wouldn't want to go back now you know sometimes i i shouldn't but i can't help myself for the annik and sister sharon would you please come don't look at me so shocked you know there's beautiful times in our life and uh we we experience right up here don't be bashful right up front and center you know i have and i hope you understand when i say this that it's in a godly fashion but i have a great fondness for my sister sharon i've you also have got to witness this journey that we all must come on and must come to the place in our own life where we're convinced of who we are and what we were called for and you know sister sharon has shared this story about this wonderful man that she loved this wonderful man but he was all the way off in morocco and you know at points in time it would have seemed almost like an impossibility government saying no more people coming government say this government say that all that matters is what god says and when god says i've ordained this then he will shake heaven and earth to bring it to pass and i am very pleased today to be able to announce their upcoming wedding on the 15th of may and i just would ask you church rally around our brother and sister and let's make this a beautiful glorious day for them amen you know it's it's a just a lovely lovely thing i believe with all of my heart i remember a time embarrassed my dear sister sharon but i remember a time as she was going through transition in her life she made a statement she might not even remember but she says i want to be the kind of wife that my fiance wants me to be i want to be a godly wife amen the word of god says he hears our hearts christ amen that's right all i can say is god bless both of you and we look forward to that day lean on the church can we say amen church lean on the church we make this a lovely day and so praise the lord we give just a little hand clap to thank you lord [Applause] amen mr sharon god bless you i hope i didn't embarrass you guys man amen praise the lord just love that just a lovely time you know part of it is i i hate to admit this but i am down inside just a little bit of a sentimental character and uh you know i look at some pictures as we've moved that have been kind of pulled back out of obscurity and one of them is a picture of my lovely bride when she was probably about 11 or 12 or 13 or something like that and then one a year or so later and then a picture i have of who she was when i started to court her and then the final picture that's there in that pile is her as an old married lady with three children [Music] and she just keeps getting prettier and prettier want to type that now this bride of jesus christ is getting more precious in his sight each and every day that's the kind of relationship we have with our lord and savior our bridegroom and that's the kind of relationship we should be having here in the natural and so let's just look at one another and remember who we are god ordained us to be together be a body of believers amen let's not look as the scripture shows so aptly the story of ham shem jabeth ham looked on the backside or nakedness of his father unashamedly wasn't the right attitude god judged him for that let's not look on the back side let's look at one another's strengths love one another pray for one another amen i want to speak to you this morning on redemptions manifestation amen once again for this must must come forth amen that's what my knee feels like this morning right there amen this i want to take a title this morning of taking sides so i forgot to mention sister emmy i think she must be caring for brother jason let's remember her also in prayer today amen taking sides is just a very simple thought but i believe it will become evident to you in a few minutes let's go in our bibles to second corinthians the fourth chapter there is several verses here and we will just take that as we're going to read the whole chapter we'll take a portion of that let you be seated amen second corinthians the fourth chapter aren't you glad that you have a ministry amen amen every one of us has a ministry you know a mother a housewife may never set foot on the street corner she may never uh do that but she has one of the greatest ministries that was ever given and we see that each one of us as we live our life in the world around us that we have a ministry you know it's pretty funny um you know just to see how things and it can come so openly come to your face and there's a mechanic that works on a certain piece of equipment that we own that brand and we were having trouble are still having trouble removing a part that someone else in the past has halted on way too tight and the man says i will give you the secret uh how to remove that for a bottle of whiskey so we're over there at the company's shop and there's another farmer there that owns several choppers and he goes you know we were just talking about this and i was like what's that and he goes whether your religion would allow you to buy a man a bottle of whiskey and we come to the conclusion that was a no you've got the right conclusion you see my brother and sister i've never even talked about christ to them i don't want to sound boastful but i've tried to live it in front of them and they recognize this guy is not like everyone else not like all the rest of our customers all the rest of these people and that's what we want to live we want to live a life that even if you don't talk to them in that fashion they recognize you're different and i know that you do that i know that your life is that way and we all have our circumstance that we live in our little realm that we live in and you know it used to be at a time i might have been embarrassed uh of of something like that but you know i just look at him and brother david and i was joking a little bit more about that older and bolder and uh you know and it's basically instead of being embarrassed it's more like and don't you forget it you see i'm i'm not ashamed of who i am i'm not ashamed of what god called me to be and we as a group of believers are not ashamed of this glorious gift of this gospel that has been given to us and say thank you lord for that amen therefore seeing we have this ministry amen we have a ministry as we have received mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake amen for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed heavenly father we just asked lord your blessings upon this thought today lord upon the reading of your word ask you to lead us guide us be with each one father the desires of their hearts we ask this in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated i'll back up a little bit we're troubled on every side yet not distressed every side they'll not be one aspect of your life that will go on trouble and in taking that in context your natural life will have troubles your spiritual life will be beset with troubles you see the scripture tells us that we'll have the same issues as the unbeliever hard to believe isn't it we think somehow as believers we have an exemption card but the only exemption card that we have is jesus christ himself amen so there there's the thing that that uh puts a stop to the devil's plan his his program is detoured halted taken apart as a word dismantled only because of the relationship we have which is not just a shoulder rubbing or elbow-rubbing relationship reminds me of a story once a man who is being arrested and uh he makes a declaration he says uh you can't do this to me i'm a friend of the governor and the policeman as he's putting the cuffs on him says but is he your friend so you know just by words we can make claims but my brother and sister we want that to be more than just a claim we want it to be a reality amen persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body of the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body for which live are always delivered live i mean live life live for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up also us also by jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god for which cause we faint not but through our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal we ask once again god's blessings upon the word amen i don't know if you guys ever just have a nervous moment but i just experienced one there or just almost couldn't even read well praise the lord the lord's in control we'll just press forward anyhow i think it might have started when my mic receiver just fell off and anyway praise the lord hallelujah no you know look at this i want to just go down through these scriptures this morning as we were studying this the scripture struck me uh how it is kind of going back as we were into the three kinds of believers and the little chart that comes down we'll look at this my brother and sister and realize how interconnected all of this is we'll see how you know by god's grace kind of getting back on that track again we'll see how it is so interconnected that uh wherever the word of god is preached it will attract and it doesn't always attract um just the believer uh you know sometimes it attracts others it'll track the critic amen someone who has a great need or desire to criticize something if he didn't have the gospel to criticize he'd have to move on to something else but the gospel is very attractive there's a feeling that goes with that a sense of gratification uh and so you know it's it's uh just something that has to be recognized and lived with you might say so we have this ministry and by god's grace we faint not it would be satan's desire to cause us in the hour we live in to become weary and well doing and just the cares of life you have some of those don't you i would just slowly wear you down and to the point that you would just give up and say you know god does not hear my prayer god doesn't really care about us this is just a labor with no reward as it were nothing fruitful but you see my brother and sister we've been commissioned by the word here as paul is speaking to the corinthians he says as we receive mercy we think not and i believe every one of us today would say we've received mercy amen but we've renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness now if we just applied this to the ministry only it would be a perfect fit my brother and sister because certainly in the day that we live in the prophet of god said that one of his indictments would be to the the preachers that uh would hold to the meal ticket of their denomination instead of preaching the truth to the people while they might see that what they are connected to or associated with is not entirely straightforward or honest as it is in its approach to the scripture they still view their 401k and their benefits and etc above that and you know as even some spoke to the prophet what where would we go what would we do well you know brother branham said he would rather eat soda crackers and drink branch water and preach the truth than to have some kind of retirement or some kind of security in a earthly thing amen so we don't walk in craftiness not handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god and so you know it's there that really the only only benefit that we have sons and daughters of god my brothers and sisters my friends only benefit we have is to be honest with ourself and to be honest with those around us amen and when we are honest with ourself then we will be honest with god because we will literally judge ourselves and we will find what is lacking and we will resolve by the grace of god to fix that and so as we move forward in that uh we we see the the effect that the word would have upon us now in verse 3 it said if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost so my brother and sister this is kind of a stark reality of the word of god that and that is the simple fact of the three kinds of believers uh there is the unbeliever and uh so we'll look at that and see his position clearly identified it gets a little fuzzy or a little cloudy when we start to talk about the unbeliever and uh then as we look it into the realm of the believer it still can be a little fuzzy and a little cloudy because satan would come and make such a commotion such a distraction of the human element and you know what i'm talking about that that part of yourself that you don't like that part of you you struggle with that thing that always raises its ugly head and you have to deal with it day by day amen so there's a few humans here i'll just say amen for the rest of you amen but if the gospel be hid it's hid to them that are lost and so here we are living in this day and age that the gospel my brother and sister if it's hidden it leaves a paradox that's in place now you know we don't go around saying now if you don't see this like i see this you're lost we have no right to take that position but you'll find fundamentally that over time if god does not open their eyes does not anoint their ears uh does not touch the heart that man can go on all of his life very sincere brother branham says in fact they will be more sincere than the true believer so there'll be a great work that is there but they believe it's right but it's not according to the plan of god and they will not see the scripture you know you can have a i i would not really like to use the word debate but you can have a strong conversation with someone and pretty much according to the things of this world that say well if you don't believe the trinity oh i do believe the trinity well then why don't you baptize in that because that's not what the bible said but that's what the church teaches so you are off you are wrong if you don't teach what all of this the majority cannot be wrong well that's not scriptural in itself amen the scripture shows us clearly it's a small group of people amen so we look at that but saints we cannot come along and say we're right because we're a small group of people amen we're right because it lines up with the word and even then we can have the word and have the wrong spirit and attitude and be wrong so have almost the whole ingredient i'll tell on sister jerry and i probably will get this wrong but i always mess up between baking soda and baking powder but i remember one time sister jerry made some cookies and uh you know they looked so delicious but they were kind of flat looking and and uh so i grabbed one and i thought man what is wrong with this and sister jerry come along what was it honey which one did you substituted you don't remember okay well anyway she just you know looking up saw the baking and just put it in the cookies and wrong result see so just because we have made something that looks good uh it isn't you know we have to have all the right ingredients we can have the flour the eggs all the rest of this but if we add one ingredient that's not right we have skewered the whole thing but i'll tell you how terrible my sweet tooth is sometimes i ate the cookies anyhow amen but you look at this see so brother branham clearly shows us the three kinds of believers and we look at this and realize this unbeliever as we'll just touch on him for a moment today you know i was thinking in the early hours of today you know in a way there's really not a lot to preach about on the unbeliever there's really you can go in the scripture you can show uh how that this is you know the seed or the fruit of the sun or perdition we can show how that where that spirit started and how it's moved down through the ages come right over in the ark how all of this took place we can do that but really ultimately there's just not a lot to preach about them because my brother and sister it's very simple cut and dried they're an unbeliever amen so as he speaks of the unbeliever you realize that this is the one who won't be disappointed in the life that he's lived in fact if he ever has a disappointment in that context it will be when he finds out that god is really real there's where his disappointment will come but you see he never thought there was anything in it it didn't mean nothing to him never moved him never felt stirred never had an attraction and so in that he's not disappointed and ultimately when he comes he'll stand before god and say yep this is kind of what i expected uh kind of had a deal so he's not really that disappointed uh the unbeliever my brother and sister it's a little bit different story because the unbeliever has confidence in his belief the unbeliever has confidence in his belief the make believer has confidence in his belief but let's get down to what really matters today and that is the believer has confidence in what he believes you see we should not be tossed around driven by every wind of doctrine and and tossed around by everything happening around us in the world we live in today i i think it's quite interesting i'll just bring just a tad bit of a note of politics as it were because i believe it is relevant this stage is set we have taken now i'm going to take a little context maybe i'll pull it a little bit far but i believe this is the crux of all political uh maneuvering in in history and the prophet of god said uh you know concerning say a pastor if you can't respect the man at least respect the office right and so we bring this into the realm of politics and and the president of the united states uh called the president or or whatever you call it ruler of russia called him a killer and so an absolute disrespect that is there now you see my brother and sister the man who knows he's in a strong position has no need to call names to anyone around him he knows who he is he knows where he stands so right there the president of the united states has declared i i have a complex i feel weak and the only way i ever learned to play on the playground was to call names the problem is he's calling names to someone who learned to play on the playground by giving bloody noses now i don't know if you follow this i hope you see where i'm going they now set down in alaska to discuss between the united states and china and the us's ambassador goes through all this very very soft-soaked deal about human rights and trade issues and and trade secrets and all of this and then the trade representative or the ambassador from china says um it's you guys that have the problem you've got no ground to stand and negotiate with us you know in playground that would be walk over and the man smiles and takes it and comes back well we know we have problems i just bring that up because i want you to understand that we're living in a world that the natural types the spiritual the church no longer has a position of authority the church talking overall is now come to a place that whatever the devil says the devil does with no recourse prophet of god said whenever we back up on the word of god we doubt the word we move away from the true context of the word that we have grounded the word and we make it powerless and so it won't matter how much we quote a prophet it won't matter how many songs we sing and how loud we clap our hands if we have grounded the word of god it will become powerless to us as a body of believers so we have to come in a position of authority standing on our god-given rights and i'm not talking about as citizens of a country because a prophet showed us you give up that right and give it to christ so that you can follow him amen so we don't take our rights as it were and so you look at this you see the unbeliever is totally confident in his belief a make-believer is confident in his belief and the real believer also must have confidence in what he believes because i didn't put the quote in here i had to just shorten it there's just always so much stuff that is relevant but the prophet of god says now if you're going to have faith for your healing you cannot uh take that claim your healing and lay it down and come back at another time and pick it back up and expect to get the results you have to claim your healing you have to hold on to that and whether you see something change or you see the effect at that moment you have to stand and say i am healed in the name of jesus christ because when you lay it down you have rendered it powerless you can't lay it down and pick it up at random and the believer wanting to have faith in the word of god in the plan of god cannot alternate between monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday back to sunday and lay it down and pick it up and lay it down and pick it up we either are sons and daughters of god or we're not amen we cannot say well on this day i am and this day i ain't this day i did this and i i feel sorry so i must not be a real christian no my brother and sister you take a hold of that word with a bulldog faith and you don't let go of it and i don't care how many mistakes you made what kind of circumstance you face you hold on to that and say you know what god said he'd never lose a one and i belong to him hallelujah see satan's trying to get us to become and this is where i was really heading in that whole thing sorry i'm long-winded satan does not want us to be as the term we use in the world a waffler we are oh we're strong we're christians we have promises devil please don't hit me again no we can't do that my brother and sister you have to stand strong on the word of god prophet of god said you satan's god is lit coming to you but you just go ahead and take that lick and get right back up and say it doesn't matter how hard and you knock me down yeah i got a little mud on my face i'm still a son of god no matter what you did because i can assure you if we could talk to job right now he would tell you i did not feel like an overcomer that enjoyed god's pleasure i felt like a man that had come a complete failure and god comes along and says hey job what's going on where were you when this happened where were you when i did this where were you job and job realized i am such a small fraction of this whole picture and i want you to understand this morning without taking it negatively you yourself personal can someone say it's me amen are such a small factor in this plan of god but god wants us to fully participate in our small portion and that is brother david brought that up i thought that's interesting amen we'll just claim on that you know it's we got to come our job my brother and sister is to stand up and say lord here i am and all that i am and all that i will ever be lord i wanted to give it to you i don't want to hold on to any portion in that amazing house such a hard job amen our job we don't have to make the promises of god we don't have to make this come to pass what we got to do is give ourselves to god that he can have liberty to bring that to pass amen and yet you would think we ourselves with one hammer and chisel made mount rushmore i have had to do so much to serve god i have labored so hard through the years i have fought great battles you haven't done nothing if you were victorious it's because you said lord i'm casting lord i i read your word i heard your word i'm casting all my cares on you but you know we've heard it many times and it gets kind of old but one more time certainly won't kill us we haul our cares up and we lay them on the altar and then when the service is over we pick them up we pack them out of church with us that's it and of course i fixed it no no it didn't change a single thing because that's not really trust that's not really confidence i let the lord carry my burdens for an all of 10 minutes or 20 or 30 or 40 or however long brother paul preached but i took it home with me because i don't want to misplace that burden you see each one is manifesting their belief you know it's kind of interesting i don't know if it was a teaching or just a certain atmosphere but you run into people that don't really like to hear the preacher preaching on manifesting now my brother and sister this word has to be manifested we have to get it from the page as it were because we will read on this i believe i included that quote that that is the written word of god that is god himself we've got to get it from that and it's got to come to life and so the germ of life is in the word so if we're going to manifest the word of god that means that word is going to be in us and we can say we have the word in us but if there's no manifesting we have to doubt whether it really is in there my brother and sister you can have a planter unit plug up on a planter and you will you will go and if you don't have a monitor let's just say you don't have a monitor you don't have any computer control on that planter the only way you will find out that there was a problem is when the seed comes up and there is nothing growing there so we can make all the claims we want sorry for speaking farmer language but we can make all the claims we want i've got the seed i've got the seed i've got the seed if we've got the seed and i say we i include myself in there if we've got the seed it will show itself it will come to life it will be manifested it will come out of the soil as it were in the light of the sun and it will grow and it will prove that it's a true seed and not something else amen the cockle burn no matter how much it says i am corn i am corn i am corn the kuckleberg can never be corn and ultimately the cockle burn no matter how well it fit into the field how green it looked like everything else will produce cuckleber and it always amazes me when people say i don't like it i don't you know when when the preacher starts to preach on manifesting i don't like to hear that well my brother and sister something's wrong because i asked the lord continually let me manifest your life let me manifest your nature let it not be paul with the world seas but it let it be jesus christ that they see and if god didn't mean it he sure wouldn't included it in the word and we'll get to that in a minute amen he goes on in verse 5 says we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus saith for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ now i want you to look at this this is an incredible powerful brother and sister past tense statement yes sir this is not future tense are you with me for god who commanded that's not a future he commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts half shine my brother and sister a searchlight let me use that for an example a searchlight only shines where it is pointed now where did god shine this he said he didn't say this life that i have shined in your intellect in your brain he didn't say i uh put it into your reasoning i put it into your job i put it into your education he said this light that has shined into your heart now i want you to catch this i hope that you do here look at this he shined it into our hearts because that's where the knowledge of the glory of god was at he couldn't shine it anywhere else but when he shined it into our hearts there's where the knowledge was it was reserved down in the heart of man and the word now shining on that light come to pass now we obviously have to use our intellect we think about it we read it we hear it we do these things but understanding of the word the manifestation of the word doesn't start in the mind it has to start in the heart and so there in the heart the light is shining this great beam of light is shining down into the heart and something inside that heart says you know what there's got to be more to god there's got to be more than what i have there's got to be more to this life that i'm living there's got to be more why am i yearning why am i hungry there must be more and the light is shining and the knowledge is coming to light amen let me give you another farmer example if i can saints sometimes we carry seed from year to year and many times i will take seed out of those previous year's seed and i'll take an egg carton and i'll put cotton balls in it kids have you done that maybe we could do a little church experiment something for you for young peoples or something here but you take a cotton ball you put it in egg carton can't be one of them cardboard ones that won't work you'll just end up with a big soggy mess got to be a styrofoam one plastic one and you take a corn seed and you poke a hole in the cotton ball and you get it down in that bottom put that corn seed in there and get it wet don't fill it full of water just get it wet make sure it stays wet and that that right there not even in the earth will sprout and start to grow but you see you will never produce an era corn from an egg carton totally incapable neither will you germinate a seed and when it breaks through the soil put it into complete darkness and expect it to grow these are natural laws of nature that come right over into the spiritual world so you can be ignited an unbeliever can at some point in his life find a tad bit of inspiration but when it's put back into the darkness it will not grow make believer can sprout start to look like a corn plant but with no good soil the cares of life the scripture says choke it out and the thistle and all of that and it dies out my brother and sister how blessed we are can someone say thank you lord how blessed we are that not only was that seed of life placed in you and i god said i'm gonna plant it in good soil i'm not going to plant you in some styrofoam environment i'm not going to just give you a little drop of moisture here and there to kind of fool you into thinking but he said i'll plant you into the good soil of this gospel and i will bring you to life and i will produce a seed in you i will manifest the very life that is in me in you and you will come to fruition hallelujah it's just that simple but the devil makes it a whole complex thing about this person said and that person did and i disagree on doctrine here so i'm just leaving you know go look what the prophet of god talks about the queen of sheba he's there talking about her and he says you know she didn't come and say well now i'm going to go up there and pitch my tent and i'm going to go listen to him preach i'm going to listen to solomon and when he says one thing i don't like i'm packing my stuff up and i'm leaving no what did she do she said i'm here to prove whether this is the truth or not and if it's the truth i can't be driven from it amen got your enunciation wrong got your punctuation wrong william branham couldn't have been a prophet he was ignorant and unlearned praise the lord praise the lord yeah but did you know i have this on good authority one having been there in brother branham's library and through friendship with brother george brother branham had dictionaries and lexicons and theosauruses and dinosaurs and he didn't just ignorantly plow into these things without revelation without the searchlight zeroing in on the scene so i was looking up some words i won't go into the whole thing today i was looking up some words early this morning different things just kind of curious what the how the word broke down and it was amazing because these are all you know christian websites christian deals and and you know they want to take it all over the board have taken to greek you have to take it to this have to take it to that and ultimately my brother and sister it all comes back and every one of their definitions of that lacked any real spiritual spark they had rendered it down to just simply the use of a word well i'm telling you my brother and sister the use of the word is fine but it's gotta have life in it so see it shined in our hearts to give light to the knowledge of the glory of god in the heart amen fits right to the word right that line shine out of darkness shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ i say thank you lord the light has shined amen the world's still running around in circles just talking to an individual the other day you know and you just kind of it breaks your heart to to hear people sincere people say i just want to be in the will of god stirs my heart sister jerry knows who i'm talking about i want to be in the will of god and i'm not being judgmental jerry and i are not done with this lady yet we'll just keep talking to her a little here a little there we have our opportunities but you see my brother and sister the light has shown in you that we recognize god's will is his word so we can't counter dick the word and then say i want god's will i want god's will all the time contradicting his word it will be by revelation it'll be by the shining of that light that an individual will realize while i was wanting god's will as it were a voice to tell me what to do i didn't realize it was already here it's already given to me see how blessed we are we are absolutely blessed beyond measure and i'm afraid saints sometimes we just don't realize how blessed we are amen troubled on every side yet not distressed why because we are anchored in jesus we trust him we can be perplexed but not in despair and i'll tell you my brother and sister you can be perplexed this age that we live in is more than enough to perplex a person amen hallelujah here again don't mean to go into the politics but just so you'll all feel good about this you're going to get a stimulus check some of you already got a stimulus check you got a how many dollar stimulus checked fourteen hundred dollars direct cost almost six thousand long-term cost almost sixteen thousand there's no money in the united states budget to back it up they just printed it right exactly and they'll throw you in prison for just printing money so what we recognize is just printing money is a criminal thing so we have nothing more saints i hope you get this we got nothing more than a bunch of criminals running our nation and we expect a godly result remember out of out of proverbs the other night amen a king that rules in unrighteousness god judged them see where we're headed did the prophet of god not tell us this is where we're headed this is a sign of our time now don't get all shook up get nervous and start building a concrete bunker underground somewhere my brother and sister it's time the scripture says when you see this happening look up look up the redemption of our lord is near hallelujah now don't get all caught up in that because that might be i can show you the quote where brother brown says that might be 40 50 60 or a hundred years 2065's a long ways off if we lived that long would we still believe there's the answer it's not a fight about what we believe here and what they believe there and what this is will you amen will you and i still believe no matter what we face there's the real battle some have already given up yes some have selected the alternative some have watered it down some will stand verse 11 said for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made my goodness even the scripture is going to force us to face up to this manifest thing amen might be made manifest in our mortal flesh now a simple definition of manifest is on display so it won't do any good my brother and sister to say i believe this message and i'm speaking that in a broad very broad context okay it won't do you a bit of good to say i believe this message and it never come on display if we believe this it will it must absolute must come on display so we can we can fool ourselves right i'm quite fond of that phrase you know it says call no man a fool but i i'm quite fond to repeat to you that the man who's the biggest fool is the fool who fools himself you don't have to worry about some of these preachers going out here and deceiving people they've already settled into their rut and you couldn't move them if you had dynamite a bulldozer this is how i see it well that's good but what does the word say and how did god see it amen that's good my brother and sister but we have to do it we have to have it on display now display is not secret hidden as it were in the safe at home or under the rug or in the back room or a closet or whatever but that's out where someone can actually recognize that this person here and that's the only reason i shared that deal about what those men are saying and that's my heart's desire not to be ashamed of what i believe but to stand solid that they recognize this guy wouldn't buy us a bottle of whiskey no matter what we did but they just view it as religion see they don't come along his relationship with jesus christ would not let him do this it's religion well i'm sorry religions are covering oh and if you have a problem with that just go into your message and listen how many times brother branham says oh i feel so religious right now you know what he's saying i've stepped into my theological robe and i've got intellectual understanding on this side and i've got knowledge on this side no sir he's saying i feel so religious because my covering right now is the holy ghost it's god right here in our midst right here in these four walls it's god right here in church with us and i'm covered i'm surrounded i'm wrapped up hallelujah he's not talking about how it just feels so religious come on come on my brother and sister well one we'd know that'd be totally out of context with elijah calling that's right we'll talk about continuity here in just a few minutes okay amen now let's let's move right along here in the message absolute see god separating himself god first in a great pillar of fire god manifested in a human body now god's separating himself among his people you follow that yes sir that's right come on yes sir it's right there those three lines right there contain a whole revelation that a lot of people can't get god come down then he separated himself among his people now i hope i'm not speaking to anybody in this church or anybody that might listen to this but if you don't think god's not amongst his people then you believe contrary to this quote because the prophet of god says god separated himself that means individual portion upon his people oh no we just go to church and we praise god but you know the holy spirit yeah well the prophet of god said it's all the same thing come on let's not just pick our little part of the message we want to quote say only what the prophet of god said come on i'm not picking on nobody i want you to catch this you've got to say it you've got to take the whole picture that's what happened to the bible as they started cherry picking the bible amen to take what portion satisfied them and fit their world and my brother and sister that spirit come right over in the message a prophet of god preached these things that god laid upon his heart and that spirit that was in denomination that caused so many different denominations come right over in the message and they started cherry picking the message and it was there and then they hold up their portion and say say only what the prophet said well hello i've got 1200 sermons i can tap into and i want to find continuity from the beginning to the end i want to find the mind of god through the whole message if i can just share another little analogy sorry i'm so full of them this morning but years ago i had a load on i was headed to a place in california and these guys were just cursing like all get out on the on the cb at each other and whatever else and finally i just chimed in and i said you know what uh it's just or it's just terrible listening to you guys sound like a bunch of children and um you know i i saw a sign it said susanville going to susanville california susanville i flipped the blinker off and i thought i'm done with listening to these guys you know and that could have just shut the cb off and this guy chimed on and he says hey there taylor truck you don't want to take that route and i said it gets to susanville it's good enough for me i remember this spiritually saints i got that exit started driving off through the forest beautiful beautiful country nine percent great ahead lousy then a sign said nine percent grade ahead what i didn't know is on the sierra nevadas you know you have all these little finger mountains coming off and i climbed up and went down every single one of them i made it to susanville praise the lord i'm going to make a rapture but brother david and i was just talking about this in the back room this morning oh to god i had come to the lord as a child that's it and not drove up them and down them and around them and through them that i had just received the holy ghost as a child and said lord i'm going to trust you i'm going to walk with you but you see i ended up here and i believe with all of my heart i'm going to end up in a rapture hallelujah the road's been a little rough and rocky and a little steep and a little twisty and a little windy later on when i had loaded right in that same area a little farther down the mountain in the flatlands there and i was headed back to idaho i took the other road do you know the other road just as flat as this floor and goes over and you get on the freeway what took me six hours over here took me an hour and 30 minutes over here come on i hope you catch the spiritual and natural of this i'm going to make it all right but what price do i pay i can tell you you know in the trucking business brother trevor know this brother vasily would know this fuel is a huge issue i remember i burnt about that much fuel getting on the freeway and getting from the freeway to susanville i burned a half a tank one decision cost me hundreds of dollars in the natural and it costs us in the spiritual when we don't listen to the lord i'm gonna do it my way i don't care what you think i'm going to go there children wipe that from your memory the pillar of fire breaking up and sitting upon each of them like forked licks of blazes cloven tongues set upon them forks of fire clothing tongues like fire set upon each of them and they were all filled with that and began to speak with tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now you see we are not a divided people now i want to throw this out can we can go and search it right now if you would want but the prophet of god said there's only one unity and that's in the word of god this might sound a little blunt i don't mean it to be but nowhere does he say it's unity and music it's unity in this it's unity in that he said it's unity comes by the word of god now we're not speaking down to nobody but i want to just drive that home to your church that it no matter how much singing we do it will not bring a unity because a prophet god said that unity comes through the word amen hallelujah amen now you see we're not a divided people we've got to be in unity because because each one of us is holding a part of god come on this is not just a holy ghost swept through the building and left us all high and dry i hold you hold a part of god he lives in us and then to hear somebody say well i you know i don't know that god is present they're telling you more than they realize learn one not studying the message not reading their bible because you can't hold the part of god and then declare he's not here it's that simple you can't have the spirit of god the holy ghost and then say he's not here and we must come together and then the pillar of fire is manifest in the wholeness in the fullness of it when his church sets together in heavenly places then the fullness of the power of god is in his church each one of us holding spiritual gift in spiritual offices coming together brings that pillar of fire back again every little portion young people you are not excluded every single one of us our portion we have to come into unity to bring this pillar of fire the presence of almighty god people say well what's happening around our church what's happening around the world around the united states whatever it might be we don't seem to have god moving well i'll tell you what my brother and sister the basic uni unity of the body of christ it starts not i'm not talking in the family level okay we've moved up it starts right in the local church and we have no unity in the local church god's not going to come in and force his way he wants to walk into an atmosphere amen reminds me of a story about a couple quite a few years ago church back east a shame around the message people talk about divorce and talk about i'm gonna leave you and talk about all this kind of nonsense made a vow before god you made a pledge you do that and then you back on it you'll back away from any pledge in life this couple got to where they couldn't even hardly stand each other finally the man got over his pride and he went to his pastor and he said pastor i don't mean to shock you or anything but me and the wife are just right on the verge of divorce pastor was like i noticed come on saints scripture says whatever is done in secret will be made open don't even bother trying to hide it well we're proud people i can't tell you how many times i've heard that spoke to me we're a proud people we'll get over your pride amen it's on the stock market it's got like zero value get a truckload of pride go try and sell somebody pastor was like yeah so what's the story i come home from work the kids are filthy the house is filthy no food have to wait she grumbles and this this and he said i'm just tired of sick and tired of it i won't put up with it pastor son okay okay so a little more difficult for you what's your part of it well i mean i go to work i earn a living for her i i buy what we need on our deal pastor says when's the last time you said i love you well i can't even say i love you to her i'm so angry what do i do pastor what do i do do you have enough confidence in me to listen man thought about it for a few minutes says well you've been my pastor for like 25 years i guess i should on your way home from work you pull in there see i have an exemption card because i work just right by the house sister jerry just went on your way home from work you pull in there what does she like she like chocolates yeah she likes buy her some chocolates when you walk in the door you don't ask what's for supper you don't ask about or make a declaration about the house or this or that the minute you see her you go up there and you hinder these chocolates say thank you for being my wife the man's like that's ridiculous you told me you would trust me so he comes home from work that day and he carries this box of chocolates in there and his wife's in there and house is a mess it's a pig style just ripped up and kids running everywhere like wild indians i'm not talking about any of your families he hands her this box of chocolates he says thank you for being my wife she reached out and took them chocolates i don't even like that kind he's like calls the pastor up man she took my chocolates and she just threw him to the other end of the living room and said awesome she did take him out of your hand right yeah praise the lord what do i do pastor tomorrow you buy her flower you know this true story saints i'm not just giving you some deal two months two months one day comes in with a bouquet of roses and he hands them to her she stands there looks at him she starts crying and they just slide out of her hand to the floor and she says what are you trying to do to me but he came home the next day and the living room was clean and the kitchen was clean and there was supper on the table well praise the lord might have been cheaper except for it's not to just divorced her look at all the time that god's given us to clean up our house day after day after day week months and years he just keeps coming back amen with these little gifts amen i love you amen i love you amen i love you you know what's happening saints you could have come and said if this house is not clean by tomorrow i'm divorcing you we'd all be divorced when he come along kept saying and finally the day that she made that declaration what are you trying to do to me he looked her in the face tears in his eyes and said i'm trying to tell you i love you she broke down and ran in the bedroom and locked herself in the bathroom and he thought man that was a miserable failure but as i already told you come home the next day living rooms clean kitchen's clean there's food on the table it was a few weeks after that he got up in the morning to go to work and opened his sock drawer there's a letter boy have we got a beautiful love letter yeah amen lord i love you amen lord you could have made me loved you or you could have divorced me but lord i just want you to know i love you i love you lord with all of my heart i love you all that you've done for me when i wasn't even lovable you loved me when i acted like i could care less you still came and offered good gifts to me oh hallelujah oh hallelujah let me get back on track saints my time flies doesn't it at this spiritual gifts spiritual loves coming together brings the five pillar of fire back again that's what unites it together in our midst that god moves in our midst as a group of believers amen hallelujah amen hallelujah now i'm going to have to just skip over a few things here amen but i want you to look at this that we having verse 13 we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak let me just cut this real short i got quite a few notes on this but i'll cut it real short amen every kind of believer will ultimately end up speaking what they believe they can't help it the unbeliever cannot continue to speak that maybe there's a god he will come to a place there is no god and if there is i don't believe in him anyhow the make believer will come to the place that what's down in that heart will have to speak come on i don't care what title they bear amen well i don't care what name they claim ultimately what's in the heart will have to speak but i can tell you right now very predictive they call it predictive language or predictive response i can tell you right now what this believer's gonna say she's gonna be looking back in the word that she's been feeding on and she's going to look at that and she's going to say i identify with that that's nothing but the truth amen and as she's eating that she has to live it right sweet in her mouth bitter in her belly she has to live it but she says it's worth it because that's who i am that's what i want to be that's my desire i don't want to be anything else i don't want to be a flirt i don't want to be some worldly little whatever i want to be the bride of jesus christ and i'm going to do it and he doesn't have to force me but by his grace he's given me time to clean my house and i've got my house cleaned and i'm going to serve him now hallelujah that's what this little bride's going to do because she can't help it amen she's got to speak what she believes hallelujah oh my i got so many things highlighted here let me just kind of skip on here just wrap this up amen and christ is revealed in his own word incredible sermon if you haven't listened to it lately listen to it it's just one thing after another is just just incredible i have to admit last night i we're getting ready to go to bed and i just started reading and i'm like whoa jerry's like are you all right man yeah i'm all right come read it yeah so the bible is a complete revelation of jesus christ i'll get distracted here if i ain't careful amen brother branham says and i don't have my notes right here i can't i don't have one of them picture perfect memories pray for god to help my memory brother brown said the seventh seal was the new testament you want the new testament to be alive to you nope that seventh seal is closed new testament is closed to you no it's not seventh seal is open because the bible is the complete revelation of jesus christ and it was wrote by prophets hebrews 1 1 and god who in sundry times spake to the fathers by the prophets and this last day speaks to us through his son jesus christ which was the prophets all of them put together now look at this i don't know if you're familiar with this whether you've listened to this for a while but look at this which was the prophets all of them put together jesus was malachi so when malachi spoke what was he speaking jesus was jeremiah isaiah elijah all that they were were in him so when you go criticize those men you're criticizing jesus christ all that you are all i am is in him words witnesses of the words so it is not a book of systems a code of moral ethics neither is it a history book or a book of theology it is not but it's a revelation of jesus christ god himself revealed from word to flesh that's what it is the bible is the word and god is the flesh god in god is the word rather jesus being the flesh it's the revelation how god the word was manifested in human flesh and revealed to us hallelujah don't you love that i just got plum excited studying that amen hallelujah and that's why he becomes a son of god he is a part of god you understand now he is not the body is part of god so much that it's a son a son as a catholic puts it eternal son and all the rest of the churches the word doesn't even make sense see there cannot be eternal and then be a son because a son is something that's begotten from the word eternal he cannot be an eternal he can be a son but he cannot be an eternal son no sir it cannot be an eternal son right all right now see you've got to wrap your head around this otherwise you get confused and say what is he saying you see my brother and sister this is why the prophet of god showed us that it wasn't the trinity and it wasn't the oneness because this was god creating flesh and stepping into it oh hallelujah that's it amen and all that was in christ he poured amen into the church so he has once again flesh and he has stepped into it amen well hallelujah i can get plum excited about that oh my amen now he's a son so much the old word that was in jeremiah and moses and all those words like he said they speak of me why because it was him in them all that true divine revelation of the word was wound up in one human body and god put flesh around it that's the reason he was called son reason it refers father why it's just as simple if you just let god pour it down into your mind hallelujah praise the lord yeah see god revealed in a body of flesh notice revealed from flesh or from word unto flesh that's saint john 1 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us now notice this bible some of them said oh well it's done this it's done that but let me tell you something let's just go into the history of the bible just a minute see where it come from it was written by 40 different writers 40 men wrote the bible or the space of 1600 years apart and at different times predicting the most important events that ever happened in the world's history and many times hundreds of years before it happened there's not one error in that entire 66 books oh my no author but god himself could be so accurate not one word contradicts the other remember sixteen hundred years apart the bible was wrote from moses to the death of john at the isle or the owl patmos sixteen hundred years and was wrote by forty different authors one didn't even know the other and they never had it as the word oh see the advantage we've gotten this day we have the word but they didn't have it as the word some of them never even seen the word but when they wrote it and was understood to be prophets then when they put their prophecies together each one of them dovetailed one to the other amen now there's a few carpenters a few people that understand but you see a dovetail my brother and sister is actually not something that just intermeshes like this but a dovetail is actually cut in a fashion where it's larger on the edge and smaller and when they're cut perfectly it goes together and it can't be pulled apart i don't care how many critics i don't care how many wise men there are you can't pull it apart amen hallelujah reminds me of a statement this guy is on youtube he he does construction work and he made a comment he says i'll tell you what there's nothing like an amish built barn they're the most incredible barns on the face of the earth and he said i would build barns like that if i could do it in seven days that's it come on the denominations would build it according to the word of god if but there's always a qualifier just like but we would do that if if all of our people wouldn't leave because they have no desire for holiness we would preach holiness if they would accept holiness but they won't accept holiness so we won't preach holiness that's a barn destined to fall down that's a house destined to be divided amen hallelujah now where am i i got lost john isle dovetail there we are each one of them dovetailed one to the other look at peter who announced on the day of pentecost repent every one of you be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins paul are we okay i know this is a long read it's a long read but i just couldn't just stop i just had to paul had never heard nothing about it he went down to arabia for three years to study the old testament to see who this pillar of fire was that spoke to him on the road saying saul why persecute us thou me how could he be wrong he never even consulted the church at all 14 years later when he met peter they were preaching the same thing why that fire broke apart settled on each one that's why my brother and sister you can go to the heart of argentina i'll speak of what i'm familiar with believers gathered in little ramshackle places have three or four books is all they have access to fortunately for them i would say it's fortunate to have a church age book spanish you can go to the isles which is the iceland they call it of chile which is the far far south i guess is what we would call it but it's their equivalent you know starts to turn into snow and glaciers and whatever and you got a few little churches strong hardly any fellowship it takes a lot of effort to get there you can go into the mountains of the andes you can go into the forests of paraguay you can go all these places and you can preach to the depth and something in your heart says i hope these people get this and they are there with tears running down they're just saying thank you lord why because of our intellect has traveled before us no because that little lick of fire has went and settled upon them and the word can only take you to the word hallelujah thank you lord that's why we don't need some great big organization to tell us what tape to listen to or what we got to do because we got the holy ghost we got the power of almighty god coming down these licks of fire settling upon the people now my brother and sister when it went out from that room that day upon those people and they were speaking in tongues and acting like they were drunk it didn't fade the farther they got from the upper room this is a life that sustains itself and sustains everyone who receives it so there's no well i got away from here i got to it no my brother and sister that's why the muslims they got to go back to mecca because pushing that and doing that is a recharge for them well i'm telling you this bride of jesus christ will get recharged wherever she's at on the face of the earth the power of god is a sustaining power amen it's not a one time experience it's a ever recharging refilling experience hallelujah hallelujah boy sorry i'm getting all carried away uh 14 years later when he met peter he's preaching the same thing word by word that's our bible let other man's words fail this no man can add to it you don't add no more to the bible no sir this is a complete revelation you think brother brown meant that here in just a few paragraphs this is like the third or fourth time complete revelation it's all like the seven seals the seven seals someone kept saying to me now you the lord will speak to you brother branham when these seals are revealed and will tell us how to get closer to god and how to do it there's somebody it's called an intellectual amen i won't even say that word it's a little bit harsh my brother and sister we've all been taught the preaching of the word teaches us but when we have to start getting seminars and we start having to do line by line and do this to explain this message so that people can receive it we've missed it that's right amen we will miss it entirely because no one went around there and said what language will we speak here in the upper room hallelujah it's like a brother in chile once he goes you know brother paul you need to learn spanish and you need to learn it quick and i was like well brother i i can barely master english he said well i just want to let you know spanish is the language that spoke in heaven he's a nice brother he was just pulling my leg so thank you lord for something that dropped right in my mind and i patted him on the back put my arm around him and looked him in the face and said of course brother you have a quote for that my brother and sister the holy ghost fell africa europe asia south america north american wherever in between i might have missed this same holy ghost it didn't just settle in one spot like a muslim would be you got to come to mecca come to mecca and get it no no no no no no when the seals are revealed and will tell us how to get closer to god and how to do it am i stepping on anybody toes i hope not i just believe my brother and sister that as a pastor we have to deal with spirits where people are like saying this is where you got to get it that's where you got to get it i'm sorry it's not what the prophet of god taught i said no sir it can't be because the bible the seven seals on it had the seven mysteries hid it was already wrote but they didn't understand so it's already there it now takes revelation to understand it what do we need that little lick of fire to settle down we don't have to have a upper room experience where we all decide what language it would be because you see now let me not be rude but i'm going to vote for english some of you are going to vote for french some of you are going to vote for russian or might even be a contest there because russian ukrainian it's close but it's a word off no the prophet of god said our unity is in the word when we get in the word we will hear god's voice amen come on i don't want to be offensive saints but i just have to follow what the lord laid in my heart it was already wrote but they didn't understand what it was see no wonder my brother and sister that people struggle with that they say i don't see what you see you read this scripture and you think it means this and you say this and you say that and the prophet said this and you think is it and and you're reading between the lines i'm doing what my prophet told me to do i prayed for revelation i looked at that i caught the thought that was there and god by his mercy come and his holy spirit fell on him and said this is what it is it's not about just a proclamation but it's about a life manifested come on just go back and read about you know the spirit of dillinger and beethoven and all of these things prophet of god lays it all out there just quite beautifully see now watch they plowed along with that being baptized in jesus name see that wasn't it the name of the lord jesus christ see all those things how it was because there's many jesuses or in spanish it'd be jesus i got several friends here on earth named jesus minister friends it is in fact it's our lord jesus christ no author but god could be so correct now let's just see how this bible was written now say for instance am i are we all right few more minutes amen now say for instance from what if we went now and took 66 medical books i love this quote took 66 medical books that deals with the body wrote by 40 different medical schools and 116 or 16 hundred years apart wonder what kind of continuity we'd come up with uh yeah most of us don't even trust a doctor today imagine when george washington our president about 200 years ago for pneumonia they pulled his toenail out and bled him apart you know we do we wouldn't even stop to put our shoe back on we'd be out of that doctor's office we would be gone hallelujah i might have to come back the next day and return the door to him but we'd be gone let's go a little further on some things we're so attracted to today that's science what if we took 40 different science from 1600 years apart and see what we'd come up with a french scientist 300 years ago proved by science hmm if it's science it can't be wrong prove by science by rolling a ball that if any terrific speed was a pain obtained over 30 miles an hour the object would leave the earth and fall off do you think science would ever refer back to that is any continuity with that now when you drive down the street on the road here 150 miles an hour i hope you're not see but he scientifically proved that by the pressure of the ball rolling across the ground that at 30 miles an hour that any object would lift up off the earth and go away and fall into space fall off into space no there's no continuity to that but not one word in the bible contradicts the other not one prophet ever contradicted the other they was everyone perfect and when one come in and did prophesy and that real prophet raised up and called him down then it was made manifest see so the bible sister ruth if you'd come see so the bible is the word of god amen to some believers to all come on saints the bible is the word of god to all true that's believers you see we get to choose the prophet of god preach the sermon taking sides i'm taking sides this morning and just as the prophet preached it i'm not taking sides with this group i'm taking sides with that group i'm not taking sides with that group or that group over there i'm taking sides with jesus hallelujah look stand fast in the faith young people learn at a young age to trust god let god prove to you his word is true it's not just an old wore out people's thing you know i just kind of give you a little example sometimes how speaking direct but have a little love in it come this morning and there's this pickup parked in the parking lot over here an old fender changed out of a different color and i don't know why people would treat their vehicles like that but i walked over knocked on the door young man opens the door and i says is that your pickup over there and he goes well it's one of the people that lives here and i said um look i keep asking you guys i have your vehicles on sunday well i i can't control everybody who lives in this house and me getting older and bolder said yes you can and you will tell them because you see i can put a sign in that parking lot and i can tow your vehicles away yeah that's right but i don't want to i want to be your neighbor i want to be as it were your friend i don't want to be this the part just come out of my mouth a cranky old man across the street i want to be nice to you so you can be nice to me do you understand i understand will it work i don't know see god treated us like a gentleman all the time but sometimes we just ignore him because we got a better plan pray for our neighbors across the street i want to be friends with them i want them if anybody asks to say no those people over there they're nice they let us park in their parking lot when they're not there they don't call the police or the tow truck on us and compared to the people who used to own that church they actually show up constantly you see our testimony does matter amen you look in the mirror are you listening to your testimony maybe it's time to listen to your own testimony what am i saying whose side am i on amen the prophet of god said don't you talk the devil's language that's right listen to your testimony if it doesn't sound like a son or daughter of god change your testimony and when you've got your testimony changed and you can look in that mirror and say i am a son of god i am a daughter of god then start listening to that testimony amen your own testimony will speak to you if you have the correct testimony or not amen hallelujah amen come on saints we're here we're in the season we're taking sides amen oh hallelujah hallelujah well i don't have no brother jason to fall back on mercy brother jason if you're listening you have been counted absent hallelujah i stand i stand in all of you let's just stand saints and just sing a song or two to the lord before we leave i kept you longer than i intended to [Music] i've noticed in the human element dinner can take a long time and would say well we're only going to stay till 8. but if they haven't served dessert till 8 you'll find yourself staying till 9. hallelujah and the worship after the preaching of the word is the desert amen that's where we speak to the lord and say this meal i'm not talking about paul right you're the one that dictated what you got out of church today had nothing to do with me because i can tell you i prayed half the night i asked for god's perfect will i don't say this boastfully there's not a person in this building today right now that i didn't pray for last night and i don't say it boastfully but in the middle of the night 2 30 2 45 3 45 4 45 i was praying for you why because i don't want to go to church any longer come on i don't want to just go to church any longer i want to go to the house of god i i liked what you said there brother david i felt it was ordained of god see we believe he dwells in here but this is his house hallelujah i stand just speak to the lord today [Music] [Applause] is [Music] i stand i stand [Music] is [Music] you [Music] all praises too i stand in all of you i pray we never lose that all hallelujah i've been redeemed by love divine o glory glory christ is mine hallelujah ain't that beautiful oh my hallelujah [Music] oh glory glory day [Music] d [Music] glory christ is [Music] [Music] oh glory glory christ is [Music] hallelujah you know part of what i left out this morning just felt to prune that back my brother and sister the word says that we have all these things but we have not charity you know what charity is you look in the dictionary and it'll lay it right in there with love almost interchangeable but i'll tell you what charity is it's love and action amen you can say i love you gabrielle is like a granddaughter to me she's heard me say i love you gabriella many many times since she's just a little girl hope that'll make some of you nervous because she truly and my heart is just as though she's my own flesh and blood but if i'm not kind to her i never say an encouraging word i can say i love you it becomes meaningless after a while she herself would say that's just a word he uses but when love is projected and love has an action come on the dictionary will tell you that love is when you're hurting and i do something for you how about we do something when they're not hurting how about we let them know without it being just words i'm praying for you i care about you i'm lifting you and your family up i pray god's blessings upon you i don't have money to give all of you imagine i wouldn't mind maybe being rich enough to hand you all some money but you know what happened we'd end up with just a spoiled church just like it is when you hand your children money hallelujah children you'll forgive me someday but if your parents are just handing you money i'm asking them don't do that any longer make them earn it [Music] is that right caleb he gives me a heads up i hope i hope i hope he has to earn it why because if we get it for free we come to expect it and then god's just got to do this for me i don't have to be obedient to the word i don't have to pray i don't have to read my bible i have to do nothing god should just do this for me [Music] let's project love charity saints love in action love one another [Music] love one another i've got 10 things i'd like to say right now praise the lord service is over paul well [Music] in the morning when i rise let's just close on this song right here [Music] in the morning when i [Music] hear me jesus give me jesus you can have all this world [Music] forgive me jesus [Music] oh and i feel alone give me jesus [Music] and when i am afraid how can i am afraid oh when i am oh give me jesus [Music] oh when i am [Music] oh when i am give me [Music] and when i am in church and when i am oh give me jesus give me jesus hallelujah i just got it through this one last little thing as i say you're dismissed just doing a little studying you can find this yourself go into this search type in eternally lost there's only nine quotes most of them are talking about those people that reject the word of god reject the holy ghost reject that walk away eternally lost [Music] there's one that just broke me down prophet of god's talking about our sin like that ink and he says you sisters know that clorox bleach drop our sin into that bleach which is the blood of jesus christ and our sin is eternally lost oh hallelujah thank you lord there's something about the eternal loss that i can grab ahold of and say that's about me my sin is in that blood and it cannot be found hallelujah never to be brought up again never to be held against us oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah god bless you saints amen don't misunderstand i'm not apologizing just sometimes my whole life my mama used to say paul your eyes are way bigger than your stomach and i have to tell you now as a pastor sometimes my heart's desires way bigger than my time oh my god bless you a note right here okay

afford to go to that camp you've paid their way i've got their letters in my office talking about how they were drifting losing their desire for god you've got the holy ghost there and i can tell you
