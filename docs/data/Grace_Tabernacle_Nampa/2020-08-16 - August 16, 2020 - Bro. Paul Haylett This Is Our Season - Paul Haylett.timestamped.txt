[43:13] hallelujah never the same
[43:16] all the things of our life you just see
[43:19] everything change
[43:20] around you and while the world my
[43:23] brother and sister
[43:24] has become more attractive and the
[43:26] reason it is because it
[43:28] appeals entirely to the flesh
[43:32] so it's there that we have realized that
[43:34] that is satan's tactic in the day that
[43:36] we live in
[43:37] trying to appeal to the flesh make the
[43:39] flesh so
[43:40] happy that it won't think about the soul
[43:42] until it's too late
[43:44] oh my well i want to bring uh today
[43:47] greetings from brother manasseh he sent
[43:49] me a lovely text this morning
[43:51] sister sophie you got such a lovely son
[43:53] i love him so much
[43:54] he just woke up this morning he shared
[43:57] with me and
[43:58] just felt led to open his bible and open
[44:01] to ephesians 2
[44:02] and he said he got really excited amen
[44:05] i'll tell you what
[44:06] just god is good and so let's continue
[44:09] to lift our brother manasseh up
[44:10] in prayer i know you know god allows us
[44:14] to enjoy the good things of life
[44:15] i know that he loves soccer amen and
[44:19] you know they've they've put that often
[44:21] into the future
[44:22] so i tried to encourage him that now's
[44:25] the time just one spiritually dig
[44:27] in dig into the school work the soccer
[44:31] that part
[44:31] of his life will come back if the lord
[44:35] wills in the spring
[44:37] just not getting in politics but
[44:39] according to some people who want to run
[44:41] our country
[44:42] we'll never enjoy those things again if
[44:44] they have the
[44:45] authority so you know that's fine that's
[44:48] fine
[44:49] because they're not in control god is
[44:51] amen so
[44:52] just remember brother manasseh amen also
[44:55] in contact this week with brother rohr
[44:57] sister mona up in north idaho they send
[45:00] their greetings to you saints they
[45:01] thoroughly enjoyed themselves when they
[45:03] were down for a visit
[45:04] trying to figure out how to come down
[45:06] soon and just ask for your prayers for
[45:09] their family the little group up there
[45:12] that god would just
[45:13] continue to move in their midst i want
[45:16] to
[45:16] speak to you once again on redemption's
[45:18] manifestation
[45:20] and my topic or title this morning would
[45:23] be
[45:23] this is our season amen
[45:26] now before we do that i have a little
[45:29] something if the brothers have that
[45:31] ready to those of you that have been
[45:34] thank you to our musicians what a
[45:36] blessing
[45:37] uh to those of you who have been on the
[45:40] church whoops
[45:41] what's app you will see this was posted
[45:46] and i think it's a very informative
[45:49] thing now my brother and sister we're
[45:51] not basing our salvation our faith in
[45:54] god
[45:54] on what man's discovery is but you will
[45:58] find
[45:58] that man's discoveries will prove that
[46:01] god is here
[46:03] and he is in control so if the brothers
[46:05] can play that if they'll just pop that
[46:07] up
[46:07] maybe i don't know do we need to turn a
[46:10] light off or will that show up well
[46:12] enough
[46:24] there was a recent study by the center
[46:26] for bible engagement
[46:27] where they pulled forty thousand uh
[46:30] the general population in the u.s from
[46:32] eight to eighty
[46:34] and they just wanted to see how we are
[46:37] engaging with scripture
[46:38] right and they discovered something that
[46:41] actually became
[46:42] kind of the profound discovery of the
[46:44] entire study they weren't even looking
[46:45] for this and this just kind of
[46:47] became the highlighted study right um
[46:50] when we're in the scripture one time a
[46:52] week and that could be church on
[46:53] something that's
[46:54] pastor saying you open your bible you
[46:56] hear the message
[46:57] one time a week had negligible effect on
[47:00] some tears really so i'm going to
[47:02] spell it out more here in a moment two
[47:04] times a week
[47:06] negligible effect now three times a week
[47:09] there was
[47:10] a blip on the map like there was a
[47:11] heartbeat something
[47:13] happened again a heartbeat but here was
[47:16] a profound discovery
[47:18] when we're in a scripture four times a
[47:20] week it literally spikes
[47:29] but it was literally one two three four
[47:32] something radically happens
[47:35] to this extent
[47:43] anger issues drop 32 uh bitterness in
[47:46] relationships
[47:47] marriage a relationship with your kids
[47:50] and so on
[47:51] drops 40 alcoholism
[47:54] drops 57 feelings spiritually stagnant
[47:58] you know if there was
[47:59] one area when i'm talking with people
[48:02] that that they'll be honest about is
[48:04] they just feel spiritually stagnant
[48:06] ask them a question how much time do you
[48:08] spend in the scripture
[48:10] if they're in the scripture four times a
[48:11] week or more it drops sixty percent
[48:13] while
[48:14] viewing pornography drops sixty one
[48:16] percent that's
[48:17] very important now on a flip positive
[48:20] side
[48:21] sharing your faith jumps two hundred
[48:23] percent
[48:24] wow because you have a confidence and
[48:27] then discipling others just two or three
[48:28] percent
[48:29] that's that's amazing
[49:00] so
[49:05] now what happens if you pray and read
[49:09] your bible
[49:10] seven days a week
[49:16] you see even science will testify
[49:20] of the word of god amen
[49:23] i just thought you would find that
[49:25] interesting
[49:26] just you know something that
[49:30] might stir your mind as you say well
[49:31] what can i do to have a
[49:33] better relationship with the lord well
[49:36] just pick up your bible start reading it
[49:41] it will change everything and then the
[49:44] prophet of god
[49:45] declared that prayer changes
[49:48] even everything so imagine between
[49:52] reading our bible
[49:53] and praying what effect we can have on
[49:55] our own life
[49:57] upon our family upon our church
[50:00] upon the community around us amen
[50:04] let's just stand as we go into the word
[50:06] today
[50:07] just once again greet our visitors and
[50:10] uh brother scott his family
[50:13] amen and uh so that's uh
[50:16] good to have him here uh sister kristen
[50:19] has uh
[50:20] just been overjoyed to have her dad here
[50:24] and
[50:24] and that's that's beautiful amen let's
[50:27] turn in our bibles to second samuel
[50:29] the 21st 22nd chapter verses one through
[50:32] four
[50:33] and uh we'll just go forward this
[50:36] morning
[50:36] amen saints i i make this as a bit of
[50:40] humor so
[50:41] uh hopefully the humor doesn't uh bother
[50:43] you but
[50:44] i shrunk the plate down further but
[50:46] found that i stacked it higher so i'm
[50:48] not sure where we're at today
[50:50] so uh you know just a lovely time
[50:55] to to uh do that you know if you want a
[50:58] natural
[50:59] example of that i don't know if any of
[51:01] you ever go down here to the mongolian
[51:03] barbecue just on the boulevard down here
[51:06] but
[51:07] they have different size bowls there and
[51:09] and sister jerry and i started eating
[51:11] there several years ago
[51:13] on occasion and you know you fill your
[51:15] bowl up you go and by the time they cook
[51:17] it it seems a lot less and then
[51:19] we saw the masters of the mongolian
[51:22] come in and they start with a bowl full
[51:25] and then they
[51:26] use things to build the shoulder and
[51:28] then they build it out a little further
[51:30] they build it out a little further and
[51:32] then they pile it up
[51:34] and the next thing you know they were
[51:35] posting a sign there that uh the food
[51:37] should not exceed four inches above your
[51:39] bowl and uh
[51:41] so you know i kind of took a lesson from
[51:43] that and so
[51:44] it doesn't matter the size of the bowl i
[51:47] hope you catch this and it
[51:48] doesn't matter what size a bowl you have
[51:51] it's how
[51:52] full you desire to fill it amen
[51:56] so you can take their their normal bowl
[51:59] and get enough in it that you have to
[52:01] take leftovers home
[52:03] or you can just let it be what it is
[52:07] ii samuel 22 1-4
[52:10] and david spake unto the lord the words
[52:13] of this song
[52:14] in the day that the lord delivered him
[52:16] out of the hand of
[52:17] all his enemies and out of the hand
[52:20] of saul now you find it interesting that
[52:23] he doesn't
[52:24] lump saul in as an enemy
[52:29] but soul certainly was someone to be
[52:31] delivered from
[52:33] and he said the lord is my rock and my
[52:36] fortress
[52:37] and my deliverer the god of
[52:40] my rock in him will i trust
[52:43] he is my shield and the horn of my
[52:46] salvation
[52:48] my high tower and my refuge
[52:51] my savior now saves me
[52:54] from violence i will call
[52:58] on the lord who is worthy to be praised
[53:02] now saints in the writing of this you
[53:05] could put parentheses around that
[53:07] because this is making an emphatic point
[53:12] because you could eliminate those words
[53:15] who is worthy to be praised out of it it
[53:17] wouldn't change the context over all
[53:19] of the sentence i will call on the lord
[53:22] so shall i be saved from mine enemies
[53:25] but you see it's
[53:26] making a point that i will call on the
[53:30] lord
[53:30] who is worthy
[53:34] to be praised not just a call on the
[53:37] lord that's a solution to my problem
[53:39] but it's telling that it is worthy
[53:44] to be praised hallelujah thank you lord
[53:47] ask for your guiding hand today
[53:49] lord bless your saints i pray in the
[53:51] name of jesus christ
[53:52] amen you may be seated and we look at
[53:56] this
[53:57] scripture today i want to use this in a
[54:00] context leading us up into a position to
[54:04] realize
[54:04] the season that we live in now my
[54:07] brother and sister i find it interesting
[54:09] that
[54:10] you can have a political analyst
[54:13] looking at the situation and when i say
[54:15] political it's more geo
[54:17] political than it is actual politics but
[54:20] looking at that and their analysis
[54:22] is that this thing that's happening in
[54:24] the united states has been festering
[54:27] below the surface for many years and it
[54:30] just took the right time and the right
[54:32] event
[54:32] uh to take place and uh it has broke to
[54:36] the surface
[54:37] now we're not here to discuss the uh
[54:39] social aspect or the racial aspect
[54:42] we're here as sons and daughters of god
[54:44] to
[54:45] dig into the word and to take what the
[54:47] word is but my brother and sister as
[54:49] we'll touch on here in a little bit
[54:52] we'll realize that everything has a
[54:54] season and i believe ecclesiastes when
[54:56] he says that everything there is a
[54:58] season
[54:58] so we'll look at the season of the time
[55:00] that is there and
[55:02] we're seeing how an unrest is coming
[55:04] upon the nation
[55:05] and how these things the stage has been
[55:07] set many years ago
[55:09] and as we'll look at this we'll
[55:11] recognize with a little spiritual
[55:13] discernment
[55:14] how that these things must come to pass
[55:16] for the word of god to come to full
[55:18] fruition
[55:19] and so it's in that you know it it just
[55:22] breaks our heart to
[55:23] to see a such a behavior in our nation
[55:27] but yet my brother and sister as i said
[55:30] it is something we must recognize
[55:32] must come to pass there must be a
[55:34] complete
[55:35] selling out to our lord jesus christ
[55:38] and there must be a complete selling out
[55:41] to the things
[55:42] of this world and so as you look at that
[55:45] there is a real move upon the land to
[55:49] change the face of our nation
[55:51] and those many of them are are i would
[55:54] believe innocently promoting something
[55:57] they don't really know the power
[55:59] that they are calling to be unleashed
[56:01] there it's right there below the surface
[56:03] this is
[56:04] the scripture tells us that the
[56:06] antichrist spirit is waiting for the
[56:08] season
[56:09] the the correct time a book of
[56:11] revelation lays it out so clearly
[56:13] and as you look at that you realize my
[56:15] brother and sister
[56:16] as we've been talking about that some
[56:18] are are there the middle wall of
[56:20] partition has been taken down
[56:22] some are pressing into the presence of
[56:24] god and because there's only two spirits
[56:26] in the framework of the church
[56:28] some are pressing into satan's synagogue
[56:32] and so it is that as they press into
[56:35] that i believe that they don't even
[56:37] realize
[56:37] what they are pressing into now as we've
[56:41] had with the older uh young people uh
[56:44] in these last couple friday youth
[56:46] meetings uh looking at music and how it
[56:49] all ties together
[56:50] some of that my brother and sister is
[56:52] just you know even at my age you look at
[56:54] it and it's just stunning
[56:56] to realize how that satan has captured
[56:59] the heart of generations by music
[57:02] and so we'll find that he's just
[57:04] constantly using that because it brings
[57:06] up something in the realm
[57:07] uh that is uh god created in humanity
[57:10] and we can enter in it's an
[57:12] open door into the spirit but yet if
[57:14] that will draw people
[57:16] to actually worship the devil and and
[57:19] enter into those things
[57:20] how much more will a godly atmosphere
[57:23] draw sons and daughters of god
[57:24] into the presence of almighty god so
[57:27] everything has
[57:28] a season and i thank god that by the
[57:31] grace
[57:32] that he has bestowed upon us that he
[57:35] said that he would reveal himself to us
[57:38] he would lead us he would guide us and
[57:40] i'm going to take the words of another
[57:42] man my brother and sister
[57:44] you may not feel
[57:50] how many of us like to feel
[57:53] all of us we're human we may not
[57:56] feel like god is here
[58:00] but he said he would be and his
[58:03] promise is just as powerful
[58:07] as his presence
[58:10] if he said i'll be with you i will lead
[58:12] you and guide you then you
[58:13] in your worst day the wheels fall off
[58:15] the wagon you can stop and say thank you
[58:17] lord for being here
[58:19] but the human element gets anointed we
[58:21] say where's god
[58:23] well if you will acknowledge and call on
[58:25] him he said
[58:26] when you draw nigh to me i draw an eye
[58:28] to you so we don't have to go by our
[58:30] feeling we can go by the promise
[58:32] amen and his promises have never failed
[58:35] and so we stand on that no matter how
[58:38] i feel amen i know that god is with me
[58:42] amen these are beautiful words as we
[58:45] read this my brother and sister
[58:47] and recognize here that uh
[58:50] david's words they're beautiful words as
[58:52] he is declaring the god of my rock
[58:55] amen it's not another god it's not some
[58:58] god not a part-time god
[59:00] but he's the god of the whole rock amen
[59:03] and him i'll trust and
[59:04] you know each and every day the lord is
[59:06] delivering us from the spirits of the
[59:08] age that we live in
[59:10] now if we didn't believe that my brother
[59:12] and sister then we would be on such
[59:14] a roller coaster we would be up one day
[59:17] praising god for saving us and the next
[59:19] day we would be purchasing a ticket
[59:21] going straight to hades
[59:24] but you see god's not a god of a roller
[59:27] coaster
[59:28] he's a god that starts down here at this
[59:30] basic beginning of our life when we
[59:32] recognize we can't live without him
[59:34] and he builds us up every single day
[59:38] now some would say well you know the
[59:40] lord just kind of tore up my life
[59:42] i had to go repent i had to change a lot
[59:44] of things
[59:45] you know technically now i i know this
[59:47] is a little bit opinion i don't directly
[59:49] have
[59:49] scripture if there is scripture for it
[59:51] to back this up
[59:53] but did you know that when god is
[59:54] tearing you down he's actually building
[59:56] you up
[59:58] god does not tear down like the world
[1:00:00] tears down god does not tear down like
[1:00:02] satan tears down
[1:00:03] god dismantles to the point that he hits
[1:00:06] solid rock
[1:00:07] again and he builds from there so it's
[1:00:10] never a plan just to tear down
[1:00:12] god's always got a plan to build it up
[1:00:15] but sometimes
[1:00:16] he has to take some of that old nature
[1:00:19] from us now i know that he's not really
[1:00:22] talking about you but people like you
[1:00:25] that have a nature that sometimes things
[1:00:27] poke you
[1:00:28] and you respond in such a way amen we're
[1:00:31] all saved filled with the holy ghost we
[1:00:33] never get upset
[1:00:39] but see that old nature amen
[1:00:42] you have to kill him every day oh
[1:00:45] hallelujah
[1:00:46] it's not hey i got rid of that you know
[1:00:48] 40 years ago
[1:00:49] no my brother and sister if you don't
[1:00:52] acknowledge the very fact that that
[1:00:53] nature
[1:00:54] is right there then the nature has
[1:00:56] overcome you to such a degree that you
[1:00:58] don't recognize
[1:00:59] that the nature possesses you so it's a
[1:01:02] battle that we face
[1:01:03] every day now so the lord is delivering
[1:01:06] us from the spirit of the enemy of the
[1:01:08] age that we live in and
[1:01:10] my brother and sister as we'll look
[1:01:12] through the word of god
[1:01:13] i want you to look at this now
[1:01:16] god gives directives to us and
[1:01:20] when he gives us a directive he puts an
[1:01:23] absolute
[1:01:24] in place uh acts 2 38 would be a very
[1:01:27] uh a direct directive uh repent and be
[1:01:30] baptized
[1:01:31] in the name of jesus christ and so he
[1:01:34] doesn't uh
[1:01:35] give that but if we're not careful we
[1:01:37] take the directives that god has given
[1:01:40] and we turn them into suggestions
[1:01:43] amen and so here it is now this
[1:01:46] deliverance that he's given
[1:01:48] he gives us a directive putting an
[1:01:50] absolute
[1:01:51] in place in verse 4 once again to back
[1:01:53] up to that
[1:01:54] he says i will call on the lord who is
[1:01:56] worthy to be praised
[1:01:58] so shall i be saved from mine enemies
[1:02:01] this directive
[1:02:02] shows us very clearly if we call he will
[1:02:05] save us
[1:02:06] amen that's beautiful hallelujah it
[1:02:08] don't matter what kind of doctrine or
[1:02:10] background or
[1:02:11] age that is involved if we call on the
[1:02:14] lord amen
[1:02:15] he will come amen now we look at this
[1:02:18] and many
[1:02:19] times we take the directives of the word
[1:02:21] of god
[1:02:22] we turn them into suggestions oh my
[1:02:25] brother and sister
[1:02:27] you say well brother paul what do you
[1:02:28] mean by that well we'll touch on that in
[1:02:30] just a little bit
[1:02:31] but my brother and sister a directive is
[1:02:34] an official or authoritative
[1:02:36] instruction it has come from one
[1:02:39] in position of authority or counsel
[1:02:43] so you know my brother and sister
[1:02:45] there's times that we would come forward
[1:02:48] and you know take this and if we're not
[1:02:50] careful we'll take the things of
[1:02:52] the bible the things of the word of god
[1:02:55] and we will approach them as though
[1:02:57] they are suggestions now a suggestion is
[1:03:00] an
[1:03:00] idea or plan put forward for
[1:03:03] consideration
[1:03:04] now there is a radical difference of
[1:03:06] taking something as a directive which is
[1:03:09] an official
[1:03:10] on authoritative instruction and
[1:03:12] reducing it down to a position
[1:03:14] where it is put up for consideration
[1:03:18] amen so you know there is a time to
[1:03:22] consider
[1:03:22] look it up in your bible the word
[1:03:24] consider shows up many many times one
[1:03:27] that comes first to my mind
[1:03:29] is consider the lily amen so it's
[1:03:31] telling you to go
[1:03:32] out and look at that and consider what
[1:03:35] is happening there
[1:03:36] look at it analyze it study it amen
[1:03:39] so the word or the approach of
[1:03:41] considering is not
[1:03:43] anti-word but my brother and sister it
[1:03:45] is also
[1:03:46] not got the authority to move you
[1:03:48] forward because considering does not
[1:03:51] bring necessarily a mode of action
[1:03:54] are you with me amen so you look now
[1:03:58] there's nowhere in the word of god
[1:04:00] nowhere in the word the
[1:04:02] directive is that all things are
[1:04:05] possible if you consider
[1:04:12] it says all things are possible
[1:04:16] so what is our directive belief
[1:04:20] there's the directive it's not that all
[1:04:22] things are possible
[1:04:24] if you believe in god you would believe
[1:04:26] all things were possible
[1:04:28] but the directive is to believe not
[1:04:30] consider
[1:04:32] amen so as you look at this you realize
[1:04:34] that what satan has come he's come down
[1:04:36] in the day that we live in
[1:04:37] he's moved in he's come in such a way
[1:04:40] that we have come
[1:04:41] to consider many people around the
[1:04:43] message they would say well okay i
[1:04:45] i believe this i do this and and you
[1:04:48] look at it and this sounds harsh in
[1:04:49] judgment but forgive me
[1:04:51] and they are not really believing
[1:04:53] they're not acting upon it they're
[1:04:54] considering it
[1:04:56] and when you just consider something it
[1:04:58] does have an impact upon your thinking
[1:05:01] but my brother and sister when we pray
[1:05:03] we don't pray that god would consider us
[1:05:06] we pray that god would hear us it is not
[1:05:09] just lord if you have nothing better to
[1:05:11] do would you ponder my situation
[1:05:13] but we pray for a direct action can you
[1:05:16] say amen
[1:05:17] we're not praying a vague prayer of lord
[1:05:19] if you
[1:05:20] feel like or if this could be but when
[1:05:23] we pray we pray lord
[1:05:25] heal this person heal this save my son
[1:05:28] my wife my daughter whatever it might be
[1:05:30] we are praying for a direct action and
[1:05:33] if we are praying for something that
[1:05:35] would fall
[1:05:36] under just a consideration then it's
[1:05:38] because we do not have faith in the one
[1:05:41] that we are praying to
[1:05:42] but if you have prayer if you have faith
[1:05:45] in the one you're praying to your prayer
[1:05:47] you believe as a son or daughter of god
[1:05:49] will be answered
[1:05:51] someone say amen to that i believe god
[1:05:54] answers my prayer
[1:05:55] in fact i don't just believe it i have
[1:05:57] tangible evidence that god
[1:05:59] answers my prayers amen now does that
[1:06:02] sound boastful well i hope we have
[1:06:03] something to boast on
[1:06:06] hallelujah come on saints
[1:06:09] we got to have something to boast on
[1:06:13] that's right i think you're missing it
[1:06:16] i'm a boaster
[1:06:18] hallelujah i like to boast amen
[1:06:22] i don't have much to boast on in me as a
[1:06:24] man in fact i have
[1:06:25] a lot of things i just don't even like
[1:06:26] to admit in public you know
[1:06:28] i buy something that falls apart you
[1:06:30] know it's hard to admit you paid money
[1:06:32] for something that don't last
[1:06:34] amen but you see i have something to
[1:06:36] boast on and that was the fact that god
[1:06:38] after i went out
[1:06:39] and jumped off the high board into an
[1:06:41] empty swimming pool as it were
[1:06:43] that god come along and says now before
[1:06:45] you hit the concrete to the bottom of
[1:06:46] this
[1:06:47] i will come amen amen
[1:06:52] now do we tempt god no but you know what
[1:06:54] some of us were just silly enough we
[1:06:55] jumped off the high board with nothing
[1:06:57] to back it up
[1:06:58] and god still come on the scene amen
[1:07:01] and he saved us he healed us he
[1:07:03] delivered us
[1:07:04] amen i got something to boast on
[1:07:07] hallelujah
[1:07:08] amen nothing of man but all of our lord
[1:07:11] jesus christ
[1:07:12] now as we look at this now we're looking
[1:07:15] right here now
[1:07:16] at a time that's talking about paul or
[1:07:18] saul and how that he had come
[1:07:20] down and all that happened there when
[1:07:23] the light the pillar of fire come to him
[1:07:26] and uh so that is the background of this
[1:07:29] and there was one a prophet down in the
[1:07:31] city who saw in a vision
[1:07:32] while he was praying and he came now i
[1:07:35] want to tell you this was paul jumping
[1:07:37] off the high board
[1:07:38] saints he thought he was doing the right
[1:07:40] thing he thought he was serving god
[1:07:42] thought he was fulfilling the word of
[1:07:44] god
[1:07:45] and he had even slain the saints and he
[1:07:48] comes to a place but you see now
[1:07:50] the bottom being if you follow my
[1:07:52] analogy the bottom being
[1:07:54] that before he had went too far which
[1:07:56] would be the bottom of the swimming pool
[1:07:58] god come down and caught him and so it's
[1:08:02] there
[1:08:02] ananias came and come into saul laid his
[1:08:05] hands upon him and he was healed by
[1:08:06] divine healing
[1:08:07] he rose then and was baptized washed
[1:08:10] away washing away his sins
[1:08:12] calling on the name of the lord and then
[1:08:14] he had an absolute
[1:08:16] he was never the same after that he went
[1:08:19] straight
[1:08:19] from church to church from place to
[1:08:22] place
[1:08:23] trying to build up that which he had
[1:08:26] tried
[1:08:27] to tear down now when you look at the
[1:08:30] effect of paul's life
[1:08:32] those he persecuted
[1:08:36] what was greater his persecution
[1:08:40] or the building up
[1:08:43] it's not even a question is it for here
[1:08:46] we are in the year 2020
[1:08:48] still being blessed by the gospel that
[1:08:51] god laid on john
[1:08:52] i mean paul's heart preached amen
[1:08:56] see not looking at the negative my
[1:08:58] brother and sister but if we're not
[1:08:59] careful
[1:09:00] we can look at one little segment of our
[1:09:02] life and
[1:09:03] we will be controlled for years by that
[1:09:06] segment of our life
[1:09:09] and satan will always point back
[1:09:12] amen to that point but he won't point
[1:09:16] to the building up because if he points
[1:09:19] to the building
[1:09:20] up he has to acknowledge that god is
[1:09:22] doing something
[1:09:23] in your life and so he takes you in a
[1:09:26] snapshot of time
[1:09:27] back to a place a time that you were
[1:09:29] backslid maybe never even ever saved so
[1:09:32] he
[1:09:32] wasn't backslid but you were there in
[1:09:34] that condition and what you might have
[1:09:36] done
[1:09:36] what you might have experienced what you
[1:09:38] might have done to others
[1:09:39] and he wants to constantly bring that
[1:09:42] back before you
[1:09:43] in fact there's years of evidence that
[1:09:46] god has done something
[1:09:48] god has changed god has turned the
[1:09:51] direction
[1:09:52] and yet he will keep us focused on one
[1:09:55] little point
[1:09:56] oh my god ah how clever satan is
[1:10:00] right amen so what does he do he goes
[1:10:02] back to church to church from place to
[1:10:04] place trying to build up that's what he
[1:10:06] had tried to tear down
[1:10:07] how the nation how the christian world
[1:10:10] this morning needs that type of an
[1:10:12] absolute
[1:10:13] those who had creeds of traditions has
[1:10:15] tried to with doctrine of men
[1:10:17] to disqualify god's word to being the
[1:10:20] same yesterday and forever
[1:10:22] they need an absolute an experience of
[1:10:25] meeting
[1:10:26] on a damascus road the living god who
[1:10:29] can heal the sick raise the dead and
[1:10:31] cast out devils
[1:10:32] a genuine absolute
[1:10:35] now look at this we got to come to the
[1:10:37] place saints that we
[1:10:39] have this for ourself that we know
[1:10:42] he says paul knew something had happened
[1:10:45] can someone lift a hand and say i know
[1:10:47] something happened amen i'm not living
[1:10:50] on mama's experience or daddy's
[1:10:51] experience
[1:10:52] or our church experience well what are
[1:10:54] you i'm a methodist because i was born
[1:10:56] a methodist well i'll tell you if it was
[1:10:59] for the grace of god
[1:11:00] what would i be i got my catholic
[1:11:02] background we got mormon background
[1:11:04] we've got methodist background which one
[1:11:07] of those would i have been it wouldn't
[1:11:08] have mattered my brother and sister
[1:11:10] because i wasn't called to be one of
[1:11:11] them
[1:11:12] amen i was called to come out of it can
[1:11:15] someone say amen to that
[1:11:16] i was called to not be identified by a
[1:11:20] name over the door
[1:11:21] but by the god that resides in the house
[1:11:25] amen hallelujah a genuine absolute paul
[1:11:29] knew that something had happened
[1:11:31] there was no one could take it away from
[1:11:33] him nothing else mattered
[1:11:34] he was tied and that was it no matter
[1:11:37] what come he knowed he was tied
[1:11:39] christ centered life
[1:11:44] now if i speak a little strongly on
[1:11:46] these things i don't want you to think
[1:11:48] i'm judging them because i
[1:11:50] in my heart i'm not but my brother and
[1:11:52] sister i got friends i was just joking
[1:11:54] with one of them the other day
[1:11:56] he was talking about a deal and it
[1:11:57] scared him and i said yeah i probably
[1:11:59] scared you bad enough to about jerk your
[1:12:01] rosary beat off the mirror
[1:12:02] and he laughed and says really close now
[1:12:05] my brother and sister
[1:12:07] in a time of great travail what is that
[1:12:10] rosary bead going to do for you
[1:12:13] amen nothing
[1:12:16] but you see it becomes instinctive
[1:12:19] i want to ask you what's instinctive
[1:12:21] when crisis comes to you
[1:12:24] what do you reach for when crisis comes
[1:12:26] to your life
[1:12:33] do you reach to see what your bank
[1:12:34] account says
[1:12:37] do you reach well
[1:12:41] we won't waste the time going through
[1:12:42] all of those things i doubt if any of us
[1:12:45] have too big of a stockpile of gold but
[1:12:50] it won't do any good
[1:12:51] anyway reminds me of a friend of mine
[1:12:56] and and i believe he's right on a great
[1:12:58] portion of this
[1:12:59] he said when chaos comes to the earth he
[1:13:02] said
[1:13:03] your money will be just paper with ink
[1:13:05] on it
[1:13:06] won't have any value and he says that's
[1:13:09] why i have gold and i have silver
[1:13:14] now some of you know me sometimes i
[1:13:17] probably speak when i shouldn't
[1:13:19] but i told this friend of mine i says
[1:13:21] it's no problem
[1:13:22] i don't need to save any gold he says
[1:13:24] yes you do paul you've got to have
[1:13:26] something to be able to buy food and do
[1:13:28] whatever
[1:13:29] i said no friend i just follow you home
[1:13:31] and kill you take your gold
[1:13:34] he looked at me like what and i said you
[1:13:38] know i wouldn't do that and he goes wow
[1:13:40] you had to be scared for a moment
[1:13:43] but someone would but someone would
[1:13:49] now i lay this in place so these next
[1:13:52] few words that
[1:13:53] we are looking at might register
[1:13:57] to you in a deeper fashion
[1:14:00] amen
[1:14:04] to everything there is a season a time
[1:14:08] to every purpose
[1:14:09] under the heaven a time to be born
[1:14:13] and beautiful i look out my little
[1:14:15] grandson declan
[1:14:17] i look at little brother samuel amen
[1:14:20] i look at a little baby
[1:14:24] take that is coming little alley
[1:14:29] time to be born it's beautiful isn't it
[1:14:32] you to hold them little babies
[1:14:34] many of you wouldn't know them but would
[1:14:36] be almost like a second son to sister
[1:14:38] jerry and i
[1:14:40] uh jesse barrios him and his wife passed
[1:14:42] through town
[1:14:43] uh my children grew up with them i think
[1:14:46] i met jesse he was probably
[1:14:48] just a knee-high to a grasshopper and uh
[1:14:52] now he's head high to a big man
[1:14:55] and you look at that my brother and
[1:14:57] sister all the seasons and
[1:14:58] all the times and all of this coming
[1:15:02] and and you look at what's happening
[1:15:03] around us and you recognize
[1:15:06] a time to be born and a time to die
[1:15:12] i want to ask you a question was he
[1:15:15] talking naturally or spiritually
[1:15:17] or both
[1:15:20] a time to be born in jesus
[1:15:24] christ a time to die
[1:15:28] to ourself amen a season
[1:15:31] amen hallelujah a time to plant and a
[1:15:35] time to pluck up that which is planted
[1:15:37] a time to kill and a time to heal a time
[1:15:40] to
[1:15:41] break down
[1:15:45] do you realize if there's barriers in
[1:15:47] our life
[1:15:49] god is not going to come and let you
[1:15:51] build an oasis
[1:15:54] at that barrier in your life
[1:15:57] you weren't called to stop this side of
[1:15:59] glory
[1:16:00] and build an oasis on earth we were
[1:16:03] called
[1:16:04] to tear down everything that hinders
[1:16:08] our spiritual walk now god's not going
[1:16:11] to do it now some people think the
[1:16:12] preacher
[1:16:13] is is going to come in and fix that for
[1:16:16] you and some resent
[1:16:18] the fact they feel like the preacher is
[1:16:19] coming to do that for you
[1:16:21] but did you know that you have to be the
[1:16:23] one that tears it down
[1:16:25] it's only as it were your hands and the
[1:16:28] anointing of almighty god
[1:16:29] that will tear down the strongholds of
[1:16:32] your life
[1:16:33] if you choose to hold that's the reason
[1:16:35] i use the reference of hands
[1:16:36] if you choose to hold on to that
[1:16:39] stronghold
[1:16:41] god's not going to come and tear it down
[1:16:43] but it's at the point in time that you
[1:16:45] become
[1:16:45] sick and tired of being sick and tired
[1:16:48] and you come to the place that you say
[1:16:50] satan you're not gonna bind me any
[1:16:54] longer
[1:16:55] and i am pushing back against this i
[1:16:58] demand
[1:16:59] a deliverance oh saints i i don't know
[1:17:02] maybe i'll be a little too blunt this
[1:17:04] morning but i want to ask you those
[1:17:05] issues that you have in your life
[1:17:07] have you come to the place that you
[1:17:08] stand before god
[1:17:10] in the right spirit and the right
[1:17:11] attitude and demand a deliverance from
[1:17:14] that hindrance
[1:17:16] if you haven't then you're holding on
[1:17:20] to that hindrance
[1:17:25] we've often used a little story of
[1:17:27] analogy i think it come out of russian
[1:17:29] history is that
[1:17:30] where i found it of a story of a little
[1:17:32] boy who found a baby wolf in the woods
[1:17:35] and he brought it home when the parents
[1:17:38] said that's a wolf
[1:17:41] you can't keep it the little boy cried
[1:17:44] and cried and the family gave in
[1:17:48] and the little wolf was growing and
[1:17:50] growing and him and the boy played and
[1:17:52] played and had lots of fun running
[1:17:54] through the woods
[1:17:55] and the wolf was growing and growing and
[1:17:58] one day the parents come home
[1:18:00] and there's no little boy but a sleepy
[1:18:03] wolf
[1:18:06] my brother and sister a wolf is a wolf
[1:18:07] no matter how cute it is when it's
[1:18:09] little
[1:18:10] a spirit is a spirit no matter how it
[1:18:12] doesn't seem to impact your life when it
[1:18:14] is little
[1:18:15] but the day will come it will consume
[1:18:17] you
[1:18:18] amen and so we need to deal with the
[1:18:22] wolf
[1:18:22] when we meet the wolf not when the wolf
[1:18:25] has
[1:18:26] consumed us amen
[1:18:29] hallelujah
[1:18:32] so as we look at this everything a
[1:18:34] season a time to kill a time to heal
[1:18:36] time to break down and a time to build
[1:18:39] up
[1:18:40] a time to weep and a time to laugh a
[1:18:42] time to mourn in time to dance
[1:18:44] a time to cast away stones in a time to
[1:18:47] gather stones together
[1:18:49] a time to embrace and a time to refrain
[1:18:51] from embracing
[1:18:52] a time to get and a time to lose
[1:18:57] a time to keep and a time to cast away
[1:19:00] a time to rend and a time to sow a time
[1:19:03] to keep silence and a time to speak
[1:19:05] a time to love and a time
[1:19:09] to hate
[1:19:12] now the scripture says anyone who hates
[1:19:14] his brother and says he loves the lord
[1:19:17] is a liar so what are we going to hate
[1:19:24] hallelujah we'll address that here in
[1:19:26] just
[1:19:27] a moment a time of war and a time
[1:19:30] of peace we look at this and of course
[1:19:33] in our subject today as we're thinking
[1:19:35] it's a time to break down in a time to
[1:19:37] build up and
[1:19:38] god provides a season my brother and
[1:19:40] sister now i i'm going to be
[1:19:42] presumptuous forgive me
[1:19:44] but you know every one of us has things
[1:19:46] that we need to deal with in our life
[1:19:48] sometimes they're things that we have
[1:19:50] just pushed them to the side we become
[1:19:52] passive about them
[1:19:54] but if that is there and it is still
[1:19:56] something that has
[1:19:57] any kind of controlling influence in
[1:19:59] your life
[1:20:00] now that controlling influence might be
[1:20:02] that you have been brought to a place
[1:20:04] i'll just share a little story
[1:20:05] now as a little boy i like to talk a lot
[1:20:09] and as a big boy i like to talk a lot
[1:20:13] but when i was a little boy i was with
[1:20:16] my older brother
[1:20:18] and we went to a little country store
[1:20:20] that was close to my grandmother's farm
[1:20:23] and uh the man my my brother was like 14
[1:20:26] years old and the man was selling
[1:20:28] my brother cigarettes and i stood there
[1:20:31] in the store as a little boy and i
[1:20:33] looked at the man
[1:20:33] and i said you shouldn't be selling my
[1:20:37] brother cigarettes you're evil and the
[1:20:40] man told me
[1:20:41] shut up you mouthy little boy and get
[1:20:43] out of here
[1:20:45] and i made a statement i'm telling my
[1:20:47] grandmother
[1:20:48] and he said you ever come in this store
[1:20:50] again i'll slap your head off
[1:20:53] and i was like a little intimidated but
[1:20:56] you know when i got back to the house
[1:20:57] and i'm looking at my grandmother and
[1:20:58] here's my brother
[1:21:00] acting all weird you know because he's
[1:21:01] hit the cigarettes under a rock out
[1:21:03] behind the metal bar
[1:21:05] and he's all acting weird and it just
[1:21:07] come out of me i couldn't help it maybe
[1:21:08] god knew i'd be a preacher
[1:21:11] i just couldn't help it i had to you
[1:21:13] know what grandma
[1:21:16] my brother just bought cigarettes from
[1:21:17] that old fat bald man down there at this
[1:21:20] store
[1:21:21] oh my brother got so angry he was like
[1:21:23] i'm gonna beat you
[1:21:24] and i was like well it's the truth
[1:21:25] didn't it didn't he sell you cigarettes
[1:21:27] didn't he sell you cigarettes didn't he
[1:21:29] huh did he not sell you cigarettes
[1:21:31] answer me my grandmother said did he
[1:21:34] sell you cigarettes and my brother got
[1:21:36] all embarrassed
[1:21:37] i sold i bought cigarettes
[1:21:40] didn't stop him my grandma said you go
[1:21:43] get him wherever you hit him and bring
[1:21:44] him here
[1:21:45] she reduced them to ashes
[1:21:48] but you know the next time i walked into
[1:21:50] that store
[1:21:52] that man was right there and this we're
[1:21:53] talking not just a day or two this is
[1:21:55] down the road
[1:21:56] he saw me and he goes i won't i cannot
[1:21:59] repeat all the words
[1:22:02] because they were they were lightning
[1:22:03] laced
[1:22:06] but he said oh there's that little boy
[1:22:08] that's got
[1:22:09] diarrhea of the mouth
[1:22:17] pretty funny isn't it except for as a
[1:22:20] little boy
[1:22:22] that was like to own the strongest
[1:22:23] insults that had ever been hurled at me
[1:22:25] in my mouth
[1:22:26] in my life i was like diarrhea of my
[1:22:28] mouth
[1:22:31] and you know what it took years for me
[1:22:34] to wake up one day and say wait
[1:22:36] here's a man who corrupted every young
[1:22:39] person
[1:22:40] young man young woman sold beer and all
[1:22:43] that to
[1:22:44] underage kids cigarettes to chewing
[1:22:46] tobacco all of this
[1:22:47] just a corrupt man and it took years for
[1:22:50] me to wake up one day i was probably 17
[1:22:52] or 18 so you know half a dozen years
[1:22:54] i was like why do i let the words of a
[1:22:58] perverted man
[1:23:00] have an impact on me now do i suffer
[1:23:02] from the symptoms of diarrhea of the
[1:23:04] mouth
[1:23:04] well hallelujah
[1:23:08] sometimes i just can't shut up
[1:23:11] say last sunday for example but you see
[1:23:14] my brother and sister
[1:23:16] what i speak
[1:23:19] is not of the darkness
[1:23:22] but we speak of the light and how can we
[1:23:25] put a limit to the light
[1:23:27] follow the light i remember reading a
[1:23:29] story once where a man wanted to fly
[1:23:31] around the world
[1:23:33] and he just wanted to follow the light
[1:23:36] it was like a little experiment that he
[1:23:38] had and they
[1:23:39] did a great effort but it was not
[1:23:42] actually possible because it come to a
[1:23:44] time and a place he had to stop and
[1:23:46] naturally refill the airplane and
[1:23:48] different things like that and
[1:23:50] so then they was not able to stay up
[1:23:52] with the light
[1:23:53] but we have been called of almighty god
[1:23:56] to walk in the light so therefore god
[1:23:58] provided the ability for us to walk in
[1:24:00] the light
[1:24:01] we don't have to stop the light's not
[1:24:02] going to leave us behind
[1:24:04] we can walk constantly day by day
[1:24:07] in the light amen what a beautiful
[1:24:10] analogy what a beautiful type that it is
[1:24:13] amen so we look at this now let me move
[1:24:16] forward here
[1:24:17] uh in jude the first chapter amen
[1:24:21] but it says here not but beloved
[1:24:23] remember
[1:24:24] ye the words which were spoken before of
[1:24:26] the apostles of our lord jesus christ
[1:24:29] how that they told you there should be
[1:24:32] mockers in the last day who should walk
[1:24:34] after their own
[1:24:34] ungodly lust these be
[1:24:38] they who separate themselves central
[1:24:40] having not the spirit
[1:24:42] but remember now we've studied through
[1:24:44] the years the effect of but
[1:24:46] and this applies right here he's talking
[1:24:48] about something that would make us
[1:24:50] nervous we would look around saying okay
[1:24:52] where's his spirit
[1:24:53] who's this is this and this and this
[1:24:55] what is it but he says
[1:24:56] but ye beloved so he's identifying a
[1:25:00] certain class of people
[1:25:02] building up yourselves on your most holy
[1:25:05] faith
[1:25:06] now i want to just look at this for a
[1:25:08] few minutes my brother and sister
[1:25:10] we realized that all things we do uh
[1:25:13] because of and through him right through
[1:25:17] jesus christ and so
[1:25:18] we know that we cannot hold ourselves we
[1:25:20] cannot save ourselves we cannot
[1:25:22] give deliverance to ourselves but yet as
[1:25:25] the promise of god
[1:25:26] is being manifested or magnified in the
[1:25:29] day that we live in right
[1:25:30] it says that as a gross darkness comes
[1:25:33] on the land
[1:25:34] that the light would actually be
[1:25:36] identified to a greater degree
[1:25:38] and as i've shared with you before
[1:25:40] flying over south america in the middle
[1:25:42] of the night
[1:25:43] a lot of jungle a lot of not much out
[1:25:45] there and uh
[1:25:47] just sitting there uh looking out the
[1:25:49] window of an airplane praying about the
[1:25:51] meetings and the things that we were
[1:25:52] going to do for the lord
[1:25:54] and looking down there in this vast uh
[1:25:57] the darkness that you see
[1:25:58] and all of a sudden you see a single
[1:26:02] pinpoint
[1:26:02] of light my brother and sister that
[1:26:05] light shines out of the darkness
[1:26:07] so incredible amen you don't have to
[1:26:09] have
[1:26:10] lots of lights you just need one light
[1:26:13] amen and you can find it in the darkness
[1:26:16] amen so we are not worried about what is
[1:26:18] happening in this world of gross
[1:26:20] darkness
[1:26:21] because the light has come and we are
[1:26:23] attracted to the light
[1:26:25] amen so if we take these promises of god
[1:26:28] all that is opened
[1:26:29] and while we know that we cannot do this
[1:26:32] in ourselves right
[1:26:33] can't save ourselves can't heal
[1:26:35] ourselves can't deliver ourselves
[1:26:36] but the promise of god has been
[1:26:39] delivered to you and i can you say amen
[1:26:41] to that
[1:26:42] we have the promise we don't have to go
[1:26:44] ask for the promise we don't have to
[1:26:45] search for the promise the promise is
[1:26:47] right here in the word now if we have
[1:26:50] the promise my brother and sister
[1:26:51] then we have all of the potential that
[1:26:54] god intended for the bride of christ
[1:26:56] in the latter days and we don't have to
[1:26:59] go out here and try and find a new
[1:27:00] startling revelation
[1:27:02] what we have to do is take the word for
[1:27:04] our day
[1:27:05] and apply that word to our life believe
[1:27:07] that word and
[1:27:08] act upon that word and let it act upon
[1:27:10] us
[1:27:11] and as this happens we have now every
[1:27:14] tool that we need
[1:27:16] so but ye beloved building up yourself
[1:27:19] now we could take that and say well
[1:27:21] how can i build myself up well my
[1:27:24] brother and sister
[1:27:25] it is in your most holy faith amen it is
[1:27:28] in
[1:27:28] the word right because faith cometh by
[1:27:30] the hearing of the word
[1:27:32] and so you take this word and start to
[1:27:35] apply it
[1:27:36] and as it is applied to your life you
[1:27:38] have a choice amen
[1:27:40] now i don't know about you guys but i
[1:27:42] take vitamins
[1:27:43] when i remember too
[1:27:47] hallelujah you know what it tells you it
[1:27:50] tells you that
[1:27:51] all is not totally sold out to the idea
[1:27:53] of taking vitamins
[1:27:54] or i'd be able to tell you i take my
[1:27:56] vitamins three times a day
[1:27:57] like clockwork i take my vitamins when i
[1:28:00] get up in the morning and i remember
[1:28:03] on my way out the door i really should
[1:28:05] take some vitamins
[1:28:06] i'm getting old i need to take some kind
[1:28:08] of anti-aging vitamin
[1:28:10] and i do amen it's called reading the
[1:28:12] word of god amen
[1:28:14] i'll never get old reading it and so as
[1:28:17] we approach this my brother and sister
[1:28:20] i want you to catch this now you have to
[1:28:22] take this a tad bit carnal hope you
[1:28:23] don't mind
[1:28:25] you're gonna have to just build yourself
[1:28:27] up
[1:28:37] if you're waiting for me to come to your
[1:28:38] house and build you up
[1:28:43] you might be waiting a while
[1:28:46] if you're going to be built up when you
[1:28:47] come to church
[1:28:50] you're not going to get built up but a
[1:28:51] couple times a week
[1:28:53] remember the old phrase two steps
[1:28:55] forward three steps back
[1:28:58] well if you take that and the only time
[1:29:00] you're ever built up is when you come to
[1:29:02] church it's going to be two steps
[1:29:03] forward and five steps back
[1:29:10] you have to decide
[1:29:14] how do i want to be built up
[1:29:18] now when i was a young man i know it
[1:29:20] doesn't doesn't look it
[1:29:22] so i'm not trying to live in the past
[1:29:23] but i used to go to fitness center
[1:29:25] men's only fitness center used to go
[1:29:27] there play racquetball
[1:29:28] lift weights swim run
[1:29:32] but i haven't done that for years and it
[1:29:36] shows
[1:29:50] i used to be able to run six minute
[1:29:52] miles mile after mile
[1:29:56] used to be able to ride a dirt bike in
[1:29:57] the desert for hours wide open
[1:29:59] not stop and rest
[1:30:02] but it's not working very good living on
[1:30:04] those laurels
[1:30:07] now i run halfway to the mailbox walk
[1:30:10] the rest of the way
[1:30:11] you know how close my mailbox is
[1:30:16] no you see you can't live in the past
[1:30:18] that's right
[1:30:20] if you want to be built up in the holy
[1:30:22] ghost
[1:30:23] it is just like these fitness fanatics
[1:30:26] they get up
[1:30:26] every single day and they build
[1:30:30] themselves up son or daughter of god the
[1:30:34] only way we're going to be
[1:30:36] spiritually fit is
[1:30:39] building ourself up you say well if i'm
[1:30:42] the bride of christ if i'm a son of god
[1:30:44] i'm a daughter of god god's going to do
[1:30:46] this and god's going to do that
[1:30:47] my brother and sister that's not how it
[1:30:49] works
[1:30:50] god gives you everything that you need
[1:30:53] to make the rapture
[1:30:55] he's waiting on you to apply it
[1:31:00] hallelujah because you know now i say
[1:31:03] this in humor i don't want anybody to be
[1:31:05] offended but did you know if you left it
[1:31:07] to the preachers
[1:31:08] to build you up you wouldn't like it
[1:31:11] that's right
[1:31:13] i can assure you you wouldn't like it
[1:31:17] because a preacher had come in and he'd
[1:31:19] take your piles of magazines and your
[1:31:21] piles of books and your piles of this
[1:31:22] and your piles of that
[1:31:24] and he'd get a dumpster out there and
[1:31:25] he'd go through your house and he would
[1:31:27] decide arbitrarily you can live without
[1:31:29] it you can live without
[1:31:30] it you can live without it you can live
[1:31:31] without it there wouldn't hardly be
[1:31:32] nothing but one pair of shoes maybe two
[1:31:35] we'll give you a pair of dress shoes for
[1:31:37] church two pairs of shoes
[1:31:40] my goodness sister jerry would supply
[1:31:43] the goodwill for months
[1:31:49] she wouldn't like it oh you sisters
[1:31:52] giggle
[1:31:52] you wouldn't like it either because it'd
[1:31:54] be a lot easier to be hard on you than
[1:31:56] it would be hard on my wife
[1:31:58] so hallelujah but you see that's not how
[1:32:00] building it up comes
[1:32:02] it's not someone forcing you to build
[1:32:04] this up it's you with a great burden
[1:32:07] you deciding i'm fed up with my
[1:32:11] spiritual condition
[1:32:13] i'm fed up with the condition of my
[1:32:16] marriage
[1:32:16] i'm fed up with the condition of my
[1:32:18] children i'm fed up with the condition
[1:32:20] of my church
[1:32:23] and i'm going to start building this
[1:32:25] thing up tear it right down to the
[1:32:26] foundation lord how many have the
[1:32:28] courage to say
[1:32:29] tear our church right down to the
[1:32:30] foundation and rebuild it like it should
[1:32:33] be
[1:32:35] but you see we become comfortable in our
[1:32:38] church the way it is well there's a few
[1:32:40] things i don't like about it but there's
[1:32:41] a lot of things that i'm comfortable
[1:32:42] with so let's just leave it alone
[1:32:45] how about we become fed up and say lord
[1:32:47] now's a time
[1:32:48] now's a good season where the word of
[1:32:50] god shows us that this
[1:32:52] is the end time we're seeing the spirits
[1:32:54] coming
[1:32:55] bubbling to the surface we're seeing
[1:32:58] demonic spirits bubbling to the surface
[1:33:06] maybe we ought to be building ourselves
[1:33:08] up
[1:33:09] maybe status quo is not going to get us
[1:33:12] in a rapture
[1:33:14] that's right come on don't don't frown
[1:33:16] at me saints
[1:33:17] not every day can be popsicles and ice
[1:33:20] cream
[1:33:22] time that we must be built up
[1:33:26] you don't have to lift a hand for me
[1:33:28] because it's irrelevant for me
[1:33:30] but it comes to a time that you got to
[1:33:32] decide and you will decide it may not be
[1:33:34] lifting a hand or saying yes or no but
[1:33:36] there'll be a day that you make the
[1:33:37] decision
[1:33:38] i will be built up in the things of god
[1:33:40] or i will be built up in the things of
[1:33:42] the world
[1:33:43] amen but he says here but beloved
[1:33:46] building up yourselves on your most holy
[1:33:48] faith
[1:33:49] praying in the holy ghost
[1:33:52] oh what do we got to do we've got to not
[1:33:54] just say a prayer i'm guilty just like
[1:33:56] you are sometimes it's like lord you
[1:33:58] know super tired
[1:33:59] lord just thank you for being with us
[1:34:00] today keeping us safe lord
[1:34:02] you know let us rise in the morning give
[1:34:04] praise to you as we labor
[1:34:06] and hallelujah
[1:34:10] now i probably missed the mark there's
[1:34:11] no one like that maybe it's just me
[1:34:19] what does the word say that's right how
[1:34:21] are we going to get billed well brother
[1:34:22] i read my bible and i pray every day
[1:34:26] oh but beloved
[1:34:33] remember you the words which were spoken
[1:34:35] before of the apostles i wonder what
[1:34:37] words he's talking about there
[1:34:40] of our lord jesus christ man i'm just
[1:34:42] too tired i can't even read
[1:34:51] should we hold an election next week
[1:34:58] come on my brother and sister verse 19
[1:35:01] says that these people separate
[1:35:02] themselves sensual
[1:35:04] they don't even have the spirit doesn't
[1:35:07] mean they're not religious
[1:35:08] doesn't mean they don't go to church
[1:35:09] doesn't mean they don't read their bible
[1:35:11] doesn't mean they don't pray
[1:35:12] they just don't have the spirit but ye
[1:35:16] beloved hallelujah talk to a whole
[1:35:18] different class of people
[1:35:19] but ye beloved building up yourselves on
[1:35:22] your most holy faith
[1:35:23] praying in the holy ghost there's where
[1:35:26] prayers make a difference there's where
[1:35:27] prayers
[1:35:28] shake the very foundation as it were
[1:35:30] just a phrase of heaven amen
[1:35:32] because your prayer has power behind it
[1:35:34] amen keeping yourselves in the love of
[1:35:36] god looking for mercy of our lord jesus
[1:35:38] christ and into eternal life what does
[1:35:40] it do it entirely changes
[1:35:42] your engagement oh my brother and sister
[1:35:45] you know i had a friend that sold cars
[1:35:47] years ago he's quite well
[1:35:49] did quite well out of it used to right
[1:35:50] over here at ed marks this will make you
[1:35:52] all feel bad that buy new cars
[1:35:54] he used to make about two hundred
[1:35:56] thousand dollars a year on commission
[1:35:58] selling cars right here in the town of
[1:35:59] nampa idaho
[1:36:01] lived a a awesome life then the
[1:36:03] dealership started to change hands
[1:36:05] and they said we're not gonna pay
[1:36:06] commission no more we're gonna just pay
[1:36:08] you a wage
[1:36:09] and he says my wages went down to less
[1:36:11] than half
[1:36:12] now my brother and sister scott had a
[1:36:15] different kind of enthusiasm
[1:36:16] he goes out on a car lot he looks at you
[1:36:19] you know what he's
[1:36:19] what scott saw you i used to joke with
[1:36:21] scott about this i'd say scott you don't
[1:36:23] see paul
[1:36:24] scott you see dollar bills and he was
[1:36:27] like you're absolutely right
[1:36:29] and i look at people and i'm like i
[1:36:31] don't care what they're wearing i don't
[1:36:32] care what they're driving right now
[1:36:34] that guy has money and he sensed that
[1:36:38] and he just ignore people like me and go
[1:36:40] sell the car to some guy in grubby jeans
[1:36:42] and whatever
[1:36:43] driving a beat up pickup because that
[1:36:45] man has money
[1:36:46] and he was right more often than not now
[1:36:49] saw
[1:36:50] scott got in the spirit of selling cars
[1:36:54] scott didn't go out there and somebody
[1:36:56] says well now sir i know this isn't your
[1:36:58] brand of car
[1:36:59] this is a nissan and scott would say yes
[1:37:02] it's got a
[1:37:03] two-point blah blah motor turbocharged
[1:37:05] he's got this it's got this
[1:37:06] differential it's got this this this
[1:37:08] would do because in his time
[1:37:10] waiting for the prey i mean for the
[1:37:12] customer
[1:37:15] scott would whip his phone out just like
[1:37:17] you do and he would go
[1:37:19] specifications nissan pathfinder
[1:37:25] oh you want a pathfinder it's got this
[1:37:27] it's got this it's got this
[1:37:28] and people are like wow you're the only
[1:37:30] guy around here knows anything about it
[1:37:32] why he had passion
[1:37:35] scott didn't like you scott liked your
[1:37:38] money
[1:37:40] scott liked your money at his cabin in
[1:37:42] the mountains scott liked your money in
[1:37:44] his
[1:37:45] uh ski boat scott liked your money in
[1:37:48] his jet boat
[1:37:49] scott liked your money in his house in
[1:37:51] arizona

[1:37:59] had made a great christian he said well
[1:38:01] i'm lds and i said i stand on what i
[1:38:03] said
[1:38:08] and he's like now back to you but i
[1:38:10] shouldn't laugh
[1:38:11] because he sold me a vehicle because he
[1:38:14] knew what he was talking about
[1:38:17] what did he do i hope you catch this
[1:38:21] scott didn't sit back and say well if
[1:38:24] they want to buy it they'll buy it
[1:38:26] i don't have to know anything about it
[1:38:29] scott
[1:38:30] builded himself up in what he did
[1:38:35] he knew what he was talking about he
[1:38:37] knew what he believed in and that was
[1:38:39] the belief that he could sell
[1:38:41] anyone a car
[1:38:49] but you beloved
[1:38:53] building yourselves up on your most holy
[1:38:56] faith
[1:38:58] what are we commanded to do to take our
[1:39:00] faith
[1:39:01] to another level not just common
[1:39:05] everyday faith not just well i believe
[1:39:08] this
[1:39:09] i'm a message believer
[1:39:12] took his faith to another level
[1:39:15] to a most holy faith
[1:39:20] what was he doing believing enough
[1:39:23] that you could pray in the holy ghost
[1:39:25] and that would change
[1:39:26] your life amen not just praying praying
[1:39:30] will change your life
[1:39:31] but praying in the holy ghost will be a
[1:39:34] whole life-changing event
[1:39:39] not just reading your bible i wasn't
[1:39:41] going to mention who shared this with me
[1:39:43] but
[1:39:43] i was talking brother george out of the
[1:39:46] blue he calls me the other day

[1:40:10] about serious things and he made a
[1:40:12] a comment he said you know paul he said
[1:40:16] no
[1:40:17] i wish people could catch the revelation
[1:40:20] of praying through amen and then reading
[1:40:23] their bible
[1:40:27] then the bible become a whole new book
[1:40:30] when you've entered in and got in the
[1:40:31] presence of almighty god and then you
[1:40:33] read his word
[1:40:35] the bible becomes an all-new
[1:40:38] book oh now let's digress to a little
[1:40:42] video here
[1:40:44] i picked my bible up i read it this week
[1:40:46] brother paul i
[1:40:47] read it again and i read it again
[1:40:54] but remember what he said the research
[1:40:56] showed
[1:40:57] nothing really changed until they got
[1:41:00] to reading it four times a week
[1:41:05] i don't want to call people out but on
[1:41:07] the whatsapp those of you that read it
[1:41:09] would see it
[1:41:11] sister amy made a comment wow what would
[1:41:13] happen
[1:41:14] if we read it seven times a week

[1:43:25] go forward
[1:43:26] in that position and say well i prayed
[1:43:28] god didn't answer the prayer well maybe
[1:43:30] god answered it you just didn't like the
[1:43:32] answer and subconsciously put it to the
[1:43:33] side
[1:43:36] okay well praise the lord maybe this
[1:43:40] will be a short enough
[1:43:41] sermon amen look all the tools are
[1:43:44] available
[1:43:44] amen all the tools are available pray
[1:43:47] before you read your bible get in the
[1:43:49] spirit
[1:43:50] amen this book i guarantee you will
[1:43:51] become a new book
[1:43:53] right we want it to be a book of life to
[1:43:55] us it'll be
[1:43:56] a new book to us right now let's look at
[1:43:59] this here
[1:44:00] amen at the end of jude here keep
[1:44:02] yourselves in the love of god looking
[1:44:04] for mercy of lord jesus christ and
[1:44:05] eternal life
[1:44:06] amen and of some have compassion making
[1:44:10] a difference
[1:44:11] now i told you a few minutes ago we'd
[1:44:13] come out and touch this
[1:44:14] see others save with fear amen
[1:44:17] we don't like to be preached to in such
[1:44:19] a fashion that we're afraid to go to
[1:44:20] hell
[1:44:21] but others save with fear pulling them
[1:44:23] out of the fire hating even the garment
[1:44:25] spotted by the flesh see we can't become
[1:44:28] comfortable saints
[1:44:29] that we're message believers that god
[1:44:31] sent a prophet that all of this is done
[1:44:33] and we're fine
[1:44:34] no my brother and sister we need to come
[1:44:37] to the place
[1:44:38] we don't even want our garment to be
[1:44:40] spotted by the flesh
[1:44:43] and somebody needs to stand as it were a
[1:44:46] faithful brother
[1:44:47] faithful friend faithful sister faithful
[1:44:49] friend and be able to say
[1:44:51] their spots on your garment without us
[1:44:53] becoming offended
[1:44:54] we need to come to the place that we
[1:44:56] actually can say lord
[1:44:58] i realize i'm not living you know our
[1:45:00] problem is as we say we're holding the
[1:45:02] church
[1:45:03] but holiness does not mean long hair and
[1:45:05] a long dress holiness is the state of
[1:45:07] the soul
[1:45:08] amen it's not a state of the wardrobe
[1:45:10] it's a state of the soul
[1:45:12] amen and if we're not careful we fall
[1:45:14] into a pattern
[1:45:15] where holiness becomes a state of our
[1:45:17] wardrobe and it is not a state or the
[1:45:20] condition of our soul
[1:45:21] and we find that our garment is all
[1:45:23] spotted but we
[1:45:24] are not concerned with that because we
[1:45:27] can pass our own analysis
[1:45:31] hallelujah praise the lord
[1:45:34] well this service is going a little
[1:45:36] different than i thought because i feel
[1:45:37] mean and grumpy
[1:45:47] because i don't like the devil that's
[1:45:48] what it's coming down to
[1:45:51] remember we talked earlier about hate
[1:45:53] that's right well it's right here
[1:45:55] amen that's it pulling them out hating
[1:45:59] even the garment spotted by the flesh
[1:46:01] that ought to be the only hate that is
[1:46:03] in a son or daughter of god
[1:46:04] on a behating that garment that is
[1:46:07] spotted by the flesh
[1:46:08] not those around us not the world we
[1:46:11] live in not all of that they can't help
[1:46:13] what they believe they can't change what
[1:46:14] they believe
[1:46:15] it takes god god's the only one that can
[1:46:17] call them
[1:46:18] amen hallelujah well i want to just move
[1:46:21] forward here modern events
[1:46:24] see a man can say anything but lest god
[1:46:26] interprets that word see now we have our
[1:46:28] own interpretation
[1:46:30] we say it means this and this one
[1:46:31] methodist says this baptist says this
[1:46:33] the pentecostal said this
[1:46:35] the oneness says this the tunis says
[1:46:37] this and oh my there you are
[1:46:38] but god don't need no interpreter he's
[1:46:40] his own interpreter he interprets his
[1:46:42] own word by vindicating it in the age
[1:46:45] that it's purposed for
[1:46:46] the age that it's given for we're not
[1:46:48] living in a pentecostal age
[1:46:50] i once had a sister uh you know uh
[1:46:54] she she was disagreeing with me and
[1:46:56] she's like so you're saying that we have
[1:46:58] something better
[1:47:00] than what happened on the day of
[1:47:01] pentecost and i said no sister not
[1:47:03] something better
[1:47:04] but we do have something different and
[1:47:07] it's something different
[1:47:08] in the sense that receiving the baptism
[1:47:10] of the holy ghost true baptism of holy
[1:47:12] ghost
[1:47:13] doesn't give one person more authority
[1:47:14] than the next unless god's called them
[1:47:16] endowed them with a gift or a calling
[1:47:18] but you look at this and realize that it
[1:47:21] is what its purpose
[1:47:22] for so we cannot go back and try to
[1:47:25] recreate the upper room experience
[1:47:27] and say what we're going to do now is
[1:47:29] this is going to have us an upper room
[1:47:30] experience in the church
[1:47:32] and we can satisfy that scripture we're
[1:47:33] living in a different time right
[1:47:35] we're not living in a pentecostal age
[1:47:37] we're living in another age see we're
[1:47:39] not living in the methodist
[1:47:41] age we're living in another age we're
[1:47:42] living on up here
[1:47:44] to the bright age amen the calling out
[1:47:47] of the church and getting it together
[1:47:49] for rapture
[1:47:50] that's the age we're now living to my
[1:47:52] honest opinion that's exactly the truth
[1:47:54] see so we're not trying to go back and
[1:47:57] recreate
[1:47:58] that we have there now under the
[1:48:01] auspice of the first fruits my brother
[1:48:03] and sister there has to be one come to
[1:48:06] maturity
[1:48:07] and it is that this is where the great
[1:48:09] crux of our day is the great
[1:48:10] disagreement
[1:48:11] my brother and sister that people are
[1:48:13] pointing back uh
[1:48:15] laying uh the credit as it were to the
[1:48:17] prophet
[1:48:18] when in the reality the first fruit
[1:48:21] was our lord jesus christ and that now
[1:48:24] fell down as
[1:48:25] a anointing upon the prophet to the age
[1:48:28] he comes to maturity
[1:48:30] and so it's a chain of events it's not a
[1:48:32] singular
[1:48:33] event but it is a chain of events that
[1:48:36] come to pass
[1:48:37] and then here we are as believers and
[1:48:40] that
[1:48:41] first fruit anointing must come
[1:48:44] on you and i we cannot stop and say well
[1:48:47] it is the ministry it is the pastor
[1:48:50] we're doing good
[1:48:51] they understand the word it's a maturity
[1:48:54] that must come down to you
[1:48:56] and i and as that the representation
[1:48:59] that is
[1:49:00] brought forth of our lord jesus christ
[1:49:02] coming down into prophetic word
[1:49:03] coming right down into a bride what did
[1:49:06] the prophet of god say he said that you
[1:49:08] and i
[1:49:09] would be the final voice to the final
[1:49:12] age
[1:49:12] and so that means that it will not be an
[1:49:15] immature voice
[1:49:16] that is coming with a speculation of
[1:49:18] what god meant
[1:49:20] or some hope of what god meant but a
[1:49:22] maturity coming down
[1:49:24] that the bride of christ comes to the
[1:49:26] place she
[1:49:27] speaks with authority
[1:49:31] why because she's now become a mature
[1:49:34] bride
[1:49:35] amen she is not now having to say well
[1:49:38] i don't know we i i have to ask someone
[1:49:41] i'd have to do no this
[1:49:42] bride knows what she's talking about
[1:49:45] because she's had an
[1:49:47] experience and god has dealt directly
[1:49:50] now remember we were looking at the
[1:49:52] scripture how and the quotes look at
[1:49:54] that
[1:49:54] how did paul know because it was a
[1:49:57] first-hand
[1:49:59] experience no one come
[1:50:03] peter didn't come to paul and say now
[1:50:04] paul the day will come and this and this
[1:50:06] and this and this
[1:50:07] no paul had a first-hand experience he
[1:50:09] was struck from the horse
[1:50:11] he was blind god sent a anointing
[1:50:14] to a prophet the prophet comes up says i
[1:50:17] was sent of god i was praying i was sent
[1:50:19] of god to pray for you that you might
[1:50:21] receive your sight
[1:50:22] and god confirming then what had been
[1:50:25] spoken is praise for him he has his
[1:50:27] sight
[1:50:27] he has a conversion he's no longer a
[1:50:30] theological believer
[1:50:31] he is now a true believer
[1:50:34] hallelujah this age that we're living in
[1:50:37] my brother and sister
[1:50:38] no theological believer will take a
[1:50:40] rapture
[1:50:48] we're living on up here to the bride age
[1:50:50] the calling out of the church that's
[1:50:52] taking place
[1:50:53] it's happening getting it together for
[1:50:56] the rapture
[1:50:57] amen people have this idea i've had this
[1:50:59] spoken to me
[1:51:00] well when will the unity come in the
[1:51:03] message
[1:51:04] my brother and sister i'm here to
[1:51:05] disappoint you there'll never be
[1:51:07] a unity in this message
[1:51:13] there will be a unity in the bride of
[1:51:18] christ
[1:51:20] because i don't know unless somebody's
[1:51:22] changed listen let's
[1:51:23] let's take a little vote on what change
[1:51:25] we want to be i can i could
[1:51:27] load us all up in a bus to train a plane
[1:51:29] and we could go right here within these
[1:51:31] 48 states
[1:51:32] and i can walk you right in the door of
[1:51:34] a polygamous church that believes this
[1:51:36] message just as much as you do
[1:51:37] they say now if we fellowship together
[1:51:41] sooner or later something's got to
[1:51:42] change are we going to become them are
[1:51:44] they going to become us
[1:51:48] you can't fellowship together unless you
[1:51:50] agree
[1:51:52] that's what the word of god says now i
[1:51:54] use that because it's a safe
[1:51:56] somewhat said polygamy a safe topic
[1:52:04] no it's a seducing spirit
[1:52:08] now i say this in humor that some of you
[1:52:10] looking grumpy at me could maybe have a
[1:52:11] little humor today
[1:52:13] my wife's gave me permission to have as
[1:52:15] many wives as i want
[1:52:19] only she worded this way you can have
[1:52:21] just as many wives as you can support
[1:52:25] i'll take a half a one
[1:52:28] i'm sorry sister jerry
[1:52:34] but can we join together with that and
[1:52:36] call it one happy church
[1:52:38] there's no way saints there's no way you
[1:52:41] can't have fellowship
[1:52:43] lest you agree
[1:52:49] amen so getting ready for rapture
[1:52:54] it means two different things to two
[1:52:56] different people but the bride will have
[1:52:58] unity
[1:53:00] amen this bride is going to have unity
[1:53:02] now i'm getting close to quitting here
[1:53:04] we're down i can see the plate amen
[1:53:07] amen we're living up in the bride age
[1:53:10] that's the age we're now living
[1:53:12] to my honest opinion is exactly the
[1:53:13] truth and this book is a book of
[1:53:15] prophecy
[1:53:22] that's right its believers are suggested
[1:53:26] to honor it and read it and believe its
[1:53:29] author
[1:53:30] i want to tie you right to our earlier
[1:53:32] thought
[1:53:35] is it a suggestion no the prophet of god
[1:53:39] said
[1:53:40] it's commanded strong words
[1:53:44] to believers are commanded to honor it
[1:53:47] and to read it and believe its author
[1:53:49] for every word that's written in there
[1:53:51] must come to pass
[1:53:52] you see the problem we've got is where
[1:53:54] we've come to where we've taken
[1:53:56] the the command and we've turned it into
[1:53:59] a suggestion
[1:54:02] it won't work it won't work
[1:54:05] we have to take the commands as
[1:54:09] a command amen everything that's been
[1:54:13] promised has to
[1:54:14] has has to come to pass
[1:54:18] because it is jesus christ in each age
[1:54:21] the same yesterday
[1:54:23] it was jesus christ was in noah it was
[1:54:26] jesus christ
[1:54:26] moses it was jesus christ and david it
[1:54:28] was jesus christ and joseph it's jesus
[1:54:30] christ the same yesterday today and
[1:54:31] forever
[1:54:32] it's jesus christ among his people today
[1:54:35] now i want to know who this applies to
[1:54:38] jesus christ in his people today uh who
[1:54:41] who does that apply
[1:54:43] hallelujah it applies to you and i amen
[1:54:46] we have to claim that we can't just say
[1:54:48] okay okay the prophet said it
[1:54:50] i believe it no you have to actually lay
[1:54:52] claim on that
[1:54:53] you have to reach out and say you know
[1:54:55] what this word
[1:54:57] was sent you know i have a just a really
[1:54:59] distorted
[1:55:00] i have a very distorted view on malachi
[1:55:03] 4.
[1:55:06] can i get you all nervous come on i want
[1:55:08] to say it again i got a really distorted
[1:55:10] view on malachi 4.
[1:55:12] god sent a prophet to this loudest in
[1:55:17] age
[1:55:18] just for me
[1:55:22] well that's when i read if they would
[1:55:24] put up malachi 4 5 we could read that to
[1:55:26] you
[1:55:27] behold i send you and i'm the one
[1:55:29] reading it so
[1:55:30] he sent a prophet to me
[1:55:33] amen i hope you can see the same
[1:55:35] distorted view that i see
[1:55:37] because my brother and sister this is
[1:55:38] not something you just cast to the whole
[1:55:40] world
[1:55:41] he wrote it in the word behold i send
[1:55:44] elijah the prophet
[1:55:46] to you and i'm right over here saying i
[1:55:49] claim this
[1:55:50] i claim this if god sent a prophet he
[1:55:53] sent it
[1:55:53] for me he knew i had the seat can
[1:55:56] someone say amen to that
[1:55:58] he knew i had the seed and so he knew
[1:56:02] something had to come and dig all the
[1:56:04] overburden
[1:56:06] and all of the big cloths and the rocks
[1:56:08] and the sticks and the trash
[1:56:10] and expose that seed to the light and to
[1:56:13] the moisture
[1:56:14] and to bring the life into that seed
[1:56:16] that that seed could respond
[1:56:18] hallelujah and so therefore he says i
[1:56:20] know you have the seed in you
[1:56:22] i'm going to send the prophet to you
[1:56:26] oh hallelujah you got i believe you know
[1:56:28] reason i use the words distorted is
[1:56:30] because i believe that you have to see
[1:56:32] it that way
[1:56:33] you can't see that it's just well god
[1:56:35] sent a prophet no big deal no sir
[1:56:37] he sent it to me he said to me he had my
[1:56:39] address
[1:56:40] he knew right where to find me he knew
[1:56:41] right what condition i would be in
[1:56:43] when it came to me and he knew what
[1:56:45] response it would be in my heart
[1:56:47] and he knew how long it would take for
[1:56:49] the seed to germinate
[1:56:53] it's almost we baptized some of these
[1:56:54] young children here in the church just
[1:56:56] kids and you think well do they have a
[1:56:57] real understanding of the lord and then
[1:57:00] you you get to see
[1:57:02] and then you get to see them growing and
[1:57:03] you're going to see and you get to hear
[1:57:04] them and you've got
[1:57:05] all this and then you start to realize
[1:57:06] you know what god's dealt with that
[1:57:08] child amen
[1:57:09] and then some of us had to get well
[1:57:12] well along all along the path
[1:57:15] before it finally pushed out of the
[1:57:17] ground but the seed was there
[1:57:20] and when the season comes
[1:57:23] it comes to life now my brother and
[1:57:25] sister you want to pile rocks on your
[1:57:27] seed go right ahead you can do that
[1:57:31] but i like to see i like to see you know
[1:57:33] i've been known
[1:57:34] i'm sorry just a little personal i've
[1:57:36] been known to be out there on a tractor
[1:57:38] in a field
[1:57:40] and see beans corn whatever coming up
[1:57:42] and see a rock in the field
[1:57:44] you know how easy it is just to say well
[1:57:46] it's only one little plant
[1:57:48] it doesn't make a difference what do you
[1:57:50] do put the tractor in park
[1:57:53] climb out of that nice air conditioner
[1:57:56] into the dust get my clean wranglers
[1:58:00] dirty
[1:58:03] dirt on my shoes i got no place to put
[1:58:06] the rock so i have to take the rock and
[1:58:08] put it in the cab with me
[1:58:10] and my nice new shiny tractor
[1:58:13] see there's a lot of reasons why not to
[1:58:15] do this
[1:58:17] but it only takes one reason why
[1:58:21] and that is that seed is not going to
[1:58:23] live underneath
[1:58:25] that rock so you get out
[1:58:28] and you take that rock and you pick it
[1:58:31] up and you put it in your nice shiny
[1:58:33] little tractor
[1:58:34] and you haul it to the end of the field
[1:58:36] and you throw it on top of a pile
[1:58:38] where all the rocks go and i could never
[1:58:41] find that spot again but when i'm
[1:58:43] harvesting that field i know that
[1:58:45] somewhere about right here
[1:58:47] is a plant that lives because i cared
[1:58:49] enough
[1:58:50] amen to get rid of the rock
[1:58:54] saints care enough amen
[1:58:57] parents care enough in your own life
[1:59:02] to take the rock out of your family so
[1:59:03] your children will live
[1:59:07] ministry care enough to lift the people
[1:59:10] up
[1:59:12] and preach what god lays on your heart
[1:59:15] that they can live because you see if we
[1:59:18] look at it
[1:59:20] and pardon me sister nadia
[1:59:23] but if i don't care that the rock
[1:59:28] is there if i don't care
[1:59:33] can i look sister naughty in the face
[1:59:35] and say i love you sister
[1:59:37] no you can't do that we got to carry
[1:59:40] enough saints
[1:59:42] i love my children but i don't love them
[1:59:44] enough to throw the garbage out of my
[1:59:46] house
[1:59:49] i don't pray i don't love my nafta i
[1:59:51] have an altar in my home
[1:59:53] but i love them i want to see them saved
[1:59:56] could someone come and influence my
[1:59:59] children that they'd get saved
[2:00:00] why don't you influence your children
[2:00:03] why don't you put the altar why don't
[2:00:05] you light the altar
[2:00:06] why don't you keep the fire burning on
[2:00:08] the altar amen
[2:00:10] why don't you learn amen to pray
[2:00:13] amen in the holy ghost or do we
[2:00:17] care enough
[2:00:21] i think we better call them musicians
[2:00:23] you guys are looking down right hostile
[2:00:28] three kinds of believers what a sermon
[2:00:30] to close it off on
[2:00:32] david said you meet me with a sword
[2:00:34] actually this is a positive thing i love
[2:00:36] this
[2:00:38] you meet me with a sword and a spear
[2:00:40] with armor
[2:00:41] you meet me in the name of a philistine
[2:00:45] but i meet you without a sword or a
[2:00:47] speared
[2:00:48] an armor but i meet you in the name of
[2:00:51] the lord god of israel
