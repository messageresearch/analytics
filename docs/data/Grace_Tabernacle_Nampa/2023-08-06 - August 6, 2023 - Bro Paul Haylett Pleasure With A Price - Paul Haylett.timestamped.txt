[41:42] to give you the whole Haystack amen but
[41:45] that's good yes just pray for him amen
[41:48] because he can feed it one bale at a
[41:50] time amen but uh I I say that with humor

[41:57] holding service here at the Tabernacle
[41:59] and uh brother Tim is going to be
[42:02] leading songs and I meant to speak to

[42:35] support of one another amen I give you
[42:38] greetings from brother Danny Stevens uh
[42:40] communicating with him just a little bit
[42:42] it would be
[42:44] my heart's desire to get brother Danny
[42:46] to come out west
[42:48] he says it has to be when the weather is
[42:51] warm but we don't know warm like they
[42:53] know warm so I don't know what it will
[42:56] be I might volunteer to buy him a coat
[42:58] and mittens when he when he gets here
[43:00] but anyway just remember them and their
[43:04] church just like us the devil's just
[43:06] outside the door trying to get in he's
[43:09] pounding on the door you know I'm at a
[43:11] huff and puff and I'm going to blow this
[43:12] church down but what he doesn't realize
[43:14] it's God on the inside amen it's not man
[43:18] in the inside trying to hold it together
[43:20] it's God on the inside holding it
[43:22] together and so just give you greetings
[43:25] from brother Danny amen we have on the
[43:28] backboard a card uh in appreciation from
[43:31] Brother John Andes and the end time
[43:33] message Tabernacle for the gift of
[43:36] support as God opened a door for them to
[43:38] go from renting a community center where
[43:42] they had no need for any tables chairs
[43:46] Etc and then God opened door for them to
[43:49] have their own church and they had
[43:52] nothing and you as a a group as an
[43:55] assembly have given an offering and that
[43:58] card is on the backboard if you want to
[44:00] read it amen so just uh uh
[44:04] we we just want to help our body of
[44:06] Believers when we were uh first
[44:08] purchased this church and we couldn't
[44:11] afford to put carpet in it they was
[44:13] those who gave liberally to us to put
[44:16] carpet in our church and and so we just
[44:19] uh you know as it is uh reciprocating
[44:22] with other uh Believers amen and uh we
[44:26] want to remember uh our brother Vitale
[44:29] and family uh as they will be on Tuesday
[44:33] Morning very very early uh getting on an
[44:36] airplane and uh Lithuania and flying and
[44:40] we'll be arriving here in Boise that
[44:43] Tuesday evening so let's just pray for
[44:46] traveling mercies for them and if all
[44:49] goes Lord willing Ellen goes according
[44:52] to plan brother Vitale will preach for
[44:54] us this coming Wednesday amen also on
[44:58] Tuesday our brother Stan price and his
[45:00] wife who have never been West and uh so
[45:04] they're they're coming to see the west
[45:06] and we're going to give them uh between
[45:09] Brother David Nash Brother Rich Etc
[45:11] we're going to give them a lovely
[45:12] welcome to the west of vacation I think
[45:15] he's only going to preach five times
[45:17] while he's out here so
[45:19] um anyway remember brother Stana and his
[45:21] wife as they also on Tuesday morning I
[45:25] would be getting on a plane and flying
[45:27] out amen I can't think of anything else
[45:30] I've forgotten
[45:32] um let's just stand and turn in the word
[45:34] this morning I want to thank you sister
[45:37] Sarah
[45:39] and brother Titus amen uh I want to
[45:43] speak to you this morning on Pleasure
[45:45] with a price amen and um it's kind of a
[45:50] a two-edged thought because we're going
[45:53] to look at things and and it might
[45:55] almost seem like we're just looking in a
[45:57] negative connotation but we're not
[46:00] because my brother and sister uh these
[46:03] things uh that Satan is doing in this
[46:05] day he without imagination
[46:09] I want you to catch this the fact Satan
[46:12] has no imagination Satan has no creative
[46:15] power and so what he does is just sits
[46:18] back and says oh I see what God's doing
[46:21] I will come up with my own version of
[46:24] that and that's the world we live in you
[46:26] know um when Tonka when I was a little
[46:29] boy Tonka toys was all the rage for
[46:32] little kids right and Tonka built there
[46:35] back in that day the indestructible
[46:37] medal uh dump truck and bulldozer and
[46:41] Etc right they were meant they used to
[46:43] say they're meant to last for
[46:45] Generations but they didn't understand
[46:47] American kids especially boys and they
[46:50] managed to you know tear them up later
[46:52] they said well we can't sell them a
[46:54] hundred dollar dump truck people won't
[46:56] buy it so they started making it you
[46:59] know in a different fashion and then the
[47:01] rest of the world said look what they
[47:03] have there they have something that
[47:05] people are just buying and buying and
[47:08] then imitation come and the imitation
[47:09] since we're always cheaper than the
[47:11] original and then people who imitated
[47:13] the imitators had to say we got to be
[47:15] cheaper than that and that's why today
[47:17] saints that church looks more like
[47:19] entertainment
[47:20] yeah because they had to keep bringing
[47:23] it something more so I don't know this
[47:27] this doesn't like me today
[47:32] I think it's because I'm wearing a suit
[47:33] coat
[47:45] anyway
[47:47] now we have nothing
[47:51] it's working okay
[47:53] so the day that we're living in Satan is
[47:56] coming with the imitation and he is
[47:59] trying how about we took the suit coat
[48:01] off and see if that fixes it that'll
[48:02] make me happy amen
[48:04] so we see that Satan trying to imitate
[48:07] and uh everything that he does he just
[48:10] looks up and and he says this is what
[48:12] God's doing right now the world's having
[48:14] the identity crisis because the bride is
[48:17] seeing who she is
[48:19] amen and you can we won't go through the
[48:21] whole thing but you can see every one of
[48:23] these parallels amen the world is is uh
[48:27] presenting this whole gender issue
[48:29] because the bride male and female is
[48:32] seeing that she is the feminine part of
[48:35] Christ and Satan said oh if men big
[48:37] Burly husky men can identify themselves
[48:41] in the feminine identification as the
[48:44] bride of Christ I'm going to take
[48:46] Mankind and cause them to think they're
[48:49] a woman
[48:50] it all ties perfectly together we think
[48:53] that the devil has brewed up something
[48:55] special to to deceive the world no my
[48:58] brother and sister he's looking at what
[49:00] God's doing and saying I've got to have
[49:02] a counterpart to that amen amen let's
[49:05] turn in our Bibles today to Second
[49:08] Timothy the third chapter quite a
[49:10] lengthy reading here 1-14 uh but we'll
[49:14] just go through the first seven verses
[49:17] and then we'll be seated amen
[49:20] Hallelujah
[49:22] this know also that in the last days
[49:25] perilous times shall come are they here
[49:28] amen for men shall be lovers of their
[49:32] own selves Covetous boasters proud
[49:34] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[49:37] unthankful Unholy
[49:40] without natural affection I just read a
[49:43] deal the other day my brother and sister
[49:46] a man went from a doting father now this
[49:49] is a little blunt but I'm going to share
[49:50] it he went from a doting father one day
[49:53] to kill his three sons the next day
[49:59] what happened
[50:04] I'm going to get ahead of myself but I
[50:05] want to share it to you
[50:07] in
[50:09] the sermon today I don't have the
[50:12] fullness of that but speaking of The
[50:15] Prodigal Son
[50:17] I clipped the little piece out of it
[50:19] because there's only so much time and I
[50:20] should have just put it in and shared it
[50:22] with you but the prophet of God talking
[50:24] about the prodigal son says there's a
[50:27] little mama
[50:29] and she's like I wonder what my son is
[50:31] tonight
[50:35] now this sun is snuggled up in the pig
[50:38] pen
[50:39] to stay warm
[50:41] eating with the pigs
[50:44] and Mama's saying I wonder where my son
[50:46] is tonight
[50:50] and a dad saying
[50:52] yes
[50:54] yes
[50:56] and they got down I'm paraphrasing it
[50:58] they got down and started praying
[51:02] and during the night not a Revival
[51:04] service not a great phenomena taking
[51:07] place but in the night prayers reach the
[51:10] Throne of almighty God
[51:12] and the scripture tells us that the next
[51:14] day he woke and come to himself
[51:18] amen because the power of prayer is
[51:21] greater than the spirit of laodicea and
[51:24] we should not forget that
[51:27] we should not allow all of these
[51:30] negative connotations to take away the
[51:33] fact that our God is on the scene he's
[51:37] the same God Amen
[51:40] Hallelujah
[51:44] without natural affection truce Breakers
[51:47] false accusers incontinent Fierce
[51:49] despisers of those that are good
[51:53] Traders heady high-minded lovers of
[51:56] pleasure
[51:57] Pleasures more than lovers of God having
[52:00] a form of godliness but denying the
[52:02] power thereof from such turn away
[52:06] my brother and sister the word says
[52:08] don't go embrace them it says turn away
[52:10] from that spirit
[52:12] amen
[52:14] four of this sort are they which creep
[52:17] into houses and Lead captive silly
[52:19] churches
[52:23] yes and no
[52:26] we're not going to substitute churches
[52:28] to say that's what it meant here it's
[52:29] talking about silly women but remember
[52:31] the church is identified in a feminine
[52:34] form
[52:35] and so they're creeping in deceiving
[52:37] whole churches
[52:39] tearing whole churches apart the very
[52:41] fiber amen they creep into houses lead
[52:45] captive silly women Laden with sins LED
[52:48] away with divers loss ever learning and
[52:51] never able to come to the knowledge of
[52:53] the truth and I'm sorry to keep you
[52:55] standing but I'm going to make an
[52:56] emphasis right here it didn't say they
[52:58] didn't have truth
[53:01] they have truth but they're not coming
[53:03] to knowledge of that truth in other
[53:05] words it's never been open to them and
[53:08] they can walk away and say this is not
[53:10] real this is not this it's this it's
[53:13] this and the reason they can say that my
[53:15] brother and sister because they never
[53:17] met Christ
[53:19] amen the prophet of God didn't say I
[53:21] come to introduce you William Branham I
[53:24] come to introduce you to Jesus Christ
[53:27] and they never got past the preacher the
[53:30] building or the prophet they never got
[53:32] on to Christ because if they had they
[53:35] would realize that the messenger can
[53:37] have flaws but the message is perfect
[53:40] amen hallelujah sorry I'm getting
[53:43] excited now as Janus and jamboree's
[53:46] withstood Moses so do these also resist
[53:48] the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate
[53:52] concerning the faith Heavenly Father we
[53:54] just ask for your blessings this morning
[53:56] Lord lead us guide us today Lord open
[53:59] the word to us and may father when we
[54:02] walk out of church today may we be able
[54:05] to say with a clear Heart Lord in
[54:07] conviction it was good to be in the
[54:09] house of God today Lord we love you we
[54:12] adore you and we come before you now in
[54:15] the precious name of Jesus Christ amen
[54:18] you may be seated Saints
[54:21] now the scripture tells us here
[54:25] gives us a clear identity to go back
[54:28] and and be able to read what the spirit
[54:31] and what will be taking place in this
[54:33] day is it says now as Janus and
[54:34] jamboree's withstood Moses so do these
[54:37] also resist the truth men of corrupt
[54:41] Minds represent reprobate concerning the
[54:44] faith but they shall proceed no further
[54:48] you see here that the scripture is
[54:50] giving us a declaration that God's only
[54:53] going to let this go so far and when it
[54:56] comes concerning Sons and Daughters of
[54:58] God Amen there will be a place that we
[55:02] can be buffeted there's a time that
[55:05] Satan can come and bring doubts he can
[55:07] bring fears he can bring anxieties but
[55:10] my brother and sister the word of God
[55:11] says he's never lost a one so we do not
[55:15] have to then become anxious about what
[55:18] is going on in our world if things are
[55:20] buffeted we can stop and say Lord you
[55:23] made a promise I'm standing on that
[55:26] promise amen now you proceed no further
[55:29] for their Folly shall be manifest unto
[55:31] all men as theirs also was and I want
[55:34] you just for a minute I'm not trying to
[55:36] be political in the Pulpit but my
[55:38] brother and sister were seeing as time
[55:40] goes on here Ministries that had uh you
[55:44] might say a distorted view of what this
[55:46] message was about Ministries that never
[55:49] let go of denomination they had certain
[55:51] things that they held opinions Etc and
[55:55] time is revealing those that time is
[55:57] bringing out and all of this is becoming
[56:00] the Folly is becoming manifest and you
[56:02] say but brother Paul their churches are
[56:04] still full of people my brother and
[56:06] sister are you going to recognize that
[56:08] God knows who are his own and these
[56:12] people are anointed maybe they have that
[56:15] same exact spirit so therefore they're
[56:17] attracted and so it's there that if
[56:20] they're not God will come in the word
[56:22] will be spoken one day and then it will
[56:24] affect them such amen I just remember a
[56:27] time and a place won't go into the whole
[56:29] story but to have a brother this is in
[56:32] South America have a brother come to me
[56:34] and say I'm Ben x amount of years in
[56:37] this Doctrine and tonight God is
[56:40] revealed to me that I have been in the
[56:43] wrong place and I've wasted all these
[56:44] years and and God spoke to me and I
[56:47] spoke back to him and I said no brother
[56:49] the time was not wasted you have been
[56:52] being constructed by the word of God
[56:55] even though it was seemingly in this
[56:57] other Doctrine but you've been being
[56:59] constructed and as it is that God will
[57:01] bring you to a place now that all of
[57:04] those things in your past will be a
[57:06] benefit in other words I couldn't come
[57:08] and speak to your brother-in-law and to
[57:10] your father-in-law and to your sister
[57:12] and those I can't speak to them but now
[57:16] that God's opened your eyes you can
[57:18] speak to them the door will be open for
[57:20] you whether it's at a family function or
[57:23] they start to question why did you
[57:25] change and so God allows us to be
[57:28] schooled in the word and it's never
[57:30] wasted amen God doesn't say I'm going to
[57:33] send Moses to the max side of the desert
[57:35] and just let him waste a way out there
[57:37] until the season comes to use him but
[57:40] God sent him to the max side of the
[57:42] desert because he needed a certain kind
[57:45] of training amen we read that quote here
[57:47] the other day that God was there started
[57:51] the Bush on fire to catch Moses
[57:53] attention and my brother and sister I
[57:55] don't know what the bush is in your life
[57:57] today but God will get our attention
[58:00] amen and so we see that these will not
[58:03] proceed no further God's getting
[58:05] attention of the Bride she's starting to
[58:08] see these things amen but thou Hast
[58:11] fully known now we're seeing a little
[58:13] shift
[58:15] in what is being Spoken Here
[58:18] but thou Hast fully known my Doctrine
[58:22] this is pretty confident my brother and
[58:24] sister God didn't God didn't bring some
[58:27] wishy-washy Messengers and and apostles
[58:30] and disciples on this scene God brought
[58:32] men that had courage and I saved God
[58:34] increase my courage amen and he said but
[58:38] thou Hast fully known my Doctrine manner
[58:41] of life purpose Faith long-suffering
[58:45] charity and patience
[58:48] what is he doing
[58:51] it was already mentioned this morning I
[58:52] got a little excited right there you
[58:54] know what it is my brother and sister
[58:55] all of this is being shown right out of
[58:58] our life right here in the world today
[59:00] we go to work amen I've never been a
[59:02] doctor in the hospital I've never been
[59:04] you know uh you just name it uh in a
[59:07] program or I've I've done certain things
[59:09] but you see there's places where God
[59:11] places each one to be there to manifest
[59:14] the very life you imagine me brother
[59:16] Trevor cutting a uh someone's hair
[59:19] amen I'll tell you what probably be a a
[59:22] big lawsuit and if I did more than one
[59:24] it would it would become a you know a
[59:27] class action suit amen so I will never
[59:30] meet those people I will never do that
[59:32] just vice versa
[59:34] amen I tell you my brother and sister
[59:37] but God says I'm going to show your
[59:40] Doctrine amen let me speak it that way
[59:42] it's possessive right it's not our
[59:44] Doctrine it's God's Doctrine but when we
[59:46] have it in us and we are living it it
[59:49] becomes our Doctrine we're identified
[59:51] with it amen and I want it to be that
[59:54] the world would know your Doctrine amen
[59:56] and would know your manner of life would
[59:59] know your purpose your faith your
[1:00:01] long-suffering your charity and your
[1:00:03] patience
[1:00:04] amen I'll tell you what my brother and
[1:00:06] sister I hope oh brother Trevor sister
[1:00:08] carry no mind but I tell you they had a
[1:00:10] son that was struggling with some things
[1:00:13] and and there was a need that was there
[1:00:15] and they went and they embraced their
[1:00:17] son and we as a church prayed I kept it
[1:00:20] as pretty much a simple uh we need just
[1:00:22] to remember but my brother and sister we
[1:00:25] got to see God come on the scene we're
[1:00:27] going to see God answer the prayer of
[1:00:30] the Saints and my brother and sister God
[1:00:32] will give by many infallible proofs and
[1:00:35] sometimes we think those infallible
[1:00:37] proofs have to be the supernatural
[1:00:39] lightning in the sky a fire coming down
[1:00:43] but sometimes those infallible proofs is
[1:00:46] to a young man that has a need and
[1:00:49] there's a prayer that goes forward and
[1:00:51] God comes and answers the prayer and
[1:00:53] there will be no denying that it was God
[1:00:55] that answered the prayer
[1:00:57] anymore
[1:00:59] Hallelujah infallible proofs
[1:01:02] persecutions afflictions which come unto
[1:01:05] me at Antioch it in him Elijah what
[1:01:09] persecutions I endured but out of them
[1:01:11] all the Lord delivered me I want you to
[1:01:15] catch the context of this you know I
[1:01:17] just I never got out of school I barely
[1:01:19] got out of English class but I'm telling
[1:01:21] you when you look at this it almost
[1:01:23] thinks that you almost think that this
[1:01:25] is about the author
[1:01:27] but when it comes down he's really this
[1:01:30] last line I Endure these but the butt
[1:01:34] puts everything in context out of them
[1:01:37] all the real context of that statement
[1:01:40] is the Lord delivered me
[1:01:43] Hallelujah not to look at the man not to
[1:01:46] look at you and I but to look at the
[1:01:48] Lord he's the one that delivers and I
[1:01:51] say thank you Lord because when I could
[1:01:53] not deliver myself he has come on the
[1:01:56] scene and delivered me amen yea and all
[1:02:00] that live Godly in Christ shall suffer
[1:02:03] persecution
[1:02:06] kind of like praying for patience no no
[1:02:08] not I got enough problems about praying
[1:02:10] for patience well God knows what you
[1:02:11] need he's going to give you patience
[1:02:13] whether you want to claim it or not so
[1:02:15] you might as well say Lord give me
[1:02:17] patience
[1:02:18] amen oh no that's gonna be too much you
[1:02:21] know it won't be any more than God would
[1:02:22] laid on you in anyway amen you'll not
[1:02:25] put anything on you that you cannot
[1:02:27] endure so just pray for it Lord if I
[1:02:31] need patience if I need whatever I need
[1:02:33] Lord just please give it to me
[1:02:37] well I mean we can run from it
[1:02:43] maybe what we ought to do is just have a
[1:02:45] little church camp out track meet
[1:02:49] and see what can outrun what
[1:02:52] amen
[1:02:54] our very thoughts
[1:02:57] as they come from our our mind
[1:03:00] are discerned at the Throne of God
[1:03:02] outrun that one
[1:03:06] you can't get beyond that you cannot out
[1:03:08] think God you cannot outrun God you
[1:03:10] cannot outmaneuver God
[1:03:12] amen so we might as well surrender to
[1:03:15] God
[1:03:19] but evil men and seducers shall wear wax
[1:03:21] worse and worse deceiving and being
[1:03:24] deceived that's this really sad verse
[1:03:26] right there 13 that the deceiver who
[1:03:28] comes with that mouth intent is going to
[1:03:31] end up waking up one day and realize he
[1:03:35] himself was deceived
[1:03:38] that's kind of like the guy jumping into
[1:03:40] yeah you know I was joking with a
[1:03:42] brother the other day I made some
[1:03:44] wisecrack about Amway and he goes whoa
[1:03:46] whoa whoa brother Paul
[1:03:48] I I'm a member of Amway
[1:03:51] I was like oh you and the other half of
[1:03:54] America
[1:03:56] and he goes well they have some good
[1:03:58] products
[1:03:59] and I'm not trying to make money from it
[1:04:03] but you see my brother and sister
[1:04:05] every kind of natural thing like that
[1:04:08] well what is it they say
[1:04:10] follow the money
[1:04:14] we're not exempt
[1:04:18] we're not exempt
[1:04:20] that's why we as a body of believers
[1:04:23] have to I looked at brother George he
[1:04:25] left his level here by accident but then
[1:04:27] he told me I probably needed it and so
[1:04:29] you know I don't know if he meant I
[1:04:32] needed it for you or needed it for me so
[1:04:35] I'm just gonna surround all of us you
[1:04:37] know that we gotta remain in Balance if
[1:04:40] we lose our balance we go one way or the
[1:04:44] other way you know they put a crown on
[1:04:46] every road so the water will run off if
[1:04:48] you just let go of the steering wheel on
[1:04:50] your car going down the freeway amen you
[1:04:53] will find your car will go One Direction
[1:04:54] or the other it'll come to the curves
[1:04:57] and maybe it'll just go straight
[1:04:58] whatever will happen maybe you'll never
[1:05:00] make it to the Curve but you look at
[1:05:02] this you see these people evil men and
[1:05:05] seducers are going to be worse and worse
[1:05:08] deceiving and being deceived but I want
[1:05:10] to throw this out if I could for a
[1:05:12] moment you don't have to research very
[1:05:13] far to find in the world of the mega
[1:05:16] church that everybody's so proud they've
[1:05:18] got product lines mugs and t-shirts and
[1:05:21] all kinds of products and their own
[1:05:24] notebooks and their own whatevers that
[1:05:27] they're doing in promoting this my
[1:05:29] brother and sister what you see is these
[1:05:31] people unashamedly are taking advantage
[1:05:34] of the people
[1:05:37] and imagine standing in shoes like that
[1:05:40] on Judgment Day
[1:05:43] I mean after all
[1:05:46] I won't go there
[1:05:48] but continue thou
[1:05:50] in the things
[1:05:54] I want you to I want you to really shift
[1:05:56] gears here
[1:05:58] but continue thou speaking to you
[1:06:01] continue thou in the things which thou
[1:06:04] Hast learn and hath been assured of
[1:06:07] knowing of whom now has learned them
[1:06:10] amen what do we do we get anchored in
[1:06:13] the word of God and it doesn't matter
[1:06:15] what's going on out there my brother and
[1:06:17] sister it doesn't matter what's
[1:06:18] happening in this world in this
[1:06:20] government in all of these things what
[1:06:22] has happened is we've had a sure word
[1:06:25] come in our day a word of Prophecy of a
[1:06:28] god-vindicated prophet that come down
[1:06:31] and said here it is I'm going to
[1:06:33] introduce you today to Jesus Christ and
[1:06:36] when people can turn around and walk
[1:06:38] away my brother and sister the
[1:06:40] introduction did not take hold
[1:06:48] but let me say it again
[1:06:52] continue thou on the things which thou
[1:06:54] has learned
[1:06:55] and has been assured of
[1:06:58] now is this Paul David Chris assuring
[1:07:00] you
[1:07:02] no this is the Holy Ghost
[1:07:04] we can't even truly say that Jesus is
[1:07:07] the Christ without the Holy Ghost
[1:07:09] so people can voice that they can speak
[1:07:12] that out but without the Holy Ghost the
[1:07:14] revelation of Jesus being Christ is not
[1:07:17] real to them they are speaking words
[1:07:19] that's called intellectualism but
[1:07:22] continue thou which thou has learned and
[1:07:25] has been assured of knowing of whom thou
[1:07:27] Hast learned them amen now I want to
[1:07:31] just uh kind of take this if you would
[1:07:34] that picture that we're we're looking at
[1:07:36] here actually looks a little bit Bleak
[1:07:38] because this all this scripture talking
[1:07:40] about what the spirits of the day will
[1:07:43] be of the age will be and how all this
[1:07:46] will be of uh people being lovers of
[1:07:49] pleasure loving themselves truce
[1:07:51] Breakers ungodly my brother and sister
[1:07:54] all of that breaking down we look out
[1:07:56] and and it's like my where's the world
[1:07:58] going to and you see how this is it is
[1:08:02] starting to look kind of Bleak but it
[1:08:04] gives a very clear picture you don't
[1:08:07] have to search very far when you look at
[1:08:08] that to recognize as this is the picture
[1:08:12] of the day we live in it's right here
[1:08:14] before us and if we can't see that then
[1:08:17] God help us because it's right there in
[1:08:19] front of us amen and so as we look at
[1:08:23] that and recognize the spirits of our
[1:08:25] day but as I opened with you I want you
[1:08:28] to realize that if you will go back in
[1:08:31] your time and read those scriptures and
[1:08:33] reverse every single one of those turn
[1:08:37] every one of those over amen and look at
[1:08:40] that and you'll see what the effect of
[1:08:43] the word is having on the bride of
[1:08:45] Christ amen this bride is not a truce
[1:08:48] breaker she has bound herself to Christ
[1:08:51] amen this bride does not love herself
[1:08:55] she loves Jesus Christ amen you know
[1:08:58] every one of those turn it over so the
[1:09:01] word is showing us the counter effect
[1:09:03] that the devil is using against the word
[1:09:06] in this hour amen many of these people
[1:09:09] fortunate to say will actually attend
[1:09:12] church every Sunday and suffer from
[1:09:14] these symptoms right here amen now first
[1:09:17] Timothy 5 verses 6 and 7. now we'll look
[1:09:21] at this that when one is living uh you
[1:09:25] know the world we're living in today as
[1:09:27] it said in previous verse there lovers
[1:09:30] of pleasure
[1:09:31] my brother and sister we live in a day
[1:09:34] that is so pressurized
[1:09:36] people are just losing their minds
[1:09:39] people going crazy right and left all
[1:09:42] the way back in the 60s brother Branham
[1:09:44] said you know the half of America at
[1:09:46] that time has to take a pill to go to
[1:09:48] bed at night they got to take a pill to
[1:09:50] get up and you just go do the homework
[1:09:52] yourself if you care to and you'll find
[1:09:55] that those numbers have steadily risen
[1:09:57] through the years they didn't go away
[1:09:59] Amen in our very sophisticated Society
[1:10:03] it's not declining it's increasing
[1:10:06] because one they have not found a way to
[1:10:09] let off the pressure and another is
[1:10:11] they're caught up in pleasure First
[1:10:14] Timothy 5 6 and 7 but she that liveth in
[1:10:17] pleasure is dead while she liveth and
[1:10:20] these things give in charge that they
[1:10:23] may be blameless amen so there is read
[1:10:26] the whole scripture go back and tie it
[1:10:27] I'm pulling this out for time but you
[1:10:30] see my brother and sister as you speak
[1:10:32] to the bride of Christ she has to
[1:10:35] recognize the symptom
[1:10:38] otherwise God would just put you and I
[1:10:40] somewhere where we'd be oblivious to
[1:10:42] what's happening in the world
[1:10:45] but God makes us aware sometimes even
[1:10:48] manifested in our own life
[1:10:50] that we would stop and say wait
[1:10:53] that's how I'm acting
[1:10:55] and we can be corrected right we say
[1:10:58] Lord help me I got a spirit of laodicea
[1:11:01] I've got this Spirit that's maybe
[1:11:03] causing me to to speak in a certain way
[1:11:05] I don't know I'm not trying to be
[1:11:07] legalist here but maybe your music is
[1:11:09] slipping maybe your conversation is
[1:11:12] slipping maybe you're the way you dress
[1:11:14] is slipping or now you know we talk is
[1:11:16] slipping my brother and sister what we
[1:11:18] allow in our house maybe is slipping a
[1:11:21] little bit and God is going to speak to
[1:11:23] you and I and catch our attention to
[1:11:26] draw us back and say that is not
[1:11:29] beneficial to you that is not bringing
[1:11:31] you into my presence I am not pleased
[1:11:34] with that
[1:11:35] and that's a God that loves you amen
[1:11:37] that's not legalism that's not law
[1:11:39] that's not control my brother and sister
[1:11:41] that's love amen so he's telling us here
[1:11:45] that that she that's living in pleasure
[1:11:48] is dead while she's living and that is a
[1:11:50] clear symptom of laodicea she is living
[1:11:53] in pleasure and she is dead now my
[1:11:57] brother and sister it's there that we'll
[1:11:59] look at this
[1:12:01] a person
[1:12:02] in this position
[1:12:05] pays with a higher value
[1:12:08] than they will ever receive they pay a
[1:12:10] higher price than they will ever receive
[1:12:13] so it is that pleasure has a price
[1:12:16] and it's there that when we get caught
[1:12:19] up in the spirit of laodicea you know we
[1:12:22] we feel like uh and we'll read a quote
[1:12:24] here in a minute I've got to let off the
[1:12:25] pressure and I you know I need to do
[1:12:27] something to release my mind and if
[1:12:30] we're not careful we'll find ourselves
[1:12:31] drifting into things that that are not
[1:12:34] pleasing to God and we justify it
[1:12:36] because I need to let off the pressure
[1:12:38] but it's there in the world that we're
[1:12:40] living that we'll see if Satan can coax
[1:12:44] you and I to come over and is is this
[1:12:47] sense
[1:12:48] um I'm ahead of myself I I don't rather
[1:12:50] back up or just plow forward amen but
[1:12:53] you know it's this position you know no
[1:12:56] one ever likes now you can get a little
[1:12:58] carried away like Paul will spend 10
[1:12:59] hours on the computer trying to save
[1:13:01] five bucks
[1:13:04] I didn't pay very good dividend did it
[1:13:07] sometimes you're just better off to say
[1:13:09] okay
[1:13:10] I'm just gonna I'm gonna do this
[1:13:13] and what happens is as we find ourselves
[1:13:17] moving into a position
[1:13:20] and we don't even realize we're paying a
[1:13:23] higher price than that will ever return
[1:13:27] back to us
[1:13:28] now as a farmer I sometimes joke that we
[1:13:31] are of a culture by high sell low
[1:13:34] amen remain in business while it lasts
[1:13:40] but my brother and sister that's not
[1:13:42] spiritually quantifiable
[1:13:44] amen you cannot pay a price that has no
[1:13:47] return
[1:13:48] so we invest in the world we uh let
[1:13:51] ourselves be drawn into the world our
[1:13:53] Focus becomes the world what is the
[1:13:57] return
[1:13:58] she's living she's in pleasure
[1:14:01] but she's dead
[1:14:03] amen and that is what Satan's trying to
[1:14:06] do now let's just go on right here in
[1:14:08] the resurrection of Lazarus you know I
[1:14:10] would encourage each one of you to just
[1:14:13] go and and listen to this uh it's just
[1:14:17] uh very very good sermon amen now some
[1:14:21] people you know say well we don't listen
[1:14:23] anything uh before 63 uh you know that's
[1:14:26] when real Revelation come my brother and
[1:14:28] sister Revelation is through this
[1:14:30] message beginning to end amen and you
[1:14:33] throw out all of the previous stuff
[1:14:35] you'll find just like those who like to
[1:14:37] read the last chapter of the book
[1:14:39] because it's a waste of time to read the
[1:14:41] first chapter we'll find there's details
[1:14:44] they've missed and that's what the
[1:14:46] message is amen Christians do not die
[1:14:48] there's no scripture in the Bible that
[1:14:51] says Christians Christians die a man a
[1:14:54] person that lives in pleasure is dead
[1:14:56] while they're living death means
[1:14:58] separation separation from God and
[1:15:02] sinners are not Sinners are separated
[1:15:03] from from God but Christians never
[1:15:06] separate from God they just leave the
[1:15:09] body here to be with the Lord amen I
[1:15:12] tell you why that's why we don't fear
[1:15:14] God I mean fear death that's why we're
[1:15:16] not afraid of what tomorrow will be amen
[1:15:20] now remember last Wednesday I believe it
[1:15:22] was I read a quote to you about how
[1:15:25] brother branham's laying it down and
[1:15:26] says that there are names that can never
[1:15:29] be removed from the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:15:32] now my brother and sister he's just not
[1:15:34] talking to the Christian Church nominal
[1:15:37] amen he is talking to the people amen
[1:15:41] the people of the book and when he
[1:15:44] speaks or you use that phrase the people
[1:15:46] of the book some people would say Well
[1:15:48] they're talking of the Bible and in a
[1:15:50] sense that would be true but really it's
[1:15:53] literally identifying those names in the
[1:15:56] Lamb's Book of Life are the people of
[1:15:59] the book those are the ones that Satan
[1:16:01] would love to deceive they're the ones
[1:16:03] that say Satan we're just trying to find
[1:16:06] any way to get them to pull back and to
[1:16:10] hold back now my brother and sister I
[1:16:12] want to just throw this out to you this
[1:16:14] morning that if Satan can get you to not
[1:16:18] exercise the gift God has given you now
[1:16:21] the gift he has given you and I is the
[1:16:23] ability to live a Christian life amen
[1:16:26] there is an all-encompassing gift that
[1:16:29] he has given us amen because even the
[1:16:31] prophet says that the gift of the Holy
[1:16:33] Ghost is in a sense temporal right it's
[1:16:36] the soul that God's after he's not
[1:16:38] looking down saying they were anointed
[1:16:39] they were anointed my brother and sister
[1:16:41] the prophet of God says that doesn't
[1:16:43] mean anything it's the soul that God is
[1:16:45] after and it's the soul that the devil's
[1:16:48] after so if the devil can get you and I
[1:16:50] to not exercise the gift and the gift I
[1:16:53] want to express to you this morning is
[1:16:55] our ability to believe the word amen
[1:16:59] that is a gift that comes from God it
[1:17:01] wasn't because we were born with a
[1:17:03] certain Intel act or a certain ability
[1:17:05] but it was a gift from God that we could
[1:17:08] receive the word and say Amen to it amen
[1:17:11] and so as it is we'll see this gift and
[1:17:14] if Satan can come and get us to move
[1:17:17] over in a position where you don't fully
[1:17:20] exercise the gift that God has given you
[1:17:23] the ability to take every single word of
[1:17:26] God and say Amen to it Lord help us Lord
[1:17:30] help us to be able to say Amen to every
[1:17:33] word not by rote not just say amen amen
[1:17:36] amen amen and think you covered it it's
[1:17:38] got to come from the heart it's going to
[1:17:40] come out of the Soul amen and Satan
[1:17:43] would like to separate you now if you
[1:17:47] have anything to do with business or
[1:17:49] just good Common Sense we realize that
[1:17:52] there is
[1:17:53] um those names that were taken out of
[1:17:55] the book my brother and sister are not
[1:17:57] going to remain as it is as they were
[1:18:00] Judas from a matter of fact Judas was
[1:18:03] there there he had a holy ghost Ministry
[1:18:05] but there was an underlying uh something
[1:18:09] bothering Judas where he could not say
[1:18:11] Amen to every word and as time went that
[1:18:15] first little bit of holding back that
[1:18:17] first little bit of questioning what
[1:18:19] Jesus said uh the first little bit of
[1:18:22] Separation that come my brother and
[1:18:24] sister that didn't just get stopped and
[1:18:26] solidified right there and never went on
[1:18:28] and he always had just this question
[1:18:30] that's why the word of God the prophet
[1:18:32] of God tells us if there's something you
[1:18:34] don't understand don't get all carried
[1:18:36] away with that take that put it on the
[1:18:39] shelf and God will come in the right
[1:18:41] season and verify that to you amen but
[1:18:45] what happens people got to have the
[1:18:46] answer and I want it now
[1:18:48] and so they start digging and they can't
[1:18:51] move they're not in the spirit so they
[1:18:53] can't move in the realm of the spirit to
[1:18:55] get the answer so they go over here in
[1:18:57] the intellect and start digging in to
[1:18:59] find an answer in the intellect but the
[1:19:01] intellect can't go where God is wanting
[1:19:03] to take you and I amen the intellect
[1:19:06] amen man's thinking cannot go into
[1:19:09] Heavenly places
[1:19:10] and so when we find ourselves caught up
[1:19:13] and questioning we need to stop and say
[1:19:15] am I actually in the intellect or in
[1:19:18] myself or am I in the spirit amen and
[1:19:21] you'll find that when we'll submit
[1:19:22] ourself in that the spirit will bring us
[1:19:25] right back and God who is faithful never
[1:19:27] lost a one will bring us right back in
[1:19:30] the channel and then we'll be reading
[1:19:32] we'll be listening we'll be hearing
[1:19:34] preacher whatever it might be and God
[1:19:37] will lay that in there and you'll say
[1:19:38] that's what it was amen because God is
[1:19:41] faithful
[1:19:42] amen now you look at this
[1:19:45] my brother and sister a return on
[1:19:46] investment
[1:19:49] let's talk about pleasure
[1:19:51] is pleasure wrong
[1:19:55] no
[1:19:57] what is wrong
[1:19:59] the perversion
[1:20:01] of pleasure
[1:20:04] anything we put between
[1:20:06] us and God is an idol
[1:20:10] and sometimes it's pleasure
[1:20:14] sometimes cares of life these different
[1:20:16] things like that I don't this morning
[1:20:19] want to go and describe each one because
[1:20:20] we could just have a all-encompassing
[1:20:22] list but my brother and sister a return
[1:20:25] on investment as you would very well be
[1:20:28] able to discern is that whatever effort
[1:20:31] investment of money time
[1:20:35] emotion of your spirit
[1:20:39] when you do that what do you get back
[1:20:49] how personal do we go
[1:20:52] when we get angry
[1:20:56] I'm going to throw sister Jerry under
[1:20:58] the bus she's got her armor on today
[1:21:03] when we sow love what do we get in
[1:21:05] return
[1:21:08] love
[1:21:10] when we sow
[1:21:13] start naming them off
[1:21:16] when a man
[1:21:18] so is investment in a wife
[1:21:21] that shows that he loves her he cares
[1:21:23] for her he's supporting her he gets all
[1:21:27] of these beautiful gifts in return he
[1:21:29] has a nice kitchen for her he gets good
[1:21:31] food back a nice house for her he has a
[1:21:34] place to come home and be comfortable
[1:21:36] and all of these little things he gets
[1:21:38] to enjoy from the investment but if and
[1:21:42] sister Jerry is like Paul I need you to
[1:21:43] read this
[1:21:45] and right at the bottom of that list it
[1:21:47] says if you sow frustration to your wife
[1:21:50] what will you get from your wife in
[1:21:53] return and sister Jerry I'm throwing you
[1:21:56] under the bus baby she's just like read
[1:21:58] this Paul
[1:22:00] come on Paul read this read it again
[1:22:05] but my brother and sister I needed to
[1:22:07] read that because sometimes we don't
[1:22:09] realize what it is we're actually sowing
[1:22:11] but we don't like the return
[1:22:15] wow my wife is almost like rebellious I
[1:22:19] mean she's mouthy and she's this and
[1:22:21] that what are you sowing
[1:22:25] I go to church and there's problem here
[1:22:27] at the church and problem there at the
[1:22:29] church a problem with this and a problem
[1:22:31] with that and a real problem with the
[1:22:33] priest what are you sowing
[1:22:37] come on this is a principle of God
[1:22:40] this is not some preacher's opinion my
[1:22:42] brother and sister that we will reap
[1:22:45] what we sow and I say God help me God
[1:22:48] help me I want to sow the right things I
[1:22:51] want to see the power of God move in
[1:22:53] Grace Tabernacle so what I've got to do
[1:22:56] is sow a consecrated life in the word to
[1:23:00] bring it to you that you would be able
[1:23:02] to receive that in the right spirit and
[1:23:05] take it home not cause I said it not
[1:23:07] because brother Branham said it because
[1:23:09] the word of God said it and we take that
[1:23:12] home and it starts to bring forth a
[1:23:14] harvest
[1:23:15] and that Harvest will either make us
[1:23:17] bitter and secluded or that Harvest will
[1:23:20] make us happy
[1:23:21] oh my goodness my brother and sister so
[1:23:25] what is the return on investment of
[1:23:27] pleasure
[1:23:29] well we would look at this for a moment
[1:23:30] and say well that pleasure doesn't bring
[1:23:32] much but just give me time here this
[1:23:34] morning if you would please amen so it's
[1:23:37] there that this uh return on investment
[1:23:39] we have to look at this what are we
[1:23:42] sowing and what do we expect to reap
[1:23:47] we don't grow soybeans out west here but
[1:23:49] soybean seed is cheaper than corn seed
[1:23:52] so I think I'm going to sow soybean seed
[1:23:54] because it's cheaper and I'm going to
[1:23:56] get the Columbine ready for corn
[1:23:59] it's not going to work
[1:24:00] not going to work we're going to harvest
[1:24:03] what it is we've invested in
[1:24:08] now look what
[1:24:10] Satan's trying to do as we've already
[1:24:12] read the definition there
[1:24:14] death being Eternal separation
[1:24:17] definitely not profitable is it
[1:24:20] be separated from the presence of God a
[1:24:23] man could have millions
[1:24:24] he could have the finery of Life give
[1:24:27] his wife big diamonds and the highest of
[1:24:30] fashion uh all of the all of these
[1:24:33] things I just seen a little deal the
[1:24:35] other day the man had just spent lavish
[1:24:37] amount money on his wife and she hired a
[1:24:39] Hitman knocked him off because she
[1:24:41] didn't want to live love it she wanted
[1:24:42] it all
[1:24:43] Hallelujah so you know you got to be
[1:24:45] careful that you know he thought that
[1:24:47] for all of his misbehavior a diamond
[1:24:50] would balance that
[1:24:53] he thought for all of his indiscretion
[1:24:55] that a Rolls-Royce or it was a Bentley I
[1:24:58] mean uh would would offset that
[1:25:01] but her resentment built up to such a
[1:25:05] level
[1:25:06] everything's more important than me
[1:25:12] she had enough money
[1:25:14] she figured she'd get it all
[1:25:16] but what she didn't realize is life
[1:25:18] insurance never pays out
[1:25:20] when the spouse kills the spouse
[1:25:24] but she did get 45 years of free room
[1:25:27] and board
[1:25:30] so in this time of inflation
[1:25:33] well anyway
[1:25:36] but now look what Satan's trying to do
[1:25:37] he's trying to separate you and I
[1:25:40] but he can't that's the beauty of it my
[1:25:43] brother and sister your name as a
[1:25:45] prophet said cannot be taken from the
[1:25:49] Lamb's Book of Life so the separation
[1:25:51] that Satan is seeking he cannot
[1:25:54] accomplish because the prophet of God
[1:25:56] give us a Clear Vision amen aren't you
[1:25:59] glad God's got binoculars that look
[1:26:01] through time and understand what we
[1:26:03] don't understand and the prophet of God
[1:26:05] said no those names cannot under any
[1:26:09] circumstance be removed from the book
[1:26:11] and I say Lord I claim that position I
[1:26:14] claim my position as one who can never
[1:26:17] be separated from the presence of God
[1:26:20] Amen but as a devil he's coming he's
[1:26:24] trying to separate you have any of you
[1:26:25] ever experienced that the devil's just
[1:26:27] trying to influence you cause you to
[1:26:29] pull back cause you to not want to
[1:26:31] Fellowship cause you to not want to pray
[1:26:33] not read your Bible just pull back from
[1:26:36] everything he's trying to separate but
[1:26:38] what he doesn't realize is he cannot do
[1:26:41] that for a real son or daughter of God
[1:26:43] and Satan in his effort to separate my
[1:26:47] brother and sister has come he can't
[1:26:49] separate you
[1:26:51] so he's going to convince you to
[1:26:54] separate yourself
[1:26:58] because he's smart enough to realize I
[1:26:59] don't have the authority
[1:27:01] I'd have to go in there and take the
[1:27:04] book
[1:27:06] and then ask God would you mind
[1:27:10] scratching that name out
[1:27:13] one he doesn't even have authority to
[1:27:15] take the book
[1:27:16] you'll find nowhere my brother and
[1:27:18] sister that he can take the book
[1:27:22] so what does he do he works overtime
[1:27:25] trying to convince you and I that the
[1:27:28] investment
[1:27:30] as a
[1:27:32] blood-bought believer
[1:27:35] see here's where we come in the conflict
[1:27:36] people say Christian my brother and
[1:27:38] sister in the day we live in Christian
[1:27:40] is defined now under these new liberal
[1:27:44] definitions as anyone who believes there
[1:27:46] is a God
[1:27:48] the Devil by these terms would be a
[1:27:51] Christian
[1:27:54] because the devil knows God is real
[1:27:56] and he knows God's power and authority
[1:27:59] is he a believer
[1:28:02] oh I got you on that one he is a
[1:28:04] believer
[1:28:05] but I'm I'm tricking you here so pardon
[1:28:08] me he's a Believer he knows he knows he
[1:28:12] can't separate you from the love of God
[1:28:15] but ain't gonna stop him from trying
[1:28:17] and he believes if he stays after it
[1:28:19] long enough makes your life difficult
[1:28:22] enough throws enough roadblocks in your
[1:28:24] way that you yourself will give up
[1:28:28] oh isn't that a clever devil
[1:28:30] well he wasn't clever enough my brother
[1:28:33] and sister to be able to work around the
[1:28:37] Holy Ghost
[1:28:38] around the opening of the word amen so I
[1:28:42] want you to look at these trials and
[1:28:44] struggles that you have sometimes that
[1:28:45] feel so difficult feel like you're
[1:28:47] overwhelmed and I just want you to
[1:28:49] remember that that's just the devil
[1:28:51] trying to convince you to give up
[1:28:54] convince you to walk away because he's
[1:28:58] certainly not convincing God
[1:29:00] he can't now in the sermon presuming
[1:29:06] sorry about that brother get in I'll
[1:29:07] beat you to the punch
[1:29:12] in his way of trying to deceive or Draw
[1:29:15] us away
[1:29:16] comes along with all kinds of clever
[1:29:19] little tactics
[1:29:21] now I know that that we are not a
[1:29:23] television people but I know for a fact
[1:29:25] of how the world is in television and
[1:29:28] they will take something that might be
[1:29:30] on television that's interesting to
[1:29:31] people
[1:29:32] and then they will insert an ad of
[1:29:36] somebody standing there cutting up you
[1:29:38] know a tomato one of the softest things
[1:29:40] there is and they'll tell you we have
[1:29:42] this set of knives not for only 29.95
[1:29:46] each month
[1:29:50] you can have these knives that never get
[1:29:52] dull
[1:29:54] and they present it in such a fashion
[1:29:56] that people are like our knives are dull
[1:29:59] I can't even cut a tomato
[1:30:02] I don't eat tomatoes but I can't cut a
[1:30:04] tomato
[1:30:08] give me a set of knives
[1:30:09] 29.95 for six months yeah I don't care
[1:30:12] that's only 30 bucks
[1:30:15] and they get these knives
[1:30:17] that won't cut nothing
[1:30:20] and they say well I'll just return them
[1:30:22] and a year later they're still fighting
[1:30:25] to get their money back
[1:30:28] how clever Satan markets how clever he
[1:30:33] presents his program
[1:30:36] that people jump in and the prophet of
[1:30:38] God reminded us that sin will take us
[1:30:41] further than we want to go
[1:30:45] and there's been many an individual
[1:30:46] that's been caught in that amen so look
[1:30:49] at this they call it a little clean fun
[1:30:51] a little pleasure that people have to
[1:30:53] have to give vent now we're going to get
[1:30:55] personal who of us need event
[1:30:59] yeah I think everyone here if we're
[1:31:01] honest we need event well good let's
[1:31:03] find the correct event amen let's not
[1:31:07] find the devil's version of event
[1:31:10] amen now lesbian what if all that's a
[1:31:13] pleasure that a person ever got out of
[1:31:15] life what pleasure would it be to
[1:31:17] blanking your mind so blank you don't
[1:31:20] even know what you're doing then call it
[1:31:22] pleasure
[1:31:24] now you know that's it so let me share
[1:31:26] this I'm just full of all kinds of
[1:31:27] things today I'm sorry but when I I was
[1:31:30] still doing construction work so it's
[1:31:31] been a few years ago I worked with a
[1:31:33] couple young men and I remember one day
[1:31:35] where there I think we're pounding nails
[1:31:36] and the one guy is like oh my head's
[1:31:39] hurting and so you realize these two
[1:31:42] young men
[1:31:44] had been to the same party
[1:31:46] and the one young man turns to the other
[1:31:49] one while we're working and says wow
[1:31:51] wasn't that an awesome party
[1:31:53] and the other guy was like yeah yeah it
[1:31:56] was great
[1:31:58] well I guess
[1:32:00] I don't know I passed out
[1:32:03] did we have fun
[1:32:06] I remember it struck me I thought here
[1:32:08] it is
[1:32:10] he's taken himself the blanking of his
[1:32:13] mind so blank he don't even know what
[1:32:16] you're doing then call it pleasure
[1:32:19] he gulped down so much alcohol then in
[1:32:22] just a little while he passes out and
[1:32:25] he's laying on the floor and his friend
[1:32:27] says I I grabbed you by the hands and
[1:32:29] Drug you over behind the couch so they
[1:32:31] wouldn't step on you
[1:32:33] oh that was so much fun
[1:32:36] so much fun
[1:32:39] that pleasure had a price
[1:32:43] he was there finally he told the boss ah
[1:32:47] I've got a headache and the boss says Oh
[1:32:49] you mean hangover no no headache
[1:32:53] I needed to take a sick day
[1:32:56] the boss just like get out of here
[1:32:58] you're not doing anything anyway just go
[1:33:02] don't even know what you're doing now I
[1:33:05] could see men of the world doing that
[1:33:07] but when it comes to the church doing
[1:33:08] that people who call themselves
[1:33:10] Christians then it goes to show that
[1:33:12] there's been a letdown somewhere because
[1:33:14] that's not the way you forget sin
[1:33:17] my brother and sister we're not drinkers
[1:33:21] but we can find things to crowd into our
[1:33:24] mind into our life trying to do this
[1:33:27] well the pressure is so great I've got
[1:33:30] to deal with these things my brother and
[1:33:32] sister I'm guilty of this sometimes you
[1:33:34] get engrossed in things and it's there
[1:33:36] and you what we should do is go let off
[1:33:39] the pressure amen but it's their see and
[1:33:42] so what happens is we'll see
[1:33:45] all kinds of things take place
[1:33:49] that's why you should never when you're
[1:33:51] in that state of mind go to a car lot
[1:33:55] a place that sells recreational vehicles
[1:33:57] boats trains planes and maybe
[1:34:01] not even a grocery store
[1:34:05] boil those Oreos I'll tell you this is
[1:34:07] not funny but it is funny took our
[1:34:10] granddaughter to Arizona with us and she
[1:34:12] was not their home from Mexico but very
[1:34:15] very tired and not feeling well but you
[1:34:17] know my granddaughter was just a
[1:34:19] horrible influence on me because you
[1:34:21] know I'm in the store I'm a little bit
[1:34:23] bored you know and we're walking through
[1:34:24] a grocery store and we walk by the Oreos
[1:34:28] and I I was like I hear the Oreos
[1:34:31] calling my name my granddaughter's right
[1:34:33] behind me yeah Grandpa the Oreos are
[1:34:36] calling your name
[1:34:38] you need to respond to them and I hate
[1:34:41] to admit this because I know better my
[1:34:43] brother and sister we ate like two or
[1:34:45] three packages of Oreos in a week
[1:34:48] amen now look because we're allowing
[1:34:51] different things to come in and
[1:34:53] influence us and then we're trying to
[1:34:55] satisfy that but we're not of this world
[1:34:58] Amen so we cannot use the world's recipe
[1:35:01] to satisfy the longing of our soul amen
[1:35:05] so that's why the world today is doing
[1:35:08] what they're doing did you know right
[1:35:10] now that repossessions of automobiles
[1:35:12] are going up and you know one of the
[1:35:14] major automobiles that are being
[1:35:16] repossessed right now uh the ones that
[1:35:19] are going to save the planet can anybody
[1:35:20] tell me what those are
[1:35:23] Tesla Gonna Save the Planet but
[1:35:25] repossession of Teslas is going through
[1:35:28] the roof because people said oh I need
[1:35:31] to do this good thing and this thing and
[1:35:33] besides that they're cool but I'm doing
[1:35:34] it for the environment and to look cool
[1:35:36] I mean I
[1:35:38] and now
[1:35:40] this is the repercussion
[1:35:42] because if
[1:35:43] 11 000 miles in three months you have to
[1:35:47] give it back means you could not afford
[1:35:49] it in the beginning
[1:35:53] so what are they doing they're trying to
[1:35:55] satisfy something inside of them
[1:35:59] the pleasure that they found by buying
[1:36:02] this car and I'll be honest with you
[1:36:04] there's something euphoric about that
[1:36:07] amen something very euphoric about
[1:36:09] buying that I mean it all I don't know
[1:36:12] that the number matters but just buying
[1:36:15] something there's a little euphoric
[1:36:16] because a little something goes with
[1:36:18] that
[1:36:20] you know bought a chopper one time spent
[1:36:23] a few hundred thousand dollars wrote the
[1:36:25] check I didn't even make it home sister
[1:36:26] Jerry and I had been in in Colorado to
[1:36:29] look at this didn't he make it home
[1:36:31] and I'm having buyers more how am I
[1:36:33] going to pay for this thing what am I
[1:36:34] doing why did I sign what did I Mom
[1:36:35] what's going on here
[1:36:40] because there's something there this is
[1:36:42] what I need this is what I want
[1:36:44] and Satan uses that
[1:36:47] now you see that that Spirit come right
[1:36:50] into the church
[1:36:51] and so that's not the way you forget
[1:36:53] your sins that's right sinning will
[1:36:56] never cause us to forget our sins
[1:36:58] but they're on God's book and the only
[1:37:01] way they can ever be gotten rid of is to
[1:37:03] put in the sea of forgetfulness the
[1:37:06] blood of Jesus Christ then remembered
[1:37:08] against you no more Can someone say Amen
[1:37:11] Lord hallelujah that's the only way but
[1:37:14] they presume that the right way to do it
[1:37:17] it the right way the regular the people
[1:37:19] does it so we're just well everybody
[1:37:21] this this what they're doing this what
[1:37:23] they do this what they do this what they
[1:37:24] do my brothers and sister we weren't
[1:37:26] called to be like them
[1:37:28] amen sister Jerry and I on our way to
[1:37:30] church just passing by a certain church
[1:37:32] and we're commenting about the parking
[1:37:34] lot is getting Fuller and Fuller and
[1:37:36] Fuller sister Jerry in in a bit of humor
[1:37:39] says yes maybe they subscribe to that
[1:37:41] three-part deal of growing your church
[1:37:44] but my brother and sister if that's the
[1:37:46] way we grow our church what are we doing
[1:37:48] we're getting numbers
[1:37:50] that's right and when we sing the song
[1:37:52] I'm in that number it's not talking
[1:37:54] about the number of the grow the church
[1:37:56] amen this is in the bloodbot number amen
[1:37:59] this is the number that has found what
[1:38:02] they need in Jesus Christ amen now let
[1:38:06] me get this so I hope I kind of butcher
[1:38:08] that up but I hope you you're catching
[1:38:10] that my brother and sister because you
[1:38:12] see if the church lets down the people
[1:38:15] typically will either have to leave to
[1:38:18] find truth or they'll let down with the
[1:38:20] church
[1:38:23] so as we look at this let me just move
[1:38:25] forward
[1:38:26] once again I want to say pleasure has a
[1:38:28] price
[1:38:29] what is the return on that investment
[1:38:33] did you know that the believer receives
[1:38:35] more than they ever paid
[1:38:37] I have got an investment this morning
[1:38:40] for you
[1:38:41] that will give you returns so much
[1:38:45] greater than you ever paid
[1:38:49] because we had a debt that we could not
[1:38:51] pay
[1:38:52] and now that debt is paid
[1:38:54] and the return on the investment do you
[1:38:57] think Jesus Christ went to Calvary which
[1:39:00] was just the Earthly expression of what
[1:39:01] took place before the foundation of the
[1:39:03] world did he go to Calvary hoping you
[1:39:07] would come and serve him
[1:39:09] no sir our God is a sure thing investor
[1:39:13] amen he poured out his Precious Blood at
[1:39:16] Calvary and he knew that there was a
[1:39:19] seed a bride a body a believer that
[1:39:23] would respond to that and she would come
[1:39:26] and she would give her life and invest
[1:39:29] it back into Christ because she is so
[1:39:32] thankful and loves him amen and there's
[1:39:36] where the investment comes by and gone
[1:39:38] now I know that's kind of maybe a rude
[1:39:40] way to put it to put God as an investor
[1:39:42] but I'm telling you he was willing to
[1:39:43] pour his blood out to see you and I
[1:39:46] redeemed and he said that we were the
[1:39:49] very apple of his eye amen and as us
[1:39:52] almost David put it it was not just some
[1:39:54] common Apple that will rot away but it
[1:39:57] was Apples of gold uh or I got that
[1:40:00] right yeah amen so my brother and sister
[1:40:02] it is there that it's not just a simple
[1:40:05] investment that he just hoped he knew
[1:40:08] thank you Lord you knew I would serve
[1:40:10] you you knew amen hallelujah and when
[1:40:14] our debt was too great he paid it now I
[1:40:18] want to draw out of the prodigal here as
[1:40:21] we just move right along
[1:40:22] amen
[1:40:25] here in the prodigal brother Branham
[1:40:28] talking about the Prodigal Son
[1:40:30] it's also incredible
[1:40:34] go study it listen to it if you don't
[1:40:36] have a whole lot of time just go about
[1:40:38] 10 paragraphs in front of this and 10
[1:40:40] paragraphs behind this and you'll find
[1:40:42] that very awesome reading
[1:40:44] I was first converted a young lady come
[1:40:46] and said brother Branham what pleasure
[1:40:49] do you get out of life if you don't
[1:40:50] smoke drink or go to the shows or
[1:40:52] anything
[1:40:57] you know when I started working my way
[1:40:59] back to Christ
[1:41:01] one of the greatest struggles I had
[1:41:05] was music
[1:41:06] I hit it well
[1:41:08] I didn't flaunt it in front of my wife
[1:41:11] I didn't want to subject my children to
[1:41:13] it
[1:41:14] but I had a music Problem
[1:41:18] I hope you see the humor
[1:41:20] I've got
[1:41:22] corrected by a couple mothers here in
[1:41:24] the church for even bringing up
[1:41:27] the history of Music problems when their
[1:41:30] children were walking around the home
[1:41:32] singing a little lyric line then it's
[1:41:35] like brother Paul don't do that ever
[1:41:36] again please
[1:41:37] so my brother and sister I'm even you
[1:41:40] know God's kicking the dregs out yeah I
[1:41:43] thought I'd got rid of the dregs right
[1:41:44] but God's kicking the dregs out to even
[1:41:46] bother making reference of these terms
[1:41:49] that were anointed by the devil to
[1:41:51] anoint a whole world to yield to the
[1:41:54] devil amen so you look at this and you
[1:41:57] realize that there are certain things
[1:41:58] that we have to be careful that the
[1:42:01] pleasure we extract
[1:42:05] is not in some way connected
[1:42:08] to our past
[1:42:12] made me feel good when I was out in the
[1:42:14] world unsaved
[1:42:16] still kind of makes me feel good now
[1:42:19] what is that
[1:42:21] anointing on the flesh
[1:42:24] the flesh
[1:42:26] sister Jerry and I was at the Science
[1:42:28] Center
[1:42:29] and it's so interesting because they
[1:42:32] have you can make different selections
[1:42:34] of music and they have this steel
[1:42:36] filings and this music is is the steel
[1:42:40] filings have a mild magnetic attraction
[1:42:44] because just holding them there
[1:42:46] and then you play Beethoven
[1:42:49] and there
[1:42:56] push the button
[1:42:58] down now and these things are like
[1:43:04] and I'm like
[1:43:06] I used to like that song
[1:43:09] what was it doing to me
[1:43:14] it wasn't bringing peace
[1:43:16] wasn't bringing comfort
[1:43:19] it was anointing me to take radical
[1:43:23] actions
[1:43:27] yeah
[1:43:28] can't tell you how many times as a
[1:43:30] teenager driving when you drive out to
[1:43:33] brother Adams sister Sarah's that
[1:43:35] Highway used to be just a little narrow
[1:43:37] thing with a huge drain ditch and and
[1:43:39] seemed like it was foggier back then I
[1:43:41] don't know do you guys have fog now I
[1:43:43] still do okay but you know that road was
[1:43:46] a little narrow road and I can't tell
[1:43:47] you how many times as a teenager driving
[1:43:49] down that road my pickup listen that
[1:43:51] music and I get home and if my parents
[1:43:54] say one word to me I'm just gonna
[1:43:58] shut the music off walk in the house we
[1:44:00] told you to be home at 10
[1:44:02] I'm sorry
[1:44:05] where did that rebellious anointing come
[1:44:07] from
[1:44:09] not music
[1:44:11] and the spirit that came with it
[1:44:14] because as soon as I was shut off the
[1:44:17] Rebellion laughed and I knew I was
[1:44:19] supposed to be home at 10.
[1:44:22] hmm
[1:44:23] so here it is
[1:44:26] what pleasure do you get out of life if
[1:44:28] you don't smoke drink or go to shows or
[1:44:29] anything in a few nights after that
[1:44:32] about eight or ten Sinners come to the
[1:44:34] Altar and I said I have no more pleasure
[1:44:37] in that in one minute that you could
[1:44:40] have in the world in 10 years lost
[1:44:43] coming to God that's where we have
[1:44:47] pleasure is in the things of God my
[1:44:50] brother and sister are we a different
[1:44:52] class of people are you weird yes you're
[1:44:56] weird not to God to the world the world
[1:45:00] has turned the church into a lodge that
[1:45:02] is trying to give pleasure to the people
[1:45:05] when the pleasure should be in Jesus
[1:45:08] Christ when the pleasure should be in
[1:45:11] serving him and the pleasure should be
[1:45:13] in his presence the pleasure should be
[1:45:16] in calling out his name and reading his
[1:45:18] word but the pleasure becomes an
[1:45:21] activity that we're always reaching out
[1:45:23] trying to do that and you'll see the a
[1:45:26] church I listened to an interview of a
[1:45:28] man who's got a church that has now
[1:45:30] surpassed 5 000 people and they said how
[1:45:33] have you done this so quickly and he
[1:45:36] says I have found what the people want
[1:45:41] he didn't say what they need my brother
[1:45:43] and sister I found what the people want
[1:45:46] and we give them what they want
[1:45:51] oh I need the Holy Ghost I need Jesus
[1:45:55] Christ in my life and there's not I'm
[1:45:57] sorry to say this not every day of my
[1:46:00] life do I want that amen there's days I
[1:46:04] just think I'm such a way I'm going to
[1:46:06] turn and walk away I can't do this I'm
[1:46:09] not worthy and so my flesh does not want
[1:46:13] but God says I know what you need and
[1:46:17] I'm gonna meet your need
[1:46:19] hallelujah amen so there's where we have
[1:46:23] Pleasures Christians seeing newborn
[1:46:25] babes in Christ coming into the kingdom
[1:46:27] a soul that is eternal something that's
[1:46:30] real
[1:46:31] amen hallelujah
[1:46:35] I'm telling you my brother and sister
[1:46:36] pardon me for saying this you can't
[1:46:38] hardly function in the world without
[1:46:39] seeing references to things but I'm
[1:46:41] telling you if you guys think the new
[1:46:43] Barbie movie is real
[1:46:46] hmm
[1:46:48] but there's little girls out there the
[1:46:49] only thing they want to be now is Barbie
[1:46:51] they just watched it I just read a
[1:46:54] little deal this dad's asking a
[1:46:56] psychologist is it normal that my
[1:46:58] daughter has watched Barbie I think it
[1:47:00] was seven times
[1:47:03] I don't think that's normal
[1:47:07] same psychologist
[1:47:10] says you know
[1:47:12] she's just living out
[1:47:15] something that's inside of her
[1:47:19] later this same psychologist said we
[1:47:21] have to be careful about giving our
[1:47:23] children too much religion that it
[1:47:25] doesn't warp their life
[1:47:28] Barbie's not going to
[1:47:30] the word of God is going to warp your
[1:47:32] life young people
[1:47:34] come on my brother and sister what is it
[1:47:37] it's that Spirit of pleasure
[1:47:39] not godly pleasure worldly pleasure and
[1:47:43] they're promoted as normal that it's
[1:47:46] okay to throw yourself into that
[1:47:48] pleasure but this over here you need to
[1:47:51] guard yourself
[1:47:54] um
[1:47:55] well Hallelujah
[1:47:57] I tell you what we'd have sister Sheriff
[1:47:59] you'd come
[1:48:04] we found the place
[1:48:06] we find pleasure in
[1:48:09] find pleasure in my Lord Jesus Christ
[1:48:12] Amen Let The Devil let me reiterate this
[1:48:15] I made a little comment to this earlier
[1:48:16] the devil is trying to redefine pleasure
[1:48:21] to the bride of Christ
[1:48:26] I don't want to get political on this
[1:48:27] but we can go to church we can hear
[1:48:29] preaching that causes us to jump Shout
[1:48:31] Scream and tear around but if there's no
[1:48:34] meat in that diet
[1:48:37] you'll walk out and within a day or two
[1:48:40] no you'll be right back where you was at
[1:48:43] amen we need a balanced diet
[1:48:47] and we find pleasure in the presence of
[1:48:49] God I find pleasure my brother and
[1:48:51] sister when I can worship from my heart
[1:48:53] with no restriction and we can jump and
[1:48:56] we can shout but I need to have a life I
[1:49:00] need to have a presence in my life that
[1:49:03] I can live it when I come back down
[1:49:05] amen when I leap up and shout and
[1:49:08] Hallelujah and praise God I don't want
[1:49:10] to just call that hey that's the
[1:49:12] evidence I want to be able to live it I
[1:49:15] want to be able to find pleasure on a
[1:49:17] Monday morning then I know he is my
[1:49:19] redeemer that I am called of him I am
[1:49:22] his son I am his daughter amen
[1:49:24] hallelujah that's what we want but see
[1:49:27] Satan is trying now in the day we live
[1:49:30] in to redefine what pleasure means to a
[1:49:34] Christian
[1:49:37] please
[1:49:38] you know the Lord has a place
[1:49:40] then he finds pleasure
[1:49:42] [Music]
[1:49:43] Hebrews 10 38 39
[1:49:48] I want to give you anti-type first
[1:49:52] now the just shall live by faith
[1:49:55] that's us in this line right here can
[1:49:57] someone say Amen they just shall live by
[1:49:59] faith that's us
[1:50:01] might as well put your name in there
[1:50:04] but if any man draw back my soul have no
[1:50:07] pleasure in him
[1:50:09] so here's a position that when we're
[1:50:11] living in faith God is has pleasure in
[1:50:13] us but when we draw back God has no
[1:50:16] pleasure in us but we are not see I love
[1:50:19] how the word always brings amen I don't
[1:50:21] have it here I was going to bring it out
[1:50:23] I should have put put that level up here
[1:50:25] put that balance on here but we are not
[1:50:28] of them
[1:50:29] God's not gonna have any pleasure of
[1:50:31] those that pull back but we are not of
[1:50:33] them amen clearly identified we are not
[1:50:37] of them
[1:50:38] amen who draw back into Perdition but of
[1:50:42] them amen so we have continuity now of
[1:50:45] living by faith and being of them that
[1:50:48] believe to the saving of the Soul
[1:50:50] oh hallelujah thank you Lord and I want
[1:50:54] to also to close this out and put the
[1:50:56] type to it here of Ephesians 1 amen
[1:50:59] quite long scripture here but just give
[1:51:02] me just a few more minutes Amen to the
[1:51:05] praise of the glory of his grace wherein
[1:51:07] he hath made us accepted in the Beloved
[1:51:11] we did not make ourselves amen we were
[1:51:14] formed by him this flesh was formed in
[1:51:17] His image but the soul was formed after
[1:51:20] the very image of the spirit of God
[1:51:24] oh thank you Lord the world says it's
[1:51:27] deformed God says it's perfect
[1:51:30] who we gonna listen to
[1:51:32] hmm
[1:51:34] in whom we have Redemption through his
[1:51:36] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[1:51:38] to the riches of his grace wherein he
[1:51:41] hath abounded towards us in all wisdom
[1:51:43] and Prudence having made known unto us
[1:51:47] the mystery of his will Can someone say
[1:51:51] he has given me the mystery of his will
[1:51:55] amen according to his
[1:51:58] good pleasure
[1:52:01] what God is doing here is recorded in
[1:52:03] Ephesians
[1:52:04] gives pleasure to God
[1:52:06] to bring it to you and I it gave God
[1:52:10] pleasure to reveal himself to you and I
[1:52:16] oh my brother and sister as we're here
[1:52:18] rejoicing saying thank you Lord for
[1:52:20] saving me God is just beyond this Veil
[1:52:23] we can't see in the flesh saying I am so
[1:52:26] happy I saved you
[1:52:29] I'm so happy I redeemed you it gives me
[1:52:33] joy to call you my wife it gives me joy
[1:52:37] to call you my bride oh Hallelujah
[1:52:42] then in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:52:44] of times he might gather together in one
[1:52:47] all things in Christ both which are in
[1:52:49] heaven and which are in Earth even in
[1:52:52] him
[1:52:53] in whom also we have obtained an
[1:52:58] inheritance
[1:52:59] Ming predestined according to the
[1:53:01] purpose of him who worketh all things
[1:53:04] after the counsel of his own will I'm
[1:53:07] going to tell you my brother and sister
[1:53:08] that there will get our eyes open one
[1:53:11] day we'll realize that it's in that time
[1:53:14] we're going to find that germ seed our
[1:53:17] theophany in the presence of almighty
[1:53:19] God when he says you know I'm going to
[1:53:21] send the Apostle Paul into this day and
[1:53:24] I'm going to send this one here and
[1:53:25] Martin Luther will be over here and I'm
[1:53:29] going to send oh put your name in there
[1:53:31] down into laodicea because it's going to
[1:53:34] be the most wicked age and I'm gonna
[1:53:36] have some people that are anointed to
[1:53:39] just say I believe the word I believe
[1:53:42] the word I don't understand and life can
[1:53:45] be hard but I believe the word
[1:53:48] and God says it gives me great pleasure
[1:53:50] to place you
[1:53:53] come on I don't want to go to naming all
[1:53:54] your names but he gave God great
[1:53:57] pleasure to place you in laodicea it
[1:54:01] gave him great pleasure to say I have
[1:54:03] already anointed that seed to produce
[1:54:06] what is necessary to bring forth fruit
[1:54:09] in laodicea oh this is no small thing my
[1:54:13] brother and sister no small thing oh
[1:54:17] Hallelujah that we should be to the
[1:54:19] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[1:54:22] Christ and whom ye also trusted that
[1:54:25] after he heard the word of Truth The
[1:54:27] Gospel of your salvation in whom also
[1:54:29] after that ye believed that believing my
[1:54:33] brother and sister was after your
[1:54:36] confession and in that confession you
[1:54:39] were acknowledging what God already
[1:54:41] spoke
[1:54:42] take that now I want to tie this
[1:54:44] together maybe you'll think I'm on a
[1:54:46] limb but we have come to the place we
[1:54:49] understand that we have to speak our
[1:54:51] healing
[1:54:53] you can't just say well if God wants to
[1:54:54] heal me he'll heal me and in the
[1:54:56] meantime I'm just going to sit down here
[1:54:58] and wait and see what God's will is no
[1:55:01] sir God wants you and I to be able to
[1:55:04] stand up and say he is my healer I am
[1:55:07] healed in the name of Jesus Christ well
[1:55:10] I tell you can tie that right back to
[1:55:12] that moment when God allowed you to be
[1:55:16] awoke person
[1:55:21] I've had a person tell me believe her I
[1:55:24] don't even want to hear the word woke
[1:55:26] now is this island woke this and woke
[1:55:29] that and I said and when did you wake up
[1:55:31] he looked
[1:55:33] right okay

[1:55:37] I'm woke I recognize I was in him before
[1:55:40] the foundation of the world I recognize
[1:55:42] I've always been a son I recognize I am
[1:55:46] his bride I'm woke I have woke up and
[1:55:50] you take that rhyme back in the message
[1:55:51] of prodigal and the prophet of God tells
[1:55:54] that little story of a mother and a
[1:55:57] father and their prayer in the night and
[1:55:59] when their son woke up in the morning
[1:56:01] he'd come to himself
[1:56:04] he was woke
[1:56:06] Hallelujah
[1:56:08] oh
[1:56:10] my oh my
[1:56:11] I don't know what county I'm in
[1:56:14] but I'll tell you what the price is paid
[1:56:18] amen the price of pleasure

[1:56:31] hour I find pleasure in serving the King

[1:56:50] somewhere had to be in the back of his
[1:56:51] mind he said you know Paul I don't
[1:56:53] understand how you can waste so much
[1:56:54] time going to church

[2:06:19] just my parting words but we've all been
[2:06:23] there when the devil
