[27:14] amen amen if you'll stand with me
[27:18] we have several prayer requests here
[27:19] tonight just to mention
[27:22] also i want to mention to announce that
[27:24] there's a work day saturday morning
[27:26] i think it's around 7 00 80 we'll kind
[27:28] of try to
[27:29] find that out from brother isaac and
[27:31] maybe some of you already know
[27:33] you know i don't know but if any
[27:36] questions you can check with brother
[27:37] isaac on that
[27:38] for saturn this coming saturday the
[27:40] seventh
[27:42] and then we want to remember brother
[27:44] sergey and his mother
[27:47] in prayer that uh god would just
[27:49] continue to direct
[27:50] their path direct their way and uh
[27:54] give them strength give them healing
[27:57] body physical strength and just
[28:00] know how to answer know how to speak
[28:03] amen let's just remember them in prayer
[28:06] sister jerry mom jerry grandma jerry
[28:08] however you want to refer to her
[28:10] she's all of that to us so just remember
[28:12] her in prayer
[28:13] i know that gets lonely but just
[28:15] continue to remember that god would just
[28:17] stir her hearts or her soul
[28:19] and just keep her just ever present
[28:21] every remembrance of him every day
[28:23] amen brother vasily he's out in the
[28:26] in the on the road so let's remember him
[28:29] sister tomah
[28:30] in ukraine remember her in prayer
[28:33] and then also brother jason has found
[28:37] out that he's been exposed to some
[28:38] coveted work and that's why he
[28:40] decided he probably shouldn't i guess he
[28:43] thought he didn't know for sure if he
[28:44] was but he thought that's the way he
[28:46] kind of said it to me
[28:49] in the proximity so he felt like he just
[28:51] hold off for maybe two or three days
[28:53] four days maybe
[28:54] sunday or whatever if the lord lord
[28:56] wills and
[28:57] just see what you know kind of so he
[29:00] doesn't
[29:01] become a carrier amen so
[29:04] and that's why their family is not here
[29:07] and then also
[29:08] um a lot of that brother paul wants to
[29:10] mention our brother you know about
[29:12] sister karen's passing and uh i know
[29:15] brother paul has something to say about
[29:17] that and also a brother brother hugo
[29:19] vega too and um
[29:22] and then also let's remember brother
[29:24] donnie's church and the and the saints
[29:26] there because
[29:27] and there's i i've been told there's
[29:30] about a hundred that are sick
[29:32] and there's about 11 of them are in the
[29:34] hospital
[29:36] so let's just keep that in prayer
[29:39] and things are and there's many i've
[29:41] heard of others that have passed here
[29:43] recently and brother
[29:44] stephen francis in in south africa
[29:47] and i guess he has a memorial service
[29:50] this saturday
[29:51] and then also a brother from wichita
[29:53] kansas a brother i can't think of his
[29:55] first name
[29:56] you remember that first name i think a
[29:59] pastor there in wichita leaving a family
[30:01] to end the message so just remember them
[30:04] as many
[30:05] let's just pray that god will just keep
[30:07] us strong in the word
[30:09] looking at the fact that all things work
[30:11] together for good to them to love god
[30:13] and hold that word forth amen
[30:16] before us in in complete trust
[30:20] because god knows how to how to do
[30:22] things just right
[30:23] he allows things but we just pray that
[30:26] god will just remember
[30:28] us in these things and them also amen
[30:31] and then
[30:32] see if i'm forgetting anything oh
[30:34] kristen nash had that request for
[30:36] brother carl
[30:37] maybe we prayed for carl and his wife
[30:39] his wife's out of the hospital yeah
[30:41] but carl is still in the hospital i see
[30:43] you with pneumonia
[30:45] so we want to remember him i don't know
[30:47] if he had kind of a setback or what but
[30:48] let's remember him in prayer
[30:50] and also dyna and i would like you to
[30:52] remember our daughter sarah
[30:53] she's also been diagnosed with covid and
[30:56] just keep her in prayer and then andrew
[30:59] i don't think he's had been checked but
[31:01] he's he's not feeling well has been
[31:03] feeling bad
[31:04] and he said that he possibly had him and
[31:06] her dog our granddaughter abigail
[31:09] has been diagnosed so and they never had
[31:12] that
[31:12] originally and so whatever i just
[31:15] know that god's in control we pray that
[31:18] god whatever it takes
[31:21] you know for unsaved not unsaved i i
[31:23] know abigail and
[31:24] and sarah my boy nathan are saved
[31:28] i can't call them unsaved they are saved
[31:31] they're backslid
[31:33] but blacksliding doesn't unsave you
[31:38] you may lose a reward but it doesn't
[31:39] unsave you
[31:41] amen so so just remember them i believe
[31:44] god will and has to bring them back
[31:45] because we lay a token before over them
[31:48] and i know brother others believe the
[31:50] same thing
[31:52] so

[42:52] man good to be here this evening saints
[42:55] amen i want to just take just a moment
[42:59] here at the beginning just to
[43:03] kind of speak a little bit you know we
[43:06] we see
[43:08] the signs my brother and sister of the
[43:11] day that we're living in
[43:13] and you know it just seems in the last
[43:15] little bit
[43:18] we have just had a tremendous amount
[43:21] of brothers and sisters
[43:24] going you know over passing on to the
[43:27] other side into the presence of the lord
[43:30] and um you know i was invited uh
[43:33] by some brothers to be part of a little
[43:36] uh
[43:38] chat thing you know and in that you know
[43:40] there's just a lot of
[43:42] a lot of things that comes about and
[43:44] there has been
[43:45] all over the world uh a tremendous
[43:48] amount of pastors of ministers
[43:51] that have passed away and just these
[43:53] last three or four months
[43:55] you know you look at that some of them
[43:57] are elderly
[43:59] but some of them in just days
[44:02] or you might say short weeks before they
[44:04] passed away were
[44:05] just healthy you know full of
[44:08] vitality and just going and then they're
[44:11] gone and
[44:12] we know this one thing that we cannot
[44:16] pass from this life without god's
[44:19] approval
[44:20] amen there's no accidents to sons and
[44:23] daughters of god there's no
[44:24] just circumstance we are not that's why
[44:27] we are while we are not foolish
[44:30] while we are not careless we still know
[44:33] that things like
[44:34] coven now i was listening to a little
[44:37] deal today and
[44:39] this government official was saying the
[44:42] people
[44:42] should be afraid and so look at the
[44:46] spirit that's on the earth today but
[44:48] see we're not afraid because
[44:51] all fear has been taken from us
[44:55] but yet we have because of our
[44:57] stewardship as sons and daughters of god
[44:59] we have a healthy respect you know as it
[45:01] is we wash our hands
[45:03] from their jason sister emmy not here
[45:05] tonight
[45:06] but i'm sorry to tell you i hugged
[45:09] brother jason
[45:10] yesterday and i think brother ivan did
[45:14] too or you know anyway all the timing of
[45:18] these things you see
[45:19] um but we trust more in god
[45:23] we're not fearing this we're trusting in
[45:26] the lord amen
[45:28] so as you i had shared on the church
[45:31] site
[45:32] uh with you sister karen pruitt has gone
[45:35] to be with the lord this morning
[45:37] you know sister karen i never really
[45:40] knew her myself sister jerry had
[45:42] opportunities in louisiana camp
[45:44] uh to establish a friendship
[45:47] and she's just a loving lovely
[45:50] loving sister just always there to help
[45:53] and encourage
[45:54] and as
[45:59] brother tim's love affair of all these
[46:02] years
[46:03] um let's not just pray for him
[46:06] for a day or two remember him
[46:09] it's going to be difficult remember him
[46:12] in the next few
[46:14] weeks or months and you know a loving
[46:17] family a church family there just very
[46:19] close
[46:21] and you know sometimes we don't really
[46:24] know how to express this because when
[46:26] you see someone suffering
[46:30] you know you kind of feel like lord just
[46:32] heal them or
[46:34] take them home and still the
[46:37] the pain of the separation is great and
[46:40] so just remember them and also our
[46:42] brother hugo
[46:43] vega ricomi uh first pastor in south
[46:46] america
[46:47] to open up a pulpit to me uh
[46:50] specifically
[46:51] we traveled there with um
[46:55] my niece and nephew uh and with my
[46:58] brother-in-law
[47:00] uh we're happy to have you guys with us
[47:02] amen uh traveled
[47:03] down there in that first part of south
[47:05] america with my brother
[47:07] brother flint and um brother hugo opened
[47:10] that and
[47:11] just a very loved brother and um
[47:14] here again some health issues and then
[47:17] cove would come along and people are
[47:19] like sad oh this has taken him
[47:21] but remember this is all in god's time
[47:24] everything that happens in god's time we
[47:27] need to remember that there's not
[47:29] one portion of our life that should not
[47:33] be based on god's time
[47:36] amen i know when we go to rush things in
[47:39] our life
[47:40] uh we can look back and say lord i wish
[47:42] i'd have been on your time
[47:44] instead of my own so remember uh their
[47:47] family
[47:48] um just the little church there
[47:52] they do have a minister brother that has
[47:54] been very faithful
[47:55] uh in lifting up the saints there and uh
[47:59] freidy and um so
[48:02] just remember brother hugo's family and
[48:04] the church also
[48:06] amen i'd like to speak to you tonight on
[48:09] the wisdom
[48:10] of the prudent and it's kind of funny
[48:12] because we were talking about we were
[48:14] joking a little bit with the brothers
[48:16] about part whatever thank you sister
[48:18] ruth
[48:18] about part whatever and uh so i just
[48:21] left off the age-old proverbs tonight
[48:23] just to break that up a little bit
[48:25] there's no part anything here
[48:27] and uh so we're just going to talk
[48:29] tonight for a few minutes on the wisdom
[48:32] of the prudent
[48:33] and so i want you to look as we come
[48:35] into this scripture you're going to find
[48:37] what would be seemingly a paradox of the
[48:40] words and
[48:42] so we have to remember as brother
[48:44] branham brought it out
[48:46] the rain falls on the just and the
[48:49] unjust
[48:50] and so we look at this and whatever is
[48:53] you might say an attribute of the bride
[48:56] you're going to find
[48:57] very similar attributes in the world
[49:00] today
[49:01] you will find people that don't even
[49:02] claim to be christians that live
[49:04] very very very moral lives
[49:07] and raise their kids without television
[49:09] without rock and roll without these
[49:12] things
[49:12] but you see my brother and sister it's
[49:14] not just us living a good
[49:16] life it's not just our goal because as
[49:18] it would be somebody can satisfy that
[49:21] but what we are here is the
[49:24] manifestation
[49:25] of jesus christ in the day that we live
[49:28] that's what we were called for saints
[49:30] not just
[49:30] to live good moral lives because you can
[49:33] find
[49:34] as i've jokingly shared about carrie the
[49:36] hippie
[49:37] that sister jerry and i knew years ago
[49:39] right i'm just sure she has to be a
[49:41] christian she's got long hair
[49:42] always wears dresses but she's just like
[49:45] i'm sorry to disappoint you
[49:47] i'm just a hippie and so you know here
[49:51] she is
[49:51] a modest hippie because not all hippies
[49:53] are modest
[49:54] right so you know probably the majority
[49:57] of hippies are not modest but
[49:59] here is a lady that that just something
[50:02] in her
[50:02] this is what she manifested that did not
[50:05] make her a christian
[50:06] that did not mean that she was on the
[50:08] right track in life
[50:10] and so uh and in fact i'll put it the
[50:12] other way often times satan likes to
[50:15] come in to the very bride of christ
[50:17] and tempt us to let down our standard
[50:21] because he knows by getting us to lower
[50:23] our standard then that he has
[50:25] access to to our life in a in a greater
[50:28] fashion
[50:29] and so um oh i i have right here i just
[50:32] want to put this
[50:33] out now i think i have this correct uh
[50:36] sister sarah you guys are having a
[50:38] fellowship at your house
[50:39] saturday afternoon is it five five
[50:42] o'clock and then
[50:43] i know there was another i got confused
[50:45] about this reason i wanted to bring
[50:47] clarity to you i believe there's another
[50:49] fellowship on sunday afternoon and i'm
[50:52] not sure where that's at
[50:54] um so it's somewhere
[50:58] um uh anyway so there is a sunday
[51:01] fellowship so let's not get the two
[51:03] confused as brother paul did
[51:05] so anyway let's just stand my brother
[51:07] and sister and we'll go into the word
[51:09] tonight
[51:10] and i will find tonight we'll be dealing
[51:12] with both sides
[51:14] of the prudent we will look at this from
[51:17] both
[51:17] angles tonight and both of them from the
[51:21] scripture
[51:22] uh and so as we look let's just go to uh
[51:25] proverbs
[51:25] uh chapter 14. now this is a scripture i
[51:28] used in just a
[51:30] couple services back uh but i wanted to
[51:33] drive home
[51:34] as we're just looking at this from the
[51:36] position of wisdom
[51:38] and the prudence uh proverbs 14
[51:41] 8 the wisdom of the prudent is to
[51:44] understand
[51:45] his way now my brother and sister this
[51:48] isn't necessarily declaring
[51:51] a man filled with the holy ghost
[51:54] but you will find that when we come in
[51:57] the presence of god and he starts to
[51:58] change our life
[52:00] we become prudent we become because
[52:04] you see the word prudent means careful
[52:06] in his way or concern
[52:08] of the future so when we
[52:12] get closer to god we become more and
[52:14] more prudent with our lives
[52:17] we do not make irrational decisions
[52:20] to come back to fix them see that's why
[52:23] some of our trials that we're facing
[52:25] are as god's knocking can i put it this
[52:28] way
[52:28] sounds kind of almost irreverent but
[52:31] god's knocking the nonsense
[52:33] out of us amen
[52:36] the wisdom of the prudent is to
[52:38] understand his way but the folly of
[52:40] fools
[52:41] is deceit fools make a mock
[52:44] at sin i think my brother and sister we
[52:47] live in a world
[52:48] full of fools
[52:52] but among the righteous there is favor
[52:55] now i i'm
[52:56] not going to come back and make great
[52:57] emphasis on that so i just hold you for
[52:59] a moment
[53:00] is this not true do we not find
[53:03] favor in the sight of god
[53:07] look around our life my brother and
[53:08] sister you say but i i we labor we work
[53:11] hard we
[53:12] this we that we you know maybe have to
[53:14] mind every penny
[53:16] in our budget and we have to i'm sorry
[53:20] you just stop and look around you look
[53:22] at your background look at your nature
[53:24] look at the world you're living in
[53:27] and you'll realize very quickly we have
[53:30] found favor in the eyes of god
[53:34] the heart knoweth his own bitterness and
[53:37] a stranger
[53:38] does not inter-medal with his joy
[53:42] the house of the wicked shall be
[53:44] overthrown but the tabernacle of the
[53:46] upright
[53:47] shall flourish there is a way which
[53:50] seemeth right
[53:51] unto a man but the end thereof are the
[53:54] ways
[53:54] of death lord we ask for your blessings
[53:57] tonight upon your word
[53:59] father for every brother every sister
[54:01] every need father we just ask you
[54:03] come father for you are ever present
[54:06] help in the time of trouble
[54:08] and lord we know that you are our
[54:09] provider
[54:11] we commit these things to you in the
[54:13] name of jesus christ
[54:15] amen you may be seated now prudent is
[54:18] someone who has or
[54:19] shows good careful judgment now my
[54:22] brother and sister i think it's good
[54:24] that we could uh uh that we could
[54:28] know you know sometimes in life uh we
[54:31] have
[54:32] question marks we have things that uh
[54:35] we look out and say lord i i don't know
[54:38] exactly what direction to go i don't
[54:40] know exactly
[54:41] you know to to do this and and you know
[54:44] just having this conversation recently
[54:46] sometimes we're like do a
[54:48] a job do i do this or do i do that you
[54:51] see
[54:52] it's always just great in the natural
[54:55] let's just look at it for a moment from
[54:57] the natural isn't it no
[54:58] nice to just know to what right thing to
[55:01] do just to do it you know you go and
[55:03] i just know this is what is what i need
[55:05] to do
[55:06] and so you know in that oftentimes we do
[55:09] have you might say the green light
[55:11] where we just simply know uh this is
[55:14] what i need to do
[55:16] and it's good because when we can
[55:19] step in that realm and operate without a
[55:22] doubt you know doubt is like a drain
[55:25] upon your spirit doubt is uh and i'm not
[55:27] talking about doubt as in doubting your
[55:30] your faith i'm talking about
[55:31] you know am i doing the right thing you
[55:34] know almost like you know going to buy a
[55:36] car say and
[55:37] you look at the car and should i should
[55:39] i commit myself do i really want to
[55:42] uh you know spend uh i i'm from way back
[55:45] so you guys will have to forgive me but
[55:47] do i want to spend you know 250 dollars
[55:49] a month that's the one no radio no
[55:51] bumpers no headliner
[55:53] uh do i do i want to do that see and
[55:55] when you go into that with a doubt when
[55:57] you go in there to a question mark
[55:59] you'll ask actually find you've sowed
[56:01] the seed of buyer's remorse
[56:03] right because you're going to go home
[56:05] and the doubt has not been
[56:07] erased but let's just for this scenario
[56:09] take this you know you've budgeted
[56:11] you've saved you
[56:12] you have done all the right things and
[56:15] literally you're looking
[56:16] for a ten thousand dollar car and you
[56:18] have ten thousand dollars
[56:20] and so you go and you find the car with
[56:22] low miles it turned out to be
[56:24] you know mom's car and she just didn't
[56:26] drive much and
[56:28] it's had maintenance done and everything
[56:30] is perfect perfect tires and brakes and
[56:32] upholstery and paint
[56:34] and and you like this is the car and and
[56:36] you have no problem
[56:37] just stepping into that situation and so
[56:41] when we can eliminate as it were the
[56:43] doubt in our life
[56:45] when we can step beyond that now my
[56:47] brother and sister
[56:48] having said that i want you to
[56:50] understand that there's a certain amount
[56:51] of the things of life
[56:53] that we're always going to face uh that
[56:56] is going to have a second guess you
[56:58] might say a little
[56:59] question mark or something associated
[57:01] with it but
[57:02] you know to go here into the spiritual
[57:05] realm
[57:05] it is good to know without a doubt where
[57:08] we stand
[57:09] amen it's good to know that when we are
[57:12] moving forward and we read in the
[57:15] word and it shows us that every promise
[57:17] in this book is mine
[57:19] that you don't have any doubt that you
[57:21] can reach out and take a holds of that
[57:23] promise
[57:24] and god will honor that now very very
[57:27] a multitude of places brother branham
[57:30] talks about this he says now
[57:31] when we have met all the qualifications
[57:35] so my brother and sister there is a
[57:37] requirement on god's part
[57:39] that we can't just randomly live some
[57:41] sloppy life
[57:42] and come in and just claim all these
[57:45] promises of god in fact
[57:46] brother branham kind of invites a bunch
[57:48] of pentecostal preachers
[57:50] for having sloppy pulpits and then
[57:53] questioning why god is not moving in the
[57:55] midst of the church
[57:56] and so there is a certain qualification
[57:59] or quantifying
[58:00] that god requires amen but i want to put
[58:03] this thought to you tonight
[58:04] and and please don't take this as a die
[58:06] hard i just want to stir
[58:08] your thinking i think it might be good
[58:10] if we would pray for
[58:12] understanding just as much as we pray
[58:15] for results
[58:22] you see sometimes we ask
[58:25] god i put my hand up first so nobody
[58:27] will be embarrassed about where we're
[58:29] going here
[58:30] we want god to do this on this day in
[58:33] this way
[58:35] hey that almost rhymed
[58:38] and then it doesn't happen that way and
[58:40] then we start to doubt
[58:41] but you see what it is is we we were
[58:44] trying to prescribe to god what his will
[58:47] would be
[58:49] what his desire to us would be and
[58:52] because we
[58:53] approach the promises of god from our
[58:56] natural
[58:57] way because we are human then we would
[59:00] be looking at the promise and we
[59:02] say this is what god must have meant
[59:06] he said i'll be your provider
[59:11] now i hope you don't mind a little humor
[59:12] tonight but it would be lord my provider
[59:14] do i want a blue or a gray escalade
[59:19] maybe god says i'm just going to give
[59:21] you wheels so you don't walk
[59:28] but you see we're disappointed when it
[59:30] doesn't work out
[59:36] so to pray for understanding my brother
[59:38] and sister would be for us to be
[59:40] into the very mind and spirit of god
[59:44] to be praying saying lord thy will
[59:48] be done lord thy will not my will father
[59:51] i want to get in and understand lord
[59:54] what it is you want for me and my
[59:56] brother and sister look at the
[59:58] confidence that we walk in
[1:00:00] when we are in the will of god when the
[1:00:02] scripture says
[1:00:03] that he that doesn't have condemnation
[1:00:05] amen
[1:00:06] is god an unlimited outlet of the power
[1:00:09] of almighty god
[1:00:10] but satan comes and he looks at us and
[1:00:12] says i can limit him here
[1:00:14] and i can let him limit them here and
[1:00:17] here and here
[1:00:18] and by the time he's done with his
[1:00:20] limiting effect
[1:00:21] we my brother and sister come to church
[1:00:23] downtrodden i don't know i thought this
[1:00:25] is what i thought this i thought that
[1:00:27] but if we can get into the realm where
[1:00:29] we have
[1:00:30] the mind of god when we can walk in the
[1:00:33] realm that we can look at the scripture
[1:00:35] and say even though i have to say ouch
[1:00:38] tonight
[1:00:39] this is the truth and i'm going to live
[1:00:41] it
[1:00:42] amen and so then we come into and
[1:00:45] the understanding of what it is god
[1:00:48] desires for us
[1:00:49] now this goes much deeper than we'll
[1:00:51] touch tonight but my brother and sister
[1:00:53] we cannot fully grasp the authority that
[1:00:57] god has given us
[1:00:58] until we come to an understanding of the
[1:01:02] authority
[1:01:04] we can't randomly just say well i'm
[1:01:06] going to claim this in the name of jesus
[1:01:08] christ
[1:01:09] why are you claiming it what is the
[1:01:12] reason you're claiming it
[1:01:14] that's why oftentimes i hope you can
[1:01:16] understand so i just want to touch this
[1:01:18] just a little bit
[1:01:19] you can come sometimes and you can lay
[1:01:21] hands
[1:01:22] and pray for someone else and god will
[1:01:25] move
[1:01:26] and answer that prayer and you know for
[1:01:28] a fact that
[1:01:29] god answered the prayer in the way you
[1:01:31] prayed it you know that you were a part
[1:01:33] of what god just did
[1:01:35] but yet we will pray over things in our
[1:01:37] life you will find this in brother
[1:01:38] branham's own sickness in his own body
[1:01:41] he's praying for people they're being
[1:01:42] healed and he's claiming this
[1:01:44] and then suffering through this sickness
[1:01:47] my brother and sister you see what god
[1:01:49] is doing sometimes
[1:01:50] is he is allowing you to be a channel
[1:01:53] but
[1:01:54] we don't fully understand the whole
[1:01:56] equation and it's not just
[1:01:58] us we abide our faith with one another
[1:02:02] but remember the prophet of god taught
[1:02:03] that when they come see it's not my
[1:02:05] faith it's their
[1:02:06] faith so what we got to do is understand
[1:02:10] the moving of the power of god
[1:02:13] is not just understanding we can lay
[1:02:15] hands and people will be healed
[1:02:18] we can lay hands and people will be
[1:02:20] delivered
[1:02:22] it goes much deeper than that amen
[1:02:26] i hope you are you with me tonight
[1:02:33] so i say this again i think we should
[1:02:35] this is just my feelings
[1:02:37] oh i used that word didn't i feelings
[1:02:41] this is the way i see it
[1:02:44] we probably should pray for
[1:02:45] understanding more
[1:02:47] right maybe we can put that right there
[1:02:49] on the list just underneath
[1:02:51] patience
[1:02:55] but to pray for understanding because
[1:02:58] you see so many people saints
[1:03:00] are are uh kind of i'm going to use the
[1:03:02] word disturbed because they prayed and
[1:03:04] they prayed and they prayed
[1:03:06] and it doesn't seem like god is
[1:03:08] answering their prayer
[1:03:09] but partly it's because we're not
[1:03:11] understanding what god
[1:03:12] is trying to accomplish in our own life
[1:03:15] now you can go study it in the message
[1:03:17] you'll see where brother brown says
[1:03:19] i have to be careful when i go praying
[1:03:21] for people
[1:03:22] for deliverance because sometimes god
[1:03:24] allows
[1:03:25] these things to come on people to
[1:03:28] move them from their position and
[1:03:30] brother brown says i have to be careful
[1:03:32] about
[1:03:33] praying for deliverance so you're going
[1:03:35] to understand the will of god
[1:03:38] now god never put sickness upon a human
[1:03:41] people are like oh god let me get sick
[1:03:42] no he didn't but god pulled his hedge
[1:03:45] back
[1:03:46] and he let the devil who would love to
[1:03:47] make you sick come in
[1:03:49] and god says that's no problem because i
[1:03:51] know
[1:03:52] i have delivering power i know that i
[1:03:54] can change this situation
[1:03:56] but i need something to move this
[1:03:59] individual
[1:04:00] who is oh not you but people like you
[1:04:03] stubborn
[1:04:05] and overly determined and overly think
[1:04:08] we're right
[1:04:08] and overly think we're righteous and
[1:04:10] overly think that
[1:04:12] right there's a way that seemeth right
[1:04:16] that's correct
[1:04:19] so we have to understand that and i know
[1:04:22] brother david
[1:04:22] brother chris would know this as
[1:04:24] ministers there's been times saints i
[1:04:27] have prayed for people and i've fully
[1:04:28] determined when i laid hands on it i was
[1:04:30] just gonna cast that devil out or just
[1:04:33] claim it in the name of jesus christ
[1:04:34] and you find yourself praying lord thy
[1:04:37] will be done
[1:04:38] that's all you can do because there's
[1:04:41] something there
[1:04:42] that you recognize is checking you from
[1:04:45] taking the word and driving the devil
[1:04:48] away
[1:04:49] because you realize there's something
[1:04:50] just comes over you
[1:04:52] that god's doing something here all i
[1:04:54] want lord for this individual is your
[1:04:56] will be done
[1:05:00] that doesn't mean we love them any less
[1:05:02] or have any less desire to see them
[1:05:05] delivered but
[1:05:06] we're not here to contest as it were
[1:05:08] with god over what we want to accomplish
[1:05:11] and so it is there
[1:05:15] oftentimes i think that we come as a
[1:05:18] results-oriented oriented
[1:05:20] preacher
[1:05:24] we're praying with a goal orient
[1:05:27] we're this is lord this is what
[1:05:34] am i making sense
[1:05:38] we come and we have a very specific
[1:05:41] we're praying to the lord
[1:05:43] very specifically and there's nothing
[1:05:45] wrong with that
[1:05:46] saints but we need to as the word of god
[1:05:50] shows us brother random emphasis we need
[1:05:52] to say you know what
[1:05:53] lord thy will lord if you
[1:05:57] are willing lord so that we're not
[1:06:00] coming and saying you know what i prayed
[1:06:02] for brother so and so i prayed for
[1:06:03] sisters so and so
[1:06:04] and it didn't seem like god answered my
[1:06:07] prayer
[1:06:08] no no don't let the devil get that god
[1:06:12] answers prayer sayings
[1:06:14] and sometimes we're looking at the big
[1:06:16] picture and god's moving in the
[1:06:18] background
[1:06:19] amen what we don't need see this has
[1:06:21] happened so much in days gone by
[1:06:23] i pray it's not happening now but we
[1:06:25] when the days gone by there used to be
[1:06:27] great sweeping meetings
[1:06:29] and a lot of people young and old come
[1:06:31] and they got baptized and they made
[1:06:33] commitments and they did all this
[1:06:35] but there was no real conversion and so
[1:06:37] it was there that by the will of man
[1:06:39] people felt compelled to come to the
[1:06:42] water be baptized do all of these things
[1:06:45] but nothing really changed and what god
[1:06:47] wants is to start down in the background
[1:06:50] at the bedrock
[1:06:51] and he wants something within the soul
[1:06:53] not an emotional compelling
[1:06:55] not an emotional oh you don't want to go
[1:06:58] to hell
[1:07:01] don't don't do that we don't want to do
[1:07:03] that the will of god
[1:07:04] is something down in the inside says you
[1:07:07] know what i love you lord
[1:07:09] i want to serve you lord and and see
[1:07:11] that's where people don't understand
[1:07:13] when brother branham
[1:07:14] said you know what i even if i knew he
[1:07:16] was going to send me to hell
[1:07:17] i would still serve him it's because
[1:07:20] down in the very depths of that
[1:07:22] was a love for the things that god has
[1:07:25] done for his love to us
[1:07:26] his grace his mercy his blood and if
[1:07:29] somehow we recognize i'm coming up short
[1:07:31] of the goal
[1:07:32] lord it's not your fault help me lord
[1:07:36] but see people become angry now i won't
[1:07:38] ask anybody to raise a hand but it's
[1:07:40] more frequent than we
[1:07:42] realize that people become angry at god
[1:07:45] because prayers are not being answered
[1:07:46] and situations are not changing
[1:07:49] i've got a husband i've got a wife i've
[1:07:50] got children i've got parents i've got a
[1:07:52] friend
[1:07:53] and lord nothing's happening why aren't
[1:07:56] you answering me
[1:08:00] maybe they need to pass through the fire
[1:08:01] one more time
[1:08:03] maybe they need to go through the
[1:08:05] struggle of life one more time
[1:08:08] maybe god wants to take them to the
[1:08:09] brink of extinction
[1:08:12] so that he can bring them back so that
[1:08:15] they will never forget
[1:08:17] who they are and why they are here
[1:08:20] hallelujah it's hard my brother and
[1:08:22] sister and you think serving god is
[1:08:24] heart disco serve the devil
[1:08:26] and he will use you abuse you and trash
[1:08:29] you and abandon you
[1:08:33] people are like well it's just too hard
[1:08:35] being a christian wow
[1:08:38] wow look what the devil's got in store
[1:08:50] now
[1:08:52] trying to find myself here
[1:08:56] brother alex did we not get the paradox
[1:08:59] put in there
[1:09:02] we didn't okay that's fine no no problem
[1:09:05] at all
[1:09:06] i just didn't want to so in the message
[1:09:08] the paradox
[1:09:10] 61 12 10 brother branham says this it
[1:09:13] was a paradox when a great soldier
[1:09:15] of god by the name of jehoshaphat stood
[1:09:18] in the gates with a backslidden man by
[1:09:21] the name of ahab
[1:09:22] and said before we go to this battle
[1:09:25] is is not it a good thing that we
[1:09:29] consult the lord
[1:09:31] now look at this he he's going and he's
[1:09:34] something's compelling him to say
[1:09:36] i think we better stop and we better
[1:09:39] pray for understanding of the will of
[1:09:41] god
[1:09:42] is this something we should do or should
[1:09:45] we go home or
[1:09:46] whatever it might be now brother branham
[1:09:48] i brought this for these words right
[1:09:50] here so i'll read it real slow so i
[1:09:51] catch it
[1:09:52] now if that man's heart is hungry
[1:09:56] to know the will of god
[1:09:59] there's got to be a will of god
[1:10:02] somewhere
[1:10:05] now remember what brother branham taught
[1:10:06] us he preached this deep call
[1:10:08] to the deep so if there's something deep
[1:10:10] within the soul of a man or a woman
[1:10:13] to cry out to god there's got to be
[1:10:15] something there
[1:10:17] to answer this and now brother brown
[1:10:18] takes this same i'm going to use the
[1:10:20] word theory so forgive me if it isn't
[1:10:22] quite the right way
[1:10:23] brother branham takes this what would be
[1:10:24] the right word brother brown takes this
[1:10:26] context he takes this uh
[1:10:28] this principle this pattern would that
[1:10:31] be better put it that way
[1:10:32] he takes this and now he's applying this
[1:10:35] that if there's something in
[1:10:36] your heart that is desiring to know the
[1:10:39] will of god
[1:10:40] god's got a will expressly for you
[1:10:44] not some blanket will you know go to
[1:10:47] church be
[1:10:48] faithful pray read your bible but
[1:10:50] something specific
[1:10:52] for you now i believe it's the same my
[1:10:56] brother and sister he says that those
[1:10:58] that hunger and thirst after
[1:10:59] righteousness
[1:11:00] will be filled so if we're hungry and
[1:11:03] thirsty
[1:11:04] after the will of god for our life for
[1:11:07] our church our family whatever the
[1:11:09] situation might be
[1:11:10] then god's got a specific answer
[1:11:14] for you and i to guide us into his will
[1:11:22] have you ever suffered from the
[1:11:23] uncertainty of life
[1:11:26] and when i use that word suffer i mean
[1:11:28] suffer
[1:11:30] now i'll bring this back don't feel
[1:11:32] sorry for us i just feel like a
[1:11:34] use an example that's not one of you
[1:11:37] there was a time in our life sister
[1:11:39] jerry and i lost so much money several
[1:11:41] years in a row
[1:11:42] that had finally come up to the fact we
[1:11:44] weren't bankrupt we had more assets than
[1:11:46] we had debts
[1:11:48] but when your wife comes to you and says
[1:11:50] paul we have 80 000
[1:11:52] worth of bills and we have seventy eight
[1:11:53] hundred dollars in the bank uh
[1:11:55] what do you want me to do
[1:11:59] and you get up every morning with an
[1:12:02] uncertainty
[1:12:03] of life to compound this we had a man
[1:12:07] who showed up at seven o'clock
[1:12:09] every thursday morning wanting to know
[1:12:12] when are you going to pay the money
[1:12:15] me i was so frustrated i wanted to grab
[1:12:17] him choke him throw him off the step
[1:12:19] put him back in his car push it down the
[1:12:21] hill
[1:12:24] my wife was like paul it's not the right
[1:12:27] thing
[1:12:29] and then she'd turn to this man and say
[1:12:31] you realize
[1:12:32] it's still you know whatever it was 46
[1:12:35] days till we owe the money
[1:12:37] i know but this is my job and if i don't
[1:12:39] do my job they fire me and i've got a
[1:12:40] mortgage
[1:12:42] i'm going to be knocking on your door
[1:12:43] every thursday morning
[1:12:45] because i got a mortgage to pay okay
[1:12:48] good
[1:12:48] talk about uncertainty you know what
[1:12:50] happened saints
[1:12:52] i'll tell you just very briefly what
[1:12:53] happened paul
[1:12:55] was headed this direction turning into a
[1:12:58] wreck
[1:12:58] my wife was headed this direction saying
[1:13:01] god's in control paul don't forget
[1:13:03] god's in control all i could think of
[1:13:05] saints was
[1:13:06] everything i've worked for for years
[1:13:08] here is going away
[1:13:11] now that seems to be what happened right
[1:13:14] but i tell you what happened was behind
[1:13:16] the scenes
[1:13:18] god was making things in his
[1:13:20] supernatural realm
[1:13:23] take place and when it got really close
[1:13:26] that it looked like it was just going to
[1:13:27] be toast i finally resigned myself to
[1:13:30] the fact that this is always going to be
[1:13:31] over and this might be god's will so
[1:13:33] okay whatever
[1:13:34] and then the supernatural started coming
[1:13:36] a check from the bean company because
[1:13:38] and i won't go into all these details
[1:13:40] because of an issue
[1:13:41] and a check from a man that we had sold
[1:13:43] uh hey to
[1:13:44] that had uh uh you know was there was an
[1:13:46] issue
[1:13:47] as it was he told me like he could buy
[1:13:49] hay all day long at this price
[1:13:51] and then he went shopping for hay and
[1:13:52] realized that he had to pay considerably
[1:13:55] more
[1:13:55] and something stirred a dutchman
[1:14:04] to write a check for the difference and
[1:14:07] send it to me
[1:14:09] now this is a good man and i respect him
[1:14:11] right we're not talking about
[1:14:12] him but something stirred him and he was
[1:14:14] like
[1:14:15] i told you something and basically it
[1:14:17] was a lie
[1:14:19] here's a check for i don't remember the
[1:14:21] numbers now
[1:14:22] twenty thousand dollars not pocket
[1:14:25] change not fifty bucks
[1:14:28] but you see god moving in the background
[1:14:34] god doing what god does now my brother
[1:14:36] and sister i've used
[1:14:37] natural examples here but i'm telling
[1:14:39] you that is this the tip of the iceberg
[1:14:42] because god does deal in the natural but
[1:14:44] god specializes in the spiritual
[1:14:47] amen so while he's working in the
[1:14:50] natural he specializes
[1:14:52] in the spiritual amen so what it is my
[1:14:55] brother and sister if we suffer from the
[1:14:57] uncertainty of life
[1:14:58] it drains the joy from us and satan boy
[1:15:01] don't you know he wants you as a
[1:15:03] christian just to be down and out and
[1:15:05] pouty and
[1:15:06] life is horrible and nothing's going
[1:15:08] right in my life
[1:15:09] and whatever that's what satan desires
[1:15:11] so he's trying to drain the joy from you
[1:15:14] but when you come to the place that you
[1:15:17] have a certainty and that certainty
[1:15:19] might be
[1:15:19] all the rest of this is going to go away
[1:15:21] we might lose everything we own but i am
[1:15:24] a son of god
[1:15:25] i'm a daughter of god and you have that
[1:15:28] certainty
[1:15:28] suddenly all the things of the natural
[1:15:31] diminish
[1:15:32] in your sight and you realize it's not
[1:15:34] about that anyway
[1:15:35] it's not about what we possess in the
[1:15:37] natural but the fact that i have a
[1:15:40] certainty
[1:15:40] by the word of god that i am a son of
[1:15:43] god i'm a daughter of god
[1:15:45] and this work he began in me he is going
[1:15:48] to finish it
[1:15:49] hallelujah change your whole perspective
[1:15:52] you can
[1:15:53] say oh lord whatever it is amen
[1:15:56] when you come to that place now i hope
[1:15:58] you catch where i'm going right here
[1:16:00] you can come to the place that in the
[1:16:01] natural life so let's just talk about
[1:16:03] your finances
[1:16:04] the natural life there may be
[1:16:06] uncertainty of
[1:16:07] paying the mortgage or paying the rent
[1:16:10] or whatever it is
[1:16:11] there might be uncertainty there but you
[1:16:13] come to a place
[1:16:14] that you can walk in liberty because you
[1:16:17] have a certainty
[1:16:19] and because you know that you are
[1:16:21] anchored in that word of god and
[1:16:23] and you're able to take that and say oh
[1:16:26] lord
[1:16:27] thank you thank you lord i know what
[1:16:29] your will is
[1:16:30] it wasn't for me to be this super middle
[1:16:33] class or well-off or whatever
[1:16:34] it wasn't for me to be this or to be
[1:16:36] that it was for me
[1:16:38] to be a son or daughter of god and
[1:16:40] manifest the word
[1:16:41] in the laodicean age of all the people
[1:16:44] there is
[1:16:45] you chose me and i have a certainty i
[1:16:47] know
[1:16:48] it's the will of god that i live
[1:16:50] victorious that i live with praise on my
[1:16:53] lips and
[1:16:53] i live with a liberty in jesus christ
[1:16:57] hallelujah can somebody say lord let me
[1:16:59] know thy will
[1:17:01] amen that's what we want to know my
[1:17:03] brother and sister because when you know
[1:17:04] you're walking in the will of god
[1:17:06] you know you're walking and you are
[1:17:08] there now look you can go look this up
[1:17:10] study it for yourself
[1:17:12] i i could use it in another sermon but
[1:17:13] you can also study this out
[1:17:15] look at what brother branham talks about
[1:17:17] when people move over
[1:17:18] into the permissible will of god
[1:17:24] they're not lost i thought brother david
[1:17:26] you was going to preach my sermon for me
[1:17:28] tonight my brother and sister you get
[1:17:31] over there see
[1:17:32] we we can get in the permissible will of
[1:17:34] god and
[1:17:35] and that doesn't mean as it would be
[1:17:37] backslid
[1:17:38] doesn't mean god's just threw you off in
[1:17:40] the dumpster and you're gone
[1:17:42] but my brother and sister that
[1:17:43] permissible will is in no way
[1:17:46] the same as walking in that perfect will
[1:17:49] of god
[1:17:49] and i lift my hand hands tonight and say
[1:17:52] lord help me walk
[1:17:53] in thy perfect will let me walk lord
[1:17:56] according to that let me understand
[1:17:59] what your will is for my life
[1:18:04] because you might be there and all of
[1:18:06] that would be
[1:18:07] fine but my brother and sister if we're
[1:18:10] gonna walk
[1:18:11] well i've always put it this way i don't
[1:18:13] know where i come up with this maybe i
[1:18:14] plagiarized it
[1:18:16] but i'm telling you you're going to give
[1:18:18] your life
[1:18:19] now or then but you're going to give
[1:18:23] your life
[1:18:25] oh wouldn't it be much better just give
[1:18:26] our life as a bride of christ a walk in
[1:18:29] liberty
[1:18:30] knowing the will of god then to come and
[1:18:33] realize lord i wasted all those years
[1:18:36] and the persecution as it would we all
[1:18:37] have concepts of what the tribulation
[1:18:39] would be like i'm not trying to define
[1:18:41] that
[1:18:41] but to find yourself there knowing lord
[1:18:44] i messed up
[1:18:45] i missed it oh god i know i know
[1:18:48] that i am yours lord i know
[1:18:53] but yet unwilling here to give it god
[1:18:55] help us
[1:18:56] yes god help us to break through that
[1:18:59] self
[1:18:59] will that stubborn spirit that holds us
[1:19:02] back and
[1:19:03] i'm telling you this evening i hope it
[1:19:04] don't shake you or or
[1:19:06] make you nervous but i got both hands up
[1:19:08] saying lord help us
[1:19:09] amen not to be looking at all of the
[1:19:12] things around us right now and
[1:19:13] forgetting the supernatural
[1:19:21] now in the message be certain of god
[1:19:24] isn't that what we want to be see if
[1:19:27] you're certain of god
[1:19:29] you can take his word for anything he
[1:19:31] says
[1:19:33] amen and that beautiful but you see we
[1:19:36] can't do this if we're on the fence
[1:19:37] that's right you're not going to be able
[1:19:39] to take everything that god says to you
[1:19:41] if you're on the fence
[1:19:44] if one day you're on fire and the next
[1:19:46] day you're cold as ice
[1:19:48] boy isn't the devil like to do that
[1:19:53] if you're certain of god you can take
[1:19:54] his word for anything he says
[1:19:56] if you're not certain that he is god
[1:20:00] and this is a bible then you'd better be
[1:20:02] careful of what you're doing
[1:20:04] and i want to tie this back my brother
[1:20:06] and sister to
[1:20:08] kind of into this original scripture
[1:20:10] here
[1:20:11] uh in proverbs amen the wisdom of the
[1:20:14] prudent is
[1:20:15] understand his way but the folly of
[1:20:16] fools is deceit
[1:20:18] now in that folly of fools my brother
[1:20:20] and sister is someone
[1:20:22] hiding the truth from you amen
[1:20:26] the folly of fools is when
[1:20:29] they would give you something less than
[1:20:30] the truth when the truth would serve
[1:20:32] even them
[1:20:34] better but see there's an anointing
[1:20:37] there
[1:20:38] we're going to take this message and
[1:20:40] we're going to chop it up
[1:20:42] and we're only going to serve to you
[1:20:44] pardon me
[1:20:45] you get this little portion you get this
[1:20:48] little portion
[1:20:49] you get this little portion when we can
[1:20:52] hand out the hole amen
[1:20:55] let me just mimic it this way we can
[1:20:56] hand out the hole
[1:21:02] and there's still the hole to hand out
[1:21:07] it's not like we're gonna run short amen
[1:21:09] there's no shortage of the holy ghost in
[1:21:11] our lives
[1:21:12] amen there's no shortage of the word of
[1:21:14] god waiting to be manifested the
[1:21:17] presence of god
[1:21:18] waiting to come into our midst no
[1:21:20] shortage
[1:21:22] but you see there will be those that are
[1:21:24] anointed my brother and sister
[1:21:25] to deceive my heart actually goes out to
[1:21:28] that
[1:21:29] people that have to go and and when you
[1:21:31] question them show me in the bible
[1:21:33] they just skip off to something else
[1:21:36] because they can't back it up
[1:21:41] now if you can't find it here how are
[1:21:42] you going to know the will of god
[1:21:44] concerning it
[1:21:45] or if there is another interpretation
[1:21:48] and you respect this is the thing that
[1:21:50] catches people i respect
[1:21:52] brother so and so and uh what he's
[1:21:54] saying doesn't fit the bible but i
[1:21:56] respect him
[1:21:58] and so then you give his word equal
[1:22:00] weight to the bible
[1:22:01] yeah that's it that's not what the
[1:22:03] prophet said is it
[1:22:05] he said you take everything amen back to
[1:22:08] scripture
[1:22:10] that means as much as i love brother
[1:22:11] david i have to take everything brother
[1:22:14] david said back to scripture as much as
[1:22:16] i love brother chris's ministry i go to
[1:22:18] take everything
[1:22:19] back to scripture and i would hope that
[1:22:20] you would say the same thing concerning
[1:22:22] myself amen
[1:22:24] so you look at this see then you'd be
[1:22:26] better be careful what you're doing
[1:22:28] but if you're certain meet his
[1:22:32] requirements
[1:22:33] see this isn't a free ride oh we're in
[1:22:36] the message we got a free ride no we
[1:22:38] don't
[1:22:38] meet his requirements then faith takes
[1:22:42] it
[1:22:42] solemn rest oh faith cannot be based
[1:22:46] upon the shifting sins of man's theology
[1:22:49] but faith takes its solemn stand upon
[1:22:51] the eternal
[1:22:52] everlasting rock of god's eternal faith
[1:22:56] and there it rests unmovable now i've
[1:22:59] often brought this in a fashion saints
[1:23:01] and i i don't ever want to be irreverent
[1:23:03] but you know i'm sure there's a lot of
[1:23:05] people out here that sing the song i
[1:23:07] shall not be moved but they don't sing
[1:23:09] it with the same thought that you and i
[1:23:10] do
[1:23:11] amen i believe this and you ain't moving
[1:23:13] me no matter what i don't care
[1:23:15] god comes and shakes it down and there's
[1:23:17] ample evidence that's what i'm
[1:23:20] i shall not be moved
[1:23:23] but look at this now a real believer
[1:23:26] comes upon the eternal everlasting rock
[1:23:28] of god's eternal faith
[1:23:30] their arrests unmovable it knows that
[1:23:34] god is
[1:23:35] and a rewarder of those that diligently
[1:23:38] seek him
[1:23:40] isn't that beautiful you know how
[1:23:41] diligently seeking him can be saints can
[1:23:44] i
[1:23:44] just not try to look down
[1:23:48] or whatever upon your intelligence and
[1:23:50] understanding
[1:23:52] right i'm not trying to look down on
[1:23:55] anyone
[1:23:56] but you know what diligently seeking him
[1:24:00] is
[1:24:03] seeking him in everything
[1:24:09] often time the diligence of seeking him
[1:24:14] can be something that people go
[1:24:17] you pray about that
[1:24:22] yes i do because i
[1:24:25] want to understand god's will
[1:24:29] for me amen i don't want god's will in
[1:24:32] just
[1:24:33] big things or god's will when i'm sick
[1:24:37] i want god's will in everything
[1:24:41] there's where the diligence of seeking
[1:24:44] him what is that
[1:24:45] absolutely brother david almost started
[1:24:47] preaching on it i'll tell you
[1:24:49] that's absolutely putting god first in
[1:24:52] everything
[1:24:53] and dying out to our own thoughts
[1:24:56] on everything
[1:25:00] boy that's hard isn't it come on let's
[1:25:02] be honest with one another that's hard
[1:25:06] we get ideas you know you know you get
[1:25:08] an idea on something and
[1:25:09] and you're like oh i want to buy one of
[1:25:11] these and you'll find yourself on
[1:25:12] craigslist
[1:25:13] you're looking for one of those you look
[1:25:14] for one of those every day and pretty
[1:25:16] soon you get the idea i don't think god
[1:25:18] wants me to have one of those
[1:25:20] now might be a multitude of reasons you
[1:25:22] think i can spend 250 dollars
[1:25:24] and there's not one on craigslist for
[1:25:26] less than 500. the devil's there what's
[1:25:28] another 250.
[1:25:33] and that could go into a whole whole
[1:25:35] thing
[1:25:36] jerry's over there laughing she's like
[1:25:37] hi you're preaching about yourself
[1:25:43] always yeah amen
[1:25:46] now look at this saints so as we come to
[1:25:49] this
[1:25:49] we'll see now that if we are have that
[1:25:52] kind of
[1:25:53] certainty we can come to this place
[1:25:57] with such a caution
[1:26:00] such a a a desire
[1:26:04] to look into the future we're looking
[1:26:07] there
[1:26:07] we're saying okay now what is this i
[1:26:10] want
[1:26:10] lord i want to do i want to make a
[1:26:13] decision today lord
[1:26:15] that actually blesses my family tomorrow
[1:26:20] i want to do today church
[1:26:25] when i speak to you i want to lay
[1:26:26] something that might be a benefit to you
[1:26:29] tomorrow or the next day or next week or
[1:26:31] next month
[1:26:33] see we can anybody can preach the
[1:26:35] flowery stuff
[1:26:37] and i don't say this in any kind of
[1:26:39] mockery or whatever but
[1:26:40] anyone can get up here and lay out the
[1:26:43] whole platform of god's center prophet
[1:26:45] and we can get excited about that i'm
[1:26:47] glad he sent him saints
[1:26:49] we i don't know what we'd be maybe we'd
[1:26:50] still be methodists
[1:26:54] but you see there's more to that we can
[1:26:57] get beyond it why did god send a prophet
[1:26:59] people are like oh god send a prophet
[1:27:01] all these people look what it's going to
[1:27:03] do but you know what when you really
[1:27:04] read malachi you'll realize sister kerry
[1:27:07] god sent a prophet just to you
[1:27:11] just to you just to you just to you
[1:27:14] see it wasn't that it's like oh he goes
[1:27:17] forget the whole world saints forget
[1:27:18] everybody else in the church
[1:27:20] behold i send you malachi 4.
[1:27:24] amen i send you elijah the prophet
[1:27:28] why because we had specific needs that
[1:27:30] had to be met
[1:27:31] and by the preaching of the word it
[1:27:34] isn't just a prophet's word to you
[1:27:36] but you find that it's the will of god
[1:27:39] being revealed
[1:27:40] this is actually a revelation that is
[1:27:43] coming out when you see the will of god
[1:27:46] for your life
[1:27:47] people like oh i never saw that
[1:27:49] scripture before but i'm telling you
[1:27:51] what's just equally exciting to me
[1:27:53] is when someone in the body of believers
[1:27:56] eyes is open
[1:27:57] and they actually one day realize what
[1:28:00] this whole thing
[1:28:01] is about it's not me coming and
[1:28:03] conforming and this and that
[1:28:05] this is god himself saying i am
[1:28:08] unrolling the red carpet
[1:28:09] from this point all the way into
[1:28:12] eternity
[1:28:13] for you and you realize that down in
[1:28:16] your soul
[1:28:17] that that's what god's doing he's making
[1:28:19] a way
[1:28:20] he said i will make the way smooth
[1:28:22] before you
[1:28:25] as the devil drives around throwing all
[1:28:27] the rocks out
[1:28:29] and we say man life is hard well i tell
[1:28:32] you what
[1:28:33] if god gave you a supernatural vision of
[1:28:35] what it was
[1:28:36] compared to what the devil has for you
[1:28:38] that's smooth
[1:28:40] amen and you know what the
[1:28:43] bane of christians are of christians is
[1:28:48] laziness that's the bane of christians
[1:28:52] we get lazy
[1:28:55] that's why god lets the wheels fall off
[1:28:57] your car
[1:29:01] so that you don't just get up oh lord
[1:29:03] bless our day thank you
[1:29:06] you actually stop and say lord we need
[1:29:09] you around here
[1:29:10] we need you lord you see that's his will
[1:29:13] if you want an example
[1:29:14] i don't preach it tonight in fact i want
[1:29:16] to stop uh but you just go look what
[1:29:18] brother branham
[1:29:19] just go look read job and then go look
[1:29:22] at what brother brown
[1:29:23] says about job you'll see that
[1:29:26] job was a perfect man in the eyes of god
[1:29:30] but god was going to prove himself
[1:29:33] amen okay
[1:29:38] let's let's hurry up hurry on here real
[1:29:41] quick
[1:29:43] and uh first corinthians 1 and 18.
[1:29:46] now we're going to look here at what
[1:29:48] this wisdom
[1:29:49] and prudence and uh foolishness
[1:29:53] all right here in this few scriptures
[1:29:56] is very condensed down it's just
[1:29:58] beautiful
[1:30:00] for the preaching of the cross is to
[1:30:01] them that perish foolishness
[1:30:04] so we have a whole class of people that
[1:30:06] this is all foolishness to
[1:30:09] i was talking to a gentleman a few days
[1:30:11] ago and he was like well what kind of
[1:30:12] church do you have
[1:30:13] and i thought might as well just get
[1:30:15] this conversation over with
[1:30:17] we are holiness oh
[1:30:25] then paul just acts like he doesn't have
[1:30:26] a clue he just comes stumbling right
[1:30:29] along
[1:30:30] well you know holiness is all through
[1:30:33] the bible
[1:30:34] in fact god even described himself
[1:30:37] in holiness uh yeah okay
[1:30:41] uh look saints know you speaking around
[1:30:45] the bush
[1:30:46] there are some people that the preaching
[1:30:48] of the cross is holding us part of the
[1:30:50] preaching of the cross
[1:30:52] amen we serve a righteous god a holy god
[1:30:55] amen so to the preaching of the cross
[1:30:58] it's to them that perish foolishness
[1:31:00] but unto us which are saved it is the
[1:31:02] power of god
[1:31:04] oh i tell you what we're probably going
[1:31:06] to have to preach on high heels here in
[1:31:08] the church
[1:31:08] seems like we've had an invasion now i
[1:31:11] don't know if we compare them to
[1:31:12] grasshoppers or mormon crickets or
[1:31:15] mosquitoes but you know it just seems
[1:31:17] like they get in the room and they just
[1:31:19] spread out
[1:31:19] my brother and sister i'm not against
[1:31:21] anybody i love everybody that comes this
[1:31:23] church
[1:31:23] but are we are we a message church
[1:31:29] now you don't have to but i'm just going
[1:31:32] to tell you
[1:31:32] if you want to go spend some time just
[1:31:35] go study what the prophet of god said
[1:31:36] about high heels
[1:31:38] and if i don't want to scar your eyes i
[1:31:40] could give you a demonstration
[1:31:45] come on the prophet of god said mincing
[1:31:49] you know what that means i won't follow
[1:31:51] it through
[1:31:52] so i scar you but mincing
[1:31:55] is the action and movement
[1:32:00] of the body
[1:32:03] meant to entice
[1:32:07] that's exactly right now some people
[1:32:11] will be upset you know the preachers
[1:32:13] preach it on
[1:32:13] on clothesline religion or something
[1:32:15] like that is it
[1:32:17] clothesline or is it the gospel
[1:32:22] we can call it clothesline and then
[1:32:24] think it's petty or whatever or
[1:32:26] we can preach the gospel now i know it's
[1:32:29] only half the church here tonight but
[1:32:31] i mean do you want brother branham you
[1:32:34] know
[1:32:34] says i'm deviating i'm sorry but brother
[1:32:36] brown says you know
[1:32:37] that the problem we have is
[1:32:41] weak pulpit
[1:32:46] praise the lord if all those people quit
[1:32:47] because they don't want to hear it means
[1:32:49] you guys will just have to pay twice as
[1:32:50] much but no problem
[1:32:56] no that's the problem do you get what
[1:32:58] i'm being facetious about
[1:33:00] people are worried about who's going to
[1:33:01] pay the bills
[1:33:03] more than they are about who's going to
[1:33:05] make the rapture
[1:33:07] let's get this in its right proportion
[1:33:08] god will take care of the bills
[1:33:11] we want to be ready for the rapture
[1:33:15] for his written i will destroy the
[1:33:17] wisdom of the wise and i will bring to
[1:33:19] nothing the understanding of the prudent
[1:33:21] so now we have this group of people
[1:33:24] saints this is why i brought that little
[1:33:25] disclaimer to you
[1:33:26] we have a group of people that are
[1:33:28] thinking for the future
[1:33:29] and they might be right in the church
[1:33:32] they're like well now the church is
[1:33:34] growing we've got a program we're going
[1:33:35] to have to build
[1:33:36] a wing here we're going to have to sell
[1:33:37] it buy more property we need a building
[1:33:39] fund we need to do this we need to make
[1:33:40] these investments and we want to make
[1:33:42] sure that we have a group
[1:33:44] outreach for this and for this and for
[1:33:46] this and for this
[1:33:48] you know what i i find out saints now
[1:33:50] sorry i'm kind of deviating
[1:33:52] but you know people approach me actually
[1:33:54] quite regular you'd be a little bit
[1:33:55] surprised how
[1:33:56] regular people call me and they say hey
[1:33:59] we're this group and we're this
[1:34:01] or sometimes it's just almost like a
[1:34:02] social type thing
[1:34:04] and we would like to use your church
[1:34:08] we're this little group and we'd like to
[1:34:10] rent your church we noticed you don't
[1:34:11] have sunday evening service and
[1:34:13] we'd like to rent your church on sunday
[1:34:15] evening or have it on
[1:34:16] thursday evening or tuesday evening and
[1:34:19] you know saints when you think about it
[1:34:20] some of them are like
[1:34:21] we're willing to pay you like 350 450
[1:34:25] 550 some of them were like we'll give
[1:34:27] you 250 a week that's a thousand bucks a
[1:34:30] month
[1:34:32] but you know what a thousand bucks a
[1:34:33] month is worth when you walk into your
[1:34:35] own church
[1:34:36] and you have to start fighting your way
[1:34:39] through these spirits
[1:34:40] to try to get some liberty inside your
[1:34:44] own church
[1:34:48] hallelujah
[1:34:51] so i will bring to nothing the
[1:34:53] understanding of the prudence so we have
[1:34:54] prudent now the definition doesn't
[1:34:56] change
[1:34:57] but the atmosphere or the spirit on the
[1:34:59] individual that we're talking about
[1:35:01] being prudent
[1:35:02] so we're going to have those people out
[1:35:04] here in laodicea
[1:35:05] that are prudent you'll meet them and
[1:35:07] they are they're the ones that have a
[1:35:09] balanced budget have no
[1:35:10] debt they have this they have that they
[1:35:12] got plans for the future
[1:35:13] and everything's all laid out all's well
[1:35:16] and then you will find those that
[1:35:18] are sons and daughters of god who are
[1:35:20] also
[1:35:22] living by you might say budgets and this
[1:35:24] and that not above their means and
[1:35:25] whatever
[1:35:26] but there's something different because
[1:35:28] one has found favor in the eyes of god
[1:35:30] one has found favor in wisdom of this
[1:35:33] world
[1:35:35] and an attribute of that wisdom
[1:35:38] well i'll tell you what it works a lot
[1:35:40] we read the scripture already amen
[1:35:42] those of those of god find favor with
[1:35:45] god
[1:35:46] see you can look at this now when you go
[1:35:48] home and you study this look at this
[1:35:50] from natural and spiritual
[1:35:52] and you will see the type is almost to
[1:35:54] me glaring it's just bold it's just
[1:35:57] there because you can find people i
[1:35:58] could introduce you tonight
[1:36:00] probably they'd answer the phone and i
[1:36:02] could take your house tonight people
[1:36:03] that have
[1:36:04] just done they just do everything just
[1:36:06] right
[1:36:07] but they have no desire to serve god so
[1:36:10] being prudent does not them
[1:36:12] any good in the eternal realm
[1:36:18] where is the wise where is the scribe
[1:36:21] where is the disputer of this world
[1:36:24] hath not god made foolish the wisdom of
[1:36:26] this world
[1:36:27] now if we don't think so saints you can
[1:36:29] just go on your computer i don't know
[1:36:31] how maybe you want to find news or even
[1:36:33] if you dare to find news anymore
[1:36:35] but when you look out here now i i find
[1:36:38] this and i'm not making fun of the man
[1:36:39] because i believe it's the spirit of the
[1:36:41] day and god's going to manifest that has
[1:36:42] to bring it back
[1:36:43] but i heard today just listen to the
[1:36:45] radio for a few minutes when i was
[1:36:47] doing and and they had these clips and
[1:36:50] here's the government their spokesman
[1:36:51] saying
[1:36:52] oh no if you're vaccinated you don't
[1:36:54] need to wear a mask anywhere
[1:36:55] in the very next clip they're like if
[1:36:57] you're vaccinated you still need to wear
[1:36:59] two mouths
[1:37:00] and then the next clip is if you are
[1:37:02] indoors with your
[1:37:03] own family you don't need to wear a
[1:37:04] mouse the very next clip is says
[1:37:06] well probably to be safe if your
[1:37:08] children are you know blah blah
[1:37:09] you probably should even wear the mask
[1:37:11] inside of your house and if you go in
[1:37:13] public you should do this and this oh no
[1:37:15] you don't need to do this you can do
[1:37:16] that you can do this over here no don't
[1:37:18] do that do it this way do it that way do
[1:37:19] it this way over here
[1:37:20] you need to get vaccinated you know
[1:37:22] we're thinking about making it so you
[1:37:23] can vaccinate it a third time now
[1:37:32] foolishness foolishness
[1:37:36] now we would argue about it amen those
[1:37:39] are personal choices
[1:37:42] but you see my brother and sister my
[1:37:44] point is not about the vaccine itself
[1:37:47] my point is they're out here all over
[1:37:50] the table
[1:37:51] all over they have no clear answer
[1:37:55] because they're trusting to something
[1:37:59] that is foolishness in the eyes of god
[1:38:01] amen
[1:38:02] brother branham said they broke into
[1:38:04] god's laboratory
[1:38:05] amen they run amok inside that
[1:38:08] laboratory
[1:38:10] amen
[1:38:15] so what did god do he comes along
[1:38:19] and says you know what i'm going to do
[1:38:20] i'm going to do by the foolishness of
[1:38:22] preaching
[1:38:22] and let me tell you saints there's many
[1:38:25] a time i walk out of this church get in
[1:38:26] the car start driving home
[1:38:28] thinking paul you are so foolish
[1:38:32] you said what you used what for an
[1:38:34] example
[1:38:36] you oh my oh my
[1:38:39] i'm resigning i'm done i'm finished i
[1:38:42] can't face the people again
[1:38:46] now i say this in jest but when your
[1:38:48] wife ingest gets in the car and is
[1:38:50] driving home and she says
[1:38:52] now what was that word you said
[1:38:56] and i'm like i have no idea she said
[1:38:58] well you repeated it two or three times
[1:39:02] you know you talk about feeling foolish
[1:39:06] but now saints i'm going to approach you
[1:39:07] a different fashion here don't get
[1:39:10] distracted
[1:39:12] is god not present in our church is god
[1:39:15] not present in our lives
[1:39:17] is god not moving changing
[1:39:20] building us up it's not the men
[1:39:23] here it's the power of god
[1:39:27] but he says i'm going to use the
[1:39:29] foolishness
[1:39:30] of preaching to bring it down and make
[1:39:33] it real to you
[1:39:34] and i and all we can say is lord
[1:39:40] you know you know lord amen
[1:39:43] amen because you see what he's done now
[1:39:46] is he's causing these people that are
[1:39:50] in this realm that they they look at
[1:39:53] everything and it doesn't
[1:39:54] fit they say well where is this and
[1:39:56] where is that
[1:39:57] and but you see god's making slow but
[1:40:00] sure
[1:40:00] the wisdom of this world foolish
[1:40:04] and the wisdom of god in verse 21 for
[1:40:06] after that in the wisdom of god the
[1:40:08] world by wisdom knew not
[1:40:10] god and it pleased god by the
[1:40:12] foolishness of preaching to save them
[1:40:14] that believe
[1:40:15] for the jews require a sign the greeks
[1:40:17] seek after wisdom
[1:40:18] but we preach christ crucified see now i
[1:40:22] want to just lay this out real quick and
[1:40:23] sum this up
[1:40:24] close here but look at this my brother
[1:40:26] and sister we preach
[1:40:28] christ crucified
[1:40:31] but every one of you as sons and
[1:40:33] daughters of god takes the word
[1:40:36] and prudently applies it
[1:40:39] to your life it's not foolishness
[1:40:43] you look at this now i'm just very
[1:40:45] shallow as it were examples
[1:40:48] we realize my days go better
[1:40:51] when i pray my days go better when i
[1:40:54] read my bible
[1:40:56] my days go better when i stop
[1:41:00] and i want to say and i say god help us
[1:41:04] amen your days go better amen
[1:41:08] because we're prudently applying
[1:41:12] the word i mean
[1:41:16] maybe i could use titus for an example
[1:41:18] or something you know
[1:41:19] it'd be almost easier just to walk up to
[1:41:22] your kid
[1:41:28] but is that what's prudent no sir
[1:41:32] but i tell you what i've seen this saint
[1:41:35] because it worked on you
[1:41:39] you want people to change they say where
[1:41:41] are you going brother paul i'm just
[1:41:42] telling you the message as the prophet
[1:41:43] taught us
[1:41:46] you want to see people change what do
[1:41:49] you do
[1:41:51] you pray for them the prudent thing to
[1:41:54] do
[1:41:55] sorry sister nadia it's one of those
[1:41:57] risks of sitting close to the front
[1:42:00] you don't come put your finger in their
[1:42:02] face
[1:42:03] and tell them what a bad person they are
[1:42:07] what you do and i'm not implying this to
[1:42:10] sister nadia
[1:42:12] what you do is you start praying amen
[1:42:15] and the more that you lift them to the
[1:42:17] throne of god
[1:42:19] the more you are changed and the more
[1:42:22] they
[1:42:22] are changed and suddenly we all feel
[1:42:25] like god's moving in our midst
[1:42:28] because we have to prudently apply the
[1:42:30] word
[1:42:31] in other words we would just supply
[1:42:34] pitchforks
[1:42:36] in the back of the church and i would
[1:42:40] pitch it off here to brother trevor and
[1:42:42] sister carrie
[1:42:44] and brother trevor and sister kerry are
[1:42:47] you both right-handed
[1:42:50] yeah okay wendy is going to have to
[1:42:52] convert
[1:42:54] because otherwise if it's right-handed
[1:42:56] you guys would be all going like this
[1:42:58] so i guess it would be coming to sister
[1:43:01] nadia and sister gabriella
[1:43:03] are you guys right-handed no
[1:43:06] gabriella i knew was left-handed maybe
[1:43:10] we will get it spread around
[1:43:14] but you see saints what do we do we
[1:43:16] prudently apply it
[1:43:18] do you know if someone offends you what
[1:43:20] the scripture says to do
[1:43:24] write a
[1:43:36] you blog me oh thank you lord
[1:43:42] oh you're dwelling
[1:43:45] inside me holy spirit
[1:43:57] hallelujah and what it produces is we've
[1:43:59] come a new creation
[1:44:01] hallelujah let's sing that little song

[1:44:04] i'm a brand new man isn't that awesome
[1:44:08] hallelujah i like the idea of being a
[1:44:10] brand new man
[1:44:12] hallelujah that old man i'll tell you
[1:44:14] what the devil's got a big old notebook
[1:44:16] full of notes
[1:44:17] and he's got a name wrote on there but
[1:44:19] i'll tell you what the devil's fool
[1:44:21] i'll tell you how he's fooled because
[1:44:22] he's got a notebook that says paul
[1:44:24] haylett on it
[1:44:26] seems like he's identified me right paul
[1:44:29] haylett
[1:44:30] did this did this did this did this did
[1:44:32] this but you know what happened
[1:44:34] the word come i went through a
[1:44:37] adoption series i come out the other
[1:44:40] side

[1:44:45] mrs jesus christ and when he goes
[1:44:48] flipping over to the book of moses jesus
[1:44:50] christ
[1:44:52] he can't find nothing
[1:44:55] now if i go through the rest of my life
[1:44:57] still being the paul haylett
[1:44:59] the devil still got a list to keep but
[1:45:02] when we step over saints
[1:45:04] are you with me we step over in that new
[1:45:06] birth in that new creation
[1:45:08] we're identified entirely different god
[1:45:11] doesn't look down on you and say oh
[1:45:12] that's that little rascally
[1:45:14] no good bum no he says that one's gone
[1:45:18] that's gone i've taken this one through
[1:45:20] the blood
[1:45:21] through the new amen through the new
[1:45:24] covenant

[1:45:40] introduced into the bloodline

[1:45:45] other side

[1:45:50] wow hallelujah

[1:50:10] road sister thoma in the ukraine
[1:50:13] many things happening saints for the
[1:50:15] sergey
[1:50:16] traveling i i don't know we'd have to
[1:50:18] ask sister yulia but
[1:50:20] i know that the little communication i
[1:50:23] had with brother sergey
[1:50:25] this is not just a nice little trip
[1:50:28] he rode from i can't even pronounce it
[1:50:31] probably correct
[1:50:33] kiev down to the nest
[1:50:37] stuffed in a van full of people you know
[1:50:40] not no first class train ride or bus
[1:50:43] ride or
[1:50:44] private car but stuffed in a man with a
[1:50:47] bunch of people
[1:50:48] things to take care of decisions to make
[1:50:52] let's just remember them in prayer amen
[1:50:54] remember one another look around if you
[1:50:56] would please just remember one another
[1:50:58] in prayer
[1:50:59] we need one another brother and sister
[1:51:01] you know i shared this i think that
[1:51:02] might have been a little text sister
[1:51:04] kerry sent me
[1:51:05] but i kind of wonder saints not trying
[1:51:07] to make a doctrine but i kind of wonder
[1:51:09] if this
[1:51:13] standard that god's raising up as
[1:51:16] satan's come pouring in right
[1:51:18] now see if we're not careful we get this
[1:51:20] idea that here comes the flood
[1:51:21] and suddenly in the last minute we
[1:51:23] struggle we got something to stop the
[1:51:25] flood
[1:51:26] no i'm sorry god's got it all ready set
[1:51:28] in place
[1:51:29] now i want to just put something out to
[1:51:31] you don't make doctrine out of this
[1:51:32] please don't twist it but i
[1:51:33] just wonder if part of that standard
[1:51:36] isn't you praying for me and me praying
[1:51:38] for you
[1:51:40] all of us right here saying i care
[1:51:42] enough i
[1:51:43] love them enough i'll lift them up in
[1:51:45] prayer and we're over here struggling
[1:51:48] it feels like oh something's happened
[1:51:50] you know and this is wrong and that's
[1:51:51] wrong and oh lord why and what
[1:51:54] and somebody's over here praying and
[1:51:57] that
[1:51:58] standard is somehow buttressing
[1:52:02] us
[1:52:06] i believe i just believe that's part of
[1:52:08] it
[1:52:10] but god said i'll place people in your
[1:52:11] life
[1:52:13] that will lift you up and in your time
[1:52:16] of need their prayers will be right
[1:52:18] there
[1:52:20] that's what you call unity in the body
[1:52:23] god bless you saints we love you and the
[1:52:25] lord just pray
[1:52:27] have a lovely rest of the week come
