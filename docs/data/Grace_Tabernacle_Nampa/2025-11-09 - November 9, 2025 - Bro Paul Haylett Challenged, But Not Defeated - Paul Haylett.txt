[music] Amen. It is mine. Praise God. Amen. I want to read something to you real quick. read [music] it the other morning and thought this was pretty good. Um, Proverbs 12:25 [music] says, "Heavenness in the heart of a man maketh it stoop, but a good word [music] maketh it glad." Right? Okay. Keep that in mind. Modern research says that hearing a kind word releases dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin, [music] the same neurochemicals and depressants try to mimic. God wasn't saying be nice. He's [music] saying chemically recalibrate each other with speech. You could literally talk someone off a ledge with a well-timed compliment and we waste [music] that power on sarcasm and memes. Let's turn around, shake one another's hand, and say the best thing you can say to him. [music] God bless you. Amen. Hallelujah. [music] Make sure we're all calibrated this morning. [music] God bless you. Amen. [music] Number 649 at the cross. Oh, and did my [music and singing] Savior bleed? And did my sovereign [music and singing] die? Could he devote that [music] sacred [singing] head for such a worm as I at [music and singing] the cross at the cross where I first saw the light and the burdens of [music and singing] my heart rolled away. It was there by [music] faith I received my sight [singing] and now I am happy all the day. Was [music and singing] it for crimes that I have done? He groaned upon the tree. Amazing [music] pity, [singing] grace unknown, and love beyond [music] degree. At the cross, at [music] the cross where I first saw [singing] the light and the burdens [music] of my heart rolled away. It was [music and singing] there by faith I received my sight and now I [music and singing] am happy all the day. Well [music] might the sun in [singing] darkness high [music] and shut his glories in. [music] And Christ the mighty maker [music] died for man [singing] the creature sin. At the cross [music and singing] at the cross where I first saw the light and the burdens [singing and music] of my heart roll away. It [music] was there by faith I received my [music] sight. And now I am happy [singing] all the day. The drops of grief can [music and singing] never repay. The debt of love [music] I owe. Near [singing] Lord, I give [music] myself away is all that [singing] I [music] can do. At the cross, at [singing and music] the cross where I first saw the light and [singing and music] the burden of my heart rolled away. It [music] was there by faith. I received my sight. And now I am happy [music and singing] all the day. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Forgot to tell you that was part of an article I read. It was about um you know people trying to disprove Christianity in the Bible and such. And um he gave several examples and that was just one of them of how [music] we've already been given this instruction. We've already been given these things and all it [music] does is prove it further. He created the science. He knows it. Hallelujah. Amen. I love it. I love it. Amen. [music] Amen. As we get ready to go to uh prayer this morning, I'd like to sing that little chorus. I keep falling in love with him [music] and I can't even read my own number. I think it's 355. Let's just stand. Sing [music] this to him this morning. Amen. You love him. Hallelujah. I keep [music] falling in [singing] love with him over and over [music] and over and [singing] over again. Keep [music] falling in love with him over and [singing] over and over and over again. [music] He gets sweeter and sweeter as the [singing] days go by. Oh, what a love between my [music] Lord [singing] and I. I keep falling in love with him over and [singing and music] over and over and over again. [music] Keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over [music and singing] again. I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and [singing and music] over again. He gets sweeter and sweeter as the days [music] go by. Oh, what a love between my Lord [singing] and I. I keep [music] falling in love with him over and [singing] over and over and over again. Let's just say I keep falling [music] in love with you, Lord. I keep falling [singing] in love [music] with you over and over and over and [music and singing] over again. I keep falling [singing] in love with you over and over [music] and over and over again. You [singing] get sweeter and sweeter as the [music] days go by. Oh, what a [singing] love between my Lord and I. keep falling [singing and music] in love with you over and over and over and over again. [singing] Amen. [music] Amen. Truly does get sweeter as the days go by. Amen. Amen. We [music] have a number of requests this morning. I'd like to start by Logan. [music] Is it your 18th birthday today? God bless you.

They're at his church, uh, there in Ferndale, Washington. [music] Amen. Lord, just be with them. Give them a wonderful time around his word. Amen. Amen. Let's just bow our heads [music] this morning. Gracious heavenly Jesus, Lord, how we love you. Lord, we give you thanks, Lord Jesus. Lord, we [music] thank you for this opportunity to come together, Lord Jesus, just to come together as saints of light, precious faith, Lord Jesus, and [music] lift our voices, the breath that you've given us in our in our bodies, Lord Jesus, to use it to worship you, Lord God, to lift our hands, Lord Jesus, to [music] praise your holy name. How we love you, Lord Jesus. We thank you [music] for thank you for the life that you've given us. Thank you that we were able to get out of bed this morning, [music] Lord God. And just that we were given the opportunity to come here, Lord. There's many places where they can't do that, Lord. And [music] we thank you for these freedoms, Lord Jesus. We thank you for your presence in our lives, Lord God. We thank you for your grace, your mercy, and your love, Lord Jesus. And Lord, as we've mentioned each one of these requests this morning, [music] the different ones, the ones that aren't here, the the ones that need healing in their body, the the ones that are may may be tuned in through streaming or whatever it might be, Lord Jesus, but just [music] the different ones, Lord God, the different brothers and sisters, Lord, that we think about often that we [music] love, Lord God. We pray for them this morning. May you encourage them. May you be with them as they weren't here to shake hands and say God bless you. I say out to each one of them, God bless you this morning. We love you and we appreciate you and we think of you in [music] our prayers. So Lord Jesus, we just take this time, the songs and the worship, Lord God, and Lord, the speaking [music] of your word this morning, Lord, I pray you just speak to our hearts, each and everyone, every situation. If there would [music] be an uplifted hand this morning, Lord God, a a need, a sickness, a deliverance, uh just something someone's meditating on, Lord God, whatever it might be seeking you for, Lord Jesus, I pray you [music] you speak to that need, Lord God. We love you, Lord Jesus. We're depending on you for [music] all things, Lord God. We welcome you here, Lord Jesus. Just pray that you would be found in our songs and worship this morning and the speaking of your [music] word. Mage one, Lord, just leave here closer to you than when we came this morning, Lord Jesus. And so, Lord [music] God, we dedicate this time and the service into your hands. We ask that you would just have your will in your way. We love you. [music] We give you thanks and ask these things in Jesus Christ's name. Name above all names. Amen. Amen. [music] You may have your seats. We have a uh we have a special this morning. and her sister Melody [music] if you'd &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Seems I have a million [singing] things to do. Everything it's [singing and music] placed in front of you. But Lord, [singing] it's not my desire to [music] see it go that way. So [singing] I rearrange priorities seeking [music and singing] for your will down on my knees. Giving you [singing] the first place [music] knowing [singing] it's your strength I can't replace. You are [singing] the center, the center of [singing] my life. You're the reason why I can live [singing] more abundantly. Let there [singing and music] be nothing, nothing placed [music] before you so I [singing] can see you in [music] plain view. I want to [singing] do everything through Christ. the [singing and music] center the center of my life. [music] Whenever I begin my [singing] day with prayer, you have never failed to meet me there. And all the [singing] other things of life just seem to work out. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Seem to work out right. &gt;&gt; My eyes are fixed [singing] on you and you alone. Lord, please [music and singing] come and rule upon this throne. know [singing] that in this life of mine I [music] can feel your [singing] presence all the time. Lord be the center, the center [singing] of my life. You're [singing] the reason why. You're the reason I can live [singing] more abundantly. Let [singing] there be nothing, nothing [singing] placed before you so I can see [singing] you in plain view. I want [singing] to do everything through Christ. &gt;&gt; The center, the [singing] center of my life. Lord, you're the [singing] center the center of my [singing] life. You're the reason [singing] why. You're the reason I can [singing] live more abundantly. Let [singing] there be nothing, nothing [singing] placed [music] before you so I can see you in plain [singing] view. I want to do everything [singing] through Christ.

You [singing] alone on [music] my heart desire and I long to worship thee. [music] You you alone [music] are my strength, my shield. To you [music and singing] alone does my spirit yield. [music] You are alone on [music and singing] my heart. Desire and I [music and singing] long to worship thee. You're my friend and you are my [music] brother. Even though you [singing] are a king. [music] I want you more than [music and singing] any any other so [music] much [singing] more than any. [music] You [singing] alone are my strength, my shield.

Can we just take a moment [music] just lift our hands and our hearts to the Lord and just give thanksgiving to him. How good he is to us. [music] Such a comforter, such a provider, a confidant. He brings peace to us in our times of trouble. He gives faith in our heart to believe the word of [music] God and then rewards us for believing. Oh, how thankful we are, Lord. How [snorts] we bless you, Lord [music] Jesus, today. Your grace and mercy. Oh Lord, you've poured it out in abundance upon us. [music] And Lord, we just lift our hands and our hearts today, Lord, to say thank you, Father, that Lord, you have chosen us. And Lord, how that you had called us, Father, [music] you made us part of your plan, Father. It was not an accident, but it was intentional. And we are here the recipients of the greatest gift ever given to mankind. We say thank you and bless your holy name today, Lord. Let us live lives that are worthy. Father, let our lives be a testament of you. Father, we ask [music] in your precious name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Don't really have any other notes. [music] Um, Sister Jerry and I will uh be leaving in a couple days uh to the Netherlands and Belgium. Uh, you might call it a working holiday. There'll be days for us just to enjoy uh some special meetings and to be speaking in meetings and uh so just desire your prayers. Amen. a quote. I should have printed it or included it, but I just read this morning and brother Brandham says that he says, "I know when I'm here, these people are praying for me and those over there are praying for me and these here are praying for me." And he says, "When I go forth, I can go forth in confidence knowing I'm surrounded by prayer." &gt;&gt; Amen. And I just thought it was so beautiful to to be able to walk through this life knowing that we have brothers and sisters, saints of like precious faith [snorts] that are praying for us. We're praying for you. Amen. That we can walk in that confidence that we are surrounded with prayer. And so [snorts] uh we appreciate that and look forward. Brother David will be ministering for you. Amen. Be praying for him. Amen. And so we just look for that. Uh with the chaos that's uh in the airports and whatever, uh [snorts] we're just believing the Lord will make everything work out just right and uh be able to go. I want to speak to you. Thank you so much. Enjoyed the music this morning, the special song. Amen. Uh just uh always enjoy those. Uh I want to speak to you this morning on challenged but not defeated. Amen. [snorts] And we would just go in our Bibles out of the book of Isaiah uh 41:es 9 and 10. And I just thought this was such a lovely scripture for uh it is there that we look in the word of God and we are continually reminded uh of what God thinks of us and how he is dealing with us and what he wants to to do for us. Amen. Amen. Do you do you believe that he is your provider today? Everything that we have need of. And understand this, we're not going to preach some kind of prosperity gospel, but the Lord actually sometimes just gives you things you des just desire, right? He says if you what you desire, you ask in my name and I'll give it to you. So sometimes even just in natural realm of life, he just gives us things that we desire. And and [snorts] I I thank the Lord for that. Amen. I don't I don't think that uh worldly fame or riches is the heart of a son or daughter of God. But I believe that as it is more of him is something that we just long for, desire from our hearts. Amen. Isaiah 41 9 and 10. Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant. I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away. Fear thou not, for I am with thee. Be not dismayed, for I am thy God. I will strengthen thee, yay, I will help thee, yay, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. Now one thing I would add to this scripture here we are in the Old Testament. Now we know saints that we are not servants. We are sons and daughters. Amen. But we can still take the very context of this scripture because we are servants that we're called to serve him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So even though we have another rightful position in the economy of God, we are here to serve him. And I say thank you Lord for this opportunity. Heavenly Father, we ask you just come in the service today Lord. It's just good to be in the house of God amongst saints of like precious faith Lord to have you come and speak to our hearts and Lord to correct us Lord and to give guidance to us Father [snorts] for we would be like children Lord and we would go astray thinking we're in the right way but we are being trained up. We have masters placed over us as children. [snorts] We have parents. We have leadership. And Lord, we're here today for the leadership of your Holy Spirit to move in our midst and give us guidance and direction. Father, we thank you for this opportunity to serve you. Lord, [snorts] we just ask you to bless each and every one those who are not here today. whatever circumstance might be, may your holy spirit just move down in their midst and Lord comfort and give peace and lord just help them in their journey. We ask these things from the depths of our heart, the desire of our heart in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated this morning. Now, as we would look into the word today, I would just like for us to to just kind of dig back. This is nothing real deep. These are things that we just know. These are things that that u we have heard ministered through the years. Amen. Should be there in the reservoir of knowledge that the Lord would give us the ability to have. Amen. We serve an omnisient God. Amen. an all- knowing God. And uh the beautiful thing about that is as we uh are here knowing that God knows all things, he knows your problems. Amen. He knows your good days from your bad days. He knows every struggle that we have ever faced. And when we come into that, sometimes Satan would come and he would try to tell you, "You're all alone. You're the only one that's got this problem. Nobody cares." But my brother and sister, we'll have to remember that we have to go back to the original word. And when we go back to the original word, we'll find that the original word was truth. Amen. That Satan's uh thoughts, his words were something that come along after the fact. Amen. And so all through the scripture, we see God choosing. Now, [snorts] some people would say we don't believe in predestination. Uh and their idea of predestination is God forcing, like God making you serve him. But we look at this and understand the real uh uh choice or whatever it is. Um I struggle for word right there. Uh that we see that God is doing the choosing. Amen. As it is, no man has come to God, but God has always called man and wooed man to him. So we get the idea that I come to a place I decided I was going to serve God. The only way you could serve him was that he called you. Amen. Without that calling, there's nothing. We see God choosing. Now, as it goes, my brother and sister, we see examples, to keep it brief, Cain and Abel. Amen. We see uh there that that how that God already knew what was going to happen. Already knew how that would be. He already had the word for Cain that uh if you would just do good. Amen. But you see, Cain had already made up his mind. He had already had something he believed was the way that he was going to go and that was the way that was right. And so we see Jacob and Esau and we see different examples through the scripture and we see God choosing and he chooses when he chooses where and he chooses who. And when we think about that it takes a lot of the things out of our life that we might have question marks about. we we would see that uh you know we feel like that uh I come to a certain stage of my life and it just seems like I had no options. Well my brother and sister God knew now pardon me for saying it so bluntly but some of us are just a little more stubborn uh determined no stubborn [snorts] uh than others. Amen. And God knew exactly what it would take to catch our attention. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's there at that time that that God says, "You've went far enough down this journey, down this road, the the wrong road." I've I've shared with you, my brothers and sisters, about Artisia, New Mexico, and you come into town from the north and there's a weird multi-road intersection there. And the two roads that are directly in front of you, when someone says, "Come to the intersection and go straight," there's no such thing as straight in that intersection. you come and you go slightly to the right or slightly to the left and it doesn't seem like much at that point where they intersect, but you travel a few miles down the road and you are miles and miles apart from each other. And so it was there obviously Paul chose the wrong straight and uh drove for miles and had to uh manage to turn around and go back. But you see, God is here and he'll let us go down that other road for a distance and [snorts] and but he'll always correct us. We're sons and daughters of God today, right? Can we say amen this morning? We are sons and daughters of God. We're not here. That's non-negotiable, Satan. This is not something you can convince us differently. We are sons and daughters of God. We'll walk the wrong road for a ways, but he has promised, "I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake you." He always will turn us around and bring us back to the place he wants us to be. And so it's there that we'll look at this and in the when, where, and who. Now look at what the when is now my brother and sister. It's been preached to us. It's one of my topics I really like to touch on every once in a while. And here we go again. Amen. When were we in Christ? &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world. Now, I want to put this out to you so that you can grasp this correctly. When we'll look at it, seeing it correctly, you were chosen in Jesus Christ before Lucifer even existed. &gt;&gt; I want you to ponder that &gt;&gt; the one who's trying to convince you, follow me, didn't even exist when God chose you. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You talk about a a real blessing. Amen. It's there even before creation. Before the foundation of the world, before creation, you were in Jesus Christ. Amen. So there it was. You were in thought form, not in a physical form, but in thought form. Amen. So as we'll look at this, we can come into Ephesians 1 [snorts] and 4. Amen. It says here, according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. You go back through that and you'll find it anchors back before the creation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. Amen. So he chose us in him, but he also chose us to be holy and without blame. So it was his choice that he would view us as holy. It was his choice to view us as without blame. So sometimes when the devil's kind of beating on you, and I know he probably doesn't bother you guys very much. Amen. Probably has other places to go and other things to do. But to those that he persed that he has not been the original thought, never will be the original thought. You were one of the original thoughts of God. Amen. Lucifer was a thought that came after you were in God's mind. Amen. So it's there. He has predestinated us. Now this is not forced us having forced us into adoption. No, he did not force us into adoption. Amen. He called us and we responded into adoption. Amen. and the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will through the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted. Can we say the word accepted this morning? Accepted. Amen. Amen. Has made us accepted in the beloved. Now I want you to catch this because this will be the theme of our thought this morning. Amen. You're not working for acceptance. You're not trying to be accepted. You have already been accepted. &gt;&gt; Oh, who can lift a hand and say, "Thank you, Lord, that I'm already accepted in Jesus Christ." Amen. This is not a labor of works. This is not a labor, but it is of love. Amen. That we can come and say, "Thank you, Lord, that you saw that I would be accepted." &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we're right back to the where still takes us back to Ephesians. Amen. Where were we? &gt;&gt; In him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you are part of Jesus Christ. Period. It's not an addition. It's not added on. It's not something that's been an addendum to, but a part of the original word. Amen. According as he has chosen us in him. Amen. So, look at that. Now, look at the word us. It's really hard to find a definition for the word us because it goes into complicated English and etc etc and [snorts] uh but it is a plural word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Denoting plurality. So us is more than one. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's also an inclusive word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Could be used in the phrase of us and them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or just us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So very inclusive. So when we'll look at the scripture, we'll realize what God has said here in the word according as he has chosen us a very inclusive. And when something is inclusive, it's only you might say one short step to say that it is exclusive. &gt;&gt; Because if it's only us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then it's exclusive. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not that someone else can come and say I'm now part of the us. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; So when you look at that my brother and sister, here is the word of God defining that there is a group of people. Amen. And it's only that group of people that God is defining by this word. Amen. And I say, let's lift a hand and say thank you this morning, Lord, that you would include us before the foundation as a thought in you from the very beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is so beautiful. Amen. Oh, look at the time. You say, "Well, how long you been a Christian?" Oh, it's been 10 years, 20 years, 30 years. How long have you been a Christian? Eternity. &gt;&gt; Look at that. You've been in him from the beginning. There was actually when you were in Christ Jesus in the beginning, there was no beginning because he's eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so if you were in him in the beginning, that means you are an eternal creature. Amen. You might look at time and say, "Look, you know, my my time on earth, the years, they add up. I get to be old, elderly, etc., etc." Forget that mindset, my brother and sister. That's just a little journey that we spend here on this earth. But look at who we were. We always were in him and will always be in him. And he is eternal. You are an eternal being. This is a flicker. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, there's an old saying often defined uh concerning a man and a woman in a relationship of two hearts beating as one. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Now, I want you to look at this and think for a moment. All the way back through eternity, even when we were just in thought form, our heart was beating already in Christ. Amen. And I I'll reinforce this a little bit with a quote here just to to kind of give you an idea of the platform. But you look at this, my brother and sister. So, even though you didn't exist in this human form, your heart in the mind of God was beating. And he knows how many beats your heart will ever make. Amen. Kind of like the Chinese doctor. He says, "Exercise is a waste of time. Your heart only beats so many times and it is finished." &gt;&gt; Now think about that. Amen. But God knew and he has given everything that he thought we would need into our life for its duration. And one thing he knows that we need in our duration is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he poured the word into you and I [snorts] that it would be there sufficient for this journey that we have. Amen. So he spoke us out of his thoughts and into creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's there that it's not that when we were in his thoughts that we had to have a physical body all the way back in time. But God's thoughts are so complete, my brother and sister. He knew exactly. Now, I I'm going to go back. This is something that just has kind of been on my mind lately. Amen. This is why all of this nonsense that they have with biotechnology, you know, people say, "Uh, doctor, we want to have a little blue-eyed boy." And they now have the ability to cause that to come and they would carry that embryo and have a little blue-eyed boy. And they're doing all that. But you see what they're doing? They're trying to play God and be there in thestead of God. Amen. And all of this identity stuff that unfortunately many young person in this day, well, not even young. Amen. Humanity is struggling with their identities. You see, really what it's done is Satan is coming wedging himself in there to say God didn't know what he was doing when he made you. And so the truth of it is God knew exactly what he was doing when he made you and I. Whether we're tall or we're short, whether we have what eye color, hair color, whether we are, you might say, kind of big or kind of little or what our stature would be, none of that is a mistake, my brother and sister. Every humanity, every person in humanity that ever come to a conclusion that there was a mistake. Why can't I look like this? Why can't I be like that? my brother and sister realize that's Satan trying to insert him into God's plan and cause doubt and cause uh all kinds of anxieties. And that's why I I really strongly speak this to young people. Amen. Is that when God made you like you are, you are beautiful in God's sight. And that is the only sight that really matters. Amen. Is that you recognize you are what you are by God's grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so the world today is got little 12, 10, 12 year old girls putting on the makeup, putting on all this stuff and they're trying to dress them up. The girls are trying to compete with each other. Boys are trying to compete with each other. My brother and sister, what it really is is the devil's trying to compete with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the real truth of it right there. He's trying to get in, trying to possess. Amen. So he spoke us out of his thoughts into creation. Now, I want you to understand this. When he spoke you out of his thoughts, he didn't speak you as chaff. &gt;&gt; No, that's right. &gt;&gt; He spoke you as gold. &gt;&gt; Amen. We see the scripture says that everything will be tried in the fire. Amen. Those things made out of chaff and straw will be consumed. Those things made out of gold will be purified. And that's what God's doing today, right now, through the word. He's purifying you and I. He's not going to burn us up and we be cast away. Amen. It's just ashes on the ground. But he's brought us as sons and daughters of God to let the word of God purify us in this hour. Amen. I tell you what, I can say thank you, Lord. We're not the people we used to be. God is changing us. He is He is baking out all the unbelief and all of the impurity. He's working it out of us. Amen. And we are coming, as the scripture says, as fine gold. Not just gold, my brother and sister. You can have a piece of gold that is just it can have all kinds of pyites and and all this other stuff in it and it's gold, but it's not pure gold. And it takes a refiner's fire. And somebody ought to say, "Thank you, Lord, for a refiner's fire." I don't want to [snorts] just say, "Look, I'm not chaff. I'm gold." But if we're not pure gold, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That means God's got to send us to a fire and he's got to bring out the impurity. Now, let's just go right here into uh the sermon Abraham and his seed after him. I want [snorts] to touch on a couple things here. Now, I want you to remember. Now, some people get offended over this. I've had people get offended. I sat in church and basically was told, "I'm an unbeliever." Why did you Where did you get that thought? Where did that thought come from? Why did you not pick of those things? Look, let's look this morning. We have three choices this morning. You do. It's not my choice. It's not anybody else's choice. It's your choice to decide who you are. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Three classes of people in the world. Always has been and will be to the end. Now, let's say that together. Three classes of people. unbelievers make believers and believers. People get offended with that because somehow it's implied to them that they're not a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, who's going to imply to you you're not a believer? &gt;&gt; The one who created you before the foundation of the world spoke you into existence. Is he going to say you're an unbeliever? &gt;&gt; Is he going to tell you you're a makebeliever? No. By the very creative power of God, he made you as a believer. Amen. It's Satan that's come in there planting a seed. Amen. As the tears amongst the wheat, he's planted a seed. And if you grow up and there's a tear beside you and you don't bother to look for other wheat, you might actually grow up thinking you're a tear. Remember, it's all about atmosphere and environment. But if you'll look up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I can tell you from being a farmer &gt;&gt; that until the head comes forth, it's very hard to tell the difference between wheat and wild oats. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But sooner or later, the evidence has to come out. &gt;&gt; It doesn't come out at the feet. &gt;&gt; It doesn't come out at the legs. It doesn't come out at the torso, as it were. It comes out in the head &gt;&gt; and there it is in the end. It always comes out. Well, I know I followed the message for 40 years, but I just can't believe that &gt;&gt; it's coming out of the head. &gt;&gt; Amen. That means for 40 years they had an intellectual understanding of where they stood in the economy of God because God didn't bring people. He didn't create you, my brother and sister. And I hope this soaks into some of you's hearts. He didn't bring you this far to then come and say, "I guess I made a mistake and you're a tear after all." Everything from your roots, amen, through everything of your stock up through coming. And you being wheat will put forth a head that will be wheat. And in that head is a comprehension or understanding of the word of God. In other words, revelation that I always was. Hallelujah. I always was weak. Amen. It wasn't when I finally come to a head and produced a head that I became wheat. I always was wheat and I am now in a season to manifest this. &gt;&gt; The sun is shining on me. I've got moisture to grow in the water of the word. And now it is just proving what's always been in my heart. I am a seed of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Three classes of people. Now the class that was elected before the foundation of the world were called in Christ before the foundation of the world. How many knows that Christ was the lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world? I believe every one of us can lift our hand and say we know that. Well, how was he slain? In God's great program, he knowed he would he would project a son and that son would be the savior of his people. Is that right? So when God speaks a thing, &gt;&gt; it's already finished. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You can stop today and say, "I've got this little sin in my life. I've got this little struggle in my life. I've got this situation in my life." When God put it out there and spoke it, he said, "It's already finished." &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't stop here and look at what's wrong with you. I want you today, saints, to look at what is right with you. &gt;&gt; You're called of God. That right there gives you everything you need to come forth, and it will come to fruition. And in the end, you will prove who you are. &gt;&gt; Oh my, my brother and sister. You see, it's not he who starts the race, it's he who finishes the race. &gt;&gt; And we are finishers today by the grace of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you look at this. Do you have any challenges in your life? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Could we be honest this morning? You don't have to do it for my sake, but it might not hurt you to lift your hand and say, "I have challenges in my life. I have things I stumble and struggle with. I have things that I butt my head up against. Can't seem to get over." But I tell you, my brother and sister, God has said, "It's already finished. So quit laboring, quit struggling, quit worrying, quit getting bent out of shape. Amen. Relax and let God move in your life. Let God come and move you up over that hurdle. You can try to dig under it. You can try to crawl around it. You might try to climb over it your own self, but if you let go and let God, you will find that everything you need to get beyond that challenge will be taken care of. But let me warn you, &gt;&gt; there'll be another challenge just beyond that one. &gt;&gt; There's not a one and done gospel. &gt;&gt; There's something you will fight &gt;&gt; all the way to the finish. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Reminds me of a little deal I seen. It was a marathon. This individual wanted to win a marathon so bad along [snorts] the way they had stashed a little motor scooter and this marathon went out through the countryside and whatever and they got on their little scooter and they took a side road or two and passed everybody and ditched the scooter and come running across the finish line. Hardly broke a sweat. &gt;&gt; But the word says your sins will find you out. and somebody showed up and said, "You know, isn't it amazing the goods and bads right here is got as many demons contained in this little black case as there is on the face of the earth. But right here also is things and somebody comes to official." Sir, sir, is this your races jersey riding a motorcycle? Oh, look closer. You're not a winner, you're a cheater. They have almost the same amount of letters, but they don't mean the same thing. You see, my brother and sister, that's why God has called you and I. Now, this might seem like a kind of a paradoxical statement. But God didn't call you and I to try to teach our way to heaven. He called us to struggle, to run, to sweat. Amen. Spiritually have sore feet. Amen. spiritually have fatigued muscles, spiritually come to a place. Now look at all of Israel when they come face to face with uh Goliath, my brother and sister. They were there and and they were men if they had had enough faith could have went out and done exactly what David did. There were men in the multitude of the congregation of Israel that if they would have cried out to God and said, "God, this man is mocking you and we will not allow it. We are sons of God. you are our savior, our king, our lord, our god, and God would have anointed them. But you see, God had a plan for David down the road. He's got a plan for you down the road. Amen. And so what does he do? He doesn't anoint. This sounds really narrow. Sounds like I'm being very, very critical, but I don't mean it that way. He could anointed anyone outside in this city today, my brother and sister, to believe with faith like you do. But he chose you to go down and challenge the giant. He chose you to pick up the sword of the word and say, "You know what? You're not going to speak against my God like this. My Lord Jesus, my savior, you can't speak against him like that." And went down. But you see, anyone could. God honors faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, sometimes we get this idea, this just happens around the message. No, my brothers and sisters, there's healings taking places. There's deliverances taking place. All kinds of things happening out here that's not within our rank or our realm. But you see, God ultimately faith will take you so far that without predestination can lead you in a position that God will honor, but you won't be bride. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I want to be bride this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be his chosen. I want to sit there in his throne in the throne room. Amen. And be in his presence. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, so when you look at this, I want to go back to this sentence. So when God speaks a thing, comma there, little space, pause, it's already finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think we need to stop and remember that it's already finished. &gt;&gt; Now look what the impact should have on you and I. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When God said, "I've called you." &gt;&gt; That's it. from before the foundation of the world. We should say, "Lord, my flesh is causing me causing me problems, Lord, but what's inside of me is what matters." And that is already redeemed. &gt;&gt; That's already been sealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know if you guys are familiar with Brother Wes ordeal for many years. One, you might call it a signature song that our brother Wes sings, it's already done. Amen. My brother and sister, that song is a song actually that has more revelation in it than people want to acknowledge or do recognize. It's a testimony. It's already done. Amen. Amen. I I'm already sealed. My family's already sealed. Amen. We already have been called of Almighty God. God said it. It's finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a hope that we're looking to or WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO serve God. WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO BE A CHRISTIAN. WE ARE &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I got it. &gt;&gt; I mean this impact it should have on us. Just go through every promise of God as you read the Bible, you read the word there. Every promise of God, you should say, you know what? Uh I haven't seen the manifestation maybe, but it's already done. &gt;&gt; It's already done. &gt;&gt; I'm already healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm already sealed. The word promised me THE HOLY GHOST. I'VE GOT THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; Absolutely right. &gt;&gt; And Lord, bring this body to match my confession. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now look, I want to ask you a question. How can you be defeated when he the lamb &gt;&gt; said you are already victorious? &gt;&gt; Do you realize that when we say, "Oh, I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't live it. I can't. I can't. I can. You're calling your Lord and Savior Jesus Christ a liar. &gt;&gt; You're saying that his word was insufficient to bring you to the place to complete the work he already began in you. &gt;&gt; We got a simple promise. This work I have begun in you. I, not the preacher, not the church, not the denomination, but I will finish it. Denoting a very personal relationship coming down as it is. May maybe you've saw this. you know, it's been around for years, but a man running in a race, I don't know, maybe a marathon or what it was, but literally collapses just like the length of this room from the finish line. And the man [snorts] that was behind him, comes right up on him, goes past him just a little bit, stops, turns around, picks this man up, gets him over his shoulder, and walks him up to the finish line. and about one foot short of the finish line supports him and pushes him across the finish line. Look, God could finish this race as we know it without us. But he said, "I will NEVER LEAVE YOU. I WILL NEVER FORSAKE YOU. I'LL pick you up when YOU FALL, AND I WILL BRING YOU TO THE FINISH, AND I WILL BLESS YOU. I WON'T SAY, "LOOK, YOU WEAKLING." I WILL SAY, "THIS IS THE RACE I CALLED YOU TO FINISH." AND HERE YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; OH, I tell you, my brother and sister, Satan would try to convince us that if we couldn't be some kind of superch Christian, we must not be a Christian at all. But when the word says you're victorious, you're victorious. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he called you to walk, you'll walk. When he calls you to run, you'll be able to run. None of this I can't. That's the devil talking when it comes from your mouth or my mouth that I can't. That's not the word speaking. &gt;&gt; The word says, I can do all things through Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. We ought to stand upon that realizing he's already placed that in us. &gt;&gt; Now, look at First John 5 and 4. Let [snorts] me back up a little bit. These words just I didn't enlarge them, but they just leap off the page at me. How can we be defeated &gt;&gt; when he, the lamb, &gt;&gt; said we are victorious? &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; I don't know why these little thoughts keep coming in my mind, but it also reminds me of a video I seen many, many years ago. They were already tearing down the finish line of the Boston Marathon. And here come a man with a little group of people around him with blood squishing out of his tennis shoes. I hope that's not too [snorts] too inappropriate. And the men who were tearing down the finish line stopped and started resurrecting the finish line &gt;&gt; because they saw a man so determined to finish the race. &gt;&gt; And another man who had finished the race already. They said, "Sir, the people with the the medallions or whatever you would call it u uh of finishers of the race have already left." And a man who had already run the race come back, took his off and put it on them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my brother and sister, our Lord Jesus has already run this race. He finished it. [laughter] And he looked at you and I and said, "I am going to take off this robe of grace and I'm going to bring it back and I'm going to put it around your neck and tell you, you finished the race. YOU FINISHED IT WELL. YOU'VE DONE WHAT YOU WERE CALLED TO DO." AMEN. IT'S NOT ABOUT BOASTING, BUT it's about fulfilling. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; First John 5:4. &gt;&gt; For whatsoever is born of God &gt;&gt; overcometh the world. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So where's the decision here in this &gt;&gt; born? &gt;&gt; You have to decide whether you're born of God or not. &gt;&gt; And the devil will try to tell you you're not, but God will give you infallible proof that you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it won't be a guess. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It will be absolute infallible proof that you are born of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Overcometh the world. And this is the victory that overcometh the world. Real complicated here, saints. This been on my heart. This about faith. Preaching to you about faith here. This real complicated. It's your faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But remember, you can't produce your faith. It's the word in you that produces faith. So there won't there will be a false faith faith out here. There'll be a people that say, "Oh, we did we did we did when they did nothing, but God allowed them to come and they lay hands on the sick and they recover." What was God doing? Honoring faith. It's not that individual's faith. It's that faith that rose up in that sick person that God said it. I believe it. I'll be healed. &gt;&gt; So then people rise up and people say, "This is a great ministry. This is a great ministry. This is a great ministry. It's a great faith." Amen. &gt;&gt; And not to do with that man, &gt;&gt; my brother and sister. You see, even your faith, &gt;&gt; now let's dissect that for just a moment this morning. [snorts] &gt;&gt; What faith? &gt;&gt; God's faith in you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Has said, "I'm born of God." &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And you can't even say that Jesus is the Christ &gt;&gt; without the Holy Ghost. Oh, anyone can actually say those words. &gt;&gt; But as revelation that activates in your life, it takes a revelation. Amen. To be able to say Jesus is the Christ. &gt;&gt; And look what it is now. This faith that is in you of God is telling you you are born of God. And when you are absolutely convinced you are born of God, that means that every victory over every battle you will ever face has already been settled. &gt;&gt; He's never lost a single battle, &gt;&gt; man. You're of him. You're in him. You're a part of him. You're spoke of him. There's no way that God would let you a part of him be defeated. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Impossible. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. on. That ought to give us a little faith this morning. Impossible for us to be defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, you'll take some lumps. &gt;&gt; I think this morning we could all lift a hand and say, "We've taken lumps." &gt;&gt; We've struggled. We've looked at our own lives. [snorts] Now, I don't say this to be humorous, but I posted it on the church WhatsApp. Maybe you saw it, maybe you didn't. a little picture of a little man there at the Bible and he says, "I ah, how was those words?" Anyway, I I read the Bible and I found a few errors. In the bottom, it says in me. &gt;&gt; You see, my brother and sister, there's the real truth. If you read the Bible and don't find an error in you, you better go back and read it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. But as that is there, the Lord is taking that one away, taking that one away, taking that one away. And we look at this and we say, I had a brother been a uh it was testified to me. I never before I spoke at this church, I I never knew this brother. had a brother Millie told me, he says, "Uh, [snorts] yeah, you know, uh, I sometimes wonder if I even hear what the preacher is saying. You know, it just seems like nothing's changing in my life." And I was like, "Well, brother," he he wanted me to pray with him. And and we prayed and he said, "Thank you." and went on. The brother that was there leaned over, whispered my ear. It's a shame he can't see where he came from. See, [snorts] the devil had him so caught in a crux that it's like, I'm just making no progress. No, [snorts] he used to be angry at a temper, argued with everybody this way and that and this and that and that. And now he's changed. But Satan's got him fooled that he can't see the change. &gt;&gt; Well, my brother and sister, I don't think we should do that, but I tell you, I had a I had a family not all that long ago tell me, you know, we were we were just thinking back when we come started serving the Lord and the years have come and gone. Our kids are growing up and we didn't [snorts] really realize what the Lord had done for us. But one day we were kind of decluttering and we come across old photo albums and our kids are like, "Oh, oh, here we want to see these pictures." And they flipped over the first couple and they're like, "Oh, mom. Uh yeah, we won't look at these albums." You see that we forget &gt;&gt; where God brought us from. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. It might do us well to not forget &gt;&gt; where God brought us from. I don't know that from our worldly days we should have a photo album on the shelf so the whole world sees you &gt;&gt; exposed in your worldly attire. &gt;&gt; But maybe God help us we don't forget &gt;&gt; where we come from. &gt;&gt; Because you see we've been challenged. This leodia the word says it's the darkest age of all the ages. Amen. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Darkest age of all the ages. And you are challenged. I believe if it would all be on us, we'd lift a hand and say, "We are challenged." Amen. It might be music, might be clothes, it might be friendships, it might whatever be relationships, whatever it might be. We are challenged, my brother and sister. But the word has declared, "You will not be defeated." &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan cannot defeat you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Imagine us showing up in heaven with all the saints of the ages and us without a single scar from the battle. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to put this in worldly human thinking. They'd all be going back to our Lord Jesus saying, um, what was so special about them? They didn't have to fight. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; We're all going to stand there. Not as though we're boasting, but we're going to have the battle scars. &gt;&gt; Battle scars of Leodysa. Of times that unbelief attacked us. What is unbelief, my brother and sister? &gt;&gt; Sin. &gt;&gt; Sin. Unbelief. You can interchange them. I'm a sinner. There's unbelief in there. &gt;&gt; I'm unbeliever. Sin will be present. &gt;&gt; They go together. &gt;&gt; But look at this. What does God do? Did you come to church? Now it's happened. Did you come to church and then God just instantly took everything away from you? &gt;&gt; No, sir. You fought for every deliverance. You fought for every But when you catch the revelation that it's already done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It allows us to go forward with more &gt;&gt; confidence. &gt;&gt; Right? As the word says, if your heart condemns you not, then you have confidence in God. what God's wanting us to see today. It's already finished. We're still going to face the battle. We're still going to face the fight. But you got confidence going into this fight now. I will win this one just like God helped me win that battle. I will win this battle. And the next battle that comes, I will win that battle. Amen. And I'm not going to stop until I've reached the goal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are we okay this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 15:57 58. But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Can we just give a hand clap saying thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; You've gave us the victory today. &gt;&gt; Therefore, my beloved brethren, &gt;&gt; be ye waffling, &gt;&gt; blown every which way, wondering. &gt;&gt; No, that's not what the word says. Amen. I I [snorts] don't mean to make light of that, but you see, sometimes our very behavior says we don't really believe this verse. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Lord, help me. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, means you sisters also. Be ye steadfast, unmovable, kind of the same word, but covering every base. Amen. Always abounding in the work of the Lord. For as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord, &gt;&gt; my every time you prayed through and [snorts] then after that seemed like you slid right back where you was at. That prayer that prayed you through was not in vain. Amen. It is there. You can study history as the soldiers who fought on the island of Euima. Amen. the volcanic sand that was there and they had to climb the dunes from the beach being shot at and men dying all around them. And they all testify, you can go through history and they all testify you would take two steps forward and slide right back and you took two steps forward or three steps forward, you slid back one. And they knew though they had to keep going or they would die right there. And the those obviously that live said, "And we had no desire to die on this place, on this mount, on this island, in this sand, we were called to live." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So even in the battle of one step forward, slide back, two or three forward, slide back, you kept going. And that's the battle that we are facing in this loudian age. Amen. It'll feel like that we are not making progress. But I promise you because the word can't fail, you are making progress. Amen. You are building up faith and moving forward and you've determined, I'M NOT GOING TO DIE in this world. I'M NOT GOING TO DIE IN LEODYSIA. This is not my resting place. My resting place is in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, Satan will tell you though, it's all in vain. Now, as we would look, as I read to you earlier, the Apostle Paul had shared to us. Amen. First Corinthians, he's speaking to them. If we're not careful, I'll just say it. You meet a lot of people around the message say, "You know what? We've got revelation for this hour. God's come. He's vindicated this. They're all fodder and we are the ones that are important. They're just a bunch of sinners. We've got the Holy Ghost. And if we could find ourselves lifted up, &gt;&gt; y &gt;&gt; we could find ourselves looking down on the world. Look at the Sorry to be blunt, but we've dealt with them right here in this sanctuary. Women walking the streets. &gt;&gt; They need some food. They need a place to stay, sell their body. We look down on that. Oh, praise God. We're not like them. You look at the person, you see it every day. Saw one right here in town the other day. guy walking down the street, you know, he's either on the way up or he's on the way down cuz he's walking down the street just like, "Oh, glad I never was a junkie." Until you meet a brother, sister that was. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you can't tell the difference. &gt;&gt; But see, we could be lifted up. &gt;&gt; We could think, "Oh, how special we are. God called us. He didn't call them. Is this too harsh? &gt;&gt; Speak to message people. &gt;&gt; That we don't become heady and high-minded thinking that we're so special. Are you special? I say you are special, bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. But do we come to the place we think we're so special? &gt;&gt; See, we've seen the supernatural in our lives. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, I've seen so much supernatural in my my days on earth. Uh, it's just so incredible to see these things take place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've got to see the supernatural in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Between the lines, we see it start to open up and speak to us. [snorts] And wherever the word is, the supernatural is present. &gt;&gt; Got it? &gt;&gt; And I'm going to just put this real blunt. When you hear people say, "I went to church and there was nothing there. The preacher missed the mark today. The preacher didn't miss the mark. You did. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because just the reading of the word That's right. &gt;&gt; should have caused you to walk out and say, "It was good to be in the house of the Lord today." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not talking about a preacher preaching a bunch of nonsense. &gt;&gt; But if a preacher is doing his best, trying before the Lord and before the people to present the word of God, and people deride that, they look down on that. They say, "Well, that's not the perfect word. That's not pure. That's not this. That's not that." My brother and sister, the problem's not with that preacher. The problem is with the person that can't see that God promised to be in our midst. Is there two or three believers here this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me count your hands this morning. Is there two or three believers in this building this morning? Amen. So, that means that God promised he would be here with us this morning. &gt;&gt; I want to have my eyes open. I want to know. Let my heart be sensitive that I would know that he was here speaking to me this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And here we are today recipients. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Said here, I'm just going to paraphrase it. here at the end time, the mysteries of God should &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelations 10:7. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Should be fulfilled. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now, I've heard people interpret that, well, should meant it kind of could or couldn't, but that's not looking at it correctly. Amen. The word should is almost as a command. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It must be revealed. &gt;&gt; That's right. And so we look and we're sitting in the day that the mystery of the revelation of Jesus Christ has been revealed. &gt;&gt; Oh my. That ought to make our hearts happy. That ought to cause us to be able to say, "Thank you, Lord, that here we are in the end of time." My brother and sister, it's not just people around the message that's saying, "It's the end of time." You got people in every religion on the face of the earth saying, "It's the end of time." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The signs are here. They're in the heavens. are in the earth. They're in the oceans and earthquakes and tsunamis and everything that's there. Every sign says we're at the end of time. And it's in that case, that time right there, we should be thankful that the should has come to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Mystery been made known in this day. &gt;&gt; Now, look, as Paul's speaking to the Corinthians, I want to hurry right along here. I finally looked at the clock and it scared me. Amen. Now, look at this. Now 2 Corinthians 12 6-9 and uh Amen. Brother Isaac, will you pop that up there, please? For though, this is the Apostle Paul speaking now to the Corinthians. For though, let me prefrase this a little bit. I think you guys love me enough I you wouldn't crucify me. But in most cases, if a man in this day and age stood in front of a congregation of people and talked like the Apostle Paul is talking, man on the internet the other day was boasting how he got up and walked out of a church service. Another man commented and said, "I was in that same service. What offended you?" And the man was like, "Well, he said and this a little bit of the comment about believers, unbelievers, people." And and the guy's like, "Well, he said this." And he says, "Man, you just totally missed the mark." And the guy veheanimately argued back, "No, you're the one that missed the mark." &gt;&gt; You see, my brother and sister, they can't endure sound teaching. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And you could say, "Brother Paul, you you say that sounds arrogant." No, that's the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's that's what the scripture says. They won't endure sound teaching. &gt;&gt; For though I would desire to glory. Are you guys seeing a little different picture of the Apostle Paul than we sometimes have? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul's standing right in front of the people. Though I would desire, &gt;&gt; that means something down in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Would want to rise up and say, "Look what God gave me." Amen. &gt;&gt; Though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. There's a man that has went and he has struggled. He has fought. Amen. And God has given character to him. He said, "Though I would desire to do this, I shall not be a fool. For I will say the truth, but now I forebear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me." Don't go lifting me up. &gt;&gt; You saw the supernatural. Don't go lifting me up. &gt;&gt; I'm not a fool. Don't lift me up. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations. There was given to me a thorn in the Let's stop. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I want I want to break this down. Get too far ahead. &gt;&gt; Abundance of revelations. Apostle Paul saying I would feel like boasting. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it really all comes down to the abundance of revelation that's been given to me causes me to rise up and say, "Look, &gt;&gt; and God won't let him." &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it. &gt;&gt; And what happened &gt;&gt; to mold Paul's character so he would not boast of himself? &gt;&gt; A thorn. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; In his flesh. &gt;&gt; That's it. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I've heard such carnal interpretations. It's like, I wonder what kind of tree or bush that thorn come from. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe the tree of good and evil. &gt;&gt; So, here's Paul been given this incredible revelation from God himself and he's holding on to this revelation and yet God allowed a thorn in his flesh. So much speculation of what the thorn was &gt;&gt; and Paul's flesh. It's really irrelevant, saints. We don't have to go back and dig through all of the languages and the histories, try to figure out what the thorn was in Paul's life. He's telling you that what God did was to keep me from boasting in myself. God put something in my life that keeps me grounded. &gt;&gt; IT KEEPS ME BALANCED IN my life because WHILE I KNOW WHAT GOD REVEALED, I SAW THE VISION. I was in HIS PRESENCE. I SAW ALL THESE THINGS. GOD SPEAKING to me and &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm still flesh, man. &gt;&gt; I'm still human. &gt;&gt; Giving me a thorn in the flesh. He knew where that thorn come from. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've heard people I hope there's nobody here that feels this way. I've heard people and had it spoken to me in meetings in different places, usually overseas. I did this and this, brother Paul. They're in a prayer line. They come to the altar, whatever it might be. Is God punishing me? &gt;&gt; What kind of view is that of God? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; God's now become an Egyptian taskmaster. &gt;&gt; You displeased me, I'll punish you. &gt;&gt; No, my brother and sister, that's not how God works. God will let the circumstance of this world make you feel punished. But God himself will never punish you in the way Satan wants you to think. &gt;&gt; Amen. But look at this now. Given me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; He let Satan come in. Wait, who opened the hedge on Job? &gt;&gt; That's it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Did the devil pry it open? got a hedge trimmer, a chainsaw or something and cut a hole in the hedge. No sir, God says, "You know what? I'll just allow it to happen." So, what happened here? The Apostle Paul, so that he could remain balanced with the gospel, God says, you know what? I'll just pull my hand back just enough because the messenger of Satan is just waiting for an opportunity. &gt;&gt; Have you experienced this in your life? &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; That that that messenger of Satan is just waiting for his moment. And you we you we don't want to pray. We as Christians don't want to pray for patience. And you want to know patience is when that messenger of Satan, he just sits around day after day, week after week, year after year just waiting for the moment to drive a thorn into you. &gt;&gt; Maybe we could take some lessons from the devil, but I don't think we need to. &gt;&gt; Amen. Messenger of Satan to buffet me. And look what the Apostle Paul explains why &gt;&gt; he doesn't say because I'm doubting whether I'm a Christian or not. I'm doubting whether what I experienced was real or not. He's there that this given a thorn in the flesh to buffet me lest I should be &gt;&gt; exalted. Right? &gt;&gt; There ought not to be a boastful, proud Christian in existence. &gt;&gt; Because I'll tell you what, harsh statement here, forgive me. I'll apologize to you personally if it's offensive, but the guy who can boast about how great a Christian he is makes you wonder if he's really a Christian. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Otherwise, God &gt;&gt; would let that messenger &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; come to him. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; And drive that thorn home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There'll be no other gods &gt;&gt; before me. And if we are risen up in our own mind and spirit that we are infallible, that Satan can't touch us, that no, &gt;&gt; you're making a god out of yourself. &gt;&gt; And I don't have to worry about this. Isn't this beautiful? When you're just an average guy like me, I don't have to worry about being lifted up and put on a pedestal. Now, I could name some brothers who have ministries that might be at risk at that, but I just don't think I'll be on that list. But I'll tell you what'll happen. &gt;&gt; A man can lift himself. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You don't need people. &gt;&gt; Don't need Grace tabernacle. Oh, brother Paul's such a great pastor. He's such a good man. Such a No, you don't need that. &gt;&gt; We can slowly lift ourselves up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just so important. These people can't make it without me. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; No, they'll make it. All right. Because we've already proven by the word this morning that you are sons and daughters of God from before the foundation of the world. You will make it. So anybody who thinks you can't make it without them has a problem they're going to have to deal with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there it is. Lest I should be exalted above measure. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, "My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect when that thorn is poking you." &gt;&gt; I don't want to leave that as my interpretation of the scripture here. My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory. Now, look at where the Apostle Paul went from telling you, I'VE DONE THE SUPERNATURAL. GOD CAME TO ME. THIS IS THE WORD OF GOD RIGHT FROM HEAVEN, right from the throne, RIGHT TO ME. I BROUGHT IT RIGHT TO YOU and then he is there. But I would rather see. He could have gloried back up there in that scripture. But now he is. I would rather glory in my infirmity that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Cuz when I am weak, he is strong. When I am here to declare, I could go no further, but he's brought me here. Amen. That's when the Lord would come and say, "And I'll take you all the way." That's right. &gt;&gt; I'll bring you to a finish. &gt;&gt; This word will not return void. It cannot return void. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I preached all of that to preach this. Please do not miss this fact. The same abundance of mysteries is present today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, it was brought to us by these men of God. That's right. &gt;&gt; It wasn't our own personal thing that we figured out, but those mystery saints are right here today. What God revealed to the Apostle Paul, what he revealed to brother Brandham, what he revealed to all of those men through the ages is here this morning. And if we're not careful, we'll put it down like, "Yeah, yeah, that's just the message. That's just what we believe. That's right here in the Bible. It's right there in the Bible." Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm telling you, my brother and sister, the things that the Apostle Paul said, I saw or present in you today. Amen. Revealed through the word. Amen. Because everything you need is in this word. And God said that the mystery should be finished. &gt;&gt; And that means the mystery is finished this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's been poured out through the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, it didn't come from some man like I didn't come to you and and you know skip church for a month and then come some morning, oh look, I've got something special. It was just through the preaching of the word &gt;&gt; and the word has been opened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word has been revealed. &gt;&gt; And we are here, as brother Brown says, reading between the lines. If you got a special gift, it was the gift God gave you to see between those lines to see what God was really saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. The words the Apostle Paul, same word to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. The same revelation is in you. &gt;&gt; Now, let me quantify this or qualify this. We sit here today and we could say the very same things that God revealed in all these messengers through the ages coming right down to the seventh age messenger is in us. But then, Brother Brown says, "When you've got a little portion of the ocean, &gt;&gt; you've got everything that's in the ocean, &gt;&gt; but you don't have the ocean." That's right. &gt;&gt; So, it's in portion. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We're not sitting here today. We I I don't think there's anybody here in our midst this morning that can say, "I was there in bed. I was here. I was in the woods. I was whatever. And the Lord come down and showed me and did this and revealed this, and I saw a vision." We can't do that. But that word that come through that has been taken back to the Bible &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; and made plain to me &gt;&gt; plain to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did it come to us as the original edition? No. But it [snorts] come to us as revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the words right here. &gt;&gt; The same revelation &gt;&gt; in portion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Poured out to you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And thinking of the Apostle Paul, what I just preached to you, the same challenges. &gt;&gt; Now, we're human. We won't go there, but I think if we was to be honest with ourselves, we would start right here on the front row. That means you, Brother Trevor. Oh, no. Maybe it means Sister Sue. But then that would No, we'll start with you. If we were that open, if we could be that open, everyone of age and comprehension in this building, &gt;&gt; could be able to describe their thorn. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul experienced it. God [clears throat] didn't say, "It's all in theory to you." &gt;&gt; He's letting you and I &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; experience it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we glory in our infirmity? Yes. &gt;&gt; Can we give God praise for the things that we see as a weakness and a failure in our life and we say, "Oh Lord, if you would just know, my brother and sister, he's here." &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] And he's allowing that because he wants us to lift him up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we're lifting oursel up, we can't lift him up. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he allows us to go through this infirmity. If we're [snorts] not careful, we become bitter. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We become bitter. Um, &gt;&gt; someone else is the cause of my infirmity. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; someone else. But what did the Apostle Paul say? &gt;&gt; It was God that allowed that infirmity in his life. It was the messenger of Satan that actually brought it. &gt;&gt; But it was God that allowed it. &gt;&gt; And I want you to know, God will allow challenges in your life. Because if we get lifted up, my brother and sister, we will not hear the voice of God when we are lifted up in our own thinking. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with this. Sister Vik, if you would come, please. Often times, especially when we're in meetings with youth, young people question whether they're really a Christian. Maybe they got a little struggle, a girlfriend at school, a boyfriend at school, uh a certain music, certain clothes, whatever it might be, a little something that just, you know, and and they come and and I'm not speaking down on it. I I've been there. I walk this road. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you're in the influence of the world over here, you feel like you belong there. &gt;&gt; That's right. But then you go to church on Sunday and you get in the house of God and the music's playing and people are worshiping, the presence of God moves down. That same young person says, "This is where I belong." &gt;&gt; And the problem is is they spend all their time bouncing between the two of these. And all Satan wants to do is get them fatigued to the point they just say, "I must not be &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; I must not be. I'm just going to give up." The problem is they're on the wrong side of the bounce when they say, "I'm going to give up." If they would be over here in the presence of God and the house of God and the moving of the Holy Spirit, look up to our Lord Jesus and say, "I give up. [snorts] I give up. &gt;&gt; I can't do it myself any longer. I give up." But Satan, he just tries to time the bounce &gt;&gt; just right that at the point they come over here and it's there. Usually it's condemnation, little something they've done and they're like, "If I'd been a Christian, I wouldn't have done that." Well, I'll tell you what, my brother and sister, [music] you experience it yourself. You have someone close to you experience that. You take them back to the word. &gt;&gt; You take them back and show them that God already said it's done. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; Bring your problems, bring your weakness, bring your challenge. Amen. cuz I want to ask you a question. How could our Lord Jesus Christ lose a part of himself? [music] &gt;&gt; He can't do it. &gt;&gt; He can't do it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why we're seeing a a move. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; We're seeing a move taking place. People have been away from serving God for years now. And when they come back, they almost to the person confess they've been miserable for years, &gt;&gt; but they felt like in their condition they wouldn't be accepted in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Lord, I just pray that the atmosphere of Grace Tabernacle be such that we're [music] a welcoming spirit. We're a loving spirit. No, we don't love the sin, but we love the person, the sinner. Amen. and they should feel welcome to come here. We're not here to condemn. [music] We're here to speak truth and draw them into eternal life by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; I'll close with these words. &gt;&gt; You are challenged, [snorts] &gt;&gt; but you are not defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] Let's just stand. Amen. Sing a song or two. Amen. 3:17. Hallelujah. I'm trying to do better. It says C at the bottom of that. [snorts] We'll sing it in F anyway, but that's okay. Amazing grace shall always be my song of praise. It was grace that bought my li Why he came to love me so? He looked beyond [singing] my fall and saw my need. Thou forever lift mine eyes to Calary to view the cross where Jesus died for [singing] me. How marvelous. Oh, the grace that [singing and music] caught my falling soul. He looked up [music] [snorts] my fall and saw my need. Amazing grace that save me from my sin and [music] shame. Draw me close and keep me by his side. Isn't that beautiful? He drew you. Keep you right by his side. Ever I'll sing all praise, all gloryy to his name if not for him. I surely would have died. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I shall forever live my life to Calary. [music] With the cross, oh where Jesus died for me. [snorts] [music] How marvelous the grace that caught [music] my falling soul. He looked [singing] beyond my fault and saw my need. Now look at how beautiful this verse is. How sweet it is. Can we say it's sweet this morning? Walk with him this narrow way. For now I see the light of glory glee. Soon I shall see his [music] lovely face and he who will say, "Oh, what beautiful words done my child. Come be enthroned with me. [music] I shall [singing] forever Ever lift my eyes to Calary. View the [singing] cross where Jesus died for me. [music] How marvelous the grace that caught Paul's falling soul. I look [music] beyond my fall and all my need. 8.82 Brother Ivan. Hallelujah. [snorts] We thank you for your prayers. We'll be [music] lifting you up in prayer, looking for a lovely time, a time of rest, a [music] time of blessing with the saints. Amen.
