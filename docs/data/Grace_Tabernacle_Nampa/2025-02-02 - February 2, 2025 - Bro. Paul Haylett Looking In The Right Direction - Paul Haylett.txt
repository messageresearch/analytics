[Music] impart nor how believing in his word Ro peace within my heart oh but I know who I have believ and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day I know not not how the spirit moves convicing men of sin raling Jesus Through the word creating faith in him oh but I know who I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day and I know not what of good or real may be reserved for me of wey ways oh for Golden days before his face I see but I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've commanded unto him against that t I know not when my Lord may come at night or noon day Fair nor if I walk the veil with him or meet him in the air oh but I know who I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day amen as brother Paul comes once again but I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've [Music] committed um can bring them in so we can have a dedication um yes that's the melody heart is the sheeper voice I hear out in the desert dark and Dre calling the Sheep who's gone astray far from the Shepherds fold away bring them in bring them in bring them from the fields of sin bring them in bring them in bring the wanding ones from Jesus out in the desert hear their call out in the mountains wild and high heart is the master speaks to the go find my sheep wherever they be bring them in bring them in bring them in the field of sin bring them in bring them in bring the wondering ones for Jesus [Music] [Laughter] you know some people just don't really like to get up in front even though they are well out in front their service to the Lord amen what a privilege we have today God has continued to bless our congregation with young ones children and what a privilege it is to be family to them to be able to to look at them to love them wholehearted just as we love our own natural families and I certainly feel that way brother Sergey and his family what a privilege it is to be their brothers and sisters in Christ and to be their friends and how privileged we are today to dedicate little Phillip and last time I held him he smiled and then he holled so we just have to see if if he's a little happier today Phillip a lover of horses amen amen I see something changing in your future amen but what a lovely little boy so calm so Serene just uh except for times I guess but but just overall such a happy child and we're just so happy today to just give him back to the Lord uh asking the Lord's blessings on his life we don't know know how long this life here this Natural Life Will Go On The Lord's promised his return but we just desire God's blessings beyond measure for our dear brother Phillip until the coming of the Lord let's just give him back to the Lord now Heavenly Father Lord as we come before you this morning it's our privilege Lord to hold our little brother father this gift of God that you have given Lord that you uh blessed brother Sergey sister ulia and the family Lord with this little precious gy Lord the prophet says it's a gift right from the Throne of God and Lord we say Amen to that now Lord we just commit we just commit this little guy Lord our little brother Phillip to you Lord that you would give him a long life good Health but most of all father we ask Lord that you would just fill him with your Holy Spirit Lord may your peace be upon him all the days of his life father may he be able to say it was good to be raised in the house of God we ask you to bless the whole family father for each one Lord their their uh uh contribution to Philip's life Lord bless our sister Julia Lord and our brother Sergey father Lord that they may raise Phillip in the fear and admonition of the lord lord the scripture says to train up a child in the way he should go and Lord as we look at that we realize father that a part of that is understanding that we need to instill a desire in him we instill father the atmosphere and the desire father to to just be identified as your child Lord bless the family today in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you brother surgey I probably shouldn't have prophesied that he would cry God bless you am bless you amen sing one more song for the preaching of the word Lord prepare me oh sing it in C let's Stand Together As we sing this Lord prepare me to be a [Music] sanctuary pure and holy tried and true with [Applause] Thanksgiving I'll be a living [Music] Sanctuary for you Lord I'm willing now oh Lord I'm willing to be a [Music] sanctuary pure and holy tried and true with Thanksgiving Liv I'll be a living [Music] Sanctuary for you one last time Lord I'm willing oh Lord I'm will to be a Sanu [Music] pure and holy tried and [Music] true I'll be a living Sanu [Music] for [Music] you amen just you may be seated for just a minute amen um just want to mention the fellowship I don't know if we did or not um but anyway following amen have a little Fellowship uh uh uh downstairs uh food uh a couple things I also want to remember I meant to write this down in our prayer request but uh sister Wonder has asked for us to remember her fiance her and her fiance uh for all the paperwork for him to be able to come and we see what's happening in the political world and and it affects like this situation our sister Wanda's wanders fiance it possibly affect uh circumstances with brother pan and sister aona and so we know that our God can do anything so please just lift these up in these realm that we live in uh you know we are here and sometimes if we're not careful we feel like the world politics governments are controlling us but we serve a god who's controlling them and so we just commit these things to the hand of the Lord amen I don't know I'm sorry I didn't catch that but just remember um sister uh aona uh and the baby uh Lord just bless them sister Jerry and I will be leaving this Friday uh and Brother David will be taking the coming Sunday service and we get a privilege to go down and be with brother pant sister koncha for uh a couple short days but really looking forward to that um so we also uh want to um share with you that the church has um sent an offering brother Sergey has been the connections which he has been for brother Barry and that to a lot of that that's going on there and so we have sent an offering we not meaning to be vague but some of those details don't matter uh the car ke region a small Church there um they can't work you know you don't dare the brothers don't dare go out the door go to work um you know being forced into uh the military and and whatnot but we have sent a $2500 offering to be able to give support to those families there in that church um and um you know when you read the reports those of you who might receive those from Brother Barry uh you realize that winter time uh is always been difficult in those areas you know the environment the cold opportunities but when you have no opportunity to even work uh it just makes things even much more uh they they can't gather together for church but they're bold and when they had communion they still come out and so that means that puts Brothers on the streets uh in that kind of time but they they care about that they want to be part of that and take communion otherwise they typically meet uh I think uh Skype or something of that nature that they communicate by and so please remember uh brother eigor and the church there in the kke region uh brother Sergey reminded me that is very much the same region sister April went to uh when she went to the Ukraine and and so the front lines are right there their their Church uh was damaged in the shelling so that's how close uh that they live to that line uh that the artillery comes right to their neighborhood so please remember the Saints there in carke and um I'm happy to announce uh this morning that the grace banquet which is April 5th um we have a speaker and of course everything we do in life is Lord will but our brother rap cook is committed at this point to being our speaker and and we're very excited about that uh brother rap is a wonderful wonderful brother wonderful speaker and uh so I believe that will be a real blessing to our young people uh in the banquet and uh of course further details uh coming on that and we also have a speaker for the Family Camp and uh um I I at first thought it was a long shot but we asked our brother Barry coffee if he would come and be our speaker for Family Camp and uh I loved his his first response and that was that's something I can do so amen we we're just uh happy that he felt led and then we checked back with him after he had time of prayer and um so we're looking for forward to brother Barry and uh sister Becky coming and being with us I said well you might need to drive a motor home uh that you'd be sleeping in to camp and he's like can do so you got to you got to appreciate that you know that that uh just uh ready to step in there so I think those are my announcements I thank you musicians sure appreciate the dedication to this worship service let's just stand as we would um go into the word this morning my title this morning looking in the right direction it's interesting sometimes when you're just studying and you read a quote and it just speaks to you and you're like that's it there there's where we're at and uh so hopefully by God's grace will be a blessing to you today let's turn to Psalm 121 veres 1-8 and uh just take a little bit from this thought here in the word I don't know how many of you are familiar with our brother Jeremy shr but he sings sang at um sister Pit's funeral this song and it's always struck me uh these these words being drawn out and uh starting verse one I will lift up my eyes into the hills from whence cometh my help can we say Amen to that my Help Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven and Earth he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee will not Slumber behold he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep The Lord Is Thy keeper The Lord Is Thy shade upon thyine right hand the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the Moon by Night the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil can we say thank you Lord preserve us from all evil he shall preserve thy Soul Satan would like to convince you and I that we are at risk but right here hidden in the word says he's going to preserve us amen amen thank you Lord amen the Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and even forever more now I want to make a comment of my words right there we have to understand my brother and sister that we can take an approach preach as though people are outside but job was in the Hedge protected of almighty God and for God to open the Hedge doesn't mean we're lost right it's God who's in control amen and we look at this scripture I should say maybe I look at this scripture and my brother and sister I look at this through eyes that say I know I'm predestinated I know I've been called I know that God has sealed me and I know that I'm going to finish this race see not sitting here with a doubt or a fear or some kind of question mark But to come with a certainty now some people would actually say Well if you get too confident something will go wrong how can you be too confident in God Amen just as the prophet of God you know was sharing uh the little story about the woman that says you boast too much on him pardon me for using this strong of words but that's almost like an oxymoron because there's no way we can boast too much on our Lord Jesus Christ and there's no way that we can speak with too much confidence of what God has called us to amen he's the one who called and he's made the way and he gave the Assurance why don't we just get bold amen the word says we come boldly Before the Throne this should be part of of our boldness to be able to rise up and say I'm going to finish the race I'm not going to crawl across the line into Glory I'm going to March triumphant amen amen into the presence of almighty God Heavenly Father Lord we thank you this day for the opportunity to come together Lord to receive your blessings from the word Lord we just ask you help us father to speak it that it might have its full impact upon the people Lord as we look Beyond Humanity we look at beyond our knowledge our abilities we look Beyond everything and we look entirely to you today Lord knowing that you are our strength father and as these verses have declared lord it's in you that we find our security we thank you Lord and ask for your guiding hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated in the world that we live in today it is certainly A Time For Us uh to be focused uh there are so many distractions in the world there are so many things going on and uh not even just looking at worldly pleasures and those kind of things but just you know the the politics of the world the economies you know it's interesting uh how how these anointings are in this end time now I will throw something slightly political in if you don't mind for one moment just to make a point and that is you look look at like the man who got reelected and they say the vote was so ballots were burnt and things St but Mr Maduro in Venezuela has now been elected to his third term and he's got in there and now he's declaring you know we're going to invade these countries we're going to do this we're going to do that maybe we'll just go take Panama you know all of this kind of stuff and and the reason I bring that up is to reinforce the fact that the word says that there would be Wars and they are taking place and rumors of wars and and if we are caught up in that and we're looking to those things uh we'll be very much distracted uh just visiting with someone here the other day uh you know and they were like do you think this will lead to a nuclear confrontation and I I didn't I I knew they wouldn't handle it in the sense of of what we know you know I don't think that you can take someone with a question mark like that and say well there was a prophet of God who had a vision and saw America as a smoldering Wasteland it it it won't be beneficial to them but you see the point being this is on the minds of the people there there uh no rest no peace they're worried about what tomorrow will be and you know the bride of Christ we we should find ourselves uh uh staying away from those distractions we we shouldn't find ourselves looking at that and caught up in the emotion of the condition of the world Amen and and so you know uh it is all kinds of little distraction i' like to share something personal with you you know the last time that we had such tariffs in the nation my brother and sister it affected sister Jerry and I uh and our little uh economy on the farm uh severely uh you know so if I look at that and I say Well they're putting tariffs in and this is going to just tear up my world my brother and sister I wasn't counting on a president and his politics I was counting on the Lord Jesus Christ and he said he's never seen his children begging bread so I'm going to stand on that word I don't know what it will look like I don't know how it will come to pass but I got a choice to look at the world or I got a choice to look at the word and so we choose to look at the word because God said he ordered or ordained our footsteps and so we can't go out here and say I'm afraid where I'm going my brother and sister if we are in the will of God our footsteps are ordained amen and so sometimes even in our own foolishness God still got his hand all over us right you know it's there uh yeah talking to an individual here recently bought a brand new pickup he only has a $759 a month pickup payment now I'm telling you my brother and sister that's so staggering to me I can't comprehend it but it in that his life it was one of the most foolish things things I've ever done in my life and I thought you know if buying a pickup is as deep as your foolishness goes you'll be okay amen but you see there's all this distraction of the wants and the desire and all of this that's here in the world today and so these Wars rumors of wars all projected out of the word to you and I we look at politics my brother and sister politics you you can't really honestly find a Christian politician it's it's just you know it's just a a hard thing cuz after a while the corruption is so strong the influence is so strong they just don't last very long but you know there's another kind of politics in the world today that is more detrimental I believe and that is when the word of God gets thrown into a political Arena and you know we can get together and we can spend all kinds of time we can put all kinds of energies trying to explain what God meant trying to explain God we when people get all consumed in that and you know we need to know the Greek and the Latin and we need to know this that and the other so that we would be able to understand what the Lord meant but my brother and sister the same thing comes right down in the message there are people that are trying to explain what brother brandham meant well the prophet didn't say go out here and figure out what I meant he said pray for Revelation and when we pray for revelation will will understand what he said amen but look how there can be such distractions to that and so you know to understand and study the word is not what I'm saying my brother and sister it's when we try to interpret it the prophet of God said God is his own interpreter and I like God's interpretation even when it hurts amen amen right so you look at this when the prophet said pray for Revelation yes sir how would we pray for Revelation Lord give me more Revelation I want to have more Revelation I need more Revelation I need to no actually the foundation of that prayer would be Lord I Want To Know Your Perfect will he's already said when this time comes the mystery would be revealed so you know as a Believer as a daughter son of God that God's already Desiring to reveal himself to you this is not like a a mystery you know over in is Israel I just read Wars going on or was and all of those things are happening and there's still archaeologists out there just digging up because they're not concerned about all that that's another realm uh we're here and we're going to prove that that God was here prove that we as a nation were here and proving these things must come to pass and so these guys are and they're digging up little artifacts my brother and sister now I say this with a little humor I don't mean any any undercut to this but I've seen what I thought was a funny little deal the other day and it and it said a picture of a Palestinian Museum in Israel and it was an empty room now my brother and sister you see God is the prophet said that that God would prove his word amen now if he has use science which Archaeology is kind of a form of science if he uses however it is God's proving his word and there they're showing that that these things are real these things were here and it's reinforcing amongst the people in the world not just Israelis that that this is truly their land it's marked from north to south east to west even though when you look at a map and see what was promised to Israel and what they occupied is so small compared to what God promised to them but still in that land god is proving that these are my people I promis the land to them they have occupied it and they will occupy it again amen so we're looking now a lot of this going back to my title is we need to look in the right direction we can sit out here and say God is proving that Israel has occupied that land god is proving this as God is proving that but I want to ask you this morning while they're proving this what are you getting out of that exactly right you can sit here and read all kinds of books and magazines and articles and see all kinds of National Geographic type films documenting this but what are you getting out of it right amen a knowledge or Revelation that's right you see this is all Christ proving himself but for us as Gentiles we don't need to go back to find tablets and writings in a cave to know God is real we don't need to find plates and rings and gold coins and all of these things to prove that Israel occupied that land therefore the word of God is true amen God's brought it down to you and I to look at it in a personal realm now we can choose to look in that direction and say we have proof my brother and sister but I want to look in this direction and have proof amen I want to look in the word that God promised that I'll be with you even in you amen that I was in you before the foundation of the world and all of these scriptures that are pertain to that that God is proving he's with you and I I don't have to go as it were to a cave I remember a brother one time now don't misunderstand me on this but a brother one time says I so much want to go see the cave there at Green Mill and he says whatat about what do you think about this and I said I can do without it just fine thank You' and he was shocked he looked at me goes what do you mean you wouldn't want to go there I said no I believed the prophet that's right right I don't have to go there to see if it's real I believe what he said and so as we look here today and realize what God has said is right here to you and I we don't have to have something external or something that we can wow over because God said it and we believe it and therefore it will come to pass because that is God amen so you know when I say this uh uh be careful about being caught spending too much time trying to figure out what the Lord meant you have to understand that that is how you look at it it is intellectual or you can look at it and say when God wants me to see it I will see it amen there's Revelation coming to pass in our lives amen because we can dig into things and get out of season yes sir just as simple term that has been used for centuries we can get the cart before the horse am amen so when God reveals it we can dig in so deep I I think uh we could use the Seven Seals as an example amen people some dig so deep trying to prove that it's not and some dig so deep to prove that it is but I want to put it back to you in Simplicity this morning yes I study it I do my best to cross reference and put everything in its proper place but you see it's my not my job to make it real that's right it's my job whether I understand it completely or not to believe it the prophet never never said what you feel he said what you believe and so as we get into that realm now I'm not against don't misunderstand me I'm not against studying the word which some might say is intellectual but my brother and sister I I'm not opposed to that at all right that's how you teach a child right 2 plus 2 is four you're on the very threshold of intellectualism knowledge retained but you see when we come to the place that it's no longer our ability to explain we step out and say the scripture says that this mystery would be finished and it's finished yes sir can you explain it explain it to me I want you to explain it I don't need to explain it ask God to explain it to you which means you go pray for Revelation that's right but if they don't get Revelation they want natural explanation exactly right amen so as we look at this now my brother and sister the same thing happens when people start to study the message yes sir they're trying to understand the thought behind what brother Brandon was saying brother Bram said read between the lines so they're they're believing there's a mystery between the lines and I want to ask you this morning how many of you believe there's a mystery between the lines amen I would hope that every hand went up but you see they're approaching the mystery from a carnal intellectual approach that there's going to be some wow pop out but the believer when the wow comes out it's actually something in the soul that says Thank You Lord oh I love you more than ever Lord I need you more than ever Lord and someone says that's not a mystery amen and leod deia woed to sleep lukewarm distracted generation I say that's a revelation of a mystery that something inside you and I continue to just press forward in the word amen the storm Rises against you the world is against you a lot of things against you and there's something in you as you have ever been I've never been on on an ocean and had this happen but I I've been on a a lake in a boat before in a terrible storm many years ago in North Dakota and when the water is 3 feet deep when it comes over the front of your boat you start to get concerned that's right amen if I could share the humor of that there was a man fishing with us he had backslid hadn't served God for 3 four years he's out there in the boat with us and out of out of the well it would be the north I guess the wind all of a sudden picked up and it went from Dead Calm to this just horrible storm in about 2 minutes and as the water's coming over the front of the boat the back of the boat the side of the boat and and we're there and we are down there the Bild pump is running we've got a two or three bait buckets and we're we threw the bait right out it didn't matter anymore and we're we're bailing water and and you know it's pretty funny but it's not because God knows what it takes to get you and I in the position that we can see the word from the right perspective right it's not just about believing God sent a prophet my brother and sister the devil believes that God wants us to look through that and see the word revealed God used a man to say here I'm opening the book for you amen and when the book was open we need to eat that book but this brother been backslid you know God was doing something his heart cuz he come and went fishing with a whole bunch of brothers and so here he is the only unbel lever amongst us and he was in the boat with us that day and Water started coming over the nose and I remember I was there with a bucket in the back of the boat throwing water out as fast as I could and still trying to steer the boat and I look up and at first now this shows us our carnal human nature I look up at him and I said what is that guy doing why isn't he bailing water and I realized he was in the front of the boat excuse me praying through that's it yeah God forgive me that's right God forgive me he wasn't saying save my life he was saying Lord save my soul right I would have never thought that a fishing trip could turn into a Revival Lord but it did amen you know my brother and sister I I remember you know that that man before we left finished that fishing trip was a changed man you knew something had happened am my so we're not here to to try to figure out just exactly what brother brandham meant cuz now hang on to your hats coats whatever brother brandham contradicted himself am I telling the truth so therefore we can't trust this but do you know the only people who look through the message that brother Bram contradicted himself are the people who are looking in the wrong direction that's right when we start to look in the correct or right direction we see a man called of God and we see God that's right amen that's right you can't interchange those except for for when you can interchange them how's that for double talk what did Jesus say does not the word say that's right ye are Gods see how God is so so oh H how what's the word to use incredible that he takes the word and if you look at it wrong you come up with an absolutely wrong conclusion but when you look at it correctly you come up with Revelation amen God knows what he's doing and he's doing that so here's the prophet now let me put this out to you just as a mild example the prophet of God is saying now read between the lines so many men read between the lines and they came up with the Thunders right are the Thunders true yes sir they are absolutely 100% true if you look at them correctly amen hallelujah amen there's all kinds of examples we won't spend the time amen it all depends on how you are looking at this now let me throw one in for you amen you've had a bad day and the day is not getting any better and you look in the mirror and you see some person that's not even worthy to be called a son or daughter of God you see somebody that's a failure you see somebody that's too weak to go on I'm just going to quit now I want to ask you what way are you looking at that that's it amen when you look at it through the word you are looking at a battle uh scarred amen soldier of God that is there and God standing back saying Satan go ahead only thing you can do is take their life now look what we're doing I'm just going to quit I I I can't live this I can't I can't seem to do this and God sitting back yeah that's my daughter uh that's my son amen look at them victorious in every battle that's right and if we heard God say that we'd be going who whoa mistake but our God makes no mistakes can you say that with me our God makes no mistakes amen and he says you're Victorious he says you are righteous he says You Are Holy amen he's got a whole vocabulary of what he says you are and it all matters how you and I look at it that's right amen because if you are defeated and you say you're defeated I have to be defeated then you are defeated if I lost a battle or at least I don't feel victorious in the battle but God says I'm Victorious God says I'm righteous God says I'm holy God says I'm called predestinated amen says I'm his son amen a daughter whatever it all depends on how you look at it right and as we look at it wrong my brother and sister you're going to have a hard time getting a good conclusion but if you look back to that day that God dealt with your heart amen he come down anointed you with the Holy Spirit and says I sealed you amen trust God when he says I sealed you amen he wasn't looking at your flesh he don't care about your flesh amen because he knows the word is going to overcome our flesh exactly oh Hallelujah amen so you know there's people I don't want to Bel labor this but people are saying okay you know we're we're studying this and this is exactly what the prophet meant my brother and sister please just be real careful when you do that make sure that you can tie this all together because one line ties to a line which ties to another line and makes the full picture amen but the world today uh the intellectualism the phds of the Gospel you know they want to explain go my brother and sister I'd like them to just start with a blade of grass yeah why don't we spend our time wisely and just take the Simplicity of what the prophet said and just pray for Revelation that's right Lord let me just see that's right your word the way you wanted me or you intended for it to be seen amen it'd go a lot further that's right amen Psalms 119 verse 133 now I like this here is here is David you know David incredible lived on the mountain top he lived in the valley and I think he might even have crawled in the ditch a time or two you know it just it just a you know you look at that and sometimes we think our life is tough here's David are you ready for this a man after God's own heart in a ditch amen okay let's quit whining and crying about our circumstances of Life hallelujah amen because here's David literally defined as a man after God's Own Heart order my steps in thy word now I'm going to use this a little Prejudice I hope you all don't mind but you see if we wish to put this prayer order my steps in thy word then we would be counting on God for opening and showing and leading Us by his word that's right it wouldn't be us as it were blundering that's right that's I think this has to be tied with that and this means this well if that can't come back and tie all the way back here we're on a goose chase and that goose chase sooner or later becomes a disaster and let not any iniquity have dominion over me amen now my brother and sister what why would ordering your steps in iniquity be tied together because God would lead the True Believer he'll lead you no further than where you can live this happened in another country happened to know man very well started off normal got very intellectual started digging into all this stuff and and pretty soon he he just got on Shaky Ground And um there in meetings literally his wife come and said please pray for my husband uh he's now explained away the message and you're like how did do that well he's got piles and piles of books that are piles and piles of dictionaries and references to this and to that and he's got them all tied together and got great writings got all this stuff and now he believes we don't need the message and I remember at the time I was like yeah that brother's pretty smart I don't know how I would be able to deal with him but I didn't need to deal with him that's right God said I'll deal with him see there's the problem we get as preacher sometimes we're going to deal with the problem I can fix this amen but we're not called to fix it that's right God said I'll fix iten amen we're called to pray we're called to ask God to just give us wisdom in our portion of it and just leave the rest in God's hands and and in this case that brother one day just comes back I wasn't there at that time but he he just comes back and goes you know I I got the wrong definition of this one word way back here and it just led me off on this goose chase and realize once I figured out I had the wrong definition that all of this was just nothing and in one day just as in one day left one day he's back gets up church I'm sorry for all those foolish statements I made Lord help me you see God is going to order your steps in the word amen that's right that's right and that's also keeps us from going out here and putting our own in interpretation to it amen so let not any iniquity amen knowing what we should do and not doing it don't let any iniquity have dominion over us and part of that would be my brother and sister simply you know I'll take a simple example the word says uh uh uh you know repent and be baptized can we make that complicated you wouldn't think so would you but they have they've made that very complicated now the word order literally means arrange my steps amen by command amen my you know what that means we can just walk amen come on let's not get too spiritual today or maybe we should be more spiritual I don't know which one is it we can walk and God will guide those very Footsteps in his word that's right amen so we'll go in there how many times Saints I know it's happened to you you're reading your Bible and you have a question about what what does this mean and that day the next day whatever bam there's the answer amen that's God ordering your Footsteps in the word hallelujah now you know we live in a day that people really have lost their focus yes uh very very much we just look in the world today I saw a little clip here a few days ago of a giant giant Church they had a stage as big as our building and um they had a Halloween party in their church I mean goblins and Ghouls and you know in the house of God cuz they're trying to connect to the kids in their Community now I want to ask you did they bring the kids up or did they go down yeah see so not really a correct understanding of the word their idea of reaching out spreading the gospel on the wings of a snow white dove brother brandom says this here he said now this is a little bit of a shift but just follow me amen because we've been talking about looking in the right direction the ark was so constructed parentheses when you were once in it there was only oh I I'm going to Spill the Beans I have it marked right down in there my brother and sister it doesn't matter what the arc is if you're not in it that's right amen there's a lot of things we can say if this and if that ought to be but if you're not in it you can't really critique what it is amen so when you think about the rest of this quote and some of you already read the whole thing but anyway amen once in it there was only one window in it and it was right in the top you couldn't look sideways you couldn't look no way but straight up and that's the way the ark Jesus Christ is you can't look at the next fellow you can't look at nothing but Christ when you're in the ark because there's only one door and he is that door we talked about this morning you have to keep looking up amen and then the finish of that he says for he that put his hand to the plow even turned to look back not worthy of the plowing but let's look at this let's break this down for a minute my brother and sister there's almost always in every uh paragraph or deal there's something that unlocks the rest of it there's something that opens up the writing and so the ark was so constructed yeah and very important see they put it in parentheses but how important it is that if we're going to look at this whole picture from the outside the ark we're G have a whole another picture that's right that's right exactly right I was reading a deal concerning the the ark encounter or whatever they call that back East there and this man was a Critic of it he said I was going to go visit it to see what it represented and I drove up in the parking lot and I looked at it and it was huge but it wasn't big enough to hold all the animals I turned around and I left H the prophet said it takes Faith right but I've never seen that kind of Faith so I don't think faith will do it how are they looking at it that's it not giving God the chance to raise Faith up in them or reveal the faith that's already in them they just simply looked at it from that direction and says there's simply no way to have faith enough to overcome lodosa so instead of wasting my years I'm just going to stop now if you've ever seen the gold diggers cartoon it shows the man with a pick starting on the outside of the mountain and he's picking and he's but frame by frame he's digging a tunnel and it gets deeper and deeper and deeper deeper and then appearing in the edge of the frame is something that is the same color as gold and he's digging and he's digging and he's digging and he gets right there within that little breath and says I knew it there was nothing here here have we stop short yeah were we called to stop short no sir no you see it's all depending on whether we see the Promise as real and enough to give our whole life to it whether we see any outward result now when I say that I'm not talking about us with no evidence that God's with us but do you know I read a story very old book that was given to me a story of a missionary went to Africa spent I think almost 40 years there and when he was old he finally come back to America and they asked him hey what was the results you spent all those years there and he he told them he says well I really didn't have a lot of results and people are like oh you were there all those years and you don't have much for results no but you should have seen what the Lord did see it's all how we look at it man was expecting him to say we converted 10,000 or whatever it might be but he went there and realized that he had not done a single thing and God was the one behind it the whole time amen so he had the humility to declare I did not do anything I have no results but my you should have seen what the Lord did so as you look at this my brother and sister God look at the real understanding of the architecture of the the ark how would you and I feel if if you know there had been windows in those days you know and and we are we are looking out a window and the waves are taller than the ark we are looking out the window and we're seeing dead bodies Float by and huge trees ripped out by the roots floating and and we're look at that how would we react to that and God says I know how I made you and I know what I called you to so bear with me amen there's times I just have to keep you in the dark that's it that's right and I put this to you this way because it's true when you look into demonology if we walk out the doors of this church today if you go to a restaurant to eat or or somewhere tonight I guess we're eating in the basement so that part would be but you're going somewhere my brother and sister if you saw the demons that are out here in this world it would terrify you and I you say I'm a Believer I've got faith you'd be terrified my brother and sister so God keeps you and I to a degree understand me I'm not talking about absolute I'm talking to a degree he keeps us in the dark we feel those Spirits we we understand that presence that's there but if you realize if you saw a whole gang of demons you'd be terrified but God says you know what I'll let it be real enough for you to understand because you see they can't defeat me and you and I are one amen oh how simple God made this gospel he didn't make it some complicated thing for us to have to work our way through and find how to get every piece and be able to put it in place he said you know what when the time comes going back to our other deal when the time comes I'll guide your footsteps to the realm that you will understand who you are and why you're here and what you're facing and what your reward is amen oh my sometimes Humanity just needs to be reminded am amen I love that amen you can't look at nothing but Christ when you're in the ark because there's only one door amen and that one way is Jesus Christ isn't that beautiful I I love the quote as I look at amen now as we go on here uh so look at Isaiah 45:22 and the reason I po this up because in the next quote I'm going to read brother brandham refers to this so it says look unto me and be saved in all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none other so full context right there he's laying down a foundation for us now in Look Away to Jesus brother brandom says here uh the Bible said in Isaiah 45:22 we find that God says look unto me all the ends of the Earth and now when the Earth has come to its end or or system of the Earth has come to its ends let the people look unto him amen I want to ask you are we getting close I I would say we're getting close not speaking ill because we must all fulfill prophecy but Mr Putin is saying you know what you do this I think I might just nuke you my brother and sister I don't I'm not going to jump up and say oh that's it that's it but my brother and sister you're starting to see a a conversation right that's pointing to the vision brother Brown says and I saw America a smoldering ruin that's right will it come unprovoked no no it will be other factors in the world poking poking poking pushing threatening all of this and one day they'll be fully now I know none of you ever done this but it does happen when people retaliate because they feel like somebody's pushed them too far so you look at this I'm not even it doesn't matter but I'm not even going to blame Mr Putin there'll come a day that he will feel or whoever is in control will feel they've been pushed too far they're going to feel the only option they have y terrifying let's just sit down for a minute just dig into this the idea that you look up and you see a vapor trail and it's Landing in Mountain Home Air Force Base and you think well we're 80 miles away from Mountain Home Air Force Base Google says it has a blast radius of 240 miles what are we going to vaporized that's terrifying except for the bride that's right won't be here hallelujah that's what the word says amen that's what God's Prophet come and brought that Clarity to you and I we're not going to be there at that time so don't let's not sound harsh forgive me if I sound harsh but if the fact that a nuke hits Mountain Home Air Force Base how much impact has that got on you the truth of it is none at all unless we open the door and let Satan into our mind and let him torment us what's going to happen that's right but let's leave Russia out of it have you guys heard of this giant volcano they call Yellowstone and the Earth's groaning remember reading in your scripture where where the O Earth is groaning amen amen the Earth is not just rattling a little bit the Earth is groaning and I don't think the scientists are wrong I think probably you know about the time a nuke hits Mountain Home Yellowstone will say woo I got to let off the pressure yeah now see what happens my brother and sister we can sit here and worry about those things or we can look in the right direction and say the word says that's right the word says that's right amen amen Joseph's wife already in the house amen and the prophet of God says and that is a type for the bride amen amen already in the house in the meantime you know I do recommend you store up a little extra food a little water cuz you know you watch how people drive you might not have any power lines at your house it won't be the Russians and it won't be a volcano it'll just simply be some crazy person nobody here has one so somebody in a big Ford Excursion Isaac and Christian used to but they got delivered so I think we're getting close now you might say we heard this generation after generation we've heard this for a long time that is true and it's been preached for a long time many ministers has took this same text thousands of them but here is the thing I want to ask you tonight for these next few minutes when you look the question is what do you see when you look that's right do you see war in the Middle East do you see war in in Europe do you see war in maybe upper uh South America do you see what what do we see I see a bride that's it Revelations 196 that is prepared for her husband that's what I see I I'm not looking to to what this politician and what this communist and what this socialist and what this deal here and what what all Global government oh we're terrified Global government I tell you I have a global government there's only one who controls my world and his name is Jesus Christ amen he's Rich he owns a cattle on a 10,000 Hills probably to not to contradict scripture he owns a cattle on every Hill amen and you look at that my brother and sister what is it we're looking at that's it that's right now he said look unto me all the ends of the Earth Moses lifted the serpent up and whoever looks got healed now it depends on what you're looking for right amen I don't want to go too long here need to stop my brother and sister was there a reason for any Israelite to die in the wilderness from being bitten by a serpent absolutely not one Israelite should have died but you imagine just as it was when the prophet was on the scene that's it that's nonsense that's out of some Egyptian folklore that we can look on an image of a snake and be healed nonsense and it spread yeah but You' have thought after they watched one die they might have reconsidered let show you how stubborn Satan is and the spirits that go with that how stubborn those are now we're going to hold to our belief in the first church of Egypt they told us that was false Doctrine nobody gets healed all they had to do is look and live that's right all they had to do is turn and look in the right direction here's the brais and Serpent and they chose to stare off across the Horizon as they started to shake and quiver and collapse and the answer was right there before them y amen but they wouldn't look and therefore they didn't live that's it now it depends on what you're looking for I've seen people coming into the meetings in this last day can only be able to sit in the meeting for just about one or two minutes that's all they could stand see they couldn't stand it now let's not be boastful about this my brother and sister but through the years we've had dozens upon dozens of people come and sit make statements like I'm looking my Bible while that's being preached and I see that's what it says walk out the door never come back meet that person on the street and they greet you hey how are you doing doing good hey what are you up to oh but and they're just like yeah okay it was so nice to visit you that day see they they don't want to look they don't want to live it's not in them and we don't say that with arrogance but I know a bride when the word come their way God opened it they said that's what I've looked for my whole life oh my brother and sister we hear these and I don't want to just go off into this but we hear these and we think well you know good people my brother and sister there are ladies sisters that absolutely were fulfillment of scripture in this day for they were prostitutes and they've been delivered and and God cleansed them and gave them a new life and then people would look down instead of saying that's the word living again they would look down on that and say I don't know about that can God save that person see we got to be careful make sure what we're looking for is correct amen hallelujah okay we close right here Hebrews 12 1-3 wherefore seeing we're also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus amen what is it we're choosing to look unto Jesus amen we're not turning our head away from him we're looking to him because that's our only hope in fact that's our only desire we're we're not part of this world out here so how can you be identified with something you're not a part of right looking to Jesus the author and finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God for consider him that endureth such contradiction of Sinners against himself amen maybe you won't see it the same way I do he endured the contradiction of Sinners against himself yeah how it must hurt him when we are the contradiction Lord help us Lord help us don't let me be a contradiction that's right I want to look to you Lord and just as it was the Brazen serpent I want to look to you Lord and I want to live I want your word to heal me heal my soul heal my thoughts my mind my emotion physical body too I don't want to be the contradiction amen lest you be wearied and faint in your minds sister VI if you would come musicians I guess I should say hallelujah God bless you it's good to be here today amen it's good my spirit feels much lighter I get to unload these thoughts you know and unload this and realize what I'm going to see is what I'm looking for there's several other things brother brandham says through the through the message but if we're not even looking for it how are you going to see it we were with brother Gideon retif while he was still living in Krueger National Park we're driving along and brother Gideon's like did you see it brother Paul you know you're in trouble when when your guide says did you see it and I said nope I didn't even try to hide it nope brother Gideon I sure enough didn't see it he said you didn't see it brother Paul he was he was playing with me a little bit you didn't see it I said brother Gideon I didn't see it he said well just ride over there behind those bushes that whatever kind of buck they called those there he flickered an ear you should have seen that and I'm like okay but you know he took us for several days and at the end of just a few days they flicker their ear there he is you see this is what God's doing for you and I my brother and sister what might be hidden at one stage of our life he's not dragging that whatever kind of buck that was out behind the bush so you can see it he's training you to see the buck where it's at God's not dragging his word out for the whole world to see it so that you the bride of Christ can see it he's training you to see the word we should be thankful today amen that God is training Us opening our eyes our ears to be able to see the word amen and to recognize what what it means to us L's stand I don't uh I don't have the page
