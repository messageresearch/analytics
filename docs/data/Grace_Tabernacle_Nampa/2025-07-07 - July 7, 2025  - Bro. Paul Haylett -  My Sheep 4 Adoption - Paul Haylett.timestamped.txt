[3:52] He's my Lord.
[3:58] There is no other
[4:02] one
[4:05] who can calm the storms of life
[4:12] like my Lord.
[4:18] He gives rest
[4:22] to the weary.
[4:26] is who lie
[4:28] to the hopeless.
[4:32] There's no doubt
[4:36] about it. He's my Lord.
[4:44] Amen.
[4:46] You believe that this morning? I believe
[4:48] it because his word says it. Amen. You

[5:04] faith.
[5:06] [Music]
[5:11] I care not today what the tomorrow may
[5:16] bring. If shadow or sunshine or rain,
[5:23] the Lord I know ruleth over everything
[5:28] and all of my worry is vain.
[5:34] I'm living by faith
[5:39] in Jesus above.
[5:45] I'm trusting confine
[5:51] in his great love
[5:56] from arms safe
[5:59] [Music]
[6:01] in his sheltering arms.
[6:07] I'm living by faith
[6:12] and I feel no alone.
[6:18] The tempest may blow and the storm
[6:22] clouds arise, obscuring the brightness
[6:27] of life.
[6:30] I'm never alarmed at the overcast skies.

[7:10] on.
[7:14] I'm living by faith
[7:19] and I feel no alone.
[7:25] I know that he safely will carry me
[7:29] through no matter what evils be tied.
[7:36] Why should I then care though the
[7:39] tempest may blow if Jesus walks close to
[7:44] my side?
[7:47] I'm living by faith
[7:52] in Jesus above.
[7:58] I'm trusting confine

[8:34] sweet day. Our troules will then all be
[8:39] old.
[8:42] A master so gently will lead us away
[8:47] beyond that blessed heavenly show.
[8:53] I'm living by faith
[8:58] in Jesus above.
[9:03] I'm trusting confounding
[9:09] in his great love.
[9:14] From arms safe
[9:19] in his sheltering arm.

[35:04] little note here on little reminder for

[35:09] something. But, um, we want to remember
[35:11] Sister Alice. Uh, she's down Salt Lake
[35:14] on her, um, um, crazy. See, I just
[35:18] forgot what that was.
[35:20] Internship. There it is. We want to just
[35:23] remember her. Uh, all those traveling.
[35:25] Uh, our sister Toma, I'm guessing, still
[35:28] in the Ukraine. and just be with her her
[35:31] family there. Uh Aaliyah will be coming
[35:34] home from Alaska tomorrow. Uh travel
[35:37] mercies for her. I want to uh let you
[35:41] know so I don't forget brother Jonah Mi
[35:44] will be here next Sunday, this coming
[35:47] Sunday and we will be having a potluck
[35:49] fellowship to follow that. So looking
[35:52] forward to uh brother Jonah being here.
[35:55] Uh those of you don't know him, I
[35:56] believe you will enjoy brother Jonah. He
[35:59] is just down to earth, just a plain old
[36:01] guy. Uh and uh so we we just look
[36:06] forward to that and certainly want to
[36:08] welcome uh the Floyd family. Uh longtime
[36:12] friends and well, it's a big story and
[36:16] we'll just let the Lord unfold it. But
[36:18] glad to see all of you here this

[36:23] Bibles today to John the 10th chapter.
[36:26] Thank you, musicians.
[36:31] You know, I had this wild and crazy
[36:34] thought that, you know, we we should ban
[36:36] holidays and vacations. And then I
[36:39] remembered I like to take them myself,
[36:42] so we probably won't do that. But uh we
[36:45] miss each and every one when when
[36:47] they're not here. Amen. John the 10th
[36:50] chapter starting with verse 7 uh through
[36:53] verse 21. And I want to speak to you
[36:55] this morning on the topic once again of
[36:58] my sheep. Uh but concerning adoption.
[37:03] Amen. So as we look at this, you see
[37:06] each and everyone must come to adoption.
[37:08] We must come to a place that that uh we
[37:11] see who we are, why we're placed where
[37:14] we're placed.
[37:16] And I was just reading up, I wanted to
[37:18] have a little understanding of adoption
[37:20] in a broader sense. And uh I come across
[37:23] an article written by a young lady that
[37:27] um was of mixed heritage uh and uh
[37:31] Chinese and Indian and um she was
[37:35] talking about what she experienced.
[37:37] She's now a Christian and know what she
[37:39] experienced. And she says, "You see, if
[37:42] we're not careful with the wrong
[37:44] perspective concerning adoption, we
[37:47] believe that it's possible that someone
[37:49] would adopt us because they feel sorry
[37:52] for us." And I just want to put that out
[37:55] this morning as we're talking about
[37:56] adoption. Uh there was no feelings that
[38:00] I'm sorry for these and I will adopt
[38:02] them because I feel sorry for them. But
[38:05] to put it upfront so we can hold this in
[38:08] our thoughts. Uh adoption that is truly
[38:11] an adoption from the heart,
[38:14] loves,
[38:16] cares for and wants to be a part of. It
[38:21] is a choice. And so we look at that. No,
[38:25] I feel sorry. Amen. Our Lord Jesus
[38:28] didn't come and say, you know what, I
[38:29] think I'll die in the cross because I
[38:31] feel sorry for these people. But he come
[38:34] because he loved us and says I choose
[38:37] you and uh I just thank the Lord for
[38:39] that. Amen. John 10:7
[38:43] Then said Jesus unto them again,
[38:45] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am
[38:47] the door of the sheep. All that ever
[38:50] came before me are thieves and robbers,
[38:53] but the sheep did not hear them." Can
[38:55] someone say, "Thank you, Lord." Amen. I
[38:58] am the door. By me, if any man enter in,
[39:01] he shall be saved. He shall go in and
[39:04] out and find pasture. Now this reference
[39:07] of pasture is a place to be fed, a place
[39:11] to find comfort, a place to rest. So it
[39:15] is that if we would go, we will find
[39:18] this place of rest. We will be fed and
[39:21] we will find comfort in the presence of
[39:23] our Lord Jesus Christ. The thief cometh
[39:26] not but to steal, for to steal and to
[39:28] kill and destroy. I am come that they
[39:31] might have life, that they might have it
[39:33] more abundant. Now, I want to I don't
[39:36] mean to draw this out, keep you
[39:37] standing, but uh just a few comments
[39:40] because we more than likely will not
[39:41] come back to them. My brother and
[39:43] sister, it's one thing to have life.
[39:47] People have life. Miserable people have
[39:50] life.
[39:51] But to have it abundant, that is that
[39:54] measure of life that only comes from our
[39:56] Lord Jesus Christ. When it comes in
[39:59] abundance, it changes forever. Amen. You
[40:03] know, I love to read. I just read an
[40:05] article the other day. This man says a
[40:07] little thing that caught my attention.
[40:08] Well, I'll never buy another lottery
[40:10] ticket. And I thought, now, why would a
[40:13] man say that? Now, we don't believe in
[40:15] that. We don't really see that as an
[40:17] answer. It's just uh you're you're
[40:19] hoping, you're gambling, you're what?
[40:21] But this man's talking about how he won
[40:23] a substantial amount of money and it
[40:25] ruined his life. Amen. So there he
[40:29] thought when he won this that oh I'm
[40:31] going to have life now. I'm going to
[40:33] have this great and all it did is bring
[40:35] sorrow to him. So we want to have life
[40:38] and have it more abundantly. I am the
[40:40] good shepherd and the good shepherd
[40:42] giveth his life for the sheep. But he
[40:45] that is a hirling and not the shepherd,
[40:48] whose own sheep are not, seeketh the
[40:50] seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the
[40:53] sheep, and fleth. And the wolf catcheth
[40:56] them, and scatterth the sheep. The
[40:58] hirling fleth, because he is an
[41:00] hireling, and carth not for the sheep. I
[41:03] am a good shepherd, and know my sheep,
[41:06] and have known of mine. As the Father
[41:09] knoweth me, even so I know the Father,
[41:12] and I lay down my life for the sheep.
[41:15] And other sheep I have which are not of
[41:17] this fold, them also I must bring, and
[41:20] they shall hear my voice, and there
[41:22] shall be onefold, and one shepherd.
[41:26] Therefore doth my father love me,
[41:29] because I lay down my life that I might
[41:31] take it again. No man taketh it from me,
[41:34] but I lay it down of myself. And one
[41:37] more comment I'd like to say here. This
[41:40] is exactly our position. No one should
[41:42] be here saying you've got to lay your
[41:44] life down. We should be saying, "Lord, I
[41:47] recognize I must lay my life down."
[41:50] Because if we lay our life down
[41:52] grudgingly, we lay it down with
[41:54] resistance. We haven't really laid it
[41:56] down. But when we come and lay it down,
[41:58] our Lord Jesus says, "You know what? I
[42:00] laid my life down. I did this. I was not
[42:03] forced. I willingly have done this." Say
[42:07] amen. No man taketh it from me, but I
[42:09] lay it down of myself. I have power to
[42:11] lay it down, and I have power to take it
[42:13] again. This commandment have I received
[42:16] of my father. There was a division
[42:18] therefore again among the Jews of these
[42:20] sayings. And many of them said, he hath
[42:22] a devil, and is mad. Why hear ye him?
[42:26] And others said, these are not the words
[42:31] of him that hath a devil. Aren't you
[42:34] glad we can hear the word today that
[42:36] it's not the words of someone that has a
[42:38] devil? Can a devil open the eyes of the
[42:42] blind and think of that as natural and
[42:45] spiritual? Heavenly Father, we just ask
[42:48] you Lord just to come speak to our
[42:50] hearts today. Lord, we love you and
[42:52] certainly in the day that we live in
[42:54] everything that's in this earth, this
[42:56] world, all of the tragedy, all of the
[42:58] struggle, Father, we need you. You are
[43:02] the peace, the calm in the center of the
[43:04] storm. And we thank you for the
[43:06] opportunity to come today to hear your
[43:08] word. Lord, may we speak words that
[43:11] would be encouraging. In the precious
[43:13] name of Jesus Christ, we ask. Amen. You
[43:16] may be seated, saints. Amen.
[43:20] Now, as the scripture has said here,
[43:22] there's only one door which man can
[43:24] enter by. And the scripture really is
[43:27] very, very clear. It's not the door of
[43:29] the church. Amen. We have a commission
[43:32] to to not forsaking the assembling of
[43:35] ourselves together. But entering the
[43:37] door of the church will not solve our
[43:40] problems. Amen. We can meet God on the
[43:43] back side of a desert and he has many
[43:45] people on the mountaintop in the in the
[43:48] valleys deep. Uh we can even meet him in
[43:51] the miry clay. But it's there that lays
[43:54] out a clear plan. We see this scripture.
[43:56] If you look at it uh very carefully,
[43:58] you'll see a clear picture of
[44:00] salvation's plan of how God is coming
[44:03] and how the word has come to you and I.
[44:05] And we understand that no man has ever
[44:08] sought God, but it's always God seeking
[44:10] us. And so I I thank the Lord for that
[44:13] because when we recognize that he's
[44:16] seeking us, we'll recognize that when he
[44:19] come to you, that wasn't a man doing
[44:21] that. That wasn't a program doing that.
[44:24] Uh but it was God himself coming and and
[44:27] coming to you, coming to uh your portion
[44:30] of the pasture as it were, coming to
[44:33] your place where you live. And and you
[44:35] might say, "Well, that wasn't or isn't a
[44:37] very good spot at the moment." But you
[44:40] see, it doesn't matter because God came
[44:41] to you there. He came to you on your
[44:43] good days, on your bad days. And and so
[44:46] it's there. Now, we'll look at this as
[44:48] we'll study this out. we will see that
[44:51] Jesus is speaking in a fashion that
[44:54] denotes ownership, my sheep. He doesn't
[44:58] say some sheep or those sheep, but he
[45:01] says my sheep. And so we have to
[45:04] recognize that by that he is actually
[45:07] making a claim that denotes ownership.
[45:10] In other words, we have an identity that
[45:13] is confined or brought into him. Amen. I
[45:17] don't think anyone in their right mind
[45:19] would say, "I want to be the devil's
[45:20] sheep." You know, he he puts them in a
[45:23] pasture of briars and thistles and no
[45:26] water and starves them down and causes
[45:28] them to eat, you know, ragweed and cause
[45:31] them to eat all of these other things
[45:33] that that do and and I want to be his
[45:35] sheep. No, my brother and sister, we
[45:37] want to walk into the valley, amen, of
[45:40] the shadow of death where we would fear
[45:43] no evil. Amen. that we can simply walk
[45:45] in this life without a single fear of
[45:49] what this world has. Amen. You know, you
[45:52] you listen to some of these these people
[45:54] and they're they ask people on the on
[45:56] the streets, they ask questions and you
[45:59] know, uh it's interesting because uh
[46:02] even into our younger generations, while
[46:05] some people say the younger generations
[46:07] aren't interested in serving God, but
[46:10] that's not what they admit when they're
[46:12] asked questions on the street. What do
[46:14] you think of the future? What do you
[46:15] think of this? And and they say, you
[46:17] know, there's got to be someone to save
[46:19] us. There's got to be someone who cares
[46:21] enough about us to save us. Well, do you
[46:24] think that's a president or a
[46:26] government? No, I don't. It will take
[46:28] someone greater than that. And so, you
[46:30] see, there's a longing within the heart
[46:32] of these young people that they're
[46:35] looking because they know that the
[46:37] direction the world's going right now,
[46:39] it will not end well. Amen. And so
[46:42] there's something inside of them that is
[46:44] speaking out because they're desiring to
[46:46] be saved. But you see that uh ideas that
[46:49] have been presented or instilled into
[46:52] them leave them without a hope because
[46:55] they're not even sure there is a God.
[46:57] Now, my brother and sister, I I just,
[46:59] you know, I'm kind of different uh in
[47:01] the way I study and I go look at some
[47:03] kind of oddball type stuff, but I I
[47:05] really want to just have an idea of
[47:08] where they're at because you see where
[47:10] they're at shows us where we're at.
[47:12] Amen. as they're coming to the place,
[47:15] religious men talking about the Bible as
[47:18] just being a book of stories that we
[47:20] cannot take it serious and we're not
[47:22] going to uh present this to our church
[47:26] because we don't want to give them a
[47:28] false hope. My brother and sister, if
[47:30] that's what's being fed from the pulpit,
[47:32] no wonder the people are disturbed. No
[47:35] wonder they're sitting there questioning
[47:37] whether there really is a hope, whether
[47:39] salvation is real, whether there is
[47:42] eternal life. But what we need is some
[47:44] men who are not hierlings that will
[47:47] stand up and say, "You know what? This
[47:49] is what the word says, and this is where
[47:51] I pin my hope. And I don't have any
[47:54] other place to go. I certainly don't
[47:56] trust it to the government, to this
[47:58] people, to that people, but I will trust
[48:00] it to my Lord Jesus Christ." And so when
[48:03] we come into that and recognize as Jesus
[48:06] is speaking and to make this emphasis my
[48:09] sheep. Amen. There's an identity there
[48:12] that he is declaring that there are
[48:14] people on the earth today that he has
[48:17] identified as his people. And somebody
[48:20] ought to be happy about that to be able
[48:22] to say, you know what, I'm glad I can be
[48:25] identified as God's people. Amen. That
[48:28] he has claimed ownership. It'd be one
[48:31] thing for you and I to say he we we are
[48:34] his sheep, but it's quite another when
[48:36] he himself says you are my sheep. Amen.
[48:39] And so it's there that uh his sheep, my
[48:42] sheep, uh he knows and is known.
[48:46] Amen.
[48:46] Amen. And that's the beauty of it. He
[48:48] knows and is known. Amen. and he doesn't
[48:51] leave it as a mystery out there of who
[48:54] could possibly qualify for this or who
[48:57] would be good enough, who would be in
[48:58] the right place at the right time. None
[49:00] of that matters, my brother and sister,
[49:03] as we spoke these last few Sundays,
[49:06] he'll go out to the canyon, to the
[49:07] abyss. Amen. And to those that have
[49:10] lived and gone to the edge of the abyss,
[49:13] amen, you fully understand what it is
[49:15] for the Lord Jesus to come to you and
[49:17] find you where you are at. Amen. And so
[49:21] Ephesians uh the first chapter verses
[49:23] 5-14
[49:25] he said having predestinated us into
[49:27] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[49:31] himself according to the good pleasure
[49:34] of his will. So you see there's nowhere
[49:37] in this equation that is actually our
[49:39] will. Our will is molded to his will.
[49:43] Now he knows that there's something in
[49:45] us that desires. There's something there
[49:48] and that was God himself. So if you are
[49:50] feeling pulled to a certain direction,
[49:52] God moving in your life doing these
[49:55] things, realize it's God himself
[49:58] standing in your midst, pulling you,
[50:01] Amen, into adoption to the praise of the
[50:04] glory of his grace, wherein he hath made
[50:06] us accepted in the beloved. in whom we
[50:10] have redemption through his blood,
[50:12] forgiveness of sins, according to the
[50:14] riches of his grace, wherein he hath
[50:16] abounded towards us, and all wisdom and
[50:20] prudence. This is a part of living life
[50:24] in abundance. Amen. That God himself has
[50:27] abounded towards us wisdom and prudence,
[50:30] having made known unto us the mystery of
[50:32] his will, according to his good
[50:34] pleasure, which he hath per purposed in
[50:37] himself. Amen. So, here's the whole plan
[50:40] of God. It is not for us, my brother and
[50:44] sister, to figure out why God would call
[50:46] us. It is not for us to figure out how
[50:49] God is calling us. It's for us to
[50:52] recognize that he is calling us. And
[50:55] when we recognize that he is calling us
[50:58] and is making the way before us, then we
[51:02] start to recognize that we were always
[51:05] in the plan of God. Not, you know,
[51:07] people say, "Well, I I got saved uh at
[51:10] this certain time at camp meeting, at a
[51:13] revival. I got saved in a little church
[51:15] in the country. I got saved here. I got
[51:17] saved there." My brother and sister,
[51:20] actually, really what that was is you
[51:21] were saved before the foundation of the
[51:24] world cuz God said, "I knew you and I
[51:26] chose you and I've never lost a single
[51:29] one." Amen. So that doesn't mean we're
[51:31] going to go live like the devil because
[51:32] we can't be lost because that's not the
[51:35] nature of God. Amen. So if we have the
[51:38] spirit of Christ, we will also have his
[51:41] nature. And his nature is not to live
[51:44] outside the boundaries of the word, but
[51:46] his nature is that we submit. We
[51:48] recognize this is who I am. And so in
[51:52] that place right there to understand his
[51:55] will. Amen. that he has come and he
[51:58] purposed himself to reveal to you and I.
[52:02] So someone might say, "I got saved at
[52:04] this time or that time." I would like to
[52:06] put it this way. That's the time you
[52:08] recognized who you were. Amen. It had
[52:11] nothing to do with salvation cuz your
[52:13] salvation come from before the
[52:15] foundation of the world. But now is a
[52:18] time of recognizing. Amen. in a time of
[52:22] identity that we see that God speaking
[52:25] to us, shining the light in such a
[52:28] fashion. You know, I know this is
[52:30] probably a crazy analogy, but you know,
[52:32] you might have someone helping you. I've
[52:34] done it a million times. Uh I I I
[52:37] learned this as a as a young boy. Amen.
[52:40] I know that Cody will totally recognize
[52:42] what I'm doing and and dad will say,
[52:44] "Hey, shine the light right down here so
[52:46] I can see what I'm doing." Amen. And
[52:49] we're there. Our mind is somewhere else
[52:52] and we are shining the light. Praise
[52:54] God. I am shining the light. And then
[52:56] they finally say, "Would you shine it
[52:58] where it's supposed to be shown?"
[53:00] Because we were shining it here and or
[53:03] moving, you know. Oh, my nose is
[53:04] itching. Oh, yeah. Yes. Uh but you see,
[53:08] my brother and sister, God comes and he
[53:11] doesn't randomly flicker the light
[53:13] across your life. He comes and he shines
[53:15] the light down into our life and it
[53:17] lights up those things in our life that
[53:20] we need to see. And one of the primary
[53:22] things we need to see is how much we
[53:24] need the Lord Jesus Christ in our life.
[53:26] That that's one of the greatest things
[53:28] that we need. People say, "I'm looking
[53:30] for deep revelation." Well, let me tell
[53:32] you, recognizing who you are in Jesus
[53:35] Christ is a very deep revelation. Amen.
[53:39] Otherwise, the light flickers all around
[53:41] us. We can feel religious. We can feel a
[53:44] lot of things, but it won't shine long
[53:46] enough to reveal who you are. But by
[53:49] God's grace, he shines it and focuses it
[53:51] right down upon us. Amen. I love these
[53:54] scriptures here. I I really do. It It is
[53:57] so so precious to me. And as you look at
[54:01] this, having made known unto us the
[54:04] mystery of his will, according to his
[54:06] good pleasure, which he has purposed in
[54:09] himself, that in the dispensation of the
[54:12] fullness of times, he might gather
[54:14] together in one all things in Christ,
[54:17] both which are in heaven and which are
[54:19] in earth, even in him, in whom also we
[54:23] have obtained an inheritance,
[54:25] being predestinated according to the
[54:28] purpose of him who workketh all things
[54:30] after the council of his own will. Now,
[54:33] let me just put this clarification on
[54:34] predestination. The correct
[54:37] understanding and interpretation of
[54:38] predestination is not God forcing us.
[54:42] Amen. Predestination is God knowing
[54:44] what's in your heart. Amen. A seed. And
[54:48] every seed must bring forth of its own
[54:50] kind. And so him knowing the seed that's
[54:53] in you, he can make a wholehearted
[54:55] declaration to the devil and the rest of
[54:58] creation and say this is a son or
[55:01] daughter of God because he sees the
[55:04] seed. Amen. You don't plant a corn seed
[55:06] and get a bean. Amen. You do not pass
[55:09] plant wheat and get a thistle. Amen. So
[55:12] every seed and you look at this how that
[55:15] God is working because it's his purpose.
[55:19] So his seed planted is purpose. Amen.
[55:24] I love inheritance. I think that's just
[55:26] really awesome. Natural, spiritual, but
[55:29] really I want to focus on the spiritual
[55:31] because the natural inheritance, well,
[55:34] there'll come a day that that's going to
[55:36] all go up in smoke.
[55:37] Yeah.
[55:38] We can work for earthly treasure. We can
[55:41] do everything we can do to come to great
[55:44] means on this earth. And yet if a man
[55:48] lose his soul,
[55:51] man, I mean it's we don't even need to
[55:53] go down that. I'll get sidetracked here
[55:55] this morning.
[55:57] Amen. That we should be the praise of
[56:00] his glory, who first trusted in Christ,
[56:04] in whom he also trusted at you heard the
[56:06] word of truth, the gospel of your
[56:08] salvation, in whom also after that ye
[56:12] believe you were sealed with that Holy
[56:14] Spirit of promise. Amen. Aren't you glad
[56:17] with that ceiling? Amen. That God comes
[56:19] right down and he puts that promise in
[56:21] the heart and you say, "But I I knew a
[56:24] person here. I knew a person there that
[56:26] served the Lord and then just fell
[56:27] away." My brother and sister, there's
[56:29] some things that I don't know how we
[56:31] explain these things. I I'm not going to
[56:33] judge it because, you know, uh just you
[56:36] you meet people, you encounter people
[56:39] that uh you know, grew up in church,
[56:41] left the Lord, lived righteously for 30
[56:44] or 40 years, and one day wake up and
[56:47] say, "I've got to serve God. I've got
[56:49] it." So, let's not get to a point we
[56:51] think that somebody has tossed away
[56:53] their salvation. They've become
[56:54] distracted. Satan has thrown something
[56:57] before them that has caused them to to
[56:59] be uh pulled away. But my brother and
[57:02] sister, here again, when God puts a seed
[57:05] in a person and then declares that that
[57:07] seed is his seed, when the light shines
[57:10] on it, amen, it will grow.
[57:13] And when it grows, you will not deny
[57:15] that. Amen. We've we've seen it through
[57:17] the years. I I just remember one time
[57:19] doing construction work and and uh right
[57:22] here in Nampa, we were bid a bunch of
[57:24] work for the city of Nampa's uh housing
[57:26] rehab program. And these are houses
[57:29] typically, sorry to if it sounds bad,
[57:31] but north of the tracks and rough
[57:33] neighborhoods and and the houses had
[57:35] been run down. Many of them were elderly
[57:37] people with no family that cared and and
[57:40] they owned their home, but they were not
[57:42] able to maintain uh uh you know, broken
[57:44] windows, broken doors, shingles that
[57:47] were off and and all of this kind of
[57:49] stuff. And the city had a program that
[57:51] they would go in there and and they
[57:53] would rehab these houses uh uh uh for,
[57:56] you know, with the guidelines and and my
[57:58] brother and sister, I know this has
[58:00] nothing to do with rehabing a house, but
[58:01] it's what brought me to see this. And
[58:04] here was a house, a little old lady,
[58:06] very sweet elderly lady, and and she had
[58:09] family right here in this valley, but
[58:11] they simply just were were uh um what's
[58:15] the right word? Um,
[58:19] I I want to use my You guys won't mind
[58:21] if I use my language. They could care
[58:22] less.
[58:23] They never paid one bit to the condition
[58:25] their mother was living in.
[58:28] But I remember the first day we walked
[58:30] up to go in this house to bid it.
[58:34] In the cracks of the sidewalks
[58:37] were flowers, beautiful flowers growing.
[58:41] And something spoke to my heart and I
[58:43] thought of all the places that a
[58:46] beautiful flower would grow.
[58:49] How would it be that in the crack of a
[58:53] sidewalk?
[58:55] But you see that seed was ordained to
[58:57] life.
[58:59] How the seed got in the crack of the
[59:00] sidewalk, we have no idea.
[59:03] There were no flowers like this around
[59:05] it.
[59:07] But it didn't say I can't grow.
[59:09] Right. I'm in the crack of a sidewalk.
[59:13] I can't grow because I'm not in the
[59:15] correct environment.
[59:18] It said I'm a beautiful flower. It's
[59:21] been predestinated the seed to produce
[59:23] these beautiful uh uh bulbs, these
[59:26] beautiful uh flowers. Uh it's in me.
[59:29] It's just who I am. And so even in the
[59:32] crack of a sidewalk, it expressed
[59:35] itself. Now, I'm telling you today, my
[59:37] brother and sister, when we recognize
[59:39] that the life that God has placed in you
[59:41] and I is so strong, so powerful, so
[59:45] predestinated to come to life, that
[59:48] don't use your condition, your
[59:50] situation, where you are at as an excuse
[59:53] of why you can't. Amen. If a flower can
[59:56] grow in a sidewalk, you can grow in
[59:58] Christ wherever he has planted you.
[1:00:01] Amen. And and so we want to just take
[1:00:03] that and hold that as a promise and say,
[1:00:05] Lord, I am as that little flower where
[1:00:08] you have placed me. I will still produce
[1:00:10] a beautiful flower. Amen. I will
[1:00:13] blossom. I will bring forth light and
[1:00:15] I'll show the beauty of who I am. Amen.
[1:00:20] After
[1:00:22] you've heard the word of truth, the
[1:00:24] gospel of your salvation, in whom after
[1:00:26] that ye believed, you were sealed by
[1:00:29] that holy spirit of promise, which is
[1:00:31] the earnest of our inheritance. So
[1:00:34] understand that this is not our
[1:00:36] inheritance in its entirety, but it is
[1:00:39] an earnest, a down payment of our
[1:00:41] inheritance until the redemption of the
[1:00:44] purchased possession and to the praise
[1:00:45] of his glory. So we can say, well, does
[1:00:48] it get better than this? Let me tell you
[1:00:50] my brother and sister, according to
[1:00:51] every promise in the word of God, it
[1:00:53] gets much better than this. Amen. It is
[1:00:56] more than anything. Just think of the
[1:00:58] mountain majesty grandeur that we have
[1:01:01] seen. And and you see that brother
[1:01:03] Adrian just sent me some pictures here
[1:01:05] recently uh taken up in Glacier Park. I
[1:01:09] don't know if it was from this year. I
[1:01:10] think it might have been last year, but
[1:01:12] but he's sending me pictures and and you
[1:01:14] look at that and it is so incredible how
[1:01:18] beautiful it is, my brother and sister.
[1:01:21] But I wouldn't want to make that my home
[1:01:22] year round. Amen. You know, when they uh
[1:01:26] when they plow the roads about this time
[1:01:28] of year and they still plow four or five
[1:01:30] feet of snow, how could anything grow
[1:01:32] there? But you look after the sun, Amen,
[1:01:35] has risen. Amen. No matter what the
[1:01:38] condition, no matter the coldness of its
[1:01:40] environment, that flower predestinated
[1:01:44] to grow, it grows and it puts forth a
[1:01:47] beautiful essence before God. Amen.
[1:01:49] That's our lives. Amen. Now, let's look
[1:01:52] go along before we get into more
[1:01:54] commentary. Romans the 8th chapter and
[1:01:57] uh so first verse he says, "There is
[1:02:01] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:02:04] which are in Christ Jesus." So, let's
[1:02:06] just stop letting the devil cause
[1:02:08] ourselves to beat ourselves. Amen. What
[1:02:10] we need to do is get into Christ Jesus.
[1:02:13] And so, then there will be no
[1:02:15] condemnation. Who walk not after the
[1:02:17] flesh, but after the spirit. For the law
[1:02:20] of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[1:02:22] hath made me free from the law of sin
[1:02:25] and death. Amen. Isn't it good? We're no
[1:02:27] longer slaves. Amen. I'm glad we are no
[1:02:30] longer slaves, but we are free. Amen. So
[1:02:34] it's there that we can walk after the
[1:02:36] spirit. For they that are after the
[1:02:38] flesh do mind the things of the flesh,
[1:02:41] but they that are after the spirit the
[1:02:44] things of the spirit. For to be carnally
[1:02:47] minded is death.
[1:02:49] Amen.
[1:02:50] But to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:02:52] peace.
[1:02:54] Because the carnal mind is immity
[1:02:56] against God. For it is not subject to
[1:02:59] the law of God. Neither indeed can it
[1:03:01] be.
[1:03:02] That's right. So then they that are in
[1:03:04] the flesh cannot please God.
[1:03:06] Amen.
[1:03:07] We don't we don't even need a great
[1:03:08] revelation of the scripture to realize
[1:03:10] that when we're just living making this
[1:03:13] flesh happy. Amen. That it does not fit
[1:03:16] within the plan of God. It is it is not
[1:03:18] what God would ordain. But yet the flesh
[1:03:21] likes it. Amen. You know it took me a
[1:03:24] lot of years to realize I was addicted
[1:03:26] to sugar.
[1:03:28] And you know the more that you eat
[1:03:30] sugar. Have you ever had somebody make
[1:03:33] just a incredibly good cookie?
[1:03:36] Oh yes.
[1:03:37] Yes. Someone say amen.
[1:03:41] Can you eat just one?
[1:03:45] Is it because it's an incredible cookie
[1:03:47] that you can't eat just one?
[1:03:50] Let's get into a little science of
[1:03:51] nutrition here. Amen. Actually, when you
[1:03:55] take a bite of that cookie, there's
[1:03:58] little things in your body that get
[1:04:01] excited at the presence
[1:04:03] of sugar.
[1:04:06] It doesn't say, "I want more flour."
[1:04:09] It doesn't even really cry out and say,
[1:04:11] "I'm going to eat more oatmeal."
[1:04:14] Your body actually cries out for the
[1:04:16] sugar.
[1:04:17] Yeah.
[1:04:19] And now I'll take that back on the
[1:04:20] oatmeal because there was a doctor once
[1:04:22] that Jerry and I visited and he took
[1:04:25] oatmeal and put pomegranate juice and
[1:04:28] all kinds of things in that and then put
[1:04:30] it in the refrigerator and let it sit
[1:04:32] there for a day or two and then was
[1:04:34] telling me now Paul if you'll just eat
[1:04:36] this you'll feel better and every sense
[1:04:39] that I had says not going to happen.
[1:04:45] He was pretty healthy though, I had to
[1:04:48] admit, a lot healthier than I was. But
[1:04:52] you see, my brother and sister, this is
[1:04:53] the way being carnally minded is. We go
[1:04:56] out into the world and we become
[1:04:58] partakers of the world and we take one
[1:05:01] bite of those things and and it begs us
[1:05:04] to take another bite. It begs us to take
[1:05:07] a to enter in a little deeper, you know,
[1:05:11] and as the prophet said, you know, uh
[1:05:13] sin will take you further than you ever
[1:05:17] that's not his exact words, but than you
[1:05:19] ever intended to go because you take a
[1:05:22] bite and that takes another bite and
[1:05:24] another bite and and it just completely
[1:05:26] comes to the place that we are. And oh,
[1:05:29] let me put it this way. The idea of the
[1:05:31] addiction to sugar is not Paul's idea.
[1:05:33] Amen. It's a very much a proven idea.
[1:05:37] Amen. So you there. But in the meantime,
[1:05:40] while I'm eating this oatmeal cookie
[1:05:41] that tastes so good, I'm saying sugar
[1:05:44] can't be as bad as they say it is
[1:05:47] because my body likes it. Well, just
[1:05:49] think about when we are in sin and
[1:05:52] trespass. We are there. The atmosphere,
[1:05:55] our body, our spirit says, "I like this.
[1:05:59] It's not as bad as a preacher says it
[1:06:02] is." not as bad as what the word of God
[1:06:05] says it is because otherwise I couldn't
[1:06:08] enjoy it as much as I do. Well, my
[1:06:11] brother and sister, there are all kinds
[1:06:13] of addictions. Amen.
[1:06:16] So, you look at that. If we're in the
[1:06:18] flesh, we cannot please God. But you're
[1:06:21] not in the flesh, but in the spirit.
[1:06:23] Now, let me just Do I need to repeat
[1:06:25] what I just said about addictions? Amen.
[1:06:28] Let me tell you, when you get in the
[1:06:30] spirit, Amen. you get in the presence of
[1:06:32] God. When you get in that atmosphere,
[1:06:35] you're not happy with just one bite.
[1:06:38] Amen. You're not happy with just once in
[1:06:41] a while entering into that. And this is
[1:06:44] the thing, my brother and sister.
[1:06:45] Sometimes when when people don't seem to
[1:06:47] really be committed, you know, it's
[1:06:49] because they've got too many other
[1:06:51] things in their spiritual appetite that
[1:06:55] they're they're filling it up. you know,
[1:06:57] kind of like uh you know, I've I've seen
[1:07:00] my grandkids do this. You know, can
[1:07:02] Grammy, can I have a cookie? And they
[1:07:04] eat a cookie and then you realize the
[1:07:06] whole package is gone. And then it's
[1:07:07] Grammy has fixed supper and they're
[1:07:09] like, we're not hungry.
[1:07:12] So, see what it is. If we're appetite is
[1:07:14] on too many other things besides the
[1:07:17] word, besides the things of God, that
[1:07:19] doesn't mean you never enjoy yourself,
[1:07:21] that you don't get to enjoy a good book
[1:07:23] or whatever it might be. But my brother
[1:07:25] and sister, when you indulge too much in
[1:07:27] those things, you're filled up. Amen.
[1:07:30] And you won't be filled on the right
[1:07:32] things. Amen. Amen. So they that are in
[1:07:35] the flesh cannot please God.
[1:07:38] But you're not in the flesh, but in the
[1:07:39] spirit. If so be the spirit of God dwell
[1:07:41] in you. And now if any man have not the
[1:07:43] spirit of Christ, he's none of his. So
[1:07:46] we're looking at adoption here. And if a
[1:07:49] if Christ be in you, the body is dead
[1:07:52] because of sin, but the spirit is life
[1:07:54] because of righteousness. But if the
[1:07:57] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:07:59] the dead dwell in you. That's our goal,
[1:08:01] right? To have that spirit dwelling in
[1:08:03] us. Amen. He that raised up Christ from
[1:08:07] the dead shall also quicken your mortal
[1:08:10] body by his spirit that dwelleth in you.
[1:08:12] Can you find anywhere in these
[1:08:14] scriptures where it says, "Sign your
[1:08:15] name on the book and be faithful in
[1:08:17] attendance and you're a Christian and
[1:08:18] going to heaven?"
[1:08:19] No.
[1:08:20] See, this is the problem that we've had.
[1:08:22] Religion has morphed into something. We
[1:08:24] got a mortgage to pay. We've got this to
[1:08:27] do. We've got that to do. What we need
[1:08:29] you to do is feel the need to come and
[1:08:32] come to church and be faithful to just
[1:08:35] come to church. But my brother and
[1:08:36] sister, a real true body of believers
[1:08:39] wants to live in that spirit. They want
[1:08:42] to live in that presence. And the rest
[1:08:45] of this does not matter. Our name on a
[1:08:47] book. Nowhere in scripture does it say
[1:08:49] put your name on a book. Amen. Other
[1:08:52] than to know that our name is on the uh
[1:08:54] lamb's book of life. But you see, we
[1:08:56] come and this is where the distortion
[1:08:58] comes because man is wanting to do it
[1:09:00] man's way. Man is trying to organize and
[1:09:04] put it in place that that this is our
[1:09:06] idea of what it takes to be a good
[1:09:09] faithful Christian. I'll tell you what
[1:09:10] it takes to be a good uh faithful
[1:09:12] Christian is get the spirit of him that
[1:09:15] raised Christ from the dead in us. And
[1:09:17] when that spirit is in us, it will
[1:09:20] change our world so radically that we
[1:09:22] will then look and and where we used to
[1:09:24] have bitterness and and maybe even to
[1:09:27] the degree of hatred, uh enmity, uh uh
[1:09:30] all of those kind of things, the the
[1:09:31] Holy Spirit just comes and starts to
[1:09:33] wash that away. And we find oursel then
[1:09:36] cleansed. And my brother and sister, the
[1:09:38] person you forgave may never change, but
[1:09:41] you will.
[1:09:41] Amen.
[1:09:43] You absolutely will.
[1:09:45] But you can hold on to bitterness and
[1:09:47] imnities, and you will find like a
[1:09:50] cancer, it will eat you and never touch
[1:09:53] them.
[1:09:54] Amen.
[1:09:55] That's right.
[1:09:57] Ouch.
[1:09:59] See how slick slippery the devil is?
[1:10:02] He comes in there and we self-destruct
[1:10:04] ourself
[1:10:06] and we try to blame it on someone else.
[1:10:08] But the word says you just let that go
[1:10:10] and commit that to the Lord and let him
[1:10:13] deal with it and he'll set it in order.
[1:10:16] Amen.
[1:10:17] But if we're out of order, how can we
[1:10:18] expect him to set them in order?
[1:10:21] He wants to start with us.
[1:10:22] Amen.
[1:10:23] He wants to set us in order. Now, people
[1:10:26] say, "Well, I I don't know that I can
[1:10:27] accept that. And I I I want to, you
[1:10:29] know, I want to see God do something,
[1:10:31] God, to judge them. My brother and
[1:10:32] sister, just judge yourself. Amen. Judge
[1:10:35] yourself before God with a clean heart,
[1:10:38] a conscience, and let God commit them to
[1:10:41] God. God will hear your prayer.
[1:10:44] Amen.
[1:10:45] He will, won't he?
[1:10:46] He hears our prayers. He promised that
[1:10:48] he would. So, here it is. These are the
[1:10:51] signs. You wonder why I'm going down
[1:10:53] this road. These are the signs of sons
[1:10:56] and daughters of God coming into
[1:10:58] adoption.
[1:11:00] You see, we can't say we've been adopted
[1:11:02] and have his spirit and still have
[1:11:05] bitterness and envy and strife and chaos
[1:11:07] in our life. Amen. I'm talking about uh
[1:11:10] uh internal chaos, not external chaos.
[1:11:13] Amen. We can't say that we have the
[1:11:16] spirit of Christ and we have envys and
[1:11:19] strifees.
[1:11:20] Amen. We got to come to the place that
[1:11:22] we say, you know what? I I'm going to
[1:11:25] I'm going to This sounds selfish. It
[1:11:27] sounds really selfish. I'm sorry it
[1:11:28] sounds selfish, but I'm going to start
[1:11:30] by taking care of me.
[1:11:33] And when I get me washed and under the
[1:11:35] blood of Jesus Christ, I'm going to then
[1:11:37] start praying. Amen. You know, let me
[1:11:39] tell you, uh you know, sometimes the
[1:11:41] Lord anoints you. One time a sister down
[1:11:44] in Chile, she come and she says,
[1:11:45] "Brother Paul, I I need you to pray that
[1:11:49] uh my my son, you know, that the Lord
[1:11:52] would just show his love to him and and
[1:11:55] just draw him in. He's he's backsliding.
[1:11:57] he's going out to the world and all of
[1:12:00] this stuff and and she's telling me
[1:12:02] she's she's actually dictating the
[1:12:04] prayer to me and and pray that God would
[1:12:07] talk to him like this and pray that God
[1:12:09] would do this and pray that God would do
[1:12:11] that. When she's all done, I looked at
[1:12:13] her and said, "Sister, I'll pray that
[1:12:16] God just makes your son so miserable."
[1:12:19] No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:12:23] You want him saved or not?
[1:12:26] What you're wanting to do is have God
[1:12:29] lavish
[1:12:30] Yeah.
[1:12:31] this upon your child.
[1:12:34] Why don't you just get serious and say,
[1:12:36] "You know what, husband, wife, son,
[1:12:39] daughter, whatever it might be,
[1:12:41] Lord, just let them be so miserable."
[1:12:44] Yes, sir.
[1:12:45] That they come to a place they realize
[1:12:46] only one can fix me.
[1:12:48] Amen.
[1:12:49] Only one can change my world,
[1:12:52] and that's you, Lord.
[1:12:53] That's right. Amen.
[1:12:54] But as long as, catch my point, we're
[1:12:57] trying to dictate to God
[1:13:00] for him to save them.
[1:13:02] Exactly.
[1:13:02] Like this.
[1:13:04] Amen.
[1:13:05] You're still holding on.
[1:13:08] You're the one that still thinks you
[1:13:09] have enough control.
[1:13:11] Amen.
[1:13:12] To tell God, "This is how you need to do
[1:13:14] your plan." He's the one who wrote the
[1:13:17] plan of redemption. Amen. He's the one
[1:13:19] who implemented salvation. He's the one
[1:13:22] that did the calling. He's the one that
[1:13:23] made the seed, planted the seed, watered
[1:13:26] the seed, and brought the seed to life.
[1:13:28] And we're trying to tell him, don't put
[1:13:29] that flower in the crack of the
[1:13:31] sidewalk. Put the flower over here in
[1:13:34] this well-prepared uh garden space or
[1:13:37] this deal right here on the house.
[1:13:39] That's where the flower belongs. But God
[1:13:41] chose to put the flower in the crack of
[1:13:43] the sidewalk. But he also made it
[1:13:45] possible for that flower to flourish.
[1:13:48] Amen.
[1:13:48] Amen. Don't blame God or anyone else for
[1:13:52] your circumstance
[1:13:54] if you haven't gave your circumstance to
[1:13:57] him.
[1:13:57] Amen. That's exactly
[1:13:59] got no right to complain.
[1:14:06] Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not
[1:14:08] to the flesh to live after the flesh.
[1:14:10] For if you live after the flesh, you
[1:14:12] shall die. But if ye through the spirit
[1:14:14] do mortify the deeds of the body, ye
[1:14:16] shall live. For as many and I
[1:14:19] highlighted this in my notes. For as
[1:14:21] many as are led by the spirit of God,
[1:14:24] they are the sons of God.
[1:14:26] Amen.
[1:14:26] Let Lord, I just ask you. I lift a hand
[1:14:28] this morning. Lord, lead me.
[1:14:30] Amen.
[1:14:30] Amen. I believe I'm a son of God. Lord,
[1:14:33] lead me.
[1:14:33] Amen.
[1:14:34] Amen. For you have not received the
[1:14:36] spirit of bondage.
[1:14:38] That's right.
[1:14:39] Now, my brother and sister, as I want to
[1:14:41] emphasize on this, this spirit of
[1:14:43] bondage can be many things. We would see
[1:14:45] someone who's a drug addict and we'd say
[1:14:47] they're in bondage. We someone who's an
[1:14:49] alcoholic, they're in bondage. We we see
[1:14:52] people that different things in their
[1:14:53] life that control their life, we say
[1:14:56] they're in bondage. But my brother and
[1:14:57] sister, we can also come and find
[1:15:00] ourselves in a spiritual bondage. Amen.
[1:15:02] And you know, if we're thinking it's by
[1:15:04] our works that we are going to gain
[1:15:06] heaven, you're in a bondage. Amen. If
[1:15:09] you think that you are never going to be
[1:15:12] worthy of the gospel, you are actually
[1:15:14] in bondage. Amen. But to come to a
[1:15:17] position to recognize that you are in
[1:15:20] adoption. In other words, when God
[1:15:23] called you and said, "I want to make you
[1:15:25] a son or a daughter." Amen. That he has
[1:15:28] made a way for you. You are not now in
[1:15:31] bondage. Now, I want you to hear me.
[1:15:33] Hear me well so you don't misunderstand.
[1:15:35] If you think that God's bringing you
[1:15:37] into adoption because he felt I already
[1:15:39] hit on this earlier because he felt
[1:15:42] sorry for you, you are mistaken and you
[1:15:44] are in a deeper bondage than you
[1:15:46] recognize. It is nothing but the grace
[1:15:50] of God that he said, "I chose you and I
[1:15:54] want to call you by my name and I want
[1:15:57] to make you a son or daughter and I'm
[1:16:00] going to do this at my expense." and
[1:16:03] know you can never do enough to earn
[1:16:07] this. But if you will just allow me to
[1:16:10] work through you, in other words, let me
[1:16:12] give you my name.
[1:16:16] And when we receive his name without
[1:16:20] prejudice,
[1:16:21] you will not be adopted into bondage.
[1:16:25] You will be adopted into liberty. Amen.
[1:16:29] Now, this young woman I was telling you
[1:16:30] about the article I read, she said that
[1:16:33] there was things in her childhood and
[1:16:35] she recognized later her adoptive
[1:16:37] parents had never met ill by this, but
[1:16:40] you know uh they they uh would make
[1:16:42] little statements when she was young
[1:16:44] girl after she had found out she was
[1:16:46] adopted that you know we adopted you so
[1:16:48] you would have a better life.
[1:16:51] And she said, "I always resented that
[1:16:53] because they had no idea what life I
[1:16:55] would have had if I stayed
[1:16:58] in the beginning,
[1:16:58] right?
[1:17:00] And she said, "I I resented that, but
[1:17:02] when I became a Christian, I started to
[1:17:05] really understand what they were talking
[1:17:07] about because you see, there was
[1:17:09] evidence that the other life would have
[1:17:13] not been a good life." Amen.
[1:17:16] And we as sons and daughters of God have
[1:17:18] a great amount, a great host of witness
[1:17:21] of evidence that our life before
[1:17:24] adoption was not a good life. But after
[1:17:28] adoption, we realize that we have been
[1:17:30] loved and we have been cherished and we
[1:17:33] have been brought into a place to to
[1:17:35] grow and to be nurtured. And she made
[1:17:38] this uh statement. She said, "I never
[1:17:41] understood that until I had my first
[1:17:45] child."
[1:17:47] And then suddenly,
[1:17:49] she said, "I I I have a baby. I'm going
[1:17:52] to have a baby. I'm going to have a
[1:17:54] baby."
[1:17:55] But when that baby was born,
[1:17:59] something she said, just like turned
[1:18:01] over in her heart
[1:18:06] and it really soaked in
[1:18:09] when she looked at the birth certificate
[1:18:11] the first time
[1:18:14] and it completely identified this child
[1:18:18] with her and her husband.
[1:18:22] Maybe we need to find our birth
[1:18:24] certificate in Jesus Christ and look at
[1:18:26] it and recognize it doesn't say that we
[1:18:32] grudgingly were accepted
[1:18:35] but we were claimed and called into the
[1:18:39] family
[1:18:41] not to be condemned to be part of the
[1:18:43] family but you see to give us liberty.
[1:18:47] We've not received a spirit of bondage
[1:18:49] again to fear, but you have received the
[1:18:51] spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Aba,
[1:18:55] Father." And that interpreted is my
[1:18:58] father. My father, amen. The spirit
[1:19:01] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[1:19:04] that we are the children of God. I'm
[1:19:07] telling you, my brother and sister,
[1:19:08] isn't it beautiful in the day that we
[1:19:10] live how that God has so come, I don't
[1:19:12] get up in the morning and say, "Should I
[1:19:14] be a son of God? Can I be a son of God?
[1:19:17] I get up in the morning and I say,
[1:19:18] "Thank you, Lord. I am a son of God."
[1:19:21] Amen. I I'm not hoping to be. If
[1:19:24] everything goes right, I can be. But he
[1:19:27] chose me because he knew who I was from
[1:19:30] the very beginning. He knows who you are
[1:19:32] from the very beginning.
[1:19:35] We are the children. And if children,
[1:19:38] then heirs. Heirs of God and joint airs
[1:19:42] with Christ. If so be that we suffer
[1:19:44] with him, that we may be also glorified
[1:19:47] together.
[1:19:48] Isn't that beautiful?
[1:19:49] Amen. Now, look, there's something in
[1:19:52] us, and I'm just preaching from my
[1:19:54] heart, okay? Just But look at this.
[1:19:55] There's something in us that's always
[1:19:57] yearning for more. I I since I was a
[1:19:59] little boy, I've always had something
[1:20:01] that just yearned and yearned and
[1:20:03] yearned and yearned. I was raised, you
[1:20:05] know, how I was raised. We'll just leave
[1:20:07] it like that. Amen. and and you know it
[1:20:10] was there but there was always something
[1:20:11] that just wanted a little something more
[1:20:13] something different and I never could
[1:20:15] identify it. Amen. There was a time in
[1:20:17] my life I had plenty of money. Those of
[1:20:19] you that know my my story, you know,
[1:20:21] here I am living like a homeless person
[1:20:23] in the in the southwest and I had
[1:20:26] thousands of dollars under the pickup of
[1:20:27] my seat and somebody say they're
[1:20:29] building condos over here in Timbuktu
[1:20:32] and I would run over there and go to
[1:20:33] work because I thought ah maybe there'll
[1:20:35] be just something about this job that'll
[1:20:37] make a difference. And when I go out
[1:20:38] there earning good wages for the time
[1:20:40] and the season and it would be there and
[1:20:43] I would still go sleep in my pickup
[1:20:47] because I
[1:20:49] worshiped money one that's hard to
[1:20:51] confess.
[1:20:53] I was like I'd rather sleep in my pickup
[1:20:55] than spend this money. Rent an
[1:20:57] apartment. What a waste of money.
[1:20:59] Because I'll never be there.
[1:21:02] Because I'll be off searching for
[1:21:05] something to make me happy.
[1:21:12] Yeah, I could get off into the weeds,
[1:21:17] something yearning for something more.
[1:21:23] But God come and he says, "What I've got
[1:21:24] is a foretaste for you."
[1:21:26] That's right. this glorious life, all
[1:21:30] that I have done for you is nothing but
[1:21:33] a foretaste. Now, this actually hurts me
[1:21:36] because it's been used against me. But,
[1:21:38] you know, they have proven that the um
[1:21:42] first two or three bites of ice cream is
[1:21:46] the maximum sensory
[1:21:49] that you will have. All the rest of it
[1:21:52] is just repetitive motion seeking to get
[1:21:56] that very first euphoric taste of what?
[1:22:00] The sugar.
[1:22:05] You ever ate sugar-free ice cream?
[1:22:09] Does it compare?
[1:22:11] Not even close. So, what's the
[1:22:13] difference? The sugar.
[1:22:17] Amen. And Satan wants to sugar
[1:22:19] everything in our life that we will
[1:22:22] pursue that. But you see God come and
[1:22:24] says, "I'm not going to sugar you. I'm
[1:22:25] not going to, you know, rub you the
[1:22:27] right way." Right? The old parable of
[1:22:29] the cat, you know, as long as you stroke
[1:22:30] him the right direction, everything will
[1:22:32] be fine. I'm not going to do that for
[1:22:34] you. But what I'm going to do is put a
[1:22:35] hunger in your heart and I'm going to
[1:22:37] leave you in a condition where where you
[1:22:39] say, you know what, there's just nothing
[1:22:41] satisfies like this.
[1:22:44] Amen. The foretaste gives us a desire
[1:22:47] for more. The manifestation, what is it,
[1:22:50] my brother and sister? This is not just
[1:22:51] about being a Christian. There's
[1:22:53] millions of Christians that only
[1:22:55] half-heartedly go to church to serve
[1:22:56] God. But my brother and sister, I don't
[1:22:58] want to be one of those. Amen. I want to
[1:23:01] come and be a manifestation of what the
[1:23:04] word has declared we will be. And I just
[1:23:07] gave you a few glimpses of that. You see
[1:23:09] this manifestation is us coming not into
[1:23:13] into just an adoption but our goal is
[1:23:16] full adoption. Now look here in the
[1:23:19] quote Revelation chapter 5 part one
[1:23:23] we'll look at this. Oh do you see it
[1:23:26] all creation is groaning said Paul
[1:23:29] everything is groaning. Look at the
[1:23:31] trees how they struggle. Look at the
[1:23:33] flowers how they struggle for life uh
[1:23:35] just for the frost to tear them down.
[1:23:37] Look at the trees. How they struggle to
[1:23:39] hold their branches out to sing glories
[1:23:42] into God's sea. Everything, all nature,
[1:23:44] all animals, all birds. How he flies
[1:23:46] from the enemy quickly and gets away.
[1:23:48] Everything groaning. And we ourselves,
[1:23:51] said Paul, we groan too with them. For
[1:23:53] we are waiting for the redemption of our
[1:23:57] body.
[1:23:58] But now, now they did all those years
[1:24:01] until now. Now we have the earnest of
[1:24:04] our inheritance. Oh my. What do we have?
[1:24:07] We have the evidence that God lives.
[1:24:10] Now, people would say, "Well, they've
[1:24:11] had evidence through the ages." But God
[1:24:13] wanted you to have the evidence. God
[1:24:15] wanted you to be able to say, "I know
[1:24:17] that Christ in me." Amen. I know that I
[1:24:20] have a hope. Amen. I know this that you
[1:24:23] personally not looking to the preacher
[1:24:25] and say, "Man, our preacher is a godly,
[1:24:27] Holy Ghostfilled man. He's going to make
[1:24:29] a rapture. What about you?"
[1:24:31] Amen. God wants you to see that this was
[1:24:34] all meant for you. Amen. That brings you
[1:24:38] into this place where you're able to
[1:24:40] say, "Praise God. I'm a child of God.
[1:24:44] Praise God. I'm a son." Amen. Amen. Now,
[1:24:48] look at this. Look at this. We have the
[1:24:51] evidence that God lives. We have the
[1:24:53] evidence that God is with us. And I hope
[1:24:55] you can lift a hand and say amen to
[1:24:57] that. We have evidence that God has not
[1:24:59] forsaken us. that we are his and he are
[1:25:01] I uh and he is ours because we in our
[1:25:05] bodies uh now tabernacle the holy spirit
[1:25:08] of god that cries aba father
[1:25:12] my father
[1:25:13] my father
[1:25:14] amen
[1:25:14] thank you lord for your blessings today
[1:25:17] you know so I've shared this with the
[1:25:18] church I think or anyway maybe it was at
[1:25:21] communion time but Jerry and I was
[1:25:24] coming down orchard one day to church on
[1:25:26] a Sunday morning and uh I I know that
[1:25:29] the people It was just a man and his
[1:25:30] wife and and I don't believe there was
[1:25:33] any intent to to just cut us off on the
[1:25:35] road. But uh it was just the grace of
[1:25:38] God. He just pulls off the road right
[1:25:42] out in front of us and I swerve to the
[1:25:45] right and you know it's pretty close
[1:25:48] when his wife's face is about right
[1:25:50] here.
[1:25:53] My brother and sister. Oh, I was spared
[1:25:57] from being in an accident.
[1:25:59] It's deeper than that. You see, God
[1:26:02] cares enough about us.
[1:26:05] He spares us, but he also spared them.
[1:26:08] And they were dressed up. Look like they
[1:26:10] were probably going to church. Amen. You
[1:26:13] imagine how I would feel today if we had
[1:26:16] struck her car, their car in the door.
[1:26:19] It probably would have killed the lady.
[1:26:21] And I would be under this burden all
[1:26:23] these days of I was in an accident that
[1:26:25] killed a lady. But you see, God rich in
[1:26:28] mercy comes down in every aspect of our
[1:26:32] life. And we say, "Wow, you were lucky.
[1:26:34] I don't believe in luck."
[1:26:35] I'm sorry, my brother and sister. I am
[1:26:37] blessed, but I am not lucky.
[1:26:39] Amen. Now, you look at that and realize
[1:26:42] what God's doing. He's coming down
[1:26:44] giving us a earnest of our inheritance
[1:26:48] that he's there with us. Amen. Guiding
[1:26:51] us, got his hand on our life in every
[1:26:54] situation. And we'll find that if we
[1:26:57] will trust him and commit to him, we'll
[1:26:59] start to realize that he is there
[1:27:02] present. Amen. We have evidence God's
[1:27:04] with us. He has not forsaken us. We are
[1:27:07] his. He is ours. Because in our bodies,
[1:27:09] we now tabernacle the Holy Spirit of
[1:27:11] God. Holy Spirit's not just in the
[1:27:13] church. It's in you.
[1:27:15] Amen. It's not just here that we come
[1:27:17] brush shoulders with God a little bit,
[1:27:20] my brother and sister. We get to take
[1:27:21] him everywhere we go. Amen. and he gets
[1:27:24] to be our constant companion. And in
[1:27:26] that realm right there, we start to
[1:27:28] realize this is only a foretaste.
[1:27:34] What will it be to receive the full
[1:27:37] adoption?
[1:27:39] Now, we're anchored in Christ. Now, the
[1:27:42] trees do not have it. Nature doesn't
[1:27:44] have it. But yet, we are still groaning
[1:27:46] with them because as yet we haven't
[1:27:48] received the fullness of our adoption.
[1:27:53] I've heard it preached and people say,
[1:27:55] "Praise God, we're we have the absolute
[1:27:57] fullness of but this isn't correct
[1:28:01] because we look at this. We have the
[1:28:03] earnest of it that we were picked from
[1:28:06] the things of the world and now become
[1:28:08] sons and daughters of God." What kind of
[1:28:10] people should we be? Oh my, when we
[1:28:13] think of that, think of it.
[1:28:14] Amen.
[1:28:15] Full adoption, my brother and sister, is
[1:28:17] a translation of this body.
[1:28:20] Amen. the full uh resurrection,
[1:28:23] rapturing of this body is the full
[1:28:26] adoption. But you see, God's given us
[1:28:29] now when we talk about foretaste.
[1:28:31] Have you ever noticed? Any of you, you
[1:28:34] know, I I'm slowly breaking my habit,
[1:28:36] but you know, if you go down to
[1:28:37] Stella's, you know what? Do you guys
[1:28:40] know who Stella is?
[1:28:43] Stella's the really nice grandmother
[1:28:44] lady that has ice cream just down the
[1:28:46] street here.
[1:28:49] But you go to Stellas and I tested this
[1:28:52] theory. I had a guy tell me one day, "Do
[1:28:54] you eat a Stella?" And I said, "Yeah."
[1:28:55] The wife and I every once in a while, he
[1:28:57] said, "Did you know that you can ask for
[1:29:01] that little spoon for a taste of every
[1:29:06] single ice cream in that cabinet?" And
[1:29:09] they won't say no. And he said, "After
[1:29:12] you've tasted every one of those, you're
[1:29:14] full."
[1:29:17] Are you with me? Did you catch the
[1:29:20] point?
[1:29:21] Amen. We've been given a foretaste. We
[1:29:23] can take a sample here. Lord, I need
[1:29:26] healing. He gives healing. Lord, I need
[1:29:28] provision. He gives provision. Lord, I
[1:29:31] need more love in my life. He gives us
[1:29:32] more love in our life. I need this.
[1:29:34] Lord, I need this. And he just keeps
[1:29:36] scooping the little spoon. And when we
[1:29:38] get all done, we're like, man, I am
[1:29:40] full. Praise God. But my brother and
[1:29:43] sister, we are just like we would be in
[1:29:45] the natural. I don't know that any one
[1:29:47] of us today would walk into Stella's and
[1:29:50] say, "You know what, ladies? I want to
[1:29:51] taste every single one of these ice
[1:29:53] creams and I'll get out that exit door
[1:29:56] without buying a single bite.
[1:30:00] We won't do that."
[1:30:02] But the sad thing is we don't do it in
[1:30:04] the spiritual realm either.
[1:30:08] God's saying, "Here,
[1:30:09] yeah,
[1:30:09] taste of it. It's good."
[1:30:12] Don't take this man for an example.
[1:30:15] Don't take that man for well Christians
[1:30:17] are hypocrites. Maybe you did meet a
[1:30:20] hypocrite, but maybe he wasn't even a
[1:30:23] Christian,
[1:30:24] right?
[1:30:25] You guys know what a chino is, don't
[1:30:26] you?
[1:30:30] Christian in name only.
[1:30:34] I don't want to be a chino.
[1:30:36] Right? You know what that comes from? I
[1:30:39] I've been speaking this chino for years
[1:30:41] and years and years. Finally heard
[1:30:42] someone else say it. But Chino come from
[1:30:46] Rhino which was a Republican you know
[1:30:48] politicians a Republican in name only.
[1:30:51] So they call themselves a Republican and
[1:30:52] they act like whatever. And one day it
[1:30:55] struck me I thought that's it
[1:30:59] a Christian in name only.
[1:31:04] So they don't act like a Christian
[1:31:07] don't behave. Don't live.
[1:31:11] I don't want to be a chino. I want to be
[1:31:14] the real thing.
[1:31:15] Amen.
[1:31:15] I mean, why would you want to be a rhino
[1:31:18] and vote like a Democrat? Hope there's
[1:31:20] no Democrats here this morning.
[1:31:24] See, why would you even want to identify
[1:31:26] here
[1:31:28] when you're really this here?
[1:31:31] Amen.
[1:31:32] I want to identify as a Christian. I
[1:31:33] want to be a Christian. In fact, let me
[1:31:35] go one step further. I am a Christian.
[1:31:39] I do make mistakes
[1:31:41] but I will by God's grace correct those
[1:31:44] and move on.
[1:31:46] It won't become my identity.
[1:31:50] Okay. Now where was I? Have evidence
[1:31:52] God's not forsaken us. We're his because
[1:31:54] in our body now tabernacle holy spirit
[1:31:56] of God that cries out aba father.
[1:31:59] There's nothing can ever take that away.
[1:32:01] We're anchored in Christ. Now the trees
[1:32:05] don't have it. Nature doesn't have it.
[1:32:06] But you're still groaning with them
[1:32:08] because you haven't received the
[1:32:09] fullness of our adoption. But we have
[1:32:11] the earnest of it that we were picked up
[1:32:14] from the things of the world and now
[1:32:17] become sons and daughters of God. What
[1:32:20] kind of people should we be?
[1:32:22] If we're a son or daughter of God, we're
[1:32:24] going to act like our father.
[1:32:26] Amen. We won't we won't act like the
[1:32:28] devil. Amen. You know, uh people
[1:32:31] struggle. You know, I I've read their
[1:32:33] commentaries. People struggle. You know,
[1:32:35] well, why would Jesus tell the those
[1:32:38] Sadducees, Pharisees, those religious
[1:32:40] men, you're of your father, the devil?
[1:32:43] Because you see, beyond their words, he
[1:32:45] saw the action. He saw the real heart of
[1:32:49] what it was. And there was not one thing
[1:32:53] that they had that was displaying
[1:32:57] the real them. They were chinos,
[1:33:03] ginos, Jews in name only. Whatever
[1:33:09] Jesus recognized that you're of your
[1:33:12] father, the devil. In other words,
[1:33:13] really what was going on down inside was
[1:33:16] they were determined to disprove the
[1:33:19] word of God.
[1:33:23] My oh my. Now look at this. I'm going to
[1:33:26] keep going here. time is so fleeting.
[1:33:30] Romans 8 talks about how that we're led
[1:33:33] of the spirit or sons of God. We've
[1:33:36] cried uh we have not received the spirit
[1:33:38] of bondage again to fear but have
[1:33:40] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:33:43] we cry aba father right I'm free father
[1:33:48] thank you I'm free you see my brother
[1:33:51] and sister we've got to see clearly
[1:33:53] enough who we are and you'd say well
[1:33:56] okay um I I know I'm a Christian I'm a
[1:33:59] Christian I'm saved you know we can say
[1:34:01] oh my father my father but look at this
[1:34:04] my Brother and sister, when we recognize
[1:34:07] who we are, we will also recognize what
[1:34:11] God has in store for us. And that's not,
[1:34:15] oh, riches, you know, prosperity gospel.
[1:34:18] It's not this, it's not that, my brother
[1:34:20] and sister, our Lord Jesus, we're going
[1:34:22] to have his spirit, his nature, his
[1:34:24] attributes, and look what he went
[1:34:27] through.
[1:34:28] and we go through the smallest of trials
[1:34:31] and we throw our hands up and we give
[1:34:34] up.
[1:34:36] Is that
[1:34:37] the spirit of our father?
[1:34:41] No. No. You see, what we've got to do is
[1:34:44] come to the place that we recognize
[1:34:48] who we are.
[1:34:49] Amen.
[1:34:51] even to the point as it was in the dark
[1:34:53] ages, they had a revelation for their
[1:34:56] day and they recognized, you know what,
[1:34:59] we're Christians. We're believers. And
[1:35:01] if it means that we die like our Lord
[1:35:03] Jesus, so be it.
[1:35:07] You read the history, it's shocking.
[1:35:10] Mothers, the babies cut from their
[1:35:13] bellies and then turned loose to the
[1:35:16] wild animals.
[1:35:18] shocking, horrific things.
[1:35:22] If you could ask them right now, do you
[1:35:23] regret doing that? What is their answer?
[1:35:27] No. I recognized
[1:35:29] who I was then and I realized if this is
[1:35:33] what God called me to, I can do it.
[1:35:39] I can do it. What will be our excuse if
[1:35:43] we offer one? to stand before those
[1:35:46] saints of old of the coliseums
[1:35:49] and that and what are we going to offer
[1:35:51] for them? They're going to look at it
[1:35:53] and say, "Oh, are you see of the chosen
[1:35:57] generation that God pampered
[1:36:02] that God allowed you every shortcut
[1:36:06] that God made it easy for you?"
[1:36:09] No sir, our battle is not of flesh and
[1:36:11] blood. Our battle is a spiritual battle.
[1:36:14] Amen. Amen. I'm going to go ahead and
[1:36:17] cut this a little short. Time has got
[1:36:19] away from me. But we have to recognize,
[1:36:24] my brother and sister, you have to see
[1:36:27] who you are to see God's promise for
[1:36:30] you. If you don't see who you are,
[1:36:34] you'll never see the fullness of his
[1:36:36] promise to you. Yeah.
[1:36:40] Reminds me of a family that I know
[1:36:43] pretty well.
[1:36:45] There was one of the sons
[1:36:48] spent his whole life
[1:36:50] mooching off of his parents. I mean,
[1:36:54] serious level mooching. Always had a
[1:36:57] soba story.
[1:37:00] The parents pass away and they're at the
[1:37:02] reading of the will
[1:37:04] and they're reading the names of the
[1:37:06] siblings.
[1:37:08] And to this son, I leave this. To this
[1:37:11] daughter, I leave this. To this son, I
[1:37:14] leave this.
[1:37:16] To this son, I leave this. To Edward,
[1:37:21] you already got yours.
[1:37:30] Shocking, isn't it? Sounds like a harsh
[1:37:32] parent or one that finally called
[1:37:35] someone to reality. But I want you to
[1:37:38] understand our inheritance in Jesus
[1:37:41] Christ.
[1:37:43] We get portions of our inheritance now.
[1:37:50] And we also get portions of our
[1:37:53] inheritance
[1:37:56] in eternity.
[1:38:00] Why? Because we are sons and daughters
[1:38:04] of God.
[1:38:05] Amen. We'll have to make this a part
[1:38:07] two. I've still got probably four pages.
[1:38:10] Amen. Ruth, Sister Ruth, if you would
[1:38:13] come.
[1:38:16] So, just pray for brother Paul.
[1:38:19] See, you have to see yourself to see the
[1:38:21] promise. Now, let me just touch on this
[1:38:24] adoption real quick.
[1:38:28] Adoption
[1:38:30] is not of an unwanted child. talking
[1:38:33] about those doing the adopting.
[1:38:36] But we'll understand scripturally
[1:38:39] it was one of maturity. The adoption
[1:38:41] that took place in in scripture was not
[1:38:44] a baby.
[1:38:46] This was adoption was of a mature man
[1:38:50] who was able then having showed his
[1:38:53] father
[1:38:55] that he is willing and able to perform
[1:39:00] to the work of his father.
[1:39:04] So when we are called unto adoption,
[1:39:06] God's not calling babies.
[1:39:09] He's calling mature sons and daughters
[1:39:10] of God that we would stand up and say,
[1:39:12] "Lord, I'm ready. I'm ready to live your
[1:39:15] gospel. I'm ready to live the life. I'm
[1:39:17] ready to do the work that you would call
[1:39:19] me to. Amen. Now, any son, now I've got
[1:39:23] an emphasis here. A parenthesis, I wrote
[1:39:25] sheep.
[1:39:27] Any son coming into full adoption knows
[1:39:30] the will of his father. Yes, sir.
[1:39:33] The father does not hand him the
[1:39:35] checkbook if his son is going to go.
[1:39:38] Now, I'm a farmer. Now look, look, my
[1:39:41] dear friend Cody,
[1:39:44] here's a young man has a desire to farm.
[1:39:48] I wouldn't say that there's nothing
[1:39:50] there for him to inherit,
[1:39:52] but
[1:39:54] Cody's not going to wait till he's got
[1:39:56] an inheritance to become a farmer.
[1:39:59] I hope you follow me. Sorry for using
[1:40:02] your example, Cody.
[1:40:04] Cody knows who he is
[1:40:07] and he's already moving forward to be
[1:40:10] who he knows he is.
[1:40:14] Will there be an inheritance? Well, I
[1:40:15] guess so. Unless mom and dad have bought
[1:40:17] a motor home and put the bumper sticker
[1:40:19] on it that says I'm spending my
[1:40:21] children's inheritance.
[1:40:23] But you see, he's not saying when I
[1:40:26] inherit,
[1:40:28] when I inherit,
[1:40:31] when the rapture comes, when we're all
[1:40:34] in heaven. No, sir. A son that's mature
[1:40:38] enough to be called into adoption says,
[1:40:41] "I already know the mind of my father,
[1:40:45] and I am actually going to demonstrate
[1:40:47] to my father I can live out his will for
[1:40:52] my life. and we stand upon that and we
[1:40:56] step into it. We claim it and then we
[1:40:59] manifest it.
[1:41:01] We're not called to be wishful thinkers.
[1:41:05] Amen.
[1:41:06] Hallelujah.
[1:41:08] Do you know one last little thing? Hope
[1:41:11] you don't mind, but in my mind, there's
[1:41:12] a little point here.
[1:41:15] You know, we don't want to be those
[1:41:17] children that are the waiters.
[1:41:23] You know what a waiter is, don't you? A
[1:41:25] child in the family that's a waiter. No,
[1:41:27] that's not a guy in the restaurant that
[1:41:28] serves food. He's the one who's just
[1:41:31] waiting for his parents to die.
[1:41:34] He's a waiter.
[1:41:36] We're not waiters.
[1:41:39] We were called to live the fullness of
[1:41:42] the gospel.
[1:41:44] Live it out now.
[1:41:45] Amen.
[1:41:45] Because our father has showed us who we
[1:41:48] are
[1:41:49] today. Amen. God bless you. Hallelujah.
[1:41:53] Get too carried away here. I have quite
[1:41:55] a bit more. Amen.
[1:41:58] But once again,
[1:42:02] a son coming into adoption knows the
[1:42:05] will of his father.
[1:42:08] Hallelujah.
[1:42:10] Man, the rest of this is just nice. But
[1:42:14] let's just stand. Let's sing 331.
[1:42:18] [Music]
[1:42:22] I hope you can just sing this from your
[1:42:24] heart. Amen. Just to realize that the
[1:42:28] Lord has called each one of us and he's
[1:42:30] wanting to bring us to an understanding
[1:42:33] of who we are. That we are he's given us
[1:42:36] the power to become sons and daughters
[1:42:39] of God. Will we accept that power? You
[1:42:43] see, this is one of the first displays
[1:42:46] of power
[1:42:48] that God would put in our life. He's
[1:42:50] given us the power.
[1:42:52] Now, Brother Brandham explained it to us
[1:42:56] that we can't just go out here on our
[1:42:58] own
[1:43:01] and do this.
[1:43:04] But the word comes and says, we've been
[1:43:06] given the power to become.
[1:43:08] That's right.
[1:43:08] You know what that power is? It's the
[1:43:10] power to loose Jesus Christ in your life
[1:43:14] as a son, as a daughter,
[1:43:18] not as a slave, not as a servant.
[1:43:22] Oh, cause me
[1:43:25] to come
[1:43:27] to thy river,
[1:43:31] oh Lord.
[1:43:33] [Music]
[1:43:34] Cause me
[1:43:37] to come
[1:43:39] to thy river,
[1:43:43] oh Lord.
[1:43:47] Cause me to come
[1:43:51] to thy river,
[1:43:55] oh Lord.
[1:43:59] Cause me to come.
[1:44:04] Cause me to dream.
[1:44:09] Cause me
[1:44:12] to live.
[1:44:17] Oh, cause me to drink
[1:44:22] at thy river,
[1:44:26] O Lord.
[1:44:29] Oh, cause me to drink
[1:44:34] at thy river,
[1:44:37] oh Lord.
[1:44:40] Cause me to drink
[1:44:45] at thy river,
[1:44:48] oh Lord.
[1:44:51] Oh, cause me to come.
[1:44:56] Cause me to drink.
[1:45:02] Cause me
[1:45:05] to live.
[1:45:08] Oh, cause me
[1:45:11] to live
[1:45:13] in thy presence,
[1:45:17] oh Lord. Let that be your heart's
[1:45:19] desire.
[1:45:20] cause me to live
[1:45:24] oh in thy presence.
[1:45:28] Oh Lord,
[1:45:31] cause me to live
[1:45:36] in thy presence.
[1:45:39] Oh Lord,
[1:45:42] cause me to come.
[1:45:48] Cause me to drink.
[1:45:53] Cause me
[1:45:56] to live.
[1:46:02] You know, I just say this morning, there
[1:46:04] be anyone here that
[1:46:08] Satan's been beating on you enough to
[1:46:10] cause you to question your calling.
[1:46:13] Cause you to not recognize who you are
[1:46:16] in Jesus Christ.
[1:46:20] Just lift your hand, lift your heart
[1:46:22] before the Lord and say, "Lord,
[1:46:25] speak to me. Give me that reassurance.
[1:46:31] I'm here, Lord, because I desire
[1:46:35] adoption.
[1:46:37] I want to come to a full adoption, to
[1:46:39] live in your presence.
[1:46:41] I want to live your word. I I don't want
[1:46:44] the petty things of this life that keep
[1:46:46] distracting me. I don't want them to be
[1:46:49] controlling my life any longer. But
[1:46:51] Lord, help me. Lord, you've promised it
[1:46:55] to us and we receive that promise and we
[1:46:58] now identify ourselves as sons and
[1:47:02] daughters of God because without that
[1:47:05] identity, Lord, we recognize we cannot
[1:47:08] unleash the promise.
[1:47:11] Father, we claim that this morning,
[1:47:13] Lord, I would just ask you to come touch
[1:47:15] each one of us, Lord, today. Help us to
[1:47:18] see truly who we are. We're not just
[1:47:22] Christians trying to live, but truly
[1:47:25] we've come into adoption. We've been
[1:47:27] chosen specifically by you for this
[1:47:31] position. Lord, touch each heart. Touch
[1:47:34] each life. Let it be real. I pray as you
[1:47:39] draw us into your presence. Lord, we're
[1:47:41] going one day to receive your name.
[1:47:44] We're going to receive the promise
[1:47:48] to be identified
[1:47:50] as Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[1:47:54] Your bride as the word calls us. Your
[1:47:58] bride
[1:47:59] that you long for.
[1:48:02] You wanted a companion. You wanted
[1:48:04] people to come,
[1:48:06] Lord. You wanted someone,
[1:48:08] Lord, to look to you.
[1:48:12] You wanted someone that would come with
[1:48:15] confidence and say, "Lord, you are my
[1:48:17] provider.
[1:48:19] You're my peace. You're my comforter.
[1:48:23] You're everything to me."
[1:48:25] Just as a husband desires for his wife
[1:48:29] to look to him for security, provision
[1:48:35] to give love and adoration in the human
[1:48:37] element.
[1:48:39] Lord, so we look to you as our
[1:48:41] bridegroom, the Lord Jesus Christ, and
[1:48:44] say, Lord, you are our all and all.
[1:48:47] You're everything we need in this life.
[1:48:50] Satan, as a roaring lion, would desire
[1:48:53] to devour us, but Father, you are our
[1:48:58] sword, our shield, our buckler, our
[1:49:01] security, our peace, and we find comfort
[1:49:04] in your presence.
[1:49:07] Lord, we shouldn't be nervous
[1:49:09] Christians.
[1:49:10] We should be confident Christians.
[1:49:13] For when we are in your presence, Lord,
[1:49:16] and nothing can come,
[1:49:19] Lord. Nothing can come. We stand today,
[1:49:23] Lord, desiring for you to speak to our
[1:49:25] hearts, two hearts today,
[1:49:29] Lord, as we would just look to you. Fill
[1:49:32] us with a confidence that we would come
[1:49:33] boldly before your throne. Your word did
[1:49:37] not call us beggars. It did not tell us
[1:49:40] that we should be afraid for our
[1:49:42] salvation.
[1:49:44] But your word told us to come boldly
[1:49:46] before the throne of grace. I lift a
[1:49:49] hand say Lord help me to come boldly.
[1:49:53] Lord, in my times of trial and struggle,
[1:49:55] my mental battle, Lord, not even the
[1:49:59] physical battle, the mental battle,
[1:50:01] Father, where we would look at ourselves
[1:50:03] and judge ourselves as unworthy,
[1:50:06] unwilling, unable, but Father, your word
[1:50:09] says that we're more than able.
[1:50:12] Lord, we've been called to be
[1:50:14] conquerors.
[1:50:16] Touch us, speak to us, we pray in the
[1:50:18] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:50:21] Hallelujah.
[1:50:23] 10:10
[1:50:25] I worship you almighty God.
[1:50:29] [Music]
[1:50:31] I worship
[1:50:35] you
[1:50:37] almighty
[1:50:39] God.
[1:50:42] There is none like you.
[1:50:49] I worship
[1:50:52] you,
[1:50:54] oh prince of peace.
[1:50:59] That is what I long
[1:51:03] to do.
[1:51:05] I give
[1:51:07] you praise
[1:51:11] for you are my righteousness.
[1:51:18] I worship
[1:51:21] you
[1:51:22] almighty
[1:51:25] God.
[1:51:28] There is none like you. Let's sing it
[1:51:32] again.
[1:51:35] I worship
[1:51:37] you,
[1:51:39] oh mighty
[1:51:41] God.
[1:51:44] Oh, there is none like you.
[1:51:50] I worship
[1:51:53] you,
[1:51:55] oh mind of peace.
[1:52:00] There is what I long
[1:52:04] to do and I will do.
[1:52:08] give you praise
[1:52:12] for you are my rightousness.
[1:52:18] I worship
[1:52:20] you,
[1:52:22] oh mighty
[1:52:25] God.
[1:52:27] There is none like you.
[1:52:33] [Music]
[1:52:35] Amen. 10:14
[1:52:37] we'd sing that. Do we belong to that
[1:52:40] bloodwash band? Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:52:45] [Music]
[1:52:46] We're a band of Christian soldiers
[1:52:50] fighting Satan every day. We're standing
[1:52:54] up for Jesus while we're kneeling down
[1:52:58] to pray. His precious blood has cleansed
[1:53:02] us and washed away your sin. That makes
[1:53:07] you a member of a blood wash band.
[1:53:13] Praise God. I'm a member of a blood wash
[1:53:18] band. I've been washed in the soul
[1:53:22] cleansing blood of the lamb.
[1:53:26] I was bound by chains of sin till one
[1:53:30] day my master came and made me a member
[1:53:36] of a blood wash band.
[1:53:40] God's children are advancing, marching
[1:53:44] till we reach the goal for the battle's
[1:53:48] almost over and we'll soon be going
[1:53:51] home. I can hear the sound of angels as
[1:53:55] the saints go marching in, singing
[1:53:59] praises to the captain of a blood wash
[1:54:03] band.
[1:54:05] Oh, praise God. I'm a member of a blood
[1:54:10] wash band. I've been washed in the soul
[1:54:14] cleansing blood of the lamb.
[1:54:18] Oh, I was bound of chains of sin till
[1:54:22] one day the master came and made me a
[1:54:27] member of the blood wash.
[1:54:32] Oh, praise God. I'm a member of a
[1:54:36] bloodwash band. I've been washed in the
[1:54:40] soul cleansing blood of the lamb.
[1:54:45] I was bound to chains of sin till one
[1:54:49] day master came and made me a member of
[1:54:55] the bloodwash
[1:54:57] band.
[1:54:58] Can we say amen to that? Hallelujah.
[1:55:02] Amen. Part of that bloodwash band. One
[1:55:05] last song before we dismiss. 10:19.
[1:55:09] Amen. God bless you. Amen. You know,
[1:55:13] sometimes you just get to study and I
[1:55:15] think brother David will understand
[1:55:17] this. And you just don't even realize
[1:55:19] just how much. You know, you just kind
[1:55:22] of like the young boy that goes to the
[1:55:24] buffet and his daddy says, "Now, son,
[1:55:26] eat well because it all costs the same."
[1:55:29] So, we're there
[1:55:34] moving right down the line till we got
[1:55:37] there.
[1:55:39] Son, can you eat all that? I love this
[1:55:41] little story. It's a a bigger story. And
[1:55:43] the little boy gets to the deal and the
[1:55:45] dad looks down at all the food that
[1:55:47] son's piled on the plate and he says,
[1:55:49] "Son, can you eat all that?" And he
[1:55:51] goes, "I don't know, Dad, but I can sure
[1:55:54] try."
[1:55:55] Amen. Hallelujah. If death can't can't
[1:56:00] sting us
[1:56:03] and the grave can't hold us.
[1:56:07] If he's already bought us
[1:56:12] back from where sin sold us
[1:56:16] we forgot we were free.
[1:56:21] But he came and he told us
[1:56:25] if death has lost and the grave can win
[1:56:30] and I'm not the slave of sin. Am I not
[1:56:36] already in my victory? Let's sing it
[1:56:41] again. If death can't sing us
[1:56:47] and the grave can't hold us,
[1:56:51] if he's already bought us
[1:56:55] back from where sin sold us,
[1:57:00] we forgot we were free.
[1:57:03] [Music]
[1:57:04] But he came and he told us,
[1:57:09] "If death has lost and the grave can
[1:57:13] win, and I'm not the slave of sin, am I
[1:57:19] not already in my victory?"
[1:57:26] Amen. Shake hands with one another.
[1:57:29] Greet each other with those lovely
[1:57:30] words. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[1:57:35] [Music]
[1:57:55] Hallelujah.
