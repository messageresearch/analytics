understand with our heart we see with our heart just Mike no I'm sorry [Music] I just had something on my heart this morning or thought throughout the day that come to me and then about the afternoon there the Lord just laid just seemed to change so this morning or this evening will be kind of a little different it's going to be somewhat informative but I want to take what the prophet has said in some things in the church age book and maybe bring some clarification to it and something I took here a while back oh well then about a year ago in a series but I didn't I felt that this portion I just wanted to dwell a little bit more on tonight so I'm going to bring different quotes to you so it's going to be kind of like a little study and not so much and I can see because there's so many missing that I just feel that certainly the Lord's will change it and I don't think we'd have been able to do this on a Wednesday the other one anyway because it really gets into a little more time and so if you'll stand with me and we can turn to the Book of Matthew and I want to title this a separation of people at the white Throne judgment there's a separation of people at the white Throne judgment so we're dealing here we're looking at the white Throne judgment I also want to bring in the bride as we go through this to bring them into what they are where they are in this time and how they come to that place so it's have a word of Prayer our precious heavenly father as we bow in your presence we take complete Authority by your spirit over this service and Lord asking you to bless your word Lord and open it to the hearts of your people Lord we are coming here bringing forth a perfect interpretation of the word Lord some things here that will be said Lord through the years have been misinterpreted by theologians and and by by maybe uh footnotes and bibles and the Lord we've had a perfect interpretation by Divine Vindication in this hour for your Prophet said when that which is perfect and the perfect he said Has Come then we have a perfect interpretation we have a way provided we have the way provided for it into a Rapture and Lord we know that the bride will be the one in the Rapture because Lord they possess the Holy Ghost at this time they're the only ones in this earth that do possess the Holy Ghost and father there's many good people there's many people Lord that that will that will arise in the white Throne judgment in fact they're called the righteous they are righteous and there is unrighteous in this judgment Lord as we bow before you now we ask you to bring forth in accordance with your will these things and Lord may I stay focused that it just may be brought Lord as you want it to be and For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Matthew 25 starting with verse 31. so again my my title is a separation of people and this is something the prophet had mentioned in the church age book under the sardisan church age and that's where we're going to be speaking of here this evening is under that sardisan church age and brother Branham says on paragraph 130 30. he says I want you another point to see here in the great white Throne judgment there will be a separation of people the book of life will be opened and another book will be opened and so we have the scriptures and we'll come into that in just a moment that the books were opened and another book which is The Book of Life and so we want to begin reading here and this is kind of a lengthy scripture so I I just have you I'll read it and then you can be seated and we'll go with these other scriptures here as the Lord will help us Matthew 25 31 when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him now this is the scripture that brother Branham right behind what he just what I just read to you began reading this scripture identifying this time to be the uh White Throne judgment now now Scofield and many of them say it is not the white Throne judgment but we had a Prophet come with the word interpretation and I'm glad the interpretation is brought Clarity to the word for us in this hour aren't you amen so when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him and then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations that's tongues people whatever it is it's all nations and he shall separate them one from another now it sounds like he's separating Nations but he's separating people of all Nations and and he shall separate them one from another as not but as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on this right hand but the goats but the goats on his left and I'll I'll just stop here a moment and I want to read something the prophet said he said to further clarify notice specifically the words of Matthew 25 31-46 now this is paragraph 142 page 312 if you're wanting to write these down it does not say that a Shepherd is literally separating sheep from goats but it is as a shepherd dividing dividing sheep from goats these are not sheep in this particular area of time white Throne judgment a particular area is white Throne judgment he said the Sheep are in his fold they heard his voice the word and they followed him they already have eternal life and cannot come into the judgment but these do not have eternal life and they are in the Judgment they are allowed to go into some are allowed to go into and these that we're speaking of there's two gonna we're gonna read of two here in Matthew 25 righteous and unrighteous and and these righteous are allowed to go allowed to go into eternal life all right so begin to finish reading here in verse 33 and he shall set the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was and hungered and you gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you took me in there's something they did okay these are works Now watch how the scripture unfolds itself he said naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous now we know the bride are righteous but this is another class of righteous okay they are righteous that then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord win saw we the hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave the drink when Saul Williams saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothe thee or when saw we the sick or in prison and came unto thee see they didn't know it they weren't even aware of what they did but they had it in their heart let me just say this they had it in their heart to fulfill this scripture yeah amen they had to have that in their heart all right and so and so he and and and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you in so much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren he specifically speaks of these as brother now these Brethren are not those that just read these Brethren are his bride okay and so now let I want to give you understanding here that I am certainly all for good works yes and I think a bride that is full of the Holy Ghost will want to respect another person and do what they can to help that person and give themselves to another because eternal life is living for others but it's not a Works Affair for salvation because the bride already has salvation amen are you with me she's already identified in Christ and especially in this day when the book's been opened see we've had a book opened all right now I just draw I'll just drop that in we've already had a book open yeah all right so and then she'll say and unto the lease of my brother and you have done it if you did it to them you've done it to me why they're one yeah then shall he say unto them on the left hand depart from me you cursed on into Everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for I was hungered and you gave me no meat I was thirsty and you gave me no drink now and I was and they had a choice though they didn't know either what they were doing but and yet in a certain situation they had a choice to make amen these others had choices to me they didn't know why maybe they did it they didn't even know who they were doing it to and neither did the unrighteous all right so and so I was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me not sick and imprisoned and you visited me not then shall they say then shall they also answer him saying Lord when saw we thee a hungered or a thirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison did not Minister unto thee then shall he answer them certainly verily I say unto you in so much as you did it not to one of the least of these these who Brethren you did it not to me and these shall go away unto Everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal all right you may be seated I want to read something on paragraph just so we know where we're standing here on on paragraph 157. of this message period page 317 he says this in 316. he wants us to understand brother Branham wants us to understand he said many of the things that we've gone through May offend some he said he said it must be accepted and believed by faith some will be offended but what I have set forth be set forth because they but what I have set forth because they failed to understand the sovereignty of God watch this he's God's sovereign which sets forth that God is God and because he is God one cannot defeat his counsels or throat throw his will his will and purpose he thoured his will and purpose but he being omnipotent is ruling in all Affairs and doing what and doing whatever he will with his creation because all were created for his good pleasure therefore as Paul said if God should take one lump of clay and make of that same lump one vessel into honor and another vessel unto dishonor who can be offended and cry against him that he has the right to do this on the grounds of creation alone we cannot deny all right all right yet yet he went further even further for according to Romans 14 7-9 we have the Eerie food irrefutable proof that Jesus Paid the purchase price of the whole world and therefore he can do as he Wills with his own and see now he's going to read we're going to read Romans 14 7-9 here for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself for whether we live we live unto the Lord and whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live or die we are the Lords that's ownership we are the Lords of course we we can say too born again we are the Lords whether we live or die we're the Lords all right but he's speaking of ownership for this end Christ both died and Rose and revived that he might be Lord both of the dead and living and brother Brown said here ownership not relationship is meant here all right so carrying on let's go to the scripture and we I just I'll bypass some of these things because we know that bride is Brethren he does he does mention that if you want to see where it's at it's paragraph 143 upon what grounds do they enter into life eternal certainly not upon the fact that they already have his life as does the bride but they re but they receive it because they were kind to his Brethren they are not his brethren that would make them joint heirs with Jesus they are not Heirs of to anything but life they are they share No throne with him their names must have been in the Book of Life and not removed so these ones that we just read of these righteous had their names in the book and was not removed these others had could have had their names and been removed or whenever in the book okay so never recorded there are those that will never be recorded either one way or the other but notice in the scripture we're going to read that a minute the books were opened the books that were opened is the life of those standing before the bride and the groom we are not in that judgment standing before that throne we are sitting in the throne the throne that the Judgment that we stand before is the is the Judgment for reward there's where we meet him on the throne amen but this white throne the bride is judging we'll we'll get into that scripture and I'm sure you're aware of it where it is some of these things I probably will bypass for time but just want you to know this so they're not these here are not his brother the Brethren is the bride all right on paragraph 106 of this message 106 107 and 108 106 he says we can we will actually show by scripture that multitudes and he's beginning this message he actually begins this on page 294. it's called the promise to the overcomer he said we will actually show by scripture that multitudes who were not even born again will go into eternal life that's hard to that's hard to understand isn't it but talk about Grace they had a position in the book but not bride position now we'll say that because there is another section of this book now he says here we'll go eternal life as strange as that may sound it is certainly true then we'll show that there is a group of people whose names have been placed in that record before the foundation of the world cannot under any circumstances have those names removed that's bride then there's no another group and I'll just read this because I'm going to take the time but names were on the record before the foundation world will have their names removed there's another group okay so now now we have but we're dealing here with two that are standing before the white Throne judgment unrighteous and righteous all right so paragraph 107 to begin with there is no basis for the claim that the Lamb's Book of Life is not the same as the Book of Life The Book of Life might be called the Lamb's Book of Life and if you want to clarify this even more let's go back to rising of the Sun and invisible Union and he talks about that but when he brings this fourth brother Branham said what I've written here is not my mind this is God's mind that wrote this amen this was of the Lord this is not William branham's thoughts all right so he says to be so there's no basis for the claims that the Lamb's Book of Life is not the same as the Book of Life The Book of Life might be called the Lamb's Book of Life or Christ's book of life even thy book and the Book of the living only names are written in it only names okay are written in it now paragraph 108 you can see that though there are other books mentioned there is always the reference to one book containing names in the Revelation it is called the Lamb's Book of Life or the book of life and where is this book located I won't take time with that but he takes the scriptures it's located in heaven all right now in Revelations chapter 20. let's go over there if you will with me very familiar scriptures Revelations chapter 20. and verse 11. as I said this is this isn't a sheltered message this is something that's just gonna bring some clarification to and there's a lot of there's a lot of misunderstanding in this a lot of men's interpretation to it too but and if and if you disagree that's fine I'm not gonna I'm not gonna hold you accountable I want to bring the portion God had me to bring here this tonight Revelations 20 and verse 11 and I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven flood away and there was found no place for them and I saw the dead small and great stand before God there's your Nations and the books were opened and another book was opened which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works all right according to their works the bride will not be judged is not cannot will not be judged by works because her Works were already manifest in the Beloved she's already been accepted in him she's the elect this righteous we're speaking about standing Before the Throne is not elect not that they are elected to a position but I'm talking about the elect bride they're not the elected brother Brown said only the elect can be reborn can be born again so we know what we're speaking of here other words not saying that God didn't know and foreign them to a position their names remained on the book but they're not called in the scriptures the elect right all right so we we want to clarify that and so he said they're judged according they're written in the books according to their works now the books were opened I'm taking this out of a message the books were open he said that's the book of your life so those that were there the books opened I'm not we're speaking of others then the bride but it's still the books is your life so their life has become open you can't stand before that that judge and not have your books have your life wide open right brother bam said it would be shown before everybody I can't even imagine the multitudes I mean not beyond multitudes the millions maybe billions that would be there billions time may be trillions and how long would this take I you can only I can't even imagine how long the Judgment would take but what difference does it make the bride's sitting there with eternal life is that right okay so so we see here that that books is your life and every man was and every man was judged thus judge thus what by your life that was lived here all right and in only the book only contains names so if your life matched your name and your name's there you're going to be received if it wasn't or their name was removed you're cast into into the Lake of Fire all right so we want to be certain don't we you know there's no reason to go on this day and not be certain if we're sitting here and not certain of where we're standing we need to be certain not I hope so I hope so you have it's a no-so and God wants you to know so if there's a pull in your heart if there's a is there's a draw in your soul for more of God there's more of God for you if if you know that that has not been quickened into you that Christ has not become a genuine Revelation in you and you have met that person yet you need to meet it because that person is the token amen you have to have the token you must be born again you say well you you can't I can't over Express that I hope I trust the door isn't shut see there can still be those that can be born again but if you have that draw in you and you know you haven't met him yet because he is a revelation when there's a revelation you know it it's not something you don't know you know you have it and that revelation of himself and you is the evidence you're one of it of one of his and that you are him because there had to be a real gift in you that were here that Sunday when Minister there for the camp we spoke on the real gift the real gift is that seed land there in your soul that real gift is your soul amen so so we well this I won't get to preaching here I want to keep steady on my track here I won't get done all right now so we see here and in 13th verse and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and the death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book singular of life was cast into the Lake of Fire how were they judged according to their works we read this in Matthew 25. all right brother Brown it's not my emphasis put on that he put that emphasis that's how they were judged all right now so I want to read and now I think we pretty well covered this is one yeah 130 131 yeah there will be both righteous unrighteous I think we've covered that these righteous will not be the bride for the bride sits with him in judgment I think we understand that so we're not standing before being judged we've already been judged see we've already been judged he said over here he said we've already that body that we're that we're birthed into by the baptism of the Holy Ghost That Body has already been judged amen he could not stand Us in judgment again because he's already judged that body amen that we're born into he said you're either in Christ or out of Christ amen you're either in that body or out of that body right here tonight there's no halfway in between you're either in it or you're out of it so no halfway between it there's no pretty good Christians now I want you to notice you say well I'll just be good to everybody and maybe I can get in that's not what he just read we just read they didn't even know it when they did when they visited him when they gave him drink when they did these things they didn't know it and there's multitudes of people we could go back and show many people through the Bible that were good to those elect amen and brother Brandon mentions a couple and I've got another one we got three here tonight we can mention see and and so we'll we'll go right along here so I just wanted to bring that out we don't stand before the Judgment we are now standing before that we are now standing before the judgment well then Brother David The book must been open it sure has the book has been opened and it's called the brother Branham called it the bride's book now their name was in that last book of life but bonus what I just read there have their name in there but those names of his bride could not be removed under any circumstance and brother Branham goes on to clarify that with what we want to get into or just a part of here tonight so I'm going to kind of combine this a little bit now so we read we read Matthew there and now let's go to I mean in Revelations now let's go to Daniel in Daniel the seventh chapter and the ninth verse I beheld till Thrones were cast down in the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like pure wool he said why is that repeating again because he's in judgment okay his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels is burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him now watch thousands thousands ministered unto him thousands thousands ministered unto him I had something on that I wanted just to yeah you see the bride is with him in the throne as she is the as she is to judge the world she she has to be sitting in judgment with him that's exactly what Daniel saw all right because that was the thousand thousand and I've got a quote in here but I'll just say it right out brother man said that thousand thousand was the bride that ministers to him okay and then it says There Were Ten thousands times ten thousands did what stood before him one ministered to him as a wife with her husband and the other was standing before him so we see the Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were opened okay they were judged according to their works I want you now I won't go to First Corinthians 6 23 only to make this statement that's where know you not that the Saints shall judge we could you could you read that many times that's that's first first Corinthians 6 1. and six two but there's a point I want to make here do you not know verse 2 that the Saints so judge the world the world there is mankind so know ye not that the Saints shall judge mankind you see why we have to have character you see why we have to go through a shaping of that stone that stone that's unveiled in your soul that living Stone has to be shaped and cut why we wonder why we go so much pressures and trials and it's the shaping to shape you to your position in the body right you've been speaking about the major we have a measure of that faith we have a measure in the body that nobody can take our position or place as the bride see that Measure of Faith of what his faith Faith or what purpose whatever purpose he had placed you in the body to do amen all right so we know that the that we'll judge mankind he goes on to say can't we judge the smallest matters in the church see see why can't we judge if we've been called to a certain job why aren't we doing it called to a deacon called to a trustee why don't you do it what's wrong where's your judgment where's your discernment he said that's pretty strong Brother David yeah I know it but it's the truth amen amen if you if he chose you for a place I would do everything I could that'd be first thing in my life do what I should do according to his will and where is this will known we've had a we've had a Prophet come and bring us the order we need to consult him I have a message I'd like to bring later it's called Uh do order but it that would be a little strong but but who would what did David fail to to to to to consult Nathan but he consulted captains he consulted the the people find out what their opinions were find out what you don't need to know your opinion if you're not sure of where you're standing why it's standing there you need to find out be sure amen amen but but he went the wrong way and by doing so he did not do according to what the word said to do and Nathan would have showed him what to do to the right way to bring the ark to move the ark how was it moved they put it on a new cart we don't need this arc on a new cart just put it upon the hearts of the fivefold ministry where it belongs and Let It Be Moved feed the sheep see we don't need to find out whether whether we're called or not God oughta already told you that all right I'll get off of my soapbox here all right let's go to let's go to Second Peter chapter 3. second Peter chapter 3 and I want to read over here in just a minute and yeah I already did that okay yeah those those righteous stood and unrighteous stood before him in the Judgment according to Daniel okay second Peter 3 and if that if we find out that here that these people these these righteous and unrighteous did not know what they were doing I mean they did not know that they visited us and did with those things and you probably can tell have people in your lives that were very good to you I don't I'm not claiming I can't judge whether they do but that day they will be judged their heart will come open their lives will be open what was your motive objective see why did you do that because it was in my heart to do it Lord here enter in it was done that was proven right there in the Judgment but Lord yeah did you meet this certain a certain time and this person did such and such yes Lord here it is amen you see we can't put God In The Box and limit him we've got to realize he knows these Hearts he knows whose names are going to remain and who's they're taking off and and whose names are not there see he knows it but their works are going to declare it all right now so in second Peter I just wanted to read this because in the in the um well if I can find second Peter here get to it okay second Peter and it's in chapter 3 verse 11. no verse 10. but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing them that we have seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought you to be that's what I want to come to what is the bride to be what man or person ought to bride to be she's the very manifestation of the word promise for this hour what is the word promise for the Hour the full revelation of Jesus Christ amen so she's that promised word and and and with Christ in you which is God poured himself into Christ Christ became the revelation of God is that right that was the revelation of God but if Christ be in you what does it make you the complete revelation of the whole thing because Christ in you makes you the revelation of Christ so it's the whole thing amen oh man I'll just drop that in for extra minutes so what manner of people ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness so so what manner of life we're living what's going to happen with these there's some that are going to see something they don't know what it is but they have it in their heart to do for you the right thing and they do that talk about God's grace talk about talk about uh God knowing who they are and put it in their heart to do a certain thing knowing they would do it brought them around to it to see them do it and then turn right around and give them life for doing it think of that yeah see that's talk about Grace all right but we're not saved by works of man we're saved by grace through faith not grace alone but grace through faith it's the grace of God to reveal to you the word the evidence the evidence is the revelation of himself living in you and you grow up into him see that's why we had to have a message of the opening of seals because if it didn't come if a message didn't come Beyond Pentecost then we're all in trouble because there was a book opened there amen and that's why the prophet could say we're standing judgment now well then what did the book tell us what did it speak of the Bride their names are there what does it speak to you case dismissed there's no case to it you're free there's not even not even a record that you even once sinned you were Justified to begin with accepted into beloved everything you needed was in Christ amen and Christ in you is the genuine relevance of the Revelation revealed in you that you are him okay I'm starting to preach here and I got to get back in track all right so I wanted to bring that out that that this is that what manner of people ought we to be now I could read a lot in that but you can read it they'll just see let me see if I want to go further here um yeah looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens shall be on fire Heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found in him in peace without spot Oh Brother David there's nobody around here without spot I beg your pardon this bride is without spot because she's in Christ she's in the sinless one making her sinless sure we have mistakes and failures but God's not judging it by that since the blood covenants come he's judging this by the witness of the Holy Ghost in US the life of that blood and as long as that's there the blood's showing that's the token that's why the toke is not preached very much because the token you must have the token the only way you can get in the Rapture is by the token having the token you have you have already your clearance the token is your clearance amen amen amen hallelujah that's right okay now so I just but what matter people ought we to be because in the matter if we are here to be the very manifestation of Christ that is Who We Are amen not who we are here who I am here this real gift is who I am yeah amen the baptism was the temporal gift but the temporal gift quickened the seed inside of me a seed predestinated land there to life and that's Christ in me that's why I can't disbelieve the word that's why I can't disbelieve a perfect interpretation of that word because without without Christ in you you have nothing but letter and the letter can kill you we're not Ministers of the letter we're Ministers of the spirit the life of this Bible the life of the letter we can't know this life we can't know the thought behind this letter this letter is God in written form that's true and we know it's the truth but without the Holy Ghost in you how are you going to know what this is saying because the Holy Ghost in you would would acknowledge and receive what a prophet has already said because the words come to him the interpretation of this hour the words come to him the seventh angel message revealed the Mysteries it's those Mysteries that would literally turn your heart to the original Faith it's the revelation of those Mysteries the book was open John even read about him and still in symbol form but the book was open but the Revelation wasn't there and when John heard those seven Thunders utter their voices which is the Revelation contained in those seals see Revelation contained in those seals he was commanded to seal it up seal it up and when the seventh Seal Seal Seal it up was opened it was silent why because it wasn't written but in the days of the seventh angel the mystery of God would be finished because the silence denotes a secret and only the bride can receive that secret because the secret is in the public show it's revealed in you it doesn't come with observation it comes by revelation it's lived out and that's what if it's lived out there's some that can receive it not even knowing what they're doing but will do a heaven their heart to do for you hardly even knowing you or visit you or give you water we don't know as the further we go along who will step in the scene and a hard time we may have to go through and provide for you do for you because they saw they they saw they saw they didn't know what it was but they had it in their heart to do it that's what this is speaking of there's going to be those people standing before you someday amen all right so okay Saint John 5 24. let's go over there very quickly as we're running here a little bit here 5 24. very familiar scriptures verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word heareth there is receiving he that heareth my word has an ear to hear heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into judgment condemnation which is Judgment but is passed from Death unto life amen you see right there they've already got life brother Branham and quoting that scripture said verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and then the prophet says that is the believer is already the recipient of eternal life because he say why because he's able to receive he's able to hear the word so he has a real gift on the inside a genuine seed there to receive it the outpouring of the life the outpouring of the Holy Spirit see the only way you can be birthed is the seedest to be there amen amen so we're going Beyond an anointing on your spirit we're going down beyond that Veil the real gift lays in there hallelujah or we would say in that little room you come out with something you can't explain why because it's not revealed to everybody but you Hallelujah but we preach revelation we preach faith amen and God will have to Quicken it we're not sponsible for what they do with it it's responsibility of preaching it they that have an ear to hear they're going to receive it because they're already a recipient of eternal life which brother Brown said which he has in his possession now my where's the fear then where's your anxiety about tomorrow about the next day or about what you got to do or don't do let God do the take care of it what you go through where's our trust all right now and shall not come into condemnation shall not come into the judgments judgment is what it really means but is passed permanently passed permanently from Death unto life my that's wonderful we could say Amen go home right there we've passed permanently brother Paul we pass permanently brothers sisters you that are born again we've passed permanently from death into life my my notice okay but notice carefully paragraph 135 Jesus must have yet another group in mind who had a certain Resurrection will receive eternal life at a certain Resurrection we're going to come into this now in Saint John 5 28. now he says not having previously received it as a member of the Bride they receive it at a future time at another Resurrection all right now now Saint John 5 28 Marvel not at this for the hour is coming in which all a Double L which all that are in the graves so it's not pertaining to the bride you say well it could be this is first written no not all come up in the first resurrection all the elect do all the bride does but watch what the prophet says about this scripture he says now all that are in the graves will hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of Life what's in you what are they doing good to the resurrection of life who are you what a resurrection this is what a resurrection that was when I raised with him but what a resurrectionist is to prove I raised with him amen all right now he says and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation now we all know now listen to what he said paragraph 136 page 311. now we all know that John 5 28-29 is not the rapture it's not the first resurrection for only the dead in Christ will rise from the graves at that time along with the living bride who is still on Earth then he quotes the scripture which I won't quote in first Thessalonians 4 16 through 17. all right now that's all so we look at the all now the question arises why are these righteous within the Judgment there's no place that they can come up for they are but but there are but two resurrections and since they do not qualify for the first resurrection they must come up in the second which is a resurrection unto judgment amen all right the ones who qualify for the first resurrection the bride are not in the judgment all right you see how secret this this uh taking away the bride is in fact it's happening we just don't haven't come to our climax yet it's taking place but brother Brown called it a secret catching away well brother Dave you don't have to be so secret about it I'm not secret about it he's the secret about it he's veiled but it's happening and and and we could prove that in the scripture if we had time see we don't have time so so we'll just keep on going now so but he goes on to say that all is not of course we we know that it's not it's everyone everybody both whatever they are of all Nations everything will come alive again at the second Resurrection for judgment so you think well I will resurrect I'll just go yo yeah you will you'll be somewhere until that time right that's exactly right amen all right so and nothing's going to be hid You Can't Hide a thing Hallelujah all right now yeah he says here all are going to come forth in the grave this is the very same Resurrection is spoken of in Revelations 20 where the dead were brought forth before the Lord and judged according to their works so we see that's what that is though it seems thus we may not discredit the words of Jesus who most pointedly sets forth that there are some found in the Book of Life who will either receive eternal life before the general Resurrection or after it there's going to be some receive it afterwards all right okay now in paragraph 148 we see that there's we see okay let me go on here paragraph 141. and I won't be too much longer 141. the first resurrection has nothing to do with the second death that is at the end of the Thousand Years when all the rest of the Dead live again and in that day there will be those who come forth to eternal life and those others who are caught in the second death now and those and now we do not need to guess about those in the second Resurrection or a given life we are told that is given to them watch this we are told you're talking about the righteous there before the in this in the Judgment we are told it is given to them those on his right on the grounds that they've been kind and good to the brothers okay paragraph 141 page 312. those who raise who are raised and cast in the Lake of Fire will be so treated because of their mistreatment of the brethren since this is the word of God we simply accept it there's no argument here it's just simply a statement of fact okay now paragraph 143 upon what ground do they enter into life Eternal certainly not upon the fact that they already have it already have his life as does the bride but they receive it because they were kind to his Brethren they are not his Brethren now I've mentioned this before okay but their names must have been in the Book of Life and not removed now because of now watch what he says about these he said but because of their love of the people of God they weren't bad people but because they were their love for the people of God they knew why they did what they did but look at love being expressed yeah yeah to Christ yeah as much as the least of these you've done it unto me all right he said he said now not I said but because of their love of the people of God they are recognized and saved they're not saved before here you're saved later he said he said no doubt they served and helped the children of God perhaps like Nicodemus and Gamaliel I don't have to go into what Gamaliel did they stood up for him didn't he yeah let's just wait on here a little bit if this things of God that come to not I mean if the God we can't fight against it see what did he do he was good to those people when did we do this see all right see see they stood for the children in time of trouble if this seems to smack a restoration which caught carefully now for the wicked are not restored but turned into the Lake of Fire their names of many of those destroyed were in The Book of Life also because they were blotted out because they failed to honor the people of God who were here's Peter now who were the Living manifested Word they met the word you see what manner of people we ought to be we ought to be feeding on this open book every day we ought to be drawing night of God every day through prayer and through reading of the scriptures and through feeding on the words yeah but I don't have time then you better make time you better redeem the time amen we've got a decision to make then something's got to have priority in your life something is going to have priority and if it isn't the word what is it and if it's not the word it's an idol you place something over the head of this word amen that's so easy to do because we're creatures of humanness and we reason we do this and that but greater is he that is in you that keeps you all right we'll make you know what you're doing then what are we going to do if we love him obey die to ourselves take up our cross daily and follow him oh but Lord you don't know the circumstance if I follow you how many came to brother Brown said we would do that we know you're telling the truth we'd do it but we'd lose our income we would do this we would do that is it what means more to you than that which they stayed with become their Idol an idolatrous spirit because something came before them other than the word taking preeminence they had the opportunity how many in this message had the opportunity and then turned around and rejected where are their names you see I'm not putting everybody under under that I don't know who can still come back and not that's not my business but I'm talking about it the judgment there's going to be those that will be there okay now the foolish virgins they will be judged in the second Resurrection we know that because they fail to get oil they don't come up in the first resurrection all right see and we know that their soul is under the altar the Jews given white robes when second Resurrection judgment there are two records of two judgments only one see see where Cass I'm talking about two two no record of two judgments set where the wicked are cast in the Lake of Fire let me make sure we're clear on that only the beasts and false prophet are judged at the end in the in of the Great Tribulation they're Cast Away no this is the white Throne judgment and they are judged according to what is written in the books all right now so he goes on to say the Jews will be there and I will go into all that right now because that's they'll be there 140 4 000 are sealed we know in their time of receiving the message like we had what are we sealed under amen all right okay paragraph 148 314 page it is the second Resurrection where the five foolish virgins come up notice they were virgins they did not have the Holy Spirit so they missed being in the bride a brother but brother I've shouted I've danced I've cast out devils I still don't mean you have it in your soul the word you can do all those things under the anointing genuine anointing of the Holy Ghost but never go beyond that Veil now if we don't go Beyond the Veil there's no Resurrection first Rapture say you've got to go behind the veil but the veil's been rant and it's coming full view of who the bride what's coming full of you The Mercy Seat the Shekinah the bread laying there ready to be ripened amen all right we could go allotted that's another message okay notice so but these people These Foolish virgin being as separated they are a separated god-loving people and trying to abide in the word according to what they knew of it and being a help in the work of the Lord will come up at the end of time they will miss the millennium which you can begin to see by these truths is much more important and wonderful than we have ever thought or believed amen all these people had their names in The Book of Life and their names remained and whose names did not remain those of the world system churches who fought the bride will be those whose names are removed they will the that is who will lose out they will be they will be cast in the leg of fire now going back to gamalia and and where I mentioned that Nicodemus he mentions Camellia let's turn over here just a moment to another scripture in Timothy see they were good and kind to the brethren now let me just get the couple of these real quick in paragraph 161 he says and if there are those who will enter into life eternal after the white Throne judgment solely Now watch how they enter into life eternal if they enter into life eternal at the white Throne judgment solely on the grounds of being good and kind and just to the elect of God who are his Brethren then we cannot but accept that think of what the other judge okay so or who hath knoweth the mind of the Lord that he should instruct him rather let us be subject in faith to him who is our father and live so in paragraph that's 161 and 172. or once 72 yes there then we had previously shown there are those who stood for the bride and were an aid and comfort to her those had their names remaining on the book of life and go into life Everlasting amen all right so now in Timothy second Timothy second Timothy let's go over here and read what Paul said about a certain person starting with the 14th verse the Lord give Mercy unto the house of uh oh this is second Timothy one excuse me 116. the Lord give Mercy unto the house of anisrus for he oft refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain wow well watch what he goes on to say but when he was in Rome he sought me out very diligently he's writing this in prison Paul is to Timothy he said but but when he was in Rome he sought me out very diligently and found me the Lord grant watch this the Lord grant unto him that he might find Mercy of the Lord in that day and how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus thou knowest very well my all right okay now so we know that we've already been through that about those that are cast in in the message another message here in paragraph 349 if you want the date I can give it to you and you people with these saw blade tempers that's always spouting off in the mouth of somebody can't put up and things like that be careful you're guilty if you speak a word against your brother that's not right not just go around and tear it down not just go around and tear it down you don't have to stick a knife in a man's back to kill him you can break his character and kill him kill his influence speak against your pastor here say something bad about him you just might as well have shot him told something that wasn't right about him well it'll kill his influence with the people and things like that and you're guilty of it what Jesus said what manner of people are we to be God help us amen even what you think what you talk about in your secret places remember God's your thoughts speak louder in heaven than your words amen that's the truth and brother sister we're guilty but let's make it right if we see we're guilty that's what I meant by our hearts condemning us if God's in your heart and you do something wrong and that Prophet said I knew I did wrong he went to pray for that baby and his heart condemned him he said how can you pray for that baby when you need to go and make something right first see we're talking about the Holy Ghost In You will will make that known to you then go get it right you can't wait to get it right that's the Holy Ghost working in you amen all right now so names that remained on The Book of Life okay and then include the Jews now the last thing I'm going to do and I'm closing I want to just go through some things where is the names of the Bride found haha amen they're written in the book aren't they I may would say they're written in the last book of life they are but where in the Lamb's Book of Life all right you say well then they're they're somewhere well they're in a portion aren't they there's something there that they are they are the whole word but watch what the prophet said I want to share this with you and then we're done okay the first one I want to go to is paragraph 150. and that's now let us go another step but before we do let us review our case thus far first of all we know most assuredly that the purpose of God stands in the election I'm going to speak about purpose tonight it was purposed in himself it was purpose in himself I just love that don't you just love that you were purposing himself it was God's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him my what a what what a wonderful revelation let that be revealed to you one time where you come from then you'll know where you're going you know where you're going you know who you are you know where you come from you know who you are and if you know where you come from you know where you're going all right now she was foreknown and beloved before that she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the Earth she was Redeemed by his blood bought purchasing his property can but he's got to come forth taking the book marriage has come takes the book just like the Kinsmen Boaz had to take Ruth he took the book our Kinsmen he takes the book and makes claim on his redeemed what a happening for us in this hours why we put so much emphasis on these Seven Seals because that revelation of those Mysteries that absolutely going into one full mystery amen it's absolutely the very thing that turns literally turns the heart the Revelation contained in those seals which were sealed up is now revealed amen will literally turn the hearts of the children the seed to the original faith which is what God's own faith all right now so where are the names okay where are they found so we paragraph 150 we're reading she was see it before she ever came on the earth she was for known beloved she was Redeemed by the blood can never come to mind the condemnation judgment she can never be in the Judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her praise the Lord amen but paragraph 151 this is on page 315 but indeed she will be with him in his throne of judgment judging the world and even angels her name each of her members were written in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world now you see why and will come realize why the in that in the hand of the Angel was a book open but the Bible said a little book was it the Lamb's Book of Life certainly but what book was it the bride's book you couldn't get her name off of that if you tried that book was opened right there what was the book of redemption what was it redeeming amen you and I that's the book that that brother Branham called it the abstract deed of redemption but now he opens the book to lay claim because it's a marriage certificate amen and he lays claim on this who he has purchased all right and so we come down and actually I'll preach this another time but I don't like to give my titles but I was going to preach on God's mystery in Christ God's mystery in Christ amen all right just as Eve was in Adam a mystery all right now 159 paragraph 159 and says she was written in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world paragraph 159. thus if God is so designed that there be those whose names are placed in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life and cannot be erased for there the names of his bride then we must accept that then he goes on to say if there's no names that are removed we must accept that those names will enter into life based on the grounds that be good and kind to the elect we must accept that all right now well you say must accept it who's going to accept it we the bride will accept that all right now paragraph 164. I said I'm closing so I'm just I'm right at the time to close paragraph 164. he says this now then the record of now he's talking about the wheat plant because a wheat plant is the is the record of the book it's the Book of Life record but in the wheat plant is parts that are saved parts that are not parts that are the life literal life which is the bride see and he goes on he says now the record of this wheat plant whose end is is to reproduce The Original Seed in multiple multiplied form is The Book of Life or the Lamb's Book of Life or the book of heaven or the book is he all right which is which it would see so I repeat the history or record of this wheat plant is The Book of Life which a part of the book of life is the record of eternal life a section of the Book of Life amen just like the wheat plant there's only a portion of that plant that comes to wheat seed see that's the life coming through carriers justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself the person to come right down back to Perfection back to the word again there's only a certain number can receive that word how were we brought back to him through the word amen all right but see those seven Thunders the Revelation contained in them wasn't something outside of the word it was said in the word amen and it was handed down to the hand of the seventh angel the sword was to unveil that by his messenger the lamb was to unveil that by his messenger that lamb his voice was a lion calling for his Queen to come and take her position because what is these seals revealing the finished mystery these Mysteries reveal the mystery what's the mystery you're the mystery amen amen all right so now we just in paragraph 164. okay I just read that a section of the life now so now in paragraph one I'm coming right down at the end now 168. he and this is page 320. so we're moving through this Artisan age he said we have the same right today in the church he said and he says well let me back up here he said all Israel is not Israel but all but a tiny minority and their names all but a tiny minority of Israel and that Minority is the hundred and forty four thousand had their names blotted out of The Book of Life think of that amen talking about in this day hurt that judgment okay now we have the same right today in the church he says names are going to be blotted out of the book of life no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life for that is another record though contained in the Lamb's Book of Life amen it's another record that's why we don't despise the day of small things a little book was taken may not be much in everybody's eyes and God hiding in Simplicity revealing it and then when it's revealed it's still hidden simplicity amen see all right but look at your position bride was in him and when it comes forth in this hour and she raises up in her position what is it the revealing of the son of man again it's his second coming that's the mystery brother Brown said the revelation of the seven seal was the mystery of the coming of the Lord and he says and I know about it he said no man would know it but I'm going to tell you my revelation see no man knew it but he said but he said what's going to awaken that bride it will be the revealing of these Mysteries will wake her up the seven thunders of of of Jesus Will awaken her well then a year almost a year and a half later now he says they haven't recognized The Awakening so it's done been preached amen because now he says they've been awakened and he said right here this morning Christ's mystery God revealed I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you what it says I'm going to tell you the mystery secret of that seventh seal amen all right now first John 5 11 right after saying that it's another record a record he says and this is the record first John 5 11 and 12 and this is the record that God hath given to us the bride eternal life and this life is in his son Hallelujah if you possess that life then what are you if that life is in you would be the revelation of himself that record which there's only one form of eternal life amen all right then that record God hath given to us eternal life is the record in this life is in his seed his son he that hath the son now what about the real gift he that hath the son hath life amen he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life and those who have that life were in him before the foundation of the world they were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that great Royal seed Jesus Christ would plant it he died and that life was in him came up through the wheat plant and is reproducing itself in the multitude multitudes of wheat seed not another seed same seed maltitude of wheat seeds having the same life in them being like the original because by Spirit by Spirit as Eve by Spirit she was Adam by spirit amen by spirit amen she's by Spirit they are original so then we see why the redeem brought back by the original owner the bride she was in him as Eve was an Adam cannot ever have her member names taken off the Record she is part of him she is in the throne she in the throne not on it in it and she can never be judged everyone in the Bride is a member of him he loses none but that doesn't that isn't concerning that all in the Book of Life or amongst them or even like Judas who have a part in the record but their names are removed now I won't go into that that's another program God bless you do you love him yeah paragraph one more is 173 thus the grain of wheat and I'm closing right here you can stand thus the grain of wheat that became a plant for the Harvest is the record of the church all right what comes out of the church see is the record and even as not all the wheat plant is wheat seed and not all the plant is used in the Harvest so with the church all the church is not the bride and neither is it all given eternal life but a part of it is gathered into the Garner and a part of it's kept that it might enter into eternal life in the second resurrection and part of it which is accounted chaff is burned in the Lake of Fire amen God bless you who are these righteous there in the judgment who are those unrighteous why would they be righteous and receive eternal life I think this has been answered God bless you let's pray our heavenly father we thank you for this little time of of Thy word because Thy word is life lord it's not what man knows it's not what I know it's what you reveal it's what you've ignown to us
