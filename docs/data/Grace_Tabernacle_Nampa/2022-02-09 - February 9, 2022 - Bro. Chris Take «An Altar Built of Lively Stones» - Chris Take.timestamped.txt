[26:29] and why don't we if you have your bibles
[26:31] tonight
[26:34] let's turn into uh
[26:36] first peter chapter 2
[26:39] verse 1.
[26:46] now i will admit this thought came to me
[26:48] during
[26:50] a service our pastor was preaching but
[26:53] aside from that and youth meeting as the
[26:55] youth will probably testify whether
[26:58] david and our pastor have been stepping
[27:00] all over me
[27:02] um
[27:03] so if we cross paths well
[27:06] you heard it twice
[27:07] or three times
[27:09] um
[27:10] it's just it's encouraging saints they
[27:12] see what
[27:13] what and god does it all the time but
[27:15] he's doing it again it's just everything
[27:17] just meshing in and
[27:19] uh keep giving my wife the elbow in
[27:21] church
[27:22] youth meeting or or hey look at my notes
[27:26] amen so we just trust god have his way
[27:28] tonight
[27:29] amen first peter chapter 2 verse 1
[27:33] wherefore laying aside all malice and
[27:35] all guile and hypocrisies and envies
[27:38] and all
[27:40] evil speakings
[27:42] as newborn babes desire the sincere milk
[27:45] of the word that ye may grow thereby
[27:48] if so be you have tasted that the lord
[27:51] is gracious
[27:53] i love that the lord is gracious i love
[27:56] that phrase
[27:57] amen we have tasted of that
[28:00] you know i say all the time that a true
[28:03] son or daughter of god has a revelation
[28:05] of grace
[28:08] to have revelation of grace you have
[28:09] tasted that the lord is gracious
[28:12] to whom coming as unto a living stone
[28:15] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[28:18] god and precious you know that applies
[28:21] to christ
[28:22] just as much as it applies to you
[28:25] you were disallowed of men
[28:27] but chosen of god
[28:29] and precious
[28:31] precious to god he also as lively stones
[28:36] are built as where i take my text
[28:38] tonight are built upon are built up a
[28:41] spiritual house a holy priesthood to
[28:44] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[28:47] to god by jesus christ wherefore also it
[28:50] is contained in the scripture behold i
[28:53] lay in zion a chief cornerstone elect
[28:55] precious and he that believeth on him
[28:57] shall not be confounded
[28:59] thank the lord for clarity
[29:02] unto you and therefore which believe he
[29:04] is precious but unto them which be a
[29:06] disobedient the stone which the builders
[29:08] disallowed or rejected
[29:10] the same is made the head of the corner
[29:14] and a stone of stumbling a rock of
[29:17] offense even to them which stumble at
[29:19] the word being disobedient were unto
[29:22] also they were appointed
[29:25] but you are a chosen generation a royal
[29:27] priesthood a holy nation a peculiar
[29:30] people that you ye should show forth the
[29:32] praises of him who hath called you out
[29:34] of darkness into his marvelous light
[29:38] which in time passed for not a people
[29:40] but are now the people of god which have
[29:43] not obtained mercy but now
[29:46] have obtained mercy while you're
[29:48] standing one more scripture first
[29:50] corinthians 10
[29:51] verse 1 through five
[29:56] first corinthians 10 verse one through
[29:58] five
[30:09] remember my wife tonight she her foot
[30:12] was acting up and since i'm preaching
[30:15] there's no one to carry the baby around
[30:17] so they had to stay home tonight
[30:20] but you just remember her and god would
[30:21] heal her foot just hurting extra bad
[30:23] today but it's just part of the process
[30:26] so uh
[30:27] first corinthians chapter 10 verse 1
[30:30] moreover moreover brethren i would not
[30:32] that ye should be ignorant
[30:34] how that all our fathers were under the
[30:36] cloud and all passed through the sea and
[30:38] were all baptized unto moses in the
[30:40] cloud and in the sea and it all eat the
[30:43] same spiritual meat and it all drink the
[30:45] same spiritual drink for they drank of
[30:47] that spiritual rock that followed them
[30:50] and that rock was christ
[30:52] but with many of them god was not well
[30:55] pleased for they were overthrown
[30:57] in the wilderness may the lord add the
[30:59] blessing to the reading of his word you
[31:00] may be seated this
[31:02] evening so
[31:05] my
[31:08] my
[31:08] title tonight
[31:14] is
[31:15] two alters part one
[31:18] and uh i had to do it
[31:21] um
[31:23] it just
[31:24] you know
[31:25] sometimes well
[31:28] sometimes it just
[31:30] just
[31:31] explodes
[31:32] and uh i have already notes for number
[31:34] two
[31:36] i was in the back there and and um
[31:39] sometimes i just get so overwhelmed
[31:43] with what god is is inspiring that i
[31:46] can't hardly write it down
[31:48] so i just i just put what i can there to
[31:50] just bring to my remembrance and
[31:52] sometimes i have just a few pages of
[31:54] notes but
[31:55] the context is all there because that
[31:57] anointing was just so strong out in the
[31:59] office here i was just just meditating
[32:01] and putting notes down
[32:04] and that the the the anointing and the
[32:06] inspiration was was was so strong i
[32:08] almost just started bawling my eyes out
[32:11] right there
[32:12] um
[32:13] but i wanted to i wanted to um bring up
[32:17] this definition of the word disallowed
[32:20] um so sorry my my so my subtitle today
[32:23] is an altar built of lively
[32:27] and stones
[32:27] this this word disallow
[32:31] disallowed as the scripture says here in
[32:33] first peter
[32:36] i'll jump to it real quick um see
[32:45] the stone which the builders disallowed
[32:47] the definition of disallow is to refuse
[32:50] to declare valid
[32:53] refuse to declare valid
[32:58] if that isn't where we live today
[33:01] i don't know what it is
[33:03] it's not just
[33:04] it's not the word disagree
[33:07] it's not the word different opinion they
[33:11] it's a strong word
[33:12] refuse
[33:15] do it
[33:16] to decree it valid
[33:18] refuse
[33:20] you don't when someone says when someone
[33:21] disagrees with you nicely you don't say
[33:24] they refused
[33:25] but when somebody's in your face
[33:27] denying your opinion
[33:30] you say they're refusing
[33:32] or you telling somebody to do something
[33:34] and their your little three-year-old is
[33:36] refusing
[33:39] you don't say oh they just disagreed
[33:41] when they're worked up and
[33:44] animated about what they're saying they
[33:46] were refusing
[33:48] and so
[33:50] you know the saying goes you can try to
[33:52] lay it out for them but they refuse to
[33:54] accept it because it takes revelation so
[33:58] we're not going to go into that
[34:00] tonight but an altar built of lively
[34:03] stones and exodus chapter 20 verse 25
[34:06] and i'll try to just hold myself back a
[34:08] little bit here so i don't get too fired
[34:10] up
[34:11] and talk too fast i'm
[34:13] pretty excited um but exodus 20 verse 25
[34:17] and if thou wilt make an altar of stone
[34:21] thou shalt not build it up hewn stone
[34:24] for if thou left up thy tool upon it
[34:26] thou hast polluted it so if if if the
[34:31] brother brand preaches the series israel
[34:32] and the church how many know israel
[34:34] types the church right
[34:36] so if if
[34:38] the an israelite goes to build an altar
[34:42] and they're going to build it of stone
[34:43] now of wood there was different rules
[34:45] but if they wanted to build it of stone
[34:48] it had to be natural stone collected
[34:51] from the earth they could not go and cut
[34:53] themselves some perfect cubes to stack
[34:56] very neatly like you see in the pictures
[34:58] and the drawings to make this beautiful
[35:00] ornate altar of stones they couldn't do
[35:03] that because if they took a a tool a
[35:06] hammer and a chisel to cut out you know
[35:09] wow i'm talking marble granite
[35:12] beautiful stones created by god
[35:15] denied by christ you they they couldn't
[35:19] take and cut this beautiful cube and
[35:21] make this pretty altar like cain did
[35:26] that everyone would look upon and say
[35:28] now i want to go to that church or i
[35:30] wish i was i was just as collected and
[35:33] you know i've been listening to the tape
[35:34] the statue of a perfect man and brother
[35:36] bam says oh help me recollect here lord
[35:39] uh he's talking about you know oh you
[35:40] need we need to we talking about people
[35:42] needing to to collect um not collect to
[35:45] become more better at speaking more
[35:48] eloquent
[35:49] use the word more better you can say
[35:51] brother chris needs some speech lessons
[35:56] he says it's not about that he's talking
[35:58] about the statue of a perfect man
[36:00] it's about building upon the faith of
[36:03] christ so
[36:04] um faith in christ
[36:07] we don't want to go into that sermon
[36:08] [Laughter]
[36:10] lord help me keep that the direction
[36:12] here but still be open to his will
[36:15] so they couldn't go and cut a stone with
[36:18] tools or they would pollute the altar
[36:22] because at that point that stone is now
[36:25] man-made and you say well what's so
[36:27] important but you see the old testament
[36:29] was the groundwork for the new testament
[36:32] uh everything was a type and an
[36:34] expression of what god had in mind and
[36:37] so he couldn't take just uh um
[36:42] a stone cut from a mountain it had to be
[36:44] a lively stone it had to be a stone
[36:47] taken naturally you know when the
[36:49] children of israel were in were in the
[36:51] land of egypt they were commanded to
[36:53] take hyssop to put the token the blood
[36:55] upon the door post hyssop is a common
[36:59] weed in other words you can find it
[37:00] wherever you look it grows everywhere
[37:03] right signifying that faith is simple
[37:06] it's a common thing guess what no matter
[37:08] where you are what you're doing there's
[37:11] stones around to build an altar
[37:13] no matter where you are in life no
[37:15] matter what situation you're in amen
[37:17] jacob
[37:18] and many times in his life was at
[37:21] different points of his journey how many
[37:23] know jacob had a lot to overcome amen
[37:26] but he met an angel one night and then
[37:28] that the lord changed his name but many
[37:31] times he's he's went to this place and
[37:34] then he built an altar
[37:36] or he went to this place and he built an
[37:38] altar and called it el bethel the house
[37:41] of god and he went to this place and he
[37:43] built an altar what it was jacob was
[37:46] seeking and looking for amen that same
[37:50] place his grandfather abraham was
[37:52] walking seeking that he had a desire
[37:55] what was it that my grandfather had that
[37:57] connection that he had to god jacob was
[38:00] building an altar
[38:02] and so um praise the lord so it could
[38:05] not be built of hewn stone and then it
[38:08] would be man made brother venom says in
[38:10] watchmen what of the night 1960
[38:13] uh it's dead been dead a long time ago
[38:15] having a form of godliness and denying
[38:17] the power thereof why don't you build
[38:19] your hopes on things eternal they will
[38:22] never pass away build it on christ the
[38:24] solid rock i stand all the ground is
[38:27] sinking sand build upon the lively stone
[38:30] not something that's dead and been
[38:32] dismissed from god years ago
[38:34] build your hope in something now where
[38:37] god's a living
[38:39] now
[38:43] two altars remember that's that's our
[38:45] title two altars an altar built of
[38:48] lively stone you could say you could you
[38:50] could jump off of that an altar built of
[38:53] loudly stones what house will you build
[38:55] me saith the lord amen
[38:57] and convince and then concerned 1962
[39:00] they just have these two quotes here
[39:02] tonight uh not give him a handshake and
[39:04] put his name on a book talking about a
[39:06] convert he's got to be born again by the
[39:09] spirit of god he's got to have the power
[39:11] of christ in his life that changes him
[39:13] from a dead man to a living creature a
[39:17] lively stone
[39:22] raised up and joint heirs with christ in
[39:24] the kingdom sitting in heavenly places
[39:26] you've got to be convinced
[39:28] first
[39:29] a living creature a lively stone no
[39:32] longer a dead stone no longer a dead man
[39:35] but a lively creature in christ an altar
[39:38] amen an altar built of lively stones and
[39:42] so your life amen built upon a
[39:45] revelation of christ
[39:47] amen
[39:50] is an altar built of lively stones
[39:53] and then there's no more dead stones
[39:55] those were tossed out
[39:57] they were too
[40:01] modified
[40:03] by man's tools
[40:05] oh
[40:06] you can take a man they've done it you
[40:08] can go and look at the videos
[40:11] this homeless guy gets a shave and a
[40:13] haircut and a bath and a new set of
[40:15] clothes nothing
[40:16] don't take this the wrong way i hope you
[40:18] guys know what i'm saying
[40:19] he looks
[40:22] like
[40:23] you know someone that just walked out of
[40:25] a stock exchange in wall street
[40:28] right
[40:29] but you give them some time and he's
[40:31] right back to the mess he was in so you
[40:33] can take that alter and you can just
[40:35] purify that thing right up you can get a
[40:37] little mortar and you can brush it in
[40:39] the side there you can make it even
[40:42] you can cut some stones to fill in the
[40:44] gaps you can make it look good
[40:46] which is what kane did
[40:48] but you see
[40:49] there's a big difference and we're going
[40:51] to get into that right here first kings
[40:52] chapter 18 there's a big difference
[40:54] between these two altars
[40:58] there's quite a bit of scriptures here
[41:00] tonight
[41:02] bear with me first kings chapter 18.
[41:08] now this
[41:09] this is the story of elijah
[41:12] on mount
[41:14] carmel
[41:18] rather than read the whole thing i'm
[41:19] just gonna start the story
[41:21] so
[41:29] they for the israel has forsaken the
[41:30] commandments of the lord
[41:33] they've they're following baal
[41:35] and jezebel's religion
[41:38] and
[41:39] god speaks to elijah
[41:45] and he says
[41:46] go talk to ahab so elijah goes to ahab
[41:48] and says we're going to have a showdown
[41:50] on mark carmel you bring
[41:52] the prophets of baal and all the people
[41:55] and i will come
[41:57] so they all gather on mount carmel
[41:59] and um elijah says okay here's the deal
[42:03] the god who answers by fire
[42:06] he is god
[42:08] now
[42:09] israel was good at keeping their history
[42:14] israel
[42:15] knew who their father father father
[42:17] father father father's father was
[42:20] they knew where they came from they knew
[42:21] the boundaries of their tribes and their
[42:24] lands and knew the history of the tribes
[42:25] and why this tribe was on the other side
[42:27] of jordan and what this altar was that
[42:30] they built over there in the altar of 12
[42:32] stones that joshua built
[42:34] they knew their history
[42:38] i have no doubt when elijah said the god
[42:42] who answers by fire he is god everybody
[42:45] there knew what would happen yes
[42:49] i bet you the same maybe even the
[42:50] prophets of baal if they were israel i
[42:52] don't know you know
[42:55] they knew what was going to happen you
[42:58] see something within their hearts begin
[43:00] to stir up
[43:02] you see
[43:02] i keep trying to get ahead of myself you
[43:05] see they they
[43:06] god has a timing
[43:09] god couldn't have come
[43:10] along four days before this and done a
[43:14] mount carmel showdown the people weren't
[43:16] ready
[43:17] things weren't set in order
[43:20] remember that story brother talks about
[43:21] the hat how to be on the hook
[43:24] god is a god of order so things had to
[43:26] be in place the people's hearts were
[43:28] conditioned to receive the message that
[43:31] elijah had for them on mount carmel
[43:37] so
[43:38] we can start here in verse 25 and elijah
[43:40] said unto the prophets of baal choose
[43:42] you one bullock for yourselves and dress
[43:44] it first for ye are many and call on the
[43:47] name of your gods but put no fire under
[43:50] and they took the bullock which was
[43:52] given them and they dressed it and
[43:53] called on the name of baal from morning
[43:57] even until noon saying oh baal hear us
[43:59] but there was no voice nor any that
[44:01] answered and they leaped upon the altar
[44:04] which was made now let me tell you
[44:06] something this wasn't a religion of a
[44:09] neighboring people
[44:11] this was
[44:12] israel's religion
[44:15] this was in the message
[44:18] this was a division in their ranks
[44:22] this was in the church
[44:24] this religion of baal
[44:27] so um the prophets of baal begin to do
[44:29] their things and elijah kind of starts
[44:31] to mock them and says maybe he's
[44:33] sleeping
[44:34] maybe you need to wake him maybe he's on
[44:35] a long journey
[44:37] having a little fun with him
[44:40] no doubt elijah was probably sick and
[44:42] tired of dealing with the drama brought
[44:45] about by these prophets of baal
[44:47] and um
[44:48] so he says you know go and look for them
[44:50] you know or maybe they're pursuing a
[44:52] journey and they don't hear you and
[44:53] they're they're nowhere to be found you
[44:55] see
[44:56] they had an altar
[44:58] they had a wood they had a sacrifice
[45:02] they the the the bible here says they
[45:05] prophesied
[45:07] uh
[45:08] let's just keep reading and they cried
[45:10] aloud and cut themselves after their
[45:12] manner with knives and lancets till the
[45:14] blood gushed out upon them aren't you
[45:16] glad we don't
[45:18] serve a god that demands that kind of
[45:20] stuff
[45:22] you know
[45:23] in this in this scripture here
[45:25] this is a outward physical
[45:28] mutilation but what happens when you
[45:31] follow something contrary to god's word
[45:33] it's a spiritual mutilation
[45:38] and it cuts away at who you are
[45:41] spiritually and it came to pass when
[45:42] midday was passed and they prophesied
[45:44] until the time of the offering of the
[45:45] evening sacrifice you see the offering
[45:48] of the evening sacrifice they had their
[45:49] timing all off
[45:52] they looked like the right thing if you
[45:55] could say that
[45:57] but their timing was off
[45:59] they had the wrong day
[46:01] they had the wrong time
[46:03] but they in the evening time but there
[46:05] was neither a voice nor any to answer
[46:07] nor any that regarded and elijah said
[46:09] unto all the people come near unto me
[46:12] and all the people came near to him
[46:15] and i love this part of the scripture i
[46:17] don't know if i caught it before or not
[46:19] but it really spoke to me tonight
[46:22] and he repaired the altar of the lord
[46:25] that was broken down
[46:27] he didn't build a new altar
[46:29] the altar was already there
[46:32] he repaired the altar that was broken
[46:35] down
[46:37] the altar of the lord that was broken
[46:39] down and elijah took 12 stones according
[46:42] to the number of the tribes
[46:44] of the sons of jacob unto whom the word
[46:46] of the lord came saying israel shall be
[46:48] thy name you see
[46:50] jacob
[46:52] was you read about abraham you're about
[46:54] isaac but jacob was the first one you
[46:56] read about a man
[46:58] was a deceiver
[47:00] a man who needed christ a man you see
[47:03] his torment you know he he he was
[47:06] deceived with with his wives so he
[47:08] turned around and he put the things in
[47:11] the water and stole all the good sheep
[47:13] and all of the good cattle then he ran
[47:15] off and he was running from his brother
[47:17] sending the women and the children out
[47:18] first and before himself a man who was
[47:22] an unconverted
[47:24] an unconverted man portraying just the
[47:28] opposite of what you would expect from a
[47:30] godly man
[47:31] you see this this one of the first men
[47:34] in the bible you read about this torment
[47:37] a man fighting against his flesh is his
[47:40] the name he was born with you were born
[47:42] with a with a name if you will but one
[47:45] day god came along and said no this is
[47:47] your name this is your name israel so
[47:51] jacob but then jacob here now in the
[47:53] scripture
[47:54] is the one that god began to bring forth
[47:57] amen israel he changed his name to
[47:59] israel now the children of israel coming
[48:02] forth an expression of what god's desire
[48:05] to bring that seed down through which
[48:08] we'll get to tonight the lord be be
[48:10] willing so and with the stones he built
[48:12] an altar in the name of the lord and he
[48:15] made a trench about the altar as great
[48:17] as what contained two measures of seed
[48:22] and he put the wood in order and cut the
[48:25] bull lock in pieces and laid him on the
[48:27] wood and he said fill four barrels with
[48:29] water and pour on the burnt sacrifice
[48:32] and on the wood and he said do it the
[48:34] second time and they did it the second
[48:35] time and he said do it a third time and
[48:38] they did it the third time
[48:40] and the water ran round about the altar
[48:43] and he filled the trench also with water
[48:48] good luck starting that fire
[48:50] with the flint and steel
[48:52] this is what they had
[48:56] you can't even do it guess what
[48:58] you
[48:59] can't bring the fire
[49:03] you can't start your own fire
[49:06] god has to bring the fire
[49:10] the prophets of baal tried
[49:13] they tried to bring the fire but they
[49:15] couldn't
[49:16] because their altar wasn't built of
[49:18] lively stones and he said do it a second
[49:20] time okay
[49:22] and it came to pass at the time of the
[49:23] offering of the evening sacrifice that
[49:25] elijah the prophet came near and said
[49:27] lord god of abraham isaac and of israel
[49:30] let it be known this day that thou art
[49:32] god in israel and that i am thy servant
[49:35] and that i have done all these things at
[49:38] thy word
[49:41] you see we don't go beyond god's word
[49:43] amen
[49:44] we stand and we follow god's word amen
[49:48] whenever god calls you to do something
[49:50] you stand you go through and you do that
[49:54] according to his word
[49:55] god has an order hear me o lord hear me
[49:58] that this people may know that thou art
[50:00] the lord god and that thou has turned
[50:03] their heart back again
[50:05] then the fire of the lord fell and
[50:06] consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[50:08] wood and the stones and the dust and
[50:10] licked up the water that was in the
[50:12] trench and all consuming fire and when
[50:15] all the people saw they fell on their
[50:16] faces they said the lord he is god the
[50:19] lord
[50:20] he is god
[50:22] now
[50:24] here we have the the the
[50:26] two sides of the coin you have the altar
[50:29] for baal
[50:30] and you have the altar
[50:32] for god
[50:34] one built of lively stones one built of
[50:37] dead stones
[50:39] they both looked very similar
[50:45] so closing deceived could have deceived
[50:48] the very elect if it was possible right
[50:52] brother says there's always there's
[50:54] there's always two from a revival twins
[50:57] revival brings twins there's always two
[51:00] but you see one's trying to impersonate
[51:03] the other
[51:04] but there's one thing the other is
[51:06] always missing
[51:08] the fire of god amen the revelation of
[51:12] christ you see
[51:13] elijah had no doubts when he laid those
[51:17] 12 stones in that altar
[51:20] he had no doubts that when he called
[51:22] upon the lord
[51:24] fire would come down and consume his
[51:26] sacrifice
[51:28] because he built those that altar up
[51:31] based on faith
[51:33] that god would keep his word a
[51:35] revelation with every stone you see not
[51:38] only did he have revelation but he baked
[51:41] a sermon into the stacking of those
[51:43] stones reminding the children of israel
[51:45] of twelve stones
[51:48] now rather than read it i'll paraphrase
[51:50] i have the scripture here joshua 4 19
[51:52] and the people came up out of jordan
[51:55] well that's the wrong scripture
[51:57] joshua has them gathered 12 stones to
[52:00] stack on the other side of the jordan
[52:02] river he says let this be a remembrance
[52:06] when your children come to their fathers
[52:10] and they're desiring to know what are
[52:11] these stones for this 12 stone stack he
[52:14] said it let it be a memorial to what god
[52:17] has done today what did god do make them
[52:20] walk across on dry land
[52:22] no he brought them into revelation he
[52:25] brought them into an understanding of
[52:27] who christ was a type of where we live
[52:30] today in the promised land he brought
[52:33] them into the promise so now elijah sets
[52:36] these 12 stones do you think those
[52:38] people didn't notice it was 12 stones
[52:42] for the 12 tribes of israel they
[52:44] probably began to be smitten in their
[52:45] hearts as they remembered those 12
[52:48] stones that their their father and their
[52:50] grandfather and however long back it was
[52:52] were there and witnessed the laying of
[52:54] those stones as a memorial
[52:57] they probably remembered exactly where
[52:59] they were
[53:00] and they began to be smitten in their
[53:02] hearts as they realized we have turned
[53:04] our back on the altar of god the altar
[53:08] of lively stones that was laid there we
[53:11] have disallowed we disallowed
[53:14] the chief corner stone and then one day
[53:17] they're going to realize
[53:18] he received those wounds in the house
[53:20] with his friends
[53:22] but in this in this example here
[53:25] so he begins as he sets these stones and
[53:27] he laid these stones in faith
[53:30] based on his understanding did he pick
[53:33] the number 12
[53:36] he got that from the word
[53:38] see the word gave him a revelation of
[53:41] how many stones he needed to add to his
[53:43] altar you see the lord's gonna show you
[53:45] and give you instruction and revelation
[53:47] of how to build your altar so that you
[53:51] can receive the all-consuming fire of
[53:54] christ amen an altar built of lively
[53:57] stones
[53:59] now joshua 419
[54:02] and the people came up out of jordan on
[54:05] the tenth day of the first month and
[54:07] encamped in gilgal in the east border of
[54:10] jericho
[54:12] revelations 10 1 and i saw another
[54:15] mighty angel come down from heaven
[54:17] clothed with a cloud and the rainbow was
[54:19] upon his head and his face was as it
[54:21] were the sun and his feet as pillars of
[54:24] fire now we know that mighty angel was
[54:26] christ
[54:27] joshua was a type of christ jehovah's
[54:30] savior joshua's the type of christ and
[54:32] so he brings the the children of israel
[54:35] the church across the river jordan into
[54:38] the promised land into the revelation of
[54:41] what they had been longing for in egypt
[54:44] as they toiled for hundreds of years
[54:47] longing to go to back to that faith of
[54:50] their father that faith of of joseph
[54:54] excuse me
[54:55] and so
[54:56] joshua type of christ brings the church
[54:59] now across the river jordan on the
[55:02] 10th um
[55:04] tenth day of the first month revelations
[55:06] 10 1. just you can just whatever you
[55:09] want to do with that
[55:10] um but um joshua now now
[55:14] he comes across into the promised land
[55:16] you see god is all about foundations
[55:19] god is all about an anchor point you see
[55:22] we sing the song the anchor holds and we
[55:24] sing the uh you know um
[55:26] that other song oh
[55:30] i can't remember
[55:32] it but it's all about an anchor point in
[55:36] christ there's a scripture in matthew uh
[55:39] 16 18 and i say also unto thee that thou
[55:42] art peter and upon this rock i will
[55:44] build my church and the gates of hell
[55:46] shall not prevail against it an anchor
[55:49] point
[55:50] the revelation of who christ is so now
[55:53] joshua brings him into the promised land
[55:56] do you think god was just like oh
[55:58] they'll be fine now they're in the
[56:00] promised land absolutely not he knew
[56:02] they would need an anchor point he knew
[56:05] they would need a reminder
[56:07] of what happened that day and so
[56:10] um
[56:11] excuse me
[56:12] so joshua collects 12 stones
[56:16] and builds an altar
[56:19] an altar of lively stones and then he
[56:21] says here when the children shall come
[56:24] to their fathers
[56:27] malachi 4 6 and he shall turn the heart
[56:29] of the father to the children and the
[56:30] heart of the children to their fathers
[56:33] lest i come and smite the earth with a
[56:35] curse so what's our anchor point we were
[56:38] brought back to the faith of our
[56:40] apostolic fathers our pentecostal
[56:42] fathers of acts of the book of acts
[56:46] we're not founded on the fathers
[56:50] we're not founded on peter we're founded
[56:53] upon that revelation that he had to
[56:55] build his altar his altar of lively
[56:58] stones peter even preaches the message
[57:01] lively stones
[57:03] talking about how you are a lively stone
[57:06] you see
[57:07] it's the revelation
[57:10] of the fathers to cross jordan that
[57:13] revelation that came you see they had
[57:15] their fathers denied that revelation
[57:18] and they were overthrown in the
[57:20] wilderness
[57:24] they denied that
[57:26] they refused
[57:29] they refused to accept that amen
[57:34] so these this
[57:35] that generation was being raised up
[57:39] underneath
[57:41] a ministry of doubt
[57:45] under a ministry of you can't do it
[57:51] but they
[57:52] see that's what that's the thing about
[57:54] revelation it defies all odds
[57:58] you say oh that person there's no way
[57:59] they're going to be successful there's
[58:01] no way or somebody knew you when you
[58:03] were just i mean you know a biker with a
[58:05] braid
[58:09] they said that guy's gonna go to jail
[58:11] and they see you ten years later
[58:14] four weeks later that's what god can do
[58:17] and you look like
[58:19] a person
[58:21] cleaned up because revelation defies all
[58:25] odds
[58:26] revelation is the only thing that's
[58:28] going to get us out of here
[58:30] if your altar is built of dead stones
[58:32] their revelation is lacking but an altar
[58:35] built of lively stones is built by
[58:38] revelation
[58:39] and it's that revelation that
[58:42] joshua was anointed of the lord to lay
[58:45] those stones to remind them not that
[58:48] they just crossed over jordan but remind
[58:50] them of the revelation that their
[58:53] fathers had to cross jordan let me tell
[58:56] you something it takes revelation to
[58:57] step into muddy overflowing jordan river
[59:02] ever seen them flash floods a flash
[59:05] flood the water racing through that's
[59:07] probably about what the river jordan was
[59:08] that day
[59:10] it takes faith to step forward you see
[59:12] the water didn't part until they stepped
[59:15] in
[59:16] until they stepped in then it parted and
[59:19] they went across on a muddy
[59:21] riverbed
[59:23] dry land
[59:24] they went across on dry land
[59:28] you see it was a revelation to cross
[59:30] into the promise
[59:34] you can't make this up you can't make
[59:36] you can you can't fake it
[59:39] you can't fake it you know in the world
[59:41] today especially in the software
[59:43] industry well really anywhere but that's
[59:45] where i work so i experienced this so
[59:47] much you can fake it till you make it
[59:50] you tell somebody oh yeah i know how to
[59:51] write in that language and then you go
[59:53] and you watch everything you can and
[59:55] read everything you can and then the
[59:56] next morning you know how to write that
[59:58] language
[1:00:02] not recommended but it works
[1:00:05] but you can't fake it with revelation
[1:00:08] because guess what there's no fire
[1:00:11] the prophets of baal they were faking it
[1:00:13] and it almost deceived the elect
[1:00:16] but you can't fake because the stones
[1:00:21] have to be laid
[1:00:22] by revelation
[1:00:26] that is how you build an altar of lively
[1:00:29] stones
[1:00:31] and as you know the same revelation came
[1:00:33] to us turning us back
[1:00:35] to our fathers
[1:00:37] the heart of the children to the fathers
[1:00:39] when the children shall come to their
[1:00:40] fathers and then we went back
[1:00:42] to where it all started
[1:00:48] what was going to turn israel around
[1:00:51] at this showdown
[1:00:55] a fancy
[1:00:57] show
[1:00:59] the beautiful altar that
[1:01:01] the bell prophets the prophets of baal
[1:01:03] built
[1:01:04] the rugged inspiring altar that elijah
[1:01:08] built
[1:01:10] the fire of god
[1:01:13] is what turned them around
[1:01:15] but you see the groundwork was laid by
[1:01:17] elijah
[1:01:18] but you can have an altar
[1:01:21] you can have it built right but you
[1:01:23] still have to have the fire of god
[1:01:26] you still have to have it they were
[1:01:28] standing at the river jordan ready to
[1:01:30] cross
[1:01:31] but they needed the fire of god
[1:01:34] they needed a revelation of god to cross
[1:01:36] that you see elijah built the altar it
[1:01:39] was there it was set up it looked like
[1:01:42] it was the real thing
[1:01:44] but when did the fire come
[1:01:47] when elijah asked for it amen
[1:01:50] you want victory in your life you gotta
[1:01:52] ask for it you want healing in your life
[1:01:55] you gotta ask for it you want somebody
[1:01:57] that you know delivered from alcohol you
[1:01:59] gotta ask for it you want somebody you
[1:02:02] know delivered from pornography you have
[1:02:03] to ask for it because god says whatever
[1:02:06] you ask in my name you shall receive he
[1:02:09] didn't say just build an altar
[1:02:11] he wanted to see an act of your faith
[1:02:14] you built an altar let me see you step
[1:02:15] into the river jordan
[1:02:17] abraham had to build an altar one day
[1:02:20] he had a son by the name of isaac a
[1:02:23] promised son who he waited over 70 years
[1:02:26] for
[1:02:27] god said go sacrifice your son isaac
[1:02:31] so abraham goes and he builds an altar
[1:02:34] and isaac says father
[1:02:37] where's the lamb
[1:02:39] abraham
[1:02:41] by faith
[1:02:43] he said son god will provide a lamb so
[1:02:48] then when when
[1:02:49] he spoke those words they get to the
[1:02:51] location he begins to build an altar
[1:02:54] he was building an altar of lively
[1:02:57] stones because he had faith that when
[1:03:00] god promised him a son
[1:03:02] and a nation
[1:03:04] the sand and the stars
[1:03:07] he knew god had to keep that promise and
[1:03:10] so when he began to lay those stones
[1:03:13] into the altar saints of god there was
[1:03:15] nothing dead about them
[1:03:17] they were alive and kicking and
[1:03:19] screaming as he laid them down one after
[1:03:22] the other
[1:03:25] tears probably rolling down his eyes not
[1:03:27] knowing exactly what would come
[1:03:30] fully committed to take his son's life
[1:03:32] fully committed you see god knows when
[1:03:34] you're not fully committed
[1:03:37] he knows because your altar will be
[1:03:39] missing a stone
[1:03:42] so
[1:03:43] the altar is missing a stone
[1:03:46] lord your son's not fully committed yet
[1:03:49] all right
[1:03:50] give him some time
[1:03:52] give him some more grace
[1:03:54] because one day he'll lay that stone you
[1:03:56] see
[1:03:57] the faith that abrahad
[1:04:00] abraham had in christ
[1:04:02] to provide a lamb is the same faith that
[1:04:06] christ has in you to lay that last stone
[1:04:09] amen you are his elect seed and you will
[1:04:13] not return to him void
[1:04:16] abraham builds the altar
[1:04:18] isaac lays down upon it bound
[1:04:21] abraham holds a knife over isaac
[1:04:24] fully commits and the angel stops him
[1:04:28] and provides a lamb
[1:04:30] it's that same faith you see you read
[1:04:33] about abraham later on in hebrews
[1:04:35] chapter 11 you don't read and abraham by
[1:04:38] doubt took haga and had ishmael
[1:04:41] you see you have a book your writing of
[1:04:44] your life
[1:04:45] but christ has a book he's writing about
[1:04:47] you
[1:04:48] and it looks a lot different
[1:04:51] you have your mistakes listed out bullet
[1:04:54] pointed
[1:04:55] there's a concordance for you to
[1:04:57] reference
[1:05:00] christ
[1:05:02] he's more of a freestyle he's just
[1:05:04] nice and just writes it in there
[1:05:07] one after the other it's ready
[1:05:11] by faith
[1:05:13] paul haylett
[1:05:15] started pastoring a church
[1:05:17] by faith where the david moved from ohio
[1:05:21] by faith
[1:05:23] the ashdowns left canada
[1:05:27] by faith they overcame
[1:05:30] by the blood of the lamb and the word of
[1:05:32] their testimony you see saints of god
[1:05:34] too often we look into our book of
[1:05:37] failures
[1:05:41] too often we read from our book of
[1:05:43] failures
[1:05:45] instead of reading from his book
[1:05:47] about you his expression of you
[1:05:51] your name is written over and over and
[1:05:54] over again amen when abraham tried to
[1:05:58] sacrifice isaac and there was a ram
[1:06:00] there your name was in there
[1:06:03] when joseph stood in the prison
[1:06:05] wondering what was happening to him your
[1:06:07] name was in there
[1:06:09] when jesus walked the shores of galilee
[1:06:12] and called the disciples your name was
[1:06:14] in there
[1:06:16] when it said by his stripes you are
[1:06:19] healed your name was in there and god
[1:06:22] began to stack the stones you see it's
[1:06:24] not all up to you
[1:06:26] it's not all up to you that's the
[1:06:27] paradox of the christian life god says
[1:06:29] here son here's a stone try this one he
[1:06:32] doesn't leave you by himself by yourself
[1:06:34] god gave
[1:06:36] no praise god god gave abraham the faith
[1:06:39] he needed to build the altar to fully
[1:06:42] surrender and whenever there is full
[1:06:44] surrender
[1:06:45] there's victory
[1:06:47] there is victory
[1:06:49] abraham fully surrendered to god the
[1:06:52] knife was coming down and god gave him
[1:06:55] victory
[1:06:57] god gave him victory and an altar built
[1:07:00] of lively stones you see it's the
[1:07:01] revelation of christ
[1:07:04] it's the revelation of christ
[1:07:07] the prophets of baal were anointed
[1:07:10] but there was no revelation
[1:07:13] there was no fire
[1:07:15] they had an altar they had a bullock
[1:07:17] they even had wood
[1:07:19] they prophesied
[1:07:21] but there but they had no fire
[1:07:25] cain and abel had an altar
[1:07:28] but
[1:07:29] there was no fire on cain's altar
[1:07:34] and when cain was given the opportunity
[1:07:36] you see saints of god about the what
[1:07:38] thing about the word of god is it
[1:07:40] continues
[1:07:41] perfectly from genesis to revelations we
[1:07:44] just read in first peter that it's this
[1:07:46] he christ is the stone that was
[1:07:49] disallowed
[1:07:51] in the book of genesis
[1:07:54] god gives cain a chance and cain refuses
[1:07:59] he refuses
[1:08:01] the stone
[1:08:03] he refuses to go back and rebuild his
[1:08:05] altar
[1:08:07] god gave him a chance and he didn't just
[1:08:09] he refused it
[1:08:11] and he went
[1:08:14] there's no victory without christ
[1:08:21] the first
[1:08:22] thing
[1:08:24] gideon did
[1:08:26] after receiving revelation
[1:08:28] of who
[1:08:29] he is
[1:08:30] lower
[1:08:31] case h
[1:08:33] of who gideon himself was
[1:08:36] god had to come tell gideon you see that
[1:08:39] it's not up to you to build your it's
[1:08:40] not you're not left alone
[1:08:42] to build your altar
[1:08:44] god comes along
[1:08:46] and he says look
[1:08:47] forever
[1:08:48] you're a mighty man of valor
[1:08:51] he says no no i'm a barber
[1:08:56] he says no
[1:08:59] we can we you can let's just turn there
[1:09:02] if you don't mind judges 6 verse 24.
[1:09:06] here's gideon
[1:09:10] judges chapter six
[1:09:14] then gideon okay so the lord comes to
[1:09:16] him
[1:09:17] and gideon says look i think you're an
[1:09:20] angel but
[1:09:21] let me go
[1:09:25] make some food verse 19. oh no i'm sorry
[1:09:30] verse 17 and he said judges 6 17. and
[1:09:33] said unto them if now i found grace in
[1:09:34] my sight then show me a sign that thou
[1:09:36] talkest with me depart not hands i pray
[1:09:38] until i come unto thee and bring forth
[1:09:40] my present
[1:09:44] gift
[1:09:45] gideon went and prepared a gift
[1:09:48] and laid it on the rock yes
[1:09:52] i think it's matthew jesus says
[1:09:56] what what do you you fools you put more
[1:10:00] something about you put more into the
[1:10:01] gift than the altar
[1:10:03] but basically
[1:10:04] basically what he's saying is you you
[1:10:06] need both
[1:10:07] you need the gift and the altar
[1:10:10] they go together
[1:10:13] and and
[1:10:18] praise the lord
[1:10:21] okay we'll come we'll get to that so he
[1:10:23] lays his gift his present down
[1:10:26] and gideon says excuse me
[1:10:29] he made ready to stuff and the angel of
[1:10:30] god said take the flesh and the lemon
[1:10:32] cakes laid upon this rock verse 20 and
[1:10:34] pour out the broth and he did so
[1:10:37] then the angel the lord put forth the
[1:10:39] end of the staff that was in his hand
[1:10:40] and touched the flesh and the unleavened
[1:10:42] cakes and there rose up fire out of the
[1:10:44] rock
[1:10:46] consume the flesh and the unleavened
[1:10:48] cakes then the angel of the lord
[1:10:49] departed out of his sight the fire came
[1:10:52] from the rock
[1:10:54] what is the rock it's the same rock that
[1:10:57] followed the children of israel and
[1:10:59] watered them it's the same rock that god
[1:11:01] that christ said upon this rock i will
[1:11:04] build my church you see everything you
[1:11:07] need comes from the rock
[1:11:09] water for sustaining life fire for
[1:11:12] victory amen it's all comes from the
[1:11:15] rock so here gideon's gift is consumed
[1:11:19] in a sacrifice
[1:11:21] and then gideon's afraid and
[1:11:23] the lord says don't be don't be scared
[1:11:27] peace be unto thee if you're not thou
[1:11:28] shall not die so then gideon builds
[1:11:31] an altar
[1:11:34] gideon caught a revelation
[1:11:37] of the
[1:11:38] rock
[1:11:40] and he built an altar
[1:11:43] gideon didn't build an altar first he
[1:11:45] wasn't happened to be building an altar
[1:11:46] when the angel came around
[1:11:48] no he built an altar after he caught a
[1:11:51] revelation
[1:11:53] right that everything he needs
[1:11:55] comes from the rock and he called it
[1:11:57] jehovah shalom
[1:11:58] our god is peace
[1:12:01] saying to god
[1:12:03] i don't know anywhere better you can
[1:12:04] find peace than in that rock which is
[1:12:07] christ
[1:12:09] i don't know where you can find more
[1:12:10] peace than when you have an altar built
[1:12:12] of lively stones you say oh it's it's
[1:12:15] hard for the chris to to build the altar
[1:12:18] it's hard to find them stones
[1:12:20] you know what if you just pick up stones
[1:12:21] guess what some of them stones aren't
[1:12:23] going to work you got to try this out
[1:12:25] that stone doesn't fit try this stump
[1:12:27] maybe you have to take a couple layers
[1:12:29] down and try this stone
[1:12:30] to make it fit because they're natural
[1:12:32] stones you can't cut them
[1:12:34] you can't take god's word we just heard
[1:12:37] about this you can't you can't shave
[1:12:39] part of the bedrock off to build your
[1:12:41] house you have to go with what's there
[1:12:43] you have to shape your altar around the
[1:12:46] natural stones you can't heal them with
[1:12:49] tools or it will be polluted
[1:12:52] it'll be in other words when you when
[1:12:53] you take and you take a stone that
[1:12:56] doesn't fit something in your life
[1:12:58] doesn't fit in the altar and you try to
[1:13:00] you so you take and you shave it off
[1:13:02] here and you shave it off there and you
[1:13:04] put it there
[1:13:06] what you're doing is you're trying to
[1:13:08] take god's design and shape it to meet
[1:13:12] your desires
[1:13:14] and all that does is compromises and
[1:13:17] pollutes the altar you see
[1:13:20] you don't
[1:13:21] make god fit you
[1:13:24] you make you fit god
[1:13:29] so gideon receives a revelation and he
[1:13:31] builds his altar now one thing that and
[1:13:33] i have read enough to
[1:13:35] to trigger my memory so then he goes and
[1:13:37] and
[1:13:39] the lord says look take a bullock that
[1:13:41] one in your father's pasture that's
[1:13:43] seven years old
[1:13:44] uh seven years old
[1:13:47] yes that one in your father's pasture
[1:13:50] take your father's bullock
[1:13:53] and destroy your father's
[1:13:58] idols you see prince of god the very
[1:14:02] thing the devil uses against you god
[1:14:04] gives you the power to turn around and
[1:14:06] use that against him
[1:14:08] that that sickness he held over you that
[1:14:10] god healed you from guess what that just
[1:14:12] added another layer to your back
[1:14:14] that has added more power to your punch
[1:14:16] you say okay devil oh now you're going
[1:14:18] to give me this well what about when god
[1:14:20] did this for me
[1:14:23] it just adds fuel to the fire
[1:14:26] praise god
[1:14:29] so he goes he takes this bullock
[1:14:33] and um
[1:14:34] he goes and in in the middle of the
[1:14:36] night so you see gideon had a revelation
[1:14:39] but there was still
[1:14:40] flesh thanks to god
[1:14:43] we have revelation we serve god but once
[1:14:46] in a while you're going to see the flesh
[1:14:49] now if the flesh prevails you need to
[1:14:51] pray for them
[1:14:54] but when you see the flesh of your
[1:14:55] brother apply some grace
[1:14:58] we're all in this together
[1:15:02] so he goes down in the middle of the
[1:15:03] night
[1:15:09] i want to know how he convinced all them
[1:15:11] servants that helped him to keep quiet
[1:15:14] but he did it somehow
[1:15:16] so he gets his servants
[1:15:17] you know sneaks in
[1:15:22] okay just move it a couple inches at a
[1:15:24] time
[1:15:25] they get the bull lock out
[1:15:27] and go over there strap it up okay
[1:15:29] travel to the idle
[1:15:31] all right go ahead
[1:15:33] crash
[1:15:36] and then he takes that bullock and the
[1:15:38] wood from the grove
[1:15:40] that's right
[1:15:42] and he builds an altar builds another
[1:15:44] altar
[1:15:46] uh
[1:15:46] i gotta pick it up because there's
[1:15:48] something there
[1:15:54] sorry
[1:15:58] gideon took ten men of his servants that
[1:15:59] as the lord had said unto him and so it
[1:16:01] was because he feared his father's
[1:16:03] household
[1:16:06] and built and build excuse me and threw
[1:16:09] down the altar of baal that thy father
[1:16:11] hath cut down the grove that is by and
[1:16:13] build an altar unto the lord thy god
[1:16:15] upon the top of this rock in the ordered
[1:16:17] place and take a second bullock and
[1:16:20] offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of
[1:16:22] the grove which thou shalt cut down see
[1:16:24] what did i say that very thing the devil
[1:16:26] was using to bind them now god took it
[1:16:29] around chopped it up and put it as fuel
[1:16:31] to his fire
[1:16:33] you see the devil is bound by god's
[1:16:35] ordained will
[1:16:36] [Music]
[1:16:37] that's why the devil couldn't bring fire
[1:16:39] down from heaven he was fuming
[1:16:42] as his prophets danced around the altars
[1:16:45] cutting themselves he was filming
[1:16:47] because he knew he couldn't bring fire
[1:16:49] down you see he can impersonate god's
[1:16:51] only so far
[1:16:53] only as much as god allows him
[1:16:56] praise the lord for that there's a hedge
[1:16:57] about the devil
[1:17:01] so then he builds this altar now now
[1:17:03] here's here's the thing
[1:17:06] with the altar of the lord reestablished
[1:17:08] bales had to come down there's only room
[1:17:12] for one altar
[1:17:15] there's only room for one altar and when
[1:17:17] gideon fully surrendered to god then
[1:17:21] came
[1:17:22] israel's victory you see god called
[1:17:25] gideon to that time like i said earlier
[1:17:27] he couldn't have come to gideon four
[1:17:29] days earlier to the wine to the press
[1:17:32] that he was hiding behind
[1:17:34] it wasn't the right time
[1:17:35] gideon god had been working on gideon
[1:17:38] for months or years preparing him for
[1:17:41] that moment you see you don't know when
[1:17:44] you see somebody struggling or you know
[1:17:46] somebody out in the world you don't know
[1:17:48] what god's doing or where you don't know
[1:17:50] when their time is coming that god finds
[1:17:52] them behind the wine press
[1:17:54] you do not know
[1:17:55] but god has everything ordained to time
[1:17:58] but you see when gideon fully
[1:18:00] surrendered you say how do you know
[1:18:02] gideon surrendered
[1:18:03] for one he destroyed his father's
[1:18:05] religion
[1:18:07] for two and god said knock your army
[1:18:08] down he did he said knock it down again
[1:18:11] he did
[1:18:14] gideon said i don't know but i'm going
[1:18:15] to war tomorrow
[1:18:18] he was fully surrendered but god still
[1:18:20] gave him that encouragement he needed
[1:18:22] down behind the tent
[1:18:24] see victory always follows surrender
[1:18:27] just like we heard about abraham when
[1:18:29] abraham fully surrendered isaac up that
[1:18:31] is when abraham found his victory
[1:18:37] see i just flipped it in my note i
[1:18:39] flipped it in my sermon not in my notes
[1:18:42] isaac was the promised son
[1:18:45] you see gideon caught a revelation
[1:18:49] that he was a promised son of israel
[1:18:52] gideon called revelation that whatever
[1:18:54] god asks me to do
[1:18:56] he can back me up
[1:19:00] and so gideon went out the same thing
[1:19:02] abraham and you see abraham
[1:19:06] isaac was given as a promised son this
[1:19:07] was the same son that sarah bore in her
[1:19:10] womb
[1:19:11] that types us
[1:19:13] receiving the seed of christ
[1:19:16] and bearing that life that promise the
[1:19:18] promised son which is christ
[1:19:21] you see abraham had a revelation that
[1:19:25] not a promised son but the promised son
[1:19:28] had to come
[1:19:30] he had a revelation that
[1:19:32] whether it be isaac
[1:19:34] or not in his seed
[1:19:38] shall be called or however that
[1:19:40] scripture goes from it from abraham's
[1:19:43] seed so it wasn't just oh god promised
[1:19:45] me this son this boy
[1:19:47] abraham had a deep revelation that god
[1:19:50] had a plan beyond their generation
[1:19:54] god had a plan
[1:19:57] to bring forth the promised son
[1:20:01] the word can't return void the seed was
[1:20:03] destined to come from isaac
[1:20:06] the promise didn't stop with isaac's
[1:20:08] birth it started amen
[1:20:11] a lineage was beginning
[1:20:13] so now you see here by faith you could
[1:20:16] say it by faith
[1:20:19] abraham preserved the seed
[1:20:22] you will allow me to take that liberty
[1:20:25] by underneath the anointing and the
[1:20:27] revelation of god abraham preserved that
[1:20:30] seed
[1:20:31] by sacrificing it
[1:20:36] testifying of christ when he would
[1:20:38] stretch his arms on the cross preserving
[1:20:41] the seed that's probably part three in
[1:20:44] case you were wondering
[1:20:47] so the lineage begins with isaac and
[1:20:48] next comes jacob
[1:20:53] now when jacob goes and he's fleeing
[1:20:55] from his past
[1:20:57] he's fleeing from his problems which is
[1:20:59] esau
[1:21:03] deceived esau stole the birthright
[1:21:07] fleeing from the mess he had made of his
[1:21:09] life
[1:21:13] you know what jacob didn't stop running
[1:21:15] until he met the angel
[1:21:17] he ran from esau in his home and then he
[1:21:20] ran from laban
[1:21:22] and then he was running again
[1:21:23] from esau
[1:21:25] until he fully surrendered that i will
[1:21:28] not let you go until you bless me
[1:21:31] but here comes jacob the next in the
[1:21:33] line what is god doing god's saying okay
[1:21:35] jacob you're the one
[1:21:37] you're the next one
[1:21:38] that seed has to come down through you
[1:21:41] i need to preserve that seed and you
[1:21:44] have to marry rachel
[1:21:45] rachel is who that seed is going to come
[1:21:47] through benjamin
[1:21:49] that's what i that was god's
[1:21:51] pre-ordained foreordained plan
[1:21:54] so now
[1:21:55] jacob goes to laban
[1:21:58] and
[1:22:00] you can go and find it in the scripture
[1:22:02] but he comes to the to the well and the
[1:22:04] stone is rolled over the well
[1:22:07] the stone is is rolled over the top he
[1:22:10] can't get to the water
[1:22:12] they had watered their sheep and they
[1:22:14] rolled it back
[1:22:15] and
[1:22:16] it's confusing for me personally but it
[1:22:18] sounds like the guys that were there
[1:22:20] weren't the stone back either
[1:22:22] and here comes rachel i don't know how
[1:22:24] heavy this stone was but here comes
[1:22:25] rachel with her flock
[1:22:27] rachel's
[1:22:28] jacob sees rachel and this something
[1:22:31] inside of him just explodes
[1:22:34] wow
[1:22:36] i love this girl
[1:22:38] when god saw you before the foundation
[1:22:41] of the world something exploded inside
[1:22:43] of him
[1:22:44] and he said this is my bride
[1:22:48] saints of god
[1:22:50] so what did christ do what did jacob do
[1:22:53] he says he rolled that stone away from
[1:22:55] the top of the well
[1:22:56] he rolled that stone away so that rachel
[1:22:59] could access life-giving water
[1:23:02] in order for that seed to continue to
[1:23:04] fruition the well needed to be open but
[1:23:07] the stone had to be rolled away saints
[1:23:10] of god the stone had to be rolled away
[1:23:13] so that christ could come amen and bring
[1:23:16] to us a well of living water however
[1:23:18] many years hundreds of years later jesus
[1:23:22] sits by one of jacob's wells
[1:23:25] john chapter 4 verse 7-15 if you want to
[1:23:28] write it down for reference he's sitting
[1:23:30] at the well his disciples have gone into
[1:23:32] town to collect some lunch there it is
[1:23:36] oh say to god
[1:23:38] the stone wasn't rolled over the well
[1:23:40] naturally
[1:23:42] the stone was rolled over this woman's
[1:23:44] well spiritually
[1:23:46] and she comes to the well
[1:23:48] the time of day when only women like her
[1:23:50] were allowed
[1:23:54] and he says
[1:23:55] can i have a drink
[1:23:59] john 4 7. i'm going to return there
[1:24:06] now jacob's well was there jesus
[1:24:08] therefore being weary with his journey
[1:24:10] sat thus on the well and it was about
[1:24:12] the sixth hour
[1:24:13] the man was weary
[1:24:16] there come with the woman of samaria to
[1:24:17] draw water jesus saith unto her give me
[1:24:19] to drink
[1:24:20] then say at the moment of samaria unto
[1:24:22] him how is it that thou being a jew
[1:24:23] asses drink of me which i'm a woman of
[1:24:26] samaria
[1:24:27] for the jews have no dealings with
[1:24:29] samaritans jesus answered and said unto
[1:24:30] her if thou knewest the gift
[1:24:32] of god
[1:24:34] see there it is again saints the gift
[1:24:38] what is it that you put upon the altar
[1:24:39] the gift
[1:24:42] you put your gift upon the altar gideon
[1:24:44] put his gift upon the altar so he says
[1:24:46] if you knew the gift of god
[1:24:48] and who it is that saith to thee give me
[1:24:50] drink thou would have asked of him and
[1:24:52] he would have given thee living water
[1:24:55] jesus sitting there
[1:24:57] the rest of the world saw a harlot
[1:25:00] a woman of ill feign
[1:25:03] but something in jesus exploded
[1:25:05] because he saw his bride
[1:25:13] and he began to talk to her
[1:25:16] and he said
[1:25:17] the woman said unto him sir thou hast
[1:25:19] nothing to draw with and the well is
[1:25:21] deep from whence then hast thou that
[1:25:24] living water art are greater than our
[1:25:26] father jacob who gave us the well and
[1:25:28] drank thereof himself and his children
[1:25:30] as his and his cattle jesus answered and
[1:25:32] said unto her whosoever drinks it of
[1:25:34] this water shall
[1:25:35] shall thirst
[1:25:38] again but whosoever drinketh all the
[1:25:41] water that i shall give him shall never
[1:25:43] thirst but the water that i shall give
[1:25:44] him shall be in him a well of water
[1:25:46] springing up
[1:25:48] into eternal life
[1:25:51] and the woman says unto him sir give me
[1:25:53] this water that i thirst not neither
[1:25:55] come hither to draw jesus says in her go
[1:25:58] call my husband and come hither
[1:26:03] you see
[1:26:04] there was a connection there
[1:26:08] why didn't he pick the next harlot
[1:26:12] why didn't he show up the day before
[1:26:16] because the day before she was sick at
[1:26:17] home didn't make it to the well that day
[1:26:22] yes i made that up
[1:26:26] but it was that day that time
[1:26:31] and he said let me give you a drink
[1:26:34] and then you begin to open up to her her
[1:26:37] past
[1:26:38] yes
[1:26:39] and call her by name
[1:26:43] and she became a lively stone yes sir
[1:26:47] not hewn by man's design but a natural
[1:26:51] stone
[1:26:52] picked from the side of the road
[1:26:55] put to good use
[1:27:03] two altars
[1:27:05] amen
[1:27:07] jacob
[1:27:08] israel
[1:27:12] but when jacob caught a revelation
[1:27:19] that's when he became israel
[1:27:22] and that's when his altar was built
[1:27:24] of lively stones
[1:27:31] god had a seed to preserve in you
[1:27:36] so he musicians want to come tonight god
[1:27:39] had a seed in you to preserve man has
[1:27:42] tried to fix you
[1:27:46] man has tried to cut new stones for your
[1:27:48] altar you've tried to cut new stones for
[1:27:52] your altar
[1:27:54] but
[1:27:54] all it leaves behind is a
[1:27:57] an altar built of dead stones
[1:28:01] but we want to build be an altar built
[1:28:04] of lively stones
[1:28:06] because saints of god when an altar is
[1:28:08] built of lively stones
[1:28:12] then you ask
[1:28:14] through surrender
[1:28:17] the fire comes down
[1:28:20] and you have victory
[1:28:24] is it fire like mount carmel sometimes
[1:28:27] i find
[1:28:28] in the short time that i've been on this
[1:28:30] earth it's
[1:28:31] usually not
[1:28:33] because it's
[1:28:34] what what did elijah do he i think it
[1:28:36] was from there he went to the cave on
[1:28:39] mount horeb
[1:28:41] [Music]
[1:28:42] same mountain that elisha used but the
[1:28:44] verb says elisha had a spot out there to
[1:28:45] pray he went there on full moon and
[1:28:47] sunday i think it was or the new moon or
[1:28:48] something like that
[1:28:50] up there praying elijah hiding out
[1:28:52] scared
[1:28:53] [Music]
[1:28:54] thunder lightning
[1:28:57] fire wait god just came as a fire
[1:29:00] but this time it wasn't the fire it was
[1:29:03] a still small voice
[1:29:05] you see i i've been praying lord lately
[1:29:08] help me be more attentive to that still
[1:29:10] small voice
[1:29:11] sometimes we i i feel led to do things
[1:29:14] and and uh i oh that's probably just me
[1:29:18] and i
[1:29:19] by god's grace
[1:29:22] hopefully in the future
[1:29:23] when that happens we stop and we say
[1:29:25] well maybe that's you lord
[1:29:29] what if you're jesus what if you're
[1:29:31] that the next one
[1:29:33] at the well
[1:29:34] [Music]
[1:29:36] when that
[1:29:37] tattooed hippie comes walking up
[1:29:40] [Music]
[1:29:45] you know where where we are what we
[1:29:47] experience in our lives we we tend to
[1:29:49] take that and say
[1:29:51] everybody or all these people
[1:29:54] but it's just who you've
[1:29:56] been
[1:29:57] exposed to
[1:29:59] people have a tendency good people have
[1:30:01] a tendency good
[1:30:03] holy ghost people to just be like oh
[1:30:06] that homosexual
[1:30:10] [Music]
[1:30:12] they're no different in god's eyes
[1:30:15] than a liar
[1:30:16] because sin is sin since when since when
[1:30:18] did we start saying one sins worse than
[1:30:20] the other that's not from the bible
[1:30:23] sin is sin
[1:30:26] before god saved you guess what you were
[1:30:28] just as bad as that homosexual
[1:30:30] oh you were a man man you rode a bike
[1:30:33] but you were just as bad as him
[1:30:37] i don't know why i picked that example
[1:30:39] that's free i guess
[1:30:41] um
[1:30:42] but we are a chosen generation
[1:30:45] and we are a word of this generation and
[1:30:48] if your altar is built
[1:30:50] of lively stones
[1:30:53] the fire of god will be burning in that
[1:30:56] altar
[1:30:58] and when the fire is burning in your
[1:31:00] life
[1:31:01] you shed light to the world around you
[1:31:04] so if your fire's out
[1:31:07] check the wood
[1:31:08] if it's okay check your altar
[1:31:11] see are you building with lively stones
[1:31:14] or have along the way you cut a stone to
[1:31:18] fit

[1:31:21] because a cut stone to fit
[1:31:24] pollutes the whole thing that's right
[1:31:26] pollutes the whole you have
[1:31:28] an altar built of 12 stones you have 11
[1:31:31] stones the right way but you have one
[1:31:33] stone that's been cut the whole thing's
[1:31:35] no good
[1:31:38] amen lord willing if we get an
[1:31:39] opportunity we'll continue this the two
[1:31:42] altars
[1:31:43] i just thought it would best because
[1:31:45] as you saw tonight there was just a lot
[1:31:47] of stuff
[1:31:49] but the lord has a plan
[1:31:52] and whatever whatever is his desire but

[1:32:35] is our altar built lively stones
[1:32:38] well we don't want dead stones mixed in
[1:32:40] there
[1:32:41] father from time to time see we have to
[1:32:43] maintain the altar lord otherwise it
[1:32:46] becomes broken down
[1:32:48] time to time and as we maintain it we
[1:32:49] try to cut a corner
[1:32:51] we try to do it easy although we know
[1:32:54] that has a cost and
[1:32:56] we try to fit a stone in there that
[1:32:57] doesn't belong father but lord help us
[1:33:00] to go back
[1:33:01] tonight in prayer
