giving my life way laying it down on the [Music] alt now I'm giving my life away the very least I can offer is my own so here I stand today giving my life away no earthly price could be too great no sacrifice too much to make no way of man measuring the cost next to the blood of C's cross so if I live I live for him or if I die I count it gain my life is not my own but his is from this day on and now I'm giving my life away laying it down on the altar now I'm giving my life away the very least I can offer is my [Music] own so here I stand today giving my life away let say that one more time and now I'm giving my life away laying it down on the altar now I'm giving my life away the very least I can offer [Music] is I Stay and today giving my life away amen isn't it beautiful the Lord gives us this opportunity to just be able to come and just literally give our life away but really what we're doing we're not just simply giving it away but we're giving it back amen we came from him and the word says we go to him and so in that we realize that we have just this lovely opportunity of um giving it back to him well pray for my iPad here I keep pushing on my sermon and it goes to a different sermon amen amen well praise the Lord good to be here tonight is it not amen just to be as Sons and Daughters of God gathered together with family and uh just a beautiful time let's just stand as we would go into this scripture tonight I want to say thank you brother Alex I really enjoyed that and uh musicians thank you so much for the beautiful music the gift that God has given you to share uh we sure appreciate that amen appreciate each one of you coming out tonight I know the little sickness bug has been you know moving around trying to afflict us and I just um uh uh you know myself just kind of sometimes you know you just as you're working or doing you just suddenly kind of just don't feel good and boy you just have to stop and it's pretty easy to say oh I'm going to be sick but it's a lot harder but more fruitful to say I rebuke this in the name of Jesus Christ and we thank the Lord for the opportunity and uh tonight I trust that I can express this in a in a correct fashion I hope it's encouraging amen I have been studying the sermon thirst and I would encourage you Brother David as I was sharing the other day I I said oh ien and brother David's like wow me too and and uh so I would encourage you to go it's very straightforward uh but the thing is the the very bride of Christ that's the beauty of the Bride is that even when she has to say outou she says thank you right on the heels she's never like I can't deal with this she's like thank you Lord I Need needed to hear that and I believe the sermon thirst is right along that line he he talks about uh a lot of things very directly and I believe that it really is is a a an outstanding sermon in the sense that let's forget about denomination let's forget about everybody else out there uh he's just reminding you and I that when we have a thirst amen it wasn't for Leo to seea to satisfy it wasn't for you know uh some other thing you know know sometimes uh you know I kind of jokingly put this sometimes you know uh we hear the word maybe in our household of retail therapy and um you know sometimes we do things that just kind of we do it because we kind of feel good about doing it right and um you know the thing is the bride of Christ she she just worships the Lord she comes to the house of God she reads her Bible she gives praise to him because it makes her feel good and we're not talking about emotional feel good but something down in the soul that says that's the truth thank you Lord I needed to hear that that is good and brother Brown talks in the sermon thirst about feeding our soul and if we don't feed our soul he uses that natural example if you don't eat you die if you don't drink you die and uh and then he's saying you know what we need to be eating on the word we need to be drinking the word cuz that's where our life is at so I've been influenced by that Sermon Just a Little Bit let's turn in our Bibles uh I just want to go to Hebrews 5 and8 through 14 which we uh the last time I preached on a Wednesday we use this very scripture and we just want to expand or move on in in this thought a little bit um uh the overall thought of stepping out but tonight I have a question mark for you where is the proof so you know the world wants to know where the proof of all this is they want everything to be proven and you know sometimes we somebody' say where's the proof and maybe our first thought would be to go to the Bible we turn to Malachi 4 then we turn to Revelations 10:7 now my brother and sister those are very relevant to us but there's another proof which I pray the Lord will help us tonight to touch on that is a very evidence of a message that is real it's true it's power powerful it's effective and it's ours amen Hebrews 58-14 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation to all that obey him that's verse n is our verse amen called of God a highest priest after the order of MDC of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing you are dull of hearing and when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age and I say thank you Lord even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil amen Lord we ask blessings on your word in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated and I made this comment the other day and I make it again my brother and sister that one of the very essence of this is the fact that it is of reason of use now if we just have the word of God and we just look at it and we say okay we have the message we have it on a shelf we have it a library we have it on CDs we have it on a thumb drive we we have it however uh it won't be any good unless we use it that's right amen and and you know you can have uh uh I I I I take this as an example just recently I get many uh many uh text email stuff about auctions and uh you know recently there's a gentleman and uh and uh Eagle that um had quite a extensive uh carpentry tools he had planers and joiners and all of these very nice very nice tools and and I noticed that in that flyer it said um these tools are in presstine condition only been used a couple times and so you know you look at that and you Ponder why would a man spend probably close to $150 $200,000 on all kinds of woodworking tools and only use it twice and I you know believe it or not I could recognize that I thought that's a man just like me you know I I I want to own this tool and then it turns out that all the grand plans I had didn't come to pass but we see my brother and sister that it is given to us to use amen and so this word that has come in this hour is not for us to set and hope that it is effective hope it would get us in a Rapture hope it'll help us overcome but it's right there for us to use and to take them and pick it up and in the time of trouble you know I I know it's a simple thought but remember those stones that were there in the streamed for David were predestinated Stones he didn't just accidentally pick up a stone and we'll look at that in all the types that are there you know five it goes along ways and we don't want to expound upon that but my brother and sister one of those five is trust amen and so it was there that not only did he have faith in what God had given him amen and it was our Lord Lord Jesus Christ that anointed him but he had to trust that what God was leading him to do was the correct thing and that's where we're at today we simply have to trust the Lord because sometimes our thinking will not be able to comprehend the path that God is taking us down but it's God's path not your path and we just need to trust him and so I was speaking on maturity a little bit on the last Wednesday I spoke and we'll look at this my brother and sister to recognize what maturity does for us and how that immaturity uh it causes a change in our life it it it uh it it brings responsibilities that sometimes can be quite weighty quite heavy but if we look in 1 Corinthians 13 and9 uh through 13 uh 1 Corinthians 13 9-13 for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away so in other words a full Revelation comes to the bride of Christ will no longer live in a partial Revelation we'll no longer live under just what little bit and if I can be just blunt and bold my brother and sister and that is what took you and I of this glorious message and the respect that we have for a prophet of God but that's what took us Beyond looking just at the prophet and took us into the fullness of the message amen the revelation of Jesus Christ brother brandham said the fullness of it amen was all so we are here today can I explain all of Jesus Christ no but we as a group collectively and as individuals are moving in that revelation we are not just stopped and saying well God sent a prophet but we're moving we're coming into more maturity every day every step every challenge whether we feel like we failed or whether we felt Victorious amen whether we felt weak or whether we felt courageous we are moving further into the maturity of the revelation of Jesus Christ it is not just as you wake up and got a revelation this Revelation is coming by a how do I word that same way Jesus got it by the things you suffer I wished it was otherwise I wished I could go to bed tonight pray a prayer as before I lay my head on the pillow and wake up tomorrow morning with greater Revelation but you know sometimes sometimes things happen and it brings a little something out of you that you thought had died years ago I had one of those events today brother Sergey and I won't explain it I'll just have to tell you that I went from being upset to apologizing in what seemed like 30 seconds because the minute I got upset I realized I was wrong and the Holy Spirit dealt with my heart and I had to apologize and it's a big story it's a complicated story and I won't go into it but I'll just tell you that God doesn't have to take days weeks months and years to bring our heart back to the place it's supposed to be sometimes it's just a matter of a moment that he speaks with us deals with us and we realize I'm wrong and I need to reverse course and you know what's funny is because we as humans we talk about well that person's really proud but usually the guy who's saying or the person who's saying they're really proud is quite proud himself amen because he's able to express his pride about their pride amen and so God knows how to bring us into a position that causes us to change course and my brother and sister the difference I I I want to simplify it the difference of that kind of behavior avior Is Anchored In maturity that's right amen I remember a few years ago we were preaching at a church and there was an individual at that church that cometh after the service and said um I have carried this particular burden and they named the time it was quite a span a decade uh and uh this is what it's done to me it's killed my prayer life I can't hardly read the Bible but I'm condemned not convicted condemned so we know this is the devil amen and all of these things and and my simple question that I could that just come to me I said why sister would you even bother to carry this burden and she said I honestly I don't know but you see when she said I'm finished with this burden I'm finished with this you could sense a presence around her immediately Saints not in a week two month we we only visit this place uh ever so rare and it wasn't it was right there she had a release and she got deliverance from that amen and you know this sister brother Lonnie Jenkins had emphasized this years ago a little research he had done uh shared it with me uh and you know that bitterness and disease are Partners they are friends and when you have bitterness in your life you have unfulfilled amen is really what a bitterness is it's an unfulfilled uh issue that is there you you you are upset for a variety of reasons it's never settled it's unfulfilled and that eats away at the Spirit of humanity and disease follows that and brother Lonnie had quite a case study that he had done and this was not out here at some hospital or whatever he said it was in the message he did his research and that's pretty blunt isn't it to just just say I followed the lives of people and people that went through very harsh things and they would come and say Lord forgive me he didn't blame it on the other person he said forgive me Lord he said they went on in Victory and joy and happiness but others were caught in this realm of everything that's happened in my life is their fault and that was there that would eat them up and I say God help each and every one of us just to be able to let these things go you might be 100% right you might be the one absolutely standing in the word but is killing you not them and we're not called to be bound even though we're right we find Liberty and say Lord I let it go I just give this away I let it go from me tonight that I can find Liberty in my life amen and we see this Liberty that God desires and so when the perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things amen so let us take that scripture and take that as our uh uh uh motivation to step into a new realm to step into a new position to say you know what I'm going to just step into my rightful position of maturity in the word of God now my brother and sister maturity is what gives us the ability Amen to really take a hold of the word and put it to work amen amen now not to take away I know many a young man that worked hard from his youth amen so we're not talking that but sometimes it is even the ability to do is needs to be tempered with the maturity of what needs to be done so we can have ability as it were to say I know what to do here but wisdom is a greater portion amen and so we must know what it is to to do and so we put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know imp part but then shall I know even also I am known this word known in this context means to be recognized right you know what I want to be recognized as a Christian I don't even particularly like being recognized as Pastor I'm just a brother I'm just a sinner saved by grace I'm just a man but I do want to be identified as a real Christian amen cuz the office of Pastor could be temporal but I don't want my position as a Christian to be temporal I want it to be permanent like Eternal amen taking me right into the presence of God and so it's there that we know H as also I am known so what we want is to be able to project this but this even goes a little bit deeper in the identity of being known as a son or daughter of God because the word Christian is a very convoluted definition in the day we live in it is a definition is used uh very broadly but when you come down to be clearly identified as Sons and Daughters of God it is a very specific thing right amen nobody's going to mistake uh uh you know your children to be my children I joke with my daughter jool ly she's not here to defend herself she might be Liv listening but I joke with her sometimes I I I don't know when you were born I'm not sure you were you were you were my daughter and she just looks at me and does this right here okay there's evidence but you see my brother and sister take that through the word the devil's going to tell you you're not a son you're not a daughter but there's identification there's evidence evence of where we belong and where we came from and where we're going back to there's evidence my brother and sister so we would look at this and we would wonder where is the proof the proof is here the proof is actually here tonight in our presence who we are and how we've been identified it wasn't some random guess it wasn't accident that we were there but clearly identifyed because we have the very nature and attributes of our father it's not an accident of who we are amen hallelujah and so as we look at this now we look at this uh we see our young people slightly at disadvantage I guess because they just all they've known is the message but my brother and sister those of us are a little older and hopefully our young people can really just view this and look through all the fog of time to realize this is not just how happen stances is not just hey this is where I'm at but to realize that just as it was for those of us who are a little older and the recognition that's there that they themselves can see my path has been already directed I have already been called to walk this path and there is as it were footsteps already there for me to follow I don't need to wonder where should I go all I need to do is surrender and follow amen you know they say that's what makes a good soldier amen you can be the best the strongest the whatever of it is but you won't be a good soldier until you learn to follow amen amen you have to be able to walk in the right steps and so there's a time of change sir I think those of you who are slightly older you'll recognize what I'm talking about we have been in the message for many years we have seen many things but we are sensing is that okay to use that word we are sensing a change absolutely there is no longer just hey we're going to go to church we're going to read the message we're going to hear the message we're going to read our Bible my brother and sister there's a lot of people do that but there is something in the bride of Christ she's sensing a changing of the current a changing of the atmosphere something's moving her something's stirring her she's not just about going to church it's part of the word of God I tell you I'm going to speak a little blunt on this we got people that got ideas amen we we you know we we don't need to go to church we'll just sit and listen to a tape good people people I would just love I love them but my brother and sister it's not the word that's the word doesn't say stay home the word says don't forsake the assembling of yourself together amen now like I said I'm going to speak a little direct huge emphasis coming Reviving again on the return Ministry brother brandom coming back my brother and sister so the return Ministry it's making another roote another push but I'm here to tell you tonight it never left it don't need to return back cuz it never left this ministry has never left the prophet of God his own word said it's the Holy Ghost and it's the Holy Ghost that's in me that is in you those are his words amen that Ministry has never left it don't need to come back amen some people they're looking for a deal and my brother and sister we all know that shortcuts don't work there's no such thing as a shortcut but we are no longer a helpless people can we say Amen tonight we're no longer a helpless people true spiritual maturity brings a trust in US amen now my brother and sister where we couldn't trust before we needed something really concrete maturity is bringing a trust in US Absolutely I'll speak of my last conversation with brother Bob he's sitting there apologizing to me brother Paul my mind is wandering I'm sorry there's a pause but one thing I know brother Paul he reached up gripped my hand one thing I know I am his I'll tell you if that was the only revelation we could muster tonight that would be one worthy to hold on to I don't know anything else but I know I'm his Hallelujah I just about started crying sitting there because I thought you know what when I get to be older and I'm getting ready of time terries I'm getting ready to cross over that is a words I want to be able to speak I know I'm his right that takes spiritual maturity none of this I I hope maybe no forget it I know amen but we as a bride are no longer a helpless people I remember the time now let me just throw this out sorry I don't mean to sound aggressive tonight but I remember a time you know that in the church I grew up in being Pastor sometimes I feel actually bad being your pastor CU sometimes I go whole weeks my phone never rings nobody's calling up saying what color of car should I buy nobody's you know what what we do what do we do you see there's a change has come in the bride she's no longer the one at Communion time that they're running all over the church apologizing for everything under the Sun but there's a maturity that's come that they deal with what when the Holy Spirit deals with them and they realiz I maybe stepped over the line they they're not ashamed amen what is that that's the killing of our flesh that's a killing of who we are and submitting it to the word of God that we could stop and say I'm sorry amen it's not that big a word but it's sure hard for people to do and so my brother and sister it is there that as a helpless people we used to need answers imagine if the prophet was on the scene forget about what his age would be you decide I need to go see the prophet they would have one of those little things like they have in the store take a number and you would pull that off of there and it would be something like 49 1,862 come back in 12 months because people would constantly say there's the answer he's the prophet I want it direct from him but we have it direct you bet we do we have it direct all we got to do is wait on the Lord amen we don't have to sit down at a desk across the desk amen the word has been given out let me use the word dispensed it's been put out here we're not waiting waiting and the people have come to a place that maturity they're not in need to always have an answer they realized I have a voice that goes to the throne aren't you glad you have a voice to the throne tonight amen that we don't have to run to pastors and evangelist and this and that to get an answer when we can go right to the Lord and get an answer amen straight from the Throne of God and I don't say any of these things my brothers and sister to slight anyone else please don't think of it that way but it's time that we need to come to the maturity to be able to speak of the things that need spoken to face the things that we need to face instead of skirting them amen instead of always just kicking the can down the way we need to face that because what's happening is God is bringing you and I my brother and sister to the day that we're no longer looking out there to find the proof of this message amen we're looking in here finding the proof of this message we're looking in our families we're looking in our own life we can look right in our own assembly we can see the proof that the word of God is true and the day of having the evidence that that God did send a messenger my brother and sister as the prophet himself says if if they don't believe then it's not for them but it is for us amen and we've seen the supernatural amen so what happens we see true spiritual maturity amen being reflected in the body of Christ we're seeing that evidence coming right down as as what it is and my brother and sister there's nothing like we're coming in the springtime and and uh there's nothing like seeing the seed come forth amen amen but the seed can't say in the springtime all the time that's right it has to face the challenges it has to be fertilized watered weeded face the heat be challenged and still produce I got so many analogies at real true things I I I need to just hold back so I don't turn this into a you know a gromy class or something but you see my brother and sister just because it's this tall and it's golden and it has a head on it doesn't mean there's anything inside there that's exactly it doesn't mean that what is in there might well be shriveled from the heat of leysa it will still grow but will never produce the same and the beauty of this is is as we come down into this time we're seeing how that God is pouring a strength into the body of Believers he's pouring strength into you and I that the test that we are facing today we could not have passed 10 years ago but today we're standing here because the maturity is coming and the season for the seed to be brought forth or manifested is upon us and so it's there that seed is reflecting it is the reflection of the atmosphere that is in the body amen and so we see this the seed coming forth now there has to be a likeness I I love this just as I'm studying I hope I'm making sense tonight but you see there has to be a likeness if we have a corn field it's not going to look like wheat if we have a wheat field it's not going to look like kosha you know a Koshi is the big bushy plant you know that takes over everything if you give it time they're you know five or six feet tall and just grow like a tree you know if they was if kosher was a real crop I'd be rich but we spend all this time getting those things do you know what the Kosh is in your life I want you to stop and ponder it tonight for just a moment what is the thing that's constantly trying to outgrow everything in your life did you know in the message thirst brother brandham uh speaks very direct but I just want to tell you this kosha will live on less water than wheat kosha will live in poorer ground than wheat kosha will live under every circumstance that wheat won't if I could be straightforward tonight we need to stop and examine what is the kosher in our life and we need to deal with that because it will outgrow everything in our life it will take over and that's not what we're here for we're not here to to be you know as it is uh uh U Ultra this or Ultra that but we are to be the seed coming forth and there has to be a likeness appearing and and I love this my brother and sister because when you look at the word of God and you realize what a likeness looks like what what the significance All Through the Bible of the likeness amen talking about image and talking about likeness and talking about all of this through the scripture you realize that the church itself the body of Believers cannot look like something else she has to look like Christ she has to look like the word she can't look like denomination she can't look like a a self denomination you know the sad thing about it is there's so many denominations in the message actually there's thousands of denominations in the message but they're just individual or maybe even a family cuz this is how we see it and I don't want to sound crass or uncaring tonight but I don't care how you see it what does the word say Amen cuz we can get an image uh the prophet of God said you know what you you don't use any man for an example only the Lord Jesus Christ is our example amen and we look at that around us and there's great men and we look to those and I've been guilty in my own self through the years when I first started preaching I I can remember you know here and let me just throw it out here brother Donnie forgive me but imagine my brother and sister how many Donnie Reagans there are in the world Amen they want to walk they want to talk they want to preach they want to have that kind of Bulldog confidence to go out and say devil but my brother and sister there's only one brother Donnie and maybe people don't know it but I hear it from good report that this is a man that even out in the woods hunting spends more time in prayer than he does hunting you see we maybe don't want to actually be just like someone else because maybe their standard might be higher than we can live but if we'll set a standard and our likeness would be the Lord Jesus Christ he he will take us through every challenge every battle and we won't get weary we won't quit we won't get discouraged we'll just keep pressing on because that's who we were created in the image of amen amen so we see this I hope I'm making sense tonight amen see the word has to take on a living form and this is actually way deeper than this I'm sorry I'm condensing it down so so small tonight but the word see has to take on a living form you see the word says it's Resurrection Life so it has to take on the form of life it's not just about something being raised up as an image amen you go we were there in Belgium I I believe the girls went and and toured some of those places you can go into some of those churches and just like brother brandom said they've rubbed the feet and the hands right off of those statues it didn't change one thing in their life but when we can come into the image of a living God Amen when the image that we're molded to is a living God then there is life there you don't have to rub the hand off amen you can receive the blessing of the word because he was the word amen and so it has to have a living form now we can talk right the scripture talks about a dead letter now we can talk about a dead letter all we want to talk about a dead letter but that dead letter will not help you and I my brother sister and I want to challenge you tonight to not let the message of the hour become dead letter to us when we read it it shouldn't be by root that I I need to at least consume a tape or two a week I need to do this or that it needs to be lived if H this is opinion okay I want to just clarify this this is opinion if it takes you a month to get through a message then glean every nugget there is out of that message not be able to say I read 25 30 sermons last year why don't you just have confidence to say I made it through one sermon in months but I tell you what I got to glean every nugget right out of that amen hallelujah my brother and sister it's it's real amen it has to have a living form you know that Revelation is a living form amen if you have a dead Revelation that means somebody taught it to you right but when Revelation is alive it starts to produce and you can see the very life of Revelation in somebody I don't want to sound super spiritual tonight but I tell you my brother and sister you can tell when people are in the word you can tell when they've been digging and eating and drinking and it's become their life you can see that in themen I don't want to have a form of godliness no sir I want godliness amen and real godliness is Christ Jesus amen so healing is a living form right if someone has you know something uh our sister Elena Bots and the brother Matthew Watkins testimony if you're familiar with that were they witness to that black Minister about that and and then there it is a few months down the road he's perfectly healthy my brother and sister healing has a life amen amen it's death even death even cancer has a certain life but you can starve the life out of cancer you realize that science realizes that they can do certain things that will starve that's why sugar not my bandwagon I love sugar sugar has been my friend since I was about this big sometimes I still think it's my friend but you see cancer feeds on sugar yes sir so the things we struggle with what are they feeding on Lord help us amen Lord help us the devil cannot live in the presence of the Holy Ghost there's nothing there for the devil to feed on because it's not his diet it's the word that takes and cast him out that's right amen so he can't feed on that amen faith has to have a living form amen when we have a dead Faith which people you say how do you have a dead Faith well a dead faith is a faith we talk about but it doesn't have a life to move anything so if you have a dead Faith where you oh God's A Healer God's a savior God's a deliver God's this God's that but there's no life in there to bring it to pass then you literally have a dead faith and you can apply the name to anything my brother and sister but it has evidence that it's alive can you say Amen the time that you have been prayed up you're on fire for God things that just you will just say nope out of my way Satan but when you're down and you're feeling alone you feel you know maybe depressed or feel whatever it is there that same thing becomes a mountain in our life but Faith real Faith amen and now I want you to remember what the prophet of God said he said that Faith's already in you that's right amen so you don't have to go find Faith amen you just got to let the word release it in you amen so you know what it's not a theory it's real living amen a form that is there when I say a form I just mean as Faith would would if I could say it's embodied it's substance that's good word thank you brother David substance and and we're we're there it's a body my brother and sister and have you ever I don't know if you ever have I prayed for people in prayer lines in South America that when certain people would come they weren't there for themselves they were for someone else they were for sometimes I I prayed for uh I prayed with it turns out a sister one time that it was her natural sister just went in the prayer line before me and that sister had a disease and it's there and then Here Comes her natural sister but her sister also in Christ saying I'm not here for myself I'm for my sister and I want to pray that I can have more faith that I can share that Faith with her as an influence in her life and my brother and sister we had a real Jubilee we had a time my wife will remember it is a time that she wondered what was going on cuz people came to the prayer line two or three times sister Jerry's like what are they doing my husband's thrashed out ready to claps on the floor but I tell you every one of those God was working and God did work amen there was a time there that there was Supernatural power taking place because Faith was living faith was in that church amen Faith was in those Believers and it was being manifested and when the chains were broke off you realize my brother and sister brother Brown talks about Johnny Crow time up leaving there long enough untime and he's been trained to only go so far God help us my brother and sister may the Holy Spirit move through Grace Tabernacle and help us to realize we've been set free and we can go further than we ever thought we could go we can go all the way in the word of God not just as far as we been trained to or experienced before but we can move out amen and if old Johnny Crow ever figured out that he actually could fly again he would have been gone but he was so conditioned to stay there right where he was at and the devil's trying to do that to you and I tonight condition us to only go so far amen you see this is not a theory no sir it is we we deal in quite a few things that are theories right come on theoretically every seed that you plant will grow reality is you'll be lucky if 90 92 or 3% % of it grows I want you to know that you're in the 90 2 or 3% you're you're not the seed that was planted to Wither on the roadside amongst the rocks and amongst the thorns and whatever else but you was anointed called of God by the word to be one that grows amen now let's turn to 2 Corinthians 3:17 and 18 I need to hurry along here amen now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty now I want you to understand when I I'm preaching with some enthusias I'm I'm excited I've been thinking about this for a bit how you worship is up to you I just hope that you're worshiping in Liberty that's it Liberty doesn't mean that you got to jump up and run all around the church jump on top the pews scream do any of that if you want to you're welcome but it doesn't mean you have to to have Liberty in Christ amen am and so it's there often times we'll come to church and and maybe you can say Amen if this is true for you we can come to church with a burden and you know in the service when that burden lifted amen we don't need somebody to come out and by almost like discernment you know brother or sister I I believe that that burden Has Lifted from me you can say I know that I felt it leave see we we don't need somebody as it were almost like prophesying over us to to do that we're going to come to church and burdens are going to be lifted the word promises it let's just believe the word trust the Lord let that word come alive in us amen now where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as glass the glory of the Lord and changed into the same image come on my brother and sister we're not changed in the image of the message as it were or the image of Pastor or the image of this or the image that everybody thinks we should be but we're changed into the image of the Lord amen Allelujah the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord that's what the Holy Ghost wants to do we don't need to have the Holy Ghost just so we can tell everybody we have the Holy Ghost we want to have the Holy Ghost that it will come and move us amen put life in these bones that we can go out and it doesn't sound super spiritual I'm sorry but we can go out and live the life of Jesus Christ out there it's easy to do it in here that's it well maybe it isn't always easy to do it in here but you know what I'm saying but I want to have that that I can live it out there amen I want the Holy Ghost not to leave me just as a vocabulary but I want to know it in power and Liberty to be able to live an overcoming life in the day that we live in amen see I I want my brother and sister let me just put it this way you want to see the Lord's desire expressed you don't need to look any further you want to see the Holy Ghost In Action you don't need to look any further are you with me you want to see overcoming power you don't need to look any further amen you want to see the supernatural you don't need to look any further you want to have faith you don't need to look any further every bit of it's in the word and the word of God says it's already in you you because he has come and poured himself into you and he didn't strain it out he didn't strain Faith out he didn't strain Supernatural out he didn't strain this out and that out and then give you a portion it's already in you and it's already in expression in our lives but it's our reflection my brother and sister that he's trying to bring that we would look like him amen not look like a religious person not look like a sadducee or Pharisee not to look like whatever but my brother and sister that we look like him because he's pouring himself into us and the more that you pour into it you know my brother and sister I've got so many analogies tonight I I just will restrain myself amen why why do you say that brother Paul because your desire to serve the Lord your desire of the Holy Ghost your desire of overcoming power power your desire of the supernatural your desire to see Faith expressed is all part of the image of Christ now the word said we'd be made in His image don't be shocked when these things start showing up in your life and don't be shocked when the devil does his very best to throw a old wet towel over it to try and stop you because see you were called to be that expression if God wanted a different expression in this day my brother and sister we would be able to look out now I'm going to just be blunt do you think that we need to run around the the church we need to have those things to have the Holy Ghost do we have to speak in tongues to have the Holy Ghost do we have to oh come on we could just go on and on down the list I'll let you fill it in do you have to no the prophet of God himself said that he viewed it as the evidence of the Holy Ghost was receiving all of the word for your hour your day and acting on it my my brother and sister we get up in the morning and we start we start our day acting on it can we can you say amen and we go through the midday acting on it we go through the end of the day acting on it we go to bed acting on it we go to church acting on it we go to the store acting on it my brother and sister we don't need any more proof the proof is sitting right here tonight that the word has come alive and is living in a body of Believers that are taking the word as their absolute and standing in that position we don't need another proof we don't need to find something out of a newspaper article from 65 or 70 years ago we don't need to find some kind of news reel or some kind of film reel or this or that my brother and sister I'll tell you what as much as I appreciate and I have such respect for sister Sarah's parents that we've had lovely conversation my brother and sister they've sat there with in the services of the prophet eyewitnesses of it but I hope this comes out right but I don't need their testimony for proof I Rejoice that they had that experience that God dealt and answered things directly for them but I don't need that proof I have a proof of my own and that was a calling of the word of God in my life and God vindicating to me that he called me as a son that he's made my way before me and he's given me victory and I can stand and when I can't stand he said don't worry I'll carry you oh excuse me I'm getting excited tonight hallelujah amen you know all of this is part of the image imagine we could all be Peter what part of Peter do you remember we're in Israel we come right down here here's a statue of Peter and the rooster and I looked at that and I thought you know that's interesting because someone took the time to carve in marble or whatever that was Peter and the rooster to them that's who Peter was but to the bride of Christ Peter was the rock of Revelation not in Peter he was given Keys a place that the bride of Christ could anchor down and given keys to that Kingdom he would be able to open these things up and see the word of God that's how I want to choose to remember Peter as a man filled and given Keys amen not a not a coward not a man who denied Christ not a man that's commemorated in a statue with a chicken no sir we went to that what did they call that there on on the shore Galilee with the stone that church where the girl sang I can't remember the name of that church but I tell you my brother and sisters see you get there and it's a shrine to the Catholic church and Etc but it's very moving because you're right there realize okay there's another Peter besides the one with the rooster in the story another Peter that God had my brother and sister there's another story about our life it's not the one the devil wants to do it's not the one that the critic wants it's the one that God said I'll give you proof that this word will deliver in this day amen this is keeping power on display amen now do we need to go find the great spiritual men in the message to say there's keeping power on display and I'm telling you my brother and sister a lot of non names amen are being kept just as long as those whose names are recognized around the world there's a lot of you might call them nobodies that are living overcoming life got faith God's hearing their prayers they're seeing healings take place deliverances take place and nobody on Earth knows them but they're just as much the word on display and manifest as anyone else on the Earth today there is the proof the proof is here tonight hallelujah hallelujah now look in John 14 amen I'll just jump right there to verse 20 I did have a few more verses there but verse 20 that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you now my brother and sister we either either have to believe this word or we just have to rip that page out of our Bible you're in him but what's even more incredible to me he's in us we're standing here today we're able to say the spirit of the Living God but brother Paul I had a bad day I don't care what kind of day you had he didn't say let's see let's reread this amen uh and at that bad day no I I think I I got that mixed up didn't day he never described what kind of day it would be we know that actually it's meaning of an end time day but I tell you my brother and sister there's a lot of days that make up the end time day and not every one of them is the most wonderful day for us as humans I thought I'd get an amen out of that one amen so you know but you it don't matter this blows up that quits working this happens that fails no matter right you're in him that's it he's in you that's what we got to look at my brother and sister it and you know I use the phrase the wheels fall off the wagon well what if the wheels fell off Your Wagon every single day after a while you would get discouraged because you would run out of Wheels to put on the wagon but he would still be in you so we could stop in that day and rejoice and say thank you Lord for saving my soul thank you for the word of the hour thank you for life cuz he didn't put put a number on there that's right of how many bad days you could have or how many good days you could have and I I'll just put this phrase out here my brother and sister it's been just hang hanging with me my brother and sister the the Hedge around job you know the devil wanted inside that hedge but he couldn't get to to job and God just comes and says oh no problem I open the Hedge but I want to tell you this I want to put it out as a statement we should be able to live the same life outside of the Hedge as we lived inside of the Hedge amen we shouldn't have to have God put a hedge around us everywhere we go and everything that we do because the prophet said we have become the word amen and the word is more powerful than anything Satan can say he cannot even move past the word amen let me just second Corin iians 3:2 is ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men you see my brother and sister the very key words right there is written that's right amen and if it's written you realize even on the sheep skin Brother David brought that up on Sunday even on the sheep skin it wasn't just something surface you realize they cut the word into the sheep skin how thick is your skin it's permanently etched in you I could tell you about some people who have walked away from the message have shared with their children that they think about it every single day why it's been etched into them amen they can't wash it off they can't take it off it's not a robe that you can discard it's been etched into them and I think if it's etched into them I think God will bring them back myself I believe that God would not have put that so deep in their heart that they could just walk away I don't know let's read out of the seventh Church ages for just a moment we'll be dismissed you all know this quote here or you should let me put it that way a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but God sent Luther with the word the Lutheran spoke for God at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and Creeds and let me tell you in the message thirst brother Braham says you cannot get Creed through the filter of the word that's right so the minute that you have Creed you've just now cut that right out it's done and um anyway so and Creeds and not simple word they could no longer speak for God then God sent Wesley and he was a voice with the word in his day the people who took his Revelation from God became the living Epistles read and known of all men so this was the word their hour that they took my brother and sister we don't need to go back and study everything that Luther preached everything that Wesley preached because you see it was the word and we have the fullness of the word in this hour so you don't have to go back as one man said you know just I'm going to go back and I'm going to learn aramic so that I can get right down to the truth of the word and all the years he will spend learning aramic to find out that there's like 10 12 variations well what's he going to do spend another decade he'll be an old man before he ever finds any kind of thing out of it and by then his head will be so full of creed that he won't be able to get the filter of the word what we need to do is just pray for simple Revelation that's it that's it the people took his Revelation from God become living Epistles read and known of all men for their generation I don't believe these words are by accident sir amen and when the Methodist failed God raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until the last day there is again another people in the land God bless you I'm glad to know those other people amen who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age amen now I want to tell you my brother and sister when you look at that and just realize how precious that is amen that it is uh such a um how how are we going to say this my my I've got so many things going through my mind I only thing I can think of is to say this is a privilege to be part of the final voice to the final age this is not laborious this is not you know something that we stagger under but it is a privilege to be the voice amen along with our Messenger to stand there amen but you know it can get convolute convoluted because I can take you where brother brandham said Jesus Christ is the messenger to this age that's right so we with our messenger now some people say you're putting brother Brown out the picture no I'm not but I want you to see a complete picture amen what God chooses to place a man you know what is the Thunders what are the Thunders I mean we won't speak up my brother and sister because it can get a little complicated but let's just go for the short version God's voice plain and simple whether he uses you or me or brother brandom or some other man or some other woman it's God's voice and God uses who he wants you know so we struggle over these things sometimes you know but God had propit us you know he he chose at that time to use those as his voice my brother and sister and we're here to tell him he can't or shouldn't have or no but did God majure on that no he didn't he used them very specifically and so God's got a voice in you and I are we going to go even my S as a minister are we going to go and then declare this message to the whole world no my brother and sister God sometimes uses us very specific it might be sisters that your voice is spoken in Prophecy and your own house in your own family in your own lives and it's still God's voice we don't go running up and down the street praise God praise God I'm this I'm no sir we recognize when God wants to use you and I he will use you and I let us be willing ready and able to be used whether it's in the dining room whether it's in the backyard whether it's in whatever it is it might be you know we want it by the word but my brother and sister let's not limit ourselves and let's not limit God hallelujah okay now where am I uh yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it its own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her amen I I I you know I've read this so many times through the years but it's becoming more and more real to me that this Bri this bride has a voice my brother and sister she's not just to sit there and and do nothing but she's got a voice that God has given and you want to know where the proof is at it's going to be in the bride CU she's got have a voice and if you got a bride that's got no voice then she's not the bride amen did that make sense I could really expound on that but we don't have time amen he'll confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of Revelation 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from God as that Pentecost but of course the word bride will be repudiated as in the first age in other words even within the realm of this message they want to quiet the voice of the Bride absolutely there's only one voice to hear that's right they want to quiet the bride's voice but my brother and sister a prophet even said this bride would have a voice where is going to be the proof it's going to be right here in the bride and you say wait wait won't it be in the word no my brother and sister it won't be in the word because the word now follow me through the word has to have an expression if the word was still in God's mind and never was spoken there has to be expression amen God chose you and I to be that expression amen sister vaa if you would come musicians I should say hallelujah I hope I made at least a little bit of sense tonight I just a lot of thoughts a lot of thoughts and sometimes I I believe the ministers here here in the church would agree sometimes it's almost dangerous to bottle up that many thoughts because when you go to let them out you want to let them all out at the same time Hallelujah wonderful wonderful Jesus is to me hallelujah amen let's just stand and sing a
