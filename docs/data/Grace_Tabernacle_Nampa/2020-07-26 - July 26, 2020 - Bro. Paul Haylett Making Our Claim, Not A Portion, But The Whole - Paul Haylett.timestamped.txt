[41:16] come up to me and grab me by the arms
[41:19] and looked me in the face
[41:20] so intently and i know it was from the
[41:22] lord because he would speak right to
[41:24] something that i've been maybe
[41:25] struggling a little bit self-esteem
[41:27] confidence etc and he would look me in
[41:30] the face and say just keep doing what
[41:31] you're doing i've been praying and god's
[41:33] been answering my prayers
[41:34] and you know what that does it just
[41:36] boosts us up and you know

[41:52] you know i just uh was saw a picture
[41:55] brother bob and sister joanne when they

[41:58] and i thought my she's she's a beautiful
[42:02] lady and
[42:03] my brothers and sisters through all
[42:04] these years now she's to me
[42:06] more beautiful than she must have been
[42:08] as a young woman
[42:10] all these years in all these
[42:11] opportunities to done anything with
[42:13] their lives
[42:14] but they have just pressed on and tried
[42:17] to do their very best and i believe
[42:19] successful
[42:20] to be a representative of our lord jesus
[42:22] christ so lift them up in prayer amen
[42:25] brother manasseh i know that you
[42:27] probably was not thinking this is how
[42:29] this morning would
[42:30] go but i would like you to come up amen
[42:32] and
[42:34] i just want to invite the young men
[42:38] of our church to come up also brother
[42:40] alex
[42:42] amen gideon
[42:45] sean brother chris if i've left any of
[42:48] you
[42:50] other young men out forgive me
[42:53] but you know there's like a brotherhood
[42:55] that comes
[42:56] amongst young men brother mason amen a
[42:59] brotherhood that comes and
[43:01] see they're rising up through this age
[43:03] now i'm not saying that this age will be
[43:06] any more difficult
[43:07] than it was when i was a young man
[43:09] because the word says the holy ghost is
[43:11] sufficient god's grace is sufficient
[43:14] but we're living in a time that we are
[43:16] not called to go on our own
[43:18] we're not called to isolate ourselves
[43:20] we're called to become part of a body
[43:23] and i would just like to take this
[43:24] moment to encourage us it might be an
[43:26] age difference here
[43:27] brother chris at the top end of the
[43:29] young men
[43:30] amen and some of you gideon
[43:34] sean mason at the bottom of the young
[43:36] men but you see
[43:37] as time goes on these young men will be
[43:40] bonded together if the lord carries
[43:42] another generation forward
[43:45] before his coming these will be the men
[43:48] that give direction and strength to the
[43:50] church
[43:51] our brother manasseh is going off to
[43:53] university my brother and sister
[43:56] it's difficult he'll tell you there's
[43:58] all kinds of struggles all kinds of
[44:00] things that happen there
[44:02] but he'll also tell you that god can lay
[44:04] on your heart that i'm not giving up i'm
[44:06] going to stand on the word i'm going to
[44:07] press to the mark of the high calling
[44:09] and i want us as a church but
[44:11] specifically as these young men
[44:12] to lay hands on our brother manasseh
[44:14] we're going to bless him
[44:16] today you know the word gives us that
[44:18] privilege
[44:19] gives us that opportunity to bless him
[44:23] whatever we bind on earth will be bound
[44:26] in heaven what we loose on earth will be
[44:27] loosed in heaven
[44:28] we've been given the opportunity to
[44:30] bless him not only for success in
[44:33] schools but overcoming power of
[44:34] everything that he faces
[44:36] amen let's just bow our heads as we go
[44:38] before the lord brothers lay your hands
[44:40] upon him
[44:41] heavenly father we just come this
[44:43] morning lord a young man who is very
[44:45] dear to my heart even though lord i
[44:47] don't talk to him near as much as i
[44:49] should
[44:50] father i just hold him father to the
[44:52] highest esteem of a young man
[44:54] desiring to serve you and lord as he
[44:57] goes and presses forward father to get
[44:59] an education which is necessary
[45:01] in the day that we live in lord that is
[45:04] been ordained of you father you opened
[45:06] every door
[45:07] and made the way possible now lord we
[45:10] send your holy spirit with our brother
[45:11] manasseh
[45:12] father that as he goes through the
[45:14] university lord truly let his life
[45:17] shine let it be such a beacon father
[45:20] that even amongst his christian friends
[45:22] they will recognize there's something
[45:24] above
[45:25] and beyond what they have seen and lord
[45:27] just give him that supernatural strength
[45:29] to withstand
[45:30] every temptation every trial every
[45:33] influence of worldliness
[45:34] and lord just move in his midst lord in
[45:36] the midnight hour

[45:40] the day lord give him strength
[45:42] now father we know lord that you have
[45:43] blessed him with an ability to play

[45:57] lord with your word to go forth this day
[46:00] may your word speak to him morning noon
[46:02] and night father strengthen him in all
[46:04] things
[46:04] may your holy spirit surround him and
[46:06] lord i believe father that as he stands
[46:09] upon this
[46:09] you will bless him lord just as we
[46:11] shared the quote the other night
[46:13] lord the prophet of god saying that it
[46:15] doesn't matter lord a
[46:17] farmer a minister a housewife whoever it
[46:20] might be that will put god
[46:22] first amen lord you will make them
[46:24] successful
[46:25] now lord i pray even in the hardest of
[46:27] days lord that you would just anoint my
[46:29] brother manasseh to put you first lord
[46:32] that he would be successful beyond every
[46:34] major lord
[46:35] we send your holy spirit with him now in
[46:37] the name of jesus christ
[46:39] hallelujah hallelujah god bless you amen
[46:43] hallelujah hallelujah
[46:50] well one last thing before we go to the
[46:53] word
[46:54] on august the 7th we are going to have
[46:57] a youth meeting um it's going to be an
[47:01] age-appropriate youth meeting so
[47:05] it's hard sometimes to you know
[47:08] put an exact mark on birthdays
[47:12] uh so we're asking for parental
[47:14] discretion
[47:16] uh we're looking at cutting off the line
[47:19] in the late 12 year olds and up
[47:23] somewhere if your
[47:25] child is just 12 i'm sorry some of you
[47:28] young people i
[47:29] don't know exactly how old you are um
[47:32] but if you're if your parents your mom
[47:35] or dad would feel like you were
[47:37] mature for a 12 year old then you would
[47:39] be invited
[47:42] we are going just so you'll know a
[47:43] foretaste we are going to
[47:45] be discussing music we're going to be
[47:48] discussing
[47:50] rock and roll which the spirit people
[47:53] say well we're talking rhythm and blues
[47:55] we're talking classic we're talking this
[47:57] but we have to recognize there's a
[47:59] spirit behind music
[48:00] and if it is not causing us to worship
[48:03] the lord
[48:04] in spirit and in truth then it's
[48:07] probably the wrong music
[48:08] so we are going to have a youth meeting
[48:11] on august
[48:12] the 7th which is a friday
[48:15] uh and i'm not sure brother chris what
[48:17] is the normal time that you are
[48:19] seven o'clock now this
[48:22] uh that we're going to enter into will
[48:24] be quite lengthy so we might need to cut
[48:27] it in half
[48:28] we are going to watch a video that was
[48:32] put together uh several years ago by our
[48:34] brother marcus becker from germany
[48:37] uh it's very in-depth uh the video
[48:40] itself is approximately two and a half
[48:42] hours
[48:43] uh so we might need to cut that in too
[48:45] but uh parents
[48:47] i need you to pray about it and parents
[48:49] if your children
[48:50] are of age i ask you from my heart
[48:53] to make sure they make it you see the
[48:56] spirit of rock and roll
[48:58] which the prophet of god was talking
[49:00] about it's interesting he doesn't talk
[49:02] about rock and roll itself
[49:04] because he identifies that clearly as
[49:06] coming from the pits of hell
[49:08] but this spirit of rock and roll has
[49:10] even invaded
[49:11] christian music
[49:15] you can listen to someone singing
[49:16] amazing grace i did the other day
[49:18] made total sacrilege of it but the words
[49:22] are true so
[49:26] we just want to lay this foundation to
[49:27] be faithful parents
[49:29] ministry in the church
[49:33] to let you see exactly what satan's
[49:36] trying to pull over
[49:37] on you amen let's just turn to the word
[49:40] today i want to speak to you once again
[49:43] on redemption's manifestation amen
[49:46] we have to make a claim saints and so my
[49:49] title may be a little lengthy
[49:51] making our claim not a portion but the
[49:53] whole
[49:54] you see a partial claim in many cases
[49:56] cannot
[49:57] even be considered a claim at all and so
[50:00] we want to claim the whole and so
[50:04] as we would just stand we'll go to the
[50:06] 103rd psalm
[50:08] amen kind of wished my brother
[50:11] sergey was here this morning um
[50:14] just communicating last night with him a
[50:17] little bit he's
[50:18] almost by now probably almost on the
[50:20] east coast very close
[50:22] uh so we just want to lift our brother
[50:24] sergey up in prayer and
[50:26] um you know inspiration can come in many
[50:28] ways
[50:29] now you will find if you you wonder how
[50:31] this works you'll find that brother
[50:33] branham
[50:34] sorry i can't tell you what sermon it
[50:35] was off top of my head
[50:37] but brother brown says now wasn't that a
[50:39] wonderful message
[50:40] our pastor brought us this morning i got
[50:43] two or three sermons from that
[50:47] and so inspiration my brother and sister
[50:49] does not have to come as it were a
[50:51] vision or
[50:52] some anointing in the midnight hour but
[50:54] it can come just by a word
[50:56] being spoken a song etc and so the
[50:59] prophet of god receiving inspiration
[51:02] now he doesn't tell us what those
[51:03] sermons are so it won't do us any good
[51:05] to speculate what he might have preached
[51:07] in the future
[51:08] that would have been inspired by that
[51:11] but i say that that just a simple
[51:13] text that brother sergey sent me a
[51:15] portion of the 103rd psalm
[51:18] just blew up out of my phone and i
[51:20] started looking and
[51:21] i started looking in the message started
[51:22] looking in scripture
[51:24] and the word all become a very huge word
[51:27] it's only three letters but it become
[51:29] this huge powerful word amen
[51:32] and so by inspiration i i speak this and
[51:35] so i want to start with a definition the
[51:38] definition according to webster online
[51:40] says that the word all means the whole
[51:44] entire total amount quantity or extent
[51:48] of every member or every part of
[51:52] the whole number or sum of
[51:56] now it does not say a portion in there
[51:59] concerning a less than full amount
[52:02] it does not describe as only having a
[52:05] taste
[52:06] it does not say now we're not here to
[52:08] preach anything contrary to the word of
[52:10] god
[52:10] so you will be necessary for you to put
[52:13] it in proper context to you
[52:15] because i know in the heart that i'm
[52:17] preaching it from amen
[52:19] for the prophet of god said that now we
[52:20] don't have the whole as it were of
[52:22] christ we only have
[52:24] a foretaste or a portion of him but my
[52:26] brother and sister i want you to go back
[52:28] in the message and also go
[52:30] and listen or study what brother branham
[52:32] said he said now you put that teaspoon i
[52:34] believe he said it was
[52:36] in the ocean everything that's in that
[52:39] ocean
[52:40] is in that teaspoon of water amen so
[52:43] every mineral every ingredient is in
[52:45] that portion
[52:46] so while you only have that little
[52:48] portion of it is
[52:50] you have the whole of it hallelujah so
[52:52] you got to find the balance in the word
[52:55] right people are like
[52:56] well you know brother brown's got to
[52:57] come back so we can get the rest of the
[52:59] message know my brother and sister
[53:01] the whole sum total of the message is in
[53:04] the message
[53:05] and it's being revealed to you and i now
[53:08] if he put it out on the written page or
[53:10] on tape
[53:11] just to put it in such a simple form
[53:13] then even the make-believer would get it
[53:15] right but the word of god says that he
[53:17] plugged their ears closed their eyes
[53:19] so they would not repent and if they
[53:22] repented then he would have to save them
[53:24] and heal them
[53:25] so god's got a plan amen we want that
[53:28] whole plan to come to pass in us
[53:30] and you say well brother paul how do we
[53:31] know well you know
[53:33] we know i don't know how we know
[53:36] we know amen i'm a son of god i know
[53:39] that
[53:40] but i don't need to come and convince
[53:42] you now as a pastor i might need
[53:45] to encourage you to come to the place
[53:48] you recognize it in yourself
[53:50] but i'm not here to convince you right
[53:54] i won't take a young person and and just
[53:56] give them you know 105 scriptures and
[53:59] you know couple hundred quotes and say
[54:00] now go home because you you're the bride
[54:04] see that has to be a desire in there has
[54:06] to be a hunger in there there has to be
[54:08] something that says
[54:09] i'm different and you know as young
[54:12] people
[54:13] hallelujah it's hard being different
[54:18] and when you're in your 20s it's hard
[54:20] being different and when you're in your
[54:22] 30s it's hard being different
[54:23] when you're in your 40s it's hard being
[54:25] different
[54:26] and when you're older than 40
[54:32] when you're in your 50s it's hard being
[54:34] different in
[54:35] 60s and 70s and 80s and 90s
[54:39] you see the scripture says you're not of
[54:41] this world
[54:43] you're of a heavenly kingdom now if
[54:46] you're of a heavenly kingdom how can you
[54:48] identify with this world
[54:50] not possible thank you lord
[54:54] and the sooner we recognize where we
[54:56] belong
[54:58] and who we belong to the easier it is
[55:01] for us to
[55:02] accept we're different hallelujah
[55:06] praise the lord 103rd psalm
[55:10] we'll just read a portion of it today
[55:14] bless the lord o my soul and all
[55:17] that is within me bless his holy name
[55:20] bless the lord o my soul and forget not
[55:24] all his benefits who forgiveth
[55:27] all thine iniquities who healeth
[55:30] all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life
[55:34] from destruction who crowneth thee with
[55:37] loving kindness
[55:38] and tender mercies who satisfieth
[55:41] my mouth with good things so that thy
[55:44] mouth
[55:45] thy youth excuse me speaking of being
[55:48] over 50.
[55:49] who satisfieth thy mouth with good
[55:51] things so that thy youth is renewed
[55:54] like the eagles amen that's why i don't
[55:56] like to hear
[55:57] older people in the message i don't know
[56:00] what age means older
[56:02] but i don't like older people
[56:03] complaining about how
[56:05] tired they are and how they're not able
[56:07] to do certain things i'm preaching to
[56:09] paul this morning
[56:10] because they say well i'm just getting
[56:12] older i can't do this i
[56:14] i'd lift my hands in worship but you
[56:16] know i'm just my arms are tired my
[56:18] brother and sister
[56:19] the word says he would renew us like the
[56:22] eagle
[56:23] amen our youth should not be something
[56:25] we abandoned because our birthdays keep
[56:27] clicking higher
[56:28] amen that our youth renewed like the
[56:31] eagles
[56:32] oh hallelujah i'm going to get excited
[56:34] here if i'm not careful this morning
[56:36] the lord executed righteousness and
[56:38] judgment for all that are oppressed
[56:41] he made known his ways unto moses his
[56:43] acts and to the children of israel
[56:45] the lord is merciful and gracious
[56:48] slow to anger and plenteous in mercy
[56:52] hallelujah oh hallelujah he will not
[56:56] always chide neither will he keep his
[56:58] anger forever he hath not dealt with us
[57:01] after our sins nor rewarded us according
[57:03] to our iniquities
[57:05] for as the heaven is high above the
[57:07] earth so great is his mercy toward them
[57:10] that fear him as far as the east is from
[57:13] the west
[57:14] so far hath he removed our
[57:16] transgressions
[57:17] from us heavenly father we ask for your
[57:20] blessings upon the word today
[57:22] lord open it to us father lord in such a
[57:25] fashion in such a measure father
[57:28] that we would leave today lord and say
[57:30] was it not good to be in the house of
[57:32] the lord
[57:33] lord we thank you give guidance in your
[57:35] name we pray
[57:36] amen you may be seated
[57:39] i would like to jump down to verse 21
[57:44] and as we would look at this we would
[57:47] then say
[57:48] according to the word all that was in
[57:50] between this
[57:51] read it it is beautiful but for the sake
[57:55] of time
[57:57] bless ye the lord now
[58:01] my brother and sister that ought to be
[58:02] something that's fresh on our lips
[58:04] all the time is praise for the king
[58:07] all ye his hosts ye ministers of his
[58:10] that do his pleasure
[58:12] bless the lord lord all his works in all
[58:14] places of his dominion
[58:16] bless the lord oh my soul
[58:20] amen now as we would look at this my
[58:22] brother and sister
[58:23] i want to as it is just kind of it will
[58:26] look like i'm
[58:26] on a loop uh those of you that own old
[58:29] stereos maybe new ones i don't know i
[58:31] haven't bought one so long i don't know
[58:32] what a new stereo looks like
[58:34] but you look at this i'm going to push
[58:36] loop here because we're going to go a
[58:37] little ways and we're going to circle
[58:38] right back upon ourselves again
[58:41] now it says here in verse 21 bless ye
[58:43] the lord all ye
[58:44] his hosts now the word host is one that
[58:47] receives or entertains
[58:48] guests socially commercially or
[58:50] officially one that provides facilities
[58:53] for an event or a function
[58:54] a living animal or plant on or which a
[58:57] parasite
[58:58] lives a larger strong dominant member
[59:01] of a commercial or symbiotic pair an
[59:04] individual into which a tissue part or
[59:07] embryo is transplanted from another
[59:09] now as you look at this my brother and
[59:11] sister bless ye
[59:12] the lord all ye his hosts now look my
[59:15] brother and sister
[59:16] we know as the prophet of god has laid
[59:18] this out
[59:19] as the painting of the door and how that
[59:22] it would be
[59:22] that uh uh they uh questioned that about
[59:25] the latch not being
[59:27] on the outside and and you know the
[59:29] story goes that uh no
[59:31] that was correct because you see we're
[59:33] in control of the door
[59:35] whether we're going to let him in
[59:37] whether we're going to give him a
[59:39] presence and we're going to as it were
[59:42] uh receive or entertain him
[59:44] is according to our own heart's desires
[59:48] no one's going to force you to open that
[59:50] door sometimes ministers might be a
[59:52] little forceful
[59:53] my brother and sister let me tell you if
[59:56] a real minister
[59:57] a real man of god has a desire in his
[1:00:00] heart to only serve god
[1:00:01] according to the will of god to please
[1:00:03] god my brother and sister if he presses
[1:00:06] upon you
[1:00:06] that man is not there pressing upon you
[1:00:09] i would be so bold to say this morning
[1:00:11] it is god
[1:00:12] pressing upon you and so there's times
[1:00:15] in our life we need a little
[1:00:16] encouragement to get up out of our chair
[1:00:18] we need a time of our life we need just
[1:00:20] a little something to give us an
[1:00:22] unction to go ahead and step out of what
[1:00:25] the flesh
[1:00:25] feels or what the flesh sees or or how
[1:00:28] we
[1:00:29] see our circumstance and so i would just
[1:00:32] encourage each one of you today to be a
[1:00:34] host
[1:00:34] amen to receive and entertain the lord
[1:00:37] jesus today
[1:00:38] and just to give him that opportunity to
[1:00:41] to allow him to come in and then you can
[1:00:44] entertain him now my brother and sister
[1:00:47] i want to
[1:00:48] speak to you as i said today on uh
[1:00:50] receiving
[1:00:51] amen making our claim not a portion but
[1:00:54] the whole
[1:00:56] you see there's a lot of things in life
[1:00:58] my brother and sister that require we
[1:00:59] make a very solid claim
[1:01:02] you can possess the title to a piece of
[1:01:04] property
[1:01:05] but yet if you never transfer it over at
[1:01:08] the
[1:01:08] courthouse or at the county level or
[1:01:11] state level
[1:01:12] and you never make a solid claim on it
[1:01:14] and you
[1:01:15] die with that still in your possession
[1:01:17] without making the proper claim
[1:01:19] it can be contested and so it's there my
[1:01:22] brother and sister that we as sons and
[1:01:24] daughters of god living our life here
[1:01:26] on this earth today we are not here to
[1:01:29] just go through life as it were with a
[1:01:31] partial claim
[1:01:33] that we are sons and daughters of god if
[1:01:35] we come to that place and we never
[1:01:38] make that full claim upon that it could
[1:01:40] be contested as to whether or not we
[1:01:43] truly
[1:01:44] are sons and daughters of god and as we
[1:01:46] make a claim upon the word
[1:01:48] we will manifest all that's in the word
[1:01:50] for us to claim now
[1:01:52] it doesn't matter my brother and sister
[1:01:54] what we would say or what we would do
[1:01:57] going to church won't do it for you
[1:01:59] perfect attendance won't do it
[1:02:01] i would prefer perfect attendance to
[1:02:03] absenteeism
[1:02:04] but my brother and sister still the
[1:02:06] prophet of god the scripture lays it out
[1:02:09] so clearly time after time
[1:02:11] that it takes a baptism of the holy
[1:02:13] ghost
[1:02:14] amen the prophet of god i want to throw
[1:02:16] this out uh we'll discuss it in this
[1:02:18] youth meeting
[1:02:19] but the prophet of god i'm just
[1:02:20] paraphrasing it says you know if a young
[1:02:23] person
[1:02:23] doesn't have the baptism of the holy
[1:02:26] ghost whenever they
[1:02:27] hear that the spirit of rock and roll
[1:02:30] will claim them
[1:02:36] just hearing it you don't have to go to
[1:02:38] the party you don't have to go to the
[1:02:39] concert you don't have to do whatever
[1:02:41] that spirit will claim now look i i got
[1:02:44] to we were discussing age and
[1:02:46] and i just want to lay this out you know
[1:02:49] we were trying to figure out where to
[1:02:50] put the age but you see i started
[1:02:52] listening to rock and roll at about 11
[1:02:54] and a half years old
[1:02:58] i never got delivered from it until i
[1:03:00] was in my late 30s
[1:03:04] you don't think it has a grip it has got
[1:03:08] a grip
[1:03:12] and even then i hope you find the humor
[1:03:14] in this i'll be going
[1:03:16] through a store with my wife and
[1:03:18] something will come on
[1:03:20] and she will invariably turn and look at
[1:03:23] me because i
[1:03:23] i don't even realize it i drove my chevy
[1:03:27] to the levy but they love you
[1:03:34] well hallelujah was i really walking
[1:03:36] through the store singing that
[1:03:39] well you see my brother and sister satan
[1:03:41] wants to put an imprint on
[1:03:44] let's make a full claim on the promises
[1:03:46] of god let's not leave one bit of room
[1:03:48] for satan to put an imprint
[1:03:50] amen that all of his print would be
[1:03:52] wiped away
[1:03:54] hallelujah now as we look at this my
[1:03:56] brother and sister
[1:03:58] i just want you to see that see satan's
[1:04:00] goal if
[1:04:01] we are going to uh have a claim that can
[1:04:04] be made
[1:04:06] satan wants to minimize as it were
[1:04:08] satan's goal is that we would claim only
[1:04:11] a portion
[1:04:12] now we know that we can claim to be a
[1:04:14] christian
[1:04:15] we can claim that we have the holy ghost
[1:04:17] my brother and sister but
[1:04:19] the claim itself is good we must each
[1:04:21] one make that right
[1:04:22] we must come to the place and say you
[1:04:24] know what lord i want the holy
[1:04:26] ghost and come to a stage in our life we
[1:04:27] say i've got the holy ghost
[1:04:29] but just simply putting that in words
[1:04:31] and saying so doesn't make it so
[1:04:33] and so you know if that was the case you
[1:04:35] know maybe some of us would say i'm good
[1:04:37] looking and that would just change
[1:04:39] everything in our life
[1:04:40] but it doesn't work that way amen so you
[1:04:42] know my brother and sister as satan can
[1:04:44] get us to only claim a portion
[1:04:46] then he can get us to limit what we will
[1:04:50] actually pursue now when i say pursue we
[1:04:53] know that the word says that no man has
[1:04:55] sought god god has sought man but yet
[1:04:58] god put something into the heart of man
[1:05:00] that is there that cannot be denied and
[1:05:03] that was the seed gene of the word
[1:05:05] and when the seed gene of the word hears
[1:05:07] the word
[1:05:08] it recognizes that was the missing
[1:05:10] portion that was in the life
[1:05:12] now if satan can get us to limit that
[1:05:14] portion
[1:05:15] and to uh just come to the place that
[1:05:17] we're happy to say i believe the message
[1:05:19] i believe god sent a prophet
[1:05:21] i i believe this i go to this church you
[1:05:24] see my brother and sister that's only a
[1:05:26] portion
[1:05:26] of it amen and so satan will work and
[1:05:29] has we have witnessed
[1:05:31] uh through the years my brother and
[1:05:32] sister uh satan doing this
[1:05:35] that each generation claims a smaller
[1:05:38] portion
[1:05:38] than the generation before it that's why
[1:05:40] there had to be a restoring of the word
[1:05:43] amen that's why profit came it wasn't
[1:05:46] that we could not
[1:05:47] find as it were the truth down through
[1:05:49] the ages
[1:05:50] but my brother and sister there comes a
[1:05:51] time that with each generation claiming
[1:05:54] a smaller portion
[1:05:55] the word in its entirety is then
[1:05:58] disassembled
[1:05:59] and pieces are uh where'd they go and i
[1:06:01] said i went off to the restroom no
[1:06:03] problem
[1:06:03] can you handle this no problem because
[1:06:05] you see anything was better than working
[1:06:07] with that person
[1:06:08] amen now my brother and sister tell me
[1:06:11] that the world we live in that satan
[1:06:13] would not
[1:06:14] mark you and after a couple days there
[1:06:18] was not a single person but my
[1:06:19] direct boss would even speak to me in
[1:06:21] that building
[1:06:24] and i was so thankful
[1:06:29] don't be afraid to be marked be
[1:06:31] identified this young man was actually a
[1:06:33] very polite young man
[1:06:35] he just thought anything to do with
[1:06:36] religion was weird and it took him only
[1:06:38] about two or three hours to figure out i
[1:06:40] was weird
[1:06:41] i went from being hey you and i can be
[1:06:42] buddies too you're
[1:06:45] but if that's what i have to sacrifice
[1:06:47] for christ
[1:06:49] then let it be amen now i want you to
[1:06:51] think of what you wouldn't be
[1:06:53] if your mistakes controlled your life
[1:06:56] we would never have a job we'd never
[1:06:59] work
[1:07:00] because every one of you that's ever
[1:07:02] worked made a mistake
[1:07:04] amen certainly you would never drive a
[1:07:07] car
[1:07:08] amen imagine
[1:07:12] but this starting to get scary none of
[1:07:13] you would ever have a friend
[1:07:21] i hear hmms but i didn't hear any amens
[1:07:29] we'd never this is from a man's
[1:07:31] perspective here
[1:07:33] our wife would never wash our clothes
[1:07:38] because she'd say you know i don't know
[1:07:40] what i was thinking but i dumped
[1:07:42] bleach in on your clothes and uh
[1:07:45] it all landed in one spot and now your
[1:07:48] pants look like they're
[1:07:49] tie-dyed so she's not ever gonna wash my
[1:07:52] clothes again because she made a mistake
[1:07:55] my that's scary
[1:07:59] she'd never clean the house
[1:08:11] and she'd certainly never cook again
[1:08:21] you know one of the things about getting
[1:08:22] married young
[1:08:25] marry a girl and realize she can't even
[1:08:26] boil water
[1:08:29] that you're so in love even boiled burnt
[1:08:31] water did you know you can burn water
[1:08:33] even burnt water tastes good because
[1:08:36] you're in love
[1:08:38] but look i'm trying to make a point to
[1:08:39] you of what you wouldn't do
[1:08:41] if you look at yourself and say i've
[1:08:43] made a mistake right
[1:08:45] i have to tell this on sister jerry we
[1:08:47] we lived in an apartment right over
[1:08:49] canyon hill you drop down the freeway
[1:08:51] into caldwell
[1:08:52] and up there on a bluff right there you
[1:08:53] can't really see these apartments and
[1:08:55] and uh turns out a couple guys i went to
[1:08:57] high school with lived an apartment next
[1:08:59] door and
[1:09:00] they like to smoke a lot of weed hey man
[1:09:02] i don't know if it was thistle or kosher
[1:09:03] or something but it did weird things to
[1:09:05] him
[1:09:05] anyway you know i come home from work
[1:09:07] one day and and one of the guys comes
[1:09:09] out of his apartment
[1:09:10] and they shared the same back sidewalk
[1:09:12] with us and
[1:09:13] and he comes out there and he's just
[1:09:15] giggling all silly like a girl
[1:09:17] and and finally he goes paul he says i i
[1:09:19] don't want to tell you or not haha and
[1:09:20] he just goes into a fit of laughter
[1:09:22] and he said you know i was sitting out
[1:09:24] on the back step which means he was out
[1:09:26] there smoking a joint
[1:09:27] and he said and i heard the door slam
[1:09:29] open and here come this flaming fire
[1:09:32] frying pan flying out the back door
[1:09:34] landing out there beyond it
[1:09:36] and he said i jumped up you know and and
[1:09:38] then and here come your wife right
[1:09:40] behind
[1:09:40] it and i was like oh are you all right
[1:09:43] she looked at me and went in the house
[1:09:44] slammed the door and he said i just
[1:09:46] can't help it but it was just pretty
[1:09:48] funny
[1:09:49] and then him telling me i thought this
[1:09:51] is pretty funny hey jerry what about the
[1:09:53] flaming fire pan
[1:09:54] i'm not talking about it
[1:09:58] now my brother and sister if we are
[1:10:00] controlled by our mistakes
[1:10:02] we will find ourselves in all aspects of
[1:10:05] our life
[1:10:06] no longer trying to endeavor or
[1:10:08] accomplish
[1:10:09] and as sons and daughters of god if we
[1:10:11] ever stop
[1:10:12] and say you know what i make mistakes i
[1:10:15] can't go
[1:10:16] no further then you might as well give
[1:10:18] up because you will go
[1:10:20] no further and anything short of the
[1:10:23] goal that has been set before us
[1:10:25] is not complete amen so if you do not
[1:10:28] press to the mark of the high calling
[1:10:30] because of the circumstances of your
[1:10:32] life my brother and sister the devil
[1:10:34] didn't have to get you to deny
[1:10:36] that you're a christian he does not have
[1:10:38] to get you to renounce the bible you
[1:10:40] don't have to become agnostic or atheist
[1:10:42] or
[1:10:42] whatever that might be i just watched a
[1:10:44] little video a man
[1:10:46] talking to college students and one of
[1:10:47] them said well you know i i'm
[1:10:49] agnostic kinda atheist agnostic i don't
[1:10:53] know you know whatever
[1:10:54] and this man listens to this young man's
[1:10:56] little talk and finally he says you know
[1:10:58] there's something i've come to
[1:10:59] conclusion listening to you
[1:11:01] and the young man's like what was that
[1:11:02] he says i don't have enough faith
[1:11:04] to believe like you
[1:11:07] you believe that all of this
[1:11:09] organization as it were
[1:11:11] everything coming together and working
[1:11:13] cut from nothing total chaos brought
[1:11:15] this
[1:11:16] i don't have enough faith for that
[1:11:19] you see we are sons and daughters of god
[1:11:21] cannot look
[1:11:22] at our mistakes but we must come to the
[1:11:24] place that we know there's a promise
[1:11:27] amen and that promise been given to us
[1:11:29] we lay claim to that because we believe
[1:11:31] we're identified in that promise
[1:11:34] otherwise my brother and sister we go to
[1:11:35] church everybody says i'm a christian
[1:11:37] we go home live any old way we please
[1:11:39] now ultimately that is one of the
[1:11:41] reasons many young people don't believe
[1:11:43] in god today
[1:11:44] don't want to serve god today is too
[1:11:46] many people walked out of church and
[1:11:47] lived any old way
[1:11:48] and they looked at that and said look
[1:11:50] i'm just as good as they are
[1:11:51] they're better than me they claim to
[1:11:53] have something more than me
[1:11:55] i claim to have nothing and we're the
[1:11:56] same amen that's why the life of a
[1:11:59] christian
[1:11:59] should never be based upon the mistakes
[1:12:01] that you should
[1:12:02] that you would make but we are quick
[1:12:04] amen thank the lord for that we are
[1:12:06] quick to repent
[1:12:07] amen that's the spirit of a real
[1:12:09] christian always quick to repent
[1:12:11] they're soft they're tender the prophet
[1:12:13] of god talks about how
[1:12:14] when they would become hardened in their
[1:12:16] heart you look around there's a lot of
[1:12:18] christians with hard hearts a lot of
[1:12:20] people that cannot hardly even be
[1:12:22] moved by the preaching of the word they
[1:12:23] cannot hear the prophets speak they
[1:12:25] cannot read their bible
[1:12:26] they cannot listen to gospel music and
[1:12:28] even be moved
[1:12:29] mostly they just simply have a belief
[1:12:32] system
[1:12:33] and that belief system is what controls
[1:12:35] them but there is no life no emotion
[1:12:37] nothing that is really turning inside
[1:12:40] amen
[1:12:41] now speaking of churning there's a lot
[1:12:43] of lovely quotes where brother brown
[1:12:44] talks one about the spring
[1:12:46] something pushing up inside talking
[1:12:48] about how something turned up inside of
[1:12:49] him
[1:12:50] and we'll see if we get there today now
[1:12:52] in the service
[1:12:53] the message the rapture brother branham
[1:12:55] says here
[1:12:56] in the days of the pentecostals the
[1:12:58] restoring back of the gifts
[1:12:59] the restoration of the gifts speaking of
[1:13:01] tongues casting out devils
[1:13:07] i mean we don't have to just put up with
[1:13:08] the devil sitting in church
[1:13:11] we don't have to put up with him sitting
[1:13:12] at our dining room table
[1:13:14] we don't have to put up him being a
[1:13:16] hitchhiker in our car
[1:13:19] and the gifts why it testified there was
[1:13:21] no joke about it people said when it
[1:13:23] first raised up i read the books on the
[1:13:25] history of pentecost they said it can't
[1:13:27] last long it'll burn down
[1:13:28] it's still burning why it's because
[1:13:32] you never put it out you'll never put it
[1:13:34] out god said it would be there
[1:13:36] it's that portion of the word and no
[1:13:38] more could you put that out
[1:13:40] then when the bride being called out how
[1:13:43] you going to put it out
[1:13:44] it's a revelation of the manifestation
[1:13:47] of the word
[1:13:48] made true and we're living in that day
[1:13:51] praise be to god the revelation
[1:13:53] of the mystery of himself now my brother
[1:13:56] and sister if one would say well we're
[1:13:58] not sure about that
[1:13:59] well we've got scripture that clearly
[1:14:02] defines
[1:14:02] that all the mysteries of god would be
[1:14:04] made known oh
[1:14:06] amen if i read that correct earlier here
[1:14:08] that means the complete number
[1:14:10] amen so there's nothing left to be
[1:14:13] undone now i want to just move right
[1:14:15] along here
[1:14:16] and i want to just trying to make a
[1:14:17] point lay a foundation
[1:14:19] in events made clear by prophecy for the
[1:14:21] bible is a living
[1:14:22] foretold witness of jesus christ and as
[1:14:25] the earth has grown
[1:14:26] into its fullness and also vines grow
[1:14:29] into their fullness
[1:14:30] the days grows into its fullness the
[1:14:32] bible was manifested in its fullness
[1:14:35] in the person of jesus christ he was the
[1:14:38] word of god revealed the whole complete
[1:14:40] book
[1:14:41] of redemption do you realize my brother
[1:14:44] and sister
[1:14:44] if god is in you
[1:14:47] i think that's scriptural isn't it if
[1:14:50] god is in you then the book of
[1:14:52] redemption
[1:14:53] is in you amen we're not looking for
[1:14:56] another book to be opened somewhere
[1:14:58] we're not looking
[1:14:59] for a coming and another opening the
[1:15:01] book of redemption is in you
[1:15:04] and that is what is stirring your heart
[1:15:07] to want the word of god
[1:15:09] amen because a book is unfolding not out
[1:15:12] here on a preacher
[1:15:13] in a pulpit not in a library somewhere
[1:15:16] not in a video series
[1:15:17] the word is being opened and manifested
[1:15:20] in
[1:15:20] you and i hallelujah
[1:15:24] don't look for it somewhere else look
[1:15:26] for it in you
[1:15:27] amen but if satan can he'll come and say
[1:15:31] well
[1:15:31] our pastor our brother so and so
[1:15:34] or the prophet they had a real
[1:15:36] manifestation of jesus christ
[1:15:38] this man has a manifestation this man
[1:15:40] has it and we'll leave
[1:15:41] ourselves completely out of the picture
[1:15:44] satan's happy with that you can attend
[1:15:46] grace tabernacle all the days of your
[1:15:48] life
[1:15:48] we'll bury you and you'll be there and
[1:15:50] know better off my brother and sister
[1:15:52] than the first day you walked in if you
[1:15:54] don't recognize it's god in you
[1:15:56] hallelujah
[1:16:02] the bible is god's word for telling
[1:16:04] future events it's believers is
[1:16:05] commanded by its author to read and
[1:16:07] believe
[1:16:08] every word of it not just part of it one
[1:16:11] word to do
[1:16:12] disbelieve it you might as well quit
[1:16:14] trying
[1:16:16] just one word just one word
[1:16:19] did somebody hear me can somebody say
[1:16:22] one
[1:16:23] amen just one word
[1:16:26] you might as well quit trying until you
[1:16:28] believe that word
[1:16:30] so whatever little portion it is that
[1:16:32] you struggle with it oh you say brother
[1:16:34] paul i believe all the doctrine
[1:16:35] i believe all the prophet of god i
[1:16:37] believe everything he showed in but if
[1:16:38] you have a struggle believing that you
[1:16:40] are a son a daughter of god
[1:16:41] and you are called before the foundation
[1:16:42] of the world to believe it you're just
[1:16:44] believing the one word
[1:16:45] amen see you've got to come to the place
[1:16:47] that you put yourself right in that word
[1:16:49] and you say but it's impossible for me
[1:16:51] to be filled with the holy ghost it's
[1:16:52] impossible for me
[1:16:53] to have the authority of almighty god
[1:16:55] it's impossible for me
[1:16:56] to make a difference my brother and
[1:16:58] sister you're disbelieving the one word
[1:17:00] you've got to step right into that and
[1:17:02] say i don't care what i think about it
[1:17:04] i don't care what it looks like i'm not
[1:17:07] going to be just believe one word of it
[1:17:09] can i explain it no i can't explain it
[1:17:11] it don't matter i believe it amen people
[1:17:14] say well that's crazy
[1:17:15] well there's a lot of things talking to
[1:17:17] a guy the other day we were talking
[1:17:19] about things of god and
[1:17:20] not he's a little bit uh you might say
[1:17:22] just a little bit
[1:17:23] not quite as zealous as some of us
[1:17:28] god is god and we're made in his image
[1:17:30] and he kind of figures that covers the
[1:17:31] picture
[1:17:33] and i shared with him a little quotation
[1:17:35] i'd come across where this man says now
[1:17:37] you might not believe in the creation
[1:17:39] you might not believe in god in heaven
[1:17:42] and this being the manifestation of his
[1:17:43] spoken word
[1:17:44] you might might not believe and goes
[1:17:46] right down through a whole lift
[1:17:48] you know the holy ghost you might not
[1:17:49] believe in all these things but he said
[1:17:51] if you go climb on top of a big tall
[1:17:52] building and you stand on the ledge and
[1:17:54] step off you better believe in gravity
[1:17:58] and if there is no god there is no
[1:17:59] gravity
[1:18:01] otherwise we could just go get some
[1:18:03] gravity somewhere
[1:18:06] because there are planets without
[1:18:07] gravity you know that
[1:18:09] they've identified some of these planets
[1:18:11] that the only reason all them big rocks
[1:18:13] floating around don't fly away
[1:18:15] is outside of their realm is some kind
[1:18:17] of force
[1:18:19] that's holding it all in place i wonder
[1:18:21] where they got that force at
[1:18:24] maybe on amazon next day delivery
[1:18:30] come on you might as well one word
[1:18:33] believe it just believe it you might as
[1:18:35] well quit trying until you believe that
[1:18:36] word
[1:18:36] every word is absolutely a part of
[1:18:38] almighty god god
[1:18:40] made manifest wound into his word to
[1:18:43] show forth who he is
[1:18:44] we are commanded as believers to believe
[1:18:46] every word of it and it's wrote by the
[1:18:48] author of god himself
[1:18:50] there is nobody can add anything to it
[1:18:52] or take anything from it
[1:18:54] if you would it would be a freak body of
[1:18:56] god
[1:18:57] now i'm just trying to lay a little
[1:18:59] foundation to you here saints
[1:19:00] that you would be able to see now amen
[1:19:04] that this word has clearly identified
[1:19:06] you and i
[1:19:07] and we must regardless of our mistakes
[1:19:09] regardless of where we were raised
[1:19:11] people say but we weren't taught that
[1:19:13] way well go back to the word make sure
[1:19:14] what you were taught lines up with the
[1:19:16] word
[1:19:17] amen it would have maybe like six
[1:19:20] fingers on one hand or three arms or
[1:19:22] something
[1:19:22] to add something or take something away
[1:19:24] from it be one arm short one finger
[1:19:26] short
[1:19:27] it's the complete body of jesus christ
[1:19:30] now remember we hear the word being
[1:19:32] preached it says nobody can take your
[1:19:34] place
[1:19:36] amen do you realize if you give up and
[1:19:39] you say well
[1:19:40] i believe the message i believe
[1:19:42] everything in this day but really i was
[1:19:44] not
[1:19:44] called to make a difference you have
[1:19:47] just turned the body of christ
[1:19:48] into a freak
[1:19:53] did i sober you
[1:19:56] are there freaks here no sir
[1:20:01] we're not freaks this is the complete
[1:20:04] body of jesus christ
[1:20:05] it's just time for you and i to reach
[1:20:07] out and possess
[1:20:09] what god has given to us satan has tried
[1:20:12] to convince you
[1:20:13] that because of whatever reason it might
[1:20:16] be that this
[1:20:17] is not you and it's not for you then you
[1:20:19] have to go
[1:20:20] and take it back i tell you speaking
[1:20:22] about taking it back go
[1:20:23] to brother tim pruitt's church uh
[1:20:26] website or whatever it is i don't
[1:20:27] remember what was the name of their
[1:20:28] church
[1:20:30] evening night tabernacle in louisiana
[1:20:33] he preached a sermon take it back it's
[1:20:36] powerful
[1:20:38] i would encourage you i mean brother
[1:20:40] brother tim pruitt didn't be
[1:20:42] brother ron spencer preached it at that
[1:20:43] church let me get my thoughts straight
[1:20:46] brother ron spencer preach the evening
[1:20:48] light fellowship take it back
[1:20:50] my brother and sister it's time for us
[1:20:53] to take it back

[1:20:57] that's mine that was given to me that's
[1:21:00] mine satan
[1:21:01] give it back hallelujah
[1:21:05] oh amen it's the complete body of christ
[1:21:08] in christ being the male the groom the
[1:21:10] bride is represented in him also
[1:21:11] and these two are one now this blows me
[1:21:14] away because there are people around the
[1:21:15] message that struggle about this being
[1:21:17] one thing
[1:21:19] my brother and sister if you've missed
[1:21:20] that revelation you've missed a lot of
[1:21:22] things
[1:21:23] amen said the husband and the wife would
[1:21:25] be one said the church the bride and
[1:21:27] christ
[1:21:28] would be one amen the prophet of god
[1:21:30] says he was one half the bride was the
[1:21:32] other half
[1:21:32] two the the two of them together make
[1:21:34] the complete
[1:21:35] amen you can't miss that at that day
[1:21:38] you'll know that i am in the father the
[1:21:40] father and me and i
[1:21:41] and you and you and me what a complete
[1:21:44] picture
[1:21:45] you see we're not taking part of the
[1:21:47] picture and cutting it off
[1:21:48] and saying here's what it is now you
[1:21:50] know it's interesting
[1:21:51] i i i i find this really interesting i
[1:21:54] come across a deal here a while back
[1:21:56] and there's a picture and uh somebody
[1:21:59] about four or five comments down from
[1:22:01] that
[1:22:01] said why did you crop the pitcher did
[1:22:04] you not want them to see
[1:22:06] the rest of it now there's an
[1:22:09] undercurrent there that i thought my
[1:22:11] goodness i'm putting on a life preserver
[1:22:12] and i'm paddling towards the bank
[1:22:14] because there's some kind of
[1:22:15] undercurrent here
[1:22:17] but you see my brother and sister the
[1:22:19] whole picture the complete picture
[1:22:22] we are in christ jesus satan has come
[1:22:24] over here and cut the one
[1:22:26] side off the pitcher and then tried to
[1:22:29] present that to you
[1:22:30] my brother and sister we're not going to
[1:22:32] settle for a cropped picture
[1:22:33] we want the whole complete picture amen
[1:22:37] and true believers in this word who can
[1:22:39] accept it that way
[1:22:41] hmm believe it and with patience
[1:22:45] wait for its prophesied promise now look
[1:22:48] you know i'm going to go back to this
[1:22:49] whole belief the sign thing that come
[1:22:51] one of the things is well brother
[1:22:52] branham said this this and this
[1:22:54] and it's never come to pass well
[1:22:57] hallelujah
[1:22:59] i've got a choice to make
[1:23:03] i'm going to wait patiently or i'm going
[1:23:06] to decide it ain't happening
[1:23:09] what are we going to do saints amen
[1:23:12] hallelujah you might bury me one day
[1:23:16] right here maybe even in this church
[1:23:19] some of you say words over me and you'll
[1:23:21] roll me right out of here and put me in
[1:23:22] a hole in the ground
[1:23:23] but you know what i'm gonna have to die
[1:23:26] to end my conscious
[1:23:28] assumption that the lord will fill his
[1:23:31] word
[1:23:32] i'm not ever going to just say no done
[1:23:34] god didn't do it didn't do it my time
[1:23:35] frame didn't do it my lifetime it can't
[1:23:37] be true
[1:23:38] no i'm sorry i'll go right to the grave
[1:23:39] believing every word of this
[1:23:41] because my brother and sister it wasn't
[1:23:44] centered on me god didn't say now
[1:23:45] when paul haley comes along he's going
[1:23:47] to determine when this this and this
[1:23:49] happens
[1:23:49] no he said now i will determine what
[1:23:51] happens in paul's life
[1:23:53] and paul will then submit to the word
[1:23:55] and the word will come
[1:23:57] but one thing i know oh i hope i'm not
[1:23:58] sounding presumptuous this morning
[1:24:00] but when god said paul will believe this
[1:24:03] word
[1:24:04] my theophany was out there saying amen
[1:24:12] because you see there could never be a
[1:24:14] doubt in me i never fear lodged in me
[1:24:17] nothing that ever kept me from what god
[1:24:19] said i would be
[1:24:20] now apply that to yourself this morning
[1:24:23] if god said that you were righteous
[1:24:25] and you say well i'm just not very
[1:24:26] righteous you're countering the word of
[1:24:28] god
[1:24:29] don't go there just simply say lord i'm
[1:24:31] struggling with this but i believe i'm
[1:24:33] righteous
[1:24:34] you said i'm an overcomer lord i'm
[1:24:37] struggling i was on my face yesterday
[1:24:39] lord
[1:24:39] but i will claim i'm an overcomer lord i
[1:24:42] have these things in my life i have
[1:24:44] those things in my life
[1:24:45] i have doubts and i have fears i have
[1:24:48] all of this lord
[1:24:49] how can that be wait my child just stop
[1:24:52] i said it you believe it it will come to
[1:24:55] pass
[1:24:57] hallelujah and true believers in this
[1:24:59] word who accept it that way believe it
[1:25:01] and with patience wait for its
[1:25:04] prophesied
[1:25:05] promises every one of them to be
[1:25:07] manifested
[1:25:08] in its age every believer has watched
[1:25:11] for it
[1:25:12] every oh boy this one here remember when
[1:25:15] you're a fighter you always guard
[1:25:17] yourself
[1:25:18] every believer that's been on the toes
[1:25:21] watching
[1:25:22] is the one that's been revealed to
[1:25:27] now you say brother paul you might be
[1:25:28] digging too far between the lines
[1:25:31] you believe god sent a prophet
[1:25:34] but if you aren't watching for what was
[1:25:36] thus saith the lord
[1:25:37] prophesied it's not going to be revealed
[1:25:40] to you
[1:25:41] that's why we have right in the church
[1:25:44] saints always i cannot be honest with
[1:25:45] you
[1:25:45] i always just really struggle i don't
[1:25:47] bring it up a whole lot when talking
[1:25:48] about
[1:25:49] make believers and unbelievers and the
[1:25:51] true believer
[1:25:52] because it just it hurts me to realize
[1:25:55] at some point in time
[1:25:57] that has to manifest
[1:26:01] it hurts me i i want to look out
[1:26:03] everywhere i
[1:26:04] preach no i don't say this boastfully
[1:26:07] but i've preached to
[1:26:08] over a thousand people and i've preached
[1:26:10] to two
[1:26:12] somewhere along the line we got to
[1:26:13] balance this all out
[1:26:15] but i'll tell you what i want you to do
[1:26:17] if i could encourage you get up on your
[1:26:18] toes
[1:26:20] come on are you with me get up on your
[1:26:21] toes and start watching for the promises
[1:26:24] of god to be manifested
[1:26:25] amen they're being manifested right in
[1:26:27] our congress of our nation
[1:26:29] in the courts of our nation my brother
[1:26:31] and sister we're seeing the spirits
[1:26:32] manifested right here in our city
[1:26:34] we're seeing a ride all around us it's
[1:26:36] all being manifested and if we're not
[1:26:38] watching for it we're not paying
[1:26:40] attention we'll miss it
[1:26:42] but i tell you every believer that's
[1:26:44] been on the toes amen
[1:26:45] they're they're looking they're waiting
[1:26:47] they're studying they're praying
[1:26:48] amen it's the ones it's revealed to oh
[1:26:51] god help us to get serious
[1:26:53] help us to just press out going back to
[1:26:56] what i said earlier

[1:26:59] weary i'm too tired i'm too whatever
[1:27:01] i've been there i've done that i do that
[1:27:03] sometimes my brother and sister just ask
[1:27:05] god for supernatural strength

[1:27:31] scripture again real

[1:29:02] like i only got a little taste of you
[1:29:04] i'm only going to give a little taste
[1:29:05] back no my brother and sister we're here
[1:29:08] as almost david says you know what bless
[1:29:10] the lord on my soul
[1:29:11] and all that is within me is going to
[1:29:14] bless him

[1:29:19] forget not all his benefits
[1:29:22] now i don't know about you guys but my
[1:29:24] health insurance comes in just about
[1:29:25] every month it comes it has a big
[1:29:27] envelope and part of it is they're
[1:29:29] telling me one we had to raise your
[1:29:30] rates
[1:29:31] and two we changed your benefits happens
[1:29:35] all the time
[1:29:36] it almost seems like every month another
[1:29:38] 20 bucks another 20 bucks another 20
[1:29:40] bucks
[1:29:41] and oh wait we took this benefit away
[1:29:43] from you and we took this benefit away
[1:29:44] from you
[1:29:45] but my brother and sister you see how
[1:29:46] god works he works exactly
[1:29:48] the opposite amen he's coming and saying
[1:29:52] price is paid you open that envelope it

[1:29:59] not been collecting and i want you to
[1:30:02] collect these benefits

[1:30:05] sometimes church gets personal sometimes
[1:30:07] we don't like it because it's personal
[1:30:09] but i tell you what
[1:30:10] if god himself would come right down
[1:30:12] here our lord jesus christ
[1:30:13] come right down here today there would
[1:30:15] not be a one of us he would not walk
[1:30:17] around
[1:30:18] and say you have not been cashing in on
[1:30:20] your benefits
[1:30:21] you have not been taking your benefit
[1:30:23] you haven't been collecting your benefit
[1:30:25] you need to apply your benefit not one
[1:30:28] of us would be able to sit here and say
[1:30:29] praise the lord i've been taking it all
[1:30:32] we would come and realize my brother and
[1:30:34] sister all these
[1:30:35] benefits let's not forget the benefits

[1:30:58] stomach
[1:30:59] i had a headache all the way through the
[1:31:01] surface i didn't get anything out of it
[1:31:04] my goodness what are you doing you're
[1:31:06] forgetting

[1:31:11] the benefits amen you say but i wasn't
[1:31:15] worthy
[1:31:16] don't you like the order that god laid
[1:31:18] this in
[1:31:19] amen well i didn't collect the benefits
[1:31:21] because i i've got iniquity in my life

[1:31:48] thank you lord i love that nothing's too
[1:31:51] hard for god

[1:31:56] fully expect this to be taken from me
[1:32:00] i will not claim it in the name of jesus
[1:32:03] christ
[1:32:04] i had people come up to me and say paul
[1:32:06] do you have diabetes i heard you have
[1:32:08] diabetes

[1:32:21] from all my diseases oh brother paul how
[1:32:25] can you go there
[1:32:26] really easy really easy because i

[1:32:30] who redeemeth thy life from destruction
[1:32:32] who crowneth thee with loving kindness
[1:32:35] and tender mercies hallelujah
[1:32:40] how can we be mean and ornery and be a
[1:32:43] bully around the word of god
[1:32:45] and be crowned with loving kindness and
[1:32:48] tender mercy
[1:32:50] come on god's not going to play that

[1:33:13] the foreman of the plant had enough of
[1:33:16] god in him he went back and stood at the
[1:33:18] machine
[1:33:18] and let that keep going on hey you
[1:33:22] reckon god does not have mercy

[1:39:28] yes who hasn't played knuckles some of
[1:39:31] us with
[1:39:31] arthritis played knuckles well what it
[1:39:35] is brother joshua
[1:39:36] you put your hands like this up to
[1:39:38] somebody else's hands and then the first
[1:39:39] guy gets to go
[1:39:40] and then you yeah and now i tell you
[1:39:43] what you can just beat somebody
[1:39:44] senseless because the back of their
[1:39:46] hands will swell up and look like they
[1:39:47] got half a softball
[1:39:49] and kids in high school are like oh this
[1:39:51] is so much fun
[1:39:54] yeah and then they move on from that
[1:39:57] because when you figure out that this
[1:39:58] kid's faster than everybody else around
[1:40:00] it and everybody else's hands hurt and
[1:40:01] they can't even hold a pin
[1:40:02] in history class then you go on to
[1:40:05] another game
[1:40:07] and some of these games that kids play
[1:40:08] and every one time i was good friends
[1:40:09] with this kid and i'm glad i was
[1:40:12] because they went on to this you know
[1:40:13] hit me as hard as you can game
[1:40:20] yeah come on
[1:40:23] i'm telling you the truth
[1:40:26] and my friend jim jim ryan
[1:40:29] different kid very unsocial very
[1:40:31] unsocial but if he was your friend
[1:40:33] then nobody messed with you
[1:40:37] because he'd look them in the face and
[1:40:38] say i already hated you and then you
[1:40:39] mess with my friend and i hate you even
[1:40:41] more
[1:40:46] and kids they just couldn't help
[1:40:48] themselves
[1:40:50] big kids fist like this and they're like
[1:40:53] we'll play
[1:40:56] jim would always say go first i've seen
[1:40:59] him hit him so hard it picked him up off
[1:41:01] the floor
[1:41:01] knock him back five feet
[1:41:05] and then his my turn now you want to
[1:41:08] talk about seeing a big person
[1:41:09] get afraid i just hit him as hard as i
[1:41:12] could
[1:41:14] he didn't whimper all he did is come
[1:41:16] back and say my turn
[1:41:23] and it turns out that jim's dad knew
[1:41:25] some kind of whatever had been in the
[1:41:26] military and
[1:41:27] studied martial arts and from a little
[1:41:29] kid he'd been raised up and jim would
[1:41:32] just stand there all casually relaxed
[1:41:34] and they'd be looking at him
[1:41:36] and he'd be going are you ready and
[1:41:38] they're like yeah go ahead well you know
[1:41:39] what they were expecting
[1:41:40] they were expecting him to like
[1:41:44] now
[1:41:48] and they'd be just like
[1:42:01] you know what the devil was expecting a
[1:42:04] great big wind-up explanation
[1:42:07] why why why why why
[1:42:11] because of this and because of that and
[1:42:14] jesus said
[1:42:15] it is written he didn't need some big
[1:42:19] wind up he didn't need some big i need a
[1:42:23] stick i need a whatever
[1:42:25] he just said it
[1:42:28] is written right come on saints
[1:42:33] i want you to look at your bible in a
[1:42:34] different fashion i want you to look
[1:42:36] through it and find all of the alls
[1:42:40] amen because he's already gave it to you
[1:42:42] it's already paid for it's already done
[1:42:44] you don't need some explanation
[1:42:45] about i'm weak in this thing and i have
[1:42:47] this thing and i had that thing and i
[1:42:49] had a bad childhood and i'm having a bad
[1:42:50] adulthood and i'm having this and i'm
[1:42:52] having that
[1:42:53] while you go back to the word amen it's
[1:42:55] written
[1:42:56] it's written i'm an overcomer i'm
[1:42:59] righteous
[1:43:00] i'm holy i'm a son of god
[1:43:03] i'm going to finish this race it's all
[1:43:05] written
[1:43:06] it's all written can we trust the lord
[1:43:09] amen can we just press forward my
[1:43:11] brother and sister
[1:43:13] oh hallelujah oh hallelujah sister emmy
[1:43:18] would you come amen that'll cause me to
[1:43:19] stop
[1:43:22] i have one last quote that's super long
[1:43:25] and i'll bring it out in another service
[1:43:27] but i just want you to i just want you
[1:43:29] to understand
[1:43:30] in fact i don't mind you writing it down
[1:43:32] brother alex put this
[1:43:33] uh broken cisterns up on the screen so
[1:43:36] that they can uh
[1:43:37] find the paragraph i want you all to
[1:43:39] write this paragraph down or come back
[1:43:40] in the service and pull this
[1:43:42] i want you to read this because see
[1:43:44] you're going to say there's a reason why
[1:43:46] i can't do this and i can't do that and
[1:43:48] there is something there about my
[1:43:49] inabilities now i'm just going to
[1:43:51] paraphrase it to you really quick as our
[1:43:53] sister starts to play something for us
[1:43:55] my brother and sister this is the
[1:43:56] prophet of god talking about a need
[1:43:59] amen he's there talking about a need
[1:44:01] that a young man that had
[1:44:02] been severely injured unto death and the
[1:44:05] prophet of god talking about how you
[1:44:07] know maybe i'd go over there if god
[1:44:08] would give me a vision
[1:44:10] but now god starts dealing with the
[1:44:12] prophet
[1:44:13] and he realizes just a second if i had
[1:44:17] faith in the vision i just there
[1:44:19] immediately pray for him
[1:44:21] but it was the same faith whether he had
[1:44:23] a vision or not
[1:44:25] it was the same god on this scene
[1:44:30] i want you to read that i want you to go
[1:44:31] right down there see
[1:44:34] if jesus was here he go lay his holy
[1:44:36] hands on him that boy get well i don't
[1:44:38] care
[1:44:38] if his liver is bursting he'd get well
[1:44:41] because jesus was walking there knowing
[1:44:42] exactly who he was he knowed his calling
[1:44:45] the scriptures was right vindicating he
[1:44:46] knowed who he was not a shadow of a
[1:44:48] doubt
[1:44:50] but the prophet of god goes on to
[1:44:52] realize
[1:44:53] wait i have that kind of faith
[1:44:58] i know who i am i know what the word
[1:45:01] says
[1:45:03] and he says i went right out there and i
[1:45:05] went and prayed for him
[1:45:06] and there he was in the service made
[1:45:09] completely whole
[1:45:11] my brother and sister don't go looking
[1:45:13] up and saying now if i was here if i was
[1:45:15] this if i was the prophet if i was the
[1:45:16] preacher
[1:45:17] if i was this if i was that look what
[1:45:19] the word
[1:45:20] said about you and when you catch the
[1:45:23] revelation of what the word says about
[1:45:25] you
[1:45:25] amen you see it will come to a place
[1:45:28] that you will be able to just simply say
[1:45:30] you know what i need this you know
[1:45:32] brother brown says oh i'm a sinner
[1:45:34] born sexual birth i may as well just
[1:45:35] read the whole thing to you right
[1:45:37] my father mother both sinners i'm just
[1:45:39] good nothing but you know what
[1:45:41] if the lord would give me a vision send
[1:45:42] me down there that would be different
[1:45:44] i'd go down lay my hands and come out of
[1:45:45] that bed and give me vision but then i
[1:45:47] got to thinking after all if this was a
[1:45:48] vision
[1:45:49] what is it it was some same dirty hands
[1:45:51] on him
[1:45:52] the same man praying for him same dirty
[1:45:54] hands i began to think i'm his
[1:45:55] representative
[1:45:56] any representatives here this morning
[1:45:58] amen i'm his representative
[1:46:00] then god doesn't see me
[1:46:03] oh just a second that's why i had to do
[1:46:05] this i need to try ribbon around this
[1:46:07] you see he doesn't see you oh but i
[1:46:11] can't this and i'm not bad and oh if i
[1:46:13] i make mistakes and i've got iniquity
[1:46:16] everybody's got iniquity
[1:46:18] come on you can pray through and with
[1:46:20] before before lunch comes
[1:46:22] you'll have iniquity in your life oh my
[1:46:26] ah yeah god doesn't see me
[1:46:30] blood or that righteous when ladies up
[1:46:32] there on the altar takes intersections
[1:46:33] he's my sufficiency he's my prayer he's
[1:46:35] my life
[1:46:35] the only thing that'll make me put my
[1:46:37] hands on him with faith because i had
[1:46:38] faith in the vision
[1:46:40] and without the vision the same faith
[1:46:41] would do the same thing
[1:46:44] so i can reckon myself nothing but
[1:46:46] reckon him my old and all is my life
[1:46:47] he's my commissioner
[1:46:49] no denomination sent me he sent me i go
[1:46:52] in his name i'll lay hands upon him walk
[1:46:54] down the street laid hands on that boy
[1:46:55] and that night he was in the meeting
[1:46:59] i'll back that up without the quote just
[1:47:01] words and you can search it out the
[1:47:02] prophet of god said any old mother
[1:47:05] any old housewife can go lay her hands
[1:47:08] on her child
[1:47:09] and claim it in the name of jesus christ
[1:47:12] you don't need the preacher preachers
[1:47:14] are good they have their place
[1:47:16] but so does that holy ghost-filled
[1:47:18] housewife
[1:47:19] so does that young person in grade
[1:47:21] school junior high school
[1:47:23] high school they have that place you
[1:47:26] don't got to go say well if the pastor
[1:47:28] pray for me i might be able to overcome
[1:47:29] school
[1:47:30] no god's in you you'll overcome it
[1:47:34] amen the workplace you'll overcome it
[1:47:37] amen whatever affliction satan might put
[1:47:40] something in the mind the heart the soul
[1:47:41] the spirit
[1:47:42] trying to hinder you from claiming all
[1:47:45] claim in the name of jesus christ go
[1:47:46] forward
[1:47:48] oh hallelujah hallelujah well i didn't
[1:47:51] do this quote justice so we'll have to
[1:47:52] come back and revisit it
[1:47:54] if that'll be all right but my brother
[1:47:56] and sister you see
[1:47:58] it doesn't matter it's who christ is
[1:48:02] all we got to do is stand up and let him
[1:48:04] work through us
[1:48:06] and remember god's not looking for
[1:48:08] people that are
[1:48:09] movers and shakers
[1:48:10] [Music]
[1:48:13] mixers is what the prophet of god called
[1:48:15] it he's not looking for mixers
[1:48:17] god's looking to separate us separate us
[1:48:20] from this world
[1:48:22] amen from the things of this world well
[1:48:24] praise the lord
[1:48:25] hallelujah my

[1:52:59] heavenly places
[1:53:01] give you strength to endure everything
[1:53:03] you know sister jerry and i was talking
[1:53:05] uh i wanna i wanna take any lively
[1:53:08] hope you have out of you before we
[1:53:10] dismiss
[1:53:12] we're living in a day right they're
[1:53:14] wanting to take our money away from us
[1:53:15] now
[1:53:16] it says you won't be able to buy and
[1:53:17] sell right get that mark
[1:53:21] they want to take our money away from us
[1:53:22] now
[1:53:24] but look at the dark ages god
[1:53:27] allowed them to go and they hid in a
[1:53:29] cave
[1:53:31] oh wait i don't mean to disappoint you
[1:53:33] they now have technology they can look
[1:53:35] through rock and sense your body heat
[1:53:37] under 50 feet of rock
[1:53:40] we're not going to go hide in a cave
[1:53:45] some of them they went
[1:53:49] they become wanderers in the wilderness
[1:53:51] so if somebody wanted to find them they
[1:53:53] had to pursue them and find them
[1:53:56] but now they can cover a whole desert in
[1:53:59] a matter
[1:54:00] of a very brief period of time
[1:54:05] i was over in monmouth preaching for
[1:54:07] brother rich this last march
[1:54:10] they took me to meet a man flies a
[1:54:13] corporate jet
[1:54:16] brother rich's son is taking flight
[1:54:18] lessons from him
[1:54:20] took us to a hangar and here is a a jet
[1:54:23] they bought it used
[1:54:24] i i was it made me feel a lot better
[1:54:26] that they only paid 48 million for a
[1:54:28] used jet
[1:54:31] but it can land in the fog in the rain
[1:54:34] and everything
[1:54:36] because just the heat that a light bulb
[1:54:40] on the runway puts off it sees it
[1:54:44] and he said let me prove it to you and
[1:54:45] he went out of the jet and he went
[1:54:47] across the hangar
[1:54:48] put his hand for just about that long
[1:54:52] on the box that holds the fire
[1:54:55] extinguisher
[1:54:57] come and got back in the plane and sat
[1:54:59] down
[1:55:00] and he says let's see how long we can
[1:55:02] see that
[1:55:03] and that perfect handprint stayed there
[1:55:06] and stayed there and stayed there
[1:55:08] slowly got dim you're not going to find
[1:55:11] a bush to hide under
[1:55:14] but the one thing they cannot penetrate
[1:55:17] with their technology
[1:55:20] is when a son or daughter of god
[1:55:23] is hid in christ they
[1:55:27] can't find him there
[1:55:31] i tell you our brother ivan i wished he
[1:55:32] was here my heart breaks sometimes
[1:55:35] i love that man so much
[1:55:38] he shared stories with me about how in
[1:55:41] the ukraine when it was behind the iron
[1:55:43] curtain
[1:55:45] shared a story once they were throwing
[1:55:48] bibles over the fence
[1:55:50] and a box ripped open and bibles flew
[1:55:53] everywhere
[1:55:54] pages papers on the ground
[1:55:56] [Music]
[1:55:58] i was just condensed the story
[1:56:01] there was a man there picking him up and
[1:56:03] there was supposed to be a young man
[1:56:04] that would walk
[1:56:05] sentry
[1:56:08] to tell him if the guards were coming
[1:56:11] they had sand that they would break
[1:56:12] clean so they could see any footprint
[1:56:15] and here come these guards and here's
[1:56:16] this man
[1:56:18] picking up bibles and there's the
[1:56:21] soldiers
[1:56:24] and we would think it's over it's done
[1:56:27] i'm going to prison but brother ivan
[1:56:31] shared with me how that man stood there
[1:56:32] holding a box of bibles
[1:56:36] and the soldiers walked within mere feet
[1:56:39] of him
[1:56:40] and walked right on by that's
[1:56:43] an earthly example of what it is to be
[1:56:46] hid
[1:56:46] in christ amen
[1:56:50] hallelujah don't worry about tomorrow
[1:56:53] don't worry about the direction this
[1:56:54] world's gone we got a promise
[1:56:57] we got a promise god will bring his
[1:56:58] promise to pass
[1:57:00] amen you just keep holding on to that
[1:57:02] promise and don't falter don't fear
