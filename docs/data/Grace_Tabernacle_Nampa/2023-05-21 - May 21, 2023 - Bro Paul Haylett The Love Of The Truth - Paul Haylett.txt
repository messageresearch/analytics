Jesus that your Supernatural power father that we know is the holy spirit is with us walking with us and father not just with us but Lord you said you would be in us to the end of the Earth and Lord

guide us Lord in your word oh thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus amen amen as our brother Ivan said is it good to be in the house of the Lord today Saints amen well I just want to get the warmest of welcomes too brother Peter and uh sister Alina amen God bless you you know brother Peter come and visited us last year and leaves and comes back with a wonderful beautiful wife so that God has blessed him obviously in this last year and and we like the blessings of God do we not amen we love it when he pours His blessings out on us and I say thank you I see brother Trevor sister Kerry not here today does anyone know not feeling well or sister Kerry is not feeling well let's definitely remember them in prayer and um uh brother mellow and his family up in Boise I thought maybe they would be here today they had sent a text last night but let's remember them my brothers and sisters most of us well my I don't know maybe the church here I won't say most um but those of us that that are here have been raised here born here Etc we don't know what it's like to deal with all the relocation and the adjustments and all of those things God bless you brother I I don't know your name but happy to have you with us here today amen and uh so let's just remember I want to make a quick announcement uh Sunday school we'll be over in a couple weeks so we want to encourage the teachers um to to be able to find a conclusion uh to lessons and we'll definitely have that finished before we go to Family Camp and so anyway that will will uh come to conclusion in the next couple weeks for a summer break uh brother Chris I believe announced to the young adults today that that will go into summer break and um that definitely don't take that as uh cause to just go on vacation from the house of God let's be fervent to be in the house of the Lord amen I I personally believe uh while he is with us walking with us guiding us every day there is something incredibly Supernatural about meeting our Lord Jesus Christ here in the house of God Amen so as the word says not forsaking the assembling of ourselves I want to speak to you once again on the thought of things that are to be and this is a carryover from last week as we're talking uh thank you musicians and song leaders amen a continuation of the thought of the elect lady and um my brother and sister there sometimes that we just have to recognize that there is there is something warm and fuzzy about realizing someone is giving you a compliment someone is speaking up as it were to you lifting you up and and it just causes something to happen when you hear a kind word when you hear an encouraging word thank you for a job well done it does something to us in our humanity and I would trust today that as you look in the word of God that you would have that reaction it's okay to have that reaction in the flesh amen just I'm sorry to phrase it that way I just want to keep it simple but to have that warm fuzzy feeling in the flesh is good but it should be something that strikes Us in the soul that we realize God loves us so much that he has recorded Us in his word for time in eternity amen and so as we turn in our Bibles amen want to speak to you today on an extension of last week and we're going to speak or title it the love of the truth amen and turn in your Bibles to second John the first chapter now we're going to shorten those verses down to just the first and second verses of second John 1. amen now as we speak to this and I certainly asked this morning you would say a prayer for me we've been out in the dust and the uh all of the springtime things here and our voice and congestion Etc um but um if you just give a little prayer our voice would hold up for this service the Elder lady now my brother and Elders in the church not just simply that they would be men of authority over others or men to to absolutely dictate but the elders were there for us to look to we find it all through this scripture that God has put men in a position of authority not to lift those men up but for those men to have a voice of experience and that is why that we as Christians uh we elect uh men into offices uh the word of God says you don't uh have a novice in in these high offices but you want men and it's not because they can say I'm older than you so listen to me but it is by the experience amen and what we're looking for today is not to say a young man can't have the experience because God has certainly taken young men through the fire we have not just young men but young brothers and sisters have gone through the fire Satan comes and he wants to attack in every Avenue and the world we live in today my brother and sister Satan has so anointed it that when people are attacked in the mind or in the spirit that they feel like there must be a deficiency in them but the word of God so clearly shows us that we each won the prophet clarifies it that we each one have a weakness and Satan recognizes that weakness and attacks it that's why we want to keep the things of our lives under the blood of Jesus Christ to be in fellowship with him and Satan then cannot come and do that but Satan has put a stigma into certain aspects of Our Lives to say well I'm a failure in this uh particular situation no we are not failures my brother and sister but that is the Avenue by which Satan recognizes he can attack you and cause and get a reaction so it's there the elders now speaking to the elect lady and her children whom I love in the truth now this is not to say that he doesn't love them overall but what he's declaring is there's a position in truth that we all come together today and call ourselves brothers and sisters call ourselves the body of Christ call ourselves a body of Believers and so he's not saying I don't love you if you're not in truth but he's saying I love you through the truth amen that the truth is bringing a Unity into this body that is bonding us together now sorry for just an everyday example but if you ever wonder many years ago when I was young starting in the trades and and doing you know they come around and little things that they use to prove to you when liquid nails first come out you know they were coming around saying this is what you need to use on your construction sites and they would be there and they would say here glue these two two befores together and just leave them for six hours and then try to take them apart and what would happen my brother and sister in just a mere six hours the bond between those boards was stronger than and the board themselves and you could beat on that until there was just this ribbon of wood on each side of the glue that was so bonded together and that's what the word of God is doing in your life and in my life by the truth today it's bonding us to Jesus Christ so tightly that the world can tear everything down around us even maybe our health and the world would question our sanity but it doesn't matter because we have been bound to Jesus Christ amen and that word is what is our very life amen amen whom I love in the truth and not I only but also all they that have known the truth for the true sake which dwelleth in US amen it's not something external it's in US and shall be with us let's say this together forever amen not a temporary fix that God has in our life but an eternal fix Heavenly Father we ask for your blessings on the word today in your name we pray amen you may be seated Saints this relationship that John is speaking about and to the elect lady is built on something much greater much more than a regular human Foundation as we would come and realize that love can be so great that one would lay his life down for his brother for his sister this relationship that the elect lady has it is one that is so strong because you see my brother and sister it's not that she has just experienced truth or believes truth she has become truth and when she become truth it was the very life of God the very nature or characteristic of God has then possessed or taken her over now the devil would come and say but you still make mistakes and that's a you know kind of set you apart yes that's called the human element and my brother and sister God saved us in spite of the human element somebody ought to say thank you Lord for that because if it was a human element that dictated whether we were saved or not there would be no flesh saved the scripture tells us there would be no possible way but God has come and he has built upon a relationship that is of his very nature amen and we'll find that while we won't go into it today we'll find my brother and sister maybe a little homework that you could do of the relationship of Love versus affection and my brother and sister people have a lot of affection for the gospel but affection is just merely a fondness affection is not a deep rooted life-changing experience now I want to say this in the right connection so that no one would misunderstand me today and come up with some strange deal but sisters of this church I have a great amount of affection for you and if you look at that in the proper context I'm very fond of you I'm I'm very happy to call you my sisters I'm very happy to have you as friends to be in Fellowship but as a prophet of God spoke and he's talking about this relationship and we'll just bump this for a second the prophet of God says now there's wonderful sisters there there's Godly sisters and women here in the building but there'll only be one who goes home with me tonight and she is identified as Mrs William Branham you see brother Branham had a deep abiding affection for the Bride of Jesus Christ but in the natural sense that was only one that he would then declare I love in that context now my brother and sister if you talk to this and you look into this research this you'll find that the prophet declares that he loved this bride of Christ that God give him the privilege of preaching to it is not that he said I'm affectionate of you then I'm fond of you you're nice people but he really had a deep Abiding Love and I say today Lord let me have a deep Abiding Love For The Bride of Jesus Christ but let it be in the same context that John is speaking here to the elect lady he's not bringing himself into a relationship with the elect lady but he is bringing the elect lady into a relationship with Jesus Christ and that could be one of the issues we see around the messages people have drawn to themselves there have been those that bring and they draw people to themselves my brother and sister that's not right I don't care who we are what position we occupy our whole goal as ministers is to draw people into a love affair with Jesus Christ amen anything short of that we have failed or been Direct in our duty amen so we must understand the context of Love versus affection now the foundation my brother and sister of Truth we can come and know that God spoke so strongly through the Apostle Paul that he said if there be any that would come and even change one word of this and let them be accursed and the reason was is there can only be one love letter there cannot be a multitude of Love Letters it has to be one love letter now I say this in humor amen it's just a human element uh brother Paul never never really was too much of a I don't know how you would say it but you know a lot of uh you know not a lot of young ladies said y'all you're our friend Paul but you know there was one young lady that wanted to have the title or the name of Mrs Paul heylet and after she had obtained that title she pulled out a huge box that was all the letters of girls that Paul had wrote through the years and she said you know what you're married now you have a wife and these letters now mean nothing to you foreign I hope you catch the connection my brother and sister this elect lady this bride of Jesus Christ is not here to have multiples of Love Letters but only one love letter amen only one that would would be and that's the one that has our heart that's the one that has our attention that is the one that is drawing us that's the voice that we hear and that is the voice we respond to Can someone say Amen to that amen so this Foundation of Truth is in its intrinsic value somewhat unexplainable how is it that we love let's just look in the natural for a moment amen if I was rude enough I would use our visitors for an example as they are newly married or are you still considered newly married yes the honeymoon is still happening amen that's good you see my brother and sister in the natural it's hard to explain now I don't mean to sound crass but you can have a whole row of beautiful holy ghost-filled girls and it would be their young man filled with the Holy Ghost and you would think you know what man he is a good looking young man he's got his pick you might say but really he doesn't because you see there is an intrinsic connection that is there of a whole row of young Godly ladies but they'll be the one that the life is a little different the approach the nature all of this is a little different and that is the one he's attracted to as we have the story of the uh the ranch wife you know the orphan girl there and uh the the ranch and and she's there and you know the armor Meat Packer's son comes my brother and sister in the flesh he should have been attracted to the rich girl finely dressed but he had a revelation aren't you glad God gives Revelation he had a revelation that this wasn't about the clothes that they wore this wasn't about the finery that they lived in or the culture that they had but this was about character and there's something in this relationship that draws a young man to a young woman and in that there's something that's there and you'll find after years and years we have those that have been married longer than we have but sister Jerry and I at 40 years there's just something about that that wild maniacal laughter that my wife has you all know what I'm talking about amen okay I've got the Ice broke my brother and sister if I don't hear that laughter I start to say where is she and I don't say that derogatory it's become very much a part of it I married it but you see there can't be another voice that's why in the natural the scripture says that a a wife amen has a voice that she's supposed to listen to she's supposed to listen to the Holy Ghost and she's supposed to listen to her husband and now I don't mean to go into this and I don't want to focus this but when they start to listen to voices that are contrary then it Causes Chaos and in the chaos there's friction and in the friction there's division and in division there's separation there's two voices we as the bride of Christ are called and that's to listen to the voice of the holy spirit in our day and to listen to the voice of the revealed word of the hour my brother and sister are not any other voices those voices too many voices just talking to brother Chris this morning sometimes we're going to cut out all the voices and just get it down to just very Simplicity of the voices my brother and sister because of too many voices too many opinions lead to too many thoughts too many thoughts lead to confusion and so it's there that we find this intrinsic value is unexplainable why are you attracted to the word this elect lady she's John is saying I love her because she's in truth she's in the truth and I love her he's recognizing that she herself has heard from God it's not her listening to the preacher it's not listening to this one over here and that one over there but she's listening to God this elect lady is she knows the voice she's supposed to listen to and she's listening to it and so it's there this intrinsic value is kind of unexplainable how God would take and lead you to truth is there not voices in the land amen young people I'm not picking on you today but I can assure you you can walk out of here today you could go on a phone you could go on a computer laptop iPad and there'll be so many voices dressed like this do this talk like this act like this it's all over voices voices voices and they say I want my own identity but they don't have an identity because there's only two identities on the face of the Earth and one of them is Jesus Christ and the other one is called Satan amen everything if I'm going to use the word and you'll forgive me for using it this way everything in this life is an impersonation we're either like the devil or we're like Christ there's no medium there's no substitute we're just listening to One Voice or the other I've done this before and I don't mean to make light of it and I don't want it to be offensive but when you see these young men and I know a few that dress that way and they're walking down this street and they have to walk like a jaybird to keep their pants up and you ask why are you doing this I have done this why do you dress like this I want to have my own identity then why is there ten thousand other young men just like you if this is your own identity you see it's a delusion my brother and sister and when the word of God said in the day that we're living that this churches would produce a certain identity my brother and sister if that identity does not have the name Mrs Jesus Christ attached to it and backed up by the word then she's impersonating something else am I preaching too strongly this morning you see God's not wanting us to fool around amen so look at this this connection that someone unexplainable is the connection between Christ and his church you see he went and he faced all of these things my brother and sister so that you would come today and I mean today literally the 21st day of May that you could sit here in the house of God and say thank you Lord for the Revelation that connected me to truth amen I don't need another connection I don't need a theological explanation I need a revelation that came from God and God alone I don't need someone to explain it yes we as preachers we like to explain things but what we really want is for you yourself to get a revelation directly from the Throne of God to your heart we can tell you young people how to live of what to do and not to do but until it becomes real to you it is just some old man telling you do and don't but when it becomes Revelation that rests down in your soul then you understand this intrinsic connection that you have had with Jesus Christ from the foundation of the world oh God how we should pray for that connection we should pray for that Revelation amen now the select lady as I got ahead of myself she only has one true love there's only one true love that there's there's nothing on this Earth amen they once pinned a song Take This horror world but give me Jesus a lot of people would say well I don't know if I could live in this house and have this kind of money and a car the boat the plane and the train you are not love you're not in love if that's even a consideration that you would trade your relationship with Jesus Christ for a house or both train a plane you're not in love but when one becomes in love and God would call you to the backside of the desert when God would call you my brother and sister come on I'm going to speak plane this morning okay amen how many of us have faced fiery trials in our lives come on let's be honest with ourselves we Face fiery trials things that we just it seems as though our world has crumbled but there's something inside of you that the final voice you cry out is Lord help me amen this is nothing less than this intrinsic relationship with Jesus Christ because if it was not there in your life in my life when that time of fiery trial come we would give up we would walk away we would say I'm finished I am not going to sacrifice like this but there's something down inside of us that we might drift away for a season but God's right there the whole time wooing us back pulling us by saying no I'm not letting go of you I can't let go of you because I'm in you and I can't let go of myself not the same relationship of a husband and a wife you can't go one that you ever truly was in love with you can't let go of them because they are a part of you um I hope you're catching the depth of this amen now look at this it's select lady one true love now the word says she's not in love with the world you say brother Paul that's not exactly the way this scripture says it says that if you have any love of the world the love of Christ is not in you but I'm telling you my brother and sister this bride of Christ has the love of Christ in her so therefore she's never been in love with the world she don't belong to the world the world don't belong to her she's in Christ amen that's the love affair of her life it doesn't matter whether she's rich or poor hot or cold in the uh you know the mountains or the deserts or wherever it might be none of that matters she has one love amen and I'll declare it this way today she is not in love with the world the world's made love to her cannot just be real blunt today the world's made love to her but it never brought the satisfaction the soul was longing for it never brought the satisfaction that the soul was crying for but the world has definitely made love to us amen it's offered as all kinds of fineries it's offered as all kinds of opportunities but that will never satisfy the elect lady because she's really has only the ability you say but I was in the world I was loving the world no the scripture's not talking about what you thought was love it's talking about what God Said was love and when we were in the world the love of the world that was in us because otherwise the world would have brought the satisfaction that we were looking for but when we look and we search and the satisfaction is not there then our true love is not there amen Hallelujah because I'm telling you today many people have settled for all the world's got to offer hmm we won't go into that but I could just give you some very Stark bold examples uh the declares of people that just Embrace this and say oh I I belong here well my brother and sister if you belong there and that's the love of your life it should bring a satisfaction that calms your soul gives you peace and settles you but you don't see that do you we see a world and turmoil we see ministries of some of the largest churches in America racked by Scandal you know what that tells me they didn't believe what they preached they actually didn't believe in a keeping power they didn't believe in a ceiling power because they themselves were still searching we could really deviate but I don't think Sunday morning is a good time or place too go into that you see the word as I said is declared that she's not in love with the world and she herself reminds me of a time if you don't mind bringing someone an example foreign countries setting their counseling a husband and wife that were having some issues their Pastor setting off to the sign he had tried to help them they didn't really want to accept his advice and as we're talking and I asked them what what are the issues that you're facing and the man did all the talking he said well this is how my wife feels oh I know as husbands we've done that haven't we Brothers this is my wife's favorite food this is her favorite color this is I tell you what I finally learned I'm afraid to voice those things and he speaks and says this is this and this is a situation and this is why my wife has a problem with this and this and he just went on and on and on and on and on finally I said okay brother quiet sister answer the question he was quiet all right because she countedicted everything he said she was you realize that the near Kinsmen will put the title of husband to the near Kinsmen one that is closer than I scripture he wanted to redeem he wasn't willing to pay the price but he's still here today even saying this is what she likes this is what she wants to be this is how she wants to look this is what she wants to listen to but the bride this elect lady give her a voice my brother and sister and today she has a voice and she's here to declare I want Christ and Christ alone I want the word of God pure and unadulterated I don't need it filtered for me I don't need it explained as it were for me I want to just see it living and I want to see it living in the preacher I want to see it living in everyone around me but more so than that I want to see it living in me because that's what matters can I speak boldly today the preacher might go to hell amen every other person that has influence might go to hell you are not obligated to get on the bus with them you have a desire to the word go to the word amen I hope that's not too straight for you today amen right look the words boldly declares that she has amen the love of Christ it boldly declares and that and my brother and sister I'm trying to just skip ahead I just realize I have way more stuff than I think I do amen so it's there that that she is boldly declaring that she is filled with the love of Christ and the love of Christ has a manifestation right my brother and sister if there is something there that Satan can use to hinder you recognize that as Satan but this bride of Christ this elect lady has something down in her heart and as she reads the word she hears the word she prays over the word that has to come to life now my brother and sister if you want to be a Madonna then you start dressing like a Madonna and you listen to Madonna's music and you watch every action of Madonna but you'll sometimes grow up and realize you are not Madonna and never will be but you can go out of the fellowship out of the word of God for 5 10 15 20 years and wake up one morning and the desire to serve God is still there it's still alive it's still moving you it's still calling your name why because you always were a son or daughter of God it wasn't a fanciful moment it wasn't an opinion it wasn't an emotion but it was God Christ himself down inside Hallelujah I hope I'm not preaching too forceful today amen this one happens when you sit for too many hours and too much of time to think amen I tell you the love of Christ has a manifestation don't you believe that amen a man says he loves his wife and mistreat her in every form or fashion amen I will say his words speak louder amen his actions I mean speak louder than his words do so this comes my brother and sister I want to say today I'm just lift my hand as a witness before you and before God let my actions show My Love to You Lord let my actions show my love to you Grace Tabernacle let the word of God come in such a fashion that we can Overlook the humanity side we can Overlook the isms and schisms as it is and realize we're a part of the body of believers do you realize my brother and sister if we acted on every hurt that come to our life we would not have a single person we claimed as a family member we would not have a single person we ever claimed as family we would not have friends we would have nothing because Humanity fails but my God your God never fails amen so why are we looking to humanity and judging where we're going with our life when we know that that Humanity has failed let's look to Christ and follow the word and move right into that perfect place that we can then be identified with confidence I'm the elect lady I'm the reason God sent a message a real live moving of the Holy Ghost in This Day I'm the reason God did that if you're on the same bus that's wonderful but I know for a fact God sent it for me amen he opened the word for me because he knew I needed a redeemer I needed Clarity I needed Clear Vision I needed a change in my life oh I want to say it once again Lord let my actions amen show My Love to You Lord amen Hallelujah you know I want to just share if I I can this morning if it'd be all right true story sister Jerry knows I might change some of the details odds are you'll never meet them but after just an incredible youth meeting in Chile there's a young man very gifted young man I'd kind of started a friendship I just really admired him as a young man and he asked me after Services brother Paul can I talk to you for a few minutes we just went over and sat down and he says now there's a young lady at first he was going to try and just camouflage it you know there's this young lady and he said oh forget it it's so and so and I said yeah I know who it is and he goes how do you know because it's obvious when you get around her you're all like well let me just turn a corner real quick when we come in the house of God it's just pretty obvious who's in love are you with me pretty obvious oh no we as humans we have a prescribed method if they're in love with the lord they're going to be the guy that's balancing on the corner of this Pew shouting Hallelujah and spinning around on his toe yeah he shows he's in love no sir there's something that radiates out from those Better In Love and he says brother Paul my own cousin knows how much I love this girl and my own cousin is competing for her well she's a pretty special girl she's a really wonderful girl don't look down on your cousin if he sees in her what you see in her amen and what even me as an old married man sees something special there why how can you look down on him he goes but he knows and I think he just does it to torment me I said well if you're not careful one of these days the torment will be look I'm engaged to your cousin he goes what do I do well they'll sit down I've got this couple big encyclopedias for you to read and the words in these encyclopedias are so big that you're going to need to get a dictionary and probably in 18 to 24 months you'll finally get through all of this have you showed her well I guess not he goes how do I show her I'm in love with her brother Paul I said well don't go ask sister Jerry if I'm any good at my advice but when you see her coming to the door do the quick two-step around her and then just smile at her when you're at a church Fellowship and you're getting up to go get Pepsi and you see her glasses empty don't stop and say oh can I fill your glass just walk by smile and grab her glass and come back with it full smile and set it in front of her and when all the young people are going to go do something don't get all weird and awkward just say hey you girls come on get in my car and she'll be comfortable because there's safety in numbers versus I love you I adore you would you ride in my car can I just drool and smile at you at the same time I give him a much more eloquent speech than that I said and not one time do you ever take possession never voiced anyone this is my girl let's show her that you love her by your actions are you with me did we make it back to the starting point by our actions five and a half years go by he sends me a message oh brother Paul I did it and I'm like what did you do he goes I'm engaged she's gonna marry me I said wow that took longer than I thought he said oh you don't understand brother Paul we we were a couple and then we fought and then speak to each other for six months pardon me but I thought that was interesting brother Stephen sharing at Camp last year I took him and Sister Sarah so long to become engaged this young man he was like then we were an item again and then we didn't talk and I said so what was going on oh we had to grow up and the minute he came to maturity and she came to maturity recognized it's not about these little things that we make such an issue but it's about that deep enduring love and we show we care and I want to ask you if you have abided and you have stayed on the path can anyone here today say our lord Jesus has not showed us he cares could we lift a hand and testify he doesn't care about me no sir you know what's happened we've had to grow up and as we grow up spiritually we recognize God has been every step by step with us everywhere we go he's held the doors for us he's refilled us when we were empty he's fed us when we were hungry he's expressed in the sunrise and the sunset I love you but we had to grow up because you see God cannot take an immature bride he needs us to grow up now not after the Rapture we got to grow up here and now and show the maturity I believe your word I will stand with you I will love you I will take your name whether it's through the fire through the flood through the famine to the deserts I will do this and then we'll wake up one day and realize he has been every step of the way with us and I thought he left anyway they're happily married today amen I just can't help believe when you put two Fireballs in a room that something isn't going to catch on fire every once in a while Hallelujah so you know what if you're Fireball and he's a fireball and whatever don't think you made a mistake just because the napkins burst into flame at the table because you disagree about something just grow up Paul grow up because the more we come into maturity we move from affection to love and we've got to move to this place of love in the word amen that there's nothing you know the scripture says if we won't leave houses and lands and father mother sister and brother for the gospel we're not even Worthy what no not father mother sister brother let me add a little bit husband wife see God 's not wanting you to have an affection to him he's wanting you to be deeply intrinsically in love with him that there's nothing else on this Earth has the value your place in Christ amen I'm not I'm not digging too deep in your lives are you I don't say this jokingly but my brother and sister I'd rather have the scrape and need the Band-Aid than never be touched by the word at all hmm okay now in first John 2 and 24 we're going to just go through that really really quick because I didn't realize as I unzipped the file that there was so much there 2 and 24 amen let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning so what we heard in the beginning we ought to stick with Amen in that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you you also continue in the son and in the father this is the promise that he has promised us even eternal life now my brother and sister it really comes down to the fact that when the man says now I'm going to put this in a humorous context so you'd understand when the man says that I will this and that and whatever in the natural trying to win the girl amen he wants to win the girl married Brothers we wanted to win the girl did we not amen we didn't like yeah there's others if she doesn't no sir we want to win the girl now sometimes we'll promise a lot I told sister Jerry when we were courting that I'd buy her a Mercedes with a sunroof and I did one day only it looked like a truck it wasn't her idea she was looking at a 450 SL convertible and she's like yeah praise God he's gonna buy me a Mercedes someday I bought her a 5-ton Mercedes diesel truck that just happened to have a sunroof and I fulfilled every promise I ever made to her in our courtship now that's not fair is it that's misleading but we cannot hear today and say what God has promised to you and I that he ever misled us in one single thing someone say Amen God's never misled us amen so it's there that he has promised eternal life and I stand here today banking my whole life everything that I am amen look Saints I don't do this for exercise I don't do this for fun I don't get up here and preach because I just feel some compelling urge to stand up and talk to you I stand here because I believe this with all of my life everything that is in the fiber of my being I believe this and something inside of me says speak Paul and I have to share this my brother and sister he gave me eternal life and I believe it amen these are the things concerning them that seduce you but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you amen so that anointing from The Seducer my brother and sister cannot displace this call of God in your life you need not that any man teach you this is the Holy Ghost but as the same anointing teaches you of all things and is true this is why I made this statement I said earlier that we need to listen to the Holy Ghost amen we need to quit I don't want you to listen to me I want you to go back to the word and let God speak to you it's not what the preacher said brother Paul said brother Paul said why what does the word say to you you've got to get in the word let the word speak to you well I'm of this Camp I'm of this camp this is my pastor this is my pastor no we need to go this is my God and this is his word and this is his holy spirit speak to me Lord amen amen and I'm going to just hurry uh quickly along here why is God doing this why is God doing this to make you mark off and check off the things I was a good person here I was a good person no God's actually wanting to build confidence in you God wants to put confidence in you to the place that when he says I'd like you to stop right here that you can stop and have a confidence this is where God wants me to be in the most improbable of times if he says go forward and we have that kind of confidence in we'll go forward my brother and sister God's not doing it for some checklist of obedient disobedient good or bad he wants to build confidence in you in the word of God Amen because in the day that we're coming it says it would be so closer to see the very elective possible now we know brother Branham said that you can't be deceived that the word's in you amen but I want you to understand this that we in the human element we are humans here is there any AI present we're humans do any of you ever come to a confidence issue come on let's let's be honest I'm 61 years old I used to have no problem climbing on three four five story building roofs and hanging over the edge pounding nails and doing whatever I now have confidence issues step ladders are pretty tall Life Changes and where we used to say I'm a confident Christian I'm confident in my relationship and then we have things happen and our confidence goes away and God says you know what I need you to have confidence in my word I need you to have confidence in me and so what is he doing he then calls on us I won't read the scripture but he says I need you to make your calling an election sure what is it not a question mark am I saved am I not saved do I have the Holy Ghost I don't have the Holy Ghost it's not that kind of question my brother and sister God wants you to go back and he wants you to go in the word and he wants you to be able to say I have followed the word I believe the word the word is alive to me it's so real let me put it in a simple analogy have any of you ever flown most every one of you at some point in time amen even those of you that didn't raise a hand didn't get here by boat okay no I want to ask you again did any of you ever fly come on you got more muscles come on Sister Miriam I'm going to call you out I'm gonna call you out you didn't make it here by boat plane or train hey man hey man I'm just looking for a little bit of muscle reaction to say I've ever flown now look okay I'm sorry sister Miriam I apologize I just couldn't help myself but look at this now you're going to get on the plane I want to just just interact with me okay let's not take ourselves too serious today I'll tell you what happens to Paul boarding flight 1524 to Seattle zone two come on baby let's go on the way up there the kiosk is there gate 24 yep seat 19. this is you know what that comes from the time that Paul being so Gallant and chivalrous said here honey I'll take care of the tickets here's your ticket sister Jerry gets up there to the little thing hey lady just to you man well he's like let me see it uh ma'am this was your last flight do you have a ticket oh oh here it is I know it's a poor analogy but you see what God's wanting us to do pull the word out I am redeemed I've been washed in the blood I've got the Holy Ghost and I'm in love with him make your calling an election sure the ticket worked on one flight my brother and sister but it's not going to work on any other God has got a calling for you and I for today don't go back and say I was on fire for God five years ago that's not going to worry I'll be on fire for God five years from now make your calling an election sure today my brother and sister all we got to do is stop and we have the ticket it's called the word of God and look at that and say Lord I'm not here just to do a check off but I'm here because I am in love with you and I want to be in a marriage supper of a lamb I want to stand before your throne I want to dwell in your presence Lord and I'm willing to put the effort today to look back at my life and look back at my circumstance and make my calling and election sure amen hallelujah just remember me the next time you go again on a plane and tell me if it ain't true that you don't look at that ticket more than once before you get up there because if not you're Supreme I'd also have done the same thing with it on the phone you know me Mr technology Ben you know Jerry how do you find this thing Jerry yeah right here here you go Paul in my pocket doo doo doo finally get up there nothing picture of my family how did that happen cherries down the walkway ah and the lady looks at me I think you guys will think this is funny I have a husband just like you hand me the phone thank you ma'am there you go don't lose your phone I'll say yes Mom now look my brother and sister sorry for my poor analogies but it don't matter how modern we are and how the church today looks at the word of God God is still wanting you to make your calling an election sure we can't count on this man's Revelation and on that man's Revelation that God wants to speak to you and I in person that we can literally get up in the morning of the worst day of your life and say I Am Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God I can do this I am getting myself ready now forgive me for my silly analogies I need to move forward here time is so fleeting amen you see we're not here to just have a conversation about righteousness we are here to be righteousness Amen Let the word become more than just words let it become an action now Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I like this you see you know brother Brown told us at one point in time that um we should identify ourselves in the word of God now I didn't really say identify yourself in a quote he said identify yourself in the word of God but you know if y'all don't mind for just a moment I'm just going to take this point if you'll give me liberty I like it when I can find myself even in the message of the hour and God's word is a seed and you Farmers here hello any of the rest of you able to take that position sorry about that and you Farmers here you know if you put a seed in the ground and take care of it right if it's in the right kind of ground it'll produce what the seed is God's word is a seed and if you put it in the right kind kind of of ground of faith and treat it right it'll produce just what it is if it's for healing it'll produce healing salvation Salvation joy joy and every promise in the Bible is true and just remember you can take me to record for this that the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you can take the right attitude toward that promise now I've had people tell me oh that's just psychology well I'm telling you my brother and sister when you get in positions of life and you understand that there are things that are much greater to you and things you don't understand there's times you just have to believe I did a little math this morning just on that line and I've already forgotten the numbers but I'll just tell you in the last few weeks I have put millions and millions of seeds in the ground has cost me uh well up in the in the tens of thousands multiple tens of thousands of dollars for that seed now do you think that I just blindly go out there and spend tens and tens of thousands of dollars hoping that seed will come up no sir Saints I have done everything within my power to create the right atmosphere to place that seed I use the finest quality of Planters I use Aquinas quality of fertilizer I have worked the ground not too fine and not too coarse and I've done all of this so that I can plant the seed and there I can set and say well praise God praise God I know that the seed will work amen why well I don't know I've never planted a seed before and I'm just hoping no no no no I know the seed that I'm planting I know what I have done I've perfected it over 30 years by God's grace I hope you guys don't think I'm crazy to try and tie this into a spiritual context but in the natural part of life there's few things that still create the thrill as driving by and seeing all these beautiful little green lines going and disappearing up over the hill now if I come tomorrow and there's no more green in the field I don't just say oh it'll get better I would have to find out why it changed because you know what my expectation is it was this big today called the spike it's that big tomorrow and it's that big the day after and it's not big the day after and it's that big that after am I boring you you know why because we checked the calling put the seed in the ground this is what it is it's going to be a corn field is there life in the seed the test on the label says that 98.7 percent of those seeds have a life in them I had certainty when I planted that field just so you all know the conclusion of that it's about that tall now because the life is in the seed I don't care what the man out here says I don't care what the man out there says what I know is my God said I put a seed in you and it's a seed Gene of myself it is me myself and you it's not a sea Gene of a message church here and of a Methodist Church here and a Nazarene Church there and of this over here it was God that said I put the sea Gene in you and it will grow and produce exactly what I called it to oh now it's my responsibility I I I'm closing amen sister vika help me close amen now look my brother and sister this corn is beautiful it's growing so quickly I I'm just so impressed amen I'm so happy but you see I if I don't water it I'm not gonna have a crop if I don't fertilize it it's not going to grow to its full potential amen let's wash the seed that God gave us amen we get the idea that the washing of the water of the word is just simply scrubbing away or mistakes no my brother and sister whenever we come in the presence of almighty God that water of the word soaks down into our souls and we start to realize yes I need to change some things in my life but I'll tell you God loves me and I'm here to serve him he's an awesome God he's a faithful God I believe him when he said I gave you eternal life and we live like we have eternal life there's a difference going to church and living like you have eternal life I don't want you to be church goers this morning I want you to be the livers the life eternal being manifested from God's word Hallelujah oh my [Music] my oh my [Music] we'll just call it good right there let's just stand amen you know sometimes we as preachers we preach the same thought from 42 different directions and then we'll tell you well I didn't finish my sermon it's because I didn't give you version 43. or four or five but God's good God's good amen let's be faithful take his name live let's not be affectionate to be in love amen Hallelujah you know if any of you ever wonder some of the best counsel for marriages can be I feel you're a fussing and a fine place a Bible in the middle of the table sit on each side hold hands and hold the Bible and then just fight to your heart's content because if you're a real Christian you can't fight while you're hanging on to the Bible because the word has that much power in the life of a Believer when the devil's there trying to convince you that you're not [Music] take holds of your Bible you say this is silly Paul okay I'm silly Bible sit down at the same table you would have sat down with anyone else and tell the devil go ahead take holds of the word and let's argue let's fight this out devil you ever realize the devil's not going to do that the word of God he knows he's defeated by the word every single time if you haven't been in the word Saints you haven't been handling your Bible you haven't been sitting at the table as it were with your Bible please start you want to win the argument with the devil then start by taking the greatest tool that God ever gave you amen the word of God and prayer Hallelujah and the devil won't know what to do with you amen but I'll tell you what now if this sounds personal to you I'm sorry this is what God's speaking to me right now if you have a spirit of defeat on you what you need to do is not walk out of this building till you'll take a moment it'll take forever but you need to close your eyes and say Lord break the spirit of defeat that is on me that I can have Victory because I am a daughter of God I am a Son of God and I refuse to accept defeat from the enemy Hallelujah Hallelujah I feel the pull amen 223 amen just so our visitors would know sometimes as I'm studying these songs come upon my heart come upon my thoughts and I I just

Hallelujah can we just lift our hands amen just thank the Lord today he's guarded all the control you say brother Paul it's been a hard Road he knew he knew my brother and sister will stand one day the word says that he will judge the world by his bride by your life oh surely God has called you to a high calling for a purpose amen he didn't say I'm going to make it easy for you because you're my wife but the prophet of God says you know that God tested you here so you won't be judged later now would someone be able to say thank you Lord for the test here thank you Lord for the tests here hard tests Lord where I thought you had abandoned me hard tests but Lord I've already passed the test that I won't be judged there oh surely our hearts would say thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord hallelujah amen 462 brother Gideon Saints I trust foreign [Music] you're going to speak in a certain way you believe it's all it's down this road everything that God gives you everything that's on the notes everything that's there is all relevant but God takes you another Avenue I believe in God's Divine leadership I believe God cares about every single one of you and your need because he has an expected end for you and let me just remind you Brian elect lady his expense expected end for you is not hell the devil might say don't worry about it doesn't matter anyhow I'm here to tell you God's expected end for you is the streets of Glory a mansion worshiping Before the Throne the marriage supper of the Lamb to be able with joy and Thanksgiving Praise Him for eternity that's his expected in for you when the devil tells you any different you just remind him he's always been a liar amen hallelujah God's attributes were manifested to his right in this last day he had called the Revelation by the last prophet's message and we know who we are and what we raise up for praise the Lord the original Light original life the original sea there is [Music] reveal the seven seal is until the original line The Original Seed we are the word made flesh today this what the scriptures say and our names are seen within we're deemed and perfect without sin yes we are dead and inspired by our God it was the original life the original life the original sea the original word is what I believe a son of man is revealed the seven seal is a faith the original Life The Original Seed our eyes of understanding is [Music] ours who were chained down in the past [Music] we have responded to our god the original Lie the original [Music] original life the original sea [Music] for

it's a question in the mind people say is the seventh seal unveil well I hope it is let me put it to you this way I hope it is because it's Jesus Christ and if it's not unveiled where are we at I tell you what I was called this late hour say but brother Paul how do we know just how late our we are well I'll tell you what they're doing they're rejecting the creature Jesus Christ to save the creation I mean I I don't get into that stuff but everywhere we go the greenhouse gas is going to kill us the CO2 is going to kill us there's going to be no more water on the earth we're all dying we need to get rid of all the Misfits we need to get rid of all the religious people and let us be Gods into ourselves so we can save this Earth my Bible says that's the end time amen it's everywhere we go I
