[37:40] land amen praise the
[37:44] Lord man looking forward to that one
[37:47] day amen if you have your Bibles tonight
[37:50] let's turn over
[37:51] to 1
[37:54] Corinthians chapter 2
[38:15] 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and verse
[38:25] 14 but the natural man receiveth not the
[38:28] things of the spirit of God for they are
[38:30] foolishness unto him neither can he know
[38:33] them because they are spiritually
[38:35] deserved amen but he that is spiritual
[38:39] yes good all right praise the Lord he
[38:43] that is spiritual judgeth all things yet
[38:45] he himself is judged of no
[38:50] man for who
[38:53] hath excuse me let's start over verse 14
[38:57] now that we've got the sound here fixed
[38:59] be be distracted says but the natural
[39:03] man receiveth not the things of the
[39:05] spirit of God but for they are
[39:07] foolishness unto him neither can he know
[39:10] them because they are spiritually
[39:11] discerned but he that is spiritual
[39:14] judgeth all things yet he himself is
[39:17] judged of no man for who hath known the
[39:20] mind of the Lord that he may instruct
[39:22] him but we have the mind of Christ amen
[39:26] so we pause there and say well
[39:29] Paul um how's that
[39:33] work how can the natural man not receive
[39:37] the things of the spirit of God yet we
[39:39] have the mind of Christ right he's not
[39:42] talking about he's not selecting those
[39:44] of the world saying they're natural
[39:46] you're natural just me and you are super
[39:48] or super what we are me and you are
[39:50] natural for a natural man he says a
[39:53] natural man cannot receive those things
[39:55] of the spirit of God for foolishness to
[39:58] the natural right that's right that's
[40:00] why when you don't feed the spiritual
[40:01] the natural man says what are you doing
[40:03] in
[40:04] church it's nice
[40:08] outside or what is all of this you know
[40:10] because it's
[40:12] invisible can't see
[40:14] it but he says but you have the mind of
[40:17] Christ
[40:18] amen we just want to look at that
[40:21] tonight and by God's grace look at this
[40:25] impossible combination
[40:28] let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we ask
[40:30] that you'd come and speak to our hearts
[40:31] tonight Lord some things of the
[40:34] scriptures Lord are
[40:35] just far
[40:38] beyond actually lord they're all far
[40:40] beyond our finite Minds because you are
[40:45] Eternal and by by inheritance so are
[40:49] your
[40:50] words I pray Lord you'd speak to us
[40:52] tonight help us Lord just to maybe some
[40:55] of us are tired or what not I pray you
[40:59] just bring an atmosphere Lord father we
[41:01] already feel you near may you just come
[41:03] now and speak to us Lord as the as the
[41:05] words would come forth as the
[41:06] foolishness of preaching may you grab a
[41:08] hold of the word and and Lodge it in our
[41:11] hearts Lord mine as well Lord I want to
[41:13] hear from you tonight Lord Jesus I pray
[41:15] you just come and help us father this
[41:17] evening may you speak to us in Jesus
[41:20] Christ's name we pray amen you can be
[41:22] seated
[41:24] tonight so
[41:29] if we could
[41:31] uh take tonight this thought is finite
[41:35] being re finite being receiving infinite
[41:39] thoughts and my subtitle is Eternal Word
[41:42] transferred into
[41:44] time and uh sometimes you have these
[41:47] titles
[41:48] and um then you then you put pin to page
[41:52] and you say well Lord It's the
[41:53] inspiration that you have because the
[41:56] notes hardly match the title but God
[41:59] inspiration in in my heart that it's
[42:01] just been all of these different things
[42:04] my wife asked me do you know what you're
[42:05] preaching earlier today and and I said
[42:08] well I've just for weeks just had
[42:10] thoughts here and meditating over here
[42:12] and hearing brother brandham say this
[42:13] and and the reading of scripture here
[42:15] and and it all just kind of floating and
[42:18] moving together all kind of related in a
[42:20] way and and sometimes that inspiration
[42:22] in your heart just you feel like you
[42:25] fail to put it on the page so as we
[42:27] always should I'm depending on the Lord
[42:29] tonight to speak to us but taking this
[42:32] this thought here and and a lot from
[42:34] this scripture or Paul says you know the
[42:36] natural man can't receive the spirit of
[42:38] God it's foolishness to him and then he
[42:41] says he says he that is spiritual
[42:44] judgeth all all things yet he himself is
[42:47] judged of no man so so Spirit of Christ
[42:50] judging you right but this focus of that
[42:52] we have the mind of Christ so let's go
[42:55] to chapter 3 and let's keep reading
[42:57] here at 3:1 says and I speak and I
[43:01] Brethren could not speak unto you as
[43:03] unto spiritual but as as unto carnal
[43:06] even as unto babes in Christ I have fed
[43:09] you with milk and not with meat for
[43:11] hitherto you were not able to Bear it
[43:14] neither yet now are you able for you are
[43:17] yet carnal for where whereas there is
[43:19] among you EnV envying and strife and
[43:22] divisions are you not carnal and walk as
[43:24] men for while while one say say I am of
[43:27] Paul and another I am of Apollos are you
[43:30] not carnal who then is Paul and who is
[43:33] Apollos but ministers by whom you
[43:36] believed even as the lord gave to every
[43:38] man so so he's
[43:40] saying you want the meat of the word you
[43:44] got to get rid of envying and strife
[43:46] these divisions don't walk carnal don't
[43:48] think
[43:49] carnal don't walk as men right you're
[43:52] well how did that work you're a natural
[43:55] man it works the same way it does that
[43:56] you as the natural man can be take on
[43:58] the mind of
[44:00] Christ the same combination Paul's
[44:03] continuing his sermon and he says who
[44:06] then is Paul who is Apollos but
[44:07] ministers by whom you believe even as
[44:09] the lord gave to every man I have
[44:11] planted Apollos watered but God gave the
[44:15] increase so then neither is he that
[44:17] planteth anything neither he that WTH
[44:20] but God that giveth the increase so it's
[44:23] God it always is God it always will be
[44:25] God that moves in our heart and he's the
[44:28] one that makes this connection right so
[44:30] so you you are a you are an you are an
[44:33] act actual attribute of
[44:36] God and before we um let's go to Genesis
[44:41] 1 vers 1-3 really quickly in the
[44:43] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[44:45] Earth and the Earth was was without form
[44:47] and void and darkness was upon the face
[44:50] of the deep and the spirit of God moved
[44:53] upon the face of the waters and God said
[44:55] let there be light and there was light
[44:58] brother Bron makes a statement he says
[45:00] he says there is no light without
[45:03] God why is that because it was God's
[45:06] word
[45:07] spoken you know it's just I'm trying not
[45:11] to keep this from just because of the
[45:13] inspiration but slow down so you get it
[45:17] because if it just turns into mumble
[45:21] jumble so in in the beginning right we
[45:24] have we have time and you you can't have
[45:27] light outside of time time light is is
[45:31] is I'm not going to get too technical
[45:33] here but light is is is particles moving
[45:35] across time so God saids in the
[45:38] beginning so God laid forth time he laid
[45:41] forth the dimension that we live in
[45:43] right now he set it in motion and then
[45:45] he said let there be light and so his
[45:48] word spoke so now light has a place to
[45:53] live right before there was before there
[45:56] was light was just all of darkness and
[45:58] I've heard it said that light is an
[46:00] element used to measure the how old
[46:02] things are on the earth so how do you
[46:05] measure past when light was so light
[46:08] didn't used to be now light is because
[46:10] God spoke it but you see it was always
[46:13] in the mind of God and and you see
[46:16] brother bam talks about this and I think
[46:17] it's in the church age book and uh but
[46:20] he's he's it is the church age book and
[46:22] he's talking about he says I jumped way
[46:25] ahead guys it's the Smur Church Church
[46:27] AG he says thus the thoughts of God are
[46:29] Eternal they are real they are not
[46:32] simply like a man with a blueprint who
[46:34] has drawn up and which one day will be
[46:37] translated into substance sorry for how
[46:40] small that is and form but they are
[46:42] already real and eternal and part of God
[46:46] so you have to remember God is eternal
[46:49] he created time ready in the beginning
[46:52] first time of
[46:54] measurement God created time and into
[46:57] time he set forth his word so so his
[47:00] this is not his his thoughts are not
[47:03] potentially substance they are currently
[47:08] substance so you say well God's I am
[47:11] God's thought expressed and because
[47:12] we're humans you know we made up
[47:15] words to express what happens around us
[47:19] we made up language and we looked and we
[47:21] said oh that is
[47:23] chair right so when God said in the when
[47:26] God spoke and said let there be light
[47:28] did he say it in
[47:35] English there was no English right now
[47:40] you can argue with me about the
[47:41] beginning where everyone spoke the same
[47:42] language and God divided languages sure
[47:44] whatever but before men be to St talk to
[47:47] each other there was no language it was
[47:49] a way to express our thoughts to each
[47:51] other but we are F infinite finite thank
[47:55] you finite I don't want to mess that up
[47:57] tonight we are finite we we are we are
[48:00] created by God we are we are creatures
[48:02] of light so we didn't have no beginning
[48:06] we had a beginning the natural man had a
[48:09] beginning So when you say well well God
[48:12] I am you know God had a thought and he
[48:14] expressed it and that's how we talk
[48:17] about it but if God's thoughts are real
[48:20] and they're substance they're not
[48:21] potentially substance they are currently
[48:24] substance
[48:27] how does they become how do they become
[48:30] expressed that is how we ex that's how
[48:33] we express that's how we talk about God
[48:36] transferring his word into
[48:39] time say oh God's thoughts are expressed
[48:42] no they're already were there they are
[48:44] currently substance they just are now
[48:46] made manifest in time because God is
[48:49] outside of time so he's looking at if if
[48:51] I could be so so plain he's looking at
[48:53] it say this is time and he says okay
[48:58] in his his will has a season and a time
[49:02] so God says it always were there you his
[49:05] thoughts were always there and it's just
[49:07] you know you stop and you think about
[49:09] this for too long you lose your
[49:11] mind but but you don't want to get
[49:13] technical you want to get spiritual so
[49:15] God thought you were always a substance
[49:17] in God's mind you always were an
[49:19] attribute because if you are part of God
[49:22] you then have the ability to receive God
[49:26] right receive his word because God's
[49:29] word is
[49:30] eternal his word is eternal his word is
[49:33] outside of time brother random says and
[49:36] now we're back to the first quote there
[49:37] gentlemen things that are to be he said
[49:39] God in the beginning being the infinite
[49:41] God he's infinite and we're the finite
[49:45] his mind is so much greater and we are
[49:48] our we in our little finite mind cannot
[49:52] understand his great Infinite Wisdom
[49:56] but therefore when he speaks
[49:59] anything it may seem very strange to
[50:03] us to hear him say a certain thing in
[50:06] the scripture but it's got to
[50:09] happen just want to jump back real
[50:11] quickly on the fact that language and
[50:13] words you realize how much God
[50:15] condescended down yeah to interpret his
[50:19] thoughts in what we call words amen
[50:22] right he didn't leave up and and and
[50:25] hover up there and just just you know
[50:27] figure it out no he used our language to
[50:32] express
[50:33] himself to you and me so he calmed us it
[50:36] it down he you know little little us
[50:41] right creatures of time first second
[50:44] third right like time matter this
[50:47] Dimension yet he put He
[50:51] transferred this down so that we could
[50:53] get a hold of it amen you see so so much
[50:57] more than him coming down and living as
[50:59] a man and and dying on a cross it's him
[51:03] condescending to in communicate amen
[51:06] with me and you amen he brought his
[51:08] words what through the prophets why
[51:11] because God's words are Eternal you
[51:14] can't put a finite meaning and finite
[51:18] interpretation to them you have to have
[51:20] a man you have to have a being that has
[51:22] an open channel from the dimension that
[51:25] God dwells in to bring that down through
[51:27] into your dimension but the B talks
[51:29] about it all the time he said there's
[51:30] words voices floating through the
[51:32] atmosphere but you tune the radio in you
[51:34] can pick it up so God's words is
[51:37] floating through but he picked a vessel
[51:40] an anointed Prophet who has access to
[51:43] those words to bring them down to our
[51:45] Dimension God really does care about
[51:48] you so he goes on to say
[51:55] here he said says cannot understand his
[51:58] great infinite wisdom but therefore when
[52:00] he speaks anything it may seem very
[52:02] strange to us to hear him say a certain
[52:04] thing in scripture but it's got to
[52:07] happen I believe that his words will
[52:09] never pass
[52:12] away profound statement yeah because
[52:16] guess what if God's words are Eternal
[52:19] they never started that's right and they
[52:21] will never End Amen in order for
[52:23] something to end it has to start amen
[52:27] wrap your head around that that you are
[52:29] an attributing God somewhere somehow
[52:31] before there was even light time or
[52:35] matter thank goodness we don't have to
[52:37] understand that to make
[52:41] it but it's this it's this transferring
[52:44] right that's our subtitle Eternal Word
[52:46] transferring into time
[52:49] how how can Eternal mesh with time time
[52:54] is beginning and ending Eternal is not
[52:56] the how do the two go together you can't
[52:59] because you can't have Heaven and Hell
[53:00] at the same
[53:01] time right you can't have you you the
[53:04] the spirit of man the your spirit within
[53:06] you God comes in he pushes it out this
[53:09] what now you are a new creature in
[53:10] Christ because Christ pushes out that
[53:13] Spirit you still got the
[53:14] flesh right that flesh becomes the more
[53:17] subject to the spirit of God but the two
[53:19] can't dwell dwell together you
[53:22] know praise the Lord as soon as Jesus as
[53:25] soon as Jesus got off the boat from the
[53:27] Sea of Galilee the demons came the demon
[53:30] and the man came running down to what
[53:32] why are do you why are you here and what
[53:34] do you want because they instantly
[53:37] become subject because heaven is
[53:39] present so now me and you when we live
[53:42] our lives and we're we're sealed to God
[53:44] Heaven is
[53:46] present you know I I before this became
[53:49] known to me in a greater way you know
[53:51] we'd go to hotel rooms and traveling
[53:53] around and and you think oh we got to
[53:54] let's pray and bless the room but
[53:56] sometimes we would forget and I would I
[53:58] would Ponder why is there already such
[54:00] an atmosphere in here because the two
[54:03] can't dwell together so we step into
[54:05] that room guess what all those demons
[54:06] whoever was there
[54:08] before away they go they are subjected
[54:11] to you you are you you as a child of God
[54:14] you can't be possessed by a demon
[54:17] because you're already possessed by
[54:19] Christ the the womb right the womb the
[54:22] womb has been sealed nothing else can
[54:24] get inside of there amen amen but how
[54:26] how how does how how in the world does
[54:28] the Eternal Word of God come down and
[54:30] dwell inside of me and you because you
[54:33] have eternal
[54:34] quality you are not what the world
[54:37] thinks you are you are not even what you
[54:39] think you are before the foundation of
[54:42] the world you are in the mind of
[54:44] God so therefore there is a literal part
[54:47] of you that
[54:48] Eternal that is
[54:51] predestination that is that seed Gene of
[54:53] God we talk about without that you do
[54:56] not have a communicator to Heavenly
[54:59] places that's your
[55:01] antenna that is your connection to you
[55:04] know the radio right and there is none
[55:07] of this
[55:08] okay no there's a Clear
[55:12] Connection the only time that connection
[55:14] is broke is when we put the antenna down
[55:16] and say I got this
[55:18] God but you keep in tune to the word now
[55:21] you are receiving messages of Grace from
[55:24] eternity
[55:26] why because it's a spoken word through
[55:29] the foolishness of preaching
[55:32] amen written words will not save you
[55:35] that's right spoken word will amen why
[55:39] because when God's words are spoken
[55:41] there's something happening Beyond this
[55:43] Dimension something that is going and
[55:46] coming down inside of you and changing
[55:48] you to push back against this lifetime
[55:50] in matter because if we confined
[55:52] ourselves to this we would never
[55:55] understand God right you cannot do it
[55:58] the believer what walks in Heavenly
[56:01] places he says but it's it's God to
[56:04] happen he says I believe that his words
[56:06] will never pass away therefore I believe
[56:08] that God knowing that we in that we in
[56:11] our little finite mind could not
[56:14] interpret his great mind
[56:18] ready he transferred his internal word
[56:22] into time amen let's read what he
[56:24] actually says he interprets his own word
[56:27] yes sir how does God interpret his word
[56:30] he brings it to pass amen why does he
[56:33] bring it to pass because we're creatures
[56:34] of
[56:37] time his word over time God says look
[56:41] you're already
[56:42] healed but over the course of
[56:45] time you see the manifestation of that
[56:49] so God not only not only did God condent
[56:52] to use our language to communicate to us
[56:55] but he G giv you the promise over time
[56:59] because we understand
[57:02] time sometimes it's instant
[57:04] Miracle sometimes it's not but it's the
[57:06] progression of he uses 's
[57:09] progression to build your character
[57:12] that's right you say but God's Eternal
[57:14] you're right he he he doesn't need time
[57:18] he uses it because we understand time so
[57:22] he uses that to build the character
[57:24] inside of you Thea that builds from his
[57:28] word from the victories that
[57:32] you the victories that you receive in
[57:34] your
[57:36] life because John said God is is
[57:45] light I think there's just so much here
[57:48] we just have to think about because if
[57:50] God is light and he spoke light into
[57:52] existence and brother said you can't
[57:54] have light without God
[57:57] every day the sun
[57:58] rises every night the moon shines every
[58:02] night the Stars
[58:04] glow God is present
[58:09] amen so the actual elements that make up
[58:11] your body guess what they need they need
[58:13] light
[58:14] amen so God
[58:16] testifying even in the natural how much
[58:19] you need
[58:20] light the light says it's time to get
[58:24] up the light says it's time to to go to
[58:27] sleep the man said we can fix that so
[58:30] they made lights and now we're all tired
[58:33] and hooked up on
[58:40] caffine praise God he doesn't need any
[58:43] interpreter he interprets his own word
[58:45] by vindicating that word in its season
[58:50] amen now I've already kind of talked
[58:53] about light but I have this slide here
[58:55] because I've been thinking a lot about
[58:57] light because
[59:00] because there was a time when there was
[59:02] no
[59:03] light and light is is an integral part
[59:06] of everything that we
[59:09] do everything we do revolves around
[59:12] light hey you got a light you got a
[59:15] flashl you know it's dark is is the
[59:18] light is the power light on I got a
[59:22] problem is the light on right I mean
[59:24] everything we use light to indicate on
[59:27] or off charging or not
[59:31] charging right we have we have phones
[59:33] and with with
[59:34] lights we use those lights to interpret
[59:38] everything someone who who's
[59:41] blind they needed those that know the
[59:44] light to interpret the world to
[59:48] them and and and and and T light can't
[59:52] exist outside of time light as we know
[59:54] it cannot exist outside of time
[59:56] it needs it cuz light travels across
[59:59] time that's how you see it that's how
[1:00:01] you see something you know we we have
[1:00:03] the the light year and that's just
[1:00:04] simply a a way to determine how how uh I
[1:00:09] can't remember never mind I'm not going
[1:00:10] to go there but light doesn't exist
[1:00:12] outside of time brother in Revelations
[1:00:14] 21:23 he says and the city had no need
[1:00:16] of the sun neither of the moon to shine
[1:00:19] in it for the glory of God did lighten
[1:00:22] it and the lamb is the light thereof you
[1:00:24] ever wondered why because there is no
[1:00:27] time there that's right it is so light
[1:00:30] as we know it won't even work there
[1:00:32] that's right because there is no
[1:00:37] time so you need a different source of
[1:00:41] light the light of Eternity the light of
[1:00:44] a different
[1:00:49] dimension you
[1:00:52] see how much we just how much we
[1:00:56] interpret God through our
[1:00:58] finite thoughts says oh well light you
[1:01:01] know let there be light and well we'll
[1:01:03] argue about when there was light and if
[1:01:05] there was light and well in the
[1:01:06] beginning when and and and then the
[1:01:09] Earth was dark without for was there
[1:01:10] seeds there was there a previous
[1:01:12] civilization and we're confining God to
[1:01:15] our own interpretation of the world
[1:01:16] around us right and I think if we can
[1:01:19] break out of that box we'll see God in a
[1:01:22] greater way Amen brother says Jesus was
[1:01:25] the complete complete thoughts of God
[1:01:28] expressed so other words for the first
[1:01:30] time in history the complete logos amen
[1:01:35] walked in flesh amen amen you see before
[1:01:39] the cross there was a different kind of
[1:01:42] understanding of
[1:01:45] God he was God he was God on the
[1:01:47] mountain oh Moses you speak to us let
[1:01:50] not God speak to us he was a god of
[1:01:52] wrath and
[1:01:54] judgment prophet would come and and
[1:01:57] there would there was Parables and you
[1:01:58] know marrying the The Prostitute and
[1:02:00] having the children and all these things
[1:02:02] and they're going about their world
[1:02:04] there is no relationship so God the
[1:02:08] understanding of God
[1:02:10] shifted now Jesus is on Earth wow the
[1:02:12] complete
[1:02:14] logos so Peter says let's build the
[1:02:17] Tabernacles right here right and God
[1:02:20] says I am not
[1:02:22] done amen you see Peter what was he
[1:02:25] doing he was finite interpreting the
[1:02:30] infinite right that's it he was trying
[1:02:33] to interpret the thoughts of the
[1:02:35] infinite with his time bound mind amen
[1:02:40] you know time isn't even a isn't even
[1:02:42] you know we think we measure time but we
[1:02:45] don't really know you know I I read it
[1:02:48] me you know this is something man has
[1:02:50] created the measurement of time you say
[1:02:52] well the son yeah you know there's the
[1:02:54] days and the thing but 24 hours 12:00
[1:02:57] that's something we created oh it's been
[1:02:59] three days you know we created this
[1:03:01] that's right days right God doesn't know
[1:03:04] days he uses days in the Bible to
[1:03:07] describe to us an event he's talking
[1:03:09] about but he isn't days that's right
[1:03:12] he's not time so I can't I can't take
[1:03:16] credit for these but present is now and
[1:03:19] only
[1:03:20] briefly past exists only in our memory
[1:03:24] and the Future Never Comes it is simply
[1:03:28] imagined that's what we call time we
[1:03:31] punch a clock by it we set God by it
[1:03:38] that's it but God is not measured in
[1:03:41] time amen God is measured in light
[1:03:44] that's right God is measured well that
[1:03:46] sounded hypocritical because light
[1:03:48] doesn't exist outside a time but God is
[1:03:49] measured by his word yes right which is
[1:03:52] his will you see even when you preach
[1:03:55] God corrects you in mid sentence so you
[1:03:58] know even and I already said this used
[1:04:00] we know words we've created words to
[1:04:02] Simply express our thoughts but you
[1:04:04] think about God you know and and and the
[1:04:06] fact that that he is not he's not bound
[1:04:09] to this so let's go back I remember
[1:04:10] where I was Peter says let's build the
[1:04:11] Tabernacles but then God said I'm not
[1:04:14] done you you you can't oh goodness
[1:04:18] gracious Brother David brother Paul you
[1:04:19] just you got to get it out so so God is
[1:04:23] there and and he's present and he's he's
[1:04:26] logos complete but it's not enough why
[1:04:29] isn't it enough why are are they not
[1:04:33] made perfect without you that's right
[1:04:35] because God had to do something he had
[1:04:38] to bring the Eternal Word manifested in
[1:04:42] a finite being but he couldn't do that
[1:04:46] on Mount Transfiguration he couldn't do
[1:04:48] that on Mount Si he couldn't do it
[1:04:51] before the cross amen so he comes
[1:04:55] and he and he dies on the cross and now
[1:04:58] we have the first
[1:05:01] church but John has a
[1:05:03] vision and the angel says seal it
[1:05:07] up why John's there he saw the vision go
[1:05:10] tell everybody it wasn't the time that's
[1:05:14] right you see God using
[1:05:17] time the corn of the grain of we had to
[1:05:20] go into the ground because God had you
[1:05:22] and I in mind yes
[1:05:28] the devil's gospel is you are
[1:05:33] worthless the gospel of Christ is you
[1:05:36] are me in
[1:05:37] flesh this is God all this we're talking
[1:05:39] about God you have those attributes in
[1:05:42] you
[1:05:44] amen seal up those things so that means
[1:05:47] during the ages down through the church
[1:05:50] ages you know up to we always say uh you
[1:05:53] know Luther and Wesley I say that CU I
[1:05:55] don't remember the other ones by by
[1:05:57] memory but we come down through this
[1:06:00] then we have Pentecost right
[1:06:01] everything's good but we still don't
[1:06:03] have whatever it was that was sealed up
[1:06:06] so God is going to shift his expression
[1:06:09] in time amen he says oh well you know
[1:06:13] the seven seal and God needed to shift
[1:06:17] God needed to move something in time
[1:06:21] because he's outside of it his thoughts
[1:06:23] are currently substance they're not
[1:06:24] potential so it was always there but
[1:06:27] there was a time there was a season
[1:06:30] there was a place where he needed a
[1:06:31] complete manifestation of himself on
[1:06:34] Earth again amen and he couldn't do that
[1:06:37] with what John saw sealed up that's
[1:06:40] right he says well why because a part of
[1:06:44] God was still hidden amen that's right
[1:06:48] so you see it's just a matter another
[1:06:50] manifestation of Jesus in
[1:06:52] flesh so you go back and you say well
[1:06:55] yes through the Old Testament yes there
[1:06:56] was a part of God that was hidden from
[1:06:58] the people then Jesus came and he and
[1:07:01] brother man says he was the complete
[1:07:03] logos the complete thought of God in
[1:07:06] flesh
[1:07:07] amen so he has to do that
[1:07:11] again because he needs
[1:07:15] himself revealed in flesh today amen
[1:07:19] amen that's exactly so he took the word
[1:07:23] amen and now we have this sealed up word
[1:07:27] we have this this thing there
[1:07:30] and and so God did what he brought a
[1:07:33] prophet because the word says he has to
[1:07:37] come through the prophet amen that's
[1:07:39] right it is said in the word that we
[1:07:41] need all the word to be ready for a
[1:07:44] Rapture there was no Rapture back then
[1:07:48] that is here that is right now at the
[1:07:50] End of Time
[1:07:52] amen amen that's right so he brought the
[1:07:54] word now we had an an instrument we had
[1:07:57] a being who had a connection to that
[1:07:59] Dimension and God said it's
[1:08:02] time it's time now to transfer this
[1:08:06] Eternal Word into their Dimension amen
[1:08:09] amen that's right how in the world do I
[1:08:12] take on the mind of Christ when the
[1:08:15] natural man calls it
[1:08:18] foolishness because you were already in
[1:08:21] him before the foundation of the world
[1:08:25] so they had the potential to be you
[1:08:28] today but they were in the wrong time
[1:08:31] right that's it that's right but you're
[1:08:33] in the right time so the word
[1:08:36] transferred the Eternal thoughts of God
[1:08:39] transferred down in this time
[1:08:44] right perfects them that's exactly right
[1:08:48] because they need you to complete it
[1:08:50] amen you see the word why did God seal
[1:08:54] it why didn't God end it there because
[1:08:55] you didn't exist yet that's it how could
[1:08:58] God close things up when a part of him
[1:09:00] is still not
[1:09:02] exposed so you say well the word's been
[1:09:05] manifested yes but guess what if you are
[1:09:07] a part of God before the foundation of
[1:09:09] the world and you are not yet expressed
[1:09:13] amen God is not finished that's it
[1:09:15] because God cannot close time one day
[1:09:19] the book of time will be shut but he
[1:09:22] cannot do that until all of himself has
[1:09:25] been transferred into time amen amen
[1:09:28] because you are an actual Eternal
[1:09:32] attribute go the church age book that's
[1:09:34] not my words you are an actual attribute
[1:09:38] so you see the Seven Seals then is not a
[1:09:41] great mystery because it is you
[1:09:44] expressed it is you expressed today it
[1:09:47] is the Eternal Word of God coming down
[1:09:49] into
[1:09:50] time it is the Paradox of a finite being
[1:09:54] receiving infinite thought that's right
[1:09:56] amen because God's word is the thought
[1:09:58] expressed so at a time expressed is just
[1:10:03] simply a manifestation of Eternity in
[1:10:06] time so therefore there's parts of you
[1:10:09] there's parts of you not bound that's
[1:10:12] right to time that's right amen so you
[1:10:15] say well God is not bound by time hello
[1:10:18] that's right neither are you that's
[1:10:21] right are you an attribute of God or are
[1:10:23] you not cuz if you're not you're not
[1:10:25] bound by
[1:10:26] time driving through the mountains I was
[1:10:29] thinking about
[1:10:31] death and when you really begin to
[1:10:36] understand how God is Not somewhere up
[1:10:38] there you know God is just a little
[1:10:40] faster brother brandom says he's a
[1:10:42] little faster and then we in flesh here
[1:10:45] in time we have the ability to walk in
[1:10:47] Heavenly places because we literally
[1:10:49] have the word inside of us which is
[1:10:52] eternal so therefore sister Joanne is
[1:10:54] just a little faster that's right amen
[1:10:57] death is just simply something we have
[1:10:59] labeled that's right but God looks at it
[1:11:01] as a transferring old praise God a
[1:11:04] transferring of time to Eternity if he
[1:11:08] can transfer his word from eternity into
[1:11:10] time why can't he just pluck time out
[1:11:13] into eternity oh we're creatures of time
[1:11:16] so this robe of Flesh lays in the ground
[1:11:18] but the real you steps out of time and
[1:11:22] we say death death right but it's just
[1:11:26] the transfer amen amen amen it's just
[1:11:29] the transfer exactly right amen you know
[1:11:33] I made them statement a little bit
[1:11:36] ago how we measure time and the future
[1:11:39] is never comes it is simply
[1:11:42] imagine that's not true for God's
[1:11:44] promises they're not imagined that's
[1:11:48] right the thing about God's promises
[1:11:50] God's future promises amen exist right
[1:11:55] now exactly righten but you being a
[1:11:58] creature of time you have to come to
[1:12:01] that that's right you have to come to
[1:12:04] that
[1:12:05] place why because you're a creature of
[1:12:07] time that's right and God says you will
[1:12:10] move through
[1:12:12] time to the promise that's it but what
[1:12:15] gives you the faith in the promise the
[1:12:17] fact that it's already now amen he told
[1:12:20] Moses I am that I am that's it in other
[1:12:23] words he's always present that's right
[1:12:25] he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:12:27] today and forever that doesn't just mean
[1:12:29] his patterns are the same through time
[1:12:32] that's right that means that he always
[1:12:35] is that's it we quote Jesus Christ the
[1:12:38] same yesterday today and forever and
[1:12:39] then we say look what he did then he'll
[1:12:41] do
[1:12:42] now guess what then was now for him amen
[1:12:47] he's not in time that's right so here
[1:12:49] here it is laid out for you and I just
[1:12:52] said it the other day but says you have
[1:12:54] all the power you need just you don't
[1:12:55] have the faith that's it so how do you
[1:12:57] break time how do you break time the
[1:13:01] thing that your flesh is bound by how do
[1:13:03] you break it Faith that's right
[1:13:06] Revelation that's right faith is
[1:13:08] revelation that's right so the promises
[1:13:10] is there ready let just bear with me as
[1:13:12] I give this crude example there's a
[1:13:14] conveyor belt of time and here you are
[1:13:16] traveling upon it God's holding the
[1:13:19] promises right here you want to hear you
[1:13:22] want to hear you want to hear that's it
[1:13:23] and he's watching you you you got a
[1:13:25] little faith meter above your
[1:13:28] head goes up and down sometimes and you
[1:13:31] got it you it's right here whenever you
[1:13:33] want it and then along the way like I
[1:13:36] said crude example along the way your
[1:13:38] faith Bing God
[1:13:40] goes drops it right where you are amen
[1:13:45] crude example right but I'm a creature
[1:13:48] of time so I can't help it
[1:13:53] amen so God's thoughts
[1:13:56] literal Eternal thoughts that's right
[1:13:59] that's exactly right he says well the
[1:14:01] disciples said it well then it's
[1:14:03] impossible for any man to be saved any
[1:14:05] you know as God says well nothing is
[1:14:08] impossible with
[1:14:10] God you see if you look at the promises
[1:14:13] of
[1:14:14] God as
[1:14:17] time he says
[1:14:20] well I remember when God
[1:14:23] did and you know God
[1:14:26] will brother Bram said don't miss God in
[1:14:30] the present that's it that's it because
[1:14:32] no matter when you are I just said no
[1:14:35] matter when you are that's past that's
[1:14:36] history already that's right it's it's a
[1:14:39] Memory that's
[1:14:41] right a memory may be recalled in five
[1:14:44] minutes but that's not how God works and
[1:14:47] so if we if we bound our the promises of
[1:14:49] God then we're always talking about what
[1:14:52] he did and what he's going to do but vam
[1:14:55] said so much in his sixth grade
[1:14:58] education that is just absolutely
[1:15:02] profound he says oh they're always
[1:15:03] looking to what God did in the past what
[1:15:05] always going God's doing in the future
[1:15:06] and they miss him right now what is he
[1:15:08] talking about stop looking at time
[1:15:10] that's it God is Not time he created it
[1:15:14] he said in the beginning what was before
[1:15:17] Genesis
[1:15:19] 1:1 God that's it and God is the word we
[1:15:23] gave him
[1:15:27] he told Moses I am that I am amen he
[1:15:30] used our language to express his name to
[1:15:33] us call him Jesus
[1:15:36] Mary praise
[1:15:39] God what language will we speak over
[1:15:41] there we will speak God's language let's
[1:15:45] stop fighting about if it's Russian or
[1:15:46] if it's English or if it's Spanish
[1:15:49] whatever it is there's too many language
[1:15:50] it's God's language why would we want to
[1:15:53] use a okay praise the Lord it's God
[1:15:55] language because a language of time will
[1:15:57] never suffice for
[1:15:59] eternity every language you've ever
[1:16:01] heard spoken will not suffice because
[1:16:04] it's the language of time amen but God
[1:16:07] is outside of time Hebrews 11:6 but
[1:16:10] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:16:12] him why because faith is the vehicle for
[1:16:16] you to reach into eternity amen faith is
[1:16:20] the vehicle for you to reach into
[1:16:22] eternity says Oh Brother Bram yes you
[1:16:25] know I just can't accept faith and he
[1:16:26] says
[1:16:28] well this big argument you know he's
[1:16:31] done there's several different places in
[1:16:32] the message where he talks about you
[1:16:33] know discussions with people and it
[1:16:35] comes down to the thing well you got to
[1:16:36] have faith well I just can't accept that
[1:16:39] well there's no other way to contact
[1:16:42] eternity that's
[1:16:43] right I I think it was correct me if I'm
[1:16:46] wrong I think it was before the seals
[1:16:48] the angel of the Lord says you brother
[1:16:50] BR you need to be more
[1:16:52] sincere he's talking about the proph
[1:16:56] more sincere why there was too much
[1:17:00] white noise you know what white noise is
[1:17:03] turn the radio and you miss the
[1:17:06] channel white noise and you got to tune
[1:17:08] it then you get the voice brother bam
[1:17:11] had too much white noise he had too much
[1:17:13] time too much time blocking his channel
[1:17:17] to
[1:17:18] Eternity amen you see when you can get
[1:17:21] sincere with God where you realize you
[1:17:24] walk those doors God will speak to you
[1:17:27] not if he
[1:17:30] will so you sit on the Pew all the kids
[1:17:33] and this and that and if you could be
[1:17:36] more
[1:17:38] sincere the channel That Faith
[1:17:41] Channel yeah that's right is wide open
[1:17:45] amen right we say oh God won't speak
[1:17:48] that's because you won't shut
[1:17:52] up I'm not talking about your voice
[1:17:54] voice I'm talking about the white noise
[1:17:57] you won't tune your channel you won't
[1:18:00] tune your heart to God because you're
[1:18:03] filling it with the wrong thing amen
[1:18:06] anything outside of
[1:18:09] God anything outside of God too much
[1:18:12] will clog the channel anything anything
[1:18:15] of
[1:18:17] time too much amen will clog the channel
[1:18:21] cuz you need less time more eternity
[1:18:24] amen am but the more eternity you feed
[1:18:27] on the less time you have that is the
[1:18:31] mystery of
[1:18:32] Enoch that is the mystery of Enoch amen
[1:18:35] he had no time for
[1:18:38] time that's good amen for he that cometh
[1:18:41] to God must believe that he is that he
[1:18:45] is a rewarder of them that diligently
[1:18:47] seek Him amen sincerity just drives you
[1:18:51] to seek him more
[1:18:53] diligently cuz you realize
[1:18:56] wow this is
[1:18:58] real this is real that's
[1:19:04] it Samaran Church age thus thus the
[1:19:08] thoughts of God are Eternal they are
[1:19:11] real they are not simply like a okay I
[1:19:14] read this one already Yep they're not
[1:19:16] like something that God that has to come
[1:19:18] it's already
[1:19:19] there later on same chapter he says that
[1:19:23] means that we were right there with him
[1:19:25] that's in the mind and thoughts of God
[1:19:29] before the foundation of the
[1:19:33] world you're read
[1:19:35] ahead that gives an eternal quality to
[1:19:39] the elect ready you can't get away from
[1:19:43] that amen amen you can't get away with
[1:19:47] it like God can't stop being God
[1:19:50] Amen how can an eternal being stop being
[1:19:53] eternal that's right and how can an
[1:19:56] eternal
[1:19:58] quality be stuck in
[1:20:02] time this is the connection that's why
[1:20:04] he says well the elect will hear
[1:20:08] why because there's a literal part of
[1:20:11] you that is eternity that's it time
[1:20:14] can't hear eternity that's it time
[1:20:17] cannot hear eternity time is is
[1:20:19] manipulating or excuse me time is
[1:20:21] manipulated by eternity but time cannot
[1:20:23] hear eternity
[1:20:25] you know there's an example it's an old
[1:20:26] one but if about the second and 2D
[1:20:29] versus 3D right we're Liv a
[1:20:31] threedimensional world but and if you
[1:20:33] took and you shoved an apple through the
[1:20:36] second dimension they would just see the
[1:20:37] slices and if you pick them up and pull
[1:20:39] them into the third dimension they would
[1:20:41] have no idea what's going on so
[1:20:43] threedimensional can manipulate the
[1:20:45] second dimension right flat but they
[1:20:50] can't do anything to us they can't come
[1:20:52] up here so time can't do nothing to
[1:20:55] Eternity so they look at you and they
[1:20:57] say what what do you believe there's
[1:21:02] nothing they don't have that attribute
[1:21:05] that's it so they
[1:21:07] can't all they're all just they're just
[1:21:10] time and how do we and and that's why we
[1:21:14] write hell will cease to exist because
[1:21:16] it's
[1:21:18] time God created the
[1:21:20] angels He created Lucifer Lucifer fell
[1:21:24] time so then when God closes time well
[1:21:27] they'll go away with
[1:21:29] it because they're just creatures of
[1:21:31] time that's it oh man I don't think
[1:21:33] you're getting
[1:21:34] it that's the negative side the positive
[1:21:37] side is you have a literal quality of
[1:21:40] Eternity inside of you so when time
[1:21:42] folds guess what you keep going am
[1:21:45] because you can't be bound by
[1:21:49] time where do you find more victory in
[1:21:51] your life you tune to Eternity that's it
[1:21:54] amen where do you find more revelation
[1:21:57] of God you tune to
[1:21:59] Eternity time can't feed you time can't
[1:22:03] help
[1:22:05] you besides you don't have enough of it
[1:22:11] anyways praise God John
[1:22:13] 5:24 verily verily I say unto you he
[1:22:16] that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:22:18] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[1:22:21] and shall not come into condemnation but
[1:22:23] is passes from death death unto life how
[1:22:25] many of us have read this scripture and
[1:22:27] interpreted as we have to receive we
[1:22:30] have to bring in the word into us so
[1:22:32] therefore we live
[1:22:34] forever that might be an interpretation
[1:22:36] of it but he that heareth the word guess
[1:22:39] what only those with an eternal quality
[1:22:41] hear the
[1:22:42] word so they already have everlasting
[1:22:45] life he that heareth my word in other
[1:22:48] words in plain English if you can
[1:22:50] understand what I'm saying unto you and
[1:22:51] you can believe what I'm saying unto you
[1:22:53] then that means you have eternal inside
[1:22:55] of you and if you have eternity inside
[1:22:56] of you you've already passed from Death
[1:22:58] unto life before the foundation of the
[1:23:00] world you passed from Death unto life
[1:23:02] because you always were and always will
[1:23:05] be that is how a finite being can
[1:23:08] receive infinite
[1:23:11] thoughts because an eternal quality hlu
[1:23:14] lays inside of you there is no other way
[1:23:17] for eternity to come down into time and
[1:23:20] Lodge inside of your heart unless you
[1:23:23] are eternity that's EX EXA right praise
[1:23:25] be to God that's exactly right and we've
[1:23:28] already passed from Death unto life
[1:23:31] right both spiritually and
[1:23:34] naturally oh goodness amen Jesus Christ
[1:23:37] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:23:39] that's right and no man's better than
[1:23:41] his word if you make a promise you
[1:23:43] should always keep it or tell the reason
[1:23:45] why you can't let them know because a
[1:23:47] man's word is his bond that's right and
[1:23:50] God's word is his bond if God doesn't
[1:23:52] keep his word then it isn't the word of
[1:23:54] God that's right telling you slow down
[1:23:58] when you read the
[1:23:59] message but if he does keep his word
[1:24:02] then he's God in his word is he God in
[1:24:05] his word is he God in his
[1:24:08] word God is still in his
[1:24:11] word and when his word comes in you then
[1:24:15] your word becomes his word that's
[1:24:20] it praise God you see there was a time
[1:24:23] you didn't know you had Eternal
[1:24:25] attributes but then you heard his word
[1:24:27] for the first
[1:24:29] time why did it make a difference you
[1:24:31] know it doesn't matter the doctrine you
[1:24:34] heard you know we say well we heard
[1:24:36] serpent seed and the light turned on it
[1:24:38] wasn't serpent seed it was the truth
[1:24:42] amen that's it you heard the truth for
[1:24:45] the first time brother B tells a story
[1:24:47] about the eagle in the chicken yard what
[1:24:50] made the difference just the pitch in
[1:24:52] the Eagle's voice when she cried out
[1:24:55] no it was a voice he recognized and when
[1:24:58] he recognized that voice he remembered
[1:25:01] who he
[1:25:03] was it was Truth for the first time he
[1:25:07] heard truth that is why the Bible says
[1:25:11] know the truth and the truth shall set
[1:25:13] you free how does the truth set you free
[1:25:16] because it's God's word amen and if it's
[1:25:18] God's word then his word becomes your
[1:25:21] word amen and what is he he he is
[1:25:24] Victory that's it he is eternity amen he
[1:25:29] is Faith that's it he is healing that's
[1:25:33] right he is
[1:25:35] Deliverance somebody asked me to
[1:25:36] otherday says brother Chris I'm really
[1:25:38] trying to overcome bitterness in my life
[1:25:40] and I thought I had it under
[1:25:42] control I just don't know what to
[1:25:45] do I said you just need more
[1:25:49] word it's that
[1:25:51] easyy you don't need to go somewhere and
[1:25:54] find something that's right you just
[1:25:57] need more word because word can't dwell
[1:26:02] with
[1:26:03] nonword right right in other words truth
[1:26:08] cannot exist in false that's
[1:26:14] it because the two together is what
[1:26:17] still Al lie that's
[1:26:21] right so I said you just need more word
[1:26:23] and I said some sometimes speaking on
[1:26:25] bitterness sometimes you'll have that in
[1:26:27] your life and I don't even know if
[1:26:29] there's ever a way to completely rid
[1:26:31] yourself of that
[1:26:33] remembrance and that feeling because
[1:26:35] you're Are a Human Being I said but the
[1:26:38] way you know God's in control and has
[1:26:39] taken care of it is that Spirit comes
[1:26:42] and Whispers those memory of the past
[1:26:45] and that bitterness raises up and the
[1:26:47] Holy Spirit says not today that's right
[1:26:51] that's how you know that's it right
[1:26:54] a man that's been delivered from lust
[1:26:56] guess what there's always a woman
[1:26:59] there's always a temptation but when the
[1:27:01] spirit of God comes around and says no
[1:27:04] that's right that's when you know God's
[1:27:06] got under
[1:27:07] control the desire to lie someone has a
[1:27:11] has a problem with lying the desire is
[1:27:13] going to come you're going to feel that
[1:27:15] well you could just tell a lie here
[1:27:16] right now and every time before you did
[1:27:19] so what changed there's too much word
[1:27:22] that's it so the word say says Nope not
[1:27:25] today amen and without even thinking you
[1:27:28] avoid the Trap without even giving us
[1:27:32] the flesh says no no no no and all of a
[1:27:34] sudden you just go the other way amen
[1:27:36] and you wonder how did that
[1:27:38] happen how did that happen the word said
[1:27:41] no not today amen if you go if you get
[1:27:44] anything from tonight just remember this
[1:27:46] one line the word said no not
[1:27:51] today so God's word is his bond if he
[1:27:53] doesn't if God doesn't keep his word
[1:27:55] okay when his word comes in you then
[1:27:58] your word becomes his word in other
[1:28:00] words you have no word of your own
[1:28:02] that's it you you he is your logos
[1:28:05] that's it that's it you know you are
[1:28:08] known by your words amen your word
[1:28:11] that's how we know
[1:28:13] you you know somebody who doesn't ever
[1:28:15] say anything you've never had a chance
[1:28:16] to talk to you don't know them that's
[1:28:18] right you can judge them because you
[1:28:19] know the world today we have cultures
[1:28:22] you might be able to tell which culture
[1:28:23] they're from which fad they're a part of
[1:28:26] depending on what they wear whether they
[1:28:27] have a Stanley or whether they have a a
[1:28:31] pair of Birkin stock sandals on right
[1:28:33] but until they talk you don't know
[1:28:36] them so I know Brother David because of
[1:28:38] the fellowship that we've had and you
[1:28:40] can't Fellowship without word that's
[1:28:42] right so you're known by Your Word so
[1:28:45] you say
[1:28:46] man how do they know I was a Christian
[1:28:49] because you don't have your own word you
[1:28:51] have
[1:28:52] logos his word your word becomes his
[1:28:55] word amen so now what word are you known
[1:28:58] by you're not known by Paul haly you're
[1:29:02] known by Jesus Christ that's right
[1:29:04] because your word became his word that's
[1:29:07] right I'm not knowing I Chris take no
[1:29:10] I'm known as Jesus Christ that's right
[1:29:12] well they call me Chris because that's
[1:29:13] what the flesh is named but my spirit
[1:29:16] man is Mrs Jesus
[1:29:18] Christ his word becomes your word
[1:29:22] becomes his word
[1:29:25] that's why if you
[1:29:27] speak
[1:29:29] amen amen
[1:29:33] it hopefully you can sleep tonight he
[1:29:36] don't just laying B thinking wow wow wow
[1:29:38] wow because I probably will that's what
[1:29:40] brings it to pass whatever you've asked
[1:29:43] just as simple as that God is a Creator
[1:29:45] God created everything all good things
[1:29:48] come from God and wrong things evil
[1:29:50] things is the right thing
[1:29:52] perverted you know he he he's talking it
[1:29:55] might even be in this message I can't
[1:29:56] remember but he's talking about how how
[1:29:58] the devil can't create he says that the
[1:30:00] devil can't create he says if I cut my
[1:30:03] hand and I go to the doctor they can sew
[1:30:05] me up they can put the whatever it is on
[1:30:08] there to to and they say well you know
[1:30:09] brother's talking about if he's talking
[1:30:11] to somebody else they say well yeah the
[1:30:12] doctors healed you and he says he says
[1:30:14] no he says God healed me excuse me the
[1:30:18] medicine
[1:30:19] assisted and he just lays it out so
[1:30:21] beautifully now I wish I would have put
[1:30:22] the quote in here but he says if if I
[1:30:24] was if I cut myself and then I died all
[1:30:27] the medicine in the world can patch that
[1:30:30] up and it will never
[1:30:32] heal he says so the devil can't
[1:30:37] create so no matter what happens to you
[1:30:41] in your life spiritually speaking
[1:30:44] there's a
[1:30:47] cut well the healing attribute is
[1:30:51] already inside of you amen right amen
[1:30:54] you're alive in Christ right so you cut
[1:30:56] yourself now you'll put a band on it
[1:30:57] it'll heal itself right up because there
[1:31:01] is a life that's what he says he says
[1:31:04] the person said well yes of course you
[1:31:06] won't ever heal while you're dead
[1:31:07] because there's no life and he says now
[1:31:09] you've got the main
[1:31:10] line that's right he said exactly it's
[1:31:14] the life the life so what what is it
[1:31:16] that that heals oh goodness the world's
[1:31:18] going to cut you your brother's going to
[1:31:21] cut you your sister's going to cut you
[1:31:24] but when you already have that life
[1:31:26] inside of you that's right that's it
[1:31:28] it's going to heal it that's right it's
[1:31:30] going to heal it take the knocks and the
[1:31:32] drags of the people but God
[1:31:35] comes because it's the life so you say
[1:31:38] well that's good for for injuries
[1:31:40] spiritual injuries natural injuries yes
[1:31:42] but all that does is prove there's a
[1:31:45] life amen right the life is there
[1:31:49] brother talks about the hemoglobin
[1:31:51] hemoglobin is the life is the life in
[1:31:53] the blood that's right so it's not just
[1:31:54] the blood there's a lot of blood but is
[1:31:57] the life in the blood if the life's in
[1:32:00] the blood then guess what so you've got
[1:32:04] Christ in the blood you've got that
[1:32:07] Eternal attribute in the
[1:32:09] blood you have a connection to
[1:32:12] Eternity and your word is replaced with
[1:32:16] logos amen I feel like I could keep
[1:32:18] going but that's that's all we have for
[1:32:22] tonight Saints
[1:32:25] when you really stop and you think about
[1:32:27] how much how much we can find God to
[1:32:33] time you you you really stop and and and
[1:32:36] say is you know what time is time is
[1:32:39] doubt okay that's right it's doubt
[1:32:44] because the opposite of time is eternity
[1:32:46] amen and that's Revelation that is faith
[1:32:48] that is God so time is just there to
[1:32:51] make you doubt says well you know oh
[1:32:54] they passed away oh they're still sick
[1:32:56] our sister Elizabeth still sick
[1:32:58] what God's outside of
[1:33:01] time we look at it say well the
[1:33:03] progression of time you know she's just
[1:33:05] you know going through it and going
[1:33:07] through it but God is not bound by time
[1:33:11] and if God isn't Bound by time his word
[1:33:13] isn't Bound by time his promises aren't
[1:33:14] Bound by
[1:33:16] time so what do you have need of you
[1:33:18] have need of something and you're not
[1:33:20] there yet guess what he's waiting for
[1:33:22] you amen he's waiting for you but he's
[1:33:26] patient because he told the the
[1:33:28] disciples on the ship oh ye of little
[1:33:30] faith when
[1:33:32] stop that's how you do
[1:33:35] it not in an arrogant way he says
[1:33:39] children that's how you do
[1:33:41] it you see what happened was you didn't
[1:33:43] have the faith oh you have the power but
[1:33:45] you didn't have the
[1:33:46] faith oh praise God Amen you know
[1:33:49] they've even proven that time is
[1:33:51] relative right Einstein's theory relativ
[1:33:54] relativity I have watched and I have
[1:33:56] studied that and I do not know it well
[1:33:58] enough to try to explain it except for
[1:34:00] the fact that if you can speed up fast
[1:34:03] enough time
[1:34:05] pauses tell me God ain't in
[1:34:09] that where is he how is it look you see
[1:34:12] God himself created
[1:34:13] everything and Lord can help me say this
[1:34:16] in closing so when you Rapture it's not
[1:34:18] going to be
[1:34:20] magic it's going to be God saying all
[1:34:23] right now it's time to show you what's
[1:34:24] been laying there all this time and he
[1:34:27] pulls he grabs light by the tail he
[1:34:30] pulls it through time and there you go
[1:34:33] amen it's not going to be magic same
[1:34:36] thing when he heals you when he delivers
[1:34:38] you when he sets you free you know I was
[1:34:39] reading I I said I was closing I was
[1:34:41] reading uh I'm reading again this book
[1:34:43] that that sister April shared with us
[1:34:45] about a year ago called God's Smuggler
[1:34:47] and I'm reading it again and and and the
[1:34:49] man had a crippled ankle and and here
[1:34:51] God's calling him to the mission field
[1:34:52] and he can't even walk and says how am I
[1:34:54] going to go if I can't even walk a city
[1:34:56] block and so he's sitting on the the
[1:34:58] poers as they call him over there the
[1:34:59] Netherlands and and he's sitting there
[1:35:01] saying God what is it that I haven't
[1:35:03] haven't given it to you what what what
[1:35:04] am I holding on to that just I can't
[1:35:06] seem to to break free of all of the
[1:35:09] cares of everything and it just struck
[1:35:11] him I've always said yes
[1:35:14] but yes but my ankle yes but he said
[1:35:20] Lord right here right now I'm going to
[1:35:24] say yes to you and whatever it is
[1:35:27] however it is you want to do it it'll be
[1:35:29] yes so he says I say yes he got up and
[1:35:33] his leg went and he went oh no and he
[1:35:37] touched it and he walked for the first
[1:35:39] time since the accident painfree amen
[1:35:42] God completely healed him what was
[1:35:45] it total surrender to the word amen so
[1:35:50] what is it what what is your crippled
[1:35:52] ankle what is your ankle in your
[1:35:54] spiritual life you just keep saying yes
[1:35:57] but yes but when I'm a better Christian
[1:36:00] yes but when I can do this yes but all
[1:36:04] God is asking you to do is just say yes
[1:36:07] every time just say yesen that's right
[1:36:11] just say yes amen let's bow our
[1:36:15] heads Heavenly Father Lord
[1:36:18] Jesus Lord I just pray that you would
[1:36:21] just take everything that was said and
[1:36:23] and father it would just be each
[1:36:27] individual here tonight has a certain
[1:36:29] need and father by your grace you filter
[1:36:32] the word spoken to that need and so each
[1:36:35] one may be heard it a little bit
[1:36:37] different but because it was your word
[1:36:39] it was direct to their need I pray now
[1:36:42] father they would take it they would
[1:36:43] hold on to it father further study
[1:36:46] further devotion is needed Lord as
[1:36:48] always with the preaching of the word
[1:36:50] there's more to see more to chew on more
[1:36:52] to read I pray Lord that each one would
[1:36:54] take home father and just put to study
[1:36:57] what has been said tonight Lord that
[1:36:59] father as they study not in may may seem
[1:37:02] to be in an intellectual way but it's
[1:37:05] the transferring of your word into our
[1:37:08] hearts because we hold the key to
[1:37:12] Eternity and that's only because you
[1:37:15] said so we didn't we didn't we weren't
[1:37:18] even alive enough we weren't alive to
[1:37:20] even know to say yes we'll be Eternal
[1:37:23] you who chose
[1:37:24] us we didn't even have an opportunity to
[1:37:27] turn you down thank you God we didn't
[1:37:32] even have an opportunity to say yes or
[1:37:33] no we always were a part of
[1:37:36] you the victory therefore as we heard it
[1:37:40] said last weekend we are fighting from
[1:37:43] Victory because we are Victory because
[1:37:47] we are a part of
[1:37:50] you anything that was said of my own
[1:37:52] opinion my own thoughts may you move
[1:37:55] that aside father we only want you your
[1:37:58] word inside of us so that our word
[1:38:02] becomes your
[1:38:04] word so that the logos would just take
[1:38:08] over everything Lord we said a few
[1:38:10] things tonight on
[1:38:12] bitterness lying different things Lord
[1:38:15] if you've hid an n in someone may you
[1:38:18] give them the strength to just take on
[1:38:21] word and more word give us all there's
[1:38:23] all we all have something Lord we all
[1:38:25] have a little thing here well we all
[1:38:28] have a thing there is no size in your
[1:38:30] eyes may you just help us to overcome
[1:38:33] help us to take in the more of that word
[1:38:36] father we can climb up the ladder father
[1:38:38] because our goal is perfect love our
[1:38:40] goal is
[1:38:41] perfection and if we can reach that
[1:38:43] point father
[1:38:45] you we will separate from time
[1:38:50] forever thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's
[1:38:52] name we pray
[1:38:55] amen you know one little closing comment
[1:38:59] we all we talk about faith so much but
[1:39:02] do you realize faith is the first rung
[1:39:05] on the ladder that's
[1:39:07] right that's
[1:39:11] right amen listening this I'll say yes
