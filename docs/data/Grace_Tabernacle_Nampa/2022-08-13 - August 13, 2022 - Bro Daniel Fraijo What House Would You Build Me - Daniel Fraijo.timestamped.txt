[34:29] god bless you all today
[34:32] it's a privilege and honor to be back
[34:34] here again
[34:36] and uh i want to thank brother paul for
[34:39] inviting me once again
[34:42] a big risk on his part thank you brother
[34:44] paul
[34:46] and uh good to see brother david
[34:48] and all the saints
[34:50] karen rewind reminded me i think it was
[34:52] around 2019 the last time we came
[34:56] time goes quickly
[34:57] but we're thankful to
[34:59] to god that his time has gone quickly
[35:03] his word has been moving quickly in our
[35:05] hearts also
[35:07] and as the world becomes uh
[35:10] falling apart at the seams
[35:13] on a global scale then we realized just
[35:15] the hour we're living in
[35:18] that it's uh it's an 11th hour
[35:21] it's and it's just minutes till midnight
[35:24] it's just minutes it's just seconds
[35:26] perhaps until midnight
[35:28] and god has been preparing a bride
[35:30] that's why he sent us his word
[35:33] that's why his holy spirit came down
[35:35] that's why he's been filling our vessels
[35:38] with oil
[35:39] that's why he restored to us the truth
[35:41] of three precious steps of grace
[35:44] justification by faith
[35:47] sanctification by the spirit
[35:49] the baptism of the holy ghost why it's a
[35:52] friendship that's been restored with the
[35:54] father like adam had in the beginning
[35:57] and then
[35:58] he gave us refilling after refilling
[36:02] it's a it's a daily promise the
[36:04] refilling of his holy spirit
[36:07] and the only thing that hinders us from
[36:10] having a refilling every day
[36:12] is
[36:13] if we're not in tune to the spirit
[36:16] if if we don't wake up every morning in
[36:19] our hearts praying saying lord
[36:22] thy will be done
[36:24] and looking and to see and recognize
[36:28] that the things that we would suffer
[36:29] here for a purpose
[36:32] and the purpose is to bring us to the
[36:33] statue of a perfect man
[36:35] the man jesus christ
[36:38] it's a great plan it unfolds into
[36:40] adoption
[36:41] and it places us right back again
[36:44] where adam fell from
[36:46] so where adam fell from is where god in
[36:49] this last day has brought us to amen
[36:52] we're at that level by his amazing grace
[36:55] as we stand to our feet this evening
[37:02] we'd like to
[37:04] speak on a little subject and
[37:07] a title i'm sure you'll find very
[37:09] familiar
[37:10] and it's i'm entitling it what house
[37:13] will you build me
[37:16] and as a subject
[37:18] to get to this title
[37:20] the subject would be the foolish version
[37:23] friend or foe
[37:26] and it's it's been through the ages it's
[37:29] turned into a controversial
[37:32] doctrine of sorts
[37:33] when really the parable was had a
[37:36] different design different intent in the
[37:38] mind of god altogether
[37:40] let's read in romans chapter one
[37:43] if you'll turn with me
[37:46] romans 1 and verse 14.
[37:49] the apostle paul here speaking
[37:52] and he says this
[37:53] i am debtor both to the greeks
[37:56] and to the barbarians
[37:58] both to the wise
[38:00] and to the unwise
[38:03] so so as much as is in me
[38:06] as in me is
[38:08] i am ready to preach the gospel to you
[38:11] that i roam
[38:12] also it is with our heads heavenly
[38:15] father we thank you
[38:17] lord jesus and you the lamb of god are
[38:20] are the revealer of the word
[38:22] and lord what we might share here
[38:25] this evening
[38:26] and even our lack of ability perhaps to
[38:29] make it clear
[38:31] yeah you're not hindered
[38:33] lord for you can take the word direct to
[38:35] the hearts of your children and open the
[38:37] eyes of their understanding in just a
[38:40] moment for this we thank you that you're
[38:42] in control in jesus name amen you may be
[38:46] seated
[38:51] as we approach this subject here and
[38:54] in envisions and
[38:56] the prophetic word unfolding the a great
[38:59] plan of redemption
[39:01] then in these visions every symbol that
[39:03] is mentioned it's mentioned for uh
[39:06] divine purpose
[39:08] then there's also parables because the
[39:09] word of god is written in allegories and
[39:12] in metaphors and parables and
[39:14] convictions and symbols
[39:16] not just the last book of the bible but
[39:18] from genesis to revelation for god said
[39:21] it it pleased him he said father i thank
[39:24] you that you have hidden these things
[39:26] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[39:28] would really reveal that unto babes such
[39:30] as would learn
[39:32] so
[39:32] in a parable there are things also that
[39:34] that mentioned that
[39:36] are only there to you might say feel or
[39:38] dramatize the story even to obscure the
[39:42] the moral or spiritual lesson
[39:44] and many details in a parable are placed
[39:47] to actually hide the meaning
[39:50] the meaning that can only be seen by a
[39:53] personal revelation
[39:56] for instance
[39:57] revelations 6 1
[40:00] it reads
[40:01] and i saw when the lamb
[40:03] opened one of the seals
[40:05] and i heard as it were the noise of
[40:07] thunder
[40:08] one of the four beasts saying
[40:11] come and see
[40:13] every one of those words is an english
[40:16] word
[40:17] every one of them
[40:18] you understood
[40:21] individually you could define that you
[40:24] okay a lamb i know what a lamb is
[40:26] open one of the seals all right i think
[40:28] i know what a seal is
[40:31] i heard it was the noise of a thunder
[40:33] i've heard thunder before
[40:35] and one of the four beasts saying come
[40:37] and see
[40:38] i know what beast are beast of the field
[40:42] and yet
[40:44] it's none of those things
[40:46] because when you read it by revelation
[40:49] you realize that this clam wasn't a
[40:51] natural lamb
[40:52] but it was jesus christ
[40:55] and when he says can he open one of the
[40:57] seals
[40:59] you realize that the opening of the seal
[41:02] represents a book
[41:04] that the seal is the the smallest part
[41:08] and the most insignificant part
[41:11] because the seal was a little spot of
[41:13] clay
[41:14] a little spot of wax
[41:16] and it held
[41:20] a scroll
[41:21] held it shut
[41:23] and yet god didn't speak to you and say
[41:25] watch the scroll
[41:27] he says
[41:28] he said and the lamb opened one of the
[41:30] seals though the holy spirit makes
[41:32] mention of the most insignificant thing
[41:35] as if to purposely try to take your eyes
[41:38] off
[41:39] what really mattered
[41:41] so that he could reveal it to you later
[41:43] so he could hide it from the eyes of the
[41:45] wise and prune it wasn't the seal
[41:49] but it was the opening of it because the
[41:52] opening of it held a scroll shut and
[41:54] when you open the scroll held the
[41:56] message a message that was directly
[41:58] intended for you and i yeah
[42:01] so we saw jesus christ when he opened up
[42:04] a book of redemption
[42:05] and then he says and i heard is that
[42:07] we're the noise
[42:08] of thunder
[42:10] and the prophet said
[42:12] we all know what a thunder is
[42:17] he says a thunder
[42:19] is the voice of god
[42:20] when a seal is open
[42:23] so now god is emphasizing for the second
[42:26] time
[42:27] it's open
[42:28] it's been loose because then i saw when
[42:30] jesus christ
[42:32] opened the book
[42:34] and i can i and i heard the voice of
[42:36] this opening
[42:38] and one of the four beasts
[42:40] the lion
[42:42] where he was the first
[42:45] because one prophecy has detailed the
[42:47] next yes
[42:50] so you can't to take just one
[42:53] you're lacking so much
[42:55] of what god's wanting to tell you but
[42:57] when you start bringing them together as
[42:59] the prophet says dovetailing them
[43:02] so revelations 4 spoke to us
[43:04] the lineup of the beast
[43:06] which was the first and which was the
[43:08] last
[43:09] the
[43:10] the lion the ox the man the eagle so
[43:13] realize here this is the opening of this
[43:16] first seal
[43:17] and this is the first beast
[43:19] so the lamb in this
[43:21] in this book of symbols in revelation 6
[43:24] 1
[43:25] was jesus christ
[43:28] and the lion can and one of the four
[43:30] beasts was a lion
[43:32] and the lion was jesus christ
[43:34] so it wasn't talking about two different
[43:36] people
[43:37] it was talking about a ministerial
[43:39] change
[43:40] but the lamb was the one that would be
[43:43] opening this book
[43:45] because the lamb ministry was the oldest
[43:48] how could i say the most ancient of
[43:50] ministries
[43:52] revelations 13 and 8 said he was the
[43:55] lamb slain
[43:57] at the foundation of the world
[44:00] and when you go back to genesis to find
[44:01] where that took place the bible says
[44:03] that god made skins
[44:07] for adam and eve
[44:08] to dress them
[44:10] it never said he killed a natural lamb
[44:13] but yet
[44:14] it was a symbol that he had slew a lamb
[44:17] but the lamb that was slain was the lamb
[44:19] of god in the mind of god he slew it and
[44:22] those skins were representing what he
[44:24] was covering his children with
[44:28] he wasn't in the beginning covering with
[44:30] natural skins they were spoken word
[44:32] covering of what the blood of jesus
[44:34] christ would do for all of us for ages
[44:36] to come he did it once and for all in
[44:39] genesis and the same covering we have
[44:42] today
[44:43] this is god
[44:45] how he writes this book
[44:49] and as we get into the flow of visions
[44:51] and parables
[44:53] it's to also understand the style
[44:56] of the author of this book called the
[44:58] bible
[44:59] in matthew 13
[45:02] and verse 34
[45:04] matthew
[45:06] matthew the book of matthew and the
[45:08] gospels the book of john the book of
[45:11] luke mark
[45:12] these are eyewitnesses
[45:14] these are eyewitnesses accounts
[45:18] of what took place
[45:20] it's not a story
[45:23] they were witnesses
[45:25] and they're sharing with us
[45:27] what they saw
[45:29] what they heard
[45:31] and what they even felt with their hands
[45:33] and matthew 13 34 says
[45:36] all these things spake jesus unto the
[45:38] multitude and parables
[45:40] and without a parable
[45:42] spoken not unto them
[45:45] that it might be fulfilled
[45:47] which was spoken by the prophet saying i
[45:49] will open my mouth in parables
[45:52] i will utter things which have been kept
[45:54] secret from the foundation of the world
[45:56] amen
[45:58] now
[45:59] we've established something
[46:01] the ministry and style of of jesus
[46:04] christ
[46:06] how he would speak
[46:07] he said all these beings spake jesus
[46:09] into the multitude in parables
[46:12] and without a parable spoke he
[46:15] not unto them
[46:16] so everything he would say
[46:18] so you got a bible with red letter when
[46:21] you read it
[46:22] a scripture
[46:24] first thing thought
[46:25] tell yourself this is a parable
[46:30] this is deeper than just the words that
[46:32] i can individually take
[46:34] and apply a dictionary to
[46:37] this is a parable
[46:38] he said the reason why that it might be
[46:41] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[46:43] prophet
[46:44] saying i'll open my mouth in parables
[46:46] i'll utter things which have been kept
[46:48] secret
[46:49] since the foundation of the world
[46:51] jesus was going to come and speak in
[46:53] parables things he was going to say that
[46:56] he had only said to adam that adam had
[46:58] been the only man that had ever heard
[47:00] these words
[47:03] now he was going to repeat him again
[47:06] through the second adam
[47:08] he was going to come and speak to us
[47:10] and bring us a plan of adoption
[47:12] bring us a plan to teach us how to
[47:14] handle the spoken word
[47:19] he was going to bring us a plan
[47:21] that was going to change us that was
[47:24] going to mold us
[47:26] mold our character mold the way we think
[47:28] mold the way we walk mold the way we
[47:30] talked that's right
[47:32] we were to be once again
[47:34] as the first adam was the sun going
[47:37] through a process of adoption
[47:40] we're to be that people
[47:42] we are standing today by the grace of
[47:44] god where adam stood the first adam
[47:49] by the revealed word
[47:51] god is molding us
[47:53] into his character
[47:59] what about
[48:01] as we speak on parables and the style of
[48:03] how jesus spoke to the people and
[48:06] without a parable he didn't speak
[48:08] but in parables he spoke to us things
[48:11] that had been hidden since the
[48:12] foundation of the world
[48:14] what about the great commission to the
[48:16] church
[48:18] parable or literal
[48:20] we just read what the style of his
[48:22] ministry would be
[48:23] and his ministry would be
[48:25] thus saith the lord
[48:27] always in parables
[48:30] matthew 28 18
[48:31] scripture we all know very well
[48:35] it's jesus
[48:36] his death burial and resurrection he's
[48:39] about to ascend on high and he gives the
[48:41] church a great commission
[48:43] and it said and jesus came and spake
[48:46] unto him saying
[48:47] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[48:50] in earth
[48:52] he says
[48:53] go ye therefore
[48:54] and teach all nations
[48:56] baptizing them in the name of the father
[49:00] and of the son
[49:01] and of the holy ghost
[49:03] and we've defended our stand on baptism
[49:06] in the name of the lord jesus christ by
[49:08] saying folks don't you understand those
[49:11] are titles
[49:14] and they are
[49:17] but it's more than that
[49:19] it's a parable
[49:23] god spoke in a parable
[49:25] and he hid it from the eyes of the wise
[49:27] and prudent
[49:31] but in acts 2 verse 36 to 38
[49:34] is the revelation of the parable
[49:37] and adds more detail to the parable to
[49:39] the great commission to the church it
[49:42] becomes more clear
[49:43] another word we use for clarity is
[49:46] revelation
[49:48] acts 2 36
[49:50] peter speaking
[49:52] he says therefore
[49:53] let all the house of israel know
[49:55] assuredly that god hath made the same
[49:57] jesus
[49:58] whom he have crucified
[50:00] both lord and christ
[50:02] so standing in the midst of whom peter
[50:05] was preaching to on the day of pentecost
[50:08] a large group maybe thousands had come
[50:10] around watching
[50:12] this phenomena this modern event take
[50:14] place
[50:15] where 120 had come out of an upper room
[50:17] speaking in tongues and the glory of god
[50:20] was on their faces
[50:21] and everything that they were speaking
[50:23] all were understanding and they were
[50:26] speaking of the great things of god
[50:28] of what was happening there
[50:31] so here
[50:32] peter's
[50:34] he says therefore let all the house of
[50:36] israel know assuredly
[50:38] that god had made that same jesus
[50:41] whom ye have crucified
[50:43] both lord and christ the holy spirit
[50:45] descent discerned
[50:47] amongst the group of people
[50:50] that were standing there
[50:51] where those who had cried crucify him on
[50:54] that day
[50:56] they were right there
[51:00] then
[51:01] then
[51:02] peter says now when they heard this
[51:05] they were pricked in their hearts
[51:08] because they knew they were part of the
[51:09] group
[51:10] that were screaming crucify him
[51:13] that's why they were pricked in their
[51:15] hearts when they heard what peter said
[51:17] when they heard the holy spirit discern
[51:18] their hearts you were there you were the
[51:21] you shouted crucify him
[51:26] the bible says they were pricked in
[51:27] their hearts
[51:28] and said unto peter
[51:30] and to the rest of the apostles
[51:33] men and brethren
[51:35] what do we do now
[51:39] now what do i do
[51:43] peter said
[51:46] unto them
[51:47] repent and be baptized
[51:49] every one of you in the name of jesus
[51:51] christ
[51:52] for the remission of sins
[51:55] and you shall receive
[51:56] the gift
[51:58] of the holy ghost
[51:59] the revelation of the parable
[52:02] adding more detail not only go eat count
[52:05] into the world and teach them to be
[52:07] baptized in the name of the father and
[52:08] the son of the host but tell them
[52:10] when they do it in that name
[52:12] add another detail
[52:14] tell them that it's going to give you a
[52:15] holy ghost baptism tell them it's going
[52:18] to give them a fire baptism tell them
[52:20] it's going to change the way you think
[52:21] and live you'll never be the same
[52:25] the parable
[52:27] revealed
[52:29] more than just
[52:31] those are titles
[52:32] it was a parable
[52:36] now you know why everyone won't catch it
[52:38] because it won't be revealed to all
[52:41] it because it'll take a revelation to
[52:43] unfold these parables to us it'll take
[52:45] the holy spirit it'll take you and i in
[52:47] a relationship with the father once
[52:50] again
[52:53] paul said
[52:54] i'm adapter both to the greeks
[52:57] and to the barbarians
[52:59] both to the wise
[53:02] and to the unwise
[53:04] so as much as in me
[53:06] i'm ready to preach the gospel to you at
[53:08] rome also
[53:10] and to the laity
[53:12] i asked with your present understanding
[53:16] this foolish virgin
[53:18] is she your friend
[53:20] or is she your fault
[53:24] now the parable
[53:26] of matthew 25.
[53:29] something is hidden
[53:31] within this parable
[53:34] to the words that are all english words
[53:37] all words you've heard
[53:39] all words to whom in your mind you you
[53:42] may already know the definition to them
[53:44] individually
[53:45] but when god puts them all together
[53:49] then the definition of these words
[53:51] cannot be found in a dictionary
[53:54] it's got to be revealed to you
[53:57] matthew 25 1 then shall the kingdom of
[54:00] heaven be likened unto ten virgins
[54:03] which took their lamps and went forth to
[54:05] meet the bridegroom
[54:08] and five of them were wise and five were
[54:11] foolish
[54:13] they that were foolish took their lamps
[54:16] and took no oil
[54:18] with them
[54:19] no oil none
[54:23] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[54:25] with their lamps
[54:27] while the bridegroom carried
[54:28] they all slumbered
[54:31] and they slept
[54:35] let me start with a statement here
[54:39] now the 10 virgins
[54:42] are not the church of laodicea
[54:45] but they're believers
[54:47] even believers of all denominations and
[54:49] man-made systems
[54:51] that have heard the call
[54:53] come out of her my people
[54:56] this is
[54:57] the 11th hour we're living in
[54:59] this is minutes before the midnight hour
[55:02] a prophet came on the scene
[55:05] and he said remember world war one
[55:09] do you recall when it ended and how
[55:11] on the eleventh day
[55:13] on the eleventh hour
[55:14] a prophetic ministry declaring to us
[55:17] 1914 1919 the 11th hour had begun
[55:22] okay that means 60 minutes that means 60
[55:26] prophetic minutes until a rapture
[55:29] 60 prophetic minutes till matthew 25 is
[55:33] history
[55:34] and no longer prophecy
[55:37] the 10 virgins
[55:39] these
[55:42] turn with me in revelations 3 and 20.
[55:47] it reads this behold i stand at the door
[55:51] and knock
[55:52] if any man hear my voice and open the
[55:55] door
[55:56] i will come to him and will sup with him
[55:59] and he with me
[56:00] the ten virgins
[56:06] is the woman of revelations 12
[56:08] and the remnant of the foolish woman's
[56:11] can the remnant of the woman seed both
[56:13] wise and foolish here in revelations 3
[56:16] and 20
[56:17] this is
[56:18] the 11th hour
[56:22] remember revelations 3
[56:24] 14-19 was the laodicean age
[56:28] the time of the seventh angel
[56:31] the time of a worldwide ministry
[56:33] but verse 20
[56:35] is a voice change
[56:38] and paul spoke to us of it
[56:40] he spoke to us that there would be the
[56:42] shout
[56:44] the voice of the archangel and the trump
[56:46] of god
[56:48] and the voice change taking place in
[56:50] revelations 3 and 20
[56:52] is the voice of the archangel it's the
[56:54] voice of the resurrection
[56:56] it's the voice of god between a prophet
[56:58] off the scene
[57:01] amen
[57:02] god is still on the scene
[57:05] so these ten virgins is the woman
[57:08] of revelations 12
[57:10] and the remnant of a woman's seed
[57:13] and if you'll turn with me to
[57:14] revelations 12 and verse 12.
[57:18] it reads like this
[57:20] therefore rejoice see heavens
[57:22] and ye that dwell on them
[57:24] woe to the inhabiters of the earth and
[57:27] of the sea
[57:28] for the devil has come down come to you
[57:30] having great wrath because he knoweth
[57:33] that he hath
[57:34] but a short time
[57:36] it's just seconds till midnight
[57:40] a great tribulation the clock is about
[57:43] to start ticking
[57:44] for three and a half years
[57:47] verse 13 says and when the dragon saw
[57:50] that he was cast unto the earth he
[57:53] persecuted the woman which brought forth
[57:56] the man-child the wise virgin
[58:01] and to the woman forgiven two wings of a
[58:04] great eagle
[58:05] this wise virgin
[58:07] that she might fly into the wilderness
[58:09] into a place where she is nourished for
[58:11] a time and times and a half time from
[58:14] the face of the serpent
[58:16] verse 14 a rapture has taken place a
[58:19] bride has been taken she's had a body
[58:22] change
[58:23] she's at the wedding supper of the lamb
[58:25] for three and a half years now while the
[58:26] world is in a great tribulation
[58:30] verse 15
[58:32] and the serpent cast out his mouth
[58:35] water as a flood
[58:37] after the woman
[58:42] what came out of his mouth
[58:45] this flood
[58:46] was a flood of the seed of the serpent
[58:50] was the flood of the dictators and
[58:52] rulers of the nations
[58:56] but the bible says
[58:59] and the serpent cast out of his mouth
[59:02] water as a flood after the woman that he
[59:04] might cause her to be carried away
[59:06] of the flood
[59:08] of this anti-christ
[59:10] world
[59:11] of this immoral and filthy generation
[59:16] verse 16 says and the earth
[59:18] helped the woman
[59:22] and the earth opened her mouth and
[59:24] swallowed up the flood
[59:26] and in the 11th hour
[59:28] tsunami's
[59:30] earthquakes hurricanes
[59:36] pandemics
[59:38] and people on the face of the earth
[59:40] dying by the millions
[59:44] the
[59:44] earth was swallowing up the flood
[59:49] take the pressure off the bride of
[59:51] christ
[59:52] give her a chance
[59:54] to get her vessel full of oil
[59:59] verse 17
[1:00:01] and the dragon was wrath with the woman
[1:00:05] the wise version
[1:00:08] comma
[1:00:10] and went to make war with the remnant of
[1:00:12] her seed
[1:00:15] what happened
[1:00:17] what happened in the comic
[1:00:19] is the
[1:00:20] is is the woman with whom the dragon was
[1:00:23] wrath that would bring forth the christ
[1:00:26] child
[1:00:28] she was raptured
[1:00:30] and the dragon was wrath with a woman
[1:00:33] you would think the next thing would be
[1:00:36] he would say and because he was roughed
[1:00:38] he's chasing it to the ends of the earth
[1:00:43] and the dragon was wrath with the woman
[1:00:46] karma
[1:00:47] the woman's god
[1:00:50] she's been quickened she's been changed
[1:00:54] from an earthly body
[1:00:57] to a to a celestial body
[1:01:00] and the dragon was wrath with the woman
[1:01:03] comet
[1:01:04] and she's gone
[1:01:06] he can't find her he don't know where
[1:01:08] she went so what does he do so he now
[1:01:10] goes and he goes to make war with the
[1:01:12] remnant of her seed the foolish
[1:01:15] which keep the commandments of god
[1:01:18] and have the testimony
[1:01:20] of jesus christ
[1:01:23] this book the bible
[1:01:25] it it doesn't read like any other book
[1:01:28] you'll ever read
[1:01:30] it takes revelation
[1:01:32] it takes prayer
[1:01:35] it
[1:01:36] takes knock
[1:01:39] it shall be opened unto you
[1:01:41] seek
[1:01:42] you shall find
[1:01:43] ask he will give you the understanding
[1:01:46] he will give you the revelation
[1:01:54] matthew 25 and verse 5
[1:01:57] it said while the bridegroom tarried
[1:02:01] they all slumbered
[1:02:02] and slept
[1:02:06] i just want to say it has
[1:02:08] nothing to do with someone coming tired
[1:02:10] to church and you're kind of dozing off
[1:02:12] a little bit
[1:02:14] no i'm not going there
[1:02:16] we're not an evangelist maybe if you're
[1:02:18] an evangelist you might but that's not
[1:02:20] what the bible's speaking of here
[1:02:22] brother brahman says in the message of
[1:02:23] the ten virgins paragraph 80. he says
[1:02:27] all the way down through he says both
[1:02:29] died
[1:02:30] he's referring to wise and foolish
[1:02:33] slumbered and slept as they went down
[1:02:36] through now they're not lost but they
[1:02:38] just slumbered and slept their way and
[1:02:40] see they don't say they was dead but
[1:02:42] they're slumbering and sleeping
[1:02:45] they're in another dimension
[1:02:48] they're beyond the curtain of time
[1:02:50] they're in a sixth dimension
[1:02:52] the wise
[1:02:55] and the foolish
[1:02:58] they're waiting in paradise
[1:03:01] the foolish that died through the ages
[1:03:04] because they didn't have the oil
[1:03:07] to take them to the sixth
[1:03:10] and in that fifth dimension
[1:03:12] we realized that it was
[1:03:14] in two parts
[1:03:16] one was paradise
[1:03:19] one was a prison house of hell
[1:03:22] one was torment
[1:03:23] the other was peace
[1:03:25] and they'll wait there for a white
[1:03:27] throne judgment
[1:03:33] both all died it says
[1:03:35] wise and foolish through seven church
[1:03:37] ages
[1:03:41] all the way from ephesians
[1:03:43] to laodicea
[1:03:45] in the ephesians church the spirit
[1:03:48] says
[1:03:49] i'll give you to eat of the tree of life
[1:03:52] both wise and foolish
[1:03:54] in the smyrna church ages be thou
[1:03:57] faithful unto death he that overcometh
[1:03:59] shall not be heard of the second death
[1:04:02] in pergamus the spirit says to the
[1:04:04] church
[1:04:05] i will give you to eat of the hidden
[1:04:07] manna and will give them a white stone
[1:04:10] can the stone a new name written which
[1:04:12] no man knoweth except he
[1:04:14] that receiveth it
[1:04:16] in ty tyra he says
[1:04:18] he says to the wise and the foolish hold
[1:04:20] fast till i come
[1:04:22] and i will give you the morning star
[1:04:25] through sardis he speaks
[1:04:27] i will not blot out your name
[1:04:30] the same shall be clothed
[1:04:32] in white raiment both wise and foolish
[1:04:37] in philadelphia he says i'll write upon
[1:04:40] you
[1:04:40] my new name
[1:04:43] the new name
[1:04:44] was the same name
[1:04:50] but up to philadelphia
[1:04:52] the name of jesus christ had been lost
[1:04:57] they had no book
[1:04:59] they had no bible
[1:05:01] they had the dogmas from the creeds
[1:05:05] of the roman catholic church they had
[1:05:08] what the priests would tell them
[1:05:12] they had father
[1:05:14] son and holy ghost
[1:05:18] no revelation
[1:05:19] they had the parable
[1:05:22] and no one understood it
[1:05:26] so no one had the revelation
[1:05:28] so no one could live out this part of
[1:05:30] the word
[1:05:31] but in philadelphia he says
[1:05:34] i will write upon you
[1:05:36] my new name
[1:05:38] it was the same name
[1:05:41] once again revealed to his children
[1:05:44] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:05:48] in laodicea he said if any man hear my
[1:05:51] voice
[1:05:52] and open the door
[1:05:54] the door that was shut in eden
[1:05:57] i will come unto him
[1:05:59] the ladies in church age
[1:06:01] is the time of the 11th hour believers
[1:06:05] both wise and foolish
[1:06:08] in world war ii
[1:06:10] there was what was called the doomsday
[1:06:12] clock
[1:06:13] it was established by
[1:06:15] the scientific community it wasn't a
[1:06:18] literal clock it was symbolic
[1:06:22] they they felt the second world war had
[1:06:25] brought us
[1:06:26] to
[1:06:26] minutes before the midnight hour
[1:06:29] the total destruction of the whole world
[1:06:32] they had had one world war already
[1:06:34] within 17 years they had another world
[1:06:37] war
[1:06:38] world war one
[1:06:40] was the sounding of the fifth trumpet
[1:06:43] under the fifth seal
[1:06:45] it was the first woe
[1:06:47] world war ii
[1:06:49] was the sounding of the sixth trumpet
[1:06:51] under the sixth seal
[1:06:54] so from
[1:06:57] the early century
[1:06:58] 1900 1914 1999
[1:07:03] the 11th hour had begun
[1:07:07] and within 17 years
[1:07:09] the fifth seal had opened
[1:07:11] was loosed
[1:07:13] and the six seal had opened and was
[1:07:15] loose they were no longer overlapping
[1:07:19] they were running in parable now
[1:07:21] because the lord said i will make a
[1:07:23] quick
[1:07:23] short work
[1:07:26] now the first four seals
[1:07:30] took two thousand years to unfold
[1:07:33] but the last three
[1:07:36] within less than 60 years
[1:07:38] god opened this up
[1:07:41] and they're racing in parable
[1:07:44] and the clock is ticking
[1:07:46] and it's moving quicker and it's moving
[1:07:49] faster
[1:07:50] and god's fulfilling his word
[1:07:54] matthew 25 number six
[1:07:57] it said
[1:07:58] and at midnight there was a cry made
[1:08:01] behold the bridegroom
[1:08:03] cometh
[1:08:04] go ye
[1:08:05] out to meet him
[1:08:08] one cried of the lord himself
[1:08:12] with three manifestations
[1:08:15] each one designed to take us closer
[1:08:18] to take us higher
[1:08:20] to take us deeper to him
[1:08:22] that's the shout out
[1:08:24] the voice of the archangel
[1:08:26] and the trump of god
[1:08:29] now we see scriptures coming together
[1:08:32] this is
[1:08:33] a prophecy
[1:08:34] of the eleventh hour
[1:08:36] matthew 25
[1:08:38] a prophecy
[1:08:39] of the eleventh hour
[1:08:42] the shout unfolding in a in the in a
[1:08:45] one-man ministry
[1:08:47] of elijah
[1:08:48] and when the elijah ministry is gone
[1:08:51] when the one-man ministry has ended what
[1:08:53] follows
[1:08:55] the ministry of a many-membered body
[1:08:58] what was the pattern
[1:09:01] jesus
[1:09:04] appears to them after his death burial
[1:09:05] and resurrection
[1:09:07] for a period of 40 days
[1:09:10] at the end of 40 days
[1:09:12] he goes and talks to the disciples he
[1:09:14] tells them go ye terry in jerusalem
[1:09:17] he says and within 10 days from today
[1:09:21] you'll be endued with power from an eye
[1:09:25] you say brother daniel didn't say to you
[1:09:27] 10 days no i said it because it was 10
[1:09:29] days because it was 50 days
[1:09:31] jubilee time the day of pentecost
[1:09:36] jubilee time
[1:09:38] and what was born
[1:09:40] was a church
[1:09:42] a new testament church
[1:09:45] and what ended with a one-man ministry
[1:09:48] now it exploded with the ministry of the
[1:09:50] body of jesus christ a many-membered
[1:09:52] body with a fightful ministry
[1:09:56] so that was the pattern then at the
[1:09:58] first coming
[1:09:59] it must be the pattern again for these
[1:10:02] hebrews 13 and 8 is the same yesterday
[1:10:04] today and forever he's unchanging in all
[1:10:07] his ways
[1:10:10] paul opening the mystery
[1:10:13] adding details to the ending of the
[1:10:15] eleventh hour
[1:10:16] and the chiming in of a midnight crime
[1:10:19] but not revealing it as of yet
[1:10:22] for when paul spoke in first
[1:10:24] thessalonians 4 16
[1:10:26] it also
[1:10:28] was a parable
[1:10:31] because his ministers
[1:10:34] his prophets
[1:10:36] spoke as the lord himself
[1:10:39] and they spoke in parables
[1:10:41] oftentimes
[1:10:43] when they spoke it not understanding it
[1:10:45] themselves
[1:10:49] but they were men who had learned to be
[1:10:51] obedient
[1:10:53] william branham
[1:10:55] by the things he suffered
[1:10:57] he learned obedience
[1:10:59] very quickly
[1:11:03] first thessalonians 4 16
[1:11:05] the apostle paul said
[1:11:07] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:11:09] heaven with a shout
[1:11:11] with the voice of the archangel with the
[1:11:13] trump of god
[1:11:14] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:11:20] part of the eleventh hour
[1:11:23] the shout
[1:11:24] is history no longer prophecy
[1:11:28] the voice of the archangel
[1:11:30] is happening while we speak
[1:11:33] and we are waiting for the trump of god
[1:11:36] when a wise virgin
[1:11:38] with her vessel full of oil
[1:11:40] that keeps her lampa burning
[1:11:43] will be quick and
[1:11:44] changed and translated by the power of
[1:11:47] the holy spirit
[1:11:51] matthew chapter
[1:11:53] verse 1 6 1-16 is
[1:11:56] also an 11th hour parable
[1:11:59] of the seven churches
[1:12:01] from ephesus to laodicea
[1:12:04] it's the calling and choosing of the
[1:12:05] mystical body of jesus christ and the
[1:12:08] reward is the same through all seven
[1:12:10] measures of this body of christ
[1:12:13] eternal life
[1:12:14] that's the point of this parable
[1:12:16] throughout seven church ages
[1:12:19] all will receive the same reward
[1:12:22] eternal life
[1:12:24] amen
[1:12:26] in verse 10 of matthew 20
[1:12:29] it said but when the first came they
[1:12:31] supposed that they should have received
[1:12:33] more
[1:12:34] and they likewise received every man a
[1:12:36] penny
[1:12:38] and when they had received it they
[1:12:39] murmured against the good man of the
[1:12:41] house
[1:12:42] saying these last
[1:12:43] have rot but one hour
[1:12:46] and thou has made them equal unto us
[1:12:48] which have borne the burden and heat of
[1:12:50] the day
[1:12:52] what was god telling us
[1:12:54] the laodicean church
[1:12:56] will be the shortest of all of us
[1:13:00] it will be the shortest of all
[1:13:04] then he says but he answered on one of
[1:13:07] them and said
[1:13:08] friend i do thee no wrong can direct not
[1:13:11] thou agree with me for a penny
[1:13:13] take that take
[1:13:15] take that thine is and go thy way and i
[1:13:18] will give unto this last even
[1:13:21] as unto thee
[1:13:23] it is not lawful for me to do what i
[1:13:25] will with my own is thy nine evil
[1:13:27] because i am good
[1:13:29] so the last shall be first and the first
[1:13:32] last
[1:13:33] for many are called
[1:13:35] but few
[1:13:36] are chosen
[1:13:39] an eleventh hour parable
[1:13:42] and the gift of god
[1:13:44] to the mystical body
[1:13:46] of which we are a part of that body
[1:13:50] we're not the whole body
[1:13:52] but we are just one part
[1:13:54] one of seven throughout seven church
[1:13:56] ages
[1:13:58] that's why they without us could not be
[1:14:01] made perfect
[1:14:03] they didn't lack the open book
[1:14:06] they didn't lack the the the revelation
[1:14:09] of the seven seals
[1:14:12] as i like to say
[1:14:14] and if i don't have time to explain it
[1:14:16] i'll lay that load on brother paul
[1:14:19] to do it
[1:14:22] but the first time the book was opened
[1:14:24] wasn't 1963
[1:14:27] and the first time the book was open was
[1:14:29] it william branham
[1:14:31] the first time the book was opened
[1:14:33] it was opened by jesus christ
[1:14:36] and the first one to loose the seals
[1:14:39] and open them was jesus christ
[1:14:43] let me just drop something in so you can
[1:14:45] study it
[1:14:46] the sixth seal
[1:14:48] brother branham says
[1:14:49] we're going to do something different
[1:14:51] tonight
[1:14:54] he says i want you to open your bible
[1:14:55] like this and he takes his bible
[1:14:58] to keep it open to matthew 24
[1:15:01] and revelation 6
[1:15:03] and i'm gonna show you
[1:15:05] how jesus preached
[1:15:07] those seven seals
[1:15:09] in a parable that's right
[1:15:11] because what was the style of preaching
[1:15:13] to be
[1:15:15] in a parable and without a parable he
[1:15:17] would not speak
[1:15:18] but when he would speak in these
[1:15:20] parables be sure that what he's telling
[1:15:22] you are things that have been hidden
[1:15:24] since the foundation of the world be
[1:15:26] sure that what he's saying in this
[1:15:28] parables are things that only adam has
[1:15:30] ever heard
[1:15:31] but now he's sharing it with you his
[1:15:34] beloved his wife his bride his children
[1:15:37] his family
[1:15:41] matthew 25 and verse 7
[1:15:44] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[1:15:47] their lamps
[1:15:49] and the foolish said unto the wise give
[1:15:51] us of your oil
[1:15:53] for our lamps are gone out
[1:15:56] but the wise answered saying not so
[1:16:00] lest there be not enough for us and you
[1:16:03] but go ye rather to them that sell and
[1:16:06] buy for yourselves
[1:16:08] verse 8 said
[1:16:10] the foolish said to the wise
[1:16:12] give us of your oil
[1:16:14] our lamps are gone out
[1:16:17] they were made of two
[1:16:18] parts one part of these lamps
[1:16:22] was the vessel
[1:16:23] that like this bottles holding the water
[1:16:27] so the vessels held the oil
[1:16:30] then the lamp sat on top
[1:16:33] the term the lamp represented the wick
[1:16:37] so the foolish version wasn't saying it
[1:16:39] was not insinuating that they had oil
[1:16:42] it's to some measure
[1:16:44] remember to begin the parable they had
[1:16:47] no oil
[1:16:49] their vessels were empty
[1:16:51] the lamp was the wick
[1:16:53] they're saying here
[1:16:55] give us of your oil
[1:16:58] because we can't keep our our wicks lit
[1:17:02] because there's no oil in the vessel
[1:17:09] but the wise answered saying not so
[1:17:12] lest there be not enough for us and you
[1:17:15] but go ye rather to them that sell
[1:17:17] and buy for yourselves
[1:17:20] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:17:23] is available in abundance
[1:17:26] but no man can give it to you
[1:17:29] william branham couldn't give it
[1:17:30] paul couldn't give it
[1:17:32] i can't give it
[1:17:34] no minister no prophet no priest no king
[1:17:38] no evangelist
[1:17:39] can give you the holy ghost
[1:17:44] but you can go
[1:17:46] straight to the father
[1:17:49] and he can give it
[1:17:51] and he can give your cup to overflowing
[1:17:58] remember in revelations chapter 5
[1:18:02] and verse 5
[1:18:04] and verse 4 it says john was weeping
[1:18:07] and one of the elders tell them john
[1:18:09] don't weep
[1:18:10] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:18:17] was able to open the book
[1:18:20] and lose the seven seals around
[1:18:23] that was jesus christ at his first
[1:18:24] coming
[1:18:26] because remember a prophet said
[1:18:32] this open book
[1:18:33] this revealed word was first given to
[1:18:36] israel
[1:18:37] what israel rejected at the cross of
[1:18:40] calvary was now given to a gentile
[1:18:43] people
[1:18:44] remember the old testament allegory
[1:18:47] joseph come with his two sons
[1:18:50] he put his eldest son at the right hand
[1:18:52] of jacob who was blind and his last days
[1:18:55] were upon him
[1:18:56] he put this younger son at the left
[1:18:59] because jacob couldn't recognize him who
[1:19:01] was who
[1:19:03] so joseph put him according to custom
[1:19:05] and ritual
[1:19:07] and as jacob is going
[1:19:09] to give the lion's share to the
[1:19:11] firstborn the older son
[1:19:13] and just a little blessing to the
[1:19:15] younger
[1:19:16] he crosses his hands
[1:19:19] and he gives the lion's share
[1:19:22] to the younger amen
[1:19:24] representing that at the cross of
[1:19:26] calvary
[1:19:28] the inheritance of the father that was
[1:19:30] for israel
[1:19:31] when they would reject it
[1:19:33] would all go to the younger son
[1:19:36] watch how god writes his word
[1:19:38] you have been told many times that a
[1:19:41] woman in the bible
[1:19:43] represents the church
[1:19:46] and then god turns around
[1:19:48] and takes two boys are younger and older
[1:19:51] and they represent the church
[1:19:56] god loves to hide it
[1:19:58] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[1:20:00] and revealed unto babes such as would
[1:20:02] learn
[1:20:03] about the time if you think you've got
[1:20:05] him figured out
[1:20:07] you realize you still need revelation
[1:20:13] if we've been able to go deeper in the
[1:20:15] word it's because he's took us deeper
[1:20:19] not because we've been able to go there
[1:20:22] it's because he took us by the hand
[1:20:25] and walked us in
[1:20:27] deeper
[1:20:28] and deeper
[1:20:30] and deeper
[1:20:32] matthew 25 8 and the foolish said unto
[1:20:35] the wise
[1:20:36] give us of your oil
[1:20:38] for our lamps are gone out
[1:20:40] now you realize
[1:20:41] they had no oil
[1:20:43] that's what the scripture said and the
[1:20:46] lamps coined out the lamp was the wick
[1:20:49] not the vessel
[1:20:51] the vessel was empty
[1:20:54] and the wick wouldn't stay lit
[1:20:57] because it had no oil to draw from for
[1:21:00] the fire to keep burning
[1:21:03] but the wise answer said not so lester
[1:21:06] be not enough for us and you but go ye
[1:21:08] rather to them that sell and buy for
[1:21:09] yourselves and while they went to buy
[1:21:12] the bride bridegroom came
[1:21:15] and they that were ready went in with
[1:21:17] him to the marriage
[1:21:18] and the door was shut
[1:21:20] because when they went to buy
[1:21:24] they wouldn't find anyone
[1:21:26] to buy it from right right
[1:21:29] because the ministry that remained
[1:21:32] remained because they didn't have the
[1:21:33] oil either
[1:21:40] afterward came also the other virgin
[1:21:42] saying lord lord open to us but he
[1:21:44] answered and said verily i say unto you
[1:21:46] i know you not
[1:21:49] i don't know you at this hour
[1:21:52] for a rapture
[1:21:54] for a body change to be too quick in you
[1:21:58] but i'll know you had a white throne
[1:22:00] judgment that's right
[1:22:05] so someone might say it says he knew
[1:22:07] them not that means they're lost no no
[1:22:09] no no
[1:22:11] slow down
[1:22:14] in order to this word to be revealed to
[1:22:16] our hearts
[1:22:19] before we jump to another thought
[1:22:21] we must connect it
[1:22:24] with another scripture another scripture
[1:22:27] and each scripture keeps adding
[1:22:30] more detail
[1:22:31] and the great plan of redemption
[1:22:33] starts opening up
[1:22:35] and we start realizing the price he paid
[1:22:39] for my salvation
[1:22:41] and your salvation
[1:22:43] we start realizing the detail he's put
[1:22:46] in to saving you to healing you to
[1:22:49] baptizing you
[1:22:55] but he answered and said verily i say
[1:22:57] unto you i know you not verse 13
[1:23:00] watch therefore for ye know neither the
[1:23:02] day
[1:23:04] nor the hour wherein the son of man
[1:23:06] cometh
[1:23:09] this time of wise and foolish virgins in
[1:23:11] matthew 25
[1:23:13] it's also the time of the coming of the
[1:23:16] son of man
[1:23:17] jesus christ
[1:23:18] his second coming
[1:23:21] at this time
[1:23:22] where was the son of man ministry
[1:23:25] in the voice of many waters
[1:23:27] go to them that sell and buy
[1:23:30] the six full ministry of jesus christ
[1:23:33] because i include the head of every home
[1:23:36] and many helps in the church
[1:23:40] and i clued the head of every home
[1:23:42] because the head of every home
[1:23:44] has a great responsibility
[1:23:47] because you're the pastor
[1:23:49] of your house
[1:23:52] amen
[1:23:54] in the first exodus
[1:23:56] moses told them what to do
[1:23:59] but unless the head of the home applied
[1:24:01] the blood on the door
[1:24:02] death would walk through that house
[1:24:05] death would take the firstborn
[1:24:07] jew gentile and egyptian
[1:24:10] unless the blood was on the doorposts
[1:24:13] death would come through
[1:24:14] amen and though we preach the gospel
[1:24:17] from
[1:24:18] a nice pulpit nice chairs and pews
[1:24:22] then it lays upon the head of every home
[1:24:24] to apply the word in its own to put your
[1:24:28] own house in order amen
[1:24:32] by the leading of the holy ghost amen
[1:24:34] by baptism after baptism and feeling
[1:24:37] after failing
[1:24:39] god will make you a wise steward
[1:24:41] amen in your home amen
[1:24:43] if you can believe
[1:24:45] if we can humble ourselves
[1:24:48] how shall we buy
[1:24:50] isaiah 55 and 1 says this
[1:24:54] oh everyone that thirsts
[1:24:56] coming to the waters
[1:24:58] and the and he that hath no money come
[1:25:00] ye by and eat they come by wine and milk
[1:25:04] without money
[1:25:06] without price
[1:25:08] how do you buy without money and without
[1:25:10] price
[1:25:14] it has to be something already paid for
[1:25:17] and then
[1:25:19] what you have in your what you bring to
[1:25:21] buy
[1:25:23] is no longer the purchase price that has
[1:25:25] been paid
[1:25:28] but what you bring in your hand to show
[1:25:32] is a token
[1:25:33] of the purchase price
[1:25:36] and everything you ask
[1:25:38] in his name
[1:25:40] if you can believe
[1:25:42] god will give it to you that's right
[1:25:46] wherefore do you spend money for that
[1:25:48] which is not bread
[1:25:49] your labor for what for that which
[1:25:51] satisfyeth not arch diligently unto me
[1:25:54] and eat ye that which is good and let
[1:25:57] your soul delight itself
[1:26:00] in fatness
[1:26:01] incline your ear and come unto me here
[1:26:04] and your soul shall live and i will make
[1:26:06] an everlasting covenant with you
[1:26:08] even the sure mercies
[1:26:11] of david
[1:26:13] another parable
[1:26:15] that'll add details to this eleventh
[1:26:17] hour
[1:26:19] and the midnight cry
[1:26:20] and the rapturing time
[1:26:23] all the same time
[1:26:25] luke 17 and verse 34
[1:26:28] it's speaking of the same
[1:26:31] modern event
[1:26:33] that was to take place
[1:26:35] of a rapture
[1:26:36] of people being changed of a wise virgin
[1:26:40] luke 17 34
[1:26:42] reads like this
[1:26:44] i tell you in that night
[1:26:46] which night the night of matthew 25
[1:26:49] can i tell you in that night there shall
[1:26:51] be two men
[1:26:53] in one bed
[1:26:55] well that's kind of strange
[1:26:58] does it rub you the wrong way maybe in
[1:26:59] this day we live
[1:27:01] but listen
[1:27:03] this
[1:27:04] is a parable
[1:27:08] i tell you from that night there shall
[1:27:09] be two men in one bed the one shall be
[1:27:11] taken
[1:27:12] and the other shall be left
[1:27:16] two women shall be grinding together the
[1:27:18] one shall be taken
[1:27:20] and the other left
[1:27:22] two men shall be in the field the one
[1:27:25] shall be taken
[1:27:26] and the other left
[1:27:30] and the answered and said unto him where
[1:27:32] lord
[1:27:33] and he said unto them
[1:27:35] wheresoever the body is
[1:27:37] there will the eagles be gathered
[1:27:40] the fourth living creature
[1:27:43] in the time of the ride of the pale
[1:27:45] horse rider
[1:27:46] at a laodicean church time
[1:27:50] at the 11th hour time eagle time
[1:27:55] did you notice
[1:27:57] how the holy spirit weaves in a detail
[1:27:59] here
[1:28:00] to confirm what he's already told us in
[1:28:03] matthew 25
[1:28:07] in all three examples
[1:28:10] if you've noticed i know you did
[1:28:13] they're the same gender
[1:28:16] two men in the bed
[1:28:18] two women grinding
[1:28:20] two men in the field they're the same
[1:28:23] gender they are the same
[1:28:25] in what sense
[1:28:27] are they the same
[1:28:29] it's a parable
[1:28:32] two men in the bed
[1:28:34] they're the same
[1:28:36] it means
[1:28:37] they were both believers
[1:28:40] two women grinding at the mill
[1:28:42] same gender
[1:28:44] it means
[1:28:45] they were both believers
[1:28:47] two men in the field
[1:28:49] working in the field
[1:28:51] same gender
[1:28:53] they're the same what does it mean
[1:28:55] they were both believers
[1:29:01] all ten of them
[1:29:04] they were virgin
[1:29:06] they were all believers
[1:29:10] so one parable
[1:29:13] confirms and adds more detail to the
[1:29:15] next parable
[1:29:18] the wise and the foolish
[1:29:21] they're all
[1:29:22] genuine believers
[1:29:25] so where do you find genuine believers
[1:29:27] today
[1:29:30] in christ
[1:29:32] in the end time message
[1:29:34] in the word of the hour
[1:29:35] in this eagle age
[1:29:38] reading the books of a prophet
[1:29:40] loving their bibles
[1:29:42] and reading them every day
[1:29:44] they're believers
[1:29:46] why isn't foolish amen
[1:29:51] the foolish virgin
[1:29:53] you know you couldn't put a finger on
[1:29:55] their lives
[1:29:56] is what a prophet said
[1:29:59] in the ma in in the message the sudden
[1:30:01] secret going away
[1:30:03] brother brahma says in paragraph 35
[1:30:06] how many of you all perhaps have read of
[1:30:09] the virgins some were wise some were
[1:30:11] foolish convergent means purity
[1:30:14] they were all good people
[1:30:16] every one of them virgins sanctified
[1:30:18] vessels of god but those who had oil in
[1:30:20] their lamps went in
[1:30:22] and the others was left out they were
[1:30:24] all virgins to everyone people that you
[1:30:26] couldn't put your finger on anything
[1:30:30] wrong
[1:30:32] wise and foolish
[1:30:35] so then we begin to understand
[1:30:37] that the word foolish in this parable
[1:30:40] that the definition cannot be found in a
[1:30:43] dictionary
[1:30:45] because the definition of
[1:30:47] there's a thousand different things to
[1:30:49] be foolish
[1:30:52] and yet
[1:30:53] none of them apply
[1:30:57] to the word foolish in matthew 25.
[1:31:01] for the definition
[1:31:02] of foolish in matthew 25
[1:31:07] wasn't that they didn't have a good job
[1:31:11] wasn't that they didn't get a good
[1:31:12] education
[1:31:14] it wasn't that they failed to get a
[1:31:15] bachelor's or master's degree
[1:31:17] it wasn't that they didn't have a good
[1:31:19] home
[1:31:20] it wasn't that there were great uh
[1:31:22] daytime traders on the internet
[1:31:26] none of that
[1:31:28] one significance to foolish
[1:31:30] conscription this parable
[1:31:33] they failed to get the oil
[1:31:37] in their vessels
[1:31:40] webster would have never told you that
[1:31:43] the collegiate dictionary never said
[1:31:45] that
[1:31:47] the theologians never said that
[1:31:50] the pope of rome didn't confirm it
[1:31:55] but the bible is its own interpreter
[1:31:59] they were foolish
[1:32:01] for one reason alone
[1:32:04] when the midnight cry came
[1:32:06] when the midnight struck
[1:32:10] when people were being quick and changed
[1:32:12] and translated
[1:32:14] they realized
[1:32:16] they didn't have the oil
[1:32:18] they didn't have the goods
[1:32:21] that their relationship with the father
[1:32:23] hadn't gone to that level
[1:32:28] that's right
[1:32:30] it was a relationship problem
[1:32:35] and somehow
[1:32:37] you made other relationships in your
[1:32:39] life more important that's exactly right
[1:32:41] amen that's right he who loves father or
[1:32:44] mother more than i
[1:32:45] remember
[1:32:47] it's rapturing time
[1:32:51] you say you mean i've got to love him
[1:32:53] more than my mother
[1:32:55] you love him first
[1:32:58] and you'll love your mother like you've
[1:32:59] never loved it before
[1:33:01] you love him first and you'll love and
[1:33:03] treat your wife like a queen like you've
[1:33:05] never treated her before
[1:33:10] you ain't treating her like a queen
[1:33:13] you ain't loving him like you should
[1:33:16] know
[1:33:21] the foolish virgin
[1:33:23] they are sheep
[1:33:25] they are saved
[1:33:28] in the message
[1:33:29] the patmos vision
[1:33:32] paragraph 3
[1:33:34] but the man says now there's another
[1:33:36] question here that was given to me last
[1:33:37] evening
[1:33:39] brother branham are the foolish virgins
[1:33:41] of matthew 25
[1:33:43] counted as the gentile remnant i
[1:33:45] understand that the five foolish
[1:33:47] versions were saved but have to go to
[1:33:49] the great tribulation period is this
[1:33:52] correct
[1:33:54] we read revelations 12.
[1:33:57] and the great dragon came out after the
[1:33:59] woman
[1:34:00] comma
[1:34:02] and went after the remnant of her seed
[1:34:05] because she is gone
[1:34:08] she was gone
[1:34:10] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:34:13] in a supernatural nanosecond she was
[1:34:16] gone
[1:34:18] he says what do i do now uh the remnant
[1:34:21] i guess i'll chase her down now
[1:34:23] i can't find the bride i can't find that
[1:34:26] mystical body i can't find those who are
[1:34:29] full of the oil
[1:34:30] they've been quickened they've been
[1:34:32] changed
[1:34:33] the terrestrial has dropped the
[1:34:35] celestial has come in
[1:34:37] there had they had a meeting in the air
[1:34:40] happened so quick
[1:34:42] that even lucifer didn't catch it with
[1:34:44] his sharp twisted eyes
[1:34:48] amen brother branham says
[1:34:52] i understand that the foolish virgins
[1:34:54] were saved but have to go to the great
[1:34:55] tribulation period is this correct if so
[1:34:58] what will be their final destination
[1:35:01] could they be the sheep which were
[1:35:02] divided from the goats in matthew 25 and
[1:35:05] verse 2.
[1:35:07] brother and says
[1:35:09] pretty good theologian to what i think
[1:35:11] too
[1:35:12] that they are the remnant the sleeping
[1:35:14] virgin or the foolish virgin
[1:35:17] is the remnant spoke of in revelation
[1:35:20] it was the 12th chapter he was talking
[1:35:23] about
[1:35:24] of the woman seed that keep the
[1:35:26] commandments of god and have the
[1:35:28] testimony
[1:35:30] of jesus christ
[1:35:32] he goes on to say a woman will take a
[1:35:34] piece of goods lay it down now that is
[1:35:37] what she's cutting her she takes her
[1:35:39] pattern lays it any way she desires the
[1:35:42] way she's going to cut it and what's
[1:35:44] left over is called the remnant but she
[1:35:46] chooses to cut it from a certain place
[1:35:48] of her own free thinking but what's left
[1:35:51] over
[1:35:52] is called the remnant
[1:35:54] amen
[1:35:56] but it's the same cloth
[1:35:57] it's the same material
[1:36:00] they're both believers
[1:36:03] in the parable of luke 17
[1:36:06] there was two men
[1:36:08] in a bed
[1:36:11] there was two women
[1:36:12] grinding at the mill
[1:36:14] and there was two men
[1:36:16] in the field
[1:36:18] a parable
[1:36:20] what was the parable telling us
[1:36:23] the same thing
[1:36:24] that matthew 25 was telling us
[1:36:27] of the ten versions
[1:36:30] they're the same
[1:36:32] same gender
[1:36:34] they're all believers
[1:36:36] wise and foolish
[1:36:38] so when he comes down
[1:36:41] and he descends to take a bribe
[1:36:44] he's only going to come searching
[1:36:46] amongst the believers that's it but
[1:36:49] amongst the believers
[1:36:50] he's only going to take those whose
[1:36:52] vessels
[1:36:53] are full of oil
[1:36:55] that's exactly right amen amen how
[1:36:58] important amen for the believer
[1:37:01] is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:37:04] and refilling after refilling
[1:37:07] that's a daily promise
[1:37:10] prophet said one baptism amen many
[1:37:13] feelings
[1:37:15] because the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:37:18] is a friendship restored with the father
[1:37:21] like adam had eaten
[1:37:28] we were told
[1:37:29] it was speaking in tongues for the david
[1:37:33] if you didn't speak in tongues you
[1:37:35] didn't have nothing
[1:37:37] but if you spoke in tongues
[1:37:39] you had it all
[1:37:41] you could throw it into neutral and
[1:37:43] coast
[1:37:45] for the rest of your religious life
[1:37:49] and i had a good friend
[1:37:52] and this good friend
[1:37:53] was baptized as a young man in the
[1:37:55] apostolic church
[1:37:58] just a young man
[1:38:00] maybe early twenties then
[1:38:03] and when they baptized them in the water
[1:38:05] he came out of the water
[1:38:08] speaking in tongues by the day
[1:38:12] while the pentecostal people and
[1:38:13] obstacle people
[1:38:16] this was a picture-perfect scene of
[1:38:18] their creed and doctor
[1:38:22] they start grooming him
[1:38:24] why he'll be the next president of the
[1:38:26] assembly
[1:38:28] but within five years this young man
[1:38:31] got long hair a beard
[1:38:34] a 45 on his hip
[1:38:35] and driving a harley davidson in los
[1:38:37] angeles
[1:38:39] what happened
[1:38:45] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:38:51] you can drive a stake down when you get
[1:38:53] it
[1:38:56] and that'll hold you in the toughest of
[1:38:58] storms
[1:39:00] that'll hold you through the most
[1:39:02] abusive relationships that's exactly
[1:39:04] right that'll keep you when cancer
[1:39:06] strikes and it goes from the top of your
[1:39:08] head to the bottom of your feet the
[1:39:09] baptism of the holy ghost it's a thai
[1:39:12] post
[1:39:13] it's a promise
[1:39:15] it's the power of god unto redemption
[1:39:20] it's a life-changing experience
[1:39:23] and that's what elijah come to do
[1:39:26] that's what the first elijah came to do
[1:39:30] so we watched the pattern of his word
[1:39:34] isaiah 40.
[1:39:36] isaiah anointed of god
[1:39:39] begins to prophesy
[1:39:41] of this forerunner that's to come
[1:39:44] and he begins to tell us the style of
[1:39:47] his ministry
[1:39:50] he says he says he'll he'll make
[1:39:53] awake in the wilderness
[1:39:55] a path
[1:39:58] the valley's
[1:39:59] when he comes he will fill him
[1:40:01] the mountains he'll leave them as planes
[1:40:05] every crooked road he'll straighten it
[1:40:08] out
[1:40:09] that's right and the rough places he'll
[1:40:11] make smooth
[1:40:12] there's five things
[1:40:16] so the young man i rushed to the new
[1:40:18] testament i read the life of john the
[1:40:20] baptist
[1:40:22] and i say
[1:40:25] i don't see any straight roads
[1:40:28] i don't see no valleys got filled
[1:40:30] mountains are still all around jerusalem
[1:40:32] not one of them gets chopped down
[1:40:35] there's rough places all over the place
[1:40:39] that's what's happening
[1:40:41] i don't see it
[1:40:43] and yet a prophet said it it's thus
[1:40:45] saith the lord
[1:40:47] what was it
[1:40:48] it was god
[1:40:50] through the prophet speaking
[1:40:53] in a parable
[1:40:57] every road
[1:41:00] make it straight
[1:41:02] that's a big change
[1:41:05] take a valley
[1:41:07] and fill it
[1:41:08] okay some of you are familiar with
[1:41:10] maracoopa valley in phoenix
[1:41:13] fill that valley what would it take
[1:41:15] and how long
[1:41:16] why where we have our little church in
[1:41:18] glendale we'd have a thousand feet of
[1:41:20] dirt above us
[1:41:21] that's a big change
[1:41:24] make everything that's rough smooth
[1:41:26] that's a big change
[1:41:30] so then i realized the holy spirit
[1:41:32] speaks to my heart
[1:41:35] it's
[1:41:37] john didn't straighten no roads
[1:41:39] john didn't feel no valleys john didn't
[1:41:41] chop new mountains
[1:41:44] i said lord what did he do this is what
[1:41:46] he did this is what he did
[1:41:48] he filled valleys he chopped mountains
[1:41:50] and made everything straight that's
[1:41:51] right
[1:41:54] then i realized the connecting link in
[1:41:56] all of them
[1:41:57] everyone
[1:41:59] was an impossible change for men to do
[1:42:02] but with god all things are possible so
[1:42:05] what was the ministry of the first
[1:42:06] forerunner elijah what was he going to
[1:42:08] bring to israel change change change
[1:42:11] change change
[1:42:13] change he was bringing
[1:42:15] going to change the way they live he was
[1:42:16] going to change the way they parent he's
[1:42:18] going to change marriage and divorce he
[1:42:20] was going to change everything for
[1:42:22] israel
[1:42:23] change was coming to israel when this
[1:42:25] forerunner came
[1:42:28] to change because he was going to
[1:42:30] introduce
[1:42:32] the king of kings
[1:42:34] he was going to he was going to
[1:42:36] introduce the changer
[1:42:40] that was the first elijah
[1:42:42] and when the second elijah come
[1:42:45] how many can look back and say
[1:42:47] that man
[1:42:49] brought change
[1:42:52] it's the pattern of his word
[1:42:55] it's the pattern of his word
[1:43:01] there are three kinds of believers
[1:43:05] but
[1:43:06] but
[1:43:10] but
[1:43:12] dave squirming knows the word he's going
[1:43:14] all right here comes the butt
[1:43:16] but
[1:43:18] in this saved church
[1:43:20] brother adam says
[1:43:21] there's two classes of people
[1:43:25] he said in the message the ten virgins
[1:43:27] in
[1:43:28] paragraph 33
[1:43:30] he says now this remnant was a sleeping
[1:43:32] virgin
[1:43:33] that he spurted the water from his mouth
[1:43:35] to make war with the remnant of the
[1:43:37] woman's seed
[1:43:38] now what is a remnant now there you have
[1:43:40] to get these types together now
[1:43:43] there's a church which is church natural
[1:43:45] maybe i can draw it here and make it a
[1:43:47] little bit plainer he says now brother
[1:43:49] neville if i take up some of your time
[1:43:50] you just forgive me he said now now
[1:43:53] remember that there is what the
[1:43:56] unbeliever he's drawing on the board
[1:43:58] he said i'm going to put he draws three
[1:44:00] circles
[1:44:01] i'm going to put ub on this one
[1:44:03] unbelievable
[1:44:05] that's the sinner
[1:44:06] okay and then there's another one which
[1:44:07] is the formal i'll put
[1:44:09] f o
[1:44:10] he's writing it on a board
[1:44:12] jeffersonville indiana
[1:44:14] ub fo
[1:44:16] draws a third circle
[1:44:18] he says can then here it is the other
[1:44:20] one which is the saved church
[1:44:23] i'll put s a the saved church
[1:44:26] now keep them in mind all the time
[1:44:30] and then people think
[1:44:32] okay believer unbeliever make believer
[1:44:37] where in the world does the foolish
[1:44:38] virgin fit in
[1:44:41] okay so now in the saved church
[1:44:43] there are two classes
[1:44:44] in this church right
[1:44:46] here
[1:44:47] he says
[1:44:49] which was typed by christ one of them
[1:44:51] was a sleeping virgin the other one had
[1:44:53] oil in the lamp
[1:44:55] how many remembers the story
[1:44:59] so wise and foolish once again who are
[1:45:02] they
[1:45:04] believers
[1:45:07] believers of what one's a baptist
[1:45:10] one's a pentecostal no no no
[1:45:13] these were believers
[1:45:15] in the coming of the lord
[1:45:18] yeah okay
[1:45:21] these were believers
[1:45:23] end-time believers
[1:45:25] end-time
[1:45:26] message believers
[1:45:28] end-time
[1:45:29] bible believers
[1:45:33] the foolish virgin
[1:45:35] brother brahman says
[1:45:38] well in a short brief statement the
[1:45:40] foolish words
[1:45:41] is a good woman
[1:45:45] he says
[1:45:46] in the seventh seal he said now what
[1:45:48] happened they were purged during the
[1:45:50] time of the awful tribulation period
[1:45:52] if god's going to purge that virgin that
[1:45:55] was a good woman but she failed to get
[1:45:58] oil in her lamp
[1:46:00] okay
[1:46:01] who was he speaking of
[1:46:03] the foolish one
[1:46:07] he said
[1:46:09] that was a good woman but she failed to
[1:46:12] get oil in her lamp and she's going and
[1:46:14] he's going to perjure through
[1:46:15] persecution
[1:46:17] in there he puts them tribes there in
[1:46:19] there for the same thing purges them
[1:46:21] during the time of tribulation period
[1:46:23] because it's a purging it's a judgment
[1:46:25] she stays behind
[1:46:27] for a great tribulation
[1:46:29] and when the great dragon
[1:46:32] come after the woman the wise virgin
[1:46:35] comma
[1:46:38] and he goes
[1:46:41] and chases the remnant of the woman's
[1:46:43] seed
[1:46:46] what's the comma
[1:46:48] rapturing time
[1:46:50] what's the comma the midnight hour
[1:46:53] what's the common
[1:46:55] quick and changed and translated amen
[1:46:58] what's the comma we went to meet him in
[1:47:00] the air
[1:47:02] and the devil is going
[1:47:06] they were just here second ago
[1:47:10] that's why i came to idaho i know
[1:47:12] they're here
[1:47:14] where'd they go
[1:47:16] ah i know
[1:47:18] there's a few left over
[1:47:21] believers
[1:47:22] the foolish
[1:47:24] they didn't have the oils
[1:47:26] but they're believers
[1:47:29] of this end time promise
[1:47:31] and the same time message where are they
[1:47:34] in the message
[1:47:36] the foolish virgin
[1:47:38] exactly
[1:47:43] the foolish virgin
[1:47:46] does not take the mark of the beast
[1:47:50] neither does he suffer torment in hell
[1:47:53] the fifth dimension is a prison house
[1:47:55] for those who've rejected christ
[1:47:57] but instead
[1:47:59] she's on the paradise side of this fifth
[1:48:01] dimension
[1:48:02] awaiting a white throne judgment
[1:48:04] where she's a virgin
[1:48:06] where she's an eagle
[1:48:08] where he is where she is the sheep
[1:48:10] of matthew 25 and 31.
[1:48:14] in matthew 25 and 31
[1:48:17] this is what a prophet referred to as
[1:48:19] the white throne judgment
[1:48:21] the second resurrection
[1:48:22] where all that have ever died on the
[1:48:25] face of the earth
[1:48:26] will rise in a resurrection
[1:48:28] to stand judgment
[1:48:30] okay verse 31 of matthew 25 said
[1:48:34] when the son of man shall come in his
[1:48:37] glory
[1:48:39] and all the holy angels with him
[1:48:42] then shall he sit upon the throne of his
[1:48:44] glory
[1:48:45] it's judgment time
[1:48:47] it's a tribunal
[1:48:49] he's judging the whole world
[1:48:51] it's not the first time he did this
[1:48:55] the first white throne judgment was back
[1:48:57] in haiti
[1:49:00] he judged the whole world then too
[1:49:03] well it was just three people but it was
[1:49:05] everybody
[1:49:07] it was everybody
[1:49:08] it'll be everybody again
[1:49:10] a final judgment
[1:49:12] verse 32 said
[1:49:14] and behold and before him shall be
[1:49:16] gathered all the nations
[1:49:19] and he shall separate them one from
[1:49:21] another
[1:49:22] as a shepherd divideth his sheep from
[1:49:24] the goats
[1:49:26] and he shall set the sheep on his right
[1:49:28] hand but the goats
[1:49:30] on the left
[1:49:32] then shall the king say unto them on his
[1:49:34] right hand
[1:49:36] he begins judgment with the sheep
[1:49:39] because judgment always begins in the
[1:49:41] house of god
[1:49:45] that's why god has established a pastor
[1:49:46] for you here
[1:49:52] a man that will preach to you a word
[1:49:54] that will purge your hearts souls and
[1:49:56] minds
[1:49:57] a command that will preach to your word
[1:50:01] that shows you the way
[1:50:03] to receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:50:07] of how to return back with into a
[1:50:09] friendship with the father
[1:50:12] that he might feel you
[1:50:14] every single day with a refilling of his
[1:50:16] spirit
[1:50:20] matthew 25
[1:50:22] and verse 34
[1:50:24] then shall the king say unto them on his
[1:50:26] right hand
[1:50:27] come ye blessed of my father
[1:50:30] inherit the kingdom prepared for you
[1:50:32] from the foundation of the world who is
[1:50:34] he speaking to
[1:50:36] a prophet said this was the foolish
[1:50:38] virgin
[1:50:42] he said for he says for i was a hunger
[1:50:46] and you gave me meat
[1:50:47] i was thirsty and you gave me drink
[1:50:50] i was a stranger and you took me in
[1:50:53] god
[1:50:54] an eyewitness of how the foolish virgin
[1:50:57] was living
[1:50:58] is now giving testimony at the highest
[1:51:01] court in the universe
[1:51:06] and he's saying
[1:51:07] naked
[1:51:09] and you clothed me
[1:51:11] i was sick
[1:51:12] and you visited me
[1:51:14] i was in prison and you came unto me
[1:51:18] this is not the wise
[1:51:22] the wise is standing at his side
[1:51:25] the groom and the bride the king and the
[1:51:27] queen amen
[1:51:29] this is the foolish that's right
[1:51:31] then shall the righteous answer him
[1:51:33] saying lord when saw we thee unhungered
[1:51:36] and fed
[1:51:38] or thirsty and gave thee drink
[1:51:43] when saw we thee a stranger and took
[1:51:46] thee in
[1:51:47] or naked in clothing
[1:51:49] or when saw with these sick or in prison
[1:51:52] and came unto thee
[1:51:54] this is a humble group
[1:51:58] this is a god-fearing group
[1:52:03] none of them jumped up and said yeah
[1:52:05] that's right that's that's me
[1:52:07] no no no
[1:52:08] no
[1:52:13] and the king shall answer and say unto
[1:52:15] them verily i say unto you
[1:52:17] in so much as you've done
[1:52:20] done it unto one of the least of these
[1:52:22] my brethren
[1:52:23] you've done it unto me
[1:52:26] so this foolish virgin who is
[1:52:28] she virgin
[1:52:31] or
[1:52:34] virgin
[1:52:36] believer
[1:52:37] or unbeliever
[1:52:39] believer
[1:52:40] eagle
[1:52:41] or quote
[1:52:43] eagle
[1:52:44] sheep or goat
[1:52:47] sheep
[1:52:48] remnant of the woman's seed or serpent
[1:52:51] seed
[1:52:52] remnant of the woman's seed
[1:52:56] this foolish version who is she
[1:53:00] your friend
[1:53:01] or your fault
[1:53:05] let me assure you
[1:53:08] she is your friend
[1:53:10] let me read you once again her deeds
[1:53:14] and this isn't men
[1:53:16] telling you this isn't a pastor saying
[1:53:18] how good you are
[1:53:20] this isn't a prophet discerning saying
[1:53:22] wow you're quite the guy
[1:53:24] no this is god
[1:53:26] this is king of kings this is lord of
[1:53:28] lords this he this is he who looks from
[1:53:31] on high and sees not only what you do
[1:53:34] but sees the intent of the heart of why
[1:53:36] you did
[1:53:39] that's exactly it right
[1:53:41] yes sir
[1:53:42] okay
[1:53:44] let me read you once again her deeds
[1:53:46] for though she misses rapturing faith
[1:53:49] and a supernatural body change at the
[1:53:51] white throne judgment
[1:53:52] the sheep of god are exonerated
[1:53:55] of all sin
[1:53:57] for their godly deeds
[1:53:59] and lifestyle that's exactly right
[1:54:03] verse 31
[1:54:05] when the son of man shall come in his
[1:54:07] glory and all the angels with him then
[1:54:10] shall he sit upon the throne of his
[1:54:11] glory
[1:54:13] and before him shall be gathered all the
[1:54:15] nations and he shall separate them one
[1:54:17] from another
[1:54:19] as a shepherd divided his sheep from the
[1:54:21] goats
[1:54:24] and he shall set the sheep on his right
[1:54:27] hand but the goats on the left
[1:54:31] then shall the king say unto them on his
[1:54:33] right hand
[1:54:34] come
[1:54:35] ye blessed and my father
[1:54:37] inherit the kingdom prepared for you
[1:54:40] from the foundation
[1:54:41] of the world
[1:54:44] wasn't a sudden decision
[1:54:48] he knew it all the time
[1:54:50] who were his
[1:54:51] and he said all that the father has
[1:54:53] given me
[1:54:54] wise or foolish
[1:54:56] i'll not lose a one.
[1:54:58] amen
[1:54:59] paul said i am adapter both to the wise
[1:55:03] and the unwise why because they're my
[1:55:05] brothers they're my sisters
[1:55:12] matthew 35 25 35 for i wasn't hungered
[1:55:15] and he gave me meat
[1:55:16] i was thirsty and you gave me drink
[1:55:18] i was a stranger and you took me in
[1:55:22] naked and you clothed me i was sick and
[1:55:24] you visited me i was in prison you came
[1:55:26] unto me
[1:55:27] then shall the righteous answer i'm
[1:55:29] saying lord
[1:55:31] when saw we thee and hungered and fed
[1:55:33] your thirsty and gave thee drink
[1:55:35] when saw with thee a stranger and took
[1:55:37] the inner naked in clothing
[1:55:39] when saw thee saw these sick or
[1:55:42] imprisoned and came unto thee
[1:55:44] and the king shall answer and say unto
[1:55:47] them
[1:55:48] verily i say unto you
[1:55:50] insomuch as you've done it unto one of
[1:55:52] the least of these my brethren
[1:55:54] you've done it unto
[1:55:56] me amen
[1:56:00] preachers and those who think they
[1:56:03] are
[1:56:04] have used this parable
[1:56:06] to try to discern who is foolish
[1:56:09] and who is wise
[1:56:11] let me tell you
[1:56:12] you've wasted your time
[1:56:14] and completely missed the reason for the
[1:56:16] parables
[1:56:22] once more
[1:56:23] as a reminder
[1:56:25] to ministers of the gospel i am adapter
[1:56:29] both to the greeks
[1:56:31] and to the barbarians
[1:56:33] both to the wise and to the unwise
[1:56:37] paul said
[1:56:38] i will reach down my hand to anyone
[1:56:42] who'll put their hand in mind so and i
[1:56:45] will lift them up
[1:56:50] so as much as in me is i'm ready to
[1:56:52] preach the gospel to you
[1:56:54] that at rome also
[1:56:57] this parable
[1:56:59] as many and all
[1:57:01] is to provoke a very personal question
[1:57:04] that you must ask yourself this evening
[1:57:07] or allow me
[1:57:09] or yet better
[1:57:10] the apostle paul
[1:57:14] my brother
[1:57:15] in christ
[1:57:18] acts 19 and 1
[1:57:22] reads like this
[1:57:23] and it came to pass
[1:57:25] that while apollos was at corinth
[1:57:28] paul having passed through the upper
[1:57:30] coast came to ephesus
[1:57:33] and finding certain disciples
[1:57:37] he said unto them
[1:57:39] have you received the holy ghost since
[1:57:41] you believed
[1:57:43] they said unto him
[1:57:45] we have not so much as
[1:57:46] heard whether can there be a holy ghost
[1:57:49] our pastor never preaches about it
[1:57:53] the message church we're in they don't
[1:57:55] ever remind us of that we need it
[1:57:59] and he said unto them
[1:58:00] unto what then were ye baptized
[1:58:03] they said unto john's baptism
[1:58:06] paul goes
[1:58:08] then said paul
[1:58:09] john
[1:58:11] barely baptized
[1:58:13] with the baptism of repentance
[1:58:16] he was very careful how he talked about
[1:58:17] john
[1:58:23] saying unto the people that they should
[1:58:25] believe on him
[1:58:27] which should come after this elijah
[1:58:30] whether it be the first one or the
[1:58:32] second one they should believe on him
[1:58:35] that comes after elijah
[1:58:39] that is on christ jesus they should
[1:58:42] believe on the lord jesus christ
[1:58:46] when they heard this they were baptized
[1:58:50] in the name of the lord jesus
[1:58:52] because
[1:58:54] they were believers
[1:58:58] have you not been baptized in the name
[1:59:00] of the lord jesus christ
[1:59:02] i want to believe because you're here
[1:59:04] tonight
[1:59:06] that you're a believer
[1:59:09] and you just need someone like me
[1:59:12] to remind you
[1:59:14] repent and be baptized
[1:59:17] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:59:22] and even if you were one that one day
[1:59:24] screamed crucify him
[1:59:27] i still extend to your invitation
[1:59:30] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:59:32] the lord jesus christ and you shall
[1:59:35] receive this gift
[1:59:37] of this holy ghost promise
[1:59:40] amen
[1:59:41] that'll change you
[1:59:45] it'll bring change
[1:59:47] change
[1:59:48] change
[1:59:49] change change
[1:59:50] you'll never be the same
[1:59:53] it'll bring joy peace
[1:59:56] and the love of god in our hearts
[2:00:01] and when paul had laid his hands upon
[2:00:03] him
[2:00:04] the holy ghost came on them
[2:00:06] and they spake with tongues
[2:00:09] and prophesied
[2:00:12] and all the men
[2:00:14] were about
[2:00:16] 12.
[2:00:18] it was a great revival
[2:00:21] it was a great holy ghost meeting
[2:00:25] they arrived
[2:00:27] with doubts
[2:00:28] they arrived with a lack of revelation
[2:00:33] and they left with their doubts resolved
[2:00:36] they left with revelation in their
[2:00:38] hearts
[2:00:41] they left
[2:00:42] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:00:46] they've been changed
[2:00:50] one change
[2:00:52] of many changes
[2:00:54] that's what adoption is all about
[2:00:57] change
[2:00:58] god changing you that's right
[2:01:01] daily
[2:01:02] every day
[2:01:04] is changing us
[2:01:06] there shouldn't pass a day
[2:01:09] that we haven't experienced something
[2:01:11] amen
[2:01:12] where god has changed us
[2:01:16] the daily changes can be very difficult
[2:01:20] but if you can stand
[2:01:23] the chastisement and the teaching of the
[2:01:25] holy spirit
[2:01:27] to change you now
[2:01:29] the easiest change will be the last
[2:01:32] a body change
[2:01:35] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[2:01:38] you won't even know what's happened till
[2:01:39] you're in another dimension
[2:01:42] the last one
[2:01:44] is the easiest
[2:01:46] the hardest one
[2:01:49] is even one tonight
[2:01:54] well repeat again
[2:01:56] repent and be baptized yes sir in the
[2:01:59] name of the lord jesus christ
[2:02:02] and you shall receive
[2:02:05] the gift of the holy spirit
[2:02:08] it's a promise
[2:02:10] amen but what if i was that day before
[2:02:13] pilate's court
[2:02:15] and what if i was screaming crucify him
[2:02:22] peter knew they were
[2:02:24] he saw him in the
[2:02:26] in the multitude of people
[2:02:28] he recognized him
[2:02:29] the holy spirit discerned their hearts
[2:02:33] one two three
[2:02:35] wow at least 500 of you were there
[2:02:37] screaming crucify him
[2:02:40] and they were pricked in their hearts
[2:02:43] because they knew they had screamed
[2:02:45] crucify him
[2:02:46] they knew they had walked away from him
[2:02:48] on that day
[2:02:51] and the one that was pricked the deepest
[2:02:53] come forward and said
[2:02:56] i did scream crucify
[2:02:59] what do i do now
[2:03:01] peter said this is what you do
[2:03:04] repent
[2:03:06] and be baptized in the name of the lord
[2:03:08] jesus christ
[2:03:09] and you shall receive
[2:03:12] amen the gift of the holy spirit amen
[2:03:16] amen
[2:03:18] maybe you're thinking
[2:03:19] i i just can't do it oh you can't wait
[2:03:22] another second to not do it
[2:03:28] while the spirit's calling amen
[2:03:32] amen
[2:03:39] acts 2 36
[2:03:42] therefore let all the house of israel
[2:03:44] know assuredly
[2:03:46] that god hath made the same jesus whom
[2:03:50] you have crucified
[2:03:51] both lord
[2:03:53] and christ
[2:03:55] now when they heard this
[2:03:57] because they were the ones screaming
[2:03:59] crucify him at pilate's court
[2:04:02] they were pricked in their heart
[2:04:04] and said unto peter
[2:04:08] and to the rest of the apostles
[2:04:12] do you know what we've done
[2:04:15] i'm just now just now dawning on me what
[2:04:17] we've done
[2:04:19] peter says yeah i know what you did
[2:04:21] okay i did it too
[2:04:25] just
[2:04:26] what do we do now
[2:04:28] he said
[2:04:30] repent
[2:04:33] and be baptized
[2:04:36] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:04:39] and you shall receive
[2:04:41] this holy ghost promise
[2:04:44] it'll take you into a relationship with
[2:04:46] the father
[2:04:48] okay
[2:04:49] it'll take you to the capstone of your
[2:04:51] promised perfection
[2:04:55] can you say is perfection attainable
[2:04:59] it is
[2:05:01] because perfection of the bible
[2:05:04] the definition for that word
[2:05:07] isn't found in a dictionary either
[2:05:10] it's it's not there
[2:05:14] turn with me real quick and i read it to
[2:05:16] the young people yesterday
[2:05:18] to matthew 5 48.
[2:05:32] it's the last verse there's 48 verses in
[2:05:35] this chapter
[2:05:36] it's the very last one
[2:05:39] be ye therefore perfect
[2:05:41] even as your father which is in heaven
[2:05:43] is perfect
[2:05:45] as i shared with the young people last
[2:05:46] night and
[2:05:48] that
[2:05:49] matthew 5 6 and 7
[2:05:52] is jesus speaking
[2:05:54] on perfection
[2:05:56] giving us the steps
[2:05:58] to get to the capstone of our life
[2:06:02] he said be ye therefore perfect
[2:06:06] even as your father which is in heaven
[2:06:08] is perfect
[2:06:10] you know why he said why he put the
[2:06:13] biggie therefore
[2:06:18] because of the 47 verses prior
[2:06:24] he said did you catch it
[2:06:26] i just preached 47 verses on perfection
[2:06:29] for you on adoption
[2:06:32] on justification by faith and can and
[2:06:35] sanctification by the spirit and the
[2:06:37] baptism holy ghost bringing you to
[2:06:39] prefection like the father himself
[2:06:42] eternal in the heavens above
[2:06:46] amen so if you want to know how to get
[2:06:48] there
[2:06:49] follow the steps
[2:06:52] go back to verse 1
[2:06:54] and verse 2 and 3 and 4 and 20 and 30
[2:06:58] and 47
[2:07:00] then you'll know
[2:07:03] that he spoke it in a parable amen
[2:07:06] and a simple thought
[2:07:08] and a simple conclusion to what he was
[2:07:10] saying
[2:07:11] be therefore perfect
[2:07:15] because of the 47 verses
[2:07:18] because what i do because of what i just
[2:07:19] finished ministering to you he says
[2:07:23] it will bring you to perfection
[2:07:27] but i wasn't listening
[2:07:31] and peter said
[2:07:33] just go back
[2:07:34] and read it again
[2:07:38] read it
[2:07:39] until you see christ in every verse
[2:07:48] so the purpose of this parable
[2:07:51] is have i received the holy ghost
[2:07:54] since i believed
[2:07:56] and how long has it been
[2:07:58] since i received the refilling
[2:08:01] of that blessed holy
[2:08:07] it spirit everyone i could ask
[2:08:10] have you received the holy ghost and to
[2:08:11] believe
[2:08:12] got it brother daniel no worries there
[2:08:15] i'm good
[2:08:18] then i say that's wonderful
[2:08:20] when's the last time
[2:08:23] that you can put your finger on the day
[2:08:24] and the time
[2:08:26] and say you had a refilling of the
[2:08:27] spirit
[2:08:31] amen
[2:08:33] first corinthians 1 and verse 23
[2:08:39] but we preach christ crucified
[2:08:41] unto the jews
[2:08:43] a stumbling block
[2:08:45] unto the greeks
[2:08:47] foolishness
[2:08:49] but unto them which are called both jews
[2:08:51] and greeks
[2:08:53] christ the power of god and the wisdom
[2:08:56] of god
[2:08:57] because the foolishness of god
[2:09:00] is wiser than men
[2:09:02] and the weakness of god is stronger than
[2:09:04] men
[2:09:07] romans 1 3
[2:09:10] concerning his son jesus christ our lord
[2:09:13] which was made of the seed of david
[2:09:15] according to the flesh
[2:09:18] and declared to be the son of claude
[2:09:20] with power according to the spirit of
[2:09:21] holiness
[2:09:22] by the resurrection
[2:09:24] from the dead
[2:09:27] justification by faith
[2:09:31] sanctification by the spirit
[2:09:34] the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:09:37] a friendship restored with the father
[2:09:40] as adam had needed
[2:09:42] what is that baptism of the holy ghost
[2:09:45] the father standing at the throne of
[2:09:47] your heart
[2:09:49] as a watchman guarding the city
[2:09:51] you then come
[2:09:53] to the greatest battles ever fought
[2:09:56] but you're not alone now
[2:09:58] you've got a friend in jesus
[2:10:00] and he has become the author
[2:10:03] and finisher of your faith
[2:10:08] and every victory he gives you
[2:10:11] that's a
[2:10:12] revealing yes
[2:10:14] every trial you go through
[2:10:16] and you rise above it
[2:10:18] that's a refilling
[2:10:26] how many would like more than one in a
[2:10:27] day or is one good enough
[2:10:34] the watchman guide in your steps into
[2:10:36] perfection
[2:10:38] a son and daughter being adopted by the
[2:10:40] father
[2:10:42] peter adds more details to this
[2:10:44] born-again experience
[2:10:46] unto perfection he adds more details to
[2:10:48] what jesus preached
[2:10:51] on perfection
[2:10:52] in matthew 5 6 and 7.
[2:10:56] even even david in the psalm speaks of
[2:10:59] it
[2:10:59] psalms 23
[2:11:01] he says the lord
[2:11:03] is my shepherd
[2:11:05] i shall not want
[2:11:07] he's talking about a walk but not
[2:11:10] walking alone
[2:11:13] he maketh me to lie down in green
[2:11:15] pastures
[2:11:17] justified by faith
[2:11:19] he liveth me besides the still waters
[2:11:22] sanctified by the spirit
[2:11:25] he restoreth my soul born again
[2:11:29] he leads me in the paths of
[2:11:30] righteousness for his namesake adoption
[2:11:33] has begun
[2:11:35] amen
[2:11:36] yea though i walk through the valley of
[2:11:39] the shadow of death i'll feel i will
[2:11:42] fear no evil
[2:11:44] our greatest battles
[2:11:46] ever fought amen for thou art with me
[2:11:49] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[2:11:53] you've now got
[2:11:55] a friend
[2:11:56] in jesus name
[2:12:00] thou prepares a table before me
[2:12:03] in the presence of mine enemies the end
[2:12:06] time message once again in parables
[2:12:09] thou anoint is my head with oil my cup
[2:12:12] runneth over
[2:12:14] the parables revealed to our hearts
[2:12:16] bringing refilling
[2:12:18] after refilling
[2:12:20] of this holy spirit
[2:12:23] verse 6
[2:12:24] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[2:12:26] me
[2:12:27] all the days of my life tonight will
[2:12:30] dwell in the house of the lord forever
[2:12:34] psalms 23
[2:12:37] our christian walk amen
[2:12:40] from being poor in spirit
[2:12:42] to the capsule of perfection amen
[2:12:45] in six verses no doubt
[2:12:50] if i could do that we'd have been done
[2:12:52] an hour ago
[2:12:54] but i can
[2:12:56] i'm not him
[2:12:58] but he's here
[2:13:01] this is the house god wants you to build
[2:13:04] but what house
[2:13:05] will you build him
[2:13:07] what house will i build them
[2:13:10] i say together
[2:13:12] let's build him a house that he'll be
[2:13:14] pleased to dwell
[2:13:18] many years ago
[2:13:21] the lord gave me a poem
[2:13:23] i'd like to share it with you at this
[2:13:24] time in closing the
[2:13:27] song leader would like to prepare
[2:13:28] musicians

[2:13:57] i sit down
[2:13:58] i pick up my pen
[2:14:01] and just something struck me
[2:14:02] and i begin writing

[2:14:33] bride and groom reside
[2:14:36] i know it's the best way
[2:14:38] and yet i try at last
[2:14:41] only to be defeated
[2:14:43] by satan's ugly blast
[2:14:46] i dedicate myself again
[2:14:48] to the prayer closet with my friend
[2:14:51] who listens so attently to every word i
[2:14:55] say
[2:14:56] but when i listen quietly

[2:15:04] to hear him say

[2:18:16] [Music]
[2:18:28] you know as brother daniel was preaching
[2:18:30] i just had a thought and i thought well
[2:18:32] i'll just put it
[2:18:33] to the side but just felt once again
[2:18:36] just to to speak of this
[2:18:39] some time ago i was in a situation where
[2:18:42] a minister
[2:18:44] sat me down and he said you know paul i
[2:18:46] just want to explain to you why our
[2:18:47] church
[2:18:49] preaches what it preaches and and why we
[2:18:52] are we're doing it in the fashion that
[2:18:54] we do
[2:18:56] and saints it broke my heart because he
[2:18:58] then proceeded to explain to me why
[2:19:02] they have softened the message
[2:19:05] trying to reach out
[2:19:07] to the foolish virgin
[2:19:12] we just heard it tonight
[2:19:14] saints i'm here to tell you tonight
[2:19:17] we're
[2:19:17] we're preaching this gospel and yes the
[2:19:19] foolish virgin might hear it but we're
[2:19:21] not preaching this
[2:19:23] for the foolish virgin we're preaching
[2:19:25] this for the wise virgin we're preaching
[2:19:27] it for the one who wants to be in the
[2:19:29] comma
[2:19:31] and satan would have to then search and
[2:19:33] try and find you but can't find you
[2:19:35] we're not we're not going to water this
[2:19:37] down to make you feel comfortable
[2:19:42] so that you can
[2:19:43] extend your time on earth
[2:19:45] i want out of here
[2:19:47] i want out of here and i want the word
[2:19:49] to change me
[2:19:51] because you see if there's no oil
[2:19:53] there's no fire and if there's no fire
[2:19:55] we're lukewarm
[2:19:57] lord fill us
[2:19:59] fill us lord don't don't let us just
[2:20:01] come along and say we have such a
[2:20:03] comfortable life we have such a
[2:20:04] comfortable church experience
[2:20:07] but fill us lord
[2:20:08] that the wick can remain
[2:20:11] lit
[2:20:12] can we say tonight god's lit our wick
[2:20:14] amen
[2:20:15] he lit it and if god put out the effort
[2:20:18] to light the wick for you and i
[2:20:21] he intends for you and i
[2:20:24] to keep it lit
[2:20:27] in other words we're actually rejecting
[2:20:29] a little bit of what god has for us
[2:20:32] when we run out of oil
[2:20:35] we're actually saying you know what lord
[2:20:37] you didn't understand my circumstance
[2:20:39] you didn't understand my need
[2:20:42] but he does
[2:20:45] he does because that lamb
[2:20:48] that lamb said i'm going to give you the
[2:20:50] example of what i i want you to see
[2:20:53] and i'm going to give myself before you
[2:20:55] ever come into a physical manifestation
[2:20:57] i'm going to give myself for you
[2:21:00] and on calvary he said it is finished
[2:21:03] this work is finished saints can we say
[2:21:05] amen thank you lord so that this work is
[2:21:09] finished amen i'd like to sing that song

[2:25:08] what a friend we have in jesus
[2:25:15] [Music]
[2:25:24] foreign
[2:25:55] is
[2:25:56] [Music]
[2:26:38] foreign
[2:26:44] [Music]
[2:27:10] yes
[2:27:21] is
[2:27:33] is
[2:28:02] oh
[2:28:12] oh
[2:28:23] [Music]
[2:28:50] [Applause]
[2:28:57] is
[2:28:59] [Music]
[2:29:08] is
[2:29:25] i don't know if this would make sense to
[2:29:27] you but his brother daniel was preaching
[2:29:30] i'm just thinking about that song
[2:29:34] i got trials
[2:29:37] i've got temptations
[2:29:39] i've got struggles
[2:29:41] i've got things i have carried so long
[2:29:44] that they become common
[2:29:47] and we no longer even pray about
[2:29:49] deliverance from them or a change coming
[2:29:52] in our life because we just think this
[2:29:54] is the status quo
[2:29:59] but when we start to take it in prayer
[2:30:01] you realize that actually is more of a
[2:30:03] revelation than we realize
[2:30:05] i've got a burden what's my answer
[2:30:07] prayer
[2:30:08] i've got a circumstance what's my answer
[2:30:10] prayer
[2:30:12] i don't know what's wrong with my family
[2:30:14] prayer
[2:30:16] whatever it is prayer
[2:30:18] amen but sometimes even then our prayers
[2:30:21] don't seem to do it
[2:30:23] so then i hope you don't mind and can
[2:30:25] follow me
[2:30:26] then god steps in and says this is my
[2:30:28] son this is my daughter i called them
[2:30:31] i've made the way for them i paid the
[2:30:33] price
[2:30:34] and so i'll just have to send down the
[2:30:36] holy ghost and fire
[2:30:38] and i'll keep them alive i'll keep
[2:30:40] reviving them with the holy ghost and
[2:30:43] with fire amen and as we was brother
[2:30:46] daniel was preaching i got a whole
[2:30:48] sermon i could preach to you tonight
[2:30:49] here but as he was preaching i thought
[2:30:51] that's right and when we get down to an
[2:30:54] ebb where we can't seem to make it
[2:30:55] ourself
[2:30:57] god sends down another blast as it were
[2:31:00] of the holy ghost
[2:31:02] and revives us again
[2:31:04] thank you lord amen i want to sing that
[2:31:06] tonight i hope you don't think we're
[2:31:08] shifting gears too fast or too far but
[2:31:11] we just realized it's the holy ghost god
[2:31:13] coming down only reason i'm here tonight
[2:31:16] holy ghost
[2:31:17] only reason i have victory in my life
[2:31:19] the holy ghost amen only reason i have a
[2:31:21] testimony tonight is the holy ghost amen
[2:31:25] otherwise they'd say who are you and
[2:31:26] what are you and i'd say i'm just a
[2:31:29] sinner amen i have no hope but amen i'm
[2:31:32] a sinner saved by grace and filled with
[2:31:34] the holy ghost
[2:31:36] well it's that holy ghost
[2:31:39] [Music]
[2:31:45] oh
[2:31:47] [Music]
[2:32:09] bubbling up inside well it's all over me
[2:32:14] and it's bubbling up inside
[2:32:17] oh jesus is keeping me alive

[2:32:38] alive
[2:32:39] my jesus is keeping me alive
[2:32:44] oh i prayed it down from heaven and it's
[2:32:48] keeping me alive
[2:32:50] or keeping me alive yes he's keeping me
[2:32:55] alive
[2:32:56] i prayed it down from heaven and it's
[2:32:59] keeping me alive
[2:33:02] oh jesus is keeping me alive
[2:33:07] well he's all over me
[2:33:10] and it's bubbling up inside he's all
[2:33:14] inside all bubbling up inside well it's
[2:33:19] all over me
[2:33:21] and it bubbling up inside my jesus is
[2:33:26] keeping me alive
[2:33:29] well it sanctified me holy and it's
[2:33:33] keeping me alive
[2:33:35] or keeping me alive oh he's keeping me
[2:33:40] alive
[2:33:41] it sanctifies me holy and it's keeping
[2:33:45] me alive
[2:33:46] my jesus
[2:33:48] is keeping me alive
[2:33:52] well i prayed it down from heaven and
[2:33:55] it's keeping me alive
[2:33:58] all keeping me alive
[2:34:00] it's keeping me alive well i prayed it
[2:34:04] down from heaven and it's keeping me
[2:34:08] alive
[2:34:09] oh jesus is keeping me alive
[2:34:13] can we just praise the lord tonight
[2:34:16] [Music]
[2:34:23] [Applause]
[2:34:25] now i might have a little issue with
[2:34:26] that song actually
[2:34:28] if y'all don't mind
[2:34:30] because you see
[2:34:33] i didn't have to pray it down from
[2:34:34] heaven he's in me
[2:34:36] amen we're not trying to draw something
[2:34:39] he came to us
[2:34:41] amen and he's in us and he's walking
[2:34:45] with us amen so i guess i have a little
[2:34:48] issue brother daniel with that because i
[2:34:50] don't know in my weakest hour when i
[2:34:52] probably couldn't have prayed anything
[2:34:54] anywhere he came amen aren't you glad
[2:34:56] tonight now you know what
[2:34:59] just one last song
[2:35:01] amen
[2:35:02] brother daniel touched on it didn't
[2:35:04] really elaborate it
[2:35:06] what was this producing
[2:35:10] an old testament church
[2:35:13] was it producing
[2:35:15] someone still bound
[2:35:17] no sir
[2:35:19] this word loosed
[2:35:21] a new testament church
[2:35:23] brother daniel put it this way he says
[2:35:24] he's taking us back
[2:35:26] to where the first adam was is where
[2:35:29] we've been restored back to
[2:35:31] hallelujah not a new church
[2:35:34] it's not as the prophet puts it it's not
[2:35:36] a new book of acts it is a continuation
[2:35:41] i say thank you lord that i could be a
[2:35:43] continuation amen
[2:35:46] you know you look at this my brother and
[2:35:47] sister i love this because
[2:35:50] this
[2:35:51] quote that i just read i think it was
[2:35:54] yesterday
[2:35:56] brother branham says it was the
[2:35:57] traditions of men
[2:36:00] that kept the word
[2:36:02] from delivering the people
[2:36:05] it wasn't the failure of the word
[2:36:08] it was the tradition of man we bound the
[2:36:10] word to make it fit us
[2:36:13] but the word is making us fit christ
[2:36:17] aren't you glad
[2:36:19] well as i look out across the land
