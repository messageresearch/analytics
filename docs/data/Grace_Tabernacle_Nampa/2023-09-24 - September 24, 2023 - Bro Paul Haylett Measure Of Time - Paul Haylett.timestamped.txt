[34:02] Hallelujah can we say this morning it is
[34:04] good to be Sons and Daughters of God
[34:07] Hallelujah so good to see each and every
[34:10] one of you today amen and uh
[34:13] to greet our guests amen God bless you
[34:17] and uh you know it's just uh
[34:21] it's just wonderful the many things that
[34:23] God is doing in the bride today and
[34:26] we're seeing the word unfolded you know
[34:29] my brother and sister just uh maybe a
[34:32] poor analogy but if you just take what
[34:34] is the front page of the newspaper
[34:37] that is not the news that's right
[34:42] that is sensationalism what they're
[34:45] trying to draw you to that's why the
[34:49] prophet of God told us that we have to
[34:51] come and look between the lines and look
[34:54] in the letter and not just take what it
[34:56] is the the superficially upfront but to
[35:01] dig into the word of God and
[35:04] the good news there's the Gospel of
[35:07] Jesus Christ everybody wants to just use
[35:10] John 16 and make it a poster child but
[35:13] my brother and sister they're so much
[35:15] more amen but we've got to dig into it
[35:19] and we've got to find the content of the
[35:22] word for our hour and I just want to say
[35:24] God bless you to each and every one this
[35:28] day amen for those that are not with us
[35:31] which reminds me our sister April I know
[35:34] Sister Jerry and I are probably not in
[35:36] the loop and there will be those of you
[35:38] who do know but I believe maybe she's
[35:40] already went off to a wedding in far off
[35:43] lands not yet
[35:45] not yet
[35:46] okay see how much I'm out of the news
[35:48] amen but anyway remember Sister April uh
[35:52] you know I I thought I had a busy life
[35:54] but um anyway we just want to remember
[35:58] amen I want to greet our sister Rachel
[36:01] our brother Joan amen uh just uh such a
[36:05] joy part good it was a lot of years ago
[36:08] I don't know if they even remember but
[36:10] when I first met them they were just
[36:12] young children amen and uh it might even
[36:16] have been jobed that was underneath the
[36:17] chairs in the church wasn't born yet
[36:19] okay
[36:20] but I I just remember that some of the
[36:23] family you know uh they're in Sandpoint
[36:25] were pushing their little trucks and you
[36:27] know how little kids are they're there
[36:29] in church with their little truck
[36:30] underneath the chairs
[36:33] but you know God still comes God still
[36:36] moves right because he knows the heart
[36:38] of a child amen but to always feel such
[36:41] a kindred spirit with them and just pray
[36:43] that you take greetings back to the
[36:45] family amen
[36:47] and um
[36:49] just uh let's see uh
[36:52] brother Stan sister Merlene I've had a
[36:55] wonderful time in the Philippines
[36:56] brother Stan sent a personal note to us
[36:59] to thank us for the prayers that uh it's
[37:02] it's kind of a deep
[37:04] story in a way but God just give him a
[37:07] confidence that you know as he got older
[37:09] here he just kind of felt like maybe he
[37:12] wasn't effective anymore but I'm telling
[37:14] you my brother and sister until the day
[37:16] God takes us home every one of us is
[37:19] effective amen we're making a difference
[37:22] in the lives around us and amen just
[37:25] like brother Bob and sister Joanne if
[37:27] nothing else are not here in church not
[37:29] here with the amens not here with the
[37:31] interactions and the God bless you's and
[37:33] I love you but I just look at their life
[37:35] and we were discussing that just a
[37:37] moment young adults my brother and
[37:39] sister they've been serving God longer
[37:41] than most of us have been alive
[37:44] and never faltered never failed have had
[37:47] trials oh my have they had trials
[37:50] they've had struggles amen you know
[37:53] Sister Joanne once collapsing on the bed
[37:55] we believe that she actually was dead
[37:57] and brother Bob just under the anointing
[38:00] of the word says if I lay hands on her
[38:03] and call out in the name of Jesus Christ
[38:06] he promised he would come on the scene
[38:08] amen God give us confidence God give us
[38:12] strength to stand on that and say I
[38:14] believe your word Lord you said it it
[38:18] will come to pass and so we're thankful
[38:20] for all of these things amen God bless
[38:22] you brother Alex I enjoyed the song
[38:24] service he could have just read a
[38:26] scripture and kind of covered my thought
[38:29] amen and musicians I I thank the Lord
[38:33] were blessed amen
[38:36] so as we look at this I would just like
[38:38] to speak to you today on
[38:41] measure of time
[38:43] and as we'll look at this my brother and
[38:46] sister we we know that the word of God
[38:49] tells us we've been allotted a certain
[38:51] amount of time on the earth we've been
[38:54] allotted
[38:55] um uh certain days and while the word
[38:58] promises us basically 70 years some will
[39:01] receive more some less but we realize
[39:04] it's not about how we view it and I have
[39:07] as a little subtitle not really a title
[39:09] but just as something to provoke your
[39:10] thought our view
[39:13] God's view
[39:14] you know I mean our view of time is my
[39:17] you know time is in Swift transition I
[39:20] need to be afraid no you need to be
[39:22] happy look up and rejoice your
[39:25] Redemption is that much closer to you
[39:28] amen
[39:30] will the government's collapse well I
[39:32] don't know the prophet had a vision my
[39:33] brother and sister he said it was
[39:35] America and it was craters and Smoke and
[39:38] Ashes
[39:39] that should terrify us except for the
[39:43] word showed us we're not here
[39:45] amen we're not part of that
[39:49] Hallelujah
[39:50] amen so we got to take the measure of
[39:53] time and you might say a point of view
[39:55] what is our point of view versus God's
[39:57] point of view
[39:58] hallelujah amen let's just turn in our
[40:02] Bibles today
[40:04] amen the
[40:07] Book of Psalms the 39th chapter Verses 4
[40:12] through 7.
[40:28] and pray for technology
[40:32] my brother and sister
[40:35] it's interesting
[40:38] how it will come down to a Time
[40:41] the buy-in cell might not be what we
[40:44] think it is
[40:46] have you ever thought about that
[40:48] we think they're going to stand in the
[40:49] marketplace
[40:51] and they're going to say you're not
[40:53] allowed to
[40:56] but God's thoughts are so much greater
[40:58] than our own
[41:00] the world is obsessed now with what do
[41:03] they call them emds
[41:05] isn't that what it is EMTs emds yeah the
[41:09] electromagnetic
[41:11] yeah poof everything Electronics done
[41:17] my brother and sister
[41:19] the world
[41:20] is fixing
[41:22] to collapse
[41:24] man has created his own demise
[41:27] they want to blame God
[41:30] now look this is a little distraction
[41:31] forgive me but in the 60s I had a great
[41:34] earthquake I believe 1964 in Chile the
[41:37] churches were filled with people crying
[41:39] out for God's mercy
[41:41] then they had one in the 70s and the
[41:44] churches were somewhat filled they had
[41:47] one in the 80s and very few people
[41:50] changed they had one in 2010 and the
[41:53] people stood in the streets and cursed
[41:56] God
[41:57] we're seeing a decline
[42:00] it's going to happen
[42:03] but something else is going to happen
[42:05] amen there's a bride hearing a word
[42:09] she's hearing a trumpet sounding she's
[42:12] she's hearing a voice
[42:14] and in that voice she's heard something
[42:16] that says this world is not my home I'm
[42:19] not happy in this world and if we're not
[42:21] happy in this world then get in Christ
[42:24] let him become our world
[42:27] Hallelujah Lord make me to know mine end
[42:30] can we say Amen to that I want to know
[42:33] what my end is and the measure of my
[42:36] days what it is that I may know how
[42:40] frail
[42:41] I am
[42:42] oh my behold thou Hast made my days as a
[42:47] hand breath
[42:48] and my age is as nothing before thee
[42:52] verily every man at his best state is
[42:56] altogether vanity
[42:59] Silo can we say Amen to the word at our
[43:02] best state we're just vanity
[43:07] amen oh if my life was just different
[43:11] if my life was this if my life was that
[43:13] my brother and sister that's your best
[43:16] state is just vanity
[43:21] surely every man walketh in a vain show
[43:25] surely they are disquieted in vain he
[43:29] hepeth up riches and knoweth not Who
[43:32] Shall Gather them
[43:36] my
[43:38] and now Lord
[43:39] what a what wait I for
[43:43] My Hope
[43:44] is in thee
[43:47] the only hope we have
[43:52] Heavenly Father we ask you to come
[43:56] father you know the needs of every life
[43:58] every heart
[44:00] father you know that we have no remedy
[44:03] we were called to preach the gospel The
[44:05] unfailing Riches of our Lord Jesus
[44:07] Christ we were called to stand for truth
[44:10] to preach truth to live truth manifest
[44:14] truth father let us fulfill our portion
[44:17] of this great calling father speak to us
[44:20] today Lord let the word ring true may it
[44:23] go deep in the hearts of those with
[44:25] needs in their lives father I I on
[44:29] purposely father don't try to dig into
[44:31] people's lives unless they choose to
[44:33] share it because father I don't want to
[44:36] preach a tainted gospel a Prejudice
[44:38] gospel a a gospel disappointed to
[44:41] someone but father I believe if we just
[44:44] preach the truth it will find its
[44:47] resting place we preach the truth and it
[44:50] will bring deliverance we preach truth
[44:53] Lord and it will bring healing and
[44:55] deliverance
[44:56] let the truth go forth I pray today in
[44:59] the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen
[45:04] you may be seated Saints
[45:08] as we speak today on the measure of time
[45:11] we've been preaching about The Measure
[45:13] of Faith the measure of Grace
[45:16] my brother and sister we also have to
[45:18] quantify or put this in that of the
[45:21] gifts that God has given he has given us
[45:23] a measure of time now it is not we often
[45:28] hear in in the human vocabulary they
[45:31] will be someone maybe in their 30s 40s
[45:33] 50s pass away and they will say oh he he
[45:37] went before his time but my brother and
[45:40] sister if we believe God is a sovereign
[45:42] God then we would recognize that their
[45:45] time was not appointed by circumstance
[45:48] whether a car accident or a plane crash
[45:50] or this or that or a heart attack but it
[45:53] is appointed by God and not man amen and
[45:56] so it's there that we have confidence
[45:58] today that we live walk in the perfect
[46:00] will of God and I trust we can also say
[46:03] Amen to that too my God doesn't make a
[46:06] mistake because if he made one mistake
[46:08] my brother and sister how could I trust
[46:10] him with everything in my life how could
[46:13] you trust him if you were questioning
[46:15] everything is this right or is this just
[46:19] a mistake but we believe with all of our
[46:22] heart that it is the word of God and so
[46:25] it's not how many days we have but I
[46:27] want to ask you today what are you doing
[46:29] with the days God has granted to you if
[46:33] God has given you these days to manifest
[46:35] the word of God and to bring praise
[46:38] honor and Glory unto him are we
[46:40] fulfilling what we are called to do are
[46:43] we fulfilling the very uh manifestation
[46:46] of the word that has been placed in us
[46:49] and I say my brother and sister you'll
[46:51] find in the world today that a man can
[46:54] be granted a full life of 70 years or so
[46:57] and accomplish almost nothing my brother
[47:01] and sister and others would be there in
[47:04] their allotted days doing many things
[47:07] for the gospel reminds me of an a story
[47:10] of some Believers back East there and
[47:12] how as the brother and sister got old
[47:14] they had quite a few children I think 11
[47:17] or 12 children and somebody one day said
[47:21] you know you sure didn't accomplish much
[47:23] in your life you didn't really do much
[47:26] you just always worked a menial job and
[47:29] now that you're old you have nothing not
[47:32] even a house of your own and the man
[47:34] said well I disagree with you I have
[47:37] been blessed beyond measure I believe I
[47:40] have accomplished yes I do not own a
[47:42] home my wife and I live with a family
[47:46] member so with a daughter her husband
[47:49] grandchildren yes that is true but I
[47:52] have raised 12 children to serve God
[47:56] and he viewed his life as success amen
[48:01] because he knew that he had made a
[48:03] difference amen not financially all of
[48:07] his children had to go make their own
[48:09] way in life but he had to live by the
[48:12] grace of God he had lived the word and
[48:14] left something angered in this soul and
[48:16] I would ask you what would be the
[48:18] measure of that man's days
[48:21] I say he was very blessed
[48:25] you know my brother and sister I would
[48:26] say this emphatically yes I want to live
[48:29] life just like you do I'm going to live
[48:31] it to the fullest but I would rather
[48:33] have a few days with the Lord than a
[48:35] hundred years without him
[48:37] and that is what we have to find in our
[48:40] life is how are we looking at the time
[48:43] that God has given us is there as we see
[48:47] in the prophet of God brother Branham
[48:49] says you know I'm 50 years old and if
[48:51] I'm ever going to do anything for the
[48:53] Lord I better get started and you look
[48:56] at his life at 50 years old my brother
[48:58] and sister and all that God had used him
[49:00] for he was not speaking the meaning of
[49:03] himself but he was speaking of an inner
[49:06] desire to do more for God
[49:09] amen and I say God let that desire be
[49:12] expressed in you and I that we would
[49:15] have a desire to do more for the Lord
[49:18] amen when we become satisfied have you
[49:21] ever noticed my brother and sister we
[49:23] become satisfied we're less motivated
[49:28] now there's no absolute direct
[49:30] correlation between those scriptures of
[49:33] the Rich Young Ruler and the man who is
[49:36] there to tear down his barns but I
[49:38] believe everything points to that being
[49:40] the Rich Young Ruler in his future in
[49:43] his maturity and he come to a day and
[49:46] said all of my barns are full all of my
[49:48] crops all of my Acres everything is
[49:50] great I'll just tear it all down and
[49:53] I'll build it up even greater and that
[49:55] was the time God said I call on you his
[49:58] measure of time was finished now my
[50:01] brother and sister I know this is just a
[50:03] pet topic for me I don't say it is
[50:06] Doctrine but I believe it's thought
[50:07] provoking that at the time that Jesus
[50:10] asked him to sell all he had and give to
[50:13] the poor the gift that God gave him was
[50:16] making money
[50:19] are you with me
[50:22] if he'd have started selling everything
[50:24] he had and giving to the poor God would
[50:27] have poured into him greater and greater
[50:31] and greater riches because then he would
[50:34] have surrendered what he had to God and
[50:37] knowing god was in control but what did
[50:39] he do he was afraid to lose what he had
[50:42] and if I sell it all I will become a
[50:45] pauper maybe homeless as they are well I
[50:48] can't do that I'm used to a good life
[50:51] but what he didn't realize is everything
[50:53] we pour out he promised to pour back
[50:56] into us with increase and this is not
[50:59] Prosperity Gospel this is Christ knowing
[51:02] I can trust this vessel I can trust this
[51:05] son this daughter that when I pour into
[51:07] them they don't hoard it they poured it
[51:10] out
[51:11] and there that God is moving in such a
[51:14] fashion that's why we as Sons and
[51:16] Daughters of God should not be ashamed
[51:18] to share this gospel you talk of the
[51:20] blessings of God you pour them out to
[51:22] the clerk in the store you pour them out
[51:24] to the neighbor you pour them out to the
[51:26] homeless and the despised and God will
[51:29] pour it right back into you oh my
[51:31] brother and sister you want to get
[51:33] blessed well you pour it out God will
[51:36] fill it back up and God is not a stingy
[51:39] God Amen he's not going to be there
[51:41] measuring it to the last cent if you
[51:43] were talking money or to the last of
[51:45] your spirit that you would be I poured
[51:48] it out and now I'm empty no my brother
[51:50] and sister they that wait upon the Lord
[51:52] shall have their strength renewed it's a
[51:56] promise of God
[51:57] Hallelujah if we would turn in our
[52:00] Bibles to Proverbs the third chapter
[52:02] verses one through seven
[52:05] amen
[52:11] proverbs 3.
[52:13] amen
[52:15] three and one
[52:17] we might have got that backwards
[52:20] I might have wrote it backwards
[52:22] it might have just happened
[52:24] who knows
[52:25] praise the Lord
[52:27] my son
[52:29] forget not my law
[52:31] I was talking to the young adults this
[52:32] morning you see it all depends on how
[52:34] you look at God when you look at God and
[52:36] you believe it's all judgment I made a
[52:38] mistake I asked the young people this
[52:40] morning you know they're a little shy I
[52:42] think maybe Brother Paul's a little too
[52:44] forward I don't know hopefully we can
[52:46] break them out of that pray that amen we
[52:48] we deliver our young people
[52:51] from there
[52:53] well anyway
[52:58] if we view God as a judgmental God
[53:01] everything about your life you're going
[53:04] to be looking for the equation of
[53:06] judgment in it
[53:07] but when you look at God as a God that
[53:10] says no I'm Desiring Perfection from you
[53:13] I've sent to I've sent a five-fold
[53:15] Ministry amen Ephesians 4 to bring you
[53:18] to Perfection but while you're working
[53:20] toward Perfection I've got more than
[53:22] enough Grace I've got the greatest
[53:24] measure of Grace to pour out upon you to
[53:27] get you to that place but you see if we
[53:30] view the law
[53:32] Jesus said I didn't come to do away with
[53:34] it I come to fulfill it
[53:37] amen
[53:39] change your view if you feel like it's
[53:41] harsh change your view don't ask God to
[53:45] change his laws amen because the law my
[53:49] brother and sister is our deliverance as
[53:51] I express to the young people sorry get
[53:53] sidetracked to this my brother and
[53:55] sister if you don't believe in God's
[53:56] laws and think that he ought to soften
[53:58] it this universe is held together by
[54:01] God's laws amen when he placed the Stars
[54:04] he placed the heavens of the Sun the
[54:05] moon the Earth it's all hung by God's
[54:08] law he declared it and it must come to
[54:11] pass
[54:12] and why is it they can predict a a
[54:14] eclipse 40 years in advance and tell you
[54:18] at this time of 3 41 a.m it will take
[54:22] place and because God's timepiece is so
[54:25] perfect
[54:26] amen it's not chance they didn't use a
[54:29] super computer
[54:30] amen I always thought it was interesting
[54:32] read a story about how that some guy
[54:34] built a team of people MIT I believe it
[54:38] was built a supercomputer and they
[54:40] called it the supernova
[54:42] because there is a supernova amen that
[54:46] is so predictable in its actions
[54:49] reactions to the timing its placement in
[54:52] the heavens
[54:53] that they were actually giving
[54:55] compliment to God
[54:57] that it's perfect on time all the time
[55:01] my brother and sister God is good amen
[55:05] hallelujah for length of days and long
[55:08] life
[55:09] amen that's what most of us strive for
[55:11] is good long life
[55:14] and peace
[55:15] who wants peace
[55:17] I'll tell you what my brother and sister
[55:19] we live in such a chaotic world Amen
[55:22] it's we ought to just be bold enough to
[55:25] stand up and say Lord I live in a
[55:27] chaotic world my mind is in a turmoil I
[55:30] need your peace I don't want to find
[55:33] peace out here I was talking to a lady
[55:36] yesterday that I've known for many years
[55:38] and she was just making a comment about
[55:41] what the world was like and it's just a
[55:43] miracle she's not a raging drunk
[55:47] and I had to agree with her
[55:49] it's just a wonder my brother and sister
[55:51] why because there's a peace beyond our
[55:54] comprehension there's a piece beyond
[55:57] what we can manufacture
[56:00] Hallelujah
[56:01] amen and shall add that's how they add
[56:06] to thee let not mercy and Truth forsake
[56:09] thee bind them
[56:12] are you reading that scripture with me
[56:14] let not mercy and Truth forsake thee
[56:17] bind them amen bind mercy and Truth amen
[56:21] about thy neck and write them upon the
[56:24] table of thine heart
[56:25] and so start thou
[56:28] so shout I'm sorry I'm having a hard
[56:29] time reading here
[56:31] so shalt thou find favor and good
[56:33] understanding in the sight of God and
[56:35] man trust in the Lord with all thine
[56:39] heart
[56:40] that's not all that's left over
[56:44] that's not the portion you haven't given
[56:46] to laodicea
[56:48] that's all of your heart
[56:51] and lean not
[56:53] thine own understanding
[56:56] that's why I always like to be very
[56:58] clear my brother and sister when I talk
[57:00] about things such as the story of the
[57:02] Rich Young Ruler I want you to know
[57:03] clearly I'm not trying to make scripture
[57:06] out of that I'm not trying to make
[57:07] Doctrine out of it it's how I see the
[57:09] word and I want you to know that but I
[57:11] want you to also realize I believe the
[57:13] principles are there to defend it
[57:16] amen the word is not stagnant it is not
[57:19] stale neither is it locked up
[57:22] the book is open
[57:28] trust in the Lord with all thine heart
[57:30] lean not unto thine own understanding in
[57:33] other words have a flexible mind my
[57:35] brother and sister that whatever you
[57:36] believe when the word comes and shows
[57:39] you further Revelation you're willing to
[57:41] take what you believe set it to the side
[57:44] and say I was headed in the right
[57:46] direction but I didn't have the right
[57:48] Vision thank you Lord for the vision to
[57:51] see where you're taking me
[57:53] because otherwise my brother and sister
[57:56] we could be locked into
[57:58] the just shall live by faith
[58:02] and believe that's all there was to the
[58:03] gospel
[58:05] but look how far the word has come
[58:08] right look how far Revelation has
[58:10] brought us Through the Ages
[58:12] we still say Amen to Martin Luther's
[58:15] words my brother and sister his words
[58:17] are worthy of acknowledgment but God has
[58:20] took you much further Hallelujah
[58:26] in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He
[58:29] Shall direct thy Pals be not wise in thy
[58:32] known eyes fear the lord
[58:35] and depart from evil oh my how much that
[58:39] would spare us if we would just come to
[58:41] the point that when evil showed its face
[58:43] on the horizon that we would just depart
[58:45] from that location
[58:46] amen
[58:48] now look my brother and sister because
[58:50] of the Fall
[58:52] you know it's interesting in a human
[58:54] element we would look at the fall and
[58:55] say man Adam Eve you sure did us wrong
[59:01] I could be living in Paradise right now
[59:04] I could I could be you know enjoying
[59:07] life without this struggle
[59:09] except for you
[59:11] but you realize my brother and sister
[59:13] right to the Garden Adam and Eve the
[59:15] serpent all the perfect plan of God you
[59:20] say well it'd been perfect if it hadn't
[59:21] to happen then my brother and sister
[59:23] where would the manifestation of
[59:27] Deliverance come from
[59:29] where would the manifestation of healing
[59:32] come from
[59:33] where would the moving of the Holy
[59:37] Spirit on us have come from
[59:42] well we wouldn't have needed all that
[59:43] brother Paul then God would have not
[59:45] proved he was God
[59:49] build a big enough fence
[59:52] you know brother Brian Jones Mahala
[59:54] Halla there in South Africa
[59:56] you know he has I don't know I guess
[59:59] it's still alive haven't been there for
[1:00:01] a while
[1:00:02] um
[1:00:03] but he had some honey badgers
[1:00:06] and do you know a honey Badger's whole
[1:00:07] goal in life is to get out of wherever
[1:00:09] it's at
[1:00:11] Hallelujah it digs under it climbs over
[1:00:13] they had a beautiful video they set a
[1:00:16] camera up because their honey badger
[1:00:17] kept what's the name of that thing
[1:00:19] I can't remember but anyway that little
[1:00:21] thing was constantly out
[1:00:23] and you know to create an environment
[1:00:26] that that honey badger would feel kind
[1:00:28] of home in the woods they had throwed
[1:00:30] these sticks and different things into
[1:00:32] the pin with a honey badger and on video
[1:00:34] you see the honey badger coming over
[1:00:36] there and pushing and pushing and
[1:00:38] pushing and he manages uh by sheer
[1:00:43] determination that's right to stand the
[1:00:45] stick up but it's in the middle of the
[1:00:47] wall he's halfway up it slides down the
[1:00:49] wall it falls he figures out if I stand
[1:00:51] this stick in the corner it's not going
[1:00:53] anywhere and he climbed right up and
[1:00:55] he's out and gone amen so they
[1:00:57] eliminated all the sticks or hooked him
[1:00:58] to the ground and then they go one day
[1:01:01] and the camera it just picks up the edge
[1:01:03] of it you see some dirt flying and the
[1:01:05] honey badger has dug a three foot deep
[1:01:07] hole under the wall and is free
[1:01:10] amen I'm telling you there's nothing
[1:01:13] keeping Mr honey badger in that cage and
[1:01:17] there is nothing going to keep the Bride
[1:01:19] of Jesus Christ locked up in laodicea on
[1:01:24] this Earth subject to Satan and his cage
[1:01:27] amen if we can't as it were go over it
[1:01:31] we'll go under it we'll go through it or
[1:01:34] we'll fly right out of it amen why
[1:01:37] because we're Eagles we're not meant to
[1:01:40] be caged we're not meant to be kept here
[1:01:42] but we were called into the heavenlies
[1:01:46] Hallelujah and I say my brother and
[1:01:49] sister because of the Fall we must labor
[1:01:52] that was a curse we must labor
[1:01:55] physical
[1:01:56] we all understand that physical
[1:02:01] you know sometimes sorry to put it this
[1:02:04] way Brothers but I think well these
[1:02:06] brothers that got these office jobs and
[1:02:08] computer jobs they just man they've got
[1:02:10] it made in the shade they don't know
[1:02:12] what it's like to donate blood and to
[1:02:14] stretch and to bruise into this and that
[1:02:17] and work long hours until I sat down at
[1:02:19] a computer trying to do something and
[1:02:21] then I'm like I'll just go back give me
[1:02:23] a shovel
[1:02:25] you see every one of us been equipped
[1:02:27] for what we've been called to
[1:02:29] you I want to Anchor that in your
[1:02:31] thoughts this morning we have been
[1:02:33] equipped what we've been called to we're
[1:02:37] not here ill-equipped or unequipped or
[1:02:40] unable but we are more than able through
[1:02:43] Jesus Christ he made us to be what he
[1:02:46] wants us to be
[1:02:47] Hallelujah so physical or spiritual this
[1:02:50] struggle is real
[1:02:52] but my brother and sister here's where
[1:02:54] Satan gets us he presents himself as the
[1:02:58] strong one
[1:03:02] he come to Jesus
[1:03:04] look at all the kingdoms of the Earth
[1:03:07] if you will fall down and serve me
[1:03:10] worship me
[1:03:12] I'll give all this to you was he lying
[1:03:15] no he was telling the truth he didn't
[1:03:18] tell all the truth
[1:03:19] all the truth was is he actually only
[1:03:22] had a lease
[1:03:26] not ownership
[1:03:28] Elise
[1:03:30] and his lease every single day is
[1:03:34] ticking ticking ticking until the point
[1:03:37] it expires
[1:03:39] Hallelujah so what are we going to do do
[1:03:42] we just have to exist and say well we'll
[1:03:44] just hopefully Lord survive long enough
[1:03:46] for the least to run out no my brother
[1:03:48] and sister
[1:03:49] amen he presents himself as powerful and
[1:03:53] it's influential in our daily lives can
[1:03:55] we we can admit that right it's not
[1:03:57] unspiritual to admit that Satan has
[1:03:59] influence in our daily life
[1:04:05] you know on on social media they call
[1:04:07] them influencers
[1:04:09] and I looked at that their social media
[1:04:12] influences or something like that you
[1:04:14] look at that and oh my
[1:04:17] I hope that I hope I'm don't sound
[1:04:20] sacrilegious
[1:04:21] but I wonder who they're influencing
[1:04:24] when you've got this young lady who's
[1:04:25] barely clothed with eyelashes
[1:04:31] and if you do this and this
[1:04:34] you can be
[1:04:36] like me
[1:04:38] not click
[1:04:39] yeah don't want to don't want to go
[1:04:41] there
[1:04:42] that's not who I am
[1:04:44] then you got the guy
[1:04:46] praise God I
[1:04:47] have a money stream by investing and I
[1:04:49] did this and I did that and there he is
[1:04:51] all muscular little Trunks and Tennis
[1:04:54] Shoes
[1:04:55] gives me time to be in the gym
[1:04:59] and if you sign up to my program
[1:05:02] you can end up like
[1:05:04] me
[1:05:07] no sorry not interested
[1:05:11] but the real influencer
[1:05:14] comes
[1:05:15] and says
[1:05:17] I laid my life down for you
[1:05:20] I paid a price
[1:05:22] so that you can be like me
[1:05:26] and something in my heart says yes Lord
[1:05:30] that's what I want to be I want to be
[1:05:32] just like you Lord
[1:05:36] he laid his life down
[1:05:38] we'll have to lay ours down
[1:05:40] we'll have to decide that what we think
[1:05:43] is happiness is not happiness if he's
[1:05:45] not in the picture
[1:05:47] amen what we think is prosperity it's
[1:05:49] not Prosperity unless he's in the
[1:05:51] picture
[1:05:53] and when he's in the picture
[1:05:55] oh how beautiful it is
[1:06:00] Hallelujah this influence in our daily
[1:06:02] lives
[1:06:03] you know what happens
[1:06:05] it's one of the things
[1:06:09] it can be a two-edged sword I have quite
[1:06:10] a vivid imagination the devil knows how
[1:06:12] to use it against you sister Jerry
[1:06:14] shared a little deal to me the other day
[1:06:16] and it was just spot on you see Satan
[1:06:19] can use every aspect of your life
[1:06:22] against you
[1:06:24] I'm a strong determined person the devil
[1:06:27] anoints it and it becomes stubbornness
[1:06:31] I have a great imagination the
[1:06:33] imagination will take you in places you
[1:06:34] should never go
[1:06:37] I have this Satan will use it I have
[1:06:40] that Satan will use it
[1:06:42] but when we yield it to Christ
[1:06:44] when we give it up it's no longer ours
[1:06:47] any longer my imagination is not my
[1:06:50] imagination God gave me an understanding
[1:06:52] to look at things and see it in a
[1:06:54] certain way and I say Lord let me commit
[1:06:56] that to you then it's not there for
[1:06:59] Satan to use against me but it's for you
[1:07:01] Lord to use to bless me
[1:07:04] amen so you look at this my brother and
[1:07:06] sister because if we're not careful
[1:07:08] Satan will come and dominate our
[1:07:12] thoughts
[1:07:14] but the prophet already gave us a
[1:07:15] warning says you know what the greatest
[1:07:17] battle you will ever fight
[1:07:20] will be right here it won't be with a
[1:07:23] sword in your hand it won't be with a
[1:07:25] spear or a gun or a cannon and a rocket
[1:07:27] my brother and sister it's not a balm
[1:07:29] that we can drop there's not a gospel
[1:07:31] balm to blow them out of there my
[1:07:34] brother and sister God says you're going
[1:07:35] to come and you're going to fight this
[1:07:37] battle and you're going to overcome in
[1:07:39] this battle right here and I'm gonna
[1:07:41] anoint you to be the Overcomer so give
[1:07:44] me your talent give me your ability give
[1:07:47] me your thoughts give me your
[1:07:48] imagination give it to me and I'll use
[1:07:51] it
[1:07:52] and you will be blessed buy it who wants
[1:07:57] to be blessed today
[1:07:58] I say Lord I want to be blessed I'm not
[1:08:01] ashamed my brother and sister not
[1:08:03] bashful to say Lord I want you to bless
[1:08:05] me but that doesn't mean more land more
[1:08:07] houses more cars mirror this or that it
[1:08:10] means I want more of Jesus Christ that's
[1:08:13] the real blessing for a son or daughter
[1:08:14] of God
[1:08:16] now I'll tell you this morning I'm
[1:08:18] selling kind of stride in teme
[1:08:20] it's not that I I mean to present it
[1:08:23] that way but there's just something been
[1:08:24] bubbling up inside of me Brother David
[1:08:27] hid on the edges of it Wednesday night
[1:08:28] and I you know you got to be careful
[1:08:30] that you're not there saying hold back
[1:08:32] now hold back buddy don't go there
[1:08:36] or to realize God's got continuity in
[1:08:38] thought
[1:08:39] continuity and song service he's got
[1:08:41] continuity in the scriptures we read and
[1:08:44] the desires of our heart God's got
[1:08:46] continuity my brother and sister now
[1:08:48] look at this as Adam and Eve isn't this
[1:08:51] lovely I love this portion the story
[1:08:54] gets kind of rough hits a few bumps
[1:08:57] in the cool of the evening
[1:09:01] Adam and Eve are walking through the
[1:09:03] garden
[1:09:05] and you see how it was my brother and
[1:09:07] sister they just walked
[1:09:10] they didn't go into the garden and say
[1:09:12] God are you here
[1:09:16] where are you God
[1:09:18] I don't see you
[1:09:20] I don't feel you
[1:09:22] where are you gone
[1:09:25] we've done that though haven't we
[1:09:28] wondered where is God
[1:09:32] oh but look my brother and sister
[1:09:36] Adam and Eve just walking in the cool of
[1:09:38] the evening through the garden
[1:09:40] and just as it was
[1:09:43] on the road
[1:09:45] to Emmaus
[1:09:47] he just would appear
[1:09:50] and he would walk with them amen oh how
[1:09:53] joyous
[1:09:55] how beautiful how present
[1:09:58] just moves my heart to think how it
[1:10:00] would be
[1:10:04] but then the fall came
[1:10:07] they're ushered
[1:10:10] out the gate
[1:10:12] and the angels are given commission
[1:10:14] don't let them return
[1:10:20] now that was only to the garden
[1:10:23] was not to return back to the presence
[1:10:25] of God
[1:10:26] but now they had to approach God
[1:10:28] differently
[1:10:29] do you see the transition that took
[1:10:31] place in the garden
[1:10:32] no longer was just walking through the
[1:10:34] garden enough to attract God to their
[1:10:37] presence
[1:10:38] but now God says
[1:10:40] you need to call on me
[1:10:43] now
[1:10:45] you need to call amen but when you call
[1:10:50] I will answer
[1:10:51] I will draw nigh to you
[1:10:54] you see a subtle change I'm going to ask
[1:10:57] you my brother and sister as they were
[1:10:59] walking through the garden and that time
[1:11:01] in this fellowship with God we see that
[1:11:03] there is a you might say a scriptural
[1:11:05] change in the approach but I want to ask
[1:11:08] you this one question this morning what
[1:11:10] is keeping you from an eye from walking
[1:11:13] as it were in the garden and calling on
[1:11:16] the Lord and his presence being with us
[1:11:19] people say well I haven't felt the
[1:11:21] spirit of God move you're not walking in
[1:11:23] the garden provided you're not calling
[1:11:25] on his name because he said that he
[1:11:28] would come and draw nigh to you if you
[1:11:30] would call on his name
[1:11:33] see nothing stopping us we can look back
[1:11:35] and say oh to be in the garden my
[1:11:37] brother and sister oh to be right here
[1:11:39] and laodicea as Sons and Daughters of
[1:11:42] God to call on his name and say Lord I
[1:11:45] need you come now to me Lord amen but we
[1:11:50] got this idea that it's all changed it
[1:11:52] hasn't changed Satan has interjected
[1:11:55] himself and said look I'm more powerful
[1:11:57] God doesn't hear your voice God's not
[1:11:59] going to answer your prayer God is gone
[1:12:01] that what was the voice that kicked him
[1:12:04] out of the garden it was in God's voice
[1:12:06] it was Satan's voice that kicked him out
[1:12:08] of the garden God's voice would have
[1:12:11] been don't do it
[1:12:15] sorry I'm just getting wound up I think
[1:12:18] I wound my spring too tight I had two
[1:12:20] cups of coffee this morning
[1:12:22] Hallelujah
[1:12:23] I'm telling you
[1:12:26] right after church we're all going to go
[1:12:27] run through the park
[1:12:30] So Adam and Eve walked in the cool of
[1:12:32] the evening with the Lord and I want to
[1:12:35] know
[1:12:35] what is stopping you from walking in the
[1:12:37] cool of the evening with the Lord
[1:12:40] it's not him
[1:12:43] it's not even Satan
[1:12:47] we've put Satan in too high of position
[1:12:49] of authority
[1:12:53] have you ever noticed brother Brown
[1:12:55] talks about this
[1:12:57] it's down in the evening time Satan's
[1:12:59] smart
[1:13:00] down in the evening time
[1:13:03] what's he doing
[1:13:04] he's looking back in time and saying it
[1:13:06] was in the evening times when the
[1:13:08] fellowship took place
[1:13:10] right in the evening time
[1:13:14] we'll have thoughts of unrest well
[1:13:16] thoughts of Unfinished things there'll
[1:13:19] be a little turmoil shows up in the
[1:13:20] family go study it yeah domestic abuse
[1:13:24] and all of these other things starts
[1:13:26] usually escalates in the evening time
[1:13:29] what's he doing Satan breaking
[1:13:32] Fellowship
[1:13:35] oh he doesn't care whether they're
[1:13:37] ranked sinners
[1:13:38] they can be a bunch of drunks in the
[1:13:40] evening time
[1:13:41] amen that's why some cities the police
[1:13:44] force has just a little handful of
[1:13:46] officers going around during the day and
[1:13:48] the evening shift will be three times as
[1:13:50] large
[1:13:51] the night shift because the spirits
[1:13:54] disrupting everything in the cool
[1:13:57] of the evening
[1:14:00] and the time for you and I to worship
[1:14:04] first thing in the morning
[1:14:06] and the cool of the evening
[1:14:09] don't let Satan dominate that that's
[1:14:11] right
[1:14:12] kick him right out
[1:14:14] Hallelujah now look in Job 14 and 1 it
[1:14:18] says man that is born of a woman is of a
[1:14:20] few days
[1:14:21] and full of wonderful prosperity and
[1:14:24] blessings
[1:14:25] no my Bible says it's full of trouble
[1:14:28] well I want to be a happy Christian well
[1:14:30] walk in the cool of the evening
[1:14:33] amen get it be the one that brings the
[1:14:36] sacrifice be the one that lays it down
[1:14:38] be the one that draws upon the
[1:14:40] inexhaustible Fountain of God
[1:14:43] but my brother and sister are you a born
[1:14:45] of a woman anybody here not born of a
[1:14:46] woman
[1:14:48] amen you know the government's suddenly
[1:14:49] on a deal you talk about distracting a
[1:14:52] whole Kingdom a whole nation
[1:14:54] we suddenly have an incredible need to
[1:14:57] find
[1:14:59] unidentified
[1:15:00] flying objects and aliens
[1:15:03] it's of utmost importance to our nation
[1:15:06] in its economy and people
[1:15:08] is that we identify
[1:15:10] but they won't believe my brother in
[1:15:12] simple simple word of God when a prophet
[1:15:14] of God said they're investigating angels
[1:15:16] they call it they call it crazy but do
[1:15:18] they have an offering for it nothing at
[1:15:20] all no we have a petrified mummy found
[1:15:23] in the desert or it looks like it be it
[1:15:26] could just be a rock but we're pretty
[1:15:28] sure this is a petrified alien
[1:15:31] and so far your government has wasted
[1:15:33] only like 20 million on this
[1:15:36] and what will it prove if it was a
[1:15:38] petrified alien
[1:15:40] nothing they're still corrupt they'll
[1:15:42] still crooked they're still serving a
[1:15:44] system but they're anointed of God to
[1:15:46] fulfill the word to create an atmosphere
[1:15:49] for you and I and we in that atmosphere
[1:15:52] are not caught in their atmosphere
[1:15:54] because their atmosphere is rejecting
[1:15:56] our atmosphere and that atmosphere of
[1:15:59] laodicea of this world this wicked world
[1:16:01] that Satan could boast and say I give
[1:16:03] you these kingdoms that atmosphere is
[1:16:06] pushing you out
[1:16:08] oh don't cry that you've been pushed out
[1:16:10] of laodicea
[1:16:12] rejoice
[1:16:14] Rejoice I got solved out I have no
[1:16:16] Fellowship in laodicea oh that's too bad
[1:16:20] that's too bad don't feel at home here
[1:16:22] my heart breaks
[1:16:24] Hallelujah
[1:16:26] amen I want to ask you a simple question
[1:16:28] will the trouble of your life young
[1:16:31] people old people listen to me will the
[1:16:34] trouble of your life Define Who You Are
[1:16:38] I say the word of God defines who you
[1:16:40] are amen God's calling in your life
[1:16:43] God's desire to you the creative word of
[1:16:47] God that came from the foundation of the
[1:16:49] world that come and made you is what
[1:16:52] defines you it's not Satan it's not
[1:16:54] laodicea not the spirit of the aid not
[1:16:57] the fashion of the age not the religion
[1:17:00] of the age it's God that defines Who We
[1:17:03] Are
[1:17:04] Hallelujah
[1:17:06] look the word says that Satan was going
[1:17:08] to and fro and if you'll just forgive me
[1:17:10] for this little twist of the word but
[1:17:12] Satan going to and fro seeking whom he
[1:17:15] may convince that the trouble is greater
[1:17:17] than the Lord
[1:17:21] he's doing it
[1:17:23] he's doing it you don't understand our
[1:17:25] problems no I don't understand your
[1:17:26] problem but I do understand the solution
[1:17:29] to your problem
[1:17:32] right amen
[1:17:34] right the devil's over there your
[1:17:36] problem's so big your problem's so big
[1:17:39] and God says just give it to me
[1:17:42] I'll take that big problem amen I'll
[1:17:45] take the problem I'll deal with it I'll
[1:17:48] take it and drop it in the ink of my
[1:17:51] blood or I mean the volume of my blood
[1:17:54] and the ink of your sin and problem will
[1:17:57] gone not even an element
[1:17:59] do you catch that I know you do I I
[1:18:02] almost sound like I'm speaking down but
[1:18:05] you realize my brother and sister when
[1:18:06] that drop of ink hit the bleach
[1:18:08] it didn't swallow it
[1:18:11] it dismantled it that's right it pulled
[1:18:14] it molecule from molecules from molecule
[1:18:19] to molecule until there was not one drop
[1:18:22] of cohesion amongst the molecules
[1:18:27] and when the word of God says that our
[1:18:29] sin went to the sea of forgetfulness
[1:18:32] it's not like the devil could mount an
[1:18:34] expedition and go and search and search
[1:18:37] and search until he would find our sin
[1:18:40] when the blood of Jesus Christ took our
[1:18:43] sin it dismantled it amen not not one
[1:18:47] person of it would ever be able to come
[1:18:49] back together and that's why it can't be
[1:18:52] remembered because it can't be brought
[1:18:54] back
[1:18:56] oh Hallelujah
[1:18:58] hey man it's gone
[1:19:01] oh thank you
[1:19:04] amen but Satan trying to convince hit
[1:19:09] the trouble is greater than the promise
[1:19:11] of the word
[1:19:13] my brother and sister his
[1:19:16] he's such a liar
[1:19:18] it just comes down to that simple he's
[1:19:21] such a liar
[1:19:24] you know
[1:19:30] there's just people anointed
[1:19:34] that if they would just tell the truth
[1:19:36] it'd actually be better for them
[1:19:40] but they're so anointed they just have
[1:19:42] to lie
[1:19:46] you know somebody runs over something
[1:19:49] you can look at the tire tracks and say
[1:19:51] oh those are the tires that are on that
[1:19:53] truck
[1:19:55] did you run over that
[1:19:56] not me

[1:20:26] sister in the struggle of Our Lives once
[1:20:28] again sorry to put you on the spot do we
[1:20:30] have struggles

[1:20:34] those of you that won't lift your hands
[1:20:35] I'm gonna lift both hands we have
[1:20:36] struggles amen we have trials we have
[1:20:40] all kinds of things that come upon us
[1:20:42] there's nothing to be ashamed about
[1:20:44] that's the devil says where you should
[1:20:47] be ashamed my brother and sister there
[1:20:49] is no shame in Jesus Christ
[1:20:53] amen
[1:20:54] in the struggle I want you to remember
[1:20:56] this scripture turn to First Samuel 17
[1:20:57] 45 to 47.
[1:21:04] and I just want to say I just want to
[1:21:06] say this I don't say this boasting
[1:21:08] I don't say this to boost brother Paul I
[1:21:10] don't say does nothing but sometimes
[1:21:11] you've got to just stop and say God is
[1:21:13] using something greater uh we around our
[1:21:17] house there's been some kind of little
[1:21:18] something going on you know and like
[1:21:21] clockwork I mean for for days upon days
[1:21:23] and days and days wake up at 4 30 a.m
[1:21:26] almost on the Dot 4 30 A.M
[1:21:29] and I'm like my I worked all the way
[1:21:32] into the dark I've worked so many hours
[1:21:33] I'm not I'm just laying a foundation for
[1:21:35] you I've worked so many hours in Harvest
[1:21:37] here that I'm just physically exhausted
[1:21:40] I hate to admit this Brother David but
[1:21:42] I'm sitting there listening to you
[1:21:44] preach Wednesday night falling asleep
[1:21:46] amen nothing to be proud about but so
[1:21:49] tired just simply the body checking out
[1:21:52] and then you look at that and say oh
[1:21:54] Lord forgive me but my brother and
[1:21:56] sister I tell you what wake up at 4 30
[1:21:58] a.m I'm laying there at 4 30 a.m and I'm
[1:22:00] like Lord why you know I need to sleep
[1:22:02] and he speaks to me and says you need to
[1:22:06] pray
[1:22:08] you don't need sleep I want you to pray
[1:22:13] and I'll lay there in bed too tired even
[1:22:16] get out of the bed and I lay there and I
[1:22:19] start on one end of the valley and I'm
[1:22:21] praying for you I don't know what's
[1:22:23] going on in your life but I know that
[1:22:25] God wants prayers to go to heaven for
[1:22:28] you he wants him to come to the throne
[1:22:30] he wants a sweet older to come and I say
[1:22:33] God for whatever needs are in this body
[1:22:36] let the prayers move us to the place we
[1:22:39] believe the word and we believe he's
[1:22:42] moving in our midst
[1:22:44] Hallelujah
[1:22:45] first Samuel 17 45.
[1:22:49] then said David you might wonder how
[1:22:52] does this even connect together brother
[1:22:54] Paul I hope you see it then sent David
[1:22:57] to the philistine
[1:22:58] now cometh to me with a sword
[1:23:01] and with a spear and with depression and
[1:23:04] with this spirit and with thy Spirit you
[1:23:08] come with a spirit of laodicea
[1:23:11] and with a shield but I come to thee in
[1:23:15] the name of the Lord of hosts the god of
[1:23:17] the armies of Israel whom thou Hast
[1:23:20] defied I want to ask you does Satan
[1:23:23] never defy you
[1:23:24] amen you'll be saying Lord it and boy it
[1:23:27] just seems like the wheels fall off the
[1:23:29] wagon
[1:23:33] Lord did you hear my prayer he sure did
[1:23:38] but the prophet of God told us
[1:23:40] God has granted to the devil one punch
[1:23:45] most of the time
[1:23:46] we don't want to face that one punch
[1:23:49] because regardless of what you think
[1:23:51] about the devil people got him as some
[1:23:53] limping toothless lion
[1:23:58] no my brother and sister he's as close
[1:24:00] and imitation to the lion of the tribe
[1:24:04] of Judah as Satan could produce
[1:24:11] that's how close he is
[1:24:14] he looks like a lion Walks Like A lion
[1:24:16] roars like a lion but he's not
[1:24:19] the lion of Judah
[1:24:21] amen he's the impersonation
[1:24:24] amen you realize when the prophet of God
[1:24:27] oh I'm sorry we're going to really mess
[1:24:29] up today I said Lord don't let me get
[1:24:31] distracted but my brother and sister do
[1:24:34] you realize if two lions walked into
[1:24:36] this church now I have been those of you
[1:24:38] that have been there you see this I have
[1:24:41] been in Africa and I've been within just
[1:24:44] this little distance of I think would be
[1:24:47] why they call him the king of peace
[1:24:50] the end of his nose this big his paws
[1:24:53] this big that tall get up and stretch
[1:24:56] and make every human bodybuilder envious
[1:24:59] as every muscle
[1:25:01] ripples down his body even the moving of
[1:25:06] his tail causes muscles to go Bing Bing
[1:25:09] Bing
[1:25:11] and if two lions walked in here
[1:25:14] we would not know the difference between
[1:25:18] the lion of Judah and Satan's lion
[1:25:23] so close to deceive the very left
[1:25:27] amen one would come and say worship me
[1:25:30] and I'll bless you and you would need
[1:25:33] the Holy Ghost it's not my brother and
[1:25:36] sister us against the denominations to
[1:25:39] be deceived and some say well it's right
[1:25:42] in the message to deceive it but my
[1:25:44] brother and sister the prophet of God
[1:25:45] said he'll bring it so close
[1:25:50] right
[1:25:51] if it were possible
[1:25:54] but it's a holy ghost in you not
[1:25:57] doctrines no no how much you read the
[1:25:59] Bible how much you've listened to the
[1:26:01] message it's the Holy Ghost and that is
[1:26:05] not a teaching that is a relationship
[1:26:07] that is not our doctrines better than
[1:26:10] your Doctrine that's those I have dug
[1:26:12] into the word and received the
[1:26:15] inoculation against laodicea and the
[1:26:18] moving and the filling with the Holy
[1:26:20] Ghost makes it with eyes of wisdom and
[1:26:22] discernment and understanding and
[1:26:24] revelation
[1:26:26] and we think we're going to teach people
[1:26:28] into the Rapture we're going to explain
[1:26:30] people into the Rapture we're going to
[1:26:32] convince people into the Rapture no sir
[1:26:34] it'll be revelation of the word taking
[1:26:37] us into the rapture
[1:26:39] and if it's revelation of the word then
[1:26:41] what do we need more word
[1:26:47] I'll tell you what
[1:26:50] the Zeal of thine house Lord
[1:26:52] Hallelujah
[1:26:54] amen
[1:26:57] somebody helped me where was I
[1:27:00] defy
[1:27:03] come to thee in the name of the Lord to
[1:27:05] host the god of the armies of Israel
[1:27:06] whom thou Hast defied this day will the
[1:27:09] Lord deliver thee into my hand who would
[1:27:12] actually lift a hand this morning I'm
[1:27:14] not meaning to place but I lift a hand
[1:27:16] and say you know what the devil is going
[1:27:18] to be delivered into my hands
[1:27:20] you say no no that's for God no you are
[1:27:23] the hands and the feet of God he's going
[1:27:25] to deliver how that confession let it be
[1:27:27] today from your lips Satan you're going
[1:27:30] to be delivered in my house I'm not
[1:27:32] going to be delivered into your hands
[1:27:35] oh Hallelujah
[1:27:37] I will smite thee
[1:27:40] now I want to just ask you sorry I'm
[1:27:41] probably way over time
[1:27:44] I think we can wrap up five pages in
[1:27:46] five minutes
[1:27:50] brother and sister look at this now
[1:27:53] when does it ever really just strike you
[1:27:55] in your everyday struggle
[1:27:58] Satan
[1:27:59] God's delivering you into my hands
[1:28:03] mostly we're writing out a writ a decree
[1:28:05] of truce devil you don't bother me I
[1:28:07] won't bother you
[1:28:10] Lord if you just let me get through this
[1:28:11] day devil leave me alone everything will
[1:28:14] be all right
[1:28:15] no sir
[1:28:17] that's not what's going to deliver you
[1:28:19] and I out of laodicea
[1:28:23] it's going to take more than a truce
[1:28:26] remember the truce
[1:28:28] of world war one because that's really
[1:28:30] what it was they said it was a surrender
[1:28:32] but the actual words of the documents
[1:28:35] were a truce that's it
[1:28:37] the prophet touches on those things
[1:28:41] and so because it was a truce
[1:28:44] it had to carry on
[1:28:46] look at what's happening in Korea our
[1:28:49] truce
[1:28:50] what is truce you think you're getting
[1:28:53] Deliverance by calling a truce with the
[1:28:54] devil truth is actually defined as
[1:28:59] unended War
[1:29:02] you want to truce with the devil you're
[1:29:04] just asking for a fight that goes on and
[1:29:06] on and on and on it's time we're more
[1:29:11] than conquerors
[1:29:12] we're not truthmakers
[1:29:15] Hallelujah
[1:29:16] amen
[1:29:19] I was smite thee and take thine head
[1:29:21] from me and I will give the carcass of
[1:29:24] the host of the Philistines this day
[1:29:26] into the fowls of the air and the wild
[1:29:28] beasts of the earth that all the Earth
[1:29:30] may know that there is a God in Israel
[1:29:33] and all
[1:29:34] Hallelujah I love words all this
[1:29:37] assembly
[1:29:38] amen we're going to put another name in
[1:29:40] there all this assembly Grace Tabernacle
[1:29:43] amen shall know that the Lord saveth not
[1:29:46] with the sword and spirit for the battle
[1:29:49] is the Lord's
[1:29:52] no see you're facing struggles in your
[1:29:54] life right now
[1:29:55] it's not your battle
[1:29:56] you think well if I can just defeat this

[1:30:02] are not going to defeat anything the
[1:30:04] battle is the Lord you want Victory give
[1:30:08] it to God
[1:30:09] hey man you want Victory go to him and
[1:30:12] say Lord I need you
[1:30:17] and he shall give you into our hands
[1:30:25] I want to put Clarity to this
[1:30:27] I believe the Lord laid this on my heart
[1:30:30] I believe it fits in continuity of the
[1:30:32] word
[1:30:34] but my brother and sister when we
[1:30:35] studied this
[1:30:37] you go back and he says
[1:30:39] I'll cut your head off
[1:30:45] wow we're going to cut the devil's head
[1:30:48] off praise the Lord cut the devil's
[1:30:50] house no sir you know what you're doing
[1:30:52] you're cutting off his headship that's
[1:30:57] exactly
[1:30:58] where there's no head there's no
[1:31:01] headship and God is giving to you and I
[1:31:04] the ability Hallelujah now I don't mean
[1:31:07] this to be anything if you did or didn't
[1:31:09] but how many of you brought your sword
[1:31:10] to church today amen what are you going
[1:31:13] to cut the head of the devil off gonna
[1:31:15] cut his headship off with you're going
[1:31:17] to take this very word of God and David
[1:31:20] was there and he took the devil's own
[1:31:22] interpretation of the Bible and he took
[1:31:25] it and cut off that headship that there
[1:31:28] was no headship over Israel from that
[1:31:31] and we are here my brother and sister
[1:31:33] the Goliath I don't know what goliath is
[1:31:36] in your life but we are here under the
[1:31:39] headship of the Holy Ghost to take the
[1:31:41] word of the hour and cut off Satan's
[1:31:44] headship then we can then say we've been
[1:31:47] set free from you
[1:31:49] you roaring lion you're no longer have
[1:31:52] headship over me no longer headship of
[1:31:54] the lust of the Flesh and the pride of
[1:31:56] life and the spirit of laodicea but I've
[1:32:00] been set free can somebody say that I
[1:32:03] have been set free amen that's what this
[1:32:06] gospel is about it's not to create
[1:32:08] another denomination another group
[1:32:10] another religion but it's here for a
[1:32:13] people to take the word and cut the
[1:32:15] headship of Satan away from our life
[1:32:18] Hallelujah this is the time my brother
[1:32:21] and sister this is a season this is the
[1:32:23] age that I say this this morning this is
[1:32:28] the moment of time
[1:32:30] cut it off amen
[1:32:32] cut it off
[1:32:36] David could have just
[1:32:38] hit Goliath in the chin
[1:32:42] knocked him out
[1:32:44] and with Goliath come too he could have
[1:32:46] had him all bound up like that little
[1:32:47] kids story about the Beanstalk or
[1:32:50] whatever and they tied the guy up
[1:32:53] and he couldn't convert it
[1:32:56] Goliath
[1:33:00] because Goliath had would have had fear
[1:33:04] I'm not here to scare the devil
[1:33:08] I'm not here to throw the name of Jesus
[1:33:10] Christ around seven sons of Siva they
[1:33:13] went in there in that den of spirits and
[1:33:17] thought they were going to scare those
[1:33:19] spirits
[1:33:21] my brother and sister but when the word
[1:33:24] went in to those spirits
[1:33:27] the word cut the headship off and when
[1:33:31] the headship was cut off Deliverance
[1:33:37] oh help me Lord

[1:34:06] word of God Amen what is it oh I'm just
[1:34:10] waiting come on Saints I'm waiting
[1:34:14] for God to deliver me

[1:34:21] or this Behavior or this thing over here
[1:34:28] God's waiting for you
[1:34:30] to pick up the five stones
[1:34:34] of faith
[1:34:36] in Jesus Christ
[1:34:40] go read it again you don't see that God
[1:34:42] provided David
[1:34:44] with a rocket launcher
[1:34:46] with a sniper scope
[1:34:49] but David had to wind his arm up amen
[1:34:54] and the scripture often returns to it
[1:34:56] refers to it as the arm of faith
[1:34:58] he had to take the arm of Faith what was
[1:35:01] he doing the prophet of God says you
[1:35:03] need to exercise your faithful Faith
[1:35:05] muscles and build them up and that's
[1:35:07] what David did he exercised by getting
[1:35:10] down five Stones those weren't just any
[1:35:12] old stones
[1:35:13] they weren't going to be the stone of
[1:35:15] denomination of the stone of
[1:35:16] intellectualism the stone of
[1:35:18] emotionalism my brother and sister those
[1:35:20] were the stones of Jesus Christ in faith
[1:35:23] amen and he let that go and when he hit
[1:35:27] that old devil
[1:35:31] he didn't go he won't be bothering me
[1:35:33] for a while
[1:35:34] no sir he took the word and said today
[1:35:37] Lord is a day you ordained me
[1:35:41] to find my own freedom
[1:35:45] in Jesus Christ

[1:36:06] character that's right maybe that job is

[1:36:40] the message Jesus Christ in you that's
[1:36:43] going to do it
[1:36:45] right do we believe that we're his hands
[1:36:47] and his feet we believe his voice amen
[1:36:50] we believe that we are the very action
[1:36:52] of the word the book of Acts and
[1:36:55] continuation

[1:37:13] but don't focus on the unbeliever
[1:37:17] come on Saints
[1:37:19] well
[1:37:20] they don't
[1:37:22] or they do
[1:37:23] what about don't focus on them
[1:37:27] well why
[1:37:28] focus on Goliath focus on God all of
[1:37:32] Israel was focusing on Goliath amen and
[1:37:35] David was focusing on God
[1:37:37] he was the only one that had that
[1:37:39] testimony that day
[1:37:41] you've defied
[1:37:43] the army of the Living God so what's the
[1:37:46] ownership it's not the Army owning God
[1:37:48] it's God owning the army
[1:37:50] Hallelujah so amen
[1:37:54] don't focus on what's look I don't know
[1:37:56] why I'm speaking this like I said I
[1:37:58] don't believe in random there's random
[1:37:59] in my studies in a sense that it just
[1:38:01] come to me
[1:38:02] but my brother and sister don't Focus
[1:38:04] on the unbeliever that's telling you
[1:38:07] what's wrong with you don't focus on
[1:38:10] what ain't happening in their life
[1:38:13] oh I prayed and I searched and I asked
[1:38:16] God for Revelation I'm sorry
[1:38:18] I'm sorry I I don't know how to deal
[1:38:21] with that other than you just keep
[1:38:22] getting before God
[1:38:25] but your life or lack of
[1:38:28] is not going to determine my life
[1:38:35] do we serve a prayer answering God
[1:38:38] if their prayers are not being answered
[1:38:40] does that mean we quit
[1:38:42] no sir it means we Rejoice we lift our
[1:38:45] voices and we say thank you Lord
[1:38:48] thank you Lord it's not me that's
[1:38:49] special Lord but it's you in me has made
[1:38:52] me a special person and I believe that
[1:38:56] hallelujah look my brother and sister
[1:38:58] the battle certainly the word not to

[1:39:03] Lord's of very very much so in the day
[1:39:06] that we live in amen we're living we're
[1:39:09] seeing this wicked time we're seeing
[1:39:10] these things come to pass and we realize
[1:39:13] amen how many of you got up this morning
[1:39:15] and said praise God devil get out of my
[1:39:18] way
[1:39:21] you know in one sense you could
[1:39:24] because it is God in you speaking
[1:39:27] but when we get in the flesh and we
[1:39:29] start thinking who we're going to tell
[1:39:30] the devil and anybody else what to do
[1:39:33] back to seven sons of Siva Satan I
[1:39:36] adjure you well they do they ran out of
[1:39:38] there almost stripped naked and beaten
[1:39:41] and clawed and bit and and just just
[1:39:44] destroyed my brother and sister we we're
[1:39:47] not the overcomer
[1:39:49] it's Christ in US amen is he overcomer
[1:39:52] Hallelujah okay so in this age amen if
[1:39:56] the battle is the Lord's then we must be
[1:39:59] his hands
[1:40:00] his feet
[1:40:02] his voice scriptural right every one of
[1:40:04] those be defended with scripture
[1:40:07] amen
[1:40:08] the word says we're the army of the
[1:40:10] Living God hallelujah who's in the Army
[1:40:12] today
[1:40:13] amen every one of us ought to be lifted
[1:40:15] in the hand and say yes sir now look at
[1:40:17] this my brother and sister if the the we
[1:40:20] are those five little stones or have
[1:40:22] those five little Stones I should say of
[1:40:24] faith and Jesus Christ amen and you can
[1:40:28] take that without being out of context
[1:40:29] and say it's faith in Jesus Christ amen
[1:40:32] so those five little Stones amen that
[1:40:35] measure of faith that God has given you
[1:40:38] and I is sufficient
[1:40:40] okay how many times have we spoke to
[1:40:42] ourselves and said Lord if I had more
[1:40:44] faith
[1:40:45] amen
[1:40:46] don't say that any longer
[1:40:49] Lord let the faith in me
[1:40:51] come forth amen
[1:40:54] let the grace that you have given Lord
[1:40:56] be on display oh don't go giving
[1:40:58] yourself Grace
[1:41:00] I can behaved this way because there's
[1:41:02] Grace no sir
[1:41:04] give Grace to someone else
[1:41:07] and they'll give real Christians grace
[1:41:10] to you
[1:41:12] and the prophet of God says this is how
[1:41:14] Unity comes in the church
[1:41:17] yeah when Christ
[1:41:20] is on display that's right exactly
[1:41:22] there's where Unity comes in the church
[1:41:24] when Christ is on display
[1:41:27] not when Paul is on display or you are
[1:41:29] on display but when Christ is on display
[1:41:31] amen so these five little stones of face
[1:41:34] Measure of Faith is sufficient I say
[1:41:37] Amen to that amen his measure of grace
[1:41:40] is sufficient amen and these things will
[1:41:43] defeat the enemy I'm skipping over notes
[1:41:45] in case you wonder what's going on here
[1:41:47] amen hallelujah and so the measure of
[1:41:50] Grace the word of God the prophet of God
[1:41:52] said this word of God this anointed word
[1:41:55] will defeat the enemy at any time in any
[1:42:00] place under any circumstance
[1:42:04] now I want to encourage you today to
[1:42:07] take the word and when the word has
[1:42:10] slain the enemy cut off his headship
[1:42:13] don't walk out of here today and say
[1:42:15] well I'm dealing with this and I'm
[1:42:17] dealing with it and I'm dealing with
[1:42:19] that no I'm dealing with Christ I'm
[1:42:22] dealing with the word and the word says
[1:42:26] Hallelujah
[1:42:28] you think when he said any circumstance
[1:42:30] he actually had a fine print you guys
[1:42:33] have all heard the radio ads always
[1:42:36] comes with car dealers
[1:42:37] and we have you know this BMW blah blah
[1:42:40] blah blah blah for this price blah blah
[1:42:42] blah I don't know there's only one blah
[1:42:44] blah blah blahness this applies
[1:42:47] and even though you didn't read the fine
[1:42:50] print when it's all done you always
[1:42:51] triple
[1:42:55] but what do we hear
[1:42:57] what do we hear
[1:42:59] I get a 5 Series BMW for only 300 a
[1:43:02] month
[1:43:04] and that's the devil
[1:43:06] how about we stop and say devil you're a
[1:43:08] liar
[1:43:10] the word says whenever we sin I'm
[1:43:12] paraphrasing this whenever we sin
[1:43:14] even as Believers we pay
[1:43:18] ice
[1:43:20] why because God wants you to make make
[1:43:23] you sick and tired of being
[1:43:26] sick and tired
[1:43:28] he wants you to come to the place you
[1:43:30] stand up and say Lord I'm taking the
[1:43:33] word I'm hitting this spirit that
[1:43:36] bothers me right between the eyes
[1:43:40] and then I'm going to take this sword
[1:43:43] that the enemy actually provided
[1:43:46] I'm going to cut its head off amen and
[1:43:49] I'm going to walk out of here
[1:43:50] I am you know Brother Paul's Twisted it
[1:43:53] they even added a verse to it I'm sorry
[1:43:55] I can't help myself I'm no longer a
[1:43:58] Slave To Fear
[1:43:59] but it strikes me and I found myself in
[1:44:01] the tractor one day singing I'm no
[1:44:03] longer a slave to sin
[1:44:11] I am
[1:44:12] a child
[1:44:14] of God Amen
[1:44:16] I am no longer a slave to sin
[1:44:22] I have been
[1:44:25] set
[1:44:27] free

[1:47:05] time
[1:47:06] we thought we were offended
[1:47:09] none of you ever get offended right
[1:47:11] let's just use it for an example it's
[1:47:13] it's a church like this one but
[1:47:15] different people
[1:47:16] [Music]
[1:47:18] what it would be when offense comes
[1:47:21] husband wife
[1:47:23] parents to children children to parents
[1:47:26] brother sister
[1:47:28] preacher to preacher right
[1:47:33] that if we was alive
[1:47:35] sure didn't like that
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:39] well that sure looked pointed forgive me
[1:47:41] brother well you didn't do anything
[1:47:44] I'm just following the word the prophet
[1:47:46] said
[1:47:47] Prophet said just follow the word
[1:47:50] you're offended you go
[1:47:55] to them
[1:47:57] you don't sit
[1:48:00] I'm not moving
[1:48:03] until they apologize
[1:48:07] well I can see
[1:48:08] buddy Robinson out there in the field
[1:48:10] saying Lord I'm not moving until I got
[1:48:12] the Holy Ghost rather you'll find my
[1:48:14] bones there but I'm telling you with
[1:48:15] that kind of attitude they'd find our
[1:48:17] bones there
[1:48:18] and it sure wouldn't be because we were
[1:48:20] waiting on the Holy Spirit
[1:48:22] come on Saints all of this has already
[1:48:24] been placed in US
[1:48:26] amen every response of Amen to the word
[1:48:29] of God is in US waiting to come out
[1:48:35] God help us let me drink Lord and push
[1:48:38] out let me drink and push out let me
[1:48:40] drink and push out Lord hallelujah do we
[1:48:43] have time for one more quote or one
[1:48:45] quote period I guess amen is that can we
[1:48:48] put that on the screen brother Gideon
[1:48:50] [Music]
[1:48:51] be not afraid
[1:48:54] it just I'm spoiled Saints it's just so
[1:48:57] much better
[1:48:59] to read it
[1:49:01] they've proven the things that you read
[1:49:03] you absorb
[1:49:05] versus what you hear
[1:49:08] yeah
[1:49:11] I think that's a
[1:49:13] proven
[1:49:15] fact of why the word of God says listen
[1:49:18] to The Voice yeah
[1:49:21] okay
[1:49:22] when Jesus was God made flesh
[1:49:27] the fullness of God was in him
[1:49:29] foreign
[1:49:31] he had the spirit without measure I read
[1:49:33] a quote here the other day
[1:49:35] we have it by measure now if you go out
[1:49:39] here and pick up a spoonful of water out
[1:49:41] of the ocean well that's what Jesus had
[1:49:44] the whole ocean but you and I have got a
[1:49:47] spoonful that's the difference
[1:49:49] you would never miss it
[1:49:52] he don't have to have us
[1:49:54] but we have to have him
[1:49:58] but if you took that spoonful of water
[1:50:00] and took it down to the laboratory the
[1:50:02] same chemicals that's in the entire
[1:50:04] ocean is in that spoonful
[1:50:07] and when God on the day of Pentecost
[1:50:09] when he come down like a rushing wind
[1:50:12] did you notice
[1:50:14] he was a pillar of fire but did you
[1:50:17] notice he separated himself from that
[1:50:20] Pillar of Fire and divided himself
[1:50:23] amongst his people and cloven tongues of
[1:50:26] fire set upon the congregation
[1:50:29] the preacher
[1:50:31] each one of them
[1:50:35] each of them God separated himself to
[1:50:38] his church no wonder he spoke wherever
[1:50:40] two or three are gathered in my name
[1:50:43] Amen Let me put it this way I mean where
[1:50:46] they gathered in my name they've got
[1:50:48] every ingredient that was in me in the
[1:50:52] beginning
[1:50:53] Hallelujah
[1:50:56] I'd have the ocean if I had a lot of it
[1:50:59] no you can have that Spoonful and you
[1:51:02] have it
[1:51:03] hey man no wonder he spoke where two or
[1:51:05] three gathered my name I'll be in their
[1:51:06] midst if two will agree upon anything
[1:51:09] and ask I'll give it to you see you know
[1:51:12] why we don't have my brother and sister
[1:51:14] because we haven't come in the correct
[1:51:16] Unity we're coming well this is where I
[1:51:19] stand that's where you stand this is
[1:51:21] where this church is at that's where
[1:51:22] that preacher is at how about we stand
[1:51:25] and identify in Jesus Christ and let
[1:51:29] that word be our identification
[1:51:33] Hallelujah
[1:51:34] oh my
[1:51:37] what was that when the little fire here
[1:51:40] and a little fire here and each one of
[1:51:42] you is a part of God when we come
[1:51:44] together it's the body of Christ uniting
[1:51:47] God separating himself giving part to me
[1:51:50] in part to you and part to the next
[1:51:52] fella so we can all live and have
[1:51:54] eternal life and now that eternal life
[1:51:56] comes from the word the Greek word as I
[1:52:01] said Zoe which means God's own life
[1:52:05] Hallelujah let's just stand
[1:52:07] amen
[1:52:11] our measure of time
[1:52:14] means nothing if we have God's own life
[1:52:19] Hallelujah creatures of Eternity and
[1:52:21] I've kept you longer than I intended
[1:52:23] Saints
[1:52:24] but I just
[1:52:26] unabashedly unashamably got excited
[1:52:30] amen
[1:52:32] this just shouts to me it rings to the
[1:52:34] Heavens to me I I just sorry I can't
[1:52:37] help myself
[1:52:38] there's just something in this to
[1:52:40] realize everything I measure
[1:52:43] means nothing
[1:52:45] everything God measures
[1:52:48] is life and I say thank you Lord for the
[1:52:51] life thank you for the word thank you
[1:52:54] for everything you've given us Lord
[1:52:57] Hallelujah
[1:52:58] you see
[1:53:02] I understand what the prophet was saying
[1:53:04] 50 years old
[1:53:06] I don't even put myself in comparison
[1:53:08] there but I'll tell you at 61.
[1:53:11] or 71.
[1:53:14] it's better we'll use you Brother David
[1:53:18] I don't want to feel old about myself so
[1:53:22] it's easy to feel old about Brother
[1:53:23] David

[1:53:29] I'll make this declaration at 61. I'll
[1:53:32] make this declaration
[1:53:34] I don't need more time I need more of
[1:53:37] Christ
[1:53:39] I don't want more time I want to live
[1:53:41] out my lauded days but what I need is
[1:53:44] more of Christ
[1:53:45] when I need it's more of the Holy Ghost
