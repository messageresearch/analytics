to see you there's there is quite a few gone traveling but praise the lord it's a good season to travel in amen uh kids in Camp and and uh those just uh encouraging traveling to encourage one another is such a beautiful thing we got to be a witness yesterday of manasse Katie's wedding and uh we just want to um lift them up the Lord would just guide them uh and uh you know kind of this thought uh did not come from that but you know um I'll just be blunt enough to say we'd like to see them come to a full recognition of our Lord Jesus Christ amen so God bless each and everyone it was nice to see all of you so dressed up looking handsome yesterday and beautiful and um it's just it's just good amen and uh also we want to remember Sister Sarah we don't see her we want to lift Sister Sarah uh before the Lord today amen and U the Lord just uh touch her Amen in her body and uh encourage her amen let's turn I want to speak to you today on the thought of coming thank you beautiful song service the the songs actually very much uh corresponded uh with with our thoughts um things bringing us up to this this sermon today and um we uh we just really want to uh look at this thought of coming to a full recognition uh how important it is uh to to come to the full recognition not a partial recognition or not a partial Revelation but the fullness uh of our Lord Jesus Christ and uh how that he uh he has uh given us the word and when he gave us the word now we'll touch on this I don't want to get ahead of myself when he gave us the word we need to recognize just how special that is how how there there is just a a fundamental separation in there that uh uh uh hundreds of millions of people would say we have the word but we want the fullness of the word it's not just uh it's not just that we have a Bible on our Shelf and even as message Believers that we acknowledge that God sent a prophet and the word is being opened in our day but uh you you'll recognize this you can I won't name sermons but you can go right down through a list 1965 uh brother brandham starts to speak mentioning little things that cause us to recognize why he didn't know what was going to happen he knew something was happening he even mentions that you know uh my time here is short now we could all say those words but I believe that God had anointed him to make this declaration the time is short my time to be with you and so now bear with me real quick here before we go in this he left us now you got to have patience with brother Paul here he left us in incomplete message and our Instinct would be say absolutely not but the part that was incomplete was the manifestation in us so the word the prophet didn't leave us an incomplete message to go out and we have to go find something but the incomplete portion was the actual fulfillment or Revelation but now while I'm not saying that every word brother brandham spoke was thus sayith the Lord but when he was just speaking what God put on him to speak literally it was a fulfilled word at the moment it was preached and we're just now coming into the full recognition of what he spoke amen I think it's beautiful because he spoke it it's been waiting for us sir just we look at that and realize that that the Rapture is out here and and we think we're waiting for the Rapture but the Rapture is actually waiting on us amen so it's not something has to happen to bring the Rapture to pass my brother and sister we've got to come into the full recognition and when we come into our fullness of our position amen twinkling of an eye amen amen you know you look at this and see loved ones passing and and we think oh my it's sad but really it's not sad our sister Joanne she come to the fullness of what God had called for her on this Earth amen and and uh we we would see uh all of these things um that that when they come to that fullness my brother and sister anything beyond the fullness is the cycle beginning again the seed has to go back to the Earth that's right and coming back again I thank God for that it's a beautiful thing let's turn in our Bibles this morning to Luke the 10th chapter it's good to see you this morning brother Phil amen had lovely fellowship with you the other day I enjoyed my time amen uh Luke the 10th chapter 23rd and 24th verse um and uh amen Luke 10:23 and he and he turned him andto his disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes eyes which see the things that ye see for I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them Heavenly Father we ask you to bless the word today lead us guide us today Father may we go home saying it was good to be in the house of the Lord help us to be concise in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated as we look at this I just want to touch on um just a couple things real quick verse 23 and he turned him into his disciples and made a broad Public Announcement no it was very private it was only known to the disciples and uh he he then shares to them what the religious world would have thought almost was a um uh you know conceited or something point of view a very very you know uh uh I can't think of the word I wanted to think of you know bounced off my head and was gone uh but you know people would say that's almost like an arrogant statement to say look you're the bride of Christ we're Christians also but here is Jesus speaking to the disciples and he gives them a private word that comes and it it's not for the public it's not for the world and I'll tell you how private is it's even today still private to many that many today it's still not a word that they understand or they believe they understand but do not have the fullness of it and he's telling us that many prophets and Kings desired to see what you have in this day and they longed to hear my brother and sister it's not to say they didn't see glimpses of this or there was portions of it that was real to them but the whole picture amen and and it is that the things that we have today uh that we see and they wanted to see and we hear and they wanted to hear it shows us how that we should not take this scripture too lightly the fact that God has blessed us to be able in this day to hear what the prophets and kings of old wanted to hear they wanted to understand and God has given us understanding amen he's opened it to you and I in this day and and I think that sometimes we maybe take this scripture just a little bit too lightly that we say Okay God God's revealed to us he sent a prophet we see these things the the uh uh you might say the organizing of this and what I mean by organizing is that these things have to be set in order in other words God does not dwell in chaos God is very organized amen he just doesn't like organized religion when they try to set the pattern of how it must be they want us to be organized to hear what he has given the ability uh to us to hear and to see what he's given the ability uh for us to see and uh you know this is an incredible gift from God and uh if if we'll look at that you think all through the life that we live uh uh you know uh uh we've received good gifts in our lives all all through the ages sometimes a good gift is a very simple gift it's not elaborate I I just remarked uh uh you know uh to a friend to a brother here some time back about uh just kind of an off-handed statement you give your children too many Christmas gifts and he said oh we just love our children but you know two days after Christmas the toys are all strewn around the yard and their sons over there in the corner of the yard with a stick digging a hole and so sometimes it is that we think we're giving a good gift but really there would be a better gift amen and certainly listening to the prophet uh this uh last few days here you know and he's he's talking about how that these things that we have received from God these things that were gifts that God has given to us let us not look at them lightly let us not just sit back and let them become common to us because these are great gifts these are gifts whether we are rich or poor whether we are smart or we're just average whether we're good-looking or we are not none of that matters this gift surpasses every gift on the face of the Earth today amen and this good gift is such an incredible gift has come from God and it's specifically tailored to you amen now we can say I hear the same scripture I hear the same songs I I was in the same service but God dealing with you God speaking to you you'll walk out now I'm just assuming that each one of us came Desiring to hear from God today and come prepared amen we come with prayer we come with reading of scripture and we're here today because we wanted to hear from God we're not checking off the box I went to church on Sunday but when we come in here as we walk out today God will have spoken to you now see this gets to be very Broad and generic God has spoken to you exactly what you needed now you have to decide who you is amen amen when you were here if God has dealt with you and realized that was specifically tailored for you for your need because you see one the preacher don't know what your need is and two your needs are so uh diverse that there's no way that one simple thought by man could come and touch each life can someone agree with that and so we see how that God would come and he gives this great gift very specifically tailored to you and I now I'm still amazed uh you know uh a brother shared a testimony uh with me here recently and my brother and sister it's amazing how that when you could just give a simple testimony of what God has done in your life a simple testimony how the word of God has changed your life and you know there's come so many rejections so many times that people just kind of turn that off but I'm telling you my brother and sister the seed knows exactly where the seed is at amen and so the seed being placed in the heart of Sons and Daughters of God I love how God actually camouflaged that because if it was not camouflag Satan would come and do everything outright he could to destroy that life but you know once the seed germinates and the root is settled into the soil amen it's much harder to kill the birds can't pick it up amen the wind can blow but if in the right soil amen you know just a little farmer note you plant and farm in sand amen sand will grow beautiful crops but the hardest thing you have in sand is keeping the plant fed because sand does not hold and getting it to grow in the spring without the wind blowing the sand to cut it off so you'll find that Satan once he recognizes there's something there will do everything but when that plant is rooted down when it is when it is already got life expressed amen much harder for Satan but I tell you when never you find testimonies of men coming from prison there for murder and the seed comes to them in the form of a book in a prison Library you see people that have been in all kinds of circumstances man being testified of his own life of how he was sitting in a bar stool had walked away from the message of the hour as he acknowledged it I walked away from God and I'm sitting there on a bar stool and somebody blasting and he it's what he believed somebody saying well that church over there them branom mites and he got up indignant stood right there boldly in their face and said that's the word that's the truth that's it and they said well why aren't you there and he said it's not that it's me and the next Sunday he went to church and continued to go to church cuz his own words said it's not the message it's me that's it that's it and he recognized all these years that I walked away it was wasn't the word of God that's exactly it was me you see God will use that he knows how to deal with us amen and we look in Hebrews 11th chapter the 39th and 40th verses here and we know Hebrews as a faith chapter and when you would look at that Amen brother Phil and I was just talking about this touched on this you know you look down through here and you see the mistakes and the problems that have have been in the lives of the Patriarchs and all those of old the scripture says the Renown these men that stood and we look at today if you scrutinize their lives uh very critically you you would say this there's something missing in the scripture when it says that these were great men of faith that these were great warriors these are the outstanding David an apple of God's eyes start listing David's faults and and there's no way in a human element you can come to a conclusion that he would be the apple of God's eye but you see God wasn't looking at David through his circumstance he was looking at him through the prophesied or spoken word and and the spoken word he was the apple of God's eye amen and the spoken word no matter what our circumstance today has declared us the beautiful virgin bride of Jesus Christ it doesn't matter the circumstance of our life it's what the word said we were amen and the word is there you know it is unmovable you know the word just simply won't move amen heavens and earth that's right heavens and earth are going to go away but God's word will never go away it's immovable it's the very pin that holds the universe and we see here he said and these all having obtained a good report through faith that's right amen that's it obtained through faith but they don't have a promise it never come to pass the promise for them now we could sit here today and you can look at your flesh and you can say but I did this and I did that go back come on put your name in Hebrews 11 and find that you are a hero of Faith whether you think you are or not because God said I'm looking at the finished work and the finished work is God's word not man's word God's word and God having provided now I hope you catch this is kind of hides in the scripture without us really focusing on it see I I wanted to do more but we're going to be long enough as it is and these all the these Saints having obtained good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us amen we've been given something better than every one of the Saints listed in Hebrew 11 it's hard it sounds almost bful they they were these great people but I'm telling you when the book is finished and time has come and it's going to be there they're going to say are you she amen uh the leontin had wrote a song about that and it's very touching when you think about it they're going to say are you the ones that come through Le OA the greatest time of Revelation the greatest time of overcoming power the greatest challenges of the age and you are them and all we can say is we were provided are you with me we were provided something better than other ages and that was the fullness of the word it was the complete word had come out and in that word every nutrient that we needed spiritually was given to us to take it and Satan tried to beat you out Satan's trying to run you and and give you tired and fatigued and and you know what we do when we're fatigued we we have unra thinking it's perfectly thinking at the moment but it's unrationed something better amen it wasn't what we did it wasn't what we had or figured out but it was provided for us it was placed on the table for us in front of us in the presence of our enemies oh how precious that is that God didn't say I'm going to have to take you to a Wilderness and hide you from this I'm going to put it on the table in the presence of your enemies amen right in the middle of leod DEA I'm going to feed you and provide you and give to you what it takes to overcome in this day that they with without us should not be made perfect and they want to be perfect so you've got a whole you say well I I don't even have a friend I'll guarantee you on the other side you got some friends you don't think you have a friend here in Leo to see on the other side there's some people rooting for you saying come on Brother come on sister fulfill this word come on home because we cannot be made perfect without you and we can take that back and speak it to our lord Jesus Lord we cannot be made perfect without you you see how that that figure eight continuous comes there's no beginning there's no ending there's no spot that we come and say oh we're just done we have everything we need no my brother and sister God has a Synergy that is in his word that keeps us moving and keeps us fulfilling the word of God amen amen now in the church age amen we see here uh leodan Church age brother Brandon puts it this way in the writings he is the true witness now this word true is the same word we saw back in Revelation 3:7 you recall that it does not mean true as in contrast with false see this is something that's taking place with you and I right now this is the word being preached the word by the foolishness of preaching bringing us to to a place that we come into an understanding of this amen it has a richer deeper meaning by far it expresses perfect realization in contrast to par uh partial realization amen now when the word of God first spoke to your life you heard the message you read the message however it came to you and there was there was something that caught your attention and you realize this is true and I'm not being critical of any other Church religion Place time whatever but my brother and sister if truth was out there they wouldn't look like they look that's right they wouldn't act like they act amen they would have a whole different Outlook towards the Bible I was just listening to a man's little oratory on music and he says you know he finds it troubling We Now call it gospel music in the name of Jesus Christ and the attributes of his names many times are not even mentioned he said they could be singing to the devil and you wouldn't know the difference now I'm not here to tell you what kind of music you're listening to but I would like for you to judge it yourself you could take a lot of this music and you could l literally just go over and sing it and the devil would be happy to hear your praise you see we have to be careful because the twins are the so close to deceive is right here amongst us I I don't necessarily mean that right here in the church but I'm talking about in the world we live in it is so close yes sir and so people go they gather they they sing they're all of that and they'll be shocked to find out my brother and sister see this actually happened in nah that they were there and and they were they were enjoining themselves with these others and didn't realize as they thought they from their heart were praising God did not realize that they were praising all of these um Pagan interfused into Christianity right not a separation trying to amalgamate it together and God says it makes me sick that's why it struck me in the song there see we don't want it to be someday that he says well done we want to hear well done every day we want our life and if it isn't well done we have the solution Amen to to amend for that amen back in the Philadelphian age the coming of the Lord was drawing nigh what great love that age manifested for him it reminds me those beautiful words of 1 peter: 18 whom having not seen ye love and whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory and with them we Rejoice also we haven't seen him but we have felt him can we say Amen to that we you can't say oh I saw the Lord but you felt it and this is just drawn out so please don't judge me just for this short term of it but you have seen the Lord that's exactly right you saw his manifestation in Sons and Daughters you saw his life you've saw him in our presence and that's really only a partial realization of what it will be like to see him face to face amen but we have come in his presence amen with him we Rejoice also oh let me back up a little further having seen with joy unspeakable and full of Glory with them we Rejoice also we haven't seen him we have felt him we know him now as much as our limiting senses can L us but one day it will be face to face that is for this age he is coming at the end of this age partial realization will be made perfect realization completed realization Hallelujah we have been looking through a glass Darkly but soon it will be face to face we have been going from glory to glory but it will soon be right in the glory and in his glory will shine we shall be like him wondrously like him Jesus our savior Divine isn't that wonderful is what the prophet says there but I want to say to you isn't that wonderful amen the very thing that has drawn us from the very beginning the very fact that he loved us so much and we have been made in His image and there's nothing more true of being made in His image than the Bride of Jesus Christ amen the real believer is the absolute ultimate of being made in His image amen we're not talking about just Humanity but we're talking about Sons and Daughters of God made in that image which is the word amen do you realize that Christ stood here on the earth as the word we can see his faal facial features as it what of Jesus Christ but the molding that we really want to be like would not to be like him in sandals and robes you know there's been movements through the years of people we want to be like Jesus they let their hair grow and they got a beard and they're wearing uh robes and wearing sandals everywhere they go and they're saying we're being like Jesus but my brother and sister he was the word amen and when we want to be like Jesus that means we need to be molded into this image right here not a long-haired man with a beard wearing a robe walking down the road amen hungry and cold that part of being like him they don't want to deal with and they neither want to be like him on fire they just want to be right in the middle they can go either way it just depends on what the day is right the circumstance amen we are complete in him that is true he would not lie to us about that but one day we will be changed in the atoms amen oh I tell you what my brother and sister you know science has done their very best the Medical Science has done their very best to document the healing process and when you think about this it's it's incredible you see some cells when you are injured blood cell flesh cell the blood cell comes out flows away the flesh cell is there saying wow I've been hurt but there are certain blood cells that say enough of this bleeding I'm going to bind myself together brother I'm going to bind myself with you brother I'm going to bind myself with you brother we're going to stop the bleeding and your blood starts to coagulate and it creates that that stops that flow and then there are cells that just sat there and brother brandham teaches us how that cancer often times comes in from a bruised cell now let's just take that away from the carnal flesh World some times I want to ask you come on we can be honest have you been bruised absolutely amen what is that Satan's attempt to cause a cancer of unbelief to come into you that you would say I don't think this is true I I don't know that it's even worth praying I don't know whether it's worth trusting because I've been hurt and I am bruised but I'll tell you what there's some cells in that body that said yes we have been injured we have been bruised but I tell you what we're going to do we're going to work our way back to the original and I tell you my brother and sister I've got a few spots on my body I won't go into it but I've cut the ends of fingers off I've done things and amazing grace of God there's sales there that knew what should be there and have recreated themselves Amen to be that and I sat here today with a thumb that's got an end when I have cut it off Plum back inside the fingernail amen but God said I know what belongs there and I'm going to send the right cell the right life the right healing virtue to put you back where you belong to make you whole in Le oia to make you whole in a world that could care less about your condition they just want to fulfill what they want to fulfill but Sons and Daughters of God know where they belong and every cell ordained of God to come and put it back in its right order only reason we have bitterness is and things that Linger on through years of our life is because we refuse to let God come back and heal it refuse to bind oursel cell to cell and let God heal that amen we're complete in him that is true he would not lie to us one day we'll be changed in the atoms we will put on immortality we will be swallowed up in life then we will realize oh my you know I'm starting to feel old I'm not as old as say Brother David would be and I mean that politely just talking about age brother Phil I'm starting to feel it though I climb a flight of stairs and legs that used to just be full of Vitality and just Propel me up there say uh I know it's only a few more steps but you could stop and consider resting that's but we don't have time to rest the only rest we're called to is in our Lord Jesus Christ no pause I'll just pause my life and I'll resume it in some later date but God wants us even when we're weary might be weary in spirit might be weary in mind the heart might feel weary but God wants us just keep going don't stop now the Finish is close then we will realize realization now you see what's happening is is God's bringing us to a full recognition right exactly we're starting to have a realization that it's not how much of this Bible I can quote verbatim but it's how much of this Bible I can live verbatim amen because that's the that's the growth that God's looking for is to be like him amen now as I said earlier and now we'll just touch on this the word says that the scripture is of no private interpretation that's right and I'm glad of that because that would all depend on who had the pulpit it's whose interpretation well I'm the preacher today or I'm the pastor of of the church and this is what I say the word means you imagine the confusion you would have let's take the message of the hour that we have it in in booklet and uh uh audio and and some uh you know um film Etc and imagine now if every church that embraced the message interpreted it different and then we all come together for a special meeting h i mean it be like take him from the pulpit none of us agree with him next man gets up take him from the pulpit we don't agree with him you would go through the list of every Minister because everyone would have their own little view right I hope this little analogy would strike with you so a few days ago in the other house on the other side of the road there I was mowing the backyard and or going to mow the backyard and um there was a dough standing there in the yard and uh I wasn't very far away from her maybe less than here to the pews in the back and in my mind I remember watching a video Once where a guy didn't realize that a dough had a fawn there and the dough attacked him and just beat the tar out of this poor guy beat him right down to the ground and that little video replayed it's like I can see see her saying to herself if that human comes just one more step but I stopped and respected the space I didn't say a word anything and she was nervous at first and then she just calmed down and her tail come back up and her ears came up and she's looking at me and I didn't step towards her I stepped sideways and then she moved and went went out the gate and was gone into the cornfield well I go back the next day to mow the lawn and I'm mowing along the out perimeter of the lawn and um let's just say uh lawn care and Landscaping are not one of my um um yeah yeah you know I used to joke with sister Jerry that grass was to keep the weeds from growing and uh then after you mow grass for years you realize the grass is a weed but but you don't want the other kind of weeds and I'm mowing along on the lawn mower and just right out the corner of my eye there's a little Flicker and I'm like what's that and I and and I actually have a picture of it on my phone if any of you love to see it and right here in just this little narrow band that's kind of growed up with some weeds is this Little Fawn it's so tiny and so beautiful and it's laying there and what I saw was a flicker of its ear now I'm standing this far from it it's looking straight ahead you can't even see it breathe it's just laying there and I thought I don't want to disturb the little guy I got on the lawnmower but I went by it you know I I the way I'm over the yard you know went by it like five times things just looking straight ahead doesn't BR and I thought isn't that something we get a choice to either follow our Instinct and not run trust that's it not flee that's it rest now fear paralyzes but this little deer laying there I don't know that you can blink that slow I stood there after I got quite a bit of the lawn mode I took the little picture and it was blinking and I struck me I thought Lauren we got a lot to fear out here right people are like I don't fear the devil but the stop and think about it in natural element there's a lot to be afraid of out here and we in here have a choice we can rest in the peace knowing who we are that Mama you know they figured this language out that Mama told that baby you rest right there all the back so we either choose to rest or we flee and where would the little guy flee he couldn't jump the fence he couldn't run fast enough the wolf would get him I got done mowing the lawn and I come to put the aration back on and and start it and I wanted to rearrange it so he wouldn't get sprinkled and get all wet and I walked up there just close enough to look and the little guy's eyes were closed his legs were out there and his head was down and I thought you know what I think he had an instinct to know there never was never was anything going to get him he understood that now you see the scriptures have no private interpretation but it's been privately interpreted that's why we have nazarin and Baptist and Methodist and all these all these other things now I had a man one time he says well you guys what you believe is an interpretation of the Bible and you know it's amazing if you just trust God me instant in season out of season trust God and I told him sir I know you won't agree but it is not an interpretation of the Bible what we believe is the Bible amen amen not an interpretated form of it but it is the Bible and this is what the problem is is because it was interpreted and they missed the mark they didn't touch it but I tell you the word this this private interpretation the revelation of the word is very private amen it is not not a private interpretation but it's very private because as Jesus was speaking to them he turned to them and he didn't announce it to the world he spoke to them as individuals and told them exactly they stood and who they were and so it was at the discretion of God Amen totally at the discretion of God who would receive the understanding or interpretation of the word he said I didn't give it to a man to interpreted when you will listen to The Prophet speaking of the seals he will tell you I was been awake every single night and God dealing with me and and where I don't remember exactly where that's at if it is right there in the Seal's book but he says and the Lord corrected me so it wasn't his interpretation he thought right a perfect example is the the White Horse and all of these things he he he thought oh this is what this is and then he comes along and says no the Lord corrected me amen so it wasn't brother bram's correction or understanding it was the Holy Spirit correcting that and so that the word will always correct the amen and so I think we all of us today should lift our hand and say Lord if there is any air correct it amen I want every air in my life corrected Lord amen amen so we look at this now John wanted to know if if Jesus was the Christ he sent some disciples over there to talk to Jesus now uh should we should are you him or should we look for another one so John is is coming to a place brother brandham puts it out this way his Eagle Eye got filmed over now my brother and sister if he his Eagle Eye got filmed over our Eagle Eye can get filmed over amen we can't just say I saw that God sent a prophet and it'll just be uh everything will be perfect no overtime little things in our life come on you know each one of us has that little thing the scripture calls it a besetting sin and that besetting sin is not being a drunk or a dancer or something sometimes it's a little something in our life that just limits us enough from taking full Hal of the promise and that becomes a besetting sin CU we'll not go no further amen right amen we can't get beyond that amen amen Satan's tactic is we can come to a place saints that we don't even recognize the supernatural in our midst that's it that's got to be from an Eagle Eye being filmed up over God said he would be here and we bring our lick of fire into the house of God and we don't recognize it we don't see it because our eye is filming over amen we don't recognize The Supernaturals right here in our midst but I tell you what there's precious glorious beautiful reminders coming from the Throne of God just as Jesus he speaks of that he don't rebuke them disciples but he used very strong words there's you got to understand there's kind of a difference there or at least I'm I'm putting a a line in there this difference he didn't say you bunch of unbeliev and no good guys you go back and tell John while the power of God was working on him he had Revelation but he has no Revelation now no what he did is he told them look this is what's happening I'm going to just paraphrase it the blind are being healed their souls being delivered their souls being saved and there's Supernatural taking place go back and tell Jonah about that oh my brother and sister if they' have showed up and and uh got there and said well Jesus said and they told him a different story it wouldn't have helped their interpretation right but I believe they were men faithful that took Jesus's word and carried it word by word and took it back to John and John would have found a spark in his soul that reassured him this is the Christ I knew it was but I needed my remembrance my memory to be stirred that I was called by God in that 20th and 21st century I need to remember that the God sent a prophet to me and I'm here to receive this word I don't care what they say about this being off and that being off because their life doesn't represent truth either amen so they're trying to bring you to them to their level and their level doesn't even come close to the word and it's there but my brother and sister it won't be brother brandom that saves you and I it is the message of the word when Jesus said the blind eyes are being open deaf ears are hearing it is the word for the hour it will be our recognition that we were called to this message we were called to this life that we do see and we do hear it's not about the pastor it's not about the Evangelist it's not about these things it's about you and I that God called us to come into this place and we would recognize the word and say this is what long satisfies my heart this is what I longed for this is what has drawn me out of the depths of sin and Leia amen hallelujah amen these are precious reminders coming from the Throne of God not a redundant message no sir but a message that's here to remind us amen of who we are now 1 Corinthians 4:3 amen I I think this was preached for this day right here be honest that's spoken but if our gospel be hid it's hid from them that are lost in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for jesus' sake now I want you to understand I I I I probably shouldn't go here but I'll just be quick people say you're following a man how many of you followed a man to church today see this word right here is very very direct telling them their minds have been blinded because they don't even believe that's right they don't even believe just go do a little research right now what's going on in the denominational world right over here now they're having great meetings under they don't really say it's the World Council of churches but when they all come together and say we should worship together because we all believe in the same God oh okay nowhere in my Bible does seula show up we have no sun Gods so Sun wives we have no Jupiters but we all believe the same thing no I'm sorry we don't and that Spirit showing up hey we as message Believers should all just get together we believe the same thing no we don't that's right no we don't we believe a pure word we don't need to come and compromise look I I'm not going to be really actually talking about clothes when I say this but but my brother and sister we believe in Holiness that's right amen we believe in living right that when people would recognize us they'd say there's something different about them and we might say well I I feel embarrassed about being different well I'll read you a quote just happen to have it amen but look at this now we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for jesus' sake come on I can't help it they got a lot of forgeries out here they got imperson ators they've got spies in the land they they've got all of this that they look at and that's the only thing they can see my brother and sister what I you see is the gospel is going to be carried and shared and preached and testified of and lived unto all Humanity amen All Nations Kindred tongue there's going to be a true witness in their means amen the prophet of God said God has never left this Earth as it were paraphrasing without a witness amen and if he said it I believe it and he's not talking about a false witness they're out of the picture they're not even on the page he's talking about real true witnesses that you can look at their life you can see the example they live and you can be testified that's a real Christian Lord let me be one of those men amen hallelujah for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ amen Treasures amen and Jars of Clay oh my but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair now I just want to yeah we should finish that scripture thank you persecuted but not forsaken someone say Amen to that cast down but not destroyed always bearing about the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body Hallelujah now as we look at this I want to just hurry right along Matthew 11 verse 25 at that time Jesus answered and said I thank the thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou H has hid these things from the wise and prudent amen H so this just shows that it really is of a private interpretation when it comes from God that's not us having a private interpretation but God having a private interpretation and what I love about the age that we live in this age of knowledge wisdom Etc is you have these Scholars and I I've you know did a little checking on some of these and they'll stand up and tell you emphatically this is what God meant and I'm thinking okay I I'm not very smart but that just that doesn't fit I'm sorry just doesn't fit but they're quite confident that's what God meant okay I think I'll go get educated some somewhere else I think I'll let the Lord educate me I'll let the Lord speak to me and I'll let the Lord break it all down now back into the church age book uh revelation of Jesus Christ chapter 1 now you're all familiar with this quote or should be you recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages we are future age then I mentioned that it takes a holy spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it in other words it just comes down Holy Spirit or nothing that's it amen that's it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real this is why we've come down in the age that the Seminary the theological school all of this it's all presented in the same form and fashion and you can realize that because now they're coming even more and more so the curriculum of a Theological Seminary is almost all in a oh what was the word that was used in a straight line linear all linear they they just you it wouldn't matter if you go to a Methodist Seminary or you uh go to a Lutheran Seminary it's linear because you see the spirits are all being drawn back and lined up to come to be one unified thought and while they don't recognize it because this is from our Seminary just so happens that it kind of correlates with theirs and we're not that far apart even though at one time we stood up and marched out of church and never went back because it was too much but now it's not so much see the spirit's being drawn did you see where they had a great big meeting you might not have caught that on the news they had just a great big um uh ecumenical meeting here the other day and you've got Catholics and you've got all the different denominations and all of them coming and uh some of the some of the people that were there said it was the most beautiful time they have ever experienced they said the presence of God was so strong in the building it sounded like angels singing that's right brother David but the wrong Angels yes yeah yeah so you see what's happening my brother and sister this is all moving forward it's moving forward oh I could just go on and on saying that it's moving forward it's moving forward you guys are getting sleepy it's moving forward that's right it's moving forward but you want to know what the secret is it can't move forward unless you are moving forward because it's an impersonation of the real bride of Christ and as the real bride as manifesting and she is on display Satan's right there oh trust me you've got these that are over into statues and suddenly people are like well it's not really an idol it was a representation and and you got you know now you got Catholics speaking in tongues see it's all impersonation so as you would look at this might might wonder sometimes why brother Paul is wanting you just to see what's going on because as you move move forward they move forward amen amen and I want you to recognize that the word of God moving the bride into her rightful position is allowing Satan to move his bride into her rightful position because if you are not in your rightful position Satan's got no message for his people but perversion and he's just imitating this and as you'll see the word breaking forth to the Bride of Jesus Christ you'll see the word break breaking forth to Satan's bride amen amen oh my brother and sister I won't go into it here but they are having Revelation from the word they're seeing scripture like they never saw it before and they are happy to see that but what they don't realize it's not the same word even though it's the same words amen did that come across right amen not the same word even though it is the same words amen amen because their word is an impersonation [Music] Hallelujah reminds me I hope you guys see a little humor in this just recently I saw an ad for peon pie and they were so bold to say our pie is better than whatever the name Grandma they used to be in the grocery store grandma smiths or something like that our pies are better than Granny Smiths well granny Smith's pies were horrible I mean it's like really that that's the best you could do it's like we can't say these are the best pies around so we'll just say they're better than that and that had no power had no Authority had no life had no Revelation but it's better than that but not by much Hallelujah I wonder how their pie advertisement campaign went down maybe there's enough generation s that never knew what granny Smith's pies tasted like so they think it might be good sister Sue no correlate amen but it takes a special class of people this means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it'll take one with prophetic Insight I want to ask you this morning do you guys have prophetic Insight yes amen we we should be making claim to that you might say well I don't know if I no to see a prophetic word you have to have prophetic insight and so as I have skipped over a portion and we'll drop back to it now ordinary study thinking to make this no that won't work see it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost it's going to be the holy ghost that makes this book liveu to a special class of people and we all know that don't we yes sir then why does that devil come around and try to build a nest on top of your head that there's something wrong with the message because this big crowd out here says so scarecrows scarecrows Hallelujah I'm going to get around to preaching it amen but that little groundhog brother Brown talks about what did he do he went up there to that scarecrow and after a while he looked at that and his desire for butter beans was greater than his fear of scarecrows and he just reached up there and hit that thing and it rattled oh my oh maybe what they said is true but the deep in the groundhog called to the Deep of the butter bean amen amen and he knew what those butter beans were and he couldn't help himself until he realized the days of Miracles are not passed God did not give all power just to the church amen he has given ears to a bride and she hears what he says and says amen she hears his very thought of the word and understand it which is the interpretation brother Brown saying read between the lines what is it my brother and sister she is one mind with her bridegroom one mind she doesn't have to Thum through a whole bunch of different does it mean this does it mean that one mind and it takes her right back to the word and she says this word is for me amen the Bold ground hog says those butter beans are mine amen hallelujah yeah but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit where it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay us ourselves open and yield it to the spirit to hear and to know amen amen you amen you know the veil can't be lifted by man no sir we'll never be lifted by man we must have Christ it's that simple we must have Christ to share Christ amen we've got to have the Revelation that this word was for you yeah that's it if if you have no Revelation the words for you we'll sit in church and think about I don't know what yeah that's right almost every I'm going to throw you under the bus brother Danny almost every interaction I have with brother Danny he reminds me how good the Huckleberry milkshake that he had that I didn't have he wants me to know just how good that was and he's challenged me to drive back to horse you bend and go to that same place and get one but he knows he knows Paul you'll never do it how do you know brother Danny because in this short time that I've met you I know you'll never do it you're not going to waste your time just to drop up there to get one good delicious super delicious the best ever Huckleberry milkshake and you know what with S I had to admit that he was right and the devil said you'll never really catch the mystery of this message and too many of us said you're probably right because he knows if he can just keep you one step from that you'll never quite reach out far enough it's not whether you believe this message it's not about whether there's actually sin in your life see too often we think that devil is all about Sin but sometimes the devil just takes our very nature right and turns it against ourself that's right and then we'll say I would take communion but I'd believe for my healing but what is it he knows you're not going to get past that point right there he doesn't have to throw the garbage in front of you he knows we'll just reach a point remember brother brandham talks about Johnny Johnny had been tied up for so long in sin and unbelief of leod deia but he got set free but it had such an impact on his life that Johnny could only walk out there just so far and it's no longer the chain of circumstance no longer the chain of unbelief holding him it's Johnny holding himself see how clever Satan is Johnny wasn't out raing everybody's Berry Patch and cornfield and whatever else no Johnny's living in a small world that he won't let himself out of Lord help us amen Lord help us my brother and sister amen see we got to come to a full recognition now I'm going to hurry here amen so don't let Satan take away the re reation that you are special you have to see yourself in that Revelation Amen to come to the full recognition that the Revelation is you amen amen you got to be in there amen my brother and sister it's not something we observe from a distance amen otherwise we could we could just sit back and just say yep yep that's true that's true but we have to climb in amen excuse me I I always struggle when I start cutting paragraphs out because my thoughts but anyway you know 2 Corinthians 4 but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that's it that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us no wonder I'm definitely going to stop focus on this no wonder Satan wants you to stop and look at your flesh that's right cuz if you are looking at your flesh you will not look at the treasure that's inside this earn vessel we're too busy looking on the outside and we have failed to catch the Revelation that it's not the outside of the earth and vessel but it's what's on the inside there's where the treasure is hid amen now I never did understand Pokemon but for a season you guys probably remember we'd be in church and people would be parked in her parking lot brother Ivan would be going out there you know asking them what they're doing and and uh you you know Pokémon and somebody has posted a deal on our grounds that this was some kind of a Pokemon um I don't know what was it nugget terabyte megabyte cookie I don't know the right language is I honestly don't but the people were so much they would come I hope you catch this there were so much they would come and park in our parking lot looking for a Pokemon treasure I would have loved to have got their game but we'd have had to dealt with a lot of unbelief to maybe talk to one real person I wonder what they'd have done if we'd put this Pokemon thing right here then people would have to come into church and they would have to come all the way up here to be able to say Pokemon I got you maybe in the meantime we could then barricade them in but you see how they will chase a treasure of a game and then Satan says I'll just get the humanity to chase a treasure but it's not a treasure that can be placed in an earth and vessel it's a treasure of the things of La DEA and we come and all we see is this flesh right here amen and the treasure is in here the treasure is our lord Jesus Jesus Christ so what is it Satan has got us to recognize one thing but not another let me skip some more stuff amen I think we'll call it good today Saints I got just I got the seeds of another sermon left so we'll just let them Sprout and grow into another sister Ruth would you come amen why Christ speak beautiful sermon if you haven't listened to it lately amen it's just good amen I'll take this right here and just share this much of it Moses regarded the reproach of Christ greater than all that Egypt could afford to give himen amen amen there it was he wasn't looking wasn't looking in line to be the next greatest man instead ends up on the back side of the desert you think that was just a simple Cakewalk no sir God gave him I shouldn't share things like this but sister Jerry and I joke about god- giving a wife named Zapora but he needed Zapora that's right she wasn't actually out of order God placed her there amen you're a bloody husband to me because Moses didn't want to take the step that's [Music] right and then backside the desert but he had never met the pillar of fire in the halls of pharaoh couldn't we say thank you Lord take me to a backside the desert Take Me Out to the pillar of fire let the power fire of God be manifested that I could see that God is real Hallelujah let's just stand sing a song or two before we [Music] dismiss 206 brother Gideon I Love You Lord amen key of f I Love You Lord and I lift my voice to worship you oh my soul take joy my king watch you here

in your ear 806 brother Gideon amen you know I think this is really a component that we we really need you say but I believe the message I understand the message I believe I see what God was revealing but you see there's so much more to it the prophet even made this statement that the devil knows the scripture better than you do so it's moving to a place that Satan can't touch he cannot touch the word in your heart Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you oh Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you to see you high and lifted up oh shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you I would just ask that

faithful lift our sister up before the Lord amen we're going to rebuke Satan's scarecrow amen we're going to uproot him set him to the side because it's God's word it's God's word that leads us it's what guides us it's what gives us our very life and so therefore we claim the word of God he brother [Music] Alex sister Rebecca doing good doing good God's dealing with her more and more all the time
