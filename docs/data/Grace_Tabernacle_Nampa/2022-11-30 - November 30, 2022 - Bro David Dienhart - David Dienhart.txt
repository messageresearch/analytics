went to the hospital he did a full work up on him today and they released him they said you're good to go man he had no problems so praise the Lord for that we're thankful um he he does have a leaky heart valve which he's going back to the doctor to see but um just praise the Lord for his no no blockage or any of that that kind of stuff so thank the Lord for that and then my mom so she's been to the Ultra stenographer whatever they call them where they they like scan your arteries and stuff like that to uh see what uh what you got going on in there if any blockage and stuff like that so the first time she went they told her that her renal artery are the one that goes into your kidneys was 40 blocked so she went back um a cardiologist had her go back to another one and the next time they told her that her both of her renal arteries were 40 blocks and her carotid artery going up to your brain was 50 blocks so so I'm back to the cardiologist um this has happened over the last couple years but um going back to the cardiologists last time and he said I want to have this done again because we need to check on this because especially the Carotid artery that could lead to a stroke or something like that so um I want to get this all checked out so she went this last time again uh here a couple weeks ago and she's got virtually very little blockage and so when the doctor called her

what your desire is let the book live it should be every desire we have is to let the book live in me amen we that if we if it's not living in us and what's living in US amen that's what it comes down to doesn't it it's let the book and he's the word he is the book we know the bride is the Living Word in action we are the open book the reveal book amen has been opened in this day sealed up we are that mystery revealed amen so we're the message of the hour amen the light of the hour amen he is the light is that right so is she she is him he said the most Sublime words in the whole message to me and of course there are a lot of sublime word the all truth but she is him it's quite a position I'm glad that the bride can say today she's been positionally placed in Christ what a position to have amen so we are himself revealed amen let's sing this [Music] show me myself and show me my savior let the book live in me amen amen amen while you're standing let's turn in our Bibles to Revelations the 20th chapter I want to continue on the white Throne judgment and this is part two I was going to say what part 1B but this uh this turned to be part one or part two and tonight we're going to speak on the righteous and others that are given eternal life at the judgment and why so I just wish more would be here but God knows where they are amen so it's in God's hands but you're here and I'm here and we're here and God knew we'd be here and so Lord bless each one amen that has come Revelations 20 verse 11. and I saw a great white throne in him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them of course we understand that the great right tone judgment is after the millennium it comes after the Millennium A Thousand Years rained and it comes after the second Resurrection the second Resurrection is not the bride the first resurrection is for the bride and only for the bride amen second Resurrection everyone comes up whether they like to think about it or not everybody Rises and to be judged amen before the queen and the King amen and so and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were open and the prophet said that books the books that were open that's the book or record of your life every one being there that's the record of those that will stand before the Lord in judgment and the books were opened and another book was opened which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books see because their their life is an open book which were written in the books according to their works see there's nothing going to be hit everything every work everything is going to be open amen and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life One book of life so everything of their Works everything was judged according to the Book of Life and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire amen amen you can go ahead and be sated in I just want to make reference to something here that we we mentioned in Revelations 10 2 the angel in Revelations 10 2 had a little book opened in his hand and I want to to mention that because the prophet said this about that in the message in paragraph 168 of the church age book because this is what we're going through and I know the young people have been through the church AIDS books so they ought to be familiar with some of this but we just and and of course it's one thing to be familiar it's another thing to have it revealed and so that's the difference and so we just keep going through it and go through it something new every time this is something more and more through my life I don't know how many times I've been through this book but something brand new all the time in it but on paragraph 168 of the sergeants and church age and that's page 320. he says this and we mentioned this Sunday but I want to say it once more no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life and you notice I'm referring to the little book in the Angel's hand that was opened that's the that's the message of the seventh angel all right and he said no no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life for that is another record that is another record though contained in The Book of Life so it's another record though contained in the Book of Life remember only names are in those books that book okay only names are recorded there names means people if you want to look that up it's in the same message paragraph 91 that he says names mean people that are written okay so you only find one book containing names amen all right and so I want to refer to that that is another record though contained and the prophet or excuse me and the prophet yes goes right to First John 5 11 and 12. and if you want to follow along you can but I'll just read it from here and this is the record that God hath given to us remember another record though contained in the Book of Life and this is the record in other words the book of eternal life and this is the record that God gave unto us eternal life and this life is in his son and he that hath the son he that hath the son what is the New Birth the revelation of Jesus Christ in you and he that hath the son what is it it's an unveiling of Who You Are amen that's who you are so he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life so that's the bride record right there amen that's the bride record and only she can receive that because only she can be born again now who that she is I'm not the judge of that by their fruits they are known but as an individual I know I'm one of them by God's grace and you can too because it's not a hope I'm born again you will know if you're born again you know it amen amen and you grow up into the stature of Christ because that's what's birthed in you and as we said the seed must be there because the seed is himself and his children are his seed so if his children are born of him what are they himself manifested all right that's why the scripture said we are born of God all right so then we'll we'll pull off from that I want you to turn with me to Jude Jude 14. Jude verse 14. of course there's only one chapter in Jude the chapter and verse 14 and Enoch also the seventh from Adam Prophet that's our course that's our type because we are the seventh from the second Adam and Enoch who is the also at seventh seventh age Enoch also the seventh from Adam prophesied of these saying behold the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his Saints you're talking about the Judgment here now to execute judgment verse 15 to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that word convinces to convict as a magistrate would as a judge to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly Deeds which they have ungodly committed and and all their hard speeches which ungodly Sinners have spoken against it so to execute judgment upon all meaning there's going to be unjust and just or excuse me righteous and unrighteous in this judgment there's going to be judgment on all there's going to be an executement execution of judgment on all now let's let's go on further here and let's go to Psalms 149. Psalm 149 and we just ask God to bless this word bless his word to our hearts tonight amen psalm 149. and the ninth verse last verse speaking of the Bride let's just take verse 8 with it to bind talking about the brine the the bride to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with Fetters of iron to execute upon them the Judgment written this honor have all his Saints praise ye the Lord amen amen in paragraph 130 of the church age book I'm going to go through these things pretty quick and I pray that those and those of course on the internet if you're in online we greet you and may you be blessed by this word paragraph 130 of the church age book and this is if you're wondering which one I'm in this is the the newer Edition brother George Edition that he put out and so it's it's paragraph 130 of the of the uh sardesian Church age and it's on on page 308 he said in the white Throne judgment there will be in the great white Throne judgment there will be a separation of people the book of life will be opened and another book will be opened so we know the other book opened besides the Book of Life those are the books of all their life is an open book all right and so as we think about these things we said and we'll just bring it back to your attention a few things right here of what we what we've said Monday or Sunday Monday uh Sunday and that and that is this judgment of course is not for the bride she's the judge in the in the matter it's not for her she's not being judged there the bride will not be judged at the white Throne judgment amen all right so she stands at another Throne though to give an account for what she's done for reward and a lot of people mix that up so that's but that's not the white Throne judgment the bride is never going to be judged she's already been judged in Jesus Christ amen so we've been through that on Sunday if you weren't here then you need to if you'd like to hear it you can hear it online she'll never take it brother Brown said another book was opened and and that's the book of life and he said not for the Holy Ghost Bride she'll never take it because she's in the rapture amen so so and when when life and when of course when we are born here on this Earth there's a record that starts there's not much noise instead until you come to an age of accountability and know what's right and wrong then the noise starts he starts saying things and doing things the person that he has to answer for and when that life ends the record or tapers took off and laid in The Great Library of God it's played right back in front of you at the Judgment so every move you made every thought that went through your mind can you see it he says now oh God do they realize that every word we say scientifically proven it's on a record and starts when we start living in this earth and ends when we die and is put in God's album to be played back again at the judgment oh God these words never die they go on and on the record will be played at the day of judgment and those whose hands went up father if they'll be they'll be right there at the day of judgment and what their heart was thinking what would be it'll it'll will be there at the day of judgment there's nothing happens but what God knows it oh my it's recorded running to and fro through the earth watching every move perceiving every thought knowing everything you're doing the intents of your heart what you intend to do he knows all about it he knows whether you love him he knows whether your intentions are right to serve him he knows all about it and what will it be when you stand at that day when every sins naked before him and you stand there at the white Throne judgment is this is sobering because you're going to be there all of us will be there oh I said yeah the bride will be there but she won't be judged she's judging but we'll be there so as the word said what manner of people or what manner of person ought we to be that right what manner of people ought we to be knowing that we are facing this and the decision time is now not after you pass this life the decision time for Christ to serve him or not serve him to be a Christian or not be a Christian is now the reason the bride will never be in the Judgment because he's already judged that body which I'm a part of he could not stand Us in the Judgment again because he already judged the body amen all right so just to leave that off just to be sure that we understand that now we're going to go here to those that are in the judgment so we we realize it's a separation of person let's go to Saint John 17. Saint John 17 and read verse 2. now we know that God is the creator of all things he can do what he wants with his creation he has that right amen all are his he created us amen for everything he created everything he he is that only one Creator and that's God you're here not by chance you were created you were brought here amen if we can't serve if we think we can go our own way we got news for you why not why not trust and have the absolute of the word that created you he puts you together pretty well don't you think amen every nerve every cell why can't we and he created heavens and earth then what's our absolute that was the beginning word anything that leaves off or takes away or adds to that as a perversion so we don't have to add to add anything it's absolutely perfect all right so let's go to Saint John 17 2 and he said this Jesus speaking in his prayer he said as thou Hast given him power speaking of himself as thou has given him well let's read verse 1. these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father The Hours come glorify thy son that thy son may also glorify thee as thou has given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him so we're looking at another group of people besides the bride that will be at the white Throne judgment that will receive and be given eternal life okay now let's look at this you say well that that's good then I can I can make it there then if I know it's not based on your good works we're going to go into that we're going to realize this in a minute all right so remember the righteous and others now I'm not saying they're not both righteous but there's righteous and there's others that are included in there amen none of those that are being judged at the white Throne judgment are born again none of them so they're going to be born again not born-again people that are going to receive eternal life based on something all right so let's let's look at this and find out what the scripture said it was based on it must be in the word somewhere if there's something that they're basing this on it's got to be in the book of life because their works are going to be judged by that what the word said in that book so there's got to be a basis for their Works to be accepted or rejected is that right Okay so let's turn to Matthew 25. now notice Jesus is saying he's been given power to give eternal life to as many as God gave him now we know that's including the bride we know that's the bride but he gives life he gives eternal life to he's given it's given to others too but not on this side they have to come up through the second Resurrection so somebody let I will get a little ahead of myself here but somebody that's believing and saying they believe and professed Believers of the message but not born again are not going to come up at the first resurrection they're going to come up that's a second Resurrection they're left for the great white the the Great Tribulation which will they will be hunted down as dogs and have to give their life in that time further stand against the Antichrist system amen they won't bow to that thing okay are you with me now I'm including those that are around the message I'm not saying who they are I'm just saying they're there unless you're born again you're not going you're going to come up at the second resurrection and stand before the judge and his bride foreign and be judged by the bride because we can go back to First Corinthians 6 and find out know ye not the Saints shall judge the world and angels judgments committed to her all right all right so now let's I'm just going to take this like I say a little study here tonight so it's a Wednesday night we'll have a Bible study so go to Matthew 25 with me Matthew 25 now this that we're going to go here tonight is sometimes a misunder very misunderstood portion of scripture but the prophets answered these things and Matthew in in Matthew 25 and we're going to be reading with the 31st verse of Matthew 25 and I'm going to read it out of the church age you follow as I'm reading it because I'm following some things here the prophet said like is there any way to turn this down a little bit this light right here is I get a tremendous glare off of this page this white page I get a glare off of it and it's hard for me to see it if not that's fine I can work with it and if it can just dim it down just a little bit it would help that's better yes thank you thank you that yeah that's better okay now you can still see me all right I've not disappeared here if not if I am you still hear my voice all right now I'm going to read here and he begin the 31st verse here all right when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him then shall he set upon the throne of his glory amen He Shall Set upon the throne of his glory and before him we could say a lot about that about his glory because we realize that the wife is the glory of her husband all right so they're one sitting there they're not one per they are they are one together amen and both as sovereigns that's true the bride is Sovereign under headship she's under a headship hey maybe she's still a sovereign she's given right Amen in the word all right so now watch and before him I don't want to dwell too much on these because I wanted to get through this and before him shall be gathered all nations now paragraph 144 of this message says I want lettuce to be very clear here these are not Nations being judged as we would think of Nations but these are people of Nations okay are you with me because this is what the prophet said I'm only so he said these are not Nations being judged all right but they're people of Nations all right and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another watch the statement as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats as a shepherd now there's a purpose of that we'll follow through this in just a second and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on his left now the answer to that about the sheep and the goats in paragraph 142 he says to further clarify notice specifically the words of Matthew he said it does not say that a Shepherd is literally separating sheep from goats but it is as a shepherd dividing sheep from goats they they are not in this particular area of time they are these are not sheep excuse me in this particular area of time in the white Throne judgment the Sheep are in his fold and they heard his voice the word and they followed him they are already they already have eternal life and cannot come into the judgment so the Sheep are his bride they hear his voice they cannot hear another voice they cannot receive another voice amen why because they came directly from him all right just like that eagle can only hear the voice of an eagle because he's an eagle to begin with all right so here I want to clarify that there he's setting as a Shepherd these are not actual the Sheep but he sets them as sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left he's making a a difference here then shall the king say unto them on his right hand that's the Sheep Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you notice it was prepared for them so you can't you can't be a black you can't be a white bird when you were meant to be a different bird you see what I'm saying so they were already prepared the kingdom inherit the Kingdom prepared for you you are in my will this is something that you didn't you didn't choose yourself but God is position you placed you in the word like this okay then he said come inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I watch these things that happen now for I was hungered and you gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous what then shall the righteous answer him saying who's answering him it isn't the bride but they're righteous all right are you are you with me so far all right so the righteous answered him saying Lord when saw we hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when shall we thee or thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee or when shall we the sick and in prison and came unto thee they didn't know it when was it Lord they didn't have a clue what they were doing yet ordained to do it other words they were hardwired to do what they did by God predestinated by God to do it all right that's why they're righteous haha their Works were righteous okay now he said and when they saw thee now the bride believes in doing all of this but we're not talking about the bride here we're talking about another people being judged here that were ordained to do what they did and this was their lot of inheritance and they didn't know they did it boy that's a good one they didn't know they did it all right so he said Lord wind saw we hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee and said oh or when okay and now now he says and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these who my brethren now I'm going to go back on some of these things right here and explain who is his brethren amen and why are these righteous getting eternal life okay now I'm going to tell you yes they do get eternal life we'll go into those I want to bring to you what he said and as much as you have done unto the least of these my brethren you did it unto me amen so there was someone out there that was manifesting Christ for them to do it for and but they didn't know who they were amen so Jesus had to be among them in that day when he's do it saying this and that applies to every age there's somebody that was manifesting Jesus Christ for it was Jesus Christ in flesh no not the calvary man but Jesus Christ nevertheless in flesh the Holy Spirit the word and he said when you've done this unto them you've done it unto me they shall then he shall say to them on the left hand who are those the goat depart for me you cursed into Everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for I was hungered and you gave now the same thing he's saying to them I was hungered and you gave me no meat foreign sick and imprisoned and you visited me not then shall they also answer him saying Lord when saw we they said the same thing when did we see you hungered or thirsty or a stranger naked or sick or in prison and did not Minister unto thee then he shall answer them saying verily I say unto you in so much as you did that not unto one of the least of these you did it not unto me you say but they didn't know what they did that's right but they had but but these others didn't either are you with me and they did it because it was in their heart to do it these others saw the same thing happen but it was not in their heart to do this are you with me all right all right so and these so see it's got to be something in your heart it's not it's not you're trying to do these things to get salvation amen it's got to be in you I'm not now this is the bride believes that too amen we'll do those things from our heart but this isn't the bride we're talking to about here Jesus is not talking about the bride here amen those sheep that he put on the rights not bride now that goes contrary to every Theologian in the country but that's exactly where the Prophet placed the works that they were judged by is right here and there's other scriptures but this is what this is what they did there's some reason they Merit or that Merit necessarily but given eternal life are rewarded I should say was based on scripture okay now now watch this he said now you go down here so he said you did it not unto me and all and these shall go away into Everlasting punishment but the righteous here we again who say the righteous right into life eternal amen amen all right now paragraph 131 I want to make sure I'm staying with my note here no I want to turn to Mark 9 37 just for a moment quickly well I will you while you're turning there mark chapter 9 I will just say this there will be both the righteous and the unrighteous in the judgment it says so these righteous will not be the bride this is the prophet's words these will not be the bride for the bride sits with him in judgment okay now we just read those scriptures I've read to you II Corinth or First Corinthians chapter 6 2-3 showing the bride judges we read that Sunday I won't go into that just to make a point here that these righteous are not the bride those man's making a very direct statement here what you've just read in Matthew 25 he follows right up here behind it and said these righteous are not the bride okay now Mark in Mark the ninth chapter and the 37th verse starting whosoever shall receive one of these such children in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth not be but him that sent me and John answered him saying Master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and and and he followed us not and we forbade him because he followed us not now listen to this carefully but Jesus said forbid him not for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can speak lightly speak evil of me for he that is not against us is on our part for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because he because you belong to Christ remember he knows every little work he knows everything you do he knows your motive he knows your objective your intent amen I want to bring that home to us all that we might be a different kind of people and realize you're being watched and it's all going to come to recording someday you know and and Isaac I forget what you said Isaac but but oh yes you referred to that scripture in Philippians about think on these things just today Holy Spirit just quickened to me that scripture David said Lord he said let the meditation of my heart and remember in the heart is a soul but there's a spirit there's a there's a mind that little spirit in the let the meditation of my heart be acceptable unto thee in other words let it let it let it go let other words a right mental attitude toward the scriptures will bring it to pass let it be from my soul you dwell in the soul let it be from the control room of my heart what I meditate upon amen all right I don't want to get to walking around here I get to preaching then I get beyond what I want to do all right come back all right so he says and so whoever will give a great a cup of water to drink in my name because you belong to Christ verily I say unto you shall not lose his reward and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me it is better for him than a millstone I I didn't tend to read this but we'll read we hanged about his neck and he should be cast into the sea so see that goes right back what Jesus said you didn't feed me you didn't give me drink you didn't but offended okay now let's go to Matthew 10. it's a similar scripture but I want to read it Matthew 10. and verse 41. foreign the prophet in the name of the Prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth a righteous man remember the bride's righteous how many know that she clothed in his righteousness his very life all right and he that receive it said he and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward what was the righteous man's reward eternal life all right and whosoever shall give a drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily I say unto you he shall know in no wise lose his reward all right brother Branham in the message 60 9 25 60. he said he said at that day speaking of the Judgment Day he would separate the people like sheep and goats and he would say to the goats which we just read all that and we go on we won't say anymore it was it now he but the point I want to make here he says and don't fail to get this church keep this in your heart forever it was so unconsciously done the people don't do it for a line of duty a man that gives you something or another because he ought to do it a man that feeds you because he ought to do it he's got a selfish idea it should be your very life your very action Amen in other words it's got to be in your heart it was so surprising to these sheep that they said Lord when were you hungry and we wouldn't feed you when were you hungry and we and when were you hungry and we fed you or where when were youth naked and we gave you clothes and when were you thirsty and gave you drink when were your sick and Minister unto you it was so on automatically it was so excuse me it was so unconsciously done see he said unconsciously done we never knew that but Jesus turned and said in so much you've done to these you did it unto me and brother Branham also referring to the same scripture I give a righteous man receives a righteous man a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward brother Branham referred to that very statement back to Matthew 25 what I just read just so you if you want to know what he said about that it was an unselfish slice not a second thought not to think about it just from their hearts they but they but they that do the will of my father just from their hearts just freely see they were in the will of God doing it see because why that scripture in Matthew had to be manifested all right so we realized that they were they were the righteous one not the bride and then he goes on to say paragraph 134 the question now arises why are these righteous ones in the judgment he said there's no other place that they can come up for there are but two resurrections and since they could not qualify for the first resurrection they must come up in the second which is a resurrection unto judgment he said the ones who qualify for the first resurrection is the bride are not in the judgment and then he reads that scripture in Matthew 5 24 which we read he that believeth he that believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life that is the believer is already a recipient of eternal life which he has in his possession now and shall not come into condemnation judgment but is passed from Death unto life but notice carefully Jesus must yet this is paragraph 135 but note I'm saying that for others on the internet and those listening and you mark it down if you'd like but notice carefully Jesus must have yet have yet another group in mind who had a certain Resurrection will receive eternal life They will receive it at the resurrection not having previously received it as a member of the Bride I want you to turn me to John 5. hopefully I can get through this without holding you over time here John 5 and verse 28 Marvel not at this for the hour is coming in which all that are in the graves will shall shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have noticed done good done even works they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation now verse 1 or paragraph 136 Prophet says we now we all know that John 5 28 through 29 is not the rapture it is not the first resurrection rapture for only the dead in Christ shall arise from the graves at that time along with the living along for only the dead in Christ he's referring back to Thessalonians or the res or the Rapture Only The Dead In Christ shall rise in the graves at that time along with the living bride who is still on the Earth I didn't lose you there now did I John 28-29 is speaking of the second Resurrection some come to some come and are unrighteous and some by their works are found righteous all right chapter or vert paragraph 137 but it says in John 5 28-29 that all are going to come forth from the grave this is the very same resurrection that is spoken of in Revelations 20 11-15 which we just read beginning where the dead were brought before the Lord and judged according to their works and all whose names were not in the Book of Life were then cast into the Lake of Fire we now face the question as to why they should be given eternal life at the judgment for the epistle seems to be conclusive to point out that one must possess the spirit of Christ or perish though it seems thus we must not discredit the words of Jesus who most appointedly sets forth that there are some found in the Book of Life who will either receive eternal life before the general Resurrection which I just read in a record Another record or brother Brown said in a part of that record or in a section was the bride see it's not out of an well it's on one book but there's a section of that that pertains to bride only we just read it there in first John one of the scriptures now so see where it was no he said who will either receive eternal life before the general Resurrection or after it so there are some found in the book of life either receiving eternal life before the second Resurrection or after it and we read the scripture on Sunday the blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power as speaking of the bride all right okay we're moving along the first resurrection has nothing to do with the second death now we know that we just read that scripture that is at the end of the thousand years the second Resurrection all the rest of the Dead live now I want to back up here a minute I'm going Beyond Myself here just a little bit let's back up here to Matthew 25 where we read 25 31-46. and there's only one thing I wanted that what are the the righteous we express that the righteous who the righteous are but who are the Brethren this is what I wanted to back up and get to and and and Jesus said in as much as you have done it unto the unto one of the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me so the first thing is who are the brethren and Jesus ants and and brother Branham answers that on paragraph 161 and he said if there are those who enter into life eternal at the white Throne judgment now I'm going to answer something we we're going to go into here solely on the grounds of being good and kind okay and just and good and kind and just to the elect of God who are his brethren so who are his Brethren the elect of God that's his brother amen okay so then he said if we're gonna if we see that there and they're good and they're good and being good and kind to the elect of God who is Brethren then we cannot but accept that all right now I just want to answer that who are the brethren now but when you've done it unto the least of these my brother and you've done it unto me so we know the elect of the Brethren and brother Branham says in paragraph 143 he says now who these Brethren are is the people of God who are The Living manifested Word or living epistle for their day amen look who they were doing it to who is this what is this message it's the son of man revealed in Bride form that's what the message is manifested again so who are these people and you know as well as I do in your life there's people that you know have done good to you never asking for it they had it in their heart to do it they didn't know who you were but they had it in their heart to do for you give to you how many has ever experienced that over and over again who are they doing it to you're born again who are they doing it to they're doing it to Jesus Christ amen you say well how do you well well the birth who is this birth in me who am I the prophet answered it he said you are Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you're not another this outside man isn't him it's the Inside Man the birth word the birth seed how can his seed himself be birthed and not be himself are you with me that's pretty simple isn't it if he has a seed in you and that's him and he's birthed amen if if a human seed was in me and it's human and I'm birthed I'm human every seed shall bring forth of his kind then if he's that seed he's that seed in this birth what kind of kind are you amen all right so he said see so we see that's what where that's what our pastor has been bringing this is the revelation of it is who you are the bride recognizes her position she recognizes who she is and relies upon who she is brother Bradham said the soul tells you the soul in the soul is who you really are it's not what you think in your mind you are it's what your soul speaks is who you are whatever's in that soul is who you are oh and every one of you have a soul and you have a spirit and you have a body who's speaking to you you don't see who's speaking to you because if you take this if you take the spirit the soul out of me you can speak all you want to me I'll never answer you back right so some part of me you don't see with your eyes and I don't see you the real you amen all right so that's the part you must be sure of and take care of do all you want to this outer body but what's that Soul doing okay I don't want to get too carried away on that I'd lose time here okay so let's go that's gonna be another place I just want to stay focused here so I think I answered that so who's his Brethren who the righteous are all right now paragraph 141 the first resurrection has nothing to do with the second death or the or the second Resurrection the second Resurrection is at the end of the Thousand Years all the rest of the Dead live again and at that day there will be those who come forth to eternal life and those who are caught and those and those others who are caught in the second death now we do not need to guess about those who in the second Resurrection are given life we are told now where is he getting this we are told scriptures we are told it is given to them on the grounds that they have been kind and good to the brethren now God's working right among you you know you know people don't even realize what's taking place somebody does something someday and stand before you and said he was good to me Lord this is what he did there it is recorded see he did it and that was me yes you see me that's me that he did it too I give answer to it are you with me all right puts him on the right the separation of people not now we don't have to question how long it's going to be because the bride's in eternity already what's time to her are you with me I don't know how many billions times millions or millions or ten thousands times ten thousands thousands will stand before him or before her him and her is the same person all right if they stand before him stand before her they're standing before him if they stand before him they're standing before her okay now so they they they're told it is given to them on the grounds that they've been kind and good to the Brotherhood those who raise I'll just say this right now I'm going to come into it the next time I Minister those who are raised and cast of the Lake of Fire will be will be so because of their treatment because of the excuse me will be so treated because of their mistreatment of the brethren we're going to come into whose names are taken off the book do you realize that names are on the book and can be removed not the bride that's another record we just said it we brother Bram called an eternal life record and he went to the scripture to prove it she has the Sun how are you going to take the son's name off the book his own book okay Okay so so here now to further clarify paragraph 142 that was 141 142 to further clarify notice specifically the words of Matthew it does not in Matthew referring to 31-46 brother Brown referring to it does not say oh excuse me I already read that about a Shepherd okay now let's go back but these do not have and that cannot come in the judgment yeah these do not have eternal life in their possession now and they come into the Judgment they are allowed to go into eternal life and he just said why all right but for paragraph 143 and this is where we'll spend just a little bit more time and then then we'll we'll be able to leave off pretty quick but upon what ground do they enter into life I just love this message I love the word without a prophet you would know what Matthew 25 31-46 was really saying and who it's pertaining to amen all right now he says but upon what grounds do they enter into life eternal certainly and not on the fact that they already have his life as does the bride but they receive it because they were kind to his brethren they are not they are not these righteous in Matthew 25 31 46 are not his brethren they were kind to the brethren all right he said they are not his Brethren they that would make them joint heirs with Jesus they are not heirs to anything but life they share No throne with him there or Etc with him their names must have been in the Book of Life and not removed hahaha all right is that right who placed it there did they no God did okay now because of their love of the people of God why because of their Love Now where's that love coming from well I love that person I'll do good for him no they didn't even know they even loved them but yet the love of God was there to produce what they had to do toward them now listen they're going to be surprised at judgment as well as the as the goats and we'll come into that some more later too there's going to be great disappointments at judgment Lord Lord not all to say Lord Lord will enter in but he that doeth the will of my father well we prophesied in your name we've done Mighty works in your name we've cast out Devils even spoken tongues and shouted and danced around and had emotion but that's not the evidence of the Holy Ghost being that's not the evidence of the atmosphere the right atmosphere comes by the word oh there's not a I'm saying the motion with it yes but the atmosphere is created by the word not because you had an emotional time amen I just thought I'd drop that in for extra measure all right now because of their love for the people of God they are recognized and saved no doubt these served and helped the children of God perhaps like Nicodemus what Nicodemus do well it came to you know it was a little afraid to little to show itself that he came at night but he did more than that he bought he bought a hundred pound weight of of spices are you with me for the burial of Jesus you say well that's nothing that's something he wasn't afraid to join up with Joseph of armathea who gave him his his tomb amen and produce the clothing that he put on him and went boldly to pilate and wanted the body when he was once trying to hide at least I'm not about to be ashamed by this I'm going to make myself boldly out before and that's what that's what the scripture say and that's what the prophet declares he boldly came to him they were good they were a help and here brother Branham saying No Doubt like Nicodemus and Gamaliel when Gamaliel stand up and said now be careful what you're doing if these men be of God you found fighting against God what did he do he stood in the place when they needed it and why would a prophet down here on this end refer to his name because he's going to be at the judgment and get eternal life for it and many others you think Amelia did he just did what was in his heart to do he had they said well he had wisdom and he respected the man and stopped it amen amen but he did the will of God all right they were good and kind he said no doubt they served and helped the children perhaps like Nicodemus Camellia they stood for the children in a time of trouble amen amen amen but these others had their names removed because they failed to honor the people of God wow you see God let me surrender everything to you let me know you don't let me try to say well I'll make it you won't even know what you're doing you may turn right around and take well I won't go there because that's I'll go in that later let's go and do it later all right also in the second Resurrection they're going to be Souls under the altar as set forth in the fifth seal the Jews standing for what they knew okay Brother Band makes that very clear they are given white robes and of course it'd be no point of white robes unless they were given eternal life not that judgment all right he also said particularly no particularly that none of those under the altar were killed for the testimony of Jesus they were not killed for the testimony of Jesus they come up in the resurrection received life because of their stand on the word now notice they cannot be bride material the bride turns the cheek and cried forgive them Father they know not what they do but they come up they come up and we're wanting vengeance amen you go back and read it Revelation 6 9-11 okay they they these are Jews they had to be because they're in the facile and is in the fourth seal the Gentile Church bride the Gentile bride has gone in the Rapture these Jews aren't born of the spirit they don't even believe that Jesus is a messiah that yet they were blinded by God they were blinded by God they remember Israel still has three and a half years where their eyes will come open and 144 000 of them be sealed but they got to be martyred in the tribulation amen all right and they will come up with the regulation already having the seal all right now because there's there's the well I won't go there either because we'll get into that more all right these Jews aren't born they were blinded by God for the Gentile sake and God gave him eternal life on the grounds that though they could not come to him yet they were truly faithful to all the world they knew all the word they knew and they died for it as multitudes died under Hitler and Stalin and will yet and will yet die he said okay now we're going to turn another corner here stay with me I want to come back to these people that help and serve the children of God if you turn if you look in Isaiah 44 28 I think we have time let's just take a little bit more time in Isaiah 40 in Isaiah 44. these are not long scriptures but I want to just point out a person you can study it later in Isaiah 44 and is speaking of King Cyrus good to the people of God here's a gentile King paragraph or Isaiah 44 and verse 28. that saith of Zyra Cyrus so you read back and read about Cyrus that saith of Zyra of Cyrus he is my shepherd here's God speaking to him he is my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure even saying to Jerusalem thou Thou shalt be built and to then and to and to the temple thy Foundation shall be laid think of that now here's a man that's doing the will of God a gentile a gentile King and God's saying he's going to do as my shepherd he's going to provide for them and he's going to give them the means to build rebuild that Temple which is my place of worship My Chosen place of worship is that right okay and he did that for an elect Nation all right and so he says now it comes down here 45 and verse one he said thus saith the Lord to his anointed to Cyrus whose right hand I have Holden to subdue Nations before him and I will loose the loins of Kings to open before him the two leave Gates and the gate shall not be shut and I will go before thee and make the Crooked places straight and I will break in pieces of gates of brass and cut in Sun to the bars of iron and he's and he goes on to say and I will give Thee the treasures of darkness and the hidden Riches of secret places that thou mayest know that I the Lord which called thee by name in the god of Israel that you'll know I'm the god of Israel for and it says now in the fifth verse all right now let's go a little further let's go down to the 13th verse I have raised him up Cyrus I have raised him up in righteousness and I will direct all his ways and he shall build my city and he shall let go my captives not for Price nor rewards saith the Lord of hosts so there's another help good to the people of God now we could go on others brother Branham speaking about in the hospital as a boy just bear with me a few more minutes in the hospital you know as a boy he was shotgunned he had a shotgun and he was losing blood laying in his own blood they couldn't get blood transfusion they didn't do it at that time all they could do is soak it up and that was it okay of course we know he was delivered the Lord delivered him had a set of legs he said perfect and he said but here he says and the next morning under those weakening conditions they didn't give blood transfusions they'd operated on me and they and they gave me ether and the old ether I guess you remember it's an old anesthetic I've had it myself personally and under that ether when I came out I was coming out of their ether after eight hours they had to give me so much they thought I couldn't wake up they couldn't get me awake and I remember Mrs rotor stood by me there in the hospital I'll never forget that woman see I'm just giving examples here I'll never forget that woman no matter what happens I shall never forget her she was just a young woman then her husband was the superintendent down there at the car works and I remember she's standing by me her and Mrs Stewart and they was and they was the one actually that paid that my hospital bill I don't even have food to eat I didn't even have food to eat in the house so we could how so how could I pay a hospital bill hundreds of dollars but she through her church society and the Ku Klux Klan paid the hospital bill for me Masons he meant he said that and he said Masons I can never forget them see no matter what they do or what I sh I still there's something there's something that stays with me see what they did for me and they paid the bill to Dr reader a help in time of need you think they did that from their heart sure they did they knew who they were doing they they didn't know he would be a prophet who he was he was that to begin with he wasn't even born yet again and yet he was seed a young boy promising God he said I went to hell I believe I've been to both places he said I went to hell saw that down there see he said don't you ever go that way he said I screamed my papa no papa there my mother no mother there ice cream see God brought him back out he said I'll serve you Lord see he made a promise even before that anyway God see he had to go there to tell us what it was like amen the Mysteries had to be fulfilled completed finished what they did but he said I'll never forget it then spoke about a Catholic priest he said some of the best friends of what I know are Catholics hey do you realize that man may be sitting here tonight perhaps is the only way the only way we got this Tabernacle built because of a Roman Catholic stood on his feet in the court there and went to the front for me boy like nobody would do what he went to bat for him he said if if you others says that's right and they couldn't turn it down that's right they said they figured out it'd be too many people oh that won't make 80 more in that church like that that church is standing there and he said he said I know the pastor and all like that he said that church has been there said the rest of you can add to it then why can't they a Roman Catholic yes sir stood up didn't he all right what about the shunamite woman that built a house for Elijah recognize and be a righteous man build a room Simon the Cyrene board the cross for Jesus the Bible said he bored I could give you scripture that Luke 23 26 Joseph armathea which I already mentioned Nicodemus Mark 15 43 John 19 38-39 you've heard of him speak of brother Carl Williams I knew the brother personally brother Carl was the was the president of the Phoenix chapter of the Full Gospel businessmans but he was the one when they wanted to put brother Branham out not he said we need to get rid of him we don't want him back preaching any more here at the at the Phoenix chapter or any chapter Carl said if he goes I go and they couldn't lose brother Carl because he's kind of wealthy big supporter but yet he stood up for brother Branham and gave him an open door he even made it public to the people he said If he if he don't stay neither do I and brother Brown's standing right by him he said brother Graham you ought to seen it he said how many want brother Brown to come back and he went out walking out there and he were piled a hundred dollar bills wanting him to come back and keep coming to Phoenix see it wasn't them it was the ones whose names had to be removed I just say it like that because they mistreated see all right now so he stood and even brother Branham even thanked him for it publicly so I'm not afraid to say what he said he said because he thanked him for it publicly about it so it's not a not a not a secret thing what happened and then brother Outlaw which had a church down in Jesus name Tabernacle down in Phoenix he said that man he's such a sweet man I'll never go anywhere or anything but he wants to always do something for me he said that's his way gave me an offering did everything always wanted to do for him he said that's just his way brother Outlaw never recognized the message of the hour but something in his heart said I want to help this man and brother Brandon if you ever if you ever heard that message when he preached the message who do you say this is the last time he preached it brother Jim Outlaws Church Jimmy Outlaw he laid it on the line I mean he just like he skinned it you know what I mean really strong and yet the man was always wanting to help him amen all right so we could go on and on with that but we'll stop right there let's turn to Genesis 14. just help me get through here now Genesis 14. and you're all mostly young in here so you can take a little less sleep Genesis 14 and I want to just refer to and I won't have time to go into all of it but here and verse 24 he Abraham went out to return get his brother his his nephew lot bring him back his kings came into Sodom stole away all all the goods and took lot and he got some people together and went after him you know the story and it says and then and then and he said I've lifted my hands up to the Lord I'll not take a not even a shoe latch it I won't take anything even a threat even to a shoe latchet that I will not take anything that is thine lest they should say I have made Abram Rich he didn't do it for that see it's verse 24 save only that they which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men which went with me aener s call memory let them take their portion what were they I helped Abraham all right they were a help Genesis 18 23. when when when the angel and flesh went down was going down to Sodom and was heading down to Sodom to see the two witnesses already went down two angels and he was going down to Sodom the point I want to make here is Abraham's Drew near and said wilt thou destroy the righteous with the wicked verse 20 that was 23 24 pre-adventure there'd be 50 righteous in the city without also destroyed not wilt thou just also destroy and not spare the place for the 50 righteous that are therein that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay a righteous with the wicked and the righteous should be as and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all Earth be right and the Lord said if I find in Sodom 50 righteous within the city I will spare it and the place for thy sake and then he went down to as it goes down into into 45. and he said I'll spare it for 45. then 40. I'll spare it for 40. then 30 I'll spare for 30. and B20 I'll spare it for 20. if there be 10 I will spare it for 10 righteous hey these weren't the Seed of Abraham but they were righteous you see the tie here I'm trying that brother Brown's saying here see all right and we know there wasn't 10. but they came out are you with me those righteous came out Matthew 25 speaks of the foolish virgin we won't read all that scripture but we just read a portion and now let me read what the prophet said first about this but Matthew 25 and I'm not going to take time now I'm trying to go through this you can real quickly here Matthew 25 just a little study Matthew 25 and it says and then the Kingdom of Heaven shall be likened unto ten virgins that took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise and five were foolish okay you know the rest of the story I'm not going to go any further with that but what are foolish why are they foolish why were they called foolish foolish means and brother Branham said about the foolish virgin they said he said they were dilatory meaning that they were slow to act and that they were slack and sluggish and stalling and let me say this that they're also considered righteous because they are saved but not on this side they don't have eternal life as the bride does now they get it at the Judgment now watch foolish means to be void of understanding why were they void of understanding no oil they lacked Revelation no Revelation they could not receive nor hear the message for the season amen yet they are standing right amidst the bride for a reason and I'm going to come to that you just give me I've got to get this because if I don't it won't fit all right now listen void of understanding and void of sound judgment that's what foolish means unwise acting without judgment or discretion in particular things so they're acting unwisely acting without judgment or discretion in other words they have no discernment they have no Holy Ghost discernment to recognize the hour they're in oh they believe it's God sent a prophet they will stand with that I got proof of that in Joshua they listened to what a prophet said but they didn't catch the revelation of his message amen all right so he said now what is the wise the wise are having the power which is the Holy Ghost because it's nothing of a carnal self so the wise have the power of discerning and judging correctly of between what is true and what is false between what is fit and proper and what is improper as a wise Magistrate a judge all right what is spit and proper see we're speaking of the Bride so it's no carnal power of their own nor wisdom of man but the Holy Ghost in you not your wisdom or or life it's his that's the wise virgin they have revelation which identifies them as an identified Abel to be the seed amen what was the difference between Cain and Abel revelation Faith the face seed amen all right now this is what brother Brown said in paragraph 148 it is the second Resurrection wherein the five foolish virgins come up notice that they were virgins they did not have the Holy Spirit so they missed being in the bride while the five wise who had oil became part of that bride but these people being a separated god-loving people and trying to abide in the word according to what they knew of it they're trying to abide in the message of what they know of it amen they say how do you know it's the message because I've got a scripture that says they crossed over with them across Jordan and went to fight and helped them fight foreign all right now he said and we're about ready to close here bear with me and he said what they knew of it and being it's in other words they walked in what light they had and being helped in the work of the and being a help in the work of the Lord will come up at the end of time they will miss the Millennium which we can begin to see by these truths is much more important than wonderful than we ever believed okay who's the Millennium for the bride all right all these people had their names in The Book of Life and their names remain so you have the foolish virgin and the others both were a help both were good to the people of God amen now let's let's clarify this right here at the end here about this foolish virgin let's go back to Joshua let's get these scriptures real quick and you can study it and I said just hitting the high points of this the Joshua chapter 1 the Book of Joshua chapter 1. and verse 12 and the rubinites and the gadites and half tribe of Manasseh notice half tribe spake Joshua's saying remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord or brother Branham the servant of the Lord commanded you hello saying the servant of the Lord saying the Lord your God hath given hath given you rest in other words they've already received their their lot given them rest and hath given you this land this land being on the other side of Jordan the East Side the rising side Sun of the side not the promised land of the Holy Ghost are you hearing me all right they they weren't given that but there was a half tribe in Manasseh that did the NASA was the firstborn are you with me but remember His Hands crossed Jacob's hands went over to Ephraim which was a type of the Gentile but Manasseh was the firstborn so half of them had their inheritance outside of the promise and half of them had it inside five were foolish and five were wise half I don't think that's by chance see all right so then we see here and then we go to Joe to Joshua 22. let's go to Joshua 22 and find at their end thank you for being patient I know I'm taking a little more time than is normal but not abnormal necessarily for me and for others besides Chris all right I wish I could do that brother Chris I can't be you all right Joshua 22. I say 22. oh I'm in judges no wonder I can't find it all right Joshua 22 there we go okay now we got it and verse 1 then Joshua called the rubinites and the gadites the others see because they went over and helped too they were help also are you with me notice how brother Branham divided these amen because he said then also besides these others there's a tribulation saints come up and get life okay now he says now Joshua called the rubinites and the gadites and the half tribe of Manasseh and said unto them you have all kept all that Moses brother Branham the servant of the Lord commanded you as much as they knew and have obeyed my voice and all that I command you you have not left your brother in these many days on this day but have kept the charge of the Commandment of the Lord your God and now the Lord your God hath given rest unto your brethren are you with me in other words Brethren meaning they were of the same Nation all right as as he promised them therefore now now in other words you help them come to rest but when it come to the positioning of them in the land they couldn't be positioned in the land are you with me they were positioned on the other side now so it's a type and therefore now return you and get into your tents and into the land of your possession which Moses to servant of the lord gave you on the other side of Jordan okay and we could go on but and now now to the one-half tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bastion but unto the other half therefore gave Joshua among their Brethren on this side Jordan Westward that was them in the land and Joshua sent them away and it goes on to say that he gave the possession of the other half of Manasseh to this setting of the Sun or the rising of the sun on the east side all right now these of the foolish virgins also are those who do not worship the Beast paragraph 152 or become involved in the Antichrist system but die for their faith tribulation even though they are not in the bride not having been born again but they will come up in the second resurrection and go into eternal life I think I'll just just leave it off let me see make sure I've just got others here nope that's all right they suffered persecution it was martyred amen amen the foolish virgin were not lost brother Brown was asked the question are the five foolish virgins lost he said no they are not lost they are saved in the judgment amen I could give you the quotations on those and where those are found if you'd like to have it they're judged at the judgment and as long as they are virgins they are before God see their sheep on the right side and not sheep of course as sheep on the right side amen okay then we have that previously shown that those who stood for the bride and were an aid and comfort to her those had their names remaining on The Book of Life and so we have a part that is bride we have a part that is kept that must might enter into eternal life in the second resurrection and part of it which is accounted chaff is burned in the Lake of Fire God bless you let's stand who's going to discern who's going to be able to discern these spirits that are so close I think I'll leave that but we do know this we do know this that there's only one that's going to discern it only the elector for Destiny will be able to detect the difference between them why they're born again thank God for the discerner let's bow our heads in prayer our heavenly father thank you for giving the people patience to wait and listen Lord may be others who can listen this is in places this is a great controversy Lord who are those people why they have received life the Lord I believe it's been answered and Lord our our desire I desire I'm sure there's others sitting here tonight or standing Lord to their desire don't let me miss the Rapture don't leave me here Lord as your Prophet call now don't leave me here don't let me go through that time [Music] the time of judgment on the earth time of Chaos martyrdom killing Lord let us be a part of that body that is in possession now of eternal life I commit this service to you and those that will listen to it later wherever it may go it's in your hands in thy name the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] amen if I must fight no that's not it either I'm trying to still think of that song Let's sing all is well you believe all is well bright it is there's one thing you must be sure of that you're one of his if you've got a pull for God had a pull for you you couldn't pull you couldn't have a pull for him unless he put it there you can't have a desire for him unless he had the desire for you you couldn't choose him unless he had chosen you did you know that said you have not chosen me but I've chosen you so if that is in your heart don't try to be like the world you already see where the world is it's already been it's already been separated before you that there's nothing in the world to give you life there's no I say world let's go deeper than that amen there's nothing outside of this word that'll give you life it's only Christ and you can be positive you say well I can't I'm not I'm not sure but you can be sure you wouldn't say that unless it said I just say back to you what's the desire of your soul I want to be sure well then you can be sure don't let the devil kill you can't be sure because you can be or you would never desire him well I just can't live it who's telling you that I can't either but he comes in and lives at himself amen amen God bless you what are you playing huh all is well amen why because you know him all is well amen we have heard the message [Music] that's what this message is to the bride shalom very there is a place a perfect dress behind the Inner Belt soul rest little bride dress our own

me you would do it and I desire that and I'm hungering for it Lord here I am I've met your requirement I've done what you said to do I've repented I've been baptizing your name but still I feel like I don't have this I want that Revelation I want you to come in and reveal yourself I want a true baptism of the Holy Spirit and I have the desire Lord you said you would give me the desire of my heart subtle challenge you'd want that it's yours why because he's already given it to you you want it he's given it to you what do you have to do take it take it you say what do I do to be healed take your healing he's already provided it's yours he redeemed it he gave it to you so has he given you your salvation so has he given he wants to fill you more than you want to be filled now think about that
