encouraging isn't it amen good to see each and every one of you brother manasse pray the Lord's just healing you quickly amen each and every one of you God's blessings be upon us and amen amen uh for those who are not here today for whatever reason we just pray the Lord would just reach out and touch you and just move in your presence amen I know a brother brother Sergey I believe had to go back out on the road and brother vasile's out on the road um you know I had a lovely conversation with my mother this morning and and um you know so I I try to call her and just encourage her and this morning she's like now you just tell all of them I'm praying for them and they need to return that favor and pray for me amen so I just was a little excited for my mama you know she just was kind of chipper this morning and and uh you know she made the decision not to come home and do Thanksgiving with us because they're making them stay uh in their rooms uh for a full week um covid test or not the way I understood it and uh anyway this morning she was like yeah there was a lot of them poor people went home for Thanksgiving and now they're just sitting in their rooms so you know it's just hard to understand sometimes but uh certainly appreciate your prayers for our mother and uh I don't know to those of you that uh communicate with brother pant sister aona um just keep them in prayer amen uh the Lord just come the surgeon as as you probably know the surgeon said that he thought the surgery went well and um but we're going Beyond well right amen you know as that one leper that come back into the presence he caught a revelation saying it wasn't that he said hey I need to go back and say thank you he caught a revelation see Jesus told him the word and it was by Revelation that the word that was spoken was revealed and those others went off to show themsel to their Earthly priest and he caught a revelation this is my priest amen and to be made not just healed of our infirmity to be made well but to be made completely whole amen and that's what we're asking for each and every one you might have a health issue in your life don't just reach out hoping that God would take some symptom away from you but believe the word and desire and press to be completely whole amen let's just stand today so I just ask you to remember brother pant sister aona especially uh just you know their heart's desire Saints you know if it was a complicated situation but if it was different uh they would be here this morning in our presence and we thank the Lord for that um I want to speak to you this morning taking our thought out of the book of Romans the 8th chapter but I want to title it this morning as I am persuaded and um my brother and sister when we realize just how important that is you know um I don't want to jump ahead of myself but you can have Revelations you can see the supernatural you can even have God speak to you and not be fully persuaded that is part of the foundation when brother brandham said you can be anointed of the Holy Ghost and go to hell see you could see that presence you can see that milky swirl of the Holy Spirit moving through the service through the the building and you can say I was there when this happened you simp need to be persuaded it's not just a matter of what you witnessed amen Romans 828 today amen amen feel free to say Amen to the word today amen don't don't let anything come and hinder you you know had a little of this and a little of that happen and I feel a little bit no just press beyond that Veil and if it's the word of God you feel free I'm not telling you you have to but just feel free to say Amen to the word and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God I'm going to punctuate that with an amen to them who are called according to his purpose that's me amen for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brother moreover whom he did pred predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified now I want to ask you this morning is there any glorified people here in the sanctuary today amen what shall we then say to these things if God before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justify now I want to just put a a slight uh different phraseology phraseology to to that last line it is God that justifi y I want to present it to you and this won't change I don't believe this scripture but it is God who sets the rules yes see it's not man it wasn't the priest of the Sanhedrin they they were the knowledged ones they were the educated ones they were the ones that they all gathered around Nicodemus was the one they all come and said Master teach us but ultimately it was Nicodemus that realized something more yeah something of different rules something that I didn't understand what must we do Jesus rebuked him but not really a rebuke he says you're a master of Israel and you don't know these things you see God sets the rules it wasn't a school it wasn't a religious whatever it was in how many years there's no such thing we honor our elders but there's no such thing as seniority that's right in the body of Christ amen Heavenly Father we come before you today just asking Lord that you would speak to us father ask you to speak freely Lord come directly in our midst father that we could stand today and be able to say that is me or that applies to me I see that Lord for we want to come closer to you Lord we want to come right directly into your presence ask father for your blessings upon all those father uh here in the church and father those around the world the bride of Christ ask you to be with them we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated I want to just go back into these verses here in um the 35th um verse and we want to then continue this on or start with 34th I mean continue this on who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died y rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us now I love this and and I remember the first time I've read this scripture many times through the years and when this first reached out and and struck me uh I realized that sometimes we can just read the scripture you might say mechanically uh just reading the sentences moving to the next verse but when we stop and take the time to really examine or look into the word of God and it struck me one day as I was reading this it's not what shall separate us but it's who that's right and we realize my brother and sister that the only way Satan can move in your life and cause you distress and dysfunction is if you agree with him right exactly right as long long as you stand on the word of God now we're not talking about when I'm good enough or when I reach some Pinnacle of whatever that's not what it's saying but when you recognize all I have to do is continue to agree to the word of God and Satan is bound it is when we start to and pardon me for putting it in this phraseology but it's when we start to say Amen to Satan's words amen so be it then that's when our trouble starts amen amen so he says right here who shall separate us from the love of Christ now my brother and sister that only who that is in control of that it's not Satan it's you now I'm talking to Sons and Daughters of God right who's already had a propitiation already had an advocate already standing on the word of God the blood was shed for you I'm not talking about the rank Heathen that cares nothing about God who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter now I'm telling you my brother and sister this goes against the human nature the human nature will do whatever it takes to live right the human nature will betray another person to uh uh Accord life for thems but we're counted as sheep right oh my when you want to be sheep in his pasture you got to be sheep when the tribulation comes too I'm not talking about the Great Tribulation I'm just talking about tribulation in your life nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded this is where I took my thought today for I am persuaded oh can we say that together for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord amen I'd like to modify if you don't mind tonight today uh verse 39 nor height nor depth nor any creature shall be able to separate me that's right amen get it down make it personal not just talking Collective as a group but bring it right down look the preacher wasn't preaching to me the scripture wasn't talking to just every I mean preaching to everybody else uh he wasn't just talking to that he it was speaking this was written for me amen and and I believe this and I I lay a hold to this because I I am persuaded that this scripture applies to me amen hallelujah amen so we want to take our thought or title today I am persuaded amen those are very powerful words my brother and sister that is not I have been preached to or I have been told of but it is there the personal acknowledgement that what I heard from the Gospel of Jesus Christ completely convinced me yes in other words Satan no longer has my ear amen he no longer has a piece of my heart amen he does not even have a piece or portion of my destiny I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God and in this my brother and sister we can come to the conclusion that there is a power that is greater than all of the spirit of leoa because leoda is contining continuing to to try to convince us that this modified form of religion now brother brandham tells us saints that that the the denominational church I'm sorry my mind is just galloped off over the hill I'm trying to catch it uh the denominational Church my brother and sister they have not completely forsaken the gospel the word says that they had left the gospel powerless right go ahead you can go however computer phone whatever you can go to to websites you can go to uh uh uh um YouTube listen to them you you'll think wow they're they're preaching pretty straight they're preaching pretty straight what we sometimes think oh oh they're just preaching some absolute aberration it's just a bunch of garbage but you'll listen and they're preaching pretty straight but my brother and sister the very thing they're preaching is powerless to the people right it does not make to change in them as a group of people yes that's right so regardless of what the minister might get up and say you know he's talking about you must be born again but you see it's lost its power it's lost its virtue you see that's why I've been questioned before brother Paul you kind of seem to give an awful lot of Grace to them well I do my brother and sister because without the quickening power of the word we would look at that same equation and we would be saying the word is being preached but we as the bride of Christ don't want just the word alone we want the quickening power of the word we want the word to bring life into us and we are here with a hunger that was supernaturally placed in us to say I am hungry for the word and that's why my brother and sister I've said this many times and I stand on it it's just an opinion but I stand on it why brother brand did not in the early uh times of his ministry did not go now you people leave all of that you leave all of that what did Brother brandom do these people come they were anointed by the Holy Ghost Hearts were discerned people were healed the word was open and preached and then he tells them go back that's right amen seems contrary right but there was one thing that he knew that once they had experienced the quickening power of the word they could not go back and be satisfied he knew that they would go there and it would be a matter of time that conflict would start because then and we have some personal testimonies of of brothers that I've met through the years they're mostly older now many of them have passed on but they talk about this and they say you know my wife and I you know we we experienced something we we felt the presence of God we saw some Supernatural things some discernment and and he told us go back to our church and we went back to our church thinking when we bring this to them that they will be as excited as we are but when they brought it they said oh no no don't worry about that and then as the pastor the ministry started preaching things they had to go and say oh but Pastor the word says and it wasn't long that they either felt compelled to leave or were kicked out because you see God didn't have to have someone tell them you can't go there you can't go there my brother and sister where the carcass is is where you're going to find the bride of Christ amen she can't stay over here on this boxed up carrying that they want to give to you now you got to go for that fresh word amen amen and as we come we see my brother and sister that the word of God is moving in such a powerful way that Sons and Daughters of God can no longer sit still my brother and sister if we had a model and day Journey wait we do we have our own version of 40 years in the wilderness we have our own version of a bride of people with a promise being tested with time and many have not stood that test of time and it breaks my heart yes it does but you see there is a people that can't help themselves right it's something inside of them something stirring the heart something drawing well life is hard well I tell you I have a friend that's very fond of this phrase he says life is hard and then you die get used to it I don't know why he says that but he says it and I'd have to say it is true life is hard and without a Rapture that's it but wait the part he didn't equate that's it is if you start talking about this to the bride of Christ she's able to say I've already died that's right praise the Lord I already died I'm not looking to the end of my life I'm not looking to a grave somewhere I'm looking to the fact that I di died and was born again amen hallelujah that's right now you know it's been a couple Sundays I guess since I preached but my last Sunday service I was speaking to you of the lepers and how that they were anointed to fulfill the word of God and you look at that and we see these lepers now they're outside of the city outside of the gates and they're discussing their situation now my brother and sister remember it's just them in the conversation there's no priests there's no theologians there's no one else that's just them and they're discussing their situation and as they discuss this you'll see you might say in a modified form we can look at this just knowing human nature that they themselves they persuaded themselves you realize that there wasn't a priest there there wasn't someone of great influence there it was they themselves but what we need to recognize is that there was a anointing that was coming upon them that even as they reasoned out or persuaded themselves of what they should do if if we stay here we die oh my brother and sister I hope you see that there is an anointing to every decision that you and I make there is no decision that is just arbitrary that is without influence there's always an influence amen and they're there saying if we stay here in the gates of the city we will die if we go into the city we will die so let's go down here to the city Ians and if they have mercy on us we might live and if they don't what have we got we'll just die so they were fully persuaded when they went down there I don't believe now this is just a personal take I have nothing to back it up but I don't believe as they were walking down to the syrians camp that they kept looking back to the city to see if anything had changed they were persuaded amen there's nothing inside of the city there's out nothing outside of the city our only hope is that they would have mercy on us and so they were anointed to take that position and start in that journey and as they walked in that Journey my brother and sister because they were persuaded did not mean that they did not face doubts did not have fears I have no doubt that as they walk down there they got the Jitters any of you ever get the Jitters I'll tell you I've been scared so bad before I had the Jitter so bad I couldn't hardly even function I have no doubt as closer they got to Camp they got the Jitters they were like wow you know the first guy out here might say oh a bunch of lepers and might just strike them down with the sword but it didn't stop them did it they face the fears of today of Tomorrow next week next month next year they face those fears but because they were persuaded they pressed on Amen Hallelujah you see they were persuaded under that anointing you see someone had to fulfill the word of God and God chose them my why didn't he choose a great arbitrator to come with his great you know robes and his great counsel and sit down to arbitrate this agreement God said no what I'm going to do is use the impossible to change what we think is impossible to bring about an out come of a prophecy that must be fulfilled you know we live in the day my brother and sister we need to be fully persuaded amen cuz I can tell you anything less than pul fully persuaded you will not like the results right you know it is a very common Earthly symptom of not being fully persuaded I know your minds are diing deep to try and find something but when you have buyer remorse it's evidence you weren't fully persuaded right now I won't pick out any individual whatever I think all of you will know but I'm going to use out something that would be more like what I would experience you walk in to Sportsman's and for years you've wanted a certain pistol you have the money in your pocket a very key ingredient in the day we live in you have your wife's permission you walk in there and you walk up to the counter and you say sir I would like to look at that pistol right there when the man lovingly pulls it off of the wall and lays it down in front of you and says this is a really fine pistol and you said that's right and I have the money right here and I want it to be mine you fill out the paperwork they approve you you walk out the door you go to the range you shoot it you lovingly caress it come on I know you Brothers maybe a few of you sisters even and you never ever look back once about saying I wished I hadn't bought it see you were fully persuaded but you you walk out of a store whatever it might be five bucks or 500,000 and you question yourself for days and weeks and months should I have done this see you were not fully persuaded now I bring this very carnal Earthly example to you to recognize how subtle the symptom of not being fully persuaded can be amen it is not some lifechanging event there wasn't Thunder there wasn't lightning there wasn't some kind of message across the sky but if you walk out of there and question what you have done you weren't fully persuaded amen that's right because you see anything less than being fully persuaded you won't like the results you'll be pulling as it were this gun and that's a poor analogy but I believe you're with me you'll pull that gun out of the gun cabinet for the rest of your life with a little pay of should I have bought this gun was there something better or or maybe you're broke and you sell it on Z Idaho for less than you paid for it just in a couple months and your mind is like this was a mistake this was a mistake my brother and sister I know men I'm not saying it's right but I know men that feed their family cornflakes before they'd sell a gun because they're persuaded they should own that gun now some of you will go oh I ain't right just as the child's joke is I'm just preaching now I want to bring to you an example out of this scripture my brother and sister that shows us how we must be persuaded and the results of it would reflect how persuaded we are in First Kings the 13th chapter behold there come a man of God out of Judah by the word of the Lord unto bethl and Jobo stood by the altar to burn incense and he cried against the altar in the word of the Lord and said oh alar oh altar thus saith the Lord behold the child shall be born into the house of David Josiah by name and upon thee shall he offer Priests of the high place that burn incense upon thee and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee and he gave a sign the same day saying this is a sign which the Lord has spoken Behold The Altar shall be rent and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out and I'm not going to read every bit of this scripture I'm going to just preach it to you and when it came to pass Jobo was opposed to this prophecy of this prophet he was up in AR arms of this prophecy and so there it was that Jobo hears this and and he's saying of the man of God which cried against the altar he he's saying lay hold on him amen as though killing the messenger would stop the message my brother and sister as though a repudiating what has been spoken will somehow undo what is spoken see that's the spirit of the day that we live in right now there's many voices that are repudiating what has been spoken they they are saying it is false it is false but I'm here to tell you if you have a circle of friends around the world if you have studied if you pay attention you'll see even though they repudiated it it is still coming to pass you see just because the naysayers say nay my brother and sister does not take it from being the word of God and so as they say no it can't be so I find it interesting there are men that I know have made certain statements and not even two years have went by except for they'll never eat their words they will never ever bring it up they will never stand behind what they said but the very things they said can't be so have been Vindicated to be so but you'll never hear them it becomes a narrative that they abandon and they pick up another narrative right because you see if they're anointed to say nay then that's all they can do just like four lepers were anointed to go to the syrians they must follow the path that they are anointed to follow and as they move down that path they will say this isn't of God this isn't of God this isn't of God and God vindicates it anyhow you see God didn't really care what their opinion was and as Jobo is there Jobo saying lay a holds of him but you know what whether God's in this or not God's job is to vindicate it not you and I we're not to go out and say we're going to make this message come to pass no more than we as Sinners no more than we of the lust of the flesh pride of life lust of the mind all of these various things that make up all the the deficiencies of of the human nature all the things that we call Sin no more than we can just make a mind up and say I'll deliver myself from this my brother and sister no more can they stop the word of the Lord coming to pass than a man can reform himself and do away with his sin many a man that was a drunk said I will quit drinking and he did many a man that smoked says I will quit smoking and he did but no man can remit a man's sin and so as Jobo he puts forth his hand against him and his arm dries up that he could not even pull it he could not even move it you're talking about my brother and sister not just a war of words but we're coming down to a season a time once again where Satan bellowing out spewing forth many say it's a war of words but it's not it's something much deeper the anointing that anointed for lepers to follow the word of God to vindicate it is the same anointing that will move the bride of Christ in our day to fulfill the word of God it will stir her heart to where she without fully understanding why will follow the path that God ordained you see my brother and sister it isn't always such that we even know the the path we're walking on did you hear me did you understand that you and say this is the way I'm going but you see it's not always even we comprehend this path that we're going amen is it hot back there could somebody turn down the AC just a smidge for those of you that are not hot well it's very hot amen so when Jobo asked him pray for me please would you please pray for me and he prays for him and his arm is restored and he says you know I'll give you half my house I'll do this I'll do that come Feast at my table do all of this and here is this young Prophet says nope I've been commissioned by God to not drink anything eat anything not even travel the same path thank you and he walks out now look my brother and sister Jobo is not what we would call a Christian he was not a spiritual leader he's offering incense a a at a heathen altar right and so it's there it wasn't too hard for this young Prophet to turn Jobo down I I don't want what was in your house I don't want to partake of that I have a higher commission but look at this as we'll look down through the scripture we'll see my brother and sister and he returns another way he goes another way and returned not the way he came to bethl and now look here in verse 11 if you follow here's an old prophet and his sons came and told him the works of the man of God had done that day in bethl The Words which he had spoken unto the king them they told also to their father and his father said unto them what way went he for his sons had seen the way that the man of God went which come from Judah and he tell tells him you know what go saddle me a donkey I've got something to go out and speak to this young man I've got something he needs to hear i' I'm ano I'm anointed also I hope you catch this I'm anointed also to speak to this prophet and he goes out there and I think my brother and sister I hope you can catch this in the depth of that and he goes in verse 14 after him and he finds him sitting under an oak he said art thou the man of God that comth from Judah his testimony is I am he I a man of God Amen he said come home with me and eat bread and he said I may not return with thee nor go in with thee neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place for it was said to me by the word of the Lord Thou shalt eat no bread drink no water there nor turn again to go by the way that thou comest and he said unto him I a prophet also as Thou Art and an angel spake to me by the word of the Lord saying bring him back with thee into thine house that he may eat bread and drink water but he lied unto him now my brother and sister if you'll do uh just even a rudimentary search of the theological ideas concerning this I I I don't believe I found a single one that really connected in its entirety some HD along the edges of this but we can cut this down into the very simpli that God will stick and has stuck and will always stick with the original word God doesn't have a new word to a new generation amen and so as we look at this he says you know what I'm I'm supposed to uh uh uh come you're supposed to come with me and uh this is what I I'm want you to do so under these words he goes back with him and eats bread in his house and drinks and as they sat in the table that the word of the Lord came unto the prophet that brought him back and he cried unto the man that came from Judah for as much as thou disobeyed the mouth of the Lord and Hast not kept the Commandment which the Lord thy God commanded thee but cameth back and eaten bread and drink water in the place which the Lord did say the eat no bread and drink no water thy carcass shall not come again to the SRE of thy fathers right and we'll look at this my brother and sister and the reason I bring this an example here is this young Prophet under the anointing of the Lord he comes to bethl he's in the presence of the king he prophesies this is what God has said and Vindicated by the word of God the altar break the ashes pour out and when Jobo himself goes to raise a hand against him his arm is petrified every evidence my brother and sister that God was absolutely with him but when it come oh I hope you guys catch this but when it come down to another man of God not a heathen but another man of God saying God has spoken to me God has revealed to Me an Angel of the Lord Has Come he come now and the individual word that God come now look there's a very important part right there that we must catch the individual word of the Lord to you amen amen because you see there are some things that are permissible but God would tell you no that's right amen that's right but brother so and so or sister so and so or this family no no listen to what God says to you amen now I just use this as a carnal example I don't pay much attention to your finances so I don't think I'm throwing a rock in your pond but there's a good reason why many of us will never be rich because we wouldn't be able to listen to the Lord amen on what to do with that money that's right that's come on that's right and there's men in this message that are worth millions I know a brother who's worth a hundred so million dollars you'd never know it and you'd never know what he does with that money because money just strangely appears in places and no one can make the connection of when where how or why you see God knew he could trust that man amen with that kind of money oh don't feel bad if your bank account's empty right now God said he'd provide amen amen so just thank him give him praise for being your provider amen don't worry about what you didn't have that's right because it might be just heartache you didn't have but you look at this and see as the word come this Prophet says this is what an angel told me is that you should come to my house and if he had kept the same resolve as he had with Jobo he would have said nope the Lord said and I'm going to stick with what the Lord said I'm not deviating from it not one I owa my brother and sister he would have just waled right back to his house right back amongst his own people having done the word of God and brought it to pass but you see he put some respect well this is an elder Prophet to me more experience and my brother and sister you can see the spirit of the day is it all right just to take the spirit of this day and apply it back and look at that in the same context and there'll be those that would say but we have been in the message longer than you God has revealed to us I know it's contrary to Timothy I know it's contrary to Titus I know it's contrary to Matthew but the that's it right we sat at a dinner table we had a word after that word we had something that come forth since that was written you see what God said I want you to stick with my original word to you hallelujah amen it's not about what somebody coming later and saying well this is what God's saying now my brother and sister I believe in Revelation now now this might shock some of you I believe things will take place it's not even written in the Bible because God himself is not constrained simply by words the supernatural of who our God is is unfolding every day I'll give you an example so you don't think I'm going crazy my brother and sister Sciences Pro the universe is still expanding oh yeah so even when Jesus was standing on the earth the universe has expanded but it is not relevant to you and I amen all that we need to make the Rapture the prophet said is already in us and that's not because we have some capsule that something got poured into it's because the word is in you and I amen and the word is bringing forth a deliverance from this fleshly boundary amen so God is moving so as God chooses to do God chooses to move will God change oh my brother and sister God cannot change God cannot change but just because your name's not written in the Bible doesn't mean this every scripture is not written for you amen because God himself can include you into the word amen it doesn't have to be by ink on the page it can be by the thought and the spoken word and then the power of almighty God says make it happen and it happens can you agree with that amen you see he basically come and as we have seen in this day many voices I've heard from God since you heard from God but my brother and sister the commission that is now is the same commission as it was then and that is stay with that original word look at the results that young man would have had if he had been a 100% persuaded that's the point I'm trying to get to amen he was not 100% persuaded that that applied when another Prophet right spoke the word to him now we're not going to bring conflict right because we understand the difference between a prophet and a pastor but we can also go in the message where brother brandham says that a prophet is a pastor or a pastor preacher interchangeable as it were and so we can oh that's the only quote we need I'm a prophet well I wouldn't be lying would I oh come on don't get all nervous folks y'all bunched up in the back corner of the shed you see my point but let's get the whole picture not just a point oh look it's a year it's November whatever Day 2020 I've just realized by reading the prophet's message I'm a prophet now I've got y'all looks a gunshi I'm almost afraid to move forward I'm going to choose something so ludicrous you'll know I'm just kidding y'all are going to go home today and sell everything you have and bring me cash but not just cash I want it in Gold do you realize there's people there's people that would go and they would do such but did it line up with the word they lined up with somebody's word that's right and some people it's sufficient just to have somebody's word now I used a really ludicrous example there Saints because I want you to understand that when you hear the original word if you are not fully persuaded to that original word then another word will come and the influence behind it the individual behind it the group that is behind it will be enough to sway you in your thinking when the word of God itself told you to take get back to the original word and don't deviate don't add one don't take one away so look what happens this young man look I I can only imagine the anguish that must have struck his heart amen and so here he is that he has eaten this bread he has drank he has his donkey and he goes to go down the path and as he goes there a lion meets him my brother and sister don't you know that when he comes to this he is there grieving in his soul because he knows he has stepped away from God's word to him and I can tell you right now my brother and sister every man and woman of God that's been offered the word of God the truth of God and allows themselves to be drawn away as they come as it is into the Judgment they're not going to go there blindly they're not going to go there singing happy songs they're going to be grieving in their spirit because they were offered that original word and they failed to take and be persuaded by that word and to put value to that word and to claim that word oh I know I'm speaking a little straight but you know what just talking with a brother here the other day and he made a comment to me he says brother Paul it's very important that we do not have the blood of the people Upon Our Hands amen I'm not preaching this from Fear I'm preaching it from conviction in my heart that the truth is my brother and sister if we need to speak it well fine I'll take the grief amen but we must speak it amen amen now as we look at this my brother and sister he failed to stay with the original word and he allowed himself to be persuaded to a lie amen Lord give us wisdom and trying to do God a service without it being God's will go read the whole context okay no little puff of wind is going to blow it off no little denomination or nothing is going to blow it off no little persecution is going to blow it off it's directed to the point it's going to hit there to then God when it hits that point God will vindicate it Bullseye uh-huh exactly what he said he'll do amen my brother and sister we sing the songs we hear the specials we testify of this can we come to the place that we are so persuaded of who we are in Jesus Christ that we can look at the word and God said it and I will stand it to the end of my life because that is the truth amen persuaded if God said it it will come to pass that's right hallelujah oh hallelujah amen thus sayith the Lord it shall come to pass here it is see there you are now God had not revealed it in his provided way so they went about to do it apart from his word and apart from the season you realize we can have all the word correct if we don't have the right season we still got a problem right just the same as they have now when men no matter how sincere tried to do him a service outside of his provided way they always mess it up that's right hello it ain't just the preachers that's right like balum balam thought he was doing God of service now look what brother Brown says next do you think God lies does God ever change his mind well people act today like he did who brother brandom just cuts her right down to the right down to the scalp right here when he said for women not to cut their hair they say we can cut it Dr so and so said we could brother so and so said you're just too narrow-minded uh-huh uh-huh see well can this happen this happen yes uh-huh so and so said so God don't change his mind right did you get what I got out of that you don't know what I got that but I think you know what I got out of that amen amen I don't care what they say over here and what kind or how big that church is I don't care who this person was with and where they have been I don't care about the one over there the one down there whatever it is my brother and sister what did the word say amen I don't care who's got the latest Revelation or the latest interpretation my brother and sister what the word said you see I've got a constant there you've got a constant there that we can stand on but we've got to be persuaded oh don't I don't want you to think I'm just picking on people or thoughts but I just want you to know I just uh am out on the very loose edge of all kinds of things and information kind of comes my way sometimes it's not so fresh sometimes it is but my brother and sister you've got a whole the the word says not to be blown around by every wind of Doctrine but I tell you what there's men have come around this message right here in this United States and they are preaching this nice beautiful flowery message that's not very far off the original but it makes us feel so good we're not going to walk out of church today like them people in Grace we're going to walk out today happy we're going to walk out just so full of joy praise the lord well some of you didn't forget your smiles at home H there's only two Spirits amen right in the framework of the church amen but let me bring it down to another way that is the same only different would that be okay the same only different it's not just two spirits in the framework of the church it's the persuaded and not persuaded yeah forget about what little Doctrine they're preaching forget about what little ideology they're holding on to forget about all of this stuff cuz if you are persuaded God obligated himself to take you back back into the word amen are you with me it's not just well they've got this idea and this no my brother and sister God sent message in our day amen right Hallelujah are we persuaded that message is sufficient or do we need to look for another remember what happened when John's eyes got dimmed over he sends a message out we acknowledge who Jesus is and we acknowledge all that's happened but we're not sure it's him do we look for another it can happen to you it can happen to me but when you're fully persuaded amen they took the message back to John what was that message we think this is the Messiah this is the Messiah and John gave his life for this gospel amen that was enough took him through that little time that little wavering those little currents that blew around those of you have flown in a small plane you know what that's like a current that you never feel in a a 747 in a little plane it tosses you around but when he got through that bumpy time and it was anchored back in his soul I did see the signs I saw the Wonders I heard the word preach I saw it come to pass I'm persuaded and he went and gave his life for it you see you can't fault the man or the woman for the shaky time of their life but my brother and sister you can fault as it were for their decision of what direction they go hallelujah amen hallelujah you know I'm going to say before we go on to the book of Colossians I'm going to say this the believer in this age you realize that you're a very unique bird amen hallelujah very unique bird amen for as the prophet of God brings this example about the eagle and how that the eagle can fly much higher and see much further than any other bird my brother and sister we have some Hawks that live in the trees there close to our house that one Hawk I'm not exaggerating that thing Must Be This Tall it is just huge and every bird when it flies around there every other Hawk and anything else just you never see anybody pulling out in front of it they all give respect to that bird incredible bird I could give you all kinds of stories that just marvel me about that bird but my brother and sister regardless of how Majestic this great big red tail hawk is he's not an eagle that's right that's right probably has a bigger Church yeah yeah that's right brother David you see the Bride of this age the believer in this age my brother and sister has to be fully persuaded the season of being blown to and fro is over amen we have to decide where we stand and and I have quotes to back this up I just don't have them here I don't mean rude like okay you don't like what I said I can back it up with the quote I don't mean that but the prophet of God shows us my brother and sisters so clearly how in the day that we are living the culmination of all the spirits of the ages all of Satan's plan for the ages is all coming together he's looking now the book says different but he's ignoring the book just like many Christians do that's right but we got to be fully persuaded in laa not just one bit of Doubt because we have one bit of Doubt Satan exploits that little doubt now I'll tell you let me just share with you about this Hawk for just one more time we'll move on we're harvesting corn if any of you ever been around a self-propelled Chopper uh they are so loud you can't hardly hear yourself talk if you're standing outside of one and one day I was chopping corn just right probably not a hundred yards from the tree where this Hawk lives and as I'm going up the road there this great big Mouse runs out I mean a huge mouse and he runs out about four rows from the head of this chop I can see him out in front of me right here and here comes this Hawk just flying down got his wings tucked in and his feet out he's looking at lunch but did you know that I and the hawk got to the mouse time and when the hawk was probably three foot off the ground he flared away from the chopper just a little bit he didn't go away and say I'm not a hawk any longer he didn't say I have no courage he didn't say I'm not hungry he just flared away from it because he felt intimidated he felt overwhelmed he felt distracted and I got to witness this that he missed that Mouse by about that much but he missed it if he' have stayed the course he wouldn't have got hurt you know three or four rows you know is you know here to the wall he had plenty of space but he allowed all the DraStic radical things that were happening around him for just a moment he veered away from what was the course that he had said are you with me yeah amen Leia lot is happening people asking questions how long before they kick us out of our churches brother Paul I'm not concerned about how long it is before they kick me out of our church kick us out of our church I'm not concerned with that I'm concerned with God helping me in the age that I live in and my weaknesses and my fa faur and my fears and my shortcomings oh can we talk like that amen I'm not concerned when they come and try to turn this into a warehouse or an office or whatever else that that doesn't matter what I want is the Holy Ghost to come and meet me in my weakness I want God to come down and meet me in my battle I want God to come down and meet me in my time of need and in that time of need he'll meet me once again amen he promised that he would it's not about well God did it once and we got to go on and just face he said they do Greater Works than these my brother and sister I believe it Hallelujah see we're in the last the most wicked of all the ages now look here in Colossians wrote this scripture right here for us didn't they for I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you and for them amen at Le oysa mhm and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and in all Riches of the full Assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God and of the father and of Christ in whom are HID all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge and this I say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words you see my brother and sister you can trace the roots of those back and realize that when someone takes you out of this scripture on the words that someone said someone said that's it they're beguiling you that's they are persuading you and that is Satan's greatest gift that he have is he's so subtle with words he's so clever he can word it in such a way that you would look at this and say well you know this would be all right this would be okay this would this wouldn't be bad see how Satan how clever he is to do this persuading I remember one time if I could just share this quickly a Salesman showed up at our farm shop one day he had some good products he really did but you see as Christians sometimes we just have to practice what we preach we have to practice what we've heard preached and this salesman get this brother Trevor he said can I have a few minutes of your time and I said sure come to the office we walked in the office we sat down and he looked across the desk at me and he said I won't be leaving here today till I have sold you a product and I went you will be leaving here today and selling me nothing because you see he was so confident but you know his problem was he didn't say our products see here's the difference this is a subtility that Satan uses with the word of God just in a in a carnal form he didn't come saying our products are so good that you just can't live without them they will sells to you he come I yeah am so good I will sell you a product something in me says you know what that's kind of probably kind of what happened in the garden yeah yep oh that old serpent come waling in there he didn't oh look I I'm not trying to be funny but I do find it humorous most of us as men trying to court a wife we're all awkward driving you know taking them out to eat and my your hair looks the best I've ever seen today the girls thinking really I looked in the mirror and thought it was horrible and we as men just keep putting our foot in our mouth putting our foot in her mouth our foot in our mouth but not not the serpent he come in the garden hey Eve you sweet little thing I've got the answer for you I've got more knowledge Eve than you do I've got more Revelation than you do I've got everything you need so subtle yeah amen yay didn't God say see he knew to pull the word right in as part of the equation cuz without the word he wouldn't be able to get through a defense but she was there oh yes God said my brother and sister God said it is right God said right H now that's a whole another subject and I'm getting veered off here and it's time to close my mind I'm starting to remember there's always another Sunday hallelujah it's a hard memory it's a hard memory but you see my brother and sister he said lest any man man should beguile you with enticing words look Saints the day I start preaching to you or the brothers in this church start preaching to you hey we've we're the bride we've got it made just live any way you want just go out here God understands it's all settled you you either leave or kick us out that's right it comes down that simple we're not here to beguile you with words in fact like I shared with you some time back a quote from Spurgeon and he basically I don't remember exact words right now but he said if you don't make somebody mad in church then you done your job so I don't know if anybody's mad or not today but I'm going to try hallelujah oh not really see these beguiling words is to persuade to come to shift your direction to to bring you in he says though I was absent in the flesh yet I was with you in spirit joying and beholding your order and the steadfastness steadfastness of your faith in Christ and as you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk in him you see we don't need some new fascinating flashy Revelation to get us in a rapture we need to just walk steadfast in Jesus Christ amen rooted and built up in him established in the faith as you have been taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the TR tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily oh hallelujah amen and did you read that last verse amen oh my I tell you what I practically tore my office up this morning I just is so excites me my brother and sister when I read this amen and Paul is complete in him that's right amen and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power we are not looking someday to be complete my brother and sister we're looking for what is already in us to be completely revealed amen not another gospel amen but this Gospel of Jesus Christ that's what we need Hallelujah not to be looking my brother and sister of the next thing that will come to get us excited enough to have a prayer life the next thing that gets us excited enough to read our Bible the next thing that gets excited enough to get us in church the next thing that gets us excited enough to pray for others my brother and sister no that's not what we're looking for that's already there we need to be convinced amen we need to be persuaded that this is who we are and this is what we're called for Hallelujah now remember we've gone into this but I want to touch on it once again two spirits in the church amen two groups persuaded or not persuaded amen I'm going to just speak real strong before we close if we're persuaded then God is worthy of our best amen now I'm going to speak kind of direct okay you're not going to convince me you're persuaded when you don't give anything close to your best amen now you can say that's none of your business Paul and I have to say you're right but I'm doing my part are you doing your part if you are persuaded you will give the best of who you are Amen to Jesus Christ amen amen you will you will count him worthy of your praise you'll count him of worthy of Praise You oh Hallelujah that list could just go on forever amen you count him worthy of your prayers you know when you won't pray what you're telling God think about it I'm not praying because if I pray it won't make any difference anyhow come on that's right well you can put any word you want to it I'm lazy I'm unmotivated I'm whatever it is but if you are persuaded my brother and sister that your prayer makes a difference then you will be lifting your prayer Before the Throne of God Amen if you are persuaded that reading your Bible makes a difference then you will be reading your Bible amen if you are persuaded that your praise and your worship makes a difference and the word says it comes as a sweet odor Before the Throne of almighty God if you're persuaded that your prayers are a sweet odor Before the Throne of God you will pray amen if you're persuaded my brother and sister that following the word of God being obedient to the word of God makes a difference then you will be obedient but people say well I believe this but I I'm not so sure about this and I could I could go for this but I I don't know about this that's what brother Brown said I'm not reading it as a quote to you but that's what he said amen but when you're persuaded and the word says you're going to say that was there for a purpose I'm going to be obedient to that oh and I see this oh over here even in the smallest of gifts coming to me I say thank you Lord for this good gift but brother Jones gave it to you I know but but God anointed brother Jones to give it to me so provided for brother Jones to me I say thank you Lord hallelujah when you're persuaded of these things Saints it will change our approach no no more half-hearted no more just kind of bumbling along we will stand and that oh I know I forgot I'm preaching the message of the fanatic excuse me let me get back to the average Church who wants to be average the average Church said um isn't Elijah supposed to come the average Church says you owe it to me to give me some oil in my lamp I almost preached a sermon here recently called The Selfish Christian that's what the world's going to call you they're going to call you selfish cuz you won't share your oil right that's exactly right but you see without going into it it's your oil that's right you're the one that prayed for it you're the one that labored for it you're the one that sacrificed for it you're the one that obeyed the word of God for that because why you were persuaded amen you didn't have a half-hearted approach to the word of the day amen you didn't just kind of go well you know this may or may not matter you decided it matter I'll come and move on with this God is worthy of our best I would thought I might get a Hallelujah out of somebody on that but here they're now up in this Upper Room in the presence of God then all of a sudden Here Comes This Holy Spirit down from heaven and it quickened them and the quickening took place and they wasn't afraid to make a witness of the message that they believed and know to be the truth otherwise they were afraid of it yes sir come on sir we can say Amen to that I can tell you my brother and sister many years ago driving truck setting into a truck stop one night and a man sat down at the table across from me I was all bummed out depressed lonely way you know way long ways from home and I I wasn't happy camper my own self and this man sits down after he's totally sat down he looks up at me and says oh I hope you don't mind me sitting here I didn't have the courage to tell him yes I do mind I just kind of went whatever then he proceeds to tell me about his daughter that's went haywire his son that's went haywire and a wife that was headed haywired and how he didn't even know how to relate to them and he realized that a lot of their problem was him and how he approached things and what was going on in his life and how that his grandmother took him to church when he was a young man and and how she tried to get him to keep going to church but he turned away from it because of friends yeah and here he was 45 or so years old and questioning what do I need to do to get my life straightened out and to my shame Saints I just spoke real vaguely to him well find you a church read your Bible it haunted me for years that I had an Open Door in front of me now what does he say right here this quickening made them where they wasn't afraid to make a wit of the message that they believed you cannot be persuaded Saints and not share this gospel amen amen all I could do after we had went our ways down the road I woke up the next day I looked around the man's truck he was gone I prayed Saints for years that that man would meet someone who had the courage to sit in a crowded truck stop and not care about all kinds of heathens and languages and whatever else and tell the man what he was searching for amen God help us amen amen amen hallelujah I I just want to say thank you Lord I I no longer have that Reserve cuz you figure out most everybody thinks you're weird anyway Hallelujah but that ain't the right that's not the excuse but they think you're weird anyway you know the first minute you speak you're a Christian and you go to church faithful and you believe Jesus Christ and you have the Holy Ghost they're just like oh okay but the one that you're speaking to that's the only one that matters the one you're speaking to amen amen Jesus never got to the woman at the well and said well now what we need to do is find out what the people in town think about you and then if they think well of you where you could go and share the this then I'm going to witness and give you Deliverance No all he cared about was her but when something happened to her she jumped up run down to town went running right through the town and says come and see come and see come and see the man that told me all about my life and some of them said she Something's Happened Here I think I'll wander up to the well just to see what it is she's rambling about that's right but she didn't just go and quietly changed she verbal it amen amen oh hallelujah sister Emmy would you come otherwise they're afraid of it how many Presbyterians how many methodists how many Baptists in the world today how many message Believers I mean how many Pentecostals that knows the truth and afraid to make a stand on it I'm persuaded to wonder what was that fell on you are you a part of his resurrection would you dare scream off for some man's Theory or idea h you know that would be like more of a modern day there might be some of you would be knowledged to this but quite a few years ago there was a man a church ended up in Durango [Music] Colorado Saints I only share this because it's like a burden that's still labors on my [Music] heart Drew all these people to him even come one day with a sword claimed that God placed that in his hand they had the word of the Lord thus sayith the Lord all other Ministry all other messages all other whatever were all faults he was commissioned to take the bride in Rapture I won't go into it things happen things go down the road God opened the door one day I went through their town in the semi in the middle of the winter I was friends with this young man and I stopped and we went out to [Music] eat he pressed upon me persuaded me to spend the night in their home instead of sleeping in the truck and that evening as we're sitting there he offered me he says I I've been given by this brother I've been given this commission to extend to you you see they believed it was all over that only those that were in and their little belief was in but my invitation only they could extend a position in the bride of Christ to me and my wife and my children by me accepting their offer [Music] sounded [Music] good it's all finished no more sin no Behavior no thoughts no Deeds held against you it's all finished live any way you please sounded good didn't it we can just go out and live any old way call ourselves the bride of Christ and he laid this whole thing out Saints and I'm not making light of this my heart Grieves in fact sister Jerry uh could tell you that I just brought it up off my heart a couple days ago he lays it all out the reasons why I should do this and all I could do is look at him and say show it to me in the scripture that's all that's going to matter if you can show this to me in the scripture I'll look at it otherwise I'm not interested and he said words it's a revelation then I did my best Saints round two I got my did my best to persuade him go back to the word go back to the Bible go back to the message stand on that go back to the original did you know brother sisters it's never an easy path we have to walk it's not I I say it's never easy God anointed I say this is the Lord I sure wouldn't have said it in my own flesh I said some very very very strong words to him that night and I closed it out with what might seem to be rude I closed it out with if that's what you think is the [Music] truth this is the we've all been deceived do you know this man who had this great gift of God about 3 years later ran off with my friend's wife destroyed his family took all of his money everything just cleaned the clock on him you think that made me happy see I was right see I was right no my heart Grieves Amen to this day it Grieves amen and I tried to reconcile him after that tried to do that and he won't even answer a phone if I call him I'm done I'm finished I'm out of his thoughts but you see brothers and sisters we got to come down to a time where we're fully persuaded amen there's no room for nothing else to be placed in there and I say nothing else there's always room for more Revelation from the Lord but I'm talking about any man's ideas we come down we're fully persuaded this is what God sent for this this is what he called but I've got a brother I've got a sister I've got a cousin I've got a mom a dad I've got a child that says this is nonsense that's fine that's their Revelation what did God speak to you instead of sitting there and trying to figure out what they're saying whether it's right or wrong why don't you go back to the word of God become fully persuaded that this word is Right amen but you scare scream off on some man's Theory or idea or have you got the real boldness and the real manhood it takes to stand out call right right and wrong wrong are you a part of the Resurrection or are you a worshipper of a bunch of Creeds are you a goer to church do you have your name on there and dead in sin and trespasses he that believes not the full word of God is a sinner did you catch that the full word of God those Pharisees believed in many things to be truth they said we are God's children and they were until that word was preached but when that word was preached preached and Vindicated then they become Sinners for rejecting the thing that they knowed was right and witness that we know thou are a teacher come from God and no man can do the things that you do without God being with you and I wonder today where are we at I ask you where is this Resurrection finding us are you D to step out are you D to take God at his words if you're ordained to life you surely will do it if you're an eagle that's me Hallelujah you can't help doing it there is something in you or do you want to just serve a Creed somewhere and say I go to church I'm just as good as you are if somebody give me 20 bucks for every time I have heard that I would take youall for lunch today see if I hold no birthrights you'll never see it if you hold no birthrights you'll never see it you can't see it but if you do hold possession of this Birthright you can't help from seeing it because it's part of you and you're part of it hallelujah hallelujah I'll tell you today Saints I am fully persuaded that I am a part of it and it is a part of me Hallelujah I'm not interested in some guy's version that they heard over a a table in a restaurant I'm not interested in who said what when where and how what I'm interested is and I I say this politely bring this out bring this out this is our absolute this is what I'm persuaded of Hallelujah now this come out a little different you know what I preached this to myself in the office this morning I was a lot happier than I seem to be right now but my brother and sister it actually this word makes me happy because when I recognize that it's not my understanding my knowledge my reasoning but it's the anointing of God that keeps pulling me back to the word amen I tell you I I I I I don't want to sound like I have any thing more than any of you do but I just have my experience I just have what I've been through life what I've seen how it's come about the things that I thought oh and start to go a certain direction and it seemed like God cut it off and then I'd be almost like all hurt you know like well well uh uh and then go over here and God cut it off and God cut it off and then I woke woke up one day and said thank you Lord for cutting it off because you see God said I'll lead you and guide you now I know this is a silly analogy forgive me you guys know how I am but I'm telling you my brother and sister when you lead someone as it were an animal or whatever you know they might wander a little bit to the leash this way and a little bit to the leash this way I tell you I guess I could use our Teddy dog for an example and that would be you're holding on to the leash and it's like but ultimately my brother and sister God's got the leash on us oh that don't sound very good you were predestinated that's right God knew that when he anointed you you would follow that's right oh Hallelujah don't you love uh predestination amen he didn't say I'm going to make them follow Hallelujah I'm going to make my dog walk in exact Footprints no you don't but the truth is God put a leash on us long time ago for the foundation of the world he said I'm not worried about you getting away I know right where you're going to end up hallelujah oh let's sing a song or two brother Jason come Hallelujah my I'm sorry I hope this didn't come across Chompy but you see when you got a sermon and you got so much stuff and then you got to bring out the prunes and start cutting away yeah cuz I'm trying to break this bad reputation but I tell you what my brother and sisters there's something I won't break and that's the leadership of the Holy Ghost let's stay with that leadership let's not let any influence of man let's not let our carnal life here well I got to go home and take a nap cuz I got to go to work tomorrow that's right well Hallelujah there'll be people going to work right after the Rapture happened you don't want to be one of those amen hallelujah so let's just set ourselves up for a Rapture not set ourselves up for work oh he hath forgiven me Hallelujah let's just stand and Worship the Lord for a minute Saints he oh [Music] he oh I say half it's has Amen in Idaho English that's the same word he oh just Worship the Lord thank him today for me my sins have been wash from his meory by the blood of the Lamb of C all he he has for forgiv me he has forgi me my sins have been washed from his meory by the blood of the Lamb of calary I know he he has forgiv me one more time he has forgi me of this I am my sin have been W nothing going to CH his Hallelujah Hallelujah by the blood of the land of Cal oh he has forgiv me oh magnify the Lord with me for he is worthy to be praised you know I'm con I'm persuaded Saints I'm persuaded that's why sometimes you'll see brother Paul maybe looks a little silly I get a little excited my brother and sister the reason is I'm persuaded and the reality of what I'm seeing of what I'm persuaded of is so beyond on this world that's right it is so beyond what I experience you know what for headed I don't know post 30 years or so I've been putting seed in the ground as a farmer had a young man one time asked me a question young Christian believer he said brother Paul when you put that seed in the ground how do you know it's going to to [Music] grow well son let me explain to you bioscience we have germplasm we have starch we have all these different membranes and different things that I can't even pronounce them correctly and uh what we're going to do is now talk about how that the skin of a corn seed draws moisture it doesn't sit and wait for moisture it draws moisture H anyway so we preach part two here this morning smart young man I said her you can hear the other side and he said I want to hear the other side the life is in the seed that's right you know how you check germ on corn you got corn that's been in a bag maybe carried over from the next year you want to make sure it's good you take an egg crate kids it's actually a really cool science project I'll get you corn seed if you want to do it you take an egg crate and you put a cotton ball in the bottom you put a corn seed on top of it you don't even have to put a cotton ball on top of it but it's best or a wet paper towel and then you just keep it wet it don't even have dirt it don't even have dirt did you get that it don't even have dirt but because there's life in it it will grow amen hallelujah pretty cool cuz if you keep it the right atmosphere the right temperature it will put out a whole root and start to sprout just like it would if it was in the right atmosphere but I tell you what if you don't get it out denominational egg crate quick enough find some real soil to put it in it's done hallelujah well praise the Lord the life is in the seed and the seed is in you amen hallelujah ohy the Lord with oh yes Lord let me magnify you Lord he is worthy to be praised oh magnify the Lord with me for he is worthy to be praised hosana Blessed Be The Rock

individuals that's when Satan would come and start to speak the words to try to persuade you I don't care what that man or that woman says have courage enough to say okay I'll go back to my Bible and I'll compare that that's right you see anyone can tell you anything that's right anyone can tell you anything fact check it that's right amen AR aren't we good this day and age where you see something you know you folks that that like to anyway I'll keep my mouth shut there well Betsy L said how do you know that well I can't remember if it was on this book that book Facebook uh Graham here and insta something there I don't remember it was on a Snapchat I don't remember if it was on a puffy or I don't remember what it was but but am Betsy said [Music] it a Betsy it's not right I know it is cuz your great an Ethel told me H okay so if someone tries to tell you why don't you have courage fact check it I mean after all it's only your soul that you're gambling [Music] with reminds me of a cowboy Story Once A man was gambling laid everything he owned but his Spurs on the table and they said why'd you keep the Spurs but got rid of your horse he said I might find another horse [Music] someday well wait why didn't he keep the horse he could find some spurs someday or better yet why didn't he keep his money and forget about all of that but you see in the moment in the moment you see the CO's coming Saints in another wave through the message the [Music] virus and it makes all these cute little videos they're well fought out they're well done and they lay out these facts what is fact what is fact Saints I'll tell you what I'm going to fact check it if it won't P pass the test have courage enough to look at that person tell them they need to find an altar somewhere they need to go back to the word of God and quit looking for something fabulous looking for something new something more spectacular you say where you getting at brother Paul I'm getting at this point right here brother Brown said I never ever once tried to get you to follow me that's right I've pointed you to Jesus Christ now I want you to fact check it and see whether they're pointing you to Christ or not see the spirit of the age is willing to convince you to step away from but where are they taking you that's it I say this a little bit in humor but a true story sister Jerry and I one time got on a plane Salt Lake City we're flying to boisee they said four or five times this plane's going to boisey we're in the air not a very long flight from Salt Lake City to boisey and we're in the air the
