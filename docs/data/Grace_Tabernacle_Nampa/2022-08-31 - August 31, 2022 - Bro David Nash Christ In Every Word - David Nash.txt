and ain't what i want to be but i'm sure not what i so praise god for that promise that we can stand on tonight before i forget i usually do which i shouldn't but greetings from my family my wife was the air conditioner went out today and after sitting in 92 degrees heat the whole day she was honey the the back the little air conditioner in the back works she goes i got to just sit here so she's at home listening online and getting cooled back down but also the little church in tri-cities we've had a few bumps and bruises lately we uh some thieves broke in and took all of our internet equipment and stuff and i told the church that i said we must have done something really right because he don't like us as little as we are he doesn't want anybody out there to know what we're talking about so praise the lord and then come to find out the policemen that came and looked at it they're going this is so peculiar because they left the audio equipment the old audio equipment called the new stuff but they even took the took all the janitorial supplies they left us one roll of paper towels for the bathroom and one roll of toilet paper i don't know what that's got to do [Laughter] with anything but they even took the mop in the mop bucket but so i was talking this last a few days ago to brother jonah emke and i got to tell him and he goes brother he goes the exact same thing happened to us two months ago i said really and he goes yeah and they because they had taken our audio equipment and left it outside in the parking lot he said they even left our audio equipment on the stairs of the church i'm going now that's peculiar so i told brother jim when we got to church on sunday and he goes that makes me actually feel pretty good because the policeman had told us it was a professional job so at least the professionals are after us it's not just kids but uh he said he was talking to a friend in mount vernon oregon and they had an almost an identical experience so that well praise the lord the devil's mad about something and i'm glad to be on his bad list i guess i'm happy to be on god's list let's uh go ahead and read the scriptures so you can be seated again greetings from the folks up there i know they love you and get here anytime they can and always enjoy it let's uh i told the brother genesis 1 1 but i want to start with genesis 1 and 31 and then we'll drop back and it reads as we read it as gentiles it said and god saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day lord jesus we've read your scripture may you bless it now to the hearts of the people in the name of jesus christ amen please be seated when i think about scripture and we know brother branham used the word bible i think it was i know we've looked it up before i think it's like 13 000 times the message of the hour is about this book and when people come up with doctrines or you know what talks about every wind of doctrine and so forth when they come up with those things if you can't find it in this book forget it it's just nonsense it's man's ideas it's not god because in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god and this is called the word of god scripture itself tells us that every word is inspired to give us some portion each day and then as a as we we look at it too another place you know brother branham said that we have to remember that it's an eastern book and we're looking at it through western eyes and even the way we read it as you can see there it says and god saw that everything he had made and behold it was very good in the evening in the morning with the sixth day but the hebrew read from the right to the left or often times from the last to the first so you could be looking at that and say the morning or in the sixth day where there was morning and evening it was very good and god saw that he had made it and behold that means to look at it it was very good and the word actually there where it says very that word in hebrew is feminine in other words it's very passionately good it's not just a little bit good it's passionately good and so i thought about as i was looking at this and thinking about it and how that we've read the church age book we've got the seven seals book we've heard the messages and those things and how that god slips things in sometimes so beautiful and so correct and if we read through the you're going through the church age book and you're coming up into it and you're looking at that sixth church age and we know that that's the i believe it's what philadelphia and it's the uh you know men being nice to each other and uh how that that philadelphia age brotherly love i think it is their brotherly kindness however it reads and that it was in that sixth age that it comes all the way up through brotherly kindness and that during that sixth age there was something very good and that very good notice it doesn't say that there was a day and a night it says that there was an evening and a morning at the sixth day why doesn't it say day at night it gives you the start of the day the morning it gives you the close of the day the evening and it comes in the sixth day and god said it's really good ah vehemently good and he sees it and he says behold it behold look at it look at it and see the evening and the morning of the sixth day it's at the end of the sixth church age as we know it that we start into the seventh church age which we all know the time in the day that we're living is laodicea or lady you see us he used the word sometimes and how that it's the age of people's rights brother adam used to say you know we all have our rights and we all want our right for this and our right for that but he said what about god's rights so at this end of this sixth age there's an evening and a morning and well think about the scripture evening just a moment and think about where it came about it starts about at the end of the sixth day because in the evening time there shall be light so in this sixth day in the evening the light begins to come forth and as that light begins to come forth it says there's an evening and a morning of the sixth day well if we continue to read actually the first verse of the the second chapter says the thus of the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them so that's not talking about the seventh day yet that first scripture in the next chapter is actually still talking about this same scripture it's talking about the heavens and the earth being finished and all of the host of them so the finishing touches on this all comes as we're going into the seventh age which is the day of rest as you begin to read it says the seventh day god ended his work and he rested on the seventh day of everything that he had made and we see an elijah ministry in that previous verse an evening there was an evening time going into a laodicean church a time of people's rights but so likewise did does god have rights and in that in those rights he has purchased as it were the bride of jesus christ and it said this if i can call it a time period that he's taking the bride of jesus christ into the rest into a rest not like we go to bed at night and whether you have a good night bad night whatever it is you wake up sometimes you're still tired i've never have you figured that out brother paul i just wow what happened i thought i slept pretty good but no it's not that kind of rest it's an entire it's over the things of this day and this world and this time and all of the sin and the destruction and the evil and the hatred it's all over he is taking the bride of jesus christ by an evening time message he makes an announcement have you ever heard the message it's the rising of the sun the rising of the sun what's he talk about in that message well he talks about resurrection he talks about resurrection day it's an easter message and he talks about the resurrection and the resurrection day and all the things that are accompanying that and even talks about the little uh the little robin and how that that robin when he refers back to jesus christ and when he was on calvary calvary and how that little robin was a little brown bird and when it tried to pull the nails out it got its breast red from the blood of jesus christ then he tells us it's the rising of the sun it's the resurrection day it's the time that we are moving into the rest of the as here it says the seventh day he rested or the but if we read it like i said the way the hebrews read it it comes across slightly different so how did we get there and we know that every word of god brother branham said has compound meaning compound revelation and how that if with compound revelation just to explain it a little bit we're three-part people i have an outside body and you know you bang your knuckles and it hurts and you get if you're working on trucks you get your fingernails all dirty and you know all those things that we deal with with this fleshly realm the sea taste here feel smell and we deal with those things and there's that level and there's scripture that deals specifically with the works of the flesh but behind the flesh there's a spirit within us that moves this man to do what he does that moves you to do what it does there's a spirit in you that does that and there are certain scriptures that speak specifically to the spirit of man and to the spirit that dwells inside of us i always think of that song creating me a clean heart and renew a right spirit a spirit that's correct that's upright before god and so we know that there's certain things that as we read it we can read it one way one time and it might apply to well what are you doing man what are you letting that flesh run you around for and the next time it's like wow why did i get so angry about that it wasn't my flesh that got angry it was the spirit that was in me for whatever reason it might be just anger brother branham said you know if you got that bus buzzsaw uh kind of temper you need to pray to get rid of it so that it applies to that and he said but and so but sometimes there's also righteous indignation wherein even god said he hated not the nicolaitans but he hates the deeds that they do he hates what they're doing because they separate the congregation from jesus christ it's a love affair with jesus christ every single one of us must know jesus christ personally he said you you must be born again but he said how can and he said how can i go back to the womb and he said the scribe of israel or you know a master of israel and you don't know the answer to that question and you can refer back to the book of ezekiel he talks about it so there's that but then there's yet another realm and the further i go the more i want and i long to break into that we call it the soul realm or the soul that's the other part brother branham said the soul is the nature of the spirit in other words whatever is in the soul or the desire is what's going to move the spirit to do the things that it does and so if the nature you know brother branham talked about oh and you know paul being a farmer he can tell you if it's a cockle brewer it's going to bring you a cuckle burr and if it's a wheat it's going to bring wheat or sugar beet's going to be a sugar beet it's not going to be a pineapple because that's the nature that's in the seed well the nature that's in the seed the seed for us is jesus christ and he is called the word of god in fact i think it's in i want to say it's in john in the parable jesus said my word is a seed and that seed has a particular nature and when that seed was planted in the days of paul it had the apostle paul it had a certain nature about it and he even gives us the explanation again from ezekiel who's called the son of man by the way hey son of man talks about him several times so we know that again refers to this age the book of ezekiel ezekiel was yeah he was a you could say a prophet to israel but he was also a prophet to the gentiles because he was by the river chiba in babylon but he had a specific prophecy when he saw the pillar of fire when he saw god come down in that prophetic portion he said well there was four faces or you could say natures or personalities to that spirit of god he said there's a man an ox a lion and an eagle well that seed that went down in the days of the apostle paul and the other apostles that first church we find out from the message the hour it was the spirit of the lion or it was the nature of the lion it wouldn't it would not be denied they didn't care what happened they didn't care what was going to happen to them or anything and they sold everything they got all everything together and they just you know and when the persecution came there's some people say well they did the wrong thing and selling their houses brother random said no they did the right thing because they had nowhere to go and they would have to go out and pre into all the world and preach the gospel and it was the spirit of the lion the fierceness of how the you know god and even that group that came uh are the two people that came and they sold the property and and how that spirit of a lion and they lied about it and when they lied to the holy ghost peter with the spirit of the lion said what are you doing and they died right on the spot by how by the word of god it was the spirit of the lion on those people well we know as time went on that personality or that soul began to change and as the persecution intensified it didn't change the the the holy spirit but the nature of how the spirit affected those going into that next age was just lay your life down just lay it down don't fight don't struggle with it don't even you know try to rebuke it just and i think i want to say it was poly carp and i could be wrong but it's one of those men and when they cast him into the lions you know they say he just tore his shirt open and said oh beasts of the field come run these bones wow what a nature i don't know if i could do that you know i might be headed up through the stands or something because that's not my nature we have a different nature we have a different personality type in this day and age well we know from there it moved on to and if you read closely in the fox's book of martyrs it's talking about all those people that laid down their lives and laid down their lives and there's one certain place you can all of a sudden see the beginning of the change for the church of god how that that personality that soul that nature began to change because it says that the you know the pope sent out his armies and such to wipe out this one village forgot what country it was in and they're going up the mountain they're all going to kill them they're probably just expecting well these guys are all just going to lay down and die right and one guy i don't think it even gives his name in the book one guy is looking at this going and he turns to the other guys we don't have to put up with this what's he thinking the spirit the nature is changing and it says they threw so many rocks at them they actually drove an army away from their village because the nature had changed we're not going to put up with this we're not going to just lay it down we've got brains enough to know we don't have to put up with you anymore we know and how that moved through the and it went into their church age messenger martin luther then how did that that spirit of the man that god's thought of man and how that it uh permeated through that those church ages the next coming up through there and how that it went on into that sixth church age it went on into the sixth church age and when it went into the sixth church age god said it's good and at the end of that time there's a morning and there's an evening and we have a prophetic message and if i was to break down some of the meanings there from the hebrew dictionary there's things that are in there like it it says that uh straight it mentions straight and where it says evening it's not just like the setting of the sun i believe evening if i remember rightly and the hebrew has about seven different meanings it's like john the baptist said every mountain will be brought low and every valley will be brought up they will be made even and the prophet isaiah speaking of an elijah ministry said there's going to run upon plumb line that everything be made even you see the word of god was coming forth coming forth and there's a soul realm that we enter into when we come into the presence of jesus christ and we have a word that we are to fulfill in our day in our lives and in our time frame and that word is the words or the the nature of the eagle prophet gave us some hints to what that nature would be about talked about the eagle that was in the barnyard with the chickens and he didn't like that food he was eating what's the matter and all the other chickens they kind of probably left you know he's a little strange looking he don't look like us and he sure don't like our food and we're really having a good time with it and the eagle is like what i don't know what he was looking for maybe he'd find a little bit of meat in a worm or something but we don't really know but he didn't like that food but when he heard a specific voice brother branham said he looked up he said what's that voice voice sounds familiar to me that voice is the same voice that's in me because he could make the c he answered it same voice and when mama eagle heard that voice she just said jump just jump and when he jumped he was able to make it under the i believe brother branham said the fence post he got to a certain level don't stay on the fence post people because the next time it said just jump again and this time she said spread your wings brother branham's wings are the wings of the old and new testament spread your wings in the very winds another place when he was talking about the one that had been blown down and he was in the thicket brother venomous spoke to him and said you know i could shoot you and he said before he could even get his gun up he said that eagle jumped once set its wings in the very wind or storm that had driven it down took him up he said i couldn't even got a shot off it's a different nature we have the ability to fly when we realize we've heard an evening message and it's to set our lives even or founded be not tossed about with every wind of doctrine don't jump up and down and up and down no get your feet settled in the word of god and your wings open and set them into the trials and the winds oh friends they're heavy out there i you go i meant i know i've mentioned this before you're going like walmart what are you doing here continuously not just walmart i'm just saying that because that's one place i hear it but it's in the grocery store it's at the drive-in you know where you get the the ice cream or whatever everywhere we go what they got the rock and roll music just and it's not just the music it's the words when i find myself in times of trouble mother mary comes to me false doctrine you are being indoctrinated by the things of the world a false doctrine and you're here to almost you know you might not hear that same song every day but you hear something else or you hear the oh i just love them so much man woman worship you ever read from isaiah i want to say it 61 where it says your your children will run you and the women let me let me let's just read that i know i spoke on not too long ago isaiah third chapter i don't know are you interpreting brother where'd he go isaiah third chapter we'll just take this real quick to let you know what you're being indoctrinated with it's isaiah the third chapter and it's 12 verses 12 and 13. verse 11 talks about the reward of the wicked and uh verse 12 as for my people children are their oppressors and women rule over them oh my people they which lead thee cause thee to air and destroy the way of thy paths the lord standeth up to plead and he stands to judge the people now wait a minute children are their oppressors i know some people that a woman in particular that kind of comes to mind they wanted to take her kids away from her because one of the kids complained that she wouldn't let him do a certain thing she had to go through all kinds of crazy stuff to keep her kids the child had become the oppressor in that particular situation but it goes beyond that because now we're looking at again we one of those levels we're looking at that top level actually in the flesh and it says that you know children become their oppression oppressors and women rule over them so their children okay there is a natural realm to that and they even you know you say the your kid says the wrong thing at school you might get a you know knock on the door from child protective services because the children are trying they're oppressing and they're they're oppressing because of well because of the music because of the the televisions because of the styles because of all things that's going on but it even goes beyond that because there's another set of children that are the oppressors those those that are involved in satan's trinity money religion money religion and banking and they will oppress you brother they're in louisiana uh brother jeremy he works for a bank we were talking a little bit one night he said brother that's all he didn't say don't try but he said you know it's it's it's set up to where the bank always wins so if you don't win don't feel bad because that's the way it's set up and that's the children the bible talks about the children of the world being smarter than the children of the kingdom and the children become the oppressors and women rule over them well it's not we can see it obviously in the natural realm the women's rights movement and all of those things that go with that we even have a female vice president now or so-called and so they say well women rule but it goes beyond that because the woman also types a church system and that church system is seeking to rule over you doctrinally doctrinally spiritually uh as the sister came in and i love that song give thanks with a grateful heart love that song happened to run into it you know i was looking for some nice music on youtube oh there's that song i love it and you get to a little part in it when it's either this getting ready to finish or start or whatever it is and they were using that song to celebrate the visitation of the pope a beautiful christian song and they're trying to rule over it by a church system and he says oh my people they cause thee to air and to destroy the way of thy paths what's our way it's supposed to be the ways of god what angered god at the days of moses he said i'm they'll never enter into my rest he said because they never understood my ways our way is the pathway of god praise the lord are you okay are we i don't have a clue and i guess we're okay we're 20 something minutes and i'm not here to eat up your time but uh i also wanted to mention one other thing when the brother spoke i really enjoyed the service last week with brother chris and and i've enjoyed brother paul with the last couple he's done nice to be here but he's the the the word destiny and so if you see me sometimes in church and i'm playing with my cell phone i'm really not texting my kids i'll be i was so intrigued by the word that he used i mean is that in the bible so i'm searching the bible it's not in there the word destiny isn't there but the root of that word is did you know that in the word pre-destination in other words in the mind of god he knew what your journey would be to bring you to an expected end that's what predestination or your destiny my destiny is and in the book of jeremiah it says i know my thoughts towards you there are thoughts of peace he knows what your journey will be he knows what you're going to need for the journey and he already gave it to us already provided wonderful song and how that he knows our steps he knows the path that we'll take and even though when it we hear that uh poem i think his foot footsteps on the sand who time and it said lord there's those places where there's only one set of footsteps why did you leave me he said i didn't leave you i was carrying you he said lo i am with you always even unto the end praise the lord are you okay let's turn then back okay we read 31 and how that verse 31 of genesis 1 and we realized that there's overlapping in these things brother branham said all those ages all that stuff overlap and the the the real rest is the what we would say the eighth day that's eternity that's a different probably that brother paul preached that one for you or brother chris or brother david but when we go back let's see how we get to where we can i'd like to think understand better this predestination or this walk and where it came from we know brother branham said in another place every scripture and i love this every scripture somehow points us to jesus christ and if we don't see jesus christ in it he said he better go back and read it again because he's there so let's look at genesis one maybe just take a few more minutes really he said in there and again in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth that's how it starts genesis 1 1. well it says in the word god in that sense there is elohim and the definition it gives for elohim is the judge the rule the divine one the angel god almighty strength power jehovah the one god so just in that one word we see a lot but and then the root words to that word god it comes from a hebrew number 352 which means the ram for food for sacrifice red dyed skin for the tabernacle the pillar the door post the jams the ballista plaster the mighty tree and it also has within that word if i can say this right prominence of the body the belly wealthy men and the origin is to twist and be strong or rolled together in power body and mighty strength all in that one word so we say yellow him and we know another and if again if you run it out it actually also means the self-existent one and how that in there is the ram and the pillars that hold up the door posts jesus said i am the door to the sheepfold and he's the pillars that hold it up he's the pillars he's and it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth again now the hebrew the heaven and the earth were in the beginning created by god or in god the beginning created he the heavens and the earth did i change anything only the direction of how we look at it can i come in brother adam said we can do this so i'm not fooling with you okay in god the beginning created the heaven and the earth in elohim the self-existent one in god the beginning so every scripture has to point us to jesus christ so inside of god we just read one of the definitions is the ram the ram so in god the ram in god the ra the ram who is the the beginning who's the beginning what's the revelation we have about the beginning you ever read revelations once you have one chapter 1 verse 8 i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending so in god the beginning that's jesus christ in god was jesus christ the bible said he was in god before he was slain before the foundation of the world that's scripture so in god jesus christ the beginning was slain before the foundation of the world and he created the heaven and the earth well there's the heaven there's all the heavenly bodies but there's more remember there's different levels we're looking at here he created the heavens and if you go on to read through genesis there it talks about the stars and the planets and all that stuff that's part of the heavenly bodies the natural heavenly bodies you know the bible says that all things were created by jesus christ because he was in god he's the nature of god flowing out to a world that became fallen and so in the heavens those things that he created or that he formed it says is one of the the definitions that he formed that he made that he took time brother branham uses the word brooded over brooded over what are we talking about when the chicken's brewed what happens they lay the eggs and the male comes to make sure the eggs are gonna hatch and he brooded over the heavens and the earth and what do we see well in the heavens there's a birth sign up there they call virgo stands for the virgin brother branham said that represents the virgin birth there's another birth sign over there that represents cancer he said that's part of the age that we're living in and that's why there's so much cancer in this age there's another one over there called leo the lion he said it's the lion of the tribe of judah brother branham said he wrote a bible in the sky so this in god the beginning when he created when he formed it when he brooded and put his seed into it and he made the heaven what is it it's a bible it's a bible in the sky every word every star represents something we know about how he talked about the north star and how the whole universe for us on this planet revolve around that star he said that's jesus christ and he wrote it in the heavens and he wrote it in the earth we see the trees they come from forth from a seed they have a certain life that's in the seed and the life that's in the seed if it's a pear tree it's not going to make pineapples or something else because the seed of god is in it and every seed brings forth of its own kind and how that it it grows from a little from a seed that has to die so it's type in jesus christ and then it resurrects and it comes up makes the the whatever tree that it is to make and in the the winter times we know the times and the seasons talks about in ecclesiastes and how the the life goes out of the tree and the life that goes out of the tree that falls on the ground through the leaves the needles whatever it is the fruit what is it it goes back into the soil and in the book of job it says at the smell of water it comes again and when the sun comes to a certain place when the angle of the light or the duration of the day whatever it is the scientists there's different schools on that but when it strikes just the right thing the life comes back into it what do we see in the earth in the nature of the earth the life death burial and resurrection of jesus christ every morning when you get up if that sun's coming up which way is east brother is it this way i thought okay to the east when that sun comes up then it goes through the sky through the sky today bad day for the air conditioner to go out 104 right but when it's set tonight and don't worry it'll be back tomorrow because again in the earth is the seed of the birth life death burial and resurrection of jesus christ okay where have we had time ways ten more minutes i hope that's all right i'd like to get you out of here by nine or maybe a few minutes before so we see that creation we see jesus christ in we see him as the beginning and the creator bible says in another place all things were created by him for him without him there was nothing made that was made he did it all in the spiritual or in the soul realm the manifestation of jesus christ brother branham said we got locked i don't see a accord here but he said we got locked in a loop of time and how that when adam fell he threw the whole human race into a loop of time and on that loop there's you know if i was he had a you know a cord i don't want to take anything apart there but uh you know if it was i was holding up a loop for you there was you know here was an abraham and a sarah and a and you start going down that loop of time and pretty soon you come across a david and a solomon and this king and that king and you go around that loop well eventually it comes around and it goes into a gentile dispensation and all those things in that loop of time and how that in that loop of time god is manifesting still jesus christ we see jesus christ in abraham we see jesus christ in david we see jesus christ in moses we see jesus christ in job and we could go on and on all night long even the scripture and i think it's hebrews chapter 11 says what if i had time to speak about this one and this one and this one and this one and this one because they were all manifesting jesus christ and so will you and i by the seed and the nature that we have been given the nature of the eagle the first group that got the holy ghost was the lion what's so special about the lion well he's the king of the beasts he is the king of the beasts on terra firma and between the king of the beasts of the terra firma you had the ox the sacrificial beast and you had the man and when it gets to the eagle why is the eagle so important because the eagle is the king of the air i remember coming across i think it was we'll be headed back to panama here lord willing at the end of september and uh i remember i think it was coming back from panama we're coming across the you know on the airplane you know the guru you know the engines are going a certain way and they come on there and they say okay we're just getting ready to descend and the engines cut back and i think they said we were i don't know i think they said thirty four thousand feet and we're going to start descent now and i happen to look out the window and above us was more clouds big thunder clouds they'll go way way up there they'll go 45 000 feet or so and i looked up and above that jet just dancing through the clouds was a great big bald eagle i thought he's got to be 36 38 000 feet and just like he's having fun the eagle is the king of the air friends where are we supposed to meet him and how are we going to meet him on the wings of the old and new testament seeing that jesus christ is in every word every scripture every nature that was imparted to jesus christ is imparted unto us by the seed that dwelleth in us read 1st john the seed that dwelleth in us praise the lord well quickly let's turn to genesis chapter 26. i'll see if i can get through this fast because it'll help you to learn help us to learn how me to learn who we really are in or verse actually genesis 2 and 26 i said one i meant two so in genesis the second chapter now we've seen you know all the things that he made and then he prophesies of the of the seventh day of rest and being sanctified and such and in the seventh verse whoops i am wrong i'm sorry it's the first chapter i wanted to go to first and it's 20 but it's still it's verse 26 that's what it is genesis 1 verse 26 and god said so god is speaking something when god speaks it's the word of god so god says let us make man in our image the trinitarians love that because this is a plural word oh see it's three gods no it's not three gods get that out of your mind no after our likeness he said let us make man in our image and the word man there is human being mankind or ruddy which means takes from another word to be red to be rubbed red dyed red show red glare whoa to show blood to flesh or turn rosy hmm well those are interesting things when he's talking about makes man these are all things that pertain to man and all those things come from a another a root where then it goes into an image to turn rosy let me just i'll throw this in because it's a whole another message we spoke a couple years ago but when it says to turn rosie what is it if your cheeks are rosy what's usually happened you're embarrassed something has gotten under your skin and you're embarrassed and there's another place where it talks about it in the scripture and it says the talking about god and man and it says that he he became ruddy or rosy god was embarrassed by what adam did he was embarrassed and yet at the same time the nature of god allowed that so that he could become red or bloody or and we could we could go on with that but it says to to he made him in his image which is his likeness his resemblance to be empty or emptied to and the root word is to shade or phantom and to make an illusion an image to represent a figure and there's a few others so and it means his likeness or similitude it comes in as we get into that just a little further in his image so he makes man in this image what man do you suppose he's talking about right here he's talking about the one that became bloody flesh or flushed blared what happens in the book of revelations and it talks about his eyes angry at sin it's talking about the creation of jesus christ let us make man in our image and here's where it changes where it says in the likeness it changes because it's in it means to be like him and it's similar to but it's a feminine word whoa now wait a minute so we're going to make a man and it says and it's very distinct about that is a male in other words a seed bearing man who bears the seed my word is a seed it's jesus christ a man in our image after the image in hebrews chapter one i'll read it real quick do you love him oh help me lord it says after his image but i'm trying to speed up here after his image who being is one verse three who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and if you read the first part it's god who speaks to us by his son who is the express image of his person whose person it's the person of god the beginning in jesus christ but here it says after our likeness what happens between image and likeness likeness is a feminine word it's female it means to be the same as to like after to model to shape after the same manner and in as you continue down there with that when it goes into that the next that likeness the next thing we see is the blessing that i give you the right he says in verse 28 god blessed him and says be fruitful multiply replenish the earth but it says god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him god is creating himself as we find in revelations chapter 3 the beginning of the creation of god and from that man god gives the promise to the woman who's in him god created man his own injury he created he him he created he him the seedbear well you say what about adam well where was adam when jesus christ was on calvary he was in the grave friends by waiting for the day that jesus came back out of hell and knocked at the door that's him that's the one that's the one that slew the lamb for even i jesus christ in every scripture do you love him praise the lord well i actually got a little over halfway that's amazing let's stand sister could you come and play us a song my mind he's in every scripture friends and as we if we were to go account there's a few more and there's one of those that it actually has oh i think it's in that first one we read where it says in the day in that word day is the same yesterday today and forever he's everywhere he's everywhere it's all jesus christ if he can keep this word together for well we don't know exactly when the book of job was but that's the oldest and there's so much jesus christ in jo in the book of job what about in you and i he's the same yesterday today and forever the same nature that was in jesus christ the he him that was created and we're made in that likeness the seed that's in the mail is transferred to what we call the bride of jesus christ to bring forth the same likeness the same image no we're not all going to wear robes and have long hairs brothers what images are talking about the character of the life the character that's in this word the same jesus in another form that we call the bride of jesus christ do you love him tonight what do
