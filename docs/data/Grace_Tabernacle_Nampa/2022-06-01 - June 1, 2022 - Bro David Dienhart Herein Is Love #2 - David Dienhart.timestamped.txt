[27:53] part two
[27:54] we took part one
[27:56] last wednesday
[27:58] and you that were here we subtitled it
[28:00] where were you
[28:02] where were you
[28:03] before the world before the foundation
[28:05] of the world where were you when god
[28:07] laid the foundations of the world where
[28:09] was you
[28:10] we went in to back into that and in the
[28:12] word and found out that you were his
[28:14] thought you were the thought of the
[28:15] eternal he existed in his thoughts
[28:19] so i want to go to first john again take
[28:22] that as our scripture once again in
[28:23] first john 4.
[28:27] and before we do that i'd like to have a
[28:30] word of prayer
[28:34] if you'll stand with me i'd appreciate
[28:36] it
[28:42] our heavenly father
[28:44] is so good to know and to call you
[28:46] father
[28:48] lord you knew us before the foundation
[28:50] of the world
[28:51] and we were known of you and you knew us
[28:54] and we
[28:55] have been known you lord only we didn't
[28:58] realize the knowing then but now you've
[29:01] made it manifest by thy word
[29:04] and we realize that we knew you we knew
[29:06] you we were in you and you knew us
[29:08] and if you hadn't known us there's no
[29:10] way we could know you
[29:12] and we thank you lord for that knowing a
[29:15] knowing that's not an imagination
[29:17] a knowing that's not some some some
[29:20] mental conception but a knowing that is
[29:23] absolutely
[29:25] absolutely positively eternal
[29:28] and it's revelation
[29:30] and it's a true faith
[29:31] we thank you for the unveiling of that
[29:33] to our hearts
[29:35] and and that something that seed that
[29:39] lord that you planted in us that could
[29:41] be quickened to become the living word
[29:44] we thank you for that lord we know that
[29:47] it's not what we've done but it's god's
[29:49] achieved your achievement
[29:51] and it's nothing to do with our
[29:52] achievement but it's your achievement
[29:54] and we thank you for this lord now bless
[29:57] your word we pray
[29:58] encourage the believers reveal yourself
[30:01] we ask you to come in revelation
[30:03] and reveal your word to our hearts that
[30:06] we may please you through your faith
[30:10] by your love
[30:11] in jesus christ's name
[30:13] amen
[30:15] amen so herein is love part two my
[30:17] subject here is the new creation
[30:20] you
[30:22] the subject is the new creation
[30:24] you
[30:26] amen
[30:28] and we know that that you
[30:30] can't be any other the new creation is
[30:32] only the creation
[30:34] of the word
[30:35] there's only one subject that can create
[30:38] and that's god
[30:40] amen
[30:41] and so when he created
[30:43] when he created and brought forth
[30:46] that which is in your heart quickened it
[30:48] we'll come into that more we realize
[30:50] that's who you are
[30:52] that's you
[30:54] and so
[30:55] we just are thankful that he has he has
[30:58] brought this forth to show us
[31:00] that before the world began
[31:02] we were in his thinking we'd never
[31:04] sinned in the first place
[31:09] amen you say well we were sinners that's
[31:11] right you had to be born again but i'm
[31:12] talking about after the birth
[31:16] amen it's just the devil pointing you to
[31:19] the wrong side not that new creation
[31:24] all right so we let's turn to first john
[31:26] 4 begin verse 4 once again you are of
[31:29] god
[31:32] there you are herein is love you are of
[31:34] god
[31:36] little children and have overcome them
[31:39] that them is antichrist spirit
[31:42] that's so close to the real that it
[31:43] would try it would deceive the elect if
[31:45] it was possible
[31:47] because that spirit that that spirit can
[31:50] be anointed
[31:52] amen
[31:53] amen how many know that by the genuine
[31:56] holy ghost
[31:59] amen but they can't hear and receive the
[32:01] word for their season
[32:02] they can't receive all the word remember
[32:04] we said the evidence of you being a
[32:05] child of god is that you're in the word
[32:07] all the way
[32:08] the evidence that you're a seed of god
[32:10] is that you're in the word all the way
[32:12] you will be in that word all the way and
[32:14] you will hear and receive the word for
[32:16] your season
[32:18] amen amen
[32:20] that's how you knew that you were in the
[32:22] thought of god
[32:25] before the foundation of the world so
[32:28] first john 4 4 you are of god little
[32:30] children and have overcome them because
[32:32] greater is he that's a that's a personal
[32:35] pronoun
[32:36] he
[32:38] a person
[32:39] greater is he the person in you than he
[32:42] that is in the world
[32:44] amen
[32:45] so you're conquering you have conquered
[32:47] the devil you're defeating a a conquered
[32:50] enemy because you're only taking and
[32:51] possessing what god's already given to
[32:53] you
[32:55] you're more than an overcomer
[32:57] all right so in in chapter 4 verse 7
[33:01] through 10 beloved let us love one
[33:04] another for love is of god now this love
[33:08] we're talking about here is not filio it
[33:10] is agape love filio is a friendship love
[33:12] filio has condition but this is not
[33:15] filial this is agape this is divine love
[33:18] and there's only one divine person that
[33:20] can be divine love and that's god
[33:22] himself
[33:23] all right so
[33:24] beloved let us love one another this
[33:27] love that we're loving with each other
[33:29] for love is of god and everyone that
[33:31] loveth is born of god and knoweth god
[33:34] see those two loves can be close
[33:36] you can love god in your spirit
[33:39] amen and still not have the love of god
[33:41] in your heart
[33:43] that's right all right
[33:45] you that they're in the message and
[33:46] reading the message you know that's true
[33:49] amen
[33:50] all right then they said excuse me
[33:54] verse 7 and everyone that loveth
[33:58] is born of god
[34:00] and knoweth there you are
[34:03] and knoweth god he that loveth not
[34:07] knoweth not god
[34:10] so how are you going to love how are you
[34:12] going to have the love of god how are
[34:13] you going to express the love of god you
[34:14] have to know god
[34:17] god has to be in
[34:18] you amen
[34:22] all right so he that loveth not knoweth
[34:25] not god for god is for god is
[34:28] love
[34:31] amen
[34:32] what is god
[34:35] love
[34:36] that's right
[34:37] he that loveth okay in this was
[34:40] manifested the love of god toward us
[34:43] in this god is love and this
[34:46] was manifested the love of god toward us
[34:48] because that god sent his only begotten
[34:50] son
[34:52] god in some form only begotten son into
[34:54] the world that we might live through
[34:58] him
[35:00] who was he he was the word made flesh
[35:03] when before he became flesh
[35:05] he was theophany before he became flesh
[35:08] he was a word body
[35:10] we bypassed that and came directly from
[35:12] the thought of god
[35:14] amen but you'll never be able to hear or
[35:16] receive the word unless you were the
[35:18] thought of god
[35:21] and i don't want that to pass from you
[35:23] amen
[35:24] you had to be in god's thinking in order
[35:26] to receive his word for this hour you
[35:29] had to be in god's thinking to be the
[35:31] word
[35:32] amen
[35:33] amen
[35:35] all right
[35:37] so
[35:40] in order to become the word brother
[35:41] brown said we be as we as we receive the
[35:44] word we be as we as we receive the word
[35:47] we become the word
[35:50] amen
[35:51] all right now verse 10 herein is love
[35:54] i'm sorry i didn't finish verse 9.
[35:56] yeah that we might love through him
[35:58] that's right that we might the son in
[36:00] the world that we might live through him
[36:01] here in herein
[36:04] is
[36:05] love
[36:07] now there's my title
[36:09] herein
[36:11] is love herein means
[36:13] right
[36:14] this
[36:15] this place
[36:18] this location this place
[36:20] herein is love
[36:23] not that we loved god
[36:27] amen i'm going to bring you a quote here
[36:29] in just a minute
[36:30] not that we love god but that he loved
[36:33] us
[36:35] now that ought to that ought to let the
[36:37] pressure off right there
[36:38] he loved you
[36:40] nothing shall be able to separate you
[36:42] brother trevor from that love
[36:45] nothing can separate you from that love
[36:48] if you know that if you
[36:50] how many say you genuinely in your heart
[36:52] know you love god but how did that
[36:55] become
[36:56] he had the first loved you
[36:59] then if he first loved you how are you
[37:00] going to be separated from that love
[37:04] you were in the very love of you were in
[37:06] god himself you were in that love
[37:08] himself you were in that love to begin
[37:11] with
[37:12] before the foundation of the world when
[37:14] there was nothing to even worship god
[37:16] god eternal spirit you were there
[37:18] existing in his thoughts
[37:23] of himself
[37:26] the thoughts of what of himself love
[37:29] perfect love
[37:31] god is love god is perfect love and you
[37:34] can't enter this place
[37:37] where where we know that you'll go to
[37:39] where where our bodies waiting for us if
[37:42] this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we
[37:44] have a body way you can't enter that
[37:46] place
[37:47] without having perfect love
[37:50] so god will see to it that your love is
[37:52] perfected
[37:54] but when you're born again you have that
[37:56] love but it needs to grow
[37:59] i'll get into that i want to go ahead of
[38:01] myself because that's another i just i
[38:03] don't know how many
[38:04] uh parts we're going to have in this but
[38:06] i just have to break it down i'd like to
[38:08] give you the whole thing
[38:09] but i don't want to do that lord hasn't
[38:11] quickened that to me but i may be three
[38:14] it may be two more parts it may be three
[38:16] more parts i don't know what it is
[38:18] but
[38:20] but listen now
[38:22] let's go the tenth verse again
[38:24] herein is love not that we love god but
[38:26] that he loved us and sent his son to be
[38:29] the propitiation for our sins
[38:33] sin matter is over with he that's born
[38:35] of god does not he that's the new
[38:38] creation
[38:39] he that's his race
[38:41] does not commit sin
[38:44] because the seed of god can't sin
[38:49] this whole body out here can fall and
[38:50] fail but you're looking don't look at
[38:52] that because that's not the identity
[38:54] that god identifies you by he identifies
[38:57] you through the blood as being perfect
[38:59] you're sinless and you're in him and the
[39:01] seed has come to life his seed
[39:04] amen you pass from death unto life
[39:08] amen
[39:09] now what's my next i didn't i didn't say
[39:11] what
[39:12] if you're the new creation is you
[39:14] so then you can let off the pressure
[39:18] you can let off
[39:20] the pressure
[39:22] i don't care what how great the pressure
[39:23] is you can let off the pressure
[39:26] by dependent upon
[39:28] believing
[39:30] that created word
[39:32] living the word living in you
[39:35] it's a person
[39:37] it's christ in you
[39:41] amen
[39:42] all right so
[39:44] let's go on keep reading
[39:46] verse
[39:47] 16. i'm not 13. go down to 13 hereby we
[39:50] know
[39:52] that we dwell in him

[39:59] hope it's right i hope it's so it's
[40:01] revelation
[40:03] hereby we know we hereby know we or we
[40:06] know that we dwell in him and he and us
[40:09] because he hath given us of
[40:13] just any old spirit
[40:15] his spirit
[40:17] god is a spirit and they that worship
[40:20] him must worship him in spirit and in
[40:22] truth or dynamics on mechanics
[40:27] the only true worship you can only wait
[40:29] you can worship him you have to be in
[40:31] him you have to be in where he put his
[40:33] name you have to be in the in his own
[40:37] choosing chosen play you must be in his
[40:40] chosen church
[40:44] and that isn't this building and that
[40:46] isn't the next one down the street
[40:47] either his chosen church there's brother
[40:49] bram says there's only one church he
[40:51] chose only one church you can worship
[40:54] him in
[40:55] amen
[40:56] a body has thou prepared me lord praise
[40:58] the lord hebrews 10 5. a body has thou
[41:01] prepared me amen
[41:06] all right
[41:07] that body is
[41:09] is himself
[41:13] all right now
[41:15] so we go to
[41:17] 13 i think i read yes
[41:19] 16
[41:21] through 19 for we have known and
[41:24] believed the love that god hath given
[41:26] hath to us
[41:28] god is love
[41:31] he that dwelleth in love dwelleth
[41:34] in
[41:35] god
[41:37] what is the spirit in you hereby we know
[41:40] we love we know we we know we we dwell
[41:44] in him and he and us because he had
[41:45] given us of his spirit then we're
[41:47] dwelling in love
[41:49] you can't have love without him in you
[41:52] and you in him
[41:54] if you if you were if he's in you you
[41:56] were in him
[41:59] amen
[42:00] amen all right now
[42:03] so and we know and believe the love that
[42:05] god hath to us god is love and he that
[42:07] dwelleth in love dwelleth in god
[42:10] god in and god in him
[42:13] he and you
[42:15] i in you you and me see
[42:17] all right
[42:19] herein is our love made perfect
[42:22] amen
[42:23] herein
[42:24] is our love in what in him
[42:28] amen we're going to come more and more
[42:30] into this
[42:31] growing up
[42:33] into a stature
[42:35] amen all right later on not tonight
[42:39] now we have so
[42:41] herein is our love made perfect that we
[42:43] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[42:45] how may know you've entered into the day
[42:47] of judgment
[42:48] it's already been
[42:50] brought already showed us judgment has
[42:52] begun the prophet said it's it's started
[42:55] we're in the day of judgment
[42:57] and the bride's being judged and has
[42:59] been judged by the open book
[43:01] she's not going to stand at judgment
[43:03] being judged by any book
[43:05] she is the open book that's been already
[43:07] opened and now we stand under that
[43:08] judgment and god's judgment of that book
[43:11] has declared us perfect
[43:14] in him
[43:17] amen
[43:19] all right
[43:20] now
[43:22] so
[43:23] we have boldness in the day of judgment
[43:25] because as he is as he is so are we
[43:30] in this world
[43:33] there is no fear in love
[43:35] but perfect love casteth out fear
[43:38] because fear hath torment he that
[43:40] feareth is not made perfect in love we
[43:44] love him because he first
[43:47] loved us
[43:48] all right you may be seated
[43:51] on page 354 355
[43:54] a portion here of this i'll read more
[43:56] out of this later
[43:58] as we go along in these
[44:00] these parts but
[44:02] but on page 354 church age book i'm
[44:04] reading out of the blue book
[44:07] and he said this he said he's reading
[44:10] the scripture found in revelation 3 19
[44:13] as many as i love
[44:15] he said many as i love i rebuke and
[44:17] chasten beselas therefore and repent
[44:20] and brother branham comes down in about
[44:22] the second paragraph he called the first
[44:24] paragraph of that page
[44:26] let's examine the first phrase as many
[44:28] as i love
[44:31] in the greek the emphasis is upon the
[44:34] personal pronoun i
[44:37] okay i love
[44:39] he does not say as many would feel he
[44:42] should say as many as love me
[44:45] no sir
[44:46] we must never try to make jesus the
[44:49] object of human love
[44:52] we must never
[44:53] make jesus the object of human filial
[44:57] human love
[45:00] now philia i'm not against it it's a
[45:01] real love you have love for your wife a
[45:03] feeling of love and we went into that if
[45:05] you want to hear more i can't go back
[45:07] all the time but we we showed what that
[45:10] was
[45:11] on on the wednesday before
[45:13] so i'm part one
[45:15] so we come down here now no he said
[45:19] he said it is in this verse no it is the
[45:22] many that are the loved ones of god
[45:27] it's the many that are the loved ones of
[45:29] god it is his love in question
[45:33] amen
[45:35] it's not your loving question
[45:39] it's his love and question
[45:43] all right it's his love and question
[45:46] not ours there just said he said it
[45:49] right there not ours
[45:51] so once again we find ourselves glorying
[45:53] in his salvation
[45:55] his purpose
[45:57] his purpose we'll come to that in a
[45:58] minute scripturally his purpose and his
[46:01] plan
[46:03] we are conf we and we are confirmed even
[46:07] more strongly in the truth of the
[46:09] doctrine of the sovereignty of god
[46:11] amen as he said in romans 9 13 jacob
[46:14] have i loved esau have i hated but jacob
[46:18] have i emphasis i loved
[46:22] esau as we said was a better mural man
[46:24] if you were to choose between one or the
[46:26] other you'd
[46:27] chosen esau looking at the physical
[46:29] fleshly works you'd have chosen esau
[46:32] because jacob was a shyster but there's
[46:34] one thing he desired his heart that
[46:35] birthright
[46:37] no matter how he had to get it what he
[46:39] had to lose to get it he wanted that
[46:40] birthright and god honored that
[46:43] showing in type what the true birth
[46:45] white would be that we would hunger and
[46:47] desire
[46:48] and someday we staggered into a mission
[46:50] we staggered over here and we come into
[46:52] a place when we heard the word and when
[46:54] the truth was presented to us and the
[46:57] word was preached for the season of word
[46:59] the truth of the word we then come alive
[47:02] because something inside of us
[47:03] registered that's what i'm looking for
[47:05] why because you were that and in that
[47:08] before the foundation of the world
[47:11] amen
[47:13] amen it just took the word to be brought
[47:15] to you amen and you responded as a
[47:19] little eagle because you were an eagle
[47:20] to begin with and you heard the voice of
[47:22] the eagle my sheep know my voice
[47:27] amen
[47:28] amen so you don't have to worry about
[47:29] sheep getting anything just preach the
[47:31] message
[47:32] the sheep will hear the voice the rest
[47:35] of them can't hear it because they're
[47:36] not sheep
[47:40] amen amen we're going after and i'm not
[47:42] here to to say this one's in that one's
[47:44] out don't just preach what preach what's
[47:46] in and let the let that decipher who's
[47:49] in and out
[47:52] amen all right now
[47:55] so
[47:56] we see here as we go on
[47:59] he said
[48:00] the sovereignty okay jacob i loved okay
[48:03] and and esau hated for for children not
[48:07] being born neither having done any good
[48:10] or evil
[48:11] the devil will beat you up as long as
[48:14] that once you start to fall i thought
[48:17] you were the i thought
[48:19] and you begin to reason yeah i don't
[48:20] feel like it i don't feel like a
[48:22] christian forget your feelings has
[48:24] nothing to do with the inside of the
[48:26] inside
[48:27] you don't meet god by feelings you don't
[48:30] meet god by your senses you can't even
[48:32] touch him by that the only way you can
[48:34] reach and touch god is by faith
[48:37] amen amen that's right he kept it that
[48:40] way he showed at the beginning that way
[48:43] he he he judged the cain and abel by
[48:45] that one had revelation and that's what
[48:47] god accepted
[48:50] so it was that way from the beginning
[48:53] it's going to end that way right here at
[48:55] the end
[48:57] amen it's faith that made the difference
[48:58] revelation of god's will made the
[49:01] difference and showed who was his seed
[49:03] and who wasn't right
[49:07] amen amen now true revelation brother
[49:10] brown said will always be vindicated by
[49:13] the word of god
[49:15] you that person can say i'll have
[49:16] revelation but it's not proving the word
[49:19] it's not backed by the word
[49:21] because if it's true revelation then
[49:23] scriptures will come alive to it it
[49:24] opens this it opens that it's over here
[49:26] it's over there and god's obligated to
[49:28] show that
[49:31] if it's a real revelation amen
[49:34] how many know you you see something and
[49:35] then i'll hear it's over here and god's
[49:37] bringing that to your remembrance and
[49:38] here it's over here and back over here
[49:40] oh yes this is what the prophet said and
[49:42] that's what he said and this is the
[49:43] scripture
[49:46] amen that's right all right so
[49:52] so he's going on to say here just to
[49:54] draw a purpose here that the purpose of
[49:56] god see for the children not being born
[49:58] neither having done good or evil that
[50:00] the purpose of god according to election
[50:04] so if it's election you didn't have one
[50:07] thing to do with it
[50:11] quit injecting yourself into the word
[50:13] and just take the word
[50:17] your reasoning i'm saying rejecting
[50:18] yourself your feelings your reasoning
[50:20] your senses
[50:22] leave it alone
[50:24] i just i'll just bring it to you to
[50:26] reality of it that's not even you
[50:29] the real you
[50:32] amen that's it that's it yes that's it
[50:36] let off the pressure
[50:39] hallelujah
[50:40] let off the pressure all right now so
[50:44] we see here
[50:45] he said for he said
[50:48] this love he said that that election the
[50:50] god according to election might stand
[50:52] not of works
[50:54] now i believe in works brother branham
[50:55] believed in works but faith without
[50:58] works or works without faith is a dead
[51:00] work
[51:03] that's right faith has got to testify
[51:06] faith testifies or excuse me testified
[51:09] of abraham's faith
[51:12] god justified him by the faith then
[51:14] justified him by his works
[51:17] who justified him by faith amen god did
[51:21] but his works were testifying of the
[51:23] revelation he had whether he saw it or
[51:26] not he knew god had given it to him
[51:27] because that
[51:29] word a promise was made substance in him
[51:32] it was absolutely substance he knew it
[51:35] it was real
[51:37] right
[51:38] that's what faith is
[51:40] we'll get into that just a moment here a
[51:42] little more
[51:43] god will allow me to do it not just keep
[51:45] treading on over here in these places
[51:47] amen all right now
[51:51] now just one more thing here he said the
[51:53] purpose of god stands an election which
[51:55] is actually opposite to works
[51:58] anything man has in himself or anything
[52:01] that man has in himself oh i've skipped
[52:04] something here
[52:05] not of works but of him that calleth
[52:08] the love
[52:09] this love is elective love how did he
[52:12] prove that he loved you
[52:14] by by calling you
[52:16] amen and then positioning you placing
[52:19] you as a son
[52:23] so his love is proven
[52:26] not your actions not how you feel i did
[52:28] this and i should have done this and i
[52:30] couldn't do this and i did that has
[52:32] nothing to do with it
[52:37] remember the word of god is going to
[52:39] separate the difference between soul and
[52:41] spirit
[52:42] that's right it's going to tell you who
[52:44] you really are and who you're not
[52:47] the word does that
[52:49] that's why we continue to say feed on
[52:52] the open book keep feeding on the word
[52:57] amen because it's through that that
[52:59] faith comes by hearing the word showing
[53:01] that that faith of god's own faith lays
[53:04] in the word
[53:07] amen
[53:09] it's got its resting place in the
[53:11] eternal word of god
[53:14] all right so he said the purpose of god
[53:17] he said his love for you i'll just put
[53:20] it you he said them it's you his love
[53:23] it is it is his love for the elect
[53:28] his love for them the elect you is apart
[53:31] from human merit
[53:35] well that's a big word
[53:37] it's apart from human merit
[53:40] amen for it says the purpose of god
[53:43] stands in election the purpose of god
[53:46] stands in election
[53:49] not what you chose he chose and because
[53:52] he chose you could
[53:54] that's choose because there was
[53:56] something he placed in you by his
[53:58] choosing
[54:00] that would say yes to this word because
[54:03] you had his your thought his
[54:05] his thought of himself you were in that
[54:08] thought
[54:12] amen all right and that thought of
[54:14] himself was eternal so that thought of
[54:16] you had to be eternal now how is eternal
[54:19] going to have a beginning or end
[54:21] when it's identified that you are
[54:23] eternal then how you're going to come to
[54:25] a place where you all of a sudden lose
[54:26] it and i'm no more and i can't make it
[54:29] right
[54:30] that's right you've done made it
[54:33] right your future's clear
[54:36] and you're gonna have struggles and
[54:38] trials and testings to build character
[54:40] to bring you to the stature that these
[54:42] that these virtues would be living in
[54:44] you
[54:46] and they're capped off by himself
[54:48] they're capped off not not you didn't
[54:50] have us you know you don't receive the
[54:52] holy ghost which is the seal of god and
[54:53] then later on get sealed
[54:56] no that's more that that ceiling there
[54:58] is a positioning a placing an adoption
[55:06] hallelujah you're already born again
[55:08] when those virtues begin to grow i'm
[55:10] getting into my subject later on but
[55:12] just let it just take that much of it
[55:15] all right
[55:17] all right now
[55:18] so the purpose so it's apart from human
[55:21] merit
[55:22] actually opposite to works
[55:25] now what i said if you'll go back and
[55:27] search the scripture you'll find out
[55:28] brother brown and made that clear
[55:31] it was it was it was it was the
[55:34] i'll i just want to go there right now
[55:36] i'll get that later
[55:38] all right
[55:40] okay now then he says herein is set
[55:43] forth herein is now set forth the love
[55:46] of god
[55:49] he desired to in love a family of his
[55:52] own a family of sons
[55:55] like himself
[55:58] amen
[56:00] all right you know i keep building on
[56:03] this but i'm wanting to make it known to
[56:05] you what did i say last sunday not to
[56:07] forget what is love what does what
[56:10] that's not it wait a minute

[56:14] question was what never fails

[56:23] never fails let me say it again let it
[56:26] go under the fifth rib
[56:28] love never fails let it come in you
[56:35] for my title is herein
[56:38] all right
[56:39] now
[56:42] turn of me to ephesians
[56:44] and i want to read just some quick
[56:45] scripture i won't spend as much time we
[56:48] know that the bible says that you were
[56:50] chosen in him
[56:52] before the foundation
[56:54] of the world
[56:55] chosen in who
[56:59] then let off the pressure
[57:04] well i know we face pressure every day
[57:06] don't tell me you don't face pressure
[57:08] the battle today is the mind battle the
[57:11] pressure battle
[57:13] amen it's it's constantly you know one
[57:16] time you just gave your life if you'd
[57:18] but now it's
[57:20] satan bombarding on every side
[57:21] bombarding your mind trying to get you
[57:23] away from this this focus
[57:26] this
[57:27] single eye focus
[57:31] on his presence
[57:34] in words and deeds and it depends on how
[57:36] much you're wanting to feed on things
[57:37] that don't satisfy how much you want to
[57:40] feed on things that are not true
[57:42] amen
[57:44] better faults you're going to find
[57:46] yourself more and more depressed and
[57:47] down why because you're feeding
[57:50] on that
[57:52] i say let's turn focus let her i be
[57:54] single
[57:56] and get our focus on him get our focus
[57:58] on his presence get our focus and
[57:59] dependency on him and us
[58:03] and be careful i mean paul said you
[58:05] better flee idolatry
[58:07] don't you let nothing come between you
[58:09] and god that's right car land houses
[58:12] money on and on and on and on and on
[58:14] your senses your feelings everything
[58:16] else don't you put that and don't you
[58:18] bow to that put that in front of god's
[58:20] word
[58:24] amen
[58:25] and fear is a great big one
[58:29] amen all right
[58:31] all right i'll just stop there on that
[58:33] one all right so ephesians chapter one
[58:41] and let's take verse i had marked off
[58:43] this
[58:44] verse nine
[58:45] so we know that
[58:47] we know that we predestinate us unto
[58:49] adoption and later on we're going to go
[58:51] find out that you've already received
[58:52] the spirit of adoption when you're born
[58:54] again you've already received the spirit
[58:56] of adoption that'll take you to a
[58:58] complete adoption and placing and
[59:00] positioning brother branham said i'm so
[59:03] happy lo so glad i'm so glad lord to see
[59:05] ourselves positionally placed
[59:09] in christ
[59:11] all right
[59:12] but coming back here to verse 9 now
[59:15] having made known unto us the mystery of
[59:18] his will
[59:20] according to his good pleasure which he
[59:23] hath past tense purposed
[59:27] in himself
[59:28] there's your purpose
[59:30] he purposed that in himself
[59:33] amen
[59:34] all right then in verse 10
[59:37] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[59:39] of times that's the dispensation we're
[59:41] in in the dispensation of the fullness
[59:43] of times he might gather together in one
[59:46] all things in christ he said how can
[59:50] that happen because seven seals were
[59:51] opened
[59:53] all things in christ
[59:56] both which are in heaven and which are
[59:58] on earth even
[1:00:00] in
[1:00:02] him
[1:00:03] amen amen amen all right verse 11
[1:00:10] in whom
[1:00:11] in whom also we have obtained an
[1:00:14] inheritance being predestinated
[1:00:17] according to the purpose
[1:00:20] of him who worketh all things after the
[1:00:23] council of his own will
[1:00:26] 16th verse
[1:00:29] 17th verse
[1:00:31] wait a minute now
[1:00:34] yeah 17 that the god of our lord jesus
[1:00:37] christ the father of glory may give unto
[1:00:40] you the spirit of wisdom
[1:00:42] and revelation in the knowledge of him
[1:00:46] that's not mental knowledge
[1:00:48] that's god's knowledge
[1:00:51] amen which won't flaunt itself
[1:00:54] right it's not puffed up
[1:00:59] satan's knowledge intellectual knowledge
[1:01:01] knowledge that's an intellectual
[1:01:03] conception of the word will puff up
[1:01:08] did you know that yeah yes sir that's
[1:01:11] her that's the scripture
[1:01:13] knowledge puffeth up well that's not
[1:01:15] god's knowledge
[1:01:16] amen all right amen
[1:01:19] now
[1:01:20] so it always remains humble knowing
[1:01:22] where it received it
[1:01:25] it didn't manufacture it it couldn't
[1:01:26] manufacture it it was given by grace and
[1:01:29] by the way his grace is sufficient so we
[1:01:31] can let off the pressure
[1:01:32] his grace is sufficient
[1:01:35] for his strength is made perfect in
[1:01:36] weakness but don't make your weaknesses
[1:01:38] an excuse for doing nothing
[1:01:40] but realize you're weak and surrender to
[1:01:42] him and let him be what he is and meant
[1:01:45] you to be and take of himself and
[1:01:47] quicken himself and then make himself
[1:01:49] flesh in you and be in action
[1:01:53] because when you when you when you can
[1:01:56] truly be able to cover two wings and
[1:01:58] cover your face and cover your feet the
[1:02:00] next thing when you're when you've got
[1:02:02] those in place then you can be in action
[1:02:07] amen
[1:02:09] all right
[1:02:10] now
[1:02:12] so we're getting verse 19 i think we're
[1:02:14] on verse 19. and what is
[1:02:17] the exceeding and and what is
[1:02:20] going right along with verse 18

[1:02:28] being enlightened that you may know eyes
[1:02:30] of your understanding being enlightened
[1:02:32] that you may know what is the hope of
[1:02:34] his calling and what the riches of the
[1:02:36] glory of his inheritance what it is in
[1:02:39] is his inheritance in the saints
[1:02:42] and what is the exceeding greatness of
[1:02:44] his power to us word
[1:02:46] who believe
[1:02:47] what's the what's the criteria there to
[1:02:49] who believe
[1:02:51] according to the working of his mighty
[1:02:53] power
[1:02:54] listen i'll tell you right now you're
[1:02:56] going to fear whatever you believe
[1:03:02] you know that
[1:03:03] if you believe it you're really gonna
[1:03:04] you'll either reverence god and believe
[1:03:06] him and have a genuine respect and fear
[1:03:09] or you're gonna fear the devil and
[1:03:10] believe in him
[1:03:13] whatever you believe that's what you'll
[1:03:14] fear
[1:03:17] amen
[1:03:19] all right you have to believe it you're
[1:03:21] going to show respect to whatever you
[1:03:23] believe and what you believe you can
[1:03:25] have what you believe
[1:03:28] amen and you'll get what you believe
[1:03:32] absolutely
[1:03:35] so you have one thing to do you've been
[1:03:37] given authority to shut the door to the
[1:03:38] devil
[1:03:40] okay shut the door then don't believe
[1:03:42] him
[1:03:42] take the word you got to believe one or
[1:03:44] the other yes there's only two spirits
[1:03:47] yes
[1:03:49] i know why i'm saying that i go off on
[1:03:50] this side and i just
[1:03:52] come back but i just said lord that's in
[1:03:53] your hands
[1:03:54] all right
[1:03:56] so the and if you go to you don't have
[1:03:58] to turn here but
[1:03:59] and ephesians 3 11 it says according to
[1:04:02] the eternal purpose which he purposed in
[1:04:04] christ jesus our lord
[1:04:07] amen
[1:04:08] hallelujah all right
[1:04:18] john 1 1 said in the beginning was the
[1:04:20] word and the word was with god the word
[1:04:21] was god and the word became and let's go
[1:04:24] to john 1 again let's go over there and
[1:04:26] read
[1:04:27] 13
[1:04:28] and 14.
[1:04:30] i want you to read this
[1:04:33] first john or not first john saint john
[1:04:35] 1
[1:04:36] 13
[1:04:39] as many as received him verse 12 he gave
[1:04:42] power to them to become sons of god even
[1:04:44] to them that believe on his name
[1:04:47] which were born
[1:04:48] is what we get to which were born not of
[1:04:50] blood
[1:04:51] nor of the will of the flesh
[1:04:55] nor of the will of man
[1:04:58] how were they born of god
[1:05:01] all right god is what
[1:05:03] the word
[1:05:05] he created the word he created
[1:05:07] everything by the word it was the word
[1:05:09] to begin with it's the word it'll end
[1:05:11] with he's alpha he's omega
[1:05:14] amen
[1:05:16] it's always the word it's always been
[1:05:17] the word the original is the word
[1:05:19] anything added to or taken from that is
[1:05:21] a perversion of the devil
[1:05:25] amen
[1:05:26] amen so you see but you're born of god
[1:05:29] and and as a conjunction tying these two
[1:05:32] scriptures together and the word was
[1:05:34] made flesh
[1:05:36] and dwell among us
[1:05:39] so you're born of god the word is made
[1:05:41] flesh
[1:05:42] and not only was made flesh it's now
[1:05:45] made flesh
[1:05:47] and dwelling among us
[1:05:49] because the seed had to be in you to be
[1:05:51] birthed
[1:05:52] you had to have him we'll get to that in
[1:05:54] just a moment
[1:05:56] all right and we beheld his glory the
[1:05:59] glory as of the only begotten of the
[1:06:02] father his saint the same glory because
[1:06:04] jesus said i'll they'll receive my glory
[1:06:07] i'll share my glory with them
[1:06:09] and it said the glory of the only
[1:06:11] begotten of the father full of grace and
[1:06:13] truth i'm trying too hard to get through
[1:06:14] this i'm going too fast but
[1:06:17] all right
[1:06:20] first peter 1 23
[1:06:22] and we'll find out how your birth
[1:06:24] let's go over here to first peter
[1:06:27] i may not get as far as i think tonight
[1:06:29] so we'll just take it part three
[1:06:31] okay first peter
[1:06:34] 1
[1:06:36] 23
[1:06:38] being born again
[1:06:40] not of corruptible seed
[1:06:43] but of
[1:06:44] incorruptible how
[1:06:46] by the word of god which
[1:06:50] liveth and abideth forever so so the the
[1:06:54] spiritual new birth
[1:06:57] is
[1:06:59] a creative act of god
[1:07:01] it's a spoken word
[1:07:04] amen the spoken word is what brings the
[1:07:08] birth
[1:07:09] that's why when you came into this hour
[1:07:11] this season there was a word to meet you
[1:07:14] you were predestinated to live the word
[1:07:16] for the hour you were predestinated to
[1:07:18] be the message but it had to be spoken
[1:07:21] and when it was spoken he spoke for you
[1:07:23] to come into existence
[1:07:27] he spoke for his thought to become
[1:07:29] materialized
[1:07:31] amen
[1:07:34] amen
[1:07:38] that's letting off the pressure
[1:07:40] when you realize you're that thought
[1:07:44] now become material
[1:07:47] god becomes tangible
[1:07:50] still becoming tangible all the way to a
[1:07:53] new body change but that seed has been
[1:07:55] quickened the word's been quickened and
[1:07:58] every seed the bible said in first
[1:07:59] corinthians 15 has its own body
[1:08:02] so you have a body waiting
[1:08:06] amen
[1:08:08] this whole body here is just the shuck
[1:08:11] that's bearing the true seed
[1:08:15] word of god living
[1:08:19] just like it was in mary
[1:08:22] amen mary was shocked
[1:08:24] mary herself was a shock
[1:08:28] but mary bore
[1:08:31] her mary borid but inside of her was the
[1:08:34] creative word
[1:08:37] a creative body spoken word natural now
[1:08:41] we're spiritual
[1:08:43] it's a spiritual spoken word you're
[1:08:45] you're brought to birth by the word he
[1:08:48] has to speak it in your season and you
[1:08:50] receive it and hear it
[1:08:54] there comes the baptism with the holy
[1:08:56] ghost there comes the new birth
[1:09:01] amen amen amen amen amen all right so
[1:09:06] body has been prepared
[1:09:09] hallelujah
[1:09:11] you are the words
[1:09:14] see you bet you the book was the sealed
[1:09:16] book but you're the words in the book
[1:09:21] amen but they had to be sun sealed but
[1:09:24] they couldn't be unsealed until this day
[1:09:27] so without us they couldn't be made
[1:09:28] perfect
[1:09:30] because what we have today is the
[1:09:32] perfect
[1:09:35] amen amen amen
[1:09:38] all right so you're the word the word
[1:09:40] has been opened
[1:09:42] they the book was sealed these words
[1:09:45] were sealed and you were sealed until
[1:09:48] your season with it until the season
[1:09:52] you can't be the word unless you were
[1:09:54] his thought at the beginning before the
[1:09:57] world began or at the beginning that's
[1:09:59] right
[1:10:00] amen
[1:10:02] so god has unveiled himself you are not
[1:10:05] another you are himself revealed or
[1:10:07] unveiled manifested in bright form
[1:10:11] hallelujah the new birth
[1:10:14] is jesus christ revealed in you

[1:10:24] the birth
[1:10:25] the lamb said is jesus christ revealed

[1:10:41] there i've been building on that so
[1:10:43] we'll just keep building
[1:10:45] all right now ephesians 1.
[1:10:49] ephesians 1 23.

[1:11:00] 22 and 23 and hath put
[1:11:03] all things under his
[1:11:06] feet

[1:11:10] over all things
[1:11:12] to
[1:11:13] the church

[1:12:29] ages and from generations but now
[1:12:32] is made manifest to his saints to whom
[1:12:35] god would make known what is the riches
[1:12:37] of the glory of this mystery among the
[1:12:39] gentiles which is
[1:12:42] christ in
[1:12:43] you
[1:12:45] the hope of glory
[1:12:48] amen the hope of glory christ in you
[1:12:51] all right
[1:12:56] then see god came down and the character
[1:12:59] of god was christ he was the reflection
[1:13:04] he was god made visible
[1:13:07] notice god made visible
[1:13:10] because christ is what the mystery of
[1:13:12] god revealed
[1:13:14] made visible
[1:13:17] and that's not so much with natural
[1:13:18] vision as it's a spiritual vision
[1:13:22] it's made visible
[1:13:25] you see him he said you'll see me
[1:13:27] others won't see me but you'll see me
[1:13:32] all right
[1:13:33] now
[1:13:34] he's in the beginning was god he wasn't
[1:13:37] even god then no god's an object of
[1:13:39] worship only thing he was was eternal
[1:13:42] and in him was attributes and those
[1:13:45] attributes were thoughts
[1:13:48] and those thoughts were expressed to
[1:13:51] words
[1:13:52] and word was made manifest
[1:13:56] what is it it's all god becoming
[1:14:01] tangible
[1:14:02] i'm coming to that word tangible in a
[1:14:04] minute
[1:14:05] it was only it's all god becoming
[1:14:07] tangible or other words can be touched
[1:14:13] amen it's all god becoming tangible
[1:14:18] amen i've got to find my place it's all
[1:14:20] god becoming tangible and you are a part
[1:14:23] of god amen
[1:14:25] and jesus come to redeem those that was
[1:14:28] put on the lamb's book of life before
[1:14:31] the foundation of the world
[1:14:34] it was in god's thoughts
[1:14:38] it was what is the book of life himself
[1:14:41] his own life
[1:14:43] what his life had made up who makes up
[1:14:45] his life
[1:14:47] it's his life
[1:14:48] it's his life revealed
[1:14:50] all right
[1:14:54] and that's what he and it was all it was
[1:14:56] in god's thoughts that's what he come to
[1:14:59] redeem
[1:15:01] and them as soon as it strikes them
[1:15:05] what's what's striking them
[1:15:07] word
[1:15:09] for the season
[1:15:11] they're hearing faith they're hearing
[1:15:13] the word preached
[1:15:15] all right
[1:15:16] then it strikes them they see it because
[1:15:19] the life
[1:15:20] is in there
[1:15:22] where is it
[1:15:23] it's in the seed
[1:15:27] amen it's not a dead seed
[1:15:29] it's a dermatitis seed
[1:15:31] i guess you'd the term would be
[1:15:33] germinated there's no germatite german
[1:15:35] dermatitis seed a dermatitis seed
[1:15:40] right
[1:15:41] now
[1:15:42] but if the life isn't in there
[1:15:45] then what can they do see they don't see
[1:15:48] it they don't
[1:15:49] understand it they don't see it
[1:15:53] they'll never
[1:15:55] see it
[1:15:57] now don't you let the devil jump on your
[1:15:59] shoulder right now
[1:16:01] because what are you basing that on
[1:16:04] what's the devil basing it on he's going
[1:16:05] to lie to you and say remember
[1:16:08] you're not seeing it
[1:16:11] but don't you dare try to figure it out
[1:16:13] if you want to see it get to the source
[1:16:16] and start feeding
[1:16:21] the devil will try to accuse everything
[1:16:23] he can don't you let him do it do you
[1:16:25] believe what god said about you
[1:16:27] yes
[1:16:28] then trust him yes
[1:16:30] and go to the source and start feeding
[1:16:32] on the source you came out of
[1:16:37] that's right that's right we came out of
[1:16:39] the same source
[1:16:40] we came out of the same source that
[1:16:42] jesus christ came out of
[1:16:45] and he was god himself made flesh
[1:16:50] all right that's right
[1:16:52] okay now
[1:16:54] but if the okay
[1:16:55] seventh seal
[1:16:59] revealed or unveiled
[1:17:01] this
[1:17:02] the whole thing is jesus said at that
[1:17:04] day you'll know that i'm in the father
[1:17:06] the father and me i in you and you and
[1:17:09] me
[1:17:10] amen
[1:17:12] you see who you are don't you
[1:17:15] do you
[1:17:17] let off the pressure
[1:17:19] you say oh brother david you just don't
[1:17:20] know the pressure i go through you can
[1:17:22] let off the pressure i'm not saying the
[1:17:24] pressure isn't going to come it's going
[1:17:25] to try to bombard you but you've got a
[1:17:27] pressure
[1:17:28] escape you can you've got something
[1:17:31] loaded off you've got a place to go
[1:17:34] go back to the rock
[1:17:36] go back to the revelation god is my
[1:17:38] revelation god is my rock
[1:17:41] that's the bible psalm 62 god is my rock
[1:17:44] he only is my rock he's my refuge he's
[1:17:47] my salvation in him i shall not be moved
[1:17:51] can't move it
[1:17:52] and just you were put in that cleft
[1:17:55] right there just stay right in there
[1:17:57] come right back with the devil and say i
[1:17:59] don't know what you think about it i'm
[1:18:01] not depending on how i feel and how i
[1:18:03] think about it it's what god said about
[1:18:05] it and that's an amen in me
[1:18:10] that's revealed to me i'm going to stand
[1:18:12] there with it even if i give it a right
[1:18:14] mental attitude it's got to be quickened
[1:18:17] to me then i'm going to give that word
[1:18:18] because it's in me to do so i'll give it
[1:18:20] a right mental attitude and position
[1:18:22] where it belongs and god will even bring
[1:18:24] it to pass that's the truth
[1:18:29] amen
[1:18:30] all right
[1:18:32] so now
[1:18:33] see so like he said the whole thing the
[1:18:36] whole thing
[1:18:37] the father in me i and you you and me
[1:18:39] the whole thing is god becoming material
[1:18:44] you know what the word material means
[1:18:46] substance
[1:18:51] that's right tangible substance okay
[1:18:55] okay
[1:18:57] like a husband and wife becoming one
[1:18:59] together god and his church becoming one
[1:19:05] and brother branham after the opioid
[1:19:06] seal said they are.
[1:19:10] how could he say that because he was
[1:19:12] looking at the scriptures the opening of
[1:19:13] the word knowing and saying and
[1:19:15] pronouncing it that's what it is
[1:19:18] oneness
[1:19:19] [Applause]
[1:19:21] amen
[1:19:22] she is one all right
[1:19:24] say yeah lord i believe that yes but i
[1:19:27] sure don't feel it forget your feeling
[1:19:29] do you believe that yes
[1:19:32] do you believe it
[1:19:33] it's a revelation that's quickened to me
[1:19:35] lord i know that's right
[1:19:37] i'm not depending on this then i'm
[1:19:39] looking at the inner man i'm looking on
[1:19:40] the inside man that inside man is
[1:19:42] perfect
[1:19:44] it's love
[1:19:46] if you love god what are you going to do
[1:19:49] have faith
[1:19:50] if you love god you're going to trust
[1:19:52] him
[1:19:55] and when something revealed god reveals
[1:19:57] his word to you stand right there on it
[1:19:58] and confess it
[1:20:00] he'll he's a high priest of the
[1:20:02] confession of our faith hold fast to the
[1:20:05] confession of your faith
[1:20:11] amen faith
[1:20:12] revelation
[1:20:14] hold fast and you will hold fast because
[1:20:17] why it's substance
[1:20:19] all right you don't have it just an
[1:20:21] imagination so let's turn to hebrews
[1:20:23] well well you can turn if you want
[1:20:25] hebrews 11
[1:20:27] first verse
[1:20:28] hebrews 11 verse
[1:20:30] 1. now faith is the substance
[1:20:34] now faith is what the substance
[1:20:39] of things hoped for
[1:20:41] say well i get it i hope i get it i hope
[1:20:44] i get it that's not faith
[1:20:46] faith is a substance
[1:20:50] i know this is a desk
[1:20:52] how do i know
[1:20:54] i can feel it
[1:20:56] i can see it you can't talk me out of it
[1:20:59] substance
[1:21:04] it's substance that's what revelation is
[1:21:08] that's why brother brown said faith is a
[1:21:10] revelation over and over again
[1:21:17] so revelation cannot be overemphasized
[1:21:19] the need of revelation
[1:21:22] amen we have to be asking god for
[1:21:24] revelation
[1:21:25] you have not because you ask not
[1:21:28] because you're fearing your own senses
[1:21:30] you're fearing something you feel
[1:21:33] many times i don't feel god but i know
[1:21:35] he's in me
[1:21:37] but i'm not depending on how i feel not
[1:21:39] depending on my reasoning i'm not giving
[1:21:41] my opinion and connecting it with the
[1:21:43] word let go of all of that and take god
[1:21:45] at his word
[1:21:46] and hold that steady and water it
[1:21:50] amen
[1:21:52] if he doesn't water his crops i can tell
[1:21:53] you right now
[1:21:55] he's not going to have a crop
[1:22:00] you've got to water it
[1:22:01] you plant it water it plant it in the
[1:22:03] holy spirit and water it with faith
[1:22:06] plant it in the right ground
[1:22:09] amen it'll bring forth
[1:22:11] that's right that's exactly right okay
[1:22:14] now
[1:22:16] so hebrews 11 1 faith is the substance
[1:22:18] of things hoped for the evidence
[1:22:22] it's
[1:22:22] substance you can't talk me out of it
[1:22:25] i've got the evidence this is the desk
[1:22:28] god said he would do god said he healed
[1:22:30] me
[1:22:31] i believe that
[1:22:33] i accept that yes how do i believe it
[1:22:36] it's revealed to me god said it was
[1:22:38] finished work it was done then calvary
[1:22:40] by his by his stripes i'm healed he said
[1:22:43] i'm already healed
[1:22:44] can you heal me lord no i've already
[1:22:46] done it
[1:22:48] then i have received it
[1:22:51] amen when i receive it that settles it
[1:22:53] he said so
[1:22:55] and i say amen regardless of what i feel
[1:22:57] regardless what i see regardless of
[1:22:59] anything else he healed me he healed me
[1:23:02] that's all the more i need
[1:23:06] hallelujah
[1:23:08] that's right why because that scripture
[1:23:10] that promise
[1:23:11] has become substance
[1:23:15] it's in me as substance
[1:23:18] and it's evidence i have the evidence i
[1:23:20] have the substance i have the evidence
[1:23:22] it's got to be manifested what manifests
[1:23:25] god's word faith
[1:23:29] you can't work it up pump it up work it
[1:23:31] up pump it up it's just faith god
[1:23:33] revealed that to me
[1:23:35] lord revealed this to me
[1:23:37] and he reveals it to you you've got it
[1:23:39] that's it nobody can talk you out of it
[1:23:41] it's substance
[1:23:44] all right
[1:23:46] in
[1:23:48] psalm 62 he's my rock
[1:23:51] now in things that are to be
[1:23:54] 12 5 65 he said and that's the way oh
[1:23:57] excuse me first corinthians 6 17.
[1:24:01] we don't have they can't go the whole
[1:24:02] scripture but he that is joined unto the
[1:24:04] lord he's a joint you know how the bible
[1:24:06] said he's joined to a harlot is one
[1:24:09] flesh
[1:24:11] is that right one body
[1:24:13] so if you join yourself to a spiritual
[1:24:14] harlot what are you going to be
[1:24:18] let alone the natural harlot
[1:24:20] but a spiritual
[1:24:23] adulterous woman
[1:24:25] if you take that on and join yourself
[1:24:27] with that you'll become that adulterous
[1:24:30] fornicating woman
[1:24:33] amen but he that is joined to the lord
[1:24:37] the bible said is one spirit
[1:24:40] hallelujah that's it
[1:24:42] he that is joined to the lord is one
[1:24:44] spirit there is your identification
[1:24:48] amen
[1:24:50] hallelujah
[1:24:52] that's the token
[1:24:54] amen
[1:24:55] amen and when the tokens applied it
[1:24:58] shows your price has been paid it's your
[1:25:00] redeemed your redeemed property your
[1:25:02] redeemed possession
[1:25:04] but you've got to have the token to
[1:25:06] identify you're redeemed
[1:25:09] because you can claim all you want
[1:25:11] you're redeemed and that's good you can
[1:25:13] claim it but until the token come it's
[1:25:15] not recognized your redemption is not
[1:25:17] recognized yet you've got to be claimed
[1:25:19] and the token is the claim that's why
[1:25:21] the token did not come in full effect
[1:25:23] until after the opening of the seals
[1:25:28] hallelujah
[1:25:30] there you are that's why it came into
[1:25:32] full effect
[1:25:33] token's always been there but it didn't
[1:25:35] come into full effect until the seals
[1:25:37] were open
[1:25:38] now it's your assurance
[1:25:40] you're in the book
[1:25:45] you have that life you have the very
[1:25:47] literal life expressing itself something
[1:25:49] you can't do in yourself he does it
[1:25:51] through you
[1:25:54] amen amen you say i can't live it he
[1:25:57] never asked you to live it as a man he
[1:25:59] asked he said you give away to me and
[1:26:01] i'll live it
[1:26:03] i'll come in and live it i'll come in
[1:26:04] and speak it i'll come in and walk it
[1:26:06] i'll come in and do these things i will
[1:26:08] do it
[1:26:12] amen
[1:26:14] oh hallelujah you can let off any kind
[1:26:16] of pressure
[1:26:17] i want to get to a place here and it's
[1:26:18] just you bear with me i should be
[1:26:21] getting this close to finish he says
[1:26:23] this and that's the way the old body is
[1:26:26] well body this you live in an old body
[1:26:31] but the man that used to live in that
[1:26:32] old body that that
[1:26:35] that uh what do they call those sly
[1:26:37] little
[1:26:38] uh
[1:26:40] badger
[1:26:43] that badger no longer lives here
[1:26:46] that badger's been killed that badger's
[1:26:48] gone it may look like an old badger
[1:26:52] amen it may it may be dying an old
[1:26:55] badger you know rough and an old german
[1:26:57] he talks kind of rough and everything
[1:26:59] and very intimidating and
[1:27:04] i don't want to be intimidating
[1:27:08] but if it takes intimidation to wake you
[1:27:10] up
[1:27:11] [Laughter]
[1:27:13] like brother paul said he got i make him
[1:27:15] a little
[1:27:16] mad i upset his apple cart
[1:27:21] maybe i intimidate him
[1:27:23] that's not my purpose
[1:27:25] not my purpose at all
[1:27:28] all right
[1:27:29] so don't let ever don't put your don't
[1:27:31] get them to look at man and let man do
[1:27:33] anything
[1:27:35] the word does it
[1:27:37] then just rejoice
[1:27:40] the word uncovers
[1:27:42] it uncovers doesn't it
[1:27:46] i can imagine john the baptist sitting
[1:27:48] out there mud up to his knees and little
[1:27:50] skin on him yelling to the top of his
[1:27:52] lips i wonder how many he intimidated
[1:27:55] i wonder how many that jesus did when he
[1:27:57] took ropes and looked upon him with
[1:27:59] anger
[1:28:01] he looked upon him with anger
[1:28:07] think of that
[1:28:08] so don't get up tight
[1:28:10] with people because we all have mistakes
[1:28:12] we all have failures we all do this we
[1:28:14] all do that
[1:28:16] but when you meet him
[1:28:19] and you know you're in him
[1:28:21] amen just let go and let god use you the
[1:28:24] way he wants to use you and if anything
[1:28:27] isn't right he'll show you
[1:28:29] is that right
[1:28:30] you bet he will
[1:28:32] you bet brother brown said just let him
[1:28:35] get on the inside if you start to do any
[1:28:37] little thing wrong he'll show you
[1:28:39] he's your guide
[1:28:42] questions and answers he answered that
[1:28:44] question amen all right
[1:28:46] now so he that's joined the lord's one
[1:28:49] spirit and that's his way as the wiz
[1:28:50] with the old body
[1:28:52] it's bore the image of the heavenly
[1:28:55] but it's not you yet it's not you
[1:29:03] praise the lord
[1:29:05] yet it's not you
[1:29:07] you are on the inside of that body
[1:29:13] you
[1:29:14] comma the spirit of god
[1:29:17] is on the inside of that body
[1:29:22] who are you
[1:29:24] i'm going to read about that in just a
[1:29:25] moment probably close right there with
[1:29:27] that in the church age but you're the
[1:29:30] new creation
[1:29:32] you're his race
[1:29:35] all right
[1:29:36] that's what makes the outside that you
[1:29:39] the spirit of god on the inside of that
[1:29:41] body is what makes the outside come into
[1:29:44] subjection
[1:29:45] because the inside is pulling it
[1:29:48] see
[1:29:49] bringing it in line with the word of god
[1:29:52] you're inside you yourself your being
[1:29:57] philippians 2 13 it said is god which
[1:29:59] worketh in you
[1:30:01] both to will and to do
[1:30:04] will and do
[1:30:05] of his good pleasure
[1:30:08] praise the lord can you trust it yes
[1:30:10] all right galatians 2 20 says
[1:30:13] i was crucified with christ paul said
[1:30:15] yet i live yet not i
[1:30:17] but christ liveth in me
[1:30:20] and the life that i now live in the
[1:30:21] flesh i live by the faith of the son of
[1:30:23] god who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:30:27] she's no longer i living
[1:30:29] the devil is just beating on a dead man
[1:30:32] it's not me living it's christ in me
[1:30:34] living that's where i stand
[1:30:38] that's my identification
[1:30:40] so next time you make a failure and fall
[1:30:42] and god allowed it to happen
[1:30:48] he pre-planned it
[1:30:51] i'll just pull right over here to what
[1:30:52] we want to get to and i'll just put this
[1:30:55] part of it here he said you were all
[1:30:57] pre-planned by god nothing happens by
[1:31:00] chance to a believer
[1:31:03] it's all ordained of god amen
[1:31:08] god wanted to show himself mighty in you
[1:31:11] so he let you go up through struggles
[1:31:12] it's a few failures do you think the
[1:31:14] word failed then who failed
[1:31:19] wasn't the word right
[1:31:21] aren't you the word
[1:31:23] this isn't the real you
[1:31:25] who failed
[1:31:27] you didn't

[1:34:26] all right we covered that now
[1:34:29] now he's standing in the midst of the
[1:34:31] church as he stands there revealing who
[1:34:34] he is in this last stage he calls
[1:34:36] himself the author of the creation of
[1:34:38] god there this is another creation
[1:34:41] this has to do with the church
[1:34:44] the bride

[1:34:58] all right i want you to go with me just
[1:35:00] real quick over to revelations 1 5. i
[1:35:02] want to get these scriptures before i
[1:35:04] get too enclosed in this
[1:35:06] revelations 1 5 and jesus christ who is
[1:35:09] the faithful witness and the first
[1:35:11] begotten of the dead and the prince of
[1:35:14] the kings of the earth unto him that
[1:35:16] loved us hallelujah
[1:35:19] and washed us from our sins in his own
[1:35:22] blood
[1:35:24] that's a perfect blood yes
[1:35:26] and if the perfect blood is loosing you
[1:35:28] then the loosing is complete
[1:35:32] there is now therefore no condemnation
[1:35:35] them that are in christ jesus who have
[1:35:37] that life to prove they've come through
[1:35:39] that blood that's what the token gives
[1:35:42] amen
[1:35:44] no condemnation to them that are in
[1:35:46] christ jesus and those that are in
[1:35:48] christ jesus walk not after the flesh
[1:35:51] but after the spirit
[1:35:53] that's what the devil hates
[1:35:57] if i can just get you on the flesh side
[1:36:00] but see we've had a word that told us
[1:36:02] what the soul is
[1:36:04] and what the spirit is
[1:36:08] amen
[1:36:09] hallelujah my my my what a message all
[1:36:12] right
[1:36:13] now
[1:36:16] so then we go we go to one more here i
[1:36:19] want to get in that's
[1:36:20] in colossians 1 18 i think we i may not
[1:36:24] have to read let me look at this first
[1:36:26] because that
[1:36:27] that may be already pretty well covered
[1:36:31] okay and he is the head of the body the
[1:36:33] church who is the beginning the
[1:36:36] firstborn from the dead pretty much said
[1:36:38] the same thing in revelation 1 5. he's
[1:36:40] the firstborn from the dead firstborn
[1:36:43] from the dead
[1:36:44] passed from death to life
[1:36:47] he raised again because i live you live
[1:36:50] also because i live you live also then
[1:36:54] what does that make you the resurrection
[1:36:57] and the life
[1:36:58] you are on the inside of you right now
[1:37:01] christ in you you are the resurrection
[1:37:04] and the life
[1:37:06] there i'll say it again you are the
[1:37:09] resurrection
[1:37:10] and the life
[1:37:12] amen hallelujah
[1:37:16] let off the pressure
[1:37:18] that's right you're that new creation
[1:37:21] all right
[1:37:23] can you give me just a just a hair more
[1:37:25] all right
[1:37:32] okay so he is the that this he is
[1:37:36] standing amidst the church he's the
[1:37:38] author of the creation of god this is
[1:37:40] another creation this has to do with the
[1:37:42] church this is a special designation of
[1:37:45] himself
[1:37:47] he is the creator of that church the
[1:37:50] heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:37:53] bride
[1:37:57] she then stands perfect within and
[1:37:59] without
[1:38:01] in his sight
[1:38:04] no fault there is no fault in her
[1:38:07] he cannot see one fault
[1:38:09] then we need to look through god's eyes
[1:38:12] there we let off the pressure
[1:38:15] because you are that creation
[1:38:19] all right
[1:38:20] now
[1:38:21] we come right back around here said he
[1:38:24] said heavenly he that is the creator of
[1:38:26] that church the heavenly bridegroom
[1:38:27] created his own bride as the spirit of
[1:38:29] god came down and created in the virgin
[1:38:32] mary the cells from which his own body
[1:38:34] was born in the natural i want to repeat
[1:38:36] that he created the very cells in the
[1:38:38] womb of mary for that body
[1:38:41] and what about the spiritual cells he
[1:38:42] created inside of you
[1:38:47] amen
[1:38:48] that's right all right now you know that
[1:38:50] body's waiting because it's testified
[1:38:52] you already met it your theophany you've
[1:38:54] met it you haven't entered into it yet
[1:38:56] but you met it because when the word
[1:38:58] become alive in you you've met your
[1:39:00] theophany
[1:39:03] that word body that word form body

[1:39:08] the resurrection
[1:39:10] amen are you with me i didn't lose you
[1:39:12] on that
[1:39:13] all right now
[1:39:14] now watch and said lo
[1:39:17] he said now
[1:39:19] so it wasn't nothing of mary that he
[1:39:21] created the last saddened by he said he
[1:39:24] just said lo a body has thou father
[1:39:26] prepared for me god not mary provided
[1:39:30] that body
[1:39:32] god not david provided that body
[1:39:40] because it's in me like it was in mary
[1:39:43] this is an old shuck
[1:39:46] amen it's just a carrier
[1:39:49] hallelujah
[1:39:51] just a
[1:39:52] carrier but the shucks dying the chuck
[1:39:55] has moved out of the way
[1:39:57] so the word can manifest itself

[1:40:21] hallelujah
[1:40:23] i'll start preaching here in a minute
[1:40:26] all right
[1:40:27] all right now
[1:40:29] he said mary was just the human
[1:40:31] incubator she was the pentecostal shock
[1:40:34] she carried the holy ghost and brought
[1:40:36] him to birth it was a god man
[1:40:39] he it was a god man
[1:40:46] well
[1:40:47] so is the bride
[1:40:50] well outside she's nothing but man but
[1:40:52] inside she's more than a man
[1:40:55] amen
[1:40:57] that's right
[1:40:58] all right
[1:41:01] so he was
[1:41:03] now he was the new creation he was the
[1:41:06] son of god he was the new creation
[1:41:09] man and god met and joined
[1:41:12] that ought to settle it man and god met
[1:41:15] and joined it was through him that we
[1:41:18] could enjoy this life
[1:41:22] see
[1:41:22] he was the first of the new race he was
[1:41:26] the first of the new race
[1:41:29] he is the head of this new race
[1:41:32] and he is the head of the body of the
[1:41:34] church who is the beginning the
[1:41:37] firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:41:38] things he might have the oversight which
[1:41:41] is the preeminence
[1:41:43] can you give him the oversight
[1:41:45] whether you understand it or not
[1:41:49] whether you understand it whether your
[1:41:50] senses understand it look regardless of
[1:41:52] how radical it is he said so he said he
[1:41:55] would be he's in you he's guiding you
[1:41:57] can you let go and just let him lead and
[1:41:59] say lord i'll follow

[1:43:05] done
[1:43:07] with this much of it there you can see
[1:43:10] now watch i'm coming to a point here
[1:43:12] that in all things he might have the
[1:43:14] preeminence
[1:43:15] if any man be in christ he is a new
[1:43:17] creature
[1:43:18] corinthians 5 17 second corinthians 5 17
[1:43:21] he is a new creation he's a new creation
[1:43:25] old things are passed away behold all
[1:43:28] things are become new
[1:43:30] there you can see that that though man
[1:43:33] was the of the old order
[1:43:36] or creation now in union with christ he
[1:43:39] has become the new creation of god
[1:43:43] for we are his workmanship created in
[1:43:46] union with christ
[1:43:49] jesus unto good works and remember those
[1:43:51] good works he hath already before
[1:43:53] ordained you'd walk in them so let off
[1:43:55] the pressure
[1:43:58] all right now
[1:44:00] and you put on the new man put you on
[1:44:03] the new man which after god has created
[1:44:05] and which after god is created you see
[1:44:08] the beginning god creating himself into
[1:44:10] his body amen in a body created is
[1:44:14] righteousness and true holiness the new
[1:44:16] creation now watch what he says here the
[1:44:18] new creation is not the old creation
[1:44:21] made over
[1:44:22] right
[1:44:23] or it could not be called a new creation
[1:44:28] this is exactly what it says it is the
[1:44:30] new creation
[1:44:32] listen carefully here we're coming to
[1:44:34] something real good right here he said
[1:44:36] what it's exactly what it says it's a it
[1:44:38] is the nuclear it
[1:44:40] it says it it
[1:44:41] this is exactly what it says it is
[1:44:44] new creation
[1:44:46] it is another creation
[1:44:48] see it's his race another race the
[1:44:50] beginning of that race
[1:44:52] see
[1:44:53] and brother branham called it a super
[1:44:54] race
[1:44:56] pick up your pen and write
[1:44:58] brother brown didn't call it that he
[1:45:00] wrote out what god said it's a super
[1:45:01] race she'll be a super peep a super race
[1:45:05] all right
[1:45:08] it is another creation
[1:45:10] listen now distinct
[1:45:12] from
[1:45:13] the old
[1:45:14] one separated different
[1:45:18] set apart from the old one all right
[1:45:21] it is another creation
[1:45:24] distinct from the old one
[1:45:26] no
[1:45:27] longer i'm reading this real slow so we
[1:45:29] don't miss it no longer is he dealing by
[1:45:32] ways of the flesh
[1:45:38] hallelujah
[1:45:40] hallelujah
[1:45:42] no longer is he dealing with david by
[1:45:44] way of flesh
[1:45:46] that was under the law
[1:45:50] amen is that right no longer is he
[1:45:53] dealing by way of the flesh
[1:45:55] that's how he dealt with israel he chose
[1:45:58] abraham and of abraham's issue came the
[1:46:00] godly isaac line but now out of every
[1:46:03] kindred tribe and nation he has purposed
[1:46:05] a new creation he's the first of that
[1:46:08] creation he was god created in the form
[1:46:12] of a man he was god created in the form
[1:46:15] of a man now by his spirit he's creating
[1:46:19] many sons unto himself
[1:46:23] god the creator creating himself a part
[1:46:27] of his creation this is the true
[1:46:31] revelation of god
[1:46:35] this is the true revelation of god
[1:46:38] amen this was his purpose
[1:46:43] come back to purpose
[1:46:45] this purpose took form through election
[1:46:49] that is why he could look down in the
[1:46:51] last to the last stage right now when
[1:46:53] all would be over
[1:46:55] and see himself still in the midst of
[1:46:57] the church
[1:46:59] as author of this new creation what form
[1:47:01] is he in the midst of the church if we
[1:47:03] go back into revelations 1 we find he's
[1:47:05] dressed in a long road we find his paps
[1:47:08] are about with a golden girdle and
[1:47:10] brother branham said he's in the form of
[1:47:12] his bride yes he is amen
[1:47:17] i've got the quote if you ever want it
[1:47:19] he's in the form of his bride that's his
[1:47:21] bride there he said but he's the son of
[1:47:23] man in bride form
[1:47:26] standing in the midst of his church
[1:47:30] judge
[1:47:31] white hair
[1:47:34] who's going to judge the world
[1:47:38] well you say the word will judge the
[1:47:39] world son of man will judge the world
[1:47:40] but who's he doing it through
[1:47:44] amen and if we can find where that is
[1:47:46] then we'll see where
[1:47:47] love
[1:47:48] is
[1:47:50] amen
[1:47:52] all right now so
[1:47:55] this was his purpose took form through
[1:47:57] election members to election not human
[1:47:59] instrumentality not human not human
[1:48:01] merit
[1:48:03] see he's the author of this new creation
[1:48:05] of god his sovereign power his sovereign
[1:48:07] power brought it to pass by his own
[1:48:09] decree he elected the members of this
[1:48:12] new creation
[1:48:13] praise the lord are
[1:48:15] one of them one of them one of them i'm
[1:48:18] so glad that i can say i'm one of them
[1:48:20] amen
[1:48:21] is that right yes
[1:48:23] you're that new creation
[1:48:25] who's the new creation you the spirit of
[1:48:28] god in you the word living
[1:48:31] and operative
[1:48:36] and a discerner
[1:48:38] the thoughts and intents
[1:48:40] and dividing us under maryland bone
[1:48:44] amen
[1:48:45] and of soul and spirit
[1:48:48] thank god if we didn't have that we
[1:48:50] wouldn't know who we are if we hadn't
[1:48:51] had the opening of the seal we'd never
[1:48:53] see the fullness of himself revealed
[1:48:56] the bride is the finished mystery
[1:49:00] of god
[1:49:04] boy that places it places where his
[1:49:05] throne is it puts where he's running and
[1:49:07] what his house is and where is his
[1:49:09] temple
[1:49:10] and where does he work where do we
[1:49:12] worship him at
[1:49:14] where he put his name where'd he put his
[1:49:16] name
[1:49:19] i guess if you're married to him you
[1:49:21] know already put his name
[1:49:24] in his body
[1:49:25] in his church
[1:49:27] amen
[1:49:28] that's right yeah she was mrs adam part
[1:49:31] of mr adam yeah
[1:49:33] that's right
[1:49:35] this is mrs jesus christ only one
[1:49:37] difference in that name mr and mrs one
[1:49:39] letter
[1:49:41] one's mr one's misses
[1:49:43] mrs and mr
[1:49:47] all right
[1:49:49] the only difference between you and him
[1:49:50] is that you by pastor theophany come
[1:49:52] down here to be tried and tested when
[1:49:54] you heard the word you become that word
[1:49:56] because you were his thought to begin
[1:49:58] with
[1:49:59] oh my hallelujah god i'm so glad okay
[1:50:03] i'm closing
[1:50:05] he brought it to how else could he know
[1:50:06] he was standing in the midst of the
[1:50:08] church receiving glory from his brother
[1:50:09] and if he did not make sure all things
[1:50:13] oh excuse me he predestinated because he

[1:52:46] who worketh all things after the council
[1:52:48] of his own will hallelujah brother

[1:53:16] that faith in you is the believer
[1:53:18] is so be it that settles it that
[1:53:22] substance
[1:53:23] that's the amen
[1:53:26] amen right
[1:53:29] let's stand together let me read this
[1:53:31] last quote brother branham said right
[1:53:33] here
[1:53:35] and then we'll have to come back to pick
[1:53:37] it up
[1:53:38] in things that are to be next time
[1:53:43] if you leave that word you have left god
[1:53:48] if you leave that word
[1:53:50] you have left god thus he is presenting
[1:53:53] himself to the church
[1:53:55] and indeed to all ages of all ages i am
[1:53:58] the word
[1:54:00] if you want deity in your midst then
[1:54:03] welcome and receive the word
[1:54:07] don't never don't ever let anyone or
[1:54:10] anything
[1:54:11] get between you and that word
[1:54:15] this which i'm giving you the word is a
[1:54:17] revelation of myself
[1:54:20] then that word also is a revelation
[1:54:23] of you
[1:54:27] amen
[1:54:28] because you're in his thought you and
[1:54:31] when it became word you were in that
[1:54:33] hidden in that word for your decreed
[1:54:36] season
[1:54:38] amen
[1:54:39] amen amen amen amen then you came forth
[1:54:43] in very plain language
[1:54:45] the true bride of christ was in the mind
[1:54:47] of god eternally though not expressed
[1:54:50] until each came forth in the designated
[1:54:52] decreed season
[1:54:54] as each member come forth it became
[1:54:57] expressed and took us place in the body
[1:55:01] thus this bride is the literal spoken
[1:55:04] word seed bride and though she is
[1:55:06] feminine designation she's called the
[1:55:08] body of christ it is very apparent that
[1:55:11] she ought to be for she was
[1:55:13] predestinated in him came from the same
[1:55:16] source
[1:55:17] was eternal with him and is now
[1:55:19] manifesting god
[1:55:21] and is now manifesting god in a many
[1:55:24] membered body whereas once god
[1:55:27] manifested in one member even our lord
