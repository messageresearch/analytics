sister laura as well amen so if you'd come for the chris and that's right brother vasily not basically sergey silly's here the sergey he's on the road so let's remember him as well um if you don't mind real quick i did something kind of absurd this evening and so i want to remember this guy in prayer but i just was driving around the fred meyer parking lot waiting for my wife and there's this young man there with his car pumping his tire and felt the lord leading me to give him a little gift and that's not just my that's just me so i circled and i lost my opportunity and i felt bad then the opportunity came up again i said no it's just me i lost that opportunity and then i felt bad and then it happened again i had another opportunity so i was like okay whatever as awkward and weird as it seems i'm just gonna do it and uh he just i just hey what's your name you know and mark and uh he's just coming out of the air force and um you know he's looking to do some different things and kind of talked about that but i don't know there's just some kind of connection there um i don't know what it is but i just feel if you all wouldn't mind praying for mark that's his name and we'll remember him tonight i don't know what it is i don't know where it's going to go i gave him my email address so he has contact but i told him i say i'm a christian this might seem weird but i felt led to give this to you and he was just lit up are you serious so um not to lift myself up but to lift him him up you know i i have no idea where this goes but i just felt led to do that and and then we sing that song just now so okay lord you know maybe you're just a lesson for me for obedience i don't know let's pray heavenly father lord jesus we just thank you lord for your your this house that we're able to come here tonight lord as i know is on all of our hearts and minds our ukrainian brothers and sisters father who can't do this right now and along with all the other chaos they're living through father but lord what the blessing it is lord when when we are again reminded that this is a privilege lord we may not take it for granted lord jesus and lord on that lord we just want to remember them over their father what they're going through lord we can't even begin to understand but we can't apply prayer father because you understand you've been through war you've been through chaos you've been through lord all of what they're going through lord jesus and they're your children and all things are done for your glory father for the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord and we don't say that with any callous father we say that with confidence in you lord jesus so yes that you just give him a special portion father brother barry brother jeremy clayville over there in poland right now i pray you just continue to be with them lord as they go about your work lord jesus and may they just be safe lord and come home say father may they just be able to do good while they're their father lord we want to just to remember again the different needs in our midst with a sergey out on the road traveling i pray you just give him traveling mercies and be with him

couple of announcements just one brother chris mentioned his prayer brother abel will be with us on sunday so let's be in prayer about that and then following that we'll be having a fellowship potluck so gather downstairs after after that meeting and i guess get a hold of whoever you ladies get ahold of do what you do and uh brothers you're not left out either you do your part too i won't call anybody to make pies but [Laughter] anyways um i was listening to the flashing red light of his coming today i had a chance just to work by myself so i just put my earbuds in and brother branham sings that song the day of redemption is near i was like you know we haven't sung that in a while so let's sing that that's number 503. [Music] nations are breaking and israel's awakening the signs that the prophet foretold the gentiles days numbered with horrors in cumber eternity soon will unfold a day of redemption is near men's hearts are failing for fear be filled with the spirit your land's trimmed your redemption is here the fig tree is growing jerusalem's restoring her national lifelong dethrone today she is calling her ladder reigns falling return o disperse to a day of redemption is near man's hearts are failing for fear he filled with the spirit your lap's trimmed and clear the cup your redemption is near heaven's powers are shaking and many are mistaking god's meaning to be of the sky god's church is the power that's shaking this hour the day of redemption is not a day of redemption is near men's hearts are failing for fear be filled with the spirit your land's dreamed and clear the cop your redemption is here false prophets are like god's truth they're denying that jesus the christ is our god through this generation spurns god's revelation we'll walk where the apostles have drawn a day of redemption is near men's hearts are failing for fear be filled with the spirit your land trimmed and cleared look up your redemption is [Music] your redemption [Music] is we say amen to that amen we see every sign that the scripture said would be in our day we're seeing them coming forth we're seeing the evidence of it and yet you take as it were i'm just going to call it a collective thought that the prophet spoke you don't find one sign and then just take that sign and say this is the only thing because you see through the ages there's been signs that the saints of old looked at and thought okay the day must be now because of this sign here but it is the collective revelation of the word in this hour so we're not looking at it and you know some things that i interact with you know just lit up this is it russia going for the gold they're i mean the oil going for the and and yet my brother and sister we just see it as a sign the sign that really matters to you and i is god present right here in our lives that's the sign that matters not what someone's doing here or what someone's doing there because for all we know tomorrow russia may turn around and go home and then we've got all wound up i remember a brother one time talking about 1977. brother one time talking about how they got so caught up in that that all reasoning left them and when it didn't come to pass there were so many in their circle that were were shook so hard they walked away you see we look to the word let god bring the signs to the world and we'll look at the signs of the word coming to pass in our lives amen i want to speak to you this evening amen um uh on we are witnesses again and um i really appreciated that brother chris uh we are witnesses you see it it's not our job to figure out how what we are led to do is going to come about that's right it's not our job to try to to till the soil plant the seed water the seed and hope it comes to harvest our job at the moment as brother chris said and i appreciate the candid approach of of admitting i i didn't follow that and then i get another opportunity and i didn't follow that but god wanted me to speak to this man enough i get another opportunity and i i just find that beautiful because we are witnesses amen i want to speak to you tonight on the temple of the holy ghost thank you brother jay once again this closing song well several of them uh just stirred my heart tonight as our thoughts of studying uh to this and you know this little something i hope you don't mind would it be okay to be excited tonight can we can we have some prior approval so that we don't have to go through the application process during the service because i actually got excited about this very simple thought amen just very very simple thought nothing deep tonight saints but yet i i do believe there's an element of it that is deep let's uh turn to our bibles as we stand first corinthians 6 chapter verses 14 through 20. brother vasily sister tomah good to see you amen i thought maybe you might be somewhere between hither and yawn but you're here tonight and we're happy for that amen uh definitely remember brother sergey he's he's wanting to be back here for this this uh weekend and uh expressed to me that um well i won't share the conversation some might not understand our conversation but he expressed me very strongly his heart's desire to be here for this weekend so let's turn first corinthians 6 14 and god hath both raised up the lord and will also raise up us by his own power isn't that exciting i i find that you see by scripture here as paul is speaking to the corinthians he's basically saying if i could put it this way the very same thing that god did to jesus christ he's going to do to you wow i'm telling you i get excited at that thought right amen i don't have to take a lesser promise or a lesser portion as it were now i am not jesus christ but i am now many people will be like oh that's just uh yeah that you're too far out you're too far out but i'm sorry my brother and sister he was the firstborn of many brethren and i am of those brothers yes hallelujah know ye not that your bodies are members of christ shall i then take the members of christ and make them the members of a harlot god forbid what know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body for two saith he shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit now in case i just get excited and go over that my brother and sister here is the perfect example of those dwelling in the flesh the carnal approach to the gospel of jesus christ and those coming in the spirit anointed of the holy ghost and it's right here in the word i wouldn't even say it's really hid but yet it kind of is hid because people don't realize they're looking into the carnal realm and saying of course now if one joins himself to a harlot a woman of the streets that this is bad but remember we're dealing in a spiritual warfare not of flesh and blood but of principalities and powers of darkness and if i could interject or attach to the end of that particular scripture the powers of darkness and the powers of light remember for everything that's being done under the uh auspicer umbrella of the powers of darkness there is even more and greater being done under the power of light hallelujah now if satan knew he could overcome us he would be rampaging like you have never seen but he comes to a believer he comes to the word and he's got to find a way to get around it he's got to burrow under it or you know try to do something two saith he shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without his body but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body very strong words what know ye not that your body is a temple of the holy ghost which is in you my this this temple my brother and sister is not one made of hands that we could drive down park in the parking lot and walk in this is a temple of the holy ghost which is in you amen now i don't know where this spirit is around the message where people are confused about whether it's god or what it is that's in us or who's leading us or who's guiding us but there's definitely a spirit moving through the land that is trying to break down the fundamental foundation of the godhead because if it comes if it comes to an impersonal position then you will worship him personally but when it comes to a real living example as it were you know god is in you you know the life of christ himself is dwelling in you then it becomes very personal hallelujah which he have of god and ye are not your own well this is this gets a really tough row here right now for year bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods heavenly father we ask for your guidance tonight lord may your leadership be upon us we only speak your word according to your word we ask that in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated now as we would look back through this i i hope tonight that i just can keep this in a in a short and orderly fashion when i preached it to myself today i was able to preach it in less than an hour so we'll see how this goes amen but you see my brother and sister as we look going right back to verse 14 i've already said this but to go into my thought god hath both raised up the lord and will also raise up us by his own power see so there's no other influence there was not going to be a man interjected into this to to be raising the people up now the prophet of god many times my brother and sister the critics say well why was he standing there he's waiting for an angel and this is this is uh something they would criticize as though there's some other strange force there but my brother and sister you've felt it before right in this service that when the holy spirit comes down and starts to move amongst the people move on your heart how there is a difference in the atmosphere around you now imagine each and every one of us coming in under that anointing and and i cut off several quotes and things that deal with that atmosphere but my brother and sister you come and no atmosphere or the wrong atmosphere we go home feeling very dry but when that atmosphere comes around us we tend to just mold or just mellow right into that atmosphere and it's in that atmosphere that the holy spirit truly moves upon us and changes our our condition or our circumstance or opens the word in revelation to us and so it's there that we truly want to know this atmosphere but you know it just makes my heart so happy to to see how paul brings us to the corinthians and and he gives them the hope that as we have seen christ raised from the dead amen we shall also in like manner be raised from the dead and those that are sitting here tonight free from the burden of sin free from the spirit of laodicea the chains have been broken and we are now raised up from that position of bondage into a position of liberty and i say thank you lord that we can find liberty in an age as the prophet of god said would become an age of neurotics and that came to pass but we have been by god's grace able to step beyond that because we've been raised up by the power of god amen and so i want to focus on verse 15 for just a moment know ye not that your bodies are the members of christ and we look at this and realize now the word members can deal in the flesh that we could be members of grace tabernacle as it were or our arm would be a member of our body an extension of our body so it would be also by definition a member but we'll look at this my brother and sister and this is really truly what got me excited i tried to to figure out how to put this at the end of the sermon so that i could keep you all in anticipation to that point but i just thought you know i can't amen we're going to start this off with some fireworks and by god's grace we'll still remember the fireworks by the time we get home amen but you look at this he said no ye not that your bodies okay so this body my brother and sister we've already delineated the fact that god is speaking through paul in a spiritual context and a carnal context and so as we'll look at this we can look at this flesh and say well my hand is a member of my body my foot etc but let's look in this spiritual aspect let's look at this tonight as as the bride of jesus christ says that our bodies are members of christ amen look at this it's kind of a difficult definition in a sense a constituent peace of a complex structure especially a load-bearing component now if you're a carpenter by trade you would say yep i know exactly what they're talking about you look at this you see my brother and sister this is not a member by signing our names it's not a member by just coming because we don't have a membership role it's not remember by just claiming i i'm part of i believe the message but we're a component in other words god didn't come along and say well we're missing this piece i guess we'll just move on without it god says no you are a component of me you are a structural integral part of me and i am not going to build a house that is lacking there is no such thing as a shortage in the house of god if we saints have a shortage in our life you can no doubt look back now i'm not saying that it's always yourself but we can look back and oftentimes people say well well my minister my minister the pastor of the church doesn't feed me but i want to know how hungry were you when you came because the prophet of god said if there's no church for you you go to a church that preaches that jesus christ is divine what you mean he sent the early believers of the message back to their home church or back to the church down the street or back to his church in another city how could he do that when he says that there are called out people and he sends them back why could he do that because he knew as an integral component of the gospel of jesus christ they could not stay somewhere they didn't fit we can take this over into the chief cornerstone and all that goes without of the foundation in the house and the walls and the corners of the kingdom my brother and sister but you have to realize god reveals to the bride of christ who she is in the body of christ that she can come and fit into her place i'm sorry my brother and sister i'm simply could not be fed in a church that didn't have godhead correctly they did not have revelation of the word that was still feeding an old dead letter the gospel of luther was a powerful gospel in its day the power of the gospel of wesley was a powerful gospel and go down through all the ministries of that time powerful ministries my brother and sister but they without us oh come on they without us there's a component in the hour that we are living in that has to come to fruition has to be put in its proper place and must be manifest and recognized oh you know we struggle sometimes well i i i don't mean i'm not talking about myself i don't want to look like this mom my brother sister come to the hour that we recognize speak it i am a component of the word in this hour there won't be a rapture until the full revelation of jesus christ has come down in each component hallelujah i've been told you're kind of arrogant or proud about not being deceived but my brother and sister when you read that word you recognize it told you not me not someone else jesus christ the word told you you won't be deceived why because every component that makes up who you are is christ himself amen look at what the word said if i take you and i couple or bring you together with a harlot can't produce it come on saints can produce it you can take a harlot message mix it with a pure word and come up with the word seed of jesus christ you can't do it it has to be a pure seed amen and it got to come down into a pure heart and the two of those then will bring forth the word in its purity but there's constituent peace of a complex structure amen we look at this now how can this be where would god actually speak in these terms i mean would god be thinking about a glue lamb or a tji or something of that nature yeah he would yes he would you see god said that this house would be give me a pass on kind of blending the scripture here he said this house would be fitly joined together this house is not a collection of leftover pieces you imagine spending five six seven eight hundred thousand dollars find out your house was built of the rubbish left over of all the rest of houses on the street you wouldn't do it god's not building this house in this hour right now out of some leftover components people say well william branham he plagiarized these guys i'm sorry he took an original piece from almighty god and said it belongs in this age also and it belongs right here and they say it's plagiarism well i'm sorry but when god is speaking he give us permission to say what he said in fact he said i'll probably put a curse on you if you try to blend someone else's sayings with my saying so we got to go back and get that original piece because god isn't going to have you you know when we remodeled one of the houses we lived in amen we we started just like any remodel you start you tear off i need to just change this or do this and brother jay knows what i'm talking about for sure because he's helped us through these amen so you tear this off and you go oh my goodness look at the wiring here we got to go ahead and go through this wall into the next room and we're tearing everything off of it until we come into a room in the house i live in right now was in the bathroom of the house we live in right now and they took a two before this tall and nailed one on the side and it went here and then they nailed another one on the side of this and then had a little short piece to get it to the ceiling ah i tell you what that gives you confidence doesn't it it gives you confidence that what you're what you're living in will it hold the ceiling up but my brother and sister god didn't come and piece this word together god come and gave you the original word the original component the original spirit and he said don't take it back into some filthy a carnal thing over here don't blend that my brother and sister and look what it is i want i hope you get excited about this my brother and sister i got excited when the lord laid it on my heart it wasn't like i was flipping through the bible and just found this and come across it the lord laid it on my heart and i said is that right and i went and i looked it up and i'm telling you my brother and sister it's a component of our age because if you're not an overcomer you're not anything you can be an overcomer and not overcome everything and just have a religious spirit but when you are a true holy ghost filled overcomer you say well i'm waiting for the hour i shouldn't have put that quote up there you guys are reading that thing amen but if you're looking oh when i am ready when i reach this pinnacle god can use me you know what god does he starts right there at the simplest little thing and you overcome that and he drops an element i'm going to call it a seed of faith and we go wow i didn't used to overcome that i just overcame that thank you lord now you get proud and boastful you'll go right back and take that lesson again but then you keep moving and something else comes from the side over here and by god's grace there's enough faith in you you say you know what i believe i believe that word is for me and you claim that and another seed of faith comes down in there and then you have a challenge the devil tries to stumble you and you're able to overcome that and suddenly you find now my brother and sister we sometimes put all this saying oh they're really they're really they're really spiritual they've been a christian for 50 years don't mean a single thing i'll tell you what makes that christian that you can so to speak boast about is that one that has overcoming power whether they're 14 years old or they're 90 years old the one that's got the holy ghost and overcoming power in them is the one that we can look at and say lord i want to be like them lord if i was to to frame my life after a natural brother or sister i wanted to be like those there that are overcomers but look what the word said him that overcometh will i make a scab together two before in my house no sir he didn't even think a good two before it'd be enough he said i'm going to make you into a pillar i'm telling you my brother and sister a pillar designed to hold something up to contain support become integral of the complete structure must have a good foundation and when it's got a good foundation and god keeps building upon that pillar he comes along and he makes him a pillar in the temple of my god now people there will look and say yeah when we get to heaven we're going to be a pillar in that temple i'm telling you god's building temples right now and he's putting pillars in them temples that will hold up to every weight and pressure and storm of life and these pillars my brother and sister they didn't happen overnight they happened through many many fiery trials but they happen to the saint the believer that just keeps pressing on and saying god's word is true god is faithful it looks like all is wrong right now but my god is faithful and i'm going to stand and as you stand god starts to build you into an unmovable pillar and satan batters with storms of life and people mock and the mocking may be within your own family and people say the message people are stubborn they won't receive our correction and there's people within the message that would say of the revelation god has given stubborn spirit i tried to correct you but you see i if i remember right as a personal pronoun did i get that right there's the problem it was them personal going to correct you they wanted to be the one that could say he was wrong in his doctrine and i straightened him out well i happen to have one who raised me up the same way he raised up my lord jesus and if he wants to correct me he will correct me i don't need a personal pronoun to come along and tell you're not understanding the word you need to look at it like this you need to look at it like this you need to sit here you need to go there god's the one that put the foundation under that pillar and god said i'll lead this pillar pardon me from putting the word this way i'll lead this pillar to its proper position i'll lead you and guide you into all truth and the pillar can't say i want to be the basketball pole the pillar can't say i want to support this soccer net i want to be a goal post the pillar is built where god wants the pillar to stand you know otherwise saints i hope you catch this thought otherwise we would have a mecca in the message because we'd all want to go and be part of that one place that one spot that one event that's taking place but god said i'm going to position you all over the world everywhere from the most desolate places to the most populated places i'm glad god chose to put us somewhere in the middle but he says this where i want the pillar to be and so you see he said him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go out no more you know what this is saying you won't backslide you won't fall away you won't be lost you won't go away you go out no more you'll go not go out of my presence you'll not go out of my tabernacle no more i've sealed you for time and eternity and anchored you in the word for this hour and you're not going to go away now i don't mean to be real direct but i'm telling you my brother and sister you see so much of this coming now people saying well the lord told me i had a confirmation when i was at this stage of my life hear this and this and this that this was the truth 40 years later they say it's of the devil they're either right or wrong but they were either wrong then or they're wrong now look at the spirits you see the pillar has been subjected to the storms of life and they didn't keep the pillar repaired they didn't keep the pillar protected they just let all of that wash away and blow and do all of these things and then one day they come my brother and sister just visiting with a man we do business with today and just had a lovely conversation with him to teach a marriage seminar to him he has a good marriage but didn't always have a good marriage and we got to talking about the things of god and my brother and sister it's wonderful to be able to just share without it being condemning just to build the blocks and put them in place of this is what god is doing and this is what god looks at and god's position on a vow and god's position on the family and god's position on all of these things and be able to build that up my brother and sister but you see if we come to a place where we say we have it all when someone says i just noticed the corner of your pillar has been eroded by the sands it's a crack in your foundation don't tell me i've been following this message for 40 years you know phrase that's common in the world today just saying but he said i'll make a pillar and a pillar is something that is stalwart loyal reliable hard-working now look how this works my brother and sister when you have somebody i hope this don't skin the nose off nobody here at the church but when you have somebody that says they got the holy ghost and they're so lazy they don't even support their family i would doubt they have the holy ghost i know that's just kind of a rough way to put it but let's get right down to it because somebody that's going to be a pillar in the temple of my god is going to be loyal reliable and hard-working amen pick up the pen and write can i wait till they invent the computer and i'll get it written down then writing gives a little cramp in my arm you imagine the apostle paul of all the affliction ailment of his life and god commissions him right might not even they said he wrote in a large letter you don't see him saying i would have wrote it all down for you saints of the age but it was just too hard for me no sir he was faithful loyal reliable hard-working and that's what god's looking for sons and daughters of god we don't want to be that one that it just is too much effort to really give a whole heart mind body and soul to the lord it took an effort for me to die and i just couldn't put out that effort that's called lazy am i preaching too hard tonight okay good good now look at this he says here and he shall go out go no more out amen i love that i'm gonna go no more out this one that's been made a pillar has the word has bonded together amen everything necessary the prophet of god said everything you need to take the rapture is already on the printing press already in the church library no sir in you why god knew what he was making the pillar he knew and he said i'm going to build a people that can stand every earthquake as it were every uh tsunami every uh tornado and hurricane and every whatever of life i i can i can just build this pillar in my word now look at this saints he built it in his word and that word was you i should have included that quote it was just pretty awesome and i'm not even going to try pretty complex i'm going to try and uh recite it to you and i will write upon him the name of my god now as paul is speaking my brother and sister to the corinthians he is making a very bold declaration now if you have a name written on you you're not cattle but probably a few hundred thousand times in my life i have burned someone's brand on a cow and every one of those cows walked out of the chute stopped turned around looked at me and said thank you for putting my owner's name on my hip i appreciate it are you with me saints sometimes being marked with the name of your god includes a little bit of pain a little bit of suffering a little bit of time but behind all of that there is healing and then the name the mark is still upon you when you are healthy and strong once again but there's a season that it takes for god to mark you that he could look down and say that's my son that's my daughter now you can go and research what brother branham says about or how he lays out predestination my brother and sister but we know now i'm not trying to ascribe as though we're some intellectuals but we know the cost now of having the name of jesus christ burnt into our soul praise the lord i thought all my i love testimonies like this i remember a young brother he i say young you know probably around 30. got up and testified one time he said oh when i got saved he said i clicked my heels together and thought praise lord all my troubles are over he said why didn't they tell me about what was coming but you see god was putting upon him his name and putting his name upon him he didn't say this is going to bring you trials and troubles maybe even separations in your family and friendships and might cost you jobs and opportunities in the natural but you're going to praise me one day that you are there with my name in you hallelujah hallelujah i just get excited about that saints when i realize what it is to have his name in me he's going to call that back one day and if that name is in me i have got it oh pardon me for putting it this way but i've got it made in the shade amen when he calls his word back and that word is full all the way from the tip of my toes to the top of my head to the tip of my fingers i don't have to worry about making the rapture when he calls his word home i'm going so what i've got to do is step into my rightful position the apostle paul did not say him that overcometh will i quite possibly make a pillar but he said those that overcome i will make a pillar amen it's a past tense it's a positive past tense amen and the name of the city of my god which is a new jerusalem now do you realize when you go into the word people are thinking that this is all staked out as it were but do you know in the spiritual context the new jerusalem resides in you that is the dwelling place of almighty god people are saying well you know the thunders what what is what is god's voice the seven thunders my brother and sister people blow these things all out of proportion and the seven thunders is summed or brought right down into the very simplicity it's god's voice to you it's not god's voice to some man over here or some man over there god uses them go look up what brother branham i think i shared a little of it on sunday look up what brother branham talks about john that when john did that mighty work and he come back down to earth and he laid down their mighty wings and without the anointing of that position he wondered is jesus the christ and jesus didn't start saying john what happened to your faith john what did you do john you were such a great guy until you started doubting jesus just told those servants of john he said you just sit right here in this service on a wednesday night in grace tabernacle and you watch the word come you watch the faith of the saints rise up and take a hold of their promise and then you go witness this back to john that this truly is the christ now i tell you my brother and sister that's what god's doing in this hour he's come right down and placed it and witnesses are standing here we are witnesses my brother and sister we are witnesses to the one that might be backslid to the one that is starting to doubt to the one that's faith is weak we are witnesses if we all lay down we've got nothing i'm sorry i'm speaking kind of strident i'm just very excited in fact my chest hurts i might be having a heart attack if i die amen well anyway hallelujah sister jerry says don't talk like that well you know brother dawn bablitz used to say lord when you take me i want to be in the pulpit he's over in africa in the pulpit fell over dead hallelujah oh romania that's right anyway everybody's like oh this is so terrible no it wasn't god answered his prayer came his heart's desire amen so the name of my god the city of my god it's new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name now we're not going to get into that tonight because that's a whole nother subject with about 42 000 opinions upon what that really meant but i'm telling you if you can just take it in simplicity tonight would simplicity be just fine remember that brand i was talking about my new name i'm telling you i don't need to discern that new name or figure out this or figure out that i'll be just happy to have it branded upon me i'll be happy to be identified as mrs jesus christ i don't need to have some other mystery of this or mystery of that my brother and sister prophet of god said some things that don't pertain to salvation you can just step back from those things you don't have to figure it all out we got people that are can't live it but they can explain it are they really explaining it if they can't live it no because the revelation of the life that's contained in the word is missing amen hallelujah now you ever wonder saints this just for a moment just look you ever wonder how you've progressed to the place where you have an unshakable faith in god i just walked into church one day i had it no sir it would almost be as though you would say here let me roll up my sleeve i can show you the scars let me as it were figurative open my tunic show you the scars you see faith cometh by hearing are you with me faith cometh by hearing and god's not afraid as the master surgeon to inflict upon you what we in the flesh call grievous wounds and he calls it his divine love oh my brother and sister without being in the right spirit will decide god's too cruel i've had people say it right to my face you know i used to follow the lord i used to be a christian i used to do this but god's too bloody for me well i want his blood if he hadn't let his blood be shed which was just pretty bloody amen i would be just covered in sin and trespass but he come as a lamb that was slain amen for you and i not just simply something quick and neat my brother and sister they beat him into submission he learned obedience by the things he suffered here's your exemption card didn't come from christ did it [Music] imagine god wants you to recognize when you've sold out and decide you're an overcomer there's going to be times that being the pillar is not convenient being the pillar is not easy but oh the glory have you ever been like state house or the capital and you go there in these big massive granite pillars do you ever look at them close i know i'm kind of weird i'm sorry not a weird pastor because i'm over there i remember the last time i was ever at the state house you're looking at these shiny columns but when you go over and actually rub your hand down them there's all kinds of little nicks and dings and scratches and pits and that's what they were to be a pillar pretty from the outside pretty from a distance but up close marked by every trial marked by every time of satan's assault upon you but you're still there and you're beautiful and you are in that position of strength because you were called to be a member of christ you're a member of his own body and he said i don't care how many nicks you won't find it in the word saints where he says now if you have exceeded the numbers of nicks dings and scratches you're out he said just stand overcoming power stand on the word stand on the word can i say it again stand on the word saints and no matter what comes and hits and strikes against you no matter who comes against you or what satan might bring you stand and in god's eyes you're beautiful you're perfect because he's not looking at those as defects glory in the tribulation you know that's what people say i just can't serve a god that could glory in my tribulation well tribulation work with patience and you know what happens is now say this with a little humor i hope you're not not upset about this because most of us will not pray for patience can i get an amen god says you need patience so he just sends tribulation and tribulation worketh patience so you're going to get the patience one way or another whether you pray for it or you don't amen i'll tell you what i lift my hand tonight and i don't just do this figure too i do it from my heart i lift my hand and say lord i want to be a pillar i want to be a pillar i don't care what it takes to be a pillar in the house of my god i want to be a pillar because you see you can go easier you can go hard but you'll go you'll be a part of that amen so you know i look at this sometimes i wonder lord how what brought me here you know you might find this interesting maybe not if you don't i'm sorry but looking through some of my mother's stuff today found a letter that my mother wrote back to her parents 1953 she rode a bus a train an airplane all the way to panama to marry my dad and the very first words of these letters are david is so wonderful my god is so awesome my god is so wonderful when he said i want you to be my bride he didn't say i'm going to let it just be some little quick step there was something in me that we would ride the train the plane whatever it was to go to look him in the face and say my husband is so wonderful he's so beautiful to me now you know my mama was confused because she wrote in that letter that he was perfect but the letter we write we can declare him perfect we can declare him without fault and we can adore him beyond measure and not be an idolater oh hallelujah look at the privilege my brother and sister but right next to this letter in this this cabinet my mother had saved a postcard from her youngest son named paul who was backslid and is writing a postcard saying oh i'm just writing to say hello the work is good the money is not the best but the skiing is great and the only thing wrong is it costs a lot of money to go skiing and by the time you see this postcard i'll be in tucson i was living in colorado at the time and i look at that my dear mama has saved whatever you would call it a postcard from a backslidden kid right next to a love letter she wrote concerning her husband you see the time you didn't feel like a pillar the time you didn't feel like you were walking in god's will god said i'm kept right on building you up i have kept right on making you into what i want you to be might have a letter of your defeat i don't know i think i'm just going to quit serving the lord come on saints if i had a every letter i set down to write i'm resigning as a pastor through the years i'd need a whole file cabinet to hold them all but god looked at that and said oh he's feeling sorry for himself but i'm going to go ahead and keep the letter and then i'm going to remind him one day look i brought you through i brought you through your time of discouragement your time of weakness your time of failure i brought you through and i am not gonna condemn you but i will remind you that you were gonna quit i'm gonna remind you that you were attracted to the flesh and the sizzle of the world and i had to turn your eyes back and i say thank you lord for reminding me because otherwise the devil would make all the rest look even prettier but he says no nope you are a pillar in my temple and you will be in my temple you are my temple and i'm going to make you a stalwart christian to stand the spirits of laodicea to spa stand the spirits when it's your best friend or family member that's saying it's not true it's not good it's this it's that and god somehow just held you strengthened you and brought you through that and you come through that trial i tell you saints years ago i went through that my wife thought i was having a meltdown and i was reading all this garbage these people were writing and i found myself one day looking my wife and she says you're depressed and you get depressed when you read that garbage you see i wanted to help some of my friends sounds cruel doesn't it but the overcomer is helped by the word not helped by sympathetic friends not helped by those who prop them up what do we call that enabling they're not helped by us saying oh i'm so sorry they're helped by the word amen amen the prophet of god said the word in prayer is what changes things amen so don't go patting them on the back oh poor you poor you poor you my brother and sister for everyone who had a lousy pastor and gave up there's one who had a lousy pastor and pressed on amen for everyone that prayed for healing and never was healed there was one who prayed for healing and wasn't healed and pressed on amen come on what is god doing he's building a pillar an unshakeable stalwart faithful pillar oh my now verse 16. if we could go back brothers maybe i can somehow oh here go ahead brother mason get us back to verse 16 there in corinthians amen now some of this is pretty straight up young people i don't mean to put anything out in front of you that is but we're talking in the spiritual realm what know ye not that he which is joined to a harlot is one body for two saith he shall be one flesh now look my brother and sister we're looking now that applies to the flesh this applies to the flesh let's not let's not over spiritualize this and move it away my brother and sister you can't go out here and live in fornication expect god to bless you amen but look at this now in a spiritual realm which is joined to a harlot in one body now look what happened prophet of god said that when you introduce anything into the word he said it becomes a what spirit adulterous spirit but you see if you're not married to the word yet it would be fornication okay i know that's kind of strong words forgive me but look at this now look at the prostitute spirits of this age oh my come on saints anything for your money they will do anything for your money they'll have clubs they'll have games they'll turn the sanctuary into a giant whatever they'll even have i've seen where they've had poker night at church why prostitute spirit will do anything for your money kind of strong isn't it when you think about it so what is it the prostitute spirits of this stage amen those spirits are trying to get you yolk to something that can't produce the seed word they're trying to get you tied up tight to something that is not a legitimate producing a spirit producing the word amen that's why you know what look sorry i might come across like a grouchy whatever sometimes saying but we're not ever going to at grace tabernacle as long as god would allow me to have breath in my body to let some other spirit in that we would grow or be popular or have something that will be there the prophet of god said when that hap in the pot amen death is in the pot when that happens and i'm telling you i'd rather be a little church with life than a big church that's dead i'd rather be unpopular and unknown than to be known and have to do something as a quote inside my office says to do something that would hurt my lord hallelujah you see what is happening though they joined in one body amen they become one flesh and they can't separate themselves this is direct but they can't separate themselves they'll say amen to the word but they can't produce the life in the word now saints if you're a real believer and you're struggling in your life don't misunderstand me here you might be struggling in your life and you'd say i'm not producing the word but in your heart remember the prophet of god told that man backslid come back to the lord backslid again he's crying out i guess there's no hope for me and brother branham tells him because you are crying out i'm just paraphrasing because you're crying out it shows that god's still in there but what about when it comes down that they no longer care what the word said they no longer care come on saints i'm not talking about catholics amen oh come on oh my where am i at somebody help me invisible union yep that'll work okay i've got six minutes to be done jesus said you can't serve two gods at the same time you'll either serve god or mammon mammon is the world either loves the world or the things of the world the love of god is not even in him now my brother and sister i i want to make an emphasis on this to you tonight i realized one of the quotes i cut out kind of i shouldn't have the love of the world and we come to the house of god and say i love you lord i love you lord i love you lord and lord because i love you could you do something for me what is that no harlot spirit i'll love you i don't mean to be crafts here lord just protect our young people but i tell you what when a woman offers herself in the natural to someone else for something in return do you realize that spirit can even be in a marriage oh come on i feel led to speak this out saints if you want to make love to me you'll do this and this or give this and this you can recognize where that spirit come from but we can't be over here in love with the world and tell the lord jesus christ we love him and not have prostitute spirit that's right he that loves the world the things of the lord the love of god's not even in him the seed of god can't be in him the same time the love of god the love of the world is in there so they've got to be completely completely separated you can say well you know what i i do this but i've got the holy ghost you're lying amen i know that's a little blunt but you're lying amen amen yeah now okay i'm trying to be polite tonight the seed of god can't be him same time love of god the world's in there when the seed of god is operating through you that's the word of god oh i've got the holy ghost and well i'm irish or i'm this or i just simply have a temper actually we often times well look look at you know cain's altar was so much more beautiful than abel's and it was rejected but i'm here to tell you tonight the end doesn't matter what it is but this is right here look at the date on that if it means anything to you this is his closing word to the bride of christ in our day he's not mincing any words he's not patty caking this thing telling him now if i soft soap this they'll all remember me i don't know if he knew he was going or not but he started to speak of it he started laying that out a little bit when i'm gone and it'll be soon and this then that and you know it was there see neither can you bear god's sons of his word now this is why i made that comment earlier my brother and sister about producing the seed word neither can you bear god's sons of his word to this illegitimate denominational group you cannot do it in your incubator you cannot bring forth a word son of god oh thank you lord that he's put us out here and he has started putting us together he didn't incubate us in the fashion that the denomination did he incubated you my brother and sister and i mostly by experience now i want to know do you want to trade experience for intellectual intellectual would have been much easier is much easier come on come on you guys if you don't like to have patience and you don't like the scars and the scratches let's go for the intellectual it just means we take a book and we find out what it's all about god said no i'm not going to give it to you through a book unless it's the bible amen but you know what i'm saying i'm going to give it to you through a book he's going to give it to you by experience and when the devil comes and says you're following a lie you don't go back to the book to figure out if it's true or not you go back to your experience and my experiences says god's word is true and this word this message is true and the life that god is bringing me to live is true and i can count on that amen can you say i can count on that hallelujah hallelujah you still claim to be very religious so is cain the prostitute eve son very religious built offered offered sacrifice paid his tithes and done everything that any other religious man would do but he failed to keep that word he failed to have that rev the revelation and the revelation is the only thing what amen amen the revelation is the only thing wait just a second i've listened to every recorded message i've read every message book not only that i went and i learned greek and hebrew and aramaic come on i think we can say today i'll take experience every time every time the word being opened and made alive i'll take that hallelujah amen but he failed to keep that word he failed to have revelation and revelation is the only thing the revelation of the word that's christ himself what is the what is a revelation jesus said upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell will not tear down the pillar in my temple hallelujah the gates of hell can't prevail against it faith is a revelation because faith has been oh look i'm trying to bring this right back to the beginning and faith oh hallelujah has been revealed to you it's no longer my pastor said oh pardon me i don't mean this wrong but it's no longer what the prophet said i have faith in the word which is christ himself amen oh and by the way that's what the prophet said it wasn't my idea it wasn't my revelation it was a prophet's word so he stands right upon it amen the prophet of god come back and stood right here in this day right now he could say no other than the word he's already preached if our lord jesus was to come back and stand in the flesh in this hour he could say no other than what he has already said sister emmy would you come hallelujah now we're going to close out with john 4 amen but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh you to worship him hallelujah not just some in person any old person out here he seeketh such to worship him and god is a spirit amen that's right let's go right back i'm not going to go back but not just stir your mind to go back to our scripture amen a man be joined to a harlot or a man be joined to the word one produces carnal one is spirit and here we are it takes you right back to god you're right there in the spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth you see this other worship my brother and sister of this prostitute spirit of the day they worship beautifully they worship beautifully they they write songs that you're just like i love that song but you understand they've been joined back to a jezebel spirit and so all of that worship is not even recognized of god can we put it this way like maybe you you know you have certain music and maybe you can find it in a in a uh where they call it you know where you can gather all your songs together what would that what do they call that you have a i don't know it's like a file but well no like a playlist [Music] yeah so you know like youtube or something like that you could go on there and say i i love this song and put it in there you love this song and then you can loop that thing and you can literally have your computer playing this music that you enjoy and that stirs your heart all day long you don't have to go in there and keep clicking on the songs right so here it is playing not off youtube from the voices of the people and words of songs will say and god hears my voice as it echoes through the heavens [Music] coupled to a harlot spirit god doesn't hear that voice at all it's just here what was it the beauty of cain's altar he said god catch this brother branham speaks of this god must accept my offering god had to do no such thing and he comes back to cain and says you know what if you adjust you would be acceptable and the anger of cain was kindle my brother and sister i'm going to use one last example analogy to you as i close the earthquake sister jerry help me what was that early earthquake in chile 40s 60. great earthwork shook things to the ground the churches filled up people in the streets and in the parks on their knees crying out to god and i won't name all the dates because they're slipping my mind but i'm telling you my brother and sister when sister jerry and i left chile here a few years ago we had no more than arrived back in the united states and they had a great earthquake down there and the transition of the people at every disaster that had come the reaction of the people had changed until in 2010 great tsunami swept the cities and there's miracles that god did concerning believers waking them up in the middle of the night and placing on a brother's heart get your wife and your babies up and run up the mountain and they're like why why i said i don't know but god's speaking to me and he got his wife and his babies and they ran up the mountain and where that house that they were in no longer existed not even a brick upon a brick don't tell me god's not here do you know what happened in 2010 of that great earthquake and tsunami they stood in the streets and cursed god when the tribulation comes saints [Music] these joined to the harlot we're going to stand in the streets [Music] and curse god [Music] the word says if you wouldn't cry out paraphrasing this if you wouldn't cry out then i'll cause the rocks and the mountains to cry look what's happening our moment of truth of our generation of our time we are pillar in the temple of our god we get to praise him we get to give worship to him we get to be his witness young man in a parking lot a fertilizer salesman in an office a neighbor it doesn't matter we're not looking for rich or poor for famous or unknowns or whatever we just want to be what god called this to be hallelujah you love the lord amen so it's there you know as we look at these things amen i'll just cut it off right there i believe if i didn't get the point to you by now i won't ever get it to you amen but jesus said in verse 26 he saith unto her i that speak unto thee am he and i say tonight he he saints he is here and he's speaking his word is speaking god help us to listen god help us to listen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah let our bodies be a temple amen let's just go on hallelujah amen let's just stand up sing a few songs of worship to the lord tonight amen you know hallelujah i was just telling i was just telling brother jay i'm going to work towards just not being over nine o'clock i was doing really good but that last four minutes i blew it [Music] but i tell you what my brother and sister i'm so glad god is molding me forming me molding you forming you into a pillar stalwart unmovable faithful hard working brother paul what do you mean by hard working you'll read your bible you pray whether you feel like it or not you'll dig into the word of god and when your flesh says i can't make it the spirit will rise up and say you're more than able amen amen hard oh hallelujah know ye not no ye not you are a temple hallelujah oh no yina no you not here or a [Music] temple oh i love this next verse look at this oh yes i know yes i know i am

the ages to realize that if god wrote another book of acts saints your name would be there you'd be part of that amen if there was ever an extension or addendum to hebrews 11 you would be there amongst the heroes of faith hallelujah i look back on history and see the mining gone unveil proving over and over that is but i can't keep on dwelling on some past memory cause he's the same god who's living in me yes the same god who spoke to the woman at the well he's the same god who's wondering to tell the same god [Music] he's the same god there's living in me [Music] the same god who created all the heavens and all the earth came back living in jesus and there's power in his word but now when these last days i'm beginning to see that it's the same god who's living in me oh the same god who spoke to the woman at the well he's the same god whose wonders the many [Music] he's the same god who's living in me hallelujah hallelujah saints amen the same god who spoke to the bride in laodicea the same god whose wonders are too great to tell hallelujah put that up brother mason hallelujah the same god amen who parted your raging sea hallelujah when you said this is impossible god said i'll make it impossible and i'll prove to you that my word is just as true on this side as it is on thy side my words just as true this evening as it was with every prophet of every age oh that ought to get somebody excited to be able to say this is the same god who's living in me hallelujah look i know sometimes these things seem biting but my brother and sister we don't want to be caught saying well look what god did back here look what god did back here look what god did back here look what god did in 1965 i want you to say look what god did in 2022 i want you to see what god did in my house and my life in my family hallelujah oh before i get excited oh hallelujah well i just prayed tonight that there was something that you got out of this because you know i preached it a lot better to myself today amen it flowed and it had points that i stomped my feet and i shouted waved my arms and i didn't probably do near as good a job tonight but let god come down and anoint this my brother and sister i am an overcomer can you say that with me tonight i am an overcomer and to the overcomers i will make them a pillar in my temple oh just thank the lord tonight on your way home before you lay your head on the pillow just stop and say thank you lord that you're making us a pillar in your tabernacle in your temple hallelujah god bless you let's be praying amen for our brother abel amen uh i love brother abel's preaching he just has a very unique way of bringing the word out to amen and and you know i'm i'm just gonna stay right here right now maybe you'll say it with me i
