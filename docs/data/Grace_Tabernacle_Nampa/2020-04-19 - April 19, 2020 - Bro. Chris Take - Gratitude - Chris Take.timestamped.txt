[44:10] spire heads only father Lord Jesus we so
[44:14] grateful this morning father to common
[44:17] and hear from You Lord Jesus and father
[44:20] I ask that you would just meet each
[44:22] heart Lord father you know the needs and
[44:25] in the midst oh Jesus different I
[44:27] request this morning father you can let
[44:30] me speak life into those situations
[44:32] father father we ask that you just come
[44:36] Lord take these words father you've laid
[44:39] on my heart Lord Jesus and tie them up
[44:42] in me with your words or Jesus father
[44:44] there would not be my own Lord that I
[44:46] would move out of the way father the
[44:49] Lord we would go away this morning
[44:50] saying that we had the opportunity to
[44:52] hear from you Lord Jesus and follow you
[44:55] pray your blessings upon the word Lord
[44:57] and all these things we ask it in your
[45:00] perfect will on Jesus Christ's name we
[45:01] pray amen you can be seated amen
[45:10] you know as I was studying along I came
[45:15] across across this quote it doesn't go
[45:19] exactly with what we have but I thought
[45:22] I'd just kind of say this and then we
[45:24] can get into the sermon this morning but
[45:26] the Brenham says in here ye him 1956 he
[45:28] says our characters should have us up
[45:31] into a place where we can be in an
[45:34] office to meet the crisis of this hour
[45:36] that we're in what a shame we are but
[45:39] will God answer in a time of crisis he
[45:41] will not only answer but he will make
[45:42] manifest in the time of crisis if the
[45:45] people are simple together in a matter
[45:47] of two or three whatever it is and pray
[45:49] there he said he would
[45:50] from heaven amen I believe this fits our
[45:53] situation were gathered together in in
[45:56] pieces and in small units but still were
[46:00] gathered together underneath his name
[46:02] all in one Accord and God can come down
[46:05] and speak to you man it's my first
[46:09] chance to minister since we've been
[46:10] quarantined and it can be hard to stay
[46:14] focused at home when you're streaming
[46:16] but God is gracious and if you ask him
[46:20] to help if you ask him to assist you aim
[46:23] and he can do it and he can give you the
[46:25] grace to have church in at home just you
[46:31] know the Lord has always come down no
[46:34] matter you know maybe the beginning you
[46:36] know then things get settled and God's
[46:38] always coming and spoken to us and so
[46:40] we've been thankful for that our pastor
[46:43] was preaching here a couple weeks ago
[46:44] and I I had they would do a little run
[46:46] around the living room to get it out and
[46:49] then it startled my wife and the kids
[46:50] and I said I'm sorry I just had to get
[46:52] it out of me so not here to boast of
[46:55] myself but to testify that doesn't
[46:56] matter where you are God can meet you
[46:57] there praise the Lord so this morning
[47:00] we're going to be speaking on gratitude
[47:02] and being thankful he meant so my title
[47:05] this morning is gratitude
[47:08] amen and the Bible says that and the
[47:13] scriptures that we read here I was gloss
[47:15] back over them it says in Colossians 2 7
[47:19] it says again rooted and built up in him
[47:21] and established in faith as you have
[47:22] been taught abounding therein with
[47:24] Thanksgiving I mean I looked up the word
[47:28] rooted in the scripture it only appears
[47:31] a few times most of it in the context of
[47:34] rooting out the devil but there was a
[47:37] few places where it says we're rooted in
[47:39] Christ and the Paul says here that we
[47:42] want to be rooted and built up in Christ
[47:44] and established in the faith as you've
[47:49] been taught but doing all that and
[47:51] abounding in Thanksgiving and I think
[47:54] this morning we we want to say sometimes
[47:56] we become too much to a place where
[47:59] always say we ask and and and we request
[48:03] in me and me
[48:04] I mean we always say is I I need I need
[48:06] I need I need I need when we pray and we
[48:09] forget sometimes to just spend some time
[48:12] saying thank you Lord and a Harvard
[48:16] Medical School that their paper and they
[48:19] Reese on research of gratitude they took
[48:21] a few different researches and put them
[48:24] together and they said to psychologists
[48:27] this is a just a couple of paragraphs so
[48:29] bear with me - psychologist dr. Robert a
[48:31] Eamon's of the University of California
[48:34] Davis and dr. Michael e McCool Oh of the
[48:38] University of Miami have done much of
[48:40] the research on gratitude in one study
[48:42] they asked all participants to write a
[48:45] few sentences each week focusing on
[48:47] particular topics one group wrote about
[48:49] things they were grateful for that had
[48:51] occurred during the week a second group
[48:53] wrote about daily irritations or things
[48:55] that had displeased them and the third
[48:57] wrote about events that had affected
[48:59] them with no emphasis on them being
[49:00] positive or negative for 10 weeks those
[49:03] who wrote about gratitude were more
[49:05] optimistic and felt better about their
[49:06] lives surprisingly they also exercised
[49:09] more and had fewer visits to physicians
[49:11] than those who focused on sources of
[49:13] aggravation another leading researcher
[49:16] in this field dr. Martin EP Seligman a
[49:20] psychologist at the University of
[49:21] Pennsylvania tested the impact of
[49:23] various positive psychology
[49:25] interventions on 411 people each
[49:28] compared with the control assignment of
[49:30] writing about early memories so they had
[49:32] to write about four and eleven people
[49:34] write about early memories when their
[49:36] week's assignments was to write and
[49:38] personally deliver a letter of gratitude
[49:40] to someone who never been properly
[49:42] thanked for his or her kindness
[49:44] participants immediately exhibited a
[49:46] huge increase in happiness scores this
[49:49] impact was greater than that from any
[49:51] other intervention with with benefits
[49:53] lasting for a month so that being said
[49:56] grads U has benefits on the natural side
[49:59] they could write those papers off in the
[50:01] planar English but I just wanted to
[50:06] bring that in that and it's been studies
[50:08] have shown that being thankful and
[50:10] having gratitude actually increases your
[50:12] overall health and in natural always
[50:16] types of spiritual and vice-versa
[50:18] and so we know that in our spiritual
[50:20] health amen we could be thankful we can
[50:23] show gratitude amen our spiritual health
[50:25] will begin to increase and we'll be in a
[50:28] better state of mind amen in Philippians
[50:31] of 4 verse 6 you can you can jump there
[50:34] if you want says be careful for nothing
[50:44] but in everything by prayer and
[50:46] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[50:48] requests be made known unto God amen so
[50:52] you have your quests and you have needs
[50:54] you you give up to God but when you do
[50:56] that you do it with Thanksgiving you do
[50:59] it with the thankful heart and praise
[51:03] the Lord amen
[51:07] and there was one part here in this in
[51:13] this paper I read that it's that one
[51:15] group you know hey write down what
[51:18] aggravates you and write down what what
[51:20] negative things you think of and
[51:22] sometimes when we go to prayer may go to
[51:24] speak to the Lord we go and we say you
[51:27] know this is bothering me and that's
[51:28] bothering me and I'm tired of this and
[51:30] can we change this and can this be
[51:32] fixing what we're doing is and we read
[51:35] here in the in Philippians 4:6 so
[51:37] there's a balance in making your request
[51:38] but what we can find ourselves doing
[51:40] sometimes it's just focusing on what's
[51:43] wrong focusing on what's aggravating us
[51:46] focus on what's wrong with the world and
[51:48] we lose our focus even in prayer we lose
[51:51] our focus or what it should be that is
[51:53] on that Christ is the waymaker and that
[51:55] Christ can move on these things and so
[51:58] we begin to chain we can begin to change
[52:00] the way we pray for something and so
[52:02] maybe we have a need in our lives and of
[52:06] healing in our body and instead of
[52:09] saying instead of praying over and over
[52:10] and over again Lord heal me Lord heal me
[52:12] start saying Lord thank you for healing
[52:14] me Lord by I hurt myself today
[52:16] thank you for healing me Lord I have
[52:19] this this job interview thank you for
[52:21] being with me thank you for giving me
[52:23] the right words to say because we have
[52:25] the ability to speak things into
[52:28] existence underneath underneath the
[52:30] anointing of Christ and so we
[52:32] say you know brother man said if you
[52:33] have a need of a healing in your body
[52:35] he says begin to testify and begin to
[52:37] confess that healing he said and imagine
[52:40] that body in front of you and stepped
[52:42] step into that perfect body but if all
[52:46] you do is say you know think about the
[52:48] sick body and not think about the
[52:50] healing body all you're gonna do is
[52:51] bring yourself down so we don't want to
[52:55] get caught up and when and I need this
[52:57] and I need that we want to pray with
[52:59] gratitude amen 1st Thessalonians 5 verse
[53:03] 16 says rejoice evermore pray without
[53:06] ceasing and everything give thanks for
[53:09] this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
[53:11] concerning you you say Chris or the
[53:14] Chris what is the will of God for my
[53:16] life be thankful you always have
[53:19] something to be thankful and that's
[53:21] easier to say when everything is going
[53:23] well but it's the truth even in the
[53:25] darkest times you always have something
[53:27] to be thankful for you can always find
[53:29] gratitude around you and when you begin
[53:32] to pray in this way and there was a
[53:34] there was a great man of God and I can't
[53:37] remember his name right now it slips him
[53:38] but he had an orphanage in in England
[53:41] and he never once asked for donations he
[53:45] never once asked for food but God he
[53:47] always prayed they would sit down to a
[53:50] meal and he would say thank you Lord for
[53:52] the bread and the milk for breakfast
[53:54] there'd be a knock on the door and the
[53:56] milkman was there and he said hey my car
[53:58] broke down I have all this milk I can't
[54:00] do anything with do you want it sure
[54:02] we'll take it so they're going to sit
[54:03] down and a few minutes later there's
[54:06] another knock on the door and it's the
[54:07] bread man and he says I have all these
[54:09] extra loaves of bread and they're gonna
[54:11] go bad would you like them and so God
[54:13] provided an end up I wish I would have
[54:15] taken the time to pull down the
[54:17] statistics but um he said he would
[54:21] record every prayer he prayed on one
[54:23] side of the page he would write the what
[54:25] he prayed for on the other side the page
[54:27] he would write down when it was answered
[54:28] and he had over like a million recorded
[54:30] answered prayers or something like it
[54:33] was a big number and he said they asked
[54:36] him you know say well what what about
[54:38] how do you pray you know how's a what's
[54:41] your recommendations on how to pray
[54:42] better and he said
[54:45] or maybe he was just commenting about
[54:47] him how he prays but he said he takes
[54:49] this portion of Scripture and against
[54:51] the to pray about that say Lord I read
[54:54] here in your word that you in
[54:56] Philippians 34:13 assist I can do all
[54:58] things through Christ who strengthens me
[55:00] and I know God that you are the creator
[55:03] of all things and you created me and you
[55:05] created the world around me and you knew
[55:07] before the foundation of the world he
[55:08] said you begin to express what God is
[55:11] capable of he says you'll find yourself
[55:13] on your knees for a lot longer he says
[55:16] you've because what happens and what
[55:18] what happens when you do that is you
[55:20] begin to express now worship we have a
[55:24] misunderstanding of prayer and that is
[55:27] that no prayer is to ask God for things
[55:29] but you can pray and never once asked
[55:31] God for things and you can just pray and
[55:34] worship and you say you began you do
[55:36] just as he said you know I can do all
[55:37] things through Christ who strengthens me
[55:39] and as you worship God you're praying to
[55:42] God you're worshipping what are you
[55:43] doing you're expressing gratitude to
[55:46] your Creator and as you express that
[55:49] gratitude you get up and you don't have
[55:51] to pray for your depression you don't
[55:52] have to pray for your and anxiety you
[55:54] have to pray for a peace because in that
[55:56] moment Amen you found freedom from those
[55:59] things and you step up a happier person
[56:02] you step up with a victory over
[56:04] depression you've stacked up step up
[56:06] with peace in your heart over anxiety
[56:08] because why you express gratitude for
[56:11] Christ and when you express gratitude
[56:13] and you praise him my Paul and Silas did
[56:15] in the jail you begin to worship Him and
[56:18] when you begin to worship Him what
[56:20] happens in Christ comes near God comes
[56:23] near because you're worshiping and
[56:24] you're talking about him and he loves to
[56:26] come around you when you're talking
[56:28] about him and so then he comes near and
[56:30] what happens where the weather does the
[56:31] Bible says where the Spirit of the Lord
[56:33] is there is Liberty and so as you
[56:35] express your gratitude toward Christ as
[56:38] you worship him as you bee step into his
[56:41] presence and now guess what you have the
[56:43] ability to have freedom and it doesn't
[56:46] matter freedom they said the Bible says
[56:48] does not the Bible doesn't say you will
[56:50] have in the spirit where the Spirit of
[56:52] the Lord is there's Liberty from
[56:53] sickness no it says there is Liberty it
[56:57] doesn't matter what it is
[56:59] amen God can give you freedom from the
[57:01] simplest of things it could be it could
[57:03] be a stressful day and you just step
[57:06] aside except in the corner say and you
[57:08] begin to say instead of say God I'm
[57:10] stressed out help me not to be stressed
[57:12] you say God you're great and psalms it
[57:17] says it says they that I walk through
[57:19] the valley of the shadow of death I will
[57:21] fear no evil Lord you're always with us
[57:23] and Lord your word says that in the same
[57:26] in the same chapter you know I lay me
[57:28] down by her besides he really leadeth me
[57:31] in paths of righteousness for his name's
[57:34] sake and it talks about the being beside
[57:36] the still waters and and for me I've
[57:39] always been a big reader and there's
[57:41] been times where or in my imagination
[57:43] you can just really picture things it
[57:45] really helped when I was in construction
[57:46] I could just envision every step of the
[57:48] process and so with reading I just I
[57:52] just see everything that I read there's
[57:54] been times as that when I've been
[57:55] reading a book and I've been like tired
[57:57] I'm just gonna set this down and when I
[57:59] set the book down I expect what I'm
[58:01] seeing in my head to continue and then I
[58:02] realize now I have to keep reading to
[58:04] keep seeing seeing it what I'm visiting
[58:07] and so when I read Psalm 23 I just see
[58:09] this is the beautiful lush green meadow
[58:13] and the nice still moving water the
[58:17] water can't be moving too fast or sheeps
[58:19] are will scare away and they won't get
[58:20] any water so it has to be still and so
[58:23] you just see this this this picture of
[58:25] serenity this picture of peace and and
[58:28] you begin to express you know to God hey
[58:30] you know I your word says you give us
[58:34] you give us peace and Lord I know that
[58:35] you are peace and I live with lit live
[58:38] into your presence and and then you
[58:40] begin to just worship God and next thing
[58:42] you know you're not stressed anymore and
[58:43] you're happy about it and you're in your
[58:45] things are going along well again
[58:48] amen for his Lord and that scripture is
[58:57] in 2nd Corinthians 3:17 now the Lord is
[58:59] that spirit and where the Spirit of the
[59:02] Lord is there is Liberty amen
[59:05] and it pleases the Lord when we testify
[59:08] of his goodness because when you when
[59:11] you when you um
[59:12] witnessing to something to somebody
[59:14] brother Branham says you know tell them
[59:16] how your candle got lit and there's many
[59:19] different reasons for that but when when
[59:21] you're testifying to somebody and you're
[59:23] witnessing to somebody and you're just
[59:26] spewing doctrine or spilling your ideas
[59:30] you sound no different than anybody else
[59:33] but when you tell your testimony you're
[59:37] testifying of God's goodness gratitude
[59:41] worship what happens God's Spirit comes
[59:44] down and that anointing is what affects
[59:47] that individual that you're witnessing
[59:48] to so when you go up and use you can
[59:51] tell them about you know the seals and
[59:53] everything and you can blow their minds
[59:54] and and but when you testify you're
[59:57] testifying of Christ and God loves to be
[59:59] talked about so he comes near amen and
[1:00:01] his presence comes down and that's
[1:00:03] either gonna open that person you're
[1:00:05] witnessing to up or they're gonna say
[1:00:07] hey I'm good thanks I'll walk away and
[1:00:10] walk away and go about their day but if
[1:00:13] you don't have that anointing and then
[1:00:15] all you end up doing is debating with
[1:00:16] them but the Lord loves when we testify
[1:00:20] of his goodness and I think this this is
[1:00:23] just right on time for where we live
[1:00:24] right now because we can get so caught
[1:00:25] up with with reading the news and
[1:00:27] reading about the cove in 19 and reading
[1:00:30] about how the world is is falling apart
[1:00:31] and the economy this and and then Trump
[1:00:34] said that and but the the but Nancy
[1:00:37] Pelosi said this and and you know
[1:00:39] Facebook said this and and then you know
[1:00:41] this news article said this and CNN said
[1:00:43] no it's like this and Fox said no it's
[1:00:45] like this and you can just get caught in
[1:00:46] the middle and get so stressed out and
[1:00:49] then then all you thinking about that
[1:00:51] stuff and so it's important and this is
[1:00:55] proven that in in crisis you just so
[1:00:59] tore up but if you just begin to be
[1:01:01] grateful for anything you'll find
[1:01:04] yourself feeling better get out of
[1:01:07] theirs to get outside say you know I'm
[1:01:09] grateful for the sunshine I'm grateful
[1:01:11] you know thank you Lord for the trees
[1:01:13] and the leaves and and the green grass
[1:01:15] so I can say now because I live here
[1:01:18] I've been really enjoying the green
[1:01:21] grass
[1:01:23] excuse me hand uh and and you'll find
[1:01:27] you'll have victory over those negative
[1:01:30] thoughts because because what what
[1:01:34] happened believed us and this is this is
[1:01:37] true for it for everyone but the way you
[1:01:40] think your thought pattern can determine
[1:01:44] your attitude and your attitude can
[1:01:47] actually make you physically ill now if
[1:01:52] your thoughts are all about the world's
[1:01:57] coming to an end now and we want that to
[1:02:00] happen but in a negative way you're not
[1:02:04] you're not thinking the world's coming
[1:02:05] to in and a happy way you're thinking
[1:02:07] the world's ending in a bad way and the
[1:02:09] thoughts are on the chaos now your
[1:02:12] attitude that's what you're thinking
[1:02:14] about your attitude begins to express
[1:02:16] that you're you you're irritable you're
[1:02:19] easily frustrated I guess those are the
[1:02:21] same things you're paranoid right now
[1:02:24] what begins to develop in your spiritual
[1:02:27] ease anxiety you're anxious and you're
[1:02:30] nervous now
[1:02:32] those are proven to cause stomach ulcers
[1:02:34] those are proven to cause other
[1:02:36] sicknesses as well heart diseases and
[1:02:38] everything there brother Manuel Salazar
[1:02:44] he passes a church in New Mexico he
[1:02:47] preached his sermon about that one time
[1:02:48] and he brought out all the the research
[1:02:50] and it was it was probably phenomenal
[1:02:51] that stress is directly related to
[1:02:54] causing stomach ulcers which is kind of
[1:02:55] a well-known one but there's it could
[1:02:57] actually cause heart diseases and then
[1:03:00] what does that what does that do that
[1:03:02] causes you know now there's a division
[1:03:05] sure you're not smoking cigarettes
[1:03:07] you're not sinning but now there's a
[1:03:08] division because between you and God
[1:03:11] because now all you can do is worry
[1:03:12] about what's going on around you and now
[1:03:16] when you go to pray all you can you
[1:03:18] close your eyes in me you make
[1:03:19] everything still around you you find a
[1:03:21] nice quiet place to pray now all you can
[1:03:22] think of is is the crisis around you and
[1:03:26] it's causing division in your prayer
[1:03:28] which is causing division in your
[1:03:29] relationship with Christ but I'm here to
[1:03:32] tell you this morning that there's an
[1:03:33] easy way out of that
[1:03:35] just start to say thank you Lord listen
[1:03:39] I wrote this down if there's if there's
[1:03:41] nothing you can find around you to be
[1:03:43] thankful for which is really hard
[1:03:46] there's nothing you can find thankful
[1:03:48] around you you can be thankful you're
[1:03:50] saved no matter what you're going
[1:03:53] through there's always one thing you can
[1:03:55] be thankful for there's nothing else
[1:03:56] give me thankful that God has called you
[1:03:59] his own and just begin to think upon
[1:04:01] that the Bible says in that's in
[1:04:03] Philippians here actually I think praise
[1:04:08] the Lord I'm sitting in it some of you
[1:04:11] can quote it but so what so ever you
[1:04:15] know what think on these things that's
[1:04:18] Scripture somebody know where it is
[1:04:20] anyways but Paul says Paul says you know
[1:04:23] think about think about um all right
[1:04:26] here
[1:04:27] yeah chapter four verse Philippians 4
[1:04:29] verse 8 finally brethren whatsoever
[1:04:30] things are true whatsoever things are
[1:04:33] honest I'm gonna tell you here this
[1:04:35] morning
[1:04:36] half 80% of the what the media tells you
[1:04:38] an even Fox is false so what sort of
[1:04:42] things are true think on these things
[1:04:44] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[1:04:46] things are just whatsoever things are
[1:04:49] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[1:04:50] whatsoever things are of a good report
[1:04:53] if there be any virtue and if there be
[1:04:55] any praise think on these things and I
[1:04:59] believe Paul here was speaking from
[1:05:00] experience you know maybe he had just
[1:05:03] wrote to the Philippians after you know
[1:05:05] being released from prison with Paul in
[1:05:07] sight with with Silas and he says hey
[1:05:09] this stuff works man
[1:05:11] it's I've tried it it does wonders but
[1:05:19] when you begin to think on these things
[1:05:20] your thoughts are so powerful your
[1:05:24] thoughts are so powerful because they
[1:05:25] set a pattern for your attitude and
[1:05:28] there's an old eight an age-old saying
[1:05:31] that says you cannot change the
[1:05:32] circumstances around you but you can't
[1:05:35] or you can't tailor-make your situations
[1:05:36] around you but you can tailor make your
[1:05:38] attitude toward those situations and
[1:05:40] brother Branham says the right attitude
[1:05:42] towards any promise of God brings that
[1:05:44] promise to pass and so you have
[1:05:46] something in your life that you need
[1:05:48] that
[1:05:48] you need met don't sit there and read
[1:05:49] the doctors reports instead begin to
[1:05:52] think upon the goodness of God begin to
[1:05:54] think upon what God can do and how God
[1:05:56] can heal you and those thoughts will
[1:05:57] begin to create a positive effect
[1:05:59] physically on your body amen if we can
[1:06:03] look out and we can see that the crazy
[1:06:05] view of this world expressing what's
[1:06:07] inside of them physically and you can
[1:06:09] sigit the believers around you that are
[1:06:11] expressing what's inside them physically
[1:06:13] through dressing pure and and speak
[1:06:16] speaking pure and acting pure amen you
[1:06:20] could have the same effect on your body
[1:06:22] if you could just begin to think about
[1:06:23] and focus on the promises of God for
[1:06:26] your life
[1:06:27] brother Branham tells a little story
[1:06:30] here in 1955 the water of separation
[1:06:32] it's kind of a lengthy quote but it's
[1:06:34] one of those ones you just can't cut it
[1:06:36] up or excuse me not cut it out
[1:06:39] split it apart we don't cut it up and
[1:06:42] patch our own in ok anyways he says it
[1:06:46] old not long ago doubt in the
[1:06:48] South before the proclamation was signed
[1:06:50] for the independence or the freedom of
[1:06:51] the slaves one lap there was a little
[1:06:52] old place where he was playing the organ
[1:06:54] and having a glorious time in the
[1:06:56] service where they met together to
[1:07:00] worship the Lord excuse me
[1:07:03] while he was in worship the Lord saved
[1:07:05] him hey there you go well he was in
[1:07:08] worship the Lord saved him and the next
[1:07:11] day back on the old plantation he was
[1:07:13] telling all the slaves that morning when
[1:07:14] they gathered out about Christ had set
[1:07:16] him free so what happened to be that the
[1:07:18] owner of these slaves come by after they
[1:07:20] come up from their cabin to get ready to
[1:07:22] go to work he said Sam what was that I
[1:07:24] heard you saying to those fellows when I
[1:07:26] come up that she was free he said yes
[1:07:28] sir boss he said the Lord Jesus has made
[1:07:30] me free said why don't you come over to
[1:07:32] my office after a while so he went over
[1:07:34] to the office and he said alright boss
[1:07:35] he said repeat that again he said well
[1:07:38] he said last night in a meeting the Lord
[1:07:40] Jesus made me free from the bondage of
[1:07:41] sin and and said he's cut me free and
[1:07:44] I'm free now I don't have to sin no more
[1:07:47] because the Lord Jesus forgive me and
[1:07:49] set me free
[1:07:49] he said Sam if you really mean that with
[1:07:52] all your hearts that I'll go down today
[1:07:53] and sign the proclamation that you were
[1:07:55] free from me to to go preach the gospel
[1:07:58] to your people so he said well boss I
[1:08:00] mean it with all my heart
[1:08:02] that he set me free from the bondage of
[1:08:04] sin he said well I set you free as a
[1:08:07] slave to preach the gospel to your
[1:08:08] brethren Amen God loves to hear you
[1:08:11] testify of him and here is this man
[1:08:14] testifying of what God had done for him
[1:08:16] and God went ahead and pricked the ear
[1:08:18] of his slave owner of the of the Mane's
[1:08:23] of the man's boss pricked his ear and he
[1:08:25] says hey what was that you were saying
[1:08:27] and if the man had never been testifying
[1:08:29] of his freedom spiritually God would
[1:08:32] have never give him him for this him
[1:08:34] that in that moment his freedom
[1:08:35] physically and when you begin to testify
[1:08:38] of God testify that your freedom
[1:08:40] spiritually amen that freedom that
[1:08:42] testifying garb against us says to set
[1:08:45] your physical party free free from
[1:08:47] sickness free from anxiety free from
[1:08:50] depression free from nervousness free
[1:08:52] from complexes free from from pride Amen
[1:08:56] and all these things God begins to do
[1:08:58] because why he says hey man I love
[1:09:00] hearing him testify I'm gonna go ahead
[1:09:02] and give him freedom on the outside and
[1:09:05] then I hope to what happens when God is
[1:09:07] an inward work in your life amen you
[1:09:10] start to testify about it your body
[1:09:12] obeys that confession next thing you
[1:09:14] know you've dropped the cigarettes
[1:09:17] excuse me you've dropped the cussing and
[1:09:19] you've dropped the hanging out with the
[1:09:21] bad people why because your body came
[1:09:22] under composition to your confession
[1:09:26] amen praise the Lord in Acts chapter 16
[1:09:30] verse 25 excuse me I'm having a hard
[1:09:33] time with my throat
[1:09:39] chapter 16 verse 25 says and at midnight
[1:09:42] Paul and Silas prayed and sing praises
[1:09:45] unto God and the prisoners heard him as
[1:09:47] suddenly there was a great earthquake so
[1:09:49] that the foundation of the prison were
[1:09:51] shaken and immediately all the doors
[1:09:58] were open and everyone's bands were
[1:10:00] loosed so here's Paul and Silas there
[1:10:02] was this woman following them that was
[1:10:05] you know saying hey these are these are
[1:10:06] men of God these are men of God and they
[1:10:08] turned around and Paul said I rebuke you
[1:10:09] devil come out of her and that girl was
[1:10:13] set free from this demon and her owner
[1:10:15] who was making money off of her grabs
[1:10:17] Paul this Allison and says hey everybody
[1:10:20] you know and they get a riot going and
[1:10:22] throwed Paul Silas in prison and a
[1:10:24] parlous in Silas and then they've been
[1:10:25] beat up now they're chained to all have
[1:10:27] you ever been chained to a wall I can
[1:10:30] guarantee you can bet money on it you'll
[1:10:33] be chained to a wall and so here they're
[1:10:36] chained physically change to a wall some
[1:10:39] of you may have been beat up so I won't
[1:10:41] go there but here they are that you
[1:10:45] would say you say what in the world do
[1:10:47] Paul and Silas have to be thankful for
[1:10:51] you say brother Chris you're adding to
[1:10:53] the word the board doesn't say they were
[1:10:54] thankful you have to be thankful to
[1:10:57] start to praise God you can't be
[1:10:59] thankful and you can't there's no way
[1:11:01] you can you can sing a song but that is
[1:11:03] not praise praise is when you are
[1:11:07] thankful that God does it's done
[1:11:09] something for let's do you say well well
[1:11:11] pastor I sing every morning I've seen I
[1:11:13] sing every Sunday morning and Wednesday
[1:11:14] what more do you want from me we don't
[1:11:17] want you to sing we want you to praise
[1:11:19] we want you to worship God there's a big
[1:11:21] difference in the scriptures and so
[1:11:23] here's Paul and Silas and they're
[1:11:24] they're sitting there and I would love
[1:11:26] to see cuz you and let me tell you
[1:11:27] something right here I'm gonna speak
[1:11:29] some blasphemy these two guys were men
[1:11:31] just like you and me when they first
[1:11:33] were in there I'm gonna go and take a
[1:11:35] Liberty they were not happy have you
[1:11:39] ever been punched in the face and been
[1:11:41] happy about it I haven't I've been
[1:11:45] kicked in the face I've never been
[1:11:47] punched in the face but I wasn't happy
[1:11:50] about it I chipped a tooth
[1:11:53] but here's Paul and Silas they're
[1:11:56] sitting there and they're probably work
[1:11:57] you know they had like brother Jewell
[1:11:59] says there was he was he was said and
[1:12:00] they were like my goodness Paul Silas
[1:12:03] cuz Paul had selected Silas to come with
[1:12:06] him Sciences like Paul what have you got
[1:12:08] me into says no but I signed up for
[1:12:11] maybe they were complaining we don't
[1:12:13] know what we're gonna say they were and
[1:12:14] and something one of them they know
[1:12:16] maybe because you kind of rant for a
[1:12:18] little bit and the conversation kind of
[1:12:19] dies off right and just sit there and
[1:12:20] they were sitting there quietly Paul
[1:12:23] says you know what we could be then we
[1:12:30] maybe we couldn't no we could be sitting
[1:12:33] you're not annoying Christ we could
[1:12:34] actually be prisoners for a crime and
[1:12:37] said we're we're prisoners for Christ
[1:12:40] and that's involved is that yes a good
[1:12:42] message ship write that one down for
[1:12:44] later um cuz Paul preached about being a
[1:12:47] prisoner for cookies
[1:12:49] anyways and that's always say you know
[1:12:51] it so they started maybe they started
[1:12:53] with their salvation so yeah you know
[1:12:54] oh we were saved Wow praise God
[1:12:59] you know man remember when we were Jews
[1:13:01] and we didn't we got no idea what any of
[1:13:03] this was and and we had the the Torah
[1:13:05] and and you know we were we were looking
[1:13:07] for a messiah but but he had already
[1:13:09] come and gone and and Paul man you used
[1:13:12] to be you probably Paul you used to put
[1:13:15] people here and now you know how it
[1:13:17] feels and Paul and and what happens is
[1:13:22] when you be when you start in that you
[1:13:24] begin that you begin to recognize the
[1:13:26] grace of God and that's a powerful thing
[1:13:30] and then I believe that you have to come
[1:13:32] to a place as a Christian to catch a
[1:13:33] revelation of grace because you can you
[1:13:37] can you can like like John Newton that's
[1:13:39] what happened to him you wrote the song
[1:13:41] Amazing Grace he came to a revelation of
[1:13:42] the grace of God could save him could
[1:13:45] could could could bring him up from
[1:13:47] where he was into this position as a new
[1:13:49] person in Christ and so so they're
[1:13:52] beginning to realize that you know God
[1:13:53] is gracious and and maybe they begin to
[1:13:55] pray because the Bible says they prayed
[1:13:56] and and and praise the God and so
[1:13:59] they're gonna pray Lord forgive us for
[1:14:00] our attitude forgive us for looking at
[1:14:02] this wrong and we thank you Lord that we
[1:14:04] had the opportunity to set to
[1:14:07] to be used by you to set someone free
[1:14:08] today and lower in here because we
[1:14:10] confess your name and we're never
[1:14:12] ashamed of the gospel of Christ and and
[1:14:14] then you know I'm kind of and we thank
[1:14:17] you Lord and they finished their prayer
[1:14:18] and then you know I'm Silas begins to
[1:14:21] sing
[1:14:22] you ever hear deducing they can sing
[1:14:25] pretty anointed they get to going they
[1:14:29] get to singing some of their songs in
[1:14:30] Hebrews and my goodness you're just
[1:14:31] ready to rapture and so they begin to
[1:14:33] sing one of them good Hebrew songs and
[1:14:35] and they begin to shout and begin to
[1:14:38] praise it and they were just singing
[1:14:40] they were praising and I begin to praise
[1:14:42] God and maybe after they stopped singing
[1:14:44] they're just saying thank you Lord and
[1:14:46] hallelujah Lord and Lord we love you we
[1:14:48] praise you and and I challenge you any
[1:14:50] any of you to start saying praise the
[1:14:53] Lord
[1:14:53] and not smile it's next to impossible I
[1:14:57] because who are you on the inside you
[1:15:01] are a product you are a peace of God and
[1:15:04] if you begin to praise God the who you
[1:15:07] are a part of you begin to praise him he
[1:15:10] begins to get excited what you're gonna
[1:15:12] get excited to amen and so next thing
[1:15:15] they know the walls begin to shake and
[1:15:17] silent soon be hit it's Paul he says hey
[1:15:20] we've always talked about bringing the
[1:15:21] laws down
[1:15:22] he said we're doing it today him and
[1:15:25] everything came down and even their
[1:15:26] chamber broke loose and and we know the
[1:15:31] rest of the story so no matter what your
[1:15:33] circumstances is there's always a reason
[1:15:36] to praise God and this story keeps
[1:15:40] coming to my mind but our Andrew passes
[1:15:42] a church and she back Alaska and he was
[1:15:44] you saying he was out gathering
[1:15:47] driftwood cuz they don't think there's
[1:15:49] no trees so if they want fires they have
[1:15:52] to go down to the beach and gather
[1:15:53] driftwood and so he was down there and
[1:15:55] his back was killing them and he went
[1:15:57] you know he had to drag these big old
[1:16:00] logs of driftwood to his to his
[1:16:01] four-wheeler so he could cut him up and
[1:16:03] and haul him back and his back was
[1:16:05] really hurting him and for whatever
[1:16:07] reason he just stood up he looked around
[1:16:08] him if he ever been out there it's just
[1:16:10] gorgeous
[1:16:10] and he says while he began to praise God
[1:16:13] and begin to sing he said next thing I
[1:16:14] know a bag didn't hurt more
[1:16:16] it says it how it's good to go there's
[1:16:19] always something to thank God for amen
[1:16:23] praise the Lord
[1:16:24] there was a in Luke chapter 17 there's a
[1:16:28] story of some lepers and um go ahead and
[1:16:32] jump over there and read that I think it
[1:16:34] was ten lepers Luke chapter 17 17 verse
[1:16:47] 11 and it came to pass as he went to
[1:16:49] Jerusalem that he passed through the
[1:16:51] midst of Samaria and Galilee and as he
[1:16:54] entered into a certain village there met
[1:16:55] him ten men that were lepers which stood
[1:16:58] afar off and he lifted up their voices
[1:17:00] and said Jesus master have mercy on us
[1:17:03] and when he saw them he said unto them
[1:17:04] go show yourselves unto the priest and
[1:17:06] it came to pass that as they went they
[1:17:08] were cleansed and one of them when he
[1:17:10] saw that he was healed turned back with
[1:17:12] a loud voice glorified God and fell down
[1:17:15] his face at his feet giving him thanks
[1:17:17] and he was a Samaritan amen and Jesus
[1:17:24] answering said unto them said excuse me
[1:17:26] Jesus answering said where were were
[1:17:28] there not ten cleansed but where are the
[1:17:31] nine they are not found that returned to
[1:17:35] give glory to God save this stranger
[1:17:37] because he was a Samaritan he wasn't a
[1:17:39] Jew and he said unto Him arise go thy
[1:17:42] way thy faith hath made the whole the
[1:17:46] rest of the lepers he sent to the
[1:17:48] Pharisees but this man looks down he
[1:17:54] realizes they were all healed at the
[1:17:55] same time it looks down he was healed
[1:17:56] and he goes back to glorify God and God
[1:17:59] says your faith made the whole go you
[1:18:02] have no need to go to the to the
[1:18:03] Pharisees anymore you're completely
[1:18:05] whole amen and we know that leprosy is a
[1:18:14] type of sin and as a believer of you
[1:18:17] always have the ability like I said to
[1:18:19] be grateful for God and he saved you
[1:18:21] from sin sometimes people they're like
[1:18:24] these nine lepers God heals them hey go
[1:18:27] go to the go to the
[1:18:29] - The ministers go to the pastor to get
[1:18:31] baptized the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:18:33] they get baptized and they begin to
[1:18:35] serve God excuse me and they're
[1:18:40] delivered from sin and they forget to
[1:18:42] take the time to thank God amen and that
[1:18:46] and and and when God does something for
[1:18:48] you don't forget to take the time just
[1:18:50] thank him to thank him for what he's
[1:18:54] done for you amen praise the Lord
[1:18:56] brother Branham says in 1962 it's a
[1:18:59] story and he says tells the story of
[1:19:01] John Ryan the man who was blind and so
[1:19:06] John Ryan comes into line and the
[1:19:08] brother says poor boy was a Catholic his
[1:19:10] whole life he comes in to get us into
[1:19:12] the line for his healing but the batter
[1:19:14] becomes brother Branham brother BAM sees
[1:19:15] a vision that he's healed and he says
[1:19:17] you know just say Lord you were healed
[1:19:19] well Paul Ryan walks off the platform
[1:19:20] and he's still blind so he comes back up
[1:19:23] there and he gets back in line and he
[1:19:24] gets back up there and brother Branham
[1:19:26] says you mean believe me to be God's
[1:19:27] servant do I know you or restrain Jers
[1:19:30] he says yes and then he has a vision he
[1:19:33] sees that he's healed I mean so here's
[1:19:35] the same guy that was here here a minute
[1:19:37] ago
[1:19:38] hey guys look you've had him he says
[1:19:40] well I'm not healed who could have been
[1:19:42] a second or third time then he went to
[1:19:44] the line I can't remember but the man
[1:19:46] says no son God's already healed you you
[1:19:50] have to go just go testifying of what
[1:19:53] God's done for you and so he goes about
[1:19:57] and he prevents this he would stand up
[1:19:59] in the middle of the service and say hey
[1:20:00] hush up everybody listen to me God's
[1:20:02] done healed me thank you Lord and he
[1:20:04] says the trustees were and DK's were
[1:20:06] going up there to quiet it down for the
[1:20:08] nurses no no no leave him alone let him
[1:20:09] do that and so he went around praising
[1:20:14] God for his healing and I don't think
[1:20:17] was in a small town but he was unless he
[1:20:19] sold newspapers in his bless the corner
[1:20:21] and he's you know extra extra read all
[1:20:23] about it the Lord's healed me and it was
[1:20:26] obvious that he was still blind and so
[1:20:28] he says here he says so there was
[1:20:29] another little news boy come along and
[1:20:31] they took him over to the barbershop to
[1:20:32] get him a shave he wanted to go over and
[1:20:35] a little boy let him across the street
[1:20:36] he laid down in the chair and the barber
[1:20:38] it was one of those little he says Alex
[1:20:42] Mart's
[1:20:43] mmm I think you've been smart alecks and
[1:20:47] so he lathered up his face and wetted
[1:20:49] his razor and started shaving half his
[1:20:51] face down he said say dad Ryan he said
[1:20:53] yes sir what is it son he said said I I
[1:20:55] heard you was up to hear that Holy
[1:20:57] Roller preacher when he was up here say
[1:21:00] yes I was up he said I heard you God
[1:21:02] healed me
[1:21:02] he said yes praise God for healing me
[1:21:04] and his eyes come open in the barber
[1:21:07] chair out of that chair he went down the
[1:21:09] street with the towel around his neck
[1:21:10] the barber behind him such a display
[1:21:13] you've never seen and that man is
[1:21:14] preaching the gospel to this day amen
[1:21:17] why he looked he took God at His Word
[1:21:19] and they began to confess that him and
[1:21:22] there was two to two sisters that had
[1:21:25] both got up for prayer or believers and
[1:21:28] when I said sisters I've been believers
[1:21:29] not related and they both were in the
[1:21:33] same neighborhood and brother brems says
[1:21:35] the age of the Lord was going out and
[1:21:38] touching the people that God had that
[1:21:40] God had healed and giving the
[1:21:41] manifesting their healing and so the
[1:21:43] angel comes by and the lady had a I
[1:21:46] think of Goya on her neck and it fell
[1:21:48] off and I don't had a tumor or something
[1:21:50] and they both come running out from
[1:21:52] their houses they at each other and I
[1:21:55] just got healed
[1:21:56] Vibram says cousin Gloria just passed by
[1:21:58] so God gives you your healing he says
[1:22:02] this done saved Lord he told Abraham
[1:22:03] thus saith the Lord you're going to have
[1:22:05] a son the 2627 years later God finally
[1:22:09] gave him his son and that but in that
[1:22:16] your body obeys your confessions so
[1:22:19] these women and Paul and John Ryan
[1:22:21] they're confessing they're testifying
[1:22:23] that God had healed him even though on
[1:22:25] the flesh the manifestation of the flesh
[1:22:27] was the direct opposite but they're
[1:22:30] gonna confess that God has healed them
[1:22:32] and God they're a body obey the
[1:22:34] confession and God healed him if they
[1:22:37] had stopped there's stories of someone
[1:22:40] that I was healed in a wheelchair and
[1:22:42] then was stood up and the the mom and
[1:22:44] the nurse put them back down and they
[1:22:46] lost their healing Amen God gives God
[1:22:51] says hey you look I'm gonna heal you you
[1:22:53] confess and you believe that don't try
[1:22:55] to go off and then
[1:22:56] fix it on your own amen confess and give
[1:22:59] God the chance to heal you I think it
[1:23:03] was I was studying and brother branham's
[1:23:08] talking about about you know the
[1:23:12] Lord said he'd do it I can't remember
[1:23:15] anyway so you're saying the Lord the
[1:23:17] Lord said he's gonna heal you or the
[1:23:19] Lord said he's gonna gonna do something
[1:23:20] for you oh he says thus saith the Lord
[1:23:23] doesn't mean it's going to happen right
[1:23:24] now but it's going to happen
[1:23:30] praise Lauren so thus saith the Lord you
[1:23:33] know you have the right as a believer to
[1:23:37] be free to not have to to be caught up
[1:23:41] and as the rest of the world is around
[1:23:43] us and if we can if we can begin to show
[1:23:47] gratitude and making to be begin to be
[1:23:50] thankful our view will change of the
[1:23:53] world around us our view of the
[1:23:54] circumstances will change and you say
[1:23:57] you know maybe you got a beat-up car in
[1:24:03] begin to thank God for the beat-up car
[1:24:05] because it gets you from point A to
[1:24:07] point B and it's saving you money you
[1:24:10] don't have to be in debt and begin to
[1:24:14] thank God for that car watch God go
[1:24:17] ahead your your thoughts change you say
[1:24:18] well I said sort of look at say man this
[1:24:20] this thing he never runs right in and or
[1:24:24] it runs but doesn't run smooth and and
[1:24:26] find just speak negative and negative
[1:24:29] and negative but then you say I'm
[1:24:30] thankful you be gonna say thankful for
[1:24:33] that this car gets me to my job which
[1:24:35] brings in the money so that I can afford
[1:24:37] to live then you begin to your thoughts
[1:24:39] change now you don't hate the car you
[1:24:41] love the car and sometimes sometimes
[1:24:46] it's not your job or it's not the lack
[1:24:49] of money or it's not or it's not on the
[1:24:51] house it's just your attitude amen you
[1:24:54] can have people that they have this this
[1:24:57] pastors mentoring mentioning you know
[1:24:59] everyone's concerned about their health
[1:25:00] and you know as you get on Facebook and
[1:25:03] you see ads for this new pillow that
[1:25:05] does this or or this a new cheap quick
[1:25:07] way to get six-pack and all this stuff
[1:25:09] and that's all
[1:25:10] about health and then well there's
[1:25:11] there's this this this disease that I
[1:25:14] think they're calling it a disease but
[1:25:16] it's a mental illness of people you see
[1:25:18] these guys they look like Arnold
[1:25:19] Schwarzenegger did when he was a young
[1:25:21] man and they still think that they're
[1:25:23] not any good they still feel like they
[1:25:25] didn't need to lose weight it need to
[1:25:27] get bigger they need to get skinnier
[1:25:28] because they're feeding into that that
[1:25:33] that that idea all that I can think
[1:25:35] about is I gotta get better I got it I
[1:25:37] gotta be better I'm not I'm not any good
[1:25:38] I'm not any good and it's just this
[1:25:41] negative thoughts and so even though
[1:25:42] even though that they even though you as
[1:25:44] a Christian you're walking with God and
[1:25:47] then and you're feeding on God you say
[1:25:49] well you know the devil just gets in
[1:25:50] your head says hey you're not a
[1:25:51] Christian you begin to think I'm not
[1:25:52] good enough I'm not good enough to be a
[1:25:54] Christian I'm not you know all this and
[1:25:57] then you begin to think this negative
[1:25:58] stuff next thing you know but you begin
[1:26:00] to manifest that negative stuff and you
[1:26:02] find yourself backsliding but if you can
[1:26:03] say Lord you know that thought society
[1:26:05] that's just the devil trying to come
[1:26:07] into my head trying to give me to
[1:26:08] thinking negative thoughts and trying to
[1:26:10] get me to confess negativity I'm trying
[1:26:12] to get me to confess that I'm not a
[1:26:14] Christian and I'm not saved ISM well
[1:26:16] maybe I'm not saved knowing these
[1:26:18] thoughts come in your head next thing
[1:26:20] you know begin to confess that all
[1:26:21] that's going to do is bring you down but
[1:26:24] if you can begin to say no matter what
[1:26:26] God healing you begin to look back at
[1:26:28] when God filled you with the Holy Ghost
[1:26:29] and that's your said and that God saved
[1:26:31] your soul you said you know before the
[1:26:33] foundation of the world God knew I was
[1:26:36] going to be a part of his kingdom
[1:26:37] God had hand-selected me that I would be
[1:26:40] saved and filled the Holy Ghost
[1:26:41] and and you begin to think about that
[1:26:45] guess what your desire for Christ begins
[1:26:47] to grow some people have a real hard
[1:26:49] time and I think you know how do I know
[1:26:50] I really love God do I really love him
[1:26:53] and the you know we're always preaching
[1:26:55] about how you gotta have the love for
[1:26:56] God and I struggle this with this when I
[1:26:59] was younger and so how do I know yeah I
[1:27:00] don't really do I feel it I don't know
[1:27:03] and I'm beginning to realize that your
[1:27:06] love for him amen
[1:27:08] you could you can start to think it's
[1:27:10] not there because maybe you don't feel
[1:27:11] it you don't feel this love but you
[1:27:15] begin to realize you know hey I can't
[1:27:16] reading in the Bible and something stirs
[1:27:19] within you what is that stirring that
[1:27:22] stirring is your love for cry
[1:27:24] because you're spending time with him in
[1:27:27] his scriptures and something inside of
[1:27:30] you begins to bubble up there's a deep
[1:27:31] call to the demon if you ever again if
[1:27:34] you ever begin to question um anything
[1:27:36] just go question whether or not you have
[1:27:40] the goods go to back to the scripture go
[1:27:42] back to the message and just listen for
[1:27:46] a while just read for a while and when
[1:27:48] that thing within you begins to bubble
[1:27:50] up and that thing was then you begins to
[1:27:52] respond and say amen
[1:27:53] you just got your confirmation I mean
[1:27:56] there's that sister brother branham
[1:27:58] tells her story if she was all worried
[1:27:59] and nervous you know but the venom do I
[1:28:01] know it might save the mother they saved
[1:28:03] and there's also a doctor friend of his
[1:28:05] had the same thing and he says well
[1:28:06] let's go back to to the Bible let's go
[1:28:08] back to the doctor Jesus and let's go
[1:28:10] ahead and diagnose this thing
[1:28:12] hey man and that's what we have to do
[1:28:14] and then we get to look at at our
[1:28:16] mistakes and look at our shortcomings
[1:28:18] and what happens is we our view begins
[1:28:20] to taint and we think well how good can
[1:28:23] we be how how can we how come God even
[1:28:26] call us his own woman when when I just
[1:28:29] kicked the dog or I yelled at my wife or
[1:28:31] I or I yelled at my kids or I spoke
[1:28:33] harshly over here and the devil uses
[1:28:37] those and begin to see he begins to turn
[1:28:39] your eyes what off of the end of the
[1:28:41] goal and looking to either side and
[1:28:43] that's what you're gonna fall off the
[1:28:45] board and then but if you keep your eyes
[1:28:46] you say yeah I know my my my humanity is
[1:28:49] never going to be perfect this flesh man
[1:28:52] is never going to be perfect I'm gonna
[1:28:53] you know do kick the dog or slept say
[1:28:57] things I shouldn't have said I mean we
[1:28:59] always want to get better at those
[1:29:00] things and you should probably stop
[1:29:01] kicking the dog but granite there's
[1:29:04] always these things will do right
[1:29:06] because we're flesh man when you begin
[1:29:11] to focus on on on Christ and say you
[1:29:14] know it is bad that made me lose my
[1:29:16] train of thought it is with him that you
[1:29:19] find that you you begin to focus on
[1:29:21] Christ and say you know what he called
[1:29:24] me he ordained me and that's why I'm
[1:29:25] here today I lost my train of thought
[1:29:27] I'm sorry we'll go with that amen and we
[1:29:29] just say thank you Lord for that and we
[1:29:31] show that gratitude that God has has
[1:29:34] blessed us and filled us with the Holy
[1:29:36] Ghost
