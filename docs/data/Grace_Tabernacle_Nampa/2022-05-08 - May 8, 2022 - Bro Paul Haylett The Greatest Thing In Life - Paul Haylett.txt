happened in our family i thought i got through all my crying in the back room i wouldn't blame it on brother jay but anyway a lot happened in the family ifa they took her to the doctor just thinking she wasn't feeling well and here we are the doctor who himself has been a type one diabetic from a child couldn't ask for a more compassionate man so we're thankful on that part the doctors just tell us what they see i can't help but saints but i see a different picture i see my lord jesus receiving stripes and then declaring it's by these stripes i've received that you might be healed no sir no sir he said you are healed and we're standing on the word of god today hallelujah hallelujah so just please pray for our family we appreciate it i want to say god bless you to our mothers and i love that jason and our mothers to be god bless you sister tomah we're looking forward we're looking forward to another baby in our church we're looking forward to voices crying out in a language that we don't understand but they do and to see them rising up you see my brother and sister if the lord tarries many more years there'll be a whole new generation rise up and there has to be those of the word for their generation that overcome the circumstance of the age and so god is still bringing forth that generation and we say thank you for that lord and so we just say happy mother's day to each and every one of you amen if i could as it were figuratively give each one of you a rose and a hug i'd have to have sister jerry do the hugging but god bless you we love you and i thank you saints that i get to this is just from my heart i get to come to church and and go to church as it were with a group of people that love the lord amen we're not here because there's some kind of a reward for attendance there is actually a reward for attendance amen but that comes in another way and we're not here just to be socially gathered together or compare our latest fashions but we're here because there is something burning down in our soul that we want to serve the lord we want to be found in his presence we we want to be able to express ourselves and as i spoke to the church wednesday night sometimes we come to church and we're under a great burden the cares of life are strong and the devil would try to tell you you're a hypocrite because somewhere in the service you start to rejoice and you're praising god but my brother and sister we're not hypocrites and we are not imposters but when you come into the presence of the king of peace when you come into the presence of almighty god you say well i i had an attitude when i came to church and it's gone now that's because you came in his presence and he takes that away from us and takes that burden from us and we get to come and just worship the lord and come into his presence god bless you brother yannick sister sharon sorry about the misunderstanding the other day brother yannick i trust that you understand they also have a little one i'm not sure when is your baby due sister sharon july july and august are going to be blessed months in this church praise the lord hallelujah to see these beautiful little babies these gifts of god amen how precious how precious that is i want to just share with you uh brother george will be here on may the 20th through the 22nd we haven't totally laid the groundwork of what we're going to do but brother george gave me permission he says brother paul i'll be there to do whatever you ask me to do so we'll we'll post it real soon very quick on the on the church whatsapp and if you're not on the church whatsapp talk to the brothers that they would include you and um we'll have something done i have some things in my mind i do want to pass them before brother george and not blindside him so uh but may 20th to the 22nd and uh i also have you know normally i don't know how to put this but i had a very good visit with brother dwayne and sister coney fair yesterday and they were traveling and they're going to try to come into the states uh sometime in this next week and um if they can make it brother dwayne is not vaccinated which almost in this day and age we live in is like but he's desiring if they'll let him into the states they're going to come and lord willie this coming sunday um this coming sunday if um they can make it in the states i've asked brother duane if he would minister for us and now this is presumptuous and sounds but i i'll just throw it out here right now if brother dwayne cannot make it i'm asking my brother david to take the next sunday um so we just want to take advantage of this opportunity of brother dwayne coming through on their way to see their daughter and grandchildren oh and son-in-law amen so yeah just please continue to lift up our family amen um you know there's something the lord laid on my heart and kind of unique i struggle to title it until i come across a quote which we will share with you today that touched my heart and just confirmed my my thought was very close but when i got to see it as it were in print it struck me and i knew that's the right thing and i want to speak to you this morning on the greatest thing in life now we could put an s on that because actually we're going to be preaching in plural this morning but the greatest thing we know is jesus christ god bless you sister emmy sean and brother jason the song service i said after present jason come out i started crying every song that was played the special that was sung this morning or the song service this morning every bit of it spoke to me i was like thank you lord i just uh just the thanksgiving that i could give to the lord for speaking to our hearts amen and as we look at this and and i i just want to say thank you to our brother chris as he mentioned he called me yesterday and he says brother paul i know you're under a great burden is there anything i can do to take that help take that burden away if you need me to minister you need anything done i'm here to take that away and i say thank you brother chris amen just the the blessings of god uh every word that's been spoken this morning has spoken to me so we could take this and take it from the greatest thing in our life which is jesus christ but taking the prophet's words we can come in and we could make that plural the greatest things in our life because it's absolutely singular in the sense that god is over all things he's in control of all things he has predestinated ordained all things but he has allowed it to be broken down into a different you might say uh uh a pieces or or um oh i don't know i'm struggling for the word but to be broken down to come to us and bless us in different ways in different seasons and in different things and and i'm thankful today and i just pray that we'll be able to speak the word in such a fashion to bless you today let's turn in our bibles to the book of revelation the 21st chapter amen now i want to be very presumptuous this morning parents parents with young children i should say i had a epiphany at grace kids friday evening now if there's misunderstanding here or lack of communication i will accept the blame so please don't become upset but when i ask the children about the ten commandments i got a lot of blank looks parents i ask you make sure no matter how young they are that the ten commandments might be old testament but it's not an old word step in make sure your children know work with him i'm not i've never been one to be able to memorize things very well i remember as a kid i struggled terribly whether it was church vacation bible school whatever the situation would be that they wanted you to memorize things i pretty much just wanted to quit and go away because the minute i stood up in front of other kids or an instructor or whatever i i just blank slate forgot every drop but i would encourage you in your own home in your own place there to anchor these things in their hearts the gospel of jesus christ is reflected in the ten commandments amen and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband now if i could just step out be slightly precise this morning i believe john was looking down to this age and seeing the bride of this last day clothed in the word of god amen because he saw the age that was going to come and actually be presented as a bride now through the ages all of those ages thought that that was the imminent coming of the lord but there is an imminent coming of the lord and we are i believe with all of my heart in that season amen and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god this is not a distant god saints this is not a god out in the ether this is not a god sitting high on a throne somewhere with no care about your life this is a god that is going to be with you and in you and not only in you but he's going to possess you once upon a time a man was speeding and was pulled over by a police officer and the police officer come and says sir you were driving excessively excessively enough that you could be arrested and the man told the policeman he says be careful what you do i am a friend of the governor and the policeman stood there for a moment looking at him and said so sir you say your friend of the governor yes i am is the governor your friend we stand today not only claiming jesus christ as lord and savior but we can claim him as husband as bridegroom we can claim him as having possessed us oh hallelujah and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me oh hallelujah it is done amen hallelujah the very key words in our lord jesus christ spoke at calvary when he said it is finished my brother and sister what's he doing he's declaring to you and i don't worry about the end result i've took care of it it's done hallelujah oh my i get excited this evening this morning whenever it was it is done i'm alpha and omega the beginning and the end and i will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of the water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son but they're fearful see what satan's trying to do we've preached on this before but i felt led to just take the thought today from here satan is trying to make you fearful but the fearful and the unbelieving and abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death i want you to look at verse 8 real careful is there anything in verse 8 that god will not forgive us not one thing in verse 8 that god will not forgive us of so the reason these people will burn in the lake is because they wouldn't come and submit to the blood of jesus christ in other words their choice the welcome mat is out the light is on the door is open but some people will refuse to be a participant of the word of god i say today lord help us surrender lord help us be humbled help us lay ourselves down hallelujah oh hallelujah and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vowels full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife oh hallelujah thank you lord jesus this morning your grace your mercy your kindness to us father open your word to us like never before lord we just come this morning and surrender to your will to your guidance lord help us to be quiet and wait on you father that you could speak to our souls in a world lord that is increasingly busy increasingly loud increasingly disruptive lord help us to find a quiet peace a quiet place to discover your presence touch us with your word this morning i ask in the name of jesus christ amen it may be seated saints it is good to each and every one of you you know it's easy to say we have visitors but we don't really have visitors because every son and daughter of god is part of the body of christ and we just claim that we claim our position in the body of christ so those who have not fellowshipped amongst us in the past i say god bless you and welcome and i pray the lord would bless you today amen as we look through the word saints we can see this wonderful plan of god isn't that it's amazing you know house to some people all things are negative they opened the bible i remember talking to a man one time he says well i don't even like reading the bible and i i just couldn't help but ask him why and he says well it said i'm going to hell now that's a pretty strong statement my brother and sister because i picked up this same word the same book that he did and it told me i was going to heaven and so it's there and that perspective that we take to the word of god is determining what we see amen and so you know it is there that we have to look through the word and we see this beautiful this wonderful plan of god and you know we start in genesis and i struggled in placing these notes because i wanted to lay this foundation out but i didn't want it to come negative on mother's day to preach about eve you know it would be like oh my now where are we going with this but we'll lay a little foundation my brother and sister that you can see the beauty of the position god chose for you in the body of christ amen he didn't choose you as a failure he didn't choose you as what transgressor but he chose you as his very wife the lamb's wife amen so we start in genesis and we see this uh display of god's creative power isn't that incredible i i was just thinking about this and and on on my computer in the offices is uh uh the you know photo whatever you call it just constantly different photos going across the screen and uh to see beautiful places that the lord has blessed us to travel and and to be and you know it just reinforced in my heart how that this creation of our lord jesus christ uh almighty god made this creation and how it is so beautiful you go and you see the sun rise you see the sun sets you see the mirror of a mountain lake and you see all these things and there's something stirs within us and you know we we just recognize this display of god's creative power and you look at this and if you just stop for a moment and was to think about the most beautiful thing that you have ever seen and realize that it is only a foretaste of the beauty that is in our lord jesus christ it is only a down payment of the beauty of uh serving our god amen and so as it's there we recognize that these beautiful things and when we see genesis the third chapter some might get the impression things went sideways get the impression that this beautiful plan of god that was starting out somehow got derailed and how that satan had wormed his way in and and brought a destruction and satan would like to remind now those of you that weren't here wednesday night we have to go back just for one moment just a little bit and and be reminded now that in spite of satan's rebellion he got kicked out of heaven and cast to the earth and woe to the inhabitants of the earth but you see the holy spirit god himself was poured into the inhabitants or some of the inhabitants of the earth and satan got down here and recognized the same adversary he faced in heaven he is facing today and the same adversary that whipped him in heaven is here on the earth today and god chose to put himself or pour himself into you and i as vessels of honor hallelujah and that's why we can come and when satan thinks he has advantage my brother and sister god comes right on the scene and anoints you god comes right on the scene and empowers you god comes down and reminds you of the things that you already know that you would be able to stand and say that's right i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god and satan is already defeated i'm not looking for victory come on saints i want you to understand this i'm not here this morning looking for victory i already have victory in the name of jesus christ i don't have to hope that i can be an overcomer i already am an overcomer by the word of god and problem is as we look at what's right in front of us we look right in front of us and that's all we see but we've got to lift our eyes and say god has a plan god has a plan for me amen yes sir do you know if you drive a car down the road and you're one of those kind i'm sure there's someone here like that today and i don't mean it derogatory but do you ever follow a car and you see it it kind of bebops from line to line and seems to wander all over the place you know they're not necessarily inattentive professional drivers will tell you they're looking at the road too close in front of their car if they would lift their eyes and look out in front of them they would drive a much truer path on the road and that's sometimes how christians believers kind of bobbing right and left in their life and sometimes as a pastor you get a little nervous or are they are they anchored well my brother and sister i'm going to believe they're real sons and daughters of god i'm not going to judge them otherwise but i do believe i will declare they're looking too close in front of them they're not looking out at the plan of god for their life they're looking at their circumstance which is the pavement that disappears under the hood of your car so genesis 3 happens and many people express it and i i'm learning to not take everything that everybody says as concrete because i have made statements in such a fashion that taken as concrete would leave one to believe that paul had a problem here there whatever so i'm learning i'm learning that that this plan of god isn't what paul thinks it's not what this one thinks or this church thinks but it is what god thinks amen so it is that satan uh you know coming there in the garden and and uh coming as it were and he starts to come up and as the scripture says he beguiles eve now my brother and sister we'll look at that and it seems like oh what a utopia we would live in if that hadn't happened but you see god saw this great big picture he saw something so much greater than you and i amen as it would be we would not see the expression of the saints of old that were willing to die for their faith we would not have seen the supernatural power as the apostle paul being bitten by the serpent we would not see those that were willing to sacrifice all for the gospel we would have saw none of that but those are attributes that god desired to be expressed and god said i'm not doing this to be as it were cruel to my children but i'm doing this that the power that is in me who i am might be expressed to the world that they could see just truly how great their god is but i want you to catch this now it's also that we could see just how great god is in us amen if we're sitting here thinking we're little puppets little muppets little something to be manipulated you've missed the whole point of god god looking for someone he could pour himself into that could manifest the word of god and prove to satan once and for all it was not just a chance that he was defeated and cast out but it was the plan of god i say thank you lord we're here this morning because of a plan not an accident just say well i was born in a church i was born in a family in this that believed in god i was this that had nothing to do with it god chose you for who you are oh that's why our children must rise up and they must have a personal experience with the lord because mama and dad can't get them in a rapture mom and dad cannot pave the way for them but mom and dad can do the word of god as we spoke to the kids the other night and they can train their children up and believe that promise when god said you train the child up he will not depart people say about my my child he's backslid he's gone well i'll tell you what i was just talking with a brother recently he started to share with me what's happening in their church he said people sometimes don't know how to respond i've spoke this in this church but a young man it's all tattooed up he said he looks rough looks just really rough come in the house of god just a few weeks ago gave his heart back to the lord is he any less a christian than you and i because he's got tattoos no sir this right here my brother and sister is going to be left behind it is the soul that god valued and then he's sharing these things that's happening how they're having baptism of young men and women that have been raised up in the church and backslidded stages in their life and god is coming back to them and wooing them oh don't tell me god has lost his touch that god's plan has been derailed oh look at this and i'm telling you i'll just be bold i'll be bold my brother and sister i'm claiming the holy ghost for everybody inside this body of believers we are not going to let satan have one not one amen we have a promise and i've chosen we were just discussing this and my brother and sister look if we're believers we're believers and if we're anything else we're unbelievers i was called to be a believer i wasn't called to have some lukewarm straddle defense relationship with god i'm not here to say why doesn't god answer my prayer while i live any old kind of life i want to live i want my god to answer my prayer so i'm going to meet god's qualification forget about this it's too hard hallelujah reminds me of a story i read about a young man going through military training become a 101st airborne in the us army and uh somebody asked him he says um what was it like the first time you jumped out of an airplane he said i didn't jump no you have your you have your parachute badge you jump to an airplane no he says my sergeant threw me out i pray god would just overcome our reservation oh i don't want to be presumptuous but maybe god would adore or ordain me to come and be the one that throws you out of the airplane hallelujah i wouldn't want to be rude i wouldn't want to be out of place but my brother and sister whatever it takes that we can get our wings whatever it takes to be able to find faith in the word of god hallelujah that man went on to be one of the uh more decorated not the most but more decorated soldiers this served in in world war ii my brother and sister if we could just see what god has in store for us we could just see what god really wants us to be how precious that would be now satan got cast out of heaven he lost the battle and he's believing that he can do the same thing in this day believes he can come down right first adam and eve prophet of god speaks of these things we come down to the second adam amen there's an eve as it were in this day and satan's believing he can come and usurp his own beguiling ways to the bride of this age but what he's missed my brother and sister is the same word as i already said the same word amen that was there is here now but what he's really missed is this bride of this age has become the word we're not looking for a word to come deliver us my brother and sister the word is already here it's already in me it's already in you oh we stumble and we fall and satan says i got you but my brother and sister we have resurrection life amen we might stumble but we rise again amen satan might think you're defeated but we rise again whoa hallelujah oh my amen amen lamb's wife she's so in love with him you know i love to read and i'm sorry i just throw these little things in reminds me of a story i read once about relationships young man and young woman on their honeymoon worldly people on their honeymoon and a real hanson debonair man comes up says hey i want to dance with you speaking to this young man's wife very pretty girl i want to dance with you she looks up at her husband and she says okay her husband's stunned he's stunned but she walks this man across the floor kind of over where no one's at and proceeds to tell him who do you think you are to come into my life with your charm with your seducing voice and all that you have thinking that you could come you see this ring this says i belong to him and turns and walks back and her husband's like did you change your mind she says no my mind was made up already oh hallelujah i got my mind made up and i won't turn back hallelujah that's the kind of bride that's on the earth on this day right here this is a reflection of genesis the third chapter and it's filled with the holy ghost empowering a bride that says whoa devil you seduce me once you won't do it again i'm uh married see the ring i belong to him i hope you don't mind i'll get a little excited this morning amen you know we sing that song he's got it all in control we either believe it or we don't i personally saints and i hope each one of you can lift a hand or lift your heart and say i believe it i'm not here to be seduced by the devil to break a vow i made to god i am sold out oh hallelujah and i'm not only sold out i'm in love with him this is not a meal ticket for me this is not some avenue for a better life i'm in love with him and whether it's for richer or for poor for better or for worse for health and all what my brother and sister i'm sold out that's where my position is hallelujah now look i shared this quote on wednesday but it just struck my heart i wonder what it would be tonight if we could climb above the heavens of heaven and look at this great drama as it's getting set together now fixing to come to pass of god and the devil coming to a showdown i'm so glad that i'm on the winning side can we make a declaration today i'm on the winning side amen i decided i'm with my lord jesus christ i'm standing with him i'm sold out with him i made a vow to him now look at this if we could climb above the heavens of heaven i touch on this wednesday i just want to very briefly touch this again the prophet of god the word of god is talking about heavenly places my brother and sister we don't have to worry about going in a rapture to look back to see what god brought us through but we have been ordained by the word to rise now into heavenly places and when we're living in heavenly places you might have tough days you might have tough circumstances but you can look back and say the battle is already been won the victory's already been given to me i don't have to be buffeted by the devil because he's got a bluff hallelujah and if you're living in heavenly places you're looking down on the devil he's not in a position of authority in your life you're living in a position you look down on the devil and you've got to learn to say devil why would i come down to the pit with you when i can rise in heavenly places with my lord jesus oh thank you lord jesus amen hallelujah amen it's getting set together fixing come to pass of god and the devil coming to a show down do you have your name in there yes sir is your name in this yes come on saints you'll say well i don't see my name in there yes it is because god's in you and you were in god amen so you're right there with this showdown god's already given you victory because he is victory amen oh i don't know could i could you humor me this morning and just repeat those words right here i'm so glad that i'm on the winning side amen nobody likes to be on the losing side it's just a human nature i'm so glad you realize let me put this i'm gonna get a little sidetracked forgive me just say a quick prayer for me here but you realize that every one of us follows something or someone people talk about the message of the hour and they say they follow that william branham they're in a cult if they're baptists they have their man their nazarene their methodists they're catholic they're mormon they all got their man but you know my brother and sister i come across a lovely little quotation i'd read it to you perfectly correct if i had my phone here but you see no one ever criticizes you oh sister jared you remember how that was i'm just you know i do this it's the pressure pressure gets to me oh those that criticize you these won't be the perfect words those that criticize you are doing nothing they criticize you because you're doing more than them you imagine come on there'll be folks right here in this church and i don't mean to be too personal to you but there's people here that are struggling with this giant called the devil in their life but if you just realize this devil is actually doing nothing and that's why he's criticizing you he's a jealous he's a jealous god with a little little little little little g because one he knows he doesn't have eternal life he contains no healing virtue you know god poured creative power into you whereby the laying on of hands and the prayer of a righteous son or daughter of god brings healing virtue satan never healed a single one because as the scripture says that had two demons competing against each other no no my brother and sister i'm getting sidetracked forgive me i got a pile of notes so big if i come to preach it you'd had to brought a basket of lunch amen now look we need to apply this even more saints brother david knows what i'm talking about and that spirit's been getting on chris lately you notice that anyway sorry about that but look at this my brother and sister now is it what it happened here as we get closer to the culmination of the age these things are coming in a greater force these things are being manifested in a greater force as a coming of the age a culmination of the age is coming and so it's there satan sees just as we're looking for the rapture satan's seeing the clock wind down on his time and he's getting desperate well i hope you are desperate devil amen because this bride of christ has already been uh uh revelated to see uh your tactics and who you are amen now let's look i got a lot of quotes hope you don't mind them today amen now i want you to notice i believe that god is just as tangible in this room tonight as the light is on my hand so no doubt there was light shining on his hands do you believe that now notice get the fundamental foundation first that divine healing is in christ can you imagine that people that call themselves christians don't believe in healing you talk about the devil doing real slick deal there this really struck my heart saints because of my granddaughter it struck my heart deep because of my granddaughter and he is as present and just as close to you as the light that's shining on you now now i would like you to measure if you were standing in the light i would want you to measure this separation from you in the light hallelujah you couldn't measure it that's the infinite he's forever and forever he knoweth the beginning he now how the devil fights this wonderful truth of divine healing marks it up oh somebody the church is going to wake up to the fact and realize that they have oh we're getting down to my title here they have the very greatest one amen the greatest things that they had and the greatest blessings outside of salvation they turned it down so here is divine healing to believe that god is in control of my life and the time and the season is there and if the affliction still resides in my flesh it does not matter i'm not looking to my flesh i'm looking to the word of god and the word of god said i'm healed oh you fanatic you yes throw me in there with him throw me in there with him i'm already healed amen claim your affliction put it before the throne of almighty god and declare i'm healed it's done [Music] someday look at this someday prophet preaching this 1953 someday the church is going to recognize my brother and sister we can stand here this morning without boasting without stepping on a limb on thin ice we can stand here and say this is the day this is the someday the prophet of god was talking about that we can step out take possession of this believe it with all that is within us all but i don't see the manifestation of healing in your body well i'll tell you what the healing of my soul is so much more important to me than the healing of my body but i give the healing of my body to my lord what you desire lord people say well he died and never did get healed well if you make it to the other side with that kind of attitude you'll see some young man sprinting running jumping praising young woman sprinting running jumping praising and you'll wonder where's their affliction i don't know how many of you would know brother ballroom up in canada but here is a brother that has been afflicted in his flesh forever and as he gets older it's getting harder and harder for him to walk he kind of drags a leg i don't know all what what exactly was wrong with him but you know i mean as far as what the names would be but i just know my brother ballroom and here's a man that goes along with this deal and just barely moves but here's a man whose faith every time i would talk to him his faith has stretched the boundaries and his faith is growing while his body is diminishing his faith is growing and he's declared hallelujah the lord showed me i've got a new body waiting oh that's the kind of faith i want grace tabernacle to have i'm not looking at this world and these afflictions i'm looking to who i am and i am the word i am not a weary man i am the word that's right that's right oh people say that's too weird you don't know your bible if you think that's weird hallelujah oh yeah yeah see someday the church is going to wake up to that fact and he's the greatest one oh my goodness my brother and sister look at that i'm sorry i'm excited i'm excited oh did you catch that one of the greatest things outside of salvation search the message you're not going to find brother brown talking about a big church a big car a nice house he's not going to talk about those things being amongst the greatest outside of salvation so now he's just anchored our healing as one of the greatest things that god give us outside of salvation whoa thank you lord well we choose to major on other things yeah yeah yeah lord i'll leave that alone thank you lord close as the light some day the church is going to wake up to that fact realize the very greatest one the greatest things that they had the greatest blessings outside of salvation they turned it down i don't know why i feel led to just drive this home drive at home saints you say but brother paul i've been praying for healing for years just keep praying it's good for your character it keeps you humble it keeps you down on your knees before the lord the devil would like you to give up and say you know what whatever it was that's afflicting you is yours forever and as long as you step into that realm it will be step over here in faith grab a hold of a giant chunk of faith amen they turned it down many times i found the heathens over there in africa the missionary told them the days of miracle is past and the poor fellow is walking around packing mud idols trying to get healing through mud idols because they know their fathers god winked at their ignorance you get this saints god winked at the ignorance in the days gone by but we have the opened word in our day god doesn't have a wink for you god isn't sitting here giving you the little wink my brother and sister god said i have sent a prophet to restore the word it is now restored and you don't have a wing you have the word take the word don't look for the wink take the word i'm sorry i'm getting too loud here forgive me hallelujah amen god went to their ignorance had healed them through believing in the god of their mud idol but the theology of preachers today and of churches and things that deny the power of god to heal now notice friend one day for instance the electric lights there was a time when a man would have fought if they'd have been told somebody let me i can't hardly read that there was a time when a man would have thought that if they had told somebody 500 years ago that they'd have an electric light like that the person would have said the person was crazy but there was a man one time who down in his heart believed that there was that he could catch that electricity and he got a kite and a key and he fished it out of the skies hallelujah well i'm telling you what people will say show me faith i don't need to show you faith it's right here all i got to do is believe that faith is present with me amen the prophet of god said everything you need to make the rapture is already in you so quit running quit running quit running and stop and say lord release what is already in me today you gave it to me before the foundation of the world lord release it help me to be surrendered so you can release it that's right amen amen amen preach it that's it seen a little video once of a man that just cast his paycheck and he comes out and a couple guys go to hold him up and finally they bully the man into handing over his wallet but he reaches out and he grabs a lamp pole and he grabs the front of the man's coat and the man is pounding him blood flying everywhere pounding him you think what's he doing and then you hear the siren and the man starts screaming let go of me let go of me let go of me and he's pounding on this man with ferocity because he realized what the man was doing yeah he got a piece of the man his wallet but the man got all of him and it's about time saints we take the devil by the throat and we don't let go until he is vanquished not listen a little bit oh get away from me devil quit bothering me devil no don't torment me devil come on the song says it's a midnight hour if you should find you're in a prison in your mind give up no fight fight call out the name of the lord call his presence around you and the devil's going to say okay you can let me go now no you're vanquished you're defeated i overcome you by the word of my mouth by the blood of the lamb oh hallelujah oh hallelujah oh my he fished it out of the skies now listen look at this and when he it run down the string or it hit into the bottle he stopped it up and he began to scream i got it i got it he had it but he didn't know what he had that's what the church the matter with the church today they got something but they don't know what they got now i don't want to sound too harsh to you saints but if we're sitting here with a little something in our life besetting sin doubts and fears that cause you to sit down on the word of god you don't know what you've got because if you knew what you had you would rise up in authority not in yourself not in yourself you would rise up in authority and say you know what i've already been loosed satan is already defeated now why am i surrendering to an enemy that's carrying a surrender sign i hope that's not offensive but it's time for us to quit surrendering to a defeated foe it's time for us to say you know what the word of god says i know i don't look like it i look battered and beaten but the word says i'm victorious so regardless of what you look like satan i'm not going to surrender to you come on saints we need to come and rise up we need to take possession of what god has given us instead of sitting around i don't know what it is god wants me to do yes you do he wants you to live an overcoming life he wants you to be filled with the holy ghost he wants you to sing praises to his name he wants you to testify to the heaven that he is the king of king don't tell me you don't know what god wants you to do amen the word has clearly showed us that i don't want to be offensive on that saints but it's time we start calling white white and black black amen and get to the point that we can stand up on the word of god stand up on your own two god-given empowered feet amen hallelujah now as we look at this and i i'll be open i i i shared wednesday night where i got this from i was listening brother barry minister up in the the uh banquet that we went to and i just love this so much i just can't get it off my mind amen it all has to do with our proximity to christ i can see jesus christ he's on the top of that mountain over there that mountain called mount calvary he's all the way over there no sir no sir he's off the cross saints don't come back try and put him on the cross again and again and again the scripture says that's what happens to those that will never be able to come back get right up close how about we just throw our arms around him amen get so close to him you won't need binoculars you won't need nothing because you'll be feeling him amen oh it's not about feelings well i'm telling you my brother and sister i hope this don't sound too personal my wife's sitting in the back of the church with grandchildren today i can't feel her right now but i know what it is to wrap my arms around her so you can go through life and have circumstances say i don't feel the presence of lord right now but you can also stop and say i know he is with me i was with him this morning i was with him last night i was with him this and so i know by the word and the promise of the word is right here so i don't have to go by a feeling because i already know i got him and he's got me yeah yeah thank you lord so your proximity to christ will determine the light by which you see revelation well of course jesus christ is coming back if that's all the deeper your revelation is you could be almost any religion isn't that give you a feeling of freedom that you could be any religion you want no sir there's no feeling of freedom in something so mundane and watered down something so washed out well i have no problem drinking dancing and smoking because i jesus died for me that's good i'm not going to criticize you but something's missing in that feeling something's missing in that relationship huh and i don't mean to bash on those things amen look revelation doesn't come from casual interaction you know where revelation comes from saints intense intense interaction intense proximity with our lord jesus christ is where revelation comes from people will say things like well i read the same scripture the same quote and i don't see what you see no wonder they think people in the message can be arrogant i can't help it that i read my bible and it speaks to me i can't help it i read the message and it speaks to me can't help that i i can't say okay lord just shut it off i can't do that years ago when i was a young man teenager accident moved away ran around all over the southwest slept on porches and couches and floors and slept in my vehicle more than i'd like to admit and yet even in that stage of my life god was speaking to me because i couldn't turn it off god wasn't going to allow it to be shut off oh my brother and sister so know one of the great gifts that god would give to the bride of christ you'll see this expressed in the message and i was going to put the sermon that brother brown talked about it primarily but i didn't get to it but brother branham comes to a stage in his life in his ministry he's prayed for healing thousands upon thousands tens of thousands healed he's cast out demons he didn't cast them out the holy ghost did all these things happening people finding deliverance and understanding in the word and then god starts to deal with the prophet and his prayer starts to be lord help me be more sincere his prayer wasn't i want to show the world i want to be the most powerful evangelist i want to no what did it do it started to humble him down and he started looking at this right here and said you know what this old flesh is not sincere enough it was a gift actually that god gave him you say it's not a gift to be manifested the world to prove how do you prove sincerity you know there is a proof for sincerity doing what you said you would do it is the key of sincerity from the heart freely doing but here's a prophet lord help be more sincere i've been all these years made it to around 50 years old and suddenly decides he's not sincere enough god help us saints help us to come to a place where we realize this is a gift god has given us that we could see a need for a greater sincerity amen oh look at this now see prophet's answer for sincerity was to get into the word more that's right he didn't go out and read a book on how to be sincere he didn't go ask some psychologist or something now what is a guy got to do to be sincere he got in the word amen and as more of the word got in him the more of the word poured out of him and it was there that god looked down and said my son is sincere it wasn't by some other action so getting the word how about it come on want to get in the word come on saint somebody lift a hand somebody cries somebody do something amen we're not we're not just i'm not trying to just get your amen i'm wanting you to say amen because it's then you saying so be it it's me saying i want to be more sincere lord so be it amen now let me hurry along here because i got so much you know here's the problem we have saints and i hope this don't stomp on anybody's toes but we have too many people today promoting the message we are not here to promote the message we are here to promote jesus christ see promoting the message is just us becoming another denomination amen hallelujah so this message is not what we're promoting it's christ that we promote because it's christ that makes a difference you say well brother paul it's what brother brown said sure it is but whose words was it in the beginning well i got a big long quote here are you guys okay okay but when the blood cell was broken the lamb the life brother i'm talking about the sacrifice here the life that was in the blood cell was animal life it would not coincide with human life but when the blood cell of emmanuel was broken then his spirit the life that was in the blood cell of emmanuel returns back which is none other than the holy spirit itself and the worshiper once with the holy spirit in him his heart becomes changed now not from an intellectual view of the bible or a conception of any creed but from an experience from a witness of the resurrection jesus said ye are my witnesses after the holy spirit comes upon you not until the holy spirit comes were they witnesses they could not witness until the holy spirit for he is the witness the bible says no man can call jesus a christ only by the holy spirit amen so you know some people say well i walked into church and i just felt it and i knew that was holy spirit come on the devil's an impersonator he's an outright fraud actually amen outright fraud yeah you notice how the devil never have you know have you guys gotten any you know your car warranty has expired and uh that big bucket full of money you spent at amazon and ordered all these things and now you just need to give your credit card to confirm it well if i had ordered it you would already have my credit card have you noticed that they never call you up and say hi i'm a fraudster and i need your credit card number expiry and the code on the back because i'm going to drain your account and not only that i need your bank account number oh and while you're at it throw your social security card in the mix also no no the devil's much more slippery than that he comes along and gets people to believe that they are totally committed they're totally on board but yet they're just doing what they want to do and believe that they have some special token reminds me of a time little story man had a little token and he went i think it was disneyland goes up to pay for his deal and they said it's like 40 bucks and he pulls the token out and says hey it's discounted i have a token i hope you see the humor the clerk says without a chocolate one or vanilla come on nothing to do with it nothing i hope you catch my point nothing to do with it but people have their token wrong kind of token prophet of god showed us so clearly what the token was that was the word the holy ghost in us there's our token it's not chocolate and it's not vanilla but it works hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen let's stand up watch something take place what a display could you imagine the omnipotent unpresent omnipresent omniscient infinite god would ever let the devil defeat his purpose couldn't happen no not god he will never do it when he looked at his family in the garden of eden when little adam and eve and her lovely little head laying on adam's shoulders as he moved through the garden now remember what brother brown says these these artists painted eve as a hideous do you realize connotation of that they were anointed by the devil to try to make the bride of this age look like the filthiness out there that hideous little bride they tried to make believe was eve my brother and sister was nothing more than satan's life manifested in the artistic form because this bride is beautiful this bride is the very beauty of god's eye she's got his heart amen and it is there she doesn't just have his heart she has him hallelujah she has him so the devil trying to make eve look like some kind of hideous is trying to make the bride of this age think that she's going to be a filthy uh oh my goodness street walking whatever of a bride not going to happen it worked once devil but it won't work again little adam and eve her lovely little head lying on adam's shoulders he moved through the garden and if the winds blowed and little eve said oh adam said peace be still and the wind stopped and the lion and the tiger followed them they was kittens oh my isn't that beautiful in the evening when the sun was going down and they went to the cathedral into the palm trees or whatever trees it was in eden and they began to worship a soft mellow light god the logos come down over the tops of the trees and he said children have you enjoyed yourself today on the earth i've come down to kiss you good night god forgive me because i get busy so tired sometimes i give i give so little i get down to the end of the day and you've heard the radio ad you know we have these cars we have this we have that we can do this and we'll do that and finance this and then all of a sudden it changes over and over [Music] we only had that's what the devil wants our evening conversation to be you realize why we should be picking up our bibles we should be getting down on our knees because he wants to come right down in our midst and kiss us good night amen can you imagine little old me not accomplished it much in my life a high school dropout been blessed with a good family and god wants to come down every single night and kiss me good night all our hearts should be humbled saints that god would love us so much he would come down to kiss us good night we're too busy listening to them wow yeah yep lay them down at sleep and he laid all of his animals down to rest through the night and the father said that's good i like the way it's done do you think that heavenly father will be defeated in his purpose you think of god that's powerful enough to do that would be defeated in his purpose even though satan has done what he's done it's an impossibility he will not be defeated he's given us a perfect assurance that we will not have to be scared of anything oh hallelujah amen oh my brother and sister now i want to go back just real quick we're going to close seems almost impossible that we could have something and not know what it is i want you to think about that could i ask you to do a little personal homework go home car whatever it is go sit in the park look through your life and ask yourself why you think that god chose you exceptional intelligence great physical strength great reasoning what could it be why god would choose us you see god placed i had another word here but i'm going to go with brother david god place that seed god never lost a seed yet right that's what his word says god doesn't get out there and say now i planted these yesterday are these peas or corn or squash or what is this i don't know what i've done no sir god's never lost one he's put those seeds in that place and some seed comes up in some difficult times and places but you know what my brother and sister god is revealing to the bride through her proximity to the word who she is and where she's at in this great economy of god and as you look at this now who put the scarecrow up who put the scarecrow just visiting with individual here recently and i just asked him you know i'm getting that no filter old age things creeping up on me really fast so how did you come to the message well i worked with this guy and um he was a fanatic he was just really just a religious fanatic and he was telling me all about this man that god had set down to correct the word and my mind was like going uh now i don't know how that can be how then another guy i worked with come walking up and said he's just a religious fanatic he's just a religious freak you stay away from him and he said i stood there and i was like but i like this man so now i like a religious fanatic a religious freak and i don't like you strange how god works and the more this guy told him that he's in a cult the more he decided he'd go see what it is because this guy is real nice and he's over here saying don't worry about him over there god loves him too so this guy hates him this guy loves him he decided i think i'll go see what the one who's doing the lovin has and he said i walked into church and before i walked out that night i realized i was not just a sinner but i was a sinner saved by grace and it was real grace and it was real love and it was a real life and then i went back to work and the guy says i hear you went over to his church and got saved and he said yes i did and then he started hating me imagine what was it just a man living his life working in a factory every time a piece of steel come up bang against the deal he reached out and pulled the lever now you'd think they could build a machine to do that but that man needed a job to stand there next to that man so he could witness what's this man's job just make sure the piece of steel was in the right place you know what god's job was to make sure both of them were in the right place that was god's job because the seed was already in him god didn't have to run down there and say whoa i got to put a seed in this man oh hallelujah i'm getting so sidetracked you guys got to stop doing that to me amen look at this amen will not be defeated he's given us a perfect assurance i say thank you lord amen hallelujah hallelujah amen so we don't we don't know but it's see it's just satan putting this but look at this word saints this might be a little personal you don't have to lift no hands you don't have to do it but aren't you amazed how the holy spirit's come down and identified every satanic seed the devil tried to leave in your garden all doubts amen all fierce all these seeds that the devil poured out god says no problem i've got a gardener i've got a gardener he'll come you don't worry about it you don't worry about it amen and the same is revealing the hidden mysteries of god this is not just god that shows up at church for a picnic this is not god that comes and has ceremony this is a god that's a living god it's a living fire that's coming my brother and sister to burn the dross out of us and prepare us i say thank you lord for we don't have just this little pandering of whatever we don't print a sermon a month in advance because that's what we do we rely i can't tell you i can't speak for anybody else but i want to tell you my brother and sister oh let me put it like this every song that was saying every song that was played before the service i'm not lifting people up here i want you to know i'm talking about my god every song played before the service every song that was saying every special this special that was saying this morning was thoughts words and whatever that crossed upon my heart this morning in the early hours now i want to throw something out to you in closing here did god anoint them because i was preaching what i was preaching did god anoint me because they were singing what they were singing or did god come down and touch every single one of us that's god in our presence saints there's no great man there's no person with some kind of great influence this is god speaking to you in your garden speaking to me in my garden because he is in love with his bride and he's coming down in the cool of the evening as it were to speak to her and say i hope you had a good day and if we haven't had a good day my brother and sister then we were probably looking at our circumstance and not him amen i gotta close out i cannot just leave this saints okay please forgive me it's a little long i hope your mother's day lunch is not burning amen take take mother to the restaurant give her the day off okay amen now look at this expectations i don't i don't mean to be try to be funny i don't i don't mean it that way now this is not to be humble or to show off but from the bottom of my heart i wish i had a place where i could work while in these meetings that's right so i wouldn't have to even take up an offering or something that's the truth i just dread the thoughts of taking up an offering don't you do you don't don't know why but i've often seen that three things that hinder a minister that's right that's it that's exactly right yeah ouch you realize he's not talking to most of you there's like three guys here four whatever that he's like yes sir yeah yeah yep three things that hinder a minister one main three things one of them is money and the other is women the other is popularity that's exactly right and when a man gets to a place he just has to scream this is why sometimes i raise my voice i kind of feel bad it's like lord i don't i'm not trying to qualify in this i'm i'm sorry i just get excited i can't help myself yeah and i don't get to do it at home when i'm studying because our bedroom is right next door to my office and it wakes sister jerry up and her grumpy sister jerry is not good one of them's money women popularity exactly right when a man gets to a place he just has to scream and cry and carry on and think so much of money now i'm just going to say it i'm just tired of apologizing or trying to get people to understand me you know i don't even know who in this church gives anything i don't know whether you give a dime or 10 million well i might notice if you gave 10 million and you know why i chose to take that route because i recognized it one time in my life that there's an influence how you treat people so in case any of you ever felt like i was drilling down on you for some reason please dismiss that because you see you might be the most steady tithe payer you might be doing whatever you might not be doing nothing at all i like the liberty that if god lays it on my heart i can preach it i don't want to be bound up by any idea that this family they must they surely give more than this family this does this and that does that no sir i'm sorry you gave unto the lord so it's not even really my business amen i've had brothers tell me you should know who pays tithes in your church you know don't let them take communion if they're not paying ties you know what what i want you to do is get down before your altar before almighty god and i want you to set your life according to the word on the altar before god not paul's altar not paul's opinion not paul's position but your position before christ because you see in the end i won't be able to force you to anyway then all i've done is alienate you okay when you get down before the lord tonight and he kisses you good night if you've got something to correct correct it don't let it linger on saints there's no use letting the devil lie to you don't let it linger on just take care of it hallelujah so having said that now you might think well brother paul don't have a problem with money no brother paul has a problem with money oh some of you looking real nervous now paul has a problem with money my sister intestify we grew up pretty poor not super poor not dirt poor just above dirt poor first leaf pour i've had an insecurity my whole life when it comes to money and my wife says why don't you buy that for yourself i know you want it i only have 50 in the swallow to mine and that's going to take 40 of them and that ain't worth it an insecurity i'm not talking about i'm some superior deal i have an insecurity saints i have another insecurity if you want to know this morning and that would be that i would stand before god and be responsible for the money you gave him that's right you didn't give it to paul you gave it to him i have an insecurity lord don't let me waste your money pray for me okay pray for me amen reminds me i hope i can just steal this moment from you years ago i i lied to the church i was talking about buying pickups and how i like the certain pickup but i'll never buy one then it got down to be like what was that sister jerry december 28th and the accountant gets a hold of us and says i recommend that you go find something you think you need or want because you are paying an incredible amount of taxes and it was like what do i want i don't need any more tractors i don't need a truck i don't need this i don't need that a pickup but you know the devil got into that somebody in the church looked me in the face and said i know it was our money that bought that pickup now i don't like to talk about money it's really personal to some people to me it's just like a hammer amen some of you if you go out in your garage you'll realize you own five hammers you don't come to church boasting i have five hammers if you want to boast i've got like 40 screwdrivers anybody can beat that brother ivan probably would no but you know saints god blessed me that year and we made 300 000 that year it's a lot of money i've never seen that much money in one spot and a banker says you better go buy something now you got to understand i split that it doesn't all come to me i went and bought a pickup but the devil got into that and this brother become convinced that it was the money of the saints bought paul a pickup and i could not convince him otherwise my complex just got more complex so i'm making that point sometimes the complex for money isn't that the preacher took it all and spent it he might be twisted up in a knot going the other direction and it still affect him popularity that's not one i've ever had to worry about we can just skip right on over that one real quick amen amen so you got to scream for money you got to cry you ought to carry on think so much of money forgets god he's gone that's all there is to it that's right we have to meet expenses and so forth and the next thing when the greatest respects for women now i want you to know the prophet of god had a sense of humor for those that you're going to outrun me and read this way before i get there amen i have the greatest respects for women christian women i think that a good woman is one of oh now look what brother brahms talking about here talking about good gifts blessings he says a good woman is one of the best gifts one of the best blessings one of the best oh amen come on come on saints i want you to see i don't believe the prophet was just speaking words out here i believe this was anointed amen i think a good woman is one of the best gifts that god could give a man outside of salvation i believe that a good woman but i better keep still right there those are reading with me i married a little fat girl up there tell me you guys think i wrote sister jerry here at the church you guys think i've thrown sister jerry under the bus i haven't even started i haven't even got close the prophet of god said i married a little old fat girl imagine how his life felt oh my goodness i married a little fat girl up there i love her with all my heart i never seen one to take her place i say god is god has blessed us brothers can we say amen god has blessed us with one of the best gifts outside of salvation and we ought not let the devil come and put some nice shiny model some shiny this or something shiny that it might have a oh oh i'm not even stepping out of line the prophet of god spoke these words and that little girl she had a good figure how'd he know he's a man because he looked doesn't mean he lost it but they can have a good figure and have an attitude they'd fight a buzzsaw in a barrel yes so i know i like his words right because he's speaking to us as men so i know as long as i stay a christian i'll feel that same way did you catch the depth of what he just declared right there if he was to backslide he was telling you i would be subject to the same spirits of the world out here if i wasn't serving god oh brothers if we have struggles then get close get that proximity to the word get so close to christ you can't see it and the prophet of god even dwelt with that and said hang that cross on your mirror and when it's there you look to that cross oh hallelujah that wasn't too straightforward was it the next thing is popularity when sometimes god can give a man just a little bit a few friends or something and they which we all love friends now don't get me wrong i just love friends but when you get to thinking maybe you've had a little audience of people or something a little above the average begin to think look who i am brother you're on your road right down there right then that's right so it should be that way god knows what's best that's true you have to watch that satan sure throws it out there awful flowery but if we stay just under the blood and you pray that i will now remember i'm i could fall but if you keep praying for me and god keeps loving me i'll make it now that's a recipe for every one of us under this rule let's just keep praying for one another let's keep lifting one another up we'll make it oh but if the devil ever divides us he can just sit back and watch us cannibalize each other come on let's be men and women enough to say lord i don't like that spirit that causes me to criticize i don't like that spirit that causes me not to want to be around them lord humble me that i can love my brothers and sisters amen because he says but if you keep praying for me and god keeps loving me i'll make it hallelujah god will continue to love me then amen hallelujah i love that let's just go back a little reminder i think that a good woman is one of the best gifts that god could give a man outside of salvation brothers sisters we're here it's mother's day we're blessed with the greatest blessings as it would be if time terry some of our young sisters will get married that fall in love get married supposed to fall in love first young ladies i make sure clarify that fall in love get married but you know what comes before that can some of you young ladies young men answer what comes before that no parents you can't cheat the holy ghost the holy ghost comes before them you see god will still be gracious he was to jerry and i but i'm telling you it's a terrible price to pay find the young man find the young woman get it all set in order and then you'll be able to sit here and look at this quote and say that's the truth that's the truth that's the truth hallelujah hallelujah oh sister emmy musicians please come i got several more thoughts here but let me just throw this out to you real quick the summary of the greatest things now i know this is not all-inclusive but salvation eternal life and there's so much encompasses in that healing is one of the greatest things that have been given to us godly wife is one of the greatest things given to us and i'm just going to add to this in this sense young ladies godly husband will be one of the greatest gifts that god ever gives you take the gift that god has given but you know what in this salvation eternal life let's take it and just boil it down to the nutshell the holy ghost will be the single greatest influence in your life seek it pray for it get desperate for it don't sit back and say well i'm waiting for the right preacher no cry out for it cry out for it amen amen revelations 2 21 9 says come hither i'll show you thee the bride the lamb's wife my brother and sister the word clearly shows us this is season this is the season the lamb's wife is on display and then she's walking on the earth today and it's by her testimony that this gospel is being shared this gospel being shared you know reminds me this happened in chile quite a few years ago if i could remember the believer's names the sergio says nazareth would know them lovely sister young man been raised in the message and his parents kept sending him message books him and his wife would throw him in the trash now in chile you have to understand the trash deal is usually about yay so off the ground you put your trash up there to keep the dogs or anything out of it this sister is out there looking at the trash and here's this fresh white book and she's like i wonder what that is yeah i know seems kind of odd that god would let his word get thrown in the trash so that someone else could come i also know a brother that got his off the back of a toilet in a public place sister pulled the book out started reading it took a little step stool out there and climbed up on it looked in the trash and fetched out a couple more and every week when the trash got put out she started just going out there because she knew they'd be there and pulling his message books gives her heart to the lord it's so empowered what god has done for her that she goes one day and knocks on the door [Music] he answers the door she's got a whole handful of message books she's like how could you take something so precious and throw it away [Music] oh i don't know could we say yes lord i need a neighbor like that or would we say oh lord i hope i don't have a neighbor like that every week she went and preached him a sermon on the doorstep of his house until he finally gave his heart back to the lord she said i'm not your mother i'm in a position better than your mother i am your sister in christ and you cannot abandon something of such value such treasure finally his heart started breaking young man's wife was like don't let her bother you like that but she gave her heart to the lord before he did i don't know let's just stand praise the lord today saints god's given us great gifts god's given us great gifts let's not forsake the great gifts that god has given to us amen and the greatest gift of course is our lord jesus christ the holy ghost but my brother and sister were living in a day that satan would say i've got something for you here don't look at that look at this look at this don't look at that do this do that and if you don't think so if we're not subject to shiny things you know how you trap a raccoon any of you know how to trap a raccoon big shiny trap no sir you drill a hole in a stump that big around drive a nail down at an egg and put the lid of a can in the bottom of it and that raccoon will look at that shiny lid and he'll reach in there and when he gets a hols of the lid it balls his is a little paw up and now he can't pull it out but did you know he won't let go of the little shiny things even if it means it's going to kill him did i just describe some of us but god rich in mercy come down and said i outshine all of this let go of your things let go of all this world let go of the distraction let go of it and cling to me oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my we'll save the rest for another time he's got it all in control yeah this struck my heart today as i was just finishing up my thoughts today i was thinking about my family little eva thinking about myself that i dwell with the symptom they call diabetes my heart aching they influence it might be upon her life remember i was talking about that king of peace he came down in the room this morning saints and he said don't worry about it paul i've got it all
