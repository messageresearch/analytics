I keep listening excuse me I keep listening for a different sound I told sister via I wouldn't pick any off the wall ones I hope I just didn't that praise the Lord I'll try to help you get [Music] in thinking of this song because we've been going back and forth lately about the the tuning forks and uh I actually bought a pair and we have them sitting in our on top of our piano as a reminder that um we want our lives to sound according to the sound that the word puts off and to me this song um speaks that loud because I'm listening for a different sound it's not going to sound thank you it's not going to sound it's going to do the if you didn't watch it you put the the little thing on the tuning fork and it changes the tone changes the herts 3 339 and you hit you hit true a and you hit the other one it goes W wah wah W cuz doesn't match so everything around us has that little thing hooked to it the fork everything around us in the world so if we're not careful we sound of the world we sound like we're off so we have to go back to the word we hear about the wars see famine in the land there's questions in the children's eyes trouble in the East again the whole world is shaking there's no sure place to stand and mournful sounds are heard throughout the land oh would I keep listening for a different sound the sound of the city that John saw coming down the sound of the Bride being united with the groom I keep listening I keep listening I keep listening for a different sound how remember the preacher saying son it shall come to pass there will come a generation that will be the last I can't believe I'm standing here see the end of time and the preacher's voice echoing in my mind but I'm not hopeless cuz I keep listening for a different sound the sound of the city that John saw coming down the sound of the Bride being united with the groom hi keep listening I keep listening I keep listening for a different sound oh but I keep listening for a different sound a sound of the city that John saw coming down the sound of the Bride being united with the groom the sound of the chorus Singing Glory to to the lamb I keep listening I keep listening I keep listening for a different sound hey we'll sing that again the world's looking for a savior some trust in chariots some in Horsemen but I trust in the name of the Lord amen this is the word open to us oh but I keep listening for a different sound the sound of the city that John saw coming down the sound of the Bride being united with the groom the sound of the chorus Singing Glory to the lamb I keep listening I keep listening I I keep listening for a different sound amen 1050 set 1057 Come [Music] Away amen the banquet is prepared before you it's all set and as a true gentleman he'll pull the chair back as you sit but you have to come to the table there's there's a table dress in linen the banquet is prepared a host of angels gathered for the celebration there the bride is almost ready in spotless wide Ray a hush Falls over heaven as a groom begins to say come away my love come away my love I have waited for this day when I could give to you my name eternity awaits us come away my love I have loved you from creation long before you came to me I've carried that love with me all the way to Calvary though it wasn't over when they laid me in the Tomb I Pro my love would never die I rose again for you come away my love come away my love I have waited for this day and I could give to you my name eternity awaits us come [Laughter] away my love come [Music] away my love brother Paul Come Away my love I have waited for this day when I could give to you my name eternity he awaits us come away my love amen aren't you glad you've received the invitation hallelujah how precious that is to be identified Amen to be called by the word his bride now my brother and sister it all depends on how you want to look at the word of God you either are already bride and if you look at it at a slightly uh restricted view you're going to be amen but I say today we are the Bride of Jesus Christ clearly identified in the word amen and he said his wife hath made herself ready and aren't you glad we have that time the opportunity to to prepare ourselves and uh to come amen I would just like to um just a couple little things here real quick uh Lord willing uh brother Craig Bo and his family will be with us on Wednesday September the 4th and also Sunday September the 8th uh so I say Lord willing brother Craig has prayed about it and uh has accepted the invitation and uh so we're going to uh just kind of sponsor them a little bit of a break and that Sunday September the 8th we will have a fellowship and um so we haven't had one for a little while uh but um it will be a good time and brother Craig and his wife sister Anna and the family are all excited to come uh visit us that will be right after uh brother Craig's going to be preaching up in North Idaho I think it's a faragate state park they're going to have some meetings right there at the end of the month uh and uh then they're going to come down and visit us so uh pray about that lift him up amen Lord would just give him the right words and I I'd heard some rumor about brother Adam's getting old um anyway we just want to say God bless you brother Adam and uh also uh something I I guess just been a little preoccupied this this last little while but brother Sergey and sister ulia celebrated an anniversary so pray praise the Lord amen hallelujah hallelujah and I believe little Sammy celebrated a birthday and declan's not here so um they are always that kind of tied together uh Dean's birthday yeah it's coming up but always when I think of one I I think of the other as the the two musketeers uh they they've left the other one somewhere else but uh I'm sure before the Lord terries they'll find him amen so uh just want to remember those things uh uh the blessings that God has given us amen we realize my brother and sister that that these are are blessings that God has poured out upon us it's not to be uh looked at um you know I wouldn't mind your prayers I hurt my leg yesterday and um uh it throbbed all night long and it caused me this morning to realize what a blessing it is to get a good night's sleep and um you know so if you don't have anything else to pray for you can pray for my leg it's swole up a little bit and uh whatnot we want to remember Sister Sophie has traveled to Africa and so we want travel mercies in a blessed time for her just to enjoy that and uh time there amen let's just stand as we go into the word thank you brother Chris I really enjoyed the song service it kind of fit with uh a lot of things um that we have been thinking on uh I have to admit I have uh uh just had a a lot of Mind battle in the last while here but the Lord just gave me a lovely little breakthrough it wasn't it wasn't uh in the way you'd normally think a breakthrough would come but um you know um just through the study of Sarah and she speaks out those words saying you know will I have pleasure with my Lord again and looking back to the Natural Things of Life The Joy of Life a married couple and she wants to know are you're saying I can go back to that position and something just really reached out of the word to me and said that's what's been troubling you Paul you've actually kind of lost that Joy a little bit it's kind of circumstances of stripped that away and and you know I believe you know very much so that that the word of God knows our very need for the day we live in and um I I just was like L Lord I Want My Joy with my Lord I I want that pleasure to serve you and um you know it's just to me a miracle I just like Suddenly It's like the barriers that had been holding me back just vaporized and suddenly you're just like thank you Lord uh we we can right here today Saints have pleasure in our Lord amen the cares of Life are strong but they're going to still be there we don't have to remain subject to them we don't have to let that rule our life all of the financial things we would suffer health things we' suffer everything's going to still be there but that does not have to stop us from having having pleasure in our Lord Jesus Christ amen so I would just like to turn and this scripture we we spoke last Sunday make a little more emphasis uh 2 Corinthians the 10th chapter veres 3-5 I want to last week we we spoke on uh the the uh Jeremiah 50 and in verse 25 there it says the Lord hath opened his Armory and hath brought the forth the weapon of his indignation and um I just want to just come here in 2 Corinthians 10 3-5 and we're going to take this from being God's Armory to the bride's Arsenal and that's what we'll title it today because you see everything that our lord Jesus went through and we'll touch on this probably again but everything our lord Jesus went through he went through for our sake he did not need to go through it for his sake even though the word says that he learned obedience by suffering now my brother and sister did our Lord Jesus Christ need to or was it for a greater purpose was he Christ in the flesh not subject was there some kind of rebellion in him was there something that uh uh God In the Flesh needed perfecting you see we have to realize or catch the very fact that that he went through that for our sake amen less we would think that there was some imperfection for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal and often times times we would look at that and our mind immediately says right this is not the bow the spear this is not uh the the sword this is not but I also want you to look at it from this point of view for the weapons of our Warfare are not this carnal flesh this flesh is not going to take care of or conquer it is not us but Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought boy I tell you what I I I'm still working on that amen bringing captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ Heavenly Father we just ask you to bless this time together Lord bless these precious Saints father as we uh go through life father we celebrate birthdays and anniversaries Lord we celebrate milestones in our lives and how quickly the time passes how quickly the years evaporate but father we know that we're not moving into old age we're moving into eternity and father let us have a joy in our heart a song in our lips father as we give praise to you for the days that you give us Lord for the victories that we have won the things that we have overcome now father we make a commitment today Father to let your word touch Our Lives Lord let it have such an impact that we leave here today A changed people Lord one filled with more joy more Victory more Faith Lord more uh of everything every virtue father that you've given us let it be a increased and abounding today we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated now I want to just go back to Jeremiah 5 for just a moment as we would look at this just as a reference the sound of battle is in the land and of great destruction and we are living in such a time that even historians are declaring that it is just as great of chaotic time has ever been on the earth the equivalent of the Cold War from Years Gone by all of these things that are happening uh the spies are in the land some positive some negative and we're looking at alliances made that you would say why would that Alliance be made but we realize that it's part of scripture being fulfilled and as we'll see that uh my brother and sister that that uh you look back in history just to give you an example China and Russia have never been friends and yet today they are signing alliances they're talking about Mutual support uh in the time of warfare they're talking about supplying things to one another and so you see that the maturity of time has come and brought us to a place that truly the sound of battle is in the land and there is definitely a great destruction and uh we would move forward here today to Matthew 4 and we'll look at this verses 1-10 because we're looking that man has always uh experienced some form of warfare there's always been starting with Cain and Abel there's always been uh someone trying to take the life of another and we look at our lord Jesus here in Matthew 4 in the first verse he says uh uh Jesus was led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness and there was a purpose that he was being led to the Wilderness it wasn't for just a nice hike but he was led there to be tempted of the devil now this is God setting a stage my brother and sister and you can look at this and realize today that just as our lord Jesus was led into the wilderness Wilderness to be tempted so God has allowed you to be living here in leoda in this time he allowed it he didn't force it upon you he allowed it because our tempting and our test must come also we do not get a free pass that's why this cannot be your mother's religion or your daddy's religion or grandma or Grandpa's religion it's got to be your religion it's got to be your experience and so God's going to allow you to be led into to the Wilderness that is called leoa and it's here in this time my brother and sister now we we don't want to get confused about a lot of these things we'll be preaching at times about the bride Age and and these things but as we are coming my brother and sister into Perfection God is still knocking the dross out of you and I and I don't know about you but I have some dross that I acknowledge I not need knocked out of me there's things in my life that I stop and say Lord is that still there I thought I'd dealt with that years ago but yet it's rared its head up again amen and so when he had fasted 40 days and 40 night he was afterward uh hungered and when the tempter came to him and said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread and he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and then the devil taking him up into the holy city and setting him on the Pinnacle of the temple and saith unto him if thou be Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time Thou shalt Dash thy foot against a stone Jesus said unto him it is written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God again the devil taketh him up into exceeding High mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and saith unto him all these things will I give thee see here's the foundation of the God of this evil age right he he never got rebuked for you have no right to promise these things there was no rebuke to that he had control but my brother and sister his control praise God we know is only temporary amen but it's there he says I shows him and all all these things give you if thou will fall down and worship me then said Jesus unto him get thee hint Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve now we look at this great hour of Temptation This great time when Jesus himself uh could have actually used a number of things you see he could have fallen back Beyond it is written he did not need to say it is written because he was the word and and so as the word he could have said Satan I bind thee and Satan would have been bound but you see for your sake and for my sake he allowed these things to continue on he gives Satan his opportunity and in that opportunity God was proving a point that is so of Great Value to you and I today it is something that is so important but you know sometimes I think In the Heat of the battle we kind of forget that we've been given this weapon and this is here in the brides Arsenal in the day that we live in today uh this has been given to us could someone say Amen thank you Lord this has been given to us this is no longer we must go and ask for it or desire a way to use it it has been given in a fullness to you and I now my brother and sister I I I hope you don't mind today this is probably going to be about an eight or 10 part uh uh deal but but I decided I I I'm not going to hurry through it I I'm just going to go and we'll just preach whatever part it comes and and you guys may or may not be happy to get out early or maybe you won't get out early who knows but as you look at this and we must realize uh uh in this hour of great Temptation Jesus could have just simply bound Satan he had that authority to have bound him amen and we look at this that that um he was laying a foundation for us he knew what we would encounter in our life he knew every struggle if the Lord would come today he could tell you everything from your past that you might have even forgotten and he can tell you what today would be and he could tell you what your tomorrow's will also be but he chose this pattern of letting us live it out he chose this pattern of not uh causing us uh uh to either relax oh he's got it covered but for us to pursue the word amen to pursue the life to uh present ourselves as the word says a Living Sacrifice to our Lord Jesus Christ and uh so it's there if if Jesus had just simply bound Satan and said you know I'm ignoring you and and uh we would have to come uh my brother and sister and according to the word as we know it we would not be able to replicate that in the fashion that our lord Jesus would have that God would have bound Satan we would not have been able to replicate that in that exact fashion but God through his word has come and set in place something that you and I can follow and every single day we can stand upon the word of God in the hour we live in in the struggle that we're in and we can declare it is WR written amen that is something that we ought to maybe hold on to a little closer than we have in the past cuz I I'm just going to make an assumption today and I hope you don't mind but I don't think that you're much different than I am and sometimes in the midst of our battle we start thinking about wo is me wo is this situation what am I going to do how can I do this what will take place and we get so focused in that when God actually wanted you and I to come to the same place that our Lord Jesus was and look Satan in the face and just say it is written amen my name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life it is written amen I'm not here depending on your opinion Satan of what my life is and who I am but it is written and I stand in that position and I will be unmoved from that position amen amen so he's setting in place something we can use every single day now if we'll put that in the Forefront of our everyday life we'll be able to stand in the storms of life and be able to say you know what the word says the word says it is written and I believe this message of the hour that God sent to us he used a prophet he ordained it he Vindicated it and he brought it back and laid it before us and even more so than that he gave you Revelation to understand the word that was spoken because if everyone understood the word that was spoken my brother and sister the message would be the greatest collection of people in the world today but they can't believe it they can't understand it they don't comprehend it so therefore they put it to the side and say well this just can't be we we are more established we have more people we have more but the word is right there in front of them but they can't understand the word amen just as it was everyone on the face of of the Earth in Jesus day should have been able to say it is written but they rejected it he became be elub and he became a soothsayer he become you know all these other things that they labeled him with because God has Reserve that for a select group of people and we don't say that to be boastful but we say that with Thanksgiving in our hearts Lord thank you for your grace that you opened our eyes and opened our ears amen and the word the point being the word should be the point of our spear it should be the point of our thoughts it should be the point of our reaction and our voice it should be the point of everything of our life now brother brandom says in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now remember this that I make this quotation the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere any time any place on any condition amen let me repeat that again any condition there's not a condition on this Earth my brother and sister that the word will not defeat this is not us going raw raw raw This Is Us believing the word and the word is there that Satan cannot overpower it it cannot the only way he can take it away from us is if we give him the key now think about a key I'm going to go after church here I'm going to go around the parking lot cuz I want to select a really nice car I'm going to look at your cars and I'm going to take my key and I'm going to just put it in the the door of your car and unlock it no we have the key my brother and sister and the only way it can be unlocked is for us as Sons and Daughters of God to give our key to the devil amen otherwise there's no way for the devil to open the door imagine if there was only one key on the face of the Earth you might as well not have a lock because anybody could just walk up to your car or your house Amen to those of you that it would apply your gun safe there would be no be no need for a key the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere any time any place on any condition the word of God Alone it is written will defeat Satan no matter who he is what form he comes in where he's at it will defeat Satan now that is truth the written word of God so this is not a special Revelation my brother and sister that's given that will unlock the door once you have special revelation amen so some man studying some man working some man doing no my brother and sister well the Revelation that God has given to you the whole key to it all God Gave You amen no man preached it no man revealed it no man did this it was God God used men but it was God who give you the key to unlock it all and when you caught the revelation of baptism that was God giving it to you when he gave you the revelation of certain seed it was God giving it to you the marriage and divorce just go down the list of all these things it wasn't man that gave it it was God himself giving directly to you the key of the word to open it in your life to bless you and defend you now John 1 and we all know John 1 but we're going to go into that in the beginning was the word amen now we come down here to verse 11 where I want to just kind of keep this concise and he he came into his own and his own now this is by race and Creed my brother and sister in a sense he came into his own and his own received him not but as many as received him can someone say Amen but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of Flesh nor the will of man but of God and the word oh I love this the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now we're going to look at this my brother for just a second here he was given uh we have been given the power to become this is not of works this is not we were worthy we were smart enough what ever now what is this word become there's lots of definitions and I get to Cherry pick my own because I'm preaching but it ties in appointed we have been given power because we were appointed we're appointed as sons of God and Daughters of God that also connects into predestinated there is part of the appointment now appointed to be Abraham's spiritual seed can someone say thank you Lord that we Are Spiritual seed today amen that we were in Christ from before the foundation of the world that is something should always stir our hearts shouldn't become old and and just a common phrase to us but to know that we were appointed of God to become Sons and Daughters of God before there was a foundation of this very world and we were appointed to hear the word without that being appointed you say brother Paul we know this that's right I'm just here to stir up your pure Minds in remembrance today amen just to Stir It Up that you won't get LED astray by thoughts of this world and and the the cares and the disappointments and all the little things that Satan is so good at doing to us amen so he here it is you were appointed to hear the word now when you think about that my brother and sister I I think you know that that we want to be careful about drawing out too much of each individual story but I I know most of you well enough to know that that how God chose to appoint the word was settled long ago but the actual manifestation of him appointing or revealing or exposing the word in you is such a unique it's a lovely story and I I think that it Bears a reminder to each and every one of us how that we would come because you will see the type and the anti-type you will see uh some would say I've always been in church but not everyone that was in church with you is still here amen and some would been out steeped in sin in the world today caught up in all of the things of the world today and sitting in the same environment but one day God exposes the light on a seed that before the foundation of the world he placed in you and you tell me how he did that well I heard the word preached a lot of people heard the word preached something in me just believed how cuz you were born in sin and shaped in iniquity come into this world speaking lies how did it settle on you because God himself had you in his family album you were there have always been there he knows you by name he knows you by your heart's cry he knows you in every facet of your Humanity he knows you and he placed that word and he put something in you that when you heard the word you were able to act upon it amen I I I can think of there's sometimes very funny stories and I won't bring them out I would like to but it's not always nice and I'm trying to break the Habit amen but I'm telling you my brother and sisters some of the experience that we have it just causes us to step back in Wonder of how it is that we receive the word how it is that we come to a place and a time I can share with you examples of a man sitting on a bar seat a brother sitting on a bar stool and some somebody there in their Town very prominent message church and somebody in the bar talking about these people and this man rars up and he just unloads on these guys about they're wrong they don't know you're just repeating gossip and you're just doing that and they're all shocked and they were like wow we didn't know you cared that much about it and he stopped and thought I didn't know I cared that much about it but you see something from maybe a troubled childhood in the midst of a current church or a past church I mean and he he's there and and he's got reasons the reason I don't believe but then he realized you know what I believe in enough to sit and blast my very best friends that they don't know what they're talking about that this is truth this is life God is real this message is real and those people are holy people amen and then his body obeyed his confession and he found himself in church serving God again and now today is a blessed man but you see my brother and sister there's got to be something that causes you to act on the word many hear the word yeah many have heard the word and many have walked away from the word that they heard but there's those that are going to act on the word those that are going to say Amen to the word now whether you say Amen am men out loud or in your heart I I believe that's somewhat irrelevant I would encourage you every once in a while just test your vocal cords and say Amen out loud might shock you to hear your own voice confessing the word but it'd be good for you amen so to say Amen to the word don't you just love how the prophet brought this he says when people say amen to the word it's like go get them sick them Hallelujah who wants to sick the word on the devil today amen can we get an amen just to sick the word on the devil today Hallelujah don't want to sit back and be a bystander we want the devil driven out amen we want him to be I tell you years ago we had this great big dog named Cody and it was so amazing you know I at the time would be frustrated with Cody because we would have a car driving the driveway and and and people wouldn't even get out of their car because Cody would run up to their car and here's their door and Cody's looking in their car and people would just sit there with a look on their face but you know I appreciate it as life went on unfortunately it took me a little too long sister Jerry says I never love a dog until it's dead but you know I did recognize that Cody had something special about him because people just didn't get out of their car and roam around your place because Cody was there to greet them now my brother and sister our little dog teddy he can run out and he can Yip and Yip and Yip and Yip and it won't matter no one's really afraid of Teddy so it all depends on how you want to present your view of the Gospel concerning the devil amen you can be the little guy who stands there all muscular if you guys ever noticed Teddy's got these just biceps on his little legs there you know big chest but he's a stall amen Cody on the other hand years ago would walk out there people climb back in their car now what are we going to be to the devil Y come on it's it's okay to have a little Joy amen or do you want to be one that in the eyes of the Devil comes out there and says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and you can't convince me any different the devil would come and say well you got to be baptized in this fashion in that fashion and and you know this is and because there's there's way more of us baptized like this then there are a view you have a misconception of the word but God never recorded once my brother and sister their baptism in scripture not once so it's there when we say Amen to the word we unlock the prophet says we unlock the word in our life and it starts to take effect so you see all of these things that we have been appointed to not one of them did we do it not one of those did we bring it amen it's not really you it's Christ in you and as we sit here today with Christ in us we cannot sit here today Saints I hope I'm not speaking too harshly but we cannot sit here today if Christ is in us and not change we cannot sit here and see the word the open word and not respond to it there is something inside the Bride of Jesus Christ she has to say say Amen to the word she has to open up and say I receive this and when you receive this in the right Spirit the right attitude the prophet of God says it has to change you I believe that amen so it's Christ in you amen and Christ coming out of you amen it's not just I collected up so much of the Holy Spirit I can say I've got the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit has to flow through you amen flow through me holy spirit amen because when you have any body of water and you Dam it up the prophet God speaks about this you Dam it up it becomes stagnant you tell me that if there's a Christian says I'm filled with the Holy Ghost but it's not coming out of him what does the holy ghost look like when it's stagnant the Holy Spirit cannot be stagnant it's God himself amen that would be the position of saying well I've heard God he spoke he said this he said that I don't see anything new that's stale I'm going to leave it no my brother and sister God can't be stale and he only becomes stale in our life when we don't let it flow through US amen when we have barely enough of the Holy Spirit to keep us living there's no way my brother and sister that you're going to have it flowing out of you so when you come to the place that it flows into you and doesn't flow out you are going to end up in a stagnant relationship with the Lord and probably everyone around you you see people I I'm always surprised that people that not not everybody but some people have a push back uh uh in the message about uh manifested Sons and Daughters of God now if you go on the internet and you'll look at this they will actually talked about the manifested Sons and Daughters of God as though that's some kind of evil messed up thing but it shows you how uh um lacking they are in Revelation because if Christ is in you it's got to make itself known yeah amen there is no such thing as a hidden Christian there will be something that manifests out of you amen because the word manifested is something on display or an Evidence if we are a Christian and there's no evidence as brother brandham talks about the court trial there's no evidence to convict us of being a Christian then are we really a Christian can somebody answer that for me no if there's no evidence to convict you of being a Christian then you're not a Christian is that blunt needs to be blunt amen we are not Christians in name only amen we are Christians by The Life of Christ manifested through US amen now when we come to that place my brother and sister there has to be something that's expressing the authority of the word over our life that's why we have so many people today and I I'm not saying this judgmental but we have so many people today that very very little of their life is an Evidence of Christ being present and then they tell you that the Lord spoke to me and gave me this Revelation the internet's clear full of it God come to me last night and said this and this is going to happen but there's nothing there to give evidence that Christ is present now I know I know he used a donkey once but I think you will find out that that donkey was a consecrated donkey he was a espcially chosen donkey they didn't just grab any wood in the Corell that one was chosen of God because that donkey actually had an ear to hear and an eye to see you imagine the donkey's mind I we all have our thoughts of what probably donkeys would be thinking I know if the donkey was like me he would be only concerned with his next meal but God had a special donkey and it's sees the angel and it had more sense chosen now if God can choose donkeys surely we can recognize how incredible God's choosing is for us how that we could of all the people on the Earth today come to a position to recognize that God has chosen us now my brother and sister when we express the authority of the word over our life now this will be a little straightforward forgive me but this is just what we're going to speak amen when we have people my brother and sister that will willfully set the word to the side they are actually saying I do not give the word authority over my life come on that's pretty blunt we find reasons we have what we call excuses now you don't need to lift your hands but I do believe if you would disagree with me go ahead and lift your hand but we have excuses we got a lot of reasons why we didn't well why don't we come up with some reasons why we did amen I followed the word why because the word has dominion over my life I am subjected to the word I I am in subjection the word is going to rule my life and and when we do we're telling the world that the word has authority over us people would say well couldn't you just do this or settle for this my brother and sister when you're under Authority amen as it is you know uh when that Centurion comes to Jesus and he says look I'm a man under Authority and when I say come they come when I say go they go how about what we would come and submit ourselves so much to the word of God that when the word says come we come and when the word says go we go instead of coming and offering our reason why we can't why don't we simply say Lord I'm here I submit myself I want to see the word manifested in me amen now look at this brother brandham talks about this a little bit when they're talking about the Trinity uh and and here it is a a person void of expression is not really alive you see if a person is a person he has personality and so it it must be my brother and sister that when we are void of expression I have what I consider to be a dear friend I went to school with him forever High School Farms out Beyond us there trying to witness to this this man this friend and he told me Paul he goes maybe maybe you don't feel this way but for me uh uh religion is a very deeply personal private thing not to be shared or talked about and it struck me as much as I like this man his name is Paul also that's not why I like him but you see how Satan had come and come up and put the barrier before him that we don't talk about it don't talk about my soul I don't talk about my sin I'm a good person I keep it very private well I'm here my brother and sister according to the word we're supposed to share our faults I've got time if you guys want to share we can laugh about that right but you realize in the course of conversation Fellowship Etc we do share our faults we do share I need prayer I have sickness I have this weakness I have this troubles I have and and it comes out sooner or later we end up being transparent even if we don't think we are so when the word has authority over our life we then start to express what has authority over us my brother and sister now when we are in that we have a personality we are Sons and Daughters of God we are not just some mechanical thing but we are Sons and Daughters of God so I want to ask you what personality are we going to manifest we will manifest the personality of the word by the Revelation which you have you say I know brothers so and so sisters so and so they're a person of great faith why are they a person of great faith because they're exercising it yeah you don't exercise your faith you end up with arms this size right here you exercise your faith and Faith starts to be manifested to you and it becomes something by the nature I want you to see how much God intertwined our very human nature is that when we in the natural we we start to exercise and we start to do and and pretty soon it becomes manifest that we can uh you know climb the mountain or run the mile or do whatever lift this weights it it it manifest it you can't do all of that without a manifestation and when we consume the word my brother and sister and eat the word we will find that it will be manifested in us when we're receiving the word the word starts to show on the outside of us and I'm sorry but I take this from something brother Donnie Reagan preached many years ago and it might not be perfect in its wording but the thought will be and he says there's people that sit on their couch and eat Cheetos and drink diet Pepsi all the time and then come to church and say brother Donnie I don't feel good pray for me brother Donnie says you if you would exercise and eat right you wouldn't feel like you feel you wouldn't be in that condition so what you need to do is change your diet Amen brother Adam preaches that to me all the time brother Paul change your diet quit eating that Sugar amen and I think brother Adam you sound like my wife but anyway um but you see my brother and sister what is happening is when the word comes in you cannot help but have the word come out it will come out it will manifest itself and it's there that the word my brother and sister now going back to the title the bride's Arsenal the prophet of God tells us that the word is the very defense first line of defense that we have as Sons and Daughters of God it was the first line that Jesus went to he went right to the word and he had consumed the word because he was the word but you and I consumed the word we become the word and the first thing that comes out of us when we have consumed the word is the word amen we don't have to go and get an opinion of a psychologist we don't have to go over here and get an opinion of a medical doctor we got to go over here and get a opinion of a PhD and a doctor of theology my brother and sister we consume the word and the word is the very first thing that comes out of us in a time of great need amen you will be there a time of desperation you will be there and the very first thing that will come out of you will be the word because that's what God has instilled in you he's placed the word at the highest level of your life and that is the first thing that comes out amen God being misunderstood that's the reason that people cannot believe in miracles today because they don't have anything in them to believe with right my they've got to have something in there to believe with when the spirit of God is in a man he'll say Amen to every word of God and every miracle of God but as my mother used to say you can't get blood from a tum because there's no blood in it and that's the same way you can't get belief out of an unbeliever because there's nothing there to believe with my brother brother and sister I was just listening I I I won't say who and what but I was just listening to a testimony of a brother talking about when he was quite young and there was an accident right in front of their Church a car had pulled out in front of a truck or a truck had pulled out in front of a car I don't remember the whole side of the car was smashed in and the wife was okay and the children were okay but the man in the car was slumped over the seat and the wife was holding his neck holding his head and she's screaming one continuous scream and they ran over there and a brother come to one side of the car oh let me put this in the pastor was preaching an anointed service and then said I think that's enough we'll stop right here and dismissed and they're outside now and this accident takes place the woman screaming one brother reaches in past her lays his hand on the chest there is so heartbeat there's no breath starts praying NE brother runs over there leans over him lays his hand on her and he's praying this brother went to the other side of the car him and another brother and the one brother had took the pulse and said there's no pulse the wife was a nurse and she checked the pulse and she's screaming he's dead he's dead he's dead and the whole church crossed the street surrounded the car started praying one brother testifies after this is all over he said by God's grace I felt virtue of life pass by me they're there hunched over reaching in praying for him and he said I felt it pass by me and all of a sudden the man sets [Music] up and starts to breathe oh multitude of witnesses no heartbeat no bre now my brother and sister we can come and we can say that that he was just knocked unconscious but it was interesting you said at that point I believe it was the the yeah the the truck the truck driver is walking around in circles in the street cursing I've killed him blank blank language I've killed him I killed him I killed him and he said but that one there was not able to overcome Faith could not change the wall of faith that had come around this man and as it was the brother still possesses the the U newspaper clipping where the newspaper acknowledged miraculous recovery and the man was a doctor miraculous recovery so many injuries should have died from his injuries but he did if they' have stood back and said well I guess that's God's will don't know what don't know why but but they were Believers and we believe in life we believe in life at the spiritual level we believe in life at the natural level we believe in life because we serve a living God we don't serve a God that just sits back and says well I can't do nothing about this we serve a God that can be moved by our prayer be moved by our need be moved in desperation be moved in our seeking of the word amen we have that kind of God that we serve amen you can't get belief out of an unbeliever but I'll tell you what you put Believers together and there can be so much belief in the word of God that it will bring life back to a man bring life back to those spiritually dead can bring it back we should not be bound by that circumstance or that be a hindrance an to us of we can't because of this we can't because of that we should be able to stand and say because the word says the word says it's going to happen because the word says I believe the word and I have this Arsenal that God has given to me and the word is the first and foremost of the Arsenal I have God said it the prophet of God puts it this way he said that it is there in time tested Memorials of God he says that the word uh being here and being still being uh um how am I I'm going to lose my thought the word still being here still being effective a Vindication of the word proves it's a - tested Memorial that God put the word here and put it down and says when you have doubts when you have fears when you have things in your life look to the word there's the memorial that you need to look to the word word he uses that example Brother David Nash preached it here in the church one time that as they crossed over Jordan there in the dry bed of Jordan they picked up a rock and carried it out and they built a memorial that has stood the test of time that their children would say Daddy what is this Memorial about this Memorial is about the time that God came on the scene for us and it is left here to stir our remembrance I'm telling you my brother and sister we are here today with a Time tested Memorial that when we have fears and doubts and we feel weak and we feel incapable we can look back to this word and say there's the proof my God is real he's on the scene he's living hallelujah hallelujah amen and if there's nothing to believe with no wonder they don't have an answer to Satan question no wonder they have no moral compass they have no security no way to respond when Satan says I'll give you all of this if you'll Bow Down and Worship me because they've got nothing to answer with we see children adults bowing because they've got no answer to Satan but we are not those people we are Sons and Daughters of God and the same God that come on the scene amen for you and I if we would just stir up our Pure Minds we remember the times that God has moved in our midst moved in our families when we were almost in the near catastrophic accident when these things have happened when it seemed like nothing could help nothing could change God come and changed it can we say Amen to that today we have our own time tested Memorials of our God is on the scene and he's living today amen we don't have to go look back to some day in the past amen oh hallelujah oh in the hour of Temptation when they have no answer this bride of Christ in this hour my brother and sister we have an answer oh Hallelujah it is written amen it is written if I don't feel like it if I don't see it if I feel isolated it doesn't matter it is written amen and I believe the written word of God hallelujah oh the hour of Temptation we must have Christ the word you know as I was talking there I'll get myself manifested sons of God you know expression now look at this my brother and sister getting lost in my own notes we have an agreement but you know agreement often times is based on opinion and feelings I don't know who to embarrass I guess I'll embarrass myself myself that's not a good example to use myself oh well how often has our opinion changed how often has your emotions changed can we count on them but did you know those are in part of the mixture that God uses of us believing the word us living the word us saying Amen to the word there's an opinion that is something that's closely held and important maybe only to you Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever if no one else agrees my opinion is yes he is the same yesterday today forever emotion when I hear the preaching of the word and I remember stirs my mind to remember things I I don't want to bring this to to to just myself but many years ago the highway doesn't even resemble itself but many years ago me as a backsliding kid in a pickup that slid off a highway held from falling to a several hundred foot Ravine by one rock I cannot help when I think about that but have emotion God cared enough for me to put that one ordained Rock brother Trevor the rock that was called to wedge itself against a tire to spare my life they hooked a chain on that pickup and they moved it not even an inch in the rock fell off in the canyon I tell you that rock was supernaturally set right there for me and I can remember as a boxid young man I can remember being so profoundly affected I thought oh my goodness Lord forgive me now I'm sad to say it didn't last I slid right back to where I was at but I'll tell you one thing I know the memory of what God did for me has never left he was on the scene my God was there for me can you say amen hallelujah okay calling Jesus on the scene I want to hurry up and Hallelujah notice let us remember he also created our bodies and won't our bodies have to obey him amen you surrender uh your thoughts to him Surrender Your Life to him Surrender Your Faith to him and watch that body obey what he says if you're a drunkard and you can't quit drinking surrender that life to him and watch you'll drink no more if you're a habitual smoker and tried to give it up and can't do it Just Surrender that to him and Watch What Happens he'll make that body come back in subjection to to the word yes sir but you've got to surrender it to him you've got to believe him he made our bodies they obey he uh he made our bodies they obey his will also do you believe that amen we'll agree with them if you're a Christian you have to you say he makes our bodies obey oh I believe we have jurisdiction over that then you're not fully surrendered well I I have I I I'm I'm telling you Saints I want to drive this point home I have dealt with Believers that when you'd be talking to them they come to you about a situation and when you're talking to them they remind you but we have free moral agency what do you mean by that you have the privilege to go like you have been and you're coming because your life is disintegrating or you also have free moral agency just say I Surrender how are we going to look at free moral agency is it is it our Avenue is it our our way is it our excuse or is it a fact that God allows us and still loves us when we do make a mistake for you're not your own you are dead you yourself are dead and your life is hid in God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost now how are you going to get away from that I think we need a Revival Our Lives are dead we are dead our own thoughts you think pure thoughts them old worldly thoughts that lead you off you're dead to that and your life is hid in God through Christ sealed by the Holy Spirit what a position what a secure oh my how long till the next Revival until the day of your Redemption my we don't need to be up and down Christians in andout Christians we don't need to be I was a victorious you know on fire and now I'm cold my brother and sister we need to settle in and say you know what this God that I serve the one I've given my life to amen he has given me the very same words and anointing that Jesus spoke on that day it is written forget this I I made a mistake and I guess I don't care no forget this my brother and sister we belong to Christ and he wants to let us oh my words are jumbling in my brain amen he wants us to come and say Here I Am Here I Am Without One Plea oh just Lord I just Lord I I don't I don't want to have my own thoughts anymore I don't want to be my own de I don't want to have my little temper I don't want to have my little actions that I have I don't want to push back against mom or dad I don't want to push back against this or push back against that I want to be submitted to the word boy how it changes not till the next Revival until the day of your redemptions Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed into the day of your Redemption what is secure feeling knowing and watching the Holy Spirit change your nature from a vile person then we know we've passed from death and the life we see the Holy Spirit living in us his life see that's a beauty of it my brother and sister I hope this is not too Direct seems like people brother Brown talks about it in the sermon why people are so tossed about but we are right here today people saying I don't know if I have the Holy Spirit I felt like I had it last Sunday I don't know if I have it no now my brother and sister what you've got to do is stop and say am I the same person that I was is my desire do i s sin and glory in it or the minute I say something wrong there something inside of me oh Lord forgive me start examining your life your reactions your actions because you see to come to the place we see Christ Living in us there's the place we're moving towards not our attendance not whether we can quote the message but Christ Living in Us and how do you exercise Faith muscles you don't do that my brother and sister sitting on the couch so to speak but exercise those Faith muscles that you can stand and when you're faced with the greatest trials and Satan speaking to you trying to lure you away you'll be able to be anointed to say it is written those won't just be words it will be the very Life of Christ in you speaking as Christ spoke my brother and sister this is part of the message this is the life that we come not to hold to Orthodoxy you know the message has its own Orthodoxy mhm but the prophet of God himself said Christ is moving on yeah he made a corner yes they didn't amen so we cannot take Orthodoxy in the human element and say this is it and you know I want to throw this spinner at you here what did the prophet mean when he said read between the lines come on we can interpret a lot of different ways I'm going to let you interpret it for yourself but when it comes to reading between the lines not it's not you and I figuring out what the prophet was trying to say it's in between the lines that the Holy Spirit speaks to you there's the place between the lines that it's you and Christ and the word amen that's where it is it's not us to insert print between the lines but it's the space and time for him to speak to us and we understand then what the word is speaking to the bride can I read one more quote at this point I'm only two minutes late amen now you see very end of his ministry the day that brother brandham preached this I would have been four years old is that right four years old I don't know what that means I just had to share it just a few days before Prophet goes off the scene he's preaching leadership and he says this Jesus alone can lead you to that eternal life there's no church no denomination no preacher no priest no nothing else can lead you to it you must be led by him the only one that can lead you could you imagine him leading you out of his word which that's him and if he is the word and you're a part of him won't you be part of the word yes amen are we part of the word amen this is the beauty of this my brother and sister we don't become just followers we become the word oh Hallelujah the word of God wants to pour the Waters of Salvation uh upon um today to identify him today like the apostles identified him like Luther like Wesley like in the people in the days identified him this another age it's the word the word said these things that we're seeing taking place now is predicted to take place in this hour so accept Jesus Christ and let him lead you to eternal life amen there's the confidence that we have that I can look at this and say it is written amen we have no other goal but the word leading us into eternal life not following a man not following a church not following a movement following the word now as we were doing I'm going to close on that sister VI if you would come please musicians you look at this my brother and sister this is just the start of the bride's Arsenal because you see if we don't have the word it won't matter all the other qualities that we might have we have to have the word and so part one the bride's Arsenal aren't you glad you know the old phrase sorry goes way back to whatever the bride's loaded for bear she's got everything she needs she's she's got you know just all kinds of weapons she's got all kinds of things and and she just walks with confidence and and She's Not Afraid how many of you are afraid of the dark nobody's Afraid of the Dark good [Laughter] good now I ask this is just very carnal motivated question if we're afraid of the dark do we feel better if we have a weapon I'm telling you you feel much better I can tell you my brother and sister as we close this out what it is and how it feels many years ago hunting with a friend very close to Hell's Canyon we were elk hunting and we would hunt till it was dark and then walk back to camp and we would cook our food in the dark and usually it was later than we wanted before we went to bed but we'd be there and I remember one night I'm laying there and uh I'm like you know I I feel comfortable I've got a I've got a pistol um anything would come around hope this isn't too personal but I woke up and I thought I I need to go outside and hide behind a tree and about that time we decided it had to be m M lion but out outside of our camp right there was this and with a gun I still didn't feel secure but I had to use the restroom and I thought it just passed by our camp it's fine and about that time this long scream Screech and I'm like go back to sleep the Lord spoke to me did I not say I am your Sanctuary I am your protection your Refuge in the time of need I hope you guys don't mind a little humor I got up put my boots on unzipped the tent stepped out Amazing Grace the little Hollow we were camped in echoed and I was Lord I believe every word of it I believe every word of it and then there was one more scream and I I remember looking at my own hand and saying Lord you're with me you're with me you're my refuge yes you are Lord You're my refuge go to bed cat Saints him being a refuge doesn't mean this flesh will not still face its challenges it will face its circumstance but he truly said in his word it is written I Am The Fortress come hide in me Hallelujah God bless you Saints I hope that mean a little something to you amen let's just stand Hallelujah 1015 brother Gideon Hallelujah [Music] there
