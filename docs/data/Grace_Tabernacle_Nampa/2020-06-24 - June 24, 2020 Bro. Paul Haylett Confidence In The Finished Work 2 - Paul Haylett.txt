high father giving you the preeminence father that you deserve Oh Lord let that Lord let it just reign in our hearts tonight Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah I just want to say this evening now sometimes things slip our mind we just want to lift up our brother Isaac before the Lord this coming Friday he is scheduled to have a throat surgery they're going to go in there and take his tonsils and whatever out because he's just been having struggles they they did a sleep test I don't know if he shared this he probably didn't they did a sleep test and I don't remember the exact numbers but it was an astounding amount of times that he would stop breathing every night and the doctor said that sometimes the gap would be long enough they said that that would almost be enough for you just to stop breathing forever and so we just want to lift him up before the Lord they you know part of it I hope this doesn't sound bad but sometimes you know the doctor said we can give you a CPAP and brother Isaac said to cut on me he didn't want to have to spend every night the rest of his life you know or believing Lord would healing but to have this machine that goes our sister Dorothy oh I love her amen sister Joanne sister she's been many times to the church here an absolute sweetheart maybe I love her for the wrong reasons but she I never see her but what she's right there telling me brother Paul keep pressing on preach it don't don't veer from it stand on it be faithful she's always just speaking to me in that fashion and and we just want to lift her up before the Lord we were trying to figure out how to correctly pronounce that but her artery right here is carotid is is plugged I think was it 60% and so she had kind of you might say a mild stroke from that er no stroke wonderful amen praise the Lord lift our sister up before the Lord so amen thank you Lord and we want to remember brother Alex sister Ullaeus brother brother Alex will be driving this coming weekend leaving I believe Friday and traveling out west it's been a little bit of a process brother Alex has as you know voiced for quite some time his desire to come to Idaho and he's a young man of great faith determination and so let's remember him also in prayer so our brother Isaac our sister Dorothy our brother Alex and and I was just texting a little bit with brother Sergey he's in Wyoming headed west so just keep him in your prayers amen amen well with this thank the Lord you know I want to speak to you once again on preparations of the man now my brother and sister we can do a lot to take care of the outer man as we have spoke before we can take him to the fitness center we can give him vitamins we can get him to exercise and all of that's good we won't we won't speak ill of those things amen but what is the true importance as we know is what preparation we give the inner man and when the inner man is prepared well the Lord will take care of the outer man amen now you know I love this and and forgive my humor tonight but I remember one time brother Donnie just kind of speaking out to a situation and he said you know people come and you know they say oh I I have this issue brother Donnie would you pray for me and brother Donnie says and of course that's our job as ministry we pray for them and we believe God will touch them but he says you have to leave the Pepsi and the Cheetos and the chips and that other stuff alone amen so don't be eating those and then go to church and say pray for me amen so we have a responsibility to take care of this vessel and and we just believe the Lord knows our hearts and takes care of it let's stand to the reading of the word we'll go to 2nd Timothy amen I want to just continue kind of my thought on confidence in the finished work now as we spoke to you last week my brother and sister when we have confidence that brings trust now we understand that trust is often time based upon relationship right if you've come to a complete stranger you might have a more difficult time to trust them but you know there's been many times that God has allowed complete strangers to to do things in our lives and somewhere along the line we have to believe that God is in control and so as we look to what God is doing in our life we have to start trusting him and we see now that trust and confidence are tied together and trust confidence and faith are all of the same vein amen so you can't say I have faith but you don't trust God you say I have confidence but you won't trust or you won't have faith so those really go down this same vein and now we have in the natural we have a certain degree of faith confidence trust how many of you well hopefully nobody's driving a car like that but how many of you tonight just got in your car you put the key in the ignition you didn't think twice right you didn't say oh I hope this will start at different times of our lives with driven cars like that but there's just an innate value in humanity that we are shocked when it fails when we turn the key and nothing happens we're shocked in fact I've helped two people on the side of the highway before and you know just you pass them in the semi and they're in the middle of nowhere and you think that is not good looks like a you know when I say young that's relevant young woman children in the car they're 40 or 50 miles from any kind of services and you just can't bring yourself to keep driving and so you pull over and I've walked almost a half a mile back up the freeway before to help people and you walk up there and the lady sitting in the car continually turning the key hearing this Illinois going click click click and getting weaker and I and she wouldn't roll the window down but I finally convinced her ma'am the car is not going to start so you need help and she's like well there there's no services here and I said I know so you're gonna have to just allow someone else to help you and you know they they have a hard time hard time to unlock the door hard time to allow someone to to have interaction with them and it's there because there's a fear so as sons and daughters of God if we will not trust God then ultimately down somewhere in the midst of all of that there's a fear there is a doubt there is something hindering and so my brother and sister sometimes what we got to do is not sit here and preach about you must have faith you must have faith you must have faith we need to stop and examine our life go back what is it we're afraid of when we figure out what it is we're afraid of now sometimes we're afraid because we were taught at some stage in our life we were taught to fear God not with reverence but with actual fear and I have encountered in times churches that were actually afraid of their pastor now my brother and sister how are you going to grow and move forward when you are afraid of where this is going what is going to happen is he preaching truth or is he not well do you know that that's really not the pastor's fault if you don't know whether he's preaching truth or not are you with me because we have laid at our fingertips every reference and every bit of the Bible we have all of that at our fingertips but what we have beyond that is the fact we've been given an unction the prophet of God spoke this and it should register with us that we can pray for revelation and our revelations not just oh I feel it in my heart right now I don't mean to speak ill but the the LDS the Mormons say well if you feel a burning in your in your heart or you know in your chest now that's a sign of the Holy Ghost my brother and sister that is not you'll not find anywhere in there the scripture says that our hearts are not to be trusted our hearts are deceitful amen scripture teaches us that it's not by education or theology that we confirm that but the scripture shows us that it is that personal relationship you praying for revelation praying for the Holy Ghost praying for this and God coming down and confirming it not with how we feel but by his word amen let's turn in second Timothy the first chapter verses 7 through 14 sorry to keep you standing amen want to take a little bit of this just as foundational as we move forward you know sometimes the things that we think are common or have become common to us actually contain a great measure of benefit when we fully understand what we're reading and Timothy the first chapters seventh verse for God hath not given us the spirit of fear so first off let's well let me just read the scripture and not keep you standing for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel according to the power of God who hath saved us not a question mark a statement who has saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works and I have to say thank you Lord but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began oh my but is now made manifest so started before the world amen but now is being revealed thank you Lord by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel where until I am appointed a preacher an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles for the which cause I also suffer these things nevertheless I am not ashamed for I know who I am I have believed now when I take this and just make an emphasis for a minute he knows whom he has believed not heard of not been told about knows amen personal relationship amen Ronn know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep all keep that which I have committed unto him against that day hold fast the form of sound words which thou has heard of me in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus that good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us Heavenly Father we ask for your blessings upon the word tonight father for those that are part of the body Lord our brothers our sisters Lord unable to be here tonight working or whatever the circumstance might be father we just send your Holy Spirit out to each and every one lord give us unction father give us a rejoicing in our hearts and soul Lord to know that we have been called and Lord you have provided Lord we thank you for this in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated I want you to just start there in verse 7 and just touch on a few things quite quickly we move forward for God hath not given us the spirit of fear now remember one of the greatest gifts brother Branham speaks about that God would give us salvation is a great gift amen giving the Holy Ghost to us is a great gift and God was not obligated remember if there is any obligation that has been placed God put himself under obligation it was not something that that he did because he felt sorry for us but he knew exactly what he was doing so we are here and as we were just speaking in our preamble of the service tonight my brother and sister you see we've not been given the spirit of fear so if fear is something that has come in some segment of our life that has caused us to pull back or not completely trust God then we can recognize by the Word of God that this did not come from God amen so it's there that Satan watching us studying us as our greatest adversary he has come and he studied what it is and you can look in the world today and you can recognize the power of fear I was sitting today in a piece equipment for quite a few hours and after a bit there I had turned on the radio to listen for a little bit and people were calling into a radio station and he had asked them what they thought would be coming in the state of Idaho in the next little bit and you we heard everything from our governor is a tyrant and is trying to take over the state - he didn't do enough and all kinds of things and there was a common theme in the voices that I was hearing from the radio and I really felt like the Lord just kind of give me that unction to listen because it kind of fit with what we're speaking tonight and you hear in probably nine out of ten people there is fear there people are saying I'm so afraid some of them very vocal I'm so afraid of what will happen with our children I in the future what will happen with this what will happen I'm afraid and we have people moving here that have different ideas than what Idaho was founded on and I'm afraid of what our state is turning into I'm afraid of my job I'm afraid for my investment I'm afraid for my retirement and at this fear my brother and sister as it is spoken there would be people then call in and say yes as that person said I feel the same way and pretty soon you can feel a little spirit of oppression coming down you know that there was and finally I almost called the radio station myself amen but finally there was a man come on and said well I don't know what's gonna happen with everybody else but we have my wife and I have charted a course we have set a deal we have set ourself in a position that we will not be afraid we are not going to be controlled by fear we are living our lives our life is too short anyhow we will not give it up to this kind of a thing and and you know the radio commentator kind of I think playing as it were the devil's advocate said well what if and the guy said I don't care about your what if Amen hallelujah well my brother and sister what if the devil is roaring like a lion tonight amen he can't get into our position because our say she is in Jesus Christ and if he could defeat that then it's all a lost call but the Word of God has showed us and it is clearly proven that the name of the Lord is a strong tower and they believer a man sanctified amen justified sanctified washed in the blood it's in that strong tower and Satan cannot get into him amen so we are not going to be controlled by the spirit of fear we have questions amen I think it's fair to have questions brother Branham in several places says well I don't know you know this is not exact words but I don't know about tomorrow I don't know what will happen I don't know what's going to happen with my ministry but my brother and sister you didn't seem throw his hands up and say well if the devil will allow he always said Lord willing hey man it has nothing to do with Satan willing the devil willing amen all of Hell willing it's what the Lord said amen Lord willing hallelujah so it's there as we put into this we have not been given the spirit of fear if fear is on our doorstep if fear is in our home fear is in our mind my brother and sister it's time right now we don't need another time we stop right now and say Lord spirit of fear away from me Amen people I don't know will I have a job I thought it was interesting after all the city or the state of New York has been through I'm thinking was a city you know and they're recovering and and their mayor and their a governor of made these statements that are just so outlandish you know God didn't have any part of this we did this ourself and all of this stuff and now right when they're talking about we're gonna have a recovery they make an announcement that probably probably this fall they'll have to layoff 20,000 municipal workers what is it another spirit of fear they've removed God from the equation they're filling the void with fear now my brother and sister you know what will happen every municipal worker that thinks his job might be at risk I'll go into a state of absolute fear and if you don't think that they won't make their co-workers look bad to look good to keep their own job it is now they'll start being cannibals and feeding upon one another pushing each other so to speak under the bus because well I've got a mortgage I need it more than they do and it's there but my brother and sister why would you announce it probably will have to lay all these people off when they're talking months and months and months in advance what they should do is say you know what we might all want to tighten our belt or not and we might all need to just be as efficient as we can be but we can press forward and overcome this instead they offer up to the people the platter of fear oh my my brother and sister that will be a recipe straight out of the pits of hell amen well I'll tell you sometimes we we hear some of the preaching of different people different avenues and they're there preaching fear to their church amen you know look my brother and sister I'm sorry to just be kind of blunt but the devil and I aren't getting along lately we've been fussing quite a bit him and hey man he's been trying to do things and I've been kicking him in the teeth and I can't you know I just keep stomping on his fingers and you know you just get kind of a certain attitude about that you know you see some of them old slimy fingers creeping up over you might say the window seal there and I'm just keep chopping him off hey man I'm just tired of dealing with him I'm tired of talking to him I'm tired of dealing with the aftermath of what he's done when he comes tearing through there ain't man so you look at this the spirit of fear I'm sorry I won't embrace am I'm gonna stand upon this very verse right here ought to be enough to fundamentally put us in a position to claim every promise of God amen we should be able to claim every position that God has given right off of this via verse right here because he's not giving us can we say he's not giving me hey man he's not giving me the spirit of fear but he's given me hey man what is it in context now look I've out basically flunked out of school I'm not the brightest boy maybe we can put this in context he has not given me the spirit of fear so we're talking about giving is actually I don't have the right words for it but that's really what the the context of us coming down he gave a gift what was the gift it wasn't fear but it was of power hey men he gave me a gift of power oh we're not a church to sit back and say you know what I just hope and maybe this and maybe that I got a child not serving God a husband not serving God a wife not serving God whatever it might be and I and I hope no my brother and sister not of fear Amen but of power he gave me a gift he gave me a gift gave me a gift of power now the prophet of God we have to clarify this amen not just go off thinking we got the prophet of God said we don't actually have the power we've been given the authority to take the power of God and put it to work Amen well my brother and sister if you have the power you have to maintain it but if you just have authority to use the power then God Himself is obligated to maintain the power are you with me hey men and he says he's also given us a gift of love hallelujah you know how hard that can be sometimes come on doesn't feel like love when you slap somebody silly doesn't feel like love when you you're tense and you're struggling and all kinds of things are happening around you and all right are you with me amen but you know I just shared with you I should included this I thought about it but you know we just shared with you in a previous service here and that God would chasing us or write but didn't he say I chasing those I love amen sometimes getting whooped on and getting shook up a little bit and having oh I hope you get this oh I should have took that message book sister Jerry just shared with me it's going to sidetrack me and it just did but my brother and sister let just sister Jerry him that to me amen I've got to read that and Louise let me find that portion right here amen this is in perfect faith page 4 if you want to look at it that way paragraph 19 now faith is based on forgiveness Oh hallelujah there are so many good things right here if I'm not careful I'll just breach that not what I was going to but my brother and sister faith is based on forgiveness and if we can't forgive then you're not going to see faith growth you are not going to be able it can come down to something totally in the carnal here but if you can't forgive on that you will never be able to trust God many people I hope this isn't with those here tonight but many people actually go through a stage of their life a season of their life angry at God and not trusting him now they say well if this would have been this if that would have been that and you know God's in control so why and they come to a place they don't trust God they're actually angry at God and they feel like God has betrayed them feel like God left them short you might say out in the wilderness and and so now they have something my brother and sister they have no hope I'm telling you they have no hope they will not trust humanity they will not trust God or turn it around vice versa if you won't trust God you won't trust humanity and so there comes a time that forgiveness is part of the faith that we need to have expressed in other words we believe God would take that anger or bitterness that's down in our heart from some portion of our life some circumstance in our life and that God can and will come and set that in order now if you don't believe that you will carry that all the days of your life never believing that God ever had your best interest in mind so you look at that and realize whether you're talking spiritually or naturally forgiveness is a key and so if you to grow spiritually there's brother Jason and I are talking in the back room for just a minute my brother and sister this time of year right now you want beans to grow it's starting to get hot beans are still little there's moisture in the ground you would think we'll sit back just let them they'll do it fine but you know what happens the best way to grow good beans is you don't irrigate them and then you go out and cultivate them and all of that surface moisture that was right there that all them little feeder roots were eating on you stir that up you get oxygen in there the moisture leaves and the beam cries because now it's sitting in what used to be a perfect environment but now it's mostly dry but you know what happens when it got stressed it's got two choices wither up or dig deeper well hallelujah thank you lord we're gonna dig deeper we're not gonna wither up we're not gonna blow away we're gonna dig deeper so you stir that dirt up I was in fairness for brother Jason you stir that dirt up and you just wait a few days don't go rushing back there to irrigate them you wait a few days those beans will double in size and you go the route my brother and sister that sitting in a wet ground will be about that deep and the route that is in dry ground will be about that deep hey man we got to get rooted down hey man we're not going to be tossed around by every wind of doctrine we're not going to get tossed around by every little thing that blows through the church yeah it might have tossed us for a moment but we're gonna be able to stand up and say the anchor holds hey man we're not we're not quitting we're not going away we're not giving up amen we're gonna call on the Lord amen and he said all that would call on the name of the Lord you draw nigh unto me I'll draw nigh unto you hallelujah oh look at that so we come my brother and sister and you know verse 9 stirs my heart who has saved us this is a past tense and called us with a holy calling Amen not just not just any old kind of calling Amen we're not called to just live any old kind of life this was a holy calling a man not to be members of a church but to be part of this great kingdom of God amen which I thank the Lord see it's not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began now look at this what was it now I know some people come along and they think you know you're messed up on the Godhead my brother and sister if we get so technical that we can't figure out brother Branham says you know it's all God you can call it the holy ghost you can call it the Sun you can call it the father you can call it creator you can call it Savior it's all gone amen so you look at this and realize my brother and sister met as God has come he chose to bring this redemptive power to you and I through Jesus Christ right now we know that all things were made for him and by him so Jesus Christ is not just a sideline it's not just something else but it is another expression of God himself as we've been taught and we believe amen that is his name has a name he chose to be represented in amen the name of Jesus Christ so as we look at that we realize now that this redemptive power this a word that has come this holy calling was brought to us which was given us in Christ Jesus so you're not going to find it right you're not going to go out and there's no other power that's going to bring us into the right position but Jesus Christ and so as we move forward into that to realize that as God through the word had come down john 1 and come down and revealed himself my brother and sister contained in that word was ever redemptive key that was already given us to loose it in our life so without that my brother and sister we can say well the Bible says and we'll touch on that just a few minutes the Bible says the Bible says but says it was now made verse 10 now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel now remember when we talked about this go ye into all the world and preach the gospel the prophet of God said that's not going out in just preaching the word but it's preaching the life that is in the word amen so if we don't preach the life if we just read letter and we just talk about letter or we read quote we talk about quote my brother and sister if there's no life in that then it will be completely ineffective that's where we come to the place where brother Branham says I'm afraid we're getting people to church and not to Jesus Christ amen we don't want to get people just to church we want to get them to Christ hallelujah amen but it's now made manifest I love this you know my brother and sister it's been kind of a pet subject to mine for many years things being made manifest Amen you know it's there that you you get to see what has been spoken you get to see what has been promised you get to what has been revealed all coming forth we are seeing right now we could if we had absorbed ourselves into the day's news today I believe without a shadow of a doubt we would have been able to look at what is happening in the world today and correlate it back to the scripture and seeing prophecy made manifest in the day that we're living amen but you know just like every age were raising our children working a job we're doing this we're doing that and the very fulfillment of prophecy is slipping by so much so that they come one day and says wasn't Elias supposed to come see they completely missed it amen lord help us help us Lord don't let us don't let us have now now look I say this so nobody will be offended probably if I was a child today they would declare me a DD now that's fine I don't mind that own bother at all cuz you go look back through history all the guys that accomplished something had a DD but anyway my brother and sister you look at the world we're living in today they think we're a DD about this well praise the Lord I almost preached you tonight maybe we'll preach at another service almost preach to you tonight about the bride is a prepper y'all know what Preppers all right there the guy with well if you're a true prepper ammunition comes a B comes before F so if you're a true prepper and used to start through the alphabet hey man you'll come to ammunition before you'll come to a house sleeping bag food everything on the list so a true prepper always has lots of ammo but my brother and sister this Bride of Christ is a true prepper amen you know revelations 19 6 and 7 for the Lambs wife has made herself ready she has got every last thing that our Lord Jesus gave her on the lid to be ready and she has come down that list if you would and she's went through there and said M praise the Lord thank you Lord check that when does she become complacent because she's went through the list nope she goes right back and says Lord less I've missed something let me go back let me clean my lamp Lord let me make sure it's got oil let me make sure it's trimmed Lord because I'm not gonna miss this amen so as we look at this and realize what God is doing he is causing us to come into a place that we are now shifting from the things of this earth the focus of this earth amen now in verse 12 he says for which cause I also suffer these things nevertheless I'm not ashamed for I know whom I have believed so whatever the suffering that took place did not bring you know it's like to say well I'm an overcomer and be going through the hardest trial of your life the world out here says now how can you say you are an overcomer you are victorious and you're going through great physical problems great mental problems great financial problems maybe even some spiritual problem but my brother and sister whatever it is brother Kristin I was visiting for a few minutes last night it's whatever and this is proven my brother and sister not just a Prophet's quote but my brother's sister whatever you confess amen is what you will ultimately take a whole tub if you keep telling yourself that you're stupid you're foolish you're this you're that you're weak whatever it is you will find yourself manifesting that position that's why the prophet of God told us what you need to do is not speak the devil's language you need to stand up and say I'm a good Christian I'm filled with the Holy Ghost I'm an overcomer because ultimately that will propel you into claiming that position if you say a failure oh I tell you away too many brothers and sisters sitting around you know and they look at things in their life and they say well I'm a failure well my brothers sister you say that enough and you will manifest the desire and the expression of a failure but if you all set there regardless I don't care you know as it is that you fell I fell on your face you got mud on your face if you'll stand up and say Lord forgive me I am a son of God I am a daughter of God and you move forward my brother and sister well the word says he didn't do it because of your works so why would you halfway through the journey start measuring it by your works hey man I'm not talking about these people that are like praise the Lord I smoke drugs and I do this and I drink and I dance and I whatever but I'm a Christian no there's going to be a life to back it there's going to be an evidence that backs it up but don't let the devil short-circuit you halfway through and you start looking at your works trying to measure it up to it amen hallelujah now as we look at the word my brother and sister look at these promises that he has promised to us amen but we want to look at what he's not giving us and I want to go right back to the first verse here and as this reference and then we'll move on I want you to look at what he hasn't promised us he hasn't promised us that we would have a spirit of fear he hasn't promised us that would be powerless he hasn't promised us that we would have no love he hasn't promised us that our mind now you see that's one of the things that our nation people are struggling with right now it's a great big argument people are angry over the sound mind talking about mental illness my brother and sister we are not exempt right the Old Testament tells us that it happens to the rich and the poor and the righteous and the unrighteous but we don't have to accept Satan's verdict hey man that's the difference the Bride of Christ does not have to accept Satan's verdict and we can come and we can struggle in the flesh and some people they just get to a nervous they don't want to talk about it but my brother and sister now remember being a sound our unsound you might say mental illness is a more beautiful thing oh yeah beautiful brother Paul I don't understand well you could have a heart full of fear amen you might be troubled on one side but believe the Word of God you'll believe yourself brother wrong Spencer I love brother Ron's position he's there he's actually preached some services he's pressing forward he has good days he had bad days but he'll lean right over the pulpit and will declare to the people I'm going to preach myself right into a deliverance now the new me I'm not going to sit on the couch sit on a chair sit under a bench under a tree and go is me so I'm gonna preach myself right into a healing I'm gonna preach myself right into a deliverance come on preachers come on preachers come on family amen we can speak ourselves right into it because he didn't promise that these things would be absent from us he promised that these things would be given to us we can kick the spirit of fear out we can claim the spirit of love and of power and of a sound mind hallelujah this is the word this is God's promise to us now I hope that's not too blunt to you some people like I said get nervous about that but my brother and sister I'm telling you it's time we over all the sugar-coated it's time we get all the frosting off ain't been a good frosting won't hide a bad cake Oh it'll look pretty my brother and sister but the first bite will tell whether it's real or not hallelujah mine's me of a wedding went to I won't say who but we went to a wedding one timing and the wedding was all over in there packing stuff up somebody made a comment Maya there's a lot of cake left over it was all I could do just that cardboard you had with frosting on it there's a lot of that leftover but you ever eat a real good cake at someone I don't mean to put anybody on the spot but I'll tell you what butter you know how to make a cake or a pie unless you know how to use butter hallelujah and you make something with love that's the butter amen that's the butter hallelujah we don't want no cardboard religion hey man we don't want a bunch of cardboard quotes we don't want some kind of cardboard atmosphere in the church hey man I want to come in house of God and I want God to bless us that we come in here and we just look like a bunch of selfish little children just chowing down hey man can I have another piece you've already had three that's all right there's a lot of cake hallelujah God's given us a lot of cake Oh hallelujah we're never gonna get out of here at this rate hallelujah so look my brother and sister we're not looking for a watered down calling amen that song says he wasn't looking at me Oh hallelujah think about it he wasn't looking at me he looked at his word and he is his word so he actually you might say looked at himself and said no matter what they are where they been where they come from or whether the devil's trying to take him I am more than sufficient to redeem them hallelujah and so I'm just going to call him redeemed amen even before the price was paid right before the foundation of the world before the price was paid he said I'm gonna call them redeemed Oh hallelujah I know it's terrible but song comes to my mind from my childhood and I won't repeat it cuz I don't want to get in trouble but my brother and sister there's a time you know when you look at it from before the foundation in the world some of you might figure this out I'm just not going to voice it Amen when you look at this from the foundation of the world and the devil come afterwards and said this is who you are let's look back to what God said we were there wasn't even a world and johnny-come-lately said not you not you I'm sorry Johnny you're the new kid on the block I've already heard the word the word already said I'm redeemed amen hallelujah well I want to just hurry along here kind of get tired sometimes they're not finishing my thoughts but lord help us the other day brother fred sauceman brother tom simpson i don't know whether he ever got here or not several of us was up at a baptist church now i don't want any of you fault me for heaven went to Pentecostal church before come on I got quote right here he was in a Baptist Church sister Jerry took me to a Pentecostal church if I haven't told you that story asked me I'll tell you about it you're quite interesting I don't know whether he ever got here now several us up at a Baptist Church and the minister said something that sounded pretty good hey ma out of a Baptist minister imagine that all of us said Amen and everybody in the church trips up their neck and look back I'll tell you I can only imagine my Amen what was that we don't do that around here but look at this I hope you guys have a little humor in the message okay some people are just so starched and stiff in their neck that I don't know I fear for them we found a krama that come from behind this honor they're mine he didn't find a whole plateful you know and just dove in all this is a revelation he said I found a crumb oh come on I'll tell you what I want to do here now have sense of humor don't lose it right now but if all I can bring you church is a crumb would you please at least say Amen hallelujah if that's all that I can deliver please say Amen to the crumb we found a crumb that come from behind the Chicana there you know and we was kind of glad to get it we said in other words thank you lord see and when they did these fellows were so veiled they just laughed it they didn't know what it was all about see they're still veiled so there is some inside and some outside and so but God is in full view of us here look at this talk about a paradox God's in feel full view but he's here that would be confusing wouldn't that you someone might say well what what are you saying Amen about well hallelujah I got a crumb from behind the dish Chicana glow I got a crumb and that crumb was so good I had to say thank you lord oh so there is some inside and some outside and so but God is in full view of us now look he speaking to a believer he's not speaking to some church guy he's not speaking to somebody that just has a ritual and a tradition he's talking to a real believer full view of us hid shame now then when God in His mercy rent the veil he was brought into plain view but they were so wrapped up in their traditions he was still hid from them same now two words brings it right into our date same now all that glory this is part of what caught me right here my brother and sister got me started searching and going down this vein was looking into the glory of God all that glory kid is hid for us in Christ the word who is our temple hallelujah God said what I'm gonna do I'm not going to let the world defile this I'm not gonna let that thread it and stomp on it but I'm gonna hide it right in plain view but I revealed it to you and I'm gonna let you be able to take this and you're gonna find that the glory of God Saint is not oh I'm a message believer it's such a struggle it's a burden we're having my brother and sister its glory its glory this is God said I'm hiding this glory for you hallelujah all that glory is hid for us once again here's a promise come on oh the promise of glory is right there it's been hid for us not sit down and say oh you know brother so-and-so it'd be easy for us to say well you know brother George he's he's had a real special relationship with brother Brennaman and brother Brown said he had the Holy Ghost and all that's so wonderful for brother George let me tell you my brother and sister brother George has got to pray and read his Bible brother George has got to overcome the challenge of the day brother George's got to keep pressing behind the veil hallelujah and I'm not ashamed or embarrassed to bring his name up because I have these kind of conversations with him hey man my brother and sister there's no bypass there's no go around there's no go past go and collect 200 my brother and sister everyone's got to live it but when we recognize that God hid all that glory for us in Christ but he takes it now look where he puts Christ right into the word who is our temple hallelujah I'm going to go to the temple and worship tonight I'm gonna go into my Lord Jesus you realize that separates people when they go to church some come to church some come to the temple of the Lord for you with me some are going to the temple to worship some are going to church I don't show up in church but I'm going to the temple hallelujah amen oh now I'm gonna have to dig down in this a little bit excuse me for my emotions this morning but all I've wanted to give this out so long oh this is just superficial this is so simple I mean brother Brahim didn't reveal nothing about the galaxies or what happened here happened there Wow let's be deeper than we thought yeah you know I was sharing with a guy today I don't know how we got on the subject but a grease salesman come by the farm today and we were talking and somehow we got talking about boats and water and something got mentioned about hills Canyon there were other people in the conversation and I said well my wife and I've been to Hells Canyon twice up and down hills Canyon twice once we went the water was so high that the guy says my we got to be careful because there's rocks here that that normally you can see now we can't see him because the water so high and we went down the river and on the way back up the river slammed that boat into a big ol rock and a Rapids you know and and had the the over rep Hertz on the boat just screaming and some guy says sir there's something wrong and he said I've got it all under control and now over rev limiters her just going and we just barely climbed up that Rapids and got out on top and we've also went back to went down that same chunk of river and one of the lowest points they said had been in 25 or 30 years and you know them rocks we were dodging that we're still under the water we're now 20 feet above us high and dry my brother and sister it's all there the glory of God is all there sometimes it's hid but did you know the human nature will cause us when the blessings of God are pouring overflowing we'll gripe and when it doesn't seem like there's any blessings of God we'll gripe did you know they've recently figured out that they're certain euphoric like enzymes released in humanity for certain things and when something is done did you know you can actually and I hope you catch the humor of this I I was like that's the truth they said there's certain things that will come to pass like you can put certain food down in front of somebody and they mentioned ice cream and the person not even touch it just see it and start salivating what is that it actually is some kind of little something that's released in you and your body responds and they said it can be so great that a person can just think a thought about something and a stimulation will come into their body over that font will half a part 3 because I won't keep you all night this is just opening unfolding to me saying all that glory what reaction is it bringing in us are we going I'm a message believer or is there something inside of us hallelujah God reserved and hid this glory for me in Christ Oh hallelujah I'm so excited something vibrating in my soul something stimulating my mind I can't help myself you gonna be like old brother so-and-so gets so carried away well I hope you might understand now he can't help himself hallelujah Oh something going down through you cause you to salivate Lorna some more of that word I want to eat a little more that word give me some more Lord I like a little more Oh hallelujah and the prophet of God says excuse me fry my motion this morning but all I've wanted to give this house so long it's just binding up in me see notice all the glory that is in God is in the word oh can we get the inspiration I've got a horse of the glory of God amen it's right here it's living it's gonna save me it's gonna deliver me it's gonna heal me it's gonna fill me with the Holy Ghost it's right here Oh what we need is to realize the value the God placed upon his word and it want to get us to the place it's no longer obligation but is something in our soul thank you Lord you saved it for me Oh hallelujah oh hey man all these blessings that's in God is in the word it's hid to the unbeliever by traditions see what I mean but it's all in Christ all that God was he emptied himself quino's and come into Christ and we into Christ are behind the veil well I'm into Christ she a and then believe there is three gods baptized the name of father's son Holy Ghost believe in all these traditions and other things that you believe in of the elders now you're still behind the veil come into the veil he Christ is the word amen how I don't believe in black divine healing I don't believe in these miracles and things like that look my brother and sister this kind of spirits creeping into the message there are people we don't longer even ask the people to come to the pulpit we don't ask him to come for prayer if God's gonna heal him he'll heal nonsense sorry I don't want nothing to be unified with that my brother and sister I don't want to be nothing identified with anything that would be considered contrary Oh hallelujah well you see you're not inside the veil you don't know nothing about it see Christ is a word and when we are in the word we're in Christ people are like well I just want to get closer to the Lord good get real close get so close wrap this thing around you you'll be a close you'll be really close hey man and how can I be in Christ denying Christ as what he said not one word shall be added to or taken from now I've got a little criticism and I'm gonna bring this out brother Jason sorry I got my it got my email hey man but my brother and sister look people will be like well why why brother Paul are you constantly hammering on take this back to the word my brother and sister the reason that we take it back to the word we're not trying to vindicate brother branham we're not trying to prove any other thing it's for our benefit when we go back into the word what is it doing it's releasing the glory it's releasing the glory that's in this word into you and I I'm not trying to be redundant I'm not trying to question anyone I want to see the glory revealed hallelujah my brother and sister you don't go to a car show stand out in the parking lot and look at everybody's wore out Toyota no sir you go inside and you start looking at this kind of sports car will start with Corvettes amen but you know you go in there do you realize how cool this late-model that they just released of Corvette is my brother and sister you know it's got a turbocharged motor it's mid mount now it doesn't have the under and over steering problem that they had before because the nose was heavy they don't have to worry about breaking the rear loose the thing is now on a competitive edge to all the major sports cars in the world and it costs considerably less it is a tremendous car and I'm telling you I'm not gonna stand out in the parking lot and look at your rusted out Mazda when that's just inside the door come on why would we settle for anything less than the glory of God coming down in Grace Tabernacle why would we settle for anything less then power of God answering our question and giving delivery and giving us healing what would we look at the rusted-out Mazda when the power of God is here in our midst Oh hallelujah oh excuse me for my emotions I'll just have to get this out amen not one word shall be added to or taken from we got people I'm sorry I'll just beat this to death I'm sorry you can always fire me but my brother and sister around the message we are seeing people say well he meant this and this was this and that was that prove it to me by the word I don't want to hear what you said he meant I want to see it in the word and if it won't pass the word test I'm not listening to you and then I'll get criticized I'm sorry I'm just gonna put this out I'm not worried about Paul tonight but I just want you to be aware of Church when people will criticize you because you would come and it seems so pointed well I'm not gonna be responsible to stand there on the day of judgment and say the all appalled you did not tell them come on it says you add the word you take the word away they're cursed well grace I'm just gonna let brother so-and-so speak to you tonight the word says he's cursed but it really shouldn't be a problem what do you mean you fired me what do you mean you chasing me off well if you wouldn't you should come on out a word take a word away we've got so comfortable with unbelief that people myth meet the Word of God and we say well that's their point of view no I'm sorry it's either on the word or it's off okay let me get away from that before I really start chewing up the bones how can I be in Christ denying Christ huh how can you take from an ad to then see it shows shows you what Vale has got you veiled away see we're in him hallelujah that ought to make us excited saying we're not just Christians trying to live we are in EM hallelujah not just we go to this church we believe God sent a prophet we're in him hey we're in him that we being in him we are still veiled to the religionists and professors of the world see our glory that we have and in joy oh I hope we're enjoying Saints if we're not if grace is not enjoying we need to all find the altar and we need to dig in deep because this ought to bring a joy and satisfaction to our souls to know that God said here come into me all ye the weak and heavy laden come into me Oh hallelujah my see our glory that we have and enjoying we are still veiled to them Outsiders I want you to think about the significance of that people say we don't understand why you believe what you believe we don't understand why this causes you to do that or why you put such emphasis on this well I'm telling you we're just simply veiled oh wait the Prophet just touched that in the next line if I just went on wouldn't it they think we're crazy enough again see see that's right but we who are in here in Christ baptized into him first Corinthians 12 into him we are partakers we're not just sitting here with this glory floating around Amen we're partakers I can tell you now I just want to put it in this way so you'll fully understand it you guys know me well enough if there's ice cream on your counter you don't have to ask me if I want some I'm a partaker oh how are you with me hallelujah so the Holy Ghost has come now the supernatural God unveiled himself to us and come down and said Here I am in your presence and now I want you to see that you are in me and I am in you and the glory of Almighty God is in me and if you're in me the glory of Almighty God has to be in you we're not sitting back and saying I hope so I hope so lord please let it be it's in you hallelujah God's not gonna give you revelation and then starve you to death hallelujah oh my brother Paul you understand my life I do understand your life do you understand the word he didn't do it on your merit he didn't do it on your works he did it because he claimed you before the foundation of the world and said hey I'm pouring my glory well Lord your glories just not enough to move me you better get afraid right there because the glory of God will either send you straight to heaven or send you straight to hell and when the glory of God you say glory of God yes it is my brother and sister the word will be our judge and the prophet of God said his word was his glory hmm well hallelujah had y'all excited now you're all frowning okay I wanted to hear that I wanted you to refute me you're wrong brother Paul I might have been quiet for a moment but I have not gave up nothing hallelujah whoa we are partakers of this glory see but not on the outside you're still looking in denying it see problem is we got way too many people that made it to the message but they never made it to Christ so now we are inviting into him to be partakers of all that he is were invited into him which is hid to unbelievers by the veil of human flesh they know that glory they read of it it's in the word here the glory of God and things like that it's just word to them but this is not word as in the word this is just we read it huh well if we knew the Arabic and understood what this word meant in the Hebrew come on I've had message believers tell me that well brother Paul we'd can't fully grasp that unless we was to go study Hebrew and the brother told me he says I've ordered a home study course on Hebrew I patted him on the back said god bless you brother study the Hebrew I think he probably thought I gave him permission but what he didn't realize is I started just distancing myself just in case that would rub off on me cuz one can you see brother Paul can't even get English right imagine him trying to do Hebrew I might as well just go out and become a drunk because I'd never make it through the Hebrew to understand God but you see that wasn't what my prophet told me he told me to pray for Revelation pray for it more than anything else and so I pray for Revelation I sent a loader I set an attractor I set in a drug lord please show yourself to me open your word to me Lord break live to me Lord I might not be the smartest knife and sharpest knife in the drawer but Lord I am a son of God I I'm cold I've been redeemed hallelujah they read it the glory of God things like that it's just word to them to us it's a manifestation oh my Bible tells me that I was in him before the foundation of the world hallelujah poured I've known you all my life Oh hallelujah see it's no more a word it's a reality God said let there be light that was the word oh I hope there's some stumble you I had to read this a lot of times before I started to recognize what was being said let there be light that was the word but now there is light it ain't the word did you catch that my brother and sister people are like we're waiting for prophecy to come to pass for the bride to be lifted up because a prophet of God said that we'd move beyond this it's not like a whole nother church age but we're moving beyond this into the bride age and we're waiting for that to be manifested and I'm there but what are you talking about I'm already living in it amen I've already been blessed I'm in the bride age the word has been opened amen the third pole is not a cliche Amen the opening of the seals is not a cliche Amen I get a live it it's a manifestation hallelujah so it's no longer let there be light the light has come Oh hallelujah the light is here it ain't a word is so light see what I mean now it isn't just a written word to us it's reality see we can sit back and say oh praise the Lord the Prophet said this the Prophet said that I was reading my Bible my brother and sisters someone on the face of the earth is a manifestation of a prophets message someone is living that life it's coming out of them it's being drawn right out of them Oh hallelujah somebody doesn't gotta go out sorry sister Nadia but we don't got to go over here now sister Nadia you need to be a good believer come on what is it it's being drawn out of us a man that life is coming out of my very pores hallelujah oh now it isn't just written word to us it's a reality we are in him now I know some folks around the message that would criticize me and say brother Paul you believe parousia well I don't know what your deal is but the problem with those kind of things is is people won't tell you their opinion but they want to hear their opinion come out of your mouth well I'm sorry Perugia is not all negative somebody perverted it tried to turn it twist it trying to turn it into a shortcut pilgrims progress kids how did that shortcut work it didn't now it isn't just a written word to us it's a reality we are in him now we're old sour cranky you left out a comma in a period no sir I'm sorry I'm too busy enjoying this message I'm enjoying not being wrapped up in the Pigpen I'm enjoying not eating the corn husk I'm enjoying not sitting there controlled by condemnation I'm enjoying the Liberty amen Oh hallelujah yep words say he was been set free is still bound no no he's free indeed hallelujah there's some people is there anyone here tonight that's free indeed hey man there ought to be something inside of us they just got a stirred up hallelujah it ought to have us you say Paul you're just playing on emotion well if you think that I'm sorry but there's something that just keeps building in me and I'm going on and I'm telling you my brother and sister don't look on the outside no look on the outside say brother Paul looks he's frowning you don't know what's going through my mind you know know what's going through my heart and the same with you God forgive me I've judged it when I preached to you before and looked out and I thought all my they ain't getting it Lord and then how people meet me in the back and say brother Paul this and this and this and I was just reading this over here and it fit perfect right here and you're certainly how come you didn't use that I I thank you lord I don't know because I didn't know that quote existed oh it's not just written word to us it's reality sister had me would you come we are in him now we're enjoying now we behold him now we see him the word the word manifesting itself is hid out there because why it's veiled in human flesh hallelujah I can't explain it I don't know why God chose to do it that way I don't I stopped sometimes not doubting not down in the dump I stopped sometimes why me Lord well I mean I don't even understand Lord why me but I'll tell you what I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk this pilgrim way hey man because he did choose me Oh hallelujah Oh hallelujah well we'll just have to play part three or something Saints oh my goodness my goodness you love the Lord tonight amen did you find a crumb hallelujah oh thank you lord no they got a chrome out of a Baptist Church what we ought to get out of a good Holy Ghost filled message Church we ought to be having remember I talked about the little take home box hey man sister Jerry and I went Nate the other day hey man and so we're there and they said would you like a box Amen they got a sub and I thought there's no way that what's on sister Jerry's plates gonna fit in that box and so she's just kind of stuffed and pride and mashed and it fit in the box but how about they bring you a box go ahead take something home with you tonight take home this word feast on the scarlet Orion I didn't give you just a crumb tonight I gave you access to the whole table Oh hallelujah I gave you all my word I didn't hide some of it from you I didn't tell you you gotta go trek over a mountain climb up and talk to some guru oh all I told you is make the effort pray for it and I'll give it to you what did they say ask and you shall receive Oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my and as always we didn't get to the best part oh my hallelujah oh look I want to touch on this so maybe we wouldn't have to go back I'm not gonna read the other quotes okay sometimes we believe all this might be for someone else you see you got a decision to make tonight it can be for someone else or it can be for you amen you can look at this well brother so-and-so he's such a spiritual man I'm sorry we can't all quote scripture like an encyclopedia I'm not making an excuse but I'll just tell you even as a little kid I went to Vacation Bible School with friends of mine at their farm kids and they give you all this stuff and at the end of the Vacation Bible School all you had to do is be able to recite I think it was like seven I had some reason it was seven but hey I'd be able to recite seven it's just Scripture [Music] and I remember the Vacation Bible School teacher chastising me in front of the other kids because I messed up my verses if you had tried Paul let she know that I've set night after night and read them and read them and read them I just couldn't remember she was like no that's not the second verse that's the fifth one I don't know maybe my mind just took me to the ones that were important to me I don't know but I don't need to be able to quote the encyclopedia of the word I don't need to be able to tell you every message in what paragraph it was I just need Christ in me and I need to get in to him hallelu amen he wrote the scripture he's more than able to know what I was talking about like the little girl that you've read this little girl reciting the ABCs and ask him honey what are you doing says well I don't know how to pray I don't know what way to put it so I'll just read the ABCs and all that God put it in order Oh Lord what I want to put in order is my brother and sister we behold him now we see him the word manifesting himself it's hid out there don't apologize don't apologize amen it's veiled in human flesh God in me Christ in you the hope of glory brother Jason please come help me Alleluia oh you know what let's just sing
