to welcome into our midst brother yannick and sister sharon amen [Applause] i always marveled and i say this in a positive note i always marveled how a young woman has the betrothed has a beautiful look about her but as a married wife has a different look about her sister sharon you look different this morning amen amen you look like a wife and by the anik you look like a husband hallelujah aren't you glad you know our lord jesus typed our relationship to husband and wife so we're talking about something very glorious and we give our blessings to you this morning god bless you amen you know um i uh did you announce sister nema's graduation uh oh uh oh brother jason pray for brother jason um our sister nima has uh invited each and every one of you that can make it um i don't know why they make graduations in the middle of the day but uh it's it's tough but if you can make it uh her graduation announcements on the board be lovely if some or all could could come and be there for her graduation a milestone in her life and you know i think the greatest i can't help this sister nema but i just remember a time i got to baptize you and there's there's milestones in our life that we get to measure life with you know and to get out of high school and to be able to move on in life as a milestone that i never experienced has the word dropout attached to it you know but uh you know i've never spoke ill of a drop out since uh but uh anyway what a lovely milestone and god bless you sister nima for this time of your life and may the lord just just bless you in all things as you move forward amen could i just have a personal moment to share a couple little things with you just that are very personal to me you know as as this spring harvest time comes it's always been a very stressful time for me and um you know uh in that little short season here everything is very moisture sensitive it's it's not just f we don't get it today we'll get it tomorrow it's very moisture sensitive and so we have as you know you've seen brother chris has preached and stealing my my thoughts i'm not preaching what i intended to preach this morning because he preached it for you the other day uh but uh anyway as we just move forward you know there's times and it's stressful and i know uh uh you know those of you that are in business for yourself especially and those of you that are just doing there's times it's we use the term crunch time and uh so as we were coming this week things going very very good but not good and uh i've been just praying the last few days brother chris just spoke these words and kind of gave me the encouragement to go forward and share this you see we sometimes say lord i need you to do this lord please do this and god answers your prayer in a way entirely different than what you expect and i've been praying the last few days lord i want to be in the house of god on sunday i need to be there i want to be there so lord just make a way and i was just expecting everything to dry to the right moisture everything to just go and we would just be finished but instead the lord opened the windows of heaven and in a totally unexpected way we're here this morning for sure been guaranteed to be here because everything is sopping wet but god answered our prayer amen we are here this morning amen and i want to share something associated with our harvest and hopefully you'll just catch the significance of this the machines that we run are very sensitive to things like metal they have a magnet built into them even a little piece of wire an inch long will stop the machine and but they won't stop is aluminum and you think well aluminum soft it's not really an issue but as we were harvesting a few days ago the machine tripped the magnet metal detector and i go to find what it is reverse the machine it dumps everything back out on the ground and i'm going through the hay and i pick up a very large thick chunk of aluminum enough to totally blow up the cutter head of the machine which is a significant thing in the sense that it costs thousands of dollars to rebuild but this made my heart happy just to say thank you lord for carnal things of life at the end of this substantial chunk of aluminum is one little dinky rusty steel bolt that's all it took it already had teeth marks chewed on it it was there but god in his infinite mercy allowed whatever that fell off of years ago to have one little dinky piece of steel attached to it i just share that because you know it's our prayer each and every day just as it is brother vasily brother sergey i thought maybe both of you would be out on the road i was really laughed at brother jason but i was right on board i've been praying lord be with them wherever they're at on the road they're here this morning you see god knows our heart he knows every little detail don't give up if satan tries to tell you things don't matter i'm here to tell you that in the case of this for an example one little dinky piece of steel now it sounds corn but it saved brother paul about ten to twelve thousand dollars one little dinky piece every detail of your life matters to the lord never never look at the picture and say i think god has forsaken me i think that i'm here alone i think that just remember he said i'll be with you even in you and to the end of the world my brother and sister what an incredible incredible promise there is i would like to share something with you real quick amen if brother isaac will put that up on the screen you know i was just listening uh to um a sermon uh preached there at evening light tabernacle and i don't know if it's minden louisiana and uh in the pre-service this was on this screen and you know i'm not much on predictions right every new year you know you can see it in the grocery store the little magazine psychic predicts this year this will happen and if they do get it right it usually is just barely right it's never ill so we don't pay much mind to that but this intrigued me and and caught me in such a way i thought isn't this the truth because god deals in the certainty god doesn't deal with uh might be it could possibly be if this comes together and that comes together if mars and venus and some other thing line up then it'll all happen god deals in certainty so sons and daughters of god can deal in certainty and let's just read these together because i just like i said it it caught me the top 10 predictions for the rest of 2021 one say amen to those predictions you think will come to pass okay amen god's word will still be true the holy spirit will still move the high priest will still be touched there will still be god-anointed preaching amen god will still inhabit the praises of his people there will still be room at the cross there will still be deliverance i want to make that plural deliverances amen there will still be salvation there will still be healing and the last line i believe capital over there will still be overcomers hallelujah aren't you glad i think every one of these will come to pass hallelujah god bless you my brother manasseh good to see you amen let's just stand i want to speak to you this morning on redemptions manifestation once again you know saints i'm just sorry i told you before we were going to map out we were going to lay out this deal of the unbeliever the make-believer but i'm i'm telling you i just can't bring myself to preach on them when there's so many beautiful things to preach on concerning the believer amen i just uh you know you go in the front of the grocery store and there's all these delectable things you know they always put the bakery or used to anyway put it right close so you come close to it because soon as you would see that you'd say i have to have some of those and you know it's there that it's a good but nobody wants to enter the grocery store from the back door you know why the dumpsters at the back door so we don't want to enter the grocery store from the back door we don't want to look at the garbage first and then go find something good we want to come in the front door look at the good things and some things do end up in the dumpster but that doesn't concern us because we're not shopping the dumpster we're shopping of the good things so here we are today once again i don't know why i feel compelled to share that but i'm just telling you that probably don't count on or wait or hold your breath for me to go preaching on the unbeliever and the make-believer very much because it just doesn't apply to us does it huh saints hello hello oh my i have to preach a sermon on that amen second thessalonians the first chapter verses one through twelve paul and sylvanias and timotheus unto the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ grace unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ we are bound now this word bound my brother and sister is not one of obligation as in a requirement but this is something that has gripped them so they've been gripped to thank god always for you brethren as it is meet because that your faith is withering away no see that's not something to be excited for so they are compelled to thank god because your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth boy that's what i desire for grace tabernacle so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of god for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure interesting they're making a declaration paul is that i glory in you for your patience and for your faith that you have in other words your withstanding or living in or surviving through or standing solidified in persecutions and tribulations that you endure i say that's quite a compliment which is manifest token of the righteous judgment of god that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of god for which he also suffer seeing it is a righteous thing with god to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you and to you who are troubled rest with us when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels inflaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power when he shall come to be glorified catch this saints he doesn't say come to be glorified with his saints and to be glorified in his saints let me just put this that is the manifestation of the seventh seal christ in you right amen hallelujah and to be admired in all them that believe because our testimony among you was believed in that day wherefore also we pray always for you that our god would count you worthy of this calling and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith with power that the name of our lord jesus christ may be glorified once again not on you in you and ye in him according to the grace of our god and of the lord jesus christ hallelujah amen let's go before the lord this morning father i just asked you this morning take our simple words and father bring them to life in us lord let this word father lord come and as we stand father in the season that we are here looking at the world around us an insanity father that seems to be overcoming an insanity that's running rampant father but yet while we'll look at this and while it is an affront to our senses we go back to your word father and we see that it has already prophesied that these things would come to pass now father let us stand with a surety and confidence lord that all of your word will come to pass let us come with faith father taking holds of the word of god that applies to sons and daughters of god that in the application of your word in our life father it will strengthen us give us lord understanding revelation father of the days that will come before us and what has happened uh behind us lord that we can go forward with a complete confidence father day by day lord not of fear for certainly we see the spirit of fear is upon the land but father we weren't called to fear lord we were not called to be bound again by the spirit of fear so we stand upon your word today with a confidence lord that these things will come to pass just as you have spoken we believe this and declare this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you may be seated saints hallelujah so i i say in all jokingly uh joke uh kind of about um the previous services uh it is funny brother chris was marveling the other day that i had quit one verse in front of what was a thought upon his heart i marveled when he preached on that topic because that was going to be my next sunday sermon but you look at that and realize this is nothing more than just the mind of god the anointing of god dealing in the midst of the body so it is not one man stealing a thought from another because all of this is god's thoughts it is not our thoughts it's god's thoughts and so as we look at that i i will touch for just a moment my brother and sister that uh we will see all through the scripture how god has a call to action god has something that he has called each and every one of us to do and so it is there that we stand upon the word of god knowing that the calling and the election is sure and we have confidence in what god is doing in our midst and you know i think as i think uh in these lines i i think of the time you know of of uh sister jerry not not to lift her up but just to do this and when her family and you know every family has a history but as a young woman i believe about 13 years old uh she was introduced and things started to stir her heart a brother preached a sermon uh in fact the brother used a poster of a rock and roll star to part of his sermon making his point and in that you know she said lord if this is true uh show me or prove this to me and we see how god is faithful right he you ask in sincerity he will answer amen and so you look at that and know that we can trust that god hears our voices he knows our hearts and we stand upon that and you know verse 4 and verse 5 if we have already looked at this but i just want to come back and just bring that into a a little more emphasis you see the scripture says you know that we should rejoice as i said in the fiery trials that we could come but you see there's something deeper than just uh rejoicing that we're in the fiery trials but that we ourselves glory in you and the churches of god for your patience now my brother and sister today we would all each one of us say you know what oh i know i should pray for patience i need patience and it's hard to even pray for patience because you know that the fiery trials are going to follow that will test your patience but let me just remind you lest you never pray for patience that god's going to perfect you anyhow whether you asked to or not so you might as well stand and say lord thy will be done which would be to say lord give me patience amen you know that is the significant factor in our life and our lord jesus christ in that he come as our brother david preached this last sunday uh uh you come and and you bring yourself in subjection to the word of god and we have such a beautiful example that took place there in the garden when our lord jesus said lord not my will be done but lord thy will be done see that was the ultimate in a subjection and you say well uh i don't know that i can do that i say you can i say that you can clearly come to the place in your life that you would look to the word of god and say lord let me be this word in other words lord let this word let me be obedient to it and i'm speaking today you know on this topic of uh uh either endure or enduring to the end i had several wrote down my brother and sister you see there's something about enduring and and we'll touch on this or go deeper but when we come to the place that we are willing to look at the plan of god and to submit ourselves to the plan of god and say lord i totally put my will in subjection to your will my brother and sister that's what the brother david was preaching on that's what he was laying out is that we're not saying i have to have it this way i have to have it this way but lord however you want it to be lord i am good with that i just want to be in your presence i just want to to be able to uh be able to stand and you know he's uh here speaking now in verses four and five he's glorying in the believer's trials in uh what uh they're called to endure he's uh he's he's uh giving glory to god and lifting up the believer because of what you are enduring and now my brother and sister you will look at this and realize that enduring uh the definition is to continue to exist in the same state or condition so the unbeliever is going to endure the make believer is going to endure you see this is not just something given in a small slice to a peculiar people but the ability to endure the unbeliever and the make-believer will endure in their state in spite of all evidence contrary and they use a term of that cognitive dissonance my brother and sister all evidence against their position is there and they'll say well i still don't believe or i still believe god can do this but but you see it comes down that enduring for a son or daughter of god is is not just existing in the same state or condition but it is also to come to a place that we can undergo this is under the transitive verb portion of this definition to undergo as a hardship especially without giving in to suffer endure except with tolerance you see we are sons and daughters of god as the apostle paul is speaking here he's he's telling them that i i glory in the fact that you're able to endure through these great trials endure through the struggle of life that is going on around you it is not simply that we put our head down in a stubborn nature and press on but god is bringing us my brother and sister to undergo the hardship but able to do it with a style that is different than the rest of the world to undergo this to endure whatever affliction fiery trials that we would encounter but to be able to go through that not just to say well i guess if god's going to do this to me i'll just go on but we understand by revelation this is what god called us to this is who we are we are not just people that by chance come to the house of god was introduced given a bible introduced to a message now we're not just by chance come to a place or a time but my brother and sister called before the foundation of the world to this calling called to this season called to this day and you say oh i don't feel like this i don't care what you feel my brother and sister nowhere in the word of god does it say serve me if you feel like it but the word has said i have a calling it is a sure calling and i have called you and of this calling that i have called you of i have given a surety and when i could swear by none greater i swore by myself to ensure that what i have spoken of you will come to pass it doesn't get any more beautiful than that saints to know that god has done now let me put it in this terms right here i remember many years ago when i first started to farm the banker said you have no history as a farmer on your own sure you're a farmer's son but you have nothing and my father was very kind he allowed me to pledge even things that he owned he had a tractor i i was able to pledge it i pledged my car my pickup everything that i owned to my name to the bank so i could borrow a few thousand dollars to rent a piece of ground now my brother and sister the surety that we gave was a surety that if we failed they would come and with surety take what i had but this surety that our lord jesus christ has signed as it were in his own precious blood was not a guarantee that if you fail the devil can take what i've got my brother and sister this was a surety that god said what i have poured into you cannot fail it's not a well if it does this is a surety it cannot fail i'd like someone to lift a hand and say thank you lord amen this is not a a gamble 50 50 stake of success or failure this is god saying what i have begun in you i will finish oh isn't that so beautiful it stirs my heart down to the very depth because i don't know about you but i made about 50 or 150 or maybe that's too low mistakes the last week i don't glory in my mistakes i glory in the fact that god said he would never leave me nor forsake me there's where the glory comes because we have a surety amen you see in these scriptures and i chose that one there's very many and we'll probably have a part two or three on this but my brother and sister there's many scriptures that deal with this idea and thoughts of enduring and endureth but you know what in this scripture i've read to you there's not a single mention of flowery beds of ease paul is talking of their patience and their endurance of the trials they're going through he doesn't talk about oh wasn't that beautiful as you've got to walk and lounge and just enjoy all the glory of being a son or daughter of god paul's talking about fiery trials he's talking about enduring with patience what is set before you the path we say of life reminds me of a man brother that i know good christian man he said you know i met a friend in college and he was witnessing to me and i gave my heart to the lord and he said i went and got baptized and and my friend kept mentioning to me whatever you do just hang on and he thought what's he talking about and then he said when the trial started hitting him he thought my friend lied to me because he had grasped the idea that being a christian his problems were over and he brings this to his friend and he says you know i feel like you deceived me because i thought when i got saved it was over he goes i know i tried to warn you in kind words in subtle words your battle is just starting the struggle is just starting and he said but the problem that i found in that as i was hooked on the idea that jesus christ died for me i was hooked already on the idea that i had been set free i was hooked already that i would have eternal life and as the trials got stronger he said all i could remember was he promised me not meaning his friend but our lord jesus he promised me he promised me and he was able to hang on until he had a full revelation of faith you see not a single mention of the flowery beds of ease or the natural accomplishment you will do this and you will do that you will overcome this on your own my brother and sister but you'll notice also in the scriptures there's not a mention of compromise there's not a mention of a watered-down message that would redeem but he's talking about the strength of the word of god because your faith groweth exceedingly something's happening that is changing the individuals that paul is speaking to and he's not seeing a stagnant church but he's seeing a church that faith is growing exceedingly and you know sometimes my brother and sister we go through battles and maybe this is not you but i will use myself for an example we go through battles we go through struggles we go through things of life and we don't see much in ourselves and we cry out to god oh god help me i just feel like i'm just not growing i'm not doing but you see those around you are looking at your life saying wow look what god's doing in them look at the power of god moving them and lifting them up they're growing while we ourselves look at ourselves very judgmental or critical and we don't feel like we're growing you know i don't know how it is whether the young kids are taking care of this but we shared this with grace kids and and trying to make a point about the seed that was placed in them and we planted a corn seed in a cotton ball and i hope they've been watering them have you been taking care of your corn seed i hope so kids you see i'm reminded every day of this example i gave to the children of what god is doing what the seed is it must be cared for it needs sunlight it needs water it needs attention and if it is cared for i don't know we were just sharing brother chris sister christian stopped by the house last night uh with yours out mine is about this tall now amen it had a little head start on the kids because i wanted to make sure that as i took this to them that i wouldn't be taking them bad seed but you see my brother and sister if we just put the seed on the cotton ball in the water and put it in the window and never look at it again nothing will come of that it will grow to a certain point and then it will run out of moisture it will run out what is moisture represented my brother and sister think about it amen the washing of the water of the word so you don't give it word this body will dry out and it will just fade away it will slowly wither back to nothing as though there never was something there but the evidence of an empty shell that satan can say this is what i do to christians but if we'll give it attention we'll give it a little water we'll put it in the right atmosphere it grows amen and we get caught as it were in the in the negative side of things in the struggle of life because you see my brother and sister that's where the satan or satan that's where he excels is to always paint the negative picture but i want to reiterate this to you amen not a single mention of compromise and not a single mention of decisions made from emotion come on don't tell me satan don't use emotions husbands wives children we're all subject to emotion and that's good because if we don't have emotion we're dead but we as christians do not make decisions in our life and we don't speak as it were those things will influence our life from a position of emotion we speak those things according to the word of god we don't speak it because i feel like this i feel like one's my friend i don't feel like i'm loved i don't feel like they care i don't i don't i don't i don't i'm sorry the word doesn't say you know what serve me if you feel like it serve me on the days you're happy serve the devil on the days you're sad no my brother and sister he says serve for me no sub note of compromise no sub note of emotion and not a single mention of us making decisions from our intellect do this if you understand this he says only belief he counters these things with only belief that means you have to the in that context of those words you have to exclude something he is saying of all the options that there are in your life i want you to only write singling out only belief don't take all these other options don't like all of these other things that are presented don't take the excuses and the reasoning don't take none of that just single out and belief because if you start to compromise and you start to go from your intellect there is all kinds of intellectual concepts there's all kinds of emotional concepts you know i felt like bringing a little flower because i think sometimes saints this is how we get caught up in the cares of life any of you ever get caught up in the cares of life [Music] remember we always make the little jokes about the little boy or the little girl they're sitting out on the backside she loves me she loves me not she loves me she loves me not all the way around the flower gets down to the last one she loves me a bad flower it's not how we serve god they don't get up in the morning he loves me he loves him or not he loves me loves not he loves me not oh it's going to be a terrible day i'm sorry his word said he loves you his word says because of his love that is beyond our love he redeemed us when he when we loved him not he loved us amen so we come to this place and we recognize we have to stand on the word of god it's not an emotion it's not an intellect and certainly it is not an opinion because i can assure you today that there will be influences in your life anybody have influence in your life come on let's be honest with ourselves i'm talking about outside of the church outside of husbands wives parents etc we have influences in our lives and my brother and sister sometimes those influences in our life affect us more than the preaching of the word of god what we need to do is put all the other influence to the side and if the preacher is preaching the truth then we need to say you know what this trumps my friend my mama my daddy this person that person this trumps their opinion because this is the word of god but if we're not careful opinions weigh so heavily and we might hear the preaching once a week twice if we attend all the service but opinion can come multiple times a day all week long and he ever noticed when the devil comes to speak he doesn't come when you're on fire got victory got your sword pulled out and you are ready to fight no sir the devil always comes when he finds you now i'm just saying this if any of you were in this position i'm not picking on you but when you're sitting in your bedroom with the shade pulled and the lights off nobody loves me that's when the devil says hey i love you what i want you to do now is reciprocate this what's god ever done for you and you know what happens we go into a state of amnesia right there and every good gift that god has given us through our life suddenly vanishes from our thinking and we're like yeah i'm not even sure god loves me oh my and the devil's like here's some clothes here's some music here's some new friends they'll all love you well you know what the world has a different definition of love than god has and because we are sons and daughters of god can someone say amen to that amen the devil is now trying to interpret what true love is to you and true love my brothers and sisters now i hope this doesn't hurt anybody's feelings especially you children but uh love is not giving you everything you want the scripture says those he loves he gives every gift they pray for i can't find it in the bible either those he loves he chastens but wait if god will do this for me i'll love him you will for a season the season till that brand new shiny car that you thought had to be a gift from god gets scratched the body shop can't get the paint right and your rear bumper looks yellow compared to a white car and suddenly it's like lord you got to get me a different car if you love me lord i'll get a different car now i'm sorry you were upside down when you traded into that car and now you've got a car with a weird colored bumper that's uh and no it ain't going to work that way god loves you when he brings your hide to church come on you didn't bring your hide to church he brought your hide to church he knew your footsteps and god chose his love oh come on saints just have a little sense of humor this morning when you come to church and god just wails on you come on i've got some good children i've got three very good children god bless me with i ask them did we spank you enough i don't even remember you ever spanking me and i'm like i somehow raised a child i never whipped i failed because the word says those you love chasing it think about it parents think about it if you really love them sooner or later you're going to whoop them i don't know sister gabriella did your parents spank him yes okay see brother adam sister sarah loved her amen i'll tell you see we can bring this right down there some of you never got whipped your parents have warped you and say i love you and the reason i never corrected you and i gave you everything you wanted and i babied you and i cardinaled you it's because i love you i call to question that doesn't fit the word of god a parent that really loves their child will bring that child to a center where christ is at and will balance them of the goods and the bads and all things and they will have discipline in their life it will not be if you do this that will be the proof you love me i'll tell you the word says he already loved us before we loved him amen and we needed to stand and say thank you lord for the correction of the word thank you lord when the word comes and touches in my life instead of pushing back and rebelling i'm going to lift a hand and say thank you lord because you loved me enough to correct me pretty hard to sell that idea to a 10 year old i'll just interject this my son you know sister jerry one time years ago sitting with our golden lap he's out there her name was ginger and joel's got his arm around the dog and he's telling ginger my mom is so mean she doesn't love me she's just she's just mean the years go by my phone rings one day my son says son i'm sorry my son says dad what do you do with a rebellious 12 year old won't do his school work won't listen to his mother won't do anything won't clean his room what do you do and i said you should know and he's like oh okay i don't know if he whipped him or not but you see my brother and sister we gotta come to a place that we understand what god wants in our life you see we have to recognize the keeping power now if we ever thought that we have ever done something in and of ourselves we are mistaken it's one someone ever presents to you saints oh you are such strong christians you are this you are that you have done this the scripture says you have overcome the devil but the word bring balance in our life that we recognize it was christ in us that's overcoming the devil we wouldn't last five minutes in our natural flesh dealing with the devil i just watched a little video of some new child a little boy he's like seven or eight years old and he's already beating the masters at chess that's you and i playing life with the devil we think i can handle this i'm an adult the devil just tie you up checkmate you before you even realize what is happening you have to recognize now as paul is speaking to the galatians in 220 amen he says here i am crucified with christ do you catch what he's really saying catch the depth of this he says i've already submitted i've already died to myself i've already gave up every idea i had every emotion every intellectual idea everything i've had it has been killed laid on the cross crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i see starting to recognize this position as an overcomer in this hour my brother and sister we're not overcoming but we're overcoming sounds like a paradox doesn't it but we recognize i'm an overcomer why because christ is in me i'm standing here with god as the center of my life not my will lord but thy will be done and all of a sudden we're alive again amen we're not caught up in in the sin and debauchery of the world we live in amen yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh see how he brings it right back down he's not putting it all to the spiritual come on saints we're not talking about this we're a saint in church and the devil in business we're not we're not a devil on friday amen on the same sunday it comes right down the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me see their very foundation of our overcoming of power that is in us today now i want to just be real straight with you today any overcoming overcomers in the building today amen every one of us i don't care what yesterday was like what this morning was like you should be lifting a hand and saying i identify as an overcomer in jesus christ amen why because i've got him in me and he's already overcome in other words we could stop and throw the party that we're victorious but the time's not right for the party the time is not right for us to stop and celebrate reminds me of a story of some viking warriors i think they were on the isles there in what we would know as great britain and there was some people of the whatever they called them of that area and uh they struck down the lead or head viking the the i don't know the general they struck him down and they were all celebrating but what they didn't realize is they had just made the rest of the vikings angry that they had struck down their leader so they started to throw a party and celebrate and they were fallen upon by angry warriors my brother and sister i want to just put this home to you every time that satan tries to knock you down and put you out and you strike a blow to him it's not time to celebrate he's going to be angry he don't want to hear you praying for deliverance he doesn't want to hear you praying for a brother or sister for deliverance he doesn't want to hear you testifying of the power of god he doesn't want to hear you testifying of being healed he's going to come right back have you ever noticed have you ever noticed you have a wonderful church service wonderful time in your home wonderful experience and you're just glorifying god i always call it preachers monday because that seems to be how it affects the preachers but my brother and sister you can just go home thank you lord there was things i never even saw that were spoken lord i just know it was your mind and monday morning you get up and the pickup don't start and you make it to the farm shop and uh you forgot your keys and you go back and you this and that and it just goes on and on and on the day and when somebody calls you up hey god bless you brother paul how are you doing today lord is it lying if i tell them praise god god's with me today all is well am i a hypocrite can someone answer that for me no we're not because this is just the circumstance this is the mirage that satan paints and our emotions would be this day was a disaster do you know what i'm talking about yes sir yes sir and the life which i now live in the flesh come on i hope you're catching this when i live in the flesh not me the man in church oh praise god we stomped on the devil and we're all in control and we bound every spirit praise god worship worship worship worship now this life you live on monday morning now let me change the scripture just a little bit to make this point this what life i now live on monday morning i live by the faith of the son of god the life i live when the wheels fall off the wagon i live by the faith of the son of god the life i live when all pardon me i don't use these words but when all hell breaks loose in my house and the devil wants me to get in a boxing match with my wife he wants me to just think about whipping my kids he wants me to pick something up and throw it he wants me to be angry he wants me to stomp he wants me to slam doors he wants me to do all of these things this life i live in the flesh that's not the life he's talking about he's talking about i can withstand this i can come and put christ as the barrier the standard can be raised and i'm counting on the standard being raised i'm not saying wow praise god finally god raises standard he's always raising the standard but you gotta get behind it you can't say amen to the word and then walk away from the word expect that word to be the answer to your problem because you see this is for those who endure now my brother and sister if you don't endure if you quit this word doesn't apply to you this is the word that god has given to sons and daughters of god that can stand up and say though all hail assail me i shall not be moved what is that oh i'm anointed not to move know what the decision you're going to make and it's going to be devoid of emotion devoid of intellect devoid of someone else's opinion it's going to be devoid of all of this it's going to be something down inside of you that you say i'm going to stand and i don't care what happens i don't care what goes on in the world around me i don't care that they're trying to rip the nation to shreds all afraid of this afraid of that we'll read a quote here in just a few minutes you tell me whether it's accurate or not but you see my brother and sister this life or living in the flesh has to be by faith as the son of god if we're a christian it can be that we are here for a good word of encouragement we'll go home and just then fall back into our melancholy come on it's going to be a decision whether you're an overcomer or not it's not going to just happen you're not going to endure the temptation and trial of a laodicean age just because you know that there's a messenger in the land you're not going to do that just because you can say god sent a prophet you're not going to do that just because your mama and daddy have been christians forever you're gonna do that because you're gonna stand up and say the word is what i follow the word is what i look to i will not compromise on the word i will keep my eyes on the target hallelujah now let's look at a natural example looking in the world today there's many people very athletic you see when it comes to running this race some very fast in the short term hallelujah they give it their all but they're spent in a very short time i sometimes like to watch a little track and field i know this might sound weird but i've always been intrigued by uc and bolt i believe he's jamaican guys about from the floor down there about this tall got legs as tall as i am defies every logical terminology and association there is to a sprinter and he comes out of the blocks and every one of these other guys is already in front of him but the man knows how to give it his all and he gives it his all and he has a stride 40 percent longer than most sprinters but can he do that all the way around the track no sir he's a sprinter now i'm sure he could far exceed any of us all the way around the track but you see his passion is to go fast to go furious to give his all because he knows in 10 seconds it's over we've all met them haven't we yeah right they were in the house of god they were on the front row they were on the platform standing next to the preacher preach it brother but they're not here today and there's been those that can run the 800 meter or in that region and those that can run the mile but the real test of human endurance in the natural is the ultra marathon or the iron man where you have to run swim and ride now follow me as i share this with you you have to live it in church you have to live it at home you have to live it out in the world the ultra marathon of the believer come on are you with me this morning you can get in the house oh god you can jump up and down you can clap and sing and shout and you can do this but getting a knockdown drag out on the way home from church you know what that produces confuse children did i hear somebody just tear a band-aid open come on brothers and sisters it's not what we're called to do we're called to live it here we're called to live it at home god help us we're called to live it young people at school amongst your friends in the neighborhood maybe family that's not believers whatever it might be we're called to live it there you see not a sprint not a mid-range but to run the full gamut to be able to live it wherever see that's why the ultramarathon or the iron man has to express more than just short-term or mid-term it has to be the ultimate reminds me this took place in hawaii this man has won many championships they were swimming in the ocean as part of this ultra marathon iron man experience and a storm blew in and they had boats out there because there were people that were foundering in the water and they had to rescue them and and this man he he moved ahead of the pack as typical and he comes out and he finishes the race and he's so exhausted he rides up to the finish line and if someone hadn't caught him he would have fallen off of of the bicycle because they sometimes you know change this around and this one particular when they finish the race on a bicycle and uh they were like hi how did you do this how did you do this and he said the whole time oh i hope you get this the whole time he said i saw myself holding this trophy i saw myself here at the finish line just like i am holding this trophy that's the only thing that kept me going is someone's going to hold the trophy and i want it to be me and they're like wow that's incredible that's incredible and as i watched that i thought no that's the son of god as it were what we've been called to do we don't look at the short term we don't look at the midterm we don't look at the trials around us we don't look at fiery trials we're looking at the finish line we're looking at the promise that god has given us and it is a sure promise because he guaranteed it himself amen it is not something that just might happen could possibly happen it will happen because you will not by emotion you will not by your intellect it will not be by someone's opinion you yourself will say i'm going to stand on the word i made a vow to god i'm going to stand on that vow i will die trying hallelujah hallelujah galatians the fifth chapter stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free are we free this morning amen claim it saints be not entangled again see that's the devil's work he's he's got his ned out there he's constantly throwing it out trying to entangle you again i've heard this before my brother and sister now i don't know why i'm going here but i'll just go here yeah i've heard this before people like well my wife and i were just well these are believers these are message believers and they're like well we're just holding it together until the kids are all grown and then we'll probably divorce and i'm like why in the world would you do that well we haven't gone along for years and i said well why and he goes oh it's a long thing you know her family's all divorced my family's all divorced and it's just the way it is i said you've been sitting under the wrong teaching the wrong preaching the wrong anointing because this is a god that breaks all of those things this is a god that empowers anyone who will stand up and say i want what the lord wants and you can't find a place in the word of god that god says i will call you my bride i will call you my wife i will call you my own until no sir this work i have begun in you i will finish well let me just take that as i'll meet you at the finish line right god's not going to come and just dole out well i hope this don't hurt anybody's feelings god ain't going to have any 40 year olds living in the basement supported by someone else god's raising up a people a rugged people a word filled people a word that will stand the test come on right come on saints now look how paul brings out this struggle that takes place behold i paul saying to you that if you be circumcised christ shall profit you nothing now how is this right because under the law of moses they had to be circumcised for i testify again to every man that is circumcised he is better to do the whole law now which one of us can live the word of god never slip never fail are they here today no and they'll never be here christ has become no effect to you i've met him i'm gonna i'll tone this down i don't want to be offense i'll tone this down i don't know if any of you ever experienced this or somebody come and flip a message book open in front of you and tell you i've been following this for 50 years don't tell me okay i'm not going to tell you but you've now moved away from that and you're justified by your adherence not by revelation not by something that's real everything the prophet said i've done it can someone just go ahead and voice it real loud here who did you find in the bible that jesus spoke to that replied in that same manner rich young ruler i've done all of that that is saying oh help me that i could fulfill the words that you spoke to me said no done it all see he's now a debtor to the whole law the net result was is he couldn't keep the whole law or he wouldn't ended up over there asking for lazarus to bring him a drop of water what you know what it says who so is justified by the law i did it all you're fallen from grace for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith for in jesus christ neither circumstances availeth anything nor uncircumstances but faith which worketh by love you did run well come on saints let's not be speaking these words to each other you did run well which implies they're not running any longer come on it's happening amongst us don't don't stick your head in the sand it's happening amongst us people are taking their emotion their intellect their knowledge and opinions of others and they're holding them up and they're there and they're coming to the conclusion it's not worth running i can't run i can't do this i'm not going to do this come on it's righteousness by faith see neither circumstances availeth anything nor uncircum but faith which worketh by love ye did run well who who did hinder you you did hinder you oh no don't go blaming it on the preacher don't go blaming it on husband don't go blame it on a wife don't go blame it on somebody else you're the one who decides whether you run are you going to endure i'm not being too harsh am i i just want to tell it like it is i just want to tell it saints don't don't let these things come don't let these distractions come in don't let what somebody say they got no right your husband got no right your wife's got no right your children parents whatever it is no right my brother and sister you sit down you decide for you whether you're going to run or not who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth brother paul i'm sorry i'm going to have to scratch this out i'm going to have to write in d-e-v-i-l really the devil has no control or rights in the life of a son or daughter of god he is bound you will decide whether you are going to endure or you know o r let me get it o that way you can read my writing you decide or not it's no one else you know quite honestly i hope this peel's paid off for somebody because we got people that are offering all kinds of excuses of why they're pressing forward why they're not growing in faith they gotta this and that and that and that and that and that come on i'll tell you what let's just do that in reverse of what i said cut off everybody else's opinion first gone done opinion doesn't matter any longer influence others a husband not living right a wife not living right parents not living right let's cut it all back to what will you do will you endure will you press on or will you say lord i wanted to but come on somebody be happy and smile at me look i'm trying to encourage you to keep running amen reminds me of a story of a soldier went on to specialize training a ranger or something like that or uh seals or whatever it is and and he's out there and he's went as far he's all bloody and he dislocated his shoulder and they popped it back in joint and it's just throbbing and he's ready to call it quits i believe his navy seal and he goes over there and they have a bell hanging out there in front of the building and and he goes over there and he's just reaching up there to ring the bell and here come a drill sergeant and he gets over there and i'm going to mute this down you know because obviously they're worldly people in their language as a little brother but he's up there telling them oh yeah i always knew you were a woman i knew you wasn't enough i knew you couldn't do this i knew you were weakling i knew you were a penny waist i knew you were this and the guy's just getting madder and madder and madder the guy's like go ahead pull it pull it show us who you are pull it pull it i command you pull it and he looks at this guy and he's like i'm gonna kill this man one day he turns around and goes back and picks up the log again and goes on and after he graduates the drill sergeant comes to him and says hey look i hope you didn't take offense by those words but i knew if i didn't do that you was gonna pull that bell and you're too much of a man to quit oh reverse psychology reverse psychology i want to tell you saints you want to quit you don't want to endure just quit come on come on you don't serve god you don't want to be the fulfillment of the word of god you don't want to stand before the throne of god one day and worship him for eternity sitting with the saints you don't want to hug peter's neck and paul's neck and you don't want to do that come on just quit but if there's something inside of you that wants to stand there one day on the sea of crystal before the throne of almighty god and something in your heart is saying lord i want to stand for eternity and worship you i can't quit then endure then endure quit this little wimpy oh nobody loves me god don't love me i wish i was here i wished i was there i wish this was different i wish that was different forget that stand upon the promise of god and speak as the word said those things that are not as though they are and those things that are as though they are not stand up and claim what is your god-given gift hallelujah hallelujah does anybody need a band-aid hallelujah now look at this my brother and sister see his christ has become no effect of you who's justified by the law you're fallen from grace let's not become legalist message believers let's not come those people that that well i this and i that no come on stand on the word of god stand up amen amen hallelujah now it says here in verse 9 amen a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump now we often look at that in a negative sense but i'm telling you if we can just as it were just forgive me if we can take just a little bit of faith and we can stand as sons and daughters of god believing the promise not backing down from it we're gonna stand it and everybody's saying what's happened to brother so and so and we can come and then we get to inject just a little bit of leaven and it starts to move not talking about us saying look what i did we're talking about the power of god obedience to the word the life and the pretty soon we live in a little here in 11 and there and then the day comes that you're in your fiery trial and someone you shared with comes back and says have faith brother have faith sister stand up don't give up i can see the finish line it's right there i can see it just stand up come on in fact i'll tell you what i'll do have any of you seen that video that man i believe is from like nigeria or something like that what country over there always produces the the ethiopia or something i don't know kenya and the man had run and and something had happened in any way he was almost lame and he comes and he thinks it's the finish line and he stops have you seen that video clip and the runner behind him which was pretty close he wasn't a long ways behind him pretty close right behind him he comes up there and the finish line is not here to the back of the church away and he comes up there and he's stopped and he can't communicate with this guy they don't speak the same language and he's trying to motion to him and the guy's like no you know i finished no gets the guy's arm around his neck walks him right up to the finish line stops just short of it lets him walk across and everybody was like why did you do that you could be the winner and he said i couldn't face my mother if i did that now my brother and sister i want to know if you couldn't face mother how would be for sons and daughters of god to just walk past another brother or sister and say well if they're not going to make it if they're not going to make it i guess that's their problem if they're not going to make it they don't know where the finish is they're confused no i couldn't face my god come on saints we're not in this this is not paul the preacher picking on you this is paul the preacher trying to get you as it were figuratively to let me put your arm around my neck and let me help you amen do not do not my brother and sister do not give up do not let anything i say anything not mother not father not houses not lands right that's scriptural keep you from the house of lord the kingdom of god don't let that happen this call is not between you and mom and dad and god this is call is between you and god and run the race that god has set before you hallelujah hallelujah amen now look matthew 10 22. i don't even know what time it is saints oh my i was sure i'd be done by now you talk about what god's prepared you for look at this laodicean age and you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake don't expect this world out here to like you because you're a god-fearing christian the spirit is coming more and more and more they hate you they hate everything you stand for somebody read that last line for us finish line's right there are you gonna let allow to see him which is nothing but a lie are you going to let nothing but a lie stop you see you've got to make up your mind i'm going to endure to the end by god's grace i will endure to the end amen can you say that say it in your heart at least amen right christ in us that's what the word says right and we are in christ now look i'm not going to go read through all of this but i will just give a look because there's something that is catchy about this verse 1 for his mercy and earth forever verse 2 for his mercy endureth forever verse 3 for his mercy endureth forever for for his mercy endureth forever and we get to go down through every one of these scriptures my brother and sister and because his mercy endureth forever amen you've got no reason to quit you've got no excuse to quit you've got no insurmountable obstacle to quit for his mercy endureth forever hallelujah so just cry out for mercy you say brother paul i haven't been living it i can't live it i can't seem to get ahead i can't do this just cry out for mercy because his mercy endureth forever his mercy is sufficient for you and i the word of god in the new testament says his grace is sufficient but it's the same hallelujah so we look at that my brother and sister we stand upon that now look god's got confidence in you can i have just a few more minutes amen you see god chose his present age to manifest himself in this world through you see it's not it's not just that there's word out there it's not that we've got 1200 somethings we've got 1200 recordings we've got this we've got that no you see the greatest testimony that's taking place on the earth today it's you we either testify of a risen savior or we testify that it was insufficient for us to finish the race i'm telling you i don't want to be the one standing there telling god i couldn't do it he didn't give me enough mercy he didn't give me enough grace he didn't no i don't want to be that guy no sir i want to stand there saying lord i don't know how you view me lord but i'll tell you i've given all i could give and i believe your word and i just fought and i fought my fault and i'm battle scarred but lord here i am amen hallelujah now look at this do you see the twist that we're in now young people it's not applying to you right because god's called you to a different calling a higher calling so this is the counter type to you do you see the american youth what condition it's in that's the men and women of tomorrow yeah no i like to check news online los angeles vehicles full of people pulling up to a restaurant jumping out slashing people with knives beating them with sticks turning over tables one of them shows an individual clearly going up to a woman at a at a table there grabbing her drink from in front of her tell me if we them have something just a little bit prophetic in this right here no wonder jesus said except these days be short and no flesh would be saved therefore i'm basing my thoughts here that we're at the end time jesus the lord jesus shall come soon but the spirit of the day oh can you see take on your thinking can you see what's happened before this great onslaught coming on to bring the mark of the beast and to fulfill the scriptures come on our own congress here in the united states and look people say well it's united states everything's messed up in the united states i've been overseas in there before like well you know you know these islamics have it right america is the great satan i'm sorry as we go they go don't tell me that you come out with some new fashion i've been this in south america sister jerry and i be here and you just start to see the young people wearing some certain fashion here we fly down to south america and we're preaching in a little church it's in a village of two or three thousand people and they're wearing the same jeans now they might be knock off and they might have come from china but their exact same style the exact same fashion the exact same everything i'm telling you what goes here goes there there's no exemption can you see what's happening before this great onslaught what is an onslaught great outpouring a great pupish a great conquering of for this onslaught coming on to bring the mark of the beast and to fill the scripture by forcing the people after the hold is gotten just like it is in other countries we're not going to be come on let's think about america we're not going to be socialists like them and this and we're not going to be like this and we're not going to be like that we're americans we're we're exempt no you're not no sir just as beatlemania crept across the ocean so will all the spirits of this world come to our shore oh wait did not the prophet of god say paris is no longer the center or the pit of that fashion devil he said hollywood yes that's right so import export imagine forcing the people after the hold is gone just like it is in other countries force them into things that they do not accept praise god i would never ever submit myself to the mark of the beast well imagine that they went so far in our current deal i want you to catch the sign of the time we're going to create a passport and you won't be able to fly unless you've been vaccinated another liberal from somewhere back east there delaware or something's like well let's make it so they can't go from state to state unless they've been vaccinated and another one chimed in and said well maybe we should hook it to their credit card come on saints don't tell me the word of god is coming to pass that's right it's coming to pass and they don't agree people don't agree everyday people don't agree but the force pressure well we'll do this well that sounds terrible don't it won't be able to buy or sell without the mark of the beast but you know what that's not the biggest problem i think i'll just go ahead and take the mark and i'll serve god in secret won't work won't work god said come out from amongst her in other words make a stand what does that mean can i interpret that for you saints endure to the end amen don't take a compromise don't set for something else coming on to bring the mark of the beast and fulfill the scripture by forcing the people after the whole has gotten just like in other countries force them into things that they do not accept to cause the persecution and the boycott to come oh my oh my oh my this is scary i don't know if i can handle this this is scary this is scary this is scary this is scary but remember joseph's wife was already home can't you see america has fell for the glamour and the goddess and this and this pay the devil in the realm of flesh making a way for this to present itself amen i hope you understand this stay clear from it i don't care how many dds's and phds and ever what's behind it it's a lie for let every man's word be a lie and mine be true saith the lord for heavens and earth will pass away but my words will never pass away god's eternal word requires that men shall be born again anything short of that they are eternally lost come on my brother and sister we're not coming here in this message we're not coming here in this church to get to this stage of life and compromise no matter what church you belong to or where your name is or what you have did it's lost god's word shall never fail now look first john 5 4. let me hurry through this for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world hallelujah i know my daddy amen the lafontaine sing that song you're looking more like eddie or your father you're looking more like your father every day hallelujah what is that that's the very nature of the life of christ shining out this is a victory that overcometh the world even our faith come on don't don't think you've got to be come on oh this will be misunderstood don't think you've got to be some super christian don't think you've got to you know be a christian on steroids have faith in god have faith in god to be able to look at the word of god and say you know what the word says i believe that my flesh my thinking the conditions around me disagree but i look at the word and i say that's it that's the truth what's your faith in the word you know it's often misunderstood you know that if you'll speak to the mountain it'll be moved people are like where's that where's that kind of faith where's that kind of thing we don't see it we don't see it really i'm telling you i'm not going to explain it some of it's very personal i moved a couple mountains this last week come on saints don't get into some idea that you're going to go out here and find some hill in your way and just test it to see if it works i mean how it works you have things that come as it were in your life it's a mountain it's blocking your prayer life it's blocking you understanding the word of god reading your bible it's blocking you and you start to speak to those mountains and say you know what satan i rebuke you in the name of jesus christ that spirit leave and it leaves there was a mountain oh but that are you sure brother paul well i'll tell you i'll take the position brother donny reagan says said this quite a few years ago he said i believe if the day comes and there is a literal mountain in your way it will not be because you're like i'm here to prove this it will not be because you're convinced it will because you have a need and you have the faith to meet the need hallelujah might be a literal mountain in that day it's a good deal god don't give us that kind of authority because they're building houses all over the countryside out there by us and i'd be out there saying house be removed house be removed house be removed wow now look let's hurry on here you know what just seal this deal sister amy come on amen that's the reason she's so nervous frustrated as she is is because there's a hydrogen bomb and missiles of the air that could destroy the whole world one nation is scared of the other no matter how little it is they got these missiles that they claim well just one of them they can direct them by the stars and drop them anywhere in the world they want to sorry i just had to laugh this morning it's like we got some folks in the church that kind of identify as russian i'm sorry brother sergey i just this morning had a little chuckle you know it's not like we think amen you see there's this great anointings that are out there and these great spirits of the age and god has just chosen you see there's people there that love the lord just like you and i do believers there read their bible have faith in god but you see god chose and he ordained to place these as it were places of pieces on the chessboard you might say and you look at this so don't don't ever you know don't ever have i i tell you i'll just put it this way i run into a brother once that absolutely had an absolute bias against americans the brother looked me in the face and tell me you know what according to the prophet you guys are nothing but cannon fodder just to waste your evil i was like god bless you brother but my bible says it would be safe from every nation kindred and tongue so i'm claiming that position that even in wicked as america has become there is a bride of christ coming from america hallelujah hallelujah russia as i heard on the news the other day i probably just put my foot in my mouth but did that come out positive please [Music] the other day she claims she can destroy this nation and keep the atoms and other things and breaking up her nation we don't know what to do about it everyone is making these claims and it's so people's science has broken the gulf great laboratory until they're going to destroy themselves god lance always lets wisdom destroy himself god doesn't destroy anything god destroys himself by wisdom as he did at the beginning taking satan's wisdom instead of god's word now she knows she must give way she cannot stand it russia i believe will destroy this nation today if she thought that she could destroy it and then preserve herself any of those little nations could do it they're afraid but they know because they know that this world cannot stand in its orbit under such conditions so the world knows that her birth pains is so great she's got to give way there's going to be a new birth born at hand i'm thankful for that i'm tired of this one anyone who knows that there's a place of death and sorrow and all kinds of discrepancies and so forth and i'm glad that she has to give way and i'm glad that the time is at hand as john said of old even so come lord jesus now she must rot of course as i have said in order to bring a new birth what she has robbed into notice my brother she's totally rotten now look at this i want you to think about the day we're living in right now what's happening her politics and systems is just as rotten as they can be there isn't a sound bone in her in her world system her politics her religion politics whatever it is one says i'm a democrat i'm a republican i'm a methodist i'm a baptist why the whole thing is rotten to the court there's got to be something give way she can't stand and if you put a george washington or an abraham lincoln in every county in this united states it still couldn't come back it's beyond redemption there's only one thing that can help her that's the coming of the creator amen now i want you to look in the world we're in i don't look at these things negative i believe in being informed i believe in looking at this but my brother and sister when you have both sides they lie they manipulate they hide they deceive they kill they steal they destroy there's only one refuge that we have and the only way we find that refuge is endure scripture says there's a fountain hope open in the house of david you can't just talk about that fountain saints you've got to go get it the scripture says the house of the lord is our strong the name of the lord is our strong refuge you can't just talk about that you have to go get in it you have to endure to the end you know every person who runs the boston marathon and crosses the finish line receives a medallion did you know here a few years ago there were people who almost made the finish line i'll help you get this i read it i remember i kind of laughed and cried at the same time it's like what's happened to our nation they almost made it to the finish line they were within sight a few blocks of the finish line and they quit and they threatened if they did not receive that same medallion that they would sue them because they almost made it there's no such thing as almost eternal life there's no such thing as i almost finished this race endure saints i'm encouraging you today whatever comes your way whatever is happening in your life you might say brother paul you stepped on my toes i'm sorry i stepped on your toes but let the lord step on your heart and move you there's no place to quit no time to quit no reason to quit trust god stand on the word press forward amen do you know that it's the rules of the boston marathon as long as you are on the course they're supposed to keep the finish line up but there have been recorded times in history that people were so so long that everybody thought they were done they got wrong information they took this finish line down it's a cute story there was some people there one time this man was in desperate situation and people helped him and and went out there and walked with him and spoke encouraging words he had blood squishing out of his tennis shoes from blisters that broke and and there's no finish line and these people went and they found some stuff and they found some ribbon and they did it and they stood like on the tailgate of pickups or something and they held that because they wanted to honor this man that would finish as he stumbled across the line they had a little a little group there that gave an ovation but i'm here to tell you my brother and sister whether you are a little quicker than i am as it were whether one would pass to the other side we've had brothers sisters friends family that passed to the other side they finished the race already but god said you would finish and it doesn't matter how long it takes you to finish you will receive the same reward if you endure oh are we going to endure saints amen you've endured a lot of time with me this morning and i thank you for that but i'm telling you we're coming down we see so many signs that are happening in the world around us saints it's just a burden upon my heart don't quit now whatever you do right now i don't care how beautiful laodicea looks right now no matter how it praises you how it gives all of this adoration to you remember the devil's a liar keep pressing keep pressing hallelujah oh my oh my oh my we'll stop right here amen because i tell you what no can we go on only one scripture i want to read one more scripture okay for the grace of god that bring us salvation has appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world we can do it we can do it looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god in our savior jesus christ
