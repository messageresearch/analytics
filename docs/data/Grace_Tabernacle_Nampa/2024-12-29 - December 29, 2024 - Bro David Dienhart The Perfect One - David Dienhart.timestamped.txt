[44:42] he said he did not complete all his work
[44:45] while in his Earthly
[44:48] Ministry so now he works in and through
[44:52] the bride yes
[44:54] right now he works in and and through
[44:57] the
[45:01] bride she knows that she knows
[45:06] that for it was not yet time for him to
[45:10] do certain
[45:11] things that he must now
[45:18] do but he will now fulfill through the
[45:23] bride that work remember through his
[45:27] body as he's working that work which is
[45:29] left for this specific
[45:33] time so where who is he working in and
[45:36] through where is
[45:38] he he's in his
[45:40] bride who's she she's him all right now
[45:45] so for this specific time if the church
[45:49] has has been judged and they have judged
[45:53] themselves and have accepted the blood
[45:56] how can God judge a man that's perfectly
[45:58] totally
[46:01] sinless right
[46:04] amen how can God judge a man that's
[46:07] perfectly totally sinless we're speaking
[46:11] of this perfect one we're speaking of
[46:14] the new birth we're speaking of that
[46:16] which is growing in you to
[46:20] maturity
[46:22] amen it's him yes
[46:27] and I'm I'm very easily wanting to get
[46:29] ahead of myself and I got to bring
[46:30] myself back here so you listen carefully
[46:34] I know you are and we'll read we'll read
[46:36] some scriptures here in just a minute
[46:37] and refer to many
[46:40] scriptures but he's work he will now
[46:42] fulfill through the bride the work he's
[46:44] left for this specific time he will he
[46:48] will not you will he I'm talking about
[46:50] you I'm talking about the man not you
[46:52] will he
[46:53] will but he's going to work it through
[46:56] you yes amen isn't that what Romans
[46:59] 10811
[47:01] said that he would Quicken your mortal
[47:03] body and the prophet said rising of the
[47:05] Sun that he would bring your body
[47:07] subject to his word amen what is the
[47:11] evidence of the Holy Ghost then his
[47:12] working by the word through the word in
[47:15] you
[47:18] yes why is that because you had an ear
[47:20] to hear the word yeah amen amen all
[47:23] right now so getting back to this he
[47:26] said how can God judge a man that's
[47:28] perfectly totally sinless you say
[47:30] there's no such a person it depends on
[47:33] which side of the skin you're looking at
[47:36] there is no such a person that is
[47:38] David's not
[47:41] perfect the man the The Vessel you live
[47:44] in this flesh man is actually just a
[47:46] pest house yeah that's not
[47:50] perfect amen is that right there's only
[47:53] one perfect that's the Holy Ghost the
[47:55] word revealed in you
[47:58] amen amen that'll always come back to
[48:02] and do the works of the word in the
[48:05] place and in the and in the position
[48:07] you've been called to work
[48:09] it and that takes faith and that's his
[48:14] faith amen amen because the believer is
[48:17] the faith of God the faith of god is
[48:19] perfect faith brother brandom called it
[48:22] Eternal Faith
[48:25] amen amen
[48:27] so the believer is we're talking about
[48:29] not just a believer that says the
[48:31] believer but the believer the real
[48:32] believer is the faith of God Amen that's
[48:37] moving in you am
[48:41] amen now who you want to
[48:43] trust you're born again who you want to
[48:46] trust Jesus
[48:48] Christ the new birth yes or your faults
[48:52] and failures and your mistakes and how
[48:54] you feel and how you look by with These
[48:58] Eyes you can't judge things by how you
[49:01] look in these eyes you judge things by
[49:04] how what you look at through the
[49:07] word amen all right so now he said
[49:11] there's no every born-again believer
[49:13] every True Believer is perfectly
[49:15] absolutely sinless before God he's not
[49:18] trusting in his Works he's trusting in
[49:20] the blood of Jesus that his confessions
[49:22] dropped
[49:24] into amen now in that blood is life The
[49:28] Germ the blood The Germ you're born by
[49:30] you are born by the blood of God right
[49:34] cuz the germ holds the blood I mean the
[49:36] blood holds the germ and that's the
[49:39] life amen so you're born by the blood if
[49:43] the life comes through that blood what's
[49:45] it going to produce Jesus Christ the
[49:47] same yesterday and today and
[49:49] forever that's the new
[49:52] birth all right now the Bible says so
[49:55] see he that is born of God does not
[49:58] commit sin amen see he that's born of
[50:02] God does not commit sin for he cannot
[50:05] sin let's say that again he that's born
[50:07] of God what is who is he that's born of
[50:10] God what are you that you're born of God
[50:13] who are you him
[50:17] amen it's revealed in you now you talk
[50:20] about the real you like Brother Paul's
[50:22] been saying who are you the real you if
[50:24] you realize who you really are yeah I've
[50:27] just read it to you here it's Jesus
[50:29] Christ the new birth yes amen amen now
[50:33] how's that how's that how's he going to
[50:35] make himself known what's the
[50:36] identification of that by hearing and
[50:38] receiving the word for your season by
[50:40] genuine
[50:43] Revelation amen you can't manufacture
[50:46] Revelation you can't get Revelation you
[50:48] can't pump yourself up to Revelation
[50:50] it's sovereignly given to you by God
[50:53] amen
[50:54] righten amen you can't produce it right
[50:58] you can't make it happen that's right
[51:01] it's given by the hearing of the
[51:04] word and he gives it to you and that is
[51:07] the evidence that you're his son you're
[51:09] his
[51:10] seed there's no other evidence you have
[51:13] the ability to hear the word for the
[51:15] hour the season with a genuine
[51:17] revelation of what that word is
[51:19] speaking because how's it going to be
[51:21] identified in the
[51:24] word it's just not say I have Revel
[51:27] and then there's no manifestation
[51:28] there's nothing to bring it back into
[51:30] the
[51:32] word it's going to be manifest going to
[51:34] be confirmed by the
[51:37] word amen amen all right now let's turn
[51:42] over here to to St John
[51:47] 3 so why can't why can't the the he
[51:50] that's born of God commits sin because
[51:52] the seed of God remains in
[51:55] him here here's the reason why the seed
[51:58] of God remains in
[52:03] him he is born of
[52:05] God the rain remember the rain falls on
[52:08] both just and unjust the same anointing
[52:12] of the Holy Spirit when it falls upon
[52:14] his own seed will Quicken that seed and
[52:17] that seed must produce what it is it
[52:19] must bring forth what it is it'll
[52:21] produce of its own kind that's right
[52:24] that's how you know yes that's right
[52:26] yeah amen all right so it the seed of
[52:30] God remains in him he's born of God and
[52:33] and other words the rain is falling on
[52:35] his seed word quickened it's birthed
[52:38] yeah
[52:40] amen all right and now what's happening
[52:44] and I'll get to this a little bit later
[52:45] as we go into the message we're laying
[52:47] now in the presence of the
[52:49] sun what's happening we're ripening yes
[52:52] Amen to what maturity adoption yes amen
[52:56] full
[52:58] placing amen right through the body
[53:01] change amen all
[53:04] right John St John 3:6 Jesus said that
[53:09] which is born let's back up to verse 5
[53:11] verily verily I say you except a man be
[53:13] born of water and of the spirit he
[53:16] cannot enter into the kingdom of
[53:21] God another place he said you cannot see
[53:23] cannot see the kingdom of God
[53:27] amen hey he does says that in verse
[53:29] three except a man be born again he
[53:31] cannot see the kingdom of God verse six
[53:34] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[53:39] that's right I'm going to bring a
[53:40] separation here amen CU he brought the
[53:43] separation Jesus himself brought the
[53:45] separation here that's exactly right he
[53:48] that's born of the flesh is flesh
[53:50] there's every one of us in here have
[53:52] been born of the
[53:53] flesh natural birth is a flesh
[53:58] birth are you with me it's a okay you're
[54:02] there's nobody in here that's not born
[54:04] of the flesh that's
[54:06] right but when that open when that word
[54:10] inside of you becomes open that seed
[54:12] that elect
[54:13] seed then you say as the prophet said
[54:16] that little spot of ET of life in
[54:18] communion message communion 1965 that
[54:21] little spot of eternal life is who I am
[54:23] I'm therefore no longer the son of
[54:25] Charles and AB
[54:27] branam are you with me you you've raised
[54:31] to a higher position you realize now who
[54:33] you really are cuz all you knew when you
[54:35] were born you were born in sin shape and
[54:37] iniquity come in the world speaking lies
[54:39] your righteousness is filthy rags
[54:41] there's none good no not one right so he
[54:44] that's born of the flesh is flesh
[54:49] but he which is born of the spirit
[54:52] capital s look at your Bible he which is
[54:55] born of the spirit is Spirit or little
[54:58] God yeah not another
[55:02] himself amen so he that's born of the
[55:05] flesh is flesh he that's born of the
[55:07] spirit is
[55:10] spirit all right now now let's go over
[55:13] here go to First Corinthians now
[55:17] remember now remember that Jesus also
[55:20] said in and you don't have to turn to it
[55:22] but in Matthew 5:48 that be ye perfect
[55:26] therefore for perfect as your father
[55:28] which is in heaven is perfect and
[55:30] brother bam said there's no way that you
[55:32] as a man and I as a man humanly can do
[55:35] that we can't make oursel perfect
[55:37] because we're imperfect but there is a
[55:39] perfect one and that comes through the
[55:41] blood that's the germ life in that blood
[55:44] that is laid that is brought forth from
[55:47] the blood quickens that Believer by a
[55:50] true baptism is that right the water
[55:53] went out the rain went out it went for
[55:55] the farmer that plant the seed of course
[55:57] we know there was another one come
[55:59] behind him planting yeah another seed
[56:04] right but right now we're talking about
[56:07] the original planter yeah that planted
[56:10] his seed right the one that went
[56:13] first all right and he planted a seed
[56:16] and the rain came and it quickened that
[56:18] seed and if he planted wheat it will be
[56:21] wheat if that one behind him planted
[56:23] wild wheat it will be wild wheat so
[56:26] close it would deceive the elect if
[56:28] possible right is that right it's that
[56:32] close why because they're both Anointed
[56:35] with the genuine Holy
[56:38] Ghost but one the Holy Ghost is
[56:40] anointing the word and the other one
[56:43] it's an anointing another seed yeah yet
[56:46] both anointed in their Spirit their
[56:48] second realm of their Spirit to do signs
[56:51] and wonders shout everything and we all
[56:53] believe in that I'm shouting pretty loud
[56:55] right now I believe in shouting I
[56:57] believe in in those gifts I believe in
[57:00] all of that but that can be
[57:01] impersonated yes right but this word
[57:05] this open Word of the third pole cannot
[57:07] be impersonated because it's a person
[57:10] and he Satan can't be that
[57:13] person Hallelujah am isn't that right
[57:17] all right so so it's another
[57:22] person and we're not talking about this
[57:24] person I'm talking about a person the
[57:25] word eternal life is a person that's
[57:29] right amen amen hallelujah I can't
[57:33] hardly wait I want to get ahead of
[57:35] myself so bad I just got to hold back a
[57:36] little bit maybe I'll have to hurry up
[57:38] and get ahead of myself to make it done
[57:39] in time but listen now so he said in 1
[57:45] Corinthians
[57:50] 15 and we'll read verse 45 just said he
[57:53] that's born of spirit is spirit let me
[57:55] also bring you back to another scripture
[57:56] while you while you've turned to that
[57:58] place but in 1 Corinthians 6:17 it said
[58:02] he that's joined to the
[58:05] Lord that's a
[58:07] union are you with me that's a union
[58:10] yeah the Bible said we'll come to a
[58:11] minute you are his workmanship created
[58:14] in Christ
[58:18] Jesus amen so it's a union you're in
[58:21] Union with
[58:22] him he that is joined to the Lord
[58:27] is one
[58:29] Spirit and the Lord is that spirit and
[58:33] where the spirit of the Lord is there is
[58:36] Liberty Hallelujah where the SP I just
[58:39] love this where the spirit of the Lord
[58:42] is I just pointed to you where he's at
[58:45] he is the word moving living in you
[58:50] revealed he's never changed his that's
[58:53] all he always has been right right
[58:57] amen as he's in you United himself with
[59:00] you and you are that one spirit let me
[59:02] just give you a quote on the things that
[59:04] are to be you the real you the you he
[59:07] said is the spirit of God in you yes
[59:11] amen then why pay attention to faults
[59:14] and mistakes and failures just commit
[59:16] them under the blood know the blood no
[59:18] you're under the blood because you've
[59:19] been identified under the blood by the
[59:22] revelation of Jesus Christ in you amen
[59:26] right and let me just jump ahead a
[59:28] little bit you're identified in the
[59:30] Rapture you're identified in the
[59:32] resurrection and life amen that's your
[59:35] identification amen hallelujah now we're
[59:38] just building that okay now as we go on
[59:43] here so in Corinthians 1 Corinthians
[59:47] 15:45 he
[59:49] said and so it is
[59:53] written the first man Adam
[59:56] was made a living
[59:59] Soul are you with me yes the first man
[1:00:02] Adam was made a living
[1:00:05] Soul the last Adam known as the second
[1:00:09] Adam the second the last Adam was made a
[1:00:13] quickening spirit amen I don't know why
[1:00:16] it is every time I get up to the
[1:00:18] platform to preach my nose
[1:00:21] runs
[1:00:23] but we all have peculiar
[1:00:28] ities all right let me read that again
[1:00:32] because this is very
[1:00:34] important the second the last the second
[1:00:36] Adam was made a quickening spirit yes
[1:00:39] now watch as it goes
[1:00:41] on and I just said he just said you are
[1:00:46] the spirit of God in you yes what is

[1:12:15] blood of Christ as with the lamb without
[1:12:17] blemish and without spot who verily was
[1:12:19] for ordained before the foundation of

[1:13:17] one is one that's God himself the other
[1:13:21] is
[1:13:23] human amen
[1:13:25] all right but if that human love isn't
[1:13:28] governed by The Godly love it's going to
[1:13:31] go

[1:14:01] word I can sound very unlovable you can
[1:14:05] too but that does does that mean you
[1:14:08] have no love

[1:25:24] creation it's God himself through the
[1:25:27] spoken
[1:25:29] word creating himself in
[1:25:32] you amen not another creation see God's
[1:25:36] a spirit he didn't create himself but he
[1:25:38] comes and creates himself in you just
[1:25:40] like he created himself in Mary yeah but
[1:25:43] not the same way that was natural this
[1:25:46] is a
[1:25:48] spiritual amen are you with me but
[1:25:50] before we meet him in the air we have
[1:25:54] that same Holy Ghost anointing this
[1:25:57] word and we're bringing through us the
[1:26:00] promised son yeah now think of that just
[1:26:03] like
[1:26:05] Sarah amen just like
[1:26:09] Mary Mary was the outside was the shuck
[1:26:13] Mary the
[1:26:14] shuck amen are you with me Mary
[1:26:17] outwardly she had Shu but inwardly she
[1:26:20] had the very creative act of God through
[1:26:22] the word God created himself a body the
[1:26:24] blood cell came
[1:26:26] in into Mary and Mary bore but now
[1:26:30] brother R said that that life that life
[1:26:33] well I read it right here it's seed time
[1:26:35] or bride time the Shucks are dead yeah
[1:26:38] amen the Shucks are dead all right the
[1:26:41] Shucks are dried up the Virgin what is
[1:26:44] this virgin word
[1:26:46] time not
[1:26:48] touched not touched by what not it's a
[1:26:51] virgin word time not touched and you go
[1:26:54] goes on to say no
[1:26:56] manhandling
[1:26:58] yeah okay then quit trying to manhandle
[1:27:02] it
[1:27:05] yeah because you create your own little
[1:27:08] denominational system right by trying to
[1:27:11] manhandle this word leave it alone
[1:27:13] that's right follow it obey it even
[1:27:17] though it's radical to your
[1:27:19] human
[1:27:22] thinking right uh-huh brother Brown said
[1:27:25] he does things in an unusual way in an
[1:27:28] unusual time in unusual
[1:27:30] circumstances he's always been that way
[1:27:32] he'll continue to do it he'll even he'll
[1:27:34] even change you to do things that are
[1:27:36] radical to your own human thinking right
[1:27:39] but follow
[1:27:41] him if you know where you whom you
[1:27:43] believed you know he's in you then
[1:27:45] follow him quit trying to quit trying to
[1:27:48] judge it by yourself right take his word
[1:27:52] and go follow it deny yourself
[1:27:57] right other words take up the cross die
[1:28:00] to your
[1:28:01] own I'm going to say it like way a long
[1:28:03] time ago that that a minister in the
[1:28:06] message said it your own stinking
[1:28:12] thinking yeah did die die to
[1:28:15] it you can't have any confidence in your
[1:28:18] own ideas and your reasoning if it
[1:28:20] leaves the word right reasoning is okay
[1:28:23] as long as it agrees with the word word
[1:28:25] but you've been given the Holy Ghost to
[1:28:26] know whether it does or doesn't that's
[1:28:28] right those without the Holy Ghost don't
[1:28:30] know the
[1:28:32] difference are you with me
[1:28:38] amen all right remember Pentecost made a
[1:28:41] way for the Holy Ghost himself to come
[1:28:43] right down back to the word again that's
[1:28:47] we're right right back here back to the
[1:28:49] word again the word is Manifest in flesh
[1:28:55] okay whose flesh mine if no one else in
[1:28:59] this room it's mine but I know there's
[1:29:02] others in this room amen it's yours also
[1:29:05] and together under that one Spirit we
[1:29:07] are united as
[1:29:08] one you may be different than me I may
[1:29:11] be different than you in the way the
[1:29:12] word is being manifested or preached
[1:29:14] even through me I differ from other
[1:29:16] preachers that I can't be what I
[1:29:17] differently than what I am
[1:29:21] right I'm different but oh am I
[1:29:28] happy Hallelujah all right so now now
[1:29:32] look so let's go on Virgin word time not
[1:29:36] touch it's a virgin remember a virgin
[1:29:38] word time if you put it in the hands of
[1:29:40] a denomination it sure won't be virgin
[1:29:43] it'll be manhandled time you get to it
[1:29:45] but God's church is not manhandled God's
[1:29:48] church is not touched by denomination
[1:29:50] you say hallelujah brother sister I'm
[1:29:52] telling you you can make your own little
[1:29:55] denomination and walk in it if you want
[1:29:56] to but I refuse to do that I've come out
[1:29:59] of the darkness of that spirit I refuse
[1:30:02] to let that Spirit have any control over
[1:30:04] me amen
[1:30:06] amen right and that spirit will always
[1:30:09] question the word of God and form its
[1:30:11] little opinion about
[1:30:15] it and it's a dominating female Catholic
[1:30:20] spirit that tries to come in and exist
[1:30:23] around the message yeah it's the same
[1:30:26] spirit I could take the rest of this
[1:30:28] sermon and just preach
[1:30:30] that but get us out of it Lord don't let
[1:30:34] us come under that don't make the
[1:30:37] mistake that Eve did and she stopped to
[1:30:39] listen
[1:30:41] right to his knowledge to to the to the
[1:30:44] tree of partake of the tree of Good and
[1:30:47] Evil that's the problem with it they're
[1:30:49] trying to mix it today they're trying to
[1:30:51] mix things together instead of Leaning
[1:30:53] it with the word and let the word
[1:30:54] declare itself you try to mix everything
[1:30:57] together and by mixing it you're
[1:30:59] bringing a spirit of confusion and God
[1:31:01] is not the author of
[1:31:06] confusion
[1:31:10] amen my peace I give to you my
[1:31:13] leadership I give to you I word I give
[1:31:16] to

[1:31:20] trying to mix
[1:31:22] it amen try to live over here and try to
[1:31:26] live over here and bring that Spirit of
[1:31:29] confusion nobody knows where they're
[1:31:34] standing amen just bring the word of
[1:31:38] Truth don't try to live between these
[1:31:40] two
[1:31:43] Realms either going to live in one or
[1:31:45] the
[1:31:47] other amen so let's let's decide right
[1:31:51] now yeah we're going to live by the word
[1:31:54] this revealed opened
[1:31:56] up I don't care how radical and how much
[1:31:58] van OD ball it is and how strange it may
[1:32:00] be you're the final voice to the final
[1:32:02] age amen right you're the final voice to
[1:32:06] the final age yes under your messenger
[1:32:09] which is the Holy Ghost himself to a
[1:32:12] Vindicated Prophet his word is the
[1:32:14] perfect interpretation of the word for
[1:32:17] this
[1:32:18] season is that not what Micah came back
[1:32:21] and answered 400 prophets with is what
[1:32:23] elah before him
[1:32:25] said and Elijah said and why they had
[1:32:28] the word oh my we have the word
[1:32:30] hallelujah they had the word why the
[1:32:32] word said that they give that Syria
[1:32:34] that's not their land that's our land
[1:32:36] that was the word but it was out of
[1:32:38] season for them to take it now at that
[1:32:41] time it was out of season how' they know
[1:32:43] it was out of season they all agreed it
[1:32:45] was in season see they were coming back
[1:32:47] the word so does the foolish virgin have
[1:32:50] the word but they don't have oil in
[1:32:52] their vessel to mix with that
[1:32:58] word that's right they brought their
[1:33:00] lamps Thy word is a lamp to my feet they
[1:33:03] had the lamp but they didn't have the
[1:33:05] oil in the vessel
[1:33:08] right to make the word like so they had
[1:33:10] no discernment no revelation of the word
[1:33:12] for the season they couldn't receive it
[1:33:17] right oh yes they were word material
[1:33:20] they were Sanctified material is that
[1:33:22] right but they didn't have the
[1:33:24] oil in the vessel the the the the real
[1:33:31] virgin wise virgin took oil in they had
[1:33:35] their lamp and had oil in their vessel
[1:33:39] yeah
[1:33:41] right there's the difference y good
[1:33:44] people yes will that foolish virgin real
[1:33:48] sanctified people get eternal life yes
[1:33:50] at the white Throne judgment but the
[1:33:53] bride doesn't stand before judgment
[1:33:55] she's judging she's in the throne right
[1:33:59] not standing Before the Throne she's in
[1:34:01] the
[1:34:02] throne there are those tribulation
[1:34:04] Saints out there on a sea of glass mixed
[1:34:06] with fire that are standing there before
[1:34:09] the throne right but they're in
[1:34:11] Tribulation they're in judgment
[1:34:13] Revelation
[1:34:16] 15 amen
[1:34:19] yeah amen the bride's gone yeah when
[1:34:22] that when that sister in as clear as
[1:34:24] glass that bride's gone showing no blood
[1:34:27] there anymore the sacrifice finished for
[1:34:28] the bride she's
[1:34:30] gone the fourth chapter tells her the
[1:34:34] message tells her she's under Rapture
[1:34:36] already she's
[1:34:38] gone
[1:34:40] spiritually already we're gone
[1:34:44] naturally we've got to catch up to
[1:34:47] it are you with
[1:34:50] me all right
[1:34:53] it must be spiritual Faith first to see
[1:34:56] the manifestation of a body change
[1:34:58] you've got to have it first in
[1:35:00] faith it's got to be revealed first
[1:35:03] everything that God did it was a
[1:35:05] revelation
[1:35:06] first yeah amen are you with me even
[1:35:09] your healing is a revelation right and
[1:35:11] then you see the manifestation of that
[1:35:13] Revelation because Faith makes a channel
[1:35:16] for the word to be manifested
[1:35:18] through hey man I don't know how I'm
[1:35:20] getting on that but evidently somebody
[1:35:22] needs it oh my all
[1:35:26] right watch this Hallelujah this Bride

[1:35:45] believe it I know it's the truth it'll
[1:35:47] not be touched no man handling
[1:35:50] yeah David you put your name in it had
[1:35:53] not one thing to do with that seed being
[1:35:56] in
[1:35:59] me amen not one thing to do with it
[1:36:01] right still
[1:36:03] doesn't it's nothing to do with David
[1:36:06] that's
[1:36:08] right I'm going to read a scripture out
[1:36:10] of Romans 9 we'll show it to you if it
[1:36:12] didn't have anything to do with Jacob it
[1:36:14] doesn't have anything to do with you if
[1:36:16] it didn't have anything to do with Esau
[1:36:17] it didn't have anything to do with he he
[1:36:19] couldn't receive
[1:36:20] it Jacob was Jacob Esau was Esau
[1:36:24] but one was seed the other
[1:36:27] wasn't neither boy did anything in fact
[1:36:30] brother Bram said that Esau was a better
[1:36:32] moral man than Jacob now where are your
[1:36:38] judgment he made why Jacob was a Shyer a
[1:36:43] deceiver until he was changed that's
[1:36:48] right and man what did he meet out there
[1:36:50] in panu who' he wrestle with right yeah
[1:36:54] how did he come out of panu and come out
[1:36:56] of Dame's man he was the new
[1:36:58] creature he he he
[1:37:00] limped he limp By The Mark of the Holy
[1:37:03] Ghost and met him in his body he was a
[1:37:06] weakling but the word said and Paul said
[1:37:10] Jesus told him my strength is made
[1:37:12] perfect in your weakness
[1:37:16] yeah right my strength is made perfect
[1:37:19] in your weakness Hallelujah so quit
[1:37:21] trying to give me excuses of your
[1:37:23] weakness you're already weak and were
[1:37:25] meant to be weak then submit yourself to
[1:37:28] the new
[1:37:31] birth and let it grow laying in the
[1:37:33] presence of the sun eat the open book
[1:37:36] yeah right with that John ate the open
[1:37:39] book and it was in his mouth sweet as
[1:37:41] honey and when he had eaten it it made
[1:37:42] his belly bitter it made him limp he was
[1:37:46] marked probably the more he went and the
[1:37:48] more he grew in the word the more
[1:37:50] mistakes he made right
[1:37:55] yeah amen I mean I mean that would you
[1:37:57] just stop and think about that The
[1:37:59] Closer you get to God it seems like the
[1:38:00] more the more because why because it's
[1:38:03] so unveiled to you every little thing
[1:38:04] that's not light yeah is
[1:38:08] known and when the light uncovers what
[1:38:10] you're doing and you need to change it
[1:38:12] you've got a decision right now the
[1:38:14] light's shining on your pathway you have
[1:38:15] a decision you will either accept it or
[1:38:17] call me crazy
[1:38:20] am you'll either accept it or walk in
[1:38:22] the light God's given us so you're not
[1:38:24] going to walk in the light why because
[1:38:27] you're not able maybe not able and maybe
[1:38:29] you are but you just need to realize
[1:38:31] you're either able to receive it or
[1:38:33] you're not able to receive it well I'm a
[1:38:35] good person that is not going to put you
[1:38:37] in the
[1:38:37] Rapture there's more people that are
[1:38:40] better than I am far better as far as
[1:38:42] good
[1:38:46] concerned don't you look at your
[1:38:48] goodness as any evidence that you're
[1:38:50] going
[1:38:51] in because I'll tell I tell you there's
[1:38:53] none good no not one Jesus himself said
[1:38:56] why call me good why there's none good
[1:38:59] but
[1:39:01] God he knew who he was so do you bride
[1:39:06] you're realizing who you are your
[1:39:08] position you have been POS positionally
[1:39:10] placed in Christ you ought to thank him
[1:39:14] for that every moment of the day that
[1:39:16] you have been positionally placed in
[1:39:19] Christ and Christ in you is God's Great
[1:39:23] Revel
[1:39:25] amen amen amen amen all right now see
[1:39:30] I'm not going to get through this I
[1:39:31] don't know what time it is but
[1:39:33] anyway uh if you want to put the time up
[1:39:36] you
[1:39:37] can and maybe you better
[1:39:41] not all right all right all right I've
[1:39:45] already talked about the blood Ephesians
[1:39:47] chapter 2 let's we'll come back to
[1:39:49] Philippians in a minute again the Lord
[1:39:52] willing if iians chapter
[1:39:55] 2
[1:39:58] verse uh 8 for by grace are you saved
[1:40:02] through faith if you want to go to to
[1:40:04] Romans 4 and I'll just I'll just I'll
[1:40:07] just quote it to you okay the reason
[1:40:09] it's revealed to you because in Romans 4
[1:40:26] I can't find it well let me just a
[1:40:32] moment oh yeah there it Roman
[1:40:35] 4:16 let me just quote it therefore it
[1:40:37] is a
[1:40:40] faith that it might be by
[1:40:45] Grace Grace is not something you merited
[1:40:49] right Grace is the Divine enablement of
[1:40:51] God
[1:40:53] right Amen brother brand made it very
[1:40:55] simple if you need your back scratch
[1:40:57] I'll scratch it whether mine needs it or

[1:41:03] enabled by God to be able to receive and
[1:41:06] to hear you're a special class of people
[1:41:08] God's enabled you given the ability to
[1:41:10] hear the word for the season and how do
[1:41:13] you hear the word for the season it's
[1:41:15] revealed see god holds that Revelation
[1:41:18] the difference between Cain and Abel was
[1:41:21] Revelation brother Brandon said that was
[1:41:23] was the only
[1:41:26] difference that's what made him offer a
[1:41:28] different
[1:41:30] sacrifice amen one by Revelation the
[1:41:33] other by his own intellectual knowledge
[1:41:35] of his father his religious knowledge
[1:41:38] thought God dwelt in Beauty thought it
[1:41:40] was an apple that eve
[1:41:43] eat if you think that let me just tell
[1:41:46] you something why did he have to be
[1:41:49] virgin born yes sir to take the stain of
[1:41:51] sin off he had to come through a woman
[1:41:55] because the fall came through a
[1:41:57] woman amen all right she received
[1:42:00] another she conceived another
[1:42:02] seed amen Abel only knew her
[1:42:07] twice once and then again after the
[1:42:11] killing of Abel yeah he hath appointed
[1:42:15] to me another seed and stood of
[1:42:18] able all right you see so we know that I
[1:42:22] many know that could be preached on I
[1:42:24] preached on it here before quite a
[1:42:25] number of two or three years ago two
[1:42:27] seeds if you remember that all right see
[1:42:31] a lot of the young people don't know
[1:42:33] that age to brother Paul there's a lot
[1:42:35] of young people don't know what
[1:42:38] happened I remember my daughter sitting
[1:42:41] back there I remember my children just
[1:42:42] about the age of 13 I didn't place it
[1:42:44] there but when they begin to know the
[1:42:46] difference between right and wrong and I
[1:42:48] had to bring just in Simplicity what
[1:42:50] happened in the garden
[1:42:57] you see see because that's the great
[1:43:00] issue today is that
[1:43:03] adultery that's right you know that okay
[1:43:07] okay we'll get off of that
[1:43:09] but but what I had my thought there
[1:43:13] going uh Ephesians 2 let's just go back
[1:43:16] to that for by Grace there you are by
[1:43:17] grace are you saved if by faith Abraham
[1:43:20] received with by faith that It Be by
[1:43:22] grace it was Grace what was the grace of
[1:43:25] God to Abraham that he revealed himself
[1:43:28] to
[1:43:29] Abraham amen that was Grace look what8
[1:43:33] says for by grace are you saved through
[1:43:36] what faith yeah okay so by grace are you
[1:43:40] saved through faith God gives you
[1:43:42] because of what's laying inside of you
[1:43:44] he reveals himself
[1:43:48] right connects with the seed do you
[1:43:50] understand what I'm saying by Grace it's
[1:43:52] by grace you never see so David's not in
[1:43:54] it MH by Grace am I saved through faith
[1:43:58] through the working of God himself
[1:44:00] through faith
[1:44:03] amen and that and what what's that that
[1:44:07] that Faith that's not of
[1:44:09] yourselves it is the gift of God what's
[1:44:15] the gift of God eternal
[1:44:18] life so it is the gift of God now
[1:44:22] brother brandham made a statement here
[1:44:23] and now let's read it here in Ephesians
[1:44:25] chap 2 as we go on here verse 10 or
[1:44:28] verse 9 not of Works L any man should

[1:44:38] world to you
[1:44:40] that's amen are you with me all right
[1:44:45] not of Works lest any man should boast

[1:46:44] back the faith of God okay see in Union
[1:46:49] with Christ yours workmanship you are a
[1:46:51] new creature of God Amen that's verse 10
[1:46:54] the faith of God in the word is the real
[1:46:57] believer the word living in the word
[1:47:00] living and in action is the bride she's
[1:47:03] the Living Word now you can find that
[1:47:06] right in Hebrews 12 the word is living
[1:47:08] and operative quicker more powerful than
[1:47:10] a two-edged sword living and operative
[1:47:13] living and in action the prophet said
[1:47:15] she would be the word Christ in you
[1:47:17] makes you the complete revelation of the
[1:47:19] whole thing Christ in you Christ in the
[1:47:22] world makes the word the complete
[1:47:24] revelation of Christ Christ in you will

[1:47:33] word it makes you the complete so we
[1:47:36] have the Capstone Revelation for the
[1:47:40] Rapture amen because now the mystery
[1:47:43] that was in God the mystery of Revel the
[1:47:45] message of Revelations 107 the mystery
[1:47:48] has been
[1:47:50] opened and you see and it's not

[1:48:09] him and when he went to Calvary he went
[1:48:11] with you in him and the smiting of
[1:48:13] Christ was for a purpose just like it
[1:48:15] was
[1:48:16] Adam the mystery of Adam the mystery in
[1:48:19] Adam was now made manifest yes and it
[1:48:22] wasn't a different Adam it was Mrs
[1:48:25] Adam

[1:48:33] now revealed or made manifest the
[1:48:35] promise the promise was in the word
[1:48:39] right and she became the very unveiling
[1:48:42] of himself she was the Capstone
[1:48:44] revelation of that of of

[1:49:27] Pentecost they had to come to a New
[1:49:30] Creation do you recognize what that is
[1:49:33] then she by that new creation laying in
[1:49:35] that promised word gained Faith to be
[1:49:37] able to
[1:49:39] conceive and when she conceived she
[1:49:42] brought forth a natural Seed of

[1:51:08] denominational tradition you've left
[1:51:10] that old tradition we are now become we
[1:51:12] are beholding the bride coming of
[1:51:16] Christ that's the finished work of God
[1:51:19] that's what he wanted to finish that was

[1:54:51] while while the word is taken something
[1:54:53] in on and changed you you've been
[1:54:55] through your
[1:54:56] Pentecost but now you've got to grow in
[1:54:59] faith she couldn't she had to grow up to
[1:55:01] where she could receive she could know

[1:55:52] all right now anyway okay can you give
[1:55:55] me about five minutes or so I just got
[1:55:58] to finish some of this because I don't
[1:56:00] have every time to just take part two
[1:56:01] and three and four and all this all
[1:56:03] right now the faith of
[1:56:05] God the word is the real believer all
[1:56:08] right
[1:56:08] now so
[1:56:11] now for at this time the Word of
[1:56:17] Promise before I go there Philippians
[1:56:20] 2:5 said let this mind be in you you I
[1:56:23] was going to go there but let this mind
[1:56:24] be in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:56:28] who being in the form that's
[1:56:31] imorph are you with me that's in morphe
[1:56:33] what was in morphe God himself changing
[1:56:36] his
[1:56:37] mask steps down into another a part of
[1:56:40] the drama this curtain Rises he's a he's
[1:56:43] the same person but a different
[1:56:46] mask I'll just let that speak for itself
[1:56:49] who being in the form of God Jesus said
[1:56:51] who being in the form of God let this
[1:56:53] mind be in you who being in the form of
[1:56:55] God in
[1:56:57] morphe what form is he in now he's in
[1:57:00] you but what form is he in
[1:57:04] Bride being in the form of God thought
[1:57:06] it not robbery to be equal with God so
[1:57:09] he didn't go out and make himself a
[1:57:10] reputation you see a man trying to pump
[1:57:12] himself up make himself a reputation
[1:57:14] there's something wrong with his
[1:57:15] relationship with the
[1:57:17] Lord right see but he committed himself
[1:57:20] even to death the death of the cross
[1:57:22] just like we should do every day take up
[1:57:24] our cross amen deny
[1:57:26] ourself and take his word and
[1:57:29] following sell all that you have he
[1:57:31] asked the Rich Young Ruler sell what you
[1:57:33] got I know there's people sitting right
[1:57:35] here now that may God may say to you
[1:57:37] sell what you have and follow me other
[1:57:40] words give it over to me give everything
[1:57:42] give it up give it over I'm afraid if I
[1:57:44] do this and this will happen this and
[1:57:46] this will happen this and this will
[1:57:47] happen if I just yield completely to God
[1:57:50] to what he called me to do this and this
[1:57:51] might happen
[1:57:55] you're not willing to sell
[1:57:57] out he said he had he told me he said
[1:58:02] when he called me I'm just going to give
[1:58:03] a personal testimony when he called me I
[1:58:06] thought of this many times didn't think
[1:58:07] about it until not too long ago I
[1:58:09] thought that's exactly what you did Lord
[1:58:11] but that had nothing to do with David
[1:58:13] that was that seed
[1:58:16] responding that's what the Rich Young
[1:58:18] Ruler failed to have yeah he wouldn't
[1:58:22] follow God's command because in his
[1:58:23] reasoning it looked too
[1:58:26] unreasonable but then when he did then
[1:58:28] he tried probably still religious still
[1:58:30] went to church still said I believe the
[1:58:32] word I believe the Commandments and
[1:58:33] tried to mix the two together and where
[1:58:35] did he find himself in
[1:58:40] hell all right so you've got and he told
[1:58:43] me he said I want you to sell your
[1:58:45] business and to make it real clear to me
[1:58:47] it wasn't me he spoke to it was somebody
[1:58:49] else not knowing one or the other even
[1:58:51] hearing it
[1:58:53] sell all sell your business and go
[1:58:55] full-time
[1:58:56] Ministry I wonder how many ministers
[1:58:58] he's asked that to tell them that sell
[1:59:01] what you got get rid of what you got I
[1:59:03] want you to go
[1:59:05] full-time but Lord you know now Lord I I
[1:59:09] I built up this and I'm well favored
[1:59:11] among the people and I've done all this
[1:59:13] look at the years I've spent in
[1:59:16] it look at the years I put why all that
[1:59:19] lord I can't go to waste you know I want
[1:59:21] you to follow
[1:59:24] me I want you
[1:59:27] to sell out
[1:59:30] yeah he might ask you to sell like he
[1:59:32] did the Rich Young it might be some
[1:59:34] other things he wants you to
[1:59:37] sell and get in your position very
[1:59:42] quickly because if we don't get in each
[1:59:45] one in our position we're hurting the
[1:59:47] body
[1:59:50] yes amen we're hurting the body that's
[1:59:53] right God expects you to obey amen if
[1:59:58] you refuse to
[1:59:59] obey and if you're elect seed he'll stay
[2:00:02] on me until you do because he's going
[2:00:04] determined to get you where you need to
[2:00:06] be if it takes the very strength out of
[2:00:08] you to do
[2:00:10] it God doesn't care about that he's
[2:00:12] going to get you where you need to be
[2:00:14] you're going to have to mature in your
[2:00:17] position all right
[2:00:20] place so he's in morphe he's changed his
[2:00:23] mask we understand that I'm going to
[2:00:25] move on that he's embodied himself in
[2:00:27] you the full Revelation self the hidden
[2:00:29] Mystery of the seventh seal the ministry
[2:00:31] of the seventh angel the seventh seal
[2:00:33] you are the gift of God wrapped
[2:00:37] up you are God's wrapped
[2:00:40] gift all right now so he said for This
[2:00:44] Is The Word of Promise at this time I'm
[2:00:46] back in Romans n9ine I will come and
[2:00:48] Sarah shall have a son and not only this
[2:00:50] but when when Rebecca also conceived one
[2:00:53] by Our Father Isaac for the children
[2:00:56] listen to this for the children not
[2:00:57] being yet born neither having done any
[2:01:00] good or evil see nothing to do with it
[2:01:03] that the purpose of God according to
[2:01:06] election might stand not of works but of
[2:01:09] him that
[2:01:11] calleth if we didn't have election where
[2:01:14] would we be that's
[2:01:17] right you
[2:01:19] see so on on paragraph I may I can't get
[2:01:23] to everything I'm going to have to stop
[2:01:25] but paragraph and I'll have to pick it
[2:01:27] up as a part two but
[2:01:30] paragraph 163 on page 163 of this church
[2:01:34] age book you know which one I'm handling
[2:01:36] this
[2:01:37] one okay
[2:01:40] 163 you'll find it in a different page
[2:01:43] on the other hardback I mean the
[2:01:48] original now no sir it is the groom who
[2:01:51] decid es and chooses a certain woman for
[2:01:53] his bride you have not chosen me but I
[2:01:55] have chosen you John
[2:01:57] 15:6 now according to the word of God
[2:02:00] how see how did he choose us by for
[2:02:04] knowledge right now according to the
[2:02:06] word of God the bride was chosen before
[2:02:08] the foundation of the world the choosing
[2:02:11] of the bride was purposed in
[2:02:14] himself the choosing of the bride was
[2:02:17] purposed in
[2:02:19] himself Ephesians 1:9 and the and that's
[2:02:22] Eternal purpose and in Romans 91 911 I
[2:02:26] just read to you that the purpose of God
[2:02:28] according to election might stand the
[2:02:31] purpose of God according to election now
[2:02:33] listen the heart purpose the heart
[2:02:36] purpose these are powerful words the
[2:02:39] heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God
[2:02:43] was to take a bride of his own choosing
[2:02:47] yeah and that purpose was in himself
[2:02:52] and being Eternal was decreed before the
[2:02:55] foundation of the
[2:02:57] world amen amen amen that's right let go
[2:03:03] and let God have his wonderful way
[2:03:08] release you're trying to judge yourself
[2:03:11] by your feelings and your actions and
[2:03:14] trying to determine whether God's in you
[2:03:16] or Not by your reasoning about the word
[2:03:19] and Satan just twisting you around his
[2:03:21] face
[2:03:23] what's the word say about
[2:03:26] you tell me do you believe
[2:03:29] it what's your soul say about
[2:03:33] it God chose you his heart purposes to
[2:03:37] have a bride now who's going to stand in
[2:03:39] his
[2:03:41] way one of them I'm one of them how do
[2:03:45] you know Brother David I've been
[2:03:47] identified as one of them he identified
[2:03:50] me as that
[2:03:52] by unveiling himself in me and I look
[2:03:54] here in the word and that's exactly what
[2:03:56] he said he would do and I see it
[2:03:59] working amen all right so being Eternal
[2:04:05] and decreed before the foundational
[2:04:06] world watch carefully and see this
[2:04:08] before there was ever a specka stardust
[2:04:11] before God was God God is an object of
[2:04:13] adoration and no one is there to worship
[2:04:15] him so he he at that time only
[2:04:17] potentially God he was known only as an
[2:04:19] eternal spirit the bride was already in
[2:04:22] his
[2:04:24] mind yes she was she was existing in his
[2:04:31] thoughts and what about those thoughts
[2:04:33] of God of God thoughts of God do you
[2:04:36] know that God has Eternal thoughts of
[2:04:39] himself you know he knows everything but
[2:04:42] God has Eternal thoughts of
[2:04:44] himself and you were existing in those
[2:04:49] thoughts amen you were existing
[2:04:52] substance existing you weren't just an
[2:04:55] imagination you were existing yeah as
[2:04:59] substance in his mind yes she was she
[2:05:02] was existing in his
[2:05:05] thoughts and the brother BR says are
[2:05:08] they not they are Eternal are those
[2:05:10] thoughts Eternal and what about those
[2:05:12] thoughts of God are they Eternal are
[2:05:13] they not they are Eternal are they not
[2:05:15] excuse me the Eternal thoughts of God
[2:05:18] let me ask you are the thoughts of God
[2:05:20] Eternal if you can see this you will see
[2:05:22] many
[2:05:24] things all right then all he is he never
[2:05:27] had a new thought about
[2:05:29] anything because all of his thoughts he
[2:05:31] has always had and always will have and
[2:05:33] knows the end from the beginning because
[2:05:35] he's God this is the thoughts of God
[2:05:38] that thus excuse me thus the thoughts of
[2:05:41] God are Eternal they are real yeah amen
[2:05:46] and he expressed those thoughts when he
[2:05:48] expressed his word in the beginning yeah
[2:05:51] and he he said you're my Witnesses
[2:05:53] because you were with me from the
[2:05:55] beginning and we read in St John 1 the
[2:05:58] beginning was the word the word in the
[2:06:00] beginning was the word and the Word
[2:06:03] was God God and the Word
[2:06:06] was with
[2:06:09] God there you
[2:06:11] [Music]
[2:06:13] areh with
[2:06:15] God existing in his
[2:06:19] thoughts and so you and I don't have
[2:06:21] time go into it I'll just give you what
[2:06:22] I'm going to bring here the next time
[2:06:24] Lord willing if I
[2:06:27] can you are his spoken word seed amen
[2:06:32] amen and a spoken word is a thought
[2:06:35] expressed that's right you are his
[2:06:37] thought
[2:06:40] expressed you are the Original Seed you
[2:06:43] are then the original
[2:06:48] life amen you are the resurrection and
[2:06:51] you are the Rapture amen all right let's
[2:06:55] just finish this off I don't have time
[2:06:57] to stop it there I just want to go back
[2:06:59] here and pick up something because I had
[2:07:01] those things I wanted to read about the
[2:07:02] spoken word seed there's three different
[2:07:05] definite quotes on that I wanted to
[2:07:06] bring to you I'll bring it next time but
[2:07:09] I want to take what brother Paul
[2:07:11] finished his message
[2:07:13] with last Sunday or last Sunday yeah
[2:07:17] it's been a week already last
[2:07:19] Sunday 12:04 Rapture paragraph 65 but to
[2:07:24] the
[2:07:26] church let me just read up ahead of this
[2:07:28] a little
[2:07:31] bit we know we've been bought back amen
[2:07:35] and we were seed to only the elect can
[2:07:37] be reborn because only the elect is seed
[2:07:41] and why did he love Jacob and not Esau
[2:07:43] because Jacob was seed I don't have to
[2:07:46] go into all that because that was his
[2:07:47] thought his thought Jacob was his
[2:07:50] thought and that thought was expressed
[2:07:53] and Jacob was born right all right Jacob
[2:07:56] was the
[2:07:57] seed so it didn't have anything to do
[2:07:59] with outside of Jacob it was the seed
[2:08:02] that God
[2:08:03] saw and he determined to bring Jacob to
[2:08:06] his position and he did he went through
[2:08:08] a lot of suffering and a lot of things
[2:08:10] to get there but he got there is that
[2:08:13] right all right all right he was his
[2:08:16] thought and you go back you'll hear what
[2:08:18] brother Brown said there you go back in
[2:08:19] church a book and read about what
[2:08:21] thought of Jacob why did he love Jacob
[2:08:24] because Jacob was his thought yeah and
[2:08:26] that thought expressed was seed so Jacob
[2:08:29] had the
[2:08:32] seed well you have never chose Jacob
[2:08:35] right that's right and that wouldn't
[2:08:37] have chose me either right that's right
[2:08:41] but he chose me amen because he was
[2:08:44] determined he'd have a bride and he'
[2:08:46] pour his own life into that bride
[2:08:48] identifying her as himself you passed
[2:08:51] from death the
[2:08:53] life amen that's it that's it it's
[2:08:55] finished you raised with him you've
[2:08:58] already raised with him did you know
[2:09:00] that you've already raised with him when
[2:09:03] he raised you raised with
[2:09:05] him then he arose me raised me up with
[2:09:08] him in the resurrection and now we're
[2:09:10] seated with him in power and authority
[2:09:11] over every devil oh if you could only
[2:09:13] believe what God has given but if you're
[2:09:15] not seated there you don't have it if
[2:09:17] you are seated there and don't believe
[2:09:19] it and afraid to move you'll never use
[2:09:20] it but if you are seated there you will
[2:09:22] use it for you're ordained to do what
[2:09:24] you
[2:09:25] do amen and we raised with him in the
[2:09:28] resurrection and now we're ascended by
[2:09:30] his Spirit to the throne of grace
[2:09:32] sitting together in Heavenly places in
[2:09:34] Christ Jesus I died with him I was in
[2:09:37] him then and I died with him amen H you

[2:21:10] name I believe his word I'll follow I'll
[2:21:14] never flirt with the world I'll see now
[2:21:17] watch brother brandham said when you

[2:21:32] flirting with this you're flirting with
[2:21:34] the devil did you know that this body is
[2:21:37] still under the
[2:21:39] curse that's why you're dying why we

[2:21:46] surgeons to fix what's been broken thank
[2:21:50] God I don't mean that negatively I mean
[2:21:52] that posit thank God for
[2:21:53] surgeons I always wanted to be a
[2:21:56] surgeon or not say Sur a doctor I wanted
[2:21:59] to be just a family doctor but God said
[2:22:04] no you're a
[2:22:07] preacher I didn't want to be a
[2:22:13] preacher it don't matter if I preach
[2:22:15] well or don't well as long as I preach
[2:22:17] what he

[2:23:17] it wasn't length the length of your hair
[2:23:21] it's whether you cut it or
[2:23:24] not because if you don't cut your hair
[2:23:26] in God's eyes you have long hair and
[2:23:28] it's for a covering and you're keeping a
[2:23:29] Nazarite vow to him alone I'm reading

[2:26:17] way I say that from the sincerity and
[2:26:21] Revelation in my heart knowing where I
[2:26:23] stand and who I am I have no other head

[2:26:28] have the preeminence over me and Lord I
[2:26:31] will
[2:26:33] follow and Lord if I didn't say that if
[2:26:35] I just said that in my own makeup and
[2:26:37] just may it may fail but Lord knowing
[2:26:40] that that's come from a revelation of my
[2:26:43] heart then lord it's going to take place

[2:30:13] all I told you I can't stop until God
[2:30:16] stops me he said you forgot you said
[2:30:19] read that message that that quote now I
[2:30:22] said I would read what brother Paul left
[2:30:25] on Sunday and I didn't go to it the Lord
[2:30:27] brought it back to my remembrance here
[2:30:29] it is Rapture
[2:30:30] 1965 paragraph 65 but to the church the
[2:30:34] bride the Rapture is a revelation to
[2:30:39] her it's revealed to her now brother
[2:30:43] sister after what we've heard this
[2:30:45] morning who is
[2:30:47] this the Rapture is a
[2:30:51] person the Rapture is Jesus Christ you
[2:30:56] are the
[2:30:59] Rapture the Rapture is a person and it's
[2:31:02] revealed to
[2:31:04] her praise the Lord that the Revelation
[2:31:08] the true bride of Christ will be waiting
[2:31:10] for that revelation of the Rapture now
[2:31:12] it's a revelation for the Revelation is
[2:31:14] Faith you cannot have a revelation
[2:31:16] without it being faith faith is a
[2:31:18] revelation because it's something that's
[2:31:20] revealed to you faith is a revelation
[2:31:23] faith is something that's been revealed
[2:31:25] to you like it was to Abraham that could
[2:31:28] call anything contrary to that
[2:31:30] Revelation that's revealed to him as
[2:31:33] though it wasn't so right let's walk by
[2:31:37] that
[2:31:39] Faith
[2:31:41] [Music]
[2:31:43] amen page 32 things that are to be you
[2:31:48] say I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:31:49] the reason brother Brown saying this
[2:31:51] because you can have the baptism of Holy
[2:31:52] Ghost and still go to
[2:31:54] hell because if it doesn't fall on his
[2:31:56] seed there's no
[2:31:58] birth but it fell on some seed because
[2:32:01] the rain falls un just and unjust so you
[2:32:03] can still have the baptism the rain how
[2:32:06] many understand what I just said amen
[2:32:08] all right so you still have the baptism
[2:32:10] the rain all right that still has
[2:32:12] nothing to do with it that's just only a
[2:32:14] temporal gift for you and you must have
[2:32:16] the baptism don't get me wrong you've
[2:32:19] got to have it
[2:32:20] the only way that seat can be quickened
[2:32:23] so repent everyone of be baptized in the
[2:32:25] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[2:32:26] of sin and you shall receive this gift
[2:32:30] that we've been talking about of the
[2:32:31] Holy Ghost amen amen this revealed
[2:32:35] Christ all right in you now he said the
[2:32:38] real gift he said that's just a temporal
[2:32:41] gift but the real gift is your soul down
[2:32:44] in there that was born of God and that
[2:32:47] controls the whole thing to the word of
[2:32:50] God controls the whole thing to the word
[2:32:53] of God and the will of God and there you
[2:32:56] grow up amen that real start is in your
[2:32:59] soul even before there was a spirit it
[2:33:02] was your soul that Soul didn't come from
[2:33:04] God then it wasn't a germ of God and it
[2:33:08] had to come from one or the other it was
[2:33:09] either the seed of Satan or the seed of
[2:33:11] God there it is amen sorry but I had to
[2:33:15] get that out now let's sing two more
