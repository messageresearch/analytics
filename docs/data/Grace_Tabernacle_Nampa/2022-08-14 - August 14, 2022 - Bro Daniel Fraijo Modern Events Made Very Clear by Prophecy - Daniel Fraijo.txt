said i'll be with you even in you to the ends of the earth god bless you all this morning it's certainly an honor once again and a privilege to be here amongst the blood washed saints of jesus christ and he purchased you with his blood you are the purchased of the blood of jesus christ we're certainly thankful for all of that and uh this morning we like to share once again from from god's word and a little thought and i'd like to entitle that modern events made very clear yes sir by prophecy and um there was a rather famous person in england matter of fact he was king henry viii and they said he would make a statement every time he took a new wife and he would tell him i just want you to know that i won't be keeping you long it's the first statement he'd tell each and every one of his wives you know but this morning i just say that to say this my intentions are actually to keep you long this morning and i think that's the intentions of god unlike men of this earth where whether they say it or don't say it sometimes their intentions are just that with their wives with their brides but not not the lamb of god the lamb of god says to his wife my intentions are to keep you long like for eternity when he makes a vow he will not break it so this morning uh it's my intention also to to keep you long uh of course i'll be watchful and and uh see your level of attention and so forth and and uh which will certainly yield to that as the holy spirit gives us discernment here this morning if you'll stand to your feet this morning for the reading of the word like i say i'd like to entitle this thought modern events made very clear by prophecy and we'd like to begin reading in revelations chapter 5. and of course revelations 5 is one of the many visions that john the revelator had and and visions just like like human beings visions have a lifespan to them from the time they begin to the time they end so one vision might be fulfilled in a day while others unfold over months and sometimes visions take a year or two to unfold but revelations 5 here is probably in my opinion one of the longest standing visions because this vision begins in the book of genesis and takes us all the way to a rapture so for it's been going on now this particular vision way beyond six thousand years it's been unfolding so we'll begin here in verse one and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on a throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals let's pray heavenly father we thank you this morning that we can approach the author of the book we can knock this morning and it'll be open we can seek and we'll find so lord jesus we're doing just that this morning as we humbly bow before you and believing lord that you the lamb of god will once again open the eyes of the understanding of your people we ask it all in jesus name amen you may be seated revelations 5 and 1 as john said here and i saw so john was seeing what was taking place and john here was looking back all the way to genesis he was looking back and seeing that day he was seeing that moment when adam had lost the abstract title deed he was seen that that day when god was putting his children out of the garden and when he saw it he was giving us details from the point of view that he was seeing it that god was giving him that that moses had not written so now john is adding details to what happened in genesis that day in chapter 3 of genesis adding details that moses hadn't told us because moses was looking at brother daniel from this side and now john is looking from daniel from this side but it's the same scene so on this side he might see my sideburn was so long on that side john would say no it's not that long it was so long and yet they're both adding more details to make the scene more clear what took place so john from where he's looking 4 000 years later this is about 4000 bc there in genesis 3. he says and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on a throne a book written within and on the backside that adam had lost and this book was sealed with seven seals the english term here was you said book but it wasn't a book it was a scroll and it was sealed with the seal as they would do in times of old so john is looking back and he's seeing and watching this scene here in eden and i'll read it once again and i saw from the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside comma and the comma was placed there because the men that transcribed the book to the english were english scholars perhaps master's degrees phd's they they they knew the english language quite well they knew the greek quite well and they decided where the comma should be placed because after the word backside so when you read it as thus and i saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within on the backside it sounds like something is written within and something's written on the backside and then it says sealed with seven seals so for many years brother branham would read this verse many years as in all the way from back in 1953 to 1963 and if you recall to the students of the bible and this message often brother branham's saying speaking of those seven thunders can believing that those seven thunders was the seven seals written on the backside and when he preached sirs what time it is in 1962 end of the year he he is speaking to us he's told us this service i'm going to be probing he says that may sound strange for a minister he said but i don't know i'm just wanting you to prepare you for something that i believe is coming and i want you to be ready but i'm just probing tonight he said and can he can he emphasize in that message uh seven thunders being those seven seals and something written on the backside that's right and he had been holding that thought since 1953. for 10 years and you can find various quotes where he is repeating that then comes 1963 and he preaches god in simplicity he still holds to that thought and then comes the evening service of the breach and when he preaches the breach he says no he says seven thunders is not seven seals and there's nothing written on the backside because everything must be under the atonement everything must be in the book you can't add or take away there's nothing on the outside and if you remember more than once as he's preaching the seals he takes a roll of paper and he rolls it up in the first seal you can actually hear him rolling the paper and he says they didn't have a book like we have today it was a scroll he said then they would take wax put it on the end of that scroll to maybe take it in cigna and press it down in he said and that would seal the scroll that would seal the message that was within so here it says and i saw from the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside comma grammatically correct but it made it prophetically wrong just by the comma and when brother and preach the the breach he mentally and he verbally as he as as he pronounced this word but he moved the comma because though he realized it was grammatically correct it made the significance of it prophetically wrong and a prophet read it differently from that day and he said and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne the book written within now the emphasis he puts the comma and on the back side sealed with seven seals and what allowed him to catch that was when the lord revealed to them they didn't have books like we have today it was a scroll and the seal was on the outside but the message always lay on the inside of the scroll nothing outside of christ nothing outside of the word it's four thousand be seen the abstract title deed is back in the hands of the original owner almighty god verse two verse two and i saw a strong angel proclaiming it was the angel of the covenant you'll see that as we go down verse by verse these are not different characters unfolding in this vision this is god king morphy changing forms because he's descending for a work of redemption because he's coming down and can trust no one with your salvation he can trust no one with the hopes of gaining your friendship this is the work he's doing he himself is descending he's coming from glory and he'll go all the way to to the cross of calvary for you and i this is revelations 5. and i saw a strong angel proclaiming god descending with one purpose he wants to be closer to you so revelations 5 2 revelations 1 4 000 bc revelations 5 and verse 2 the years 1446 bc you see the vision you see how long it's taken to unfold and yet god the greatest writer and authors with it within nine verses there'll be six thousand years of history of him coming down for you and i what a writer god alone can write this way and then reveal it and open it up to us so here we are verse two it's 1446 bc the exodus has begun and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof remember john is an eyewitness by vision he has seen these things just as they unfolded back thousands of years ago and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice he's going to add detail to what was the purpose of the angel of the covenant you say well the main purpose was the pillar of fire to lead israel out of egypt or the main purpose was to pass through the land as the death angel to free the jews from the bondage or the main purpose was to was to open the red sea and they walked through as on dry land or the main purpose was for 40 years in the wilderness the pillar of fire was with them till they entered the promised land and all that is true but now john is going to add another detail to the purpose of the angel of the covenant and he says and i saw this strong angel proclaiming for the loud voice the one who led israel out of egypt the one that walked them in the wilderness for 40 years the one that took them to cross into the promised land when i saw the strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice he was saying i heard him john said who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals of detail moses didn't give us but now john john's adding this detail to this ministry of god as the angel of the covenant and for john this was his main purpose this was his main purpose he says then i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor on earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on because everyone had been born in sin every one of us was spotted every one of us was unworthy and he says and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and then he says in verse 5 verse 5 we're fast-forwarding now verse 5 is a.d 30. verse 5 is the first coming of christ verse 5 jesus begins his ministry as a young man he says and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the line of the tribe of judah the root of david have prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof so now here is a question that's in this message are the seven seals open and when did they open some say no they're not open some say yes they were open some say it was 1963 when they first opened i say it was not 1963 when they first opened no i'm glad you believe it's open but you've missed it by about 2 000 years because when the book was first opened and the seals were first loose it was jesus christ who did it amen you see the lion took the lion's part israel and gave the open book and the and the loosing of these seals to the firstborn son remember the allegory in the old testament jacob i mentioned to the night joseph's two sons kephrim and manassas he places them properly the eldest son at his right jacob's right hand and the youngest at his left and jacob's a blind old man he's at his last breaths of life and he's about to pray for the two boys and he crosses his hand and he gives the lion's share to the youngest instead of to the elvis and joseph says not so father i already properly placed them jacob says no son god crossed my hands it was an allegory that thousands of years later the lions share that belonged to israel the eldest son would be given to the youngest son the book that jesus opened the su the seals and the that he loosed in parable in matthew 24. the commandment that he gave to his twelve disciples go you to the house of israel don't go amongst the samaritans don't go to the gentiles this open book this seven seal revelation this is for the eldest this is the lion's share the lion's share goes to the eldest church not the youngest one that'll come and when the eldest rejected at the cross of calvary amen that's right the open book and the seven seal revelation went to a gentile people so here we are revelations five and five the year is a.d 30 and jesus christ at his first coming has opened the first seal think of seven seals in this way okay seven parts to one divine plan of redemption seven seals seven parts to one divine plan of redemption to restore the fig tree and to restore the bride tree that's right yeah i threw that into for paul because he's a farmer you know start talking about trees so here the book that adam lost the lion took the lion's share to israel and israel rejected it the year revelations 5 and 5 is a.d 30. verse 6 can i be held and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and of the midst of the elder stood a lamb is that had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth from verse five to verse 6 three years has just gone by from the beginning of his ministry to the day of crucifixion three three and a half years and the lamb john sees the lamb now john sees the lion jesus christ now as jesus christ the lamb god didn't change forms now but at gethsemane jesus walked in king of the jews lying of the tribe of israel and when jesus walked out after one hour of prayer he walked out the lamb of god savior of the whole world one hour in five minutes god can change your life but from the time you walked in this morning to the time you walk out you tell him what's in your heart you be praying as we're speaking to you the word of god because he can change your desires completely he can make you new again amen so verse 6 a.d 33 a.d 44. can i be held and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the world the years a.d 33 34 crucifixion day from verse 1 to verse 6 over 4 000 years god covered him descending god changing forms but in verse 6 he didn't change forms he changed ministry from lion to lamb of god he was always the lamb of god but he didn't enter the ministry right till this spot why he was the lamb slain at the foundation of the world for adam and eve and the skins that god created because god didn't kill anything for those skins by the spoken word he created these skins to dress his son and his daughter to cover them with the skins of the lamb that in his mind he had slain to cover them with so the skins that he created represented himself as the lamb of god and he covered adam and eve with these spoken word skins representing the covering of the blood of the sacrifice of the lamb of god in genesis revelation 13 8 says he was the lamb slain not before the foundation but at the foundation matter of fact in genesis 3 in the year 4000 the lamb was slain the sacrifice was made in the mind of god verse 7. and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne verse 7 8-9 is now the second coming of christ this is a proof this is prophecy this is vision this is how quickly the scene can change in the prophetic word a comma a period a dot a space a word just like in malachi 4 6 remember behold i'll send you elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the lord and he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children comma john the baptist one come up and turn the hearts of the children to the fathers is 2 000 years later one comma yeah that's right 2 000 years later so without revelation who can read this book and understand and if you're catching it and understanding know this that it's the it's the holy spirit it's the lamb of god opening the eyes of your understanding here this morning this isn't natural it's supernatural what's taking place right now in your heart in your mind and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne the date changes again revelations 5 and 7 february the 28th 1963. that's right we'll share more detail on it don't be scared i'm your friend i'm non-violent i'm just here to share the word are you listening this morning and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the todom february the 28th 1963 yes sir then it repeats and when he had taken the book here he told us he took the book revelation 7 february the 28th 1963 is when they ch snapped the picture of the cloud that's right on sunset mountains and when he had taken the book he took the book but now it's saying and when you're taking the book that was march 17 1963 and when he had taken the book not only was that march 17 1963 okay but that was jeffersonville indiana yes sir and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of voters which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song they'd never sung the song before this was new because revelation was falling inspiration was coming down they sang a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof i thought revelations 5 said he had already opened the book and the seals he did that was the first coming that was the line with the line shared to israel but now the lamb takes the book again because this is the second coming of christ this is the lamb taking the lamb's part to the bride of jesus christ to a mystical body to the church here in idaho and they sung a new song the brothers and grandpa saying thou art worthy to take the book into the open the seals thereof for thou was slain amen not william branham not the apostle paul not moses not adam not abel not paul not daniel the lamb of god opened the book in 1963 the lamb of god revealed the word in jeffersonville indiana he had a vessel he had a trumpet but it was this is god from verse 1 to verse 9 of revelations 5 this is god changing forms and changing ministry and they sang a new song saying thou art worthy you take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou a slain has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation verses 7 8 9 the seventh seal was loosed what did the seven seals lose what did the seven seal loose six other seals and the revelation of it were hidden under the seventh seal so here we are verse seven eight and nine three verses three verses represents from march the 28th from february the 28th to march the 24th yes 25 days now i'd like for you to turn with me to revelations 8 and 1. we're going to let our fingers do the walking through the bible pages is what we want to do revelations 8-1 it reads like this and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour that's all it said and they say but the daniel that's all he said what in the world will you make out of that it's best to say nothing isn't it it's best to be quiet isn't it it's best to not get out on a limb with these things they tell us in 1963 in the mystery in the message christ the mystery of god revealed brother branham says this and in paragraph 6 37 he says not knowing of course but being spiritual you watch spiritual things not knowing this god knows it but if you'll turn and look at the clock he says it's on the dot two o'clock and everyone in the room could look and look at the clock and yeah it's two o'clock and then brother and says the end of the second poll he wanted them to be partakers of something god was doing right then that moment he wanted him to get caught up in the spirit he says it's the end of the second pull the third pool is at hand amen revelations 8 1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour brother and i made a statement because that's just one verse for the whole seal one verse and not a whole lot to it as he himself declared there's not a matter of fact he said there's really nothing said about it that's right but in 1964 feast of the trumpets he told us revelations 10 was the seventh seal yes that's exactly right so what does that mean to us then that means that all of a sudden the seventh seal doesn't have just one verse that's right now it's got 11 verses plus one now there's 12 verses of detail so that we can see and try to and recognize our day and its message it's not one verse no more he said look i want to say one more thing closely now don't miss this how striking from the seventh angels he said messenger of the seven seal message in revelations 10 was the seventh seal that's right so he's telling us there's a lot more detail yes to this seventh seal and if you want to know more about it read revelations 10. because revelations 10 was the seventh seal it's 1964. july the 19th in the morning there was a magazine called science magazine there in arizona put out by the university of arizona and the the head scientist was james e mcdonnell and in that magazine he writes this he said an unusual ring-shaped cloud was widely absorbed over northern arizona near sunset on the 28th of february 1963. from a large number of observers reports it is known to have appeared overhead near flagstaff arizona it says from initial computations based on four photos taken in tucson 190 miles south of the cloud its altitude was approximately 35 kilometers the most distant observation reported was 280 miles from the cloud he said the cloud remained sunlit for 28 minutes after local sunset now god has science to add another detail to revelations 8 1. in revelations 8 8 1 john said that when the seventh seal opened there was silence in heaven about the space of ethanol but now we realize god adds more detail and he causes the scientific world to tell us that the reason john said it was about a half hour because it was actually 28 minutes he said the cloud remained sunlit for 28 minutes after local sunset the senate said amen the cloud remained sunlit for 28 minutes science telling us this he says he said everything is the cloud remains sunlit for 28 minutes after local sunset iridescent iridescence was noted by many absorbers tentatively the cloud may be regarded as similar to on narcrescious cloud but it's used but it's unusually great high and unusually low altitude plus its remarkable shape suggests that it was a cloud of previously unrecorded type unrecorded of science and yet it was previously recorded just the scientists will not go back to the data sheets of god to see who was recorded before in acts 1 verses 7 to 11. that's it it reads like this verse 7 and he said unto them it's not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own power jesus speaking to his disciples he's about to ascend he's a he's been with them for 40 days he's going to give them a commission to terry in jerusalem he's about to ascend he said he said unto he said both but ye shall receive power verse 8 after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and all judea and samaria come to the uttermost parts of the earth and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received them out of their sight can while they look steadfastly toward heaven as he went behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said to yemen of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go so now so now what happened on february the 28th adds detail to what took place here in jerusalem that there wasn't a cloud that received them up that was the same seven angels and the way they took him is the way he's come back in our day again amen that's the truth isaiah 28 verse 9 and 10 says whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall be made to understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the best that's it amen that's right them that have been born again it's spoken in a mystery it's spoken in a parable it's an allegory turn with me to revelations 10 verses 1 and 2. revelations 10 verse 1 and 2 john again an eyewitness of these things by vision and he said and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud there it is there it is there's the seven angels can a rainbow was upon his head and his face was it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and you look at the magazine life magazine if anyone has it i happen to have two you know and when you look at that picture of the cloud it's in the last pages or the back of the magazine you see the shape you turn it to the right the face of christ but there's no rainbow there brother dave come on let me say it i forgive you see he took my thunder from me no pun intended but so in fact it is on the backside of that picture of the cloud you turn back and it's a photograph that was taken on one of the hawaiian islands and it's a picture of a rainbow but they call it a moonlit rainbow that's right because the picture was taken at 11 o'clock at night 11th hour very rare i don't know of any other pictures of a moonlight rain they've been seen before but photographed it was so outstanding that a photographer in hawaii happened to be at the right place the right time with the right equipment to snap that photo and here is a is a rainbow at night and they took that rainbow picture and they put it on the back side page of the cloud picture and when you pick that page up to the light and the light shines through it you see a rainbow over the head of christ and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and science took the picture and life magazine documented can his face was or as it were the sun because it was a face when you turn it to the right and his feet as pillars of fire verse two and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and modern events are being made very clear by prophecy in the message modern events but ram preached in 1965 paragraph 61 he says these modern events is slipping by us too swiftly and one day we're going to find out we'll be left behind without nothing can be caught sealed into the mark of the beast before we know it now and with patience we have to wait for this for the prophecies that's promised every one of them must be fulfilled in this age for it foretells us the author has before done this and we wait to see him do it again what a time it is that we're living in something like a calendar you look at a calendar to find out what day of the year you're living in can you look at god's bibles to see what age we're living in we're not living in the method age the baptist age did he say the laodicean age he did not he said the bright age that's right and and men in this message good men with a big period under revelation they say no no no there's only seven church ages like as screaming to the prophet saying don't do this to me don't you know i've preached seven church ages for 40 years now and then this quote pops up he says he said we're living in the bride age the calling bringing back to god through a channel that he promised to bring it back in he promised to do it in the message this day the scriptures fulfilled brother branham says seven angels said the seven seals of the seven mysteries will be open and then he said this day this scriptures is fulfilled right i'll read it yes sir he said here can we here we are today understanding serpency can a few days of god willing we'll understand the correctness of marriage and divorce and all these things that god has opened every seal the mystery since the foundation of the world we've been enjoying the presence of his blessing that's true this day this scripture amen fulfilled revelations 10 is not just the seventh seal as he told us revelations 10 it's his coming it's his second coming amen to the bride of jesus christ he says now he says now it's wrote mysterious because no man nowhere knows it the breach 1963 god alone jesus christ see but it is a book a mysterious book it's a book of redemption we'll get into that in a little while and now we know that this book of redemption will be thoroughly understood will not be thoroughly understood it's probed that through six church ages but at the end when the seventh angel begins to sound his mystery he winds up all the loose ends that these fellows probed at and the mysteries come down from god as the word of god reveals the entire revelation of god then the godhead and everything else is settled all the mysteries serpent seed and whatever more is to be revealed now you see i'm not just making that up it's thus saith the lord i'll read it to you out of the book the sounding of the seventh angels message the mystery of god should be finished that's been declared by his holy prophets that's the prophets who wrote the word at the sounding of the seven church age the last church age all those loose ends that through these church ages have been probed at will be wound up together and when the seals are broke and the mystery is revealed down comes the angel the messenger christ setting his foot upon the land upon the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember the seventh angel is on the earth at the time of his coming yes sir amen what he meant is i'm it's just gonna happen to be that i'm gonna be at sunset mountain when he comes down that's the abbreviated version so what is revelations 10 revelations 10 is the seventh seal yes sir amen revelations 10 is the time of the bride age revelations 10 it's his coming revelations 10 is when the seven seals of god were opened there on the mountain amen you say how do you know that brother damn because he told me that in the message the invisible union of the bride of christ 1965 paragraph 301 amen and he said this and the seven seals of god when it was opened there on the mountain amen february the 28th amen and the seven seals of god when it was opened there in the mountain lit god no let me die right now at this pulpit if that ain't the truth i foretold you even a year and six months before it happened what he told me go to arizona and what would happen out there in the desert and there's men sitting here right now tonight was standing there and present when the seven angels came down amen and even the magazine life packed the article of it it's right there in the observatory and everything now they don't even know what it's all about but you know yes because the secret things belong to you that's exactly right the cloud was photographed on february the 28th 1963. march 17 1963 william branham begins the sounding part of the ministry he begins the sounding of the seventh angel ministry with god and simplicity march 24th he preaches the seventh seal so from february the 28th to march the 24th fourth it's 25 days so from the appearing of the cloud to the preaching of the seven seals 25 days in prophecy but took place on sunset mountain is revelations 10 1. amen and in prophecy what took place in jeffersonville indiana was revelations 10 7. amen so those seven verses of revelations 10 from verse 1 to verse 7. you know how long it took for god to unfold it 25 days amen amen think about it from revelations 10 1 a prophecy that has sat for 2 000 years god unfolds it in 25 days what was it it was the third pool ministry amen that he continued to the end of his life in 1965. he didn't go back to the second poll as many wanted him to he didn't go back from the first poll as even more wanted him to no god said third poll that's it the revealing of the word the character building time for the bride of jesus christ to teach her how to handle the spoken word to increase her faith in the prophecies of her life so that she can be quickened changed translated by the power of the holy spirit revelations 10 1-7 25 days amen and god unfolds it brings it to pass it's history now amen but there's a few verses left in the seventh seal of revelations 10. it's 8 to 11. in the message the first seal 1963 brother branham he says the seals has done been broke he says matter of fact because he's preaching the first shield he says why we're breaking them now they were they were open there on the mountain yes but now the lamb has taken the book and we're in jeffersonville indiana and he's loosing the revelation watch paragraph 195 the first seal now then reformers know there was something wrong luther knowed that that the bread wasn't the body of christ and so he preached that just shall live by faith and that was his message and when john wesley came along he saw that there was sanctification so he preached sanctification that was his message see the pentecostals brought in the message of the holy ghost and so forth but in the days in the last days the messenger is not to start any reformation but is to take all the mysteries that these reformers left off gather them together solve them to the people let me just read it again it sounds so good to me i like to read it he says i like to read it he ain't god ain't king henry viii it's the lamb of god he's planning to keep you long maybe even this morning he's still planning that but in the last days from this last age the messengers not to start any reformation but is to take all the mysteries that these reformers left off gather them together solve them to the people let me just read it again it sounds so good to me i like to read it believers two in the bed two men two women grinding at the mill to men in the field both of them wise and foolish amen they like reading it this precious bible over and over and over until god opens it up to you the parables and when he comes he'll speak in parables and without a parable he won't see a word but in parables he will speak things that have been hid since the foundation of the world in parables he was speaking things that only the ears of adam had ever heard like this one thing that he repeated often to adam it just so happens i know what he said to adam he said this adam the works that i do shall you do also amen and greater than these for i go to the father you say oh no brother bro brother john brother daniel i'm a bible reader that's saint john 14 and 12. that's not the old testament but you see god's word is eternal amen what he said there wasn't the first time he said it but what he said there was a time now that he was determined for you to be the one to fulfill that part then he was speaking to adam this morning he's speaking to you revelations 10 verse 3 and 4. and cried with a loud voice that's when a lion born and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things with the seven thunders uttered and write them not now the big thing in a debate is this it's not written plain and simple it's not written brother daniel so there you have it guy what are you going to do with that one i say well before he said it's not written he said it was spoken that's right and his spoken word will not return boy that's right it was by the spoken word that he created heavens and earth and that part wasn't written until a thousand years later when moses wrote it so long before it was written it was spoken and came to pass the spoken word amen is what brings things to pass the written word he does that for us but he don't need his word written to bring it to pass in your life the thunder i'm going to say the thunder was the voice of god when the seal opened amen and the reason i'm going to say it is because he said it in the first seal you know that thank you brother dave you didn't jump on that one you take my thunder again thank you sir this man's a gentleman i love him first seal paragraph 263 we found what the thunder means that's perfectly we know that see the thunder was the voice of god when the seal opened amen in saint john 12 the brandon reads it when he preaches the first seal and he said and the people heard as though it had thundered some said it was a voice but what it was was the first seal opening that's right in the days of jesus at the first coming part one of seven parts of one divine plan to restore the bride tree to restore the fig tree to restore you to restore me to restore a mystical body of jesus christ seven seals i gotta tell you that seven seals that's what the thunder was about amen and i gotta tell you that because that's what he also said questions and answers 1964. brother brown says have the seven thunders they ask him the question which equals seven minutes mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the seven seals but are yet not known to us as the thunders yet the other man says no they were revealed in the seven seals that's what the thunders was about the seven thunders that had uttered their voices that no one could make out what it was john knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven mysteries of the seven thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is the messenger of the seven church ages so revelations 10 what is it it's it's the seven seals revelation is 10 what is it it's the bright age revelations 10 what is it it's his coming to the bride revelations 10 what is it it's the sounding of the seventh angel it's his third paul ministry the revealing of the word amen what is revelations 10 it's a heart turning time not a time of information not education revelation is a personal experience with a father made possible through the blood of jesus christ seven thunders will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers in the next in the exposition of the seven church ages let me read you this now this messenger of malachi 4 and revelations 10 7 is going to do two things two things one according to malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers standing in the gap 1963 three months after he preached the seals he says this in paragraph 80. well it happens to be that at least one man is present this morning who was standing there when it happened it actually took the rocks off the mountain we find out that during that time i saw seven angels in the form of a pyramid that swept down and picked me up i was brought east to open the seven seals for god if you haven't got them if jesus tarries my great grandchildren little paul's children that will still be the eternal truth of the living god now that was to find out what was sealed inside this mountain that wasn't wrote it had to be interpreted and when i come back and when i come back or rather when i came back because sometimes he would use pass because he was really thinking about the present or use present tense and he was really meant to say the future tense he he rather spoke in parables of time didn't he he said he said was it he says and when i come back when i came back in others to jeffersonville indiana the first angel on the first night opened the seal contrary to anything we ever heard in our life and all seven came out the same way he said you know that you were here present when it happened many of you the time of those seven sealed voices is when he begins to sound 1962 is this the sign of the answer he says now when he begins to sound he's speaking of himself now when he begins to sound the seventh angel the elijah ministry the mystery will be finished now note then it's the time for the seven seal voices of revelations 10 to be revealed there you are do you understand congregation says that's what they said when all the mysteries of the book has completed and the bible said here that he would finish the mysteries that's it so revelations 10 it's the seventh seal revelations 10 it's the bride age amen revelations 10 it's his coming amen because you know brother dave we'd sit in the audiences and they'd see us and they'd say they'd spot you right here and say and they'd look in your eye and say well if you think i don't know the difference between this coming is appearing they'd be talking right to you right revelations 10 it's the seventh seal revelations 10 it's the bride age revelations 10 it is coming and when the seven revelations 10 it's when the seven seals was opened there on the mountain february the 28th 1963 revelations 10 it's when the seventh angel began to sound on march the 18th amen read with me revelations 10 verse 5 and 6. and it reads like this and the angel which i saw stand upon the scene upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things therein are can the earth and the things therein are can the sea can the things which are therein that there should be time no longer and they asked the prophet a question and questions and answers 1964. time ended with the preaching of the seals and he said no he said now if time ceases when the seals were open if time ceased pardon me he's reading the question when the seals were open then the millennium is also finished is it not time didn't cease when the seals were open you misunderstood it amen you misunderstood it what happened the mysteries was revealed not time cease see just look watch real close now can watch real close now and play your tape if you got it from a tape see time never ceased this must be a post millennius or something that asks the question he says because you see we got a thousand years after the church has gone home and comes back upon the earth then time ceases in the new heavens and the new earth now the millennium is a type of noah going in the ark and carried over and brought ham and them on the other side and sin even come out amen of the ark he says see revelations 10 and 7. let's read it but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he's declared to his servants the prophets revelations 10 when the seventh angel begins to sound his message that was not the healing services a first and second poll it's the message that was to follow amen i know you're waiting for me to read the quote here it is i have heard but now i see 1965 november the 27th in in less than in less than another 30 days god will take him home amen this is what he said now we're promised the church age through reformers and we've had them but he promised in malachi 4 he'd keep his pattern always watch the pattern of the word read your bible and say lord show me the pattern of hebrews 13 8 that you're the same yesterday today and forever that you're unchanging from genesis to revelations now we're promised the church age to reformers and we've had them but he promised in malachi 4 he'd keep his pattern in the last days what would take place to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers a character building process called sons and daughters being adopted into the very image of the stature of a perfect man there you are for that very purpose can the church is so broke broke up in denominations or you could read it and the message is so broke up and denominations and isms it's so torp to pieces till it's dead it's been a carrier and then he promised in the hour of the seventh angel's message the seven seals would be revealed the mysteries of god would be declared revelations 10. when the seventh angel begins to sound his message not the healing service not the healing service the message that follows the healing service we want to go back to the beginning i don't want to go back to the first poll no that's right were any of you in the tent meetings of the 60s and all we saw miracles there but i saw other things too that's right i don't want to go back to that the seventh angel then when he began to sound forth his ministry not when he started out healing the sick the rapture 1965 december the 4th in 20 days god takes him home he says this now here's a messenger above always and a messenger on earth the english word angel means a messenger and in the seventh angels message while he was making his proclaiming his ministry then he began to sound forth his ministry not when he started out amen that's right jesus when he started out was he the lamb of god he was but he wasn't in the ministry that's exactly right he began in the ministry of the line of the tribe of judah amen and when he walked in to the garden of gethsemane he walked in saying lord not my will but thine be done and when he walked out after an hour in the presence of god yes the father he walked out with a ministerial change he took off his crown that no man saw he dropped his royal robe that no man knew he wore amen he laid down the scepter of a king yes sir he walked out without royal protection so he could give his life amen for you and i as the lamb of god he gave up all the supernatural protection so he could die for you and me hallelujah because he felt and he still does this morning that you are worth dying for amen the song says he thought i was worth dying for amen he thought i was to die for and he did the seven seals were preached on march the 17th 1963 beginning with god and simplicity it was ten services in eight days and in march the 24th 1963 the seventh seal was ministered so from february the 28th 1963 to march the 24th 1963 is 25 days total revelations 10 1 to revelations 10 7 fulfilled in 25 days amen sat for thousands of years but when the time came god said i'm going to make this a quick short work what has begun in the ministry of the sounding of the seventh angel the third paul ministry continued to 1965. the revealing of the word until god takes his prophet in an automobile accident october or december the 24th of 1965 and the message of the seventh angel is completed amen someone might say well that's your opinion brother daniel yeah oh wait a minute i've got a quote it's in is this the sign of the answer paragraph 297 and brother adam says this the book that's written within is then completed when this angel ceases amen he said now please understand this when the seventh angel message is completed the godhead ministry the serpent seed all the other mysteries of all these things he said but the book that's written within is then completed when this angel ceases god takes him home the very fact that god took him home is a sign that's it all the loose ends have been tied together that's it that's right you say brother daniel he preached it i've heard the seals and i don't see it well that's called a need in your life called revelation how do you get it go back to the book amen it shall be opened unto you amen seek and you shall find that's right ask and it shall be given to you but if you keep saying no it's not open you're not asking that's not asking that's telling that's not asking that's telling in the message influence 1963 brother branham says he's ministering he says i must decrease okay he must increase but he said it this way in talking of john the baptist he said what did john the baptist do the man that jesus said there was never a man born of a woman like him or could compare with him until that time that great prophet ordained of god before the foundation of the world spoke of 12 or 700 years before he ever come on he said or for 700 or 1200 years rather before he came to the earth by the prophet isaiah here what did he do when he seen a man come walking down out of the audience and he looked up above and saw that fire coming down from heaven in the form of dobby cried out i have need to be baptized of thee he said then brother man says i must decrease he must increase now he's talking in the first person now it takes revelation then he says god can't have two on the earth at the same time only one has the message you know i must decrease it's 1963 it's november the 30th influence he says he says god can't have two on the earth at the same time only one has the message in him i must decrease and then he says he is the messenger christ the holy spirit he is the messenger then he says i've been up to this time of november 63 the 30th i've been up to this time now he takes my place what was the forerunner doing he was decreasing that's right because he wanted to be sure that when god took him off the scene he had decreased in your eyes amen and christ had increased that's what makes him a prophet to me that's what makes him the seventh angel to me that's what makes him the forerunner like elijah like the first one to me amen because he followed he was following the pattern of god's word when john said two i must decrease he must increase who's he john that's my cousin how convenient john you and your cousin huh nice little setup you guys have you're the forerunner he's but he was the forerunner and christ was the lamb of god and brother branham says 1963 november the 30th i must decrease he's the messenger i've been up to this time now he takes my place as elisha when elijah went up and throwed back his robe to elisha his ministry was finished elisha must take up where he left off he must increase i must decrease this man really had a revelation of his ministry amen and he wasn't building his own kingdom the seventh angel was building the kingdom of god and of his christ after the forerunner has left the scene who is the messenger follow the pattern the holy spirit christ in his bride amen amen as he was in his prophet exactly right and what follows is a ministerial change from a one-man ministry to the ministry of a many member body like it was in the book of acts like it happened on the day of pentecost like jesus told them go terry in jerusalem i'm going to ascend you folks will stay here and now i'm going to work through my church it went from a one-man ministry to a many-membered body to a five-full ministry amen yeah amen that's right that's right don't just push them to to push play push them to the altar to get baptized and surrender their lives to jesus christ and we ain't playing around when we say that that's right revelations 10 verse 8-11 and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again this is john and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth if you'll notice john wasn't told to take the book out of the seventh angel's hand no that's right no he said go back to the original owner go back to the mighty angel amen remember revelations 5 and 5 the lion of the tribe of judah prefailed to take the book he took it from the original owner then you get down to verses 7 8-9 and now it says and the lamb took the book from him that sat on the throne he went back to the original owner what does that mean to go back to the original owner all the time it speaks of a ministerial change and revelations 10 8 john going back to take the book from the original owner it's a ministerial change from a one-man ministry from the seventh angel to a many-membered body of the bride of jesus christ the same god same christ but a ministerial change has taken place verse 9 and i went up unto the angel and said unto him to give me the little book he said unto me take it eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings seven seals it's seven parts of one plan of redemption for the bride tree and the fig tree you see how god hid it he took the smallest part the seal highlighted it and everybody's running what's a seal what does it mean a seal a seal seal and it's just a little dot of wax on the scroll called the book in english and everyone's looking the seal to seal the seal and the bride says no no no remove the seal open the book read the promises of god written from genesis to revelations yes sir that's right our book is the bible amen all the promises of god are in the bible and he sent the prophet and he put on tape okay and pointed us back to the bun brother gave me a testimony another brother invites him go out have lunch well that'd be great and as he gets off his car he's waiting by the front door of this restaurant the other brother's coming got his bible and said he said oh this is going to be good he said nice fellowship got his bibles carrying it right in and he says gets a few feet away from he says god bless you brother i'm so happy that we've got the message of the hour and you know what he says see this book because yeah he sees i'm smiling i i see the bible praise god he says we don't need this no more we got the message and he tosses it into the bushes the brother goes you know what brother lunch is over i can't eat with you and he walks away we are privileged this morning to have a book called the bible and see it unfolding before our eyes brother madam says the message revelation chapter 5 our sister com the pianist can come at this time he said and this seven seal book of redemption plans has been brought to us and that does and that's what this book holds now we're going to get over into the 10th chapter where this mighty angel proclaimed something and he had a little book that john had to eat and when he did he got it in his belly and it was bitter but in his lips it was sweet when you have to digest it then it gets bitter everybody's against you everybody telling you you're a holy roller you're this you're that the other scene you're off your head so it's hard to digest it but when you're testifying of his glory it's sweeten your lips that's all see when you stand up can i meet him to say glory to god hallelujah oh when when you're going through the through that great siege it's hard but when you're out of that great siege you can testify of it then it's sweetened the lip see that's right that's this book of redemption amen that's his book of redemption revelations 10 1-7 it's history and it unfolded in 25 days revelation 8 to 11 it's present tense it's the ministry of the bride of jesus christ [Music] she's entered into her ministry that's right who is she someone say that's me she is me i am her and i've been in the mind of god before the foundation of the world and one day maybe i was gonna say and one day we'll turn this world upside down but i've been accused of doing that already i got an early start i guess brother paul but that's okay [Music] that's okay because it has given me great joy and a peace and the love of god in my heart amen it has changed me and that was the ministry of the forerunner prepare ye away for the lord in the wilderness every valley will be filled every mountain will be made plain everything crooked and every road will be straightened out every rough place will be made smooth the elijah ministry then of course i went to go find that in the new testament to connect the dots and i look and i said lord what am i missing here no road work took place in jerusalem john didn't do any of it [Music] and he spoke to marge said he did none of it and he did it all [Music] okay how he said he says away in the wilderness it's a change a valley being filled it's a change mountains clean plain down to nothing that's a change every rough spot being made smooth that's a change i said now i get it now i get it what these elijah ministries have come to do to bring to the church change change change change even to the changing of our bodies from glory unto glory amen he's changing and he's changing you yes sir god bless you all this morning lord be with you may he quicken to your hearts this word this bible may he reveal it to you may every time you read it he be opening the eyes of your understanding as paul said it takes revelation revelation is free you just have to ask knock it shall be opened unto you seek and you shall find ask and it shall be given to you now i have no education myself i went to high school
