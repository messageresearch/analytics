reveal [Music] word that was spoken by the prophet of Mali 4 can't you see why I'm happy I've accepted the word of the [Music] Lord the reveal word that was Spen of Mal for you see why I'm happy I've accepted the word of her Lord the reve that was spoken by the prophet of Mali 4 Hallelujah isn't it wonderful to be part of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen everyone in the world today is looking for an identity and even all the psychologists and whatever else are saying we we're having a great identity crisis and people are trying to to find something that would make them happy and often times because Satan comes and muddies the water their choice to make them happy is is not a good choice cuz it's not a lasting happiness it's temporal but I thank the Lord today that we actually can come and get a hold of something in our life that will hold us amen and uh I thank God for that amen that we have something holding us I think maybe she's in the the basement at the moment but we want to um welcome Lily uh a friend of Gideon's that uh brought to church with him today we just uh want her to be happy uh welcome here today um and uh brother Tim Sister Miriam trust that you had a wonderful time in Oklahoma I heard it was too wonderful actually and you're trying to buy a house uh but um you know we just want the Lord's will to be done right we want him to guide us if we were relying on man we would have to have just Reams and reams of paper and plan a wouldn't work plan B wouldn't work we just have to keep digging through it until somehow we found a compromise but when God's in control we trust him and we listen to him then we know all things work together for them that love the Lord amen I I just want to um also remind the young people if you would please um young people's this Friday here at the church 700 p.m. and uh to sound like the school master or something please don't forget to read your homework you guys do remember he had homework [Music] right brother Caleb's just looking at me like what are you talking about okay here's the last and final warning we won't mention it again please it read at least the first 10 pages for you young people with such talent 10 pages is probably 10 minutes if you could please do that amen looking forward to it actually communion is this next Sunday evening 5:00 p.m. amen looking forward to that I I um we want to remember uh brother Sergey brother vasile is already on the prayer list but I I was uh trying to text with with uh brother Sergey last night and he said brother Paul uh while I tried to call him and and he says um I'm in the middle of a huge snowstorm and I just can't so let's remember them amen it's not just a matter of steering a truck down the road but uh sometimes you have to deal with everything else and um so one last announcements that I want to make um by God's grace we have arranged all of our speakers for the events coming up so for the Youth banquet we have brother rap crook uh brother rap um lives there in the Lima uh area but attends uh literal Life Church and uh I just really enjoyed visiting with brother rap and we're we're looking forward to that and uh I hope brother rap wouldn't mind me sharing this but you know Sister Elizabeth um has you know sometimes she just suffer some some anxieties and when I talked to brother rap the other day he said the Lord has just totally delivered her from that he's it's like she's a whole new sister in Christ amen and so we want to continue to remember our sister in prayer amen because those things anxieties and stuff like that are very very difficult to deal with they they control people's lives and so we're looking forward to brother rap coming the Easter meetings uh and not all of you will know them but the Easter meetings brother Daniel kungu from Seattle area will be coming and ministering for us for the Easter meetings sister Rachel would know them he's been coming up to North Idaho and ministering um brother Trevor wouldn't because his him and sister Carrie skipped the fellowship at the wedding so they won't know in fact where is Sister Carrie she's with my dun right now kid she's not feeling well this okay boy you threw me right there I'm like what okay let's remember Sister Carrie in prayer amen I always find a source of of uh uh reinforcement um you know Sister Carrie you know just always right there just right on top of it and brother Trevor also I I mean I think they missed their calling I I I've seen them write a few books uh and uh and and that's good it's good because sometimes we just need that reminder and it's good to read through it isn't it brother Trevor Amen to be able to look back and say Yes amen so um uh the Easter meetings um Lord willing we haven't solidified this uh but a very good chance that it will be a Saturday evening a Sunday morning with a fellowship following and um I guess I should spill the beans I will not be here um we um have accepted an invitation to go to South Africa and uh speak a series of uh Easter meeting there uh several services and um we prayed about that just really felt like the Lord uh laid on our heart to go and um I can be honest with you that in my flesh uh I'm excited but I'm not um I know that uh it will be um a long time to travel and a little bit laborious in in all of the things that will be there but the Lord laid it on me so strong that within the first day after the invitation I actually knew what I was going to preach on and um then the Lord just kept reinforcing that so uh the brothers will be here in charge and then to put on top of that um coming not this Monday tomorrow but in a week Monday and sister Jerry and I will be in Florida uh it's it's work it's work uh we're we're not we're not going and and laying on the beach um uh but brother Danny steeman has us uh invited us sometime back and we'll be there for a Wednesday and uh Sunday services and uh so Brother David uh we'll be uh taking the I never confirmed this with him but well the Wednesday following is confirmed Wednesday before Sunday Wednesday following so sorry we're taking business here but anyway so and then Family Camp brother Barry coffee has confirmed and uh sister Becky I believe if I understand correctly will be coming with him and so it will be a good time they are a wonderful couple uh those of you that don't know them you'll have this opportunity to get to know them they are wonderful couple amen God bless you let's turn in our Bibles I want to speak to you this morning uh kind of a different title but it actually come out of the message and brother brandham put it uh uh in this fashion respect for What the Lord Has Done For You So we just you know want to have respect and you know sometimes we look at things and Define a word and we Define it in a such a way we think oh this is what respect means I look up to this person but there's many uh definitions and we will just um take a Hol of one today but respect for what God has done for you amen I just want to say if the Lord spoke it it's already done we in the humanity look into things and say well if this happens when this happens when the Lord spoke it it was already finished amen that should actually help our faith that should actually be something we anchor on because then when we look at this you know the scripture shows us very clear there's going to be a Rapture you know as far as I'm concerned the rapture has already taken place there's not a bit of anxiety not a bit of fear not a bit of question will I make it can I be part of that while I come short amen the word shows us that there's going to be a catching away and he also showed us that we were the ones that we're going to be caught away and so that should just give us confidence not anxiety and and we hold to that and and we'll we'll touch on a few things this morning amen so let's turn to Hebrews 11 1-4 and uh if if it seems like this is just a little different uh scripture to use uh I want to just uh show you here in a minute or remind you uh this is what um brother brandham used as a foundational scripture in faith is a substance and so I just felt led to just draw this out amen Hebrews 11 1-4 now Faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen because you see once you have it in your hand as it were you don't need Faith anymore sub it's substance and so God is taking this and drawing now pardon me for using these words but God is drawing a concept saying this can be like this and this can be like this and this can be like this and then he's expecting or Desiring for you and I to believe that amen and when we reach out by God's grace and take a hold of that my brother and sister no longer concept reality and we as Sons and Daughters of God are in reality we are not in the abstract we're not in the hoped for we have moved into the realm of reality and I say that with confidence because it is Christ in you can we say Amen to that we we're not sitting here hoping someday we'll meet our Lord Jesus Christ we have met him amen now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice and Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh Heavenly Father we ask you to just bless the service today bless each brother each sister father and Lord those who are not here today by whatever uh situation sickness or circumstance Lord we would just ask you may your presence even at this moment come down upon them Father speak to their hearts Lord for father we want to obey the word when it said not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together but father we know that you are the author and finisher of our faith and you know every circumstance of our life and father you are in control so we commit this day Lord to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Saints now as we look through this very familiar scripture it is my brother and sister the fact that by the by faith the elders obtained a good report and so if this worked for the elders it'll work for you and I amen who has a good report today amen by God's grace we have a good report because this is the same faith that has been All Through the Ages come right down and just listening to the prophet Discerning lives and and and speaking to people and and you know it's so interesting that the Holy Spirit can in such a fashion now remember brother Branham is uh this was back East I believe in Georgia and um brother bram's there and he calls out a lady and and he says you are Mrs so and so and you live on such and such street and I would be able to quote that to you if I had a better memory cuz just having heard it and read it it's h i I'm just already faltering on that amen that's why we need it daily or at least Paul needs it daily just to keep the brain tuned up and and so there's a lady sitting in the crowd in the congregation and she says uhoh he missed that one and so as she's sitting there a little this is Satan my brother and sister coming down and saying I know better than that I know where she lives I've been to her house and he missed that one but what the lady didn't know is in the last couple days this sister had moved moved to a new house and so as she is sitting there and Satan now is trying to an anoint a a doubt or a question mark amen the holy spirit is Discerning not past tense that's right amen not not going and having to look back as it would be into the Yellow Pages to those of you are old enough to know what that is and and seeing you realize the phone book used to have addresses in it and so you know that kind of dates you but anyway um you know not the holy spirit's not going back going now where does she live the holy spirit's on time amen the holy spirit is right here at this moment absolutely on time in our lives amen and so as it is the lady by God's grace it it's revealed that yes her friend had moved yes in fact that was her address yes in fact that was her Affliction yes in fact that was the Holy Spirit yes in fact God healed her am and so we look how God is working in our lives and he he's doing this and my brother and sister uh as my title says today respect for What the Lord Has Done For You amen I don't use a generic title in a sense I want it to be specific what he's done for you and God being an on time God we can look back and say you know I I I just really was on fire for the Lord 5 years ago or or my family was just really serving God Faithfully you know 6 months ago God doesn't want you to have a historical relationship he wants a relationship that's current at this time right now amen as we said in church this morning God wants your relationship to be on time amen and so we look at this and we realize I don't want to say I've shared it here at the church been a time in my life that God has done things I still vividly you know certain things in your life that that are drilled or burned into your brain so you can relive it in detail and and I just give a glimpse of that the time in my life as a teenager backslid that uh sitting in a pickup perched on top of a ravine with one rock holding the pickup now my brother and sister I can go back to that experience where God allowed that one single Little Rock the size of a softball to stop a pickup from falling in a Ravine and I can go back to that and I can go back to that but I want something real today amen I want God to speak to me and touch my life today because you see that was many years ago I was 17 years old when that happened and that time I have been hot I have been cold I have been injured I have been emotionally injured I have been everything on the board in that years in that but I'm coming today knowing that I don't want to look back to that relationship but I want to stand here this morning and acknowledge that for what would that be let's just call it 40 years more than 40 years I've been married 40 years or some 40 some yes math don't matter when you're married that's right I might make a Doctrine out of that I forgot your birthday look we know you were born so you look at this my brother and sister that we can look at the Times the pace that God is doing and and we say thank you we want to be respectful to God to look back and say thank you Lord for everything you've done you've delivered me you've saved me you gave me the Holy Ghost you've healed my body but lord I can't live in the past I'm living in the present but I want to have respect for what you've done because I know that when I honor your word you honor me amen isn't that beautiful God says you know what if you'll just believe my word say Amen to my word then I will bless you and so what he's doing is encouraging us to believe the word to confess the word and when we believe the word and we confess the word then he turns around and says because you believe my word I'm going to bless you boy what a beautiful Circle to live in amen God dealing with us all the time a Perpetual blessing if we will perpetually obey believe and act on the word of God so as we look at this we we see now now don't misunderstand me as we look back through the Bible often times uh we will talk about Enoch we talk about all of these others and we see what God did with them and we create them into spiritual Giants that we never believe we can live at that level but you realize my brother and sister if Enoch was placed here today and he looked you in the face and said hey what you need is a little encouragement let me tell you how I did it yeah we'd have our notebooks and our pin out we would be expecting to almost like write a book and Enoch would say I trusted God yeah right what that simple yes I trusted him and because I trusted him it unlocked in me the ability to confess and live out the word right but we'll have it as though Enoch was a super super spiritual guy then never faced a hardship never had a doubt or a fear or an anxiety never had issues with his children Etc but you see that's not what God's looking for he's not looking for perfect parents he's looking for people with perfect Faith amen a perfect trust in God that's what he's looking for now in the message faith is a substance brother brandham says here may God help us as I read some of the scriptures now over in the book of Hebrews 11th chapter we will begin and read the first three verses listen very closely because my words is just the words of a mortal they will fail but God's word will never fail it's always true and then we go on to the scripture of that now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen by for by it for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God now look my brother and sister as I just spoke to you uh I don't know exactly don't remember when I spoke these words but you see my brother and sister God before the foundation of the world he didn't just say Okay a lamb is slain and your name's on a book my brother and sister he birthed us amen right and it like any birth water and blood see we get an idea that there wasn't a sacrifice before there was a world but there was a sacrifice before there was a world and when that sacrifice was given and he cried out our names positionally placing us that we could come today and be positionally placed now those are not just catchphrase words my brother and sister that's as Supernatural as this Earth hanging in space perfectly on time that they can take and set time years in advance and look back in time perfectly that's how perfect our God is and so our timing of being placed in the Lamb's Book of Life is just as perfect as what they call I think the atomic clock and so it's there that God knew exactly where he would place you and I and by faith my brother and sister God placed you amen you say but does God need Faith no my brother and sister but he's the author of Faith so he had to have faith to author author it he is Faith amen that is God in you and I my brother and sister so God is Faith and so he is speaking That Into You and I today and he says by his word this is God speaking today that this is already in you you don't need to go roam through the deserts and search for Faith my brother and sister you need to believe that you are and when you believe that you are and a part of that perfect plan of God that you can then stand in the word with confidence now I I think that one of the things that's lacking in the world today in fact all the psychologists and all these mental whatever people are saying that there's actually less confidence in society today than there was like right after World War II in the 40s into the early 50s people have less confidence today and so it's there my brother and sister uh isn't it wonderful that we can stand here today sit here today as Sons and Daughters of God with full confidence I am not the least worried about waking up tomorrow morning and finding out I displease God and he disowned me struck me from the will praise the Lord that's right we have full confidence he said I'll lead you and guide you into and these are my words that perfect place we we don't have to go along well what if what if what if talking to a brother doesn't live around here so don't try and overanalyze but I was talking to a brother here recently and uh he put out several what ifs well what if the war with Israel and and and Gaza all starts again okay what if what if Russia we wake up in the morning and the news says Russia has crossed the boundaries with such force and they're headed to the Middle East what if amen I'll tell you what it comes down to before that comes to its climax the prophet of God showed us by the word that the bride is in the house amen so what if amen if these things continues the wars and the rumors of wars what if but we can stop my brother and sister and this will be highly personalized you can just think about it for yourself amen if you cannot look back in your life and see the hand of God in your life then I encourage you to find a place and dig in deeper and pray through amen he's been with us from the beginning he said he would be with us in the end or the finish and in everything in between see some theologians have taken the idea that when Israel was crossing the Wilderness of sin that when he allowed them to go into the Wilderness for 40 years that God had forsaken them nope God did not forsake them they themselves chose that path right God did not choose that path for them right they chose that for themselves we sit here this morning and God by his infinite wisdom is giving you and I the opportunity to choose our path you say but we're predestinated ah predestination doesn't make your path either easy or hard you can make your path easy or hard so predestination my brother and sister is not us being captive God will bring you in whatever Circle he needs to bring you and bring you right back to your correct place will it be hard oh my brother and sister I made reference to this but a brother left serving God when he was I think 17 going on 18 years old and 50 years later he comes back to the Lord and people are so happy to see him back and finally he gets comfortable enough and somebody asks him about his testimony and he said I have just spent 50 years in misery that don't sound like something a man would choose for himself that doesn't sound like a perfect plan but let me just share this I'm I'm kind of semi plagiarizing this off of someone if you don't mind I won't name names so you don't have to but my brother and sister we look at Elijah and what God had called Elijah to do and God gave Elijah a mantle and as he is there with that mantle Supernatural mantal anointing that is there and God's time piece and God's plan is so perfect that he's bringing this forth and he says you know I'm going to come to the time that Elijah's ministry will be over and someone needs to be able to pick up this mantle and wear it and be able to carry the word forward and as they carry the word forward they will become my representation my voice on the earth my brother and sister do you realize that God bringing Elijah in the scene and Elisha coming along that it was years before Elisha was prepared to wear the mantle amen he didn't just come they didn't go across the brook he didn't go away in The Chariot and the mantle fall on Elisha and there it was my brother and sister God trained Elisha he took him through many trials many things he didn't understand down many Pathways and in the end when the mantle fell and it fell on Elisha he didn't have to say I guess I'll have to go to the tailor that mantle was perfect now did God change the mantle or did he change Elisha now I'm telling you my brother and sister the word of God has come and and this will be another subject for us to go off into someday Lord willing but my brother and sister when the prophet went off the scene we have scriptural type that the mantle was going to fall on another people who would become the final voice in a final age and as she was to become that voice did he just throw the mantle out there and say let them make the mantle fit themselves no my brother and sister we are still being molded by the Lord that that mantle will fit on you and I and the Holy Ghost you say but I'm going through these struggles and I thought the Lord was going to make the way smooth before me he has you have no idea what it was before he started smoothing it out but he's taking you and I and he's molding you and I that the mantle of the word you'll find it in the message if you search it out the mantle of the word coming down the prophet of God says we don't change the word to fit us we change ourself to fit the word and so God is doing that can someone say Amen this morning God is doing that we are being changed and I think we need to have respect the what God is doing in our life we didn't just come and believe a message that's right God said you are the message and I'm going to mold you that when the mantle Falls on you and the Holy Spirit starts to deal with you that you will be a perfect representation of my word yes amen I tell you I don't feel like a perfect representation this morning my brother and sister but God's word says he's making us perfect or we are perfect in his side Can someone say thank you Lord amen because we're not going to go out here and recraft right the mantle restructure the mantle I want it to be longer I want it to be shorter I want the sleeves to be hanging over my fingers I want the sleeves to be 3/4 I want the sleeves above my elbows I want it this way I want it that way I want this I want that but my brother and sister sorry to put a negative connotation out here but around the world today we see people who are crafting the message to fit them amen and that's not what God called for God said I want you to be molded perfectly to my mantle and when the mantle Falls and it fits you perfectly you can take that mantle because the power of God rested with Elisha in the mantle it was not Elisha he didn't walk out of there saying praise God I'm powerful he walked out of there knowing that that mantle had come and fallen and the Holy Ghost has fallen on you and I today that the power of the word is crafting you and I into that perfect image of Jesus Christ amen we're not here to turn the message into what we think it should be but the message is here by God's grace to craft us or mold us into what God desired for us to be but the scripture warns us that they would be those people who saying the Lord told me well my brother and sister the Lord told me I'm not required to live your re ration you're not required to live my Revelation but there is only one Revelation amen it's not the revelations of Jesus Christ it's the Revelation right in correct English is singular so we look at this amen where was I we'll just start right here for by the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained a witness what a price to pay to be a witness God didn't just say you know what Abel I'm going to make you a witness just sit down and enjoy yourself here's your here's your drink sit down here under the umbrella Stir It with your little Twizzler stick or whatever they call those and and just enjoy yourself God said you know what Abel I'm going to make you such a representation but it's going to take your blood just as it took my blood before the foundation of the world to seal this witness Who Wants To Be A Witness amen hallelujah amen my brother and sister no carnal flesh is going to say I want to be that kind of witness but I tell you that seed Gene of almighty God down inside you and I is Lord this is not my life never was my life and I don't own anything Lord my house my car everything I have in the bank whatever it might be it's yours Lord and this body is yours Lord and even the Revelation that is within me is yours Lord amen and being dead yet spake now brother Brown here you'll see in the quote um that it says something about the PA systems too loud and blank spot on the tape I think that may be just a little better kind of causes a rebound imagine those things still happen now wish to take my text out of the third chap the third verse rather the last one of the last phases God testifying of his gifts do you realize my brother and sister that what is in you today is being testified of in the natural I get these kind of conversations and it makes me happy I don't take credit for them brothers will put it this way they say oh brother Paul that's such a lovely group of Believers there as I as though I had crafted you into being beautiful people but there is a natural witness amen known around the world that you are a wonderful group of Believers yeah praise the Lord ain't that incredible God testifying if he wrote another book of Acts my brother and sister the Saints of Grace would be listed in there as Paul speaks positively of those little groups and those people that he interacted with amen we would be in in there Can someone say thank you Lord hallelujah and and we're looking here saying but we have struggles we have this we have that it doesn't matter what you think you have what did God say you have amen and God has given you this report that is shared Around The World God has given you this blessing it is not what we did not what we can do not anything special about us but God having giving this good report and as it comes down my brother and sister God working is using you as a witness amen that God is powerful God is faithful God has Saints on this side and that side and far north and far south my brother and sister he's got a body of believer Every Nation every Kindred every tongue and this is God testifying of what he's done for you amen amen God's not needing to testify that I can do this God knows he can do that and anyone that has a seed of faith in him knows God can do that but God's wanting you to know that the work he's doing in your life even if you don't see it he's showing you off as a testimony hallelujah oh my brother and sister maybe we ought to think on those things Amen to be reminded oh sounds boastful brother Paul I'm not talking about human element Saints I'm talking about the power of what God has done for you and I what he changed us from and I think you need to respect that test testimony you don't need to sit back and say oh we just be so humble we'll be this but we don't need to be boasters unless we're boasting on Jesus Christ but I'll tell you what God has done for us we need to respect that we need to say yes God's healed me yes God delivered me yes I had doubts yes I had fears yes this was upon me the Philistines are upon me but God has delivered me and I'm no longer subject to the fear of a Philistine amen because this is what God is doing in our life and as long as we downplay it as though oh that couldn't be for me that couldn't be for me then it won't be for you cuz whether you say you will or you say you won't you're right either way and I say today thank you that God has marked you and I as the bride of Christ has anointed us with his word poured His blessings out upon us oh do we have struggles oh do we have trials can you wait till you get the other side and sit down and talk to job and start to tell job about your woes come on my brother and sister amen job's going to say hey just a second brother I love you so much sister I love you so much but how how long did you lay there and scrape the boils I never have and then you'll start sharing your testimony of the greatest battle ever fought and job would say I never realized yeah but you're here you overcome it was the grace of God Amen he did it for me one day I caught a revelation that it was already settled that when he our lord Jesus stood there at Calvary and said it is finished I caught a revelation one day that every woe that I have right now everything that you are battling in your mind this morning are you with me Saints everything that's a thought that come dragging to church in your mind today has already been defeated by the word of God he said the victory is already been won we should respect what God has done and believe him and stand up and say it is already done it's finished amen hallelujah God testifying of his gifts I believe each one of us sitting here young and old if we could really really focus we would realize what God has truly done for us amen I don't care if you're 10 years old or older than me 10 or 73 whatever maybe we go younger than 10 even some of these children have such a grasp God has been so good to them he's pour His word into them from babes and they understand way more than we give them credit for so it doesn't matter what that age is my brother and sister what matters is how we view the mantle amen are we waiting for someone greater to come that the mantle might fit no sir no sir God is forming you and I as Sons and Daughters of God that as that mantle comes I've seen a little short video it was kind of funny the other day actually the wife comes home and tells the husband I bought you some clothes at the thrift store she says I think they'll fit and I thought this could be something that sister Jerry and I wrote I put a shirt on the other day I'll skip that other whole story you'll get it when I share this with you I put a shirt on the other day and I said Jerry come here here and she comes walking in the bedroom what and I've got this shirt on and I I don't think it fits now I'm not I'm not dinging on sister Jerry but you see my brother and sister that mantle we're not going to have to pull our tummy in and twist a shoulder and try and get that mantle on and neither is that mantle going to be hanging past our fingers and dragging on the ground with shoulders that they all and we're dragging it along that mantle Christ in you amen is a perfect fit amen amen amen God made it just for you that's right oh he uses a what we might pardon me for using it this way he he used it in a generic term the bride of Christ but my brother and sister that Holy Ghost tailor has tailored this word right down so perfect that we realize who we are now I'm talking natural spiritual so bear with me who we are it is a perfect fit God tailored the word for you amen amen when the word is preached about someone who who has had many husbands and you only had one or not even married you don't have to say how do I make that fit my life that was wasn't tailored for you amen and maybe you were a drug addict and the word is preached and it comes and it breaks an addiction that was tailored for you and we need to stop and quit rushing through life we need to stop and say thank you Lord thank you Lord as I look back in my life thank you Lord because you knew what it would take to get Beyond this day have you ever tried to live in the future I've tried I've tried every year sister Jerry and I pardon me for using this as an example every year sister Jerry and I it's already done for us it's already we've already predicted our financial future for the next year sounds like lunacy doesn't it but our Banker says I I want to see your pi picture please bear with me the banker says I want to see your picture as you see it for the coming year when we sit down and with our best knowledge we're going to burn this much fuel we've spent this much on repairs we've done this we've done that and we put all of that together and you'll find it shocking that then when we go over to the income side and we're growing this crop and it's worth this and we do this and these numbers don't add up we don't go to the banker and say well I don't know it shows that we spent you know 250,000 more than we made but you can fix it right the banker is's going to say you fix it yeah so what happens the years come and the years go and you start to grasp I'm talking natural you start to grasp you know what these crops are are cheap we're going to have to tighten this belt tighter than we've ever tightened it before and you come up with a document and you go lay it on the Banker's desk weeks go by finally one day your loan docks are ready they don't call you and say you've been accepted in the Beloved time goes by and they say your docs are ready come sign them come claim bear with me Y what you said your future would be it's time for you to now yes claim it that's right when don't we do a budget this morning Saints yeah where are we going to be a year from now are we going to be losers or winners amen are we going to be blessed or feel like God has abandoned us are are we going to be Overcomers or are we going to just let Leo DEA beat us up do you know that your spiritual budget is what you write it to be amen there's no as it were profit or loss if you ride in there and say you know what I don't know if next year is as hard as last year I don't know if I can hold on my brother and sister you will get exactly what you wrote in your budget amen you will get that unless God intervenes but what God wants you to do is look through the word and say Lord you was with me in 2000 you were with me in 2005 you were with me in 2010 you were with me when we were sick in Co you were with me when the economy fell in the tank you'll be with me today you'll be with me tomorrow you will be the answer to my question amen but if we're over saying I think God abandoned us I don't know if the message is true because brother so so I looked up to him for so many years and he quit so I'm wondering if the message is true I'm sorry he wrote his budget why don't you write your budget why don't you write God's plan for your life and stand upon it when I'm not talking about writing another Bible I'm not talking about writing another message message I'm talking about what you're going to write in your brain and in your heart and when you write the word the word has never failed amen we can look back and we have ample evidence that the word has never failed and we can take that and go forward with that and say I'm going to be bold I'm going to walk out on this limb or this ice or whatever it would be I'm going to walk out there cuz my God has never failed me and he's not going to fail me today and I say thank you Lord and I'm going to write into my own life that I am going to have Prosperity I'm going to be blessed I'm going to have Revelation and God's going to be with me everywhere I go and he's going to guide me amen my decisions won't be my decisions they'll be his decisions because I gave it to him amen amen that's right let me hurry along here where was I and now for my subject is found the first chapter first verse rather pardon me first verse faith is the substance of things H for the evidence of things not seen this day that we're living in you know this quote right here it's been quoted many many times this day that we're living in as such a day of unsettled peace and unsettled rest everywhere can we say Amen to that my this was preached in 1947 1947 and it was unsettled then of course they just come through the war all right but you realize there's been a war ever since oh forget about NATO and forget about this that and the other right amen Satan looked at that and saw hm This truly is the End of Time truly this word is being fulfilled I better get my I better get my soldiers out we better get our artillery out amen our flaming arrows and all of these and we need to get this out here cuz if we don't stop these people now we'll never stop them he didn't stop them then and he's not going to stop them now amen such an unsettled peace unsettled rest people are running to and fro speaking whatever they may speak most anybody can get a following you know the devil used to throw this at me when some of you that were early when the church was up by the post office out on GAR the devil used to throw that at me so what's it mean people are coming to this little church anybody can get a following and I used to be like Lord help me but God's faithful if you don't mind I'll just share this real quick God is faithful there was this man named brother Lonnie Jenkins and for whatever reason of all the things we'll just speak about brother Lonnie for just a moment he had a listed invitations he told me one time he said if I answered every one of these invitations he said I'd have to live to be 120 years old and he said I don't want to do that but he chose to deal with us or got followed What God did and you know it's brother Lonnie oh Paul I can tell by looking at your face that you're insecure let me have a mirror here no I just look like Paul oh maybe Paul does look insecure [Music] brother Lonnie remember brother brandham talking to Perry green if you get off track I'll know I'll talk to you brother Lonnie didn't go that far but he's like brother Paul feel safe I keep track of you if you start to drift or something I believe the Lord would lead me or another brother to straighten you out made me more nervous than I was before but you see my brother and sister what happens is is God knows what needs to happen and he comes along and he starts to reinforce it and he starts to build it up and this is not men boosting men yeah this is God coming along and saying I'm going to prove to you who you are amen that's right we sit here this morning my brother and sister I don't want to sound boastful Brother David would have the same actually every one of you would have the same of the things that God's done to reinforce you to lead you to guide you to do all of this but at that point right there suddenly one day you wake up and you have a little bit more confidence and you realize truly God will correct you he'll wake you up in the middle of the night and say you didn't say that quite right right you didn't do that quite right but it's only when we become dull of hearing that God's not there to correct us we blame it on God but he was speaking we just weren't hearing okay most anybody can get a following no matter what they teach or think somebody will listen to them and it's a day that the prophet spoke of people when they're hungry they'll eat from anywhere if children and people are starving they'll eat from a garbage can that want eat from a nice table but if they are hungry they'll eat somewhere and I'm going to throw this out at you I hope it doesn't offend anybody but my brother and sister if you find yourself uh uh you are starting to dig into the world's movies and the world's music and the world's behaviors you're in a garbage can let's just face it this is not it's okay with God you have starved yourself to the place that you're eating out of a garbage can and in the strong illusion of the age you don't even realize you've climbed in the dumpster and that's where you're living Lord help us I say this in Love to You Saints amen let's just lift a hand lift our heart say Lord keep me from ever climbing in the dumpster I don't need to feed on the dumpster I have the bloody lamb I have the word I don't need a dumpster I don't need Le O deia other than it's here to mold your character and God proving the devil wrong but if you're hungry they'll eat somewhere so I think real true Ministers of the Gospel ought to be up and going ought to be giving the people the right things meet in due season pray for me pray for Brother David pray for the men that come and pass through this church amen because my brother and sister we're not here to give you garbage I've often said this and you mind if I had a heart attack tomorrow somebody will bring it up but I could care less what somebody else thinks but my brother and sister there was a time in my life I really really struggled and I I used to just say Lord if if I ever drift off the word father just let me die of a heart attack I'd rather be dead than preach something false amen I have no desire to be dead so I'll tell you I have no desire to be caught up in something false amen hallelujah boy at this rate we're going to be here all day so the prophet's talking about meet and due season look where the Lord's brought you from Hallelujah my family has roots going back my grandmother was born raised up in the LDS left it I don't know exactly what age but she left that the other side my father was raised in Catholicism God left them when they got married my parents they looked at each other and says we don't want to be any of this other stuff out here and they started searching and they search searched and they searched and it looked like they were Church Hoppers oh you know that's almost a curse word in the message Church Hopper they went over here they went over here they went over here went over here but God's promise is true and one day they found something satisfied that Soul oh my brother and sister forgive me for putting it this way but you know as the years went by and you start to see as a young man you know all the people Pentecostal oriented people that my parents went from here there and what people like jeie Platt bless her heart she had a lovely heart but you know they get to be 70 odd years old and they got 10 earrings in their ears and purple hair and they're dressing like they were 16 and and it's like what did this do and I've been there before when they would say to my mother wow this thing you believe sure has made you a dowy looking person well praise God my mother was a Dy looking person praise God my wife is a dowy looking person we're talking about their opinion amen oh some of you are smiling praise God you're Dy looking people because the bride of Christ was not called to the fashion of the age not called to look like the world not to dump into the dumpster and come out smelling and looking just like the rest of the world the bride was called out washed in the blood of Jesus Christ washed in the water of the word and she's not looking back to say our denomination says but she can look back you got that she can look back and say God came on the scene here and here and here and here and here and he will come on the scene here here and here and here for every need that I have amen I say thank you Lord I want to respect your word and the way I'm going to respect God's word is I'm going to live it amen I'm not going to talk about it I'm going to live it hallelujah we're eating at a king's table not a dumpster amen amen amen Le de seean garbage not a watered down version amen my I had no idea I had that much to preach here yeah let's go ahead let's go ahead faith is a substance paragraph 59 yes see it's the substance of things is hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen you don't see it you don't taste it somebody said I don't feel any better well what's the matter why don't you feel any better if you have your faith according to your faith be it unto you is that right my that's right but I need something I can see well I have an answer for that I believe in being able to see you dive into the word deeper than you've ever dove in before and if you don't see a difference in your life I will stand on the street corner and apologize to you because you can't get into the word that's and not see a change you can't get into the word and not see God moving in your midst oh my one caveat on that offer is you have to give 100% effort that's right none of this well I I over breakfast and no no come on you want 100% give 100% no matter how you feel you're healed anyhow no matter what you see you're healed anyhow see what I mean it's you know it there's nothing can take it out of your heart you know it is just positive act right there oh my If You Could Only See It friends something would take place amen that's it right exactly people when it comes to different things that brother Brown preached they want you to show them in the scripture show me the seals show me show me show me you know I I must be inadequate cuz I can't show them but I have a quote where the prophet of God said it takes Revelation from God the Holy Spirit to reveal that can I reveal the Holy Spirit can I break open the book and say well I'm going to come and act like the Holy Spirit and show this to you but you see without them giving 100% they will never see it and so I got to keep going here the natural just as positive okay let me see it friends if you could only see it friends something would take place if you could only know what I'm talking about something would react right now see it's a positive it's right there just as positive as these other five senses these are of the natural man faith is of God so we'll never find faith if we're looking at it after the natural that's right it'll just never happen my brother and sisters let's get out of the boat let's get in the water amen let's get ourselves baptized not a baptism as into the Lord Jesus Christ in that sense but baptized in the holy spirit so it completely covers us and we're Washed by the Water of the word and then you get 100% sincere brother brandom said God uses chaos how many of you like chaos oh my I don't think there'll be a hand lifted we don't like chaos but the prophet show mes God uses chaos because chaos brings desperation amen maybe we're not desperate enough we we're just living going through life we're finding we've got some music that we know we shouldn't and we're doing this and we know we shouldn't and we're doing that and we know we shouldn't and it's a little iniquity is all right it goes beyond iniquity my brother and sister it goes to the place that we're not desperate we want God to take us in a Rapture as though we were babies yeah in arms just come take me along Lord God wants you to show him you're serious help us all Lord yes amen amen I like this quote natural man faith is of God the natural man can be wrong but God cannot be wrong oh my why make us go to shout and think of it and the people tell me they got faith and say they can't believe in Divine Healing friends if you don't believe in Divine Healing you're lost amen H how you going to if you can't have faith enough for God to patch up this body to glorify him in how more are you going to have faith to believe that God will take this old Mortal and make immortality out of it to take it up we believe in a Rapture but we don't have enough faith for anything else I'm sorry we're fooling ourselves we're fooling ourselves when we come face to face with a rapture we realize we had no revelation of the Rapture because my brother and sister if you bear with me amen the Rapture is already taking place there's already a body change taking place amen and if the body ain't changing you're not in the Rapture right when we're floating through the air this is a vision most people have we're floating through the air God doesn't have a bunch of angels up there with a pressure washer cleaning you up before you get there you're ready to go amen when he calls you amen hallelujah am okay Paul has just had too big of a diet today amen but I want to finish this real quick so do you believe God's got enough to patch up this whole body Hallelujah not only that he's going to change every molecule of it how much more you going to have faith to believe God will take this old Mortal and make immortality out of it to take it up that's a direct Divine Healing oh my there's going to be some awful disappointments at the day of Judgment at the resurrection that's right faith we got to get such a place we'll be translated like Enoch was that's right faith and testimony that it pleased God did not Enoch our following scriptures said that Enoch had a testimony by faith that he pleased God can you imagine saints that God could so anoint you and I with a supernatural confidence that we could stand here this morning and say I have faults but I testify by the word I please God amen amen by the word yes sir I'm pleasing the Lord yes amen see when we get to that place right there Then You' Got Confidence enough to stand up and say there's nothing on this Earth going to detour me nothing on the Earth is going to keep me from the Rapture but I'm telling you not to sound negative but it's the truth and we need to just go ahead and speak truth I still deal with people that are just not sure they're even close not sure that they even have enough faith for a Rapture they for sure don't have enough faith for healing and yet some of them and pardon me for saying this I don't want to offend no one they're believing brother brandom's going to come back and give that to them yeah that's right absolutely right is that what the word says no the word says that when I'm paraphrasing this when he has gone up the the Holy Spirit came down and fell upon you and I and if we have the Holy Spirit what more would it be that God could do we've got the very Life of Christ in us just like the prophet laid it out and said God healed you even if he came back what more could he do amen you're already already amen healed amen Lord help our thinking that's right Lord help us to quit looking at this message and and almost like it's just a story God was with you at your Wilderness of sin that's right he was with you when you crossed over Jordan he's with you you know you'd think when crossed over Jordan that the Philistines would have all just disappeared out of the picture like etes sketch have Philistines no Philistines didn't work that way they had to go defeat every Philistine but they actually had a promise I was just reading about achen the other day it's just almost a scary story Saints yeah God comes down and says okay there's sin in the camp tells Joshua you're going to draw Lots I was I don't know why I thought this when I I read that but I thought that's almost like gambling you know I mean you know that got to be divinely ordained of God that they went through Israel drawing lots and in this nope it's not them guys Drew Lots oh it's in this family here oh it's in this subp part of the family oh achen what's going on and achen confesses and had the unintended consequence of killing his family that day he never got up that morning and walked out and Saidi think I'll just kill my family today sounds good but anointed spirit bear with me of leoda crept in and achen went out and forgive me sisters if sounds pointed but some of those Babylonian garments are really sexy exactly I hope that didn't offend anyone but they're deaf yeah and God won't let it pass God didn't let it pass that's right what did ain's little girl have to do with this equation but you see achen had already planted the seed in his own home and it had come down and affected his whole family oh Lord help us amen sister via would you come I need to just go ahead and stop amen gift of healing not a gift of Miracles though many miracles are performed right along with it but it's a gift of healing the people get well they go out prayed for they come back and my they're healed wait till I leave the city friends after I'm gone long time you'll hear people coming to your churches and saying well that cancer it's gone that Darkness I had why I hear now that deafness I mean I hear now my Affliction why just left me it's just the Simplicity of it it's nothing you can work yourself up to it's no excitement I notice people comeing the line just get to shaken themselves and saying oh God hallelujah amen glory to God now look at that my brother sister I've set in church services right message churches oh pardon me I don't mean to but I've seen them right there in the services in the line right up at the altar and they start jerking and they start doing and oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I'm going to be healed [Music] Hallelujah now let's read what the prophet says it's just the Simplicity of it it's nothing you can work yourself up to it's no excitement I notice people come in line just shaking themselves saying oh God hallelujah amen glory to God go ahead and pop the rest of that don't do [Music] that pretty blind I'm so glad it's not my words you interfere with faith there you see they moved out of the realm of just trusting God to emotionally working themselves up that something's got to [Music] happen come on I don't want to be negative about this but I'll just put it out there I I've done a little research I've talked to brothers that are friends of mine and there's there's just a whole thing that invaded into the message and there's prayer lines and people falling all over the places shaking like leaves screaming and running and doing all this stuff but when the real truth of the next month and the month after nothing changed that's not what we want to be oh do I do this I just was watching a a service I won't mention you know and here was a sister I I I think God just make makes this happen here's a sister she's got her hands up her eyes closed I mean absolutely got her eyes closed and she's just going around the church and she isn't running into people she's not falling over nothing and she's just like I love you Lord I love you Lord thank you Lord for your Holy Spirit I Love You Lord and she's just dancing did she need to jump on the top of the pew she didn't need Scream bounce off the walls step on people push them out of the way no Simplicity the prophet of God says just Simplicity my brother and sister let's look back of what the word has been given to us let's thank God for that word and let's enter into that word and thank God for his grace and his Mercy I'm just going to stop right here [Music] oh just 38 more [Music] seconds you can interfere with faith there you interfere with God come up reverent and just lay your hand up and believe that's all Faith you don't work yourself up to it faith is something that's already in your heart just come and believe see what I mean amen amen let's just trust the Lord Saints let's just believe the word do you need to look back yes I believe God give us this opportunity to look back I was a wretch I was lost but now I'm saved I've got the Holy Ghost I've been healed I've had the word open to me
