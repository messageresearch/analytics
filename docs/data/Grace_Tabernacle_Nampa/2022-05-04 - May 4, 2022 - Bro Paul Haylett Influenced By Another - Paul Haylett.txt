hallelujah hallelujah one without beginning and without end amen i just have to say tonight we could read a couple scriptures here because the songs specials and what brother has just covered it all amen we could just read a scripture and say praise the lord and go home but we're not going to amen so hallelujah first off i hope i don't embarrass anybody but you know just once again it's the burden on my heart our sister tomah his time is rolling on gonna have a baby one of these days i always forget when it is but i just want to encourage you just to lift her up and the baby up in your prayers amen that the lord would just come and everything would just be beautiful amen we have been given this promise saints we're not here saying now i just have a hope but we can stand so firm in the word of god to say i have an assurance that god will come on the scene and we're looking forward to that cute little baby amen now you say how do you know it's cute well sister tomah will tell you it's cute so anyway remember brother vasily on the road happy to have our brother sergey uh home from on the road and uh i just want to announce also i confirmed this with a phone call so we still want to say uh lord willing brother george will be here uh the 20th through the 22nd of may so just a couple more weeks 20. we're going to have uh brother george gave me permission he said um just whatever you want me to do and i was like well let's see weed eat mole so what i want to do is throw out to to brother george uh and i know he'll be open to this i want to have a friday evening in the basement and we're going to get brother george to share a little testimony as he will choose and maybe we can put some questions to him and so we don't want to get too personal right you know brother george told me one time you know that they did a questions and answers and people were like you know what was your marriage like we're we're looking to a spiritual side amen so but lord willing that's what we'll do but i want to put this as details to follow so we're going to look for a lovely time brother george and and uh it will be good and also let's not forget the youth and kids this friday right yes amen okay so um i think i've covered those bases let's turn in our bibles this evening god bless you thank you brother jay amen you know one thing i want to say saints you know uh it's not for me to share but you know sometimes when the stress comes on brother jason that's some of the best song services we ever have i don't know that i'm going to say lord keep him stressed out but i just know they're some of the most beautiful song service amen we spoke to you last wednesday on our position of strength and i was very thankful uh for the presence of lord to come down it was not something we manufactured it wasn't something because it was such a profound sermon but it was god pleased with us as a people to settle right down in our midst and just speak to our hearts and and i'm i'm thankful for that and while this is under that same title uh as it is i want to speak to you uh influenced by another amen and a lot of influence in the world today and a lot of it can be negative right uh we we have concern for our young people uh as they are growing up and and getting anchored in the word of god uh that there's influences out there uh and you know there's an influence in the bride amen that is so strong it changes our life it changes our thinking it changes all of our circumstance and i'm so thankful that we have fallen under the influence of another amen imagine if we had church just under the influence of man wow it would be scary it would i'm serious because we would go into tangents and we would all feel good about a certain thing and that would be the direction we would go and uh you know i read a deal once it said church is not like a carnival we don't have to scream all the time but it doesn't hurt once in a while just a little something out a great big oh i'm priming you for something saints i'm priming you for something let's turn in our bibles to the book of revelation uh the 12th chapter and we will read from 7 uh verse 7 to verse 12. and you know if you wondered sometimes saints um this this scripture oh i hope that my abstract thinking isn't too broad tonight but you ever wonder why there's such turmoil around your world and then you ever wonder why so to speak you wake up in the morning more determined to press on than ever before you realize that's all comes under influence that is not us i have never influenced myself to come to a place i fully want to give myself to the lord it's just not within me and you might say well well just second brother paul i think you understand what i'm saying saints it's god's influence in our life it it is predestination it is the holy spirit pulling on us because this old flesh gets weary and i know it's not you guys but it's people like you that have said i'm giving up and god comes and says eat those words amen revelations 12 starting with verse 7 and there was a war in heaven and michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not now right here's the point we all stop and say hallelujah amen the dragon and his angels prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven in other words they started a whole block fight and got kicked out thank you lord and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him so you see god did not leave satan homeless he gave him a whole nether in essence a whole another battlefield but do you see what the heavenly example was you catch that he's already defeated when he's cast to go into another battle so satan himself is actually in a state of desperation because he's already been defeated and all the tools that he had to fight were ineffective enough that he lost but god said you know what satan i hope you can catch my perspective i whipped you fair and square in heaven i'm going to give you another chance you imagine the devil going over giving you know that double hand clasp is often considered a hand clasp of sincerity and the devil going over and saying thank you thank you thank you for another chance because you see it could have been cast to the pit right there thank you for another chance but you see in the back of satan's mind oh i'm going to have to change my tactics a little bit because everything i was defeated at wait god has given to his children so now i'll have to attack them in a little different fashion because if they actually stand on the word i'm defeated again so what he's going to do is get us to shift off the word that's why since he comes in the way that he does the lust of the flesh the pride of life the cares of life all of these things and he's got to get you in that position because if we stand on the word i'm already defeated again yeah it's so beautiful i love it and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down boy there's i'm telling you saints right here in verse 10 there is just a power packed right just right there the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night and they overcame him oh hallelujah did you read that did you hear me tonight and they who's they hallelujah we are they overcame him by our superior intellect or our great strength in our self and confidence you know we don't want to do anything to hurt our children's self-confidence because they'll need that to take a rapture no see nonsense the devil peddles these ideas no we're not here to hurt anybody's self-confidence but sometimes we just need a whoopin right sometimes we need to as it were the switch took to us makes you wonder in the day and age we live in how many grandmas actually take a switch to their grandchildren they overcame him by the blood of the lamb can somebody speak it with me and by the word of their testimony it's what you have declared jesus christ to be in your life that testimony is powerful that testimony will either put you in an attitude of victory or an attitude of defeat your testimony oh the devil made me say it no he didn't you let the attitude around you the atmosphere bring you to a place to declare victory or defeat that was actually going to be the title of my sermon tonight but i had to preach something that matched brother jason's song service so we're doing good amen but the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death therefore rejec rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth now my brother and sister look here oh i'm going to preach this sermon while you're all standing up amen therefore reject ye heavens and ye that dwell in them the prophet of god said it's not for you this is paraphrasing it don't look for this quote this way it's not for you to wade through the cares of this life when you were called to live in heavenly places so look here this verse can just oh my goodness therefore rejoice she heavens and ye that dwell in them hallelujah anybody dwelling in those places heavenly places amen and woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea that carnal realm that earthly fleshly realm those that are dwelling in that realm woe unto them my heart aches when i see christians so caught up in the world that the influence of the world is greater than any other influence you see what satan is doing he's drawing them out of their heavenly place into a carnal earthly place because he knows this scripture is alive he knows this word is effective the devil's come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he ha but a short time hallelujah heavenly father we ask for the blessing on the word tonight in your name amen hallelujah you may be seated now look i want to come back i i'll probably be doubling back and i'm sorry i don't mean to be redundant but uh you look at this my brother and sister for you see we have this that as a voice in heaven is declaring now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god now my brother and sister salvation strengthened the kingdom of god did not start when god threw the devil out of heaven but god is now declaring this plan of mine is going to now start to unfold for you to see you will now get to see what is going to happen and it's going to unfold before you and as it were you might say like a cinema or or a movie as it were you're now going to watch this all come but you see he's already declared the finish of this and so it's there that we know now has come salvation and strength god poured out strength my brother and sister it's not that we would come and be such weaklings we need to be weaklings unto ourself but in him we have been declared to be strong amen and so it's there that we need to make this declaration because as the word that we are reading here this evening says that it would be by the words of our mouth and i want to tell you tonight that paul in his own self is unable to even stand but paul's standing in christ i am powerful can you take that position tonight i am powerful in jesus christ i have strength amen in fact i am uh undefeatable oh not in my flesh but the christ that is in me has made me undefeatable you say but brother paul i i've had some struggles yeah no problem no problem you've already been declared victorious reminds me if i could just share a little carnal example reminds me i used to in years long time ago be really interested in boxing and it just reminds me there was a few welterweight guys they're the fun ones right the other guys lumber around and knock over houses but these guys are there and you know and bounce around and hit each other and i just remember one time this guy bam he bounces off of the deal and the announcer's like well it looks like he's finished and the guy staggers and gets up and they do their little thing and then for the next couple rounds he just defends himself and he's kind of staggering around and he comes out about the fifth round and you can tell something's changed and he just got a look in his eyes and he goes in and he starts pursuing his opponent you know most of us have the idea we need to run from the devil and hide from him how about saints we start pursuing our opponent how about we start saying if the opponent is in you know i was talking about books to you and if the opponent's in this book this book's gone if the opponent's in this apparel that i wear then that apparel is gone if it's in this music it's gone because what are you doing you're defeating the enemy not by fleeing from him but by pursuing him and in that fight it got to be about the seventh round and everybody was like oh my we've never seen this guy cut up like this we've never seen this guy battered like this but you know what when you look back into the fight you realize what was happening and he was going a certain way and his opponent started thinking oh i've hit him four or five times in the face and in the in the chest with this left hook it works you ever had that happen in your life little something comes in your life and the devil and then he sees you staggering a little time oh and he sees you stagger and the devil's gonna say yep gonna take him out but you know what happened was this man every time he would do that left hook he would drop his right hand and this guy just waited he took it in the face all beat up puffed up rough don't even look like he's got the holy ghost brother trevor but one too many times and the confidence rose too high he dropped his guard a little far and swings at and he just drills him right square in the face so hard once again just like he bounced off the canvas his opponent bounced off the canvas and i'm here to tell you that some of us could tell some stories about how the devil has whooped up on us but i'm here to tell you that overcoming power has already come and the victory's already been won and i don't care how many rounds it takes how long time is the song says that no matter how long it is till it comes we're going to be here we're going to still be fighting the devil's not going to defeat us and we look at this and realize that god is telling us saints what's coming down the path that we have salvation we have strength and we actually can say we are possessors of the kingdom of god amen i think that is so beautiful they overcome him by the blood of the lamb amen and by the word of their testimony and i'm telling you my brother and sister i might be putting a different little spin on this forgive me and they love not their lives in they laodicea not their life in laodicea laodicea had no attraction where it says here's life here's here's all that you have here's your joy here's your satisfaction they love not their life in laodicea because there was something that had been promised something that was so much greater to them that the love of the devil was not able to attract them oh my brother and sister there's something to that now let's just go on here so we're not all night the word taking us back in time as it were this great war that it's talking about that is taking place in heaven now i want to just bring this up to you in this sense and bring it to an example as it were in this fashion uh to uh the elderly as it were if you would go my brother and sister many of them considered the great war not to be world war ii or vietnam korea or any of those the great war was world war one and that was in a time when men still fought in a fashion that they put bayonets on their their their guns and they charged each other and yet there was chivalry if you had shot a man and he was laying there you you did not kill the helpless and and so it was there in the great war as it is and the scripture here in revelation is talking about a great war amen so it is uh the great war for you and i as christians is not world war one world war ii or any other war the great war is what's taking place coming out of the scripture in revelation 12. there is the great war there is the time now i'm telling you my brother and sister because satan has never been a gentleman don't you love how the prophet lays it out that the holy spirit is a gentleman but the devil's never been a gentleman the devil will get you when you're down he will he will do everything he can to decimate your life and destroy families destroy helpless children whatever it is that's the nature of the devil now my brother and sister are young people it's really sad because sometimes the devil attracts them and and quite young he starts to woo them into circumstances of their life that ultimately lead to to death as it were in destruction and he does it so so uh with such a finery that that people don't even realize but my brother and sister the gentleman is the holy ghost he's the one that wants to woo you satan's wooing but he's the one that wants to woo you and then reward you with the greatest life ever amen now this is not like a joel osteen twist on words of greatest life ever are you subscribed to on my twitter and my this and this and that and this and here you can send money this way and that way in this way and that way and we do accept cash that's not a greater life a greater life is free from the condemnation from the assault of the devil oh he'll ravage brother branham i i should have just put that in the sermon brother branham says he'll come around and scratch at your door he's going to scratch at your door but you don't have to open the door and invite him in and in fact you know it i know it works on some animals you know open the door and whoop on them you know that's the only way you want to open the door to the devil is in a position of strength you know when you're beaten down and having a hard day is not the day you say i'm just gonna fight the devil today because he'll overcome you in that condition but it's when peace has settled over you and you have comfort of who you are and the position god has called you to those are the times to face the demons as it were because then you know you're coming in a position of strength to face him amen so it's there as we look at this now look how far back in time this war my brother and sister is actually where our freedoms were won this war in heaven as it were now just take this don't don't get too technical on me okay because we know that as the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world is where our salvation come amen but it's in this war if you'll if you'll be kind to me it's in this war that our liberties were given to us because satan desiring to take you as a slave as a servant to use you and abuse you has come and his intention is clear but he was defeated not only was he defeated my brother and sister he was vanquished he was cast out he was utterly humiliated now you know it's really hard to say you're victorious when you're humiliated take that on the spiritual side as a christian hard to just really talk about i'm an overcoming christian i'm the bride of christ if you've been humiliated but god says i'm not looking at your human humiliation i'm looking at this fact and the fact that if you will just shift your position i'll take your condemnation and i'll put it right there and under the sea in the sea of forgetfulness under the blood of jesus christ so satan knows that you have the key to bind up condemnation we don't have to live under that what we have to do is take that key put it to work amen and bind that commandant but my life isn't perfect brother paul i'm not totally lined up on the word take the key amen put it in the lock turn the lock hallelujah so there that's the battle where our our freedoms were secured as believers as a song says maybe we'll sing it later not by power nor by might but mine by spirit saith the lord amen there's where our victory comes in it is not how long we've served or how we serve or what has been but it is by the spirit of the lord amen see now we go to verse 10 and let me just hit this real quick there was a voice in heaven loud voice in heaven and it says now has come salvation and strengthened king for the accuser is cast down i want every one of you that struggles with accusation with condemnation from the devil i want you to take this scripture tonight and i want you to repeat it to yourself he is cast down he's accusing you trying to bring condemnation in your life from a lower position than you occupy oh come on not a higher position a lower position and he's the one that is always trying to put himself up here so now he's trying to say look you yeah you up there you belong down here but who's going to listen to that come on the bride of christ is not going to oh brother paul can i just get personal for a moment we have accepted his invitation before can someone say amen but we can stand in this position of strength and look at him and say look now satan you've already been cast down once and as the word declares in the future you're going to get cast into the pit which is even lower why what are you telling us that we're down there we're above you we've overcome you and we're moving forward we're learning your tricks and we're done with you hallelujah and i know i'm kind of as i said being redundant but it just speaks to my heart amen and they overcome him by perfect attendance for 42 years in church no saints that's not going to do it and it's not even that we spoke in such a perfect language even though it's talking about our own testimony we overcome him i hope none of you are offended we can say we've got the holy ghost 10 million times in our life and it won't change our position you know that i've got the holy ghost i got the holy ghost i got the holy ghost got the holy ghost got the holy ghost but i'm telling you my brother and sister you take your life the blood of jesus christ and your testimony that i am a son or daughter of god and you start mixing that together it becomes no longer you it becomes him because the blood speaks the blood is alive the blood speaks my brother and sister and he speaks of greater things the scripture says than these so it's no longer what we have said although we should change our testimony our words our voice should be changed to match the word but you can say i'm saved i'm saved i'm a believer i'm a believer if there's no blood or the blood is not applied hey death angel don't come in my house the blood's in the pot oh that wasn't where the blood was supposed to be we have to apply the blood according to the word the blood is in my church the blood is here the blood is there the blood is in my pastor it was in the prophet no the blood's got to be over you hallelujah and in that position then we can come out in a power of st in the position of strength amen i love that my brother and sister overcome by the blood now look i'm not preaching anything else we know we have to have the holy ghost we know we've got to have a life that's lived correctly we've got to apply the word to our life but you'll find that when we get a revelation of one the rest start to fall in place for us amen so as you look at this now i just want to share a few little quick things i i was like oh there won't be enough to even make it and i look down at the clock and i'm like where'd the time go i wonder what it would be tonight if we could climb above the heavens of heaven and look at this great drama as it's getting set together now fixing to come to pass of god and the devil coming to a showdown i'm so glad i'm on the winning side now how can we make that declaration because we caught the revelation of what prophet was preaching in greatest battle ever fought and we realized one of the first things we're going to have to conquer is not go knock the pope off of his office see we've got to conquer the pope that's sitting on this sea i'm glad i'm on the winning side i'm so glad that i follow the lamb because it said the lamb overcame them for his king was king of kings and lord of lords you know all i got to do is get right in behind the lamb and just follow him hey man as he goes through this and this great battle that is taking place i don't have to step out and say okay i'm going to go conquer i'm going to go do this no sir i just stay right behind the lamb and where the lamb goes i go and when the lamb goes to battle i look at him and say i'm going to gird myself amen you know saints i probably shouldn't be this transparent but last wednesday when we were reading that about being girded you know when i got the revelation of that i was standing about right here looking at that screen and it leaped off at me and i thought hallelujah god wants to wrap himself around me and if he's telling me to lift my hands i want to lift my hands and if he wants to change something in my life he has liberty to do it i'm telling you i shouldn't it would have sounded more spiritual if i just acted like i caught that somewhere else but i want to tell you i just caught it right here standing in front of you sharing that it just leaped out at me and i was like wow wrap yourself around me lord not some just loose sloppy garment but wrap that perfect word right around our lives and let it pull up into every place that it needs to be pulled and let it be sown that my life would fit inside the word oh hallelujah amen i'm so glad i followed the lamb because it said the lamb overcame them for he was king of kings and lord of lords now let's go saints into hebrews the seventh chapter amen and here as we look at this now i've cut this short for the sake of of the the thought tonight for time and you know it's all here you can find it dig deep in it dig deep deep deep deep deep into it for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god now the prophet of god says that was god in priesthood all kinds of denominations got it all like another office special guy special envoy ambassador whatever you know it just makes sense to me what the prophet of god said he said this is god himself coming down himself revealing himself and also speaking words to abraham that only one with royal authority would be able to speak so there's some things that god just comes himself now we get a good firm grasp on on the holy ghost amen and and godhead and you realize that god going to assure that you make it come down himself into you and i he didn't leave it to just some other you see the prophet of god study this out prophet of god never said now you know after you guys kind of hang out with me for a while you'll probably no sir he said my job paraphrasing my job is to introduce you to jesus christ so actually the introduction bypassed in this context bypassed the prophet because he was making the introduction now you would never say oh brother trevor let me introduce you to sister kerry and then when you go to stick your hand out i knock it down and say no you can't you can't do that god said i want to be introduced to you personally just like when jerry and i 39 years ago thank you for your prayers we had a lovely lovely anniversary getaway got to hear some great preaching amen got to see friends we haven't saw for years it was beautiful but you know that little girl that was a friend of jerry's and it you know facilitated introducing us has jerry knows where she lives jerry knows how to find her i have no phone number for i have no address for why because i got introduced to the one that mattered to me amen and you know where i'm coming on that amen so it's there look at this this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace so we see how in this position that it was melchizedek coming into the very presence of abraham and speaking to him and sharing with him and abraham recognizing isn't this beautiful recognizing the word for his hour was standing in his presence he didn't say hey god sent a messenger he knew who he was standing in front of and what it did was it brought abraham to the fulfillment of the word you know isn't it amazing i don't want to step out too far on this ice but isn't it amazing after all the mistakes abraham made god said i imputed it to him for righteousness imagine not like we're going to stand before the lord and say now lord you did that for abraham you have to do it for me i'm going to tell you right now what it is is god's going to fulfill the very promised word that was in abraham in you you don't have to come and say i i i want to claim that promise you are that promise you are that word for the hour being fulfilled and being brought forth the very life of it uh being placed in a position to to express itself now look at this my brother and sister uh and we look at this and now let's not forget this great fight that we've been talking about this great fight is going on right now around us but look at the beautiful types of scripture that it's nothing less than god himself has come down in our generation people are like no no it's just some representation of god that's good that's good for you as the song was sung tonight there are those who want to be part of the bride but god chose us special people oh about jumped out of my seat god chose a special people my brother and sister i didn't do the choosing you didn't do the choosing god did the choosing let's hear the call of god when he said come my son come my daughter because this is not some just little deal of vanity this is god's expression himself to you and i and he's coming along and he's made his choice hallelujah but what does the word tell us all that was in god was poured into christ all that was in christ was poured into the church which is us right so what is he saying here he's telling us the king of righteousness has been poured into you amen all that the king of righteousness was he has poured into you my brother and sister this is not just god coming to redeem some puny little people he said i have declared that he that is filthy will be filthy still and he that is holy will be holy still and the word of god come down and calls this separation and we said i am not identified in this filthiness i am identified in righteousness that's my heart's cry that's who i see in the mirror i see righteousness in the mirror but when i make mistakes i'm sorry devil i'm sorry devil i'm not coming down to your position i have been called into heavenly places and that's where i choose to dwell oh there's times i dip into the potholes of life but i am not going to take up residency in the pothole hallelujah so the king of righteousness has been poured into you that's what the word says and the king of peace is resident in you that's why my brother and sister we say well you know do i have the holy ghost we've all struggled with those things and i'm telling you these thoughts these interconnecting thoughts were already flowing today have nothing to do with anything that we've bumped into this was part of my part of my thought today my brother and sister you see what it is is the righteousness of christ is beyond us the word says our righteousness is filthy rags so my self-made righteousness is just nothing but a bundle you know it's pretty funny jerry and i had to go take care of some business today and and uh we're driving down the road and and we're coming up to a stop sign or and i'm like what is that what is that i was sure it was like a dead animal it was just a rag all fluffed up looked like a raccoon just couldn't quite put a nose and legs on him but you drive on up the road and there's a dead deer i felt bad for the little guy the devil got to him before he ever got mature enough to understand that cars kill do you follow me so looking at this now as it is the king of righteousness he's filling him us up he said but paul i don't feel too righteous well you haven't necessarily if you follow me been filled completely right people say well when we're completely filled with the holy ghost i think god's got grace for us because i think the filling will never stop he will be pouring himself into us even as we walk in glory from glory to glory brother david hit it right on the head right there from glory to glory he just keeps pouring itself so if you're looking to be completely so filled with the holy ghost that nothing will bother you then you're going to be disappointed in yourself because this flesh is the the vehicle god chose god chose it for you brother barry made some comments that if you listen to the sunday morning service you'll you'll understand i'm not going to elaborate on them but it is an eye-opener and he made a declaration of folks up there and he says now if the things that have happened here in the northwest hard things disappointing things but if god had not allowed it it would have never happened you say well perfect will permissible will this will that will my will there will know my brother and sister if god doesn't want it to happen it ain't happening and if god wants it to happen you can't stop it brother barry went on to say this is what has caused people to move from here and there and to go and things to change it's beautiful i'm not normally kind of a pep talker for somebody's sermon but it was a beautiful sermon amen so you see all that was poured into christ rice righteousness saints was poured into me poured into you holiness poured into you and i amen peace you say brother paul we live in a stressful world imagine what it'd be without the holy ghost we'd be a bunch of drunks partying drunk in the alleys and whatever else would be the filthy stuff we won't go into but you see my brother and sister god really has brought peace to us you say we have struggle in our house you have peace in your house because you are going to change your vocabulary you're going to change your language you're going to change what you are focused on and you're going to change it to the realm and say god said that he is the king of peace and he is in me and he is in my house and there's going to be peace in my house there's going to be righteousness in my house there's going to be holiness displayed in my house and you start speaking out and you will see it start to rise up but my brother and sister the devil comes and he tries to prick the little balloon as it were because he wants it to burst to prove to you he can still get to you and he has burst your little balloon amen but i'm telling you there's coming a time and it is now that the bride of christ is being prepared against the pressure of laodicea and she can stand the pressure not only can she stand the pressure she will thrive in this pressure because she'll be able to say i can't be burst satan you lost the original battle you lost that battle and when you lost that battle you lost me you can't make a claim on me now because you lost me in the original battle not a circumstance of laodicea not a spirit story in laodicea i was sealed and you were sealed before the foundation of the world and filled up with righteousness and filled up with holiness and filled up with peace and all of the virtues of god what we got to do is just keep the balloon a little cleaner so we can kind of look inside there as it were and see what it is god actually poured into us oh caught up in cares of life caught up in this caught up in that i don't know i know just uh i won't mention any names or nothing but i had just a lovely conversation with a young man raised in a message home drifted away from god came to a place in his life that he didn't know if there was even a god starting to believe there wasn't even a god but look how god works he's out mowing a yard with headphones on of all things a man who's not sure he even believes god exists is listening to the prophet tell me god doesn't have a sense of humor the devil's like it doesn't even exist it's not real but there's something inside there and this young man many people had said he's just kind of went too far he's out on the fringe i don't know how he'll come back but i'm telling you he told me this himself face to face i'm mowing the yard and i'm listening to the prophet and the prophet is speaking you know the the the circumstance the woman's standing there and brother branham's desiring it and brother branham says to her and the devil lied to you and this young man's on the lawnmower and those words ring in his hair the devil lied to me and he starts sobbing and gives his heart to the lord on a lawn mower not in a church service not in a revival not in an altar on a lawn mower come on saints my god is an awesome god he's a powerful god and he has already won the victory and he's already given me the victory given you the victory hallelujah not to stand here defeated woe unto me stand up remember the scripture it's going to be by your voice your voice oh brother paul you're asking me to do the impossible you want me to declare victory when i don't feel victory yes tell me if you'll show me scripture where god said you feel it then you'll believe it oh my brother and sister he said you believe it and then you will feel it hallelujah the devil's tried to twist this thing or we got to feel something to respond to it let the word become real lord let the word tonight become real lord that we can take a hold of that and not be moved from the word by our feelings do that's the case i'm gonna get well nobody's on that second pew i'm just gonna go over there lay down because that's how i feel right now well you would join me you know that because we just don't always feel like wednesday night do we brother jason and i as i joked with him earlier we have some conversations in the back brother jason i'm not making fun of brother jason it's just kind of how it is he just comes in tough day brother jason yeah but we're gonna have a good service tonight hallelujah amen and that's what we have expectation don't we brother jay we're not going to come out here into the pulpit we're listing a couple little short very short i mean really short like cut the course in half short no sir i marvel saints when i come out here i'm not boasting on jason i'm boasting of this king of righteousness that's been poured into him this king of peace is important but i can't tell you how many times i walk out here and i sit down there and i'm like that ain't the guy that was in the back room hmm oh i know what it is he's putting on a smiley face you know the same smiley face you guys have i'm so happy to be in church just so glad to be here pull our phone out no no no no it's genuine saints you can walk in those doors you can walk in those doors you can walk in here stressed and and burdened and tired and troubled in the mind but what it is my brother and sister we have stepped into the presence of the king of peace and then all of those things that had our mind tore up are suddenly subject to the king of peace oh we're not hypocrites we're not liars we have come under the influence of the king of peace and suddenly it's good in my world it's good in my life it's good in my family because the king of peace has now stepped into our presence or however you like to put it we come to him he comes to us amen you can't come unless he calls you we know that but i tell you you have to step across the threshold yourself amen can can you say amen to that i can't tell you how many times i'm so troubled i joke with my wife the joke about the preacher they don't want to go to church why should i go to church why should i go to church because you're the pastor but you step into the presence of that king of peace and suddenly all is okay all is okay i can go from tormented troubled doubting myself doubting everything around me to worship him and just a heartbeat because the presence of the king of peace has been poured into us oh can somebody say thank you lord hallelujah i'm so glad otherwise we'd be neurotics like the rest of the world saints we'd be just as neurotic as they are don't think because you believe the message that that took that away from you what took you away i'm plagiarizing this and i it's not really plagiarizing if you say it but i tell you brother barry brought out a really awesome point that really stirred my heart and he said you can believe and act on the word of god in this hour because of your proximity to jesus christ it's not the books on your shelf it's not who you know where you came from it's your proximity to jesus christ is what makes this word alive oh lord help me get closer help me get into your presence lord i want a supernatural saints not so we can boast on it but to live in that presence of god oh hallelujah hallelujah now i want to go i got to hurry here amen oh my in the seven church ages this is a little bit lengthy but i'll just try to go through it because in this my brother and sister is one of the keys of how you have come into the presence of the the prince of peace the prince or king of peace and the king of righteousness this is this is a little bit puts it right in here but now he's standing in the midst of the church aren't you glad tonight amen as he stands there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of god this is another creation this is not a creation that these people out here who want to be wicked even have a clue they have no understanding amen this has to do with the church which is you this is a special designation of himself now imagine my brother and sister how it is to be able to come and sit in the presence of god and have god himself mark you it's not the church it's not the message as it were it's god himself putting a special designation on you you know have you ever done that been somewhere and something special happens it's pretty funny how that works sometimes brother trevor sister carrie we had a lovely time in florida did we not and when we got on the plane in front of you and they moved us up into comfort plus i just know you guys thought why them but the problem was is that special designation of comfort plus was right across from the bathroom door and i was like i would gladly trade almost anyone on this plane their seat as the flight from florida to seattle the door went bang bang bang bang bang bang some special designations aren't worth what the devil wants to give you oh you can be rich you can be powerful you can be an influencer scrap all them designations i want to be designated as a son of god i want to be designated as this is one in whom i am well pleased and the whole time you might be going through a fiery trial and god's over here saying i'm well pleased with you brother trevor and you're like wait the house just burned down on the wheels fell off the car and then we realize that is not what it's about this is what it's about this is what we're fighting for now look here there's another creation this has to do with the church a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom oh created his own bride oh my brother and sister that's beautiful that's beautiful oh but i'm just short i'm just this i'm not smart like them i'm not strong like them you are god's created tabernacle amen rejoice in who you are rejoice in what god has done in your life and his promise to fulfill after all you know if you're not as a man over five let's say i'm five ten and a half so if you're not over 510 you don't make the rapture if you're not got beautiful hair that's curly sisters you're not making a rapture if your church don't have more than 300 people god's not there come on i am a tabernacle you are a tabernacle amen almost said if you don't have curly blond hair but we all know there's only one in our church that has curly blonde hair hallelujah but look my brother and sister it is not about us god said i need diversity in my body i need diversity in this world and i'm going to show the devil that as it was in this original warfare that this mere mortals i'll still beat you come on you got to think about it as though this is the alley turf war not too smart not too strong not to this not to that not this not that not that not that devil i'll still beat you because i'm going to pour my spirit into them and the devil's there going hey come on that's not fair but you see he didn't give up because i think god might help i don't know don't make a doctrine here god might have gave him a preview of these vessels he's going to pour himself into and i'll just i'll just bring this right home so i wouldn't offend anybody the devil would look down on paul haylett and said i can beat him but what he didn't know is every day is sweeter than the day before every day there's something happening and it's not paul hey let the devil has slapped him in the dirt so many times but i'm telling you it's the holy ghost rising up we sing the song new testament church rising up i'm rising up are you rising up amen because we are not going to be defeated because the war is already over and we've been declared victorious all i got to do is say only believe lord i believe i believe lord i believe what you said about me and your word hallelujah heavenly bridegroom created his own bride brothers can you imagine what that'd be like it took some of you a moment to catch that didn't you yes sir she would be so tall she would be this she'd be that and then you would remember that you were cracker barrel and saw that deal that says um looks don't last but cooking does good cooking yeah not just cooking come on but what god knew just like our wives come on brothers i'm going to make this point drive it home to you just like our wives have got better as the years go by are you with me you follow me this bride of jesus christ is getting better greater stronger more in love more committed as the years go by oh thank you lord hallelujah and as the spirit of god he came down and created in the virgin mary the cells from which his body was born i want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of mary for that body it was not enough for the holy spirit to simply give life to a human ovum supplied by mary that would have been sinful mankind producing a body that would not have produced the last adam oh hallelujah this has nothing to do with who my mama was and who my daddy was and whether we are german or or or uh irish or whatever it is it got nothing to do with that amen hallelujah amen wouldn't have produced the last adam of him it was said lower body thou hast father prepared for me god not mary provided that water please move us forward brother isaac amen hallelujah mary was a human incubator and she carried that holy child i want you to think about that what are you prophet of god said you didn't come to save this flesh you're nothing but an incubator but it's not a natural baby it's the spirit of god the holy ghost on your soul and it's incubating the presence of almighty god hallelujah hallelujah now look that wasn't just to be put on pause i've been a christian for 40 years i'll still fight a buzz saw and i still curse no sir that somebody took the spirit of god and put it on pause and thought that that was what god wanted god wanted that to grow because he's the father of righteousness holiness peace joy love we could go right on down the line he's the father of that he's fathered something in us my brother and sister it has to grow or it's dead come on she carried that holy child brought to him to birth it was god man he was the son of god he was of the new creation man and god met and joined he was the first of this new race oh my goodness people say you guys think a lot of yourself well actually no i blame it on my dad my dad's the one that said you're special you're a new race you're the one i've decided to put my life into hallelujah it's not my fault it's my daddy's fault but i'll stand there with my daddy amen i'll stand there hallelujah amen he's the head of this new race colossians 1 18 and he's the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence all things amen second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creation opens have passed away you know what this scripture said right there saints no more flimsy excuses no excuse of why i had a horrible pastor as a child hurt me desperately hurt me sorry are you new creation or not i don't say that mockingly or or irreverently but we're a new creation it's time for us to step into the promise that god has for us not what some man in the past some church in the past some uh make-believe theologian in the past come on it's time for us to step into the promise of god's word amen he's a new creation all things passed away behold all things are become new amen all things are become new then you can see that through man was of the old order or creation now in union got to get really close i don't mean to be crass saints but you understand what i'm saying you got to get really close you got to get really close you're going to bring a baby into this world you've got to get really close if we're going to become the very manifestation of christ be impregnated by the word of god for our hour we're going to have to get really close oh lord help us to get closer help us lord to get closer amen there you can see that through man was the old order of creation now in union with christ become the new creation of god ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship oh my those of you complain about what god's done for you i want you to read this tape it to your mirror when you get in there you know if come on saints if you'll do that in the natural you'll do that in the spiritual you can't criticize god's work in your life in the flesh or in the spirit and be one in the mind of christ anyway so those of you have trouble with that forgive me see the new creation for we are his workmanship created in union with christ jesus unto good works amen sister ruth if you'd come i'm gonna i'm just gonna have to force this to i've got just a little bit more as far as quotes go but i've got way more way more do you see what i see that's why he could this is why he could look down in the last age when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as the author of this new creation of god why because we because we this or that no sir his sovereign power can somebody lift a hand and say thank you lord for the power can lord i say thank you for the influence of another that has come into my life to cause me to turn to the word not my emotions not my fears not my circumstance but him amen this is what god's doing his sovereign power my brother and sister you see god's still out here you know in the beginning my brother and sister that great battle where satan lucifer was trying to win and he he lost then and he thought now i'll come down in in these ages and i'll i'll take on i'll take on humanity those people who claim to be christians i'll take them on do you see where he missed it because god come down and put on your flesh and then satan says wait this that i'm fighting right now is very familiar do i know you and the devil's looking at you and i and he's going wait they're just flesh they're just humans i conquered all of them and i conquered all of them but these fight back not only they fight back they're victorious i don't get it i don't get it but you know what god's marked us god's marked as saints and i'm telling you that the devil slow but sure in stages of your life has come to say no no this can't be that's the same exact spirit same exact nature same exact attributes and they fight in exactly the same way it is written it is written it is written hallelujah that's why the word has to be our defense hallelujah amen okay just i got one thing before we just go to a song or two amen this is a lovely sermon and i had this i had this thought i just like lord i'd like to just touch on something there and i was just looking through there and actually you know the way the the the deal brings up everything that's got that in it so it actually brought up the word righteous within righteousness and i read it and i was like lord forgive me it was like a sermon to me lord forgive me now i know none of you have ever stepped into that realm but actually i mean i just want you to understand the influence that that has and i can't help it that i'm a better christian than you are i can't help it that none of you have revelation of this message like i do could we say this together saints just repeat what the prophet of god put right here so it'd become our words is that possible okay let's just just say it by god's help this morning i want to forsake my self-righteousness my own ideas and my thoughts of pleasure and big time and sin that i've lived in and i want christ to put his robe on me this morning that i'll use his robe i know it's a perfect one oh hallelujah you know what brings us to that the influence of another amen the influence of god in our lives oh can someone say thank you lord oh i just i just stirs my heart saints how much god loves us that he would bring us to a place that he just keeps influencing just keeps influencing just keeps influencing and we wake up one day and say that's who i want to be oh where did that come from amen amen come from our lord jesus christ pouring his righteousness and his peace into you and i amen now remember i'm preaching to paul but you might have overheard me i have to speak peace into my life i have to speak peace into my marriage i have to speak peace into my house no one else can speak that peace i have to and lord let that apply to our hearts hallelujah oh my saints i have i'm not going to apologize amen hallelujah you don't know what a complex i have there saints that thing looks like a big woolly bear amen yeah brother barry had a joke and i won't get it right but i just struck me because my mind went somewhere else you know a lot of things can hurt you but that not really but bears can hurt you and i tell you what the devil would come he scratches he bites you know because you don't know but what's scratching on the door might be a cute little puppy or a grizzly bear hallelujah we'll let the work we'll let the word open the door amen let's just stand i like to sing that song and just come to me as i was studying come holy spirit we need thee amen i need you lord i know i can't make it not another step i am a complete absolute failure without my lord jesus christ amen hallelujah brother jason come help me holy spirit i need spirit o lord i pray in thy strength [Music] just sing it as a prayer to the lord [Music] in the stream [Music] one more time saints oh lord i'm inviting you to we're asking you to go

revelation of jesus christ is in a direct correlation to our proximity hallelujah you need a little more overcoming you need a little more strength maybe things in your life buff at you i know they happen to me we just gotta get closer closer we have time for just one more song hallelujah hallelujah this meant little light a little livelier i don't want to break the presence of god but you know
