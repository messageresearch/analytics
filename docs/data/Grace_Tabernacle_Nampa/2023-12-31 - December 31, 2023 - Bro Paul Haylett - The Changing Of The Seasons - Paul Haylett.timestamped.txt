[47:26] Lord and we thank you for that Lord my
[47:28] mind always takes me back lord through
[47:31] the scripture when there was victory in
[47:34] the camp in Israel Lord there was a
[47:36] shout and Lord let our voices be lifted
[47:39] before you today in a shout that we have
[47:42] victory in the camp there is victory in
[47:45] this bride of Christ there's victory in
[47:47] Grace Tabernacle there's victory in the
[47:50] lives of the believer today Lord we say
[47:53] thank you thank you thank you thank you
[47:56] Lord Jesus we lift our hands and our
[47:59] hearts in praise to you oh Hallelujah
[48:02] may your Victory father your Victory be
[48:06] upon our lips all the time oh Hallelujah
[48:11] Lord we thank you we thank you
[48:15] hallelujah thank you Lord
[48:18] Jesus thank you Lord
[48:21] Jesus
[48:23] hallelujah amen good to be here today
[48:27] Saints
[48:28] Hallelujah God is so good to us I think
[48:32] if we in the flesh could ever truly
[48:34] recognize just how good God is to us
[48:37] amen we would never have a sour note
[48:40] another sour moment we'd never have a
[48:42] frown but sometimes the devil he just
[48:45] brings things in such a way and you know
[48:47] what he does he never comes and says I'm
[48:50] the
[48:51] devil he comes in our own thoughts in
[48:56] our
[48:57] [Music]
[48:59] emotion and he places the
[49:02] blame on
[49:04] us never claiming it for himself it's
[49:07] always about what you failed to do well
[49:10] devil let me remind you today that when
[49:12] the word went through Heaven you failed
[49:15] to believe
[49:16] it so you are the original I just was
[49:19] reading this brother Brown I'm talking
[49:21] about this the devil is the original
[49:23] unbeliever that's right so when he
[49:26] starts talking about unbelief he should
[49:28] know amen amen but we're not amen
[49:31] hallelujah we were not created to be
[49:34] unbelievers never moveed to manifest the
[49:36] life of the unbeliever we were called to
[49:39] be Believers can we say Lord I'm a
[49:41] Believer this morning I believe your
[49:43] word today Lord It's a confession of my
[49:46] lips it's the thoughts of my heart it's
[49:49] everything that you created me to
[49:51] be Hallelujah
[49:54] believer well brother Paul how is that
[49:58] well you see Saints it's so simple God
[50:01] just hid it right in the word and he
[50:03] just created Me and You In His Image
[50:06] that's it he's not an
[50:10] unbeliever I I will try to share this
[50:12] but uh brother Stan sends his greetings
[50:14] to you brother Stan sister Merlene
[50:18] brother Stan sent me a just wonderful
[50:21] little video clip you have to approach
[50:24] it in the right mindset you might say
[50:27] not view the man that's sharing this as
[50:29] a theologian but um I will I will share
[50:33] it and I no doubt it will spread its way
[50:34] through the church and if you don't get
[50:36] it just ask because you see this man is
[50:38] laying this out my brother and sister
[50:41] that God is on such a different plane
[50:43] that we are we keep trying to bring him
[50:45] down to our level yeah instead of just
[50:48] giving him Liberty Amen to bring us up
[50:51] to his level we try to explain God In
[50:54] Time
[50:56] but God is Not time amen God is eternal
[51:00] he can't even operate on the plane of
[51:04] time it it'll be good I think it'll
[51:06] bless your hearts amen good to be here
[51:08] let's remember our sister April um you
[51:12] know just uh I I I don't want to speak
[51:14] in a public forum in that sense but just
[51:16] lots of little things happening you know
[51:19] uh you know um you know somebody I just
[51:23] saw this little deal the other day
[51:25] and it you can apply it to everything
[51:28] but it says what do
[51:29] hospitals uh have in common with the
[51:31] rest of the world it's called
[51:34] politics and um so just pray for sister
[51:37] April as she has to work in that
[51:40] atmosphere where where you know there's
[51:42] a lot of unbelief a lot of things there
[51:45] but let her life be a witness let it be
[51:48] a representation I didn't even know
[51:50] brother Trevor was gone anywhere so I I
[51:53] guess I'll just have to welcome him home
[51:54] early amen uh so God bless you each and
[51:59] every one I I felt bad brother manasse
[52:02] come and uh and I didn't get connected
[52:05] with him and I kept saying I was going
[52:06] to call him telling myself this and uh
[52:10] me doesn't always listen to me and um so
[52:13] I I didn't get him called but God bless
[52:16] him um I would just like to um speak to
[52:20] you
[52:21] today
[52:23] uh in this here
[52:31] the changing of the
[52:32] seasons you know me and the iPad are not
[52:35] agreeing here
[52:38] um
[52:46] Allelujah of course you know maybe iPads
[52:48] are a little closer as spiritual than we
[52:50] think they they won't let you just touch
[52:52] anywhere on the screen they you have to
[52:54] be precise You' got to touch the right
[52:57] spot amen hallelujah I want to speak to
[53:00] you this morning uh I first off here I'm
[53:04] I'm a little scatterbrained so there's
[53:07] this family that live up north and
[53:09] there're these wonderful people and
[53:11] they're really nice people and sweet
[53:13] people and uh we're happy to have them
[53:16] people here today and I want to just
[53:19] welcome each and every one uh in the wol
[53:22] family's cousins coming together and and
[53:25] uh traveling and being here and and
[53:28] we're just happy to have each one of you
[53:30] and uh God bless you um you know it's
[53:34] one thing I I say this in a context so
[53:37] understand me I'm finding Liberty in
[53:40] getting
[53:42] older because I'm suddenly things like
[53:46] you know being concerned about how
[53:49] people look at you accept you it's
[53:52] slowly falling away you can be a little
[53:55] more blunt and not go home and beat
[53:57] yourself up over it and um you know uh I
[54:01] just be blunt today my brother and
[54:03] sister we should only have in the
[54:05] context of what we're speaking today we
[54:07] should only have one goal in this life
[54:09] period that's it now if God blesses you
[54:12] speaking a little bit to the young
[54:13] adults on this if God blesses you and
[54:15] you have a good job good career good
[54:17] future amen that's all well and good but
[54:20] when you stand like the Rich Young Ruler
[54:21] one day you would give your kingdom just
[54:25] to have them dip their finger in the
[54:28] water and bring it and here's our time
[54:32] here's our season let's not waste it
[54:34] amen let's let's just not let the things
[54:36] of this world the cares of this world
[54:38] the joy and pleasure of this world
[54:40] actually when brother randam describes
[54:42] it to us as Satan's Eden he hid it so
[54:45] Square on the head that as it would be
[54:47] as a carpenter uh used to frame houses
[54:50] you know your goal when you were working
[54:52] you got paid by the square foot of
[54:54] framing a house house and your goal
[54:56] would be to drive the nail home as
[54:59] quickly as possible to move on and
[55:03] that's what we need to do in this day we
[55:04] need to drive the nail home get it
[55:07] settled that we're we're we're just done
[55:09] it's clenched and nothing's going to
[55:11] shake that or pull that loose and and uh
[55:14] that's really ought to be our complete
[55:16] priority of the day fashion and pleasure
[55:19] and all of these things are nothing but
[55:21] the devil's distraction and I know that
[55:23] doesn't sound very blunt but uh
[55:25] sometimes that can be a little
[55:27] straightforward uh let's let's make sure
[55:29] that we understand what's going on
[55:30] around us amen I want to speak to you on
[55:33] the changing of the seasons and um I
[55:36] want to also I'm I'm just really kicked
[55:40] about here let me back up brother Jose
[55:43] Hernandez is coming down from Tri Cities
[55:45] next Sunday going to speak for the
[55:47] church here and I believe you'll be
[55:50] blessed I every time brother Jose comes
[55:53] he just brings it in his way and I it's
[55:56] just I always enjoy that just the
[55:58] Simplicity of the gospel and the
[56:00] Simplicity of the Gospel doesn't mean
[56:01] the man bringing it is
[56:03] simple it's just the word broke down in
[56:06] a form that is readily acceptable for us
[56:10] amen and so youth group will be moved
[56:14] back a week to January 19th and I don't
[56:17] know brother Isaac I maybe got the cart
[56:20] in front of the horse here but he was
[56:21] talking something about having some kind
[56:24] of a uh uh a little thing and I will
[56:27] leave that uh for brother Isaac to
[56:30] announce uh but I believe that would be
[56:33] the Friday before is that kind of what
[56:35] you his mind so uh be looking for
[56:37] brother Isaac to make an announcement uh
[56:39] concerning all the musicians and uh and
[56:42] what forth here amen this evening
[56:46] uh I don't know the official start of
[56:50] this evening will be 6:00 p.m. and then
[56:53] uh those who want to come a a little
[56:55] earlier 5:30 or something like that more
[56:57] than welcome amen we want a little more
[56:59] time to Fellowship then come a little
[57:02] earlier uh I think that we're going to
[57:04] have a very simple finger food type of a
[57:07] atmosphere maybe um uh sister Jerry's
[57:10] got potatoes she needs to get rid of
[57:12] before we go to Belgium so I think we're
[57:14] having some potato soup
[57:18] amen see we all have a different
[57:20] perspective how we look at things right
[57:22] she looks at it like I want to make
[57:24] potato soup and looking at it like oh
[57:26] she needs to get rid of these potatoes
[57:28] so anyway um the service will start
[57:33] 7:30 not exactly pinpointed doesn't have
[57:36] to be um absolute but we don't want to
[57:39] miss that Mark and then
[57:41] 8:30 or so or very soon after we will
[57:44] have communion let's turn in our bibles
[57:47] if we would this morning 2 Corinthians
[57:49] the 5th chapter 17th verse through the
[57:52] 21st verse amen amen hopefully you all
[57:56] brought your Bibles amen you should
[57:57] never go to church unarmed
[58:05] amen would desire your prayers as we go
[58:08] to
[58:09] Belgium um for traveling mercies got
[58:12] many thoughts on my heart uh as we will
[58:14] be one of the speakers there in the
[58:17] Newport uh youth convention uh just want
[58:20] God to move in a supernatural Mighty way
[58:23] amongst the young people there
[58:25] they're coming from a multitude of
[58:27] countries all the way down I I think um
[58:31] Zimbabwe and what not all over Europe
[58:34] quite a few from the United States
[58:36] Canada uh whatnot just quite a quite a
[58:39] broad Gathering there and we just really
[58:42] want to see a supernatural move of God
[58:44] amongst the young people and uh you know
[58:47] the word shows us very clearly that
[58:49] Satan he focuses on the young people
[58:52] because he wants to counter the word and
[58:53] the word said train up a child amen and
[58:56] so Satan's going to train up children
[58:59] and our children are not his children so
[59:01] he has no right to try and train our
[59:02] children so we just want God to come and
[59:05] move in a supernatural way on these
[59:08] young people from all these different
[59:09] countries and uh that God would just
[59:12] speak and uh so we certainly coverage
[59:14] your prayers in this time therefore If
[59:17] any man be in Christ he is a new
[59:20] creature old things are passed away
[59:23] behold all things become new and all
[59:27] things are of God who hath reconciled us
[59:30] to himself by Jesus Christ and hath
[59:33] given to us the ministry of
[59:36] reconciliation to it that God was in
[59:38] Christ reconciling the world unto
[59:41] himself not imputing their trespasses
[59:44] unto them and hath committed unto us the
[59:47] word of
[59:49] reconciliation you know this can be
[59:51] taken out in a long path my brother and
[59:53] sister but the word of Recon ilation
[59:55] also connects to
[59:58] Pardon so God's pardoned
[1:00:01] us there is
[1:00:03] no sin to be held to our account we've
[1:00:08] been pardoned amen Can someone say thank
[1:00:11] you Lord hallelujah and we're not going
[1:00:14] to be amongst those as the story brother
[1:00:16] Brown tells about the young man who
[1:00:18] doesn't believe in the pardon rejects
[1:00:20] the pardon and then is shot by the
[1:00:23] firing squad and it goes to court and
[1:00:26] they rule a pardon is not a pardon
[1:00:29] unless it's received or accepted as a
[1:00:34] pardon I receive the pardon this morning
[1:00:37] Lord let it touch my life and all the
[1:00:40] power of your
[1:00:41] word now then we are ambassadors for
[1:00:46] Christ did I just read what I read yes
[1:00:49] sir amen we are now yes sir ambassadors
[1:00:53] right as though God did beseech You by
[1:00:57] us we pray you in Christ stead be ye
[1:01:00] reconciled to God for he hath made him
[1:01:03] to be sin for us who knew no sin that we
[1:01:07] might be made the righteousness of God
[1:01:10] in him Lord we thank you for the reading
[1:01:14] Lord we thank you for the word that we
[1:01:15] can read Lord a lifechanging word father
[1:01:18] and we receive it today in the name of
[1:01:20] Jesus Christ guide our words our
[1:01:23] thoughts our Deeds today we ask Lord in
[1:01:25] your name amen you may be seated
[1:01:31] Saints brother Isaac and I was just
[1:01:34] visiting the other day a little bit and
[1:01:36] you know you get busy in life and
[1:01:38] sometimes you don't realize uh really
[1:01:41] what's happening and he brought it to my
[1:01:44] attention my brother and sister it may
[1:01:47] only be by seconds but um the days are
[1:01:49] getting longer so we've had a change of
[1:01:52] seasons right here now when you wake up
[1:01:55] you know with all this Frost and the
[1:01:56] ground is frozen and whatever it's hard
[1:01:59] to say there's a change in season coming
[1:02:02] it it you don't recognize that so much
[1:02:05] but the changing of the season now a
[1:02:07] changing of a season is a period of time
[1:02:10] amen that is marked when there is a a a
[1:02:14] time of change that is coming and it can
[1:02:17] be defined or described as a division of
[1:02:20] time now when you look at this my
[1:02:22] brother and sister Webster says it's a
[1:02:24] period of time or a division of time and
[1:02:28] then it also describes that there's four
[1:02:30] marked Seasons now we could take that as
[1:02:33] spring summer fall winter Etc my brother
[1:02:36] and sister but I want to tell you
[1:02:38] there's four Mark seasons in the
[1:02:39] Believers there's uh these Seasons that
[1:02:42] God has come and our lives have been
[1:02:44] marked by divisions of time and I
[1:02:47] believe that you can sit back and go
[1:02:49] into your own life and look and and see
[1:02:52] these very divisions of time that is has
[1:02:54] brought you to where you are today and
[1:02:56] it is not by accident that God has typed
[1:02:59] the natural and the spiritual together
[1:03:02] but it was his way of expressing himself
[1:03:05] in nature that we could look out and see
[1:03:08] a confirmation that's already in our
[1:03:10] hearts by the revelation of the spirit
[1:03:12] of God in us and we can look out in
[1:03:14] nature and see this connection and
[1:03:17] realize just how fine-tuned all of
[1:03:20] creation is amen that there is a time
[1:03:23] that it is marked in sin there's a time
[1:03:25] that it's marked in Redemption there's a
[1:03:27] time in this Redemption period that
[1:03:29] brings restoration and then restoration
[1:03:32] brings a whole new creation and so it's
[1:03:35] there that we recognize by God's grace
[1:03:37] and mercy that we are uh uh uh changing
[1:03:41] in a season we are changing as it is and
[1:03:45] these uh times in our life that are
[1:03:47] marked by these divisions of time we
[1:03:49] could look at that today now my brother
[1:03:51] and sister we would never hold a child
[1:03:54] child a baby H uh we'll just start with
[1:03:57] a baby we'll never hold a baby to the
[1:04:00] accountability that we will hold someone
[1:04:02] else that is older and so babies are
[1:04:05] there completely dependent and uh uh we
[1:04:08] can laugh and we can avoid and whatever
[1:04:11] but my brother and sister when you see
[1:04:13] the cycle of life that we come from
[1:04:15] being completely dependent in the
[1:04:17] natural to completely dependent in the
[1:04:19] natural we'll realize we are facing the
[1:04:22] full cycle or full time of this seasons
[1:04:25] and so God takes us from a baby to a
[1:04:27] child and you know if if you're a
[1:04:30] grandparent it can be very uh
[1:04:32] entertaining uh maybe not so to the
[1:04:34] parents you know the antics of children
[1:04:37] but it is there that uh we should stop
[1:04:39] and enjoy the time because it is
[1:04:41] fleeting it goes quickly and there is a
[1:04:44] a innocence in children that they will
[1:04:47] speak things that we as adults would
[1:04:49] tend to avoid you know like your parents
[1:04:52] uh would come and and uh we we would
[1:04:55] change our conversation in the presence
[1:04:57] of our parents because their view of the
[1:05:00] conversation might not be the same as
[1:05:01] ours and children will come in our
[1:05:04] presence and they will say the things
[1:05:07] that we would not be so comfortable to
[1:05:10] say and you know nothing like sitting
[1:05:12] somewhere and uh in a restaurant
[1:05:14] actually is where this example comes
[1:05:16] from and uh you're sitting there and
[1:05:18] there's kind of an awkward silence at
[1:05:20] the table next to you and a little boy
[1:05:23] walks around the table to the end where
[1:05:25] his mom and Dad is sitting and looks up
[1:05:27] at them and it's like Mom and Dad honey
[1:05:30] honey just sit down no I I need to ask
[1:05:32] you a question what's your question why
[1:05:34] are you guys so mad at each
[1:05:38] other shut up kid and sit down now but
[1:05:42] you see the
[1:05:44] Innocents they don't see it like we see
[1:05:47] it so as we come you know Jesus said
[1:05:52] lest you be like a little child
[1:05:56] I don't know how are you guys got your
[1:05:58] armor on this
[1:06:02] morning you know we
[1:06:05] can put whatever
[1:06:08] title to things in our life that we want
[1:06:11] to put it in but the Holy Spirit comes
[1:06:14] and just tells it like it is like a
[1:06:16] child and we can justify ourselves but
[1:06:19] unless it's Justified under the blood of
[1:06:21] Jesus Christ it's not justified and we
[1:06:24] can hide our
[1:06:27] sugarcoat now I'm not speaking to you
[1:06:29] I'm speaking to people that attend a
[1:06:31] church in this city like
[1:06:33] you and we can sugarcoat all of these
[1:06:36] things any way that we please but until
[1:06:38] we can come with the innocence of a
[1:06:39] child and be able to look in the mirror
[1:06:43] at our own lives and look at one another
[1:06:45] in the in the innocence of this and
[1:06:49] would come to this division of of time
[1:06:52] and you say why do you use that example
[1:06:54] example Because by the time that child
[1:06:56] is 30 he's also
[1:06:59] covering he's also trying to sugarcoat
[1:07:02] it a different season a different time a
[1:07:04] different place we can say well children
[1:07:06] you don't understand but maybe in their
[1:07:08] innocence they understand more than we
[1:07:10] give them credit
[1:07:11] for and so this comes to a
[1:07:15] teen and you got to love teens because
[1:07:18] they're still holding a certain segment
[1:07:20] of Innocence but starting to figure out
[1:07:23] it's it's about the
[1:07:25] wording can I hear a young person say
[1:07:29] Amen it's all about the
[1:07:33] wording who took the cookie mom somebody
[1:07:37] took a
[1:07:38] cookie mom already knows
[1:07:41] that and usually it tells on you by your
[1:07:46] wording what are we listening to for
[1:07:49] music well I'm not listening to and you
[1:07:52] name off the whole list that tells on
[1:07:55] you otherwise you wouldn't know
[1:07:58] them so we see that the teen years are a
[1:08:02] transition from
[1:08:04] innocence into you might say early
[1:08:07] stages of
[1:08:12] iniquity reminds me of a story of a
[1:08:14] child once his parents told him you not
[1:08:17] put your hand in that cookie jar and he
[1:08:19] wanted a cookie so bad he's like how do
[1:08:22] I get a cookie without putting my hand
[1:08:23] hand in the cookie jar so he climbed up
[1:08:25] on the counter pushed the cookie jar off
[1:08:27] the counter it broke on the floor and he
[1:08:29] thought I'm doing exactly what my
[1:08:31] parents said I did not put my hand in
[1:08:34] the cookie
[1:08:36] jar almost
[1:08:38] sounds like a self-made
[1:08:43] justification are you following me this
[1:08:48] morning I was justified to do what I did
[1:08:52] early adulthood brings us into
[1:08:53] responsibility we talked about it in
[1:08:55] young adults a little bit this morning
[1:08:57] you know uh coming to a time I I I threw
[1:09:00] sister Rachel under the bus on that so I
[1:09:03] just want I say that so you guys will
[1:09:04] know that that I'm an equal opportunity
[1:09:07] abuser sister Rachel is just a visitor
[1:09:09] but we call her family so I I figured
[1:09:11] that's fair game but you know there's a
[1:09:13] time that we go from the innocence of
[1:09:15] our youth and suddenly you want to have
[1:09:17] a car you want to have some money to
[1:09:19] spend you want to do this you want to do
[1:09:20] that you know um Mom and Dad can you no
[1:09:24] get a job now the job might be just
[1:09:27] cleaning the house mowing the lawn it
[1:09:30] doesn't necessarily you have to be there
[1:09:31] but ultimately leads to a place that you
[1:09:34] have to go and deal with this and and
[1:09:36] I'm just going to be really blunt this
[1:09:37] morning our sister Gabriella you know
[1:09:40] entered into the work world she shared
[1:09:42] testimony and prayer requests here of
[1:09:44] working with people who are
[1:09:47] abusive that's things you have to go out
[1:09:49] in this world and deal with these things
[1:09:51] but yet God's got a training ground it's
[1:09:53] bringing us not just to to cause us to
[1:09:57] uh uh suffer under these things but it's
[1:10:00] a lesson that we realize that Satan is
[1:10:04] abusive he he is there and that's why
[1:10:06] the spirit of abuse should never come
[1:10:08] into a Pulpit by word or deed because we
[1:10:11] are not of the devil but we are of God
[1:10:14] and everything should be for the
[1:10:15] edification of the word of God in the
[1:10:17] lives of Sons and Daughters of God and
[1:10:20] we move in this time of early adulthood
[1:10:22] and it's still a Time of
[1:10:25] transition and late
[1:10:28] adulthood late adulthood is maybe you
[1:10:30] might say that the stage of life that
[1:10:32] brother Paul sister Jerry are in right
[1:10:34] now or Brother David uh brother Trevor
[1:10:36] sister Carrie whatever uh sister Sue we
[1:10:39] coming and and that is a years that you
[1:10:42] use wisdom and you can see that I
[1:10:44] learned a lesson back here at this time
[1:10:46] and God allowed me to see this and God's
[1:10:49] moved in this and and they can be very
[1:10:51] good years or they can be statistically
[1:10:55] speaking some of the worst years of
[1:10:57] people's lives because they ask young
[1:11:00] people finishing High School entering
[1:11:03] College what do you want your life to
[1:11:06] be and they share
[1:11:10] that and
[1:11:13] statistically only a small fraction will
[1:11:16] actually live out what they thought
[1:11:19] their life would
[1:11:21] be now you say where you going brother
[1:11:23] Paul I'm telling you right now my
[1:11:24] brother and sister God has allowed you
[1:11:27] to speak what your future will be and
[1:11:31] he's given you power by the word for
[1:11:33] that to come to pass we do not have to
[1:11:35] be Christians for 20 30 40 years and at
[1:11:38] the end of 20 30 40 Years be unhappy uh
[1:11:42] uh just feeling abandoned feeling like
[1:11:45] we've never accomplished but by the
[1:11:47] grace of God we can actually step into
[1:11:49] the vision step into the promise of God
[1:11:52] and we can declare I want to be an
[1:11:54] overcomer and we will be Overcomers I
[1:11:57] want to be the word made manifest and
[1:12:00] you can step into that and be the word
[1:12:02] made manifest or we can allow the flesh
[1:12:05] to control us and bring us to a place
[1:12:08] that I want this and I want that I want
[1:12:10] to live like the world I want to name
[1:12:12] the name of Christ but live here and
[1:12:15] there's where you'll be in 40
[1:12:19] years am I speaking too hard this
[1:12:22] morning
[1:12:26] you see my brother and sister these
[1:12:27] things of life I shared it with you last
[1:12:29] Wednesday we come to these points of
[1:12:31] life we should have this
[1:12:33] settled we should not be 50 60 70 year
[1:12:37] old people still wondering if we're the
[1:12:38] bride of Christ in fact I'd like to
[1:12:40] lower that standard if I might we
[1:12:42] shouldn't even hardly make it out of our
[1:12:44] teens without having this settled in our
[1:12:47] life I know who I am I'm a Son of
[1:12:51] God but the devil
[1:12:54] he likes us to Kick the Can you know the
[1:12:56] phrase Kick the Can just keep kicking
[1:12:57] the can I don't want to deal with it
[1:12:59] today I kick the can I'll deal with it
[1:13:01] tomorrow that's not a way to get ahead
[1:13:03] natural or
[1:13:06] spiritual
[1:13:09] amen so if we don't have it settled late
[1:13:12] adulthood can be just as Troublesome as
[1:13:15] teens looking to satisfi looking to find
[1:13:18] an answer looking to find peace my
[1:13:21] brother and sister I know I'm cutting
[1:13:23] through lot real quick here but I tell
[1:13:25] you by the time we get to that point in
[1:13:26] our life we better have this we should
[1:13:29] have this settled of who we are amen and
[1:13:33] wait there's only two positions on the
[1:13:35] playing
[1:13:36] field for God or against
[1:13:40] him it comes down that
[1:13:44] simple it's man called denomination that
[1:13:47] add all the
[1:13:49] subcategories to this a Prophet come in
[1:13:53] this sour and said strip all of that
[1:13:57] away you're either for God or you're
[1:14:00] against
[1:14:03] him no wonder denomination didn't like
[1:14:06] him he was telling them Believers tear
[1:14:10] off the
[1:14:12] tinsil I'm just going to say this you
[1:14:14] notice brother Paul didn't preach one
[1:14:15] sermon about Christmas
[1:14:19] trees that's your issue that's right not
[1:14:22] my issue
[1:14:26] so I guess I did preach about Christmas
[1:14:28] trees didn't
[1:14:30] I tear the tinsel
[1:14:33] off everything we add on to it to make
[1:14:36] it look better than it really
[1:14:38] is have you guys ever read sister
[1:14:41] Rebecca this is a deviation have you
[1:14:42] ever read sister Rebecca's account you
[1:14:44] know they were always people always
[1:14:45] asking sister Rebecca what about
[1:14:47] Christmas trees and so she wrote this
[1:14:50] little deal and it was the last
[1:14:51] Christmas that they were going to be uh
[1:14:54] before it was last Christmas before
[1:14:56] brother Brown's death and um you know um
[1:15:00] they weren't going to have a Christmas
[1:15:02] tree because they were traveling brother
[1:15:04] Brown did it for the children amen
[1:15:07] weren't going to have a Christmas tree
[1:15:08] sister Rebecca tells a story about how
[1:15:10] they come one day and brother brandham
[1:15:12] has got a Christmas tree only because
[1:15:14] there weren't any Christmas trees
[1:15:15] available and they were leaving uh he
[1:15:17] had bought this little aluminum thing
[1:15:19] with this little fake leaves on it
[1:15:22] sister Rebeca said it was the ugliest
[1:15:24] thing you've ever seen in your
[1:15:29] life I got to get off that
[1:15:35] subject CU I said I wouldn't preach
[1:15:37] about Christmas
[1:15:38] trees so we come into late
[1:15:41] adulthood and either it can be a life
[1:15:44] filled with I wished I wished I wished I
[1:15:48] should have I should I should have or it
[1:15:50] can be a time in the life to say Thank
[1:15:52] you Lord I've been able to serve you
[1:15:54] these years Lord and I'm anchored in the
[1:15:56] word and I know who I am and even if
[1:15:59] future like they say getting old is not
[1:16:01] for sissies and even I know that maybe
[1:16:04] in the future it might be difficult but
[1:16:06] you know what I know who I am and I know
[1:16:08] where I'm going I'm not laying in a
[1:16:11] hospital bed crying out as sister Jerry
[1:16:13] and I sister Jerry was with me dealing
[1:16:15] with a few years ago a man crying out
[1:16:18] when I die where am I
[1:16:21] going but we can settle that amen we can
[1:16:25] anchor that because you see whether we
[1:16:27] like it or not we're going to go through
[1:16:29] these change of the seasons Amen in the
[1:16:31] natural we're going to go through these
[1:16:32] change of the seasons and I think it
[1:16:34] would pay us to be
[1:16:36] gracious because if the Lord terries
[1:16:38] we're all coming that's it and then that
[1:16:41] we come to this final season it's called
[1:16:43] the
[1:16:43] elderly and my brother and sister you
[1:16:46] look at that and the elderly can be that
[1:16:48] in a
[1:16:49] sense we can be
[1:16:51] Elder I hope you you catch my little
[1:16:53] twist of words we can be elder or we can
[1:16:55] be elderly that's right I'll tell you to
[1:16:58] my dying breath if the Lord terries I
[1:17:00] want to be an elderen I want to be
[1:17:02] someone somebody can look to as we've
[1:17:05] looked for years to brother Bob and
[1:17:07] sister Joanne and look how God is held
[1:17:09] them my own mother look how God has held
[1:17:12] them and many in our life look how God
[1:17:14] has held them what would they be
[1:17:16] classified as Elder in the body the
[1:17:19] stabilizing factor I don't want to just
[1:17:21] go old I want to be a stabilizing factor
[1:17:26] in the house of God I want to be an
[1:17:28] example to Sons and Daughters of God our
[1:17:31] young people not just someone getting
[1:17:33] old in their presence but I want to give
[1:17:36] something back to them and a word that
[1:17:39] they can say and hold to their heart
[1:17:41] that God is faithful and true amen all
[1:17:44] the days of our
[1:17:46] lives and you know there's spiritual
[1:17:50] divisions we're born in sin
[1:17:54] only one ever Ste beyond that
[1:17:58] division we're born in
[1:18:01] sin then we have what we could term if
[1:18:03] you go down into the uh dictionary and
[1:18:05] follow it through then we have a
[1:18:10] Reconciliation and that reconciliation
[1:18:12] is repent be baptized and you shall be
[1:18:15] filled with the Holy Ghost there's our
[1:18:17] reconciliation right there it's not how
[1:18:19] much money you give to the church not
[1:18:21] your attendance I I don't say lightly I
[1:18:23] thought it was a incredible uh deal I I
[1:18:26] I caught a you know a little something
[1:18:28] here a few years ago and it was talking
[1:18:31] about how uh since she had been
[1:18:34] baptized uh that this lady this this is
[1:18:37] in the midwest at a church there in a
[1:18:39] small town this lady was like 88 89
[1:18:42] years old and they gave her an award she
[1:18:45] had never once missed a service since
[1:18:48] the day of her
[1:18:49] baptism I mean that's incredible can any
[1:18:52] of us
[1:18:53] even come
[1:18:56] close but it showed a picture of her and
[1:18:58] this is where the judgmental part comes
[1:19:00] in you might be in church every single
[1:19:03] service for 85 years or
[1:19:08] something doesn't mean that you're in
[1:19:11] Christ that's
[1:19:13] right you going be in church and not be
[1:19:15] in Christ that's
[1:19:21] right
[1:19:25] we have reconciliation what does it do
[1:19:27] it makes us a new creature in Christ I
[1:19:28] tell you I'm happy to be a new creature
[1:19:30] amen I want to even be a more new
[1:19:32] Creature if that Mak sense I want to I
[1:19:35] want to be so in Christ my brother and
[1:19:37] sister that this flesh is no longer part
[1:19:39] of this equation but the prophet told us
[1:19:41] this flesh would be with us
[1:19:43] always so don't get the idea that you're
[1:19:46] somehow tend into perfection in the
[1:19:48] flesh that's right but you can come to a
[1:19:51] place that there's no sin because God
[1:19:53] said I don't count any of this against
[1:19:55] you you have no sin you never did it in
[1:19:57] the first place can someone raise a hand
[1:19:59] and say thank you Lord that you would
[1:20:01] view me as though I never sinned I
[1:20:04] trouble in my own mind in my own Spirit
[1:20:07] of the things that I have said and done
[1:20:09] behaviors of the past but God said you
[1:20:12] never did it in the first place you can
[1:20:14] walk forward now truly as a new creature
[1:20:17] in Christ
[1:20:18] Jesus
[1:20:21] Lord and you can be the righteousness of
[1:20:23] God that's right that's quite a change
[1:20:27] isn't it sir but it's reflective of the
[1:20:30] seasons of our
[1:20:34] life now my brother and sister when you
[1:20:36] look at this going back up here into the
[1:20:40] scripture that we could
[1:20:43] see in verse 20 says now then we are
[1:20:46] ambassadors for Christ amen now an
[1:20:51] ambassador I think you'll like cuz we
[1:20:53] have ideas what ambassadors are you know
[1:20:55] our government sends ambassadors to this
[1:20:57] country and that country and and
[1:20:59] wherever but look at this in a spiritual
[1:21:01] context an ambassador is a
[1:21:04] campaigner amen I believe we're here
[1:21:07] today in a spiritual warfare we're
[1:21:10] campaigners we're winning my brother and
[1:21:13] sister the world to Christ all that can
[1:21:16] be one
[1:21:17] amen and you look at this you are an
[1:21:21] Envoy yes a
[1:21:24] representative symbolic serving as a
[1:21:27] symbol of the one you represent that's
[1:21:31] right so here we are as ambassadors for
[1:21:35] Christ we must look like the one we
[1:21:42] represent is this making sense to you
[1:21:45] today so you see we cannot look like we
[1:21:48] belong out there and say we're
[1:21:50] campaigning for Christ
[1:21:53] we must be
[1:21:54] representative we must be in the image
[1:21:57] of have the same thought word and deed
[1:22:00] as the one that we are campaigning for
[1:22:03] the same one that we are a symbol of I
[1:22:07] want to just ask you plain but straight
[1:22:09] today what are you a symbol of what does
[1:22:13] your outer man declare you are a symbol
[1:22:17] of would someone look at you on the
[1:22:19] street and say I see you're a Christian
[1:22:24] I know that's a little straight but
[1:22:26] that's right sorry I labored this
[1:22:28] morning as to how to preach this my
[1:22:30] brother and sister figured out that
[1:22:31] straight was just the best amen amen I
[1:22:34] want this man on the outside well the
[1:22:37] outside don't matter so much brother
[1:22:39] Paul that's right but the outside's
[1:22:40] reflective of the inside and are we a
[1:22:43] representative in the very image of the
[1:22:46] one we represent that's right I know
[1:22:49] that's straightforward but let it be
[1:22:50] straightforward it's preached in love
[1:22:52] that's right amen so it is I want to
[1:22:55] look amen I want to be a symbol of Amen
[1:22:59] that when the world looks at us they see
[1:23:03] Christ not religious people I watched a
[1:23:06] lovely documentary a few days ago
[1:23:08] thought it was very well
[1:23:10] done it was an interview of a man who
[1:23:12] had left the LDS
[1:23:15] church and while he clearly articulated
[1:23:19] all the things that he saw that was
[1:23:21] wrong
[1:23:23] he also articulated what was
[1:23:26] right Family Values good support blah
[1:23:30] blah blah all these things but he says
[1:23:33] what got me is when I started taking
[1:23:37] what they taught
[1:23:39] us and took it back to a reference point
[1:23:42] that's right and realized what I was
[1:23:44] taught did not even reflect early
[1:23:48] Mormonism that's
[1:23:51] right so they had
[1:23:54] morphed and we say here this morning
[1:23:58] wow
[1:24:02] yeah have we
[1:24:04] morphed let's be careful we don't morph
[1:24:08] just like they
[1:24:09] morphed let's be careful that the image
[1:24:12] we're presenting is the image that's in
[1:24:14] scripture that's right amen not the
[1:24:17] image that we think it should be that's
[1:24:20] right amen remember what the prophet
[1:24:22] said
[1:24:23] when you I'm just Loosely paraphrasing
[1:24:26] this when the mayor of the city starts
[1:24:27] attending your church watch
[1:24:30] out I don't think we have to worry about
[1:24:33] it I don't think the mayor will stay
[1:24:35] around very long if they do attend
[1:24:37] church my brother and sister but we're
[1:24:40] not here to be judgmental we're here to
[1:24:41] be the word amen and you know I'll get
[1:24:45] to this in just a second but the word is
[1:24:46] actually in reality not judgmental now
[1:24:50] judgment begins in the house of God but
[1:24:52] we have to look at this in the right
[1:24:54] perspective my brother and sister and
[1:24:56] look in 1 Thessalonians the 5th chapter:
[1:24:59] 1-9 but of the times and the seasons
[1:25:02] Brethren you have no need that I write
[1:25:04] unto you for yourselves know perfectly
[1:25:06] that the day of the Lord so cometh as a
[1:25:08] thief in the night for when they shall
[1:25:11] say peace and safety which is what is
[1:25:13] happening even right now we've seen it
[1:25:15] through the years but it's right now
[1:25:17] they're saying we got to stop this we
[1:25:19] got to stop that we need
[1:25:21] peace
[1:25:23] and In the Flesh we would all
[1:25:24] agree then sudden destruction cometh
[1:25:27] upon them as to Veil upon a woman with
[1:25:29] child they shall not Escape but ye
[1:25:31] Brethren are not in darkness can we say
[1:25:34] Amen to that that the day should
[1:25:36] overtake you as a thief right ye are all
[1:25:41] the children of light and the children
[1:25:43] of the day and we are not of the night
[1:25:47] nor of Darkness I love how this just
[1:25:49] breaks this down this is where this is
[1:25:52] at but this is where you are
[1:25:55] at right every day the light Rises
[1:26:00] Sunrise comes a few seconds earlier than
[1:26:03] it did yesterday I don't remember what
[1:26:05] was it a week ago or something the
[1:26:07] sols time started
[1:26:09] changing we're coming back into
[1:26:12] light now I get sidetracked here if I'm
[1:26:15] not careful but the prophet of God said
[1:26:17] that same cycle takes place in our
[1:26:20] life let me put it this way way we're on
[1:26:22] fire for God and we cool off a little
[1:26:26] bit we're on fire for God and we cool
[1:26:29] off a little bit when you cool off does
[1:26:32] that mean you're lost no sir no sir it's
[1:26:34] a season that's right something taking
[1:26:36] place in your life sometimes God uses
[1:26:39] Seasons amen you never appreciate spring
[1:26:42] until you've went through winter you
[1:26:45] never appreciate Florida till you've
[1:26:46] lived in
[1:26:51] Idaho
[1:26:53] that was brother Stan he's like you know
[1:26:55] brother Paul you you and sister Jerry
[1:26:57] could just come down here where it's
[1:26:58] warm you know how hard pierced me right
[1:27:01] in my heart it's like
[1:27:03] stand
[1:27:06] please but we're not of Darkness that
[1:27:09] the day should overtake you but your
[1:27:11] children of light Children of the day
[1:27:13] were not of the night nor of Darkness
[1:27:16] therefore let us not sleep as do others
[1:27:18] but let us watch and be sober for they
[1:27:21] that sleep sleep in the night and they
[1:27:23] that are drunken are drunken in the
[1:27:25] night but let us can we identify with
[1:27:28] that who are of the day be sober putting
[1:27:31] on the breastplate of faith and love and
[1:27:33] for a helmet the hope of salvation for
[1:27:36] God hath not appointed us to wrath but
[1:27:39] to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus
[1:27:42] Christ I love that scripture my brother
[1:27:44] and sister because it clearly gives us a
[1:27:47] warning that the devil is is out here
[1:27:50] he's outside you might say the gates of
[1:27:52] the the city and it's in the time of
[1:27:54] Darkness that usually those Spirits move
[1:27:57] but the light has come to us and we now
[1:28:00] recognize it doesn't make us immune but
[1:28:02] we now recognize the Ws of the enemy we
[1:28:05] recognize how Satan would come in a
[1:28:07] certain time just like you might have a
[1:28:09] great church service and the Devil comes
[1:28:11] right along behind that and wants to
[1:28:13] steal that away from you that was God's
[1:28:16] gift to you so the devil's trying to
[1:28:17] steal a gift from God to
[1:28:21] you I'm not going to give the devil I
[1:28:23] don't want to give the
[1:28:25] devil but sometimes my
[1:28:27] flesh how is that that brother jul do
[1:28:31] that wowy wowy
[1:28:35] woo woe unto me wowy wowy
[1:28:41] woo don't look at me with those blank
[1:28:44] faces come on we might even put that to
[1:28:50] music wowy wowy woo wowy wowy woo the
[1:28:56] devil got to me and he's going to get to
[1:29:00] you no no no no no no no no victory is
[1:29:04] mine victory is mine Victory today not
[1:29:10] kicking the can Victory next month is
[1:29:12] mine Victory next month is
[1:29:15] mine and we get to next month Victory
[1:29:18] next year is
[1:29:20] mine come on
[1:29:22] Victory Is
[1:29:23] Ours
[1:29:25] Hallelujah the word of God today is
[1:29:29] producing exactly what the word said it
[1:29:32] would very simplistic statement isn't
[1:29:36] it so where does The Fault lie if we're
[1:29:38] not seeing it produced is it in the word
[1:29:42] you'll find that many of these critics
[1:29:44] sorry to even bring a critic's name not
[1:29:46] name but the name critic many of these
[1:29:48] critics my brother and sister that are
[1:29:50] so harsh against the message
[1:29:53] you know what really you get get them to
[1:29:55] admit this you got to root for a long
[1:29:57] time they actually feel like the word of
[1:29:59] God failed
[1:30:01] them the message failed
[1:30:07] them but if the scripture says there's
[1:30:09] nothing new Under the Sun if it failed
[1:30:11] them then it's failed 6,000 years of
[1:30:18] Believers can you believe
[1:30:20] that I don't have enough Faith No that's
[1:30:23] right to believe that God's word has
[1:30:26] failed for 6,000
[1:30:31] years so the truth of it
[1:30:34] is they
[1:30:36] failed and they want to pass the blame
[1:30:39] to someone else I'll make a bold
[1:30:41] statement today and I hope it doesn't
[1:30:43] offend anybody but if you're feeling
[1:30:45] like today you can't live it you're
[1:30:46] listening to the wrong voice amen this
[1:30:49] word is an overcoming word this word is
[1:30:51] a powerful word this word has never
[1:30:54] failed and can never fail because you
[1:30:56] know what the minute this word fails the
[1:31:00] creative power that spoke Heaven into
[1:31:02] Earth into existence will have to fail
[1:31:04] with it and in a blink of an eye this
[1:31:07] world will go dark and throw itself
[1:31:09] right out of orbit and we go into total
[1:31:12] darkness because God can't stand
[1:31:14] faithful on one thing and fail at
[1:31:17] another he either is in control or he is
[1:31:22] not in control and I'm here today to say
[1:31:25] he's in control and I want to give him
[1:31:28] control of my life I don't want my wife
[1:31:31] going into darkness and spiraling out of
[1:31:34] control CU you see it wouldn't be God's
[1:31:36] fault it'll be our fault that's
[1:31:42] right you see we get to choose our image
[1:31:44] of
[1:31:47] representation well look at us today are
[1:31:50] you guys okay with Paul being Paul today
[1:31:53] look at us today we're going to pass a
[1:31:55] new ordinance in the church yall
[1:31:57] Brothers have to dress like
[1:32:00] me next Sunday they'll only be me
[1:32:04] here because you're not me
[1:32:08] right did you follow
[1:32:11] me the word let you be you while
[1:32:14] fulfilling the word
[1:32:17] amen come on my brother and sister amen
[1:32:20] let's face a simple reality the word let
[1:32:23] you be you so it's not about how the
[1:32:26] word deals with you it is how you deal
[1:32:30] with the word because God calls you you
[1:32:33] have to respond you have to say yes amen
[1:32:37] and if you don't say yes then you can't
[1:32:38] blame the word because the word
[1:32:41] called now let's look at this real quick
[1:32:44] I need to just keep moving along
[1:32:48] here let's just go right into let's go
[1:32:52] right into the hour has
[1:32:54] come amen now I want you to notice that
[1:32:57] it's the same holy spirit that was in
[1:32:59] the days of the Apostles are here or is
[1:33:02] here now present tense in this meeting
[1:33:05] working among the people now it behooves
[1:33:07] us to realize this that it wasn't your
[1:33:10] brother I brother Brown I'm talking
[1:33:11] about himself it wasn't me it is your
[1:33:14] lord Jesus who is here and we're all
[1:33:18] representative of his now we know that's
[1:33:22] the truth do you believe that's true now
[1:33:24] his holy spirit is here and he's just as
[1:33:27] willing and he can work through the
[1:33:29] people as the people will let him work
[1:33:32] do you believe that and I'm going to say
[1:33:34] amen I believe that now there was many
[1:33:37] things that Jesus himself could not do
[1:33:39] because of unbelief is that right many
[1:33:42] things he could not do we hate to think
[1:33:44] that they could not do it because of
[1:33:47] their unbelief so I use this quote my
[1:33:49] brother and sister toly articulate you
[1:33:52] that he is willing he's here this
[1:33:53] morning more than willing are we willing
[1:33:56] to respond are we willing to let the
[1:33:59] word make a change in us are we willing
[1:34:03] to recognize there's a change in the
[1:34:06] season of our lives but change from us
[1:34:09] maybe being able to say well I'm a
[1:34:11] message believer I think God sent a
[1:34:12] prophet to being a message believer that
[1:34:15] Jesus Christ has spoken to me
[1:34:18] personally CU if he hasn't spoken
[1:34:20] personally then you have secondhand
[1:34:22] religion that's right and I can't find
[1:34:25] anywhere where secondhand religion works
[1:34:27] like firsthand
[1:34:30] religion you see what this season
[1:34:34] is Revelations 19 this is a season of
[1:34:38] Lamb's wife making herself ready and
[1:34:41] there is a great multitude that is
[1:34:42] shouting
[1:34:44] hallelujah amen I tell you my brother
[1:34:46] and sister every victory that I see not
[1:34:48] cuz I'm a pastor but every Victory I see
[1:34:51] see take place in Great's Tabernacle my
[1:34:54] heart sings to the heavens I am so
[1:34:56] excited when I see little victories amen
[1:35:00] little things that come in our life we
[1:35:02] recognize the devil's no longer got a
[1:35:04] hold of that God's got a hold of it but
[1:35:07] I had to take my hands off of it for God
[1:35:09] to take a hold of it but instead we're
[1:35:12] too busy wrestling it from the hands of
[1:35:14] the devil it's not your job to wrestle
[1:35:16] it from the hands of the devil it's your
[1:35:17] job to take your hands off of it and let
[1:35:19] God take care of it and when we take our
[1:35:22] hands off of it and let God take care of
[1:35:23] it it's amazing what happens around us
[1:35:27] amazing I remember one time dealing with
[1:35:30] a
[1:35:31] family you
[1:35:33] know it was quite interesting sister had
[1:35:36] actually hadn't been to church for six
[1:35:39] or eight months
[1:35:41] Pastor I go to church service after
[1:35:48] service and God doesn't do anything
[1:35:57] I don't see God doing
[1:36:02] anything pretty stunning isn't
[1:36:08] it you believe God asked you to
[1:36:13] participate Here Comes Paul oblivious to
[1:36:17] everything
[1:36:20] studying got kind of a crazy
[1:36:21] off-the-wall type of a
[1:36:24] thought but I was like well Lord if I
[1:36:26] just can't get over this thought I can't
[1:36:27] I can't seem to move on I go to church
[1:36:31] her and her husband children are
[1:36:33] there and I was animated enough that
[1:36:36] probably you Saints here in Grace
[1:36:38] Tabernacle would be like Brother Paul's
[1:36:39] on
[1:36:41] speed I was flailing my arms and I was
[1:36:44] up and you know I mean Hallelujah you
[1:36:47] know I've done it before but I I I'm
[1:36:50] there and I just their church is way
[1:36:52] bigger than this and I end up in the
[1:36:53] very back of the church and and you know
[1:36:56] God is so Supernatural my brother and
[1:36:58] sister that he knows how to guide our
[1:37:00] footsteps and I end up stopping right
[1:37:02] behind a Pew and giving this crazy
[1:37:05] analogy if you want to see me you're
[1:37:08] going to have to look for me because if
[1:37:10] you're looking forward like you was a
[1:37:12] minute ago you won't see me amen but
[1:37:16] maybe sometimes you got to turn your
[1:37:18] neck you got to put some effort in
[1:37:20] looking for God you got to say God your
[1:37:23] word says you're here where are you
[1:37:27] where are
[1:37:29] you and I'm standing as it turns out
[1:37:32] right behind this sister that I know not
[1:37:34] what wi of what her issue or her
[1:37:36] struggle is and it's there that God
[1:37:39] comes down Holy Spirit speaks to her and
[1:37:42] said I've been expecting God to walk up
[1:37:44] in front of me and say I am God I am
[1:37:47] here but she had to put the effort in to
[1:37:50] say Lord your word said your word said
[1:37:53] your word said that you're here and I'm
[1:37:56] going to find you inside this building
[1:37:59] today because you said you would be here
[1:38:03] amen or we can cross our arms and say I
[1:38:06] look in the mountains and I look in the
[1:38:09] seas and I look in the lakes and the
[1:38:11] rivers and I looked here and I looked
[1:38:12] there and I didn't see
[1:38:14] God what was you looking
[1:38:18] for I tell you what I'm looking for the
[1:38:21] promise amen his promise has to be
[1:38:24] faithful it has to be true or we have
[1:38:29] nothing in fact you won't have light
[1:38:32] Earth matter trees water fish you'll
[1:38:35] have nothing if God's word isn't true
[1:38:38] that's it it'll all be gone amen because
[1:38:42] you
[1:38:43] see the minute you puncture the vacuum
[1:38:48] it
[1:38:50] collapses
[1:38:52] but if
[1:38:53] everything is built from
[1:38:57] Christ you
[1:38:59] can't puncture it that's right no amount
[1:39:03] of unbelief no amount of fear anxieties
[1:39:07] doubts no matter what the devil might
[1:39:09] offer you can't puncture that so it's
[1:39:11] going to come down to it's up to you
[1:39:13] that's right it's up to you whether
[1:39:15] you're going to let the word of God be
[1:39:16] manifest and I say Lord manifest your
[1:39:18] word in me let me be a representative
[1:39:21] today Lord that people might actually
[1:39:23] say I think that man is
[1:39:27] different we could get into some
[1:39:29] senseless nonsense of examples it's not
[1:39:33] actually senseless it's true but we
[1:39:36] don't need to make the
[1:39:38] point this is a season of the Lamb's
[1:39:42] wife amen this is a season to be
[1:39:47] [Music]
[1:39:50] certain
[1:39:57] now okay let me finish that quote I got
[1:40:00] sidetracked is that okay to get
[1:40:02] sidetracked
[1:40:04] sometimes there's many things Jesus
[1:40:06] himself couldn't do because of unbelief
[1:40:08] people have a hard time believing that
[1:40:09] but it's the truth now look at this now
[1:40:12] the right mental attitude we know this
[1:40:14] quote amen all you along here do you
[1:40:18] understand what I mean when I say the
[1:40:19] right mental attitude that's your right
[1:40:23] mental attitude toward God's Divine
[1:40:25] promise will bring any promise to pass
[1:40:29] oh let me finish a story somebody the
[1:40:31] other day mentioned said brother Paul
[1:40:32] never finishes his stories they didn't
[1:40:34] tell it to me they told someone else who
[1:40:36] told it to
[1:40:38] me that sister sitting in the service
[1:40:40] that day right
[1:40:42] there light bulb turns
[1:40:45] on you kind of feel bad when you're
[1:40:47] preaching I don't know brother Chris
[1:40:49] Brother David do you ever feel bad when
[1:40:51] you're preaching and somebody bursts
[1:40:52] into tears starts sobbing I don't know
[1:40:54] it kind of bothers me I'm like did I say
[1:40:56] something
[1:40:58] wrong but this sister sitting right
[1:41:01] there starts crying puts her head down
[1:41:04] and I'm like okay maybe I'll move over
[1:41:07] to this side of the
[1:41:10] aisle broke a
[1:41:13] spirit right there she went to her
[1:41:16] husband to her children repented went
[1:41:18] well went to God first repented went to
[1:41:20] husband children repented went to the
[1:41:21] pastor repented and that evening they
[1:41:23] invited us to a house sister Jerry's
[1:41:25] there and they invited that and the
[1:41:27] sister pours out and my brother and
[1:41:29] sister you would look today I hope you
[1:41:30] don't feel offended to this you would
[1:41:32] look today at the things that caused her
[1:41:34] to start doing what she was doing and
[1:41:36] thinking like she was thinking and you'd
[1:41:38] say
[1:41:39] what
[1:41:42] what that got you out of the house of
[1:41:44] God that got you where you would Harley
[1:41:46] Harley wouldn't take care of your
[1:41:47] husband and your CH what
[1:41:51] but when we face it ourself it's this
[1:41:54] huge
[1:41:56] mountain it's a mohill in everybody
[1:41:58] else's life but it's a mountain in ours
[1:42:01] God came in there broke that spirit amen
[1:42:04] I'll tell you what I sat there as
[1:42:06] they're sharing their story I'm just
[1:42:07] like oh
[1:42:10] wow I said that you said in the service
[1:42:13] brother Paul da da da da I said
[1:42:17] that okay you see it's not man speaking
[1:42:21] it's God speaking let's let God speak
[1:42:24] this morning Saints let him deal with
[1:42:26] your heart be tender and let God deal
[1:42:29] with you don't think about the crazy old
[1:42:31] guy up front that's speaking it's God
[1:42:33] speaking to you it's the word coming
[1:42:36] forth it's life
[1:42:38] changing it's changing with the seasons
[1:42:41] of Our
[1:42:43] Lives now we look at this and he says
[1:42:46] the right mental attitude that's your
[1:42:48] right mental attitude towards God's
[1:42:49] Divine promise will bring in any promise
[1:42:51] to pass maybe you don't believe that you
[1:42:53] say well my faith is weak I wouldn't
[1:42:55] confess it see don't let the devil know
[1:42:58] that always say I got good faith I mean
[1:43:01] I would almost want to ask you I will
[1:43:03] ask you could you lift a hand and say
[1:43:05] I've got good faith amen I might be
[1:43:07] struggling in my life but I'm going to
[1:43:09] say I believe God I believe he's
[1:43:13] real that's right don't testify nothing
[1:43:17] of the devil that's
[1:43:19] right
[1:43:21] you know I'll tell you I got to be
[1:43:22] careful here I've caused some of our
[1:43:26] little kids to sing some things that got
[1:43:28] them in trouble with their parents and
[1:43:29] the parents got me in trouble but I'm
[1:43:32] telling you my brother and sister look
[1:43:33] how easy it is that the devil Works he
[1:43:36] comes and anoints the music that anoints
[1:43:39] the spirit and the spirit has people
[1:43:43] confessing they're lost they're Wicked
[1:43:46] they're full of
[1:43:48] whatever and they don't even real
[1:43:50] driving down the road you know I felt
[1:43:54] like a real fool with my Corvette thing
[1:43:56] the other day so I'm going to resist the
[1:43:58] example but I'm telling you you'll see
[1:44:00] it they're driving down the
[1:44:02] road barely look over the car door which
[1:44:05] means they have sawed the bottom of
[1:44:06] their car seat
[1:44:13] off and I won't even repeat the words
[1:44:16] are coming out of the car because
[1:44:18] they're so filthy and so
[1:44:27] vile and they're right there singing
[1:44:33] along and if we're not
[1:44:36] careful we'll be let's see it can't be a
[1:44:39] man's store it needs to be a women's
[1:44:42] store we'll be in
[1:44:46] Macy's no that's not fair is it does
[1:44:49] Macy's have a hardware
[1:44:52] section not that I remember
[1:44:56] anyway and that same music without words
[1:45:00] but music will be coming through the
[1:45:07] speaker well it didn't have any words it
[1:45:09] had you know I felt myself huh they
[1:45:11] don't need words it's got its own
[1:45:14] language amen the devil's got his own
[1:45:17] language and he speaks it fluently and
[1:45:20] he's got people speaking it for him
[1:45:23] that's my
[1:45:24] point people speak it for him
[1:45:30] right well if they anointed of Darkness
[1:45:33] can speak it how can we as Sons and
[1:45:36] Daughters of God be speaking that
[1:45:38] language we can't speak his language I
[1:45:41] can't understand his language I know
[1:45:44] nothing of his language what I know is
[1:45:47] the word of God and the spirit of God
[1:45:50] and the power of the word coming forth
[1:45:52] let that be what our lips are amen not
[1:45:55] to say my faith is weak whether you feel
[1:45:57] like you're defeated or not I have faith
[1:46:00] amen amen that's right amen take him at
[1:46:04] his word then it's all over see I like
[1:46:07] this I spoke this one time and a brother
[1:46:09] kind of got upset with me because he
[1:46:11] felt like I was blaming God for
[1:46:12] something but look what the prophet of
[1:46:14] God says here let me go back far enough
[1:46:16] and when you accept him as your healer
[1:46:18] don't never act like you're sick or
[1:46:20] crippled anymore believe that you're
[1:46:22] healed take him at his word then it's
[1:46:26] all over on God then and not on you amen

[1:46:32] healing have faith for your healing

[1:47:12] in God let that change your life
[1:47:16] Hallelujah excuse me from getting
[1:47:17] excited but when you bottle this up over
[1:47:19] time my brother and sisters just got to
[1:47:21] get out amen then the word as
[1:47:27] long that's over on God then and not on
[1:47:29] you see you as long as you take God at
[1:47:32] his word then the word will produce what
[1:47:34] it promised to do amen is that right now
[1:47:36] have faith believe him all your heart
[1:47:39] you see we don't just throw Faith
[1:47:41] out but your faith my brother and sister
[1:47:44] must have something activated amen Amen
[1:47:47] brother Chris and I here and there we
[1:47:48] keep bouncing across this little sub
[1:47:50] line
[1:47:52] Catalyst what is a catalyst for
[1:47:55] healing prophet of God last Wednesday we
[1:47:58] read the quote he said you just believe
[1:48:01] trust he'll lead
[1:48:03] you imagine what's the word lead
[1:48:06] mean
[1:48:08] amen what's the word
[1:48:10] mean not us bouncing into this bouncing
[1:48:13] into that but it would be he takes us by
[1:48:18] the hand figurative
[1:48:20] and says here here's your healing here's
[1:48:24] your deliverance here's Victory amen
[1:48:27] come over here right and he starts
[1:48:30] guiding us that's
[1:48:33] right and he comes around this
[1:48:36] Pitfall and takes us around this
[1:48:39] Pitfall and he leads us into Deliverance
[1:48:44] into Victory amen into the revelation of
[1:48:48] the word
[1:48:51] not what I've done but what he has done
[1:48:53] for me let me hurry along time is so
[1:48:57] fleeting amen somebody sitting right
[1:48:59] where you're at just pray Lord help
[1:49:01] brother Paul amen Believers position in
[1:49:04] Christ we'll just bounce through this
[1:49:06] one real quick so brother Brown's
[1:49:08] talking there you can read it as I talk
[1:49:10] amen Moses lost all his hope amen kind
[1:49:13] of lost all his power he kind of come to
[1:49:16] the place you know what uh sitting there
[1:49:18] uh I guess freedom is n for the children
[1:49:21] of Israel but there was something in his
[1:49:22] heart he just couldn't get around that
[1:49:23] right and so he lost the thought of
[1:49:26] Freedom till God meets him one day right
[1:49:29] isn't it amazing God's ways are so much
[1:49:32] different than our ways if we were
[1:49:34] planning the Deliverance of Israel we
[1:49:36] would have been secretly building swords
[1:49:39] and Spears and shields in our houses a
[1:49:42] little secret underground industry as it
[1:49:44] would be and we're going to you know
[1:49:46] know right where all the horses and all
[1:49:48] the Chariots are and we're going to know
[1:49:50] how to block the streets off to keep
[1:49:52] them from doing yeah but that's not
[1:49:54] God's way right that's not God's way
[1:49:57] Moses had to have a change of
[1:50:00] thinking amen he had to have a change of
[1:50:03] approach and God lets Moses come on
[1:50:06] we're always like well God's perfect
[1:50:08] will God's permissible will my brother
[1:50:10] and sister God let Moses go out and kill
[1:50:13] one of them men because he was going to
[1:50:15] prove to Moses that won't work amen and
[1:50:20] we talk about I hope I'm not too
[1:50:23] outlined here we talk
[1:50:25] about we have to kill this
[1:50:30] flesh we've got to die
[1:50:34] out you know I use this
[1:50:37] irreverent example the other
[1:50:40] day most of us if truth of reality hit
[1:50:43] us and God placed us right where our
[1:50:46] understanding was would find out we were
[1:50:47] in some Buddhist Monastery somewhere
[1:50:50] because if I can just punish myself
[1:50:52] enough if I can just beat myself down
[1:50:54] far enough if I can just do this and I
[1:50:57] can just do that I I'll just pray I'll
[1:50:59] just do this I'll prayer we should be
[1:51:01] praying but I'm telling you if you think
[1:51:03] you got to pray till you can't you know
[1:51:05] your legs are numb and your brain is
[1:51:07] numb and your elbows are numb and that's
[1:51:10] going to make a difference you're a
[1:51:11] Buddhist
[1:51:15] monk but the prophet shows
[1:51:17] us that when we come to that place to be
[1:51:20] in God's perfect will is when we can
[1:51:23] literally completely absolutely trust
[1:51:28] him
[1:51:29] amen and when you trust him if he leads
[1:51:32] you to pray till your legs are
[1:51:34] numb that's what you do that's right if
[1:51:37] he leads you over here literally through
[1:51:40] busy life be driving down the
[1:51:44] freeway and pray
[1:51:48] unceasingly you know that's that's with
[1:51:50] both eyes
[1:51:51] open I don't recommend you pray with
[1:51:54] your eyes closed on the
[1:51:58] freeway you see there's a lot of aspects
[1:52:00] we look at it in such a
[1:52:03] way but you can say well I prayed all
[1:52:06] day long as I was driving you still need
[1:52:08] to stop in 100% complete focus and say
[1:52:12] Lord I'm here before you humbling myself
[1:52:17] to
[1:52:18] you you see seems like a paradox doesn't
[1:52:22] it pray without
[1:52:24] ceasing
[1:52:26] well I got to do this I can't pray while
[1:52:29] I'm on the
[1:52:30] job yes you
[1:52:32] can yes you
[1:52:35] can but mostly you need to pray through
[1:52:37] till you can completely trust
[1:52:40] God lord we're here tell me right tell
[1:52:44] me left tell me stop tell me go tell me
[1:52:47] to make a phone
[1:52:48] call
[1:52:51] tell
[1:52:53] me sometimes the Simplicity of God
[1:52:56] speaking to us is the friction that's
[1:52:59] between
[1:53:00] us is you taking
[1:53:04] accountability for the friction that's
[1:53:06] between you and someone else amen and
[1:53:09] say Lord forgive me for the issue I have
[1:53:13] with them amen and you start
[1:53:17] praying amen I won't go into I probably
[1:53:20] shouldn't even bring it up but brother
[1:53:21] Isaac and I was talking about a little
[1:53:22] something here the other day and we both
[1:53:24] stopped in this little situation and
[1:53:26] said what we need to do is pray together
[1:53:28] and agree together about this situation
[1:53:31] changing brother Isaac would be a
[1:53:33] witness if you needed to look back there
[1:53:34] I'm sure he would lift his hand my
[1:53:36] brother and sister we saw within days
[1:53:38] that situation absolutely
[1:53:41] changed not because you go and tell
[1:53:43] someone they're wrong and tell someone
[1:53:45] they're right but you take that Before
[1:53:47] the Throne of almighty God and say Lord
[1:53:50] we submit this to you and whatever
[1:53:53] result it is Lord we trust you
[1:53:56] amen
[1:53:59] hallelujah amen see Moses forgot about
[1:54:03] Freedom he forgot God's promise that
[1:54:06] he'd free them God hadn't forgot his
[1:54:08] promise that's usually about the way it
[1:54:09] is my brother and sister we we have
[1:54:11] forgotten but God has not and he says
[1:54:15] Moses tried in himself and failed and
[1:54:17] that's what the church has done many
[1:54:19] times we tried in ourselves to do things
[1:54:22] and we failed to find God's element of
[1:54:24] time it um God's got a time for all
[1:54:27] things he's got a time that he has we
[1:54:31] plant corn maybe this is why this quote
[1:54:33] just struck me so much we plant corn uh
[1:54:35] we got a time we plow corn then at the
[1:54:39] time we harvest corn and the spring
[1:54:41] rains come and the drought through the
[1:54:42] summer Then Fall rains and the Snows you
[1:54:45] can't just say I plant my wheat today
[1:54:47] and tomorrow go out and harvest it and I
[1:54:50] think sometimes when we talk about
[1:54:51] having faith we think because we got
[1:54:53] down and said Lord I believe you're
[1:54:55] going to do this I believe you're going
[1:54:57] to do that we get up expecting to happen
[1:54:59] tomorrow and it may God very well can
[1:55:02] come on the scene can you say Amen to
[1:55:03] that we've seen God do that answer
[1:55:05] prayer right now but what if God wants
[1:55:08] you to wait through the cold of the
[1:55:12] winter and in the springtime when it
[1:55:15] starts to warm up you only see a sprig
[1:55:17] or two of green in the field and your
[1:55:20] heart starts to say oh my I think we
[1:55:22] have crop failure where's your faith
[1:55:27] then but in
[1:55:29] August as the combine rolls through the
[1:55:32] field and see the golden wheat pouring
[1:55:35] out of the combine into the
[1:55:38] truck you're reminded every seed brings
[1:55:42] forth of its own kind and we're not the
[1:55:45] seed of drought no we are not the seed
[1:55:49] of the scorching summer heat of Leo deia
[1:55:53] we are the seed of Jesus Christ
[1:55:56] hallelujah amen oh let me just go on let
[1:56:00] me bounce over this saint you you can
[1:56:02] look back if you want the quotes
[1:56:06] there this is something I really want to
[1:56:08] touch
[1:56:09] on see we can look at the
[1:56:12] word now I wouldn't ask for a hand or
[1:56:15] anything but we can look at the word now
[1:56:18] the scripture tells us that judgement
[1:56:19] begins in the house of God and we say
[1:56:21] Amen to that but we can look at the word
[1:56:25] as though it's judgment to
[1:56:31] you we look at
[1:56:33] that we look at the word as though it's
[1:56:35] judgment to us but do give me a moment
[1:56:39] if you would and we'll bounce back
[1:56:42] up into this
[1:56:44] quote and come and maybe give you a
[1:56:48] slightly different point of view amen
[1:56:52] you see we go in this
[1:56:57] and God has times Seasons times the
[1:57:00] presence of the Lord wasn't there to
[1:57:02] heal the sick okay let's go back up a
[1:57:04] little
[1:57:05] farther and the presence of the Lord was
[1:57:07] there to heal the sick and that's when
[1:57:09] Jesus was ministering to and in the
[1:57:11] presence of the Lord there was to heal
[1:57:13] the sick maybe at other times the
[1:57:15] presence of the Lord wasn't there right
[1:57:18] to heal the sick
[1:57:21] will you still have faith if he passes
[1:57:23] You by that's
[1:57:25] right think of the example at the pool
[1:57:28] of Bethesda how many Jesus walked by
[1:57:32] that's right I heard it preached one
[1:57:34] time see they were all the unbelievers I
[1:57:37] don't believe
[1:57:38] that they were not the all unbelievers
[1:57:41] my brother and sister or else every time
[1:57:43] a healing took place in this assembly or
[1:57:45] anywhere in the body of Believers we'd
[1:57:47] have to say oh there must be something
[1:57:49] wrong wrong with us but that's not the
[1:57:52] way God operates amen so the presence of
[1:57:55] the Lord wasn't there to heal the sick
[1:57:57] and we find out that God works
[1:57:58] everything seasonally and now in Moses
[1:58:00] when he failed to find was a time limit
[1:58:03] of God that when God revealed himself to
[1:58:05] him in the burning bush he found out
[1:58:07] then that the very thing that was in The
[1:58:08] Burning Bush was the thing that he
[1:58:13] lacked amen that's right now let me go
[1:58:15] into my thought my brother and sister
[1:58:16] you can toss it out if you want but I
[1:58:18] tell you my brother and sisters
[1:58:20] sometimes we look at this and we're
[1:58:22] thinking oh oh the word is so hard the
[1:58:28] word is so hard the the pastor was
[1:58:30] looking at me the preacher the minister
[1:58:33] brother Chris Brother David was looking
[1:58:34] at me when they said that statement
[1:58:36] that's just so harsh well maybe it's
[1:58:38] just a burning bush not bringing
[1:58:41] judgment to you right bringing what's
[1:58:44] lacking that's right amen that's right
[1:58:48] sir go ahead find a bicycle eat The
[1:58:49] Petal off of
[1:58:51] it come
[1:58:54] on probably not too many of us here need
[1:58:56] sulfur like that but if you looked out
[1:58:59] my who can I pick on I'll pick on my own
[1:59:01] grandchildren amen Ali and Ellie you
[1:59:04] guys are brother Paul Leah and Ellie are
[1:59:06] in the back parking lot of the church
[1:59:08] chewing the pedal off the
[1:59:13] bicycle what are they like
[1:59:17] him young people people forgive me but
[1:59:20] I'm going to speak it this
[1:59:21] straight you're out here dabbling in the
[1:59:24] things of the world that's
[1:59:26] it is that your bicycle
[1:59:30] pedal you're trying to find what's
[1:59:33] lacking in your
[1:59:35] life you know I feel totally qualified
[1:59:37] to preach about this because I chewed
[1:59:39] the pedal off of a few bicycles in my
[1:59:43] days this will satisfy that'll satisfy
[1:59:46] this will that will
[1:59:49] but then one day it's sad to say I had
[1:59:52] to be in my 30s to figure this out and I
[1:59:54] trust you young people don't wait till
[1:59:56] you're in your 30s to figure this out
[1:59:58] one day I figured out the very thing
[2:00:00] that I lacked I needed so desperately
[2:00:04] had been right in front of me the whole
[2:00:05] time I went out here and I had this and
[2:00:08] I went over here and I had that and I
[2:00:10] don't want to get into that we don't
[2:00:11] want to glorify those things but I'll
[2:00:13] just put it this way I chewed the pedal
[2:00:14] off of a lot of bicycles and not one
[2:00:16] drop of that changed my life right but
[2:00:19] one day yes sir I recognized what I was
[2:00:22] really
[2:00:23] lacking was a relationship with Jesus
[2:00:26] Christ that was the only thing that was
[2:00:28] going to make me happy amen amen I got
[2:00:31] worldly friends and I'm I'm just cruel
[2:00:33] to them I just am literally cruel to
[2:00:35] them some of you might be appalled at
[2:00:37] how cruel I am to
[2:00:38] them because I just asked them they
[2:00:40] would like make some comment wow we had
[2:00:42] a wild weekend right and I'm like
[2:00:44] really so did that case of Bud Light
[2:00:47] that you drank yeah fixed your marriage
[2:00:51] got your kids straightened out no your
[2:00:53] kids are acting like you your wife acts
[2:00:55] like you and that that pains me because
[2:00:57] sister Jerry's probably inwardly saying
[2:00:59] amen right now but it's there my brother
[2:01:02] and sister you see we're tossing the
[2:01:04] blame somewhere else it's time for you
[2:01:07] to receive what's lacking in your life
[2:01:11] you're not going to find it in Leo deia
[2:01:13] no sir I need to close sister Ruth if
[2:01:15] you'll just come to the piano it'll
[2:01:16] cause me to close and amen see we look
[2:01:21] at the word as though it's judgment to
[2:01:22] us but in reality it's just bringing us
[2:01:24] what we La am and so while we close up
[2:01:27] over judgment can you say
[2:01:30] Amen you know I if we if somebody comes
[2:01:33] and judges us you know I don't know
[2:01:35] Sister Carrie and sister Sue are fair
[2:01:36] game here they're both wearing black
[2:01:38] leather boots and you know I don't like
[2:01:40] black leather boots and I find a way to
[2:01:42] condemn black leather boots and and
[2:01:48] um
[2:01:51] sister Sarah's shaking her head like
[2:01:54] that's nonsense brother
[2:01:56] Paul that's right it's
[2:02:00] nonsense maybe we were talking about
[2:02:02] black leather boots with 6inch
[2:02:04] heels but we just choose black leather
[2:02:08] boots we just choose this random we
[2:02:11] choose that random and people are like
[2:02:14] wait I he's judging me isn't that the
[2:02:17] favorite Mantra of the world today don't
[2:02:20] judge me well you get to judge you or
[2:02:23] God will judge you why don't we
[2:02:26] sometimes realize that God's word coming
[2:02:28] to us is not judgment it's actually
[2:02:31] trying to fill a void of what we lack in
[2:02:35] our
[2:02:37] life now sound harsh the shoe fits where
[2:02:41] it if you're going to the movies you're
[2:02:44] drinking you're dancing you're doing
[2:02:46] this you're doing that acting
[2:02:48] misbehaving blah blah blah if you do
[2:02:51] just wear it own
[2:02:53] it but it's not me judging you and it's
[2:02:57] not even really God judging you because
[2:02:59] there's going to be a judgment
[2:03:01] later God's showing you this is what's
[2:03:05] lacking that's right this is what's
[2:03:09] lacking you guys ought to
[2:03:14] see pray for me some health
[2:03:17] issues
[2:03:20] when it's all done the doctor says well
[2:03:21] your body's lacking this your body's
[2:03:23] lacking that the body's lacking this the
[2:03:25] body's lacking that you need to take
[2:03:27] this you need to take that and I leaped
[2:03:29] over the desk I grabbed the doctor by
[2:03:31] the front of his shirt and I start
[2:03:32] shaking him and telling me you're a
[2:03:37] liar you don't believe me do
[2:03:39] you no sir we stop and say how do I fix
[2:03:45] it how do I fix
[2:03:47] it read read your Bible that's it pray
[2:03:51] amen get in the word amen eat the book
[2:03:54] that's right everything you need is in
[2:03:56] the book start eating the
[2:03:59] book and as you eat the book suddenly
[2:04:01] you start to feel a little bit better
[2:04:03] and suddenly things around you all
[2:04:07] change it's a new
[2:04:09] season Saints were're called to a season
[2:04:12] amen amen a season of a bride's Revival
[2:04:16] of a bride being able to stand up and
[2:04:18] say praise God the word is true I'm
[2:04:21] changing it's changing me amen I'm a new
[2:04:25] creature in Christ Jesus hallelujah oh
[2:04:29] my I've got so much more here then I'll
[2:04:32] just let go amen but just's remember
[2:04:35] please everyone listen to me on this
[2:04:37] last words the word always comes in due
[2:04:41] season
[2:04:43] right now almost sounds arrogant
[2:04:45] somebody might say well that's just
[2:04:46] arrogant Paul but I'm here to tell
[2:04:48] everyone that's listening this morning
[2:04:50] that the reason you are here this
[2:04:51] morning is cuz God wanted you to hear
[2:04:54] amen this morning amen amen that's the
[2:04:57] truth amen
[2:04:59] hallelujah man after preaching like that
[2:05:01] and being so rude I just don't even know
[2:05:03] what to say Amen but let me close this
[2:05:06] with this prophet's words spoke over
[2:05:08] many many
[2:05:09] times there is nothing left but the
