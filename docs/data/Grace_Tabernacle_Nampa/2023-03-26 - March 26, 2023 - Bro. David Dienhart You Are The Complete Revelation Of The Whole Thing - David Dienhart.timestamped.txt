[30:52] speak to you personally and individually
[30:54] this morning
[30:55] only a few hands
[30:57] [Music]
[31:01] I say we all ought to have our hands up
[31:03] if he speaks to me I'd want to answer
[31:05] wouldn't you wouldn't you want to move
[31:08] you know what the prophet said we ought
[31:10] to move on the spirit of the moment when
[31:11] he speaks
[31:13] it's time to move
[31:16] not become dilatory
[31:19] amen
[31:21] I don't mean to come out so strong but
[31:23] that's true where have we come to in
[31:26] this Sovereign what's this message come
[31:28] to do you not know that the message is
[31:30] set for you're going home
[31:32] do you know the only way you're going to
[31:34] make it home in a Rapture is this
[31:35] message becomes a revelation to your
[31:37] heart
[31:37] [Music]
[31:40] that's how important it is we ought to
[31:43] be feeding on the book then I think God
[31:45] is saying to us this morning consider
[31:47] your ways
[31:51] consider your ways
[31:53] we can't play with this anymore here
[31:56] realized today could be the day of the
[31:58] resurrection and you're left behind what
[32:00] about that
[32:01] [Music]
[32:03] do you know that he's already began his
[32:05] coming
[32:07] and you know it's going to be
[32:08] consummated in a meeting in the air
[32:12] where are we standing today
[32:16] I say again this message was sent for
[32:18] your going home
[32:20] we ought to be feeding on this open book
[32:23] because it if you're really seeking him
[32:26] if you have a desire for him then I say
[32:28] give yourself to that desire because
[32:30] he's given you a filter to draw through
[32:33] and you're going to draw through that
[32:35] field or life to Quicken that seed on
[32:36] the inside of you to manifest Jesus
[32:38] Christ
[32:40] and that's what you're here for bride
[32:42] you're here to manifest Jesus Christ in
[32:44] this hour
[32:46] that we ought to consider our ways
[32:48] what's hindering you
[32:50] what's stopping you from taking your
[32:52] full position
[32:57] coming to where you belong in this hour
[32:59] and this time what fear is there that
[33:01] would keep you
[33:04] from just drawing nigh to him not moving
[33:06] away from but drawing nigh to him he
[33:08] said he would draw an eye to you
[33:11] do you realize that he is the message of
[33:14] the hour
[33:16] foreign
[33:18] I would think that's very obvious he's
[33:19] already unveiled himself showing you and
[33:21] Vindicated himself perfectly that it's
[33:23] the son of man himself being revealed in
[33:25] this hour
[33:28] what an hour we're in
[33:31] but you know what there is a bride that
[33:33] has an ear to hear
[33:35] and she will respond to this word she
[33:38] will answer she will quickly answer and
[33:41] respond
[33:43] why because she loves him and why
[33:45] because he first loved her
[33:48] amen I don't mean to come on so strong
[33:51] but I think it I just feel very moved
[33:53] this morning
[33:54] [Music]
[33:57] when we asked the question and he asks a
[33:59] question how many would move if he spoke
[34:01] to you this morning
[34:02] and would answer and do it and move
[34:04] quickly
[34:06] think of it brother sister where are we
[34:09] at where are you individually standing
[34:12] let's have a word of Prayer
[34:14] our heavenly father
[34:16] I'm quivering and shaking on the inside
[34:19] realizing that we're in the very
[34:20] presence of the king of kings
[34:23] what that ought to do is where to us
[34:25] Lord we are not we had not come here by
[34:27] chance this morning we've come here to
[34:29] see you to worship you to draw from you
[34:31] and to walk away here with a race to a
[34:34] higher plane walking closer to you
[34:36] there's a bride today that's walking
[34:38] with you Lord
[34:40] there's a bride today walking with you
[34:42] in her there's a close communion taking
[34:45] place between a bride and yourself
[34:47] [Music]
[34:49] Lord help us if there's anything in our
[34:52] life that would keep us out of our
[34:54] ordained position that you called us to
[34:56] take away the fear and quickly quickly
[34:59] Lord move upon these hearts that you've
[35:01] ordained to life and knowing that not
[35:03] one will be left to us behind
[35:06] then I say Lord to those that have that
[35:09] desire draw let that desire draw on the
[35:12] word of the hour and the time
[35:14] we ask you to bless your word now and
[35:17] then Lord I must I'm your servant I know
[35:20] that in myself there's not one good
[35:22] thing I cannot at all possibly be able
[35:26] to minister a word in season that would
[35:28] be for these people only you can do that
[35:30] and I'm not having confidence in this
[35:33] flesh because it's nothing I am
[35:35] confident in you
[35:37] that you will bring the word as you've
[35:39] ordained it this day
[35:42] here in this assembly of these people to
[35:44] feed your bride
[35:46] I'm nothing and I pray this Lord that
[35:49] you unveiled me from their sight
[35:51] and unveil yourself to their hearts
[35:56] and Lord May the revelation of the word
[35:58] stand in this hour Lord because there is
[36:02] individuals in this Earth today that is
[36:05] that revelation of yourself
[36:09] those are they
[36:12] that you're taking out of here we're on
[36:14] the March Lord I just say if anybody's
[36:17] got on a step of the word here in this
[36:20] assembly may they get back and step
[36:22] quickly
[36:23] and just be able to sell out everything
[36:25] and abandon themselves completely to
[36:28] what you've moved on their heart to do
[36:29] then Lord help them to consider their
[36:31] ways the house of God's got to be built
[36:35] and Lord every mineral every part every
[36:38] member of that body has a position in
[36:40] Ministry to minister their portion as
[36:43] you've given it to them that portion of
[36:45] yourself that little spoonful of
[36:47] yourself
[36:48] help us Lord to realize where we're at
[36:50] make your will known today I pray and
[36:53] reveal yourself we ask this in the name
[36:56] of Jesus Christ and For Your Glory amen

[39:18] before we move on here
[39:25] Isaiah our Exodus 25 31 and thou shall
[39:29] make a Candlestick of pure gold now we
[39:32] know what the Candlestick represents
[39:35] seven Church ages
[39:37] amen

[39:41] who's standing in the midst of it
[39:43] clothed as a bride
[39:46] he said where'd you get that from
[39:47] Prophet said so
[39:50] we see the sun we see one as the son of
[39:52] man clothed with perhaps gird about the

[40:04] and notice of beaten work
[40:07] it's a beaten work
[40:09] what was the gold have to be beat for so
[40:11] he could see his reflect his reflection
[40:13] in it
[40:14] is that right it was beaten work and so
[40:17] the character of of what was in that
[40:19] gold that the dross had to be taken out
[40:22] so that the character could Shum and
[40:24] shine forth amen all right
[40:27] so and El beaten gold shall the
[40:30] Candlestick be made

[40:42] his flowers shall be of the same
[40:46] all pure gold
[40:48] all right
[40:51] Isaiah chapter 60.
[40:58] and then I want to follow up with second
[41:00] Corinthians 4.
[41:03] and this Isaiah 60 will tie in with
[41:05] second Corinthians 4 and I begin with
[41:07] the sixth verse there
[41:10] Isaiah 60 verse 1.

[42:08] work it's his achievement it's his
[42:12] Candlestick it's his bride
[42:15] second Corinthians chapter four
[42:23] and that could take a lot of the second
[42:25] Corinthians 4 which which we can follow
[42:28] up with here talking about beaten we
[42:30] could take after we're through here but
[42:32] you could read more of it and maybe

[43:28] spirit for you to raise your hand yeah
[43:36] all right now let's go to verse six
[43:41] let's take verse 5 with this
[43:43] we preach not ourselves
[43:47] but Christ
[43:50] Jesus the Lord
[43:53] we are not here on this Earth the preach
[43:55] ourselves brother sister we are not here
[43:57] to do that we are here to preach Christ
[43:59] the unveiled revealed word in you
[44:04] the message of the hour
[44:09] all right
[44:11] ourselves your servants
[44:13] to serve you the message of the hour
[44:16] right ourselves your servants
[44:21] for Jesus sake now watch this sixth
[44:24] verse you talk about a birth you watch
[44:26] the sixth verse here's the new birth
[44:31] here for God who commanded the light who
[44:35] is it who we're speaking of Elohim
[44:38] the self-existent one the Eternal one
[44:42] eternal spirit are you right there's
[44:44] only one form of eternal life that's God
[44:46] all right then here he said for God who
[44:50] commanded the light to shine out of
[44:53] Darkness hath shine in our hearts to
[44:58] give
[45:00] the light of the knowledge of the glory
[45:04] of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[45:08] what's the face mean the person
[45:12] in the person of Jesus Christ what is
[45:15] the new birth it's Jesus Christ revealed
[45:17] in you personally
[45:22] amen
[45:23] it takes the work of God to do that and
[45:26] it takes the seed of God in your soul to
[45:28] be quickened
[45:30] or there is no birth
[45:33] you can be anointed in your spirit
[45:34] brother Branham after the seals he got
[45:36] the he got the soul the spirit before
[45:39] the seals he said coming from the inside
[45:41] see the spirit soul
[45:45] body but after the seals it was Soul
[45:48] Spirit body
[45:51] why after the seals because the book
[45:53] became a brand new book it opened up the
[45:56] word would discern between the spirit
[45:58] and the soul
[46:00] between who you are and who you're not
[46:05] amen that seed had to be quickened it
[46:08] takes the baptism of the Holy Ghost to
[46:10] Quicken that seed
[46:13] and they're all and they're in the
[46:14] ground both seeds are in the ground as
[46:16] we had heard last Sunday they're in the
[46:18] ground
[46:19] but one is wheat and the other is wild
[46:21] wheat
[46:22] they both very similar
[46:24] but they can't produce the same fruit
[46:28] are you with me they will never only one
[46:30] can produce Jesus Christ the same
[46:32] yesterday and today and forever
[46:35] the other cannot because it's not of him
[46:38] it was not his thought to begin with
[46:43] so you'd have the baptism on your spirit
[46:46] and still not have that ultimate of the
[46:48] word seed in your soul
[46:51] right that's right
[46:54] you go back and see what the prophet
[46:56] said it's your soul that came
[46:58] predestinence that seed that came
[47:00] predestinated eternally from God it was
[47:02] the thought
[47:05] and thought was made word and the Word
[47:07] was seed
[47:11] if you wanted him to begin with you're
[47:13] not a part of the word amen that's the
[47:15] bottom line that's why you respond to
[47:18] the word for the season because you're a
[47:20] part of that word for That season
[47:24] amen
[47:25] I know it sounds like I'm upset but you
[47:27] know me I you know what I'm like here
[47:31] I can only preach how God made me to
[47:33] preach
[47:34] amen so
[47:36] amen that's that that's the truth
[47:40] all right I'm nothing don't look at me
[47:42] look at him
[47:44] judge it by what you hear
[47:47] amen hearing from the word okay so we
[47:49] look here back again for God who
[47:51] commanded the light to shine out of
[47:53] Darkness hath shine let me put in your
[47:56] heart
[47:59] predestinated seed in your heart
[48:02] to give the light of what the Revelation
[48:05] the knowledge of the what's something
[48:07] something's opening here
[48:09] something's on being unveiled here to
[48:12] give the light of the knowledge of the
[48:14] glory of God in the person of Jesus
[48:17] Christ who are you meeting in you
[48:21] himself
[48:23] you come to a face-to-face meeting the
[48:26] Revelation in you now notice your light
[48:29] has come
[48:32] you may be seated
[48:34] the Revelation in you is the substance
[48:37] the revelation of the word in you is the
[48:41] substance
[48:42] the Eternal thought attribute that God
[48:45] had of you of himself
[48:48] let me read that again
[48:51] the Revelation faith is a revelation the
[48:55] Revelation Faith Revelation is the
[48:58] substance
[49:00] of things hoped for whatever the word
[49:03] promised you Revelation gives you the
[49:05] substance of it and the evidence of that
[49:09] which is not seen
[49:11] right
[49:13] you ever see it manifested but you have
[49:15] it
[49:16] and you know you have it
[49:20] because Revelation is not an imagination
[49:22] it's not a hope so it is a no so
[49:26] okay so the Revelation is in you
[49:31] oh who's what is the Revelation in you
[49:34] the word
[49:35] Christ the word Jesus Christ the word
[49:38] the Revelation in you is the substance
[49:40] it's the Eternal thought attribute
[49:43] because the attribute is God's thought
[49:45] he had attribute is that right
[49:48] that's God's thought of himself
[49:50] a being manifested declared tangible so
[49:55] the the Revelation in you is the
[49:57] substance Eternal thought attribute that
[49:59] God had of you of himself
[50:02] and we can find that well I'm referring
[50:04] you know what I'm referring to I just
[50:06] said Hebrews 11 1 for your body for and
[50:09] it's a it's the attribute
[50:12] the thought attribute that God had of
[50:14] you of himself the substance of your
[50:16] body change
[50:20] and the meeting of your bridegroom in
[50:23] the air as promised that's the earnest
[50:26] of it
[50:28] what is this Holy Spirit in you it is
[50:30] his Seed Faith
[50:32] all right Hallelujah
[50:36] brother what was what was Abraham's seed
[50:38] it was a face seed bro the prophet said
[50:41] Faith seed what's this faith in you
[50:44] that's been opened up it's himself
[50:47] it's his faith not yours it's his faith
[50:50] then then we begin to see this message
[50:53] brought us to our positive position
[50:54] which is our Victory because our Victory
[50:57] is our faith
[51:01] amen whose Faith his faith what's his
[51:04] faith it's our faith
[51:06] I'm talking about the bride's faith
[51:09] the bride's going to see this and it's
[51:10] only going to be known in her alone I
[51:13] don't know who she is but it'll be known
[51:15] individually by you
[51:17] because God will vindicate that to you
[51:20] himself personally
[51:23] you can't explain it you can't give it
[51:25] to somebody else it takes revelation
[51:28] you can't give revelation
[51:31] but you can impart life to Believers how
[51:34] through the word
[51:38] amen
[51:39] all right
[51:41] let's go to first John 4 19.
[51:45] see when we come back to that word being
[51:47] expressed we come to John 1 1 and 2.
[51:50] don't we in the beginning was the word
[51:52] and the Word was with God and the Word
[51:54] was God and the same was with God yeah
[51:57] are you with me and the same was with
[51:59] God
[52:00] what was with God
[52:04] what was with God
[52:06] let's look at the in the beginning was
[52:08] the word and the Word was with God and
[52:09] the Word was God what's the word
[52:13] the thought expressed
[52:16] okay the same was in the beginning with
[52:20] God what was the same in the beginning
[52:22] with God the word
[52:25] what was it his thought expressed
[52:29] then he himself became Melchizedek
[52:33] yeah is that right a word body yeah
[52:36] we didn't come to that but when he
[52:39] became Melchizedek I was in him
[52:42] Hallelujah
[52:44] I was in him
[52:46] now we can just take a long time I I had
[52:49] a lot of quotes on that on who is this
[52:51] Melchizedek about the thought
[52:54] becoming word
[52:55] you bypassed that theophany but you
[52:59] became in him when he met Abraham and
[53:02] you were in him when he met him at the
[53:05] tent
[53:08] amen because there was a man with Elohim
[53:11] represented through a man eating the
[53:13] Flesh of a cow and drinking the milk
[53:15] amen what God what God was as
[53:18] Melchizedek finally become flesh in his
[53:20] son Jesus Christ is that right
[53:23] and now at the end time he still speaks
[53:26] to us through his son I may know that
[53:28] Hebrews 1 what is it he'd have to come
[53:30] in the form of a prophet again with a
[53:32] perfect interpretation of the word and
[53:35] we saw God Among Us through a Ministry
[53:37] through a prophet now where do we see
[53:40] God
[53:41] that word had that message had to go
[53:43] somewhere where'd it go it was said to
[53:45] someone where is it
[53:49] Hallelujah
[53:51] amen all right so we see here
[53:56] that John 1 1 is true now this is where
[54:00] we're identified
[54:01] how are we identified
[54:03] by knowing him we don't know him as an
[54:07] imagination of thought we know him as a
[54:10] person
[54:11] to know him is to know the person of
[54:13] Christ
[54:16] so in first first John 4 19.
[54:21] very familiar scripture we love him
[54:23] because he first loved us
[54:28] then with that thought in mind you say I
[54:31] love him I know I love him I'm certain
[54:33] that I have his love then he loved you
[54:35] before the world began then if he loved
[54:38] you then he knew you now let's go over
[54:41] to first let's go over to Saint John
[54:48] chapter 10 verse 14.
[54:51] I am the Good Shepherd and I know my
[54:55] sheep
[54:56] when did he know you before the world
[54:59] began
[55:01] if he could love me before the world
[55:02] began and I love him by that love then
[55:05] did not he know me as the reason I know
[55:07] him hallelujah how can I know him if he
[55:10] had known me first
[55:12] how could I choose him if he hadn't
[55:14] chosen me first
[55:17] yet he gave me a choice didn't he
[55:21] but you were what I couldn't have chosen
[55:23] him except he had already chosen me but
[55:26] he gave me a choice of choosing to prove
[55:29] his choice
[55:31] Hallelujah
[55:36] hope you got that
[55:39] all right so I am the Good Shepherd and
[55:42] know my sheep and am known
[55:47] of mine
[55:51] they know me I knew them I knew them
[55:54] there's a reason they know me
[55:56] all right verse 15 16 and other sheep I
[56:00] or 15. and as the father knoweth me even
[56:03] so know I the father
[56:07] then in that day you shall know that I'm
[56:09] in the father father me and I in you and
[56:11] you and me then you know who you are
[56:14] people where's the bride today she knows
[56:17] who she is
[56:22] and it's this Revelation that's taking
[56:24] her to a body change
[56:28] amen
[56:30] the Rapture has already begun within you
[56:32] it's already progressed it's already
[56:34] started it's their unfolding itself
[56:37] right into a body change
[56:40] what are we walking with in the step of
[56:42] this perfect interpretation of his word
[56:45] by Divine vindication
[56:49] we have that brother sister
[56:52] if you knew we'd have it you'd be
[56:54] running to this message
[56:56] because this message is the thing that
[56:59] brings life
[57:03] this is the eternal
[57:07] what you see is not Eternal it's
[57:09] temporal
[57:11] but what is not seen is eternal
[57:14] I'm talking about these eyes you don't
[57:16] you what you while we look not at the
[57:19] things which are seen but the things
[57:21] that are not seen for the things we look
[57:23] at that are seen are temporal but the
[57:25] things that are not seen are what
[57:27] Eternal and the Eternal is the real the
[57:30] Eternal is the true substance
[57:36] amen amen amen
[57:39] all right so we we know we realize that
[57:43] he knew us now
[57:48] let's go back to what the prophet said
[57:50] the church AIDS book about where I
[57:52] referred he loved Jacob how Jacob was
[57:56] before he'd done Jacob resaw done any
[57:58] works of of any good or bad Works he
[58:00] loved Jacob
[58:03] see it's not of your doing it's his
[58:05] doing
[58:07] Satan wants to twist you around on your
[58:09] failures and your faults and your
[58:11] mistakes and say see you did this you
[58:13] did that I can turn right back to it
[58:15] instead of according to the word I never
[58:17] did it
[58:18] I have the blood I'm under the blood I
[58:20] have the blood I have the identification
[58:22] of the blood
[58:24] applied in me I can point you back to
[58:27] what the scripture said and have the
[58:29] authority of that life in that blood and
[58:31] the Seal of God for where the Seal of
[58:33] God is God is
[58:37] you can't have the Seal of a king
[58:39] without the king being there you can't
[58:41] have the Seal of God without God being
[58:43] here
[58:44] so where is he
[58:49] he says in his word then where is the
[58:51] word
[58:54] Hallelujah then I point right back and
[58:57] point back to a finished work of Calvary
[58:59] the seal denotes a fittest work the
[59:01] sealed denotes who I'm owned by the seal
[59:04] denotes my destination it's finished
[59:07] Brian it's finished just lay in the
[59:10] presence of the son of the revealed word
[59:13] of the message of the hour which is the
[59:15] revelations 10 which is the Seven Seals
[59:18] and lay in that presence of that open
[59:20] book start feeding
[59:23] consider your ways
[59:27] start feeding and growing lay in the
[59:30] presence of the sun to ripen
[59:32] when that last one recognizes and
[59:34] realizes who she is and what she is it
[59:37] will take the body change
[59:40] that could happen very quick I'm warning
[59:42] you by the presence of the Lord Jesus
[59:44] that is very soon to happen
[59:49] I mean very soon
[59:53] I know that you say how do you know that
[59:55] because I see the level the bride's
[59:57] coming up to
[1:00:01] yeah amen she's right at the level of
[1:00:03] maturity she's she she's realizing she's
[1:00:05] one with her head
[1:00:07] she's one she has what is her what is
[1:00:09] what is her what is her outcome she's
[1:00:12] the queen of the king she has her place
[1:00:15] in his throne she's a part of his
[1:00:18] headship Hallelujah
[1:00:21] do you realize what this revelation of
[1:00:24] this message is doing
[1:00:31] amen all right so concerning Jacob
[1:00:34] brother Brown says see
[1:00:39] Jacob it was the thought what comes
[1:00:42] predestinated eternally from God brother
[1:00:44] Branham asks the question
[1:00:46] it's not the person it's not David
[1:00:51] it's the seed it's the thought of God
[1:00:55] when you realize that you're the summary
[1:00:58] substance of himself and realize that
[1:01:01] that substance is existing and always
[1:01:03] was existent in God you will get a great
[1:01:06] distance
[1:01:07] in your own in your own living with God
[1:01:13] because this in itself
[1:01:16] is the very thing that that that becomes
[1:01:20] alive to you and to realize you always
[1:01:23] were eternal life
[1:01:26] I'm talking about the real you
[1:01:29] I'm talking about you that was in him
[1:01:30] you that was his thought
[1:01:33] who expressed in the word
[1:01:36] and he expressed you today in a word he
[1:01:38] said let there be and here you are glory
[1:01:41] to God that's exactly what had happened
[1:01:44] how did he do that because his word Came
[1:01:46] To His prophets and they expressed the
[1:01:49] very thought of God for the season
[1:01:55] and you're we're in that word
[1:01:58] and you had to be spoken into
[1:01:59] manifestation brother Brown said that's
[1:02:02] how his children are born
[1:02:09] did you know that because they are a
[1:02:11] spoken word creation I just said right
[1:02:14] there this God who spoke the light in
[1:02:16] the darkness has
[1:02:18] expressed himself in you
[1:02:21] given to give the knowledge of who you
[1:02:24] are to give the knowledge of this birth
[1:02:26] to show you that you're the new birth
[1:02:30] you are the seed you are the thought
[1:02:32] just like Jacob
[1:02:34] he knew Jacob he knew him he loved him
[1:02:36] before the world began
[1:02:39] where is those Jacobs out here this
[1:02:42] morning where is those true ones that
[1:02:44] have had a name change
[1:02:48] amen that showed we have Victory we are
[1:02:52] his victory
[1:02:53] the bride is his victory the brightest
[1:02:55] is very blood because the blood contains
[1:02:58] and holds the life
[1:03:00] so she is his life manifested
[1:03:05] amen amen which is light
[1:03:11] amen amen amen and he said and ye are
[1:03:15] the light
[1:03:19] then you and the light become one rise
[1:03:22] Shine for thy light has come then you
[1:03:24] and the messenger one you are the words
[1:03:26] you are the Revelation in the book the
[1:03:29] little book
[1:03:32] amen amen you say why is a little book
[1:03:35] because it's contained as another record
[1:03:37] in the Book of Life
[1:03:42] it's the eternal life record of himself
[1:03:45] that's exactly right
[1:03:49] and who's this book open to her the
[1:03:52] bride alone
[1:03:54] this Secret
[1:03:56] can only be known by her alone The
[1:03:58] Secret of his coming is only known by
[1:04:01] her alone because she's here to glorify
[1:04:03] and manifest that very thing
[1:04:08] see it come in such Simplicity that goes
[1:04:11] beyond the theologians beyond the
[1:04:12] message theologians beyond the rest of
[1:04:14] the theologians it comes down to an
[1:04:16] individual and you are holding that very
[1:04:18] revelation
[1:04:22] Hallelujah
[1:04:26] amen I'm going to come to if the Lord
[1:04:29] Lobby I'll come to the very evidence of
[1:04:30] the Holy Ghost when you have a Divine
[1:04:32] perfect evidence whether you have the
[1:04:34] Holy Ghost or not
[1:04:38] think of that
[1:04:41] all right
[1:04:43] now let's look at this a minute just
[1:04:46] starting all right Daniel let's go to to
[1:04:49] Daniel
[1:04:51] and I I'm just gonna I cover those
[1:04:52] pretty quick but you can go back in the
[1:04:54] church age book and find out he said
[1:04:56] Jacob alone had the seed not Esau
[1:05:00] even though they came out of Godly
[1:05:02] Parents
[1:05:03] but Jacob alone had the seed
[1:05:08] that was God's choosing that was God's
[1:05:10] achievement that wasn't Jacob's
[1:05:12] achievement that was God recognizing
[1:05:15] himself right
[1:05:17] Jacob was a shyster but God didn't look
[1:05:20] him at it as a shyster he saw him as
[1:05:22] wanting that Birthright
[1:05:24] there was something in him that desired
[1:05:26] that Birthright and God gave him a God
[1:05:28] gave him a a a a filter to to draw
[1:05:32] through
[1:05:39] you're gonna have to come through the
[1:05:40] word if you're gonna have a word birth
[1:05:42] you've got to come through the blood
[1:05:43] you've got to come through the blood of
[1:05:45] the blood is the light word for the
[1:05:47] season
[1:05:48] right now you are hearing the message
[1:05:51] preach you are hearing the blood the
[1:05:53] blood is being preached right here
[1:05:54] before you
[1:05:56] right
[1:05:58] amen that's exactly right if we walk in
[1:06:00] the light as he is in the light we have
[1:06:02] what do we have we have Fellowship one
[1:06:04] with another and the blood of Jesus
[1:06:06] Christ cleanses us from all sin then
[1:06:08] you're hearing light this morning you're
[1:06:10] receiving light
[1:06:14] you're hearing the message of the hour
[1:06:17] preached this morning I'm not it hasn't
[1:06:20] been preached I'm just saying here this
[1:06:21] morning
[1:06:23] that's what's happening
[1:06:24] right that's what's happening with these
[1:06:26] word ministers they're bringing the
[1:06:27] light to the season and the bride's
[1:06:29] going to respond to that light that's
[1:06:31] all there is to it I can't make him
[1:06:32] respond I don't have to make him respond
[1:06:34] it doesn't matter to me how you respond
[1:06:38] right
[1:06:39] it doesn't matter to me how you respond
[1:06:41] to it God will see to it that the light
[1:06:44] picks up the seed
[1:06:47] the light was sent to the seed
[1:06:50] the only one that can have a new birth
[1:06:51] is those elected because in the rest of
[1:06:54] them there's nothing to Quicken
[1:06:56] they can have the anointing they can
[1:06:58] shout they can dance have every outward
[1:07:00] expression even have the gifts of Saint
[1:07:02] or First Corinthians 12.
[1:07:04] and still not have the word inside of
[1:07:07] them
[1:07:08] because the gifts are nothing but just
[1:07:09] the manifestation of the spirits among
[1:07:11] you
[1:07:12] but without that word
[1:07:14] said those are no evidence that's no
[1:07:17] evidence that the Holy Ghost dwells in
[1:07:19] your soul
[1:07:22] having those gifts because they're going
[1:07:24] to work among the people and it's the
[1:07:25] Holy Spirit doing it
[1:07:27] but without that word the evidence lays
[1:07:29] in the revelation of the word and the
[1:07:32] ability to be able to hear the word for
[1:07:34] the season it will be revealed to you
[1:07:38] Hallelujah
[1:07:43] they have an ear to hear
[1:07:48] you can't keep that bright
[1:07:49] from knowing your husband because she
[1:07:51] always was part of her husband and when
[1:07:53] the husband was expressed as the message
[1:07:55] of the hour she's got to be expressed
[1:07:57] too
[1:08:01] yeah I'm just going to jump ahead just a
[1:08:02] bit here the same word that spoke of the
[1:08:04] groom
[1:08:05] this is a direct quote right out of I
[1:08:07] think it's a uh the seals third seal I
[1:08:10] believe but I've got it written I've got
[1:08:12] it here the same word that spoke of the
[1:08:14] groom spoke speaks of the Bride
[1:08:21] because they're not separated
[1:08:25] she was the very she was the very she's
[1:08:27] she is his eternal thought of himself
[1:08:32] you think that can fail
[1:08:36] and it's ordained to be in its season
[1:08:39] in its decreed season you being that
[1:08:42] thought have to come to life in that
[1:08:44] season to manifest himself
[1:08:49] amen I've got all this backed up I don't
[1:08:51] know how much I'm going to get of it but
[1:08:53] I'm just going to say it anyway
[1:08:55] because it's every bit the message
[1:08:58] all right now
[1:09:02] so we know then that that was there
[1:09:06] in that thought of Jacob because Jacob
[1:09:09] alone was seed if you are true seed you
[1:09:12] will he said hear that word
[1:09:17] there it is just this simple
[1:09:20] if you are true seed you will hear that
[1:09:23] word and God will have is obligated to
[1:09:25] make sure you hear it correctly yeah
[1:09:30] yeah you're not going to be deceived
[1:09:31] because Jesus Christ can't be deceived
[1:09:37] you may get off the line a little bit
[1:09:39] off the track but he's got him obligated
[1:09:41] to bring that word back online
[1:09:44] you'll never get offline you're always
[1:09:47] hid to begin with and nobody else can
[1:09:49] have you
[1:09:53] amen you let that become a revelation to
[1:09:56] you personally one time and see what
[1:09:57] happens to you
[1:10:00] you're a totally changed man person all
[1:10:03] right
[1:10:06] then the true evidence becomes and he
[1:10:09] said you will hear that seed you will
[1:10:11] hear that word the spirit will baptize
[1:10:14] you into the body of Christ filling you
[1:10:16] and empowering you and you will receive
[1:10:18] the word for your day and age he said
[1:10:21] see how clear the true evidence becomes
[1:10:24] when the word is revealed to you
[1:10:29] you will you will receive the full
[1:10:32] revelation of God and from God for that
[1:10:35] day
[1:10:37] here's your evidence
[1:10:40] and when what's the Revelation to do a
[1:10:42] true revelation will be Vindicated by
[1:10:43] the word
[1:10:45] it'll be backed up by the word to you
[1:10:47] personally
[1:10:49] it's not a whim it's not an idea
[1:10:52] it's God unveiling himself to you
[1:10:54] personally individually this is an
[1:10:58] individual Affair not a group affair
[1:11:02] amen this is an individual affair
[1:11:06] you can get it no one else can get it I
[1:11:08] can get it the one set and to be missing
[1:11:12] that doesn't mean anything that just
[1:11:14] exalts Jesus Christ and his promised
[1:11:17] word of election
[1:11:22] though that election might stand Jacob I
[1:11:25] loved Esau I hated
[1:11:27] so elections got to stand
[1:11:31] he knows his own he knows his own people
[1:11:34] amen is that right the foundation of God
[1:11:36] stand assure having the seal the Lord
[1:11:38] knoweth them that are his
[1:11:42] amen amen
[1:11:44] there you are
[1:11:46] that ought to give you enough Assurance
[1:11:47] right there when you see the word opened
[1:11:49] up in you

[1:11:53] and has opened up himself in you there's
[1:11:57] your treasure I didn't even read oh I I
[1:11:59] didn't even finish
[1:12:01] let's go back here to Second Corinthians
[1:12:04] I didn't hit the most point here
[1:12:07] but now's the time to hit it so we read
[1:12:09] verse six did we not
[1:12:11] second Corinthians 4 6 let's read verse
[1:12:13] 7.
[1:12:16] but we have
[1:12:20] this treasure
[1:12:23] what's this treasure I've been preaching

[1:12:55] we have this treasure in Earthen vessels
[1:13:00] no good vessels Earthen vessels dying
[1:13:03] vessels

[1:13:11] sound boat in David
[1:13:13] in David there isn't that soul of mine
[1:13:16] though let's see
[1:13:18] so I have no confidence in the flesh in
[1:13:21] the carnal man because my carnal mind is
[1:13:23] enmity to God
[1:13:26] what's an enmity mean it's an enemy
[1:13:28] against him who's controlling him the
[1:13:30] word
[1:13:32] the words bringing him under Authority

[1:13:41] from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:13:43] raised up Christ the anointed word where
[1:13:45] in you what a resurrection that was but
[1:13:48] what a resurrection this is
[1:13:51] I'm living in a resurrection I pass from
[1:13:54] Death to life and because I have that as
[1:13:56] substance I've got to be a part of that
[1:13:58] Resurrection because I realized I was in
[1:14:00] his thought and his thought became word
[1:14:02] and I was in Melchizedek I've already
[1:14:04] heard from my theophany because when the
[1:14:06] word was spoken today I received it I
[1:14:09] was able to hear it I've already
[1:14:10] received my theophy I've already heard
[1:14:12] from it
[1:14:13] then I've got to come to it
[1:14:17] I'm already identified to be there
[1:14:21] talk about arrest
[1:14:23] talk about arrest talk about a seal
[1:14:29] look at the authorities been given to
[1:14:30] you bride through the word
[1:14:34] not to use loosely
[1:14:36] frivolously but as he directs You by
[1:14:39] faith

[1:14:42] you're his wife
[1:14:45] amen are you are you with me

[1:14:59] this mind be in you that was in Christ
[1:15:01] Jesus who be in the form or a morphe of
[1:15:04] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:15:06] with God
[1:15:09] I'll come to that in just a minute Lord
[1:15:11] willing much of this I'm just going to
[1:15:13] have to speak out
[1:15:15] I have the message in my heart I like to
[1:15:17] back it up with what he said but
[1:15:20] you can search out what he said we're
[1:15:22] far enough down the line you ought to be
[1:15:23] feeding on this word you don't ought to
[1:15:25] be not scratching your head and
[1:15:27] wondering what in the world is being
[1:15:28] said you need to get in this word if
[1:15:31] there's any movement of God in you at
[1:15:32] all I I say to you by the grace and
[1:15:35] mercy of God
[1:15:36] get in this word start realizing where
[1:15:40] you're at

[1:16:04] things on the Sabbath day our Sabbath
[1:16:06] day is rest our rest is the Holy Ghost
[1:16:08] himself
[1:16:12] God said I can't even bless you because
[1:16:13] of that but because you're wanting to do
[1:16:15] your own thing you're wanting to do your
[1:16:16] own way you're trying to mix those two
[1:16:18] things together and it can't be mixed
[1:16:20] God's word will not be mixed with your
[1:16:24] own self
[1:16:28] it's either the word or nothing either
[1:16:30] the words you're absolute or you're your
[1:16:32] absolute and if you or your absolute
[1:16:34] you've lifted up as an idol
[1:16:37] there's only one Idol you serve and
[1:16:39] that's not a dead Idol that's a living
[1:16:40] Idol of the living presence of Jesus
[1:16:43] Christ in you and he makes you a living
[1:16:45] image of himself

[1:19:02] attributes remember the attributes is
[1:19:05] his thought
[1:19:08] her identity is found in him
[1:19:12] what he is she is to reflect
[1:19:15] what do you got to worry about what
[1:19:17] others think of you that's not your
[1:19:19] identity
[1:19:23] your identity is in him
[1:19:27] what greater identity could you have
[1:19:33] than him himself
[1:19:36] the King of Kings the Lord of lords
[1:19:40] the almighty the Everlasting one

[1:20:10] her identity is found in him what he is
[1:20:14] she is to reflect
[1:20:17] what he has she is to manifest
[1:20:22] there is no fault in her underline that
[1:20:27] there is no fault in her
[1:20:32] now if you know to do good and doeth it
[1:20:34] not you need to repent
[1:20:38] is that right
[1:20:40] if you've done something that displeases
[1:20:42] him take a hold of blood and apply it
[1:20:44] right if you know that you're his you're
[1:20:46] his son you're his seed and manifest in
[1:20:49] flesh which makes you a son then just
[1:20:52] simply repent of it
[1:20:54] genuinely from your heart and take a
[1:20:57] hold of what God said there's no fault
[1:21:00] in her
[1:21:05] who's he looking at when he sees that
[1:21:08] he's not judging you by this outer man
[1:21:10] he's judging you by his revealed word
[1:21:14] amen himself
[1:21:16] Jesus Christ is the revelation of the
[1:21:18] word
[1:21:21] amen
[1:21:23] amen there you are
[1:21:26] all right now
[1:21:28] what he was what he has what he has she
[1:21:32] is to manifest
[1:21:35] so what he has is it on property
[1:21:38] but here she is to manifest what he has
[1:21:40] she is so what does that make us Christ
[1:21:44] in Bride form
[1:21:47] whoa Brother David now you're getting
[1:21:49] too deep
[1:21:50] no you're not going deep enough
[1:21:54] you don't start getting a little deep
[1:21:56] you're going to miss the rapture
[1:21:57] I'm not talking about deep in your
[1:21:59] intellects I'm talking about deeper in
[1:22:01] Revelation
[1:22:05] amen
[1:22:07] well I believe God said a prophet that
[1:22:09] won't put you in the rapture
[1:22:12] but the message revealed in you will
[1:22:16] amen
[1:22:18] that's right
[1:22:22] oh but we'll we have our own ways we'll
[1:22:24] do our own things I won't let you in
[1:22:25] that door of my personal life Lord just
[1:22:28] come in step inside the house just stand
[1:22:30] there don't go to meddling through these
[1:22:32] other doors of the house
[1:22:35] is that what you're saying to me
[1:22:39] or do you want him to go in every door
[1:22:41] every door
[1:22:43] and clean out every door there's
[1:22:44] something that's contrary to as well
[1:22:46] cleaned out Lord because there's one
[1:22:47] ambition I have become absolutely one
[1:22:50] with you
[1:22:53] amen
[1:22:54] and and we realize we're in the age of
[1:22:56] the marriage
[1:22:58] and that's a union
[1:23:01] okay yeah
[1:23:03] yeah and he actually did perform that
[1:23:05] when the seals were opened up the lamb
[1:23:08] performed it and he had a prophet
[1:23:09] perform the marriage
[1:23:12] it took the prophet to do that you know
[1:23:14] he said the first thing I did at the
[1:23:16] start of that message God in Simplicity
[1:23:18] 1963 the opening of those seals first
[1:23:21] thing I did was to perform a wedding
[1:23:25] and he did it in the back room kind of a
[1:23:27] little room you know set aside
[1:23:29] in the cathedral
[1:23:36] you'd have been around the message you
[1:23:37] know what I'm talking about
[1:23:39] unless you go back in that little room
[1:23:40] behind that Veil you gotta have blood to
[1:23:43] go back in there you've got to go in
[1:23:44] there yourself
[1:23:46] and if you go in there yourself you're
[1:23:48] going to come out totally changed I
[1:23:50] guarantee it because you met him face to
[1:23:52] face second Corinthians 3 6.
[1:23:57] face-to-face meeting with Christ himself
[1:23:59] that's what it takes
[1:24:06] because it was brought last Sunday
[1:24:07] you've got to come those three steps
[1:24:09] but notice the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:11] made way for the Holy Ghost himself to
[1:24:14] come right down in Perfection again back
[1:24:17] to the word
[1:24:20] amen amen amen
[1:24:26] all right now
[1:24:30] so what he has she's to manifest there
[1:24:32] is no fault in her she is all glorious
[1:24:35] within and without
[1:24:39] so settle Into Your Heart Right Now how
[1:24:41] God sees you and quit Looking Through
[1:24:43] The Eyes of others or your own self to
[1:24:45] see how and what you are
[1:24:54] from the beginning
[1:24:56] to the ending he that has begun a good
[1:24:58] work remember the Bible said he will
[1:25:00] finish it and he who calleth you
[1:25:02] Faithful Is He Who calleth you who also
[1:25:04] will do it
[1:25:07] right okay then he said from beginning
[1:25:10] to ending she's the work of her Lord she
[1:25:12] is Alpha also she's Omega how may know
[1:25:16] you've read that Masterpiece she is also
[1:25:18] Alpha and Omega and the reason she's
[1:25:20] she's brought to nothing today because
[1:25:22] there's no Beauty we desire her
[1:25:24] right she's despised rejected because
[1:25:26] she is the word also
[1:25:29] she is himself revealed in Bride form
[1:25:36] and who is this bride revealing the son
[1:25:38] of man again
[1:25:40] listen brother sister
[1:25:44] we're not doing anything away with real
[1:25:45] Pentecost real Pentecost started without
[1:25:47] a ending but Pentecostalism ended
[1:25:52] because ism is denominationalism
[1:25:55] organization
[1:25:57] Pentecost real Pentecost was life that
[1:26:01] doesn't end with that doesn't he brother
[1:26:02] Brown said it started without an ending
[1:26:04] it had to have a moment coming out of
[1:26:07] Eternity where it had to have its
[1:26:08] manifestation and that manifestation
[1:26:10] without ending
[1:26:13] are you with me
[1:26:15] but Pentecostalism come to an end
[1:26:17] because it denominated on tongues and
[1:26:20] manifestations of gifts they denominated
[1:26:23] on the very thing of shouting and
[1:26:24] feeling good when it's not in at all it
[1:26:27] was the word revealed in you which only
[1:26:30] God can do
[1:26:33] doing that
[1:26:34] to the word promise for the hour and
[1:26:36] when that comes in you it's going to
[1:26:38] live out
[1:26:41] but still you have people wanting to
[1:26:42] judge you by how how hard you scream and
[1:26:45] how hard you speak and how how how how
[1:26:47] how offending it is and everything can't
[1:26:50] be instead of by the word
[1:26:54] and the life you live let me see the let
[1:26:56] me see the music you listen to let me
[1:26:58] see the pictures you have in your wall
[1:27:00] let me see how much of this video and
[1:27:02] this nonsense you're looking at let me
[1:27:04] see what you're feeding on and I'll tell
[1:27:06] you what's in you
[1:27:09] because what's in you if it's a word has
[1:27:11] one Joy one pleasure has one thing that
[1:27:14] it rejoices in and that's the word for
[1:27:16] the hour
[1:27:20] let me see where you're feeding how many
[1:27:22] know the prophet even said that let me
[1:27:24] see what you look at let me see where
[1:27:25] you're feeding let me see what pictures
[1:27:27] you have on your wall let me see you're
[1:27:29] let me see your life every day when you
[1:27:32] make a mistake what are you going to do
[1:27:33] about it
[1:27:34] if you air somebody what are you going
[1:27:36] to do about it let me see the Holy Ghost
[1:27:38] in action
[1:27:43] is that right sure it's right
[1:27:46] you know it's right it brings conviction
[1:27:48] but conviction's good it's better than
[1:27:50] condemnation
[1:27:54] conviction's good when you know to do it
[1:27:57] then repent and make it right and go on
[1:28:00] say Lord I need you yeah it just only
[1:28:02] shows I need you I need more of you if
[1:28:06] you don't have the desire for more of
[1:28:07] him I wonder about your experience with
[1:28:10] Christ
[1:28:13] if you're not having any desire for this
[1:28:15] message I wonder about your experience
[1:28:17] in Christ if there's no desire to feed
[1:28:19] on the word and only your desires to
[1:28:21] have more of the world if you love the
[1:28:23] world the things of the world the love
[1:28:24] of God which I just spoke of is not even
[1:28:26] in you
[1:28:32] amen that's right all right so
[1:28:36] notice I related to that having the mind
[1:28:39] of Christ God's become in morphe in a
[1:28:41] form and he's here in the form today in
[1:28:43] Bride form
[1:28:44] did anybody ever hear Prophet say that
[1:28:46] on the message invisible Union
[1:28:52] it's Jesus Christ it's Jesus again in
[1:28:55] Bride form the same Jesus now without a
[1:28:58] revelation of who he is you'll miss it a
[1:29:00] million miles
[1:29:01] but when you realize that he's the word
[1:29:04] let me just go back here do you realize
[1:29:06] that that the same God let me look at
[1:29:10] this just a moment
[1:29:11] God in morphe mask in a pillar of fire
[1:29:14] now let's just back up here a minute the
[1:29:16] bride form and that's what the Bible has
[1:29:19] been it's been a work of God that's been
[1:29:21] covered up and it's been hid since the
[1:29:23] foundation of the world and its
[1:29:25] Sevenfold mystery we'll come to that in
[1:29:27] just a minute and it's Sevenfold mystery
[1:29:30] and God promised in this day at the end
[1:29:32] of the laodicean age he would take the
[1:29:34] mask off the whole thing and we could
[1:29:37] see it
[1:29:39] so it's been a hidden Mystery
[1:29:41] but now unveiled and we hold this in
[1:29:44] Earthen vessels
[1:29:48] why because so the Excellency of the
[1:29:50] power may be of God and not of David
[1:29:55] David can't produce that
[1:29:57] it's not of the man it's of the word
[1:29:59] himself revealed in you
[1:30:02] this is what sets the bride apart from
[1:30:04] the tribulation Saints right there
[1:30:07] because they that were ready
[1:30:10] had the birth
[1:30:12] had the birth of the word came through
[1:30:14] their Pentecost they that were ready was
[1:30:16] entered was ready to enter into the
[1:30:18] message of the hour of Revelation 10.
[1:30:20] and when they entered into that message
[1:30:22] what happened they entered into marriage
[1:30:24] with him
[1:30:26] Matthew 25 10.
[1:30:30] and they that were ready only she was
[1:30:32] ready
[1:30:35] he said I don't disagree with that
[1:30:36] that's fine if you disagree that's fine
[1:30:39] I'm not asking you to stand up and
[1:30:40] disagree with everything I say but if
[1:30:43] you disagree I ask you one thing go
[1:30:45] search it out right
[1:30:49] amen
[1:30:51] they that were ready went in because the
[1:30:53] med the Messi The Voice already went out
[1:30:55] the bridegroom coming
[1:30:57] and all of the virgins rose up to meet
[1:30:59] him
[1:31:01] but some lacked oil no revelation
[1:31:04] no Holy Ghost no revelation
[1:31:07] oh they had the shout they had the
[1:31:09] feeling they had all these others they
[1:31:10] had the gifts amongst them everything
[1:31:11] else but they had no revelation
[1:31:15] but they that were ready went beyond
[1:31:17] they turned the corner
[1:31:19] and went into the bride age
[1:31:23] they went into the bride time they went
[1:31:26] into the seed time
[1:31:29] do you realize this is seed time back to
[1:31:32] the seed again
[1:31:35] back to the grain again do you rise who
[1:31:38] you are bride
[1:31:41] you're that grain made manifest in the
[1:31:43] bride form you're that grain in the
[1:31:45] formation of the Bride
[1:31:48] well you say he was the grade that's
[1:31:50] what I'm talking about
[1:31:52] that's her
[1:31:54] also
[1:31:56] and in order to fulfill scripture it had
[1:31:58] to go back to the type of Genesis 2.
[1:32:02] she came out of Adam she was the mystery
[1:32:05] of Adam revealed and Christ in you is
[1:32:08] the mystery of God revealed
[1:32:12] well that was a good one
[1:32:14] Christ in you is the mystery of God
[1:32:17] revealed
[1:32:18] that's what makes you the complete
[1:32:20] revelation
[1:32:22] and that is the message of Revelations
[1:32:25] 10. that is the message of Revelations
[1:32:27] 10 7 in the days of the voice of the
[1:32:30] seventh angel the finished mystery of
[1:32:32] God would be finished the mystery of God
[1:32:35] would be finished
[1:32:37] completed what's the prophet trying to
[1:32:40] tell us here don't you see the formation
[1:32:42] of the word Back to Eden we're heading
[1:32:45] what where are we headed now right back
[1:32:47] to Eden
[1:32:49] as bride and bridegroom
[1:32:51] the prophet said it very clear and cry
[1:32:53] and if you haven't read Christ The
[1:32:54] Mystery of God revealed I would suggest
[1:32:56] you saturate yourself in it
[1:32:59] because he's preaching the seventh seal
[1:33:01] in that message
[1:33:04] his message is right there
[1:33:07] I mean it's not it's in all the rest of
[1:33:09] them too because I got several quotes
[1:33:10] but it ties everything ties together
[1:33:13] right under that threefold mystery
[1:33:16] amen of himself
[1:33:21] amen that's right now he said now under
[1:33:24] the unveiling of what's been opened up
[1:33:26] he said now I can say this
[1:33:29] The Head and the body had become one
[1:33:31] unit
[1:33:32] what is that for the bride it's maturity
[1:33:35] because brother Branham said What
[1:33:37] followed those mess what was hidden in
[1:33:39] that in that pyramid that stone was in
[1:33:42] there Unwritten word Unwritten what not
[1:33:44] out of the word not out of the Scripture
[1:33:46] it was in the scripture but it was
[1:33:48] Unwritten in Revelations 10.
[1:33:51] and that Unwritten word that mystery had
[1:33:53] to go somewhere and it had to be
[1:33:54] unveiled because he said this message
[1:33:56] unveils it how many believe the Seven
[1:33:58] Seals opened
[1:34:00] only just a few here all right believe
[1:34:03] it's opened well bless your hearts
[1:34:06] because I'll tell you what it is opened
[1:34:10] and it's unveiled who you are and where
[1:34:11] your sand is you have been positionally
[1:34:14] placed by that revelation
[1:34:17] do you realize that
[1:34:18] Brother Brad said it's so good to see
[1:34:20] ourselves positionally placed in what
[1:34:24] Christ which is what the mystery of God
[1:34:27] revealed
[1:34:30] the whole message he preached there was
[1:34:32] Christ The Mystery of God revealed what
[1:34:36] was he saying about you bride and the
[1:34:38] whole thing
[1:34:41] that you're the mystery
[1:34:44] completed
[1:34:47] and if that mystery is completed then
[1:34:49] it's ready for Redemption to the Earth
[1:34:51] it's got to come back to Eden again
[1:34:54] and the seventh day has got to be
[1:34:56] finished an Earth Day a seventh stage
[1:34:58] time for the Earth you did you come out
[1:35:01] of that you're now heading into the
[1:35:03] rapture you've got eternal life now
[1:35:05] working in you you've got Rapture in you
[1:35:07] what's it for to take you to a body
[1:35:09] change
[1:35:10] if this message had to come in this hour
[1:35:13] there's no way we would have a body
[1:35:15] change there is no way
[1:35:17] this would be fulfilled
[1:35:22] it took something it had to be revealed
[1:35:25] that hidden word those seven Thunders
[1:35:27] spoke of what those seals
[1:35:30] would make known
[1:35:32] it was a revelation contained in those
[1:35:34] seals
[1:35:36] that set the bride literally literally
[1:35:39] turned the heart of the Bride back to
[1:35:40] the original faith what was the original
[1:35:42] Faith Christ's own faith
[1:35:48] glory to God that's exactly right
[1:35:52] notice
[1:35:54] so from beginning then she's the work of
[1:35:57] her Lord and all his works are perfect
[1:36:01] in fact in her is summed up you know
[1:36:04] what a sum is if you sum up something
[1:36:06] and you you find the completed thing
[1:36:09] well that's the cost it's completed
[1:36:12] here's the sum right here
[1:36:15] the completion it's the Finish
[1:36:17] in fact in her is summed up and
[1:36:21] manifested the Eternal wisdom and
[1:36:23] purpose of God
[1:36:25] oh think of that where is that found in
[1:36:29] her right
[1:36:33] I'll make it even in you
[1:36:38] any hers here
[1:36:40] men or women it's her
[1:36:42] it's in her
[1:36:44] in you
[1:36:46] what was in him is now manifest in you
[1:36:48] so it's himself manifested Among Us
[1:36:53] brother Branham said it's the mystery of
[1:36:55] his coming
[1:36:59] all right and I'm not saying it's all
[1:37:02] all finished I'm saying but I'm saying
[1:37:04] this it's climax in our meeting in the
[1:37:06] air
[1:37:07] but he has come
[1:37:09] he appeared on Sunset Mountain just
[1:37:11] exactly what Acts chapter 1 verse 11
[1:37:14] said he would
[1:37:19] and he said now brother Brad said I've
[1:37:21] introduced you to him
[1:37:22] I must decrease he must increase so
[1:37:25] where was he increasing in the bride
[1:37:28] they became one they are becoming one
[1:37:32] he's pouring himself into her and they
[1:37:34] are becoming one for the wedding supper
[1:37:37] she has the same Spirit he's God
[1:37:42] amen and that Spirit became word
[1:37:46] so we've already heard from our
[1:37:47] theophany haven't we
[1:37:52] because the because the the very listen
[1:37:56] you say well Brother David I believe I'm
[1:37:58] walking with God I do too I'm walking
[1:38:00] with God then you realize that your
[1:38:01] headship
[1:38:03] is a kingdom because the prophet said
[1:38:05] now we see the head and the body uniting
[1:38:08] they have United did you hear him say
[1:38:10] that in Christ the mystery God revealed
[1:38:11] he said the head and body have United
[1:38:14] as one
[1:38:18] amen they're no longer Twain he said
[1:38:21] they are one you've heard me quote that
[1:38:23] here many times they are one
[1:38:27] amen no longer Twain
[1:38:30] then who joined us together
[1:38:34] let no man put asunder
[1:38:39] amen are you with me
[1:38:43] all right I'm running over these things
[1:38:45] I know I'm going to run out of time I've
[1:38:46] got to
[1:38:48] I could take many many quotes showing
[1:38:50] you were the thought of God you are the
[1:38:51] expressed thought of God you are the
[1:38:53] Eternal thought of God and they're real
[1:38:55] and they're existing in his thoughts I
[1:38:57] could quote after quote I've already
[1:38:59] done it here I took a message not long
[1:39:00] ago on the very substance
[1:39:03] of faith that very substance right there
[1:39:05] that's who you are
[1:39:08] amen all right then then we could take
[1:39:12] that out to bypass that but I want there
[1:39:14] are some key things I want to get to so
[1:39:16] I have a little bit of time left
[1:39:18] not that we have any definite time to
[1:39:20] stop I could probably stop at three
[1:39:22] o'clock if I get by the pastor
[1:39:25] I say that smiling brother Paul
[1:39:30] no that's not my that's not my but you
[1:39:33] know it's possible
[1:39:35] I know it's possible that's the danger
[1:39:37] part
[1:39:38] because there's no stop to this
[1:39:42] you could just go on and on and on we
[1:39:44] just have to hit the high points I'm
[1:39:46] expecting you to find out what he said
[1:39:50] right if you don't have an interest in
[1:39:52] doing that then I'm sorry nothing will
[1:39:55] help you yeah
[1:39:57] that's the truth exactly the truth
[1:40:02] amen if you have no longing for him what
[1:40:05] are you in the message for
[1:40:08] if I I can say possibly you just made it
[1:40:10] a religion
[1:40:13] it's not a religion it's the literal
[1:40:15] life of G hent Jesus Christ Sunday
[1:40:21] in human vessels again
[1:40:30] just like
[1:40:31] Adam and Eve came out of Adam only this
[1:40:35] time there's no way to turn that bride
[1:40:37] out of Christ
[1:40:40] amen it's impossible for her to fail
[1:40:43] it's impossible or hard to fall because
[1:40:45] she's predestinated not to do it
[1:40:49] now think of that
[1:40:52] people say I can just live any way I
[1:40:54] want to yes and I challenge you to if
[1:40:56] you're a real believer
[1:40:58] otherwise you're a make-believer because
[1:41:00] I'll tell you right now you're not going
[1:41:01] to live just any way you want to with a
[1:41:03] real believer God will lead you to live
[1:41:05] the way you want to you'll have no
[1:41:07] desire to displease him
[1:41:08] how many preachers could say Amen this
[1:41:10] morning
[1:41:12] that's right it's a truth
[1:41:15] every member of the Bride ought to say
[1:41:17] that
[1:41:18] because they know that's right you have
[1:41:20] no desire to displease him and how
[1:41:22] you're going to please him by faith
[1:41:27] that you ought to be calling on God for
[1:41:29] Revelation more than anything else
[1:41:31] the emphasis is on Revelation amen the
[1:41:34] revelation of the word to you cannot be
[1:41:37] over emphasized the importance of it
[1:41:44] I don't get going I'm not going to get
[1:41:46] going all right
[1:41:47] now so we see the Promise in this day
[1:41:50] and age
[1:41:52] and we're seeing it because he's taken
[1:41:54] the bail off of it
[1:41:58] so what is he taking the veil off
[1:42:01] the mystery that was laying in your soul
[1:42:05] of himself
[1:42:07] he's taken the seals off of it off of
[1:42:10] your life
[1:42:11] and you can see now who you are
[1:42:14] and where you belong where you came from
[1:42:16] where you're going
[1:42:18] I mean excuse me where you came from and
[1:42:20] who you are and where you're going if
[1:42:23] you know where you came from you know
[1:42:25] who you are and if you know who you are
[1:42:28] then you know where you're going
[1:42:31] that's the whole message right there God
[1:42:34] becoming tangible and you know what he
[1:42:36] redeems only his thoughts
[1:42:42] I'll get to that in just a moment here
[1:42:46] so when a man lives by faith and walks
[1:42:48] by faith I mean substance Faith he is
[1:42:50] isolated from the entire world and
[1:42:52] becomes a new creature in Christ now
[1:42:55] you're getting into bride material
[1:42:56] you're getting into rapturing condition
[1:43:02] perfect faith
[1:43:04] that's out of the message perfect faith
[1:43:06] if we lived in a perfect faith of a
[1:43:08] Christian to what we are we'd be a
[1:43:11] Mystic to the world the people wouldn't
[1:43:12] understand you you'd walk in the spirit
[1:43:14] what the spirit said you would do what
[1:43:16] if forbid you would not do
[1:43:19] that's the way it is all believers are
[1:43:21] Mystic they don't understand because
[1:43:23] they live in a world to themselves
[1:43:26] okay themselves that's not selfish
[1:43:29] attitude they live in the world of the
[1:43:31] revealed word what they are
[1:43:34] to themselves
[1:43:37] amen amen amen
[1:43:47] that's the truth I'm not crazy
[1:43:49] it may appear to be
[1:43:52] and I know right where I'm standing and
[1:43:54] I say God keep revealing more the more I
[1:43:57] see of it the more I want
[1:43:59] the more I see it the more I want and
[1:44:01] What's That Drawing me What's That
[1:44:03] Drawing what's that what's that pulling
[1:44:05] what's that thing pulling me it's
[1:44:06] pulling right into that body change I'm
[1:44:08] gonna get so full of that I'm not going
[1:44:10] to appear anymore behind that pulpit
[1:44:13] right and the church may be closed
[1:44:15] before that happens and I maybe go to
[1:44:17] the dust where it happens but don't
[1:44:19] worry about me I'm in my theophany
[1:44:22] I'm not bragging I'm speaking the truth
[1:44:24] this is more than real to me
[1:44:30] more than what I can imagine
[1:44:33] this is a revelation I say Lord help us
[1:44:35] each one you think I'm standing up here
[1:44:37] wanting to condemn people no I'm not I'm
[1:44:39] trying to get the truth to you to set
[1:44:41] you free
[1:44:44] how can you be free unless you have the
[1:44:46] truth
[1:44:47] you shall know the truth and the truth
[1:44:49] shall make you free he who the son he
[1:44:52] who the son sets free
[1:44:54] then if you have the son you have life
[1:44:57] this is the record eternal life and he's
[1:44:59] given that to us therefore he that has
[1:45:01] eternal life has the son
[1:45:07] and the son has made you free
[1:45:12] do you believe that Jesus Christ has
[1:45:14] come down in this day spoken to us to a
[1:45:16] messenger and we're receiving the
[1:45:18] message and becoming one with that
[1:45:19] message
[1:45:21] then it's Jesus Christ among his friends
[1:45:23] not a man it's Jesus Christ Among Us
[1:45:27] veiled behind human skin
[1:45:29] in the form of his bride and more faith
[1:45:32] because this is the act that he would
[1:45:34] manifest himself as bride this is the
[1:45:36] bride act this is the bride age we turn
[1:45:39] the corner yes
[1:45:43] the bride's come out of laodicea she
[1:45:45] come out of dark denominationism this is
[1:45:47] the bride coming of Christ let me say it
[1:45:50] again you say I don't agree with that I
[1:45:52] don't care if you agree with it or not
[1:45:53] I'm going to say it this is the bride
[1:45:55] coming of Christ
[1:45:57] you want to know what he's coming this
[1:45:59] is what he's coming this is his doing
[1:46:01] right here
[1:46:02] this is what is a mystery to the
[1:46:05] majority
[1:46:06] I'm not saying because I know but I say
[1:46:08] to the majority of message followers
[1:46:13] does that make you anything it makes me
[1:46:15] one thing
[1:46:18] it makes me one thing I'm accepted by
[1:46:20] him
[1:46:23] and we are special people
[1:46:25] a special calling I could take you back
[1:46:27] to Deuteronomy and show you you know
[1:46:29] where I'm going
[1:46:30] we are special people
[1:46:33] especially his own bride

[1:47:02] hold in your heart do you rise your
[1:47:04] position bride do you realize your
[1:47:07] position
[1:47:10] do you know a position is not your doing

[1:47:15] has been put
[1:47:20] who put you there
[1:47:25] put someone in a particular position
[1:47:29] particular place do you know the Bible

[1:47:43] the body United with Christ one with
[1:47:45] Christ

[1:48:29] by
[1:48:31] Faith amen
[1:48:35] faith is a lot more real than my carnal
[1:48:38] understanding yes
[1:48:40] because my carnal understanding is not
[1:48:42] substance
[1:48:46] amen his faith is
[1:48:50] the very substance of his thought the

[1:54:12] this day these scriptures are being
[1:54:14] fulfilled this scripture
[1:54:17] what's he receiving you for
[1:54:24] and you comes again and receives you
[1:54:25] unto himself that's not all the Rapture
[1:54:27] we're looking out here this is happening
[1:54:29] right this is what the seals revealed
[1:54:31] was all about this is what the what the
[1:54:34] the picture of himself up there as he
[1:54:36] appeared exactly as he said he would in
[1:54:38] the scriptures in sunset Mountain sunset
[1:54:41] time End of Time end of time brother
[1:54:43] Brad said this is where he makes himself
[1:54:45] known and these Pentecostals trying to
[1:54:47] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:54:49] these other nominals he said don't you
[1:54:51] realize when they did that that was the
[1:54:53] time he come
[1:54:57] he said that most of that before the
[1:55:00] seals
[1:55:07] without the Seven Seals the rest of the
[1:55:09] message wouldn't have made any
[1:55:10] difference
[1:55:13] you ever thought of that
[1:55:15] unless we had the completion of the of
[1:55:17] the word we had we had we had serpent
[1:55:20] seed we had we had godhead right we had
[1:55:23] the baptism right we had eternal
[1:55:25] security we had those things all
[1:55:27] preached but without the opening of
[1:55:29] those Seven Seals you would never
[1:55:31] realize and understand his coming
[1:55:35] right you would miss it yeah
[1:55:40] amen that's exactly right and he's shown
[1:55:42] that sign into heaven brother Brown said
[1:55:44] that sign his picture take the picture
[1:55:46] of him who's ever turned the picture to
[1:55:48] the right do you see him he didn't even
[1:55:50] see that until 1965 almost two and a
[1:55:52] half years later
[1:55:55] think of that then he begins to say it's
[1:55:57] a rising of the Sun
[1:56:00] it's the rising of the sun it's a rising
[1:56:02] of the Sun
[1:56:06] looks like a bride
[1:56:09] but it's him
[1:56:11] but it's him
[1:56:13] who's uniting with
[1:56:16] his bride that's right that's right they
[1:56:18] are becoming one for the wedding supper
[1:56:21] a celebration of a spiritual union
[1:56:30] that what I'm saying to you this morning
[1:56:31] is kicked out at most churches in the
[1:56:33] message
[1:56:37] maybe not most
[1:56:39] a lot of them
[1:56:42] well yes it is the most because
[1:56:45] few there be that find it but it's not
[1:56:48] the message churches anyway
[1:56:50] you ever think of that it's not this
[1:56:52] church in that church
[1:56:53] I'm talking about the word being turned
[1:56:56] out
[1:56:57] it's not the church turning it out
[1:56:59] it's the word it's her she's very few
[1:57:02] and far between
[1:57:06] but they almost lock it out anyway don't
[1:57:07] they
[1:57:09] who's they
[1:57:11] other than bride the public locks it out
[1:57:16] amen is that right
[1:57:19] this isn't a public show this unveiled
[1:57:22] mystery we're talking about is not a
[1:57:23] public show brother Jesus said they
[1:57:26] asked when demanded of him when the
[1:57:28] kingdom should appear he said the
[1:57:29] kingdom of God is within you
[1:57:33] he said he said this and it cometh not
[1:57:35] with observation
[1:57:37] it's a hidden Mystery revealed it's a
[1:57:39] treasure unveiled
[1:57:43] it doesn't come with observation it's
[1:57:45] not public
[1:57:46] it's between me and my bride
[1:57:49] this is called the bride age
[1:57:52] amen this is called
[1:57:55] it's bride time
[1:57:56] bride time
[1:57:59] this is bride time she's to come on the
[1:58:03] scene it took the messages it took the
[1:58:05] seals it took everything the unveiling
[1:58:07] of the outside of the pyramid and the
[1:58:09] inside had to be unlocked
[1:58:12] amen are you with me
[1:58:15] all these things I mean look at what He
[1:58:17] restored look at look at Malachi 4
[1:58:19] restoring everything back so that that
[1:58:21] message of what's on the inside hidden
[1:58:23] could come to manifestation and be
[1:58:25] perfect
[1:58:33] I'll let you study that out a lot to be
[1:58:35] said about that but I'll just back up
[1:58:37] here there is to be a spiritual bride
[1:58:39] she'll be a spiritual seed she's not a
[1:58:41] natural seed she'll be a spiritual bride
[1:58:43] raise up that will be the Royal seed of
[1:58:46] the royal faith of Abraham's royal son
[1:58:48] she is to come on the scene in the last
[1:58:50] days and the time and the place is a
[1:58:52] promise that's given to her
[1:58:54] amen amen amen
[1:58:57] Hallelujah
[1:58:59] amen
[1:59:01] in Daniel 12 9 if you want to turn I'm
[1:59:04] going to close here real quick in Daniel
[1:59:06] 12 9 he said here and he said go thy Way
[1:59:10] Daniel for the words are closed up and
[1:59:12] sealed till the time of the end
[1:59:16] now that ties in right exactly with shut
[1:59:19] the book
[1:59:20] John seal it up don't write
[1:59:23] until the time of the end and the days
[1:59:26] of the seventh angel the mystery would
[1:59:28] be opened
[1:59:31] okay and he said now we see a perfect
[1:59:34] identification this message is
[1:59:36] absolutely correct
[1:59:38] pointing to the sign in the heavens at
[1:59:40] 1963.
[1:59:42] of himself he said this is a perfect
[1:59:44] identification a perfect Vindication
[1:59:47] this message is correct
[1:59:52] is the truth
[1:59:54] I got the quote if you want to read it
[1:59:57] that's exactly what he said all right
[1:59:59] now there's got to be somebody live the
[2:00:02] message
[2:00:04] amen
[2:00:06] amen and one of them one of them I'm so
[2:00:09] glad that I can say I'm one of them
[2:00:15] all right now so in Daniel there we see
[2:00:18] on paragraph 524 of Christ the mystery
[2:00:21] now you see the seals when he was in his
[2:00:24] mediatorial work back there redeeming
[2:00:26] but some now let me say that again so
[2:00:28] you don't miss it we see the seals when
[2:00:30] he was in his mediatorial work back
[2:00:32] there redeeming why was it back there
[2:00:36] he was redeeming wasn't he
[2:00:39] is that right back there he was
[2:00:41] redeeming but he stood as a mediator
[2:00:44] during those Seven Ages is that right
[2:00:46] but a Corner's been turned now watch he
[2:00:49] said when he was in his mediatorial work
[2:00:51] back there redeeming but someday but
[2:00:54] someday he comes forth to get this book
[2:00:57] who took the book
[2:01:03] someday he comes forth to get this book
[2:01:07] that he's redeemed
[2:01:12] brother man said what is the book it's
[2:01:14] the names of those he's redeemed
[2:01:17] all right he said in all that's in that
[2:01:20] book would be him
[2:01:22] for that's the believer the words in the
[2:01:25] book let me read it again for that's the
[2:01:27] believer the words in the book and the
[2:01:29] word is him and all that's in that he
[2:01:32] came forth for this book of redemption
[2:01:34] whose names are written on the book
[2:01:36] before the foundation of the world
[2:01:46] amen hallelujah now
[2:01:50] and he saw he spoke to me and said these
[2:01:53] Seven Seals this is on paragraph 12
[2:01:55] rising of the Sun and so he spoke to me
[2:01:57] and said the Seven Seals will be opened
[2:02:00] the seven Mysteries Sevenfold mystery of
[2:02:03] the Bible that's been closed up since
[2:02:05] the foundation of the world will be
[2:02:08] revealed amen
[2:02:10] amen think of that
[2:02:13] okay
[2:02:15] and we at a humble little group compared
[2:02:18] with all the world we've enjoyed these
[2:02:20] blessings uh hearing these Mysteries and
[2:02:24] he refers to marriage divorce that was a
[2:02:26] total mystery until after the seals were
[2:02:27] open marriage divorce serpency we never
[2:02:31] got the full revelation of serpent seed
[2:02:33] until after the seals were open okay in
[2:02:36] fact a lot of fullness of what was what
[2:02:38] he brought up was little loose ends left
[2:02:42] amen watch and he said now he said and
[2:02:46] these and he completely revealed to us
[2:02:48] has been has been completely revealed to
[2:02:51] us not by man but by God himself that
[2:02:54] opened those seven Mysteries now watch
[2:02:56] what the seven Mysteries were open what
[2:02:59] were their opening for watch what he
[2:03:01] says

[2:03:04] how it was in Christ at the beginning
[2:03:07] and how it would be revealed in this
[2:03:09] last day
[2:03:14] why were the Seven Seals open for you
[2:03:18] to come to your perfect complete
[2:03:21] revelation of where you started who you
[2:03:24] are and where you're going

[2:05:15] has anybody really looked at the picture
[2:05:19] in the way it should be
[2:05:22] you see it's Christ can't the audience
[2:05:24] see that his eyes looking here is
[2:05:26] perfect as it can be it's Christ he

[2:05:32] Christ he said it's Christ
[2:05:36] right don't add to it don't try to take
[2:05:38] and put your own thoughts like some of
[2:05:40] them I know have
[2:05:43] amen
[2:05:45] and make it something like it's just a
[2:05:47] form it's just this they don't realize
[2:05:49] what they're saying

[2:07:32] you lost your head
[2:07:34] no he's just doing what he said he would
[2:07:36] do but he kept it a mystery
[2:07:40] until he made it known to the bride
[2:07:43] who else is going to see it
[2:07:47] as she's becoming more vocal with it all
[2:07:49] the time and that's good
[2:07:51] because they're not afraid to stand up
[2:07:53] here I'm not ashamed to say that
[2:07:56] right you may not see it I pray that you
[2:07:59] will but I know people are
[2:08:02] and I know I have and I know their bride
[2:08:04] is
[2:08:06] amen
[2:08:08] okay
[2:08:10] just a couple more things and I'll close
[2:08:12] he said I've introduced you to him he
[2:08:15] said notice
[2:08:17] he's wearing the white wig of supreme
[2:08:18] deity the judge of all heavens and earth
[2:08:20] can't you see his eyes his note pretty
[2:08:23] descriptive isn't he can't you see his
[2:08:25] eyes his nose his mouth he said it looks
[2:08:27] just like he looked when I met him in
[2:08:29] the same spot right here right here at
[2:08:31] this High School
[2:08:34] there he is
[2:08:36] he said the angel told him like turn it
[2:08:38] to the right
[2:08:39] first it was The Headstone the mystery
[2:08:41] was in that right there what is that
[2:08:43] Unwritten word we'll turn the picture to
[2:08:45] the right who is it
[2:08:48] who are you bride where is this being
[2:08:51] revealed
[2:08:54] where's this mystery unfolding
[2:08:59] where is it do you realize what treasure
[2:09:02] you have
[2:09:05] it's beyond words
[2:09:07] it's beyond explanation
[2:09:10] you can't even fathom it mentally
[2:09:13] but it's real
[2:09:15] and it's more real than any feeling I
[2:09:18] have
[2:09:19] every day it gets more real and more
[2:09:21] real and more real he said Brother David
[2:09:23] where are you heading out of here
[2:09:26] where I'm heading out of here
[2:09:34] then lay in the word
[2:09:36] ask God to reveal it to you
[2:09:39] meet him if you haven't met him yet
[2:09:42] and you have the desire
[2:09:44] you can tell what's in your soul by the
[2:09:47] desire you have
[2:09:49] there
[2:09:51] then God's given you a filter to draw
[2:09:54] through
[2:09:56] then you need to be drawing through it
[2:09:58] and you'll draw life
[2:10:01] that'll manifest Jesus Christ personally
[2:10:03] personally he'll become personalized to
[2:10:06] you we said Brother David I have that
[2:10:08] desire I want that desire
[2:10:11] then let him become personalized
[2:10:14] becomes personalized to you then you and
[2:10:16] he are one
[2:10:19] it's not another person calling to you
[2:10:21] he's calling to you
[2:10:24] he's asking you do you love me
[2:10:27] then believe what I said
[2:10:30] how do you prove your love to him by
[2:10:31] believing what he said right quit adding
[2:10:34] your own ideas quit putting your own
[2:10:35] interpretation to it quit trying to do
[2:10:37] things through your own psychology and
[2:10:39] your mind
[2:10:41] take the word there's only one
[2:10:43] Deliverance of all cares and that's
[2:10:45] through the word
[2:10:47] nothing else there's not a book of
[2:10:49] psychology there's nothing else there's
[2:10:51] only one thing can deliver you of your
[2:10:53] cares and unless you can reach that
[2:10:55] Spirit realm all you want and have all
[2:10:57] kinds of emotion it'll never last
[2:11:00] there's only one thing that can release
[2:11:01] your cares release your burden and
[2:11:04] that's through the bird the bloody word
[2:11:12] I say this have you been identified as a
[2:11:15] our brother said last Sunday
[2:11:18] has his Spirit confirmed you to be his
[2:11:21] seed
[2:11:22] has his Spirit confirmed and recognized
[2:11:25] you to be
[2:11:27] his faith
[2:11:30] it takes that you know it takes a
[2:11:32] circumcision as a sign it takes the
[2:11:35] token don't you downplay the token
[2:11:39] if you don't have the token you're not
[2:11:41] going in a rapture
[2:11:44] that's just all there is to it
[2:11:46] it takes the token
[2:11:48] to show that you've come through the
[2:11:50] blood

[2:12:05] at things the right way you're looking
[2:12:06] at them wrong
[2:12:09] all right just turn the picture he's
[2:12:12] Supreme judge there's none of them but
[2:12:13] him
[2:12:14] and that's a perfect identification a
[2:12:17] Vindication that this message is the
[2:12:19] truth

[2:17:37] have a new body and and death will be
[2:17:39] this death will be swallowed up in
[2:17:41] Victory we already have Victory we are
[2:17:42] his victory
[2:17:44] this is no mystery how this will be
[2:17:45] swallowed up then amen
[2:17:48] this this humanness this carnlness this
[2:17:51] sin can't rise again
[2:17:54] but you'll rise again
[2:17:58] in a body this body will be changed
[2:18:02] so he won the victory in Jesus Christ so
[2:18:04] after the battle are you with me okay
[2:18:07] now listen to what he says I just want
[2:18:09] to make sure we got that point
[2:18:11] think of of you gave you a part of
[2:18:13] himself that's what the seals was about
[2:18:15] all right now now we want to see how he
[2:18:19] gave himself he gave you a spirit that's
[2:18:21] true
[2:18:22] you have a spoonful of him but do you
[2:18:24] realize the Spoonful is no better
[2:18:26] different chemical than the whole ocean
[2:18:30] you can't cut up God's little piece and
[2:18:33] say you got less power and more power
[2:18:34] and less power and more power it's all
[2:18:36] the same power
[2:18:37] it's just in the measure
[2:18:40] amen you're a major I'm a major I can't
[2:18:43] do it without you
[2:18:46] you say you're closing I am
[2:18:49] now we want to see here in type there
[2:18:52] the view of communion
[2:18:55] he communed with his child
[2:18:57] now we see here in type here is in view
[2:19:00] the communion after the battle he gave
[2:19:04] himself because the communion is part of
[2:19:07] Christ
[2:19:09] now watch the deeper meaning of
[2:19:11] communion versus what we take showing
[2:19:15] that communion
[2:19:16] this is what brother Brown's showing you
[2:19:18] here he said the view of communion after
[2:19:21] the battle he gave himself he gave of
[2:19:24] himself because the communion is part of
[2:19:27] Christ how can you commune with him and
[2:19:30] not be a part of him
[2:19:31] right I'll just stop and think about
[2:19:33] that how can you walk with him and not
[2:19:35] commune with him
[2:19:37] there's somebody Walking with God today
[2:19:42] are you one of them
[2:19:44] Walking with God then apply the token
[2:19:51] start applying the token
[2:19:56] where's your headship
[2:19:59] Enoch walked with him he was above him
[2:20:01] he was with him he had Enoch walked with
[2:20:03] him is that right had a real revelation
[2:20:05] of him type of the Bride today
[2:20:07] seventh and Adam
[2:20:10] but you're walking with him with him in
[2:20:12] you
[2:20:13] he said I'll never leave you nor forsake
[2:20:15] you but I'll be with you even in you
[2:20:18] there's the communion do you realize
[2:20:20] there's the community even Enoch had
[2:20:22] communion with him
[2:20:23] but uh on a different level now we have
[2:20:26] communion with him in a full
[2:20:29] different level
[2:20:31] a deeper level
[2:20:35] all right because now this is the corner
[2:20:38] of the whole thing this is the head of
[2:20:40] the whole thing what is it without us
[2:20:42] they can't be made perfect
[2:20:44] all right so
[2:20:46] Christ in you brother Bram said
[2:20:49] Christ the mystery revealed in you would
[2:20:52] make you does make you the complete
[2:20:55] revelation of the whole thing
[2:21:01] the final the Finish
[2:21:04] the song
[2:21:07] what a position bride to see ourselves
[2:21:10] positionally placed in Christ
[2:21:15] amen
[2:21:17] all right
[2:21:19] so after the battle he gave himself
[2:21:22] because the communion is part of Christ
[2:21:24] he gave himself and after the struggle
[2:21:26] is over after you've done got yourself
[2:21:28] whipped out
[2:21:31] after you've got yourself whipped out
[2:21:33] you have to die before you can have a
[2:21:36] birth you have to die to yourself before
[2:21:39] you can have a birth before a
[2:21:40] resurrection which is a new birth you
[2:21:42] have to die to yourself
[2:21:46] to spiritually rise in a birth New Birth
[2:21:51] to spiritually rise as himself you have
[2:21:53] to die to yourself
[2:21:55] and for him to be manifested daily
[2:21:57] you've got to die to yourself
[2:22:01] all right because this man will be much
[2:22:03] alive until it's changed
[2:22:06] but you've conquered him he's a defeated
[2:22:08] enemy
[2:22:10] you see who your enemy is it's not your
[2:22:12] brother's sister
[2:22:14] it's you your own self
[2:22:17] stinking self right
[2:22:20] carnal cell
[2:22:25] but
[2:22:27] greater is he that is in you that is
[2:22:30] conquered
[2:22:31] and promise
[2:22:33] he that raised up Christ shall also
[2:22:35] Quicken your mortal body
[2:22:37] and bring it subject to the word and
[2:22:40] change it one day
[2:22:42] but now while we're here he's going to
[2:22:44] bring it subject to the word
[2:22:46] that shows Christ in you
[2:22:49] because there's only one thing that can
[2:22:50] bring this man under objective
[2:22:52] subjection to the word that's the
[2:22:53] quickening power of the Holy Spirit
[2:22:56] himself
[2:22:58] so everything we do it'll either
[2:23:00] vindicate the word keep with the word
[2:23:02] stay with the word if you've got another
[2:23:04] Spirit speaking to you and voices and it
[2:23:07] don't lay it with the word you've got a
[2:23:08] carnal negative demon spirit
[2:23:15] if what you think you're prophesying and
[2:23:17] thinking you're speaking out
[2:23:19] and it doesn't lay with this word you've
[2:23:22] got a wrong spirit
[2:23:23] speaking to you
[2:23:28] amen
[2:23:30] pretty straight but God will say with
[2:23:32] his word
[2:23:34] always
[2:23:36] all right you can't leave that word
[2:23:40] okay
[2:23:42] because God in his word is one but do
[2:23:43] you get what I'm saying after the
[2:23:45] struggle is over after you've done
[2:23:46] whipped yourself out then I'm closing
[2:23:48] now with this remember he said then is
[2:23:51] when you partake of Christ become part
[2:23:53] of his being
[2:23:56] you get it he said now watch the next
[2:23:59] we're going to take communion next
[2:24:01] Sunday
[2:24:02] listen I'm not bringing this just to be
[2:24:04] bringing it God said you bring this this
[2:24:07] good morning
[2:24:09] and I knew I'd had to close with this
[2:24:11] right in this area he said after this he
[2:24:14] said Jacob wrestled all night and
[2:24:16] wouldn't turn him loose until he blessed
[2:24:18] him
[2:24:20] see a birth is a mess it's not easy
[2:24:25] it's a dying he said that's right he
[2:24:28] said he battled for life and after the
[2:24:31] battle is over God gives you of himself
[2:24:35] that is his true communion
[2:24:42] the little bread and wafer just
[2:24:45] represents it
[2:24:49] when you come up here to take that
[2:24:50] communion
[2:24:52] you're representing to the people
[2:24:55] that you're in Divine communion born of
[2:24:58] his spirit in communion with Christ
[2:25:03] you can take that I got other places you
[2:25:05] could take the same thing brother Brown
[2:25:07] says the same thing and one of them is
[2:25:09] future home
[2:25:11] no one has a right to take it until he'd
[2:25:14] been born again
[2:25:18] amen now that's pretty straight I know
[2:25:21] that's straight but that's the truth
[2:25:25] and I say if Christ is not manifested in
[2:25:27] your life I'm not talking your mistakes
[2:25:29] and failures I'm talking about life here
[2:25:31] I'm talking about the fruit of that life
[2:25:33] if Christ isn't you don't see him
[2:25:35] manifest in your life get right with God
[2:25:41] okay now watch what he says here he said
[2:25:44] the little bread and wafer just
[2:25:45] represents it you shouldn't take it
[2:25:48] unless you've wrestled it out and become
[2:25:51] part of God
[2:25:56] that applies to me that applies to you
[2:25:58] that applies to every person in here
[2:26:01] we might as well get the order right the
[2:26:04] problem today is too many people look at
[2:26:06] the order the church order and Order of
[2:26:08] God in the church as being some
[2:26:09] legalistic something it's not legalistic
[2:26:12] God has an order and he has a way and
[2:26:15] we've got to come under that order
[2:26:17] it's either the head it's either the
[2:26:19] word take his possession as it has
[2:26:21] headship over here over an assembly over
[2:26:23] people or it isn't
[2:26:26] amen
[2:26:29] unveiling of God you want to stand I'm
[2:26:32] closing with this positions you can come
[2:26:35] but I don't want you to miss this
[2:26:37] statement
[2:26:38] unveiling of God this is brother Brandon
[2:26:40] this is what he says I was he said he's
[2:26:43] talking about being identified as a as a
[2:26:46] a citizen U.S everything the U.S is I've
[2:26:49] become everything that Paul Revere did I
[2:26:52] did or George Washington I was
[2:26:53] identified there was identified I was
[2:26:55] identified to be a Christian I have to
[2:26:57] be identified with Christ
[2:26:59] and watch what he says he said I was
[2:27:02] identified with him with him Christ I
[2:27:04] was identified with him
[2:27:06] all that he was I am how can you be all
[2:27:11] he was without having the same Spirit
[2:27:13] and the Same Spirit in you revealed is
[2:27:16] the new birth
[2:27:18] what is the new birth it's Jesus Christ
[2:27:20] who are you that must be born again
[2:27:22] Jesus Christ that is the new birth
[2:27:28] it's not meeting an imagination you meet
[2:27:30] a person don't tell me you won't know it
[2:27:32] can a mother give a birth to a baby and
[2:27:35] not know it
[2:27:38] I'm not saying you could be begotten you
[2:27:40] may be begotten but until there's a
[2:27:42] birth
[2:27:43] you can be begotten of the spirit within
[2:27:45] you
[2:27:46] justification sanctification that'll
[2:27:48] save you
[2:27:49] but it's not enough to put you in the
[2:27:51] bride
[2:27:52] because the bride is the one that's
[2:27:54] going to be born again
[2:27:55] you can be begotten of God brother Brown
[2:27:57] said but still not have a birth
[2:28:02] amen
[2:28:03] [Music]
[2:28:05] amen there are two comings of the Holy
[2:28:07] Spirit brother Brown said there isn't
[2:28:09] one coming and then subsequent to that
[2:28:11] another one go back and search Church
[2:28:13] agency if you said that what he said
[2:28:17] he made it very clear what the new birth
[2:28:18] was
[2:28:21] and we've heard it you need to really
[2:28:23] listen
[2:28:25] all right all that he was
[2:28:29] all that I am
[2:28:31] he says excuse me all that he was listen
[2:28:33] to The Prophet's words now unveiling of
[2:28:35] God
[2:28:37] all that he was
[2:28:39] how can we be unveiling of God and then
[2:28:42] start talking about what we are
[2:28:44] because it's the unveiling of God
[2:28:47] how you hear me listen to me listen to
[2:28:50] her what he said you have a part of the
[2:28:52] unveiling you are a part of that in

[2:29:04] being dead in him we are identified with
[2:29:07] him what he is I am

[2:32:42] to let you go with this scripture God
[2:32:45] just brought my attention I needed to
[2:32:47] read it
[2:32:47] [Music]
[2:32:49] first John 5
[2:32:51] he's I believe 10 verse 10 he that
[2:32:53] believeth on the Son of God hath the
[2:32:55] witness in himself what is the witness
[2:32:57] the Holy Ghost is the witness
[2:32:59] eternal life is the witness
[2:33:01] all right oh
[2:33:06] I hope that's something brother Paul I
[2:33:08] think you've I know I know I've
[2:33:11] I've had some of this too
[2:33:13] you remember something and then you
[2:33:16] think oh man I've got to get that
[2:33:17] because if I don't it's not fulfilled
[2:33:19] complete
[2:33:23] I wanted to go back here to yeah I'll
[2:33:25] get it
[2:33:32] [Music]
[2:33:37] you know what all
[2:33:42] [Music]
[2:33:45] what was what was once in God's Great
[2:33:48] secret great mysterious Secret in his
[2:33:51] mind is
[2:33:53] this is very important is put in the
[2:33:55] hearts of the believer
[2:33:57] [Music]
[2:33:59] there's your hidden treasure
[2:34:02] is put in the hearts of believer that is
[2:34:04] the body of Jesus of Christ what was
[2:34:06] once God's Great Secret in his mind
[2:34:08] before the foundational world is now
[2:34:10] made manifest
[2:34:12] think of it
[2:34:14] the God's great mystery what the Eternal
[2:34:16] God has a mystery has been unfolded in
[2:34:18] Jesus Christ then given right down to
[2:34:20] his bride what was once in God's mind is
[2:34:23] now in the body of Christ
[2:34:26] Jesus making love to the church is bride
[2:34:29] Whispering secrets to her amen
[2:34:35] amen amen I'm trying to find a certain
[2:34:37] place here also just a moment
[2:34:41] oh yes here we are
[2:34:43] I told you I'd come to the evidence and
[2:34:45] I can't leave this until I get you the
[2:34:47] evidence
[2:34:48] of the Holy Ghost in you most perfect
[2:34:50] evidence I can think of brother Branham
[2:34:52] said is love so we got to thinking on
[2:34:55] that and then I thought that sounded
[2:34:57] pretty good so I just held to that if a
[2:34:59] man got love but one day the Lord in a
[2:35:02] vision straightened me out he said the
[2:35:04] evidence of the spirit is those who
[2:35:05] could receive the word
[2:35:07] [Music]
[2:35:09] neither love nor speaking in tongues but
[2:35:12] it's receiving the word
[2:35:15] he that has an ear to hear
[2:35:18] let him receive
[2:35:19] he can build he has the ability to
[2:35:22] receive
[2:35:23] all right
[2:35:24] and then Dr Vale was saying to me that
[2:35:26] is scripturally said because John 14
[2:35:28] said when the Holy Ghost has come he
[2:35:30] will reveal these things to you that
[2:35:33] I've taught you he will show you things
[2:35:35] to come so there is the genuine evidence
[2:35:38] of the Holy Ghost he's never told me
[2:35:41] anything wrong yet it is the evidence of
[2:35:43] the Holy Ghost is he who can believe
[2:35:46] the word you can receive it
[2:35:50] what do you say he would do
[2:35:54] [Music]
[2:35:56] he said in John 14 and verse also 16
[2:35:59] that he would reveal these things that
[2:36:01] I've spoken to you and show you things
[2:36:03] to come
[2:36:05] there is the genuine evidence
[2:36:09] what are you playing
[2:36:11] huh
[2:36:13] now let's sing that song
[2:36:15] commune with me
[2:36:17] [Music]
[2:36:19] okay just a moment
[2:36:21] still didn't get that scripture
[2:36:22] [Music]
[2:36:23] he that believeth on the Son of God hath
[2:36:26] the witness in himself he that believeth
[2:36:28] not God hath made him a liar because he
[2:36:30] believeth not the record that God gave
[2:36:32] of his son and this is the record that
[2:36:35] God hath given to us eternal life
[2:36:37] [Music]
