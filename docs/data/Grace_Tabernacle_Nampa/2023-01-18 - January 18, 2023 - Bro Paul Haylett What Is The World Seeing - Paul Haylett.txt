him more Jesus Jesus how I trust him how I I've brewed them over and over Jesus Jesus [Music] isn't it wonderful to be recipients of that Grace a man to trust him you know we live in a world that one of the greatest challenges as we deal with young people in South Africa one of the greatest challenges that is expressed is the ability to trust and that is in a world we live today Satan has done everything he can to undermine and so there is no respect in the in the world today for any position hardly at all uh and uh it's interesting by God's grace that we have come to a place that truly we could almost make it a theme that we trust in Jesus amen I just this is not quite in line with my thought tonight but in events made clear by prophecy I just couldn't help but share this with you tonight and it would be paragraph 36 events made clear by prophecy brother Branham says this and when you see the church getting worldly it's not talking about the bride now right he's talking about the nominal Church you see the church getting worldly like it was in the days of Sodom see the church world all going into the worship of the God of this evil age seeing that then seeing a little minority group gathered out under inspiration of God in this beautiful maybe I'm reading too much into this but we are the inspiration of God isn't that beautiful to realize is just not a thought you know we've had many thoughts during the day but an inspiration is something that stirs you up and brings a life and I it makes me so happy to realize that we've been brought up under that inspiration so that makes us inspiration of God producing again the life of Jesus Christ by the scriptures that's supposed to happen you know what hour we're living in the Bible foretells by prophecy what day that we're living and what time we're living and what kind of events ought to be taking place it foretells it exactly to the letter and has never missed one age all the time not one time has it ever missed and it won't I say Amen to that for who are predestinated to see it will see it Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that my father has given me will come amen realize that we have been given to him amen because that's what's causing us to come there'll be that part of the plan of God Amen and so given me will come it's the word joining with the word my here again if I sound like I just have a lot of bold proclamations I'm glad tonight I can lift a hand and say I am the word amen it's not our thought it's not an emotion but it is the very life the word of Christ in US amen it can't do nothing else we know that that the day we're living in amen and I'm glad that we are living in this day although I can tell you when you go and do a little travel we had a lovely time in in Arizona lovely time with family grandchildren but my brothers and sisters everywhere you go you just feel like wow how much more of this do we have to put up with every single thing you you just go and it's there before us it's in our face it's in our face it's bold and uh the thing that's so beautiful about it is God said not only have we overcome this age but we have become the witnesses and this evening if I can it might be a little convoluted in my title and my thoughts I hope you don't mind but I want to carry on a little bit along the lines of the Olive Tree as we spoke last Wednesday so let's just stand and go into the reading of the word I'm so sorry our sister sister Jerry told me your name and I need a Hatfield yes God bless you Sister Nita through the Year sister Jerry has always spoke so highly of the whole family and and uh although I don't really know them at all I've met a couple times and that's good we're glad to have you on let's turn our Bibles to Exodus 27. verses 19 through 21 I hope as I approach this I kept saying Lord there's got to be something uh with a little more clarity and you know Paul's like leaping from log to log through the forest and saying surely everyone will follow me and so hopefully you can tonight and uh Exodus 27-19 all the vessels of the Tabernacle and all the service thereof and all the pins thereof and all the pins of the Court shall be of brass and thou shalt command the children of Israel that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light to cause the lamp to burn always in the Tabernacle of the congregation without the veil which is before the testimony Aaron and his son shall order it from evening to morning before the Lord it shall be statute forever unto their Generations on the behalf of the children of Israel let's just take before the Lord Heavenly Father we just come tonight and Lord we just I pray father you just help me Lord to bring Clarity to these thoughts and Lord just ask you to speak to the hearts and the needs of each one that's here and each one that is not just asking father for just that strength that comes from you the moving of our spirit that inspiration that brings life to us Lord and just ask now for the leadership father as we bring this in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated amen we also want to they might I don't know the time difference they might almost be finished but uh brother Berry was going to interview kind of uh something with brother Sergey and so I've been just saying a couple prayers for brother Sergey through the day and and uh just trust as they kind of bring out some of these things that are happening in the Ukraine and however that service would lead we just if it's not finished we just pray God just bring a wonderful presence there amen as we look at this I want to focus here that the children of Israel were commanded to bring the pure oil olive beaten for the light to cause the lamp to burn always now as they were called to bring this my brother and sister there was a purpose that God had for them to bring this that the lamp would shine there at the uh without the veil that it would be there to be a light always shining and that was an Evidence or one of the evidences we might say that God was present with them that light shining was a reassurance to the hearts and souls of Israel that the light that God was present with them and you know they weren't called to just bring any old oil and I hope tonight that you'll just have your thinking your spiritual thinking caps on to kind of catch this as if I stopped to explain all the different connections it would be quite lengthy but they weren't called to bring just any oil feel better oil that had been prepared and my brother and sister I hope you can follow me here in this it is a time and a place that God comes and it's the Holy Spirit falling on us which is a type of the olive oil that oil is there and my brother and sister but there is preparation on our part to bring that and we can come into the world today and say we have the Holy Ghost and a great portion of the religious world the Christian world says we have the Holy Ghost but they're trying to bring just any kind of oil and bring it as an offering for the light to shine and so we realize it's not just any kind of oil it's not an anointing as it was of the Holy Spirit just Upon Our flesh because my brother and sister as I'll go into it a little deeper in just a few minutes it is there my brother and sister that we recognize that this Holy Ghost Fire has to be kept as a clean fire it has to be kept and fed with a a prepared oil it can't just be any old religious presentation and so it is that it has to be prepared for uh making light and my brother and sister it is because the light must continue to burn now we look at this and I hope you can follow me see we are thankful for the light that burns in our life we are thankful for the grace of God the light that is a lamp into our feet we're thankful for every representation that there is but we look at this and realize that for the oil to flow to make it down into the lamp and flow down through the channels it had to be clean enough to not clog up the channel for it to flow freely so the oil that Israel was commanded to bring had to be an oil that was beaten for the light it was a oil that was purified it didn't have all kinds of uh external things floating in it it didn't have all kinds of of other things that were mixed with it but it was had to be prepared in such a way that it would flow and come right down and we're not going into detail tonight uh just want to lay out this thought but it's there that it had to be able to come down and flow in there it didn't need to be a light that had to be babyset as it were do you follow what I mean there and so it's there that this light this oil had to come down that the light would continue to burn always and you know it is there that we're thankful for the light in our day we're thankful for the message of the hour for the holy ghost that has come and been promised to us and is ours as it were now remember no man has ever come to God God has always come to man but we as Sons and Daughters of God must do our part to stay in the presence of the Holy Spirit otherwise we would just say well I was anointed five years ago and that must be good enough we must come every single day pursuing and when I say that it's only the unction of God the holy spirit in us that causes us to pursue the holy spirit so we read the little uh quote there out of out of uh uh events made clear by prophecy that it is the word coming to the word so my brother and sister when you and I are actively seeking the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost in us that is seeking the Holy Ghost and so by God's grace we uh continue to press forward into the mark of the high calling and so we realize that the light that has in our life right now is always shining we don't always feel like it there are little things that we bump up against and we have have to stop we have to apologize we have to make things right in our life we have to consecrate ourselves again and consecrate ourselves in a greater way but my brother and sister I will make this statement tonight the only shortage of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives is man-made God is not stingy he's not going to shorten not what he gives to us there is no supply chain issues with the Holy Ghost and so it is there that the only shortage there is is man-made now if we look at that and recognize that the only shortage is man-made and the devil tries to come and anoint us as though God is not with us my brother and sister realize that's just the devil talking because the only way that the holy spirit is not with us as if we have not made the atmosphere uh correct or the present of God in our life now let's look at this presentation this preparation I mean of the the olive oil and you look at this that they take the olives and they clean all the debris out of it they can and then they start to wash it and uh much of the debris little pieces of leaves and twigs and other things that would be there they start to come to the surface as they wash this away and I hope that you can see and we can type this in tonight real quickly briefly tonight that what happens in our life it starts with our life as it were and God starts to wash us and and the debris starts to be washed away the things start to come and float away and be washed brother Branham talks about it in the spring how this spring uh cleans itself it doesn't clean itself because it stops and throws all the sticks and twigs out it cleans Itself by the spirit amen bubbling up inside flowing washing it away it's not something it can do in and of itself but just the very nature of being a spring is a washing that cleanses us and so we see this preparation of the Olive and we clean out the debris and we wash it and then we take and we grind it into a paste and in grinding it to a paste what we're doing is we're causing and I did not even bother to write the uh names of all these processes and oils and things that are happening there because I didn't want to be that specific tonight but they start to grind it and when the grinding comes it starts to bring out it breaks it down and starts to bring out the oils and so as it is the oils being a ground are being brought out now my brother and sister it after the fact that it's ground it must be stirred because that continues the process of the oils separating from all of the rest of it all of the pits and all of the fiber that is not uh uh beneficial the stirring must be done and and they declare this is more from an older generation now they use giant machines but from an older generation you can add things to this paste to make it stir easier you can add water or you can add other elements to it to make it stir easier and I thought isn't that the way of the world today when it comes to serving God we instead of letting the Holy Spirit stir Our Lives we add little things a little doctrines little Creeds little things behaviors just to make it easy year but God didn't call us because it's easy my brother and sister he called us because we are as I read here we are Gods amen amen amen it sounds so foreign to us right but we are there the very DNA people say well where are you going but we can say Amen to the fact we're the very DNA of Jesus Christ and if that is so then that means we are little gods and it is I have a quote I shared with brother Chris in the back where the prophet of God is talking about how that it was that Adam had Supreme control over the Earth my brother and sister not partial control not control on Alternate days but Supreme control and brother Brown's talking about how he was a little God in control of that and that was there and it was not taken away by God because God decided that Adam wasn't good enough for that it was taken away because of the decision that Adam chose to make and of course we understand that we don't need to go tonight because what hope would we have as Gentiles as bride of of Christ if God had said I'm just going to let Adam and Eve be wiped off my brother and sister there was no protection for the bride for the wife and you know you look at this and we trace it all down through the message and see how it was that Jesus Christ Adam gave his life for Eve or our bridegroom gave his life for us and I am thankful for that it's not just a simple they sinned but my brother and sister God said I have a remedy oh isn't that beautiful we can look at the sin or we can look at the remedy and tonight I'm thankful God's allowed us to focus on the remedy amen so it must be stirred amen have you ever felt that stir stick as it were in your life have you ever felt the tender hand of Jehovah just stirring up our lives what is he doing he's bringing to a place I'll get ahead of myself but he's bringing us to a place of the ultimate because it's not the pits now we use that as a phrase in conversation sometimes oh man this is the pit well it's the truth God is stirring us because he's separating us from the pits amen and so you look at this and how God is there and all of the rest of these things that are not necessary for us to take a rapture God is stirring that bringing a separation and all I can say is this thank you Lord because imagine if left to us we've been taking houses and lands and cars and this and that and our ant we love so much and maybe this person and that person and our best friend we'd be taking them all with us but God's stirring and stirring and stirring and it's bringing a separation and my brother and sister the word of God said come out of her my people and we are being stirred and we are coming out amen that ought to just make our hearts so happy tonight to realize that God is actually doing the work that is going to bring us out from amongst them we would say well I've had to give up so no so much you know not really because you see it was God stirring and bringing that giving us the ability to give it up because the Earthly ability would never give it up so the things that are added to make it easier my brother and sister this is the things and tonight I'm just gonna kind of give you the brief Glimpse the prophet of God said that the church all it can really offer the denominational Church all it can really offer in this day is a lukewarm spirit and tradition that's the best the church can offer today so we see how the word of God is coming and bringing us to a place that literally we would say Lord I only want the pure word don't don't bring any additives in don't make it easier for me don't Lord don't let my flesh be offended let me always say if that's the word Lord then I want the word amen because otherwise all these little ingredients come in and it confuses it and pretty soon we're comfortable sitting in church but we're not comfortable in the presence of God and the truth is my brother and sister God doesn't really care how we feel in church as long as we're comfortable in his presence amen I remember years ago people saying well I don't know if if we can sit that long well my brother and sister if you're on fire you can sit that long hmm yes I was hoping for another amen or two amen but look what's happened this separation there's a final product that comes from all of this but as it cools down this final product this olive oil is it cools down it gets cloudy so how do you take it from being cloudy you warm it up I just look at that and I'm like thank you Lord I don't want a cloudy vision of my Lord and Savior I don't want a cloudy vision of who I am or why I'm here I'm a cloudy vision of God's Vision I want to see it clearly so what's God do he just warms up his bride not lukewarm he brings her to where she's warm enough that all the cloudiness Fades away now different olive oils at different places from different regions they all have a little bit different uh point in which the cloudiness goes away and look at what God does what God has for a message my brother and sister is just the same message all over the world but we don't live as it were in the middle of Tanzania we don't live in the middle of some of these different countries we don't live in Russia or wherever and so how God deals with them will be a little different than how he deals with us but the common denominator is it's olive oil and there's heat involved amen so the Holy Ghost gets us warmed up and our vision quits being cloudy and our vision of Jesus Christ clears up do we recognize who we are in him and when we recognize who we are in him we suddenly realize like Esther that we actually can come boldly to the throne now they have all kinds of stories about Esther and all kinds of stories about Rahab and all of these things but my brother and sister we have a Clarity today that the thing that changed their life was them recognizing who they was amen they tried to tell us in Israel that Rahab was just a food deliverer lady my brother and sister my Bible says harlot so you see how they try to soften this down but I tell you when Rahab saw who she was it started to warm her up and her vision was no longer cloudy and she didn't say I'm Rahab the ex Harlot she was Rahab the daughter of God because her vision had Clarity and she knew exactly who she was Hallelujah and she knew that the blood of Jesus Christ even though they didn't speak of it in that day in that fashion but she knew she had been forgiven and when Solomon wanted to court her to be wife she didn't stand there and say I'm unworthy I'm unworthy I'm unworthy but when he come and come with a vision and expressed his great love to her she said you know what I've been washed I'm clean I am worthy Hallelujah and how the presence of God Has Come Oh how Rahab has come once again and been manifested on the Earth but she recognizes I am not not here to be judged by my previous sins and they have been forgiven and I have Clarity of who I am in Jesus Christ and this little bride is standing up and saying oh make love to me Lord make love to me let your word speak to my heart May the rustle of the trees and the sunrise and sunset all of these things are speaking to this little bride Hallelujah oh my brother and sister all it takes is getting warmed up and it'll change our vision now let's look at this my brother and sister just moving forward what good is the olive oil that we just come to church and try to store up as much Holy Ghost as we can in the storage room at the church let me put it if I could type it to you this way it wouldn't matter if we had every sermon in book form had it all on a cassette tape and had it on I don't know I'm out of touch anymore I'm sliding Saints pray for me my own daughter today was like sorry Dad that you don't live in the 21st century I was so offended it had a CD that was a word I couldn't even think of that terrible you know in thumb drives we could have all of that sitting on our Shelf and be cooling down getting colder and cloudier and I hope I don't offend anyone tonight because I certainly don't mean it this way but the colder I get the bigger problem I have with brother Trevor oh wait don't laugh I'm gonna name you guys next isn't it interesting how there's such an ebb and flow that goes with this but we get on fire and we just realize oh Lord yes I understand I pray for or I lift up or yeah sorry for using your brother Trevor you see oftentimes it's not really this situation but it's how we react to it but I have 1200 books on my bookcase and it's getting cloudier until I see the message as just a religion but I tell you what happens holy ghost ever starts stirring us nice and hard ER than our old flashlights harder than we think is necessary starts to deal with us and we start to warm up a little bit and the cloudiness starts to drift away and then we realize you know what I should be doing you know I talked to an individual he said well they're no longer printing the books I I just I I don't like to use them so much because I don't want them to wear out and in some parts of the world they'll take a message book and split it in half and distribute it amongst themselves because that's all they've got but ours are in pristine condition and our vision of what the message was about is cloudy they have a page or two and their vision is twenty twenty of who they are and what God called them to you see it won't matter how much oil we think we've got stored in the church my brother and sister it's how much oil are we burning we get the idea that storing the oil is what is the purpose but the purpose of Israel being commanded to bring the oil was not to store it but to burn it to let that oil that had been cleaned and beaten and processed and put through trials and struggles that it would flow the whole thing about it my brother and sister if the oil won't flow it can't make it to the Candlestick and will not produce light so the oil was not that we have the best version of the message we are this or that my brother and sister you know it's just interesting you hear different things from different parts of the world and you know there'll be a part of the world over here that say we have the Revelation and the part over here says we have the Revelation but let us just judge it how much fire does that produce and we're not talking about the running and jumping and screaming and falling down and kicking around that people say well that's the evidence we're on fire my brother and sister if that was the case the Pentecostals would put us to shame it's a life that light is shining and that light is giving life to you and I and so to do that we must be burning the Holy Ghost and I've likened it many times from this Pulpit that the Holy Ghost to a son or daughter of God is as gasoline is to a car and none of us would expect to drive to Chicago from here without stopping and filling up our car and none of us should expect that we can go through our daily life without needing a filling and a refilling and a refilling and a refilling because we should be burning the oil we should be living out our lives and let that become the expression of Who We Are the relationship between the oil and the Candlestick is an intrinsic connection so we look at the oil olive oil being a representation of the Holy Ghost as we all know the prophet makes that type in fact the Christian world makes that type amen it was not meant for us to let it get stale right amen not meant for us to let it get stale and that means my brother and sister if we are actively seeking the Holy Ghost every single day but we are not burning it I hope you're following me in context it we're not burning it what would happen we'd have no place to go with the Holy Ghost we'd quit seeking it so people say we've got it in abundance we don't need any more but my brother and sister they say that olive oil when it is rancid and we all know this from the olive oil we cook with even when it sits around too long in the presence of too much oxygen which is the world that it gets rancid and it leaves a bitter aftertaste it taints the taste of whatever you are tasting it whether you cooked food in it or you were one of those that drinks a little cup full for your Health's sake you look at this how was the Holy Ghost meant to be expressed in our lives if God intended for us to Express the Holy Ghost just by saying I have the Holy Ghost if that's what he wanted us to do my brother and sister then you would never be able to separate the tear from the wheat because everybody would just say I have the Holy Ghost so there is a very tangible result of the presence of the Holy Ghost in our life very tangible in the world we live in today olive oil has become a worldwide commodity and the scripture says that the word would go to every Nation Kindred and tongue see how beautiful this type is that it just carries out now the use here in the Templar Tabernacle was not to just claim that we have olive oil the people bringing the oil they don't bring it and the priest doesn't say thank you we now have ten thousand gallons but they every single day had a commandment to let the light shine every single day it had to be burning and it was given as a statute forever to their Generations in other words it wasn't a commandment to be given for a single time a single event or a single period of time but it was a statute unto the generations and so it was there my brother and sister as it has been for years we see there's great things happening in the world today we're seeing God move in ways that we don't understand we're finding the gospel in ways that we can't even even understand the connections the message is an example is making it into the heart of countries like Iran but yet no one really knows exactly it wasn't like brother so and so went there and gave him a book or gave him a tape these people are in the middle of nowhere in the world that they are in uh we won't focus on that and somehow the message comes to them wow how lucky they are my brother and sister that's not luck that's prophecy fulfilled that as it were if you'll follow me is the olive oil going through a land that has all kinds of prophecies concerning it and a lot of them are not good and that olive oil is making it through that land and filling the crews of their lamp look at that how can that be because it will and as I don't know maybe we might be able to use past tense I don't know um Every Nation kindred and down and that oil my brother and sister is the same pure oil that is lighting or fueling our lamp it's not a nether oil not another version not a substitute it doesn't have to be added to or taken away from it doesn't have to be diluted down or anything just the pure word of God striking a soul in a land where you can be killed for being a Christian and they be they they be man my English tonight has just fell down amen and they are standing up confessing I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God I'm the seed I'm predestinated I am the word amen you talk about the power of the olive oil you talk about the power of the type that God placed in his word to show us the moving of the holy spirit will not be held by boundaries or limitations or governments or people in control but God moves in such a supernatural fashion that the word comes I always like to remember the little story of a sister down in Chile and she had some neighbors there and then their kind of poor neighborhood or whatever and in Chile they had put their trash up about a level about like this so the dogs because there's like a zillion dogs in Chile I mean if you guys are dog lovers and you need a pet you could go to Chile and adopt probably a whole Plane full they're everywhere but their their trash is up high to keep the dogs out and and so the houses they share a pole that has the receptacle on each side and she noticed these really really new looking books in Spanish kind of hanging out of the trash and so she went and pulled two or three books I don't remember now exactly pulled pulled a couple books we'll say out and she took him in the house and and uh she's like oh this is interesting it's religious material and she's reading it and so she sits down and she reads the whole thing and something gets lit oh what did it take just a little olive oil something gets lit and so she become the most regular trash watcher that you have ever seen and every week or two she would see out of the trash some new white or whatever you know little booklet and she would go out there and pull them out and her fire got burning so bright she walks over to the neighbor one day and knocks on the door and the young man comes to the door and she's got a whole handful of message books and she's like how could you take something so precious as this put it in the trash and he was like well that's what I was raised and I don't believe that anymore but my mother keeps sending me olive oil keeps sending me these books and I don't believe that and neither does my wife and the woman told him just give them to me don't throw them in the trash just give them to me something started stirring her heart she found a church she got baptized she's just on fire got oil running everywhere and she's on fire and she just had a burden she said now how would it be that this young man could not believe this she was saying how could it not be it's the opposite of the spirit in most of the world this is how can you believe this she was on fire and she's saying how can you not believe this and she decided my job is to shine as bright as I can and she befriended this couple had a little baby and over time she becomes such friends with them she would even babysit the little child and she just started working on them and one day the young man says why you're just like a mother to me and she was like it's working it's working and she loved them right back into the message now I'm telling you my brother and sister when the olive oil starts flowing there's a flame that goes with it we're not here to just pour it on the floor and slip around in it we're here to light it on fire and watch it burn and God provides the oil and he keeps the lamp burning right this was oil that was meant to be burning always not on Sunday not on Wednesday night not when we felt good always in the good times and in the bad in the struggles that we have at all times this oil was there meant to be burning oh Hallelujah amen you see it's not as I said meant to sit and get stale but it was meant to be expressed in our lives it was meant to have an impact on us and as the oil is Flowing down into the lamp my brother and sister it was there expressing itself in this dark world we say well I'm trying to be a witness to my neighbor to my co-worker to this my brother and sister what you've got to do is make sure there's nothing clogging up the channel there's nothing you don't want the little lamp setting they're sputtering and putting off a little puff of smoke you want it to burn clean that's why no impurities that's why God wants to wash that out God is working stirring getting that out because it has to be without impurity because half of the reason young people I just was reading this it's a little bit dated back a few years maybe like five six years but a survey done by a religious sir kind of survey group or that's not what you call them but anyway half the reason that a lot of college age young people are rejecting Christianity as they said they say this and do this they preach this and live this oh let the oil be cleaned let the oil flow let the candle shine bright that there would not be something that is sputtering putting off some soot which is darkness which is black which is ugly which is dirty Let It Burn clean Hallelujah let it not just be a statement but let it be expressed in this Dark World look at the world as I started off to share with you you can't get on a plane you can't fly you can't go to an airport you can't go down the street can't go into a store you can't walk down the sidewalk go to a park you can't do anything my brother and sister but what there's Darkness around us and I'm telling you I want you to look maybe you already do but I want you to look at this different it isn't uh something like a duty that we should do it is Who We Are amen we are that Candlestick that was meant to be filled with pure oil and come down and be lived out and Shining always Hallelujah you see it's not a statement that we make it's what we are it's who we are it's what our expression is and look at this as I already got ahead of myself we can look at this in the natural and the spiritual that light produces Heat you can take even a common light bulb in the day we live in just put your hand in front of it there's heat where there's light there's heat now imagine my brother and sister if the thing that we need how do I say this we need clarity we need a Clear Vision in this day and God says here you're Desiring a Clear Vision Lord I want to look on your face I want to see what you have I want to be who you want me to be God turns up the heat oh my brother and sister there's times he's turned up the heat in our lives and we're like Lord that's the last thing I need and he's like no no it is what you need because when all of the obscurity goes away all the cloudiness goes away and we see that Vision not our vision his vision we see that vision I I'm just going to ask you you don't have to shake amen say nothing but I'm just going to speak from my heart how it is when the heat turns up my vision gets clearer my troubles are less troubling because it's no longer me trying to overcome oh we've been made more than Overcomers aren't I a great guy I'm such a good message believer I am an overcomer just turn the heat down a little bit and see how far we get but when the heat's turned up we're like Lord thank you for what you're doing to me a man most miserable a man that shouldn't even have the pleasure of knowing you as a lord and savior and my vision of you Lord and then we just find ourselves walking right past things that used to detour us things that used to trouble us the things well I I don't like this happen and I don't like that happen yeah get your vision amen get your vision ask the Lord to turn the heat up amen huh you know my brother and sister this all comes back and I won't go into the full detail of this but how many of us pray for patience yes we should be we should be for one as the bride of Christ God's going to give you the test for patience whether you want to take it or not you know my son is moving forward to become a a contractor it once it has a desire to move into that and the test is very very difficult it's a book about that thick it's open book but it's kind of like the code that the law is it's got you know chapter 12 uh sub Part B uh sub paragraph 6.122.24 find it he's taken the test twice they they won't opt you out they just don't allow you to come back in a day or two it's like as in weeks before you can come back he's taken the test twice the second time he's passing the test but he ran out of time so he got all these questions correct but he run out of time now I want you there's a reason I'm bringing this up we see the transition in it before you run out of time plus missed a lot of questions but now he studied and he's getting it right but he's run out of time and the foolish virgin ran out of time and oil in a sense you could say oil you see what happened was there was too many distractions now my son offered up to me says Dad I figured out it's really hard to study a test like that and work 12 hours a day but you see my brother and sister God said I don't care what your life here and your struggles here are if you will be patient you will stand and you will allow it I will fill you full of the oil that you need to shine in this day and you won't even have to do it yourself you just have to yield and allow yourself to be filled and I I just you know I wanted to preach to my son pray for my my son I talk to him a little bit to you know and my we could just bring him to church and set him down right here and you wouldn't even know he wasn't a believer because he knows it but he's not passing the test Lord help him I want to see my family saved I want to see my son daughter-in-law grandchildren saved but they got to come to a place I don't know how God will do it and it's a struggle you know to to Simply say you know what Lord whatever it takes it's hard to utter that Lord whatever it takes to get my children's attention Let It Be Lord that Not only would it get their attention but in the process it's going to have to get ours too because we sometimes would make it well there was this troubles and there was those troubles and they got discouraged my brother and sister pray for their soul not their emotions amen not their success pray for their soul now look at this light produces Heat and Fire is self-purifying so wherever the presence of the oil is that's burning is purifying my isn't that beautiful I hope this is all making sense in Exodus 35 maybe like for homework you could just go ahead and read that and you'll find my brother and sister that the guidelines that God laid out for the Candlestick to be made were in such a way that the they were very precise and Not only was the making of the Candlestick very precise but the placement of the Candlestick was very precise and we certainly don't have time enough tonight to go through that but I'm telling you my brother and sister every Candlestick had to be placed in such a way that the oil would run into it freely oh my brother and sister it can't be placed in a stadium somewhere it can't be placed at some kind of this or kind of that it's got to be in a place where the oil can run into it freely and so in they set up the Tabernacle everything had to be placed in such a fashion and I'm here to tell you my brother and sister we are not here to do a service to God without his will we are here to come into a perfect place of worship as Sons and Daughters of God boldly to walk in and say I know this is where God has placed me as a Son of God as a daughter of God and I'm going to stand right here and let the oil flow oh they say you could be successful you could get a promotion you need to just do this you need to do that you need to go to the club with the guys you need to go to the golf course to get that promotion stand where you're at and God will come along and give the promotion if you're supposed to have the promotion but you've got to be placed perfectly in the right place that the oil will flow or the Candlestick will start to sputter and soon go out and no man would say I'm going to get up today like Aiken he did not get up that morning and say I think today I'll just destroy my family but what happened he had quit feeding now as an Israelite as a Jew he had other things other other a little you know if you understand I'm kind of struggling to put it to words he was called to different guidelines than we were that I can assure you if God would allow us to go back we'll find that he had turned all of that just as Israel is today into tradition in other words had no emotion come brought his lamb brought his turtle dove I just have to do this there you go nothing changed no fire was lit no burning in his soul to say you know what I want to do this for the Lord I'm afraid that spirit's Not Dead I'm afraid that that spirit is still hanging around and if we're not careful we come to church because our family comes to church but I say Lord help us that we come to church because there's a fire burning and we're like I'm going to get a refilling tonight I don't care how much brother Paul stumbles and the reason I'm stumbling Saints if you don't understand I'm trying to preach three sermons to you and do it within a reasonable time here and I'm struggling at it but it's uh nope brother Paul can stumble spit stutter all he wants I'm going to get filled tonight I'm gonna refilling I'm gonna walk out of here once again still on fire for God and I'm not worried about running out of oil there's an endless supply no man can stop it no supply chain can stop it the devil can't stop it amen and even sometimes our own flesh can't stop it hallelujah amen oh Hallelujah but the outpouring of the Holy Ghost must be a natural outpouring my brother and sister we need to be real careful that we don't Embrace an outpouring that's actually an emotional outpouring not to say we need to be dead oh I saw him lift two feet I saw him do this I saw him kind of do a little oh he's out of control no no no come on it's got to be some life but my brother and sister we don't need to try and imitate it it needs to be a natural outpouring of the holy spirit in our life and when it's out uh natural outpouring we'll see that it will you know Mr critic sitting over here in the corner of the church well they're sure getting carried away I need to find some scripture and I've got my Cod book two I'm gonna just see where they're wrong and after a while he stops and says I I can't find why because it's a natural outpouring not a man-made emotional outpouring it'll fit to the guidelines we'll still be holy we'll still be righteous we'll still look like Christians in this outpouring amen now look I'm going to close here real quick I don't believe you can have the Holy Ghost without revelation did I say that correct or did I say it backwards you can't have true revelation without the Holy Ghost there it is see no matter what position oh did I tell you guys we're the bride did I did I remember to mention that tonight that we're the Bride of Jesus Christ and did I did I remember to mention to you that the word says you can't be lost and I don't remember I meant to remind you that there is not a single sin imputed to you and my last that I wanted to remind you did you remember that he said he said not us he said this work I have begun in you I will finish now we wonder what are we worrying about what do we get troubled about what do we have the devil you know sitting on the windowsill like a woodpecker listen to me Sorry Devil I'm on fire and my vision has cleared up and I can look with clarity and I recognize everything that brother Paul just said is what wasn't brother Paul it was the word and the prophet of God said it's the word coming to the word what a position I can stand here you can stand here tonight I am the word of God manifest on the flesh today and I'm just going to go ahead and be a plagiarist where down there went to church with brother Ron evening night Tabernacle and brother Ron was talking about preaching uh on uh God in morphe and he brings this all down Through the Ages God and morphe changing his mouth changing his mask and he comes down in here God comes down and no wonder people thought brother Branham was Jesus Christ because it was God in the prophet and it so was so powerful and so clear and so beautiful and it was there and as brother Ron said himself and I would reiterate because that's where I stand nothing against brother Branham but even beyond the prophet of God God went one more step in morphe and he come down and he's dwelling in flesh again oh that is not us my brother and sister that was God who chose to come down and in more faith put a mask on that happens to look just like you oh my how precious how beautiful how glorious that is that God would want to be uh with us so much that he come right down and resident in us now my brother and sister if it's God in us amen spiritual DNA if it's God in us how can that be defeated it cannot be will we have our bumps we'll have our problems we'll have our struggles but God didn't say well I guess I picked the wrong one to him morphe amen I picked the wrong one to put myself into I'll go find one that's a little stronger one a little smarter one a little whatever no my brother and sister he looked at us through eternity and told us it's finished already just live it out you're a part of the play oh Hallelujah amen hey man I'll just move on real quick little homework if you would Matthew 5 14 to 17. my if I go really really fast we can do this ye are the light of the world a city that is set on an Hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick it giveth lighten to all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works oh well we have some works here amen everybody that's like no no it's all Grace it's all Grace we have no Works my Bible says that they will see your good works in other words you're going to be a Christian in the grocery store in the workplace it's a city park you're going to be a Christian wherever you're at it ain't that we're going to be out there saying I'm a Christian and I did this we will just be living our light will just be shining we won't need a billboard to say there's a light hmm although unless I sound contradictory I'm going to read this quote real quick bear with me Saints let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets I am not come to destroy but to fulfill oh look at it he just chose us he chose us as a point as brother Brown talks about that with Oral Roberts I believe it was a point of contact that's what we are walking around the oil is pouring in amen and we are lit up for Jesus Christ we become a point of contact Lord I ask you just help us Lord to be a better light now let your lights so shine before men amen let's just go through this real quick you know I don't know the definition of the word quick but we will try so I believe that the Christian is God's billboard I believe that each one of us is God's billboard and we don't have to do so much carrying on about it as we do just simply live such a life that'll make the people hungry to be like you amen I tell you what speaking of carrying on brings back a memory from years ago I worked with a man named Larry I think sister Jerry even met the guy the best finished Carpenter I've ever worked well or new or whatever in life the man was just absolutely phenomenal I'm working on a house one day I was not in the best position you might say in my life just kind of struggling to seem like I always had some little besetting thing that just was bothering me and and I'm working on a house one day and he comes up and he says you're a Christian aren't you now I hadn't done anything you know played Christian music I didn't actually listen to music on the job I'd done anything but he just walks up you're Christian aren't you now God ordained this as a lesson for Paul he says you're a Christian aren't you and I was working in a closet on baseboard and uh prepping it to paint it and I looked up at him and I said I'm trying to be and here's a guy I didn't even know got right in my face God don't have no such thing as trying you either are or you aren't and like who are you but I couldn't get over that it actually was a little key that unlocked something for me because I was just trying I was trying but I was locked into my own mentality that I'm trying and somewhere in that mentality was a deal that you're defeated you can't do it I'm trying but oh Larry he drove that right out of me every time I'd see him man he was always like still trying oh shut up but it caused me to have a different approach huh just simply live such a life that'll make people hungry to be like you now if you guys want to read a very interesting stuff you probably already had but you go further up in this let your light so shine before man brother Brown's talking about a billboard that's where it all starts a billboard I noticed this billboard this certain one it didn't claim it ain't nothing just ask the question if you're hungry and you cannot sell anybody anything to eat unless they're hungry and the first thing that the advertisement does the individual passing by has to see it now the only way that the world will ever see Christ is when he they see it in you and me oh Lord I want to be a billboard I want to be a billboard help me Lord see you in you and me and that's the only way they'll ever see Christ they're conscious go ahead and click that for the Gideon their conscience are numb to the sunsets to the call of the birds to the leaves the grass the flowers the music and the message and so forth that we enjoy after we have found Christ Can someone say Amen to that there's no better view than to look at the world today and know that this this beautiful the most beautiful things Sister Sarah sorry to use you for an example but not really so Sister Sarah you know in her hike she takes some pictures of just these gorgeous Mountain Lakes now can you imagine when this has been burnt over and it's back to the pristine of God's creation everything we've ever looked at will be just that much more beautiful without any form reminds me a friend of mine Dura hunt out in a really rough part of Idaho Sawtooth deals up there hunting a goat and he sat down he was so into telling me about it that he he was demonstrative and he sat down he said and I had my hands behind my head and I'm just looking out through this just beautiful beautiful Canyon and he said at that moment I didn't care if I hunted a goat or not I was just enjoying the absolute beauty of this he said man I am probably sitting in a place that no man has ever walked and his heart just thrilled in him he's out there singing How Great Thou Art and he goes to put his pack on and he steps out and he turns around to grab his pack and he said I don't know why I didn't see it before but there was a crushed Coca-Cola can and he said my whole feeling of euphoria just went no man's ever been here yeah but imagine what it'll be When We Get Over Yonder how beautiful how glorious it will be amen the message that we enjoy after we found Christ until we get to a place that we display Christ now remember that each one of you from tonight on remember you are God's Billboards and your God's advertising agent wow we have a business Arrangement here and those of us that are a little business-minded that gives me a new challenge to press forward amen I I got to get this billboard good I mean I don't want a billboard that you drive by on the highway and you can't read it because part of the Billboard's flapping in the Wind everybody just yeah no I I'm gonna be I'm going to be a billboard and now the world will look at you and see what Christ is so we don't want to smear a big lot of stuff on there that'll testify about things that we really are not let's first be that then when we be that then the world will see Christ in you and me Amen brother Alex will you come Hallelujah Saints I don't know I kind of cut this all up tonight I trust that you was able to connect it back together amen Lord pour the oil pour the oil Lord but let's make sure there's some flame there okay that we're just not talking oh I've had the Holy Ghost since this I've had this I've had that no let the people be able to look and say I see something burning I see a flame I see a light I see a life Hallelujah amen amen amen oh I don't know I I tried singing this song earlier let's stand and I I think we can do this the spirit of the Living God amen God bless you brother Tim good to see you in the house of God tonight Spirit of the Living God fall fresh on me amen that is a thought that just struck me it's like Lord I need that I need that to fall fresh I don't want old stale oil I don't want to be just given as they say giving God what's left over of our time foreign you know when you when you stay busy too busy too much time you can form a habit of giving what's left of your time to family or left of your time to God left of your time and the devil natural life career it's the prime time Satan's pretty slippery and I'll just admit to you Saints it's been a battle I have fought for years and years and years now I say there's something special about sitting on a ditch bank and a pickup reading your Bible but how much more pressure it would be that I didn't have to squeeze that into my life that it was just time I give that's my prayer I believe that's where the Lord is taking me we're moving that direction but it's been too long coming and I apologize to you and certainly repent to the Lord but you see God's not going to let us as the bride of Christ show up with no oil amen he's guaranteeing he said I've already made it you will have oil but his way of giving us the oil translates into sacrifice on our part Lord let me be willing let me be willing to sacrifice let me be willing oh spear read of the Living God fall fresh on me oh spirit all the Living God forever [Music] [Music] oh break Me O mail me no more me and fear to me o spirit of the Living God fall fresh on me let's sing it again oh spirit all the Living God fall fresh on me foreign [Music] fill me tear it all the Living God [Music] cause I want God's way to be my way as I Journey here below for there is no other Highway that a child of God should know [Music] though if he leads me tears enough I want God's way to be my way every day Hallelujah Hallelujah so we'd be dismissed on this song here just a little reminder I love this song The Name Of The Lord it's a strong tower amen imagine you're in the middle of your work day the devil's coming it's tormenting you and you just stop and say Lord I need you to come on the scene and suddenly you can hear in the Supernatural the blocks the rocks being placed [Music] and the prophet of God said now you can't stop that bird from flying over but you can stop him from building the nest and we're inside that Strong Tower and the rocks are being put in place and we turn our thoughts what our problem is and we start to say Thank You Lord thank you Lord you are my strong tower you are my refuge You Are My Strength you are my provider and suddenly those thoughts that troubled us not just stirred up are you with me they got stirred up and then they got washed away flushed right out and what was left pure olive oil and that pure olive oil started flowing and 15 minutes later you'll find yourself oh thank you Lord for saving my soul and Satan's over there saying I'll get him next time but I'll tell you what God's doing since he's training us that next time we'll have even more confidence and we won't wait quite so long to say Lord I need you to come amen the name of the Lord is a strong tower [Music] or righteous run into and they are saved a name of the Lord is a strong tower all the righteous run into and they are saved oh blessed be the name of the Lord oh blessed be the name of the Lord oh blessed be the name of the Lord most high oh blessed be the name of the Lord I shall be the name of the Lord oh blessed be the name of the Lord my now let's personalize it in the name of my Lord is oh my strong tower and I run into and I am safe the name of my Lord is oh my strong tower I run into and I am saved oh blessed be the name of my Lord oh blessed be the name of my Lord oh blessed be the name [Music] of oh blessed be the name
