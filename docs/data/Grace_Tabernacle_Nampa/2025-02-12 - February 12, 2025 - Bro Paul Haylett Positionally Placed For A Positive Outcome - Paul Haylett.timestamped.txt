[28:25] first off before I forget I'm I I bring
[28:28] a lovely hello greeting and God bless
[28:32] you from Brother uh pant and sister aona
[28:36] and we actually got to sleep in your
[28:37] guys's
[28:39] bedroom that uh I assume it's yours has
[28:41] your picture in there and uh so but we
[28:45] had just such a lovely time a little
[28:46] short visit but they were very thankful
[28:49] just a little encouragement to them and
[28:52] and uh they thank you for your prayers
[28:55] for your constant reminder before the
[28:57] Lord
[28:58] and uh uh they get a little Lonesome
[29:01] down there and uh there's several things
[29:04] we won't announce over the pulpit but
[29:06] even things back home sister conscious
[29:09] uh family and some different things that
[29:12] are there that weigh heavy upon them and
[29:14] obviously some change in the government
[29:17] and their point of view here uh in the
[29:19] United States that weighs very heavy
[29:21] upon them and so God bless you and um
[29:25] normally we don't give greeting
[29:28] on on things like birthdays but I just
[29:31] have to say Brother David uh sings how
[29:33] you are the Elder of our church uh yes
[29:38] yes yes that's a good Revelation to have
[29:42] anyway it's wonderful we appreciate you
[29:45] I have to just say that we sat there and
[29:48] streamed this service on Sunday and um
[29:52] really enjoyed it all four of us just
[29:55] sitting there we really really enjoyed
[29:57] that service let's turn I want to speak
[30:00] to you um God bless you thank you
[30:02] musicians amen always leaves me feeling
[30:07] good amen the Lord's blessed us with
[30:10] with these musicians and song leaders
[30:13] and each well each and every one of you
[30:16] amen um I just want to speak on being
[30:19] positionally placed for a positive
[30:21] outcome and a big title for actually a
[30:24] simple thought amen but sometimes you
[30:27] got to you know kind of
[30:29] Pizazz it up a little bit but I think we
[30:31] could all agree as we look at the word
[30:34] right now just to grab a quote so to
[30:37] speak out of thin air the prophet of God
[30:39] said when we see who we are is that not
[30:43] us seeing our positional Place amen he
[30:47] says when you see who you are the
[30:50] bride you'll become
[30:55] and oh yeah say that louder someone
[30:58] Invincible who's
[31:00] Invincible amen we might not feel like
[31:03] it all the time but come on the prophet
[31:05] said when we see who we are we become an
[31:08] invincible Army that is being
[31:12] positionally placed amen the Army
[31:15] doesn't all fight to be in the
[31:18] cafeteria amen that's not the weapon of
[31:20] their Warfare amen they're not all you
[31:23] know just but everyone's got to be in
[31:26] their proper position amen Jeremiah 29
[31:30] 11-13 very simple scripture tonight and
[31:34] uh I want to just draw this out we all
[31:38] uh would recognize uh Jeremiah
[31:41] 29 as it is that God placing this before
[31:46] us to remind us that we are positionally
[31:51] placed now we can be positionally placed
[31:54] in our
[31:55] flesh and we can be positionally placed
[31:58] you might say
[32:00] spiritually but we are
[32:03] also directly positionally placed in
[32:07] Christ and so to me it should eliminate
[32:11] a lot of our battle that's exactly but
[32:14] it actually increases the battle because
[32:16] Satan says wait when they get in their
[32:19] position I can no longer control
[32:22] them and you know every nician type
[32:26] spirit is about control right that is
[32:30] what the nician spirit is and the Holy
[32:33] Spirit is dealing with the lamb and a
[32:39] dove and you can say yes the Holy Spirit
[32:41] controls us but I think we're all
[32:44] tonight understanding of the difference
[32:47] of the kind of control that a nician
[32:50] spirit has and what the Holy Spirit has
[32:54] the holy spirit is wooing you and I into
[32:57] the the presence of the Lord a nickan
[33:00] type spirit is actually demanding that
[33:04] you do it in a certain fashion whether
[33:07] it's right with the word or not it's
[33:09] trying to cause it to happen in a
[33:12] certain way Jeremiah
[33:14] 2911 for I know the thoughts that I
[33:17] think toward you saith the Lord thoughts
[33:20] of peace and not of evil to give you an
[33:23] expected end then shall ye call upon me
[33:27] and you shall go and pray unto me and I
[33:30] will hearken unto you and ye shall seek
[33:33] me and find me when ye shall search for
[33:36] me with all your heart every one of
[33:40] those shs is a oh I forget you know I
[33:44] read this stuff and then I can't I I'm
[33:46] this won't be quite right but just bear
[33:48] with me is a subtle type of
[33:50] command you
[33:52] shall so it's not
[33:55] directive but it is a command that
[33:59] causes us to react and so he says here
[34:03] uh that uh when you when you uh come to
[34:07] this place then you shall call upon me
[34:10] amen has that command influenced your
[34:14] life amen we call upon him we're calling
[34:17] on him and and you shall go and pray
[34:20] unto me here again a commands he that is
[34:23] not a dictative type command it's
[34:26] something in our heart compelling
[34:29] and I will hearken unto you and ye shall
[34:31] seek me I say this scripture even though
[34:35] it's here in Jeremiah is just as real
[34:38] today with the bride of Christ as it was
[34:41] the day when the Prophet Jeremiah spoke
[34:44] it and I say thank you Lord Heavenly
[34:47] Father we just ask you tonight just come
[34:49] be with us lead us guide us in this
[34:51] thought let us speak your word according
[34:53] to your word Lord bless all the saints
[34:56] and all the needs Lord L and each and
[34:58] every one father in the precious name of
[35:01] Jesus Christ we press forward Amen to
[35:04] the mark of the High Calling knowing
[35:06] Lord that you have called us to that
[35:09] position thank you Lord ask for your
[35:11] blessings tonight in the name of Jesus
[35:13] Christ amen you may be
[35:16] seated you know as I look at that I I
[35:19] see this scripture in in my mind as not
[35:22] just these verses right here but as the
[35:25] whole Jeremiah 29 when we read that
[35:28] it it's a wonderful scripture to me it's
[35:30] just uh really vibrant it's authorative
[35:33] do you like it when the word is
[35:35] authorative amen I I like that I I don't
[35:38] I don't want uh I'm glad that the the
[35:41] the gospel is not a well if you feel
[35:43] like this or you feel like that but God
[35:45] says you know what you shall seek me
[35:48] amen and we read that and there's
[35:50] something in US responds to that and
[35:53] says yes Lord I'm going to seek you and
[35:56] so it's very authorative and yet at the
[35:58] same time you might say well
[36:00] authoritative uh you know such such a
[36:02] way but look how it's encouraging my
[36:05] brother and sister the word of God no
[36:07] matter you know in the times that it's
[36:09] corrective it's still encouraging if we
[36:13] ever view the word as as so corrective
[36:15] that we cannot find joy in the Lord
[36:18] something's wrong something's out of
[36:20] kelter because even when the Lord
[36:22] corrects us there is an encouragement
[36:25] that comes with the word and you know
[36:27] being the bride of Christ now just not
[36:29] some average person out here uh my
[36:32] brother and sister we we are the Bride
[36:34] of Jesus Christ can we say Amen to that
[36:36] tonight and we should identify with that
[36:39] it should not be a cliche it should be
[36:42] an identity and so as we do this we find
[36:46] that the word Even in our most difficult
[36:49] times when we're down in the valley and
[36:51] everything seems to not be going right
[36:53] and the devil's there whispering in our
[36:56] ear you know trying to convince us that
[36:59] that see you've finally come to the end
[37:01] of the road this is only as far as
[37:03] you're going to go but then the Lord
[37:06] comes and even if it's through
[37:08] corrective word it's an encouraging word
[37:11] that reminds us this is who I am and I
[37:14] can no more I I was going to include
[37:17] this tonight but I I didn't want to drag
[37:19] it out too far but you know the prophet
[37:21] of God I do have a little reference to
[37:23] it but the prophet of God's talking
[37:25] about Who We Are
[37:29] we cannot make ourselves something else
[37:34] that's right we we just have to stop and
[37:37] identify this is who I am in good days
[37:41] in bad days when things have just gone
[37:43] completely wrong and I'm so discouraged
[37:46] and might even voice the words I've
[37:48] never felt so low in my life but yet my
[37:51] brother and sister we'll we'll touch on
[37:54] this in just a little bit God already
[37:56] knew that low was there amen and so as
[38:00] we come to these places in our life God
[38:03] is saying I need you to come and
[38:06] identify this place in other words you
[38:08] know sometimes when you travel a little
[38:11] bit you know uh uh you know uh suddenly
[38:13] on your phone or something it'll be a
[38:15] little pinpoint and a little um oh I
[38:18] forget what they call a little flag or
[38:19] whatever that is and and you know
[38:21] suddenly it shows up oh
[38:23] London I've been to London yes that's
[38:26] right I've been to London
[38:28] God says look I want to show you right
[38:31] now you've been in Heavenly places amen
[38:34] it's not marking a London of our life or
[38:37] a you know Amsterdam of our life he's
[38:40] saying you've been in Heavenly places
[38:42] you actually know what Heavenly places
[38:45] are like and he reminds us then as we
[38:49] start to remember and God's healed us
[38:51] and he's delivered us and he he's
[38:53] answered prayers and and the devil's
[38:55] there saying I need to keep you down in
[38:57] the pit and God just speaking to us and
[39:00] reminding I'm your healer and we say yes
[39:02] I've been healed I'm your deliverer yes
[39:05] I've been delivered and you can't stay
[39:07] down in that if we uh uh uh some things
[39:13] you know that we will probably announce
[39:16] this Sunday but uh my brother and sister
[39:20] just a reference to to
[39:22] emus as they were walking along I'll put
[39:25] it in Paul's words okay not exactly the
[39:28] scripture Jesus steps out now how did he
[39:30] just step out on
[39:35] them Supernatural stepped right into
[39:38] that and was right there and they could
[39:40] touch him they could see him they wanted
[39:42] to offer him food they wanted all of
[39:43] this but he's walking with
[39:46] them and he says uh
[39:50] Brethren what kind of conversation is
[39:55] this that you are so
[40:00] sad W if I could just tell
[40:03] you we thought he was the Messiah we
[40:06] thought he was to deliver we thought
[40:08] this and this oh you fools and slow of
[40:15] heart
[40:17] ouch a little correction right there he
[40:20] called them fools and slow of
[40:22] heart but they didn't say well I don't
[40:25] know who you are but go walk on your own
[40:28] there was something that compelled them
[40:30] to hear and I and I know the scripture
[40:32] says that we're not to call men fools
[40:34] and I don't I don't like to be called
[40:36] one and I don't want to call people
[40:37] fools but my brother and sister if the
[40:40] Lord Jesus would come and speak to me
[40:42] tonight I don't know about you but if he
[40:43] would come and speak to me tonight I
[40:46] would say Lord you can call me a fool
[40:48] and slow of uh you know of heart here
[40:51] and and because it's Jesus and he knew
[40:56] what they need needed to hear another
[40:59] man walking up calling him a fool might
[41:01] have just upset them but there's
[41:03] anointing there amen and you know
[41:06] sometimes we we are definitely slow of
[41:08] heart and uh we look at this now the
[41:11] word as I go back here authorative
[41:15] encouraging but the word's also final
[41:18] the word brings a finality to our lives
[41:21] that we recognize you know this is who I
[41:24] am and and I want to uh I want to walk
[41:28] with the Lord amen it's not a matter
[41:30] just listening to the prophet today and
[41:33] my brother and sister you can say you
[41:35] have faith we can talk about faith I can
[41:39] this and I can that and I but my brother
[41:41] and sister Faith is something tangible
[41:45] amen faith has substance to it and as we
[41:49] look at this we realize there has to be
[41:52] something in us now we can't go get a
[41:54] bucket full of Faith it's not how it
[41:57] works but the prophet of God says you
[41:59] know what it's in
[42:01] you faith is in you and so as we'll see
[42:06] that we're walking along here and we
[42:09] realize you know what I I I I have faith
[42:12] amen I I'm I'm going to just you know as
[42:15] it were be bold tonight I have faith in
[42:18] fact I have all the faith I need to make
[42:20] the Rapture what I got to do is get me
[42:23] out of the way and let the word come and
[42:26] as the word comes my faith is
[42:28] increasing but then every once in a
[42:30] while the devil gets us to volunteer to
[42:32] put our s back in our own
[42:35] way and then we become Our Own Worst
[42:37] Enemy and our faith declines as our
[42:41] fears and anxieties
[42:43] rise and so it's a very simple equation
[42:47] that Satan has figured out so apt that I
[42:49] can just come and cause or toss the
[42:52] cares of this life in your way my way
[42:56] toss it out front of these people and
[42:58] it's going to hinder their faith I don't
[43:00] even have to I don't even have to you
[43:03] know do these devilish
[43:06] things I'll just let them trip their own
[43:09] self but what he doesn't realize is the
[43:12] word of God has already declared that we
[43:15] are positionally placed amen so as we
[43:18] look at this and realize more and more
[43:20] it's not about what we claim we are it's
[43:23] about what God said we are cuz we can
[43:26] claim a lot lot of things but when God
[43:28] said it amen he never fails amen so you
[43:32] know we look at this now it's whether
[43:35] we're in the uh very center of the road
[43:38] or whether we are On The Fringe uh as it
[43:42] were the um prodical
[43:46] son we're more naturally attracted to
[43:49] the man who's never
[43:51] wavered stood solid all the days of his
[43:55] life in church faithful all the
[43:57] Commandments in other words we would
[43:59] have loved the Rich Young Ruler just
[44:02] like Jesus
[44:05] did but the prodical
[44:08] son once he found his position was just
[44:12] as
[44:14] valuable actually more
[44:17] so because one relied on his own
[44:21] Revelation and
[44:23] one well looked like he was a wreck yeah
[44:27] but he
[44:29] wasn't positionally Place imagine
[44:32] tonight we don't want to justify these
[44:34] things but it's it's really interesting
[44:36] when you look at this just very focused
[44:39] that um the prodical son was
[44:42] positionally placed for a
[44:46] season in a pig
[44:48] pin now we'd have a hard time saying
[44:51] praise God my son is in a pig
[44:54] pin no we don't see it that way way but
[44:58] God said you know I'm going to the song
[45:00] was good tonight cuz it just fit right
[45:02] in more of you he's down there in the
[45:05] pig
[45:07] pin let's just call it what it is he's a
[45:10] backslid message
[45:13] boy in a pig
[45:18] pin positionally placed in other words
[45:22] there was no other place for him to be
[45:24] at that time
[45:27] my that should actually give us a little
[45:30] bit of a of a happy understanding that
[45:34] sometimes you know little things happen
[45:36] in our lives and we say Lord why why did
[45:39] this why did I do this why did I think
[45:41] this or what action and this and that
[45:43] but to remember God's perfect we're not
[45:46] and god is perfect so if he positionally
[45:48] places you in the midst of a certain
[45:51] circumstance don't be moaning crying and
[45:54] whatever how horrible life is is I'm
[45:57] down in the valley and it's just so
[45:59] terrible down here maybe we ought to
[46:01] lift our hands up and say you know what
[46:03] all I see is a bunch of stinking seaweed
[46:06] and but you know what let's see I'm
[46:07] going to orient myself somehow and I'm
[46:10] going to pray to Jerusalem I'm going to
[46:13] pray that God would be here there's got
[46:15] to be something good come out of this I
[46:17] am not going to die in the belly of a
[46:21] whale and it turns out that was God's
[46:23] plan the whole time to place him right
[46:25] there we look at as a backslid preacher
[46:28] who wouldn't do what God told him to do
[46:30] but God knew he wouldn't do that and God
[46:33] said why I know the nature of humanity
[46:36] will not follow my word the first time
[46:38] every time so I just make the way for
[46:41] him to come that my will be done and the
[46:46] prophet brings that out so happily over
[46:48] and over again in the message showing us
[46:50] amen that no matter what we stumble and
[46:53] fumble and all about that we'll find
[46:55] that in the end we fill exactly what God
[46:58] called us to do and I say tonight my
[47:01] brother and sister we're called to be
[47:04] the bride of Christ Eternal
[47:07] Witnesses amen not temporal Witnesses
[47:10] Eternal
[47:12] Witnesses called to witness in this
[47:17] generation we sometimes don't think that
[47:19] our light shines very good but the
[47:20] darker it gets the more the light shines
[47:23] so even a little light will shine a long
[47:25] ways
[47:27] reminds me of a story years ago about a
[47:29] man he he um he crashed a little
[47:32] airplane he had a little experimental
[47:34] plane and I don't know he's down in the
[47:36] edge of California Nevada down there and
[47:39] and was just flying when I say crashed I
[47:42] I don't know the little something
[47:43] happened he has to set the plane down
[47:45] and it won't fly again and uh but he
[47:48] sees a light in the
[47:50] distance and he says well I'm saved all
[47:53] I have to do is walk to the light turned
[47:57] out that light was 80 miles
[48:01] away that's how much a little light
[48:03] that's right will shine in the darkness
[48:06] amen that's what we're positionally
[48:08] placed for we don't have to go out and
[48:10] say I need to be a super Christian and
[48:12] convince convince everyone just let my
[48:16] light shine Lord right amen and let
[48:19] there be more of
[48:23] you so this prodical son did he not have
[48:27] an expected end yes sir God knew
[48:31] exactly and what's sad about that story
[48:34] is a son who is there faithful the whole
[48:36] time instead of rejoicing got angry that
[48:40] that person got delivered right it seems
[48:43] hard it's hard to comprehend why would
[48:45] he be angry that his brother got
[48:47] delivered yeah but you see sometimes
[48:51] selfish
[48:52] Spirits they tend to work their way in
[48:55] and we tend to feel like wait pardon
[48:59] me but I'm more spiritual than you
[49:03] sister Carrie so that's why they make
[49:05] the platform taller so I can look down
[49:08] on
[49:11] you you see how Spirits are people will
[49:15] create their own
[49:17] platform so they can spiritually look
[49:20] down on someone else that's right and
[49:24] yet God said the expected end is ex
[49:26] exactly the same amen Lord help us Lord
[49:31] help us Amen in fact the scripture says
[49:34] we should prefer our brother that means
[49:36] in essence for this example we look up
[49:38] to them and lift them
[49:40] up that's great and so you look at that
[49:43] we realize what God's doing he is
[49:46] positionally placing us everyone no
[49:48] matter what we're going through today
[49:50] we're positionally placed amen for a
[49:54] positive
[49:55] outcome so as we could go back to the
[49:58] scripture and read it again but God has
[50:00] said I know my thoughts is't that
[50:03] wonderful I'm glad that my thoughts amen
[50:06] are subject to God's thoughts and not
[50:09] the other way around and I'm glad that
[50:12] my thoughts being subject to God's
[50:14] thoughts doesn't mean that you're
[50:16] subject to my thoughts because we'd have
[50:19] a real problem
[50:21] here amen so we have this expected end
[50:24] but look how Satan comes
[50:27] he he comes along and says if if you
[50:30] don't mind can I share a little
[50:32] something with you I'd like to join this
[50:37] conversation I actually can I borrow
[50:41] your
[50:42] notebook I
[50:44] actually have a little list here of some
[50:47] of your
[50:49] faults and um if you need I could turn
[50:54] here to this page and and share this one
[50:57] from um oh 10 months 3 weeks and 2 days
[51:13] ago I thought I had
[51:15] faith I thought I was an
[51:18] overcomer I
[51:20] thought remember greatest battle ever
[51:23] fought yeah amen that battle amen as I
[51:27] used for an example is finished it's
[51:29] done it's gone we can't change it and
[51:32] neither can the devil but the Lord Jesus
[51:35] already did amen so we look at this and
[51:39] Satan's still trying to put us back in a
[51:41] position that God has run us and I'm
[51:44] going to just speak in this Essence to
[51:46] my own life we have become sick and
[51:49] tired of being sick and tired of a
[51:51] position that we were in and God allowed
[51:54] that we get to the place like oh oh you
[51:56] know um I I don't know about this you
[51:59] know iniquity it just eats me up you
[52:02] know God's right there behind it saying
[52:04] yep just let the iniquity move let it
[52:06] flow amen amen just let iniquity roll
[52:10] through your life and then one day you
[52:12] wake up and say I'm done yeah I am done
[52:15] I'm tired of dealing with this Lord I
[52:18] need deliverance and I need it now and
[52:21] the prophet of God said God moves when
[52:23] we get desperate amen and so we come to
[52:26] places in our life and what is God doing
[52:28] he's positionally placing Us in the
[52:32] devil's mind we are not perfect in our
[52:34] own mind we are not perfect but we
[52:37] should have come in the position where
[52:39] our soul knows that we are perfect
[52:42] because he is perfect amen that we are
[52:45] righteous because he is righteous and
[52:47] that's the only way my brother and
[52:49] sister we will ever be perfect only way
[52:51] we'll ever be righteous is because we'll
[52:54] look to him and he is the word from the
[52:57] beginning and when he said that you're
[53:00] perfect in me then we need to say I'm in
[53:03] the right position I'm in the position
[53:05] that I can now say Lord you said I never
[53:09] did it in the first place and I don't
[53:12] desire to do it
[53:14] again but you might that's right but God
[53:17] says it's about the
[53:19] desire so we get in the right position
[53:22] that God puts us Works us into and we
[53:25] stand in that position
[53:27] and he is strong when we are weak
[53:31] hallelujah amen and no other place no
[53:33] other time he's not going to be strong
[53:35] when you're strong only time you'll be
[53:38] strong is when you're completely in him
[53:41] and then he can shine forth so we look
[53:45] at this now see Satan wants us to see
[53:48] his way I'm sad to say there's been a
[53:51] lot of times I sat down with the devil
[53:53] oh and I read the book
[53:57] yes but then God comes and says what are
[54:00] you
[54:01] reading you're on the road to emus what
[54:04] are you talking about and why are you
[54:07] sad
[54:10] amen they share the
[54:13] story what did it do it took a faithful
[54:17] loving God to First rebuke them and then
[54:22] start pouring into them that's right
[54:25] that when it all come down and they
[54:27] recognized him they ran back to the city
[54:29] that's right why they were then
[54:32] positionally placed the Revelation that
[54:35] they'd had before of what Jesus was
[54:38] going to do for them was a man anointed
[54:42] Revelation it was not what God wanted
[54:45] them to see he wasn't coming as the kind
[54:47] of Mighty conqueror that they
[54:49] interpreted to be but he came as a
[54:51] mighty conqueror he came as the
[54:54] Conqueror and they interpreted that in a
[54:56] fleshly mind way and said oh great
[54:59] they're going to kick everybody out of
[55:01] the country it's going to be ours again
[55:03] but God was there and finally showed
[55:06] these men I have come I have fulfilled
[55:08] it I've done the word now it's your
[55:14] turn have you ever done something in
[55:17] life maybe went hiking with
[55:20] friends somebody scrambles up some Rocky
[55:23] Trail
[55:26] and you actually
[55:28] realize I'm not really
[55:31] capable of scrambling up
[55:34] that you know I hand coordination ey
[55:38] foot
[55:39] coordination amen we're joking
[55:43] about doing exercise a little bit
[55:47] and realize you know what people can
[55:51] do um I'm sorry I just struggle to lift
[55:55] this body off the
[55:59] ground it's just what it is and you see
[56:03] some people with two fingers over a
[56:08] bar and I'm over there going can they
[56:10] lower the
[56:13] bar I'd rather try to push it up than
[56:15] pull it
[56:16] down you see we're not in their position
[56:21] that's right but they're not in our
[56:24] position that's right and and physical
[56:27] strength will not get you in a Rapture
[56:28] but spiritual conditioning will train us
[56:33] hone Us in to where we actually can take
[56:36] the word and accomplish exactly what God
[56:38] wants done with the word
[56:42] amen now Romans 8:1
[56:46] 14-19 for as many as are uh as are led
[56:50] by the spirit of God they are the sons
[56:52] of God now to me that is so beautiful
[56:55] because it gives a very
[56:57] definitive very clearcut line that when
[57:00] we are led by the spirit of God that can
[57:03] only be so because we are sons of God so
[57:08] God doesn't allow now now uh please bear
[57:11] with me when I say this God does not
[57:15] allow
[57:17] imitation there are
[57:20] imitators but it's not nothing to do
[57:22] with God that is that is Satan trying to
[57:25] trying to catch the eye of the people
[57:27] but God in the midst of a holy ghost
[57:30] atmosphere will not allow imitation you
[57:34] say but brother Paul the imitation there
[57:36] but
[57:37] remember the classes of
[57:40] people a Son of God daughter of God God
[57:44] does not let them imitate the
[57:48] word he will and now for a simple
[57:51] example he will send you on the road to
[57:53] emus
[57:56] and he'll straighten you
[57:59] out has he done
[58:02] it he's faithful isn't he and we should
[58:06] tonight be saying Thank You Lord that
[58:08] we've had a road to emus and you called
[58:11] us slow of heart and foolish and and you
[58:14] dealt directly with us but we now have
[58:17] Revelation that we have understanding to
[58:19] see what the plan of God is and we can
[58:22] step into that
[58:24] plan we don't have to imitate it any
[58:27] longer we occupy it it's who we are it's
[58:32] what God has brought us to be not in
[58:35] transitional
[58:37] form now you could say a sinner being
[58:40] saved a drunk being saved becoming
[58:43] faithful Son of God is
[58:46] Transitional but my brother and sister
[58:48] it's not really it's Revelation that's
[58:51] right what was already in him is slowly
[58:54] being revealed
[58:56] transitional is when something becomes
[59:00] intellectual and the more intellectual
[59:02] we become the greater the picture is and
[59:04] we transition into a picture but that
[59:07] picture painted fire won't do anything
[59:09] for us so as the painter painted the
[59:12] painted fire there might have been
[59:14] inspiration behind that but it didn't
[59:17] even hardly warm up the painter maybe
[59:19] other than his physical brush
[59:21] stroke the next man comes it won't do a
[59:24] thing for him but when you get a real
[59:27] positionally placed Son of God he
[59:29] changes the atmosphere of where he is at
[59:34] if we'll stand for what we believe not
[59:36] back down not cower but just stand for
[59:39] what we believe we change the atmosphere
[59:43] of where we're
[59:45] at amen see we've not received a spirit
[59:49] of
[59:50] bondage uh to fear but we've re received
[59:54] the spirit of adoption whereby we cry
[59:57] ABA father now my brother and sisters so
[59:59] much difference between a servant of the
[1:00:01] house and the
[1:00:03] son amen when we come to the place that
[1:00:06] we can cry ABA father my father my
[1:00:08] father my brother and sister they we
[1:00:11] don't need a priest to get us there we
[1:00:13] don't need an anointed preacher to get
[1:00:15] us there now the anointed minister is
[1:00:18] all part of God's plan but amen we have
[1:00:21] our positionally
[1:00:24] placed place or position this is this is
[1:00:27] where I'm supposed to be God's going to
[1:00:30] feed you he promised I'm never leave you
[1:00:32] I'll never forsake you I've never left
[1:00:35] my children begging bread amen so coming
[1:00:38] spiritually we come to this place that
[1:00:41] we've receive the spirit of adoption
[1:00:44] let's not adoption become just a
[1:00:46] Doctrine a subject we talk about don't
[1:00:49] let it just become a a cliche word that
[1:00:52] we put out there we become adopted my
[1:00:55] brother and sister let's be adopted not
[1:00:58] just talk about adoption but be adopted
[1:01:01] whereby we cry ABA father and the spirit
[1:01:04] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[1:01:07] that we are the children of God now see
[1:01:09] I like the wording of it the spirit
[1:01:10] itself beareth witness with our SP
[1:01:14] Spirit what if it
[1:01:18] didn't would we just be fools and slow
[1:01:20] of
[1:01:21] heart or maybe it never
[1:01:24] would but this scripture is telling you
[1:01:29] this is God this evening Saints this is
[1:01:31] God talking to you this is not Paul
[1:01:34] talking to you this is God talking to
[1:01:36] you and he's telling you that his Spirit
[1:01:38] Bears witness with your spirit amen that
[1:01:42] we are the children of God and if
[1:01:44] children then we're heirs Heirs of God
[1:01:46] joint heirs with Christ it so be that we
[1:01:49] suffer with him that we may also
[1:01:51] glorified together for I reckon that the
[1:01:54] sufferings
[1:01:59] the
[1:02:00] sufferings that's right
[1:02:04] absolutely yes
[1:02:07] sir of this present time that's today
[1:02:10] that's Wednesday night at whatever time
[1:02:12] this might be here of this present time
[1:02:16] are not even worthy to be compared to
[1:02:19] the glory which shall be revealed in
[1:02:23] us and when the this bride recognizes
[1:02:28] who she is that's right then she stops
[1:02:33] and says praise God the wheels fell off
[1:02:36] the wagon I'm a Son of God a daughter of
[1:02:39] God Amen might even be as far as the
[1:02:42] house burnt down it doesn't matter I'm a
[1:02:45] Son of God I'm a daughter of God lost my
[1:02:48] job it doesn't matter I'm a Son of God
[1:02:51] I'm a daughter of God Amen because
[1:02:55] there's nothing we can suffer that's
[1:02:56] greater than the suffering that brought
[1:02:58] us
[1:03:00] here for the earnest expectation of the
[1:03:03] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[1:03:05] of the sons of God so you look at that
[1:03:09] my brother and sister and realize now
[1:03:11] now maybe Excuse
[1:03:17] Me Maybe I'm looking a little Prejudice
[1:03:19] because I've been studying it along this
[1:03:21] line but my brother and sister when I
[1:03:23] look at this I see uh someone
[1:03:27] LED he's positionally placed if he's
[1:03:30] being led he's been positionally placed
[1:03:32] and and when they receive you have to be
[1:03:35] in the right place to receive and
[1:03:38] everything down through here is about us
[1:03:41] being positionally placed and when we're
[1:03:43] positionally placed God comes on the
[1:03:45] scene and honors his word and it changes
[1:03:48] our life He blesses us and so as you
[1:03:51] look at this we realize that every bit
[1:03:53] of this is all about us being
[1:03:56] positionally placed now I simplify this
[1:03:59] because it's much deeper than this but
[1:04:01] my brother and sister when we catch the
[1:04:03] whole revelation of being positionally
[1:04:05] placed all the rest of the gospel and
[1:04:07] the message Falls right in place it will
[1:04:10] just it'll just just come and lay itself
[1:04:12] right out before us as long as we're
[1:04:14] fighting against the placing that's
[1:04:18] right then we cannot receive the
[1:04:20] blessing so God's wanting us to realize
[1:04:24] that people are I I'm praying that God
[1:04:25] would bless us we need a blessing in our
[1:04:27] household in our family in our finances
[1:04:29] in our health and and that but we're not
[1:04:32] positionally placed and God says oh I'm
[1:04:34] not a spoiled father I'm sorry I'm not
[1:04:36] going to bless you until you get in your
[1:04:38] correct
[1:04:40] place it's kind of like parents you know
[1:04:43] their kid won't eat his supper and they
[1:04:45] say well no dessert cuz you didn't eat
[1:04:46] your supper but 30 minutes later the boy
[1:04:49] sitting at the table eating
[1:04:51] dessert you're never going to place that
[1:04:54] child
[1:04:55] ever he's going to realize I can just do
[1:04:57] what I want to do and my parents will
[1:05:00] give in I'm sorry our our
[1:05:02] father is not going to give in he's not
[1:05:05] going to turn us into spoiled
[1:05:09] children we have to be under leadership
[1:05:13] headship and without being under
[1:05:15] headship remember the prophet of God
[1:05:17] just listening the last few days
[1:05:19] different tapes brother brandom is
[1:05:20] talking about that and he's there and
[1:05:22] he's talking about the Holy Spirit
[1:05:24] moving and people people that would not
[1:05:26] receive it it just moved right on they
[1:05:29] needed healing brother Brown says you
[1:05:31] you have gallbladder problem you you
[1:05:33] need but they're not believing the Holy
[1:05:35] Spirit just moves
[1:05:37] on imagine they hurt
[1:05:43] themselves let me focus and drill on
[1:05:45] that for just a
[1:05:46] moment when we get a stubborn
[1:05:50] Spirit who are we hurting right
[1:05:56] right no one but
[1:06:01] ourself now the collateral damage might
[1:06:03] be a wife and children or a husband and
[1:06:05] children or just children or just wife
[1:06:09] or husband but what we're really
[1:06:13] hurting is our
[1:06:15] s because I can pick a fight with the
[1:06:18] wife I've done that a couple times I
[1:06:20] actually am quite
[1:06:21] experienced
[1:06:23] um at the end of the day
[1:06:26] I get her upset but who did I
[1:06:32] hurt I hurt
[1:06:36] her but I really actually hurt myself
[1:06:39] yeah the
[1:06:40] most because then when I get Com when I
[1:06:44] want Comfort I get
[1:06:51] chaos my brother and sister I hope that
[1:06:53] made sense
[1:06:56] so as we look at this we go down we
[1:06:59] receive the spirit of adoption we become
[1:07:02] Heirs of God joined airs with Christ we
[1:07:05] suffer with him we will be glorified
[1:07:07] with him so the sufferings of this
[1:07:10] present time are not even worthy to be
[1:07:13] put on the same
[1:07:16] page for an Earnest expectation of the
[1:07:19] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[1:07:22] of the sons of
[1:07:24] God see what it's doing there's a lot of
[1:07:26] the word my brother and sister let me
[1:07:28] just kind of nutshell this CU it's
[1:07:30] pretty big topic but there's a lot of
[1:07:32] the word that's not really open alive
[1:07:34] and effective to us because we've not
[1:07:36] allowed ourselves to come to spiritual
[1:07:39] maturity yeah and God's not going to
[1:07:42] give us Authority without
[1:07:46] maturity and so when we want to see the
[1:07:49] word really open to us then we should be
[1:07:52] laying in the presence of the son get
[1:07:56] mature and as long as we choose to
[1:07:58] remain
[1:08:00] immature then the seed will not
[1:08:03] reproduce
[1:08:06] itself let me hurry up and go on
[1:08:10] here in the
[1:08:15] Paradox and if you notice these Hebrew
[1:08:19] mothers let me just preface this with a
[1:08:22] little bit what I want to bring out of
[1:08:24] this is is what I would call uh
[1:08:29] principle I'm not really so much focused
[1:08:31] on the Hebrew mothers it's the principle
[1:08:34] of what they're doing those Hebrew
[1:08:36] mothers when they was in labor and gave
[1:08:38] birth to those Patriarchs I'll get on
[1:08:41] that one of these days the Lord willing
[1:08:43] gave birth to those Patriarchs when she
[1:08:45] spoke their name in labor she also
[1:08:49] positionally place them in their place
[1:08:52] in the Kingdom oh my inspiration is a
[1:08:56] paradox see you you just can't catch it
[1:08:59] but it's inspired and God moves it right
[1:09:01] along into its place just at the hour
[1:09:03] when you think not and I want to tell
[1:09:06] you my brother and sister from the
[1:09:07] foundation of the world Amen before
[1:09:10] there was one Speck of Stardust amen now
[1:09:13] we look at this and and please bear with
[1:09:15] me I I just want to lay this out in a
[1:09:17] fashion that is kind of natural to us
[1:09:20] when God was speaking a amen the heavens
[1:09:23] into position he was giving
[1:09:26] birth he was giving birth to all of this
[1:09:29] and and when you go listen to birth
[1:09:31] pains you'll realize God was actually
[1:09:35] experiencing a pain as it were as he's
[1:09:38] speaking these things into existence
[1:09:41] it's coming out of him what was in him
[1:09:43] contained in him is now coming out of
[1:09:46] him like a natural birth coming out and
[1:09:49] and there is and it's not just like oh
[1:09:52] let there be a Milky Way oh let there be
[1:09:55] but God was like I want this I need this
[1:09:59] I want to I want to have my children my
[1:10:01] bride needs a a earth to live on she
[1:10:04] needs all of these things and they're
[1:10:06] being birthed out of him are you with me
[1:10:09] amen and so there it was he's there and
[1:10:12] there not a speck of Stardust out here
[1:10:16] and he birthed your name into the Lamb's
[1:10:19] Book of Life no simple thing my brother
[1:10:22] and sister the lamb had to die to put
[1:10:25] put our name in the book and he birthed
[1:10:28] it but you realize also in that birthing
[1:10:32] when he spoke your name and to the
[1:10:34] Lamb's Book of Life he positionally
[1:10:36] placed you and I and he chose you and I
[1:10:39] to be right here on this Earth at this
[1:10:42] time in a time of wars and rumors of
[1:10:44] wars a time of insanity a time of people
[1:10:48] double-minded a time of I I don't need
[1:10:51] to go through all of that a time though
[1:10:53] and God said I birth you
[1:10:56] amen right into this
[1:11:00] day and we think we go through pain but
[1:11:03] we've read this scripture that says his
[1:11:06] suffering we're not even our suffering
[1:11:08] is not even worthy to be
[1:11:10] compared so he births us into
[1:11:14] leoda and he says in
[1:11:17] leoda this son this daughter they shall
[1:11:21] experience this you see positionally
[1:11:23] placed wasn't just being throwed into Le
[1:11:25] O deia my brother and sister
[1:11:27] positionally placed is every tragedy
[1:11:30] every hard time every bitter tear every
[1:11:34] suffering we have faced and every
[1:11:36] blessing that we've ever been blessed
[1:11:38] with all of that was poured out at that
[1:11:41] time positionally placing us and he said
[1:11:44] I'm going to prepare them I'm going to
[1:11:47] prepare them to overcome everything of
[1:11:49] the greatest mind battle ever and the
[1:11:52] age all the darkness everything and as
[1:11:55] he speaks out our name and we are
[1:11:58] birthed into our position God suffered
[1:12:01] amen it wasn't just Calvary my brother
[1:12:04] and sister God suffered to put us in our
[1:12:07] right position
[1:12:09] amen that's it and so it is positionally
[1:12:14] placed spoken of God thank you Lord for
[1:12:17] putting us in this position amen my
[1:12:19] brother and sisters I I've heard people
[1:12:21] say well it would have been good maybe
[1:12:22] it been the Philadelphian age it might
[1:12:24] have been good to and whatever else my
[1:12:26] brother and sister they had their own
[1:12:27] trials that's right and they didn't have
[1:12:30] as much
[1:12:32] Revelation as we
[1:12:34] have they were still you might say
[1:12:36] living a slightly blind story that's
[1:12:39] right our story is
[1:12:42] revealed our story is right here every
[1:12:45] bit of word is open it's alive we can
[1:12:47] look back we can by God's grace look
[1:12:50] forward amen no Philadelphia or any of
[1:12:53] the other ages could look and see a
[1:12:55] bride going up that's right in a vision
[1:13:00] that's it and the prophet represented
[1:13:02] that we were in that Vision right talk
[1:13:05] about being amen perfectly placed amen
[1:13:09] thank you Lord for placing me in the
[1:13:11] vision that I can see myself by
[1:13:13] Revelation that I'm in that
[1:13:16] Vision amen
[1:13:26] excuse me I stumbling around a little
[1:13:27] bit I just
[1:13:29] keep getting beside
[1:13:32] myself
[1:13:35] amen positionally place
[1:13:38] names because of no other reference I I
[1:13:41] just use this but my
[1:13:43] mother as I was growing up said I named
[1:13:46] you Paul Daniel because I knew one day
[1:13:48] you'd be a
[1:13:50] preacher and then later she would say
[1:13:52] well sometimes I thought you'd be a
[1:13:54] preacher cuz you just would never shut
[1:13:57] up so you know maybe not too much
[1:14:00] spirituality in that but I use that as
[1:14:03] an example because every one of us and
[1:14:06] our
[1:14:07] name was spoke out we couldn't be named
[1:14:13] any other name right right that's right
[1:14:17] and the reason brother Bram didn't like
[1:14:19] the Ricky and whatever is what those
[1:14:22] names represented
[1:14:26] so our names are important you saywell I
[1:14:28] don't know that I really like my name so
[1:14:30] much well praise God live with
[1:14:34] it you know bear
[1:14:37] it amen there's a sister up in Canada
[1:14:40] that we
[1:14:41] know she said when she was a teenage
[1:14:44] girl in school her name is Sister
[1:14:47] Edna and she said you know it
[1:14:51] just she got
[1:14:54] harassed oh what an oldfashioned
[1:14:59] name it's such a German
[1:15:04] name one day she woke up and said wait
[1:15:07] I'm
[1:15:09] German there's nothing wrong with this
[1:15:12] name all that matters is I'm a daughter
[1:15:15] of God Amen and I've been
[1:15:17] positionally placed amen oh praise the
[1:15:21] Lord amen hallelujah now look here I
[1:15:25] need to hurry along Jehovah
[1:15:27] Gyra see we have to be what we are see
[1:15:32] that can be used as an excuse well I am
[1:15:34] just who I am yeah that's right I'm mean
[1:15:37] I'm rude I'm a slob I just have to be
[1:15:40] who I am no that's nonsense we have to
[1:15:42] be what we are gifts and callings are
[1:15:44] without repentance when you're born in
[1:15:46] this world before the world world ever
[1:15:48] began God knew you positionally placed
[1:15:52] you and if that isn't so then the Bible
[1:15:56] isn't so that's exactly God put our
[1:15:59] names on the Lamb's Book of Life not
[1:16:01] when you come to the altar but before
[1:16:03] the foundation of the world that's right
[1:16:06] that's what the Bible said Thank You
[1:16:08] Lord that I was there in birth pains my
[1:16:12] name was spoken and placed in the book
[1:16:15] Hallelujah God spoke us out into the
[1:16:18] heavens amen before it was before the
[1:16:20] foundation of the world God spoke our
[1:16:23] names into the heavens amen
[1:16:25] isn't this how precious this is you talk
[1:16:27] about God writing or laying out a clear
[1:16:31] picture to you and I how he planned so
[1:16:34] carefully to put us in the bride in the
[1:16:38] Rapture it's not some accident no some
[1:16:42] Churches some denominations think you
[1:16:44] just fortunate that you got
[1:16:46] saved no I'm actually very happy I'm got
[1:16:50] saved don't
[1:16:51] misunderstand but you see it never was
[1:16:53] my decision right right never was my
[1:16:59] decision God if I I don't want to
[1:17:01] overemphasize this but God in birth
[1:17:05] pains called out my name amen amen and
[1:17:09] when he called out my name there had to
[1:17:12] be something to
[1:17:14] respond amen and that something was that
[1:17:18] seed in my soul seed in your soul
[1:17:21] Hallelujah let's go here amen uh
[1:17:27] I didn't go ahead and write this one
[1:17:28] down it won't be there brother Isaac
[1:17:30] I'll just read I just go ahead and read
[1:17:32] this the God who is rich in Mercy uh 1
[1:17:34] in 19 of 65 and he never fails to
[1:17:38] fulfill what he promised I once was
[1:17:41] young and now I'm old I've never seen
[1:17:43] him fail in his word because he can do
[1:17:47] anything but fail he cannot fail God
[1:17:51] cannot it's impossible for God to fail
[1:17:55] and remain God he has to do that now my
[1:17:59] brother and sister you see we
[1:18:04] fail and we're still his bride that's
[1:18:07] exactly right if God failed he can't be
[1:18:11] God that's right right that's called
[1:18:14] Grace and God is the one who set all of
[1:18:17] that in Motion in other words God bound
[1:18:21] himself
[1:18:23] amen I can't make even one
[1:18:29] mistake so that's why the word is
[1:18:31] perfect from beginning to end and people
[1:18:34] Through the Ages not to go off into this
[1:18:36] but people Through the Ages say that
[1:18:38] applied for that time that applied for
[1:18:40] this that applied for that that isn't
[1:18:43] and we're deciding where it applied and
[1:18:44] didn't apply but God said it applied and
[1:18:48] we as the bride having his seed Gene say
[1:18:51] that applies to me I'm I identified in
[1:18:56] that
[1:18:57] position and it isn't whether it fit our
[1:19:00] little box or not right it's because God
[1:19:04] said so that's right
[1:19:08] amen God is the only one that can't fail
[1:19:10] he can't fail it's one thing God can't
[1:19:13] do is fail God is the word and the word
[1:19:16] no matter how it looks like it's going
[1:19:17] to come this other way it'll come just
[1:19:20] exactly the way the word said amen amen
[1:19:24] I I want to revisit that prodical son
[1:19:26] for just a
[1:19:28] moment took his father's inheritance to
[1:19:32] him and squandered
[1:19:35] it rightest
[1:19:40] living is he positionally placed or is
[1:19:43] this a mistake
[1:19:47] no I think it should change our way of
[1:19:50] looking at things just a little bit amen
[1:19:53] prodical son
[1:19:55] a
[1:19:56] problem or
[1:19:59] placed
[1:20:00] amen
[1:20:02] amen the circumstance just happened upon
[1:20:05] him or was it in God's
[1:20:09] plan now this is redundant but bear with
[1:20:12] me was it accident or
[1:20:16] ordered see we can't have it both ways
[1:20:19] right that's right we are either
[1:20:22] positionally placed of God right NE
[1:20:25] place the prophet talking along this
[1:20:26] line we're either positionally placed of
[1:20:28] God or we're lost amen it's exactly we
[1:20:33] can't have it both
[1:20:36] ways thank you Lord amen
[1:20:41] amen 1 Corinthians 10th
[1:20:44] chapter 13th
[1:20:48] verse sister via would you come thank
[1:20:52] you there's no hath no no temptation
[1:20:55] taking you oh I know I get too personal
[1:20:58] and I'm trying to break my habit but
[1:21:00] have any of us had a Temptation overtake
[1:21:05] us I mean let's we might as well just
[1:21:08] have a little laugh associated with this
[1:21:11] because anything else would be a lie so
[1:21:14] so we've all had a Temptation overtake
[1:21:17] us that we we just have fallen under
[1:21:19] that but here the scripture when we
[1:21:21] interpret it correctly we can come up
[1:21:23] with this other conclusion
[1:21:25] there hath no temptation taken you but
[1:21:28] such as is common to man but God is
[1:21:31] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[1:21:33] tempted above that ye are able but will
[1:21:36] with the Temptation also make a way to
[1:21:40] escape that you may be able to Bear
[1:21:45] it amen God will positionally place you
[1:21:50] and I for a positive outcome amen amen
[1:21:55] there's nothing can come upon us that is
[1:21:58] going to cause us to fall away from the
[1:22:02] word we can't we are the word he is the
[1:22:06] word and he is in us any way you want to
[1:22:09] put it my brother and sister oh I got
[1:22:11] the Holy Ghost he is in you amen it's
[1:22:14] not another it is our Lord himself in US
[1:22:19] amen and we look at this and realize
[1:22:22] everything that's happened in our life
[1:22:26] there's been times not so much anymore I
[1:22:29] seem to be beyond that but there was a
[1:22:31] time I was married I have three children
[1:22:34] my kids are in school I had such
[1:22:38] regret that I did not finish school that
[1:22:41] I didn't apply myself that I was
[1:22:44] rebellious and one day I woke
[1:22:48] up and it just Dawns on
[1:22:51] me I don't need to have regret I don't
[1:22:53] need to look back back that's right that
[1:22:57] was a path that God said I want you to
[1:23:01] walk down that's exactly not an
[1:23:04] excuse kids do your
[1:23:08] studies especially you young lady no oh
[1:23:12] and you smile that smile you too you're
[1:23:14] oh you're on the list too
[1:23:18] oh no
[1:23:20] see God knew the
[1:23:23] story when he spoke our name he knew the
[1:23:27] whole
[1:23:29] story oh but brother Paul we do
[1:23:34] have some opportunity to make
[1:23:38] decisions on our
[1:23:40] own well I'll tell you what they
[1:23:43] will those decisions I'm talking about
[1:23:47] people with a real seed Gene of God in
[1:23:49] them those decisions might make the
[1:23:51] journey
[1:23:53] difficult but they're not going to make
[1:23:55] the journey incomplete that's
[1:23:58] right aren't you glad tonight our God is
[1:24:01] so perfect he knows just exactly how to
[1:24:05] place us where to place us and then how
[1:24:08] to encourage us to fulfill the word
[1:24:13] amen I want to say tonight I believe
[1:24:17] everyone here Grace Tabernacle tonight
