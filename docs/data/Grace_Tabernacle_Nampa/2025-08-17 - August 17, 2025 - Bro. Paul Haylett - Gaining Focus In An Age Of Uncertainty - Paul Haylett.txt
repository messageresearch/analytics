========================================
Hallelu. Hallelu. Hallelu. Hallelu. Lord we praise thee. Hallelu. Lord we praise you. Hallelu. Hallelu. Hallelu. Hallelu. Hallelu. Lord we thank you. Lord we thank you. Lord we thank you. Lord we thank you. Lord we thank you. Lord we praise you. Lord, we thank you. Lord, we thank you. Praise the Lord. You can be seated. Since we don't have any uh screen there, do you have do y'all have your Bibles? Let's turn to Psalms 19. Uh, God bless you this morning. This is not sung exactly as the psalmist wrote it, but it's pretty close. Uh, so it's Psalms 19 and it starts about you love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; I love the Lord. And we people ask me, well, what are your plans, Brother David? And I always tell him, my plan is to plan for the unexpected because that's what usually happens and that's why we're here this morning as we are. So, uh, it starts out there in 19 about the, uh, seventh verse. If you have your Bibles there, let's see. That's might be too high. Let's try this. The law. That's gonna be too low. The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. More to be desired are they than gold, yay, than much. Go. Sweeter also than the honey and the honeycomb. Y'all know this song. Okay, let's start at the first again. The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. Testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. More to be desired are they than gold, yay, than much fine gold. Sweeter also than the honey. and the honeycomb. Statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart. The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. more to be desired are they than gold than much fine gold. Sweeter also than the honey and the honey comb. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever. Ever the judgments of the Lord are true, righteous allto together, more beired are they than gold, gay than much fine gold. Sweeter also than the honey and the honeycomb. More to be desired are they than gold. Then much fun gold [Music] sweet and the honeycomb. And some singing more over by them is thy servant warned. Is thy servant warned. And in keeping of them there is much reward. Praise the Lord. You're going to have to sing loud because I have all of this piano in front of me and I can't hear you. In fact, if y'all wanted to move up closer, that would be nice. This This morning is like informal service. This doesn't have to be church is what lives in our hearts. It's not what's &gt;&gt; praise the Lord &gt;&gt; here. So, you're here to enjoy the service. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; However you chose to do that, that's you. I love to God bless you, brother. Let's see. Uh yeah, I'll remember it in Malagasi in a in a minute is God bless you, brother and sister. That's from direct from Madagascar. Oh my. Do we all know the blessed assurance? You know that I should remember all three verses. Blessed assurance. Is that going to be too high? Let me hear you. Bless. Would you have this key? Blessed. Is that a better key? Yeah. Jesus is mine. Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine, heir of salvation, purchase of God, born of his spirit, washed in his blood. This is my story. This is my song. Praising my savior all the day long. This is my story. This is my song. Praising my savior all the day long. Perfect salvation, perfect delight. Visions of rapure now burst on my side. Watching and waiting. Looking above in his goodness, lost in his love. This is our story. This is our song. Praising our savior all the day long. This is my story. This is my song. Praising my savior all the day long. Perfect submission, all is at rest. I and my Savior am happy and blessed. Angels descending bring from above. Echoes of mercy, whispers of love. This is my story. This is my song.

This is my song. Praising my savior all the day long. Oh, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. Do you know that? Open our eyes, Lord. We want to see Jesus to reach out and touch him and say that we love him. Open our ears, Lord, and teach us to listen. Open our eyes, Lord. We want to see Jesus. [Music] Open our eyes, Lord. We want to see Jesus. [Music] To reach out and touch him and see that we love him. Open our ears, Lord. and teach us to listen. Open our eyes, Lord. We want to see Jesus. Another verse we used to sing. Open our hearts Lord. We long to see Jesus. To reach out and touch you and say that we love you. Open our hearts, Lord. We long to see Jesus. Open our eyes, Lord. We want to see Jesus. Praise the Lord. I don't I don't know if there was any prayer requests. I don't see any up there. Was there any prayer requests from any anybody? This Let's just stand up. Are is everybody just st sitting around like what's happening here? What's happening here is this is an informal service. God bless you this morning. I love you. I'm glad you're here. This is not what we're used to doing, but God bless our pastor here, Brother Paul. Said, "Brother Dave, would you mind taking the song service? There's no one else to do it." So, here we are. Uh, any prayer requests, special prayer requests from anyone? Everybody's so quiet. There's one. God bless you, ma'am. What do you have? I pray for my children and grandchildren. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's a bunch of hands right right here going up for us also for that one. I got one prayer request on the phone this morning. Uh a woman in San Francisco because of the tariff situation. Most of their uh business is from Asia. So they're having a lot of problems. And she had a meeting this morning said, "Please pray for our meeting with the Asian people." So, uh, financial needs, there's a lot of them now in these days that we're living. And, uh, my hands are up for those, too. I imagine I see some other hands. So, uh, any others? Yes, sister K brother Pashant and Sister Ka, little Isaac. They have a they have some very interesting new situations that the Lord just needs to come on this evening for them. &gt;&gt; Okay. you just lift them up and getting all of this worked out. &gt;&gt; Of course. Any others? I know there's more because I &gt;&gt; Brother Gideon and sister Billy just got married yesterday. Just like to lift them up, too. &gt;&gt; Okay. Praise the Lord. Others? Others? They're in the back. Anyone? Yes. Trevor, why don't you go ahead since you brought the last one, go ahead and bring these requests up for everyone. &gt;&gt; Up there or just right here? &gt;&gt; Wait, whatever you want, brother. This is informal. You just do. Are we even online? Well, God bless you saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll take these needs to the Lord. Heavenly Father, thank you father for this time together. We ask Lord that even in this informal service, Lord Jesus, which I believe is just fine for the invitation for you, Lord, I first and foremost would like to invite you to be here, Lord. And we believe that you are here present in the souls, in the hearts of each believer, Father. And Father, I pray that you would just anoint our faith to believe. not just to believe in you, but believe you, Lord, to have you speak to each heart this morning. Father, we long to hear you tell us that you love us. &gt;&gt; And yet, we also know, Father, that uh if there's correction needed, &gt;&gt; we pray for that correction, Lord. We'd rather be corrected here and not be wanting at the river. Father, Lord, you heard each request for children and grandchildren and for Pashant and Akancha and little Isaac, Lord, and their situations there and Gideon and Lily and their new marriage, Father, and every other request on the hearts of the believer. Father, we just pray, we know that you know what it is, and we just ask, Father, that you would answer each one. And we believe that you will, Father, take control of this service, Lord. speak to our hearts through brother Paul. Bless the remainder of this worship service. Father, we love you. We ask these things in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um, we can turn to Psalms 51. Again, the songwriter was really close with these words, but not completely. So, bear with me. Uh and it would start about the 10th verse. Yes, please, brother. Thank you. Uh so Psalms 51:10, [Music] create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence, oh Lord. Take not thy Holy Spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and renew a right spirit within me. Create in me a clean heart. Oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. cast be not away from thy presence, oh God, and take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and renew a right spirit within me on every eye closed. And I want you to sing it to him as though this is an empty building. Sing it to him with all your hearts as we get ready to turn this service to brother Paul. Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Create me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence, oh God, and take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and renew a right spirit within me. Oh, cast me not away from thy presence, oh Lord. Take not your Holy Spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and renew a right spirit within me. Hallelujah. Hallelu. Hallelu. Hallelu. [Music] Hallelu. Hallelu. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. I love you Jesus. I love you Jesus. I love you Jesus. I love you, Jesus. I love you, Jesus. I love you, Jesus. I love you, Jesus. I love you, Lord. Oh, let's just lift our hands and just thank the Lord for his grace and mercy today. Just thank the Lord for his hand in our lives and what he's doing that he walks with us and he talks with us. He's leading us along this journey. He's our provider. He's our comfort. He's our peace. And Lord, we say thank you for that. We thank you, Lord, that you are everything that we need today. every need, Father, that we have, you already have the answer for it. And Father, we just come and say thank you, Lord Jesus, for your grace and for your mercy today in our lives. We just ask you, Father, come down in this service, Lord. Just speak to our hearts. Encourage us, Lord. May your presence be known to each and everyone, Lord. We thank you. We thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. I believe we can say it's good to be in the house of the Lord today. Amen. And prayer requests. I had it written down but I didn't bring it out. And so sorry I don't want to sound duplicate but remember brother David, sister Diane, sister Ruth as they will be traveling once again uh coming back home from the funeral. And um those of you I don't know who all would have received it, but Sister April sent out a very interesting little uh deal. Did any of you receive that from Sister April? Um anyway, she's just talking about how the little church that she has attended several times there in Thailand, uh the minister got up and said, "Hey, I feel like I've been corrected that um there's such a movement for speaking in tongues being the evidence of the Holy Ghost." And uh then he just went through and started to share how that there has to be a life that goes with it. It's not just about speaking in tongues, but there's a life that goes with this and that evidence comes out of that life. And and uh um sister Carrie brought up already, brother Persant, sister Aona, we just want the Lord to come on their on their behalf and these situations. You know, uh we look at what's happening in the world today and how there seems to be so much chaos. there has to there's so much uncertainty and um we just look at that and realize that this is exactly the way God wanted it. Nothing is out of control. &gt;&gt; So we look at that and think oh my there just seems to be everything going sideways. I would say today that um we stand on the word of God everything is perfectly in its place. Everything's perfect. Amen. We have a lot missing today. Unfortunately, I'm slightly envious of them. They're up in the mountains camping and uh so we we just want the Lord to be with them on their journey home from that. Uh we have quite a few that would be online today and uh we certainly want the Lord to just bless them and uh I just always think about our sister Dorcas and suffering there in her flesh. We just ask the Lord to uh to just touch our sister and just give her a complete healing. And um those that are out of fellowship as we've kind of already covered that in a way. There are those uh of our own family, those of the body that that have kind of went astray a little bit uh not recognizing who they are totally in Jesus Christ. And we want to just remember them. Amen. Uh to lift each and every one of those up. I want to speak to you today on uh the thought or title of gaining focus in an age of uncertainty. And so as we are here today, we look at this the age is more chaotic than ever. the time, the news. it it would be uh as uh I seen a little it was actually like a little cartoon uh thing and it showed a bottle and it said uh anxiety take two daily and uh you know that's the day that we live in right a lot of anxieties a lot of people concerned but here again God is completely in control so we want to we want to just speak on this thought of gaining focus because you see what's happening in this hour right now. Satan's here to distract us, to get us to look away. But the word of God, the book is open, is it not? &gt;&gt; Amen. And as the book has been open, it has caused the bride of Christ to be more focused. It shows us who we are, where we're going, what is going to happen. Now, what happens out there? Don't Now, I don't want to sound like we don't care. We do care. But the thing is is here's the bride of Jesus Christ and she's focused on her bridegroom. And so that's really where her care is. She's not she's not worried about what's happening down the road or around the globe in that context. She cares about her relationship with the bridegroom. Amen. With her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Let's just turn our Bibles this morning. So glad glad to be here with you and um glad to see each and every one of you here today. Amen. Proverbs the 3rd chapter verses 1-6. My son, forget not my law, but let thine heart keep my commandments. For length of days, and long life, and peace shall they add to thee. Let not mercy and truth forsake thee. bind them about thy neck, and write them upon the table of thine heart. So shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man. I want to read verse four again. So shalt thou find favor and good understanding. Amen. That's what we desire today is have good understanding. We want to understand what God is speaking, what his plan is. What not just a plan for a world, but his plan for our life. Amen. We we want to understand that. And here uh the book of Proverbs, it's being laid out showing us that we will have good understanding in the sight of God and man. Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths. Heavenly Father, we just ask you to come this morning. Speak to our hearts, Lord. We have needs, Lord. We have desires, Father, and we just commit them to you, Father, for we know that you are in control of all things and you have the answers that we need. So, we come today, Father, just to pour out our heart's desire. And Lord, because you know our hearts, we do not necessarily even have to voice them for you to know what our need and desire is. And we lift those to you, Father, and ask thy perfect will be done today in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated &gt;&gt; as we're looking and and I don't know you know we all approach things in life a tad bit different and uh so I am constantly uh looking kind of taking a snapshot uh of what the world around us is is uh happening. Not that uh I want that to set the course of my life. I don't want that to cause me to be happy or sad. But I I I just uh you might say put a a finger on the heartbeat of of the world today. And you know people are baffled and perplexed. Uh I I don't mean to focus this to my world but in the world of agriculture uh there is a great paradox. People are saying what what is going on? Why why are these things you know happening? uh it's affecting people's lives, their their mental health, their emotional health, their financial health, and they're baffled and they're perplexed. But my brother and sister, the scripture, if you go and start digging through the meanings of some of these scriptures, you'll you'll find that this is the time that is fitting perfectly with the word. In other words, it's already been prophesied that this would come in this time that the people would be baffled. they would they would be to where they they're confused about what is going on around them and why it is. And the word perplexed and baffled are are pretty much in the same context. You know, they come to a place that it's almost as though they're uh paralyzed a little bit to to what should we do? What what is the right thing to do? What direction should we go? And you know, even to the point that people are are there and don't even realize they're actually speaking the scripture out. Now, talking about people not necessarily uh really desiring or focused on serving God, but they find themselves unwittingly, you might say, under the influence of the age, they're actually speaking these things that are in scripture. People declaring this is no age, no time to have a child. this is uh you know an evil time, a confused time. We we shouldn't do this. We shouldn't bring a a child in and we shouldn't this and we shouldn't that and and we've got to do this and you need to go and you know I I just was listening to a little deal and the guy was touting how the economy is going to collapse. There's all these signs that uh have happened in nations in the past and they're coming to a point that it should uh it's going to collapse and you should buy gold because gold's going to be your only security. But my brother and sister, the word of God says that being filled with the Holy Ghost and being in Jesus Christ is our only security. Amen. So we can't find a a fortress, a tunnel in the rock somewhere. We can't store up all our food. We can't store up everything that we would need to survive this. My brother and sister, what we need to do is be in Christ the rock. Amen. And when we are in Christ the rock, we would find that he will take care of us. Amen. Whether it's a brook in the wilderness as he was with the prophet Elijah. And then, you know, God is such a uh such an awesome God, if you would put it that way, that when God wanted to move Elijah, he just dried up the brook. You know, that seems almost cruel. you know, why why would you do that? Couldn't you have just, you know, written him a letter and explained why he need to do that? But that's not always how God works. Sometimes God just dries up the brook. Amen. He wants to feed you in the wilderness, he'll send a raven to do it. Amen. But if he wants to move you, he'll let you get thirsty and he'll let you get hungry to cause you to move where he wants you to be. Now, his leadership is perfect if we'll listen. And uh so as we look at this, we're li we're looking in a day, my brother and sister, that uh there is a lot of baffled people, a lot of perplex perplexed people. Uh they don't understand this. And you know, I'm going to put this and hopefully you'll understand the context, my brother and sister. Has nothing to do with the president of the United States. Has nothing to do with the president of Russia. Has nothing to do with the politics of the world. It has nothing to do with economics and droughts and floods. It has all to do with the word of God being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God will fulfill his word. He will make it happen. And so we just want to stand in a position and say, you know what, Lord, I want to be in the center of your perfect will. I want to be in that place that you called me to be. And when we recognize that we as sons and daughters of God, that's who we are today, right? And when we recognize that we are sons and daughters of God, then we will recognize that we are being held in the very hands of God. We are there at his heart. Amen. We're never out of his thoughts. We're never out of his that you know, Satan would like to convince you that you would get so far out of the will of God that there's no way for you to fulfill the will of God. But the word of God says that God would always bring you back. as he talks about in the scripture, the lost sheep of Israel. Amen. He may have taken them through hard times, but he always brought them back and he's putting them back in their correct position. And that's where God's dealing with you and I the same way. Amen. We might be on the fringe, you might say, for a moment or a bit of time. And so, we look at that, but realizing that God has said, you know what? I chose you. I paid for you. I hold the title deed to you. You are mine. Amen. And when we recognize that, we'll realize that Satan has no more right to you than he has a right to heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 16th chapter verses 3-9. Commit thy works unto the Lord and thy thoughts shall be established. You know, sometimes now, look, I I I just I don't know exactly how to say this, but often times, my brother and sister, we say we're going through great mind battles. Anybody have mind battles sometime? Great great battle that's going on. But you see what we need to do is realize that these things are all connected as it would be not one independent out here something just uh out here but you when you commit your works to God. Amen. And your thoughts are then established you'll realize that part of the mind battle is a self-inflicted thing. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. You know the saying that's out there, the man who says he can and the man who says he can't are both right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because the man who says he can't, his actions will reflect what he's testifying of. &gt;&gt; I can't. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So everything that he says and does and thinks and everything is there I is affecting his thoughts are affecting his works and his works are affecting his thoughts and it becomes a cycle. Brother Gideon Retie many years ago preached a sermon getting out of the wrong cycle cycle breaker different titles that go with that as it was posted in different ways. But you see, there comes a time, my brother and sister, there's a cycle that we all get into. And as we get into this cycle, we'll find we say, "Well, I I'm just into something and I can't break it." You'll find that your actions reinforce the cycle. And your thoughts reinforce the cycle. And it comes to a time that we must stop and say, you know what, Lord, this cycle is not beneficial for me as a son or daughter of God. And I need your help, but I am going to break this cycle. &gt;&gt; Amen. So then the action starts to change and we start moving out of the cycle. And as we start to move out of the cycle, we start to see things in our life changing. We start to see attitude changing. we start to see every aspect about our life starting to change and Satan will do everything he can to push you back into that cycle. But when we get into the cycle of the word, amen, and we start to read the word and we feed on the word and we start to confess that the word is what we need to live and the word is who we are and the word is changing me, you'll get into a whole another cycle that moves you out and you look back one day and say, "Was that really me? Was that really me? Did I really think like that? Did I really act like that? And you will see, my brother and sister, it's not a man who took you there. But it was the presence of the Holy Spirit dealing with you, starting to break the cycles of our life. And as we'll look at that, see, we'll see that our thoughts and our our works and our thoughts being established in the word of God. This is the maturity of a Christian. This is where a Christian starts to come. You know, as a testimony, you know, I ain't what I ought to be. Oh my, my brain's going to go blank on there. You know what I'm talking about. But praise God, I'm not who I used to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a lot of room for us to grow and we can see our mistakes and we see where we should be growing. But I want you to also look and see that you are not the same person that you have been in the past because God is now establishing uh thoughts in your life and action in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord hath made all things for himself. Yay, even the wicked for the day of evil. &gt;&gt; I always found this to be a very profound thought. Some people would say, "Well, John 3:16, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son." But you realize not everyone wants to be saved. There's a lot of people who like living like they live. There's something inside of them that embraces that. And so we'll look here as we read this scripture. Now this doesn't make me happy because it looks as though some people are unsavable. But um says the Lord hath made all things for himself. Yay even the wicked for the day of evil. So you realize that in this whole grand scheme God knew who would believe and who would not. He knew who would step out in faith and who would not. He knew who would say amen. So be it to the word. And who would not? And people say, "Is God forcing us to believe?" No. He just knows your heart. &gt;&gt; Knows my heart. And when he sees that, my brother and sister, I I want you to just think about this. It's been something that's been on my heart quite a bit lately. If you wonder about where you fit in the whole plan, mistakes. I won't even ask you if there's anyone here who makes mistakes. I'm just going to assume that there is. &gt;&gt; Is that safe? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Have you reached David's level yet? &gt;&gt; Not me. Yes, you. &gt;&gt; Yes, you. &gt;&gt; God does not have degrees of sin. &gt;&gt; That's right. And God turned right around and said, "David is a man after my own heart." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you read all of the things that David said and all the things that David did, how could he be a man after God's own heart? I'll tell you how. Because he knew how to repent. &gt;&gt; He knew how to say, "Lord, I'm sorry." &gt;&gt; Amen. When the prophet Samuel comes to him and says, "Hey, about this little sheep, and one man has many, and one has one, but the man with many takes the one that has one and takes his sheep." And David righteously says he should die. &gt;&gt; You realize he was prophesying his own judgment. &gt;&gt; But God said, "I have grace. &gt;&gt; I have grace for you, David." Oh my brother and sister, don't let the devil condemn you. &gt;&gt; Don't let him tell you that you just going in that cycle just going to come back the same thing. That's who you are. That's what you'll always be. Well, let there be a cycle. All right. Forgive me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Forgive me, Lord. I made a mistake, but forgive me, Lord. And my brother and sister, because he has grace, he comes and says, you know what? They have a repentant heart. They're after my heart. Amen. Because they will ask for forgiveness, they are after my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everyone that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord. Though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished. By mercy and truth, iniquity is purged. Now, I find iniquity is a very interesting thought because the scripture says because of iniquity, the love of many shall wax cold. So it's there knowing what we should do but not doing it would slowly take the heat out of our relationship. We'll start to to get lukewarm and ultimately if we don't change that cycle we'll get cold. But look how this works now my brother and sister. It is there that mercy and truth are what do away with iniquity. &gt;&gt; Can we separate that? I'm going to just cut truth off. just mercy. Mercy can take away iniquity, &gt;&gt; but God says truth needs to come. But we can have truth with no mercy and still not be finished. &gt;&gt; So God using those two together. He has mercy on us, but he gives us truth. And it's truth that breaks a cycle of iniquity. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And by the fear of the Lord, men depart from evil. When a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. I always love that. Amen. How you can see down through the years through history that when when God would be with a man, would be with a nation, would be with a government, would be with that, you'll see how that there would be those times that peace would reign. And you can look back as just a type. You can look back through uh the history of Israel and when they had kings that were serving wholeheartedly and committing the nation to serve God wholeheartedly to stand upon the word of God for that hour, Israel had peace. But soon as a king or a leadership would come in that would not stand on the word, you would see that suddenly Israel's enemies would start to rise up against them. And so it's there all through this cycle over and over again through the Old Testament that there would be those that would come in and it didn't matter of age. We think that wisdom comes with years, but my brother and sister, wisdom comes with revelation. Amen. And so there it is that we'll see a a young king who says we have to serve God and his nation is raised up in a culture of peace and prosperity. And then we'll see those that says, "We're just interested in the power. We don't really care what God said. We just want to be in control." And it's there that the proud heart then brings the enemies out of the woodwork. It starts to bring disaster and drought. And you know, sometimes we'll see it as has been in the world news here in the recent time. You know, sometimes too much rain is just as devastating as too little. And so you'll see that all these floods like we're having in our nation, you know, my brother and sister, you see I we'll think if it will just rain, but if unless it rains according to the word, Amen. when that comes down, man would feel like, oh, praise God, our church is having a revival, is that revival led of the Holy Ghost or is that a man-led revival? Amen. So they feel like it's God. But really, in reality, it's man. And so that's just as bad as a church that's dried up. Amen. You got shouting, you got running, you got screaming, you got all of these things. But if it's not something that registers down in the heart, if it's not something that was from God poured out into the soul, Amen. it will soon dry up. Amen. Every flood is followed by a drought. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And every drought is followed by rain. &gt;&gt; But not every rain turns into a flood. Got it? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You see, these are cycles that God is bringing about in our life. Amen. So, we don't want to be too far to the right. We don't want to be too far to the left. God's word centers us. Amen. And so, we're coming in a time in an age now with all the politics, all the stuff uh that is here. And if I mention polit political type stuff, forgive me, but it's just a reference point. Uh amen. as our nation is prophesied that United States would be bankrupt. And my brother and sister, I don't know if you you caught this, but back a few months, the Office of Management and Budget uh come along and said, "By our projections, the United States could never pay its way out of its national debt." And so you look at this, my brother and sister, we're slowly moving forward, but it was prophesied that the nation would be broke. And I prophecy will come to pass because it already is. And it's being testified by people who are not thinking about it in the same context that we would. But you see, there has to come a time because Revelation says, the book of Revelation says that there'll come a time that the beast will control everything. And so it will be there as the debt is paid uh by means that you might not even understand. Now, one time, Brother Eugene Brown preached here in the church and and uh some of you might remember it, but he preached a sermon that just seemed to be, you know, like where are you coming from, brother Eugene? But he was talking about how nations, how governments, how they would look at it. And do you realize that the government looks at you a as a forum? They're not going to announce this to the world, but they look at you and they have actually offered you up as collateral to our debt. Mhm. &gt;&gt; That sounds strange, doesn't it? Wait, I didn't sign anything. But did you notice back, you know, probably two and a half decades, 20, 25, 30 years, they changed it from the government had debt. Now they make statements like every man, woman, boy, and girl in the United States owes this much of the debt. &gt;&gt; So it's coming out. You say those are just simple words. No, that's how they look at you. And they're looking at you as in your lifetime you will pay X amount of taxes, you will do this, you will do that. That will be to produce this portion. Now my brother and sister, whether you like it or not, as a citizen of the United States, uh uh and being here in the United States, they have full expectation of you contributing to their well-being. It's not the well-being of the nation &gt;&gt; because the well-being of the nation would be they would make us debtree, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But you see, there comes a time by prophecy in the book of Revelation that comes a time that there has to be a debt that cannot be paid. Do you see a parallel? &gt;&gt; Amen. A debt that cannot be paid. Amen. But our Lord Jesus stepped in and said, "I'll pay your debt." But in the book of Revelation, the beast is the one who steps in and says, "I will pay that carnal natural debt." Amen. And people will be happy to receive the mark to be debtree. &gt;&gt; You can't serve Jesus Christ today without being marked. But it's not in your forehead as it would be. Now, let's just touch on that for a moment. Some people when they read the book of Revelation think the mark in the forehead is is like being branded or a microchip. You remember years ago it was in Florida. A grocery chain in Florida did a great experiment. They it took them a while to get enough volunteers to to sign up for it to really be a relevant experiment. But uh they were they were offering it was a very large grocery chain there and they were offering to have a microchip inserted in the back of your hand and you had to submit certain information you know bank account numbers etc etc to validate this. But people who are so looking for convenience amen the age that we have need of nothing &gt;&gt; we're lovers of pleasure. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We don't have time to pay for our groceries. So, we would have a little microchip and you gather your groceries and you go through the thing and it scans your groceries and you just put your hand up there and and you leave. That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, it took all of 30 days for the hackers to hack that system and people's accounts were drained of tens of thousands of dollars for one cart of groceries. Now my brother and sister, people said that is the mark of the beast. &gt;&gt; No, it's not. &gt;&gt; It's when the people themselves agree, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; When they themselves embrace and say what is happening is good. You see, these are the signs that God is giving clarity to the bride of Christ that we don't fall into that mental trap. We don't fall into that spiritual trap. You see, my brother and sister, Jesus Christ already paid the price. No one else can pay it for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. The only thing that needs to happen is for us to believe and trust and claim what God has already done for us. Amen. We don't need another savior. &gt;&gt; We have a savior. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you see how it works. Now, this sounds political, but I don't mean it. People believe Mr. Trump, and I believe I I actually kind of, you might say, am a supporter of some of the things that he's doing. I I see the end uh thing that he is shooting for. But my brother and sister, I don't need Mr. Trump to be my savior. Amen. He'll fulfill the word that God called him to and you will fulfill the word that God called you to. Amen. But he's not going to save you. And when you got a nation that owes in the trillions or whatever it is, my brother and sister, you know, I think it's in the trillions, isn't it? The debt. Yeah. &gt;&gt; 30 something trillion. Amen. Nobody's going to save the nation financially, my brother and sister. Even their own office of management and budget says there's no way we can do this. Now what I'm wanting to you say why are you making this point? Because God is brought his word to you and I that we could get focused on what is going to save us. Amen. What he called us to. Amen. In an age of uncertainty, people say, "I'm anxious about the future." I'm telling you, I know what my future is. I know what God called me to. I read the word, but it's not just reading the word because many read the word, but the word is speaking. And there's something been placed inside of us to understand what it is saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you what, my brother and sister is brother David. I like that, brother David. How that fits in with my thought. Amen. So, he's there and brother David, I couldn't even pretend to repeat what he just greeted, you know, out with our brother, you know, those words. But my brother and sister, what I do know, amen, is when God speaks to me, I don't have to go to to Google and ask it to translate it. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is coming down speaking to us. We say there's things in the word of God. I do not understand. I'm uncertain about this. I'm uncertain about that. Just let the spirit speak. &gt;&gt; Revelations 2, Revelations 3. Amen. Hear what the spirit is saying to the churches. God is speaking in this day that we're living in now. God is speaking. It's not that God is silent. It's that we're not listening. &gt;&gt; I hope that doesn't come across too strong, but it's a fact. We're caught up with this over here and guess over there. We're focused, my brother and sister. You know, now this is not what we want to call irresponsibility. that I I'm just going to I'm just going to live on the borderline of poverty because praise God, God will take care of me. My brother and sister, the word says that we should have stewardship over our kingdom. &gt;&gt; If you got animals, you need to feed them. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you've got a car, you need to change the oil. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you got a house, you ought to put a new roof on it every once in a while. Amen. This is called stewardship. But my brother and sister, none of that will replace the stewardship of our soul. &gt;&gt; None of that will will replace what God has called us to feed ourselves. I've always used this analogy and I stand with it. None of us are crazy enough to think we could get in our car this afternoon and drive all the way to the East Coast without stopping for gas somewhere. &gt;&gt; TripleA loves people like that. They get to come rescue you. I'm being facitious. They don't they're like, "You just passed five gas stations and you're sitting here in the middle of nowhere empty." But look how this is in in the spiritual walk. People are passing a refilling or refilling a refilling because we're too focused on something else. God says, "I want you to slow down. I want you to pull in here. I want you to get filled with the spirit. I want you to let the word be poured into you. And when the word is poured into you, your soul will be restored. Go study the scripture of what it's talking about. Create in me a clean heart. What was that? It was create something that was never there. No, my brother and sister. It's talking about restoring something that was already existing. Create in me a clean heart. Is there for sons and daughters of God saying, "Lord, restore me back to the position." This is where David was at. restore me back to the position that I know I belong in. It's not restore me to something I know nothing about, but restore me back to the position, the place that I know I belong in. And I think sometimes God's trying to get our attention, but he's kind also. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's not a bully, right? &gt;&gt; Prophet said the Holy Ghost is a gentleman. &gt;&gt; Amen. the type of the dove. You look at this. When a man's ways, verse seven, please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. And I tell you, regardless of what the world is around you, it's nice to have peace. Better is a little with righteousness than great revenue without right. A man's heart deiseth his way, but the Lord directth his steps. And I'll just put it this way. We got a lot of young people and stuff. If the Lord leads you, you know, I come I grew up in a generation that they would tell you young people, don't go to college cuz, you know, you'll just go there and backslide and the devil will rip up your life. But I'm telling you, the word's already covered that. Just get filled with the Holy Ghost. Amen. Seek you first the kingdom of God. You go off, you get an education in the university. Amen. And as long as you're seeking God, you're bulletproof in the university. &gt;&gt; Is it okay to put it that way? &gt;&gt; You're absolutely bulletproof because if God's already sealed you, Satan can't even get in there to unseal you. &gt;&gt; Amen. But that comes, that sealing comes not from saying, "I once was filled with the Holy Ghost." But that constant refilling, that constant seeking the will of God, the mind of God. Amen. Go to university, come right out of university, go on in life, get married, have a career if that's what it is. And you go and people say, "I don't know how they did that." I'll tell you how they did. They caught a revelation that they themselves was in control of how they approached the university. It wasn't the devil that was in control. They were in control. And they said, "I'm going to seek the Lord and I'm going to go there and I'm going to follow his will. I'm going to follow his direction. I'm going to follow his guidance and I'm going to follow the Holy Spirit and he's going to lead me and guide me to all truth." &gt;&gt; See, we're gaining focus. &gt;&gt; It's no longer we hope we make it through this world unscathed. No soldier fights in a battle without being wounded in some form. But you don't have to die on the battlefield. &gt;&gt; Wednesday night, I believe it was emphasis come out of the the sermon. You're more than a conqueror. &gt;&gt; You can't be defeated in this day and stand on the word and say, "I'm more than a conqueror." That's defeated. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; I got it. You're either defeated or you're a conqueror. &gt;&gt; And the word says you're more than a conqueror. &gt;&gt; So that means you've even stepped beyond that. You say, "But you don't understand the challenges I have in your my life." Yeah, I understand that. I may not comprehend the challenge you have, but are you going to believe your challenge or the word? And if the word says you're more than victorious, more than a conqueror, then why don't you just stand on the word and say, "Lord, I believe that and I'm going to confess that and that's who I am and that's what's going to happen in my life and I'm going to walk out of here a conqueror." Amen. I'm not going to get drugged out of here by my heels, &gt;&gt; but I'm going to be able to stand here as a conqueror. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, we got to come uh to an understanding that what the world is out here, my brother and sister, and what it looks like. We're so influenced by these things, this external things. We're so influenced by it that we start to look at this and we start to say, "Oh my uh um you know what what's going to happen, you know, if there's famine on the earth and this and that." Well, I tell you, my brother and sister, uh there was once a a a a mother and the meal barrel was getting empty. The land is in a drought. In fact, they say that it was such a bad drought that even all of the sticks to create a fire. Had been picked up. There was nothing hardly to even make a fire with. Everybody had scavenged everything that they could put in their little stove. And a prophet comes down, prophet Elijah comes down and instead of sympathizing with this woman, I want I want you to understand how God works because he wants to bring certainty to you and I to get rid of our anxieties of whether he's in control. And a prophet Elijah comes down and as he comes up to her and and he would greet her, he he he says, you know, hey, um look, before you cook that meal, you know, and she says, well, I'm just cooking the last one. then me and my son are going to die. He says, "Make me one first." Can you believe how greedy that preacher was? &gt;&gt; Come on. I want you to see a little humor in that. But it's the truth. If you had the wrong attitude, the wrong spirit, you'd be saying, "The preacher wants me to feed him when me and my son are going to starve to death." That no good preacher. I knew they were all like that. That's why I don't even go to church anymore cuz all the preachers are like that. &gt;&gt; But she had a revelation. See, the uncertainty was taken away. Was it Elijah that took her uncertainty away? No, it was the spirit. It was God speaking to her heart. Amen. So, it was there that God give to her an understanding. and she goes over there and she makes a cake for the prophet and presents it to him first. So many types that go with that. But you look at that, she followed what was spoken and instead of saying I he's got ulterior motives, he's greedy, he's selfish, he's that, she had a revelation. Something swept over her and she was like, you know what, I'm just going to obey this. I I just I just feel like I should do that. She gained a focus and as she so she makes that and now imagine my brother and sister how her life changed by just simply obeying those simple words and she made a cake for the prophet and then she goes back to the meal and she goes back to the oil and there's just as much in the vessel as there was when she made the cake. Amen. and she makes another cake maybe for her son first and she goes back to the meal and she goes back to the oil and the same thing is happening. Amen. Because God come and took away all the uncertainty. He took away all the anxiety. He took away all of the human thinking and she said, "I'm just going to follow what God is speaking to me." She doesn't declare, "I'm going to follow this man Elijah." Oh, &gt;&gt; she's following the leadership of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she started to gain focus. And I'm telling you, my brother and sister, when the meal and the oil never failed, she was there day by day, just as you will, if you trust God the same. That confidence in God's word was reinforced. Not every month, but every single meal of every single day, God come down and said, "I'm going to remind you and I'm going to reinforce to you that in this time of uncertainty, a drought on the land, the animals are dying, people are dying, but she's going back and the meal and the oil was there, a constant factor in her life because God takes care of his own." &gt;&gt; Amen. And God said, "I'll never leave you or fail you or walk away from you, abandon you." He said, "I'll be with you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In this time of increased uncertainty, people are baffled and perplexed and humanity is embracing its own version of right and wrong. &gt;&gt; That's right, &gt;&gt; my brother and sister. You think about it. The scripture says that there would come a day that they would say that good was evil and evil was good. So it's men actually you say, "Oh, oh, oh, this is a devil." The people had to let the devil in. &gt;&gt; Right? Because you can resist the devil and he will flee. &gt;&gt; So it's actually the people and their way of approaching it said, "You know what? This makes sense to me. I'm just going to reason this out." Yeah, &gt;&gt; I think I think what I'm doing is just fine. Have any of us ever thought that what I'm doing right now is just fine and how wrong we can be. &gt;&gt; Lord, your word says that you'd guide my footsteps. And this August, is it 17th? We need him to guide our footsteps. &gt;&gt; If ever there was a time in our life, we need God to guide our footsteps. This is the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And mankind embraces their view above the word of God. So, you know, there there's kind of a little bit u of an argument around, you know, the the countryside, you might say, and some people say, well, praise God. Uh, the message is the absolute. But just listening the other day, Brother Brandham says the Bible &gt;&gt; is the absolute. &gt;&gt; Now, let's stop here. I don't want to confuse anybody. I'm not trying to draw lines or cause warfare. But if you're taking the message as in the printed page and the Bible as the printed page, which one are you going to stand with? Is there separation? Is there a difference? &gt;&gt; If you understand it, interpret it correctly, no difference. Sorry. &gt;&gt; But we can lean to our own understanding and we'll slowly &gt;&gt; start to drift to where this is what we need. We don't need that. &gt;&gt; But find balance because you don't want to be over here saying this is what I need and I don't need that cuz we didn't understand this until that came. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so God's not telling us that, you know, you got to you got to just uh wipe away everything here. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Question and answers. Brother Brandham, I'm paraphrasing this. Your ministries here, do we need preachers? Absolutely. The scripture says therefore the perfecting of the body of believers. You see, we got to just be careful. But you see, God has brought a clarity to us from the word that we could actually gain focus to realize that we, you know, I I'm tend to be uh, you know, secondhand vegetarian. You guys know what a secondhand vegetarian is? &gt;&gt; Confused. confused. No, actually, Brother Trevor, you're closer to secondhand vegetarian than you think. The cow eats the grass. We eat the cow. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But we're not called to be secondhand believers. You've got to eat the book. When John is there and the word said, "Eat the book." It will be sweet in your mouth and bitter in your belly. You're not called to take someone else's. Yep. I ate the book. It was sweet in my mouth. It was bitter in my belly. Now, depending on how your constitution is, whether you can handle this bitter in your belly part, maybe don't eat it because I'll tell you what it is. That's not what the word said. The word said you have to take the book and you have to eat the book and it's going to be sweet in your mouth and bitter in your belly. Why would it be bitter in your belly? Because it's going to cause your flesh to conform to the word. &gt;&gt; Who wants their flesh to conform to the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want my flesh to control my life. I want the word of God to control my life. I want the Holy Spirit. Amen. in Revelations 2 and 3. Amen. What the spirit saith unto the churches, I am the church in this hour. You are the church in this hour. Don't look back through history and think, oh, they were some special people. If you were moved through time and was at Ephesus, you because you are a seed of God would be right there saying amen to the word. But in that day they had to eat the book and it was bitter in their belly and they made sacrifice of their own life to receive the word. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it will not be that we will walk on flowery beds of ease that God's just going to make it all some intellectual concept that we can say, "Oh, that's it." And we're saved. My brother and sister, you're going to eat the book. I'm going to eat the book. It's going to be sweet in our mouth. And I say it is sweet in our mouth. And it's going to be bitter in our belly cuz this flesh is waring against the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it will war against the spirit every day of your life until the Lord takes you home. But you're more than a conqueror. Amen. This flesh is not going to defeat the Holy Spirit that called you from before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word of God in you is invincible. Proverbs 21. Got to love these things out of the book of Proverbs. Proverbs 21 and2. Every man, every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but the Lord ponderth the heart. &gt;&gt; You know, maybe I'll just skip over that part. Amen. And in the message, look, just drawing a little out of this. It says here, what are you looking at? You say, "Oh, I belong to the Assemblies of God. I belong to the United Pentecostal. I belong to the meth Methodist, the Baptist." You're still focusing yourself away. Focus yourself on Jesus Christ. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just apply this in a very straightforward and blunt method. If you think the answer is is because you believe the message of this day, that that's your answer, my brother and sister, you've missed the mark. &gt;&gt; I don't care what name we hang over this door. I don't care what schooling you might see and teaching we've had. The whole reason that we're here and the whole reason that God has opened up this word in this hour was to introduce you and I to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our relationship is not with a man. It's not with a church. It's not with some educator. It's not with some theologian. It is with Jesus Christ. And anything outside of Jesus Christ is going to be lost. &gt;&gt; Pretty blunt, &gt;&gt; but it's true. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Focus yourself in on Jesus Christ. Hear and the answer come back. All thy sins which are many are all forgiven. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; focusing on the right thing. What does it do? It gets rid of all the uncertainty. When we have that relationship, people say, "Praise God, I got so filled full of God, I don't need to go to church anymore." But that's not what his word said. &gt;&gt; Actually, let me put my own interpretation on that. If you've got the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; you can't wait to go to the house of God. &gt;&gt; Cuz you want to hear brother Paul preach. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because God promised he would meet you here. Wow. &gt;&gt; Now, imagine, let's just go back uh for for Jerry and I, it'd be quite a few years, but you know, you go back and there's a young man or a young woman that you really like, and you know, you you tell her, "Look, um, I'll meet you at Dairy Queen 5:00." She shows up at Dairy Queen and you never show up. The next time you say, "Hey, meet me at Dairy Queen." She's going to be skeptical. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you don't show up. &gt;&gt; You'll be really lucky if there's a third time, man. Either that or she's Oh, can I say this a little humor? She's desperate. And people say, "I went to the house of God and God never met me there." Are you sure you showed up at the right place? &gt;&gt; Because he said he would be where two or three are gathered together. &gt;&gt; That's not if the circumstances work out. &gt;&gt; That's as sure as him paying for our sin with his own precious blood. &gt;&gt; Expectations. wonderful sermon. I come expecting I never fail to meet him here. &gt;&gt; Not this building, not these walls, but in the promise that he gave that if you would go and you would be there, I'll meet you in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, we got to get away from all of these distractions and get down to a certainty. Well, I can meet God anywhere. I had a friend, unfortunately, he doesn't even serve God today, but he used to tell me, he says, "Oh, Paul, it's no big deal. I can just go up on the mountain and meet God up on the mountain." But if God's down in the valley and you're on the mountain, are you meeting him and you say, "Meet me, young lady, at Mc at Dairy Queen." And then he goes to McDonald's, you're going to have a tough time reconciling that relationship. Cuz the difference between a, you know, a Wendy's burger and McDonald's burger is enough to ruin any relationship. Excuse me. I couldn't resist that. So, look at this. I'm sorry. I I shouldn't be trying to be a comedian. But let's not get caught in this same mindset today. Let's not get caught in this thing that, you know, God's obligated to meet me where I want to meet. But let's get this and get the uncertainty out of our mind that God said, "I've got a chosen place of worship. I said where I would meet you and it's not going to be out here and it's not going to be out here, but I'm going to meet you in my word." &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to meet you in there. So now look at this. Now remember there's this time this story the quotation about uh uh brother Brown speaking to a Catholic priest and the Catholic priest being well schooled sincere followed what the church had taught him and said you know what um going to you know the Catholic church is the answer basically it's what's going to judge the world now brother Brandham in this conversation says, "Okay, um, if you're going to the world's going to be judged by the church, which form of the Catholic Church, &gt;&gt; the Roman Catholic or the Orthodox? Which one of those is it going to be?" And so, you see, my brother and sister, if we're sitting here looking now, which version of the church, I'm going to bring this a little more home. I hope you don't mind. It's kind of personal to drive it home like this, but which version of the message? &gt;&gt; That's right. We got a version of the church. Now, what version of the message? &gt;&gt; We got a lot of versions. I'm telling you, every time, I don't know why this is in my brain, but not that I go that often, but every time I go to Stella's, I walk in there and I think, "Yep, this is just about like the world we live in." You got Who wants pistachio butternut cookie cream or something? Who invented that? Don't raise your hand. But somebody must like it. Now me, I'm boring. You guys know that. I don't have to tell you. I walk in there and it's like chocolate chip, mint, or vanilla. Which one? Some of you guys got an eyebrow lifted up so far. You're just like, "What?" Cookie dough. I like my cookie dough put in the oven at 3:25. Not in a bowl. So who are we going to judge this by? Your flavor or my flavor? &gt;&gt; Your understanding or my understanding? &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says neither. &gt;&gt; It's going to be judged by the word. There we have a constant we can hold on to in good days and bad days in the in the monsoon and in the drought we can hold on to that. Amen. So you know what the problem is with that is every version believes everyone who doesn't believe their version is wrong. &gt;&gt; But the scripture says it's of no private interpretation. So when I start to interpret the word to you and say this is what it means you need to be cautious. You need to stop and say, "Okay, where's he going with this?" Because it's no private interpretation. It doesn't matter what Paul Haley thinks. It's what the word says that matters. Amen. And when we can come back to a constant anchor of our soul, we can stand there and say, you know what, the wind blew me this way for a season of my life, and the wind blew me this way for a season of my life, but I'm anchored in the anchor. And whatever way that I get blown, I can't get too far away because I'm anchored. &gt;&gt; And when we have that, my brother and sister, God will always bring his bride right back. He'll let he'll let us drift a little bit. You realize how that works, right? If you've ever been on a reasonable size ship in deep water, they drop the anchor. When the wind blows from the north, you're at the south end of the anchor chain. And then the wind shifts and starts to turn and you'll find yourself, you're still at the end of the anchor, but you're no longer in the same position you was before. And even in the same storm, in the same 24 hours, you might make a complete 360 circle, but as long as the anchor holds, &gt;&gt; that's right, &gt;&gt; you are still there. You might have looked at that from here. Then you might be looking at it from here. And you might be looking at it from here. And you might be looking at it from here. But as long as the anchor holds, Amen. You might see things a little different when you're young. You might see a little different after you're married and starting to have children. You might see it a little different when you're middleaged. You might see it a little different when you're old. Amen. Just think about Brother Bob and Sister Joanne as it was coming to the end of their life. and to sit there and I had lovely conversations with them. Sister Joanne holding my hand, looking up, tears pouring out of her eyes. And she goes, "Brother Paul, I thought so. I thought serving the Lord was so precious when I was young, but it's so much more precious right now. &gt;&gt; And she's coming to the end of the life." Now, I want to know, how much do we as humans love life? Think about it. I'm not talking about, you know, the carnal side, but I'm just talking about humanity. &gt;&gt; We love life so much our bodies battered laying in a hospital fight to live. That's right. &gt;&gt; And they're like our sister Joanne, brother Bob, laying there right at the end of their life, literally coming, seeing the mist, the veil before them and saying, "This is the most precious moment I've ever experienced in my life." &gt;&gt; You see, the word took all the uncertainty &gt;&gt; away. No fear of tomorrow &gt;&gt; because you know who holds tomorrow. &gt;&gt; And this is where it is. We don't have to be in that place cuz we're old. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can be in that place today. It's like, Lord, what do I do in my future? young lady when we were there in Belgium. Young lady, she come. It's a long story, but I'll just tell you, she was there and they were having prayer and and uh you know, it was interesting because there was a lot of young people up in the front and she was there and chairs pushed around and she was there and she was like, "Lord, I I don't know what my future holds." She had just finished her university studies and the area she was from. There's really was no church. A and she was wondering, do I go back there? That's where my family's at. Uh, you know, the church was there is a little bit cold and formal. Do I go here? Do I go there? Lord, I need some direction. I It could be. Now, she wasn't looking at Paul as though Paul was somebody special, but God had touched her heart and we're there. And she's like, "If brother Paul would just come and pray for me, Lord, I would feel like my future would be clear. It would be settled. I might not know exactly what to do, but I would come and I would know that you were guiding my future." And, you know, as I was going through the chairs, praying for young people, and there was a big mass of chairs, and I skirted around her, and I went on down the line, as it were, and and just was praying for other young people. got all the way over in the other side of this uh little uh uh amphitheater building a and uh prayed for some young people over there. Some indifferent young ladies that sat through the whole youth service. You wonder why did you pay money and travel to come here to set in a service the whole time to see them on their faces crying out to God, Lord, forgive me. We prayed with them and as I started to go back something caught my attention and I thought I did not pay pray for that young sister and something with such a strong urge I just started pushing the chairs. She literally they'd push the chairs around so much it was like a barrier around her. I just started pushing the chairs out of the way. I finally got out there, reached over some chairs, laid my hand upon her shoulder and I said, "Lord, out loud." I didn't know what I was praying. I'm talking about God coming to take away the uncertainty of the day that we live in. And I had no idea this young lady. I don't know what country was from, what name she had, what her life experience was. I just reached over that chair as it were. And I just laid my fingers on her shoulder and I said, "Lord, let our dear little sister know that the way before her is clear." exactly what she was thinking, exactly what she needed from the Lord. And I know this because when it was all over, the next day she come and says, "Can I talk to you?" And she started pouring her heart out. My brother and sister, I had no idea to pray that the word, Amen, that her life would be clear before her, that you would guide it. But God knew and he wanted to take the uncertainty away from that young lady. And God's here this morning to take the uncertainty away from you and I. Is this word of God in this hour true or is it not? Amen. He says it's true. The word's vindicated that it is true. This is the word for the hour. And God wants to confirm to you and take your uncertainty away from you. What about this doctrine? What about that doctrine? Forget about the doctrines. God will straighten your doctrine out. Amen. If you're a son or daughter of God, God will come and put you on the right path. But what you got to do is be submitted to him first because he'll say, "I want you to walk over here." And we'll say, "I want to walk over there." &gt;&gt; But he's here saying, "Look, if you'll just trust me, I can take away all of your uncertainty. &gt;&gt; I can prove to you that I'm here with you today and I'm leading you and I'm guiding you." People get so caught up. I I don't know about this. I don't know about that. I didn't see it. And I don't understand this the same way. My brother and sister, why don't you set that to the side? Cuz the God that saved your soul, let me put it this way, the God that created your soul, that saved your soul, can certainly give you the truth to take that soul into eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not about what I'm thinking, not about what you're thinking. It's about what God is thinking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; let me just move right along. &gt;&gt; You know, it's funny. When you're studying, you think, "Ah, I don't even know if I've got enough to get through the service." Then you get up here and it somehow unzips itself and you're like, "Wow, &gt;&gt; the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. I barely scratched this thing and time's up. Amen. You see, let me go ahead and just read this out of Ephesians the 2 chapter verses 4-10. But God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us. Can someone say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Oh man, he has showed us how much he loves us. Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ. By grace ye are saved. He has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Now look at this. Some people unfortunately there's some theology out here you know that God is a taskmaster and people are like be careful you know you got to this and got to do that. My brother and sister when it said he made us to sit together in heavenly places God didn't do that by force. &gt;&gt; God didn't grab you and force you to go over here and to walk and sit in heavenly places. God started moving in the heart, &gt;&gt; started moving in the soul. And it's actually the Holy Spirit that's doing the moving. It's the Holy Spirit that's causing us the uncction. Pardon me for using an example, but that young lady standing the chair is just one young lady. &gt;&gt; Just one young lady. There's hundreds there. &gt;&gt; That's right. I had already prayed for I don't know probably a good quarter of the young people that was there probably already prayed for a hundred people my own self there and I'm walking back across the the the the chairs you know it was bleachers coming down and chairs in front and I was walking back across there and something says you didn't pray for her &gt;&gt; three or four steps later something says go pray for her. That's right. &gt;&gt; This is the kind of moving that the word is talking about. God's going to move us, my brother and sister. Now, imagine, I've seen this happen, so don't don't take it too humorous, and I certainly wouldn't act this out because I wouldn't be wrong. But, you know, I'm not going to come down here and throw my arm around this sister's head and say, "I think you got to go to the altar and drag her up here now. I think you need to pray through." It happens. But that's not what the Holy Spirit does. He just comes right down here and he just starts moving in our life. &gt;&gt; We're a little bit Is it okay to use the word depressed amongst Christians? Some people act like you're claiming it. But you might be just a little depressed. And you pick up your Bible. I don't know about you, but this happens to me. I pick up my Bible. I start reading. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; What do I got to complain about? Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord, for your mercy on me. All depression. Holy Spirit. Did the Lord come in and say, "I'm going to kick that spirit of depression out." No. He just sent his word. &gt;&gt; He sent his word. He That's what he's doing. He's sending his word to us. That's what's moving us from the old man that was in that cycle is his word. Will we take the medicine? Are we happy where we're at? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, praise God. I don't like taking medicine. I don't like being depressed. We're not talking about Xanax. We're talking about the word of God. But have you ever noticed how hard Satan fights you to keep you from reading your Bible? &gt;&gt; Phone rings. You just remember the 42 things that you haven't done for six months, but suddenly it's desperate in need of. Come on. Am I telling the truth? &gt;&gt; What is it doing? God is coming and he is removing the uncertainty, shifting the focus back to his word. He says, "Read my word. I know you got schoolwork. I know you need to go to bed because you got to get up and work hard tomorrow. Just read my word. No, you don't need to call that person that you've ignored their call for six months now. Read my word. And Satan's there. Oh, got a priority. Got a priority. I got to do this. Got to do that. &gt;&gt; What God is trying to do is bring us where we're focused on his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that will take away your anxiety. That will take away your fears. It will take away everything you have that's currently hindering your life. And that applies from right here in the pulpit to the very back of the building. &gt;&gt; That God wants to take away our uncertainty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I'll just save I'll just save uh some of this. Um you could read it. I'll I'll preach on it, but you can read in Habac the 2 chapter verses 1 through3. Uh do we got a moment? Can I just read it? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Habac 2 1-3. I will stand upon my watch and I will set thee upon the tower and will watch the sea that he will say unto me, what shall I answer when I am reproved? And the Lord answered me and said, "Write the vision. Make it plain upon the tables that he may run that readth it." Now, how is that person ever going to run if they never read it? &gt;&gt; So, God wants them to read the prophecy. Amen. They wants them to see this vision laid out before them. And when they read it, there's such power, such inspiration in that vision that they will run. &gt;&gt; Oh my. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak and not lie. Though it tar, wait for it, because it will surely come. It will not tarry. My brother and sister, it all comes back. We got to read it. We got to be a partaker of it &gt;&gt; and it will change our lives. &gt;&gt; Brother David, would you come? Amen. I've got quite a bit more here. Amen. Some stuff I think's really good, but Amen. One last. The rapture 65. this rapture which is coming to pass and anything that God has in the line of his word, there's always something to come out to upset that if it can. It's Satan's purpose to do that. You ever notice right after services, church, personal time, God really blesses you, Satan appears right on the heels of that, doing everything he can to upset you. [Music] Praise God. I'm delivered from my temper. The very next day, 42 cars cut you off in traffic and you didn't overcome 42 times and you're like, "Oh Lord, I guess I wasn't delivered." No, you were delivered. The devil is there trying to cause you to let go of what you were delivered. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's what Satan's trying to do. He's trying to upset you to where you step back and say, "Okay, Satan, let's have a truce. You don't bother me. I won't bother you." But you can't say that you're victorious and an overcomer and have a truce with the devil. Amen. You are called to be victorious. Hallelujah. Oh my. So much good stuff here. Amen. Well, I, you know, just not used to not having the song program. Let's just stand and sing a couple songs before we dismiss. I pray that something was said today might be a little encouragement to you that to remember see that in this age of uncertainty God is going to not we're not hoping he will but God is going to give you something an absolute that you can hold on to that you can stop with this uncertainty am I or am I not this is not like a little girl out in the out in the yard with the clover. He loves me. He loves me not. Maybe boys do that, too. I don't know. He loves me. He loves me not. He loves me. He loves me not. He loves me. He loves me not. Get another one. No, this is us with a certainty. He said he loves me. &gt;&gt; And I can say with a certainty, I love him. Amen. Could we lift a hand? Just let the Lord know today that we love him. Amen. and that with an absolute within our heart, Lord, I love you and you promised, Lord, you would lead me and guide me into all truth. And I'm just going to believe. I'm just believing. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He is our peace. your cares on him. He carth for you is our peace. Is our peace. He is our peace. He's broken down every wall. He is our peace. He is our peace. He is our peace. He has broken down every wall. He is our peace. He is our peace. Cast all your care on him. Cast your he cares for you. &gt;&gt; Just lay him down. Let the Lord take care of you. He is our peace. He is our peace. Cast all your cares on him for he cares for you. For you. He is our peace. He is our peace. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Above all, do you know that song, Brother David? start singing it rather will you? &gt;&gt; Well, that won't work. Let's see. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You know, I think we've become too dependent on that screen right there. &gt;&gt; That's true. I think you're &gt;&gt; we don't even have a song book in in the whole sanctuary here. I think maybe it's time to reestablish the song book. At least we &gt;&gt; above all see above all nature above all above all and above all and all the roots of men. Mhm. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'll have to learn it, brother. I'm Praise the Lord. I should know. &gt;&gt; This is why some brothers are called to be song leaders. Have you ever noticed just like the other day, Brother Alex comes up right there at the end of service, maybe never even noticed, you're so used to it, but he stepped right up here and just the right song. just got a hold of the atmosphere in the church and just carried it right on out. Just the right song. That's a man that's called to lead songs. Have you ever noticed very few preachers make good song leaders? It's not what they're called to do. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's guys that are called to shovel a ditch and there's guys that are called to drive the tractor that shovels the ditch. Quite a bit of difference there. Amen. Isn't that right, Brother Cody? Yeah. Amen. I was called to be a tractor driver. Amen. Oh, let me find this song here real quick. Above all, than here. Praise God. Well, it's not even in my song book. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Saints, I hope you can forgive me. Hallelujah. All to Jesus I surrender. Amen. We should read it again. &gt;&gt; To Jesus. I surrender all. I surrender all. Let's try this one.

Lord, speak to them, Father. Encourage them, Lord. Remind us, Father, we're not a part of the chaos of this age, this world. We've been called far above it into heavenly places. And Lord, you've come to deliver us, Father, Lord, from all of the anxiety, all of the questions, Father. For, Father, when we recognize that you already have the answer, and you've already sent the answer on the way to us, and you've made your word a living word, Lord, a life-changing word. I pray father today that you bless each and everyone. Lord go with them, lead them, guide them father as we come back together on Wednesday. May, Father, we be able as we pick up and read the words written of the vision, Father, that it would bring life to us, bring joy to us, Father, Lord, healing, bring virtue to us, Father, Lord, restoration. Whatever we might need today, Father, it's there in the written words of the vision. We thank you, Father. I ask you to bless each and everyone today, their patience, Father, for us as we've labored, Lord. Just ask you to just bless them for it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing that little chorus as we dismiss. Thank you, Lord, for saving my soul. Amen. God bless you. Thank you for your patience today. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I trust you got a little something out of the service today that would just be an encouragement to you. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Lord for saving my soul. Thank you Lord for making me whole.
