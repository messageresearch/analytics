say I am of the very uh DNA the very life of Jesus Christ uh this is who I am we don't have to sit here and hope amen we can stand with a confidence and say this is who I am amen good to be here this morning amen just you know I just have to say that this last week in aart Wednesday night blessed my heart amen got nervous for a minute that brother Chris was going to take what brother Dany said that I was going to take and uh you know I was like okay but but by God's grace we'll we'll be able to bring it out amen uh brother Ilia sister Natasha good to see you been a long time and your family and just uh glad to see you amen sister Rachel amen we're glad to see you always just love seeing your smiling face and uh sister Alice sister Andrea you're just like family you know one of these days are going to serve adoption papers on you amen hallelujah brother Terry you and sister Shelly and the boys are uh that's how we feel about you also and uh we might as well as we're going just invite to uh receive adoption papers from Sister April also uh if she's going to be around to sign them amen but uh anyway uh just it's just lovely I look out and I just see family each and every one of you I I just am so blessed to be identified with you not to single out any one single family or person uh but but we just love you and the Lord amen missing our sister Sarah not feeling well let's remember Sister Sarah in prayer amen Lord would just touch her body not just for today but completely just take this little thing that plagues her take it away in the name of Jesus Christ amen just before we go into the word one I'd like to announce this coming Sunday June 30th 5:00 pm we will be having communion uh so uh we've been so busy sometimes it's easy to push something a day at a little bit but we need to drive that steak in the ground so next Sunday June 30th at 5:00 p.m. amen we'll have communion I want to share this right before we go into the word of God at Camp there's a sister I choose to keep her unnamed but uh it's been a little over a year that she had um voiced to me uh that she wasn't feeling well we' prayed with her and then it was about four or five months ago or whatever it's been that um maybe not that long but uh know what you're talking I'm talking about when we were up for the um banquet uh however that's long three or four months she expressed to me the doctors thought that she had Ms she had been suffering some symptoms they said this is clearly the symptoms of MS she she wanted to just keep it close to home but we prayed with her and um you know just believed and that was many of the unspoken requests that brother Paul had presented to you was this sister and uh we just uh believed we believe our God's A Healer right we can say Amen to that this morning he's a Healer amen we don't hope he's a Healer we don't wait for him to prove that he's a Healer we declare to the world he is our healer amen and uh so at Camp uh just a few days ago this sister approached brother Danny and myself to share a testimony and um as as she was there it's very emotional thing if you imagine your whole life just goes into a a pattern not good and she broke down in tears and at first I thought oh my we're maybe got bad news or something here and uh she gathered herself I'm healed amen prise the Lord I don't have the symptoms the doctors can find nothing am amen we Rejoice with her amen hallelujah and to those of you that have had something on that serious note I know our sister Andreas had a few bouts with this on the serious note when God heals you you cannot just walk away and simply say thank you it is a lifechanging event amen one you will never forget and one that we will bring as a testimony that day before the unbeliever before those who couldn't gather their faith around the word and we will become the testimony of the healing power and the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ I'm so glad the Lord includes us amen it could all be happening we'd say well praise God we've never had an issue like that in our church but I tell you look at it from the other side you've never had a chance chance to prove the word then amen we don't like that but God wants you to prove the word and he has confidence when these things come your way that you will stand with the word and prove it amen thank you Lord that we can prove the word amen hallelujah let's turn our Bibles this morning I want to speak to you uh on the title of an internal internal Eternal excuse me an eternal ex it says oh that says external somebody's spelling my spelling they're spelling who knows amen an eternal language amen we'll get this right an eternal language amen a language that's never changed amen we were in Christ before the foundation of the world and what he spoke about you was in you in that thought before the foundation of the world so encapsulated in you was God's thoughts God's words before there ever was in our mind a you an us amen it was already there it was already presented it was already ready to be expressed and the day come and here we are and God has given us an eternal language that is being spoken and my brother and sister I say thank you Lord because we don't have to back up and find a cross reference to see where we got off because the word never left the word amen and what's in you will never leave the word and thank you Lord for that amen let's turn I want to take a very interesting maybe maybe you'll find it normal um a thought out of Genesis 11 this morning vers 1 through 8 uh for a language to be Eternal it had to be as brother brandom teaches us it it has to be if you are Eternal then you had to be in Christ from the beginning you were not added into this plan of God he didn't say I wrote this story and oops I forgot you I'll put you in now brother brandom says if you are Eternal you always was amen somebody ought to say Thank You Lord on that that we always was amen but we'll see that that do things do change and how that things are introduced and how God corrects things and and how it comes so we'll start with verse one and the whole Earth was of one language and of one speech now when it uses language and speech there it's saying that we were all speaking as it would use whatever language you want to we're all speaking English French or this or that but uh being of uh one speech is a word denoting that they were in accord with one another of the same mind speaking of the same ideologies of the same convictions and and so one language one uh uh Speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the East that they found a plane in the land of Shar and they dwelt there and they said one to another go let us make brick and burn them thoroughly that they uh had brick for stone and slime had they for Mortar and they said go let us build us a city and a tower whose top May reach into the heaven and let us make a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth and the Lord came down to see the city and the tower where the children of men build it and the Lord said behold the people is one and they have all gone all have one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech and the Lord scattered them abroad from then upon the face of all the Earth and they left off to build the city amen Heavenly Father we just ask you Lord help us to speak with Clarity this morning Father we love you we thank you for the word you've given us in this hour and Lord as we approach the word today we ask for your guidance open our hearts open our minds to receive you Lord in in this word in this hour every prayer request every Health need Lord every testimony we say thank you Father for the answer has already come and we have received it in the name of Jesus Christ we bless your name amen you may be seated since now there as we look at this uh we see that the people were there all in uh you might say one mind and one Accord and it was there that that it is that they are declaring uh we can build something that will get us into the heavens and it will give us a name it will uh bring recognition to us and otherwise we're going to just be scattered and in that we recognize you you have to catch little things the prophet of God says down through the message and a little bit much to just quote and guide each one this morning but if you study the message you'll know what I'm talking about and and we'll recognize this is the spirit of denomination so they believe they could build something that would be beautiful that would draw all the people together and in that they were coming uh uh to to prove what kind of people they were and truly they did now there is a a uh uh scripturally based uh uh premise of anything that can be broken will be broken so God's not going to let anything that is false stand it it will be broken and uh you know while the word has come in Earth and vessels my brother and sister the reason these vessels are not broken you often hear it's a spirit of denomination in my opinion I'll I'll very clearly say my opinion but my brother and sister there's a whole thing in the world today amongst the denomination that they come and they're justifying the means and behavior that they have and they say well God knows I'm broken well I'm here to tell you this morning my God is in the fixing business amen we're not going to just remain broken and use that as an excuse of why we do what we do react why we how we react and refuse to move by the word I'm broken good come as you are leave fixed amen amen that's what the Bible says that's what the word says that's what church is about come broken leave fixed amen if we leave fixed it's because we chose to leave fixed I mean uh broken sorry if we leave broken it's because we chose to leave broken amen because Deliverance is in the house of God and so we see how this is very much uh confined within the words that the prophet spoke of the day that we live in and as you see people trying to get into Heavenly places now my brother and sister I believe I could lift my hand for each and every one we want to dwell in Heavenly places do we not that's the world we want to live in not down here in this carnal dirt but in Heavenly places but you see we don't put ourselves in Heavenly places amen we create an atmosphere we uh stand on the word there's a lot to this and and we're going to be very brief but it is ultimately that we don't put oursel in Heavenly places we get into the presence of God the Holy Spirit pulls you and I up into Heavenly places no man can come you see worship you see things in churches where they have a rhythm a beat and they just keep at it and keep at it until people start to enter in my brother and sister they're preaching to the flesh amen they're not the word is what moves amen the spirit is what moves the Bride of Jesus Christ not the Flesh and so is this comes the people trying to get into Heavenly places now you talk about a real works gospel we're going to build us a tower and we're going to get up into Heavenly places and we're going to dwell up there in this glorious place we can do it but God said you know what if they get into that and I leave them in that position they will be able to accomplish almost anything they want by the flesh I'll tell you how powerful the flesh is my brother and sister it is enough to build a tower lift yourself up give yourself a big name and then dwell in that realm saying look what I have done but what God Said is you are uh strong when you are weak amen he says when you are in your low element in that flesh in the humanity that's when you're strong because you cry out amen every time we start to say you know what praise God I overcome this I I I my brother and sister that old Fox is going to come back and chew on your Vine he's not going to leave that alone amen so it was a concerted effort by man to produce the supernatural we live in a day that men believe I listen I I won't mention names but I listened to a man just a few days ago a little snippet a little clip and and uh he was declaring what he has done and he had a whole long list a laundry list of the things that he believed his ministry produced not one time did he recognize God in their midst it was about him and so we see that in this element they're building it and people around rally around it there's there's an estimated 100,000 people follow this man around the world quite a crowd my brother and sister but it's there that that's all they're going to have is their own Tower of Babel and when he falls they fall with him but the bride of Christ anchored in the word built up in the word nourished in the word lifted up into Heavenly places no matter what man falls they will stand the test of time on the word because they never were anchored in the man it was always Jesus Christ I say thank you Lord we can be anchored in the Supernatural amen we can build our own Tower to get into the Heavenly my brother and sister but I'd rather just submit myself to the Lord and let him take me into Heavenly places hallelujah amen so you see the day that we're living in and I hope that you don't mind me preaching this this way uh what the day that we live in there is a very strong anointed to come back to a unified voice can we as Believers of the message say Amen to that amen we stand here today saying you know what we need to go back get into the original word get back into Jesus Christ but you see there's always Twins and so Satan has his own twin and there is also a voice in this day that is here bringing Unity my brother and sister the prophet of God started all the way back in 1954 preaching about the the uh uh uh church and how that they're going to come together and they're going to unify and if you don't uh get in with them amen the council you got to be part of the council you got to be part of this group this is where God's at have you seen how much brick and mortar they have placed since 1954 my brother and sister they have built and built and built and built and one by one churches denominations feel compelled to put their brick into the building they feel that they need to be identified and they're putting themselves in there because this is where God's at my brother and sister that was God in an image of their mind that was their God their image that they were building but by God's grace we've been given 2020 Vision amen I stand here today in the natural wearing glasses but spiritually God has come and says you don't need someone else's answer you just need to look in the word I'll give you Clarity in the word and it will draw us together to come to this place of heavenly places amen so Satan coming in a unified voice now you know you look at this and verse four said they said go let us build us a city and a tower uh whose top May reach into heaven and let us make a name so everyone wants to make a name for himself and if we're not careful the devil will try to get us to make a name for ourself but I tell you what I'd rather just be identified in Jesus Christ and be one of his nobodies amen but be standing there in his pleasure amen now look at this they're expressing a desire to be lifted up is that any different than you now think about it weigh the words I have a incredible desire to be lifted up but I want to do it the right way that's right I want to do it God's provided way amen I want to enter into that and be lifted up into Heavenly places in Christ amen that's the only thing that matters because we get lifted up our own self I just was reading a deal and I forget the guy's name now I recognized it at the time man very successful in his life and he's still dead be known be wealthy won't stop it but to be lifted up in Jesus Christ look how the word said you're not dead they're not dead they're asleep amen there's sure a difference between being dead and being asleep having a hope of the Resurrection Amen to rise up in the presence of God than to be so fabulously wealthy and successful and lifted up in your own mind and be dead they wanted to be lifted up and to be built up my brother and sister I'm pulling a lot of thoughts together to be built up does the word tell us to be built up but look how this so close parallel is of being built up Satan's so fantastic at taking everything God and restructuring that and making it a more glamorous image because for you and I to be built up we have to die amen for them to be built up they live they themselves live and we die the flesh says wait I want to live but the spirit says you need to die so it's such a clear concise imitation that's being presented to the people amen so it's there being built up by their interpretation or being built up by God's interpretation how close it is in the flesh but how how incredibly different the result in the end the destination amen so we see how God is moving now we see how they're natural they're building imagine never seen a church with such Harmony everyone in the same mind the same speech the same motivation with the same unction building this Tower because we're going to go into the heavens we're going to go see what's up there and all in one mind nobody complaining why is he a supervisor and I'm a brick pounder everybody is like this is our project this is our Church's goal this is the end result we are all in searching for and they come and one day God looks down and says no less they would actually accomplish what they wanted now look natural spiritual if they could not be allowed there in that time in uh Babylon if they were not allowed to move into Heavenly places then will God allow them to come into Heavenly places now no my brother and sister the prophet of God says his whole world Council of churches is a false Unity that they will all in the end find out they've been caused to be submitted to the Antichrist and the old time they thought they were equals but the whole time Nimrod had a plan Nimrod had had to focus and if God had allowed that to carry out ultimately when the tower was built they would have found out they had to bow down to Nimrod nimrod's whole goal was to be at the top of everything that the people themselves would find themselves caused to worship Nimrod amen that was the whole plan from the beginning not an equality thing but he had a plan that one day to spring it on them that I am and you will and if you don't and it's there I love how brother brandom puts these things together amen you see their natural language was one of unity but God confounds it and remember now this image this basis that's here is the rain falling on the just and the unjust amen so when you think about the power that God has given you I I you don't have to raise a hand you have to do it I just want you you to recognize have you ever followed the guidance of the word and called out his name and watched God come on the scene and change it every one of us here should have approached God in that fashion and said Lord I need you now I need a victory right now I need a defense right now and see God come on the scene amen I could bore you to tears with just my own experience amen we serve a God that hears us we we serve a God that listens to our need our hearts Cry he's right there on the scene to say I heard you and I will fulfill it amen I'll just share one little brief image that seared into my mind of knowing god is instant in season one time going down snow snowwy pass the roads had been clear it was about this time of year and it snowed four or 5 Ines mushy snow and the minute people ran over it turned into ice and I had unloaded wachi and and I'm going over to go up almost to Lyon and and uh I have one pallet on this semi-trailer and then all of a sudden a car hits the bank over here spins through traffic passes within a few feet of the nose of my truck and I stomped on the brakes and my trailer swung all the way out I'm in the second lane my trailer's over here rubbing on the guard rail and then the car comes over and hits the guard rail and starts going backwards towards it would have decapitated everyone in that car would have just cut the top out of it did I do anything Supernatural no I didn't snap my fingers but I said oh Lord help me and you've never seen a truck a semi-trailer straighten itself out so fast one minute it's over here pointed out like this and next minute it's perfectly behind me and still the car only missed the corner of the trailer by just this just a few inches and that was just Paul all by himself you can say well you know your trailer found traction you know this and that and whatever I know the hand of Jehovah come right down put his hand on that trailer moved it over not only did he spare me the circumstance he spared their lives amen that's our God instant in season we don't have to stop and say well I guess I'll just have to pray about this for years to get an answer for God sometimes God's answer takes time because he tests you with time that's it's time that proves that you're going to stick with him it's not if he doesn't answer I'm going away but you sit there and say you know what I know my god's got the answer and I'm going to be right here Lord when you come to give the answer amen and we see this a spiritual desire when this was all broken up nimrod's little plan he no longer had one voice with the people there was Luther there was Wesley there was Pentecost there was assemblies and this and that all these different voices we think it's done we think it's it's good it's settle but the spirit of nimrod didn't die wonder why we have tests today because the one spirit that one wanted to dominate your life is still wanting to denominate your life amen he hasn't went away he hasn't died amen there's no Tower of Babel in the sense of Tower of Babel but he's still been building Brick by Brick by Brick he's still opposed to you he still wants to bring you in subjection he still wants to rule your life so in a spiritual sense that spiritual desire of nimrod is still there the very desire and expression in a spiritual realm now let's go over to the book of Isaiah 14th chapter we find now how that Isaiah by Perfect Vision of God sees this whole picture now if you want to you can but I want you to understand the prophet of God fully declar that the spirit of nimrod was Lucifer it's who it is so that was the original attempt of overpowering the church overpowering the Believers the original attempt is here with Nimrod now Isaiah is speaking of nimrod here but he's speaking with the words o Lucifer how art thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how art th cut down to the ground which did weaken the Nations for thou Hast said in thy heart I will ass asend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high this was nimrod's desire right here this is what he wanted to do because it's not actually the earth that is at State it's you amen that's what he wants because if he can pull the attention of the people and F focus it in another realm where they believe they're serving God but serving the devil amen then he knows at that point sincere people will sincerely read their Bible will sincerely worship will sincerely be in the house of God faithfully and be completely wrong right and so the very idea that they believe that they they are in the right place now this morning I'll just be open to you I was watching a little thing and and uh you know Sister Jerry's like why in the world are you looking at that uh I'll get to it in a minute but I want you to understand how carefully Satan can craft this to catch the attention of the people believing all is believing everything is lined up life is good my brother and S sister that's why the prophet of God said it's not a church experience it's not an experience with your pastor it's not an experience with this great man over here not in experience brother brandham says not once did I call you to follow me amen because he is declaring this has to be an experience with Jesus Christ because how clever Satan is we think the message is truth is it truth amen we think we've got truth but Satan can come right in amen remember brother Danny talking about adding another version a few more words changing it just a little bit make it a little more appealing for you to follow me that ain't going to happen is it I know that by the smirks on some of your faces and I say thank you Lord because we have failed if you follow me now look at this I will Ascend into heaven Nimrod says let's build a tower and we got Unity complete Unity amongst everybody to build a tower you know the tower is still being built that's right they're going to rise up at the heights of the clouds Heavenly places how clever he words that I will be like the most high pretty good they think they're just worshiping in a likeness only they're actually worshiping Lucifer that's right this probably not the most exciting sermon is it but it's what the Lord laid on my heart amen amen now let's look at this we would never fall for a nimrod gospel but sometimes we fall for this whole thing I can do enough work to get my way to heaven that's an old Nimrod Spirit coming along that I can just labor labor labor labor you know what it's not labor it's life amen it's not labor it's love amen so we have to come and approach it will those things produce it yes my brother and sister Faith will produce works period but works will never get you in favor with God so look at this I get myself lost forgive me we see here now Isaiah's prophecy in 14 and 12 and uh then uh brother Brown makes this connection and says now this directly connects to Revelation 17 and 18 where the scripture is there I should have had that put up and and just put it on the screen but revelation 17 and8 is talking about Babylon and the fall of Babylon and you'll find that the wording there is so parallel it just puts it together brother brand makes this connection and says now Isaiah ties directly with revelation of what is happening and what will be there and so this this tying together and because I don't want to draw this out real long this morning but you know uh uh this ties so beautifully a little inspiration come from our brother Danny there it size together so perfectly with Cain and Abel amen they're right there Abel by Revelation amen now we're talking about an eternal language Cain is sitting there saying I'm going to build a bigger and better church it's going to be the Beauty and the size of my church that is going to make the difference now look how God comes down speaks to Cain and says you know what if you just I'm going to put it in this straight language if you just repent and come to the word you'll have Redemption too Cain sat there clearly premeditated rejected the word he did not want Redemption he did not want to be sitting under the headship of the Holy Spirit he wanted to make the decision he wanted to build it the way he wanted to worship he wanted the preaching like he wanted the preaching he wanted the church structure like he wanted the church structure and he said I don't don't need a holy spirit in my life I don't need a word to guide me I can do it myself true and brother Danny brought that so beautifully Cain says am I You My Brother's Keeper we are our Brother's Keeper amen we need to stand shoulder toosh shoulder we need to hold our Shield together and create a solid wall of faith not a little faith here not a little faith there there hold your Shield up amen hold this up my brother and sister and stand together word to word word to word as we the word made flesh in this day are standing together I need your prayers and I'm going to be bold enough to say you need my prayers because it's not about lifting this man up it's not about putting this person up it's about us lifting one another up by the word into Heavenly places lifting one another up by the word in the spirit I might be weak and my phone dings brother Paul praying for you in my heart there's something in my heart oh thank you do you know what I'm saying amen we need one another amen hallelujah so it's there Cain takes a position I have more Revelation than Abel imagine how it must have grad on Cain why did you kill a lamb Abel something spoke to me and said it's about the blood what are you talking about what are you talking about well my brother Cain why would god require this Pelt this hide of a lamb for covering why didn't he take a watermelon Leaf a palm frond why a lamb and it wasn't the lamb because the body of the Lamb was done away with the body of the Lamb are you with me the body of the Lamb was put aside my brother and sister but that covering and the blood was the covering they stood there in and he would have been there and saw all of this taking place them in the garden mom and dad what happened we don't want to talk about it the whole time Cain is over there saying you know what look how beautiful look how beautiful all this is they're outside of Eden but still Beauty in its original form the thistle was just starting to grow amen all of these prickly and Scratchy and are just starting to grow and he said you know he just brought a lamb I'm going to fill the altar clear full I'm going to fill it all up then you can choose I like this part of the altar a little better I like this part A little better I want this I like this and everyone started to view it in their own eyes now let's have a little rubber on the road here have you ever experienced I don't want to say that you have because that's not really fair for me to judge you but you ever experienced a time when you were right in your own eyes only to find out you're not right yes you realize a spiritual relationship with God that we are right in our own eyes but not right we could live a whole life out we could live a a a a life that people would glorify and give respect and honor to and it still not be right but it looked right and It produced good results no doubt Cain was good to his family but he led him down a road of chaos he led him down a road that kept them separated from God and ultimately he had to answer for Abel's blood that's nothing we want my brother and sister see so we see how this clearly ties with Cain and Abel Beauty versus blood what will we choose amen I I don't want to choose Beauty my brother and sister the blood is messy but the blood is where the cleansing and the life is amen hallelujah we see that natural every day uh sister April you know in Sharing uh things you know in her trips uh people they got blood flowing in them just like you do but if that is not cleansed it will kill them and we can say we have the blood today my brother and sister but if it's not a cleansing blood if it's not a healthy blood you know we were over there uh and in Israel and remember there was that place I don't think we ultimately went in for a few dollars you can go in and see what they claim as the original blood of Jesus Christ in a vial really along with how many spikes you see but people are walking we watched them we stood there uh we well where was we that wasn't Israel that was Belgium I'm sorry no wonder you look confused amen it was Belgium when we were walking there in that deal and here's this deal walk into the deal you had to give a little donation the buildings were almost the same that's what confused me just and and you had to give a little donation to go in and see this glass vial that they claimed was the blood of Jesus Christ can I sell you a spike would the spike save you if that was the literal blood of Jesus Christ which we know it wouldn't be because it would have spoiled and rotted because it wasn't in that context you know I I'm saved come on I'm going to be really blunt to you I hope this don't offend anybody but I had a man tell me well I tell you what we got a chair from Brother bram's house and it's in our house praise God is the chair going to save you sir the spirit of nimrod lives but the spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ lives also greater power amen greater things than these will you do greater things the Fulfillment of the manifestation of the word will do greater things and as the darkness settles in the light shines for you and I brighter than any ever age that's ever been the light is shining we are not going to fall under the darkness of Le oysa we were called to walk in that light we were called to accept the blood of Jesus Christ and the cleansing power of it we were called to hear the voice but it's not nimrod's voice we were called to works but it's not nimrod's works it's the word of God alive in you and I that's what the work is that's the word that's the blood that's the life taking place today is the word in you hallelujah amen hallelujah Beauty versus blood it was confusion then Bible is confusion it was confusion then it's confusion now that's why this word of God people come with New Revelations that are so confusing so far out on the limb my brother and sister that's not the Holy Spirit he didn't come to confuse you and I he come to give us a sound mind and peace in our souls and confidence in who we are in Jesus Christ not to bring a confusion where we say well that Revelation is just so far over my head if I could tell you how many times I wish I could tell you how many times that's been spoken to me well that Revelation was so far over my head but but I believe it you believe what my brother and sister that's not what God said he didn't come to wow you he come to redeem you and for you to truly have Redemption you must know what is redeeming you it's not a mystery oh this might not go overr right but it's not a mystery that's redeeming you when he come and said in this age forgive me for just using my own words he said I'll come in this age and all of the mystery of Jesus Christ will be be revealed because he knew that you would need to know who you were it's not about Jesus proving who he is it's about you knowing who you are and he said I'm going to make it so clear and so plain and and just hold that because in a minute I I'm going to tie it together I promise I mean a farmer minute or maybe worse yet a preacher minute amen How Great Is Our God amen amen now I I hope I'm not trying to bring kind of a deal but would you sing this song How Great Is Our God H some people don't like it sister Jerry comes in this morning why are you listening to that Paul she didn't understand the point I was searching for we could sit here stop the service right now we could sing the song from the depths of our heart How great is our God we would know who we were talking about but my brother and sister you go right out here in the churches of Babel and they are there I'm not even a waste of time describing it you're there you can't tell if it's a man or a woman you can't tell or what they're covered up with paint they're covered up with tattoos amen they're this way and they're that way and they're singing How Great Is Our God I want to know what God they're talking about amen they're not talking about Jesus Christ his word does not produce that he'll save them from that sir we won't hold tattoos against anybody we won't hold piercings against anybody but if you can't find Deliverance it's probably not God and they're singing I think they said there was 74,000 people in that Coliseum How Great Is Our God I have no problem with I hope this doesn't offend anybody I have no problem with people jumping twirling doing all this I just want to know if that's the Holy Spirit or another spirit amen the Holy Spirit proves itself amen we don't have to sit back and say now were they anointed of the Holy Spirit or was that well another little video I looked at the guy ran down the aisle I'm not going to try and imitate it because I'd probably hit my head off a Pew and you'd have to pack me up but run down the aisle w roll over and start throwing like a chicken and they all said that's the Holy Spirit that's Nimrod that's Nimrod my brother and sister God doesn't make light of his presence he doesn't make light of his word it's not a game it's not something where we're all going to step out of the aisles and Grace Tabernacle and film brother Paul as he's on his hands and knees howling like a dog and then crowing like a chicken and everybody like isn't this neat the holy spirit's come Nimrod has come in the church yes all is everybody okay nobody's too Shell Shocked I can't crow like a chicken so I won't even try but crowing like a chicken my brother sister is no evidence of anything other than you can crow like a chicken amen howling like a dog is no evidence other than you can howl like a dog amen getting on your hands and knees and rocking back and forth and growling is no more evidence that God is present in the building than someone who can rock on their hands and knees and growl like a dog amen but Nimrod brought that spirit in the beginning because he knew if I can't get into the sides of the of the Tabernacle of the host of God if I can't get there then I'll think I'll bring the people to think they're there I was going to say something a little stronger if you wonder why I stumbled around there but I I think I'll just settle on that little softer approach amen How Great Is Our God can be sung by everyone but that doesn't mean it's the same God Amen just because they mouth those words doesn't mean that Christ is in that vessel I hope I'm not too hard this morning am I this started out to be a happy sermon the more I studied it it's like I just drifted off to one side not really now look you and I don't speak every language right now there's many amongst us I I I'm a little jealous I'm a little envious there's those amongst us that speak multiple languages I haven't even mastered English yet but when I master English I'm moving on to another language amen so so you look at this we don't speak every language but Revelation comes in every language and you say why would you even bother to speak on that brother Paul because it hasn't been that long in the past where a man told me well people from this certain place don't have much Revelation they don't speak English and the prophet came speaking English so therefore they can't have the same Revelation that we have and I'm thinking I'm questioning your Revelation that sounds harsh don't it I don't mean to make life of that but for them to say that when the word says every nation Kindred tongue I never seen where God put the exclusion amen oh those of you pardon me we got enough here I'll get in trouble but those of you in Eastern Europe you cannot have the same revelation we have the message came to us first I can just see somebody coming along but the first shall be last see we got no position amen we we've been given Revelation comes in every language and I want to know you feel free to speak out what's the language of the holy spirit hly Spirit word the word sister Carrie you get a star Hallelujah the language of the holy spirit is the word and so when someone comes and says I've got a revelation we don't listen to their voice we take it back to God's voice which is the word and if it don't line up we just have to look at them politely say you got a choice repent or possibly attend another church we don't have to go and say oh oh oh this he's got a word from the Lord and fact I'm sorry to say this I've become a little bit cynical when people say well praise God I've got a word from the Lord okay why don't you go ahead and tell us and while you're doing I'm going to what brother B say was the urum Thum of our dayly where's the Holy Spirit reside in the word so you just go ahead and give me your dream give me your word and we'll just judge it right here but we're too nice you know what our problem is Saints we're too nice they got a word from the Lord that's nowhere in the word won't fit and we just we just want to to be nice it's our brother we just leave it be and Nimrod says I mean if they swallowed that one have I got another one for them you wonder how people started out in the word end up somewhere else because they refused either from some ill-gotten idea of of being nice what is kind can I ask you a question what is kind we are a group of Believers here this morning what is kind here inside this building this morning amen we're not kind when we let our brother and sister slide off the word we're not kind when we let evil spirits come in the door and sit down with us that's not love that's not kindness we are kind when we are bold enough to say brother that doesn't fit the word and I'm asking you as your friend as your brother come back to the word not back to what you thought was God in the middle of the night amen amen I I hope I'm not out of line here to you this morning amen do you see my brother and sister the language of the Holy Spirit there's only one language if it's the Holy Spirit you know it's interesting I read an account of where in one church service two people got up spoke in tongues and it was interpreted and they come in direct conflict with each other which one we going to believe that brother snubbed me at the last fellowship and this brother bought me dinner no that that's not a good one no sir we're mature enough we're going to pick up our Bible and it might possibly be neither one of them's right right amen because brother Bram taught us you don't bring those things you don't disrupt the preaching of the word h for those things so when people rise up out of the deal and they start they can be wrong just simply because they didn't wait on the Lord they felt I've got to speak this word right now but God says he doesn't have a different voice in a different place I don't think it's time or place to really focus on this but I'll just give you the briefest glimpse of what it is when people rise to a level they believe they're higher than the word it's a time in South Africa and you'll see this attitude of a man calling out the people the holy spirit is not in America he's left the holy spirit's not in South America he's left the holy spirit is not in Asia and he went right down all the continents the man was from Zimbabwe and pardon my brothers and sisters but no no reflection to to Africa but that spirit that was on him he just cut everything right down they don't have it they don't have it they don't have it they don't have it they don't have it only we have it now how much research would it take in your Bible to see if that lined up but I saw 5,000 people jump to their feet scream and stom p and March around in circles utter chaos and it was because God didn't call for one man to replace Jesus Christ amen anyone who wants to replace him you can tell the spirit of nimrod has come to that dling place is that straight enough I think that time is we got to come to the place that we quit tiptoeing around some of these spirits that don't line up with the word you know they're not on the word but they believe the message for 50 years that is what they call what do they call that uh oxymoron in some cases we can simply cut the oxy off of it you see but we accept it we don't want to hurt anybody's feelings well I'll tell you what my brother and sister yes God might call that man to repentance but that doesn't mean that you have to cater to that Spirit till God calls him to repent repentance amen hallelujah oh I'll tell you what I think the Lord understands my circumstance so he's going to alter his word for me because of my current circumstance no sir but maybe the Lord really cares about these people so much he's going to compromise the word for them no I'll tell you what right now the Bride of Jesus Christ do not need a compromise we weren't called to compromise in fact this bride has one attribute that makes her separated from the rest of the world and that is the attribute just give it to me straight I just want the truth amen whether the minister is a quiet minister or he's a jump up in the air and click his heels Minister I know the truth when I hear the truth and I'm not going to not receive it because this brother Stomps and shouts and slobbers and this brother he's too quiet for me oh you say brother Paul what what no I hear these things I just couldn't get anything out of the service cuz that brother just just was well I mean he leaped six feet in the air off the off the platform I I just couldn't receive that did he tell you truth that other brother was way too timid I'm really looking for someone like Paul I need somebody like the Apostle Paul somebody that's just bold I can't receive it from a timid person like Timothy you wouldn't receive Timothy's message H wow no my four no more right well don't worry about it you won't be there so in the day we're living the prophet of God uses speaks very much about language and he also brings it in extended context to tell us that if we're going to receive it we have to confess it so we've got to put what we believe into language we've got to come to the place that our voice it doesn't matter what language as we call it but our voice must speak if we're going to receive it that's right so we come to this place the language of the Bride the redeemed do you guys know her have you met her amen amen hallelujah I'm cutting out stuff that's why mentally going yeah ch ch brother Brown standing before us declaring to us I preached what Paul preached feel free to speak out what was the significance of that did Paul need to defend himself no what was he doing Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever the same language the same word the same life and he was just declaring I'm standing here today not in defense people have said well he was trying to defend what he spoke no they totally missed it they had no Revelation they were over here thinking nimrods thoughts it wasn't nothing about that he was making a declaration that this is the fulfilling of today we have seen yesterday yes sir amen and we know what the word has for the future but there has to be an expression of the word it must come in a language and the language my brother and sister God chose to bring it in this day I I hope you don't mind me saying this it wasn't brother brandom's voice amen that's the man he chose to use but the voice was the word the voice was the word and you say but brother Paul I don't know if your example you're fixing to give fits right but my brother and sister as Cain and Abel are standing there yes your brother his blood is crying from the earth he's dead but the blood still had a voice amen our lord Jesus gave his life his blood for you and I and that blood is still still crying today it is still calling out to us today I've redeemed you you are sinless you are my perfect little Bride come live in the glory I have to give to you come in the life I have given to you come in the power I have given you that blood is still crying out amen we can preach about oh we received this and we got that and I got this Revelation is the blood crying out your name today I say thank you Lord thank you Lord it come in word form today amen so you know what happens by God's grace we get a revelation we get to check every other voice against the original that's right you know science says brother Brown says it that our voice is still floating out here I'm glad God wipes some things away cuz this voice right here it's spoken things I would never want to hear repeated but the blood of Jesus Christ is spoken and that same Jesus our Jesus is here today speaking amen now I want to just ask you a question we got we need to close I want to ask you a question you're washing the dishes anybody here never washed a dish okay youngsters are forgiven you older people starting at Donna's age older you're washing the dishes you're mowing the lawn you're driving down the road and a voice speaks do you know what I'm talking about as a Believer can you trust that voice yes sir the reason is is because the word is in you and that voice is not speaking to this flesh that voice is speaking to the Inner Man and the inner man amen by saying amen I believe that is what changes the flesh Nimrod wants to start on the outside and work his way in our Lord Jesus Christ wants to start on the inside and work his way out and amen that's the difference that's right that's the difference my brother I tell you it's just incredible I've got so many things I could say right now but I don't want to keep you too long amen now look at this I do want to I do want to really focus on this for just a minute now I'm not judging anybody if you didn't bring a Bible today but just in context everybody has a Bible right should be no reason why anybody in this church does not have a Bible amen and I'd really courage it bring it to church amen so everyone has a Bible but not every Bible speaks the same language to everyone right that's right listening to a little video clip this woman won't name her she's like I know the Bible says I shouldn't preach but the Lord and I were having a conversation one day and he said for you I make this exemption and a whole church of people Rose to their feet I'm not exaggerating oh praise God God told her she can do it no Nimrod told her she could do it sir and I'm sorry it sounds judgmental but I'm going to say it they don't know the difference between our Lord Jesus Christ and nimrod right they cannot tell the difference what kind of spiritual discernment is that I'm not judging them don't misunderstand me I want to see them saved but until they can come to the Saving Grace of Jesus Christ which is the word then nimrod's just got a lot of people building bricks and building a giant Tower we can make it there on our own it shocks me when things that if they would pick their Bible up okay I'm talking to us too just pick your Bible up you would see what you're doing is not right but we ignore it because God spoke to us he did it's right here find the page find the paragraph the verse if it doesn't go through this filter it shouldn't go through your filter if that's a little straight forgive me but it's the truth amen so it's not the same language amen what brother Danny give to us in Camp those of you weren't Camp uh you wouldn't kind of know but what brother Danny lay out in Camp you won't know because you don't know what I'm thinking I don't know what I'm thinking amen but he was speaking about Cain God gave the option of redemption to Cain gave it right there if you'll just repent and believe Cain I'd redeem you the Serpent's Seed had an opportunity for Redemption now you tell me God's not full of grace and mercy amen he offered it right there to Cain and said if you would just come but you see in his heart he couldn't there's no way you know why because it was already another language another voice had filled that space up and because of that he was not able imagine how different the story would be if Cain had just Fallen to his knees and said forgive me how different that and those of you who think you've sinned too much for God to redeem you here is an absolute son of predition the seed of The Serpent and God offered him eternal ET life now you think of whatever mistake you made in this life would keep you from receiving the word of God that's a lie of the devil because God offered it right there to the very seed of the serpent Redemption and we are Sons and Daughters of God called of him in his mind before the foundation of the world don't let some devil speak some language to you to cause you to hold back from receiving forgiveness Redemption washing of the water of the word that that's a lie that came right from the pit of Hell hallelujah hallelujah you know it was another voice that captivated him I I'm just bouncing over some of these notes sorry I just have more notes than we have time Amen brother Chris come and preach the rest of that sermon about time amen time don't exist in God's realm and we're right now just going to claim we're in God's realm but look at this my brother and sister how God would work in such a fashion that he would come down and and just speak to this and we see this manifested in Cain's life but it's offered to you and I as an example to recognize there is nothing going to keep you from the presence of God nothing going to keep you from standing on the sea of Crystal Before the Throne of almighty God and worshiping the devil throws a scarecrow throws a scarecrow throws this throws on Amen as it would be puts a flat tire on your spiritual car I'll tell you what we should say well my spiritual car has got a flat tire I'm going to get out and walk if that's what it takes I'm not going to sit here by the road of life and just say look what Misfortune give me look at circumstance gave me I couldn't serve God because I did this I can't serve God because of that I can introduce you to a brother back East that murdered a man and God come to him in prison am man in a real natural real life prison and told him very clearly you're my son you're redeemed rise up and take the promise and he rose up and took the promise and it wasn't long after that they paroled him supposed to be life but God had given him life and God said I'm going to bring you to the place I can feed that life and it's not in the prison it's going to be in the house of God hallelujah he believed it it is a little bit humorous how the brothers said you know the first few years after he's out of prison he'd hear a knock on his door and the devil had come in anoint his mind they're coming to saying that's was a mistake come with us but he finally realized spiritual natural I'm not in prison any longer amen there's no devil in hell going to come and knock on the door and say look hug that was a little mistake there you're still lost no my brother and sister it's about time for us to realize there's two voices in the church and you get to see Nimrod in action you get to see Nimrod expressing himself and Nim by history was a very polished guy so good with his words he was Stronger he was better looking had personality well I tell you what that's why God gave you Paul halet for a pastor no looks no personality no education amen I don't mean to boast you guys shouldn't be proud of those things but I'm telling you God doesn't want our personality he doesn't want our education he doesn't want how polished we are are he wants us to give up and let him have his way in our life he wants us to stand up and say Lord you said it I believe it and it's a settled thing amen hallelujah oh let me just look here you know I'll I'll just give it to you as homework if you'll just take it home can I preach it brother Terry you'll still get home before midnight cuz remember you gain that hour John 12:28 amen now here's a time that these people are they're talking to Jesus some of them have little bit of an undertone to what they're saying some are believing in general Jesus got to prove a point to them doesn't got to but I mean he's intends to prove a point and so I cut this off right here cuz I knew I'd be a little long but you can look it up in your Bibles go back it says father glorify thy name then came there a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again that was just for that day right no sir that voice is glorifying you amen Hallelujah that sounds arrogant brother Paul we're we're supposed to be humble yeah humble in the flesh my brother and sister but in the spirit be bold amen I have been glorified by Jesus Christ amen when Satan thought he owned me God come along my Lord Jesus and said sorry your your deed you have is a forgery this is a Son of God set free amen and taking the old uh uh Jewish rights my brother and sister of marriage and it carries right over into our rights of marriage amen the minute you said I do you are no longer Twain but one amen who can say thank you Lord for that amen when we received our Lord Jesus Christ he said you're no longer an outsider you're now of the House of David amen you might be the Wild Olive Branch but I didn't care there I'll take the wild designation out and now you have been great rafted in and it's his life amen life of his life amen sorry this what happens when you study a little too much uh preachers excuse you know is what that is the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered oh my maybe this is the foundation of the Thunders Doctrine I asked that up at camp but do we believe the Thunders yes I believe them with every ounce is that's within me every time God opens his voice or speaks his voice to us amen it shakes Heaven and Earth you say well I I didn't really see anything well you just wait till the other side when maybe they'll be kind enough to say come in sit down here in your personal viewing and you'll see hordes of demons trying to settle down upon you and the voice of our beloved speaking and the demons cringing and the Lord said speak in my name amen you know what that means don't you let your voice have the same Authority as my voice okay homework who of you have confidence to speak like that I'm not shaming nobody but that's one of our failings we're kind of like I'm not worthy Lord I could I please Lord would you be is that speaking in his name devil please leave no our lord Jesus said depart not to stand up and boast boy I told that devil no sir but he says speak anything in my name what do you need oh we're going to sound like the the Pentecostals on television you need money this quiet them all down here you need money speak no you're not going to win a lottery ticket because you don't buy them but let me just share a little testimony of Brother Rich Cobb as a child he got to see that in action one morning hardly enough groceries in the whole house for even one person to eat and there's the whole family brother Richard senior gets a family around the table hands them all a piece of paper and a pencil and says write down what you would like we're going to put God to the test write down what you would like Brother Rich said he just loveed that super thick cut bacon so he's like super thick cut bacon times two and they put everything and then they laid those papers in the middle of the table and then they joined hands and started praying and in the middle in the middle of that prayer somebody knocks on the door but Brother Richard he has his priorities right he's not going to quit praying because there's a knock on the door now I want to know how many of you have quit your prayer because your phone rang come on what's more important but Brother Richard cby just keeps on praying by the time they're done praying he tells them Richie go see who's at the door opens the door nobody's there but there's a whole porch full of groceries amen so pull them out of the bag shopping bag mark them off the list pull it out mark it off the list even thick cut bacon our God is an awesome God and He reigns from heaven above don't let the spirit of leor De see you keep you from boldly receiving what's yours step out and claim it not in the spirit of the world not nimrod's spirit that says look what we did but to be able to come and say my god reigns my god reigns amen now I want you to just come down here verse 30 Jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me here's our lord Jesus my brother and sister making a declaration that applies today this voice of this day did not come because of Jesus Christ or for Jesus Christ but it was because of you he knew what you needed Jesus didn't need healing he could have you know he could have just spoke to those soldiers Fall Away depart when they poked him in the side he could have said body heal thyself he could have pulled those spikes out with a strength that would not been a physical man's strength he could have pulled them spikes out and then declared that healed but it was for you amen it was for me amen Can someone say thank you Lord amen amen amen hallelujah my brother and sister because you see he's speaking the same Eternal language that he spoke at Calvary he is speaking here today amen and I almost said this morning but it's not morning anymore amen now it goes on at the end of those scriptures uh if you would brother Gideon amen we come down here he told them yet had a little while is the light with you walk while you have the light I think all of these scriptures right here apply to you and I today amen while we have the light let's believe in the light amen that we may be the children of the light these things spake Jesus departed and did hide himself from him now Jesus not standing here this morning is he please don't get the answer wrong he's here amen he's here my brother and sister and as as brother brandham in a quote spoke the other day I read it to you they acted on that because they believed what he said they knew he was there we should know he is here musicians would you come please amen hallelujah thank you for your patience this morning amen do you realize that when you walk in the light you are exalted above this Earth that's how we can walk in the Heavenly places in the midst of the me of leod deia is we're walking in the light and he is exalting US Above This Earth Hallelujah I don't know where you've been lately but I tell you what I can think I can safely say this amen Jesus Christ has walked through a grocery store in the last couple days Jesus Christ went to the park to the mountains to the desert Jesus Christ has been at at at Walmart he's been at uh DNB amen he also by McDonald's and he went by smoking Mountain Pizza because you are him him amen not what the prophet taught us that's what the word said that's why he taught us that I should just put it that way did not the word teach us that you are him amen hallelujah amen let's let it not be our own conclusion let's come to a place morning noon and night speak my Lord speak and I'll be quick to answer thee Hallelujah [Music] can I just throw one more thing at [Music] you you know the upper room wasn't so incredible because they spoke in tongues the upper room was an incredible experience because every man and woman that was there in that presence recognized who they were that's what made the difference you can't receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and live in that presence and not know who you are but when they were there in the presence of God settled down and moved through that room if they hadn't already experienced it each one of them realized this is the words of life and I have life and they receive that you say brother Paul why did you bring that up because too many people think because they had a upper room type experience jumped out of my seat ran all the way around the church screaming I've got it 30 days later I just feel defeated I I don't know if I'm saved that's not the result of an upper room experience that's the result well I hope you like my punchline of you forgetting who you are and every one of those people that was there the Tower of Babel at some point gave up their individual walk to be part of a false movement [Music] do you know God never asked you to give up who you are I want you to think about it seems how you're own part of this cult am I speaking too blunt when someone asks for you to give up who you are you question that because you are fearfully and wonderfully made God Made You Who You Are and he just wants to express himself through you Hallelujah maybe we'll have a part two amen hallelujah I actually just cut off all the good stuff oh man oh I'm suffering Saints I'm
