[30:54] father like david lord david laid on his
[30:56] face crying out for the life of his
[30:58] child until your will was shown god

[32:45] goldhorn in your presence for eternity
[32:48] we thank you father in jesus christ's
[32:49] name we pray
[32:51] amen praise the lord
[32:53] you can be seated for just a minute i
[32:55] have an announcement this morning
[33:05] so i have an announcement but i kind of
[33:06] want to give you
[33:08] a back story um
[33:11] as lord as the lord would have it i had
[33:13] a burning burden for the youth since i
[33:16] was a teenager actually
[33:18] i started even as a young person myself
[33:21] i started
[33:22] a little bit of a youth meeting there at
[33:24] the church growing up
[33:26] when i was about 18 and then uh more uh
[33:29] cons more consecutively right after we
[33:32] got married so the youth have been on my
[33:35] a big burden for me and i've always
[33:38] i've always had a desire to
[33:40] to see god work
[33:42] in young people
[33:44] he worked in me as a young
[33:46] as a young person and because of that
[33:49] there was a difference
[33:51] there was the ability for me to walk
[33:53] away from situations
[33:55] and have the faith and the strength that
[33:57] no matter what my friends did
[33:59] god held me
[34:01] and
[34:02] held me sometimes through ignorance
[34:04] i thank him for that
[34:07] we you we moved to arizona as all of you
[34:09] know in 2017 and um
[34:14] uh brother brother ron had to start with
[34:16] the youth there
[34:17] and brother ron
[34:19] they've been you know he's been a pastor
[34:20] for many years and we learned a lot
[34:23] there
[34:24] i had a lot to learn i didn't really
[34:26] know what i was doing
[34:27] i still don't but uh we're just trusting
[34:29] the lord i think that's the way the lord
[34:31] wants it to be right
[34:33] so
[34:35] we um
[34:36] the lord put the polish on us uh as well
[34:40] as in my ministry and just in general
[34:41] different things we called arizona our
[34:43] times on our back side of the desert
[34:45] experience
[34:47] because it really is the desert there
[34:49] but
[34:50] so at the bottom of everything that i do
[34:53] as a youth leader
[34:55] i want god's will
[34:58] and as you may know i'm a very
[35:00] passionate zealous person and sometimes
[35:02] i get a little excited
[35:05] and i'm not going to apologize
[35:07] for that i'm just letting you know
[35:11] sometimes i have to eat my words
[35:15] but uh i believe that god has given us
[35:18] all energy to do
[35:20] to do his will
[35:22] and what the devil wants to do is take
[35:23] that energy and put it into the wrong
[35:25] things
[35:26] that we want to pray that god focuses
[35:28] our energy into doing what he he has
[35:31] called us to do he's given us a calling
[35:32] and he's getting it he's given us the
[35:33] strength and the energy to do that if
[35:35] you feel weak but you're doing something
[35:38] you're about to do something that god's
[35:39] called you to do don't worry about it
[35:41] he'll give you the strength to do it
[35:43] and this this scripture here in proverbs
[35:45] 2
[35:46] verse 6 to 12 for the lord giveth wisdom
[35:48] out of his mouth cometh knowledge and
[35:50] understanding he layeth of sound wisdom
[35:52] for the righteous he is a buckler to
[35:54] them that walk uprightly he keep with
[35:56] the paths of judgment and preserveth the
[35:58] way of his saints then shalt thou
[36:00] understand righteousness and judgment
[36:02] and equity yea every good path when
[36:05] wisdom entereth into thine heart and
[36:07] knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul
[36:09] discretion shall preserve thee
[36:11] understanding shall keep thee to deliver
[36:13] thee from the way of the evil man from
[36:15] the man that speaketh forward things but
[36:18] the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth
[36:20] come with knowledge and understanding so
[36:22] we do the best that we have we are
[36:24] called to to do we we we we seek the
[36:27] lord's will and we do things and and
[36:30] when we first came here uh our pastor um
[36:33] asked us to
[36:34] consider helping with the youth and i
[36:36] said well i'll pray about it but you
[36:38] know yes
[36:40] but um there's certain things you know
[36:42] god's called you to do you don't
[36:43] necessarily have to go
[36:45] if i can
[36:46] sound a little bit uh
[36:49] not anyways just certain things you know
[36:51] you don't have to necessarily go go seek
[36:54] the lord and then when you don't know
[36:55] you do but it lines up in god's word
[36:57] right
[36:58] and um so just we have a heart to serve
[37:01] and um
[37:02] no desire to be known as oh they're the
[37:04] youth leaders and like we're some kind
[37:06] of
[37:07] higher than you
[37:08] we we don't desire that at all we just
[37:10] want god to do
[37:12] what he can with the youth and he's put
[37:14] us in in this position and um
[37:19] sometimes we we have to do things
[37:22] for the best intentions of our youth
[37:26] and um
[37:28] we
[37:29] love all of you
[37:30] every single one of you i and the youth
[37:33] i love you guys
[37:35] you could tell me anything and that
[37:37] wouldn't change it
[37:38] and i mean that
[37:41] um so we've been we started out and
[37:44] we've been watching closely the last
[37:45] couple of years and and watching
[37:47] situations and the youth and everything
[37:49] and god's been doing an amazing thing
[37:51] and i take no credit for that
[37:53] but god's been working on and i've seen
[37:55] young people turn corners for the for
[37:57] the good and raise up in in our midst
[38:00] and it's just been amazing and wonderful
[38:02] to see and when we started
[38:04] i had the desire to do youth at starting
[38:07] at the age of 10.
[38:08] and
[38:09] that was my desire and our pastor
[38:12] and his wisdom
[38:13] allowed me to do that
[38:15] wondering at the time if that was a
[38:17] little bit too young
[38:19] um and so
[38:20] dealing with the youth group these past
[38:22] couple of years and watching everything
[38:23] i i have i have come to to the
[38:25] conclusion um through careful
[38:30] prayer
[38:31] and
[38:33] different things that i think 12 is a
[38:34] better age
[38:36] to start the youth group at age 12.
[38:39] so from here from this from this morning
[38:41] onward our youth group would be 12 to
[38:44] 30.
[38:46] i there's a big difference
[38:49] between 10 year old and a 12 year old
[38:52] and i think that
[38:55] we just read the scripture about wisdom
[38:56] god giveth understanding and wisdom he
[38:59] has given us the understanding and the
[39:00] wisdom to make that decision
[39:03] so if you don't like it take it up with
[39:05] him no
[39:07] now if you have any any issues any
[39:09] concerns with anything that has to do
[39:11] with the youth group as the parents you
[39:12] can come to me
[39:17] text me call me whatever it's it's not
[39:21] we can talk about it
[39:24] we can discuss different things
[39:26] so
[39:28] 12 years old the 30 is the new the new
[39:31] age
[39:32] um also and youth meeting will be this
[39:34] friday and grace kids at seven o'clock
[39:36] so i thank you please continue to pray
[39:38] for the youth group god is is is
[39:41] continued to work that god would
[39:42] continue to work that we wouldn't get in
[39:43] the way i wouldn't get in the way and
[39:45] you as parents couldn't get in the way
[39:47] either god bless y'all
[39:51] we want to do that we want to keep
[39:53] praying for our young people and i think
[39:55] it's a wonderful thing that we are
[39:57] god's allowing brother chris to
[39:59] to do
[40:00] for our youth we want to not only pray
[40:03] for our youth but pray for brother chris
[40:05] when he said it we you know we need to
[40:07] pray for wisdom
[40:08] amen especially as our youth are getting
[40:10] older dealing with things that we never
[40:12] had to deal with as young people but are
[40:14] having to deal with now
[40:16] um yeah we definitely want to pray for
[40:18] wisdom
[40:19] amen as we get ready to turn the service
[40:21] to a brother paul let's sing that that
[40:23] song give me the word

[44:18] amen
[44:20] brother lynn sister joyce so happy to
[44:22] see you guys had no idea you were coming
[44:24] into town but we are so happy to see you
[44:26] amen
[44:27] happy to have our sister alice and
[44:30] sister april with us and uh
[44:33] i think seeing how even the couch and
[44:35] the chair and the bed that she would
[44:37] have is in idaho we're going to call
[44:39] sister
[44:40] april and idahoan
[44:42] and so we're happy
[44:46] just to welcome her
[44:48] into this body of believers and
[44:51] so just a beautiful time
[44:53] amen to uh
[44:55] see the lord
[44:57] blessing us and i pray blessing
[45:00] her amen a
[45:02] new new aspect of her life and we just
[45:06] asked the lord's perfect leadership as
[45:08] brother chris said we
[45:09] have wisdom give us leadership lord
[45:13] so i i just
[45:16] um you know something i never would have
[45:19] done as a younger man but
[45:22] i'm getting to the point saints that i
[45:24] just don't care
[45:26] i honestly just don't care if if the
[45:29] devil doesn't like it as the bride moves
[45:31] closer and closer and closer to him you
[45:34] know the devil's not going to say well
[45:35] okay looks like they're committed i'll
[45:37] just give up no he he just turns up the
[45:40] heat
[45:41] he does everything that he can do
[45:45] to stop us
[45:47] trying to get us to be discouraged and
[45:49] to look at the things in our life and to
[45:52] judge
[45:53] by our circumstance
[45:55] amen but we're not here to judge by
[45:57] circumstance right we're here to stand
[46:00] on the word and the word then becomes
[46:03] now i know sometimes it's verbage
[46:06] so we don't want to get caught up in the
[46:07] verbage
[46:08] but you know people will say well the
[46:10] message is my absolute
[46:12] well that's beautiful but the message is
[46:15] jesus christ that's right
[46:17] amen so there is where we truly can
[46:19] anchor or absolute and say you know what
[46:22] this is who we are we were called to be
[46:25] the bride of jesus christ and i thank
[46:28] the lord for what a lovely opportunity
[46:31] to be offered such a lofty position
[46:34] this is not you know a demotion this is
[46:36] not you know a what this is a lofty
[46:40] position
[46:41] and so we're thankful to be a part of
[46:44] that
[46:45] now sister dorcas shared and i'm just
[46:47] part of my boldness here sister dorkness
[46:50] shared with me
[46:51] that little ella grace has been to the
[46:53] eye doctor and the eye doctors have
[46:56] declared what they see and that is that
[46:58] she has
[46:59] some issue with her eye that might or
[47:02] would probably lead to blindness down
[47:04] the road
[47:05] now i'm just here this morning as it
[47:08] were to drive the sign the post
[47:12] and the sign i'm going to hang on it is
[47:14] god's property
[47:16] no trespassing
[47:19] and that's the position that we're going
[47:21] to take this is god's property this is
[47:23] not just we were born in this world and
[47:25] we hope to make it out of here and met
[47:27] hope and hope and this and that no i'm
[47:29] sorry i have scriptural proof
[47:32] now i was just reading you know and
[47:34] brother branham says somebody was
[47:36] questioning him well how do you know
[47:38] brother branham's response to them is it
[47:40] is written
[47:42] so it's there in the word of god
[47:43] declaring our rightful position
[47:46] declaring to us
[47:48] who we are
[47:50] now
[47:52] we don't we're not arrogant
[47:54] we're not presumptuous
[47:57] but quite literally
[47:58] we find ourself
[48:00] in the word of god
[48:03] and so when you find yourself you know
[48:06] it's a very popular thing in this day
[48:08] that we're living in right now this
[48:10] whole ancestry thing
[48:12] and it's quite a joke around our house
[48:14] because if this ancestry dna is correct
[48:19] i'm not that far removed from rosa parks
[48:22] and the bus ride
[48:24] i know i don't look it
[48:27] and i blame her for that stubborn almost
[48:30] rebellious spirit
[48:33] but you realized it wasn't a stubborn
[48:36] spirit she was standing up
[48:39] for her god-given right
[48:42] and so as we stand for our god-given
[48:45] right the devil's going to make all
[48:47] kinds of accusations he's going to bring
[48:49] all kinds of things before you try to
[48:51] throw offenses and stumbling blocks and
[48:54] all of these things but we have to come
[48:57] down to
[48:58] whether minority or not and that's the
[49:00] point why i bring up rosa parks she was
[49:02] absolutely the minority
[49:05] but she was absolutely correct
[49:08] she had as much right to ride that bus
[49:11] as any other individual on that bus and
[49:14] we have as much right this morning to
[49:16] take the word of god
[49:20] we may be in a minority in the religious
[49:22] world but we have every right to take
[49:26] every word of god promised to us as the
[49:29] bride of christ claim it as our own and
[49:32] proclaim it to the world amen and most
[49:36] of all you'll find that you're speaking
[49:38] to the world out here
[49:40] satan has anointed and and we won't go
[49:43] into that maybe another sermon but satan
[49:45] has anointed and you realize my brother
[49:47] and sister
[49:48] at the very birth of christ
[49:52] is when satan's work
[49:54] was made
[49:55] earthly wise
[49:57] manifest
[50:00] herod was anointed
[50:03] find it
[50:04] before it ever gets out
[50:06] but you see god prophesied it
[50:08] god spoke it and said this is what's
[50:10] going to happen and the devil was coming
[50:12] and so when i say that herod was
[50:14] bringing that is because when they come
[50:16] and started to kill the babies that was
[50:18] herod's manifestation of the uprising of
[50:22] satan in that hour against the lord
[50:24] jesus christ now we'll touch on a couple
[50:26] things today the lord will and get going
[50:28] here but ella
[50:31] if you would please just come up here
[50:32] honey
[50:35] brothers brother david brother chris
[50:37] you brothers
[50:39] they've got faith
[50:40] you brothers that have confidence in the
[50:42] word of god
[50:44] we are not
[50:45] going to sit by
[50:47] and let the devil
[50:50] touch our sister
[50:52] this is my sister amen this is a part of
[50:55] my family this is a part of the body of
[50:59] believers called the bride of jesus
[51:02] christ
[51:04] and we are going to go before the throne
[51:07] this morning
[51:08] and you know
[51:10] we're not going to come timidly before
[51:12] the throne we're going to come boldly
[51:15] god you say hi how can you come boldly
[51:17] brother paul because i can pick up my
[51:20] bible and i can read where he said we're
[51:23] already healed
[51:25] by his tribes
[51:26] i'm not hoping that my god is a healer
[51:30] i'm not hoping my god is actually a
[51:32] savior i'm not hoping that he is a
[51:34] provider the word
[51:37] says so
[51:38] amen and so i think it's time saints now
[51:41] don't misunderstand me don't let the
[51:43] devil kind of anoint anything like
[51:44] there's a question mark involved
[51:46] but if we are the bride of christ
[51:49] if we are the very chosen of almighty
[51:52] god
[51:53] let's have esther kind of confidence
[51:57] and when we come in let us not just hope
[52:00] we live through the experience let us
[52:03] come with a boldness that says this is
[52:05] my husband he loves me and he wants the
[52:09] best for me
[52:11] now i'd ask you let's join together
[52:13] we're going to pray for our sister ella
[52:16] grace that we want the lord jesus christ
[52:19] to not only just
[52:21] stop this disease
[52:22] my heart's desire would be go back to
[52:24] the doctor
[52:26] 20 20 vision
[52:29] amen and a doctor saying i don't know
[52:31] what happened i can't explain this i
[52:34] love those statements i can't explain
[52:36] this
[52:38] amen
[52:39] hallelujah not not a well you know
[52:41] there's been some marginal i want the
[52:44] doctor to say i cannot explain this

[53:05] going to make the threats against the
[53:07] devil

[53:11] to look at your word
[53:12] and your word says
[53:14] and lord we are believers
[53:17] your word says that by your stripes my
[53:20] sister ella is healed
[53:22] lord this word is a past tense word this
[53:25] is a word that lord was committed to us
[53:27] father for us to stand on and believe
[53:29] and now lord we bind our faith together
[53:32] with our dear little sister lord asking
[53:35] that your holy spirit just move down
[53:37] through her body and lord as the holy
[53:40] spirit is moving down through her body
[53:43] make everything that satan has tried to
[53:45] deposit go away
[53:48] lord to take every claim that satan has
[53:51] given lord and abolish it father we want
[53:54] to take every situation every damage or
[53:58] whatever might be done lord in the eyes
[54:01] and father we ask you today to turn it
[54:03] back lord for your word said that we
[54:06] were going back to the original seed and
[54:08] lord that original seed was my sister
[54:11] ella perfect lord and so we ask in your
[54:14] precious name now i bind my faith with
[54:16] my little sister lord jesus i ask you to
[54:19] stimulate her faith lord to believe and
[54:23] to claim that she's healed in the name
[54:25] of jesus christ and this body of
[54:27] believers will stand here today and we
[54:30] will testify our little sister is
[54:32] already healed in the name of jesus
[54:36] christ now we ask the power of the word
[54:38] in the presence of your holy spirit
[54:40] would be with her leader guider father
[54:43] let her not speak negative lord her eyes
[54:45] are good her eyes are healthy her eyes

[54:51] we just claim this proclaim this in the
[54:54] name of jesus christ and i ask my little
[54:57] sister ella to go forth find the courage
[55:00] to declare i'm healed in the name of
[55:02] jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah
[55:05] hallelujah
[55:08] hallelujah can we just give the lord a
[55:10] handclap of praise
[55:13] hallelujah
[55:17] even as we were singing a song service
[55:19] today i thought yes
[55:21] yes praise the lord
[55:24] but i wasn't thinking about sister ella
[55:27] i actually at that moment had slightly
[55:29] selfish thoughts
[55:32] the affliction of my own flesh
[55:35] what will i claim
[55:37] what will i declare
[55:38] what will i speak out
[55:41] will i sit back and say well god's going
[55:43] to heal you and doubt that he would heal
[55:45] me no my brother and sister we have to
[55:47] stand up take the whole word of god
[55:51] amen and then in standing upon that
[55:54] promise of god we can bind our faith
[55:56] together
[55:57] without one doubt without one fear as i
[56:00] spoke to you i believe that was
[56:02] wednesday night see we're not here to
[56:04] trade uh uh some kind of uh other
[56:07] hindrance in our life well you know i
[56:10] have fears
[56:12] okay i have fears that but the lord
[56:15] delivered me from fear but i still have
[56:16] doubt
[56:18] you see the fear and the doubt will walk
[56:20] hand in hand together and limit what you
[56:23] can claim and limit the confidence by
[56:26] which you will step forward into the
[56:27] word of god now the word of god my
[56:30] brother and sister the prophet teaches
[56:31] us that the word of god is released
[56:35] by a what
[56:37] full
[56:39] surrender
[56:42] so we can have
[56:45] all the word
[56:47] all the message
[56:50] but if we have doubts and fears
[56:53] if we have impediments as it were that
[56:54] satan has put in there and we say but
[56:56] praise the lord i've got the message my
[56:58] brother and sister the message will
[57:00] never be effective
[57:02] without the elimination of the doubts
[57:04] and the fears
[57:05] and it goes much deeper bitterness and
[57:07] all these kind of things that are the
[57:09] things that satan uses to hinder us amen
[57:12] god bless you
[57:13] amen at least i didn't have you standing
[57:15] amen let's stand and i i have such a
[57:18] lengthy scripture to start with that
[57:20] we'll just read a portion of that i want
[57:23] to speak to you once again
[57:25] our position of strength my brother and
[57:27] sister is in the fact that god has
[57:30] preserved us and we'll touch on that in
[57:32] just a minute to to look how god's
[57:35] preserving power now some people would
[57:37] say but brother paul i i have and i
[57:40] think all of us could raise a hand i
[57:42] have times i feel very weak i have times
[57:44] that i have uh have fallen i've made
[57:47] mistakes and and i just feel you know so
[57:50] unworthy
[57:51] yes but why didn't you quit
[57:55] see the stumbling blocks that are there
[57:58] the mud holes as it were and the briars
[58:03] but why didn't you quit
[58:06] because there's a preserving power
[58:09] and i want to just not a boasting
[58:12] approach
[58:13] but i want you to realize that in these
[58:15] times that you say i i just
[58:18] something overcome me i kind of lost it
[58:20] i did this i did that and
[58:23] brother david going back referencing
[58:24] last sunday you know you start in a path
[58:27] and realize you come face to face with
[58:29] the devil you don't just say well i
[58:30] guess i went down this road i'll just
[58:32] serve the devil no sir what do we do we
[58:34] turn around
[58:35] we run back to the throne and we kneel
[58:37] before the cross and we say lord forgive
[58:40] me
[58:41] see that's the thing there won't be one
[58:42] that will never come face to face with
[58:44] the devil
[58:46] but it's what we do when we came face to
[58:48] face with him that makes the difference
[58:50] and when we can't fall we can't quit
[58:54] you realize there's something
[58:56] greater than you
[58:58] the preserving power
[59:00] of the word
[59:01] amen christ is his word right
[59:04] amen so we look at that so i just want
[59:08] to speak to you a little bit of a
[59:09] continuation
[59:11] of time
[59:12] here i know sometimes there's a gap in
[59:15] there and and do that but i i tried by
[59:18] god's grace to bring this as a
[59:19] standalone thought
[59:21] in continuity with these other thoughts
[59:23] amen so let's just go right here psalms
[59:26] 145
[59:27] starting with the first verse
[59:29] and
[59:30] i i just felt so blessed as i read this
[59:34] scripture
[59:35] and it did scripturally fit into my
[59:37] overall thought
[59:38] uh but it it originally i was like well
[59:41] i will i will
[59:43] not include that but then i found myself
[59:46] attracted to go back and read it again
[59:49] and again and again
[59:51] because of the effect
[59:53] you know
[59:54] do you like endorphins
[59:58] you know you realize humans now let's
[1:00:00] just go into a you might say the
[1:00:01] humanistic or carnal side of us for a
[1:00:03] moment do you like endorphins yes
[1:00:07] almost nothing better
[1:00:10] than that first
[1:00:12] spoonful of you know what i'm going to
[1:00:15] say
[1:00:16] ice cream
[1:00:18] the endorphins go wild
[1:00:21] and that's how if you've got nothing
[1:00:23] better to do
[1:00:24] you eat the whole carton
[1:00:27] because while you're searching for the
[1:00:29] same
[1:00:30] effect
[1:00:31] you got with that first spoonful that's
[1:00:34] how god made us
[1:00:36] but i want you to see real quick before
[1:00:38] we go into this scripture how that god
[1:00:40] coming down when he made you a new
[1:00:42] creature in christ
[1:00:44] that he couldn't take and rewrite you
[1:00:47] now just bear with me as i bring this
[1:00:49] out he didn't rewrite you we say we're a
[1:00:52] new creature in christ but do you
[1:00:54] realize he took the very nature he
[1:00:56] didn't wipe your hard drive and say i'm
[1:00:58] going to give you an entirely different
[1:01:01] personality
[1:01:02] i'm going to give you entirely different
[1:01:04] intelligence and entirely different
[1:01:06] taste in food and blah blah blah right
[1:01:09] so what did he do he took all things
[1:01:12] subject in the flesh
[1:01:15] and committed him
[1:01:17] them
[1:01:18] to him
[1:01:21] he took that
[1:01:22] now we had a good laugh last night and
[1:01:24] i'm not going to bring that up but
[1:01:26] sometimes our old flash just pops up out
[1:01:29] of nowhere and we have to slap it down
[1:01:33] but you know what my brother and sister
[1:01:35] we are not zombies
[1:01:40] and god said in spite of
[1:01:42] who could i pick i don't want to point
[1:01:44] at me this morning that would be just
[1:01:46] too rough
[1:01:47] but
[1:01:48] he took this nature
[1:01:51] he says satan i'll prove to you the
[1:01:53] power of the word
[1:01:55] i'll prove to you the power of my spirit
[1:01:58] because i'm going to take these old
[1:02:01] badger skins
[1:02:03] god bless you badger saints this morning
[1:02:06] amen i say badger saints because you see
[1:02:08] that old badger has come subject to the
[1:02:10] word
[1:02:11] that old badger rares his head up every
[1:02:13] once in a while
[1:02:15] amen i'll just tell you a quick little
[1:02:17] funny story a farmer friend you know he
[1:02:20] was telling me said i had a scare this
[1:02:22] morning
[1:02:24] and i was oh what's that and he said
[1:02:26] well i was out irrigating and there was
[1:02:27] a badger in my hayfield and i bailed out
[1:02:29] the pickup without thinking and i
[1:02:31] grabbed a shovel and i ran over there
[1:02:33] and i started beating on that badger and
[1:02:36] he said about the time the shovel handle
[1:02:38] broke i realized that badger is a lot
[1:02:40] tougher than me and he said he almost
[1:02:42] beat me back to the pickup
[1:02:49] come on
[1:02:50] that's why we got to take that one quick
[1:02:54] step
[1:02:55] from lord
[1:02:56] let my flesh
[1:02:58] become subject
[1:03:00] to you because you start running away
[1:03:03] from it the devil can run faster than
[1:03:05] you can
[1:03:07] but we can get under the blood
[1:03:09] amen and we know what the prophet said
[1:03:12] the devil comes under the blood
[1:03:14] you'll get to call him brother so he
[1:03:16] won't come under the blood
[1:03:19] david psalm of praise i will extol thee
[1:03:23] my god
[1:03:25] o king and i will bless thy name forever
[1:03:28] and ever sounds like a son or daughter
[1:03:30] of god right
[1:03:31] every day will i bless thee and i will
[1:03:33] praise thy name forever and ever still
[1:03:36] sounds like sons and daughters of god
[1:03:39] great is the lord and greatly to be
[1:03:41] praised and his greatness is
[1:03:44] unsearchable
[1:03:46] one generation
[1:03:48] shall praise thy works to another and
[1:03:51] should declare thy mighty acts
[1:03:54] lord we ask you to bless the word this
[1:03:56] morning lord just help us be precise and
[1:03:59] concise lord let it come down register
[1:04:02] in our hearts lord to realize the kind
[1:04:05] of god we serve
[1:04:07] lord how mighty you are how beautiful
[1:04:10] oh how loving and kind
[1:04:13] thy grace is unmeasurable
[1:04:16] thy wisdom and knowledge as the
[1:04:18] scripture says is
[1:04:20] unsearchable so great
[1:04:22] we thank you this morning
[1:04:24] ask you to make this real to us lord
[1:04:26] today in your precious name
[1:04:28] amen
[1:04:29] hallelujah you may be seated saints
[1:04:32] i save this moment right now to say
[1:04:35] a beautiful and hearty welcome
[1:04:38] to
[1:04:39] my lovely daughter jolin
[1:04:41] and my lovely granddaughter aaliyah
[1:04:44] that
[1:04:45] they have come home they say you know
[1:04:47] just cast it on the waters and if they
[1:04:49] love you they'll come back
[1:04:51] so i'm really happy they came back today
[1:04:54] so or last night in the middle of the
[1:04:56] night
[1:04:57] amen so i want to go on if you would
[1:05:00] just continue these scriptures i'm glad
[1:05:03] in verse 4
[1:05:04] that it is there that this promise of
[1:05:07] the word as one generation shall praise
[1:05:09] thy works to another now look my brother
[1:05:12] and sister as we stand here today we
[1:05:14] have various ages and not to make any
[1:05:16] point of it but to those that would be
[1:05:18] the oldest here today down to the
[1:05:20] youngest and somehow this word must go
[1:05:23] from generation to generation this word
[1:05:26] you say well you know if they're seed of
[1:05:28] god that the word will find them but my
[1:05:30] brother and sister god said you know
[1:05:32] what i'm going to do i'm going to ordain
[1:05:34] moms and dads and ministers and aunts
[1:05:36] and uncles and friends and whatever else
[1:05:39] to be anointed to come and feel
[1:05:42] compelled to share the beauty of the
[1:05:44] gospel of jesus christ to be able to
[1:05:47] come and not let our our testimonies as
[1:05:51] it were of healings and deliverances you
[1:05:53] say well sometimes these things are
[1:05:55] personal well my brother and sister if
[1:05:57] we're all under the blood and i want to
[1:05:59] say lord let us all be under the blood
[1:06:01] we will not judge one for their history
[1:06:04] but we'll look at what god is doing in a
[1:06:06] present tense and we'll say look at this
[1:06:08] god has delivered my brother has
[1:06:10] delivered my sister has delivered this
[1:06:13] teenager has delivered this person from
[1:06:16] this situation and i'm here to testify
[1:06:19] of it i'm here not to boast of anything
[1:06:22] i've ever done but i'm telling you
[1:06:24] saints as a teenager not serving god to
[1:06:26] be in a pickup that's hanging on the
[1:06:28] edge of a cliff
[1:06:31] and realizing it's one little rock about
[1:06:33] this big that kept a whole pickup from
[1:06:35] sliding off into the abyss
[1:06:38] and the only thing i remember from that
[1:06:40] moment
[1:06:43] thank you
[1:06:44] lord thank you lord because i wasn't
[1:06:47] serving him
[1:06:49] if we had fallen in that canyon
[1:06:52] i would have stood before a god in
[1:06:54] judgment
[1:06:55] because at that stage of my life i had
[1:06:57] rejected
[1:06:59] oh you say you spoke an incident no i
[1:07:01] did not
[1:07:02] but i refused to do it
[1:07:05] i had rejected that
[1:07:07] but god rich in mercy can someone say
[1:07:10] amen
[1:07:11] god rich in mercy said your time is not
[1:07:14] yet i have a purpose for your life i
[1:07:17] have a way a path i have a place for you
[1:07:20] to go and i have people for you to
[1:07:23] witness to oh it might be your own child
[1:07:26] your own grandchild it might be one in
[1:07:29] your family one in this body of
[1:07:30] believers but god said i'm gonna give
[1:07:33] you a voice to tell of my majesty to
[1:07:36] tell of my power to tell of my love and
[1:07:40] of my grace
[1:07:42] amen someone's got to do it
[1:07:45] and i thank the lord for that
[1:07:48] you know reading here recently
[1:07:51] a critic
[1:07:52] and i don't know i feel compelled to
[1:07:53] share this but i am a critic saying
[1:07:56] william branham boasted of himself
[1:08:02] you know when i read it when i hear it
[1:08:04] you know what my thoughts are
[1:08:07] thank you lord
[1:08:08] because i would feel completely lost
[1:08:11] without an understanding of these things
[1:08:14] and how that god could come and love me
[1:08:16] so much
[1:08:18] love me so much and when the prophet of
[1:08:20] god lied
[1:08:22] oh you know the die hards will tell you
[1:08:23] well shall i call them diehards what
[1:08:25] should i call them
[1:08:26] the fanatics
[1:08:28] the what i don't say this demeaning but
[1:08:31] they're going to say how dare you say in
[1:08:32] public brother branham lied well brother
[1:08:34] branham put it right on tape
[1:08:37] and said the lord checked me and
[1:08:39] basically told me i'm just paraphrasing
[1:08:40] this not going to answer your prayer i'm
[1:08:42] not going to give you any discernment
[1:08:44] for these things until you make that
[1:08:46] right and you know what that did for me
[1:08:49] i didn't look at william branham and say
[1:08:50] whoa this guy lied i can't follow him i
[1:08:52] looked at that when he shares that and
[1:08:54] said there's hope for me
[1:08:56] there's hope for me
[1:08:58] because i have lied
[1:09:02] oh and the worst kind of lie my brother
[1:09:04] and sister they say
[1:09:06] is the one that's almost entirely
[1:09:09] truth
[1:09:11] the gray one
[1:09:13] yeah
[1:09:14] the gray one
[1:09:17] i don't know i felt compelled to share
[1:09:18] that
[1:09:20] but let us be a generation
[1:09:23] that shares the works of god
[1:09:25] let us be a generation
[1:09:28] that we declare his mighty acts that
[1:09:30] have taken place in this hour let us
[1:09:32] never be silenced by the critics
[1:09:36] that want to muzzle us
[1:09:38] because
[1:09:39] we're ever increasingly
[1:09:41] becoming the minority
[1:09:45] in fact do you realize i won't go into
[1:09:47] it in some areas in a country they're
[1:09:50] talking about making the message a hate
[1:09:53] crime
[1:09:55] because after all in the day that we
[1:09:57] live in you know what i mean mainstream
[1:09:59] sodom
[1:10:02] we're not allowed
[1:10:04] we're not allowed to make anyone feel
[1:10:07] less
[1:10:08] in fact if you notice that satan is so
[1:10:10] good he's empowered the voice
[1:10:16] all that voice did is set them up for
[1:10:17] judgment
[1:10:20] and satan sitting back if you don't mind
[1:10:24] that's beautiful they're going to be
[1:10:26] judged and i
[1:10:28] never even got in the picture as far as
[1:10:31] they know
[1:10:33] i just stayed behind it and i got them
[1:10:36] to come face to face with god's word
[1:10:38] and for them to say you're judging me
[1:10:42] first corinthians 11 is pretty clear on
[1:10:44] that
[1:10:45] we judge ourself
[1:10:47] but you see they refuse to judge
[1:10:49] themselves so then they're offended if
[1:10:51] they are judged
[1:10:53] mine let me get going here
[1:10:55] and the men shall speak of the might of
[1:10:57] thy terrible acts
[1:10:59] and i will declare thy greatness now
[1:11:02] look at the difference my brother and
[1:11:03] sister right there in that verse some
[1:11:05] will speak because they view the things
[1:11:07] that god has done as terrible but we the
[1:11:10] bride of christ is there any eyes here
[1:11:13] this morning i will declare thy
[1:11:15] greatness i don't see these as terrible
[1:11:19] acts i see this as god moving me oh i'm
[1:11:22] not talking about what he did to the
[1:11:24] philistines the amalekites and this and
[1:11:26] that my brother and sister i'm talking
[1:11:28] about people bringing it back home in
[1:11:30] their own life and angry god because god
[1:11:33] did this and god did this and this has
[1:11:35] happened and this would be this way and
[1:11:37] when i go to church they talk about my
[1:11:39] sin i don't want to hear about my sin i
[1:11:41] want to hear about how great my god is
[1:11:44] i want a god that loves everybody no
[1:11:46] matter their condition well i've got him
[1:11:48] right here i've got him right here but
[1:11:51] my god is a god that changes my
[1:11:54] circumstance he doesn't sugarcoat my
[1:11:57] circumstance he doesn't make it look
[1:11:59] special he doesn't convince me that just
[1:12:01] because
[1:12:03] it doesn't apply to me
[1:12:05] no i'm sorry his word applies amen
[1:12:10] yes
[1:12:11] and they shall abundantly utter the
[1:12:13] memory of that great goodness and shall
[1:12:15] sing of thy righteousness
[1:12:18] the lord is gracious can we say amen and
[1:12:21] full of compassion and slow to anger i'm
[1:12:23] happy about that one
[1:12:24] and of great mercy the lord is good to
[1:12:27] all and his tender mercies are over all
[1:12:30] his works
[1:12:32] you realize even in moments of judgment
[1:12:36] we're preaching sometimes
[1:12:38] and and we're like ouch
[1:12:40] you know that was god's tender mercy
[1:12:43] when he took a chunk of height off of
[1:12:45] you
[1:12:46] that was his tender mercy
[1:12:48] that was him saying look you're my
[1:12:50] daughter you're my son and i know how to
[1:12:53] get you back where you belong
[1:12:57] hallelujah
[1:13:05] all thy work shall praise thee
[1:13:08] o lord thy saints shall bless thee
[1:13:11] they shall speak of the glory of thy
[1:13:13] kingdom and talk of thy power
[1:13:16] now let me just throw this right in here
[1:13:18] right now
[1:13:20] interacting
[1:13:22] with a brother from
[1:13:24] the continent of africa i'll just that's
[1:13:26] as close as i'll get
[1:13:30] sharing saints testimony of things
[1:13:33] that's happening amongst the young
[1:13:34] people in africa
[1:13:37] and i'm just going to blast this out
[1:13:38] because it we need to hear these things
[1:13:44] young people youth meetings
[1:13:46] the minister speaking them felt led to
[1:13:48] put this out i think i've spoke a little
[1:13:50] bit of this or at least spoke it to some
[1:13:52] people
[1:13:54] youth minister putting out a
[1:13:56] questionnaire
[1:13:57] anonymous to the young people
[1:14:02] and the young people by and large
[1:14:03] responded
[1:14:06] with what appears to be honesty
[1:14:11] over 90 percent
[1:14:13] caught up in some form of pornography
[1:14:18] over 70 percent i believe it was
[1:14:20] of young sisters caught up in the same
[1:14:25] music
[1:14:27] staggering number they know they
[1:14:28] shouldn't listen to that music but they
[1:14:30] listen to it
[1:14:34] this is not a denominational church
[1:14:36] they're polling
[1:14:40] oh these terrible children
[1:14:44] no sir
[1:14:46] no sir
[1:14:48] in many cases
[1:14:51] this is the older generation which
[1:14:53] unfortunately includes
[1:14:55] the majority of ministry
[1:14:59] has not recognized
[1:15:01] satan's onslaught
[1:15:04] against our young people
[1:15:06] we want status quo you come to church we
[1:15:08] preach at you you go home and live what
[1:15:10] we told you
[1:15:12] without realizing the influence of the
[1:15:14] world that we live in out here is so
[1:15:17] strong
[1:15:18] and our young people are so connected
[1:15:20] now look when i was a kid no one had a
[1:15:23] clue what was happening in south america
[1:15:25] in africa in asia in europe
[1:15:29] no one had a clue
[1:15:30] all we heard was the russians are bad
[1:15:36] we heard that a lot in school it's like
[1:15:38] when the russians attack us you take
[1:15:40] your desk and you shove it over here in
[1:15:43] the doorway and you crawl under it
[1:15:47] wait
[1:15:48] doesn't atomic bombs just vaporize
[1:15:50] things
[1:15:53] if that's the case why don't we just
[1:15:55] keep having class
[1:15:57] or instead let's just declare recess
[1:16:05] but look at the world now
[1:16:08] this brother shared with me he did a
[1:16:10] little
[1:16:12] he did a little research as it were
[1:16:15] it's called shoulder to shoulder
[1:16:16] research
[1:16:19] you know the kind that you get
[1:16:21] when you come
[1:16:23] maybe sit down
[1:16:25] shoulder to shoulder
[1:16:27] you come
[1:16:29] how you doing brother
[1:16:31] shoulder to shoulder
[1:16:35] research
[1:16:36] oh don't be afraid of the pastor don't
[1:16:38] be afraid of the preacher i'm on a
[1:16:40] research mission all the time
[1:16:43] yeah
[1:16:44] all the time saints
[1:16:45] i'm just being honest with you don't
[1:16:47] don't get nervous about it i'm on a
[1:16:49] research all the time the brother told
[1:16:50] me he said i just sidle over to where
[1:16:52] the young people the teenagers and early
[1:16:55] 20s are all out and he said they're not
[1:16:57] talking about the word they're talking
[1:16:59] about this new app and this new program
[1:17:01] and this knew this and this knew that
[1:17:02] and this deal that will do this and do
[1:17:04] that and how
[1:17:06] and he says you don't hear them
[1:17:10] and of course then he just blasted the
[1:17:12] young people of
[1:17:14] being terrible young people no let me
[1:17:16] tell you what he blasted
[1:17:18] he says our ministry has lost touch
[1:17:22] with our children
[1:17:28] come on
[1:17:30] but there's got to be a generation
[1:17:32] that's going to stand up why because the
[1:17:33] word said that if you'll train the child
[1:17:36] in the way he should go it didn't say
[1:17:38] there's no bumps no potholes no troubles
[1:17:40] along the way but in the end they will
[1:17:43] come back and stand on the foundation
[1:17:46] that they were taught oh parents let's
[1:17:48] get out of our distractions let's get
[1:17:50] out of all of our things we're so busy
[1:17:52] about and let's make sure our children
[1:17:54] are anchored in christ
[1:17:57] let it come to a place that we realize
[1:18:00] they are struggling and i'm going to get
[1:18:02] down we're not talking to a god way up
[1:18:04] in the ether my brother and sister we're
[1:18:06] talking to a god that will get down in
[1:18:08] the trench with us
[1:18:10] oh i want to serve a god like that
[1:18:13] amen i've been down in that trench and
[1:18:15] i've slogged through the mud and i've
[1:18:17] set in services where the preacher said
[1:18:19] if you're struggling with this or
[1:18:20] struggling with that then you must doubt
[1:18:22] who you are in christ no i believed i
[1:18:25] was a son of god man i looked around and
[1:18:27] i was still in the trench
[1:18:30] even though i believed i was a son of
[1:18:32] god
[1:18:34] lord help us
[1:18:37] i'll just throw this in don't feel sorry
[1:18:38] for me but as a child i backslid
[1:18:41] and my parents dealt with a certain
[1:18:43] family of certain individuals that
[1:18:45] literally looked my parents in the face
[1:18:46] and said you know i guess your son is
[1:18:49] not one of them because he's left us
[1:18:56] that's a real encouraging feeling
[1:18:59] yeah
[1:19:01] your parents must feel really good my
[1:19:03] son's backslid
[1:19:05] now these people are telling us there's
[1:19:07] no hope for him
[1:19:09] well i'm here to tell you quite the
[1:19:10] opposite i've got a god that declared in
[1:19:13] his word that he would preserve his seed
[1:19:16] he would hold his seed through the
[1:19:18] darkest of the night and through the mud
[1:19:21] of egypt and all of the things that we
[1:19:23] must face i serve a god that says i call
[1:19:27] them i will deliver them i can empower
[1:19:30] them and i will turn their life around
[1:19:33] in a heartbeat
[1:19:35] and he doesn't say just count on me just
[1:19:37] wait it out saints no don't worry about
[1:19:39] your children just let them do what
[1:19:40] they're gonna do they'll come back
[1:19:42] someday i'm not gonna sit there i have
[1:19:45] drove the post and i have posted the
[1:19:48] sign this is god's property no
[1:19:51] trespassing
[1:19:53] amen my god said i will preserve my seed
[1:19:56] i believe that word but my god also said
[1:19:59] i have raised up men who will stand for
[1:20:02] me who will defend me who will present
[1:20:05] me in the best possible life not just
[1:20:08] helter skelter not just as it were oh
[1:20:12] it looks like they're kind of doing
[1:20:14] wrong but they're preachers so they'll
[1:20:15] be all right whatever this no my brother
[1:20:17] and sister it said we ought to hide from
[1:20:19] the very presence
[1:20:22] the very image
[1:20:24] the very outline
[1:20:26] of sin
[1:20:29] oh god help us
[1:20:31] i say god help us saints
[1:20:33] amen
[1:20:35] amen
[1:20:37] to make known to the sons of men his
[1:20:40] mighty acts and the glorious majesty of
[1:20:43] his kingdom that kingdom is an
[1:20:44] everlasting kingdom and thy dominion
[1:20:47] endureth throughout
[1:20:49] all
[1:20:50] generations
[1:20:52] i'm telling you we look at the word the
[1:20:54] word says there's a chosen generation do
[1:20:56] we believe we're part of that
[1:20:58] amen now if we believe we're a part of
[1:21:00] that my brother and sister
[1:21:02] we must also believe
[1:21:04] that everyone
[1:21:06] of whatever ages
[1:21:09] has that same promise as we do
[1:21:15] you know there's a divining
[1:21:17] i don't know why i'm sharing this but it
[1:21:18] won't hurt us
[1:21:20] there's a dividing in the message
[1:21:24] i call it old school
[1:21:26] and i call it new ideas and people will
[1:21:28] say whoa no there's no new ideas yeah
[1:21:30] there is new ideas
[1:21:32] the new idea my brother and sister
[1:21:34] is as paul spoke
[1:21:37] i will be i can be i will be i should be
[1:21:40] all things
[1:21:42] to all people
[1:21:44] if i have to get down at a child's level
[1:21:46] then lord let me be humble enough to get
[1:21:48] down at the child's level if we're
[1:21:50] dealing with a brother who's more
[1:21:52] intellectual then lord please anoint me
[1:21:54] because that's going to be way beyond my
[1:21:56] position but let me be able to speak
[1:21:58] this gospel in such a fashion that
[1:22:00] intellectual brother can look at that
[1:22:02] and say amen that's nothing but the
[1:22:04] truth
[1:22:05] you see we have to come because when we
[1:22:07] get so solid locked into this is what's
[1:22:10] always worked we will lose a generation
[1:22:12] and let me put this i don't know why
[1:22:14] we're going this way this morning but
[1:22:16] i'll tell you in my generation in the
[1:22:18] message you will find there's not very
[1:22:22] many fit right in that generational gap
[1:22:26] because at that time they had a theory
[1:22:31] now some of you parents would agree with
[1:22:32] this theory or should be probably but
[1:22:34] anyway um you know just beat him into
[1:22:36] submission
[1:22:38] just beat them into submission
[1:22:41] give them the word test and if they
[1:22:42] won't receive it then they're serpent
[1:22:43] seed
[1:22:45] come on this is not a joke this is real
[1:22:47] i live through this
[1:22:50] in a church that had 50.
[1:22:52] my there's only like i don't know i'm
[1:22:54] not counting but there's like 60 or 65
[1:22:56] of us maybe here and we had 50
[1:23:00] young people
[1:23:02] and about 45 or 6 of those are gone
[1:23:06] there i believe some of them will come
[1:23:08] back
[1:23:08] i really do
[1:23:10] but you see that word test this is what
[1:23:13] you'll do and if you're not you're
[1:23:15] serpentine
[1:23:18] were they
[1:23:18] offended
[1:23:20] were those young people offended
[1:23:22] yes but no
[1:23:24] you know what they mostly were
[1:23:27] believers
[1:23:29] they believed
[1:23:31] what was preached to them
[1:23:35] they were preached that they were lost
[1:23:37] they were preached that there was no
[1:23:39] holding power for them
[1:23:42] they were preached that god's not
[1:23:43] interested in you
[1:23:47] and they believed
[1:23:51] i tell you what i want to do i want to
[1:23:53] preach to a group of people
[1:23:55] and i am i believe this morning
[1:23:57] that say i believe the word
[1:24:00] i don't believe a man's idea i don't
[1:24:01] believe this teaching over here i don't
[1:24:03] believe a theory i believe in the word
[1:24:06] of god it is real it is powerful and
[1:24:09] it's capable
[1:24:11] hallelujah it's capable to come and
[1:24:14] preserve the seed of sons and daughters
[1:24:16] of god
[1:24:18] amen
[1:24:20] amen the kingdom
[1:24:22] is an everlasting kingdom and thy
[1:24:24] dominion endureth throughout all
[1:24:26] generations now this verse 14 that's why
[1:24:28] i had to come this far the lord
[1:24:31] upholdeth all that fall
[1:24:34] and raiseth up all those that be
[1:24:39] bowed down
[1:24:43] hallelujah
[1:24:45] i'm glad
[1:24:46] my god
[1:24:50] oh
[1:24:51] my my oh my
[1:24:54] now
[1:24:55] as well look at this my brother and
[1:24:56] sister we still got a couple more verses
[1:24:58] to go here
[1:25:00] and i knew this would be about half a
[1:25:01] sermon so i've got four or five escape
[1:25:03] spots through the through the
[1:25:05] to the service here the eyes of all wait
[1:25:08] upon thee and now give us them their
[1:25:10] meat and due season
[1:25:12] did you catch that
[1:25:14] did you catch that
[1:25:16] you said brother paul you're the pastor
[1:25:18] you must be very spiritual no there's
[1:25:19] people in this church much more
[1:25:20] spiritual than i am
[1:25:22] but one thing i know is when the season
[1:25:24] comes from me god's going to give it to
[1:25:25] me
[1:25:26] if there's something i don't understand
[1:25:28] of the word i don't have to go i got to
[1:25:30] compare myself to this brother that
[1:25:31] brother that brother i in due season god
[1:25:34] said i'll give you the meat you need and
[1:25:37] that meat will be sufficient
[1:25:40] and so it's there my brother and sister
[1:25:42] god brings his dear children along and
[1:25:45] he knows how to keep us all in our
[1:25:47] correct you might say position and i'm
[1:25:49] not talking about you or this and you or
[1:25:51] that and you're under them i'm talking
[1:25:52] about the fact that in the word and
[1:25:54] revelation what happens is i heard a
[1:25:57] brother put it this way the minute we
[1:25:59] try to teach revelation we have muddied
[1:26:03] the water where one does not know
[1:26:05] whether he has revelation or not
[1:26:09] you don't teach revelation
[1:26:11] you preach the word god gives revelation
[1:26:16] and i desire revelation for each one of
[1:26:18] you and for myself but we have to just
[1:26:21] simply preach the word and let god do
[1:26:23] the work
[1:26:25] amen because we can start mapping out
[1:26:27] god right this one of the things the
[1:26:28] prophet of god now forgive me if you say
[1:26:30] i don't know where brother brown said
[1:26:32] that because you see sometimes i what uh
[1:26:34] he said i and i heard are the same but
[1:26:38] different
[1:26:39] and that would make some of you just
[1:26:40] tremendously nervous that brother paul
[1:26:42] would admit that what he heard and what
[1:26:44] he thought was different but you see god
[1:26:46] allows us as it were to come to a marker
[1:26:48] and as it would be going like through a
[1:26:50] strong concordance and this tied to this
[1:26:52] this tied to this this tied to this this
[1:26:55] tied to this and you make those
[1:26:56] references and sometimes some of us were
[1:26:58] coming along and bam
[1:27:01] and people say how did you get that out
[1:27:02] of that well it's there it's there it's
[1:27:04] just not by conventional wisdom that we
[1:27:06] find it but you look at this and see
[1:27:09] what god is doing god is bringing us to
[1:27:11] a place my brother and sister by
[1:27:13] individual revelation it becomes so
[1:27:16] anchored in our life the devil can't
[1:27:20] take it away
[1:27:22] what happens now i don't like to be
[1:27:23] negative and i've tried to remove this
[1:27:25] from my conversation so i didn't cause
[1:27:27] anybody to
[1:27:28] to stumble over this but my brother and
[1:27:31] sister collective revelation means that
[1:27:32] when your pastor fails the church fails
[1:27:34] with him
[1:27:35] that's collective revelation
[1:27:38] individual revelation says when the
[1:27:40] pastor fails we the church will rise up
[1:27:43] and claim him
[1:27:45] we will stand together and if he won't
[1:27:48] repent we'll still press on to the mark
[1:27:50] of the high calling that's what
[1:27:52] individual revelation does collective
[1:27:54] revelation tries to tie the whole church
[1:27:56] together if we all win we win together
[1:27:59] if we fail we all fail together
[1:28:02] sorry that's not this gospel
[1:28:04] amen this gospel is a powerful gospel
[1:28:07] amen that's come on the individual basis
[1:28:09] and it's good for us
[1:28:11] amen meet and do season thou openest thy
[1:28:14] hand and satisfy the desire of every
[1:28:16] living thing the lord is righteous in
[1:28:19] all his ways and holy in all his works
[1:28:22] that's why i get confused saints
[1:28:25] i don't know i'm off on a little
[1:28:26] different trail this morning i don't
[1:28:28] know anyway it's good
[1:28:32] the lord told me
[1:28:34] to do this
[1:28:37] get your bible out
[1:28:39] i can't find that anywhere
[1:28:42] the lord told me
[1:28:45] i'll bring it down to a subject that
[1:28:47] makes most of us nervous
[1:28:48] the lord told me to marry that girl
[1:28:53] nine years later
[1:28:54] the lord told me divorce her
[1:28:59] find that in the word
[1:29:01] i'll tell you where we can find it
[1:29:03] we can find it in the devil's bible
[1:29:06] we can find it in the devil's literature
[1:29:09] see what they've done is they've
[1:29:10] actually made a mockery of god because
[1:29:13] see he said here in verse 17 the lord is
[1:29:16] righteous in all of his ways and it
[1:29:18] would be unrighteous for god to tell you
[1:29:20] to do something that's against his word
[1:29:22] so god's never going as a prophet of god
[1:29:24] said god will never lead you away from
[1:29:27] his word
[1:29:29] but people utterly convinced stand on
[1:29:32] this and say
[1:29:34] the lord told me to do this
[1:29:37] good good
[1:29:38] i don't know what lord you're talking
[1:29:39] about was it a large capital l a little
[1:29:42] l uh was it just light you know people
[1:29:45] fall for all these things that the devil
[1:29:46] presents
[1:29:47] i mean if you don't think so my brother
[1:29:49] and sister
[1:29:51] just go back and look through the
[1:29:53] scripture
[1:29:56] look through the scripture
[1:29:58] aren't we all one
[1:30:02] aren't we all one just come worship with
[1:30:04] us you'll like our kind of worship no
[1:30:07] commitment
[1:30:09] we get to change whatever we want to
[1:30:10] change when we want to change it and and
[1:30:12] we can take and go back and say
[1:30:15] a prophet said it
[1:30:17] okay cool
[1:30:19] i believe you inherently paul's the kind
[1:30:20] of guy that's a tad bit naive just ask
[1:30:22] sister jerry
[1:30:24] paul's a tad bit naive i mean they call
[1:30:26] me up sir we want to we want to fix your
[1:30:29] bad credit and get rid of all your old
[1:30:30] debts just give us your credit card
[1:30:32] number and so scared him i believe him
[1:30:36] problem is i don't have any bad debts
[1:30:39] and my credit card's paid off every
[1:30:40] month
[1:30:41] so
[1:30:42] follow me here
[1:30:44] they passed the word
[1:30:46] test i mean they didn't pass the word
[1:30:48] test
[1:30:49] because they said
[1:30:52] so poor analogy wasn't that
[1:30:56] but the lord told me
[1:30:58] stop
[1:31:03] or in the day and age we live in
[1:31:08] zero quotes
[1:31:12] maybe i didn't get it right
[1:31:17] zero quotes
[1:31:20] oh i can word it another way
[1:31:24] you know when we first got the ego
[1:31:25] computing program
[1:31:27] oh i don't know why i'm going here i
[1:31:29] don't mean to be old home weak here
[1:31:31] we first got eagle computing program a
[1:31:33] lot of quotes
[1:31:34] we had been raised on sister jerry and i
[1:31:36] first got that program and it's like
[1:31:38] they said this type it in there nothing
[1:31:40] type this in here nothing type this in
[1:31:43] here nothing type this in here
[1:31:45] nothing
[1:31:47] and they are still saying the prophet
[1:31:49] said
[1:31:50] the prophet said the prophet said
[1:31:52] stop right there
[1:31:56] nothing
[1:31:59] come on
[1:32:01] don't let technology of saints
[1:32:04] take you away from the word let
[1:32:05] technology help you dig deeper
[1:32:08] into the word god gave it in this hour
[1:32:10] that we could dig so deep that no matter
[1:32:13] what the devil tried to do god said i'm
[1:32:15] going to make my word so available and
[1:32:17] we can say well this technology's bad
[1:32:19] technology is bad no the devil that
[1:32:21] introduced technology is the one that's
[1:32:24] the problem but we can use this for our
[1:32:26] benefit
[1:32:27] amen so you see the the lord is
[1:32:29] righteous in all his ways so he won't
[1:32:31] change his mind and he won't pervert his
[1:32:33] own word and holy in his works the lord
[1:32:35] is nigh unto all them that call upon him
[1:32:38] to all that call upon him in a caveat
[1:32:48] you want god to give revelation to you
[1:32:51] come to him in truth
[1:32:53] seek truth above all else
[1:32:55] because just coming to him is not enough
[1:33:01] yeah
[1:33:03] i'm remembering conversation brother
[1:33:04] trevor you and i just had recently
[1:33:07] powerful words
[1:33:09] powerful words coming from people
[1:33:13] that have no alignment with the word of
[1:33:15] god
[1:33:16] at all
[1:33:18] and you have to say what they said is
[1:33:21] truth they quote scripture they quote
[1:33:22] these things it's truth
[1:33:27] said that satan would come as an angel
[1:33:30] of light
[1:33:33] you know what i read i i i read way too
[1:33:36] much it's almost turning into a bad
[1:33:38] habit
[1:33:41] people are like oh yeah
[1:33:44] oh yeah
[1:33:45] that that light over the shoulder of
[1:33:47] william branham that's that that's that
[1:33:49] scripture that's that uh you know that
[1:33:52] light
[1:33:54] utter nonsense
[1:33:56] that light my brother and sisters people
[1:33:58] that are declaring i'm enlightened
[1:34:00] in the word of god and
[1:34:03] the whole world's not going to see a
[1:34:04] light my brother and sister whole
[1:34:06] world's not going to have light here
[1:34:07] light here like here coming to deceive
[1:34:09] them it's the light that they proclaim
[1:34:11] that they're walking in that they're
[1:34:13] declaring to the people that deceives
[1:34:15] the people and they hold to that because
[1:34:17] it was preached to them as truth
[1:34:22] i'm going to have a whole sermon right
[1:34:23] out of psalms here we'll have to
[1:34:25] have another part or something some
[1:34:27] other day or something
[1:34:29] amen he will fulfill the desire of them
[1:34:31] that fear him now i want to just bring
[1:34:33] this out to you saints
[1:34:35] anybody got a desire on your heart some
[1:34:37] things that are just very serious and
[1:34:38] dear to your hearts things that you you
[1:34:41] need you want you desire the lord to
[1:34:43] come and answer that i want you to take
[1:34:45] this scripture right here and i want you
[1:34:47] to hold on to this and if you need to
[1:34:49] highlight it record it come back and
[1:34:51] read it again and again and again
[1:34:54] listen to it whatever he will fulfill is
[1:34:57] no might or could be or something he
[1:35:00] said he will fulfill the desire of them
[1:35:03] that fear him he also will hear their
[1:35:06] cry and will save them
[1:35:09] now look at this here is the little
[1:35:11] qualifier quantifier that it puts on
[1:35:14] them my brother and sister all them that
[1:35:16] fear him and the lord says you know the
[1:35:18] fear of the lord
[1:35:22] the fear of the lord
[1:35:24] not just oh yeah i fear the lord
[1:35:28] and we'll tie this together and i won't
[1:35:29] make the cross reference for time here
[1:35:31] but it comes down to those that love him
[1:35:33] do what
[1:35:35] obey
[1:35:36] his word
[1:35:38] if you love me
[1:35:39] if you love me you know god's still
[1:35:42] answering that question
[1:35:44] he spoke it to peter peter do you love

[1:36:48] and take our own will with us

[1:36:54] as though we feel like we're cluttering
[1:36:56] the altar by leaving our self on the
[1:36:59] altar i got to clean up behind me my
[1:37:01] mama made me clean my room you know and
[1:37:03] i was taught in church you this and you
[1:37:05] do that no my brother and sister it's a
[1:37:07] time we come to a season that we realize
[1:37:09] god's here not to do away with you he's
[1:37:12] here to preserve you and in the
[1:37:14] preservation he brings us to a place
[1:37:17] those things that are detrimental we let
[1:37:19] god take those
[1:37:23] come on hallelujah
[1:37:26] the lord preserveth all them that love
[1:37:28] him
[1:37:29] but the wicked
[1:37:30] will he destroy my mouth will speak to
[1:37:32] the the praise of the lord and let all
[1:37:34] flesh bless his holy name forever and
[1:37:37] ever oh my oh my
[1:37:39] what happened
[1:37:40] where time go
[1:37:43] it's a beautiful scripture my brother
[1:37:45] and sister and i believe it describes
[1:37:46] our lord and savior
[1:37:48] now look i want to come and just touch
[1:37:50] for another minute or two
[1:37:52] here out of the book of jude
[1:37:55] jude the first chapter verses one
[1:37:57] through three
[1:37:58] jew the servant of jesus christ the
[1:38:00] brother of james to them that are
[1:38:02] sanctified by god the father
[1:38:04] and preserved
[1:38:07] in other words my brother and sister
[1:38:09] these people
[1:38:12] the thems of this scripture
[1:38:15] god come along and he poured a little
[1:38:16] preservative in them
[1:38:18] isn't that good
[1:38:20] but this is back to the original seed
[1:38:22] this is not sodium benzene and i don't
[1:38:24] know all these other names that i
[1:38:26] couldn't tell you god doesn't have to
[1:38:27] resort to something artificial
[1:38:30] are you with me
[1:38:32] he doesn't have to resort to something
[1:38:33] artificial to preserve the bride of
[1:38:35] christ
[1:38:36] he doesn't have to have a big
[1:38:38] beautifully gowned choir and people with
[1:38:40] exceeding talents and and only display
[1:38:43] the very best and do all this no god
[1:38:45] don't need that my brother and sister
[1:38:47] god's got a different kind of
[1:38:48] preservative that he's pouring into the
[1:38:50] bride is called the holy ghost
[1:38:52] amen and that's why when we get into the
[1:38:54] holy ghost my brother and sister it gets
[1:38:57] into us to put it correctly when it gets
[1:38:59] into us we're preserved and in that
[1:39:02] satan might buff it
[1:39:05] you know i've heard people misquote the
[1:39:06] scripture a couple times
[1:39:10] you know and that well anybody who's
[1:39:11] been tossed about
[1:39:14] they are double-minded
[1:39:16] i'd like somebody lift a hand and tell
[1:39:18] me today you haven't been tossed
[1:39:23] come on
[1:39:35] jude the servant of jesus christ brother
[1:39:37] of james to them that are sanctified by
[1:39:39] god the father and preserved in
[1:39:42] jesus christ no other place
[1:39:44] not church
[1:39:45] not a movement
[1:39:47] but i love this
[1:39:48] all of that preserved
[1:39:50] but then he brings this last portion and
[1:39:53] says wait whoa whoa just second let me
[1:39:55] quantify this
[1:39:56] you have to be called
[1:40:00] well praise god
[1:40:02] we've been members
[1:40:04] of the first free methodist church
[1:40:07] for six generations
[1:40:16] so what
[1:40:19] so what
[1:40:20] if you're not called none of that
[1:40:22] matters
[1:40:26] mercy unto you and peace and love be
[1:40:28] multiplied beloved when i gave all
[1:40:29] diligence to write unto you of the
[1:40:31] common salvation it was needful for me
[1:40:34] to write unto you and exhort you that
[1:40:36] you should
[1:40:38] go to church
[1:40:43] some people won't like me saying this
[1:40:45] but i'll say it anyway
[1:40:46] read your bible and pray every day
[1:40:50] still not the answer
[1:40:52] ingredient
[1:40:54] but not the answer
[1:40:56] right
[1:40:57] that you should earnestly contend for
[1:40:59] the faith which was once delivered unto
[1:41:01] the saints and my brother and sister
[1:41:02] these saints are not just the people who
[1:41:04] said we're christians and walked up and
[1:41:06] down the streets of jerusalem and
[1:41:07] bethlehem and uh you know all these
[1:41:09] places and my brother said no it's it's
[1:41:12] talk is cheap i'll just put it that
[1:41:14] simple sorry i sometimes revert back to
[1:41:15] this but talk is cheap we're christian
[1:41:17] we're christian we're christian we're
[1:41:19] christian but if the life doesn't align
[1:41:21] with the word your talk is not worth the
[1:41:24] heir it took to expel it
[1:41:27] no
[1:41:28] because you see my brother and sister to
[1:41:30] earnestly contend
[1:41:32] amen now look at this i want to go back
[1:41:35] now and to to tie in here just a little
[1:41:37] bit the definition of preserve
[1:41:40] to keep something in its original state
[1:41:42] or in good condition to keep something
[1:41:45] safe from harm or lost
[1:41:48] to prevent from decaying
[1:41:51] now you'd think i would focus on the
[1:41:52] first two parts of that but my brother
[1:41:54] and sister i actually want to focus on
[1:41:56] the third part of that definition
[1:41:58] because i want you to look around the
[1:41:59] world today and all of the holiness
[1:42:02] movement is doing what
[1:42:06] decaying
[1:42:08] they are giving up standards as it were
[1:42:10] that they said was tenets of faith
[1:42:12] they're giving them up right and left
[1:42:14] and they are not even ashamed of it
[1:42:17] but let's apply this not to them because
[1:42:19] we're not them and we are not going to
[1:42:21] be them we're going to stand on
[1:42:22] something more solid amen what did god
[1:42:24] do he come right down here saints and he
[1:42:26] said what i'm going to do is keep you in
[1:42:29] original condition i'm going to take an
[1:42:31] original word and bring it back to an
[1:42:33] original bride that's going to put a
[1:42:35] bride back in her original condition not
[1:42:39] a laodicean condition not a condition of
[1:42:42] the day the fashion and whatever else
[1:42:45] but an original condition the condition
[1:42:47] before the foundation of the world this
[1:42:50] word is going to take her right back to
[1:42:52] that and the devil's here telling you
[1:42:54] you're not measuring up you're not
[1:42:55] measuring up but god said i poured the
[1:42:58] preservative in you and the devil can't
[1:43:00] take it out and you are going to make it
[1:43:02] through amen you're going to rise up and
[1:43:05] you're going to stand before him and god
[1:43:07] himself says you're righteous and you
[1:43:09] are holy and you are mine
[1:43:12] oh hallelujah
[1:43:14] yes
[1:43:16] amen
[1:43:18] you should earnestly contend for the
[1:43:20] faith which was once delivered now some
[1:43:22] people would look at that once delivered
[1:43:24] as something long ago that no longer is
[1:43:26] applicable that religion culture all
[1:43:28] this has changed but i can't find
[1:43:30] anywhere in the word as the prophet of
[1:43:32] god spoke to them people when they said
[1:43:34] oh you're just caught up in an apostolic
[1:43:36] thing brother branham says i can show
[1:43:38] you where god put it into the word can
[1:43:40] you show me where god took it out
[1:43:43] amen
[1:43:44] hallelujah earnestly contend for the
[1:43:46] faith you know the word earnestly my
[1:43:48] brother and sister is seriously
[1:43:52] come on
[1:43:54] come on
[1:43:55] now if none of you had ever done this i
[1:43:57] would feel bad to preach this but you
[1:43:59] know what some of us have come to the
[1:44:01] church
[1:44:01] oh ah come on let's be fair all of us
[1:44:04] have come to church and we weren't in
[1:44:06] earnest
[1:44:09] we felt obligated to come to church
[1:44:13] now i'm excusing all things like
[1:44:15] migraines and stomach aches and the flu
[1:44:17] and covet symptoms and whatever else
[1:44:20] that might have hindrance in your life
[1:44:22] and you have a hard time struggling
[1:44:24] to focus and etc okay i'm not trying to
[1:44:27] be legalistic about this okay that'll be
[1:44:29] the way to put it i'm not trying to be
[1:44:30] legalistic but you see many of us have
[1:44:33] come you know i hate to say this but
[1:44:35] during the
[1:44:37] faithful going to church
[1:44:39] i was
[1:44:40] struggling
[1:44:42] very severely
[1:44:43] but knowing god calling me closer and
[1:44:45] closer every day
[1:44:46] you guys would be shocked how many
[1:44:47] farming problems i fixed in church
[1:44:51] i fixed tractors and i fixed this i
[1:44:53] remembered that
[1:44:55] is that earnestly
[1:44:58] no it's not
[1:45:00] that's half-heartedly
[1:45:02] that's uncommitted
[1:45:05] okay i just want to drive that home as
[1:45:06] we move on now contend interesting word
[1:45:10] here is to compete
[1:45:12] amen so earnestly compete
[1:45:15] i think that fits my brother and sister
[1:45:16] we should earnestly
[1:45:18] compete for the faith
[1:45:20] but i'm not competing against you have
[1:45:22] you ever noticed okay everybody buckle
[1:45:25] your seatbelt
[1:45:26] you ever notice when you carp on each
[1:45:28] other
[1:45:31] oh you guys are looking at me like what
[1:45:32] are you talking about you know what the
[1:45:34] word carp means
[1:45:36] on the street
[1:45:38] you're down in them you're dousing them
[1:45:40] you're digging them
[1:45:43] now you understand me
[1:45:47] sorry i reverted back just a little bit
[1:45:48] there
[1:45:51] have you ever noticed
[1:45:53] when you we do that come on you know
[1:45:55] what i'm talking about saints
[1:45:59] when we're digging at that
[1:46:00] is never
[1:46:02] at the moment you're earnestly
[1:46:05] contending
[1:46:08] when we are contending for the faith i
[1:46:11] see your faults and you see my faults
[1:46:14] and our first impulse lord i take this
[1:46:16] brother i take this sister before you
[1:46:18] lord come and move lord light the fire
[1:46:20] in them lord get them out of their
[1:46:22] doldrum lord bring them up into a place
[1:46:24] that they're not lukewarm they're not
[1:46:26] cold lord get them on fire
[1:46:29] but when we ourselves are down at that
[1:46:32] level the pastor this and this person
[1:46:34] that and they did this and this family
[1:46:36] did that my brother and sister let that
[1:46:38] be a thermometer that you use when you
[1:46:40] find yourself carping on people then
[1:46:43] just stop and say lord where's my
[1:46:45] temperature at because you'll find when
[1:46:47] your temperature is hot all you care
[1:46:50] about is god coming on the scene and
[1:46:52] helping them god coming on the scene and
[1:46:55] moving them but it's when we ourselves
[1:46:58] are cooling off
[1:47:00] oh some of you look at me um well look
[1:47:03] i'm going to tell you
[1:47:04] i can preach that because i have lived
[1:47:06] that
[1:47:08] and i lived it to a point to recognize
[1:47:12] that it can take you so low that you
[1:47:14] come to church and all you see that's
[1:47:16] right hypocrite hypocrite hypocrite
[1:47:19] hypocrite
[1:47:21] hypocrites here and hypocrites there
[1:47:24] hypocrites are everywhere i'm one and
[1:47:27] you are too
[1:47:32] yeah that's right
[1:47:34] but when we're on fire
[1:47:36] when we are earnestly contending
[1:47:39] and our head is down in prayer and we're
[1:47:41] pushing to the mark of the high calling
[1:47:44] my brother and sister you know i played
[1:47:46] a little bit of sports a little bit of
[1:47:47] football when i was just a kid not much
[1:47:49] mostly they just used me for some kind
[1:47:51] of blocking dummy and they had a lot of
[1:47:53] emphasis on the dummy part and but you
[1:47:55] look at that but i had a coach in little
[1:47:57] league football that he was like hey let
[1:47:59] put your head down you can't push
[1:48:01] looking around joe
[1:48:04] get your head down
[1:48:07] come on saints
[1:48:09] get
[1:48:09] your head
[1:48:11] down
[1:48:14] i see your fault i see your fault i see
[1:48:16] you from
[1:48:17] you can't
[1:48:18] press to the mark of the high calling
[1:48:21] with your head up
[1:48:23] get it down saints and i'm preaching to
[1:48:25] myself this morning get it down
[1:48:29] amen
[1:48:30] because there is the place that god
[1:48:32] wants us to come
[1:48:34] oh you know what we don't want to be i
[1:48:36] tried it once kind of person i tried
[1:48:38] having a prayer life and it just didn't
[1:48:40] work for me well i'm telling you got
[1:48:42] bigger problems
[1:48:43] amen now look we're now presently this
[1:48:47] is not past tense saints this is now
[1:48:48] presently uh called to press to the
[1:48:51] heart mark of the high calling to
[1:48:53] contend for the faith amen not to be
[1:48:56] arrogant you know my brother and sister
[1:48:57] there's those i'll just i hope this
[1:48:59] doesn't uh i hope none of you feel like
[1:49:01] i'm talking to you right now but there's
[1:49:03] going to be those that will never
[1:49:04] contend for the faith
[1:49:06] they are those that have a form of
[1:49:08] godliness but deny the power thereof
[1:49:11] they're the ones and we'll touch the
[1:49:12] scripture in a second that stand in the
[1:49:14] door won't go through themselves but
[1:49:16] won't let anybody else go through no we
[1:49:18] all know this message i've heard the
[1:49:20] critics say this i've had contact with
[1:49:23] people not that far in the past that say
[1:49:26] these things don't you know brother paul
[1:49:28] no one
[1:49:29] no one brother paul can live this
[1:49:31] message and i know they expected me to
[1:49:34] say oh yes we can but i said i
[1:49:36] absolutely agree with you and they're
[1:49:39] like what yes i can't live it but the
[1:49:42] christ in me has poured in the
[1:49:44] preservative and he himself is holding
[1:49:48] me up and i'm walking with him and you
[1:49:51] walk like a drunk man no i'm walking
[1:49:53] where he leads me
[1:49:57] but you see they never caught that
[1:49:58] revelation what it was to truly
[1:50:00] earnestly contend and they are there
[1:50:03] looking in their own flesh and they are
[1:50:05] a certain because they're living in
[1:50:06] their own flesh brother trevor that you
[1:50:08] must be living in your own flesh too but
[1:50:11] they don't realize that we are pressing
[1:50:13] pressing and it's not us but it's god in
[1:50:16] us pressing us and we are contending and
[1:50:19] i tell you it becomes something i tell
[1:50:22] you what you do sorry to bring it this
[1:50:24] way
[1:50:24] but you take a little kid
[1:50:27] you take a little kid and whatever it
[1:50:29] might be
[1:50:30] give him a tennis racket and he hits the
[1:50:33] ball over the net
[1:50:34] now if he never gets the ball over the
[1:50:36] net the kid's interest in tennis just
[1:50:37] dies
[1:50:39] but what if he's the one
[1:50:42] that hits it and it goes over the net
[1:50:44] that was cool
[1:50:46] give him another ball he hits it
[1:50:48] after 10 12 time you know
[1:50:51] it doesn't go over the net he doesn't
[1:50:52] care because he knows he can get the
[1:50:54] ball over the net
[1:50:55] amen
[1:50:58] fishermen we have a tried and true
[1:51:02] absolute
[1:51:03] fisherman here
[1:51:09] you know what it's like to sit in a boat
[1:51:10] all day
[1:51:12] not catch a fish
[1:51:15] you know it's like
[1:51:17] paul's one or two attempts at fly
[1:51:18] fishing
[1:51:19] oh you brothers that are critics of me
[1:51:21] about that i'm telling you i tried
[1:51:23] i tried
[1:51:25] but when all you can do is dig your
[1:51:26] little fly off the tree branches above
[1:51:28] you
[1:51:29] all day long
[1:51:31] or sit there for what turns out to be
[1:51:33] hours as you're trying to let's see that
[1:51:35] line went here
[1:51:37] and it went there oh i've caught
[1:51:39] something
[1:51:48] teach a kid to ride a bicycle
[1:51:51] no son of mine's gonna have a training
[1:51:53] wheel
[1:52:00] i don't need to ride a bike
[1:52:06] sons and daughters of god in the house
[1:52:08] of god you're a bunch of worthless
[1:52:10] nothings you're nothing you can be lost
[1:52:12] if you don't line up if you don't line
[1:52:13] up you're going to be lost after a while
[1:52:15] they decide being lost isn't quite as
[1:52:17] bad as they thought it was because
[1:52:19] they've never been showed that they can
[1:52:20] win
[1:52:22] they've never been shown i'm a contender
[1:52:24] come on i want it to be our young people
[1:52:26] have a revelation our old people have a
[1:52:28] revelation i'm a contender
[1:52:31] i'm not just in a house been in a race
[1:52:33] but i am a contender and i was called to
[1:52:36] finish this race i will finish this race
[1:52:40] and then god comes
[1:52:42] have you ever oh can i just have a few
[1:52:44] more minutes
[1:52:48] have you ever been in a spot in your
[1:52:49] life
[1:52:51] you prayed for something
[1:52:53] and you don't really feel like an
[1:52:54] overcomer you don't feel like a real
[1:52:56] winner you don't feel like a bundle of
[1:52:57] faith
[1:52:58] but you pray for something and it's
[1:53:00] personal to you nobody even knows
[1:53:01] there's been no prayer request there's
[1:53:03] been nothing
[1:53:04] and god comes on the scene and answers
[1:53:06] that prayer
[1:53:07] can anyone say amen to that
[1:53:10] it's happened to me i hope it's happened
[1:53:12] to you
[1:53:13] you know what god was doing
[1:53:15] he said well i don't know if my faith
[1:53:17] was sufficient god didn't really care
[1:53:18] about your faith my brother and sister
[1:53:20] because he is faith
[1:53:22] you wonder what faith is
[1:53:23] it's christ
[1:53:25] amen don't put it off as some other
[1:53:27] ingredient like the third person of the
[1:53:29] trinity or some other ingredient faith
[1:53:32] is christ without him there is no faith
[1:53:35] and with him all things are possible
[1:53:39] because he builds and brings that faith
[1:53:41] up that gives you the encouragement to
[1:53:43] take a hold of the word and so you pray
[1:53:46] a prayer and you don't feel spiritual
[1:53:48] god answers that prayer you know what
[1:53:49] he's doing he's showing you you can hit
[1:53:51] the ball over the net he's showing that
[1:53:54] you can do this and he gives you another
[1:53:56] opportunity and he gives you another
[1:53:58] opportunity until we come to the place
[1:54:00] that we should be
[1:54:04] where it's not even a second guess my
[1:54:06] baby's sick
[1:54:07] lay my hands i'm a daughter of god
[1:54:10] lord you said my baby's already healed
[1:54:12] and you said lord that you would give to
[1:54:14] these things that are here of the desire
[1:54:17] of our hearts and i desire my child's
[1:54:20] healing
[1:54:21] i'm telling you if we could correlate
[1:54:23] and put together as a form of data
[1:54:25] across the nations my brother and sister
[1:54:27] you would find that that is happening
[1:54:30] day by day
[1:54:32] it's not a rarity it is commonplace as
[1:54:35] it were that god is coming at the prayer
[1:54:38] of his saints and answering their
[1:54:41] prayers and you say but he's not doing
[1:54:42] it for me well maybe you need to change
[1:54:45] something
[1:54:46] instead of doubting the word
[1:54:48] instead of saying well you know maybe
[1:54:50] this doesn't work maybe you should stop
[1:54:52] and say it's working why is it maybe
[1:54:56] oh can i be just this straightforward
[1:54:58] maybe you're not contending
[1:55:01] maybe you're drifting
[1:55:03] maybe you're fl going with a flow
[1:55:06] not a contender you've gave up already
[1:55:11] hope that's not too
[1:55:12] too hard is it
[1:55:17] but those that are not pressing the
[1:55:19] battle
[1:55:20] i just declare to you today not
[1:55:22] arrogantly but if you're not going to
[1:55:23] press the battle don't stand in our way
[1:55:26] come on if you're going to come to
[1:55:28] church with a bad attitude a bitter
[1:55:29] attitude a evil spirit on you maybe you
[1:55:32] should skip that wednesday night or
[1:55:34] sunday morning if you're going to come
[1:55:36] with that on you
[1:55:38] because you don't need to hinder us
[1:55:40] we're going to contend is there any
[1:55:42] contenders here this morning
[1:55:44] amen we're going to contend so don't
[1:55:46] bring some alternate idea of this person
[1:55:50] said that preachers this and that my
[1:55:53] brother and sister that's just the devil
[1:55:54] let's call it what it is you say but
[1:55:56] they're nice people i'm sorry those
[1:55:58] spirits are not of god they're of the
[1:56:01] devil and all they're designed oh you
[1:56:04] say but well it looks like it might be
[1:56:06] true why don't you pray for them that
[1:56:08] they'll be delivered instead of bringing
[1:56:10] the attitude that they're the problem
[1:56:13] the devil is the problem
[1:56:18] but you see people won't submit to the
[1:56:20] word
[1:56:24] do i say it lord or do i not
[1:56:29] just reading this morning
[1:56:32] prophet of god said
[1:56:36] that christ
[1:56:38] and his church
[1:56:40] are one
[1:56:43] and the word
[1:56:45] are one amen
[1:56:48] and he said for
[1:56:51] because he's talking about the church i
[1:56:53] want you to get this in context
[1:56:55] if the woman says
[1:56:57] my husband and i are not one
[1:57:00] brother branham said that's
[1:57:02] an antichrist
[1:57:04] spirit amen
[1:57:06] you see what the devil's trying to do
[1:57:08] he's trying to bring us where we're not
[1:57:10] one with the word
[1:57:12] that's his whole goal when we don't have
[1:57:14] one with one another as it were and we
[1:57:16] don't have one with the word then we'll
[1:57:18] find ourself under the anointing of an
[1:57:20] antichrist spirit
[1:57:22] and that antichrist spirit the prophet
[1:57:24] goes on to say it won't be subject to
[1:57:26] anything
[1:57:29] oh
[1:57:31] our wives are so suppressed
[1:57:35] our wives are beaten down
[1:57:39] free of slaves on earth
[1:57:47] i won't go there some some of you i can
[1:57:49] tell i'm feeling a little pushback
[1:57:52] yeah
[1:57:54] yeah i'm suppressed
[1:57:57] i mean lunch and the amazon truck drives
[1:57:59] up

[1:58:08] come on i'm not picking on sister jerry
[1:58:10] but you catch the point
[1:58:12] you guys catch the point i'm talking
[1:58:14] about we talk about oh we're suppressed
[1:58:17] and those under that anointing out there
[1:58:19] are saying all those people believing
[1:58:21] the message believing that are so
[1:58:23] suppressed well i'll tell you how
[1:58:25] suppressed i am i pray god answers
[1:58:28] prayers amen you might oh forgive me for
[1:58:30] putting it this way it might be as it
[1:58:32] would be typed it might be the amazon
[1:58:34] package on the porch i pray god delivers
[1:58:39] i'm suppressed
[1:58:42] such nonsense why these spirits want you
[1:58:45] to be liberated to go celebrate satan's
[1:58:48] eden
[1:58:51] go satan's eden and god of this evil age
[1:58:54] yeah and be good for a church go listen
[1:58:56] to both of those you'll see this spirit
[1:58:58] that is creeping in and moving where
[1:59:01] it's like oh you guys are so suppressed
[1:59:03] you're so suppressed no i'll tell you
[1:59:05] what my brother and sister i'm not
[1:59:07] suppressed i'm preserved
[1:59:09] amen i would have fallen apart and been
[1:59:12] gone years ago the god has come rich in
[1:59:15] mercy and has preserved me then i can
[1:59:18] stand oh do you see a little flesh out
[1:59:20] of me
[1:59:21] yeah you see a little flesh out of me
[1:59:24] you come around my house
[1:59:26] yeah
[1:59:27] you'll see a little flesh
[1:59:29] i hate to admit it but i'm not going to
[1:59:31] hide it from you you'll see a little
[1:59:33] flesh but i'm telling you then god will
[1:59:36] come and he will stir my heart and i
[1:59:39] will go from my humanistic side and i
[1:59:42] will say oh praise god i'm a son of god
[1:59:46] i'm not some poor down trodden beaten
[1:59:49] person on the face of the earth with no
[1:59:52] hope i'm a son of god and that
[1:59:54] preservation power of the holy spirit
[1:59:57] rises up and you know it will only rise
[1:59:59] as high as i feed it
[2:00:02] if i turn around and start boo-hooing
[2:00:06] god's a gentleman
[2:00:08] he'll just let it rise to a point where
[2:00:09] you say oh praise god i'm saved
[2:00:13] i'm not saved
[2:00:14] no i'm not saved
[2:00:17] what brother paul
[2:00:19] no i'm beyond saved
[2:00:23] he didn't just come and say oh sister
[2:00:25] jerry's over here i shouldn't do this to
[2:00:27] anybody
[2:00:29] i like you
[2:00:31] remember when god told you he liked you
[2:00:32] the first time
[2:00:34] come on don't let the devil take that
[2:00:36] memory from you
[2:00:38] well it says i like you then god says i
[2:00:40] want to be around you a little more
[2:00:42] pretty soon god says how i want to court
[2:00:45] you
[2:00:47] come on are you with me
[2:00:50] and then one day he says you know i
[2:00:52] i'd like to for you to be my wife
[2:00:56] okay
[2:00:57] i'll be your wife
[2:00:59] okay i'll let you know when i want to
[2:01:00] get married catch you later
[2:01:05] oh you can't go date anybody else now
[2:01:07] you can't court nobody else you can't do
[2:01:09] nothing else cause you done told me
[2:01:10] you'd be my wife
[2:01:13] but he says no i'll never leave you
[2:01:16] i'll never forsake you
[2:01:18] i'll walk with you every step every
[2:01:21] moment
[2:01:22] of your life i'll be right there with
[2:01:25] you
[2:01:26] hey wait
[2:01:27] don't let your minds go carnal but he
[2:01:29] says i'll even be in you
[2:01:32] why because the heart has exchanged no
[2:01:35] there's a lot of people love a lot of
[2:01:37] people in the natural
[2:01:40] it's deeper than that
[2:01:44] it's christ
[2:01:46] we talk about him oh the holy spirit the
[2:01:48] holy spirit that's good my brother and
[2:01:50] sister but you realize he's also your
[2:01:52] faith
[2:01:53] you have nothing without him you have no
[2:01:56] ability to believe you have no ability
[2:01:58] to confess you have no ability to walk
[2:02:01] without him
[2:02:03] hallelujah
[2:02:04] oh sister emmy come
[2:02:07] my i get so excited about pressing on to
[2:02:09] this
[2:02:10] look at this now matthew
[2:02:15] matthew 23 and 13
[2:02:21] oh
[2:02:22] anyway matthew 23 13 says but woe unto
[2:02:25] you scribes and pharisees hypocrites
[2:02:28] for you shut up the kingdom of heaven
[2:02:30] against men for ye neither go in
[2:02:33] yourselves neither suffer ye them that
[2:02:36] that are entering to go in so we'll see
[2:02:39] my brother and sister that's all right
[2:02:40] we're good brothers that's all right see
[2:02:42] so you see what it is my brother and
[2:02:44] sister when we come to church i just
[2:02:45] felt led to come back and touch this we
[2:02:47] come to church
[2:02:48] and we bring spirits and we bring
[2:02:50] attitudes and we bring opinions and we
[2:02:52] bring all of this stuff in the house of
[2:02:53] god
[2:02:55] you know you know where we're supposed
[2:02:57] to leave that
[2:02:59] on an altar
[2:03:01] and you don't have to come to church to
[2:03:02] find that altar it's supposed to be in
[2:03:03] your heart
[2:03:05] so you know what it is i i just i don't
[2:03:07] know why i feel compelled to touch this
[2:03:10] but when we come in with that attitude
[2:03:12] we're not just ourselves well i had a
[2:03:13] bad day
[2:03:14] i had a bad day
[2:03:16] so you're going to make my bad day
[2:03:19] or their bad day
[2:03:21] or their bad day because that spirit
[2:03:23] that came in
[2:03:25] is having an
[2:03:27] but god said i'll preserve you
[2:03:30] you're not losing anything to admit
[2:03:31] you're weak
[2:03:32] not losing anything to admit that you
[2:03:34] have failed you're not losing anything
[2:03:36] to come and say lord i desperately need
[2:03:39] you
[2:03:40] lord i don't care what brother it is
[2:03:42] it's preaching on that night or that day
[2:03:44] i want you lord i got a quote to back
[2:03:47] this up those are you need quotes to
[2:03:48] back things up
[2:03:50] i got a quote to back this up my brother
[2:03:51] and sister you see coming in there the
[2:03:54] prophet of god says you're not looking
[2:03:56] to the man you're not looking to the
[2:03:57] minister you're not looking to the
[2:03:59] church you're looking to christ
[2:04:02] let that be what drives our lives
[2:04:04] amen oh hallelujah
[2:04:07] oh hallelujah
[2:04:09] you know i'll just save the rest of this
[2:04:13] you see the prophet brings out and you
[2:04:15] guys can maybe go study it out if you
[2:04:16] want and
[2:04:17] i ask the brothers not to steal a
[2:04:19] thought from me but they won't they're
[2:04:21] gentlemen
[2:04:24] look at this now my brother and sister
[2:04:25] in closing
[2:04:30] a lot of things are preserved around
[2:04:32] church
[2:04:38] traditions
[2:04:40] [Music]
[2:04:41] preserved
[2:04:43] [Music]
[2:04:44] i think it's kind of neat
[2:04:47] i say this positively no one
[2:04:49] misunderstood me please
[2:04:51] we have different cultures
[2:04:52] [Music]
[2:04:54] i just ate would that be considered
[2:04:56] curry
[2:04:57] last night
[2:04:59] just ate curry last night
[2:05:02] i was appreciative they said here sister
[2:05:04] nadia's like here brother paul this is
[2:05:06] what you use to cool it down
[2:05:10] so instead of denying and saying i don't
[2:05:12] eat curry because that's well i just
[2:05:13] don't do that i took the advice that was
[2:05:15] given to me and figured out that two or
[2:05:18] three big spoonfuls of this antifreeze
[2:05:21] because you know it's to keep from
[2:05:23] getting too hot
[2:05:25] will work
[2:05:30] but as we move forward
[2:05:32] my brother and sister
[2:05:34] the world is changing around us and i
[2:05:36] kind of feel bad because i didn't get to
[2:05:38] this quote
[2:05:40] i want you to think as we close the
[2:05:42] service out
[2:05:44] how much we're taking with us
[2:05:49] we have traditions
[2:05:52] that contradict the word of god
[2:05:55] you say what are those traditions well
[2:05:57] they can be religious
[2:05:59] a lot of them are religious
[2:06:01] you know a brother one time i won't
[2:06:02] throw his name out there so nobody can
[2:06:04] criticize him but he said we sure have a
[2:06:06] lot of message catholics
[2:06:09] we have a lot of message
[2:06:11] methodists
[2:06:13] a lot of message lutherans
[2:06:18] saints
[2:06:19] [Music]
[2:06:20] don't preserve those traditions
[2:06:24] cutting this short the prophet of god
[2:06:25] said those are the traditions
[2:06:28] that make the word of god
[2:06:30] of none effect
[2:06:32] [Music]
[2:06:34] we're new creatures in christ jesus but
[2:06:36] do you realize this is also a new gospel
[2:06:39] and i understand a statement like that
[2:06:41] could be like oh no that's not a new
[2:06:43] gospel but it is it's a new gospel my
[2:06:45] brother and sister
[2:06:46] as compared to our old gospel same bible
[2:06:52] and i'll go a step further
[2:06:53] same message
[2:06:55] [Music]
[2:06:57] the prophet of god
[2:06:58] taking us back to the coming of christ
[2:07:00] [Music]
[2:07:03] him appearing
[2:07:04] making himself known to you and i
[2:07:09] he said i no
[2:07:10] longer are you ready
[2:07:13] do we believe that god's got to change
[2:07:15] we're a new people we're not an old
[2:07:16] people and this is not an old message to
[2:07:19] us this is a new message to us and he
[2:07:21] declared he said i no longer call you
[2:07:25] church i now call you
[2:07:28] bride
[2:07:29] what is that
[2:07:30] imagine
[2:07:31] i don't know i i guess maybe some of us
[2:07:33] probably would do it
[2:07:35] but imagine i poor gabriella going to
[2:07:37] pick on her that she would just come up
[2:07:39] and say paul i need 50 bucks
[2:07:44] now i love gabriella she's like a
[2:07:46] granddaughter to me
[2:07:48] but she would have to give me
[2:07:50] a really really really strong reason why
[2:07:53] i should give her fifty dollars
[2:07:55] because she knows i'm a cheapskate
[2:07:59] but you know what happens when my wife
[2:08:01] comes and says i need fifty dollars
[2:08:04] i found out that there's no use arguing
[2:08:07] there's no use trying to get an
[2:08:08] explanation you just reach in your
[2:08:10] pocket you pull out your wallet and you
[2:08:12] just give it to it
[2:08:13] now she knows that that's actually my
[2:08:16] sign of disapproval because if i really
[2:08:18] approve i take it out and give it to her
[2:08:19] myself but this is my disclaimer you're
[2:08:21] going to have to take it yourself
[2:08:28] my brother and sister
[2:08:31] god didn't expect you today
[2:08:33] to have to wrench
[2:08:35] the promises of god
[2:08:37] out of his hands
[2:08:40] he said every promise i have given you
[2:08:44] i will fulfill you
[2:08:47] he's here waiting
[2:08:49] for us to just come and ask
[2:08:53] we've been preserved can we say amen to
[2:08:55] that today we're preserved
[2:08:57] let's act like the bride of christ let's
[2:09:00] act like the chosen let's act like we
[2:09:02] have been called my brother and sister
[2:09:04] my i'm trying to i'm trying to
[2:09:08] dive into all this stuff here hallelujah
[2:09:11] brother jason would you please come and
[2:09:12] help me
[2:09:13] i only got a couple songs here

[2:09:30] saints
[2:09:31] god bless you today
[2:09:33] i hope maybe by god's grace we say a
[2:09:35] little something that would stir your
[2:09:36] heart just remember
[2:09:38] no matter what the devil is saying to
[2:09:40] you today
[2:09:42] yesterday anytime
[2:09:44] god's already poured his preserving
[2:09:46] power into you
[2:09:48] you are standing here today secured by
[2:09:50] the word of god
[2:09:52] oh there's so many avenues to go into
[2:09:54] you know the title deed what is the
[2:09:56] title deed it describes what is already
[2:09:59] possessed
[2:10:00] you can't go down you know imagine what
[2:10:02] world we live in if you could go down
[2:10:04] the courthouse and say i just drove by
[2:10:06] this beautiful house out here with you
[2:10:07] know 10 acres and big beautiful horses
[2:10:09] roaming around in it and i want that to
[2:10:11] be mine so i want you to go in there and
[2:10:13] change the name on that
[2:10:15] imagine nobody'd own nothing because
[2:10:17] just in line at the courthouse it'd just
[2:10:19] be
[2:10:20] changing names but you see god come and
[2:10:22] says you know what i've already given
[2:10:24] you the title d
[2:10:26] what i need you to recognize nothing's
[2:10:29] changing that title deed
[2:10:32] you were mine you'll always be mine
