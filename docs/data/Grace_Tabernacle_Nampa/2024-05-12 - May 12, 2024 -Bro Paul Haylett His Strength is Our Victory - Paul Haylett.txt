desire amen have just uh first off I want to start happy Mother's Day amen that's just uh a lovely holiday uh we sure appreciate our mothers even our mothers that have passed before us uh have left an indelible Mark upon us and um our dear sister when I come walking out I looked out and I thought my am I seeing things or what but God bless you and welcome back amen God bless you so much amen so just happy uh for our mothers and thank you so much for you know as the scripture says that um it would be our our mothers our elders that would train our young daughters our young mothers uh and to present and you know it lays out a very clear picture um to be passed from generation to generation the example of godliness the prophet of God says you want to know what a church is look at the sisters and uh you know quite a quite a lofty uh responsibility but in a way it's not because see you're just simply living out the word and so you're an example to the younger that the word can be lived a as as a wife as a mother in this generation uh the word can be lived and we thank God for that amen there's not a question of is this possible we know it is possible to live the word in this day I say thank you Lord amen just a couple little things um that I have on my own little list here that I kind of forgot uh brother Sergey will be traveling uh a little later here I think our brother vasile I think we had a prayer request for him out on the road and um uh we want to just remember them as they are traveling the roads we want to remember our brother Victor um you know he's been taken into the Ukrainian Army and and uh I don't personally at this moment know exactly uh what his status is whether he's still in training whether they've done but what we do know is when the Holy Ghost is around you surrounding you that Satan can't touch you and we just want to make sure we lift our brother Victor up because uh fine brother I've been in his home eating at his table enjoyed his fellowship and uh he's just a wonderful brother and uh the impact also in all the Believers uh in in Ukraine and in Russia and any surrounding countries that there's influences uh we want to lift them up amen if that was happen happening to us uh we would certainly covet their prayers so let's be faithful to to lift all of the Believers uh it doesn't matter if they're identified in in a a church we recognize a name or location but simply the believer amen wherever they may be and as we know here in the United States sometimes for circumstances there are those that are you know end up in far away or far out you know um uh places uh and uh they they need our prayers just as much as as anyone else uh and um this just came in as a text I was actually silencing my phone because I'd forgotten and saw this text um brother Andrew boy scout's niece Kesha was involved in an ATV accident and has broken her hip in two places uh is being um uh medevaced uh to I believe Anchorage uh will need surgery so we just want to remember uh Kesha in prayer uh and certainly the Saints there uttermost Tabernacle um and truly brother Chris Brother David myself we've all been there it is the uttermost you know that you are in the middle of nowhere and uh so they they're doing good God's God's great my brother and sister you know in a world uh uh full of um different religions that are very opposed to the message God is still giving such a strong testimony that any kind of wedding and funeral and Etc they want the Believers to come sing because they acknowledge we feel the presence of God and that my brother and sister sisters never been behind the pulpit never preached a sermon but preaching the gospel and uh we thank the Lord for that uh so please remember those requests also and um we have a little mission report uh this morning uh so the church here has sent an offering to uh Vision books which is um that work that brother Barry Coffey uh is kind of behind or kind of uh directing and uh so he had sent out a a uh little notice or request here recently of the printing of 145,000 message books and um he you know it takes special kind of person I'm not sure I'm the guy that could just send a text out to the world and say send us your money but brother Barry has just a unique way of of going about that just reel forward we want your support and uh I just want to let you know that as um as a body of Believers that we have sent a a nice offering uh to the support of the printing of those books to be distributed um you know 145,000 book sounds like a lot but um it literally is just a drop in the bucket um you know the the message is is uh really taking hold uh in those countries where where it would be that um we would think that it might not no message in their language many many of them don't have Bibles their Pastor has a Bible but they don't even have a Bible and uh but yet the truth Finds Its resting place and they're able to take a hold of that and how they Rejoice uh I've seen a couple videos that uh when uh you know sometimes I don't know how how our church would react if people really got speaking in tongues and dancing in the spirit but I'm telling you these people got to getting excited and dancing and happy cuz they've been handed the first Bible they've ever laid their hands on in their life and they're excited and some just I'm sure respectable sisters you know aged sisters you might say Amen not not just that and just to see them weeping as they dance in a circle holding their Bible amen and uh when's the last time you did that that's it we got spoiled amen let's not let our spoiled situations keep us from rejoicing that we have the word of God Amen so amen well we have something very awesome this morning I thank the Lord for this uh uh the Lord blessed our brother Chris sister Kristen with a wonderful little man and um he's such a peaceful child or at least when I'm around him he is I don't know if he's just always that way is just pretty much always that way amen and um so we're going to have a dedication this morning with a slight twist brother Chris just felt upon his heart just prayed about it felt upon his heart and had the desire to dedicate his own son and uh I think that's wonderful in his office as a minister to be able to step over into that and be able to hold his own blessing from God and commit them back to the Lord and so we just invite brother Chris sister Kristen why don't you just drag the children right up here with you amen cuz we're not as individuals right we look at the scripture and we see the family unit we see all through scripture the family unit bring them in oh bring them in bring the little one to Jesus oh bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to [Music] Jesus amen just wanted to first thank the Lord you know we we were always praying for Christen and tough pregnancy but it I was thinking about it and every doctor that checked him every time they checked him he said man he's so healthy so for God to to see Kristen through the pregnancy and then to have the baby born amen just spotless in this thing so um we named him aliser Owen take and aliser means his Scottish and means defender of the people and Owen we named in honor of Brother Scott whose first name is actually Owen but um and Owen means Noble well-born or young Warrior so um we just want to pray that the Lord would harness him at a young age and uh turn that meaning into something for the gospel let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Lord just thank you so much for this gift you've given us Lord Jesus and father we know that uh Satan already is waiting at the door Lord Jesus and but father father you are the one in control you are the one who called us to this position Lord Jesus who called this young man into the world and father we as a gift to us we give him back into your hands Lord and we ask father in The Wicked world that we live in he would grow Lord Jesus to be just like you Lord Jesus a reflection of your spirit a reflection of you father to the to to each one of us and the rest of the world around him Lord I pray you would just put strength into Christen and I Lord father as you would just call us to this place I pray you bless him Lord Jesus now as we dedicate him in your name in the name of Jesus Christ and we give him to you Lord may you have all preeminence in his life and full control we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen thank you Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah wonderful what a privilege it is and Amen to to just see another one you know that the Lord has promised and we just believe as this dedication as the prayer is said that he would serve the Lord all the days of his life and be a great example grow up as a young man that the world you know is is so afraid of being different unless it's their different but we want to be different to represent our Lord Jesus Christ The Life of Christ amen let's just stand as we would just go into our thought for the day uh and thank you musicians and thank you brother Alex I always enjoy amen the music God has blessed us considerably amen pray He blesses those that make the sacrifice uh to to uh give themselves amen I want to speak to you this morning on the topic of his strength is our Victory and uh let's turn in our Bible if we would to Psalms 46: 1-3 and uh just pulled in into these thoughts just feel like it's obviously the inspiration of the Lord that he would come and speak to us sometimes you know you can find your your mind just kind of blank you've been pondering Lord uh what would you like us to speak and what would be the thought or the topic Lord would it be something that would Bless the people uh you see my brother and sister I think any true minister of the Gospel any real True Believer uh we we don't want to focus on oursel as though that we have have something to accomplish that we have something to be lifted up about but we're constantly seeking what is it that would bless the body of Believers because when the whole body is blessed my brother and sister and we are identified in that body we are blessed we don't have to go seek our own personal blessing we have a blessing because we are part of this body and I thank God for that today amen Psalms 46 1-3 God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble can anybody say Amen to that yes sir therefore will not we fear though the Earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof Roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof silah Heavenly Father we just ask you to be here in this service Lord we thank you for this time to come together as Saints Lord a little sickness has passed through our midst but we rebuke that in the name of Jesus Christ as Sons and Daughters we stand up Lord we claim our healing and believe father that you are looking upon us father smiling and blessing us as we walk in this life father we thank you today and we ask in the name of Jesus Christ bless this amen you may be seated you know I I just was having a little word with sister Jerry in the basement and sometimes you know the devil that Sly old Fox and I sure appreciate the song being uh sung the other day it was beautiful uh but we'll look at this and how Satan would desire to come and the Very things that we believe the very things that we hold dear to our heart Satan would like to come and just anoint a circumstance now this is not an as would be anointing upon our life that would be for months and years although that's possible but just in a circumstance we can come to a place that that we feel as though there is something out of kelter we feel that something's lacking and and we have something we're nervous about situations whether it be with children marriage uh economies Etc that that just weigh Upon Our conscience and and wear at us a little bit and I I think that if we could fully Embrace verse one Amen in all things of our life and just remember in the time of trouble he's our refuge and strength and he is our everpresent amen help in the time of trouble help in trouble and you look at that my brother and sister I think sometimes we we just get a little nervous and we start to try to deal with the situation and unfortunately as the way I'll put this is often times God is our last resort instead of our first that's we should be from the very beginning speaking to him saying Lord I commit this problem to you but the human element and I don't know if this phases you like this but it does me that the human element does everything it can do to try and fix the problem and then when we realize I can't fix this we go to the Lord my how we have that backwards amen that we should be going to the Lord first and there is no second alternative amen and when we'll take the place we say well we have faith well let's have faith enough just hand it to the Lord now that doesn't keep you from praying over that situation uh you know again repetitiously as it were continual that way but there's nothing wrong we see in the scripture examples nothing wrong to come and lay that petition back before the Lord but we're not Beggars you notice Beggars tend to be very repetitious I need you I need you to give me give me give me give me give me that's not how we approach the Lord we approach him as Sons and Daughters we approach him as a promise already given I love the little story about the brother that uh told his son uh that if he would help him do the yard work they had quite an extensive yard he says son if you help me do the yard work today uh you know I'll take you for an ice cream and you can order whatever you want so quite quite large there they labor in the afternoon sun and they get all done the dad is quite honestly he's just wore out and showers and sits down and uh pretty soon you know here comes the son and he's standing there by his dad and finally his dad says uh son uh what is it and he says remember the promise dad puts his shoes on puts a family in the car takes him down for his ice cream you see the boy didn't have to beg his father the promise had already been given and God is faithful amen and we are not here to be Beggars amen amen but you know wouldn't this take away a lot of anxiety in our lives if we would just simply approach the father and say remember father there's a promise and I I'm here to now collect upon the promise now I want your will to be done I want your timing to be done I don't want to dictate those things but I'm here for the promise I'm here to claim what was promised to me amen and so you know as the word says here you know that he is our refuge and our strength and as will do this if we'll realize that we are hidden in Christ there's our refuge amen we shouldn't have to in the time of trouble run to the Refuge we really should already be in The Refuge that's where we're called to stay amen and so as we would be there in the Refuge hidden in Christ uh we realize then our strength is not our own we are not here and going to serve God till our strength runs out our strength is in the Lord and so if we get away from that human element and maybe I'm just preaching to myself this morning but my brother and sister there comes a time that we say Lord I want more faith well maybe faith is just giving it to the Lord amen maybe not you know I laid my hand on it and the supernatural came and so it shows I've got faith how about we have faith by just giving it to the Lord and trusting that what he has said he will fulfill and as this comes we are looking and I would say this as Believers you know uh what separates us I believe a little bit from the rest of the religious world my brother and sister is we have a very very clear promise in front of us we're not preaching of a Jesus Christ 2000 and some years ago we're preaching about the Christ that's in you present this morning living with power amen amen not not just you know as it is just something vag out there but a very real promise that is coming to pass because the word said amen that's all it's got to come down to we don't even have to go back and say well brother brandham said brother Bram said the word said because he preached the word the word said and we're standing here on the promise of the word in this hour knowing that if we will just simply reach up and take a hold to the promise it will come to pass the limiting factor is not God right it's clear that we're relying on God in this crazy age everywhere you look my brother and sister you cannot even hardly go into town why do I use that term you don't have to go out your door and you see the craziness of the world and it's getting crazy by the day and my brother and sister as much as they try to rain the craziness in it just pops up somewhere else you know it it's uh it's something I I share this story was shared with me a secondhand story but uh very reliable source uh um a father his daughter was in school and all this things about identifying as animals and whatnot and his daughter got a set of fuzzy little ears in a tail and she started wearing it everywhere and she says I'm a cat the dad had told her take that nonsense off she saids no dad my identity is a cat finally one day he'd heard enough of this he went to school for a parent teacher meeting and he looked around and there was all these kids with these crazy costumes and he's like what is happening that Saturday day he went down to Walmart bought a tent a sleeping bag a water cooler a pillow some other articles and he asked his daughter if she wanted to go for a drive and he drove up into the White Tank Mountains north of Phoenix they found a nice spot and he unloaded all this and he set up the tent and he did all this and the daughter's like what are you doing Dad she said well cats live in the wild that's right and he says so if you're going to be a cat this is where you're going to live cats also feed themselves he no more got the cat set up and he looked over and the daughters taking the ears off and taking the tail off and looks him in the face and says I'm your daughter now my brother and sister we are not here to take on the spirit of leod deia which is this uh this crazy I won't even go into it today to be definitive but these crazy spirits that are religious Spirits are spirits that are are wanting you to acknowledge there is a God but not acknowledge God and that's what the world is doing today they they'll acknowledge there is a God to be a Christian you have to acknowledge there is a God but they don't want to acknowledge God but my brother and sister we're not here to put on ears and Tails and other identities then call oursel this that and the other together we're here to say we are Sons and Daughters of God which means I have and you have his DNA in you amen directly identified and if we are the word for the day what will be the manifestation of our life the word amen not some crazy outside spirit amen my brother and sister I won't go into it but just recently a little situation where they had a men's Minister meeting and just absolutely the carnality of this world is on display right there and when a man was spoke out against it they called him out of order this the world we're coming in amen and we would look and wonder Lord can this be but you see we're hidden in Christ our refuge is him our refuge is not the message my brother and sister as some would identify it amen Jesus Christ is the message amen but to to identify it as we're not Baptists we're not methodists we're we're the message my brother and sister that's not our refuge our refuge is in Jesus Christ and so it all depends on how you want to identify or use those words to bring Clarity and our strength is definitely not our own amen how many times have we come to a point we just felt like it's Sunday morning I'm tired I I'm just staying home I'm I'm not going to go to church church I I don't feel like it amen hallelujah some of you are smiling how many of you felt that way this morning yeah but it's not because we have a job to do no that's right it's because ultimately down inside of us something says I want to be in God's presence and I want to worship with the Saints amen these are those I believe God has called me to worship with and even in glory I believe that we will be mingling as it is in that realm to to to associate with one another just my thoughts on that but we look at that and there's something down inside of you that reacts in that time of weakness discouragement I know you probably don't get discouraged my brother and sister but discouragement is a tool of the devil amen and he just wants you to believe that it doesn't matter anyhow he'll bring us to such a place that we will actually believe that amen but he is our answer he's our help in this time of trouble and we have to remind ourselves of that you say brother Paul this is seemingly just simple stuff yes it is but if we don't remember to remind ourselves or put ourselves in an atmosphere to be reminded had a brother just reach out to me doesn't live here and he said brother Paul if there's something I can do for you to help you to make your burden just a little bit better you know what I told him brother if something comes up I'll let you know but you know what I should have said to him pray for me just keep praying for me brother that's the greatest help that there can be ever be done you might come to the farm and you might lift a heavy burden or something to help me through that or clean up a mess or mow the lawn or something that's wonderful but what really makes a difference is when we pray for one another amen when we draw the presence of God around one another when we come into that place that we know because I prayed that the Lord has come to church with my brothers and sisters I believe the power of prayer that strongly that we can pray and make a difference in each other's life amen amen and often times we're worried about this I hope this is not offensive but we're too busy praying for ourself amen we're too busy saying you know what I I feel so tired I feel so discouraged Lord I need you to touch me Lord I need you to this Lord I need you to do that Lord I need this but if we'll settle in and start as it were pick one end of the valley or the other end or side to side just start praying for the Saints no you don't got to try and figure out where their bank account's at and where their faith is at and what their circumstance is all you've got to do is get down and say Lord I want you if you would be so gracious come to this house speak to this brother speak to this sister speak to these young people Lord in the way that you choose am and make a difference Lord remind them who they are amen hallelujah am because you see in his strength we find Victory it's not in our own I don't know about you there's one day you know talking about mountaintops we spoke on Wednesday you know there's days my brother and sister you can be on the Mountaintop and in the valley within 10 minutes you can we can run headlong down the mountain oh everything's coming apart oh my marriage oh my children oh the church and next thing we know we're in the bottom of the valley and then we'll say how did I get here but to get out of that Valley requires effort sweat tears boy you guys are quiet maybe we could assure the preacher today how many of you have ran headlong into the valley absolutely yeah Hallelujah and those of you that didn't lift your hand I'm going to raise my hand for you because it's just a fact that we do amen now as we look at this we'll see my brother and sister he's our help in a time of trouble that would be describing a traumatic time or traumatic event and we'll see that it often takes place you know you can have trauma atic things happen in the church in the world and in our own lives traumatic my brother and sister it's traumatic and how many times have I seen when you know chaos comes earthquakes come tsunamis come that that the church fills back up people you haven't seen for quite a while show up in church because the trauma shakes them down to the very core of what they actually believe but they don't have what it takes to stand up and say you know what I'm going to live what I believe it's a paradox I believe this I just don't have the willpower to live it in Chile a brother give us a very chronological timeline of the nature of what happened in Chile when they had that great earthquake in the 60s the churches filled back up and Revival lasted several years but tapered away and then the next time they had a major earthquake the church is filled up again but not quite as full and it repeated again and again what was the year that we were there Jerry 2010 the tsunami swept it was big enough large enough we're not talking about a little sweep up on the shoreline Saints large enough to move ocean liners into the middle of the city and the people stood in the streets and cursed God see how the transition from the early 60s to 2010 they went from crying out to God for Mercy to standing in the streets looking to the heavens and cursing God we see what trauma can do we know in our own life each one of us would have something that we would call A traumatic event and it doesn't matter if it takes place in the church in the world or in our own life he promised in this darkest of times he was with us now we either believe that he's with us today my brother and sister or believe he might hear us the prophets of Baal often wondered about that in the scripture how God viewed Elijah mocking them yell a little louder perhaps he is hunting he's traveling he's sleeping yell a little louder but our prayers my brother and sister aren't based the answer is not based on how loud we pray it's not based on how long we pray it's based on our faith that he will answer that prayer there are those that I have met through the years that have been in multitudes of brother bram's meetings and little things that were shared to realize that people who come through the prayer line when they were standing there in the presence of the Angel believed but had already lost you might say their healing their faith before they ever got off the platform and when the critic would look they'd say he prayed for them declared them healed but they weren't that's false but you see my brother and sister it's not a matter of what brother brandham prayed and God answering that prayer what is our faith right what is our belief do we really believe you can say in context we're healed do we really believe that the word is coming and delivered us from Le oysa if it's based upon Our Own Strength we will be those who have lost their healing before we make it off the platform amen but when we simply have a strong faith unshakable unwavering in our Lord Jesus Christ it does not matter my brother and sister what we see what we hear what we feel it doesn't matter what the circumstance around us is is we're not trusting this flesh we're trusting the Lord Jesus Christ am and when we hold on to that he said I Am with You amen I Am with You amen hallelujah so what does it do have any of you I hope I'm not preaching too personal today but I guess it's kind of my style so but uh you know have any of you ever felt like you just were kind of bogging down beling down just seemed like you know one day after another it was just a little more difficult than the day before and it's like Lord am I really even saved you know maybe the minister would say something and you're like well I don't see that in my life and and you start to question you start to ponder and you know you just say ah lord I can't but then one little thing comes it might be in your prayer time it might be in a song in a tape in a reading your Bible and one little thing comes and something gets a halt of you and you suddenly find your strength I am not going to settle in the pit I'm going to rise from this I'm going to believe the word I'm going to act on this word and something in just a few moments the whole atmosphere changes and you look back and say now that had to be the devil yeah that wasn't me that was the devil amen do you relate yes sir so look how the devil's doing this he tries to cut our strength our faith in the very word that was placed in you and I in the beginning he tries to sever that link cuz if he can sever that link than all the promises of God that had been given Daddy I'm here for my promise amen all that is severed and that little boy imagine at that age you know 10 12 years old and Daddy doesn't buy him the ice cream and then the next time daddy says son help me do the yard work he's going to be reluctant to do that because my dad does not keep his promise but when we come and take a hold of that promise and say that promise was promised to me I don't know about you guys okay don't take it personal I don't know about you but I know what God promised me he said I'll never leave you Paul I'll never forsake you Paul I'll be with you even to the very end and that's my promise maybe you have one just like it amen but if I can come to the place that I say God I'm certain you have forsaken me what happen the next time the Holy Spirit urges us to do something we're reluctant maybe evangelists would come and say come be prayed for and we won't get out of our seat because nothing happened last time not realizing that we were the limiting factor but I'll say this we have not made it this far on our own strength that's right our strength as you could see the whole picture our strength has run out years ago well especially those of you that have joined the elite club of the over well we won't even go to that number but your strength ran out years ago he's been carrying us amen he's been you might say propping us up for years my brother and sister not for moments years now the scripture is talking about Godly counsel I like Godly counsel amen amen scripture tells us that there's wisdom in the multitude of counsel not just numbers got 10 guys eight of them don't know what they're doing no that's not the kind of counsel you need you need counsel that can look you in the face and say now this is what the word says brother this is this where we're at brother amen or sister amen so he's talking that's why the Aged mothers are there to counsel the younger because you see there's times in our life we simply don't have the experience I'm telling you my brother and sister I remember quite vividly the first time I ever prayed for somebody that just outright had a devil on them and I spent about 2 seconds praying for them and I prayed the rest of that time for the Lord to give me enough Faith to break through whatever this Spirit was and to lay something on that person because when you have someone that has a demon on them they're not there praying the prayer of faith my brother and sister they're there if they're in the altar it's because they know they're in a desperate place and so you can't really call that faith and sometimes someone has to be able to break through right we bind our faith together and you break through that spirit and when you see that when you see what happens in that case a sister going to go out of church that day had her mind made up already had tied the Rope to the to the deck on their house was on the edge of a Ravine and already tied the Rope to the post of the deck going to go home from church and literally when the husband and the children are in the house she was going to walk out there put that around her neck and step off the deck made her mind up absolutely convinced and you come there and you go to pray for them and you're buffing in and you're buffing and you're like something's wrong here I don't know what's going on something's wrong here Lord help us to break through we need you Lord and you don't know whether it's just she's got a health problem a marriage problem a child problem you don't have a clue but what you know is you can't push through it and then all of a sudden something happens and a little sister goes home shoes the children in the house takes her husband out and says let me tell you this story before I show you what I show you God delivered me today amen I've been set free today that spirit that H me the doctor said it was postpartum depression call it what you will it was a devil that's right but God rich in Mercy amen said you know what my strength amen the Lord speaking my strength is going to be your Victory amen and that sister the next time we seen him had been a while down the road she was set free complete it wasn't for a day a week a month my brother and sister but her husband he he he was so shaken when he told me he says when she took me over there and right behind flower pot the Rope coiled up that devil thought he had found Victory but all he found was defeat because that sister is a daughter of God Amen and she held to that amen when those kind of spirits come in our neighborhood in our house in our car my brother and sister that's the time for us to cry out Lord your strength is my victory and I know you are strong you are powerful you're wonderful you're gracious you're glorious you're my God God Amen I'll tell you what my brother and sister if you want to just get carnal aspect he invested in you he's not going to waste that investment he put the word in you and he said his word can never return void so when he put his word in you it's time for us to say Lord let the word come forth amen not my emotion not my feeling not this not that you know it's not a conflict between this family that family this person and that person it's a conflict between God and the devil and Christ is in you and the devil hates that and because of that he hates you but you know I think the devil just hates you know when you got friends that drink two cases of you know I mean like a case of beer two two deals of beer every night they smoke two packs of cigarettes every day serve the devil Faithfully can you say he loves them no sir no sir I think he hates equally but he hates you especially because he recognizes the word in you amen hallelujah Psalm 73:24 this rate we're going to be here a while Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterwards receive me to Glory is't that beautiful amen amen the Lord's giving you and I counsel today my brother and sister because he's setting the stage for you and I to be in glory it's not for us to be here and say well I'm just trying to be a Christian and it's so hard and I feel like I sacrifice so much what a lie of the devil don't use a word of sacrificing fleshly lust and not sacrificing that oh oh as though you're sacrificing that to the Lord my brother and sister I'm telling you what you're doing he's just flat delivering you of those spirits that were T tormenting or demeaning your life that's simply what he was doing amen Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterwards receive me to Glory Glory whom have I in heaven but thee and there is none upon Earth that I desire beside thee My Flesh and my heart faileth but God is the strength of my heart can you say that with me but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever am amen forever my brother and sister eternity thank you Lord a heart it's fortified you realize what's fortifying your heart yes sir what's fortifying your heart is all of what God is exactly right that's why I love the Book of Esther so much that when she went was so compelled by the word by Christ God himself living a Godly uh uh testimony for us to look at in this day and when she prepared herself she wasn't bed dangled or or whatever they call that you know when all kinds oh he'll like all the flashy stuff she went in there in the Simplicity of the Gospel which is called Holiness and she presented herself and they said Esther if you go in there without invitation and he rejects you you will never see the King again but see she had a different Revelation she knew who she was and that Revelation played itself out right there when he saw her he didn't look at her and say there's a queen he looked at that and said that's my wife and my wife is a part of me and he wasn't worried about common law state laws or divorce court she comes and he says I give to you half right let's put this in the right context not half of everything I own this and that and that and that and I give you half of who I am amen amen half of who he was now my brother and sister the Holy Ghost has been poured out we're standing here with absolutely a husband's promise to a bride amen and we'll settle for a portion of that we settle for a token amount a percentage let's settle for all that God promised amen that's right amen he promised I'll give you the Holy Ghost and I'll fill you and not only the things that I do but you shall do these also amen and when you translate those words they say it means and more can I give you an ouch you still love me are we pressing into that that's question are we pressing to the place that all that Jesus Christ is that's it amen we're taking the portion granted to us amen now the prophet comes along and says if you go out to the ocean and you dip one little scoop or Dipper of water out of the ocean it has every quality every mineral everything that's in the ocean is in that little portion and I say my brother and sister Lord help me and I'm speaking to Paul this morning but I think that we have come along and said that portion is not for me and I can't live this portion and this one here I felt before or experienced before but it just seems too much for someone in my position my brother and sister drink the picture amen drink it drink the water of the word amen take that portion because his strength is our Victory sir we don't need the whole ocean we don't need to travel the world we don't need to be able to stand up and say I have such great faith I don't even want that to be in my vocabulary I just want it to be that's my husband and I'm going to go to my husband and he's not going to reject me or throw me away he's going to say come even to the half of my kingdom to the half of who I am because the these two are one amen that's it right where do we sever the line where do we say well I'm a pretty good Christian or I'm almost a Christian or I'm trying to be a Christian you are a Christian because Christ is in his body he's in his church he's in his word he's in you well I don't think I have enough faith for the Rapture you don't even know how much faith it takes for the rapture remember kids when we did the corn in the little egg cups a cotton ball not even dirt put the seed in the cotton ball so is the life this could be an arguable question is the life in the dirt is the life in the water the life is in the sea that's right Hallelujah and when he put that seed in you he didn't say well you're going to be a cotton ball Christian you're going to be a kitchen sink faucet Christian he said I put the life in you I'll make sure the life comes forth and produces hallelujah amen I'm getting lost here you see is oh your heart anybody got a heart you've heard the phrase Through The Years you know somebody does something kind of mean have a heart makes you wonder sometimes do people really have a heart but you see our heart is fortified by all that God is that's right it's not fortified by the church we attend not fortified by the pastor that we're so impressed with we're not fortified by this that and the other our list of friends that's right my brother and sister our heart is fortified by Christ himself amen you see his counsel now we already know I already spoke it today that his counsel a Godly Council right a multitude of Godly counsel but my brother and sister his council is not group think that's exactly we think the prophet meant this I tell I don't know what your experiences are in life but I've sat in a chair before set around a table before and had someone make a statement like that well that's what the prophet thought when the prophet said those words he included scripture so you're saying that's what the scripture thought that's it and then it struck me they're right they're right because the word discerned the thought that's right of the heart and their view which the message is correct as long as it matches my thinking well we got a train wreck coming I can see it mhm that's right yep got a train wreck coming now we got to hurry okay what was the Holy Ghost given for let's just go right here and just touch on that now the purpose what was God's purpose in sending the Holy Spirit now I would Mark that down John 14 beginning at the 14th verse reading through the chapter for the basis God's purpose we find here in sending the Holy Spirit was one purpose let's get this right what the holy spirit's for Holy Ghost for one purpose that God himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through amen is it okay okay if I change this quote just for a moment through you that's right amen no not the Holy Roman whatever my brother and sister and not the first church of this and not the first church of there but he's coming to uh continue his plans through you the church amen you are the church amen not a building somewhere that God was in Christ continuing his plans through Christ out of Christ into the church continuing his work through the church now we know what the holy spirit is amen but I've met people in the message who don't know what the holy spirit is because I've been told to my face that the holy spirit is not God you would think every one of us around the message would have enough Revelation but be told right to your face it's not God okay moving on now we know what the holy spirit is we found out last night that it's God Amen I don't know if it gets any pler than that do I need to underline that do I need to shout it a little louder make them rewind the deal and we'll record it again and again and again that the holy spirit is God that's right Hallelujah now you might wonder why I would use that quote well just hang on okay and now we move into the very next one out of that a little farther down may we say it like like this all that God was he poured into Christ because he emptied himself amen amen now we could stop see the word and can denote a pause in there before continuation and so it says that he emptied himself I've changed my mind you can't get it back so even if God wanted to take it back the pause in time of the pouring out I'm going to pour myself into you brother Trevor the Lord I've changed my mind how's he going to get it back he can't he doesn't want to that's why when you were in him before the foundation of the world there's no space of time to come down here and say I guess I've decided you're not the bride of Christ after all it is poured out Can someone say thank you Lord thank you Lord that it's not my weakness not my failure not my insecurity and complex it's not my station in life you poured it out and Lord you poured it into me oh hallelujah thank you Lord amen amen he emptied himself and poured it into Christ and Christ was a fullness of the godhead bodily all that Jehovah was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church not into one individual see that's why we have an issue around the message where people say no no this was just poured into brother brandham the rest of you are just nothings that's not what the prophet said amen he poured it into not one individual but into this body of believers amen that we as body of Believers can look at the word and equally say that word was for me that's your promise father and I've come today for my promise that you gave me Lord hallelujah I love this not into one individual but into the entire body amen hallelujah you know what that means whether we have those men that maybe have a little deeper Revelation on certain things they have the the well I hate to even use the word mind but if you'll bear with me they have the mind to understand certain things a little bit better they can grasp it a little bit better there's things my brother and sister in the word that I just say Amen to CU I just don't know maybe I haven't given it enough time enough study but then I don't want to become an intellect right that's right amen have a chalkboard the length of that wall and start writing out formula to come out with a fact of something I can just say I believe that I don't need to explain it I don't get into heaven because I can explain it I get into heaven because I believe it amen and so it's there you'll have those that have that that understand I'm going use the word intellect if you don't mind they have can grasp that they're smart people hope that doesn't sound like an insult to anyone here today but there's a lot of smart people in this church but some of us still get in Hallelujah without that my brother and sister there's a glitch in the hardware of my IQ but it doesn't matter because I can say Amen to that word and that's actually really the Revelation is in saying Amen to the word amen not to an individual but in entire body now it's right there on the screen there where we come together in unity we have power that's right is Unity that you all agree with the pastor no is Unity that we all agree with committee Unity is that we have an agreeance with the Holy Spirit that's right and that's where he says when we come if you don't mind me inserting this in when we come in harmony with the Holy Ghost that's where we have power I'm sorry to bring these things up but they're just reminds me of a man I interacted with him a fair amount period of time his church was he used to say my church is in harmony with me my church is in agreeance with me and when he quit the message they all quit the message whose Revelation did they have they certainly didn't have the Holy Ghost because today if it's got wings and flies it's good it don't matter now look my brother and sister you say why do you bring that up brother Paul because I'm telling you it ain't you ain't you it ain't you did you guys catch that it's in the dictionary now it ain't you and me agreeing it's us agreeing with him amen right and that's as the prophet of God says where we have power amen so this is where you and I come to the place that his strength becomes our Victory because it's no longer you and I but it's him Christ in you the hope of glory bringing it to pass amen but whether it's planted the seed in soil or cotton ball it must have water the life has to be in the seed amen but it's got to have something external and if you have a church without the Holy Ghost you have a relationship with Jesus Christ without the Holy Ghost it will ultimately die that's right hopefully that wasn't too blunt now now coming along here you know Christ outpouring himself into a body of Believers when we come together in this Unity we have power as a body in other words what that says when I believe that every word the prophet said not every word in the context some people would take it but every word of the word it's not I have power and you don't or you have power and I don't this is a body being Drawn Together by The Very fact that we are the same amen now I don't know if you guys have looked in a mirror lately but I I don't hardly find much similarity between most of us my daughter Jolin when I joke with her that she got switched at the hospital she says that's an impossibility then she points to her nose and says and here's the evidence so you see what God's doing he's drawing every one of us pulling us in in in in in in and you know what that is it's called refining right he's the fire yeah and the pressure believe it or not can be used right out of Leo deia right out of Leo de seea the pressure absolutely but it needs fire and the Holy Ghost fire comes down that's why you're different than the rest of the world Amen I maybe have a button excuse me here now look I I want you to go right here expectations look what brother Brown says here now I I I've just as you know anyway I I shouldn't I don't need to worry about explaining it don't look to symptoms if you look to sisms you're sure to be lost any man anytime who looked to the Natural Things always lost their Victory that's it now I'm going to make a statement you might think it was a little contrary this come from an old guy that I knew years ago Guy full of wisdom failed many things in life and still in the end come out ahead and he used to say this to me it's like Paul did you shop for prices he's a farmer did you shop for prices and I'd say no I do business with him he said well let me just remind you Paul nobody Minds your business better than you pretty good if you don't agree please give me your credit card and checkbook after church and we'll see if I can mind your money as well as you mind your money and some of you I might do better actually yeah my wife doesn't call me cheap for no reason at all amen now look at this let me turn this over here and morph this nobody's going to mind your spiritual position better than you if you're spiritually bankrupt don't blame me me cuz I don't hold the key to your spiritual life you do but we'll find that when we move into the correct position his strength almost immediately becomes our Victory amen have you ever noticed the more you pray the better people look right H that's right anybody brave enough to lift a hand and say I I have been there the more I pray the more everybody in the church looks like a Christian I'm going to get serious for a moment here as we come close I want you to stop and Ponder what is it you need victory over today just stop for a moment cycle that through your own Consciousness what is it I need victory over today are you overcoming it or is Christ in you overcoming it if you're trying to overcome it you're just subduing the temper right the lust of the flesh the pride of life the Love of Money whatever that might be you're trying to subdue it right but his strength that's right are you with me that's right his strength is your Victory amen not your strength that's right amen that's right Hallelujah now you want to know tie some thoughts together here as we close Samson did a lot of things under that Nazarite vow and when Samson backslid everything looked like it was done his eyes are gone but Revelation had already been in him he already knew what Revelation was he didn't have to go find Revelation now I want you can you put your can you put your vision cap on he's out there pushing that grindstone physically I'd say he probably got to be a pretty strong man pushing that thing around in a circle I wonder how many people would go to the fitness club today if they went in there and there was a grindstone and they said oh pay us 50 bucks a month you can push this but brother Brown talks about that one little hair popped out and something see it wasn't that hair no this where the legalism in the message has missed it it wasn't that hair it was The Vow associated with it yes sir that's right amen that's right and when that one little hair popped out we have no recording of Samson's prayer and testimony and confession to God but I tell you that one little sprig of faith that popped up oh when I get more faith I'm going to be an overcomer no you're not no you're not because you're measuring your faith by your intellectual conception when you look at that and say that promise is true in Samson Now understand this is just the way I see it Samson's pushing that thing around and he's like wow my hair's coming back how long could it be now you Brothers can actually grow a beard but no I've seen Brothers I've seen them in the morning morning they shaved and I've seen them in the afternoon and they already had more fuzz on their face I can grow in a week but I can see Samson I remember a promise my daddy made me I remember what he spoke to me and in the end he was greater than in the beginning and I don't care what the devil has done to you spoke to you tripped you up lied about you lied to you about you in the end you're going to be greater than ever in your life because we measure Faith by our carnal thinking God measures faith I can produce a quote if you want it by looking at the heart that's right God said there it is in the heart and my strength this the Lord speaking if you don't mind Paul putting it this way my strength is in their heart amen they believe that's it and we are the Overcomers that's right my brother and sister amen if you musicians would come once again I want to come back I want to ask you what do you need victory over today I don't care what the situation is it be a natural situation that you need help amen but if you just let your heart reach out to the Lord today amen just lift your heart up to the Lord and say Lord you know my need now father whatever faith I need I'm just going to speak in your name because you the one who made the promise I never promised myself healing I've never promised myself overcoming power I've never promised myself Victory but I can look to my father that's right and he has over and over and over made promises and I'm here today by God's grace maybe you would call that Faith to be able to come and stand there not not rude right not the one that barges in jumps in the deal and grabs dad by the face and says Dad you no but the one that would come what is it you need son dad you promised me amen that's right you promised me that's right and I'm just here to stand on the promise nothing else because my strength is not much but his strength in me that's right the word says I can do all things that's right amen who wants to do all things Hallelujah who wants to fulfill every word of God for the day that we live in for this bride that's called in this leoan age my brother and sister we're not called to be partially Victorious we're not called to have partial Revelation we're not called to partially do anything we are here in Jesus Christ to do all things in him hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah one last quote can we meanus man I know amen leave things the way they are let God alone that's the way with his word leave it like it is don't try to add something to it to fit a Creed keep it just the way God said it believe it that will make a husky strong Christian not a baby that has to be denominationally denominational baby petted around a letter from the church one denomination to another when he puts his name in the book of Heaven it's settled forever Hallelujah aren't you glad I can tell you there was a season in my life and I think I could be bold enough to say season in your life you had to be babied a little bit amen but I'm sure glad I'm not a baby any longer I was in the store with Jerry the other day and this is where this thought come to me sorry my thinking so far out there but I saw a grown man with two boxes of diapers under each arm walking through the middle of Costco and I don't know why I thought this and Lord forgive me but I thought are those for him or does he have a baby he looked a little old [Music] sorry about saying [Music] that how much more embarrassing would it be that we had to carry that box into the house of God H you won't forget that thought for a while sorry sometimes there is value in [Music] shock but you see we come into the house of God needing to be pampered that's but we don't have a box we just want the preacher to talk about how God sent a prophet and we're all going in a Rapture and it's all going to be so good won't it be glorious there but the prophet of God said it's going to be the Christian that's going to be the most [Music] disappointed the drunk the dancer womanizer the whatever Heathen Behavior they're not going to be disappointed at all let's not be disappointed Saints his strength he gave us his strength can you say Amen to that he gave us his strength so that we can have Victory let us not give that up because we're afraid to present oursel before for the throne of God boldly Lord I have an issue I have a temper I'm not expecting anybody to raise a hand I have a temper I have lust of the flesh I have pride I have this I have that Envy I have whatever it might be my brother and sister don't be ashamed before God he already knows your heart it's time for us to say Lord here it is the only box I've got to give to you today Lord is the box that has my complex in it the box that has my fear in it the box that has my in it that's right and I just got to get rid of it Lord cuz you see if it's in the closet it'll come out in the most inconvenient time but if it doesn't exist at all because it can't get out from underneath the blood just lift your heart let's Close Our Eyes please just lift your heart today and say Lord I want to empty out a physical closet I want to empty out a emotional closet I want to empty out things out of a spiritual closet father that I could be free from all these little things that have held me back lord it's time for us to find true Liberty because your strength Lord is our Victory and Lord we want Victory like never before just reading where the prophet of God is telling us that because of our lack of sincerity oh God help us he put himself in that example and said because of lack of sincerity some of these things did not take place Lord help me help me Lord Lord those things that hinder my spiritual walk Lord those things that hinder marriages and relationships hinder our children whatever they might be father today Lord we just lay them down before you lord it's well time for us to let your strength rule our life your word to come to the Forefront take away every bitterness every drop of unbelief take away everything that's hindered our spiritual walk for decades Lord we're here today now Lord not our strength Lord not our Revelation but your strength your revelation we just lift our hands up to you and ask you Lord Jesus Lord As We Lay It Down father take it away give us the strength to leave it there Lord not pick it up again Lord to break down family complex Lord to break down things that would hinder us as a church break it all father that your strength would come and Flow into US fill the void of Our Lives Lord fill the hunger the yearning of Our Lives oh Lord that father we could rise up a new creature in Christ Jesus even today we don't have to wait for a Revival somewhere we don't have to wait for another time another preacher we can come it's you lord it's not the man it's you Lord and we come today and say Lord I receive this promise of your strength that you poured into the church that you poured into me as an individual is the bride of Christ I accept it today Lord I'm receiving it and I will act upon it because I desire Liberty in the name of Jesus Christ I desire to be set free from the complex maybe of fear and anxiety whatever it might be Lord I want Liberty it's time for as Saints it's time for us to want Liberty so much so that we will stand there with the father at the father's foot Lord that we would stand there with you Lord Jesus and not walk away Lord until we have received the Liberty in Jesus Christ that you promised us Lord help us I have to admit for myself Lord I'm tired of living just a Halfway Christian Life oh lord it's not sin it's not these things but Lord I realize day by day so many promises that I have not claimed speak to us today Lord Lord for whatever needs there are here we're not going to limit them not going to limited but it reminds me Lord the prophet talking about those men how they wouldn't receive the prophet's words on where the oil was at natural they got greedy they got jealous and because they would not listen to a prophet's words someone else come drilled the hole in the ground got the gusher father help us to listen to The Prophet's words help us when he told us what we needed was more of the Holy Ghost father we don't want more material things Lord we don't want an easier life we want your word Lord let us drill down into your word father and the gusher will be the Holy Ghost pouring out in our lives and our families it's my heart It's My Cry Lord
