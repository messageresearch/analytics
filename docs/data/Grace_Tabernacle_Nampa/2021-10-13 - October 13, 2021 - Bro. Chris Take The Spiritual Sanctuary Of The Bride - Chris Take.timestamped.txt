[26:25] we're so glad that
[26:29] we had a church where you can come to
[26:35] you stand tonight musicians
[26:39] i
[26:40] committed the most unpardonable sin
[26:43] and sent my notes to alex about
[26:48] five minutes ago
[26:50] so if the quotes don't show up or the
[26:53] scriptures don't show up
[26:55] you forgive them and blame me
[26:58] so
[26:59] just had so much
[27:02] coming out here that i had to
[27:05] keep writing it down so um
[27:09] trust that lord will speak tonight
[27:12] and we'll
[27:15] hear from him
[27:17] when we just have a word of prayer
[27:20] heavenly father lord jesus we're looking
[27:22] forward to hearing from you this evening
[27:24] and
[27:26] lord we we don't ever
[27:28] want to come to make ourselves something
[27:33] for the only thing we want to make of
[27:34] ourselves is
[27:36] a better version of you lord and that is
[27:39] done by your grace and your word lord
[27:41] and our faith that you can do it
[27:44] we're desiring lord jesus to draw near
[27:46] to you to push aside everything that
[27:48] would hinder your ability to move in our
[27:51] lives through jesus
[27:53] father we pray that you just take
[27:54] control of the service now every spirit
[27:56] or thought that's contrary to your word
[27:58] you pray you'd find it now
[28:01] lord that we would just be
[28:02] prisoners of christ
[28:04] father that your love would
[28:07] grow within us father that love that
[28:09] the world tries to get at but just crazy
[28:12] perversion of but father we have a true
[28:14] revelation
[28:15] father that that is
[28:17] you lord jesus father working in us lord
[28:20] compassion as the prophet said was you
[28:24] braiding the whip and beating the money
[28:26] changers from the temple father
[28:28] sometimes your word will chase in us
[28:30] lord but that's your love father
[28:32] lord not knowing how you're going to do
[28:34] this tonight father but we are willing
[28:37] and open to your moving in our hearts
[28:40] lord jesus we love you now we commit
[28:42] these words into your hands in jesus
[28:44] christ's name we pray
[28:46] amen
[28:48] if you have your bibles tonight would
[28:49] like to turn with me to exodus 25.
[28:58] if you guys can't do it just do the
[29:00] quotes
[29:02] alex sector at least the quotes if you
[29:04] can
[29:10] by the way it's easier than the
[29:11] scriptures
[29:13] okay well
[29:16] if you want the quotes text me and i
[29:18] will send them to you
[29:20] how about that
[29:22] exodus chapter 25 verse one
[29:36] and the lord spake unto moses saying
[29:38] speak unto the children of israel
[29:41] that they bring me an offering of every
[29:43] man that giveth it willingly with his
[29:45] heart
[29:48] he shall take my offering
[29:50] and this is the offering which ye shall
[29:53] make take of them gold and silver and
[29:56] brass
[29:57] and blue and purple and scarlet and fine
[30:00] linen and goat's hair
[30:02] and ram's
[30:06] skin dyed red
[30:09] and badger skin instead of wood
[30:12] oil for the light spices for anointing
[30:15] oil and for sweet incense onyx stones
[30:18] and stones to be set in the ephod
[30:21] and in the breast breastplate and let
[30:23] them make me a sanctuary that i may
[30:27] dwell
[30:28] among them
[30:30] lord add this blessing to the reading of
[30:32] the world you can be seated tonight
[30:34] so
[30:36] just wanted to focus on that scripture
[30:38] there verse 8 and let them make me a
[30:41] sanctuary
[30:42] that i may dwell among them my title
[30:45] tonight is the spiritual sanctuary of
[30:48] the bride
[30:49] and so
[30:50] um
[30:52] who knows i i have just um
[30:55] these notes that i put down and
[30:58] stuff i was sitting in the office today
[31:00] i came over here a little bit early and
[31:01] i was like i didn't what do you want me
[31:03] to speak lord and
[31:05] i just scrolled back and i have i have
[31:07] some notes where i'll put a title and
[31:10] put a couple of words
[31:11] um
[31:13] or i'll just put a title down because if
[31:15] you don't write it down you're not going
[31:16] to remember it and so i'm scrolling
[31:18] through and i and i and i saw this title
[31:20] there the spiritual sanctuary of the
[31:23] bride
[31:24] and
[31:25] the lord began to deal with my heart and
[31:27] so
[31:28] i feel and maybe it's just me as a man i
[31:31] feel like there's so much more that
[31:32] could be put into this
[31:34] but for lack of time so maybe uh if we
[31:37] have the opportunity we'll do another
[31:39] part on this
[31:40] who knows i've said that before and
[31:41] there's never been part two so
[31:44] but
[31:44] anyways
[31:46] so this verse here but and let them make
[31:48] me a sanctuary that i may dwell among
[31:51] them
[31:52] and um you know it's been said before by
[31:55] some um people and i say that because
[31:58] i've heard it said and taken into the
[32:01] context of well uh if the lord wants if
[32:05] it's the lord's will he'll do it and
[32:07] that is true and that is is truth but
[32:10] what happens is
[32:12] us as human in our flesh we can take
[32:15] that as an excuse to do nothing
[32:18] and so this scripture here he says let
[32:20] them make
[32:21] let them make me a sanctuary so the
[32:25] children of israel all of them had to
[32:26] gather their resources their stones
[32:29] their gold their their jewelry their
[32:32] their uh
[32:34] ram skins and badger skins and the wood
[32:36] they had to get this all together and
[32:38] bring it an offering to build the
[32:41] sanctuary
[32:42] so it is the offering that you give that
[32:45] builds a sanctuary for god to dwell in
[32:48] and we know that that's the one thing
[32:49] brother vernon says we have to do is lay
[32:51] down our self-will so that god can come
[32:54] and move in our lives when we get
[32:57] ourselves out of the way then god can
[32:59] dwell within us we're all
[33:02] predestinated and for ordained to
[33:05] to make that choice but you still have
[33:08] to do it i was i think it was a youth
[33:10] meeting on friday 900 sure but i was
[33:13] talking you know um judas still had a
[33:16] choice
[33:18] that's right
[33:20] pontius pilate still had a choice
[33:25] and because they made the choices they
[33:27] did they suffered for those choices
[33:29] you still have a choice to accept christ
[33:33] and many of us have
[33:35] and you're we reaping this the growth
[33:38] from that choice so it's still up to you
[33:41] we all still have a choice because if we
[33:42] didn't what would be the purpose of
[33:44] redemption
[33:46] so hebrews chapter eight verse
[33:48] verse one if you would like to turn
[33:50] there with me we'll go there
[33:56] so we're all given a choice and we they
[33:58] had to bring the offerings to build
[34:01] the sanctuary the tabernacle for god to
[34:03] dwell in and in hebrews chapter 8
[34:06] hebrews we know it's a the book that
[34:08] paul wrote kind of breaking down the the
[34:11] um
[34:12] the the religion that the jews had
[34:15] followed this was to the jews
[34:17] for them to understand the transition
[34:19] that has been the change of dispensation
[34:21] that happened when christ died on the
[34:23] cross you imagine growing up in the
[34:26] religion of in in the in the um the acts
[34:29] of being a jew and then suddenly none of
[34:31] that matters anymore you don't have to
[34:33] go to the temple you don't have to it
[34:35] would be very hard to come to that place
[34:37] and and not have any kind of instruction
[34:40] to go forward so god laid it on paul's
[34:42] heart he wrote the book of hebrews and
[34:44] so if you ever have a desire
[34:46] in your heart and at whatever season
[34:48] you're in to understand the types of the
[34:50] the physical tabernacle and the
[34:52] spiritual tabernacle it's very well laid
[34:54] out here in the book of hebrews and
[34:56] brother brown did a whole series on the
[34:57] book of hebrews so anyways hebrews
[34:59] chapter eight here verse one now all the
[35:02] things which we have spoken this is the
[35:03] sum we have such a high priest who is
[35:06] set on the right hand of the throne of
[35:08] the majesty in the heavens
[35:11] so in other words we are no longer have
[35:12] an earthly high priest christ is our
[35:14] high priest in the heaven a minister of
[35:18] the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle
[35:20] which the lord pitched and not man
[35:23] it was not man made it was made of the
[35:25] lord
[35:27] remember our title tonight the spiritual
[35:29] sanctuary of the bride
[35:31] for every high priest is ordained to
[35:33] offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it
[35:36] is of necessity that that this man have
[35:39] somewhat also to offer for if he were on
[35:43] earth he should not be a priest seen
[35:45] that there are priests that offer gifts
[35:47] according to the law who serve unto the
[35:49] example
[35:51] and shadow of heavenly things as moses
[35:53] was admonished of god when he was about
[35:55] to make the tabernacle
[35:57] force foresee saith he that thou make
[36:00] all things according to the pattern
[36:02] showed thee in the mount
[36:05] so moses the building of the sanctuary
[36:08] came for the revelation that god had
[36:09] given him
[36:11] but now hath he obtained a more
[36:12] excellent ministry
[36:14] by how much also he is the mediator of a
[36:18] better covenant
[36:20] which was established upon better
[36:22] promises so it's better now this new
[36:26] covenant have i given you this new
[36:28] covenant the writing of the words upon
[36:30] our heart is a better covenant because
[36:32] that was just a shadow of what god
[36:35] really wanted to do
[36:37] but because of the season and the times
[36:39] and the age god had to get set forth
[36:42] this pattern in this covenant of of of
[36:44] acts and of blood of bulls and goats he
[36:46] had to set that pattern because of the
[36:48] season well not yet time for the for
[36:52] the the development of the negative to
[36:54] the positive
[36:56] meaning you know like film
[36:58] so that this is now a better covenant
[37:01] and and um
[37:03] established upon better promises
[37:07] which is what we have access to christ
[37:10] that is a promise you have if you have a
[37:13] need there's a promise you can step into
[37:15] or only the high priest used to be able
[37:17] to go and you can receive straight from
[37:20] god that's a better promise
[37:23] amen praise the lord and then in verse
[37:25] 13 in that he saith a new covenant if he
[37:29] have
[37:30] a new covenant he hath made the first
[37:33] old
[37:34] now that which decayeth and waxeth old
[37:36] is ready to vanish away
[37:41] yes okay and he and that he saith a new
[37:43] covenant he hath made the first old so
[37:46] the first covenant is now the old
[37:48] covenant now that which decayeth and
[37:50] waxes old is ready to vanish away so
[37:53] that's ready to be put away that's ready
[37:54] to be vanit to vanish away because
[37:56] there's a better covenant if you
[37:58] continue to the next chapter he says
[38:00] then verily the first covenant had also
[38:02] ordinances of divine service and a
[38:06] worldly or earthly
[38:08] sanctuary so the first covenant
[38:11] the tabernacle in the world there's the
[38:13] first covenant and that's the old man so
[38:16] god put you forth on earth in flesh that
[38:20] you could manifest his word that you
[38:22] would be born today
[38:24] but god had a better covenant a better
[38:27] promise that he wanted to deal in your
[38:29] life and deal with you so he brought
[38:32] forth redemption in your life now you
[38:34] put away the old man and you become a
[38:37] new creation in christ jesus you step
[38:41] from the old
[38:43] sanctuary you step from the old man into
[38:46] the spiritual sanctuary with christ
[38:49] amen the first covenant is passed away
[38:52] amen that second covenant is a new man
[38:54] in christ jesus now um
[38:58] the lord will help us here the if you
[39:00] look at the sanctuary and and if we
[39:03] continue in chapter nine here for there
[39:05] was a tabernacle made the first wherein
[39:08] was the candlestick and the table and
[39:10] the show bread which is called the
[39:12] sanctuary now we know the tabernacle the
[39:15] whole thing that's that's where we dwell
[39:17] with christ the tent and that all that
[39:19] stuff
[39:20] but we're where we're going to come kind
[39:22] of com take liberties to combine this
[39:24] together now we know there's there's
[39:26] christ is in the midst so in the
[39:28] sanctuary you have the candlestick
[39:31] the candlestick must be burning what was
[39:34] one of the great sins that eli committed
[39:36] he let the candlestick go out
[39:39] he let the candle stick out he let his
[39:41] sons there they're there at the they're
[39:43] they're being uh ministering before the
[39:45] the children of israel
[39:47] taking the meat from the offering the
[39:49] wrong way
[39:50] taking the women in the there and in
[39:53] prostitution and and just in in total um
[39:57] decay and and he let the the candle go
[40:01] out and that was one thing that candle
[40:04] had to keep going that oil because that
[40:05] candle was a type
[40:07] is a type of of the holy spirit of
[40:09] christ okay so so so what what happened
[40:12] was even though that cancel went out and
[40:15] then and but god in in the midst of this
[40:18] of this turmoil of god's plan of
[40:21] redemption being displayed in in in the
[40:24] physical with the temple
[40:26] while that wallah display of christ was
[40:29] being
[40:30] misrepresented to the children of israel
[40:32] through the sons of eli and even eli
[40:34] himself god in that moment in that midst
[40:38] was raising up a true prophet was
[40:41] raising up a true representation of
[40:44] christ
[40:45] and it was that true representation that
[40:47] anointed david and then who was typed to
[40:51] the son of david
[40:53] and so so god was raising up a ministry
[40:56] so you see and we'll get to a quote here
[40:58] later on but but you can't be looking at
[41:01] the outside you can't be looking at the
[41:04] physical the uh the outward
[41:06] representation
[41:07] and say oh oh you know this this is this
[41:10] you call and i i've heard this straight
[41:12] from the horse's mouth oh the message is
[41:14] bad because of this person and this
[41:16] church and this happened so the whole
[41:18] thing is bad but that's
[41:21] that's looking at the outside picture if
[41:24] we use that my what would we even do
[41:26] all cars are bad because that one caught
[41:29] on fire for no reason
[41:31] so that's just not a common uh uh thing
[41:34] to live life by comment that's not
[41:35] that's not common sense everyone
[41:37] understands that that's maybe not the
[41:40] whole so we we as as as as as
[41:43] humans as sometimes i get grieved but i
[41:46] know that you know it doesn't matter
[41:48] god's still working when i see a
[41:50] misrepresentation of christ amen but
[41:53] even in that moment even in the moment
[41:55] when you see a misrepresentation of
[41:57] christ to somebody else look i was given
[42:00] a misrepresentation of christ but i'm
[42:02] here today by god's grace serving him
[42:04] with all my heart so god in the midst of
[42:07] that misrepresentation
[42:09] was raising up something that was
[42:11] following according to the word of god
[42:15] amen so
[42:16] all of that came from just this
[42:18] candlestick here but it must be burning
[42:21] that's the that was the law and then we
[42:23] know the oil of that lamp types the holy
[42:26] spirit and it's the holy spirit that
[42:28] keeps the lamp burning that keeps the
[42:30] fire of god but the battle says here in
[42:32] the seven church ages
[42:34] the the sermon the seven church ages
[42:36] 1954. now notice these golden
[42:38] candlesticks this oil poured into these
[42:40] candlesticks now the oil was
[42:43] was what was put in the lamp to burn
[42:46] now aaron it was his duty to light these
[42:48] lamps and these lamps had to be lit hold
[42:51] it hold it on now look keep reference
[42:53] listen these lamps had to be lit by the
[42:55] fire that god had lived amen
[42:58] aaron's sons went in with some strange
[43:00] fire and god slew them in the door
[43:03] that's right strange fire it hap so he
[43:06] says the fire that god started in other
[43:08] words a candle stick had to be burning
[43:11] but it had to be burning from the fire
[43:14] that god started
[43:16] what was i just saying a second ago
[43:18] about a representation of christ someone
[43:20] could come along with their own fire and
[43:21] they can light it right
[43:23] and it can look good but god will not be
[43:26] in that fire
[43:27] because it's not the fire that god lit
[43:30] that's why saints of god you have to
[43:32] have the holy ghost because guess what
[43:34] that candle will reject that fire amen
[43:37] there will be no burning in the
[43:39] sanctuary of christ with that strange
[43:41] fire because that candle will reject
[43:43] that fire just like christ did here he
[43:45] god he slew them at the door before they
[43:47] could come into his sanctuary so they
[43:50] had the fire on the outside you know
[43:52] maybe the children of israel saw them oh
[43:54] look at look at those are the sons of of
[43:56] aaron now we could go to a whole lot
[43:58] right there
[44:00] but i'll just let you fill in the blanks
[44:03] look at them with that fire
[44:05] wow that fire
[44:07] going to the tabernacle
[44:09] but see if they turned away
[44:12] and just ran with that but didn't watch
[44:15] what god did with that fire they would
[44:17] have missed that god rejected that
[44:20] strange fire it was not the fire of the
[44:22] holy spirit see what it comes down to
[44:24] say to god in the age that we are living
[44:26] in today you have to have the holy
[44:29] spirit to discern because there are so
[44:32] many things moving in our midst moving
[44:35] amongst our family and our friends and
[44:38] this church and that church good
[44:40] churches and there are things that are
[44:41] moving in the midst
[44:43] that are not
[44:44] a proper representation of christ
[44:48] but
[44:49] just as you will find you will find that
[44:52] represent that right representation that
[44:54] safety in the saints the spiritual
[44:57] sanctuary of the bride
[44:59] not the spiritual sanctuary of this man
[45:01] or that man or of your own making but
[45:04] the one that god set in place
[45:06] and then that's where you'll find you
[45:07] know today they have a saying and i was
[45:09] telling the youth you know every time
[45:11] you see a thing in the natural it's a
[45:12] perversion of what god's doing in the
[45:14] spiritual
[45:15] or excuse me
[45:17] the secular world
[45:19] they are perverting what god is doing in
[45:21] the spiritual and and so um
[45:24] they have this thing where you know it's
[45:26] a safe place
[45:28] you know you can just be whatever you
[45:29] want
[45:30] you're safe you're safe here you know
[45:32] there's a sign this is a safe zone so
[45:35] you can go there and you can just be
[45:36] nutso and no one will will bother you
[45:39] you know there's no hate speech here
[45:41] well god has a safe place
[45:44] a safe place that protects you
[45:48] that protects you and that's
[45:50] the sanctuary for the bride
[45:52] revelations two verse five
[45:55] remember therefore from whence thou art
[45:56] fallen and repent and do the first works
[46:00] or else i will come unto thee quickly
[46:02] and will remove thy candlestick out of
[46:04] his place
[46:06] except thou repent
[46:09] revelations two verse one i'm going
[46:11] backwards
[46:12] under the angel of the church of ephesus
[46:14] right these things sayeth he that hold
[46:15] up the seven stars in his right hand who
[46:18] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[46:20] candlesticks
[46:22] two couple things here
[46:28] go repent of your work look if those
[46:31] sons of heroin would have repented
[46:34] of what of those works of trying to
[46:35] bring that trained fire before they ever
[46:37] got there
[46:38] it would have been fine
[46:41] a candlestick and everything
[46:44] but now what what what is being said to
[46:46] the ephesian church age is
[46:49] repent
[46:50] and go back
[46:52] to your first works go back to your
[46:54] first love repent and go back or i'm
[46:58] going to remove the candlestick the type
[47:01] of the whole the of christ i'm gonna i'm
[47:03] just gonna step away you're not gonna
[47:05] find me
[47:06] if you go forward with that unrepentant
[47:08] heart um
[47:11] you're going to be walking in darkness
[47:13] is what it will happen because that
[47:14] candlestick will be removed and you
[47:16] won't be able to see
[47:17] um
[47:18] but now he's but now this other the
[47:21] first verse
[47:22] excuse me
[47:25] let me back up just a second so you want
[47:27] to keep that candle lit get something in
[47:29] your life you need to repent if you want
[47:30] to kill make that right and keep that
[47:32] candle lit in your life you want to
[47:34] strengthen that flame
[47:36] and the philip uh the philadelphian
[47:38] church i think it is that the scripture
[47:40] says and strengthen that which you have
[47:42] that little light and then says that
[47:44] little light that they had he's telling
[47:45] them strengthen that light
[47:48] um so but it says that um he walketh in
[47:51] the midst of the seven golden
[47:53] candlesticks so the christ in the midst
[47:56] of these seven golden cattle sticks so
[47:58] it's christ keeping the flame burning
[48:02] thank goodness it's not left up to me
[48:05] thank goodness that i have something i
[48:07] can lean on i can't go i was listening
[48:10] to to a sermon today and um
[48:13] it was brother brother donny reagan um
[48:16] and he was saying
[48:17] you know you don't challenge the devil
[48:20] the devil the devil puts a challenge
[48:22] forth you go to your to your father and
[48:24] you say hey this has happened
[48:26] you did can you deal with this right and
[48:29] he will you rely on christ for
[48:32] everything don't go off and try to to
[48:34] handle this on your own you need christ
[48:36] look you can't even have the fire to see
[48:39] without the holy ghost the oil
[48:42] and you need christ in the midst
[48:44] protecting that
[48:46] holding that true making sure you have
[48:49] your candle is lit when you find
[48:51] sanctuary with christ
[48:54] that is how you separate and have your
[48:56] lamp lit trimmed full of oil and burning
[48:59] brightly for christ it's christ in the
[49:02] midst keeping that flame burning amen
[49:04] that's inside the sanctuary for the
[49:07] bribe
[49:09] now a couple more quotes here um the
[49:11] ephesian church age 1960 now and we're
[49:14] beginning with the first chapter of of
[49:16] ephesus
[49:17] of ephesians we're talking about the
[49:19] church age
[49:24] i threw a bunch of quotes in here i'm
[49:26] just making sure that this is
[49:28] one i do want to read
[49:34] right here john is the messenger of that
[49:36] at that time walking in the midst of
[49:38] these seven golden candlesticks was
[49:39] jesus christ the almighty god what is he
[49:41] doing he didn't say he was walking in
[49:44] one candlestick he was walking in the
[49:46] midst of all of them what does that
[49:48] denote that he is the same god yesterday
[49:50] today and forever
[49:52] and in every church age to every
[49:54] believer
[49:56] he comes to with the holy ghost to every
[49:58] eighth to every person the same
[50:01] yesterday today and forever
[50:04] holding in his right hand right hand
[50:05] means his authority and power holding in
[50:08] his right hand under control
[50:12] the seven messengers to the seven church
[50:14] ages oh i like that see him walking
[50:16] around these church ages the christ
[50:18] making himself known to his people down
[50:21] through these dark ages down through
[50:23] every age while the church got formal
[50:25] and pulled out some went one way and
[50:26] some another but that little minority of
[50:28] the church still held on and christ
[50:31] worked with them confirming his word
[50:34] winds it right through
[50:36] so christ not only is he in the midst of
[50:38] the candlestick which is jesus christ
[50:41] the same yesterday today and forever all
[50:42] the kind of sticks to every believer
[50:44] every person
[50:46] but he is holding the word
[50:48] in his hand so you have nothing to
[50:53] you just fear to get in that sanctuary
[50:55] so that god he will give you the word he
[50:58] already has under his control and that
[51:01] word doesn't come from strange fire
[51:04] because strange fire can't get inside
[51:06] the sanctuary of god amen so if you want
[51:08] to know if you want to say you know this
[51:10] word that's coming this strange fire
[51:13] that i'm seeing this fire that i'm
[51:14] seeing is it strange or is it truth what
[51:17] does the scripture say um i tried to
[51:19] quote this last time and i didn't
[51:21] remember right but basically you have
[51:23] the ability amen to judge between the
[51:26] two things judge between the scripture
[51:28] and it might even be in hebrews but able
[51:30] to to to rightly divide the word of god
[51:33] you're given that ability what is the
[51:36] spirit of the age that we are living in
[51:38] it's the eagle you can see you can see
[51:41] whether or not this is true or this is
[51:43] or this is false or this is strange fire
[51:46] and how are we going to see it's not
[51:48] your eyes it's christ's eyes you have to
[51:51] be looking through the eyes of christ
[51:53] through the eyes of faith which is his
[51:55] word to say is this strange fire or is
[51:58] this the truth
[52:00] whenever you see something you're
[52:02] concerned or you have a question about
[52:04] something and when you begin to ask god
[52:06] lord is this strange fire or is this
[52:09] your truth don't just run after it
[52:11] because it's fire
[52:16] don't just run after because it's fire
[52:18] so you want to find out you go into the
[52:19] sanctuary
[52:21] see does that fire make it inside there
[52:23] that's how you can tell amen so inside
[52:26] the sanctuary we have the candlestick
[52:28] and then we also have the showbread
[52:32] now the showbread types christ hebrews
[52:34] chapter 7 1957
[52:38] but the perfection has come to the place
[52:40] that the middle person now if there
[52:42] happens to be a jew here or somebody
[52:44] that understands the old testament
[52:46] testament prove it let me show you i
[52:48] haven't got the old testament with me
[52:50] right now
[52:52] excuse me
[52:55] i'm going to spit that thing out
[52:57] accidentally but in the offering of the
[52:59] showbread
[53:00] that was laying on the kosher plate in
[53:02] the jewish jewish sacrifice at the
[53:05] cleansing of the tabernacles ask any jew
[53:08] on those three pieces of bread the
[53:10] middle piece was broken that was christ
[53:12] the middle piece was broken christ the
[53:14] in between showed that there had to be a
[53:17] breaking somewhere for redemption and
[53:19] that peace was considered redemption on
[53:21] the kosher bread aren't you so glad that
[53:24] you got an in between
[53:27] you got something you got the world on
[53:28] this side and well okay you got it all
[53:31] on both sides
[53:33] but you got that in between you got you
[53:35] got yourself on this side and the world
[53:37] on this side we'll go with that and you
[53:39] got that in between then you got a
[53:41] consituation you got to consider you got
[53:43] an in between you don't have to face the
[53:46] world
[53:47] and then you just gotta face christ and
[53:49] he'll face the world for you guess what
[53:51] he's already come with the recipe to
[53:53] success
[53:56] he's already come with the recipe to
[53:57] success you just have to follow it
[54:00] you just have to follow it you say you
[54:02] know someone bakes a cake someone who
[54:04] probably doesn't know
[54:06] we're going to go with someone who
[54:07] doesn't have the experience
[54:08] and they decide they're going to put
[54:11] a cup of salt
[54:13] and
[54:14] a teaspoon of sugar
[54:18] guess what
[54:19] it's not going to be edible
[54:22] but if they would have stuck with the
[54:24] recipe
[54:25] they would have been a cup of sugar and
[54:26] a pinch of salt yeah
[54:29] you see but they went out on their own
[54:31] and they said oh we're gonna go make
[54:32] this up and it guess what you can't you
[54:35] can't look at it a cake do cake you have
[54:37] two cakes
[54:38] one with a cup of sugar one with a cup
[54:40] of salt there is no difference on the
[54:42] outside
[54:45] a taste of the goodness of god and come
[54:48] and see
[54:50] you gotta taste it
[54:53] don't go out tasting the world that's
[54:54] not what i'm saying
[54:56] you got to take that and you're going to
[54:59] say does it line up with the word of god
[55:02] does it line up amen praise the lord i'm
[55:04] going to leave that there i don't know
[55:05] where that one was going but anyways you
[55:07] can't tell the difference between the
[55:08] two cakes one with a cup of sugar and
[55:10] one with a cup of salt but christ
[55:13] have him taste it first
[55:16] have him be the taste tester right even
[55:18] it's a god taking and dividing because
[55:21] they look the same oh my goodness saints
[55:23] of god
[55:24] it looks the same
[55:26] it looks the same right now
[55:30] and there's more than one thing that's
[55:31] the same right now there's there's
[55:34] there's there's there's well there's
[55:36] camps
[55:38] there's good preachers preaching an idea
[55:41] over here and there's good preachers
[55:42] preaching an idea over here and they
[55:44] contradict
[55:45] you can almost tell them preaching at
[55:47] each other
[55:49] where is it at where's the fire of god
[55:52] what's right there's truth in both
[55:54] but what is god bringing forth what is
[55:57] god because this is what you've got to
[55:59] we're back to the candlesticks but you
[56:01] gotta you got to have that light burning
[56:04] inside
[56:06] guess what
[56:07] you try to go into the sanctuary without
[56:09] that lamplight you're not gonna find the
[56:10] showbread in the dark
[56:13] but you get christ in the midst
[56:17] you get christ in the midst there's
[56:18] going to be fire to find the truth
[56:22] christ will lead us into all truth and
[56:26] when he came in the first age in the
[56:28] ephesian church age and he put up the
[56:31] sanctuary where was the sanctuary
[56:34] in god's truth for that age then the
[56:36] second age came and it the third edge
[56:39] and it got darker and it got darker but
[56:41] god still had a fire burning in his
[56:44] sanctuary the spiritual sanctuary he had
[56:48] set up for the bride the bride in each
[56:50] of those age so that they could find
[56:53] truth
[56:54] it was darkness outside guess what
[56:57] you'll be inside the tent it's dark
[56:58] outside but you have the light burning
[57:00] to show you the way
[57:02] you have the light burning to show you
[57:04] the table that is set with the show
[57:06] bread so that you can partake of christ
[57:09] what did john a type of the blood have
[57:11] to do eat the book
[57:12] you have to eat you have to eat that
[57:15] book you have to eat the show bread what
[57:17] is the book it's christ you have to take
[57:20] christ oh it's so sweet in your mouth
[57:22] what is bitter in your belly why because
[57:24] then you have to take that and you have
[57:26] to live that out amen if you are
[57:29] standing in the midst of the sanctuary
[57:31] for christ amen
[57:34] underneath the pressure
[57:36] underneath the pressure you will still
[57:38] shine forth the life of christ because
[57:40] you have something that will stand amen
[57:44] and that's something that will stand is
[57:46] jesus christ the holy ghost inside of
[57:48] you that oil and though the winds will
[57:51] blow against the tent that fire will
[57:53] never go out as long as the holy spirit
[57:56] is the source of that flame
[57:59] amen
[58:01] 1960 the thyroid iron churches now we
[58:03] find out that he also got hidden manna
[58:05] now hidden manna is typed to the
[58:07] showbread the showbread was for priests
[58:10] alone that is right showbread was just
[58:12] for the priest it was a special thing
[58:14] made for the priest that is the leaders
[58:16] and this man overcome the whole
[58:18] congregation god manna but he got a
[58:21] hidden special man like about the priest
[58:24] or a special revelation
[58:30] some people get upset
[58:32] talking about special revelation
[58:36] message i just read it to you
[58:38] of who jesus was and what about about
[58:41] him all about him see he got the
[58:43] revelation of
[58:44] he got that revelation if he had
[58:46] overcome
[58:48] to the angel so in other words
[58:50] outside of the sanctuary manna was
[58:53] fallen
[58:55] listen we're talking about the camp of
[58:56] israel
[58:58] we're talking about we're not talking
[58:59] about canaan
[59:01] and the moabites and the ammonites we're
[59:05] not talking about the denominations
[59:08] we're talking about the camp of israel
[59:11] inside the camp of israel is the truth
[59:14] inside the church
[59:17] notice i the church not the lodges
[59:20] inside the church
[59:22] is the truth
[59:24] and the man is falling
[59:26] but the manna falling outside of the
[59:28] sanctuary that god has put in place for
[59:32] the bride
[59:33] spoils overnight yeah

[59:41] and there was revival and there was man
[59:44] of fallen tell your bucket was
[59:46] overflowing

[59:56] guess what i gotta eat every day
[59:59] i don't eat every day i'm gonna die
[1:00:02] but i take that man from that that that
[1:00:04] manna that fell from heaven that that
[1:00:06] that great anointing of the flesh and of
[1:00:08] the spirit
[1:00:10] i take try to take that home
[1:00:12] it's not gonna last the night
[1:00:15] but in that if i'm accepting the man of
[1:00:17] falling from heaven but i also step
[1:00:20] inside to the sanctuary
[1:00:22] i'm double dipping
[1:00:24] you get it on your on the spirit and
[1:00:26] you're in joy and rejoicing by the way
[1:00:29] it's joy
[1:00:30] it's rejoicing in god in christ you get
[1:00:33] that on the outside and it it's
[1:00:35] refreshing
[1:00:36] fresh manna from heaven refreshing but
[1:00:38] you step inside the sanctuary
[1:00:41] now you've got something that'll last
[1:00:42] the night
[1:00:44] when darkness comes yea though i walk to
[1:00:46] the valley of the shadow of death i will
[1:00:48] fear no evil for thou art with me amen
[1:00:53] what what's going to take you through
[1:00:55] the darkness
[1:00:57] that hidden manna the showbread which is
[1:01:00] christ so on the outside they had they
[1:01:03] had an example they had a shadow
[1:01:07] the moving of the flesh and the spirit
[1:01:10] is a shadow
[1:01:12] of the man that's fallen and they'll
[1:01:14] take that and they'll say we've got the
[1:01:16] manna look at this i've got six i got
[1:01:18] four buckets one on each hand and two in
[1:01:20] between
[1:01:23] i got all this manna
[1:01:25] and there you're you're energized and
[1:01:27] you're rejuvenated but as soon as
[1:01:29] darkness comes
[1:01:31] let me tell you a sense of god we're
[1:01:32] walking in darkness
[1:01:34] but we have the light
[1:01:38] we will not over be overcome by the
[1:01:40] darkness but the light shall overcome
[1:01:43] the darkness
[1:01:45] what's going to show you the way through
[1:01:48] the night
[1:01:49] the hidden manna which is christ which
[1:01:51] is the showbread inside and where do you
[1:01:54] find that in the sanctuary the spiritual
[1:01:58] sanctuary for the bride
[1:02:01] you have to step into that place
[1:02:04] guess what you can't go in there without
[1:02:06] relationship intimate relationship with
[1:02:08] christ that's the 10th vision
[1:02:10] i'll meet you in there that's it
[1:02:14] the unveiling of god 1964 and it ripens
[1:02:16] the showbird that we feast on and drive
[1:02:18] across the country for hundreds of miles
[1:02:20] see it's the believer's food
[1:02:23] it's only for a believer remember the
[1:02:26] show bread was only for the believer
[1:02:28] only see show bread seed notice what
[1:02:30] does it do the shekinah glory over the
[1:02:32] show bed shewbread kept it from spoiling
[1:02:37] so you say oh i don't understand
[1:02:39] why did they leave the message
[1:02:41] i don't understand why were they were
[1:02:43] they on fire for god and now they're not
[1:02:46] darkness came
[1:02:48] and they didn't have the light to find
[1:02:49] their way through
[1:02:51] but guess what
[1:02:53] god in his grace
[1:02:55] god in his grace
[1:02:59] can bring the light for them to find
[1:03:01] their way back
[1:03:02] to the spiritual sanctuary for the bride
[1:03:04] of christ
[1:03:05] we are not allowed to say who is
[1:03:09] accepted into the sanctuary as soon as
[1:03:12] you do
[1:03:13] you bring strange fire
[1:03:16] outside of this sanctuary okay see i got
[1:03:19] ahead of my notes so i'm trying to
[1:03:20] repeat myself
[1:03:24] see the word of god the word of god is
[1:03:26] eternal
[1:03:27] and ever growing ever expanding
[1:03:30] the showbread
[1:03:32] guess what it just keeps on giving
[1:03:34] just keeps on it doesn't ever go out
[1:03:36] there's always more there's always more
[1:03:38] there
[1:03:40] there's always more of that that that
[1:03:41] food that you need it won't it will
[1:03:43] never spoil just gets better and better
[1:03:46] and better
[1:03:47] my wife has a some of you too some of
[1:03:49] you other sisters do my has a
[1:03:51] jar of sourdough starter on her on our
[1:03:53] counter
[1:03:54] when she feeds it
[1:03:56] it just bubbles over
[1:03:58] she makes another loaf of bread she
[1:04:00] feeds it it bubbles over she makes
[1:04:01] another loaf of bread she feeds it it
[1:04:03] bubbles over why because there's a life
[1:04:05] inside of it
[1:04:07] when fed the truth
[1:04:10] you can't just feed it whatever you want
[1:04:12] you can't put a celery stick in there
[1:04:13] nothing's gonna happen you say oh but
[1:04:15] celery is healthy not for the sourdough
[1:04:17] starter
[1:04:21] listening to the tapes is healthy
[1:04:24] but you gotta pull the food you've got
[1:04:27] to be the food in the due season which
[1:04:29] christ has pre-ordained
[1:04:32] amen it's i don't know that just that
[1:04:34] was free
[1:04:36] praise the lord anyway
[1:04:38] but you got to feed the sourdough
[1:04:39] starter the right thing
[1:04:41] for it to bring forth more abundance of
[1:04:44] life
[1:04:46] and then you bake more bread guess what
[1:04:48] by your fruits you shall know them
[1:04:49] you're going to be just the fruits just
[1:04:52] going to be coming off and coming off
[1:04:54] and coming off because you're feeding it
[1:04:57] what it needs to be fed which is the
[1:04:58] word of god praise the lord
[1:05:12] so no matter what comes around
[1:05:14] amen
[1:05:16] that manna a hidden man that will never
[1:05:19] spoil
[1:05:20] psalms 63 verse one you can turn if you
[1:05:23] like just gonna pull it too fold it up
[1:05:25] real quick here
[1:05:37] oh god thou art my god
[1:05:39] early will i seek thee
[1:05:41] isn't that just
[1:05:43] that's
[1:05:44] so good right there early
[1:05:46] well i seek thee
[1:05:49] not after
[1:05:50] your house is on fire
[1:05:55] not after
[1:05:57] you know
[1:05:58] if if i get termites in my house
[1:06:03] if i don't seek help early
[1:06:05] i'm going to be calling a builder
[1:06:08] he's going to have to come it's going to
[1:06:09] cost me
[1:06:10] three times as much 10 times as much
[1:06:12] money nowadays
[1:06:14] to rebuild this section of my house that
[1:06:16] fell down for the
[1:06:17] but as if i'm watching my house
[1:06:21] and watching it i'm inspecting it
[1:06:23] constantly
[1:06:24] i'll see the termites when they first
[1:06:26] come and i'll call the pest control
[1:06:30] and they'll treat those termites
[1:06:33] before they can have an effect on my
[1:06:35] house
[1:06:36] but if i'm not inspecting my house daily
[1:06:40] there may be termites eaten away
[1:06:44] and i don't know it until the house
[1:06:45] comes crashing down
[1:06:48] psalm 63 when i will seek the lord early
[1:06:51] early will i seek thee my soul thirst us
[1:06:53] thirst death for thee
[1:06:55] in other words he's seeking him early
[1:06:57] because he's he's he's thirsty
[1:07:02] you know you can be so dehydrated you're
[1:07:04] you know
[1:07:06] unhealthy and not even be thirsty
[1:07:08] when you're getting electrolytes and
[1:07:10] you're keeping yourself hydrated you
[1:07:12] will be thirsty in time to drink the
[1:07:14] water you need to stay healthy
[1:07:16] but if you go past a certain point you
[1:07:18] i'm not thirsty you haven't had water in
[1:07:20] you know 12 hours
[1:07:23] but when you keep thirsty when you keep
[1:07:25] the salt or the electrolytes in your
[1:07:27] body then you will be thirsty so when
[1:07:29] you keep close to god when you keep in
[1:07:31] the sanctuary of god you're thirsty for
[1:07:33] him so as soon as something goes wrong
[1:07:35] you go straight to him
[1:07:36] my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and
[1:07:39] thirsty land where no water is are we in
[1:07:41] the dry and thirsty land
[1:07:43] yes the answer is yes there is no water
[1:07:47] out there
[1:07:48] to see thy power and thy glory so as
[1:07:51] so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary
[1:07:54] because thy loving kindness is better
[1:07:56] than life my lips shall praise thee thus
[1:07:59] will i bless thee while i live i will
[1:08:01] lift up my hands in thy name
[1:08:05] my soul shall be satisfied as with
[1:08:07] marrow and fatness and my mouth shall
[1:08:10] praise thee with joyful lips
[1:08:12] when i remember thee upon my bed and
[1:08:14] meditate on thee in the night watches
[1:08:17] because thou has been my help therefore
[1:08:19] in the shadow of thy wings
[1:08:21] will i rejoice
[1:08:25] where are you going to find joy in your
[1:08:26] life you're lacking joy in your life
[1:08:27] where are you going to find it the
[1:08:29] shadow of the wings of christ
[1:08:31] aka
[1:08:32] the spiritual sanctuary for the bride
[1:08:35] brother brown says in the inter
[1:08:37] intervale 1956 if you walk into a a
[1:08:40] little fellowship with the church again
[1:08:43] with that again there's seven golden
[1:08:44] candlesticks where the offering was only
[1:08:46] made and the sacrifice burned
[1:08:51] okay
[1:08:52] you'll still have smoky days and rainy
[1:08:54] days cloudy days and days when the
[1:08:56] lights was out days in the lamp smoked
[1:08:59] up the experience you've seen miss jones
[1:09:01] over there who was supposed to be a
[1:09:02] christian do something that wasn't right
[1:09:04] and you say oh i wonder if there's
[1:09:05] anything to to it what did i say earlier
[1:09:08] oh the whole message is bad because of
[1:09:09] these miss jones out here you still got
[1:09:12] your eyes on miss jones see you're still
[1:09:15] walking with artificial light
[1:09:18] but the man who walked in behind that
[1:09:20] holiest of holies it didn't matter
[1:09:22] whether the sunshine or not
[1:09:27] what's going to get you through the
[1:09:28] storm
[1:09:30] the source of light
[1:09:33] didn't matter whether the candles burned
[1:09:34] or not he lived in the light of the
[1:09:36] chicago where the pillar of fire dwelt
[1:09:38] under the interlocked wings of the
[1:09:40] cherubim the shadow of his wings and all
[1:09:43] the time he was walking in the perfect
[1:09:45] light and fellowship he didn't look out
[1:09:47] to the outside to the rainy days you
[1:09:49] noticed the tabernacle of the woodland
[1:09:51] didn't have windows
[1:09:53] there's a reason
[1:09:55] you don't need to be looking out there
[1:10:00] you don't you don't need to know if it's
[1:10:01] raining
[1:10:03] there's only one window in the ark and
[1:10:05] look up
[1:10:07] you don't even know if the floods are
[1:10:09] still going
[1:10:10] you don't need to be concerned with the
[1:10:12] turmoil outside of here
[1:10:14] seem to be focused on one thing and
[1:10:16] that's christ because he will give you
[1:10:18] everything you need listen if you need
[1:10:20] to know
[1:10:22] they signed a bill
[1:10:24] christ will show you amen
[1:10:26] there was never a rainy day never a
[1:10:28] doubt never a time that he was hungry
[1:10:30] for god there's nothing wrong with
[1:10:32] keeping up in the times i'm not saying
[1:10:33] that i'm just saying don't get so caught
[1:10:35] up in that that that's all you're
[1:10:36] focusing on because then you're going to
[1:10:38] be walking around a nervous wreck full
[1:10:40] of anxiety because the world's ending
[1:10:42] guess what yes
[1:10:47] there is never a rainy day never a doubt
[1:10:49] never a time that he was hungry for god
[1:10:51] because in him was stored up the man of
[1:10:54] god the word built up into a righteous
[1:10:57] foundation he had not to worry no more
[1:11:00] certainly not he was inside the world
[1:11:03] was on the outside
[1:11:05] i was thinking of this of this thought
[1:11:07] that the spiritual sanctuary for the
[1:11:09] bride and i have to be honest i got a
[1:11:10] bit of a cozy feeling you know whenever
[1:11:13] whenever you you know you've been into a
[1:11:14] storm in it and it sounds silly because
[1:11:16] the tent is is really not much
[1:11:18] protection but you're inside a tent and
[1:11:20] it's storming and it's raining it's cozy
[1:11:23] inside the tent you're protected from
[1:11:25] the weather
[1:11:28] and that's how it is with christ it's
[1:11:29] storming out there
[1:11:32] it's crazy out there they're gonna come
[1:11:33] up with some new thing
[1:11:36] that's just gonna blow your mind
[1:11:39] but guess what you're safe and cozy
[1:11:42] you curl up in the fire with a cup of
[1:11:44] tea
[1:11:45] the spiritual sanctuary for the bride
[1:11:47] goshen right
[1:11:49] different words same thing
[1:11:51] goshen the spiritual sanctuary for the
[1:11:53] bride tabernacle of the wilderness
[1:11:54] spiritual sanctuary for the bride being
[1:11:56] in christ
[1:11:58] coming to church
[1:12:00] coming to church this is a safe place
[1:12:03] for you to connect with god
[1:12:06] god it's a it's a preordained
[1:12:08] foreordained
[1:12:10] position that god
[1:12:12] has has told you to fulfill
[1:12:16] go to church
[1:12:17] like they said you shall be streaming
[1:12:20] two shall be left nothing against our
[1:12:22] streamers
[1:12:27] i know there's some that
[1:12:30] you know your cousin didn't want that it
[1:12:31] doesn't have a choice this is how it is
[1:12:33] sometimes
[1:12:36] god will lead you to what you need
[1:12:38] chapter eight he that hath the key of
[1:12:40] david this beautiful phrase follows and
[1:12:42] comes out of the preceding phrase he
[1:12:44] that is true christ the perfect
[1:12:46] realization contrasted with partial
[1:12:49] realization this is the chapter 8 church
[1:12:52] book here it is moses was a prophet of
[1:12:54] god but jesus like unto moses was the
[1:12:57] prophet this is the long quote but i
[1:12:58] think it just really caps us off tonight
[1:13:01] and we're closing here in a little bit
[1:13:03] so moses was a prophet of god but jesus
[1:13:06] like unto moses was the prophet of god
[1:13:09] david a man after god's own heart was
[1:13:11] king of israel but jesus is the greater
[1:13:14] david king of kings the lord of lords
[1:13:16] god very god now david was born of the
[1:13:18] tribe of judah out of whom no priests
[1:13:21] came yet he ate of the showbread
[1:13:24] reserved for priests he was the great
[1:13:26] warrior overcoming the enemy
[1:13:28] establishing the people as king he sat
[1:13:31] on the throne he was a prophet he was a
[1:13:33] wonderful type of christ now it says in
[1:13:35] isaiah 22 22 and the key of the house of
[1:13:38] david will lay upon his shoulder so he
[1:13:41] shall open and none shall shut and he
[1:13:43] shall shut and none shall open the
[1:13:46] spirit uses this old testament reference
[1:13:48] concerning the lord jesus christ and his
[1:13:50] ministry in the church
[1:13:52] what the key of david signified at that
[1:13:55] time is a mere shadow which is now
[1:13:56] fulfilled in jesus standing in the midst
[1:13:59] of the lamp stands it has to do with our
[1:14:02] lord after his resurrection and not his
[1:14:05] earthly pilgrimage what does this key
[1:14:08] signify the answer lies in the position
[1:14:11] of the king it is not in his hand it is
[1:14:14] not
[1:14:15] worn around his neck it is not placed in
[1:14:18] the hands of other men or the verse
[1:14:20] could not be saying that he alone has
[1:14:22] the use of that key for he alone opens
[1:14:25] and shuts and no man has the right but
[1:14:27] jesus himself it's not right but where
[1:14:29] is the key it is on his shoulder but
[1:14:32] what does shoulder have to do with it
[1:14:34] read isaiah 9 6 stay with me i know it's
[1:14:37] long and the government shall be upon
[1:14:39] his shoulder but what does this mean the
[1:14:41] answer is this the phrase government
[1:14:43] upon his shoulder comes from the wedding
[1:14:46] ceremony of the east when the bride has
[1:14:48] been committed to the groom she takes
[1:14:50] off her veil and places it over the
[1:14:52] groom's shoulders signifying that not
[1:14:55] only is is she under his dominion that
[1:14:57] she has transferred her rights to him
[1:15:00] that he is the head but also that he
[1:15:03] bears the responsibility glory i could
[1:15:06] shout on that right now he bears the
[1:15:09] responsibility it's not up to you saints
[1:15:11] of god it is not up to you all you have
[1:15:14] to do is lay the veil upon his shoulder
[1:15:17] and he takes all responsibility he takes
[1:15:21] all concern he takes all situations he
[1:15:24] takes whether or not this is strange
[1:15:26] fire or truth upon his shoulders all you
[1:15:29] have to do is get in there with him so
[1:15:32] he goes on to say he says
[1:15:36] responsibility and the care and that he
[1:15:38] and he alone no one else no other man no
[1:15:42] other power has any right and
[1:15:44] responsibility
[1:15:45] but you have to give it to him amen and
[1:15:48] that beloved is the key of david god
[1:15:51] being sovereign he foreknew by divine
[1:15:53] decree exactly who would be his bride he
[1:15:57] chose her
[1:15:59] she did not choose him he called her she
[1:16:02] did not come on her own he died for her
[1:16:05] he washed her in his own blood he paid
[1:16:07] the price for her she belongs to him and
[1:16:11] to him alone she is wholly committed to
[1:16:14] him and he accepts the obligation
[1:16:18] he said ruth i will redeem you the other
[1:16:22] one said i can't it'll mar my
[1:16:24] my inheritance but boaz says i can do it
[1:16:28] i can redeem you no one else but christ
[1:16:33] can redeem you no one else can see you
[1:16:36] through this age but christ who has
[1:16:39] redeemed you
[1:16:41] as
[1:16:43] she is wholly committed to him and he
[1:16:45] accepts the obligation
[1:16:47] she he is her head for christ is the
[1:16:50] head of his church
[1:16:53] as sarah called abraham lord even so the
[1:16:55] bride is happy
[1:16:57] that he is her lord you make him happy
[1:17:02] you make him happy amen or the bride is
[1:17:05] happy i'm sorry i read that wrong
[1:17:07] but you do make him happy when you
[1:17:09] accept his request when you when you
[1:17:11] accepted his invitation amen you
[1:17:15] completed him amen there is no christ
[1:17:19] without mrs jesus christ it's the bride
[1:17:22] it's the whole completion that's the
[1:17:24] whole point of the of the whole thing
[1:17:27] as sarah called abraham lord even so the
[1:17:29] bride is happy that he is her lord
[1:17:32] he speaks and she obeys for that is her
[1:17:36] delight amen it is our delight to serve
[1:17:39] our husband jesus christ but there's
[1:17:41] only one place you can do that and it's
[1:17:43] the place he set up the spiritual
[1:17:46] sanctuary for the bride what's one of
[1:17:48] the first things you know people women
[1:17:51] especially women when they leave the
[1:17:53] message they chop their hair off because
[1:17:55] they could never accept the headship of
[1:17:58] christ amen and it's a type amen it's a
[1:18:01] time what is that what did the
[1:18:02] denominational churches started to do
[1:18:04] back when brother brandon was was here
[1:18:06] on earth they started cutting their hair
[1:18:08] the women did and then rejecting the
[1:18:09] headship of christ amen when you
[1:18:12] don't accept god's god's headship amen
[1:18:16] you share your glory
[1:18:19] because it's with christ that your
[1:18:21] filthy rags have been made righteousness
[1:18:24] it's with christ that you have glory in
[1:18:27] the kingdom of god but as soon as you
[1:18:29] reject the hardship of christ you
[1:18:31] separate yourself from your glory amen
[1:18:33] amen and now you have no part until you
[1:18:36] can get back to a place where you can
[1:18:38] step in and say i surrender and lay the
[1:18:41] veil upon his shoulder the veil amen
[1:18:44] what is it what what happens when you
[1:18:46] don't have revelation of christ your
[1:18:48] eyes are veiled but god has come and by
[1:18:51] accepting his
[1:18:53] his request
[1:18:55] his his his desire will you marry me
[1:18:57] when he got down
[1:18:59] then when he got down on the ground when
[1:19:01] he laid his life down
[1:19:03] you accepted his invitation and then he
[1:19:07] took the veil from your eyes amen now
[1:19:09] you're able to see him clearly and now
[1:19:12] without see when you're veiled you can't
[1:19:14] have an intimate relationship
[1:19:17] until the veil is removed
[1:19:20] he removes the veil from your eyes you
[1:19:22] see christ for who he is and then and
[1:19:25] now you can go inside the tent
[1:19:27] the spiritual sanctuary and accept
[1:19:30] christ except the show bread there's
[1:19:32] light
[1:19:33] i mean there's nothing more romantic
[1:19:35] than a candlelight dinner
[1:19:37] you'll find that inside the spiritual
[1:19:39] sanctuary for the bride musicians want
[1:19:41] to come tonight
[1:19:43] so what's the whole what is it
[1:19:45] you must live within the spiritual
[1:19:47] sanctuary for the bride
[1:19:49] that's where you're gonna find safety
[1:19:51] when the storms blow people come up with
[1:19:54] doctrines or you see things that you
[1:19:56] don't understand or even just life
[1:19:58] happens you're gonna find safety in the
[1:20:00] spiritual sanctuary and inside that
[1:20:03] place and then you'll get a relationship
[1:20:06] with christ and it is that relationship
[1:20:08] that's going to give you the hidden
[1:20:10] manner that will not spoil in the
[1:20:12] darkness amen but the way one the way
[1:20:15] you have to what you have to do to step
[1:20:17] into there you have to move aside all
[1:20:18] your secrets
[1:20:20] you got to lay all your secrets down
[1:20:22] everything you thought you would be or
[1:20:25] you hoped you would be you have to put
[1:20:27] into christ
[1:20:28] [Music]
