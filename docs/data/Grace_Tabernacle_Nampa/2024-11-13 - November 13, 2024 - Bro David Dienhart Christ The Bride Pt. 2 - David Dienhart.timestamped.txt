[46:29] this and he said I mean substance Faith
[46:31] so when a man lives by substance
[46:34] Faith he is
[46:37] isolated from the entire
[46:39] world praise the
[46:41] Lord I say praise the
[46:44] Lord and becomes a new creature in
[46:47] Christ there now you're getting into
[46:50] bride
[46:52] material when a man lives by substance
[46:55] faith
[46:57] that's God's own faith and me just
[46:59] you've heard me quote this many times
[47:01] but the real believer is the faith of
[47:03] God that moves in
[47:04] him so it's operating it's alive it's
[47:07] living it's
[47:09] substance
[47:11] and we know that in God's mind his
[47:16] thoughts was
[47:18] substance the thoughts of himself I
[47:21] should say Let me clarify it not
[47:22] everything he thought but the thoughts
[47:24] of himself was substance faith because
[47:27] they were existing they were real and
[47:29] you were those thoughts you were a part
[47:32] of those thoughts so you were existing
[47:35] and you're real that's why today that's
[47:37] why today that when a man lives by
[47:39] substance Faith he's isolated from the
[47:42] entire world he's a new creature in
[47:43] Christ he said now there you're getting
[47:45] into bride material you're getting into
[47:48] rapturing
[47:52] condition he gives the orders he's your
[47:54] head so he gives the orders you pack
[47:56] back them out and that's where the rub
[47:59] comes I say the rub meaning that's where
[48:02] you're going to be in a battle because
[48:05] God
[48:06] says faith let Faith have its
[48:12] work let Faith
[48:14] produce and so when we when we come down
[48:19] to hearing the word we it's good to see
[48:21] our position we're preaching on it it's
[48:23] good to see where we're positionally
[48:24] placed who we are but now carry it out
[48:28] out now now take that word that's
[48:31] revealed to you and tomorrow by that
[48:33] Faith act out and take possession of
[48:37] what God made promised to you I don't
[48:39] care if it takes a hundred years he's
[48:41] got to bring it to pass God must fulfill
[48:44] his word and you're a part of that word
[48:47] his word will not return void neither
[48:49] will you return void being in him his
[48:51] word will not return void nor no nor
[48:55] what he sends forth can't return to him
[48:58] void it must go out and fulfill the
[49:00] purpose he sent it
[49:03] for amen so I'm going to so
[49:06] remember he said there's not a shadow
[49:09] whatever he says you pack it out there's
[49:11] not a shadow of it doubt nowhere you
[49:13] walk right on if the Lord says this
[49:15] there's nobody in the world can talk you
[49:17] out of it you go right on just the same
[49:19] amen now you're coming into perfect
[49:22] Faith perfect Perfection which cannot
[49:25] fail that faith
[49:27] never fails yes you'll be a Mystic to
[49:30] them he was a Mystic with his perfect
[49:33] Faith you're going to be you're going to
[49:35] be persecuted they're going to think
[49:36] you're crazy because you're living by
[49:38] something that's unseen but yet you know
[49:41] it's seen you see it because it's
[49:45] substance amen he was a Mystic with his
[49:49] perfect Faith so are those who have
[49:51] perfect Faith you're a Mystic to others
[49:54] amen
[49:58] amen now we know that in St John 14:1 he
[50:03] said I've gone to prepare a place for
[50:04] you and I will come again and receive
[50:08] you and and that's exactly what's
[50:11] happening that's what's been happening
[50:14] that's why the seals were opened that's
[50:16] why the the those seven angels that came
[50:19] down he says here he says he says
[50:25] now the first time he
[50:28] come he come to redeem his bride there's
[50:33] three comings of Christ the first time
[50:35] he come he come to redeem his bride the
[50:38] second time he comes to catch away his
[50:41] bride now people look at that say well
[50:44] we haven't come to that yet oh yes we
[50:46] have come to it it's in progress we just
[50:48] haven't come to the end of it
[50:51] yet are you with me see there's a
[50:54] there's a progression of that there's
[50:56] there's a faith related to that there's
[50:58] there's there's a mystery of his coming
[51:01] and that's what the bride sees she sees
[51:04] his
[51:06] coming why because she's a part of
[51:10] it amen she's in it she actually is his
[51:16] coming because the way he comes it how
[51:19] he comes that's the mystery that was
[51:21] under that seventh
[51:23] seal and that's the mystery that brother
[51:26] Brandon preach called Christ The Mystery
[51:28] of God
[51:29] revealed amen that he preached that
[51:33] message was preaching the seventh
[51:39] seal and he said now so he comes he said
[51:43] but this coming the catch away his bride
[51:45] is Like A Love Affair now these are just
[51:48] things you heard me I'm just coming back
[51:50] just a little bit here before we go
[51:52] forward he said it's like a love
[51:54] affair he said no remember brother Bram
[51:57] said in perfect Faith the same message
[51:59] or not the same message message I read
[52:00] from he said this he said he's pouring
[52:04] out himself into her they are becoming
[52:06] one for the wedding supper and then he
[52:09] go I'm not quoting the whole thing
[52:10] exactly but he said but it's a love
[52:12] affair they are becoming one so there is
[52:15] your there is your union taking place
[52:18] he's come to receive you who's come the
[52:21] bridegroom the marriage has
[52:25] come amen
[52:27] anybody believe that the marriage is
[52:29] come let us be glad and be Rejoice for
[52:32] the marriage of the Lamb is
[52:34] come all right so he says now so it's a
[52:40] love affair he comes around and steals
[52:41] her out her out he steals her out at
[52:44] night time Isaiah 60 verse1 and two said
[52:47] it's night
[52:48] time yes gross Darkness Darkness upon
[52:52] the people gross I mean gross Darkness
[52:55] upon the world gross darkness of people
[52:58] but the light is upon thee and the and
[53:01] the glory of the Lord is seen upon thee
[53:04] you know he doesn't share his glory with
[53:06] everyone with no he doesn't share his
[53:08] glory with anyone he shares his glory
[53:11] with
[53:13] himself see you're not anyone you're not
[53:16] you're not you're not another excuse me
[53:18] he doesn't share his glory with another
[53:21] but you're not another all right you're
[53:24] him so but he takes her out at nighttime
[53:28] right in the midst of gross Darkness
[53:30] he's taking her
[53:33] out amen there's a going how many
[53:35] believe there's a
[53:37] going at the same time there's a going
[53:40] there's a
[53:42] coming all right we couldn't have a
[53:45] going without a
[53:47] coming and we couldn't be going without
[53:49] coming
[53:50] somewhere right that's right we're going
[53:53] somewhere aren't we but it's by his
[53:55] coming all right now that sounds strange
[53:57] that sounds like double talk but that's
[53:59] the truth all right now so he steals her
[54:03] out at night time takes her away from
[54:05] the
[54:06] world so the second time he come he's
[54:09] just referring again again what he said
[54:11] the second time is to receive his
[54:13] bride to catch away his bride is to
[54:16] receive his bride amen first time to
[54:19] redeem her second time to receive her
[54:21] third time with her king and queen other
[54:24] words you step out in the millennium you
[54:26] step out you walk upon the ashes of the
[54:29] wicked
[54:31] together remember brother Braham said
[54:34] the the the calvary man Jesus Christ Our
[54:37] Lord and Redeemer will not step foot on
[54:39] the earth until the
[54:42] Millennium amen so see who's he come out
[54:45] with amen the family comes walking out
[54:49] yeah God is family all right so what do
[54:53] we coming out to again we're walking

[54:57] Eden amen right back right back into the
[55:01] Seventh Day the Earth was in a seventh
[55:03] day is that right he was in the seventh
[55:05] day we go right back into that seventh
[55:07] day for the bride it's not seventh day
[55:11] we're past the seventh day but for the
[55:13] Earth it's in its seventh
[55:16] day amen and what is that seventh day
[55:19] it's it's in its Sabbath it's
[55:22] rest all right so now he said
[55:27] so we can find that and I'm going to
[55:29] miss some of these scriptures but in in
[55:32] uh well let's go to first Thessalonians
[55:35] 4:16 or four chapter 4 Thessalonians
[55:40] chapter
[55:46] 4 all right
[55:52] then and watch your walk with him your
[55:55] walk with him
[55:57] is is you see it's not it his secret
[56:01] catching away of his bride of course is
[56:04] in the
[56:05] night now he now he's coming his coming
[56:09] his coming is known only to who his

[56:17] thing this great event this great thing
[56:19] is happening and nobody knows about it
[56:23] but the bride that's right
[56:26] amen
[56:29] amen not all to claim to believe this
[56:32] message is
[56:34] bride but there is a bride that is the
[56:41] message and
[56:44] so and so in first
[56:46] Thessalonians and I want to make note of
[56:50] 16 for the Lord himself shall descend
[56:55] from heaven
[56:57] with a shout with the voice of the
[57:00] Archangel with the Trump and with the
[57:03] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[57:05] shall rise first
[57:08] notice what follows this
[57:11] descending is that the dead in Christ
[57:13] will rise
[57:16] first so where are
[57:19] we in this Union he does all three
[57:23] things while he descends
[57:26] said he does all three there's a shout a
[57:28] message there's the voice of the
[57:31] resurrection and there's a trump of
[57:34] gathering amen are you with me that's
[57:37] all three while he descends it's in his
[57:40] descent but what follows the
[57:43] descending the Resurrection The Catching
[57:46] away in in the air amen so we can't
[57:50] misplace these
[57:52] things we must take it the way the
[57:54] prophet interpreted it
[57:56] and don't try to put your interpretation
[57:58] to what he
[58:00] said because you
[58:03] can't you can't add to it you can't take
[58:06] away from it all right
[58:11] now let's go to I want I'm just going to
[58:15] make me let's take verse 17 then we
[58:18] which are alive and remain shall be
[58:21] caught up together with them in the
[58:23] clouds clouds is a multitude great great
[58:26] multitude to meet the Lord in the air
[58:29] and and to ever and so shall we ever be
[58:34] with the
[58:35] Lord he said wherefore Comfort one
[58:38] another with these
[58:40] words all
[58:44] right let's take acts one
[58:47] again so we can just get these things in
[58:50] our hearts acts chap
[58:53] 1 you know where we're going verse 9
[59:01] and when he had spoken these things
[59:03] let's take verse eight so we just get it
[59:05] in continuity but ye but he but you
[59:07] shall receive power after that the Holy
[59:09] Ghost has come upon you and you shall be
[59:12] Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[59:15] in all Judea and Samaria and unto the
[59:17] uttermost parts of the earth and when he
[59:20] had spoken these things while they
[59:22] beheld he was taken up and a cloud
[59:24] received him out of their sight
[59:26] and while they looked steadfastly toward
[59:29] Heaven as he went up behold two men
[59:31] stood by them in white apparel which
[59:34] said to you men of Galilee why stand you
[59:36] gazing into heaven this same Jesus not
[59:40] another are you with me this same
[59:44] Jesus which is taken up from you into
[59:48] heaven shall so come in like
[59:51] manner as you've seen him go into heaven
[59:55] and and he shall
[59:58] descend amen with a shout the message
[1:00:03] how many know the shout is the message
[1:00:05] amen the message has a
[1:00:07] voice and the voice the message John
[1:00:10] Heard a Voice as of a
[1:00:12] trumpet
[1:00:13] amen amen so we see here and let's go
[1:00:19] on in modern events made clear by
[1:00:24] prophecy he he said dear God as this
[1:00:27] audience bows their head and heart in
[1:00:29] this solemn moments here of closing this
[1:00:31] Bible lecture when we see the
[1:00:34] Vindication of the Holy Spirit shook
[1:00:36] this nation back and forth great
[1:00:38] revivals and indications other words
[1:00:41] great revivals brother Braham said I've
[1:00:42] seen great things healing of the sick
[1:00:45] great miracles signs and wonders done by
[1:00:49] only Christ himself is that right all
[1:00:53] right but he said but something has has
[1:00:56] to follow
[1:00:58] that and and then see those seven angels
[1:01:01] come down here on the top of the
[1:01:03] mountain brother Braham said those seven
[1:01:05] angels represented the seven churches
[1:01:07] all
[1:01:09] completed they took the picture not us
[1:01:13] they took the picture of them amen all
[1:01:17] right where was his authority expressed
[1:01:20] through those Messengers he who Jesus
[1:01:24] Christ all right
[1:01:26] so he said and came down there on top of
[1:01:28] the mountain Yonder in Arizona and even
[1:01:30] magazines across the Nations packed it
[1:01:32] to see Jesus himself now I'm I'm I'm we
[1:01:35] made emphasis on this at the end of the
[1:01:37] meeting but I want to come back to this
[1:01:39] to see Jesus himself there in the skies
[1:01:43] looking down and
[1:01:46] speaking
[1:01:49] saying saying in Revelation in the
[1:01:52] Revelation 10:7 notice you say well he
[1:01:55] didn't he didn't say yes he did say
[1:01:57] because he had to go there to get the
[1:02:02] revelation of the message in Revelation
[1:02:04] 10 brother brah said I had to go there
[1:02:07] West be caught up there to meet that
[1:02:11] notable Angel are you with me and he
[1:02:14] said I had I had that held that seventh
[1:02:17] seal and come back and open those that
[1:02:21] those seals up amen are you with me all
[1:02:25] right so he said to see and saying in
[1:02:28] the he's saying how's he saying in the
[1:02:30] scripture he's saying the Revelation
[1:02:33] 10:7 in the seventh Angel's
[1:02:35] message these seals would be open the
[1:02:38] mysteries of God would be
[1:02:41] known the reformers didn't live long
[1:02:43] enough to bring it out and here those
[1:02:45] Seven Seals that sealed the whole thing
[1:02:48] that sealed the whole thing is to be
[1:02:50] opened in this
[1:02:53] day and all those great signs signs and
[1:02:56] wonders that's been done Vindicated
[1:02:58] foretold before it happened they was
[1:03:01] foretelling before it happened not one
[1:03:03] time if you fa has you ever have you
[1:03:05] ever failed us but brought it to pass
[1:03:07] just as it was said I'm going to go to
[1:03:10] paragraph 12 of rising of the sun he
[1:03:13] said this here he said and and so there
[1:03:15] he spoke to me and said the Seven Seals
[1:03:19] be
[1:03:20] opened he said the Sevenfold mystery of
[1:03:24] the Bible that been closed since the
[1:03:26] foundation of the world will be
[1:03:31] revealed and he said we as a humble
[1:03:34] little group compared with all the world
[1:03:35] we've enjoyed these
[1:03:38] blessings he said those blessings in
[1:03:41] hearing those Mysteries such as he would
[1:03:43] say marriage divorce serpent seed all
[1:03:47] these different questions has been
[1:03:49] completely revealed to us not by
[1:03:53] man but by God
[1:03:57] himself that's now watch you say not by
[1:04:01] man no he used man but when that man
[1:04:04] that Prophet had that sword strike his
[1:04:07] hand whose hand was it
[1:04:10] striking who held it other words if he
[1:04:12] held the sword in his
[1:04:15] hand then God held it in his
[1:04:19] hand amen are you with me William
[1:04:22] brandham isn't God I'm not making him
[1:04:23] God but God was standing there with the
[1:04:26] sword in his
[1:04:29] hand that's exactly right because we've
[1:04:32] got to look Beyond and realize the word
[1:04:35] comes to His prophets nobody could hold
[1:04:38] that sword but God himself so who was
[1:04:41] standing there who did open those
[1:04:44] seals are you with me I hope we get what
[1:04:47] I'm saying here all right I'm not
[1:04:49] lifting up a man but I am lifting up the
[1:04:51] Lord Jesus the lion of the tribe of
[1:04:53] Judah who manifests himself as
[1:04:57] lamb hello all right now he said these
[1:05:03] sealed these these things these
[1:05:04] questions have been completed revealed
[1:05:06] to us not by man but by God himself
[1:05:09] that's opened those seven mysteries of
[1:05:12] what and brother brandom called it a
[1:05:13] Sevenfold
[1:05:15] mystery it's a Sevenfold
[1:05:18] mystery he said of what the watch what
[1:05:21] the mystery watch what watch what these
[1:05:23] seals have opened up watch your promise
[1:05:26] for today watch his coming watch what's
[1:05:32] happening watch your

[1:05:46] beginning and how it will be revealed in
[1:05:49] the last
[1:05:53] day all right
[1:05:56] now I believe there he's speaking not of
[1:05:58] the church
[1:05:59] natural he's speaking of the
[1:06:05] bride and he said if you'll just turn
[1:06:07] this picture like this and look you can
[1:06:09] probably see it from the audience it's
[1:06:11] Christ now he's referring to the cloud

[1:06:16] Christ see his eyes looking here just as
[1:06:19] perfect could be wearing the white wig
[1:06:21] of supreme deity and we're going to come

[1:09:24] the truth
[1:09:26] amen this is the truth it's
[1:09:30] true not making him a third person but
[1:09:32] the only

[1:10:23] dark his face face his beard his
[1:10:28] eyes and looking he from him comes the
[1:10:32] light he said in the light of his
[1:10:34] resurrection we go forth in his
[1:10:39] name praise the Lord he said we at the
[1:10:42] end time he said the he said when that
[1:10:44] light came down there in Jeffersonville
[1:10:46] in 1933 and spoke these words as John
[1:10:49] the Baptist was sent to forerun the
[1:10:51] first coming of Christ your message
[1:10:56] right your message yeah that's
[1:11:00] right will
[1:11:02] forun the second
[1:11:05] coming we're at the end time and we were
[1:11:11] at the end time that's when it was to
[1:11:13] come forth he said and we see
[1:11:18] it all right I'll leave that okay
[1:11:28] he come to redeem all that was on that
[1:11:32] book now in this day in this day there's
[1:11:37] to come a super let's just back up here
[1:11:40] a
[1:11:42] minute in this day the scripture is
[1:11:44] fulfilled the Holy Ghost is the word of
[1:11:47] God in
[1:11:49] you what is the Holy Ghost the
[1:11:52] quickening power it's the quickener it's
[1:11:55] the quickening spirit that new creation
[1:11:58] is the second
[1:12:01] man which is the quickening spirit which
[1:12:04] brother brandom said the real you is the
[1:12:06] spirit of God that Spirit In
[1:12:09] You And he says the Holy Ghost is the
[1:12:12] word of God in you and watch what it
[1:12:14] does that identifies itself that
[1:12:16] identifies
[1:12:18] Itself by accepting that
[1:12:22] word watch what he says I'll of that it
[1:12:25] can't be the Holy Ghost if it says it's
[1:12:28] the Holy Spirit and denies one word of
[1:12:31] that Bible it cannot be the Holy Spirit
[1:12:34] that's the
[1:12:36] evidence whether you believe or not what
[1:12:39] is the evidence by accepting the
[1:12:43] word and if you accept the word you say
[1:12:45] oh I accept everybody said we accept the
[1:12:48] word but they can't live
[1:12:50] it they can't manifest it but this bride
[1:12:54] is the very manifestation of that
[1:12:59] word what that's her position that's
[1:13:01] what she's called to
[1:13:04] do all right now so he said now we find
[1:13:09] out the condition of the world we see
[1:13:11] where the church n normal or he's he's
[1:13:13] meaning nominal the organization
[1:13:16] denomination we see where they are we
[1:13:18] see where the nations are we see that
[1:13:21] this day we and we see that this day
[1:13:24] these promises is
[1:13:26] fulfilled do we absolutely all right now
[1:13:31] he said now but but now but in this day
[1:13:34] there's to come a
[1:13:37] super Royal Seed of
[1:13:41] Abraham now what would you say that
[1:13:44] super Royal Seed of Abraham is it's
[1:13:48] Christ there's no other super Royal seed
[1:13:52] but
[1:13:53] Christ now remember remember my title
[1:13:55] we're continuing with my title Christ
[1:13:58] the bride we're continuing with the move
[1:14:01] is on for the bride that's what we're
[1:14:03] talking about this moving this move is
[1:14:07] on for the
[1:14:08] bride not for another for the bride not
[1:14:12] for the church the
[1:14:14] bride all
[1:14:16] right but this but in this day there's
[1:14:19] to come a super Royal Seed of Abraham
[1:14:22] which we said is Christ that's exactly
[1:14:24] what it would be yes now watch what he's
[1:14:28] saying what it would be would be a royal
[1:14:31] bride to the Royal promised son so now
[1:14:35] we have a promise now we see what is
[1:14:38] coming how he would manifest it now we
[1:14:40] see what he is and where his second
[1:14:43] coming is
[1:14:46] unfolding where is
[1:14:48] it in this Royal bride Christ as I spoke
[1:14:54] last night it won't be a natural seed
[1:14:55] it'll be a spiritual seed just like it
[1:14:59] was in
[1:15:01] Mary amen but watch Mary had to be
[1:15:07] delivered and when she was
[1:15:09] delivered what what was that God in sun
[1:15:12] form are you with
[1:15:14] me what about when she's delivered today
[1:15:17] what would it be God in Bride
[1:15:21] form you say when I today would it would
[1:15:24] it be I'm talking about the Pentecostal
[1:15:27] shook amen when she comes out of that
[1:15:31] shook what is she and the shuck has to
[1:15:34] let go life is left the shuck then
[1:15:38] where's the bride she's the word
[1:15:40] manifested for the day the promise of
[1:15:43] the
[1:15:44] day
[1:15:45] amen are you with me don't I want to
[1:15:48] lose you here there's not very many here
[1:15:51] so we're just you know we got to just
[1:15:54] keep bringing the these things out here
[1:15:56] okay
[1:15:57] now there's to be a spiritual bride
[1:16:00] raised up which will be the Royal seed
[1:16:03] of the RO watch of the royal
[1:16:10] faith
[1:16:12] of Abraham's royal son she is to come on
[1:16:17] the scene she is to come on the scene in
[1:16:20] the last days what would she be she
[1:16:23] would be Christ coming on the scene in
[1:16:25] the last days and the time and the place
[1:16:29] is promise is a promise is a promise
[1:16:32] that's given to
[1:16:36] her now what did the prophet say now we
[1:16:39] see the Promise being
[1:16:44] fulfilled Christ the true
[1:16:47] headship going
[1:16:49] in coming in so I said the going is the
[1:16:54] coming going in coming in his
[1:17:03] bride there'll have to be a message
[1:17:05] according to Malachi 4 there's arise a
[1:17:08] message that will shake the hearts of
[1:17:09] the people right back to the apostolic
[1:17:11] fathers
[1:17:13] again there is to rise one on the scene
[1:17:15] in the power of Elijah that'll rise on
[1:17:18] the scene A wilderness man remember now
[1:17:20] keep in mind I don't have time to quote
[1:17:22] it but the the the messenger of Malachi
[1:17:25] 4 in Revelation 10 does two
[1:17:27] things you know what he said that's
[1:17:29] Church age book okay keep that in
[1:17:35] mind so the one to come on the scene
[1:17:37] will rise on the scene in the power of
[1:17:39] Elijah to raise on the scene A
[1:17:40] wilderness man that'll come out and
[1:17:42] will'll have a message that'll run
[1:17:44] straight right back to the word again
[1:17:48] that's the hour we're living
[1:17:51] in what is the hour we're living in
[1:17:53] Bride age
[1:17:55] seed
[1:17:56] time bride time it'll have to go right
[1:17:59] back to the seed word again but brother
[1:18:02] brandham said what would it be it would
[1:18:03] be a word bride or he called it a bride
[1:18:07] word
[1:18:09] also so it's coming the seed again and
[1:18:13] that's why the prophet said seed time or
[1:18:16] he said or to clarify it bride time
[1:18:20] because she's seed she's
[1:18:23] Christ in feminine
[1:18:26] form as his wife how can the wife be
[1:18:29] anything different than
[1:18:31] him he's not going to marry something
[1:18:34] different than
[1:18:35] himself he'll marry
[1:18:38] himself that sounds strange doesn't it
[1:18:41] but he'll marry himself because she's
[1:18:43] come from him see God is bride God is
[1:18:47] son God is
[1:18:50] family God is
[1:18:52] God all right
[1:18:56] now consider now I ask you at this hour
[1:18:59] you people here of Jeffersonville now
[1:19:01] he's speaking of this day the scriptures
[1:19:03] fulfilled consider now I ask you you
[1:19:06] people of Jeffers ofil in 1933 the
[1:19:09] supernatural light which he called a
[1:19:11] star by the way it was the same star
[1:19:13] that led the wise
[1:19:16] men that's exactly right go back and see
[1:19:19] what he said about it it was moving they
[1:19:22] watched it
[1:19:23] move where we're following that same
[1:19:25] star too you
[1:19:27] know and where does that star lead
[1:19:31] us right to the word made flesh in
[1:19:36] you amen and who is

[1:19:46] don't care what it feels like how it
[1:19:48] appears to be it's
[1:19:51] absolute it cannot fail amen
[1:19:55] all right there has to be something that
[1:19:57] cannot fail because we see a lot that
[1:20:00] does so there's got to be something that
[1:20:03] doesn't is that right how can there be
[1:20:05] failure without one that can't
[1:20:11] fail
[1:20:13] amen all right
[1:20:16] now so that light fell down yonder at
[1:20:19] the river that day when I was baptizing
[1:20:21] 500 in the name of Jesus Christ as about
[1:20:24] 20 years old boy what did it say

[1:20:28] to what it said he said what did it say

[1:20:34] above like a star falling from the
[1:20:35] heaven a voice said as John the Baptist

[1:31:44] fulfilled the going of the Bride the the
[1:31:47] head the head coming in Bride form we
[1:31:49] see it being fulfilled
[1:31:56] those attributes of God we cannot live
[1:31:58] by Creed we cannot live by
[1:32:01] denomination ISM we must live by the
[1:32:03] word because the Bride is a part of the
[1:32:06] bridegroom like any wife is a part of
[1:32:08] her husband therefore therefore we must
[1:32:11] be that word
[1:32:14] bride and what is that word bride the
[1:32:17] manifestation of this
[1:32:19] hour the bride not a Creed or
[1:32:22] denomination but a living Oracle of God
[1:32:25] Living Word brother Brown said she would
[1:32:27] be the word living and in
[1:32:31] action what is the word living
[1:32:34] operative in action all right so we must
[1:32:39] be the word living and in Action a
[1:32:42] living attribute that's an attribute of
[1:32:44] his his thought is himself an attribute
[1:32:47] of God displaying to the world the
[1:32:49] attributes of God watch what he said
[1:32:51] where is it being displayed to the world
[1:32:54] see what is this coming it's going into
[1:32:55] all the world okay where's the
[1:32:58] attributes of God being displayed in the
[1:33:01] formation of the
[1:33:03] Bride where is it in the formation of
[1:33:08] the
[1:33:09] Bride that's to be expressed that's he
[1:33:13] comes again she's to come on the scene
[1:33:15] that's to be expressed expressed what's
[1:33:18] the expression the
[1:33:20] thought you're in the thought and that
[1:33:22] bride to come in the formation of the
[1:33:24] Bride that thought's got to be expressed
[1:33:26] in this hour and when it was expressed
[1:33:29] it called
[1:33:31] you spoke through his bride expressed
[1:33:34] the thought the word for the season and
[1:33:37] it and it found
[1:33:40] you it found you you're a spoken
[1:33:45] word creation you're the word spoken in
[1:33:48] this day made
[1:33:50] manifest all right so it finds you
[1:33:53] that's to express in the hour we're now
[1:33:55] living you're expressed in the hour
[1:33:57] we're now living the manifestation of
[1:34:00] that Spirit of his Spirit then what's it
[1:34:03] doing the manifestation of his spirit is
[1:34:06] not will it is is here's your secret
[1:34:10] catching away is catching a bride
[1:34:17] away he said it right right here works
[1:34:20] as Faith expressed the manifestation of
[1:34:22] his spirit is catching away a bride
[1:34:26] Rapture is in progress that's the coming
[1:34:28] of the lord it's a secret catching away
[1:34:31] just what he said the second coming
[1:34:33] would
[1:34:36] be see that's absolutely contrary to
[1:34:39] every denominational Creed you ever
[1:34:42] heard because they don't see that coming
[1:34:45] they're looking expecting a great
[1:34:47] trumpet to be blown the skies the the
[1:34:49] clouds to break open the clouds have
[1:34:51] broken open but not the way they say
[1:34:53] broke
[1:34:56] are you with me it's see see it's just
[1:35:00] contrary but he comes in Simplicity and
[1:35:02] reveals himself through the same he
[1:35:05] hides in Simplicity and reveals himself
[1:35:07] through the same all right now so so
[1:35:12] that's what it is coming in the
[1:35:14] formation of the Bride is being
[1:35:15] manifested and it's catching away a
[1:35:17] bride let that Faith let that Faith
[1:35:20] substance Faith bride material let that
[1:35:22] Faith Christ
[1:35:24] in you let that faith and he and he has
[1:35:27] in parentheses
[1:35:29] Revelation let that Revelation fall into
[1:35:32] your heart this is the
[1:35:40] hour this is the
[1:35:44] hour oh W be going we have a have that
[1:35:47] hour no this is the hour what we're
[1:35:49] looking for is a consummation of that
[1:35:51] hour which is our catch which is which
[1:35:53] is is the final state of our catching
[1:35:55] away which is the meeting of our loved
[1:35:58] ones and resurrection and meeting him in
[1:36:01] the air who's him our Lord and Savior
[1:36:04] Jesus
[1:36:06] Christ amen because you're United with
[1:36:09] him you're one with him the sign has
[1:36:12] come in the Heavens to announce uniting
[1:36:15] time is
[1:36:19] here he called it the uniting time sign
[1:36:24] all right okay you see the whole program
[1:36:27] the whole church is built upon divine
[1:36:31] revelation
[1:36:34] amen amen of who he was of who he was
[1:36:38] are you with me you have to have that
[1:36:40] revelation of who he was okay but watch
[1:36:43] what he says but now upon he said Upon
[1:36:46] This Rock I'll build my church gates of
[1:36:48] hell can't Prevail against it the
[1:36:50] revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour
[1:36:54] He Still Remains the
[1:36:56] Same it's the same revelation of who he
[1:36:59] was but now who he was is who he is
[1:37:03] because the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:37:05] in this hour not what he was in another
[1:37:09] hour are you with me you watch what he's
[1:37:12] saying he can't change so the Revelation
[1:37:15] so who he is is still who he is but
[1:37:17] what's
[1:37:18] changed not what he was in another hour
[1:37:22] but what he is now now the Bible
[1:37:25] expresses it's growing in the
[1:37:29] bride it's growing
[1:37:32] where it's growing in the bride what is
[1:37:35] growing in the bride the new
[1:37:38] creation it's growing in the bride what
[1:37:40] is the new birth brother brandom it's
[1:37:42] the revelation of Jesus Christ revealed
[1:37:44] personally to
[1:37:46] you it's growing in the
[1:37:50] bride to the full stature
[1:37:54] what's the full stature see himself
[1:37:57] what's himself what's it going to do
[1:37:59] change these
[1:38:02] bodies amen are you with me all right
[1:38:06] therefore
[1:38:09] if see it's just he's just he come into
[1:38:12] a different same person same person the
[1:38:16] bride is not another person she grows up
[1:38:18] into the very person
[1:38:20] himself all right but it's a different
[1:38:22] garment same
[1:38:25] person all right
[1:38:31] now so we understand how the bride had
[1:38:34] to fall in the Dark Ages the grain had
[1:38:35] to fall in the ground to die it can't
[1:38:37] reproduce itself but now it fell in the
[1:38:39] ground and it come up through Luther
[1:38:41] Wesley Pentecost and come out to the
[1:38:43] full stature of the Bride of Jesus
[1:38:45] Christ for this last day
[1:38:50] see it's him in the formation of his
[1:38:53] bride whoever would have dreamed whoever
[1:38:56] had it taught nobody that his coming
[1:38:59] would be this
[1:39:01] way see outside of the of the
[1:39:05] denominational teaching see what they
[1:39:08] missed his first coming is because they
[1:39:10] had him coming another
[1:39:14] way is that right is that why they
[1:39:16] missed it they had it all figured out he
[1:39:18] would come he would they didn't know he
[1:39:20] would they didn't believe he would come
[1:39:22] this way because their theology taught
[1:39:24] him he would come another
[1:39:26] way it's the same thing today
[1:39:29] amen they don't expect him to come like
[1:39:33] this well where is he where is he here
[1:39:36] he
[1:39:39] is yet I say here he is but this is
[1:39:42] what's
[1:39:43] inside well it don't look like the
[1:39:45] calvary man oh well you're just judging
[1:39:48] from an outward appearance the person is
[1:39:51] the Holy Ghost himself
[1:39:55] right oh oh it's Jesus Christ
[1:40:01] revealed amen are you with me all right
[1:40:04] all right so he says
[1:40:08] now so we see when he began to reveal
[1:40:11] himself into the seed form again the
[1:40:15] same one that went in the ground come
[1:40:17] back to be the the same one that went in
[1:40:19] the ground came back to be the bride
[1:40:24] just the bride and groom is the same
[1:40:26] Flesh and
[1:40:27] Blood same
[1:40:30] Ministry the same things doing exactly
[1:40:32] what he done what is it it's the
[1:40:36] spirit but there will come on Earth by
[1:40:38] God's promise a genuine servant of God
[1:40:40] identified by God by his word being the
[1:40:42] answer of this day that'll set the bride
[1:40:45] in order real little minority of the
[1:40:48] church and take it up now you have the
[1:40:51] order right there and take it up he'll
[1:40:53] introduce behold there's the one I
[1:40:55] talked about see that'll come behold
[1:40:58] there's the one I talked about see
[1:41:00] that'll come remember remember John the
[1:41:02] Baptist was on
[1:41:05] earth when Jesus came he said there he
[1:41:09] is Prophet said there he
[1:41:12] is he said that's our Lord up there he
[1:41:15] said in quickening power Let's us see
[1:41:18] his coming quickening power he said one
[1:41:21] come maturity that speak into to
[1:41:23] existence and he said that same
[1:41:25] quickening power will be in the bride in
[1:41:28] their
[1:41:29] mouth amen because they grow into that
[1:41:32] they have to grow in that stature and
[1:41:34] and that wave sheath waved over them and
[1:41:36] every one of those those genuine wheat
[1:41:40] plant seed is going to come to that same
[1:41:45] maturity so see what I we been saying
[1:41:48] we're going to come right back to it
[1:41:49] again to follow him is to take him at
[1:41:51] his word amen is to have his word open
[1:41:55] to you is to know him to know him is the
[1:42:00] word living is the word
[1:42:03] itself amen we've gone beyond the
[1:42:06] emotions I'm not saying I disagree with

[1:42:11] that's no evidence we've come Beyond
[1:42:12] emotion we've come Beyond these things
[1:42:15] into the genuine revelation of the word
[1:42:19] himself that's what Jesus pointed him to
[1:42:23] the signs pointed them to that person on
[1:42:26] Earth
[1:42:27] then if you can't believe me believe the
[1:42:30] works that I do they testify of who I am
[1:42:32] search the scriptures for in them you
[1:42:34] think you have eternal life and they are
[1:42:36] they that testify of me can't the bride

[1:50:09] word that's
[1:50:12] it I can we can truly say this little
[1:50:15] bride is more than a
[1:50:17] man if all we have in this life is this
[1:50:22] to look at to know we are men most
[1:50:25] miserable is that right but we have a
[1:50:28] perfect word living in us a perfect
[1:50:32] birth a perfect creation a perfect word
[1:50:34] a perfect Christ a perfect leader a
[1:50:36] perfect
[1:50:38] guide everything we need is already
[1:50:41] provided even this night was provided
[1:50:44] God knew exactly who would be here
[1:50:47] tonight God knew exactly what I would be
[1:50:49] saying
[1:50:51] tonight and and believing it's him
[1:50:54] saying it you say well you're just
[1:50:56] quoting I'm not just be quoting I'm
[1:50:59] talking about a word that's become alive
[1:51:01] I am preaching
[1:51:03] Faith no matter if I take this the
[1:51:06] quotes and others don't take it it's
[1:51:08] still faith if we speak contrary to what
[1:51:10] he said or contrary I'm not talking
[1:51:12] about well you got to have it just for
[1:51:13] btim no it's saying what he
[1:51:17] said are you with me yes but but God
[1:51:21] trains a certain way and guides a
[1:51:23] certain way and I have a certain
[1:51:25] calling my calling is different than
[1:51:28] that brother standing behind that desk
[1:51:29] back there we can't we have the same
[1:51:32] Christ we have the same but his calling
[1:51:35] is different he's he preaches
[1:51:37] differently that's exactly right I'm not
[1:51:40] ashamed to say that we're not belittling
[1:51:42] anybody it's Christ a many membered body
[1:51:45] it's a god of variety amen he made me
[1:51:48] the way I am happy to stay that way he
[1:51:51] called me to do a certain work in
[1:51:52] certain way and I have to stay in that
[1:51:56] way but there's one thing I'm certain of
[1:51:59] he called me to preach the
[1:52:00] word and he I called me to be a part of
[1:52:03] that fivefold Ministry and he said well
[1:52:06] be un me if I don't preach it so I have
[1:52:08] a
[1:52:09] choice and I'm glad he made the choice
[1:52:12] because that's my
[1:52:13] choice hallelujah how did he make that
[1:52:17] choice CU he knew what I would
[1:52:18] do so if he chose me before the
[1:52:21] foundation all the world knowing what I
[1:52:23] would do then what I would do is make my
[1:52:25] choice for
[1:52:26] him
[1:52:30] hello see all right now all
[1:52:35] right so he was a man but he was the
