she has a PS here may God give sister Emmy a very happy [Laughter] birthday see I don't have to announce it I have others do it for me amen well as we get ready to turn the service to our pastor let's sing number 538 I have decided to follow Jesus no turning back I have decided to follow Jesus I have decided to follow Jesus I have decided to follow Jesus no turning back no turning back the cross before me world behind me the cross before me the World Behind me the cross before me the World Behind Me no turning back no turning back oh take this whole world but give me Jesus oh take this whole

will follow no turning back no turning back the cross before me the World Behind me the cross before me the World Behind Me cross before me the World Behind Me no turning back no turning back amen we got no desire to turn back Hallelujah ain't that beautiful amen well you know so many things sometimes we kind of forget lose track and I I'm certainly one of the worst that there is about kind of forgetting the everyday things of life that maybe we should remember things like my wife's birthday and anniversary and stuff like that um kind of but uh I think it's just beautiful and the reason I say some of that is cuz I can't remember even the days they got married on and my wife didn't clue me in but I just want to say say to brother vasil and sister Tamara happy anniversary amen my a year can just disappear well I guess it was fast Amen brother Ivan sister Nadia God bless you amen what is this is this number five number five it doesn't seem like five years ago that we missed a flight and ended up in London and lost our suitcases here and ended up there and whatever but it's it's been a beautiful 5 years and yeah we thank the Lord for that and amen I had a lovely conversation today with sister aona she called me and um it was just beautiful I actually kind of had to just set my jaw so I wouldn't cry and and uh whatnot but she was just just thanking you church for your prayers for your support for your encouragement um she she did share and as you well know that uh this last year has been a very very difficult year for them and uh uh she she expressed that she believed that uh it was your prayers that carried her through this last year so uh certainly we want to remember them they're hoping uh that uh sister kche expressed that she hopes that uh her recovery is such that they can come see us after the first of the year and uh so uh we want the Lord just to come down may his presence be with him and and uh you know I just believe that when God guides the hand of the surgeon amen amen he's the one who made this body he knows every nerve every fiber everything and so we are going to also pray for the surgeon amen amen that that God would just give him Supernatural wisdom of what to do and to what extent and amen then come right down in a healing touch from the Lord amen so we just give our greetings tonight to brother pant sister a conin just um pray God's blessings upon them amen uh I know I brought a little confusion I said the other day I wouldn't be here tonight and um I I went to this skin doctor and you know they they I'm kind of prone to Little Skin things and and they fried me and I didn't want to stand up in front of you with all kinds of blisters sticking out and but I got in there and he said you know what not too bad and toasted me just a little bit and I thought well I I'm just going to go ahead and preach tonight amen now you know sometimes we always just pray God's leadership of what to do uh in things and um this coming Sunday I felt led to ask our brother Chris uh to take this Sunday service uh and um just to uh bring to you what the Lord's laid upon his heart may lay Before the Throne of God and find the perfect will of God now in the past if I'm correct this coming Thursday is Thanksgiving and um we normally do not have a Wednesday night service and uh so uh we will we will see you in service or I will see you in service the following Sunday so uh God bless you and uh this um Sunday following that uh um our brother David Nash may be coming through town um we've discussed this a little bit to see and possibly our brother David Nash will take that Sunday service so uh just be praying we always want the Lord's will we don't want to be the orchestrator right we want to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit and and uh many times Saints it's amazing that leadership how that it it takes us we turn a corner we don't know why we turn the corner uh but God has purpose in that and and uh so we just look forward to that so uh for as for me and my wife sister Jerry um uh we will uh be praying for you this coming Sunday as we take this little holiday so let's just stand and go into the word of God today uh this evening and uh thank you musicians always appreciate the Beautiful music uh amen now my tile might not totally reflect the direction that we're going but it made sense to me and um so uh Perfect Light brings forth A Perfect Image now the scripture tells us that we look through a glass Darkly but you see my brother and sister Sons and Daughters of God that glass will come one day and no longer be dark now I'm going to kind of give just a little Preamble of what might be a future sermon thought but you see my brother and sister the word says I am God and I change not so God didn't come down and change that glass that you're looking through you know that he didn't come and say I'm going to give entirely different view to you than I do to you but what he does is he comes down and the light illuminates so great that the glass is no longer a mystery or Avail to us so it's all about the light it's not about how God gave more of this and more of that and disadvantage this person he came to the whole world the scripture says he gave his only begotten son everyone has their opportunity but some refuse the light some desire the light and those that desire the light the word shows us clearly that he shines more light so you want more light cry out for more light you want more faith cry out for more faith amen so it's there that the it's illuminated and then the glass is it were slowly loses its Darkness until we see him as he is and when we see him as he is we see ourselves as we are amen because we are in him so you can't see more of God without seeing more of yourself in him amen it's a lovely lovely I'm going to use the word concept okay but please don't take that in its actual root uh because it's more than a concept cep but it's in that you see the more you see of him the more you see of yourself amen and so it's not self retrospect that we look and say I'm going to find out who I am so that I might find God that won't work you have to find God to see who you are amen amen well just uh this evening I pray God would just open the word to us amen we're going to go to 2 Corinthians the 4th chapter uh verses 1-10 um and just uh our very do our very best to be concise tonight 2 Corinthians 4th chapter starting with verse one therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received Mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord ourselves your servants for jesus' sake for God who hath commanded the light to shine out of Darkness hath shined in our hearts yes sir oh my isn't that beautiful see it's not just somewhere in the world is this gospel light shining it is shining in our hearts I love that amen hallelujah to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ let's read verse six again because I think it's deeper than we recognize for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge amen oh look my brother and sister the knowledge of who our God is is all encapsulated and this will be a whole different topic we won't go there tonight but it is encapsulated in the light that knowledge is encapsulated in the light can I interpret that for for you the scripture says that we can't even say Jesus is the Christ without the Holy Ghost but man can stand almost anywhere on the face of the Earth and say Jesus is the Christ Jesus is the Christ but without the Holy Ghost it becomes just words that's right without the true understanding or revelation of what that really is they are actually speaking words that's right but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side Can someone say Amen to that yet not distressed I say Amen to that we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body amen Heavenly Father we ask Lord you would just father just seal our lips to speak your word and your word alone tonight and father not just what is right and correct but Lord what is needful and necessary Lord speak to our hearts we pray tonight for everyone who is not here tonight Lord father I pray your Holy Spirit would just go out and deal kindly father Lord reminding and strengthening and healing Lord encouraging father we thank you for the opportunity to come to the house of God tonight and to serve you day by day we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Saints amen you know I I love verse 10 as we're looking at that that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body now my brother and sister when something is made manifest it is not kept in the concept or in a theoretical form but it actually becomes literal it actually becomes a reality so we can talk about the life of Jesus Christ we can talk about the effect of the Holy Spirit upon our life and if we see no reality from that CU we can talk about it in a conceptual form we can talk about it from the realm of knowledge where we would look at the scripture and be able to say yes this is something that is supposed to happen and yet we're not looking for something that is supposed to happen we are looking for what God promised and is happening amen and so as we see the word unfolding in us then we can stand firm upon the word of God and know that because God desired to manifest himself in our body that we can come now and and release ourself to trust God to perfect that now I was joking with brother Jason we'll get hopefully get to this in just a little bit here I was joking with him on a little thought tonight I made it sound like oh I'm looking forward to this but you see we are looking forward to the fact that God is manifesting himself in his bride amen now there is an image you know um uh uh I have a backpack and some stuff that uh I don't remember what what is that that says on that something about image and and you know Sharper Image amen and I I remember looking at that and when that backpack was brand new and sister Jerry and I have traveled the the uh Earth you might say with that backpack I've carried it through many an airport and whatever else and it's a sharp backpack or I should say was because you see it's traveled uh tens of thousands maybe even to the hundreds of thousands of miles and uh it's worn and it's torn and and the straps look like they're falling off of it I've even had people stop me in the airport and say sir your strap is breaking and I'm like it's fine but you see it no longer has a sharper image it looks kind of tattered it looks kind of rough and you see this image of of who we are in Jesus Christ is not an image that was once sharp and has become tattered but it is an image that God renews he says his mercies are new Every Morning amen so image of Jesus Christ in US is an image my brother and sister that is not going to fade away it is not going to be an image of what we used to be but it is what we are today and I thank God for that and you know an image my brother and sister as we were speaking uh last Wednesday on reflection a an image it takes an image to have a reflection and so I say today Lord let us see who we are in you that our image as it were that we could pray for and press into will be a perfect reflection of Jesus Christ now the word says here in verse four in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ which uh who is the image of God should shine unto them I want to ask you a question tonight now this would be a uh kind of in a little bit of an arbitrary question but I want to ask you tonight how do you know that you're not blinded how did you know that the God of this world has not blinded you it's not a trick question it's actually intended for us to let our minds be stirred of what is the evidence of Who We Are in Jesus Christ not that we just have words you see it's easy to speak words but for us to have confidence in who we are and what God is doing in us we should know what the evidence is that we are not blinded we don't want to be my brother and sister those people who blindly follow I remember this years ago and I I'm not going in a negative Direction so please don't don't uh think I am but I remember years ago that people uh that had come into the message when I was a young man they they were in the church and then you know the ministry there and we tend to get in ruts if we are not careful and the ministry there preached down a certain little vein and and that's kind of the direction they always preached on and this other Ministry come in and and they made statements and these people were like I don't believe that that isn't what we believe that guy just give us faults no no there it is that's as much of the message as anything else and these people were like I I'm I'm not going to deal with that and basically got up and left you see no one had ever brought them to a place to challenge them to look into the word far enough to know what it was they really belied and why they believed it so that is key element as much as it is that we believe God sent a prophet and Malachi 4 will be fulfilled and Revelations 22 will be fulfilled uh my brother and sister is to know that we have not been blinded amen now because that's not really the gist of my sermon tonight I I I won't go into this in depth but how do we know that we are not blinded you see it won't be by our confession only confession only my brother and sister will not hold us but it's necessary it's not by saying amen I've had people look me in the face and say you can't tell me that that I say Amen to every word of God and then argue with you what the word meant so saying amen is not the evidence that we haven't been blinded but every son or daughter of God the prophet of God said will say Amen to every word of God yeah amen so it's part of it amen but we have this very clear evidence that we can look at the life and this will lead in if God would be merciful to me to hurry through tonight this will lead in but you see it's the life my brother and sister you see the light and you press into it amen yes you don't just acknowledge there's light you see light you press into it and when we'll look at some of these quotes that we'll come across here in just a little bit you'll realize that in pressing into that you have opened yourself up or given as it were God complete permission to do what is necessary in your life yes you know what I'd rather see than someone that says Amen to every word of God can quote the message and do all these things I'd rather see people that would be so open and surrendered to God that they literally say Lord whatever you want to do to me here I am I believe your word so much and I trust you so much just do Lord as you would amen Jesus himself you want to know the foundation he said Lord not my will but thy will be done what was that a complete surrendering that what was necessary and God said what is necessary is that you go to the cross and you give your life do you think that man that we call Jesus Christ wanted to go and suffer no he did not but because he recognized the necessity of him suffering he recognized that this was needful to be done he surrendered himself to the will of God and my brother and sister the prophet of God clearly says in several places throughout the message that God will never lead you away away from his word that's right so when we come and we surrender ourself to the word then we are signing up for God to do what God deemed necessary but the problem is often times what God deemed necessary are flesh does not like that's exactly right amen you see to bring it down simply the life will produce a life amen amen it's not so much there's other quotes I could quote of Spurgeon and Tozer and and some of those others Through The Years Wiggles were uh wonderful quotes when you look at them my brother and sister but they're just laying the foundation of or or or talking of the very things of the foundation that's been laid for us and my brother and sister as we'll come to that we realize that you cannot I almost brought some seed to church tonight but I thought that's just so silly Paul but you know h a corn seed I put a corn seed right here and I can put a pinto bean seed right here my brother and sister I cannot plant the corn and hope to harvest the Pento Bean that's right amen or vice versa and I can't plant the Pento bean and expect to get a small white right you know what small whites are they're porking beans all of you that like pork and beans that's a small white bean is what they use in pork and beans just so you'll know but you can't plant that you see every seed brings forth of its own kind amen so what we're looking how do you know my brother and sister that you haven't been deceived because there is a life now sometimes that life is not something we stand up and be able to just glorify look at my life look at my life look at my life but you see there's a keeping power there's a holding power there's something that when you see the light you yearn to step into that light you learn yearn to to to walk as that light moves as it's moving forward you yearn to follow that what is that that's nothing short of God that's nothing short of the holy spirit because the uh God of this evil age has has many distractions and and I don't say this negatively but we fall for those distractions many times because see some of those distractions can be very base very simple not even in a sense my brother and sister evil but they're just simply a distraction and Satan will use that I want to draw this scripture here out of Psalms we used it last Wednesday and I feel like it's appropriate to put here once again as a reminder to us as in water face anth to face so the heart of man to man you'll see there is that that relationship that reflection as I used that example the other Wednesday I cannot look into the pool and get brother Trevor's reflection what is reflected from the pool is what I am and I think sometimes it's good brother brandom encourages us to look into the mirror of God's word come face to face don't Dodge it don't don't try to just push it off don't use the thing well that's not who I am if the nature is there of that my brother and sister then look at that reflection and say Lord deliver me from that or if you we take the positive sign if you look into that and realize that the very nature of that is who you you are becoming then get some hands up get some lips moving and say thank you Lord that I'm no longer the image of Paul Haled or your name in that place and then I I'm becoming an image of you and you say well brother Paul we have problems around our house well welcome to the club amen I'll tell you what that one thing that's been enlightening and I don't mean to like put brother George on the sideline and and focus to that but it's been interesting in my relationship as this friendship has grown through the years and I speaking with brother George and he's made statements before that uh the brandham household was just like any other right they didn't get up in the morning and they were Angels floating around any more than they are at your house that's well the scripture tells us that his angels are round about yeah certainly his people his bride amen I could preach a whole sermon I got some notes they're not here they're at home but I preach a whole sermon about what brother brandham says about God being with you in his spirit and how his angels are hovering and his Spirit hovering over the people oh my brother and sister we're not walking blindly through this world God's got his armed guards around us hallelujah so as we look at this we recognize now to to see this evidence of whether we're deceived or not is what kind of face is looking back at you in the reflection am if it is a face now I hope you follow me because we're not talking about a physical image and I think you follow me to that but the face that is looking back to you the prophet of God shows us this is scriptural but he breaks it down into the bite-sized pieces for us that a son or daughter of God is looking into the reflection and seeing Christ is quick to forgive amen and quick to ask for forgiveness will hold no ought or ill but will lift those who hurt them up before God and that list could go on but that's not our subject tonight these are the things that show us whether or not God is present in the reflection of this face because you see if we're easily offended and we're bitter and we angry that's not the reflection of Christ he loved us when we were unlovable man that's hard to do isn't it would anyone agree with me yeah it's hard to love when those that you are there and have to forgive seem unforgivable but the Holy Spirit has a way of molding and forging and changing and bringing about to manifest oh Hallelujah I don't care how much pain Saints I'm not you know I'm not callous you know I love you but I don't really care how much pain you endure in your life the question is not about the pain it's whether you're willing to change or not that's right you see we can go through heartache and trial and struggle and trouble and just get more and more and more bitter that's right or we go through that and the holy spirit moves in us and starts to mold us and bring us to this place that we find ourself looking as it were the reflection of the word and saying oh Lord help me forgive me Lord Lord Place love in my heart for that person or this situation or whatever it is you see and the reflection of who we are starts to change praise the lord well brother Paul that's so Elementary I know it's very Elementary but sometimes the simplest things are the hardest to implement Hallelujah now I just want to go here into this with kind of some lengthy quote stuff here and I hope you're okay with that tonight amen if you need to stand up and you know stretch a little bit whatever feel free therefore so many times we hear this expression oh what is a Christian some people limit it to joining a church Someone said well a Christian is a church member someone who takes up their affiliations with the church I believe that all Christians should do that amen should I read that again let me interpret it for you prophet of God is telling you you should have a church home amen we shouldn't just be so random that we go to church well not here or not there maybe over the Dell somewhere I believe all Christians should do that but I don't believe that's Christianity see that's what a Christian does after he becomes a Christian but it doesn't mean that because he does it that he is a Christian then some say no it's going to church and serving a declaration of reads and being loyal to those things in which the church teaches and then there are others that says perhaps packing a little a little something on them a little Cross or something that that is the sign of a Christian well and then there's others who believe that perhaps maybe if they would burn a candle you know Sister Jerry and I had the privilege a few years ago five years ago to be exact of going to brother Ivan and sister Nadia's wedding and then going on up into Europe and uh preaching and Belgium and whatnot and we we were taken a tour of uh oh I don't remember I might have the cities wrong but gent and um there was some other cities and they have these churches that considering they were built uh hundreds upon hundreds of years previous I don't know how they got them rocks you know 100t 50 ft in the air I don't know how they built those buildings in that fashion but obviously they did and do you know Saints you ought to if you ever get an opportunity to go there you should take a recorder or your phone or something with you cuz even I sounded good singing in there it's just incredible the the the sound that is there but you know we witnessed something that struck me very deeply uh obviously this young woman was very distra and uh she comes in rushing into this building uh she's fumbling through her little purse and she finds some change and she drops it in a box and takes a candle goes over and lights it puts it down in front of a statue and gets down and starts just crying out in another language uh uh uh just in travail and I thought my if we could have the right recipe and that kind of desperation what would we do you know brother brandom talked about how that they would rub these statues so much they had to replace the hands and the feet we have witnessed that firsthand we've walked through there and looked at these statues that the hand is not even the same color it's not the same kind of rock the feet are not the same kind of rock and they're already worn smooth of people rubbing on that my brother and sister you see they don't do that out of callousness they do that in absolute sincerity perhaps maybe if you'd burn a candle or do something of a pen Penance that's a Christian if they will merely be immersed in water or they would do some sacrifice or give some good to the church or help the neighbor buy some coal for the widow or some shoes for the orphan that the axe that's the axe that a Christian should do but that still doesn't make them a Christian and then some says that if you pack an image of Christ in your car on your wall that that is a sign of a Christian well them things are all right but I don't believe that packing an image makes you a Christian I believe that being an image of Christ makes you a Christian it's not what we do outwardly it's what happened inwardly that makes us what we are amen hallelujah I tell you my brother and sister that right there which should strike right to the very home or it's not it's not what is happened external right but it's what's happened down on the inside then therefore if he is our image and we are in his likeness and members of his body we should be images like him then our lives should reflect the image of Christ not in our joining church or in our packing crucifix or our emotions but it should be in the living presence of the Living God that's reflected through your life right right I changed that didn't I yes amen because you understand the pearl of your would be our in this context that is us personally identifying not the crowd effect that's right you know there's such a thing as the crowd effect amen abolutely where people say amen because 10 20 30 or 40 said amen but they don't really know what they said amen to right the prophet of God got in a car one time with Billy Paul you'll find this in the message search for it and he asked him Billy did you understand what I said tonight and Billy said uh uh well yes I I think so dad brother brandham corrects him and says there wasn't two or three in the whole building understood what I said brother Billy Paul's own testimony was people were shouting dancing in the aisles shouting Hallelujah didn't understand what was being preached the crowd effect Church don't let us be a crowd effect but it should be a living presence of the Living God that's reflected through our life that's us taking personal possession of this it's been told me by authorities that before they had in the days of smelter to take the dross out of the gold take the iron and the pyite the pyite is so close like real gold till it's called Fool's Gold but the way they got all of all that out this where I was joking with brother Jason that they beat it out with a hammer Indians used to do that and the old goldsmiths used to do that beat it with a hammer and turn it over and over and over and they beat it until the dross was out of it and the only way that they knew that it was down to the gold was when the beater could see his reflection in it you see this would not be my brother and sister to take this into the spiritual realm this would not be a superficial be good people this is people that literally have been hammered that's right now we get a little farther right here the one who was beating could constantly look until he could almost shave by his own reflection in the gold that he was beating and when the holy spirit of God begins to beat on us with the gospel Hammer prise the Lord oh I wish our pastor wouldn't preach so direct look what the prophet's saying here it's the gospel Hammer yes now if you got a pastor that just loves to beat the Sheep my brother and sister there's something wrong but when we can discern by the holy ghost that it is the word of God beating the dross out of us don't resist and say I like my iron pyite and I like my little chunks of granite and I like my little whatever let the gospel hammer do its work amen until all the things of the world is beaten out and we can reflect the image of the Lord God then I believe we become Christians amen now I'm going to I'm going to discern what the prophet said here as a legalist would discern it you see I grew up in a church that had plenty of legalism until you've been beaten and the reflection of Christ can show in you you're not even a Christian so I just want you to know tonight not a single one of you is a Christian is that what God meant is that what the prophet meant no sir this is a work that God is coming and we'll have a little something now I know none of you ever have a stubborn Spirit on you but those Believers that have a stubborn Spirit God will allow things to come in their life and God will then use the word of God and the circumstance oh don't don't think God don't just use circumstance and you will come and you will feel as though you're being beaten and it's like how I you know I just went through this a few years ago yeah because you didn't pass the test then you went back to school now he's beating on you again what is he doing he's knocking all the dross out of us is it God not liking us is it not loving us no actually it's those he loves he chases see how the world we live in today has come down and so watered down the gospel so I'm sorry to use this word it's probably not a nice word but so sissified being a Christian that they won't preach it the prophet of God speaks of it they won't preach it because they're afraid to offend someone that's right Spurgeon says if you preached and didn't offend someone then you failed wow you see the gospel Hammer until the things of the world's beaten out and we can reflect the image of the Lord God then I believe we become Christians for the word Christian means Christlike and to reflect him now that doesn't mean that we have to grow a long beard as the artist picturers uh have him uh neither does it mean that we grow long hair as the artist pictures him having or to wear a robe as he wore for we're living in another day we don't necessarily have to be that to reflect his physical image amen right praise the Lord but look what brother brandham closed this out and as I say before I say again go back study these things read much further we don't have time in an evening or a Sunday to to just bring this whole thing out but we must right so he's given directive here but we must in our souls reflect his Spirit image and his man of life I do not believe that Christians consist of joining churches or Creeds I believe it's a reflection of Jesus Christ in a human being for we are his members the members of his body and we bear His Image scripture says amen isn't that beautiful I I I just love that amen as we look at that and just realize how that God uh is just he's just molding us Saints he's just bringing us down and and you know I had a grandfather a step-grandfather that was a rockhound and and quite successful at finding beautiful pieces of rock and and polishing and doing whatnot and selling it for money made a living doing that and uh I can remember uh my grandfather uh going out and knowing certain spots out in in the mountains and and he would pick up a very ugly Rock and um I would ask him hey Grandpa why are you packing that rock around and he says son he says you are looking at the outside I know what's on the inside and he would take that rock home and I would go and visit him maybe a week or two later and he would say Paul come out into my shop and he go out there and he would have cut that rock in two and um my brother and sister they was I forget what they even call those but on the inside of it what yes that and and it would be so beautiful and the formation of the crystals and then he would take them to a rock show a gun show whatever kind of show and he would sell those literally for hundreds of dollars a piece because they were a treasure but you see we in the flesh are looking on the outside God has already looked on the inside and says there's where the value is the value is not on the outside the value is on the inside and and I can remember my grandfather uh uh just uh doing that I remember one time uh there was this rock it was kind of flaky and you could kind of pick it apart if you tried real hard and and he says uh Paul don't don't do that I was sitting on his tailgate hitting it with the rockhammer and he says don't do that and I said why not Grandpa there's something inside here and he says that that's right but it's protected inside there right now let's reveal it in a different atmosphere a different place you know what was inside there a sapphire he recognized the rock formation that was present when sapphires were formed and inside of his Workshop he broke that rock open and I I don't know what he sold it for he never would confess I think he thought maybe as his grandson I was right there when he picked it up maybe I wanted my share but it was a sapphire that was so huge and so beautiful it was red uh kind of a red Radiance kind of semic clear but a red Radiance and it was huge and I asked my grandfather months later what'd you do with it and he goes oh you know we got to pay the light bills around here how much did you get for it Grandpa you know son that's just basically none of your business but you know the beautiful thing there's not a one of us with a treasure inside that doesn't know what the price was paid for the next one amen isn't that beautiful God don't keep a secret he doesn't say you're worth more than this one he paid a price and we know what that price was Hallelujah isn't that beautiful amen how God brings these things about such a way oh my now we'll look right here let me just catch myself here as we've kind of jumped around just a little bit now 1 Corinthians 15 but some men will say how are the dead raised up and with what body Do They Come Thou fool that which thou sest is not quickened except it die so we see the principle of the seed requires that the seed must go in the ground and die we have planted wheat in ground that was so dry and it never hardly rained or did anything in this Valley in the wintertime and you could go out in the month of Fe ending of February the beginning of March and the ground was dry enough to make dust and all the seed you had planted that fall before was just laying there it had not done one thing because it took moisture to die took the presence of the Holy Ghost to die you see an old dry-eyed confession in church won't do it amen and that which thou sest thou sest not that that body that it shall be but be grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body amen All Flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of Flesh of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes and another of birds there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another there is one glory of the Sun and another glory of the Moon another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory so also is a resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is swn in dishonor and is raised in glory it is sown in weakness and it is raised in power you know I have encountered in my short life uh my brother and sister people who their hearts desire I want to be in fluential in the church I want to be a a a uh a pillar in the church but ultimately my brother and sister they never achieve that status because they thought they would do that by knowing the message better than you they thought they would do that by being more authoritarian they thought they would do that by getting in a position of influence say with the ministry they thought they could do that but my brother and sister the word of God shows us that that seed's got to go in the ground and when it goes in the ground God's got a purpose and when that seed comes forth it will be exactly what God wanted it to be I tell you my brother and sister I think it is good to have a heart's desire to be influential in the church I believe it is a lovely desire to be influential and so to be influential who wants to be influential come on I think every hand ought to be being raised I want to be influential become a prayer Warrior right become a prayer Warrior instead of trying to figure out what's wrong with everybody lift them up to the throne of almighty God and say Lord pound on them oh that don't sound very nice does it I I'm praying for you brother I'm praying for your sister that God would just pound on you now said in the right spirit in the right way totally correct what are you saying well find better words but what you're saying is is I I want you to be at the image of Jesus Christ now if you literally are like yes I want the Lord just to pound on you cuz I don't like you no no Saints look swn in dishonor it's raised in glory sewn in weakness it's raised in power amen it is sewn a natural body is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living soul and the last Adam was made a quickening spirit how be it that was not the first which was is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual Hallelujah so we see these principles that are laid in the scripture now the word of God shows us that every seed will bring forth of its own kind and we look at that my brother and sister and uh uh recognize that these are the things that um are strengthening the body of believer is they see God moving it's not we come to church and talk about what has been or what will be but we should be under the correct anointing of the word and the correct approach of the word should be able to come into the house of God and talk about what God is doing today amen not something past tense not something future tense is that not what the prophet of God said people made that mistake they looked for what God has done and what he will do and they miss what God is doing right now amen the first man of the earth earthy second man is from the Lord From Heaven as is the Earthly such are they also that are earthy and as is the Heavenly such are they also that are Heavenly and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall oh Hallelujah I like verse 49 yes amen as we have borne the image of the earthy we're here sitting here tonight we're bearing that imageen Hallelujah we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly this my brother and sister is a revelation to a real Christian I will not be just struggling day by day by day I will not just have to press I will not have to kill this flesh I will bear the image what is it a positive confession I will bear the image of the Heavenly now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the king om of God neither does corruption inherit incorruption oh what a wonderful Foundation that is laid in place you know what I want to just bring this out and tie this back to the quote we were just reading you see my brother and sister we were born Earthly if we will not surrender and have the dross beaten from us we can never come to the Incorruptible it requires a beating that's what I was joking I'm sorry just my terrible sense of humor I was joking with brother Jason oh wow look at this we get a beat we we just get to come out and beat these people but you see if that was the spirit of the flesh then they couldn't resist that nature to beat the sheep have you guys ever sat in a service where they beat the Sheep I've heard the Sheep out there the the preacher thought they were saying amen but the Sheep were just oh my anyway we won't go there you see my brother and sister there's one thing for God to beat the draw out of the sheep that's right and quite different to beat the Sheep amen to present an idea that you are not a Christian right now you can't be the bride you can't have the Holy Ghost with without some other action or works or something that's beating sheep we hold the hope of this gospel we hold the the the The Treasure of this gospel that is attainable to each and everyone whose heart is crying out for the word who whose life is longing to be in the image of Christ the door is open to us amen but we must have that desire My somebody has stolen the time again spoken words The Original Seed and last quotation we had was that God made every seed after its kind that it that's his see then when he made his Man In His Image who was that Jesus Christ was a seed of his word when Jesus was made flesh he was the Flesh of the word of God Amen I want I want you to think about that Saints all that was poured into Christ was poured into the church now he goes on to say this but I want to drive this home right here you and I are the Flesh of the word amen look what he says here he was a flesh of the word of God and when we receive the word of God then we becomes God's then we become God's word in our flesh see the church should be in that condition Hallelujah we are the Flesh of the word this is the manifestation that it's no longer wo we are unworthy wo we are nothing wo I'm a failure you are the very flesh God chose to put his word in amen I say the word says and I stand on it firmly that God does all things well amen hallelujah he doesn't make a mistake amen so when we look at this and part of this is the prophet saying just a remind the prophet saying when she talking about the bride recognizes who she is she will become an invincible Army when we recognize that we are the Flesh of the word of leoda that it is the season the time the place that God chose to reveal this and bring it out now I it'll change our whole outlook towards the word of God we will no longer look at ourselves as woe unto me I'm a sinner I'm no good I I don't know why God would choose me we might still have to deal with those kind of issues or questions but my brother and sister when you come to the day that you can by Revelation say you know what God chose me if there be a bride that is represented in the Book of Revelation I am her amen if there be a word that would be made manifest in the whole new testament of God's people I am them amen if there be a word that would come as it would be to to come and give a light in the darkness I am that light amen it is not boasting Upon Our eles it is not lifting ourselves up into a heady or high-minded place it is simply looking at the word and recognizing the word said that God would be manifested in flesh once again in our day and we recognize that and say Lord let that be me and I believe I am amen so you can come you can claim that or you can sit back as a skeptic and say we're looking for some other manifestation we're looking for some other sign but my brother and sister the word also shows us that they said said the sign was here and you missed it amen come on the sign is here absolutely the very sign the prophet of God was talking about God in this generation that sign is here don't miss it don't miss it some are waiting for it some are talking about when it will happen what they will do when it happen but it's happening that's right amen amen I remember a brother stood right here in this Pulpit right here and made a statement that he was the Rapture and people are like that's false just go study your messag amen and if that's false the prophet of God then was false prophet cuz he lays the foundation that we are the message we are the rapture we are the resurrection you see but somebody's looking for a future event waiting for something to happen someday to make that real but it's made real right in their midst but it didn't fit just like the Sadducees and Pharisees it didn't fit the dialogue that they believed it would happen in amen now this is a little bit history a little bit of of uh different stuff that has come out of studies of writings in the Middle East but I'll just present this I don't present it as a Doctrine I don't presented but it's just something that some people have represented and I'll just lay it out to you the reason that the devil took Jesus to the Pinnacle of the temple is because there was a faction or a sect amongst the Sadducees or Pharisees that had taught that when the Messiah would come that he would come floating down from heaven into their very midst and be above them and they would recognize the Messiah for the supernatural of his coming I don't know if that's true or not but I'll tell you what it is to make the point we'll get something so drilled in our head yeah that when he come as a baby in a Manger the son of some kind of messed up relationship didn't fit their Angelic Messiah floating down and them all seeing him okay so whether that history is correct or not please understand but the point I think is very clear so fixed that the the only way that God is going to come down in his little bride is this way or this way or this way but here's a bride that the word has come down is changing her her eyes have been open what was the glass Darkly is slowly dissolving away and revealing more of Jesus Christ and bringing it to the place that you and I one day look at this and recognize the prophet's words as he said it and we can say Amen to it cuz the prophet said amen to it but how about we come to the place we say Amen to it because it's Revelation to us and when he says you are flesh of his flesh and you are bone of his bone that we look at that and say that's right I am him and he is me amen it's not just a concept the prophet said it so I guess I say Amen to that but Revelation that comes into your heart and soul and realize I was in him in the beginning and I will be in him in the ending amen that's right amen and he says I cannot lose a one the work that I have begun I will finish the scriptures go on and on with the confirmation that my brother and sister the reason we know that the God of this world has not deceived us is because the word being made fresh is drawing you and I right into his presence it's not a religious spirit it's not going to church it's not identified I believe the message but the relationship of Jesus Christ coming so strong oh Hallelujah that it just grips your life it controls your life Hallelujah you see it comes along and he says and when we receive the word of God then we becomes God's word in our flesh oh yes yes that's I I understand I read my Bible and I no that's not God's word coming in your flesh God's word coming in your flesh have any of you ever had a physical therapy and they put the little electrodes on you and then they set the little timer the frequency and the duration and you look over and that nice little blond-haired blue-eyed physical therapist suddenly has teeth and horns and seems like the most cruel person on Earth CU they're like yes your evaluations show that your muscle stimulation is not sufficient can you turn this down no you know what the holy ghost's doing come on Saints are you with me tonight if we don't have sufficient spiritual stimulation God's not going to say well you know they tried I'll just go ahead and scratch their name out of the book because it just doesn't seem like no you know what God's going to do he's going to come he's going to give you sufficient stimulation amen he's going to take that spiritual Hammer oh come on yes sir come on I hope you understand this he's going to take that spiritual hammer and he's going to start hitting you in all the right places amen oh Hallelujah if I could just share this a tad bit of humor but it reminds me back in the days of physical therapy the young lady was like your your leg is atrophied so much uh and uh whatnot I I'm really concerned about your reflexes and your ability to regain your muscle mass and everything and um and uh so one day she got her boss to come and he's poking and he's prodding and then he pulled out and I recognized a little thing I've had my reflexes done before taking a CDL test right brother vasile you know they whack you in the knees and elbows and whatnot and I'm sitting there and the guy whacked me and my leg didn't move and he whacked me again and my leg didn't move and he he just looks up at me he goes this might be a problem then he hit me so hard my foot went and I was like that hurt and he said it was meant to I had to see if you could respond God will do that Saints don't sit back and just well I'm just going to laxidasical kind of be the bride of Christ God's going to hit you with something that causes you to respond to his word hallelujah cuz he said I never lost a single one okay sister Emmy comes so I'll stop hallelujah amen well just a moment we'll hurry through this then now that then from this and bringing this into seven Church ages God is building in seven Church ages a bride for Christ sounds like a building project right he's building in seven Church ages a bride for Christ through Philadelphian thyon pergamus saman Ephesus a church Aid that Jesus said if the bridegroom come in the first watch or the seventh watch all these virgins awakened see the truth of it is if God had chose to come in any one of the previous Church ages every one of those Brides that virgin bride would have risen aren't you thankful God coming the seventh amen give us our time they were they awoke The Virgins of Ephesus sna pergamus thyra Sardis Philadelphia leoda did you notice that it was the seventh age that when he came and woke up these sleeping virgins that brings them all the way back down to here see meaning back through the whole age back to this point for in this through the years ages he has built a bride born a bride am begotten amen a bride on Earth for Christ and the same way that he begets this bride he has begot individuals you know we can cut this down through a lot of explanation and bring it right down how did he how did he beget this bride the word amen how did he beget the individual the word amen you see it was never the organization the shock the prophet of God says harbored the seed until the harvest season that's right but the shock could never be the seed he says the shuck never looked like the seed the shuck goes into the ground but it's already dead you see the shuck can't come back to life I've plowed down in my lifetime would be literally like Millions of shocks and they never once produced a seed no life hallelujah amen amen then someone says that if you pack an image of Christ in your car on your wall that's a [Music] sign of a Christian [Music] I had a brother once made a comment to him and I said oh brother this and this happened and I said it really Disturbed me and he said brother Paul he says I don't mean to one up you but he said just recently I had a man call me asked me to come to his home he' been sick wanted me to pray for him he said and I walked a large photo of the [Music] prophet he said I don't judge the man for having a television but he said when the man told me he said every night I sit here in this church and I pray I open how do we get from the point my brother and sister that we have moved our Focus From The Prophet as a prophet to putting a prophet up to worship Him part 2A or 2 b or c or the continuation of this right here brother brandham in this ties this right back together and reminds us as we all know the problem that Shadrach Meshach and Abednego had it's not worshiping God but was worshiping the image that's right and they lifted the image up as though it were God my brother and sister let's make sure that the image that we worship the image that we reflect the image we look to is Jesus Christ don't let Satan come in and blur that line Amen brother brand goes on to say that God honored Shadrach Meshach and abedo his their position I'm paraphrasing this it's not the exact words he honored that so much that he went in the fire and stood with [Music] them now whatever your fiery trial is don't let someone else put another image in front of you the image of our Lord Jesus Christ that's the image that's right that the prophet brought and pointed to and encouraged us this is what we're going to this is what we look to this is what we worship don't let any other image I encourage you Church don't let any other image I don't care how nice the man is that brings that image to you if it's anything less than perfect to the word of God don't allow yourself to be drawn to that cuz remember remember there was a lot of Hebrew children only three of them right had courage enough to stand up and say I won't worship my Prophet that's right I won't worship that that's right he's my Prophet Daniel was a prophet to the day he he was there he was that representation the supernatural but you see then our lives should re reflect the image of Christ not in our joining church or in our packing crucifix or our emotions but it should be the living presence of a living God that's reflected through our life amen hallelujah Saints say brother Paul you sure beat on that a lot you know why I do Saints it's a really strong spirit it's a really really really strong spirit and I'm not here to beat on it it's not my job but my job is to stir up your pure mind in remembrance that Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ Alone is who we worship Hallelujah you love the Lord tonight amen well praise the Lord let's just stand sing that song Who I Am Lord who I am isn't it so good to see who we are Saints I I'm so happy I just think about the things that God's God is is uh doing what we see who who we are you know a few years ago sister Jerry and I uh we we spoke I spoke at a youth uh convention in Paraguay and the brothers it was so hot they said it had never been that hot there before that they remembered I remember what it was I don't want to exaggerate it's like 117 or 18 or something Celsius which was like no not 10 something it was 117 it was 117 what was it like 47 or 8 or something like that Celsius let me get my thoughts correct 118 it's like trees are bursting into flames no it was like 47 or 48 Celsius like 117 or 18° and and it just so hot and so the brothers cancel some Services which I honestly would have just loved I know the Lord would strengthen us that's what we went there for but they after preaching quite a few Services they just said we're we're going to take you on a little road trip and uh we ended up in a city and there was a a Observatory there and the lady that was um that was there as the guide I guess you'd say in the observatory um it was so interesting cuz they literally had you lay down on these cushions and then all of this displayed and played out above you and around you and this woman who I don't want to sound judgmental but she didn't really look like a Christian wait that was really judgmental Paul really judgmental cuz I think Christians usually wear more clothes um but she gave reference and she started talking about these things and tying them to the Bible tying them to scripture and it was it was just fascinating to see all of that and I thought imagine I don't know brother Brown may have been been in a Observatory at some time maybe God just revealed it to him I don't know I I couldn't say the lady made a comment about it is believed that this may have well been God's first Bible Hallelujah I thought there it is the prophet of God's laid it out to us amen he told us God's revealed in that God's revealed in that well do you know I wanted to help this lady but I didn't want to be out of order that um I wanted to when they turned the lights on brother Trevor I wanted to walk up to her and tell her I'm God's Bible also but see it's hard for people you see Saints look I I don't mean to just drag your time away but I want to drive this home to you it's hard for people to move out of that element of I am nothing when as the bride of Christ they should recognize we are God In the Flesh in Leia I am his word revealed I am his life revealed oh no no no you can't you can't you can't be that no no no no no no no yes yes yes yes yes I can be cuz that's what the word says hallelujah oh my oh glorious victory that day he set me free yes and he made my heart what is it a throne his very Throne my life is no longer mine I'm a prisoner of love divine and now I live oh yes I live to praise His name oh Who I Am Lord who I [Music] am I can see now oh who I am a part of my saor part of his word it's revelation of who I am on calary he died to redeem his lost bride the King of Kings became my savior this is God's great mystery of Love Express to me that Christ and I might be made one oh Who I Am Lord who I am I can see now can you say Amen to that who I am a part of my savior a part of his word it's revelation of who I am oh Who I Am Lord who I am oh I can see now who I am a part of my savior a part of his word it's reel his predestination of who I [Music] am amen how do you like that Revelation I'll tell you what it's a life changing it's a revelation that takes us from just walking through this life to truly living it Hallelujah well let's just sing that as we close tonight the name of the Lord is my strong tower hallelujah it's not just a strong tower it's my strong tower Hallelujah the name of the Lord is a strong tower or right just run into and they are saved the name of the Lord is a strong tower rightous [Applause] running and they are Sav blessed be the name of

with a frown amen I wanted the world to know God's doing something you know it's too late on a Wednesday night here but I could share just a couple things that happened to you uh to me I mean in the last little bit here and you know Saints they just seem like small things but I tell you what happens when God comes down and deals with people who don't talk about God and they want to talk about God you have to know I don't really like the phrase they use out here in the world when they say that's a God thing I I don't like that phrase but you know it's God when the people who don't talk about God want to talk about God something's stirring amen just pray for God's leadership amen be like our brother Nash never gets on a plane but what he says Lord there's somebody on this plane I need to talk to hallelujah amen let's take that attitude God bless you Saints [Music] than h [Music] than [Music] go [Music] than [Music]
