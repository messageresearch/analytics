in you is your authority amen that's the power that's right hallelujah that is the power good to be in the house of the lord amaze happy amen good good thank the lord amen it's good to be here amen i i just wanted to remember before we get started here that i don't know how many know that brother joel dalton i guess is near passing passing away and then also brother bob king hopefully nobody knows bob king he's passed on and uh and so we just want to remember these i know that sister kristen's grandmother passed on about what about a week and a half two weeks ago so she's passed on in her sleep and so we want to remember sister christian the family and so there's a lot of them going on but we're still here we're pressing on amen in the name of the lord let's stand together before we go to the word here i just want to read just a small quote my title is here in his love again part three but it's part three continued and uh i'll finish that tonight and then i have a very direct seem like it just keeps getting greater and greater on my my heart a very direct thing in the next two parts or the next four parts however it comes out so so i might have to take part part four and and make it part five with it and then make the next part six and seven with it so if we had none seven that's a good number and five is a good number amen amen however the lord wants it in the message uh he preached in jeffersonville i'm just going to just read a small portion of this but um in the message trying to do god of service not his will prophet says and today anybody know what today is okay and today and i mean right now present tense this day right now in our midst right now tonight all right he is standing among us he is standing among us in the person of the holy ghost that's eternal life person of eternal life manifesting himself more and more coming into his church let me say this because it's not taking away or adding to it coming into his bride making himself known amen well i'd subject here along with this tonight is the bride coming of christ the living word in our midst let's have a word of prayer our heavenly father we want to thank you for the truth for you said we would know not happen to be uh just a happen chance or a hope so or but it would be a no-so that we would know the truth and the truth would make us free and lord we're so thankful to be made free set free and lord to know that you're in our midst and i pray that that would become more dominant more dominant more dominant to our hearts as you reveal yourself to us may we have a fresh revelation as your prophet said in our midst and become one and become that manifested word for the season help us lord to each one realize that we pray for revelation we must ask for the very thing that god said he promised he'd give us but he he desired that we ask for it and now father i pray that you would bless the word go as far as you see fit tonight and i just pray that you would take control over us each one individually and father may it be for your glory and honor all that is spoken and said may it be from your thoughts not mine lord take my thoughts out of the way and bring your thoughts forth i pray for as in jesus christ's name we ask this and with thanksgiving we ask it knowing if we ask in that name it is your spirit asking through us we give you praise for it now and for your glory amen first john i'd like to begin starting with four fourth chapter fourth verse and we'll jump down to the 13th you are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you amen let me say greater is he that is in you because you are of god greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world verse 13 hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit amen he's given us of his spirit and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world therefore having his spirit we do we have seen and do testify we have a testimony and do testify that the that god sent his that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world why i've saved he's in me i can testify he's a savior amen all right then and we have known oh let's back up here whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he and god and we'll touch that in a minute what brother brown said that about a mental concept of that and we have known and believed the love we have known we have known hallelujah and believe the love that god hath that god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god or we could say he that dwelleth in god dwelleth in love amen herein is our love made perfect complete mature in here in what here in him here in god in us herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment and that's our day because as he is hallelujah as he is and here in his love again as he is so are we in this world amen amen now just read verse 18 with it there's no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us you may be seated i'd like you to turn with me to matthew 24. and begin reading we'll read the 35th verse very familiar scripture but it's not how familiar the scripture is but is it revealed to us right and then he reveals it again and then he reveals it again we're glad we're familiar we can quote a lot of things by heart but that doesn't mean necessarily it's revealed to us amen amen but when it's quickened to us it's yours you're a part of that that's part of you amen amen so brother braham said whatever god can reveal is yours whatever reveals to you that's yours he said amen all right heaven and earth shall pass away so you might as well try to quit fighting trying to hold the earth in this place but realize that excuse me 35th 24 35 matthew 24 35 i'm sorry heaven or earth shall pass away but my words you notice that's in plural yeah but my words of course that's more than one word that's his words but it's also a great deeper meaning than that because his word is a thought expressed his words has to be his thought first to be expressed we'll come to that in just a moment but my word shall not pass away brother branham said this about that scripture and if you be that word you cannot pass away either amen so so it goes deeper than than on the letter the letter has to become alive has to come from letter to flesh amen because when it becomes that way you are always a part of it and god's obligated to his word amen you say well god's not obligated me he is to the word he will not leave you he's got to take you amen because you're a part of him he's not complete without you amen love's not complete without you amen are you hearing me god is not complete love is not complete without you amen so where is the complete revelation of love laying amen in the house in his house what's his house his body where he placed his name where he's worshipped you can't worship him in any other body any other church but his church you can't worship anywhere else amen you have to be in him to worship him to give him proper worship and true worshipper is the word quickened or the dynamics upon the word mechanics and bringing the two together as a true worshiper amen because that brings and produces jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen now i want you to go with one more scripture for me just for we got a few more but philippians 2 philippians 2 verse chapter 2 verse 13. very familiar scripture again but i want to read verse 12 with it wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling amen we could we could spend time on that but if you want to make a reference to work out you can go to john 6 27 and 29 29 said to do that what must we do to do your works believe on him who god has sent so if we're going to work out then we got to believe on him whom god has sent amen believe the word promise for the hour the message of the hour amen the word for the hour then then work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is not will be or has been but it is god which worketh in you for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do you so you see david's out of the question not david's ideas not david's thoughts not david's thinking about it it's his will of himself living in me work speaking and doing his will through me so he's in control or he isn't amen is that right then so therefore for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure amen amen all right now going back to this heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall not pass away here's what the prophet said in the beginning was god he wasn't even god then no god is an object of worship only thing was only thing he was was the eternal and in him were attributes and those attributes were thoughts all right and those thoughts was expressed to words amen now the prophet said and we know that you were existing in his thoughts you had to be in his thinking of himself the prophet you were in the thinking of himself and therefore that makes you eternal right amen so yeah if you if you think i'm too bold in this but i am eternal life because i've raised from the dead already i raised with him when he raised amen oh i'm still in this body this will be changed but i'm passed from death to life how do i know that because of his spirit that is in me keeping the word i'm identified by that spirit keeping that word believing that word and seeing the word and performing the word through me it's the same thing through you amen all right so you was in he said those thoughts were expressed the word and the word was made manifest amen now he said what is it it's all god becoming tangible amen he said you are a part of god amen i have these other quotes here but i but i could well just a moment i'll just just tell you right here he said you christians as i said before but here's where you christians were his thoughts all right okay you were in christ amen and if you are eternal the only way you could have eternal life because you always was amen hallelujah go tell that to some of the seminaries tell him i always was so what are you talking about he said how can you be always was when we know you're a man jesus said i don't judge as a man i don't judge the outward i i you you judge me as a man i judge no person by the flesh he said you judged by the flesh i'm not judging by the flesh amen someday i'm going to preach on emotionalism versus emotion there's a difference amen you can't base your salvation upon any emotion because if you do it's emotionalism i'll just drop that in amen we don't want the denominational emotionalism we want the pure word to have its way we are made to have emotion but you can't base your salvation and your eternal security and the and being filled with the holy ghost upon any emotion hallelujah amen even the new birth brother branham said the revelation of the new birth without sensation hello did you know that amen so see it's it's not based and there's emotion with it i'm not saying you get filled the holy ghost would be some emotion around you but that's not the evidence it's the revelation of his word in you it's a knowing not a not an emotion brother abraham said when you're seeking the holy ghost look for something that is that he said that is true amen a knowing he said look for that knowing all right now i'm off my subject but let's come back here it was god's thoughts he becoming tangible you are a part of god jesus came to redeem those that was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world i like what brother said i am that book exactly who we are that's exactly who we are because that's our revelation of christ the mystery of himself was sealed in that book it was hidden until this day what for so we could go home in a rapture so he kept it away from satan see he'd done great damage with he got a hold of that but he can't get a hold of it now amen because he has no right he can't get into it see he can try to pervert it but it's too late amen all right now and he said but he redeemed those that were put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world it was in god's thoughts it was in god's thoughts and that's what he come to redeem what did he come to redeem god's thoughts you the thought of god amen all right he come to redeem them as soon as that strikes them amen what's it striking is striking that thought is striking that thought that's made word is striking the seed yes amen all right so it strikes them soon as it strikes them they see it he said because the life the life is in there amen all right all right now so his words can never pass away now let's go over here to saint john 14 20 a moment very familiar scripture again but we're speaking of herein we're speaking of bride coming of christ the word the living word is in our midst the living word is in our midst the living word has been made flesh today is in flesh today amen i'm not saying these would be cliche it has to be a revelation you can speak it but you can't explain it to somebody there's no way i can explain that but it's it's either revelation reality or it isn't i thought you're on the road sergey here you are sitting here god bless you good to see you brother amen now he must have stepped out and come back travels like a thought you know all right now where was i sorry all right 14 chapter 14 of john verse 20 at that day this is the day when the seals the sealed men tore off amen and and the and what hasn't been written in the word that john was forbidden to write has now made revealed to you personally that's why it's still in mystery because it's not to everybody it's to you that's the seventh seal all right now he said he said at that day you shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you now we don't see there are two or three gods we only see one god god above us god with us god in us it's right there in that scripture it testifies of who you are when you see that by revelation there's nothing can take that from you i don't care how many times you fall or fail that cannot be removed amen a true revelation is always and let just make this statement a true revelation is always vindicated by the word you get a true revelation of the word it's got to tie in with the rest of the word and it won't leave what the prophet said all right okay now so you can have prophecies and all those things and that's fine to be true balaam had a true prophecy but he was a false prophet why because the word wasn't in him to recognize the season or the time so he worked contrary the word and yet and yet and yet said things and prophesied things that came to pass because he was anointed in his spirit but in his soul he was false amen that's exactly where it lays today amen the bible said try the spirits amen see if they be of god or not for every true spirit every true holy spirit if he dwells in you will bear witness with your spirit how will that holy ghost who is the word bear witness to anything but the word see you can't you can't make it lie if he's in you the words in you it's the holy spirit it's the word in spirit form amen so it's got to be in the soul amen so the words got to be laying there and you can't make it you didn't make it happen you had nothing to do with it you didn't have anything to do with coming in this world you have a choice of parents you have a choice of where you'd be born you had none of that but god had the choice and he predestinated us that's right amen that's right amen all right so it takes all the work and strain out of it and that's what god wants us to do to recognize ourselves as weaklings and by recognizing that we can surrender to one the strong amen and that's our lord amen amen that's why god wants us to depend upon him not to be independent but dependent upon him all right to about too many times we fear because reasoning comes in well if i'm dependent upon him how will this be in this being butted butt and butt butt button but there's no buts about it just do what god tells you to do don't have fear something's going to happen just do what he says do amen all right now so we are his thoughts that were redeemed all right everybody get that okay now there's some things here i want to share with you he said now brother branham is speaking here he says now maybe you you mean you mean with all the intelligence you know to speak it you believe it now he says you can he says with all the intelligence you have you can you can speak the word you believe it that's in your head but remember there's a subconscious down there that's got to say the same thing you can think about it in your head but if the soul doesn't speak back the same thing the amen you just got an intellectual conception of the message it takes the holy spirit in you to get a real revelation of the message or other words of the word it takes the holy spirit in you to make the word come alive the message isn't isn't a man's message the message is the son of man's message it's his word all right now he said but he said remember there's a subconscious you say i believe it i believe the word but to remember the subconscious now that's got to say the same thing if it doesn't you'll never get nowhere you might read the bible say well here brother brown the bible says that's true that's exactly right nobody's denying what the bible said okay that's true that's right that's where people say well i believe jesus christ is the son of god and i'm saved i just read it here they say well i believe that jesus christ is son of god and i'm saved that's an intellectual speaking it doesn't do you any good unless that becomes real in you then you speak it the bible said it's a confession of faith not the confession of your your your intellects it's got to be revealed to you it's got to be real in you you've got to be a real believer and something's revealed it's not you speaking it it's him speaking it's that faith speaking amen all right so he says how do you know he's the son of god he said well a son of god and i'm saying but brother brahm said how do you know he's the son of god well the bible said so see and i say well how do you know he's the son of god mother said so the preacher said so well they're right but how do you know the bible said that you cannot know until you have received the holy ghost you're only taking somebody else's word now i don't have to i'm talking to everybody here including young people you'll never go anywhere on your mother and father's religion or their or their salvation or their revelation i was raised the message therefore i'm going into rapture no you're not you're not going anywhere until you're born again and the baptism of the holy ghost is the new birth and you can't even start growing into his stature until that happens that's right you've got to receive the holy ghost you've got to receive the seal of god in order to go there's not two comings of the holy ghost amen now you can search that out in the bible and the in the word in the message and it's right there and you're born you're born then you start growing and it's not you growing it's that word inside of you growing amen amen it's not the man growing it's not the stature of this it's the stature of a perfect man and i'm not a perfect man and you're not either but i am on the inside that's who i am all right so now so but how do you know mother said so preacher said so the bible said you can't okay but that's the that's the truth quote it you can quote it that's the truth no man can say jesus is the christ only by the holy ghost that's right the holy ghost in you has to bear record to the resurrection and jesus being the son of god or you're only taking somebody else's word for it amen you're only taking what the bible says the bible's right or you're only taking what the minister says the minister's right or some other good person said they're right but you and his individual has to know that jesus is the christ until the holy ghost has brought it to you that's right you won't know it until he brings it to you amen now where are you standing tonight see all right now and a real genuine christian will cope with that inside man that spirit that was back yonder at the beginning which is the word a real genuine christian will cope with that inside man i'm getting a little head there so let me back up a minute on the message knoweth it not is this okay i'm just bringing to you what i okay in the message that knoweth it not paragraph 171 he said lookie here here's a little lady twisting herself down the street and here's a young fellow his eyes catch catches it his eyes catches it all right he's got to have a sense there it has to come through those senses to get into that spirit are you with me okay his eyes catches she's twisting down the street morally dressed his eyes catch it all right then and but he's a member of the church and it could be a message church okay might as well bring it down to our where we're at he's a message of he's a he's a member of a message church okay and it can apply to any church or he's a message message believer you'd say amen he's a message believer message professor okay but the first thing you know there's no hold post in there in where right the soul that whole post isn't in your spirit you know you know there's you know you've seen the three circles flesh second circle spirit heart but in that heart is a soul your spirit can can be anointed with the genuine holy spirit but if that soul doesn't have that whole post there if it's not born again or if it's or if it can't or well it will or can't be born again if that whole post isn't there amen there's no keeping power right all right so if there's no hold post there she'll say hello and he's got curly hair and pretty nice looking maybe athletic bodybuilder whatever it may be okay he's a nice looking fellow you know curly hair nice kind nice looking straight shouldered young man maybe tried to live right she started walking up to him even a preacher we see a lot of preachers fall because of women in message churches all right even a preacher and the first thing you know what is it this out here the flesh is desire flesh desire and the spirit down here yet anointed what's it anointed with the genuine holy spirit your spirit can be anointed with the genuine holy spirit but if there's no hope post in the soul all right because the rain falls on the just and the unjust bring the rain the same rain brings the weed up or the wild wheat and the same rain brings the the real wheat to its maturity think of that all right now it's not another rain that does that not another sun you ask any farmer how'd that weed get there oh there was a seed well do you mean the same rain brought the weed up yeah it was ordained to be a weed but the other was ordained and planted by the farmer by the husband is that right all right now you know i won't go any further than that you know how the prophet seen that vision and i seen one in white going sowing seed and one behind him coming in black sowing seed and the rains come and they both shouted and they both hallelujah and they both rejoiced in the rain the falling of the spirit but one could receive the word and be the word and the other couldn't that's a great mystery in this hour and brother branham said that's a mystery that had to be opened after the opening of those seals he said because you're going to need it someday because those two spirits can be so close because they're both anointed amen are you with me one that the word the spirit of the word the word being in you and those that don't have that word and yet anointed with the same holy ghost that you're anointed with and we believe in the anointing oh absolutely remember the soul controls the spirit and the spirit controls the body so if the whole post isn't there no matter what happens eventually it's come come around to what's in that soul that's exactly right all right now okay i don't want to spend a lot of time because i got just a limited amount so let me just go through this pretty quick now what is it out here the flesh desire the spirit down here yet anointed that's a little spirit second realm the spirit down here anointed it's anointed and it's saying don't do it don't do it amen don't do it don't do it but what will it do it'll move right around there and there it goes but a genuine listen to the prophet now genuine born again son of god amen watch that love in that soul christ the holy spirit in you but a genuine born again son of god amen you can't do it in yourself it's totally impossible for a red-blooded male to walk before a female like that without something taking place but when there is something on the inside that little born again something is here he said though that man might have shouted spoken tongues jump up and down and everything else anointed with the spirit done all the signs and wonders that god said in there by his spirit jesus said many will come to me in that day now i want to stop here a minute just because you jump up and down doesn't mean you're lost because you may baptize the holy ghost and jump up and down speak in tongues or whatever and have a genuine baptism so what's the prophet trying to say you can have that without the other so don't don't think you're if you say well i'm afraid to jump up and down i'm afraid to say amen hallelujah nonsense you understand amen i'm talking about the word on the inside of the soul when that when that holy ghost comes and anoints you and that quickens that word in there that's a birth that's a real true baptism in the soul on that word it takes the baptism upon the word seed planted there by god and when you have a desire for him it's a it's a deep calling to the deep there's got to be a deep to respond to that call you have a desire for him then god put that desire in you amen it's not religion this message is not religion this message is eternal life it's not religion it's not a works it's not a religion it's not a church-going affair we believe in going to church we believe and assemble together but it's a love affair with christ it's having christ in you alive in you amen and you say i want that i want that then that's for you god put that in your heart i don't care how it comes or how it happens when it comes just so you get it i mean they were pretty steamed up in the pentecost when they they threw the doors open they come out there drunk like drunk men but what happened they had the truth for that hour revealed in them promised i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and daughters etc etc see they had that they had that genuine filling of the holy ghost where the anointed you bet they were by the same holy spirit that that others can be anointed see see that's why the bible said when when brother brown preached anointed ones the end time he said what the bible say there'd be false prophets false teachers false christs that right false anointed ones what made them false they didn't have the word and the soul the anointing wasn't false when it said false it means that they didn't have the word for the hour there and because the anointing was real but it can only anoint them to do what's wrong but yet they could shout and dance and cast out devils by that spirit satan can't cast out himself amen there's only one thing cast out the devil and that's the holy ghost so nobody's speaking against the works part of it but can you receive the word for the hour can you see the message for the season amen that's what lives out of it all right now all right so i mean you could take a whole message just on that and i don't want to spend too much more time but i've got to go through this but down on the inside of that man see anointed with the spirit done all the works signs and wonders there is many will come to me in that day lord haven't i prophesied in your name haven't i cast out devils in your name and many good works and a lot of things see but he said depart from me you worker of iniquity i never knew you knowing is something he knew before the world began he didn't know you in other words knowing is like a marriage you weren't in me i wasn't in you you did all these things but you turned my word down amen all right you you chose to take a religion and chose to take that instead of my of the truth instead of let me fill you see you denied that filling you wouldn't proceed any further when you're told you must be filled and if you're telling you must be filled we pointed out in the scripture you should be doing everything you can in desperation to get that that's right and i say well i'm okay because the devil will reason with it he'll tell you well you're all right you know you go to church and and you wear long dresses and have long hair and and you do this and you do that why you're okay you sweet little thing without the holy ghost you're nothing you've got to have him in you you've got to have the token or you're not going home in a rapture all right all right now so but down on the inside of that man if that little thai post is there that seed of god that thai post there that seed of god that was predestinated before the foundation world i don't care what takes place it holds him it's there to stay so the word then becomes in you it's your ultimate the word is the ultimate it's the last word it's the ultimate it's the amen amen all right because we go beyond reasoning we don't lean to our own understanding faith doesn't reason at all faith believes it faith faith is revelation and revelation is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen you know it is something you know you something you have it's something tangible it's real it's just as real more real to you than anything else it's that real you have it you know it the promise gives it to you christ in you is the hope of glory christ in you is your assurance christ in you is substance it's a person eternal life is a person and when you have that person you're led and controlled by eternal life that's your head that's your control that's what leads you that's what guides you is eternal life the person of eternal life which is jesus christ and he hasn't changed he doesn't come down here and do something different he keeps what he did did to someone else he does to another when the same conditions met amen he can't he's not a respecter of person amen so so he said it's faith is just as positive as your eyesight see and faith works by love you could go to galatians 5 6 we don't have time to go there but faith works by love and you can't have faith without love amen because faith is love's incentive that's faith i mean that's love express it expresses itself through revelation through faith all right so nothing can take it out i don't care if god says you're healed and it's revealed to your heel doctors can stand there and say you're dying you can just go on with a smile on your face because you know you can that's how positive faith is wherefore brother and be of good courage i believe that god what he said it'll be just as he showed me paul said nobody be lost in this ship god revealed that to me amen and and it's and it's known to me and he showed me brother braham said he'll show his bride amen that's what he said i'll show the bride and she'll follow it she'll do it i show her and she she ha and she does it in my name what is it it's faith he said the same harmony was to exist it's revelation to paul revelation to brother branham it's a revelation to the bride you live by faith the things you do is by faith amen that's right and anything contrary to that word because that's where god's faith comes from is out of the word so anything contrary to that word leave it alone see it's not for you don't reason with the word take him at his word ask god to reveal the word to you make it real to you all right now he says it's that inside man see he said the real generating question christian will cope with that inside man all right because you've now you're setting because you've accepted now you're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus you see where your position is in heavenly places satan has a right to come up there and accuse but he can't move you off your place how many have been accused by the devil he can't move you off your position your position is in heavenly places in christ jesus the believer's position and he's going to come up there as long as he can until the bride goes up he's cast out we read the scripture right in revelations 12 i think it was sunday when he when the when the holy ghost goes up he's cast out he has no more right to that spot but until then he has a right to come before the very throne of god and make the accusing of the other side but remember the judgments come forth the judgment has judged you pure in christ so nothing can take you out of that like like the devil comes up they did this they did that but god says i have no record of that i'm the judge and i say case is dismissed it's been dismissed since the foundation of the world amen because i knew they would accept it when they received it it was all clean nothing there nothing against them there's no record you're justified amen brother jason justified yeah that's right as though you never did it in the first place and you didn't you were in christ amen amen so christ and you identifies your perfect you're in the sinless one how can you be how you're sinless how can you not be sinless if you're in the sinless one that's your position amen all right now the lord shall never fail little triumph no matter what it is then i know there's something inside of all reasoning something inside of all emotions something else like it there was an inside man that held in that hour he's talking about his own test when he's when his daughter his son brother wife their daughter laid there and he said there was something inside of all emotion there's something beyond that something that inside of reasoning because the devil gave him a good reason and spoke 99 percent right that's truth is that right all right then he said but there was something else there there was an inside man that held in that hour notice he did not hold it it held him amen it held in that hour nothing else could have done it every reason everything could be showed everything could prove that it was wrong and i was in the wrong but the word of god that was predestinated before the foundation of the world held on the inside amen amen that's it all right brother sister let me tell you the only thing don't try to reason it out don't try to do it just kind of cope up but just wait before the lord tell something way down on the inside amen on the inside of that man now brother brahm said i went into those cycles those five senses outer realm inner realm and the inside of the inside he said we know that's the holiest of holies you'll never see who you really are until you enter there when you enter there you're face to face with who you are the shekinah himself the glory of god himself god himself amen you've got to go in that little room you've got to go all the way in not just hang out here in the second realm of sanctification you can shout under sanctification the old methodist shout thought they had the holy ghost i saw my grandmother shout the storm up and fall on the floor and and they had to put water on them and everything else to wake him up but she went on believe the message too you see but they thought well we do that we got the holy ghost there was more to come there was a holy ghost but then the holy ghost made way for something else for himself we'll get into that in part four amen so that's what we want to go into but here look then on the inside of that man is a man called spirit on the inside of the outer realm flesh is a man called spirit all right that's what you are that's what you were before you came into flesh you were made in the image of god see all right then that's then that fell are you with me then that spirit that come from sexual was allowed by god someday you'd be totally changed see all right we'll get into all that right now on the inside of that man is a man called spirit and he has five senses and what is it it's reasoning memory conscious affection and imagination that's those five senses and brother brahms said think thought thought love and he says it in other places right down the line so you know he's talking about now you can't think with your body you think with your mind that's the spirit realm and there is where too many christians only stop they can they can just like the corn in the field or the weed in the field they can be anointed with the same holy spirit that the real believers anointed with but down on the inside of that next realm the third realm is the soul that's predestinated of god and there is where the real seed germ lays in there the real seed germ there is the real gift you with me now watch what he says the real gift is in your soul down there see that was born of god and that controls the whole thing to the word of god and the will of god and there you grow up that's what i want to go into later i'm kind of hitting this high point i'm going to go back and pick it up from your birth because we have to come in this hour the message is the coming of the headstone the capstone amen all right which is himself all right so he said so there's where the real seed germ lays and the whole thing keeps the whole thing to the word of god the will of god and there you grow up see then you're a son and daughter of god then he said see then you're a son and daughter of god you're a child of god when you're birthed amen god isn't gonna he has to take his son i'm getting a little ahead of myself but god has to take his son and purr and purr and correct him and chastise him and go through all kinds of tests and trials just to bring the virtues forward hello because he's got to grow into one stature that's christ in him he the word christ in you the birth remember prophet said before the seals were opened the astronomic of heavens five stars lined up you notice recently they said five stars are lining up amen all right and he said it's grace to what the bride he said it was an infant bride coming forth the astronomic of heaven is announcing her approach 62 an infant bride coming forth well what had to open up to bring her to maturity the seals the message of the seventh angel everything would point at catching your attention for that voice amen all right the message of the hour all right now because you can't mature without that everything can be brought up to it's it's it's restoration but there's one thing still lacking there can be no rapturing faith without the opening of those seals amen all right so he said he said well i belong to church he said what are you you're a child of god you're growing up you're a son you're son of god coming forth and you see the word says i should do this i should be born again well i belong to church that don't mean one thing right well i'm ma i'm uh i'm uh i'll just i'll just put it where we are today i'm a message my mother's a messy believer i'm i'm a message believer that's good for your mother and i'm not i'm not i'm not denying a believer but are you a real believer you can profess the message you can say you believe it i just i just told you you can have a head knowledge of that but until you meet the message himself did you catch that till you meet the message until you meet love himself how are you going to have agape love without him living in you you can have feeling you love you can you do good works you can do work works works works and outwork any message believer here but that don't tell me that you're a message believer a real believer a real message believer is that like i said the dynamics coming upon the seed germ in there and bringing the word forth and resurrection in you then you're a partaker then you're a possessor amen now well i'm a pentecostal or whatever i belong then if you don't line with that word there's something wrong then you see your real father is in god because that real start in your soul the real start in your soul before there was even a spirit it was your soul see he said that soul didn't if it didn't come from god it wasn't a germ of god to begin with you're deceived so see he's really bringing us down god searched me it ought to be your prayer god search me show me i want to know you i genuinely in my heart i must know you i can't go on just thinking i'm okay i've got to know you i don't want just imagine i hope i'm okay you've got to have the substance of that promise that's christ in you the hope of glory because faith is the substance of things hoped for amen when you have the substance you have the evidence yes well i need an evidence i gotta i gotta see it happen no you've already seen it happen in faith and that that faith will bring it to a manifestation that's why you can't you can't have even a marriage i mean we're in a marriage but the marriage and the and the union has to be spiritual before it becomes physical are you with me before we meet the lord in the air you're bearing that son to meet him and who's bearing it the bride is bearing it it's the revelation of the word she has his name she's bearing his life she's burying his his himself just like sarah bore the sun in order to meet the sun it had to come to sarah are you with me the faith has to be there before the reality of that if you have to have faith for healing before healing season manifested amen it's pretty simple you have to have that revelation first before the manifestation will follow that see the revelation's got to be there amen we're going to we're going to a wedding supper yet we're feasting at a table right now in faith revelation we're eating of it i'm union to it but i'm going to a great union i'm going to a union where i'll meet him but i've got to meet him now i've got to have him now i've got to see him now i've got to have a spiritual union of faith now in me that's a reality it isn't a hope so it's real and he testifies of it real by living that life through me to the word amen amen i don't know how you say it any clearer amen all right see you're if you're if you're deceived you're in a patch of weeds bearing the world's record of weeds coming forth acting like the world loving the world don't you realize see we don't want that the bible said that before all that christ was he poured in all that christ was was poured into the church all that god was he poured into christ god above us then god was with us in some form now where is it god is in bride form in us god above us god with us god in us amen what is it another christ no the same christ it's the mystery of god revealed in you he takes and opens that mystery to you personally it was hid in you amen and he opens it up of himself it's the unveiling of himself all right now he said brother david i've heard you say that every time you preach and i'll say it and i'll continue to say it because it's the message of the hour that's what's putting a bride in a body change amen it's not it's not just the new birth and you stop you grow you grow into the very headstone you grow into very headship you unite with him it's the person you become the same person you're one it's not twain you're one you're one you're no longer twain the seal didn't open to bring us keep us twain it came to bring us one amen amen yeah we preach new birth we have to preach new birth but there's something beyond the new birth because the new birth made way for the holy ghost himself to come right down in perfection that's the capstone what's the perfection when that comes down upon that upon the individual or upon the church that's a capstone it seals it in this is myself it unites it as one the same person amen you positioned you it places you brother brown said i'm so glad that we can see ourselves positionally placed in christ when would that happen in this day it couldn't happen until this day now i'm way ahead of myself let's drop back here so i can close now the same spirit was in christ is in the bride his body unites them together with all the word and god living in there himself manifesting it amen so the whole thing is god himself materializing it's god himself what is it in you it's god himself materializing who are you god himself materializing tangible made flesh in you the word who is it the word amen amen amen amen all right now you're the manifestation of his thinking all right i won't get into all our acts to declare him i said that but it's going to follow up later on with that all right so i'm taking these out of different why i'm moving so many papers here but anyway now if you're acting like the world desiring the world loving the things of the world because the love of god is not in you when jesus became the fullness of the word then we were in him germ foreign form then not human form then we bypassed the theophany but we were in him germ form we were in him when he would met when he met in that theophany form when he met not the man jesus but the theophany when he met abraham you were in him germ form amen you never entered into the word form of your own body when our earthly tabernacle be dissolved we enter into that if it's before the rapture we enter into that if it is that will come one with the glorified you read who is this melchizedek are we feeding like we should you see that's the thing are we feeding sometimes these things are said and it's like i never heard that before why because you're not feeding you you're too busy on other things amen you say that hurts i didn't tend it to hurt it's the truth it ought to wake us up to the fact that we need to be redeeming the time because the days are evil how do you redeem it buy it back take it out of the devil's hands take a little more time with the word you can make time because i can't make time you can make time you're letting your reasoning and your flesh stand in your way and it becomes an idol before you amen i don't mean to shout at you but i can't preach it any other way i probably wouldn't like john the baptist very well when he stood and then and shouted scream to the top as long as you allah will go there it takes the time you know what i mean though and now since you've recognized it now we sit together when you rose from the dead we rose with him when he rose now we sit together in heavenly places sons and daughters then we were attributes of god god eternal life and god is the only eternal life thing there is then we are in him from the beginning and when jesus became all the word then we were part of him then amen there you are you see he was finished he lived the life that was acceptable for you you are accepted in the beloved the holy ghost in you identifies you are accepted in the beloved amen amen therefore you have no confidence in this flesh doesn't deal with you that way not dealing with you by the way of the flesh if that's the case he's dealing with you according to the law he's putting you under condemnation of the law because not a one of us can keep it but grace holds it right and man and and made way and and fulfilled the law now you're not under the law you're under grace you're under the word it's not saying you don't keep the word you keep the word but if you fail to keep the word grace holds it are you with me all right all right so he said you can be anointed out here in this spirit hear what prophet said you could be anointed in this second realm the spirit and have desires and and do all these other things imagination raising memory conscious when it comes to that thai post that word you'll never move from there he said it'll hold right steady and true to that word as it can be and you have a word for the hour and where the word for the season is present the blood's present did you know that if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship together with him and the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin but you've got to be walking in the light as he is in that light amen because though you're what you're sitting right here hearing the light of the hour and the blood is right here at the cleanse amen if we can recognize he's in our midst his life is in our midst his name which is his life is in her midst his spirit which is the word is in our midst everything we have need of for this journey is provided for us in the holy ghost in you even the rapture even the body change when you receive the holy ghost he comes and dwells in you everything you need for this journey is in you amen all he wants you to do you just wait on me i'll reveal what you need i'll make it known what you need and walk in it as i reveal my word walk in it as i review my words speak it now let's let's close this off real quick here let me see how far i can go here okay i think that some of this i'll just bypass the word can never pass away what is christianity brother brahm said christianity you wanna know what christianity is everybody uses that word i'm a christian i'm a christian but what is it christianity is when the holy ghost has taken full possession of you and you're led by the holy ghost by the holy spirit think of that when the holy ghost has full possession of you and you're led by the holy spirit no matter how good you know what and it's going to be some hard going until the holy ghost gets full possession of you a lot of us many years many trials many many things but god will achieve it nothing going to stop him he's obligated to that word you can't stop it it may take a while but until he gets you to let go and let him have his way because always something else will come before you and you bother that instead of the promise instead of what he said why that's fear amen a lot of things could be said on that couldn't it amen because there's a lot of things that maybe he wants you to realize and let go of to fulfill what he called in your life you've got to let go of it oh brother i can't let go because if i do this will happen that who says this and that will happen isn't god able to keep his word and he said he'd provide all of your needs i can say amen amen i can say amen but you have now watch we can preach the word explain the word but you have to receive the word you have to hear it that's see and you don't hear it with these ears you hear it with your heart there's something in your heart that has the ability to hear the word receive it amen that's called seed of god amen all right let's let's close that off let's get down here to my closing i wonder i want to i want to cover this just quickly as i can right here i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed i want you to hear this i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst now think of that deeply because sufficience means adequate fully are we adequately impressed are we fully impressed do we really are we really sufficiently impressed i tell you if you knew if that was the case you would recognize his presence and if you recognize his presence it's going to change the way you talk and walk and speak how you take things what you do your reactions when you recognize you're in his presence he's walking in you he's living in you brother braham said we recognize it recognize that we'd have a different attitude towards we'd have a different outlook we wouldn't be letting so many things become in our way that we worship and bow to instead of him it comes between us i can say some strong words right here but paul said it flee idolatry flee that spirit because that spirit is a strong spirit he'll present everything he can and put it between you and the word you don't need to add to or take anything from the word the word is absolutely fully flawless and perfect it doesn't need anything added to it and faith will say it's so just like he said it and claim it and walk in it and act on it amen that's what faith does all right now so i wonder if we're sufficiently or adequate to an adequate degree fully impressed with the word in our midst let me give you a thought here how do you pray who's the word in our midst it's jesus the word god the word your husband the word let me give you a thought here how do we pray and that's interesting how we said prayer the song was sung i was that a recording with somebody singing that in here recording yeah do we pray we pray in jesus name don't we look at all watch how this spreads then what is jesus name what is life the prophet said this what is the life the name all right so that name has to be in you this is a real christian that name is in you because we have his name in us his life his self we pray in jesus name amen he said every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer all right the word impressed are we sufficiently impressed impressed means showing admiration or respect for the word in our midst are we are we are we admiring and respecting the word in our midst amen are we are we do we have an admiration for it do we have a genuine respect for it it's quiet in here isn't it it's the truth it is the truth all right we then we ask would be careful how we ask what we ask because you realize that saint john 15 7 said if you abide in me and my word in you you carry that word you're carrying that life it's in you the name is in you the person's in you he said this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us if you abide in me in my word my word is the will if you abide in me and my word abides in you ask what you will is it you asking no it's my lips it's my voice but who's asking he's the one speaking he's the one asking because i have him i carry him he's in me if my word and you if you abide in me in my word and you ask what you will because why because it's me in you you're not going to ask contrary the word if you ask contrary to the word you won't get what you asked for are you with me all right so it's him doing the speaking now watch how we unfold this just just i'm i'm closing now he said this is the confidence we have in him see the confidence we haven't if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us if we know that he hear us whatever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him okay lamentations 337 said who is he that saith speaks ask who is he that sayeth and it cometh to pass when the lord commanded it not so who's doing the inspiration who's giving you the go-ahead to speak it if you abide in me and my word in you it's him in you doing the speaking asking it's him and you doing the leading it's him and you inspiring you have the mind of christ remember she has come ahead of myself here she has thus saith the lord all right so you see he said now we ask what is the will of god the only way you would know his will and that is by the word of god right he said there it is he said the word jesus the name is the word the will so jesus is the word jesus is the revel revealed word in you is the word the will are you with me that's the will all right said you can't separate god and the word they are one now look at how he brings this out now then this word he is left behind on the printed page is a part of him when you accept it by faith are you with me what is faith revelation the believer the real believer in you is that faith amen that's that faith in you is the believer brother brahm said don't you like that he said he made that say don't you like that let that come alive to you see the real believer is the faith all right he said he said then the word he said now is a part of him the word is left behind on the printed page is part of him when you accept it by faith into a spirit-filled life that makes the difference now he said that his word was life is that right his word is life so his will is his word and his word is life and the life the word is in you and that's his name the name is the name of a person all right now he said he said that his word was life that's exactly what it is i am the way the truth the life if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his all right now closing there it is he is spirit and he is life yes so he the word is spirit and life in you his spirit and his life but that's in you how do we pray we pray in jesus name don't we yes all right that's exactly what the word is see what is it doing it's bringing you face to face with the revelation this is yourself this is you this is you the real you the holy spirit in you the word the life the truth ask what you will what are you asking the revealed word watch what watch it now he said that is exactly what jesus is he is the word that's what the word is that's exactly what jesus is is the revealed word brother brown said your husband jesus your husband is the revealed word all right he said so when a spirit born watch this he is the word so when a spirit-born spirit-filled man in faith the big statement in faith who's going to direct that you can't pump it up you can't work it up he sovereignly gives it is that right but he said i'll meet every need i'll bring it to you when you have need of it i'll reveal my word as you have need of it see this is a consolation you don't have to work it up at all watch what a spirit-filled believer will do with it he said when a spirit born spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it now watch now watch what brother brown said in the seals he reveals his thought to you just like he did to moses he revealed his thought he reveals his thought he said that's the word he then faith takes the word into his heart now it's a word that's right but it's not a word out of you yet but it's a revealed thought that's hid in the word so we call it the revelation of the word watch what a real believer will do he said he said when you take it in faith into his heart so the word the thought is revealed to you it's still a thought until what happens something's got to happen because that's god's way and god doesn't change his way he re it was in his heart it was in his thought in revelation and he spoke the worlds into existence and he speaks you into existence how were you brought to birth by a spoken word it's always been god's way of doing it amen are you with me and so he said he said when a spirit born spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips he said it's still a thought until you speak it then it becomes a word now you're seeing saint john 15 7. he said if you really see saint john 57 then you know who you are all right then he said he said when he takes it and places it on his lips why that is the same as deity or god jesus the life the name speaking amen it's the same as deity speaking where's the speaking out of your lips your heart you see the oneness here you see who the real you is he's got the same ability as god as father only god the father is above him bringing the word to him revealing it to him and he speaks faith hold fast the confession of your imagination reasoning memory conscience feelings no faith hallelujah hallelujah do you love him every mountain has to go satan cannot stand before that man now you know satan not afraid of a man but what's he speaking of that man christ that man that's inside of you veil behind your skin he's scared the death of that because you'll take him back to the word it's written it's written of me go back and tell the devil what's written of you go attack and tech back to
