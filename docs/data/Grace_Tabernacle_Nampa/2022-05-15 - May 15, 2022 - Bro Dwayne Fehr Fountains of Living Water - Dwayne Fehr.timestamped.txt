[43:51] those words
[43:58] [Music]
[44:09] god bless you this morning
[44:12] just wanted to say a couple things i
[44:13] just wanted to first of all
[44:16] thank everyone i promised myself i
[44:18] wouldn't get emotional here but you guys
[44:19] didn't help me out much
[44:27] i just want to thank everybody for the
[44:29] the kind words and the prayers and the
[44:31] um
[44:33] phone calls texts and stuff and stuff it
[44:36] um
[44:37] last saturday when we took her in
[44:40] you know we didn't we had no idea what
[44:42] was coming and we felt like we got hit
[44:44] by a train
[44:45] um it was
[44:47] very difficult
[44:48] um i won't say that it's gotten easier
[44:52] to complete you know
[44:55] changes changes the way you do things
[44:57] that's for sure but um
[45:00] but most of you know i think
[45:02] i just want to say a couple things about
[45:04] this so
[45:05] type 1 diabetes
[45:06] this is what the doctors say
[45:09] doctors say that she'll have it for the
[45:10] rest of her life they say that it's an
[45:12] autoimmune disease
[45:14] at one day something happens and
[45:16] triggers a
[45:17] an autoimmune response that the uh
[45:20] your
[45:21] immune or your you know your white blood
[45:23] cells begin attacking the b cells and
[45:24] the pancreas and that's what produces
[45:26] the insulin
[45:28] they don't know why they don't know when
[45:30] they don't know how
[45:33] and it it it's it's not necessarily
[45:35] genetic
[45:37] two identical twins
[45:39] can be born with the same dna one will
[45:41] get it one won't they don't know why
[45:43] they have no idea
[45:48] that's what the doctors say
[45:52] i think we have a
[45:54] little different outlook on things
[46:01] when we got this news
[46:04] i think it was actually sunday when they
[46:05] when they confirmed they said she has
[46:06] type 1 diabetes she's got all the you
[46:08] know the
[46:09] things in the blood that show that all
[46:11] these different things
[46:13] i uh
[46:14] i was driving
[46:16] back into
[46:18] i well the first thing that came to me
[46:22] you know
[46:24] first thing that came to me was the the
[46:25] scripture and jeremiah 29 11. for i know
[46:27] the plans i have for you
[46:29] plans of
[46:31] peace not of evil to bring you an
[46:33] expected end
[46:35] and i'll tell you i felt peace in that
[46:37] immediately
[46:39] i felt peace knowing the word of god
[46:41] knowing what it says about healing
[46:43] and i'll be honest i think i
[46:46] i may you know
[46:48] physically hear you you show some
[46:50] emotion i don't think there's anything
[46:51] wrong with that but
[46:54] i believe that almost like abraham you
[46:57] know
[46:58] he got that word from god
[47:00] and he rested in it yes
[47:01] he arrested it and it was done
[47:04] he didn't see it right away he maybe
[47:06] even didn't see signs of it right away
[47:08] but it happened and it was done
[47:11] and
[47:13] i i just felt that and and um
[47:16] i popped in on tape you know it's what
[47:18] you do right
[47:20] that's what we do
[47:23] and i wanted to read a little bit from
[47:24] you this i just happened to pop in god
[47:26] has a provided way
[47:28] hallelujah and i i honestly i did i just
[47:30] scrolled through my phone and i hit play
[47:32] on something i just needed to hear
[47:33] something right
[47:34] and i believe this this is what i needed
[47:36] to hear
[47:38] amen
[47:39] and he
[47:40] he's starting out and he said if i were
[47:42] to say anything about a text for tonight
[47:44] i wish to speak on this god has a
[47:46] provided way
[47:47] he has a provided way of approach to him
[47:49] he has a provided way of escape and he
[47:52] has a provided way for everything we
[47:53] have need of if we can only find that
[47:55] way god is provided then we're sure to
[47:57] get it
[47:59] if god if this building was provided
[48:01] here to take care of to keep the rain
[48:03] off of us
[48:04] as long as we get into that building
[48:06] then we're out of the ring
[48:08] if god has a provided way for salvation
[48:10] we can find that provided way we can
[48:12] have salvation
[48:14] if god has a provided way
[48:16] a divine healing then we can find
[48:19] get in that way we find divine healing
[48:23] if he's provided peace for the unstable
[48:25] then we get in that way and we find his
[48:26] provided way we can have peace
[48:29] hallelujah
[48:30] that just
[48:32] further on down he's talking about ruth
[48:34] and i can find it here
[48:39] he's talking about ruth and boaz
[48:42] and he's talking about
[48:44] you know when boaz goes to claim naomi
[48:46] to get ruth right
[48:50] and he says get ready here it is
[48:52] oh i just feel something moving
[48:55] notice christ before the elders of
[48:56] israel and this you know he's typing
[48:59] boaz right
[49:01] led outside the gates of the city and
[49:03] made a testimony he was wounded for our
[49:05] transgressions and with his stripes we
[49:07] were healed
[49:08] a public testimony he has redeemed the
[49:11] church from what her lost estate in the
[49:13] garden of eden we didn't have any
[49:14] sickness we didn't
[49:16] the garden of eden we had no sin the
[49:18] garden of eden we had no death and god
[49:19] so loved the world he gave his only
[49:21] begotten son made a testimony outside of
[49:23] the gate that provided way of escape for
[49:26] all who wanted to come
[49:27] what a beautiful picture i hope you can
[49:29] see it now the lord be blessed
[49:31] glory to god
[49:32] that just
[49:34] you know it just confirmed to me
[49:37] and
[49:38] some
[49:39] some things
[49:40] i think the
[49:41] one of one of the one of the statements
[49:43] he made made in there was um
[49:46] god doesn't have to heal to prove prove
[49:48] his power
[49:50] he has to heal to keep his word and he's
[49:53] gonna do it
[49:55] he's gonna do it
[49:58] amen the thing about this and i've had
[50:01] friends that say it i've had
[50:03] i've had you know the doctors that say
[50:05] it and they say well you guys will just
[50:06] get used to the new normal you know what
[50:08] it's not the new normal and i don't
[50:10] accept it
[50:12] it doesn't have to be that way
[50:14] god bless you
[50:24] amen god bless you
[50:26] god bless you

[50:29] minutes

[50:34] paul
[50:36] you and i got to talk
[50:42] there is no such thing as the devil's
[50:44] new normal yes that's right there is a
[50:47] normal that comes
[50:49] yeah you're right you're right i'm sorry
[50:52] here i go and i'm gonna ask my wife if
[50:54] she come to piano though
[50:56] seeing as someone asked if we would
[50:58] uh if we'd sing you know every winter
[51:01] they got the howling down in the desert
[51:02] there are the harmony in the desert and
[51:04] um
[51:05] and
[51:06] we just come from the north so it's the
[51:08] chattering of the north that we'll bring
[51:09] with us and
[51:11] uh i'll i'll tell you what brother isaac
[51:16] we don't believe in the devil's new
[51:18] normal
[51:19] you know oh
[51:21] for the last man it's been four years
[51:22] since i've been here and all these kids
[51:24] have grown up and
[51:25] and brother jason's gotten old and
[51:27] brother paul's gotten older and and you
[51:30] know i i'm it's just like
[51:32] it's constantly changing right brother
[51:33] dwayne's losing his hair
[51:35] and
[51:37] [Music]
[51:38] and then we've been through this plague
[51:40] called covid
[51:43] it's not the new normal
[51:45] if they want to accept it they can
[51:47] accept it
[51:49] but you and i
[51:51] we have one thing that we accept
[51:53] everything else is rejected
[51:55] so by his stripes we are
[51:58] present tense
[51:59] not war we are
[52:01] healed
[52:03] and that little girl we have just seen
[52:04] god do so many supernatural things now
[52:07] there ain't no reason in this world that
[52:10] that little girl has to carry that
[52:12] uh
[52:13] i want to say you know how the devil
[52:14] does he loves to everywhere as you go
[52:16] now everybody's marked they've got
[52:18] tattoos they've got piercings they've
[52:19] got you know they've got striped hairs
[52:21] they've got they're they're all trying
[52:22] to find an identification
[52:24] but there's a reality here too
[52:28] we also have an identification
[52:31] and we also have a mark and the mark of
[52:33] a real believer is that he can say
[52:35] that belongs to me
[52:37] that is mine whether the rest of the
[52:39] world can accept it or receive it or not
[52:42] that's not up to us
[52:43] but we have thus saith the lord this
[52:45] morning
[52:46] this is our word this is our time this
[52:50] is listen brother brown said this is
[52:52] this is the hour that god chose to
[52:54] manifest
[52:55] you which was an eternal attribute of
[52:58] almighty god so jesus could say i come
[53:01] from god i go to god you can say the
[53:04] same thing you might we might be trapped
[53:06] in this body we might be walking in
[53:08] idaho dirt
[53:09] but let me tell you something this
[53:11] morning idaho dirt has got to give way
[53:13] to the supernatural god on the inside
[53:16] he can say amen to his own word he can
[53:19] receive what this world can't receive
[53:22] there's no wonder brother brown said to
[53:24] us all things
[53:25] are possible
[53:27] all things are possible
[53:29] listen if we can if we can receive it
[53:31] this morning we can receive a body
[53:32] change
[53:33] how much more can we receive healing of
[53:35] our bodies
[53:36] i'll tell you what you know how brother
[53:38] brown said he said man i was so sick to
[53:40] my stomach he said that ulcer just eat
[53:42] me up and he said and i read in the word
[53:44] where god said by his stripes i'm healed

[53:48] breakfast
[53:50] and he said and it came as soon as it
[53:51] hit bottom it came straight back up he
[53:53] said i put my hand over

[54:33] the desert

[54:36] book that are rejoicing and screaming

[1:05:08] multitude
[1:05:09] which no man could number of all nations
[1:05:11] and kindreds and peoples and tongues
[1:05:13] stood before the throne
[1:05:14] before the lamb clothed with white robes
[1:05:18] palms in their hands and cried with a
[1:05:20] loud voice saying
[1:05:21] so you know what can we just can we just
[1:05:23] read this one together
[1:05:25] we're going to say it together someday

[1:05:30] salvation to our god which sitteth upon
[1:05:34] the throne
[1:05:35] and the land
[1:05:37] and all the angels stood around about
[1:05:39] the throne and about the elders and the
[1:05:40] four beasts and fell before the throne
[1:05:42] on their faces and worshiped god saying
[1:05:44] amen blessing and glory and wisdom
[1:05:47] thanksgiving and honor and power and
[1:05:49] might be unto our god forever and ever
[1:05:52] amen and one of the elders answers
[1:05:54] saying unto me what are these which are
[1:05:56] arrayed in white robes
[1:05:57] and once came they
[1:05:59] and i said unto him sir thou knowest
[1:06:02] and he said to me these are they which
[1:06:04] came out of
[1:06:06] great tribulation
[1:06:07] i'll tell you what brother don't you
[1:06:09] ever let's not complain too much about
[1:06:11] our tribulations that we're going
[1:06:12] through these are they which came out of
[1:06:14] great tribulation and have washed their
[1:06:17] robes and made them white
[1:06:19] in the blood of the lamb
[1:06:22] and therefore are they before the throne
[1:06:23] of god and serve him day and night
[1:06:26] in his temple and he that sitteth on the
[1:06:28] throne shall dwell among them they shall
[1:06:30] hunger no more neither shall neither
[1:06:32] thirst anymore
[1:06:34] neither shall the sun light on them nor
[1:06:36] any heat

[1:06:40] zone in if i can on this verse verse 17

[1:06:47] and shall lead them unto living
[1:06:50] fountains of water

[1:07:34] minister the way that would please you
[1:07:36] the most in jesus christ's name
[1:07:39] amen
[1:07:40] amen god bless you saints you can take
[1:07:42] your seats
[1:07:44] if i can take a
[1:07:46] a little thought this morning a little
[1:07:48] title as it were
[1:07:50] i i want to speak on living waters
[1:07:53] and
[1:07:54] lord gave me this little thought i don't
[1:07:55] know some months back and
[1:07:57] i i got all blessed over it the first
[1:07:59] time and i've appreciated a couple times
[1:08:00] since then and every time i i think on
[1:08:02] it i get blessed by so i'm gonna trust
[1:08:04] that it'll be the same kind of blessing
[1:08:05] for you this morning and
[1:08:07] and
[1:08:08] i i just have to
[1:08:11] reiterate that last scripture i want us
[1:08:13] to notice something here it says for the
[1:08:15] lamb
[1:08:16] which is in the midst of the throne
[1:08:19] shall feed them and shall lead them unto
[1:08:21] living
[1:08:22] fountains of water
[1:08:25] and
[1:08:26] you know where sometimes when we when we
[1:08:28] get looking in you know the book of
[1:08:30] revelations is is completely written in
[1:08:32] mystery form and it's and it's written
[1:08:34] that way for purpose because it's not to
[1:08:35] the people of the world this is the
[1:08:37] bride's book
[1:08:39] she is a supernatural people therefore
[1:08:41] this supernatural book is given to her
[1:08:44] to understand the mystery that's written
[1:08:45] in it and you know be beyond the letters
[1:08:48] of the words that are written in the
[1:08:50] book
[1:08:51] there's a life
[1:08:52] that's being projected
[1:08:54] and if we can just receive that life
[1:08:56] we'll we'll recognize that it's all
[1:08:57] about christ and his little bride
[1:08:59] and
[1:09:01] and so when we get to you know sometimes
[1:09:03] we we're so programmed you know as
[1:09:05] little kids we get we end up in school
[1:09:07] and and we get to reading books and then
[1:09:09] you get to watching uh you know videos
[1:09:11] of people projecting things and
[1:09:14] and you know as it were when we uh when
[1:09:16] we would consider a throne
[1:09:18] we would look at it like you know like a
[1:09:20] big big old chair and we sit down in it
[1:09:23] and it's you know it's all ornate and
[1:09:25] and
[1:09:26] and and you know the arms erode and it's
[1:09:29] everything is and it's and it's it's
[1:09:31] it's it's cut for a king to sit in so
[1:09:34] when we speak of a throne that's what we
[1:09:36] would speak that's what our minds would
[1:09:38] go to is is this this great beautiful
[1:09:41] big chair and and a kingly figure
[1:09:44] sitting in that chair
[1:09:46] but i want us to notice something
[1:09:48] brother brown says this and i'm just
[1:09:49] going to set a little background this
[1:09:50] morning before i get into my into my
[1:09:52] thought brother adam says this he's in
[1:09:54] prayer and
[1:09:56] and so we would we would realize it this
[1:09:58] way that you know the god the god that
[1:10:01] we believe is god uh he's god of heavens
[1:10:04] he's god of earth he's god of everything
[1:10:06] and he's so great that he's got to be
[1:10:08] somewhere in the eternities and he's
[1:10:10] sitting on a great throne and from there
[1:10:12] he's ruling all things that we get a
[1:10:14] mental picture like that so brother
[1:10:16] branham says this and he says heavenly
[1:10:18] father he's just going into prayer he
[1:10:19] says we are now approaching
[1:10:22] the great mighty throne of god as mortal
[1:10:25] beings in a natural body yet our voice
[1:10:28] is speaking out the words that's coming
[1:10:30] into that great throne
[1:10:32] somewhere in another dimension where god
[1:10:35] sits
[1:10:36] and so if we just take that very thought
[1:10:39] we would think you know
[1:10:41] in our prayers we're praying out
[1:10:43] somewhere in another dimension where god
[1:10:45] sits but i i want us to recognize
[1:10:48] something because it was never god's
[1:10:50] intent like it was in the beginning when
[1:10:52] he did exist in the eternities it was
[1:10:55] never his intent to remain there as an
[1:10:58] unknown god on a throne that you and i
[1:11:01] could never see could never be part of
[1:11:04] well you know it would just be some
[1:11:05] figment of our imagination so he
[1:11:08] absolutely you know we recognize that
[1:11:10] when jesus was here in matthew the 28th
[1:11:12] chapter when jesus was here after he had
[1:11:15] uh i was after the the resurrection he
[1:11:18] comes back to his disciples and he makes
[1:11:20] his statement to them
[1:11:22] he said all power in heaven and all
[1:11:24] power in earth has been given
[1:11:27] into my hands
[1:11:30] all power in heaven and earth has been
[1:11:32] given
[1:11:33] unto me
[1:11:35] what was it here comes a prophet thank
[1:11:37] god for a prophet
[1:11:39] here comes the prophecy what was it he
[1:11:41] said
[1:11:42] man and god
[1:11:44] had united
[1:11:46] the supernatural god the unseen god had
[1:11:49] become flesh
[1:11:51] and now listen to what he says here he
[1:11:53] says man and god had united the logos
[1:11:57] had been made flesh and had been killed
[1:12:00] and rose again for our justification
[1:12:03] and was then the anointed emmanuel
[1:12:06] forever and forever now listen close
[1:12:09] god had changed his dwelling place
[1:12:13] from a throne in the space's yonder
[1:12:17] to the heart of his son christ jesus
[1:12:20] to live and reign forever god was in
[1:12:22] christ he's the final resting place of
[1:12:25] the spirit so watch as god is
[1:12:28] condescending it was god spirit in the
[1:12:31] eternities and he's and this is how we
[1:12:33] picture god let's let's be real this
[1:12:35] morning
[1:12:36] let's be real this morning because when
[1:12:38] you get down to pray you've got this uh
[1:12:40] you've got this unknown face kind of
[1:12:42] that you're praying to this and you're
[1:12:44] and you're praying out into a god in the
[1:12:46] eternity somewhere and many times if
[1:12:48] you're just praying in your flesh i'll
[1:12:50] be honest you're not praying nobody
[1:12:53] you're not praying to nobody because he
[1:12:54] ain't existing up there anymore
[1:12:57] that's not where that's our mind's
[1:12:59] imagination if satan can keep him there
[1:13:02] and and he and you have no idea of who
[1:13:05] he is or no relationship with him you
[1:13:08] are a defeated person this morning
[1:13:10] if you have no idea who he is you are
[1:13:12] defeated this morning
[1:13:14] that's not where god wanted and he knew
[1:13:16] we would be in this condition so he
[1:13:19] steps down into a body of flesh he comes
[1:13:22] as you and i are
[1:13:24] and he takes on the whole uh uh how the
[1:13:27] whole struggles and troubles and
[1:13:29] frustrations of of this life to become
[1:13:33] that sacrifice now listen we know the
[1:13:35] body is laying up there somewheres and
[1:13:38] he's making intercession on our behalf
[1:13:41] but the blood has been shed
[1:13:43] so brother branham makes this statement
[1:13:45] and may i encourage you in this this is
[1:13:46] not my notes right now but may i
[1:13:48] encourage you this morning
[1:13:50] brother branham makes this mistake this
[1:13:52] statement he says listen god does not
[1:13:55] see you
[1:13:58] that's it so when the enemy comes to you
[1:14:00] and says paul
[1:14:02] i've seen what you did the other day oh
[1:14:04] god forgive me i know you were no no no
[1:14:07] no god didn't even see it
[1:14:09] god didn't even see it that's right
[1:14:12] but he had an accuser of the accuser of
[1:14:14] the brother and walked up into his face
[1:14:16] and said hey you know what paul was
[1:14:18] doing the other day
[1:14:20] and father's like no
[1:14:23] no i know i don't
[1:14:25] well let me tell you what he's
[1:14:26] doing and watch satan begin to rattle
[1:14:29] off all your mistakes and all your
[1:14:30] failures and all your shortcomings and
[1:14:33] father just go like this hold on stay in
[1:14:35] spirit realm but he condescended into
[1:14:37] flesh you know all these things but i
[1:14:39] want to set this background here this
[1:14:40] morning brother brown says this listen
[1:14:43] he is now sitting on his father's jesus
[1:14:45] says this our brother says this about
[1:14:47] jesus he is now sitting on his father's
[1:14:49] throne
[1:14:50] in other words listen close we're
[1:14:52] talking about a throne this morning in
[1:14:54] other words he is setting in god's power
[1:14:59] in spirit now
[1:15:02] when he comes back he'll set in an
[1:15:05] earthly body on david's throne
[1:15:09] okay so when we're talking about a
[1:15:11] throne we're talking about a place where
[1:15:13] god would what would rule and reign from
[1:15:17] it's not just a big chair even though it
[1:15:20] may be it's not just a big chair that's
[1:15:22] all ornate in the in the in the
[1:15:24] eternity's yonder somewheres god is
[1:15:26] condescending now he was standing in
[1:15:28] christ in the body and from there he was
[1:15:32] ruling and reigning over sin over
[1:15:34] sickness over frustration over anxiety
[1:15:37] over all of our discouragements he was
[1:15:39] reigning over pain he was reigning over
[1:15:41] all these things that we would go he was
[1:15:43] ruling over it in that body
[1:15:46] all right praise the lord okay
[1:15:49] now brother brown makes he makes this
[1:15:50] statement i want to i'm just i'm trying
[1:15:52] to bring this all down so i don't get
[1:15:54] too too long-winded here this morning
[1:15:56] lord help me
[1:15:58] all right how many is going to give me
[1:16:00] grace this morning

[1:20:48] lead us to this morning fountains
[1:20:51] of living
[1:20:53] waters fountains have lived listen uh
[1:20:55] this whole thought came to me praise god
[1:20:57] you don't mind if i do this i know that
[1:20:59] we're just firmer enough that we can get
[1:21:01] away with this here listen
[1:21:04] living waters this whole thing struck me
[1:21:06] back you know we're all going through
[1:21:07] the covet thing and hey you know you got
[1:21:09] way too much time on your hands we we
[1:21:11] cuz some of us were locked up at home
[1:21:12] for a while and and so you know we got
[1:21:15] to get healthy and
[1:21:17] brother dwayne gets to looking at this
[1:21:18] juicing stuff right and
[1:21:20] and so i'm i'm pretty intrigued with
[1:21:22] this you know we're getting older and
[1:21:24] we're starting trying to stay younger
[1:21:25] and it's not working and and so finally
[1:21:28] we get
[1:21:30] all of a sudden i'm watching this little
[1:21:31] clip
[1:21:33] and it's talking about
[1:21:34] this juicing thing
[1:21:37] it says you take the plant
[1:21:39] and you pull the plant out of the ground
[1:21:41] and you cut off the roots of it and then
[1:21:44] you take it while it's still alive i
[1:21:45] hope you're listening well it's still
[1:21:47] alive and you crush it it goes through
[1:21:49] the juicer it grinds it and all the life
[1:21:53] that's in the plant it's at that time
[1:21:56] when the it's they call it living water
[1:21:59] because the life of the plant is still
[1:22:01] in the water it's in the liquid form now
[1:22:04] and that form you drink it and it
[1:22:06] becomes your portion
[1:22:08] listen church i'm reminded of another
[1:22:10] tree that was crushed that was broken
[1:22:13] that was run through the ringer and when
[1:22:15] it came out it brought forth what living
[1:22:18] water
[1:22:19] hallelujah we get to looking at these
[1:22:21] living waters and we can go right back
[1:22:22] through the scripture and we're going to
[1:22:23] take a little journey this morning we
[1:22:25] can go right back into the garden of
[1:22:27] eden in genesis chapter 2 it says and
[1:22:29] the lord planted a garden eastward in
[1:22:31] eden and when he and there he put the
[1:22:33] man whom he had formed and out of the
[1:22:36] ground made the lord to grow every tree
[1:22:39] that is pleasant to sight and can i just
[1:22:41] stop a moment on this i get so thrilled
[1:22:43] when i read these scriptures
[1:22:46] listen we get a mental picture and god
[1:22:48] help me if i'm wrong but how many
[1:22:49] believes there's natural fulfillments of
[1:22:51] things there are spiritual fulfillment
[1:22:53] god has compound meaning in his word and
[1:22:56] don't miss the spiritual aspect of it
[1:22:58] listen there is billions there's 8
[1:23:00] billion people on the face of this earth
[1:23:02] and i want to say probably 5 billion of
[1:23:04] them have a bible in their homes
[1:23:06] in some form or another they got a bible
[1:23:09] in their homes they've got a letter
[1:23:11] written but they miss the living portion
[1:23:13] of it they miss the reality of it here
[1:23:16] the scripture says it says and out of
[1:23:18] the ground made the lord to grow every
[1:23:20] tree that is pleasant to sight and good
[1:23:22] for food
[1:23:24] all right and good i'm not just talking
[1:23:26] listen church it wasn't just a pear tree
[1:23:28] and an apple tree and yeah listen when
[1:23:31] when jesus healed the man brother paul
[1:23:33] he was blind and when he spit in his
[1:23:35] blood he put stuff on his eyes and he
[1:23:37] said can you see what do you see now he
[1:23:38] says i see men as trees walking

[2:07:18] we are subjects of the kingdom of god

[2:07:22] are an ambassador of that kingdom and
[2:07:25] all the power of glory is behind you

[2:07:29] all of heaven is behind you to back you
[2:07:31] up

[2:07:36] amen you know they tell a little story
[2:07:38] oh lord help me to get this done but
[2:07:40] they tell a little story and you hear
[2:07:41] you've heard about it over and over i'm
[2:07:43] sure you know they get weddings and and
[2:07:45] some of you guys some of you all come
[2:07:47] from the you know you know from the
[2:07:48] african continent and there's things
[2:07:49] that you do there that we don't do but
[2:07:51] one of them is called the purchase price
[2:07:52] of the bride the bride price
[2:07:55] you know the story how that we got about
[2:07:58] we got african brothers at home in our
[2:07:59] church and i know they had to go and buy
[2:08:01] their bride they had to pay the dowry to
[2:08:03] this is what she's
[2:08:04] so there's a little story that says
[2:08:06] there's a man that yeah you know you
[2:08:07] know a traitor
[2:08:09] and you know the story he traded
[2:08:11] you know he traded from you know from
[2:08:13] this continent to that continent from
[2:08:14] this place to that place and he became
[2:08:16] kind of wealthy but there he'd always
[2:08:18] stop on one island and there's this
[2:08:19] young lady on that island that he had
[2:08:21] known since she was a little girl
[2:08:23] and he'd watched her grow up but her
[2:08:25] daddy had always
[2:08:27] you know as she got older uh you know
[2:08:30] the men didn't want her
[2:08:33] and so her daddy became discouraged and
[2:08:35] he began you know he began talking down
[2:08:37] at her you know the reason they don't
[2:08:38] want you is because you're ugly the
[2:08:39] reason you're not worth nothing and you
[2:08:41] know you don't even deserve to have a
[2:08:43] husband all you deserve to do is be a
[2:08:44] slave and listen
[2:08:47] that's how the enemy talks
[2:08:50] but do you realize that that enemy has
[2:08:52] such a possession in people of this
[2:08:54] world that that's how parents talk to
[2:08:56] their children
[2:08:58] and that little woman she just got she
[2:09:00] got more discouraged more discouraged
[2:09:02] more discouraged she begin to think
[2:09:03] she's worth nothing i'm not valuable she
[2:09:06] would walk around with her head down
[2:09:08] she'd be going
[2:09:09] come on church
[2:09:12] come on that's exactly what the enemy
[2:09:14] tells you day after day bombardment
[2:09:16] after bombardment failure after failure
[2:09:18] he tells you you're worth nothing that
[2:09:20] your life means nothing that god has no
[2:09:23] purpose for your life that you're not
[2:09:24] valuable to anybody that's what satan
[2:09:26] wants to tell you
[2:09:29] and here comes this trader in and he's
[2:09:31] been watching this young lady and he's
[2:09:33] got his honor so he makes a proposition
[2:09:35] to the man he says i want to i want to
[2:09:36] marry your daughter

[2:12:07] with his bride

[2:21:37] he takes ezekiel out
[2:21:39] and he leads him out into the water
[2:21:44] it was about a thousand furlongs or
[2:21:45] something like that if i remember right
[2:21:46] he leads him out into the water
[2:21:48] [Music]
[2:21:49] and ezekiel looks and it's up to his

[2:22:33] there we got the pentecostal age they
[2:22:36] begin to splash and throw their hands in
[2:22:37] the air and appreciate god for the gifts
[2:22:39] and it was all good it's all the moving
[2:22:40] of the spirit
