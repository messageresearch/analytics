TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Thank you. [Music] God bless you friends. Good evening. Good to be with all of you. Let's start with this song. Hide thou me number 560. [Music] Sometimes I feel discouraged and think my life in vain. I'm tempted then to murmur and of my lot complain. But when I think of Jesus and all he's done for me, then I cry, "Oh rock of aes, high thou me. Oh rock of aes hide thou me. No other reuge have I but thee. When life's dark veil I wonder far, far from thee. Then I cry, oh rock of aes, high thou me. Sometimes it seems I dare not go one step farther on. And from my heart all courage has slipped away and gone. But I remember Jesus and all his love for me. Then I cry, "Oh rock of aesence, hide thou me. Oh rock of aes hide thou me. No other reuge [Music] have I but thee. When life's dark veil I wander far, far from thee. Then I cry, O rock of agees, high thou me. Oh, what a friend is Jesus. Sure anor for my soul. So tender, true, and gracious. I'm safe in his control. My help in time of danger. My strong defense is me. Oh thou blessed rock of aes high thou me. Oh rock of aes hide thou me. No other reuge have I but thee. and life's dark veil I wonder far from thee. Then I cry, oh rock of aesence, high thou me. Oh rock of ages. Oh rock of aes high thou me. No other reuge have I but thee. When life's dark may I wonder far far from thee. Then I cry, oh rock of aes, high thou me. Amen. Let's go to the key of G number 119, please. I'm a new creation. I'm a brand new man. Old things are passed away. I've been born again. More than a coner. That's what I am. I'm a new creation. I'm a brand new man. Hallelujah. He redneed me. Oh, halleluah.

It's the life behind the name that makes the proud heart humble. It was God who devised a plan that in all things like a man he would live. so he could give to us the life behind the name. Oh, it's the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble. It's the life behind the name that makes the proud heart humble.

Just ask that you'd prepare every heart, Father, to receive and to live the word of God, Lord Jesus. Ask that you'd raise us to a higher plane, Father. And may we say as those who walked to Emmas, Father, that wasn't it good to walk and talk with him along the way. Father, we love you and we thank you, Lord, in the precious name of Jesus Christ.

And someday on thee I'll stand [Music] there. My hope shall be eternal. Bula land [Music] sweet land. Oh, I'm looking now across the river to where my faith will end inside.

Praise the Lord. finally got it turned on before I got here. Live and learn. God bless every one of you tonight. I I really enjoy that song. Enjoyed the song service. Praise the Lord. We uh I thought it was going to be Brother David here tonight, but he's shaking his head going. Not this time. This David. Well, praise the Lord. Here we are. It's good to be back in the house of the Lord. We're going to be gone for a little bit. will be couple services in Canada and then back to Oregon and then probably back east or at least y'all have a blessed day state. And if you ever been to Texas, you'd understand that language. So, God bless each and every one of you tonight. Uh remember my wife too, she was uh still having a you know, she it's a cycle that she kind of goes through with the food. So just remember her if we could stand for a moment and uh approach the word of the Lord. And before we do that, let's just pray. Gracious heavenly father. I love you tonight. I thank you and I praise you Lord for the word of God. For thou art the word of God. And so we're asking that you would take it Lord from the rema and the typewritten words from the pages Lord and take it into the realms of the spiritual Lord. Take it into a place toward that we can step into it as we would say take a journey Lord. Let us take the journey tonight into the Holy Ghost and bring us into the presence the divine presence of thee Lord the son of God the word of God. And may it be instruction to us. May it be those things that we have need of to make this daily walk that we've been assigned to. In Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Remember those that aren't able to be here this evening and those who desire and for those out online. God bless you. Father we pray for them in Jesus name. Amen. Let's turn first to Colossians uh chapter 1. This is be kind of a a little bit of a continuation of of last time right before we finished we got a little talking about the translation and uh there's so much in scripture about that in I guess you could say hidden places but in uh Colossians first chapter and we know right off the bat as we were if we were to go to ch Colossians chapter 2 that we're in a battle. In fact, I'll just read that as we get started. Uh he says, "For I would that ye knew what a great conflict I have for you and for them at Leodysia and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh." We are in a conflict. That's pretty It's Yeah. He said, "You're in a conflict." And he's saying that to the Colossians. and he's saying that Leodysia, you better be paying attention to this because we're in a battle. So, with that in mind, then we go back to chapter one and let's look a little bit about what this battle is about. And I guess we'll start there about chapter verse 11. strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness, giving thanks unto the Father, who hath made us to be ma partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light, who hath delivered us, that's past tense, from the power of darkness, and hath past tense, translated us into the kingdom of his dear son, in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sin. Now, before we're seated, let's turn one other place, and that would be Revelations 12 and begin to see the importance as it was of translation and how we get into it. See, is that the right one? 12 verse 12 and verse 10. Well, we'll start there at verse 9. And the great dragon was cast out, and that old serpent called the devil and Satan, which deceived the whole world, he was cast out into the earth, and the angels were cast out with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, "Now is come salvation and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ. For the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night." And they overcame him by the blood of the lamb, and by the word of their testimony, and they loved not their lives unto the death. Gracious heavenly father, please Lord take this vessel, take these vessels and speak Lord heart to heart from your heart to theirs in Jesus name. Amen. Please be seated as we look at this and we think about translated or being trans uh and we covered it many times. It's simply to tr it comes from the word transfer to move from one place to another and that one place to another and how that that in the moving there's things that can move with it as the water we talked about last time I just transferred the position of the water. Well, it wasn't just the water. That's the part you saw and maybe heard with if it was if I had it close enough to the mic. But there's more that came with that in that transferring process in that water for human beings is life. And when we drink the water, we not don't get just the movement of the water from place to place or from bottle to mouth and mouth to the the other parts, but what comes with it is the life that's in the water. And then that life becomes our lives. As we absorb that water, that water becomes part of us and we become part of it. And so the life that's in the water begins to transmit from the water into us. And so we begin to live the life of the water. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now Jesus said this word is water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is water. And I believe it was the woman at the well where she went to the well and he said, "Hey, if you knew who you were talking to, I would give you water that you never thirst again." So we realize that the scriptures, the the the God of heaven, the I am that poured himself out through Jesus Christ has the ability to give life from the water of the word. And as we looked there in Revelations, excuse me, it said there that they overcame him, that's the devil by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony. So they have had a testimony that overcame the the devil. So we we mentioned that scripture there in Colossians and how that we are in a battle and this battle because we are living in the age of Leodysia. We're not Leodysians. No, we're here but not by choice perhaps. But we're here because somebody has to have a testimony that overcomes the devil during the period of this age. This age in as we know from the church ages is called the age of people's rights. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if everybody we talk about you know they talk about well we have rights to do this we have rights to do that and uh it just gets crazy really because everybody thinks they have the right to to do something or and what we forget is that God has rights. God has a right because he is righteousness himself &gt;&gt; and he pours that righteousness. It says that we become talking about the the church of the living God or the br we call it the bride of Christ. We become the very righteousness of God &gt;&gt; because the righteousness of God just as I I'm going to take another drink because my throat's a little scratchy. that life that now came into me as we drink from the word of God. A and it says that he is the righteous one. And from the righteous one, as we drink of him, he is called the word of God. As we drink of the word of God, we become the literal righteousness of Jesus Christ to display God's rights. God's rights because it's, you know, we, you know, who he hath called, he hath chosen, and how that we're not going to go into predestination, those things tonight, but that by his choosing, he has the right to choose. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And as we read uh in in another place, it talks, you know, well, what if God chose Pharaoh just to show his glory? &gt;&gt; That was God's rights. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we think about this, when he made mankind all the way back to the before the garden, before the garden, because it was when it said he created man in his image, and we know created he male and female created he them. What was the image of God? Well, he's God. And that image, part of that image is the the ability to choose. &gt;&gt; God chose &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; He knew who he was and who would display him. And he chose &gt;&gt; he chose to make Adam. He didn't make Barney or Bill or somebody else. He made Adam. And Adam was the divine nature of God being expressed. And he made him in the form as we think of it, male and female. And that male and female was, we know, type and shadow of Christ and the church or Christ and the bride. &gt;&gt; And how that from that choosing that right to choose, he put that in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have the right to choose because God said so because we're made in his image and he retained the right to choose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we have a right to speak to speak a testimony to live up to a a standard whatever standard each one of us has here tonight or out there on the line. whatever whatever your standard is, you have the right to choose that because God put that choice in us. And so here when he starts to talk there about translated into the kingdom back I'm back in Colossians fir first chapter said giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meet partakers of the inheritance of the sight of the saints in light. We are to be partakers of the inheritance. What inheritance? What inheritance is he talking about? Well, we look back at the types and shadows of Israel and how that they were given an inheritance. It went all the way back to Abraham who with uh when God came to Abraham and he told him, you know, your children are going to go down for 400 years and after that time I'll bring them out. another place he said, "I'll bring them out and take them in." That was the inheritance. And we understand that in this age that that was an inheritance for them as a natural covenant, a natural inheritance, but it types and shadows the supernatural inheritance of the gentile bride. &gt;&gt; That speaks of us. And we look at how when he spoke that a and how that that was the promise, that was the inheritance that God spoke to Abraham for your children. That was their inheritance. That's what they were to receive. And how from that inheritance they they we took them out of Egypt. God said, "I'll bring them out and I'll take them in." And they came out of Egypt. What they did not understand that being under the anointing of Moses because God had told Moses, "You go down and be a god to those people." What a choice. You go down and be a god to those people. Whatever you say, Moses, I'll back you up. &gt;&gt; Whatever you say, Moses, I'll back you up, bride of Christ. Whatever you say, he said, you can have it &gt;&gt; if thou can't believe. &gt;&gt; So, and and here it is. They come out of the kingdom. They go into, you know, they had all kinds of problems. They're people just like you and I. You have any problems tonight? Well, you can't be a problem because that word's not in the book. And if you're the word, you're not the problem. &gt;&gt; It's got to be something from out there, right? &gt;&gt; It's It's really not there. So you're not the problem. And so but when they got out and they got in that land and they went through trial after trial and day by day they walked what they didn't understand by that being under the anointing of that prophet messenger for that day as he spoke the word of God and they received it. Every step they took, they became the fulfillment of the promise. Even when they, you know, they, hey, you know, no straw for the bricks, all those things didn't matter because the anointing was there to transform them &gt;&gt; or translate, move them from slavery into freedom. Amen. &gt;&gt; And not just slavery to freedom, but from freedom into the next level, which was a wilderness experience, but it was the anointing of God on them that goes back to Abraham that said, I'll bring them out. And they became the literal fulfillment of that scripture. I'll bring them out. They were the fulfillment of it. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the Egyptians. It wasn't somebody else. It was them because the promise of God had anointed them to become that promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are anointed to become a promise of God. You shall not all die. You shall be changed &gt;&gt; you're anointed to bring that promise &gt;&gt; because God said so. &gt;&gt; Well, we know they got in the wilderness. They got in trouble and it came down to a certain place and I guess it was Kadesh Barnea and spies went in, spies came back and when the people asked him, well, how was it? Oh, it's a good land. Oh, really? But then they said, yeah, but we can't have it. We can't have it. What do you mean? Well, there's giants in the land. Oh, it's terrible. Giants. We didn't expect this. Yeah, we're like grasshoppers. How many grasshoppers do we have here tonight? Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother. Who said that? God didn't call them grasshoppers. You're not grasshoppers, people. You're sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; But somebody, they believed it. And when they believed it, you know, somebody said, "Oh, that we had died in the wilderness. Oh, that." And they went on with their negative confession. And when they did that, what happened? They because they were under a spoken word experience becoming the fulfillment of the promise, they spoke themselves out. God didn't cast them out. &gt;&gt; That's right. They spoke themselves out. &gt;&gt; They spoke themselves out of the promise because they didn't realize it was only Joshua and Caleb who came back. They tried to steal them and they say, "No, no, no. Watch Joshua and Caleb." They said, "Let us go up at once. God hath, we just read it, hath translated." &gt;&gt; That's right. He's saying he's that kingdom is already ours &gt;&gt; because from his heart he wasn't there yet &gt;&gt; and yet down here he was already there. It was already his &gt;&gt; and he's going to claim it and walk into it. &gt;&gt; Well, it took 40 years to get rid of all the unbelief. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when the day came and Joshua walked to that river and they put the, you know, laid the stones and the water rolled back, when he stepped through that on that dry land and got on the other side, he could have turned around and said, "This day, that promise to Abraham is fulfilled." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One day, today, you might as well claim it today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. this day that these scriptures we're talking about bride and translation are fulfilled in me. &gt;&gt; That's right. Exactly. &gt;&gt; In me. In you. &gt;&gt; It's in you. &gt;&gt; We look at the outside world. It's falling apart, friends. &gt;&gt; Earthquakes and this and that and all the stuff going on. It's crazy. But in you, &gt;&gt; he said there, let's read it again. who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his son. Where have we been translated into the kingdom? &gt;&gt; We have been translated. We have been moved from &gt;&gt; this kingdom what they call Leodysia or Leoia, however you pronounce that. They have we have been moved from that kingdom into another kingdom. And that kingdom originates and exists within you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Within me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the kingdom of God. And I I forgot I had that scripture. It's Luke 17:21 when they're talking about Let's read it. It says that uh where's that? Okay. And when the Pharisees and when he was demanded of the Pharisees, they weren't even nice about it. When the when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation." You can't see it. Not on the outside. Comes without observation. Neither shall they say, "Lo here, lo there." For behold, the kingdom of God is within you. &gt;&gt; You look at this guy. Okay. Yeah, I get scratchy places on my arms. I had to go get a haircut. You know, all the things we go through in this life, that's not what you're looking at. We are looking at the promise of God. Even as Joshua and Caleb looked all the way back, I brought you out. I'll take you in. &gt;&gt; Even though they had to what? They had to fight for it. &gt;&gt; They had to fight for every inch of it. &gt;&gt; Did they make mistakes? Yeah, you can read them. But and I always laugh. Maybe I shouldn't laugh, but I I chuckle because you know they were so commanded. Don't make any covenants. What's the first thing they did? Before they even got there, they made a covenant with Rahab. Big no. And even when they go back and tell Joshua, he says they he they told what befell them, what circumstance caused them to make a covenant when they weren't supposed to do that. Or then there was the I believe it's the Gibeonites not so long after. And here, you know, Israel, they're they're feeling sorry for these guys because they have the the old clothes, the moldy bread, all that. And then, well, okay, we'll make a covenant with you. &gt;&gt; H hello, &gt;&gt; we make mistakes. &gt;&gt; We all make what look like mistakes, but if we give those things back to God, &gt;&gt; that's it. &gt;&gt; What happened? &gt;&gt; That's right. with the Gibeonites. God actually raised up the Gibeonites because they were a strong tribe. And when the other tribes all saw that, oh, the Gibeonites, they made a covenant with Israel. Let's go kill the Gibeonites. Well, the Gibeonites, they got a nice protector. They have Israel and the God of Israel. God said, "I raised this up so that I could destroy those kingdoms all at one time. So you don't have to fight each one individually." H So their mistake was the power and the grace of God, although it's still a thorn in their flesh to this day. But see, we are being translated. We are being moved. &gt;&gt; Amen. from one place and the life &gt;&gt; that's in the water of God's word. &gt;&gt; The life is being translated into us. You are receiving the life of translation right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you are receiving the word of God, whoever you are, wherever you are, you are, as we read last week, we have the mind of Christ. As we've been around a lot of different languages, and I try to learn as much of I can as I can anywhere I go because I have found out that if you can learn even a little bit of the language, it gives you kind of an open door to how they think. &gt;&gt; Yeah. how people think Spanish they it's similar in a lot of ways to English but they reverse everything they reverse it you know when I speak and people ask me because I know a whole lot of Spanish words I've been there a lot and but when I try to speak it they just laugh and shake their heads they go brother we know what you're saying but that's not Spanish that's and I call it spanglish Yeah, I know it's spanglish, but that's because I don't reverse the stuff. Well, when we're in Japan, now that's a holy that's a whole different kind of thing cuz it's not only at least English and Spanish, you know, kind of the same words, same alphabet. No, no, not over there. And it's not even the same side of your brain, right? &gt;&gt; Left brain, right brain. And it's they say it's one of the hardest languages to to learn because you got to switch your entire way of thinking. They claim that you know artists and and and musicians have a little better chance because they use that creative side of the brain. Their whole language is that way. And the translation I know in Malagasi we the translations sometimes I might say you know a sentence you know God said let's go here. Well sometimes they can do that in one word &gt;&gt; and the next time I'm thinking oh that was easy. So you say something simple and it goes on and on and on. And I'll ask people, did he say the right the same? Oh, yeah. He said the same thing. But it's how you approach the language. I'm sure I see the sister back there smiling. The sisters and you know for Russian, Ukrainian, all those different things to really understand the people and to understand what's going on. If you can get into the language and get into the spirit of the language, then what happens? You can begin to communicate. I call it hearttoheart &gt;&gt; because just knowing the language doesn't always tell you the heart of the people. But God so loved the world, he gave his only begotten son. And that son sends forth the Holy Spirit so that we not only have the rema or the written word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we can step into the spirit of God to understand the heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; To take on the life of Jesus Christ. to not only move the water from place to place, but to receive the water and the life that's in it. And we talked again a little bit last week about translation and what how that you can learn, you know, like a word at a time or like I which is kind of the way I have learned Spanish and I almost got well, I wouldn't say conversational in French. Whoever made French, they say it like a joke. They said whoever was writing out that language, they were getting paid by the letter and that's why they have all those extra letters. And you know, I won't fight with them, but I How do you get D and it's D E Aux? I don't know. But it's just the nature of the language. And we need to step into the nature of Jesus Christ by way of receiving the life of Christ, the life that's in the water. So, and as we do that, we look back again to Israel. How did they do that? They did it one step at a time. The first day or whatever, you know, day, weeks, however long it took. I don't know the exact time period, but when Moses went in, oh, they were all excited. Oh, we're going to be delivered. And then Pharaoh took away the the straw. All of a sudden, the walk got a little tougher. And they wanted to even stone Moses. and how that but every day after every plague all those things however long it took every day they got closer and closer and became the fulfillment of the promise every day you walk with Jesus Christ every time we pick up a Bible we pray in the name of Jesus Christ we get in the spirit through song through worship through praise through thanksgiving All those things take us one more step, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; into the promise. And that promise or those promises, however you want to look at it, they're here. We look at it, I look at it sometimes as, well, what do you mean they're here? Because you look, we look around and we see all the darkness. And it says we got delivered from the darkness. But we as we look at those things, it's not the darkness that we're supposed to be concerned about because there is a scripture that actually said God is revealed in the thick thick darkness. You remember which one that is, brother? So God can even be revealed or reveal himself in the darkness. &gt;&gt; God reveals himself. Well, why is that? Because he's the light. He is the light. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And where it doesn't matter how dark it is. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He can be. He is revealed because darkness has no part of him. &gt;&gt; And so he is revealed. And how how do these things happen? Let's look at Isaiah 28. Um we're doing okay. and how we're entering into things far quicker and far greater than I believe sometimes I understand as Christians. Do we really understand this? In Isaiah 28, we might have mentioned this last week and it starts out there in Isaiah 28:5. In that day the Lord shall the Lord of hosts be a crown of glory and for a diadem of beauty unto the residue of his people. In that day shall the Lord of hosts. Pay attention when you see it says well the Lord did this, the Lord did that and how it announces it. We realize with Abraham at the time of the sacrifice, God appeared in a certain form and it was I believe Jehovah Gyra and and which is God our provider. But it also means the God who sees. important because when Abraham was about to slay that child, the God who sees looked all the way into the bottom of Abraham's heart and said, "You don't have to kill him because I see your heart, Abraham. I see that you would do it regardless." And when he saw, then what? He appears as a ram where behind him. So here is Abraham. I want you to think about this. Here's Abraham and ready to do this. And God, oh, you don't have to do it, Abraham. Ah, hallelujah. Praise the Lord. He saw that Abraham because you read about it in the book of Romans said Abraham believed that if he killed him, he was able to raise him up because God gave him to him as one from the dead. So when God saw that Abraham recognized him as a resurrection, he knew that the God God saw that Abraham believed him as the resurrection. I am the resurrection and the life. Who's the resurrection? The I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am the resurrection. And when he saw that Abraham believed him in that form, he said, "You don't have to kill him." And then he appears behind him as a ram caught in the brush. Behind him, how did Abraham know it was there? Have not we seen in this last I'll say this last age that a prophet of God turned his back on the audience &gt;&gt; and said, "Hey, you over here, Mrs. So and so in blue dress. you over here, mister. What was he showing us? It was the same God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was with Abraham. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is here tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he sees and he knows. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He knows what we believe. He knows us personally. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And if we believe him as the resurrection and we begin to testify, I said there the Lord of hosts. Do you know what the Lord of hosts actually is? It's God coming with all of his saints. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what day is he talking about right now? &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Because because God is on the scene with his saints, with his host, &gt;&gt; with his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because as we walk day by day, we are walking into the fullness &gt;&gt; of the promise. &gt;&gt; It's already here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's already within you. The full promise lies within us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The kingdom, the entirety of the kingdom lays within you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It lays within us. And the kingdom, that's another word. If you if we think about it in the old times, when we talk about the kingdom of God, it's not just the the geography of the kingdom. It's everything in the kingdom belongs to the king. You look at Ahazerus and and some of those other prophets, they had the right if some they didn't like somebody, they just kill them because they were his property. You are God's property. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we have given ourselves to Jesus Christ and became members as it were of the kingdom, we are his property. You say, "Whoa, wow. That's kind of H. But there's benefits to that &gt;&gt; because he's the God who heals. &gt;&gt; He is the God who supplies your needs, our needs. He is the God who fights our battles. &gt;&gt; We're in a battle, but we're not the ones that have to fight it. &gt;&gt; He does. Just like Israel fought for the Gibeonites. &gt;&gt; He becomes our everything. That's right. &gt;&gt; And so in the day of the Lord of hosts, which is God coming with his and if you have a doubt, you know, he's really here with all of his saints. Have you not read in Hebrews chapter 12, we are encompassed about by such a great cloud of witnesses? I'll flip back there. Keep your finger in Isaiah, but let's read it real quick. Hebrews chapter 12 starts out, "Wherefore, seeing we also are accompassed about with some great cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight of sin which doth easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that set before us. Looking where?" unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, despised the shame, and is sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. We are compassed. We are That's a now word. &gt;&gt; That's a right now word. And he said, "They're here. Don't see them, but they're here." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not because whether I see them or not doesn't matter. That's right. &gt;&gt; They're here because God said they are. &gt;&gt; And the host of heaven is here. Remember when Elijah and Ghesa and they were surrounded and it looked terrible. I mean, his servants going, "Oh, master, what are we going to do? Lord open his eyes." And when they looked outside, there was a greater host with them than against them. There is a greater host with you tonight &gt;&gt; than there is against you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hope this is giving you a little &gt;&gt; Okay, back to Isaiah. And the spirit, okay, cameth the residue of his people and for a spirit of judgment to him that sits in judgment and strength to them that turn the battle to the gate. So why is the Lord of hosts here? It's for a spirit of judgment. Now I know most people think they get judgment and justice confused. No. Judgment is the law spoke against everybody. No man could keep the law. Jesus Christ was the only one who could and did because he was the fulfillment of the law. &gt;&gt; Amen. And judgment is when we come before that judgment seat of Christ. We come before that judgment seat and he reviews the case. And from the message of the hour, we said, you know, he paid our price for sin at Calvary. That's why we have this cross there to represent Calvary. And that's why it's empty because he became the resurrection. But after that he comes he said and he became our lawyer. So I'll just step away from here for a minute. So okay your your penalty is already paid. You got nothing to worry about but just in case he becomes the lawyer through the Holy Ghost and begins to plead the case because the judge is up here and and so here your lawyer is that Christ becomes our lawyer. And we start to, you know, we look at the case and and and he said that he paid for every sin, for every believer from the very first one all the way through the last one. When he was on that altar of sacrifice or on that altar of uh becoming our lawyer, he covered every sin. Your honor, they didn't mean to do that. They repented. There is no sin. And so then the judgment seat becomes the greatest mercy that was ever on the face of the earth because only the judge has the right to say. Case dismissed. Absolutely. God bless you, brother. Case dismissed. And the next thing they'll say, you can leave the courtroom. get out fast. I'm going go to the story, but it cost me a lot of money because I didn't don't do what I did. So, it becomes the greatest mercy. And when people say, "Oh, no, don't you judgment. Oh, judgment." No, we're not talking about justicees means you pay for what you did. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ already paid it for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Already paid it. Paid it and then wrestled before the judgment seat. And then he stepped around and becomes the judge &gt;&gt; and he said, "You're done. You're finished. Get out of here." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And with that judgment, what does it give? Strength to turn the battle to the gate. &gt;&gt; Amen. What was the promise to Abraham? Abraham, thy seed shall possess the gates of its enemies. And when he becomes the judge, that's when the strength comes to where we can turn back and say, "Satan, you are a liar." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I refuse to believe. &gt;&gt; That's right. I refuse to believe &gt;&gt; whatever it is, that sickness, that bill, that that you're going to die, you're, you know, all the things. Hey, he runs that stuff constantly over us as believers trying to get to us. But what did we read from Revelations? They overcame how? &gt;&gt; By the blood of the lamb, which was the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; And what? By their testimony. Testimony of what? That's right. The testimony of believing the word of God. The testimony of believing what God said about you. What God said about me and testifying unto he's already come with his saints. I am gathered. They are gathered about us tonight. That's right. whether I see him or whether I don't doesn't matter because they're part of this kingdom. And then, you know, if you want to get into the speaking the word and and the double anointing, why is it so important for that double anointing? Because somebody has to be able to not only speak for themselves to get out of this world without death. Brother Brandham said, we have to be able to turn back and call for the generation before us. Because when he used that scripture uh the first shall be last and the last shall be first. He said what is that? He said that is those that are in the last time because we know we will know if we don't maybe right now we'll know who it is. And he said we will turn back and call for them. So the last will be the first to receive the revelation of God to get us out of here. &gt;&gt; That's right. And he said, "And we will turn to that generation who in turn will turn to the next generation to the next to the next to the next until it gets back to Paul and his group." How important was it that a prophet said, "I preached what Paul preached." &gt;&gt; And when it gets back there, the first will be the last to receive the revelation to get out of here. You're smiling, brother. You know it's the truth. Amen. Brothers, sister, we are to have an anointing so powerful. Scripture, I believe, calls it double anointing or something along that line to where we not only speak for ourselves, but we speak for the generation before us. And as that anointing rolls back through time, the last become our first and the first become the last to leave this globe. &gt;&gt; And it comes by translation. I haven't even got to that scripture yet, have I? Praise the Lord. Well, we're still doing okay. And he begins to talk. He said they aired through wine, strong drink, so forth, and they're swallowed up of wine. But then he drops down to verse nine. Whom shall he teach knowledge? Whom shall he make to understand doctrine? Them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts. Why is that important? Because we're not talking about God as El Shi on the breast. We're talking about the Lord of hosts. We're talking the people in this scripture are mighty warriors. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are warriors. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not babies anymore. You've been drawn from the breast. &gt;&gt; We Oh, I love it when, you know, God comes along and gives us a milk of the word and stuff, but that's all there for us to give us the strength to be the warriors to withstand the enemy at the gate through the spirit of judgment. And then he goes precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line. Here a little, there a little. For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people. What to whom he has said, this is the rest. What's our rest? H precept upon precept. We've given you a few tonight by the grace of God. I It's not me. It's not brother David. It's Christ. When we go into this word, I we prayed. Let's make a journey. We started into this. And it's precept. That's a precept. The saints are here. Precept upon precept. We're moving from slavery to freedom. Upon precept, from freedom into a promised land. Precept upon precept. as we learn these things, as we we become the things that we are learning, because that anointing is on us &gt;&gt; to become the fulfillment of God's word in this day and this age. Somebody has to do it. Why not me? &gt;&gt; Why not you? &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Claim it. &gt;&gt; It's mine. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Precept upon precept, line upon line. And how do we get to there? For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said, "This is the rest wherewith he may cause the weary to rest. And this is the refreshing yet they would not hear. This is the rest." Well, the stammering lips in another tongue. That refers to the Holy Ghost, but it also re refers to, have you ever stammered when you were trying to learn a new language? I do it all the time. That's why I get laughed at. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; With stammering lips. Lips that don't always understand or know how to speak. It's because I don't always know how to speak in this situation I'm in. Sometimes, you know, I try to get people to the word of God as best I can and but it doesn't always come out right. And it's because we're caught between we're caught in this, you know, what if I have precept upon precept upon precept, but I haven't got to the fourth one because it's a walk. It's a journey. It's a journey by way of the Holy Spirit upon us and within us into the word of God, into the mind of Christ. We're making this journey, friends. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The fulfillment of the promise lies within us. &gt;&gt; That's right. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; It's already there. The kingdom is within you. Two scriptures and then we'll close. Lord, &gt;&gt; and it comes line upon line, precept upon precept. Maybe we come back to that sometime, but not tonight. Let's look at Psalms and it's uh Psalms 21. And how perfect the word of God is. I I love it. I just I don't spend enough time in it. I as much as I want, but when you when God opens something up, it just amazes me. I stand I tell people sometimes, I stand amazed. As I go, wow. Psalms 21:es 1 and 2. And the king shall joy in thy strength, O Lord, and in thy salvation. How greatly shall he rejoice. Do you know the word rapture that we use so much that isn't in the Bible &gt;&gt; was my son Jonathan was re you know studied this out it actually means extreme or complete joy. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; So the king shall joy in who? And thy strength the strength of the I am God. We our joy our what we call rapture is from the strength of God. Oh Lord, and in thy salvation, how greatly shall he rejoice. &gt;&gt; Now, why? Who's the king? We know Jesus Christ is the king. In fact, he's the king of kings. But look at the next verse. Thou hast given him his heart's desire and hast not withholden or withheld the request of his lips. So his joy and his strength. There's another scripture I believe it's not Habacook but it says the joy of the Lord is our strength and the joy of the Lord you know the is the strength and it's God's strength and it brings salvation in which we can rejoice in it comes back to this and said because thou hast given him his heart's desire and didn't withhold the request of his lips and it says sila you know what sila means it's a musical interlude or time for the music to unfold. Music is also a type of prophecy. When you sing these songs, you're prophesying. That's why sometimes I'll hear a song that says, you know, that Jesus is way off in the future. I don't sing it that way. So, if you hear me singing weird, it's okay. I'm just singing it, Lord, you're here &gt;&gt; because that's what the word says. &gt;&gt; He's here. They're here. And so, but it says he he didn't withhold his lips, but in that space of time for the music or for the prophecies to unfold. Let's look at we'll close with this. John the 17th chapter. What re caused him to rejoice? What caused him this rejoicing? What caused him this strength, this joy? And we go to John 17. You know, last time we read John 14 and he said, "I in you, you in me." And so on, but in John 17, I love this because he kind of repeats it in a way. I'll go ahead and start verse 20. Neither pray I these for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through thy through their word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Through their word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They believe on me through their word. How did they get out of there? By the blood and by their testimony. Okay, I'm glad I read that. that they may all be one, as thou art in me, and I in thee, and they also be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me, and that the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them, and they may be one, even as we are one, I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfect. That's complete. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Perfect and complete in one. and that the world may know that thou has sent me and hast loved them. That the world might know that you sent me and that you love them. I'm pointing at every one of you. &gt;&gt; He loves you. &gt;&gt; He loves you. He loves me. And then watch this scripture. Well, this is the one I was going to thinking I' I'd finish with. Father, I will I will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me. For thou lovest me before the foundation of the world. Father, I will. It's the will of the father, the I am that we be given to Jesus Christ as a bride, that where that they be with me, that where I am, they may behold my glory which thou hast given me because you loved me from the foundation of the world. And God's love for Jesus Christ is transmitted into us. And we by our testimony become the love of God in Jesus Christ to a dying world. &gt;&gt; You are the love affair with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are the love of God being displayed in this world. You are the joy of the Lord because God granted the king, his word, his desire, his will that we be with him where he is before the foundation of the world. And then there verse 26. And I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it. and the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's God's love through Jesus Christ transmitted to us as we drink the water precept upon precept. Just keep walking and keep drinking because God will and has given granted the king his desire and it's his desire that we be with him. God bless you. Let's stand. Gracious heavenly father, I love you tonight. I thank you. Give you praise, honor, and glory. Lord Jesus, I want to say that with more sincerity. Jesus, I love you. I love you. I love your people, God. And I know that these that are here tonight and some of those out there on the line, they love you, too. And Lord, those other generations before us as we speak, may they maybe they're here tonight. We look at as a small group. This could be a stadium here tonight listening to the declaration of your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As we call your word on this scene tonight, Lord, touch for healing. Touch for to overcome grief. Touch to whatever it might be tonight that they have need of. Brother spoke and said he's, you know, his job's been driving him crazy. Lord, you can turn that around in a heartbeat. We could go on and on with how many things you've done for us. God, I love you. I thank you as we give you this service in the mighty name of Jesus Christ for your honor and glory. Amen. I in them that where I am, you might be also. Praise the Lord. There she is. You know that I bless your name. You know that song? I I've been thinking about that and I even wrote it down. There's another scripture in Proverbs that I like that says, "A divine sentence is in the lips of a king." It's the divine sentence is you never did it. &gt;&gt; Get out of the courtroom. And where is it? It's in the lips of the king. Right now, you're his lips. &gt;&gt; It's your testimony, my testimony, and the blood of Jesus Christ. Go ahead, sister. You know, you don't know. [Music] I bless his name, you know. I bless his name. I bless his name. [Music] I give him all under give him praise the light. [Music] There we go. I bless your name. I bless your name. Praise the Lord. Stop for just a second. There's another song. I will bless the the Lord at all times. His praise shall be continually in my heart or in my mouth. Uh, any of you ever been to a football game? When somebody makes a touchdown, what's do people do? Do they go, "Praise the Lord. He made a touchdown." No, no, no. Hallelujah. He made a touchdown. Let's speed it up a little, sister. Don't Not your fault. Okay. Some midnight hour. The light give you life. Burn in your mind. Reach out and pray. defy those chains and they will fall in Jesus name.
