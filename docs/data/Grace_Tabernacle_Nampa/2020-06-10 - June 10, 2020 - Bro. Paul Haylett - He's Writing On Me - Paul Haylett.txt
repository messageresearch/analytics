many Saints around the world they are going through the same struggles we are through this corner virus financial issues and everything we just want to lift them up in prayer let's not forget them so buddy Chris a few Tony let's bow our heads Heavenly Father love Jesus who will bring these needs to you tonight Lord knowing that father we could never remember Lord every single one Lord Jesus or father but Lord you knew what they were before they were even spoken or Jesus father you just you love hearing your children asked you Lord Jesus for their for your help or for God that brings out the attributes of a father Lord it bring out brings out the attributes that you have Lord as a healer Lord Jesus Lord and father it's your desire Lord Jesus to hear these needs brought before you Lord each one or I commit them into your hands Lord Jesus don't remember what they were Father or the names look but you know what they are I pray Lord let my hand upon him Lord Jesus and ask that you would come down in a special way father meet these needs as you know that you will Lord for it is your promise Lord we ask that you would speak to our hearts tonight Lord we didn't come to play Church we came to hear from you Lord Jesus and father we desire Lord that your Holy Spirit would anoint the words of our pastor tonight father they would come across the pulpit Lord lift your father Lord with the catalyst of the Holy Spirit Lord Jesus to bring within our hearts a change or to bring within our hearts a greater inspiration Lord a greater revelation of your word father without your spirit they are just words but lord your spirit giveth life or Jesus and father we just committed into your hands now the remainder of the service Lord we love you Lord Jesus first and foremost Lord and we thank you O God for your grace in our lives and for placing us here in this hour we commit ourselves into your hands and Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated [Music] those that are tuning in this morning one or this evening we just want to say God bless you it's good to have you with us joining us in service God just be with you in a special way amen I find the hardest part of song services to get a song for the minister when they can opt and so I was just meditating on that and song just came I guess a king to me as I keep listening for a different sound so let's sing that number it's actually triple eight if you want to put that up [Music] we hear about the war see famine in the land there's questions in the children's eyes trouble in the East again whole world is shaking no sure place to stand and mournful sounds are heard throughout the land but I keep listening for a different sound found on the city back God's are coming down Wow the bride is with the crew I keep listening hi keep listening hi keep listening for a difference I remember the preacher say son it shall come to pass they were come a generation that will be the line I can't believe I'm standing here seeing me in a tire and the preachers voice it's Hector with him pipeline but I keep listening for a different flower the sound of the city bad drops are coming down the sound of the bride in United with the girl I keep listening I keep listening I keep listening for a different [Music] where list it for stop it's the sound the city badge on salt coming down it's the sound of the bride being inside it with the roof all the sounds of the chorus singing glory to the lamb kids I keep listening I keep listening I keep listening for a different [Music] lift it [Music] it's the sound of glory I listen I listen I keep listening for a difference [Music] you know the prophet of God brings out from the Word of God and brings it to clarity that only the redeemed only the bride of Jesus Christ can hear that sound Amen it's not the whole world going to hear that sound it's going to be that bride Amen aren't you glad that God included us in that number to hear that voice that declared what was coming in our day a man and made it so real so alive with such clarity amen just how beautiful such clarity hallelujah amen you know I just want to bring greetings from the saints in Greeley Colorado their governor put them back on lockdown so they are having just online services just as we was and then brother ezq is having a little bit of a health issue we want to remember him in prayer and his doctor wanted him to stay away from even his own family just him and his wife and so even his own children grandchildren can't can't go to Grandpa's house or mom and dad's house and so we broke the rules we shook hands over the fence and stood a few feet away from each other and talked and his his son Christian even though brother Zeke you speak some English I think good enough English but his son Christian interpreted for us and we had our picture taken together sure it looks interesting with us both leaning over the fence from each side but it was lovely and and the Saints there just send their greetings and their love and appreciation to you here so that was a beautiful time that we had we got to go on Sunday there and eat with them have a little barbecue in the backyard and just a lovely timing so it's beautiful now I know on the on the boise church that's in Nampa there's been some news or whatever from brother Prashant sister Aakansha and a lovely report that sister V me in the hospital in for the ICU and the doctors not having much hope but then she's back home she got sick again but God delivered her from that again and I I tried finding the quote sister Jerry and I was listening to a message the other day and I tried going back out finding that quote and I should have asked sister Jerry because she has a way of remembering where they were at but I just remember the prophet of God saying how that God took his sword and just went right down into the very depths what Satan was and just cut him off amen now if it doesn't come up exactly that way amen please forgive me but that's what the word did Amen sharper than a two-edged sword just right down into the very midst and when I heard that I thought of sister Vee me immediately and sister Jerry and I stopped right then and there and we prayed that the power of God would go right down and cut off that enemy amen now this is not just for our sister Vimy it's for each and every one of us that the Word of God would go right down cut off every bit of unbelief every hindrance every power that Satan believes he can exert over us and set God's people free amen so let's just continue to remember brother pursuance sister Aakansha not only with this situation with sister Vimy but the fact that sister conscious all the way in india and brother purse want is working every day and they're separated and that alone would be a great trial amen so we just want to just lift them up in prayer amen I hear you had a wonderful service on Sunday praise the Lord amen how good our God is amen I just want to speak to you tonight on preparations of the inner man and he's if I give it a title I'd say he's writing on me amen and so as we'll look tonight you will you will obvious I believe what we've took our thought from as we turn in second Corinthians a third chapter verses one through six and then verse 17 also Amen let's just stand for the reading of the word tonight and good to be back home we had a lovely but very quick trip very exhausting trip actually we we met a young man that grew up here sister Sue would know him Jonathan barber a man he's grown up actually he's 30 I always forget 38 years old but he lives in the Greenlee area also and is a good friend with brother George brother George called him up and said that we were going to be there he contacted us and just a lovely time see a young man kind of off by himself from his family but just serving on fire for the Lord amen and and to see how God just leads and guides and opens one eyes you know it was just lovely to to have that time to to visit with him and I tell you we were in such an intense fellowship we went to there was a few restaurants that are open not sure why the difference from restaurant to restaurant but we met at the Red Lobster which was just a block from the motel we stayed in and they closed at 10:00 and we stood in the parking lot till 1:00 and it was just a lovely lovely time I mean we were it was just beautiful amen second Corinthians the third chapter verses 1 through 6 do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God immense of not man amen the Spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart and such trusts have we through Christ to God word not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life amen we'll go to verse 17 now the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty Heavenly Father we ask for your guidance tonight Lord let us only speak Lord would be pleasing to you Lord speak to the needs of your people father give us guidance and give us strength Lord each and every day Lord as we were encouraged by the Prophet father to pray for revelation may we be faithful to that encouragement and Lord just can continually asking you Lord to open our eyes further Lord I don't believe we can ever come to a time that we would say that we had enough of you Lord that we had enough of your word but Lord just continually pour yourself into us is our prayer ask for Lord every need every quest every heart's desire in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated hallelujah good to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen now as we look here in verse 1 my brother and sister I find this to be a very interesting Scripture because as it is speaking is a do we begin again to commend ourselves in other words would speak or boast of ourselves you know sometimes now look I don't want this to be misunderstood I'm just using it for reference but sometimes we'll say well I've been serving the Lord for thirty years or whatever but you know I always causes me to remember the eleventh hour' worker my brother and sister received the same paycheck so it is not as though we can boast that we have served the Lord for so long but it's simply that we serve the Lord and if there would be any boasting it would be what God has done in you and I for you and I Amen and so it's not to speak or to boast of ourselves and you know it's not really that we would bring as it were a commendation bring a letter of reference that would come and you know to say hey look we find so-and-so to have been a faithful Christian or faithful believer for X amount of time and therefore we send his reputation written in ink on a page my brother and sister that's not what God intended Amen we do not have fellowship cards Amen we are not here to to you know bring a reference that we are in good standing because of the church that we attended or what pastor that we had we as humans sometimes tend to give great emphasis to that you know if we're not careful I have this happen to me and many years ago sister Jerry and I was at some meetings back east and I think they was just made a little something going on around the message at that time and I was having a lovely conversation with a brother and he asked me he says who is your pastor and I said well brother we don't have a pastor at this time but and he turned around and walked off Mya's like it was not my fault I don't have a pastor I wanted a pastor I wanted to do I had no idea at that time I would be pastor but you know if my brother and sisters sometimes we we put certain things that we need a recommendation it'd be like well this is our pastor and people would go oh wonderful my brother and sister you know those that would be without a pastor they can still be just as true a believer still as strong a believer amen they're living in an area God can raise up a pastor in that area amen sometimes we just give up a little too easy or even sometimes I think we might set our expectation too high just as it was here not speaking on my behalf but just as it was here my brother and sister God chose to drag out of the ranks somebody that didn't have a clue what he was doing and then give him a position of authority and then caused him great great distress as he felt a pull or a calling or a burden to step into what God asked him to do and so we look at this and it's not really the right letter of recommendation that makes us a good believer it is not that someone said this person is this or this person is that that really makes him amen and you know we're not here as it is to give a letter of recommendation we don't need to go around telling people this is a good person that is a good person because you see my brother and sister what God is doing and is he is proving who is controlling our life by our very life amen so you don't need the letter of recommendation because our life becomes the letter Amen hallelujah so it's there that we don't write letters to someone else but look how he speaks to the Corinthians here he said ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men now my brother and sister I don't want to sound like I am interpreting the Word of God I don't mean it that way but look at this the people became the testimony of Paul's ministry amen so when you looked at their life those that were followers of Paul's ministry when you looked at their life their life testified of the ministry that Paul was speaking well the word that he was speaking amen so the believers life become a very testimony or the commendation my brother and sister so it's a you know if I would give example this evening our lives your life becomes the witness of Jesus Christ can we say amen to that amen because it's the very spirit or the very life of Christ that is in that causes us to be who we are right now brother Brown talks about that when he talks about the spirit of the bet how do you say his name Beethoven thank you I'm John Dillinger all of those right the spirit but that be if they had the spirit of John Dillinger you'd be shooting the place up amen if you had the spirit of Beethoven you would be riding music and playing it so we look at that and realize that when the Spirit of Christ the the Word of God is in our life amen we become the witness of Jesus Christ now the prophet of God in several places throughout the message makes a comment about how it's weak pulpits it's people who are not being what they're called to be in other words taking a very lackluster approach to the Word of God that no wonder the unbeliever doesn't see anything about Christianity to be attracted to because they can't tell any difference from them to those around them amen so there's no testimony of Jesus Christ amen so my brother and sister to bring this down into this place right here your life my life becomes a witness of the message of the hour and as I've shared many times through the years I still feel this way my brother and sister that I kind of struggle sometimes with the reference of the message because the message has become so many different things to so many different people amen and so you say message it could actually be no different than saying Baptist and there's a you know so to speak a friend of mine who's Baptist he says well he says there's Baptists in the north Baptists in the south Baptists in the East Baptists in the West and they all believe different but they are Baptists and it's happening around us so we're not here to be identified with a movement but we're here to be identified of the God of the movement amen so as you look at that you realize our life becomes a witness of Jesus Christ it becomes a witness of the message of the hour I say Lord I want to be a true witness amen now it also your life my life becomes a witness of what this church stands for Amen if we preach holiness and we are something besides holiness my brother and sister people are going to say what's wrong with them amen if we say we believe the word and we just come out and do any old thing and whatever you know people are going to question that so you know our life becomes a witness of what it stands for now you know I was just talking to my momma today and and she was joking she said well I think I might end up being a preacher after all and she's been sitting around the table with a lot of these old folks they're letting them back out gathering together they're in the building and somebody asked mom why do you always wear a dress and she says yes I do and this lady says why and mama said well because it's in the Bible and the woman was shocked she said it's in the Bible you see my brother and sister that lady needed to hear that wearing the proper clothes is in the Bible amen not just some random thing so God you know sometimes we wonder why our circumstance is what it is and why we work where we work and live where we live shop where we shop but God's gotta have a testimonial witness in that place to be able to share the word amen and the very life of Jesus Christ amen so that's why god amen sometimes you know people say I don't know you know about why this is happening to me well quit looking at the negative look at the positive and say okay Lord is there someone here now you might even be down at the welfare office but don't go down there and say woe is me I'm at the welfare office go down there and say Lord is there someone in this office that I need to witness to Amen so instead of being down there boohoo the world is treating me wrong look around and say Lord there's got to be somebody here that needs to meet you amen so we look at this and realize what the beauty of what God is doing amen so in verse 3 says for as much as you're manifestly declared to be Epistle of Christ ministered by US written not with ink now my brother and sister when you realize how many Scrolls that the Apostle Paul must have filled up as he was writing the Word of God amen he wrote and he wrote and he wrote but he's telling you now and that this you being an epistle of him it's not drawing my brother and sister you to him but he's saying it's written in our hearts it's known in read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by us if you look at that correctly all it was is Paul acknowledging that God called him to carry the word to you amen so it's exactly the day that we live in same thing repeated God ordained a man right because he's got to not break the continuity of the word amen so a man come to minister the word to us they were not to be lifted up into that elevated position and say that as it were is gone now remember many years ago just talking to an individual here recently many years ago right when brother Brown was still on the scene there was a whole movement of people saying oh brother Branham is Jesus Christ amen brother Branham rebuke that amen you know those people come to brother Branham we stayed in a motel room last night and then we had these crazy thoughts brother Branham they did that you are Jesus Christ and and brother Branham corrects them and but he says you know what the reason that happened is because the people who stayed in that room the night before believe that now my brother and sister if you don't think now I'm not going to do a war with me but if you don't think that brother Paul is is if you do think brother Paul's being just a little bit hard on some of these things that I preached on recently my brother and sister there is your proof right from the Prophet that those spirits will linger long after the people have left spirits will linger amen so if they'll linger enough in a motel room that the very next night people will be in there thinking that brother Branham was Jesus Christ my brother and sister those spirits will come and they will linger around you and I man that's why we have to be careful now I I might just have to you know kind of just be on the bad list but my brother and sister I want to show every spirit that is not pleasing to God every spirit that's not on the word everything that we can't find it in the Bible everything that we can't find continuity through the message we're gonna sweep that right out of the door hey man cuz we don't need that amen we don't need to come and come with some kind of spirit you know as those poor people all confused is he really Jesus Christ or are we confused my brother and sister now look at this now I know I'm gonna drag a little card out of our brother Christmas thought here and I really didn't realize what I was writing in my notes until kind of that was already down but my brother and sister you see right here it's here again I want to mention see this is not being done to write a letter to tell everyone as though it's a fellowship card but you see here it is that you're declared to be the Epistle of Christ but it's not written with ink amen he dese not Paul is moving beyond what he has written on the page saying there's something more than what was written on the page amen so it's there but with the Spirit of the Living God oh my brother and sister I think if we ever catch the revelation of how powerful the Spirit of God can be upon you and I we say well I'm just not worthy if God said you're worthy you are worthy hey man if God said he has poured out his grace upon you His grace is poured out upon you if he said I'm gonna give you revelation then you need to be saying lord I want more revelation hey man don't sit back and say poor me I'm just a person who makes mistakes No stand up declare what the word has said about you amen so with the Spirit of the Living God now I want to just put this footnote in there my brother and sister every move of the Holy Spirit is leaving its mark on you and I you say well it was a lovely service and the Spirit of God moved in our miss my brother and sister opened up to that so lord I want you to just leave your mark on me I don't want to just hear it walk out the door and forget it I want it written on me I want to have the very impression of the Word of God impressed upon me that it never leave amen I believe that's what an indelible marker you know that it cannot be erased did you know I thought this is just something interesting they have technology now that the police departments when they find a weapon that has been stolen and somebody has sanded the serial number off of that gun they have defaced that serial number on that gun did you know they discovered that the very impact of the printing of that serial number on that gun in the very beginning was not just on the surface I hope you get this it's not just on the surface but it changed the molecular structure of that whole piece of metal and so where they used to say this gun the serial numbers been taken from it we can't identify it now in almost every case they can take that gun and through a certain process go in there and it will literally stand that serial number back up to them because it has affected the whole molecular structure of that piece of metal now you tell me that when the Holy Ghost is moving amongst his people and we are there saying thank you lord i love you lord oh thank you I praise your Holy Name oh god we love you that is not putting an indelible mark that went all the way through the molecular structure of you as a son or daughter of God oh this is not just some little oh I felt good and walk out my brother and sister gods leaving his mark on his sons and daughters hallelujah oh look at this now every move I want to say this a can of be redundant every move of the Holy Spirit is leaving its mark on us Oh hallelujah amen what writing another book of Acts amen our brother Chris that was lovely I like that we enjoyed that another book of Acts my brother and sister but you see we don't need to put it on the written page we are not going to have my brother and sister another axe part to added or glued into the back of our Bible because in the day that we're living this word is being written on the fleshly tale of our heart the book of Acts that God is writing today is not pin upon paper not ink upon the paper but it is a spirit of the Living God writing on the hearts of sons and daughters of God the very life of Jesus Christ printing it right down into the very depth and I say my brother and sister he said the work that I have begun in you amen in other words if you would allow me to just move this a little bit what I have already written on you I will finish that writing hallelujah I'm not going to come to a place where it's an unfinished story but he will finish that story of what he is writing hallelujah so he's writing another book of Acts upon her heart I say Lord I lift my hands tonight Lord write on my heart write on me tonight hallelujah amen amen it does not being written need to be written on the page that's already been done amen the book of Acts my brother and sister is being written again and now it's being taken from the page and put on the fleshly table of the heart and we now become the Living Word of God God in you and I living out in the day that we are all the prophet of God what sister Jerry what what sermon was that where brother Brahms talking about beyond the veil and seeing unveiling of God I want to make sure I have that right listen to that sermon amen the unveiling of God it is so incredible you see my brother and sister what is happening is as we move into the presence of God its unveiling more and more and more it was not a singular unveiling but it is a continual unveiling of the Lord Jesus Christ to us amen and so the man who is still on the outside of the veil he sees it from this perspective and he cannot understand the perspective that you are seeing it from because it all depends on your position now I would give a natural type to this my brother and sister if I stand on this side of the church and I look across the church I will not be the same view that I will have if I am standing on this side of the church looking and when we stand outside the veil of God's Word and look at the word it is ink on the page oh but when we get in the spirit when we get to the place we say Lord I need you more than that very breadth of my body the very nutrition of my body I need you more than my very life the view starts to change Oh hallelujah Amen and I'll tell you my brother and sister you may not ever find a picture you might not ever find a painting you might not ever see as part of a frame of a video or movie that would tell you but each one of you could tonight say you know there's a time there's a place I've stood on say the rim of the Grand Canyon as the Sun set and I wished I had that picture but it's forever in your mind and a son or daughter of God when they have ever went beyond the Riven veil and they got that view of Jesus Christ the whole world around them might say we don't know what you're talking about we think you've gone crazy that you can't take that image that's been burnt into the mind and the heart and soul of a son or daughter of God they cannot unsee that when the word is open to you you cannot unsee that when God has said I am here in your present and you are touched by the word and he's writing on the fleshly table of your heart you can't undo that oh I say thank you Lord because otherwise the cares of this life and the things of this life would erase our you ask me it would erase what God is doing in her life but you see God marked an indelible mark that changed right down to the very fiber of our being and while Satan would do his best to erase it he can't well hallelujah thank you lord Oh amen it's being written on and lived out by the believer because you see it's not just on a table of stone which my brother and sister we could take our Bible tonight and say this would be the modern-day equivalent of the table of stone this would be a modern-day version of the written word of God our Ten Commandments is right here but it's not in stone right it's on ink and paper but he said we're not gonna write it a man with the ink upon the page we're gonna write it on your heart and you I don't know what will be in the future for us my brother and sister so many different ideas about how that there in time will come down and you know people say that net oh we're gonna all go through the tribulation everybody gives her life that way well I believe what the prophet of God taught us he's got too much example too much a Word of God showing us as it was that Joseph and his wife were gone from the myths not always these things my brother and sister I don't know what tomorrow holds but there's one thing I know if they take our message away they take our Bible away they cannot erase Christ from our heart and don't matter what they do my brother and sister Oh God give us a kind of anointing encourage it Shadrach Meshach and Abednego had give us a kind of courage that Daniel had when he said I'm gonna pray anyhow he could have just as easily closed the shutters and prayed behind the shutter but what did he do he threw the shutters open and he said I am NOT going to let them change my relationship with God why because it was engraved on his heart amen it was not something that he went to church to get it was something that was placed in him and it was written by the Spirit of the Living God hallelujah if a man had wrote it on there a man could take it away but when God writes it on there there's no man can take it away Oh hallelujah you know such trust verse four my brother and sister and such trust have we through Christ to God Word now I tell you that's what it comes down to if we don't have trust if we don't have trust we're just will backpedal Saints but when you trust God my brother and sister there's just well our flesh hmm our flesh let me drive that home our flesh amen but when he was talking about the fleshly table of our heart he wasn't talking about this flesh he was talking about that place prepared for his word amen actually speaking of the Soul hallelujah so we have a trust through Christ good to God were not that we are sufficient you know that's one of the most interesting things of humanity is that man gets a little money in the bank man gets a little influence he gets a following as it were my brother and sister and they start to feel like they are sufficient in themselves but my brother and sister we're not to think of anything of ourselves all that we are Amen every day everything about us is Christ and Christ alone hallelujah we would look just like the world amen we will act and live just like the world if Christ was not in us amen so we are not sufficient of ourselves amen but our sufficiency is of God amen will you say that with me tonight our sufficiency is of God amen who has also made us well not the sisters not the children not the laity is that what it says no he's made every single one of us a minister of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life now I remember many years ago my brother and sister and when the message first come into the valley little church and you know a lot of things happen and people would go from house to house of people they were acquainted with and they are they they spoke of them of the letter and if you believe this your serpent see people who didn't even know what serpent seed was people who didn't know what Malachi 4 was revelations 10 was right and they gave them what they called the word test and then they would come back and almost in a boastful way say well they fail my brother and sister that immunity that they created created an atmosphere that was not conducive to witness to anyone that's not what we're called to do amen we're called to live such a life that the neighbor who thinks you're a little crazy because you sisters don't cut your hair and you wear a dress they think you brothers are a little crazy because just like a thing I purchased here the other day the man's like well I'll leave them on the bill of sale I'll leave the money amount out and you can put any number you want in there because we don't have to give the government the money but the problem is if I lie on that I am a liar it's not just whether the government deserves that tax money or not my brother and sister you see if we find ourselves with a double standard it will move from one to the next to the next to the next and our life becomes a double standard and it won't be long till those around you see a double standard it won't be long before your whole life is reflective of a double standard amen so what we got to do oh you know the devil's like yeah the government doesn't deserve that but you know I told sister Geri I says well just we'll fill that right out with the correct number on there because I'm not going to let the sales tax on something keep me from the kingdom of God hallelujah my you talk about crazy but you see the temptation is there the justification so you see we are ministers of the New Testament not to go out and preach the letter of the law but letting our life you see the spirit that is in you and I amen will be lived out and be reflected or projected to mankind Oh God let it be the true light amen let it be the truth that is reflecting out the people that say I don't agree with them I think they're different but they are real amen hallelujah but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life now as we look at this my brother and sister every one of us is a minister of the gospel amen amen every single day we are ministers of the gospel and as we look at this we recognize that now as we jump down to verse 17 once again to touch on this amen look now the Lord is that spirit I got to go back and find it but I have found a lovely quote the other day and we were driving and I'm I thought I had wrote it down and I didn't but you know brother branham was talking about when Jesus body was laying in the tomb dead the Spirit of God come back to that body what is the spirit of life amen so you see right here now the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but you see we can take that Liberty my brother and sister and we can translate that if you'll just be kind to me we can take that and they'll tell you where the Spirit of the Lord is there is life amen that's the real Liberty we're looking for we're not looking as it were for liberty in the flesh to do as we want or the Liberty that you know oh that once saved always saved a Liberty to behave in a certain fashion but you see wherever the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty which means I have been liberated from the pit of hell through sin amen I have been liberated in the name of Jesus Christ from all of the debt that I could not have paid for myself I have been liberated from the boundaries that Satan would put on us you realize Satan don't care if you go to church he just don't want you to take anything home with you all right you start taking things home with you he starts getting concerned amen you know it's kind of like eating at a restaurant I've ate it a couple like this they serve such huge portions that as you're finishing up your meal they automatically bring you a little box amen because they know that they gave you more than you could take home now look I give that little example because I want to just kind of stir you a little bit amen I pray that you would pray that God would call me in this church and start serving us portions that our box is completely full amen and we walk out completely full and there was still some leftover amen let's not come and say you know what just get me a little box that's all I need to take home with me no give me a big box amen and I want the Spirit of God to fill up with the leftovers I wanted to be filled up in that box that is so big that I can barely carried out the door and when I get home and open it up again what I received already I get another taste Oh hallelujah Amen because you see where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty to take the spirit home with us Amen Donna called formal not bound to this not bound to that not bound to a ritual not bound to a deal just talking to a brother he was pretty funny because he was sharing this idea he said you know he said I was sitting in a church service and he said I was thinking to myself uh you know sometimes these song services are really really really long amen and he said he just kind of thought that to himself but he was like lord help me I just you don't want to receive so that pastor had a question-and-answer service and so then somebody turned in a question and said you know why are our song services so long and the pastor's response was because that's the way they are come on so then he went and asked the pastor himself you know kind of for an explanation and and the pastor didn't brush him off but just kind of said well you know that's just how it is a little more singing a little less singing more tonight tomorrow night more on Sunday less you see he never gave him a fixed answer why is our service as long as it is because that's the way it is some can't handle that but I'll tell you my brother and sister I'd rather say give me a bigger box I've got a lot to take home with me I've got a lot to take home with it or we could just starve you to death amen instead of two pieces of fried chicken we'll give you one instead of that one drumstick that came off a super chicken we'll give you one that come off of banty amen now we'll be able to say we fed you but you'll leave hungry you see somewhere along the line we got to decide what it is we want amen if God desires to serve a seven-course meal to you amen don't say look I'm fine after the second course amen be of good courage keep asking him bring it on I want to see what the third course in the fourth course and the fifth course and the sixth and the seventh amen because the seventh might be dessert that is so glorious that even though you know you shouldn't eat it you will anyhow amen so where the Lord is that spirit my brother and sister when the spirit moves I'm talking about the real Holy Ghost spirit I'm not talking about just getting caught up in an emotion that we're sitting in church oh this is good this is good this is good he said everything I like amen all he ruined this service by saying I didn't mind alike no we're not talking about that kind of atmosphere we're talking about the Spirit of the Lord which is the very life of Jesus Christ poured out on you and I oh my goodness if God come down here tonight and spoke to each one of us individually and said tonight I'm gonna pour my very life into you my brother and sister it would be a crazy man I was gonna say fool but we're not supposed to use those words but it'd be a crazy man never turn and walk off if God come and said I'm gonna pour my life into you but did you know my brother and sister how many times the Spirit of the Lord moves in our midst and we walked out and the prophet of God used that words it's like Peas on a dry cowhide hey man oh God don't let us be guilty of that Saints don't let us be guilty I'm not playing on your emotion I'm just telling you look at that factually look at it as reality Lord I'm gonna come and no matter how I feel I'm gonna say Lord pour it on me hallelujah I want more and more and more and more hallelujah because you see when the Spirit of the Lord is in the building it doesn't give liberty to everyone amen some people will walk out just as bound as they walked in it is to those who have opened up and received that that find liberty and then forever there is Liberty well let's see Liberty means that you can't clap real loud but you can clap Liberty means you can say Amen but just not too many times no my brother and sister Liberty is Liberty Amen it's all Oh hallelujah it's all of this word liberated for you and I tonight every bit that we need tonight has been liberated for you and I to take possession of it and respond to it and put it to work in our life Oh aren't you glad tonight hallelujah oh my I love that where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty now I want to just go right here and I want to just look at this right here Ephesians church age I didn't have a paragraph on that I guess I kind of cut that off sorry no matter how just an upright a Christian is before the public and how gracious he is to his fellow man doing not but good let him confess Christ as his Savior and acknowledge the operation the gifts of the Holy Spirit now my brother and sister many people I know some good folks that believe if you haven't spoke in tongues you don't have the Holy Ghost but this just a manifestation of the spirit amen it's not the evidence amen you got you got people that are well we won't go into that some very interestingly documented cases of Ministers video after video of them speaking in tongues from the pulpit and they've embezzled all their church's money they've done all kinds of unspeakable things but they spoke in tongues mmm see my brother and sister I wouldn't be a bit surprised somewhere on the earth there's been a bank robber that spoke in tongues the two don't go together do that spirit and tongues prophecy healing and miracle and he will be condemned in other words if you say whatever God's got for me whatever God's got for our church I want it amen people start to move you right over in the fringe of that well you know the Prophet said we don't need that anymore yeah misunderstand what he was saying he was saying that's not the evidence he didn't say it was absent from the church he didn't say that that's now been erased or scrubbed out of the life of the believer amen it's just not what we put our confidence in that once we've done that amen so is that but the minute you start to acknowledge the operation of the gifts tongues prophecy healing miracles he will be condemned the spirit of this world it's actually this last portion I really wanted to drive home the spirit of this world hates the Spirit of God and because it can't whoa thank you Lord because it can't overcome the Spirit of the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of truth dwells now you wonder why you have struggles sometimes Amen the devil knows he can't overcome the God that's in you so he's going to hammer away at you amen trying to discredit the God that's in you by discrediting you but my brother and sister the Holy Ghost amen just like the brother said it's not a matter of how many times you fall down it's a matter of how many times you get up amen so we'll make our mistakes but we don't we don't revel in that or use that as an excuse like well praise the Lord Grace will cover my mistakes my brother and sister it ought to tear our heart out when we make mistakes but I'll tell you what we ought to be standing up in process while we're repenting hey man we ought to be standing up to saying thank you Lord because I realize this is not God letting me down this is the devil attacking me but you realize he can't even get to you unless God let him know God wouldn't break the continuity of what he did to Joe right he can't make job the only guy in the Bible that he opened the hedge for otherwise it would be unfair to job amen so God's got enough confidence in you and I tonight he's got enough confidence in what he's written on the table of your heart amen that he will just say you know what Satan you you have your opportunity you can do this but you can't overcome this spirit that's in my children you can't overcome that and I encourage you tonight just go open up and let that spirit live amen give that spirit room to grow give that spirit the opportunity to just show its power in its majesty and all that God has given in that in the moving of the holy spirit and it will come because you see Satan he cannot overcome the Spirit of the Lord and if this vessel and I say the word if it's up to you to claim that Amen no one else no preacher no person whatever can say you're in or you're out it's up to you to say it's in me the life of Christ is in me the Holy Ghost is in me the Spirit of the Lord is in me amen I am a predestinated I am what the word said I will be Oh hallelujah and when you come to that place you realize he cannot destroy the vessel hallelujah that ought to have us tearing the turf up hey man cuz the devil he can howl he can holler Amen sister Bonnie I was thinking about you I was gonna make a joke kinda and then I didn't and now I'm going to Amen even if you got to have new hips and knees and elbows and arms and shoulders and whatever it is it don't matter my brother and sister this body might wear out with the word that's living on the inside is growing every single day God is still writing amen it wasn't just when we received the message it wasn't just when we got baptized it when we received the Holy Ghost and God finished riding there he's writing on the table of our heart every single day Oh God keep riding amen he's still riding on me and I say thank you Lord because it's when he moved away my brother and sister that's when you help problems hallelujah oh thank you Lord amen you see this world hates the Spirit of God because it can't overcome the Spirit of the Lord now my brother and sister it's interesting it isn't very hard to find some of these clips but you will find commentary that's being spoken in the day that we live in a news reporter back east just somewhat recent not super recent but somewhat recent made a declaration right on a TV show or a newscast thing that it's the Christians that are the problem hmm imagine that you see what Satan's doing he's making the case it's trying to make the case because Satan wants to bring it around where humanity will destroy humanity just like we saw in world war two just like we saw through the ages humanity destroy humanity believing they've destroyed the vessel oh but it's not this vessel that God's riding on amen otherwise my brother and sister when we get older our life you know starts the light starts to dim Satan would be whole I've snuffed the light but you see actually that throws Satan into a frenzy because he realizes his time to truly destroy the vessel is slipping away from him the world views it in years and time and health and condition and all these kind of things God doesn't look at it even in the same similarity oh my brother and sister isn't that beautiful what God's doing his Road on the heart and it's so indelibly embedded into us it has changed our very I've been speaking to you about DNA it's changed our very DNA that we no longer even identify in this weird I no longer even identify as it were as a human I identify myself as a son of I am NOT a human because humans are frail and they fail and they fall apart and they turn into Iraq and they disappear from the face of humanity but my brother and sisters son or daughter of God is marked in the presence of God for time and eternity to always dwell in his presence I say thank you Lord and to have that understanding of the word the prophet of God says if you weren't his in the beginning then you wouldn't be his now amen so you can't be his now if you weren't in him in the beginning and the word how showed us we are in him hallelujah how is that my brother and sister now you know I say this lightly a brother did this to me years ago he goes well brother Paul he says it must be glorious to be beYOU and I was like really he goes well yeah he said I pick up my Bible and start reading in your names all over the New Testament I was like well thank you brother I like that it made that where the prophet of God said you should be able to find yourself in the Bible made a real real to me can I can I start sharing that with you here amen but look my brother and sister every one of us every one of us by revelation what is it by what he's written on our heart identifies us in the word it's not that we could search until we found something that would what we could grasp a hold of it's reading the word knowing about behold I send you Oh hallelujah he's sending me a prophet come on you identifying that why it's because it's written on your heart it's so real to you that no matter what anyone says you you identify you identify with that what happens would come to a place we're confessing what is written about us I look through the Bible my brother and sister I see a word I know it's for you but I look through the word and I look scripture after scripture yep written for me written for me written for me written for me written for me he that are overcomers written for me amen to the saints written to me hallelujah amen it's real my brother and sister why because it's been written right here deep down inside and we can rejoice because we hear the word and it corresponds write the word calling out to the word and the word responding whoa praise the Lord amen so we can hear the word being preached and there's something inside of us that says yes that's who I am yes that's what God promised to his bride and that's me Oh hallelujah it's not hype it's nice psychology it's not some brainwashing some kind of cult thing it is something that rises up but back to the veil and then we'll close sister Amy if you'll come my brother and sister if they haven't been behind the veil they don't have a clue what you're talking about because without that behind the veil experience this is all I don't even know if we should pick on the Greeks but we use that phrase it's all Greek my brother and sister aren't you glad tonight God's been writing on your soul writing on the table of your heart amen because it's there that oh there's so many things sometimes you know but you just read the word read the message and when you tie all of that starts coming together and you start to realize my brother's sister the continuity of the word people say well we really like the quotes after 1963 really we were just listening to a tape I might be wrong I think it was like 56 54 56 the other day I don't know we were kind of tired maybe we hallucinate it but it was so real there were so many nuggets in it I was like wow so do those that want to put a time thing if it's not from this point to this point after the opening of the seals or whatever it might be we really don't put a lot of emphasis on it well I'll tell you my brother and sister brother brems ministry corrected itself you might say God dealing with him you know he thought the Whitehorse you know things like that God corrects him on that but you don't see a wholesale remodel of the message where people would like to like well you know no I'm sorry I'm sorry just like you and I might read a quote and kind of get a different conclusion you see God has continuity and that continuity comes down into the simple phrase at work I began in you I will finish o my brother and sister many a person says I started to write a book but I never finished if they felt the urge to start it why didn't they finish because the cares of life circumstance trouble but God didn't finished halfway he didn't stop I should say halfway he said the work I began in youth this revelation of the Spirit of the Lord riding on our hearts the book will be finished actually the prophet of God says it is finished it's already done amen God's just allowing it to be revealed out in the hour that we live in day by day circumstance by circumstance oh my brother and sister we're actually living out the prophecy Oh get this now just because prophecy can't be found in the written page but when God called us before the foundation of the world we become a manifestation of the spoken word see that birds out there coming to pass the power of the spoken word remember brother Branham said now God might have said let there be water it wasn't there was water an indeterminate amount of time might have went by but because that word was spoken water had to appear and we are a product manifestation of the spoken word Here I am Lord right on me right on me Lord every bit of life and every bit of overcoming power the very word of my Lord Jesus Christ write it Lord write it oh isn't it so good to serve the Lord Saints hallelujah John 18:36 I thought this might be a lovely scripture just to close with if the son therefore make you free ye shall be free indeed oh I tell you there is he was going to Calvary all that it was transpiring and everyone must have been so shook up to see our Lord Jesus they couldn't quite fathom it but I tell you my brother and sister he had to come to the place that hanging on the cross he said it is finished it is finished you know what that is I kind of miss stated that early forgive me the way I worded that but you see when you write a book some authors close with a period some authors say the end some authors let you know there's more to come that's what the Word of God has done so just think about how beautiful heaven must be this this isn't just the soul life of people say well I've sacrificed to serve the Lord oh please change that thinking start saying it's privilege I have been privileged by Almighty God to serve Him my time on earth I've been privileged to go through the trial that I'm going through I've been privileged to be filled with the Holy Ghost I've been privileged to be able to say I'm a son or a daughter of God let's get rid of the burden let's put the burden to the side that's the flesh speaking hey man don't let yourself be condemned over that but that's just a flesh seeking but it's a privilege my brother and sister that God declared it is finished what I'm going to write when I am writing everything is complete and I close with this thought as a prophet of God said everything you need to make the rapture would you give me a Liberty tonight everything you need has already been written upon you only a cheater and I am one starts a book and then goes and reads the last chapter but my brother and sister you see God's just revealing this in you and I Amen everything that's there we don't see the end but I know what the end says he says you're redeemed you're my son you're my daughter oh you know I've got something I better not mention too much these two ministers around here are rough on my thoughts amen but I tell you what my brother and sister gods made reservations and you know there's a point beyond a reservation sometimes is only merely the chance that you would have a table at a certain time say in a restaurant but there are other times that a reservation is concrete and no matter who is in front of you and who is behind you that is yours I want to leave you with this tidbit I've got a spot before the throne I don't know where it's at but it's reserved I got a spot at the marriage supper of the Lamb there'll be a little golden basta if you know what I'm talkin about that's gonna show that that seed is not just by chance that seat is reserved hallelujah and when he placed you and I in the Lamb's Book of Life it was the only reservation that we as a believer needed everything else he has taken care of amen you know I was talking with brother Jonathan there in Colorado lovely conversation and you know my brother in stir when you when you look at that and realize what God has done that we have been fixed in the economy of God no one can take our place no one Amen you're not going to walk in and say I thought no reserved Amen they've got a reservation for chains of being cast in outer darkness we've got a reservation to stand before the throne of God hallelujah I love the Lord tonight amen I just desired you know as I studied this just maybe just a little encouragement to your Saints he's still riding on us really it's finished you understand what I'm saying but he's still riding on us it's still being revealed amen the pages are being turned it's being revealed but remember now the prophet of God told it right there the spirit of this world dislikes you enough it'll try to destroy him and we can say well you know we have this little issue we have this little issue we have no no recognize that's the spirit of the world amen the spirit of life is being manifested two sons and daughters of God claim your portion claim your portion hallelujah I've been changed brother Jason will you help me amen hallelujah I enjoyed the song service tonight that was good amen that song yeah I've been to the water that's it amen hallelujah well you know what you see this song right here I could have just sang it and set down because this really covers my sermon but sometimes it's good to preach the sermon and then sing the song with it amen well hallelujah well I've been and I'm the train from the printer that I once was and Rudy is now well I bet change oh boy all my life has been rearranged what a difference it makes when the Lord has his way all my life praise all has been changed the license were assaulted we're wide as so I was bound but today I am in the darkness but now but now I see well [Music] all my line has been rearranged [Music] the Lord has lasted his presence he will wipe every tear from my [Music] red tie ain't nuttin wall beyond the sky well I be reborn my life has been rearranged when the Lord has his way for my life praise ball has been a now look at this real quick I like this song because you see it starts in verse one that they've been to the water and they've been baptized amen what is it the start of our journey right there now it's when our awakening comes to who we are and look how their song finishes when it lasts in his presence see it took us through the whole journey in just a few verses but it showed us my brother and sister we're going to start out repentance baptism everything in the middle this didn't cover everything did it that's because we can't cover everything in the middle God does that but he did reveal the beginning and he did show us the ending and if we'll just remember that we've already went past the beginning and were appointed to the ending and he'll take care of everything in the middle well win it last in his presence I stand up he will wipe every tear [Music] and I'll thank you for giving a wretch like me a new hope beyond the sky hi baby boy all my life has been refrain what a difference it makes when the Lord has his way all my life praise God has been chained hallelujah let's just stand up amen sing that little song keep me Jesus is the apple of thine eye let that be our prayer as we dismiss tonight amen I got a question as you're leaving how big a box are you going to take home with you tonight remember it's not the preacher hallelujah the chef in the kitchen has never determined your appetite hallelujah you know the problem is oh how do I say this politely I'll just put it this way I was raised in a household they didn't have a lot of money and my parents used to say children you will eat what is set before you sometimes you go to a restaurant they set an awful lot in front of you and you feel compelled to eat it all but remember with the word we can take the Spirit of the Lord home with us we can take them right into our kitchen into our living room into our bedroom amen the garage in the car wherever it is so you don't have to worry about consuming too much tonight they'll be leftovers hallelujah keep me Jesus as the apple of mine I'm beyond Earth I can't say me less I know PP Jesus eyes yapple of mine ah Oh keep me Jesus and temple of mine ah I'd be under the shadow of my way our Lord can't see me as I know Oh beeping Jesus an apple of my na Oh keep me Jesus I be under the shadow of my way and save me less I die [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music]
