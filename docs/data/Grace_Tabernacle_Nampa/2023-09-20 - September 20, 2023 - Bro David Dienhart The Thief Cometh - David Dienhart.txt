hungering more and more you say well Brother David I get filled up but you get hungry again [Music] what do you do when you go to Hungary after the word what do you satisfy it with remember what our Prophet said you're thirsty you've got put a thirst in you to thirst for him but how how uh and I speak of myself and I speak to all of us it isn't right that we would take The Thirst that he gave us for him and then go give it to something else to try to satisfy your fleshly thirst amen God put The Thirst in you to thirst for him amen let's stand together thank you brother Isaac God bless you songs the piano player God bless you hmm let's have a word of Prayer our precious Heavenly Father Our Father how grateful we are to Bow into your presence here this evening to know your present with us to not only feel it but feel it in our souls the presence of God Among Us I wonder Lord may you make every one of us much more aware of your presence Lord the world and the church and the church Among Us that believe the message I'm not speaking of bride I'm speaking of the church Lord is getting cold but I believe the bride is in a Revival and that Revival is the opening of the word and that opening of the word is Christ in US and it identifies Us in him and Lord we can't get enough of that it's in our hearts every day but yes the Satan is going to battle us and he's going to try to use the senses of our flesh these Gates of our spirit to try to war against us but I'm so glad Lord that he that is in US is greater than he that is in the world and so father we're not here by chance tonight you know what you lay to my heart here Lord and I've struggled all day knowing what to do and here just sitting in the office I brought three sermons with me Lord this day because I didn't know which one you wanted to take but I believe you are perfect in all your ways and you do things that are beyond our reasoning but we have a complete and perfect trust in thee it is sweet so sweet to trust in Jesus we're thankful for that father and we rejoice in your mercy we rejoice in the revealing of your word for we know the revealing and the hearing of the word is the evidence that we've passed from Death to life when this can be revealed in US Lord we have no fear no worry anymore because we know we're identified before the foundation of the world to be in you to be your thoughts that were real and substance and we're here in our day to express you and to manifest yourself because it is yourself and Lord we're here to manifest yourself and we're here to live your word and Lord we're here to to Lord bear your name you have a bride that's pregnanted with your life she's conceived by Your Word and Lord we have we're here to bring we're bringing forth an eternal life child and father we know that we will meet quickly with someday very soon we will meet together in the air and meet you and now Lord we are anticipating this evening's service believing that you know exactly you and I ask you to do laser surgery I'm asking you to do light surgery Lord just and pinpoint these things that should be in our hearts that we're giving away to that isn't pleasing to yourself for we know the thief is present we know that he has not come for any other purpose but to distract to whatever means he can and keep us away from putting our complete trust in your word through death the self and we just give you praise now that we're here to say he's defeated and we have a very close enemy Lord I know my enemy my greatest enemy I've got David deanheart and Lord but he's the defeated enemy and I'm rejoicing in this and now Lord open your word to us as we partake of it do as you see fit to do and close my mouth the things I shouldn't say and open it to what I should and shut my mouth when it's time to quit we commit it to you now We Trust You Lord we can't trust ourself we have no we have no ability Lord to even serve you I have no ability to preach your word I'm dependent upon you Lord with all that's in me that you will accomplish your purpose and Lord may you bless those that are are listening in I know I have a cousin in Montana Lord his birthday is tomorrow and I ask you to bless him and Lord just open your word to him and to his wife and his family For Your Glory and Honor we commit others that are listening in Lord may it may it be also an encouragement to them and a and a and Lord a correction for Lord I feel very heavy that we're here to receive correction and we praise you for this we give thanks to you for this for that your love expressed to us how do we express it back by believing what you said and conducting ourself with joy amidst the trials that you and your wisdom has allowed to come to pass we give you thanks now for every one of these things and we just want to be drawn closer to you and the only way we know is faith comes by hearing the word in Jesus Christ's name we ask you to bless your word and bless it to individual hearts and reveal them to those that have ears to hear For Your Glory in Jesus name amen turn me to Saint John 10. no I believe we'll go a little differently here let's go to Joshua 1 first Joshua chapter 1. and then I will come down to what I want to take as a read a text here and get my my title Joshua chapter 1 verse 8. this book I want to draw your attention to a book that's been opened in our day this book so what are you talking about Brother David I'm talking about the open book speaking to Joshua here he's going in to take the land this book of the law the word shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shall make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good success now he said I would that you'd be in health and prosper as your soul prospers is what prospers your soul prospers not as your money prospers your soul prospers all right I'd like to turn with me to Revelations 10. meditation is a great thing Revelations chapter 10 and you this is a very strange way that I'm bringing this service tonight and this even this message but I feel very very led to do it Satan has battled me very hard and begin in coming to what I needed to know here tonight but God's always on time so I trust that you're you're willing to receive and I trust that you've been feeding because if you don't feed on the word this word this revelation of this word is going to go right over your heads amen but I'll tell you one thing the Holy Spirit loves to feed on the word all right Revelations 10 8 and the voice excuse me wait yeah 10 8. and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth Seven Seals have been broke which is open and the book is open okay and names are written therein I won't go into all that because that's another service all right verse 9. and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me I wonder if we could ask the angel give it to me why because it was open for me amen said so I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up look at that what are we doing with it take it and eat it up do you realize that this open book is a perfect interpretation of the word it's it's the seventh Angel's third pull and it's the seven angels message and the message will bring Rapture and Grace the message Rapture is found in this message that we claim to believe it's right here in this open book so why we ought to be is doing this meditating upon it it should be our Focus every day it should be our absolute every day it should be number one every day it shouldn't be that it should be the Little Wheel in the middle of the wheel said take it and eat it up and I took the little book or excuse me and it shall make thy belly bitter yeah it's not going to be easy your flesh man is not going to be easy but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy who where where's the final voice it's a bride why is it the fight whose voice whose voice is it The bridegroom's Voice before many peoples and and that comes from a union with the bridegroom okay before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings so she's writing the trail again yeah okay amen yeah I do believe in a in a in a yeah sure do and it's happening it's never changed but this ministry this ministry will change our mortal bodies I don't say my Ministry but my Ministry if it isn't this ministry I've got the wrong Ministry I'm not feeding you on the word for the season amen but I've got if I don't do that then I need to be out of this pulpit all right so you may be seated I'd like you to turn with me to John 10 10. and we'll take my texts out of that John chapter 10. at this men of my heart this is actually the original thing that Lord laid in my heart and then I got a couple other things here I was going on and the Lord brought me right back around to it but he knows just exactly how much we need and how much I need to meditate on it and so it's been John 10 10. and let's not forget what we just read now meditate upon these things you know meditation brings him on the scene if we draw an eye to him he draws an eye to us two were walking on the road to Emmaus and they were thinking on him they were thinking on the events of the day they were thinking on on the on the death of their savior they were thinking on those things and also thinking upon things that others said he he's alive he's risen and while they were talking about him and thinking about him and he drew near amen Billy Brown said if we ought to be thinking on if we think on him more every day if we'd think upon him he'd say well Brother David I'm just too busy I've got other things to do maybe you're too busy but you can still redeem the time there's still time to redeem yeah I know we get busy but be careful in what you're busy in that's the focal point tonight is what are you busy in because it's good to be busy and things that are according to the word but if you're busy in things that aren't maybe that busyness has become an idol that you're placing before the one that ought to have first place in your life amen that's right he's not he's not a letter he's not a history he is a history he is a letter but he's a Living Word he's a Living spirit he's present today just like he was yesterday and he's in Bride form and if it hadn't to come into the bride form we would never have a complete revelation of the whole thing until he steps forth in Bride form and reveals himself through that so what men are people ought we to be in our in our desires and our motives and our objectives brother Brown said check your motives check your objectives of why you do certain things and so so he said John 10 10 says and he speak he said let me just start up a little a little bit here verse 9 I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture who what's the door he's the door what is the door of the word the word for the season is the door all right so verse 10 the thief cometh not now this thief we're speaking about is Satan this thief cometh not but for now he's called The Thief Jesus was never a thief but he comes as a thief but he's not a thief but this is the thief we're talking about okay what does this thief do he doesn't come but for to steal and to kill if he comes and you're meeting him every single day yes you are on the battleground of your mind he's going to approach you he's allowed to do that amen and God has control of what he's allowed to do but God will use him to develop character in you and I believe part of that is this service tonight all right because God's coming along now and putting his finger on some things in my life your life hey I'm no different than you are I'm also a man mistakes failures we're not talking about how you fail we're talking about being aware of of what you're doing because everything you do and the things you say and you think upon create an atmosphere an atmosphere that either can come in and walk with you or pull away I'm not talking about I'm saving you or this I'm not talking about that at all I'm talking about having him with us fellowshipping he loves fellowship and he wants to fellowship with you but many times I included we put other things in front of him but he's a discerner and he discerns what's in front of him and makes you know it tells you about it now what are we going to do when he does that if well how much do we love him we'll believe him how do I prove I believe I'll reprove my love to him by conducting myself with joy amidst trials that he allows to come to pass but we love him therefore we'll serve him if we have if we serve him outside of any other means than love we are not serving him correctly if we come to church for any other reason but Divine love we're not coming to church for the right reasons I don't say stop coming to church just come to church and ask God to fill you come to church and let him let him fill you with the word receive his love because our motive is not serving a religion our motive is not a book of rules and regulations our motive and our objective in serving God Is A Love Affair it is a love affair with him all right so he said but the thief cometh not but for to steal to kill and to destroy what's he come for what's he what's he putting in front of you your mistakes and failures for trying to get you to yield to that instead of what the word said try to say you're in bonding instead of the word saying you're free right see on and on we could go the word is the absolute the word is the ultimate the word should have first place in everything we do everything we do everything we think you see I just can't think about it we'll quit trying and put it back in the Lord's hands if he's in you he'll tell you then yield yourself and commit yourself to him die to yourself and take up your cross and follow him he can't lead you away from the word he's going to lead you to the word amen but we're letting things get in the way and they're called distractions and he's a master in distracting you and I amen anybody ever had the Lord show you those things and begin to deal with you about those things pointing him out and saying you're you're giving your time over to this when you know you're starting to do it then catch it bring the thoughts under obedience to the word because at that moment you have a choice I said well Lord just take these things from me don't let me fall into this and you know what he said you have a choice and that just that's it Lord that's it then where's my choice coming from amen I want it to be the word I want it to be for my soul I want to live what I am in my soul that's what we should live and that's what the bride will live not by feelings not by senses but what's in their soul what is in their soul if you're born again it's the word living it's the real gift it's the seed of God quickened it's Christ in you and he will rule over you if you'll let him and I know the bride will that's why I can speak these things to people that want more of him called the bride and they want to know where they come short because they're they love their husband and they want to please him isn't that right yes okay now and he's the word so how do we please him without faith it's impossible to please him faith in what faith in the word faith is a part of the word faith comes from the word amen faith is based in the word if you have your faith based in something else it's the wrong faith but faith is in the word and it comes by hearing receiving the word all right now so the key doesn't come but for the steel to kill destroy but he said I am come how many believe he has come he comes every day he's coming in you hello where's this coming today in you right in you so it's not far away we have everything we need to have all the authority we need we have the word we need we have everything we need in you there's our North Star in me in you there's where there's where my absolute is there's there's the one I trust in me all right so I am come that they might have life the thief comes to kill destroy and steal he comes to steal life kill you take your life and destroy he'll do everything he can if he can destroy that word and you're that word but he can't kill the word but he's trying to stop you from manifesting the word because the manifestation of the word is what makes him upset but that's your calling that's your position is the manifestation of the word that's what you're called to do in this hour that's what you're here for as I said he should be the Little Wheel in the middle of the wheel everything we do ought to revolve around him not him revolve around my way myself my thought my ambition my my my eye if he ever comes in and comes and lives in you listen this is now his body that really changed my way of praying not too long ago instead of saying I will do I Lord no it's he in me it's just his body I dwell in him and he dwells in me I and him and he and me and now what the scripture said I in him that's my Dwelling Place and he comes and dwells in me that's perfect Oneness amen he comes and takes up the boat and a body that he's has Sanctified and comes and lives in it but you know what he's wanting he's wanting you to take the authority he's given you and make a choice to put him as a head over it that's what the wife does she gives her husband headship amen amen and she's happy to Delight in his word because his word is her keeping power her work his word is her absolute the ultimate the amen his word is life his word is Deliverance it's joy peace happiness down the line with healing strength everything I need every day is provided for me I just have to take it accept it all right but as I said the thief cometh that's my title The Thief coming daily the thief cometh and I'm speaking of distractions oh my we could go on and on daily about distractions couldn't we but I want to focus on a certain thing that I think is a real key distraction today and I'll bring you some quotes the prophet said here it's a simple message all right tonight's a simple message but it's the simple things that go underneath some and over others father I thank you that you've hid these things in the word but you've hidden from the wise and prudent you can't figure it out but it's laying right there but you can't know it until he comes in you to reveal it without him you never would know the word knowing meaning uh uh uh knowing is more than just head knowledge it's knowing as in a marriage knowing no one else knows him like you know him amen nobody can know him like the bride knows him intimately all right so I am come to give life Jesus said that they may have life and that they may not only have it but they have it more abundantly an abundance of life but what you got to do to receive it I mean get it receive it operate with it he's given it to you he's given it to you to live by man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God do you believe this message has come from the mouth of God sir it has brother Branham isn't God but it's come from the mouth of God the sword was placed into the the lamb step forth the lion in the form of that lamb step forth and placed that sword in the hands of the seventh angel to deliver the Lamb's message and claim his claiming of the Bride in this hour in this day all the bride he claims her he's redeemed her now he comes to claim her all right so but he has come to give life and that more abundantly Hebrews chapter 2. therefore we ought to verse one therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed a brother sister this is the word of the Lord if you really believe that it would be your absolute we need to take it seriously do you realize what he has done for us and come down in our day and here in our presence today we do we really do we really know that and in communion with him like we should be see it's a revelation knowing he's here he's present he's in us he's with us he's walking with are you walking with God see then we want everything we do or think whatever we say Lord let it please you how do we please him faith in his word not whose Faith whose Faith his faith the believer is the faith of God that moves in you that substance all right his substance now but therefore we ought to give them more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard now this is things which we have heard you're sitting here tonight having heard many things having heard much on the word then we ought to give the more the more the more the more Ernest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip then there's a possibility that they can slip because we got our Focus wrong we've got our attention in the wrong place we got our what Satan has used something to distract us and we're we're we're putting that before us taking time with that when the word is slipping the word that he's given us the Deliverance the Salvation the strength is slipping away the Rapture the going home do you realize how important this day is what if you're left here tomorrow and some of us sitting right here are gone what are you going to do you're left here for tribulation you don't want to be left here because that's a purification time and that purification won't come easy amen you've missed it that ought to be enough to take heed to what he said that ought to be enough right there say Lord don't let me miss it it ought to be a desperation and the reason there isn't the desperation there should be it's a lack of love for this word that's right it ought to be it ought to be our everyday Earnest number one desire I want to be I want more of you Lord Closer to You Lord so we should take heed lest at any time we let them slip for the word spoken by Angels Messengers was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience see that word of Messengers was God's word it was steadfast we had a messenger what are we doing with it are we adding our own ideas to it and say well I don't have to agree with it that way just like that I don't believe it just that way be careful because we have a perfect interpretation of the son of man himself has given us this message and one of the proofs of the indwelling spirit is taking heed to what the prophet said did you know that that's one of the proofs of having the indwelling of the Holy Spirit living in you is that you take heed will obey what the prophet says because the prophets had the interpretation of the word for their day amen all right so we need to be seeking God every day we ought to be we ought to be seeking him we ought to be drawing close to him every day you say well I can't do that I'll tell you yes you can you can have your meditation while you're at work you can still have your mind and focus upon the word and doing the work it's on your heart it's in your thoughts don't mean you have to sit down and just do this no you can worship him every single day and say Lord I give you every moment of my time and my life and when things arise here immediately you say that's not the word that's why because you're meditating your meditation of your soul is on him amen all right you can be I you can be thinking of something else and God will come right and quick and something to you ever had that happen thinking of doing something he may be barbering somewhere and doing something telling the guy is something Quicken to you your soul comes alive amen all right I can be preaching the word up here and something will strike me amen talking to somebody else expressing something and there it is alive the word not all of us had the same jobs and the same work and we got to go to work we go to jobs but be aware the enemy is going to do everything he can to distract you away from your meditation on Christ he's going to pull you aside he's going to bring something up in your reasoning something in your memory something in your imagination something where you know you fell yesterday when you did that and you did this and and then turned something around somebody said and how do we Conor that going back to the word he said how do I do that he'll bring it to your remembrance one of the keys of the of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit one of the evidence is that it he will bring these things that I've spoken to your remembrance and teach you things to come reveal them okay reveal the word now getting back to our thought here verse 2 for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and it was and every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward you remember if you sow the wrong seed you're going to reap the wrong one even though you're still a believer but the things you say and the things you do remember if they're not right and you're doing the wrong thing you will see they're just recompense of reward as a correction how many's been corrected before my yes God corrects us doesn't he that's his love for you every see that's what the Bible said he he that correcteth chastise us it's because he loves us what if he didn't do that and let you go on and then come at the end and say well see you did this and this and this but I didn't know it Lord okay so how shall we escape verse 3 if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that hurt him so we've seen the word spoken we've seen it confirmed amen God bear also bearing them Witness both with signs and wonders with divers Miracles and the gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will amen all right I've got some things here I want to share maybe a couple of the scriptures here and I think I'll just take some of these quotes here first and I'm going to deal on a certain thing called and we would they and back then it was something the prophet called television but today it's in your hand it's on the end it's on the screen at home it's called internet the web ah now Brother David you're just nitpicking you can call it that if you want but I would take heed to it because Satan has fought tooth and nail about me saying this or somebody here someone maybe others myself God's dealt with me about this I wouldn't be bringing it to you but I think it's an issue and I think it's a great distraction and the Devil is a Master with using it and getting you to use it and it looks very innocent but it's taking your time that you could be spending with the word it's drawing your attention over on other things your thoughts your thoughts are drawn to another realm all right so we're going to speak of that Prophet said a lot about it believe it or not he he said he wasn't for it he said I'd never have one in my home what would he do with internet today he'd give the same morning he did about television he said it could have been used for a good thing but Satan got into it and Satan got into this now I'm not saying go out and trash your internet or thrash your computer that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about distraction the thief cometh not but for to steal so when he comes he's stealing something from you to get your get your attention over here on something else he comes to steal he comes to he comes to destroy amen and to kill so is full intent is to keep you out of Truth to keep you away from the word keep you away from the truth if we didn't have the blood brother sister we're all finished that's the truth we've done we've done messed up already a long time ago is that right and we've rebelled many times and did it again and again and again until God stopped it one day and I speak of myself and said listen you have a choice and it hit me right between the eyes I said Lord that's right I'm asking you to take it from me and Lord saying but it's right in your hands to do it you have a choice and don't worry the devil's tried to come anywhere a little way he can by even by curiosity why that looks like an interesting thing and you open it up and it can be just simply on the news headlines on the front of your phone well what's wrong with a little bit of news nothing necessarily but when it becomes a distraction you move into it what do you see next thing well next thing the next thing and the next thing is a whole list of things you start going through it the next thing you know you're on it for an hour or two what happened because Satan opened up a little window here and you went to that amen see how subtle he can be you know he's subtle he's a lot wiser than you are in your mental thinking you can't outsmart him I can guarantee you it takes the Holy Ghost to correct and to hold steady and I said thank God for the redeeming power of the blood because we air every day we backslide every little day and I'm not doing that and you better not be trying to do it nor I intentionally say well it doesn't matter the Lord will be okay it'll be no listen you can do anything you want but there's one thing you don't want to do and that's to displease the Lord because he's given you himself and that's the word and if you're really a married woman to him you'll want to please him amen all right says it's easy for our old what what's happened to your church you've seen so much television I'm putting television I don't think there's too much on television anymore but television has become on the internet internet's Television Internet this internet that internet TV internet news well of course I want to find out what how Maui fared out you know and want to look at that and look at that next thing but you've gone through all these other things next thing is the video you got to watch and all in that Suite how that little baby jumps around does this and plays this and does that okay that's fine but what is it doing it's a distraction and especially when you've had your heart on the word and said no I'm gonna I want to read this scripture the Lord's laid some things on your heart and Satan immediately distracts you put your attention over on something else listen I know I was just a young man way back I wrote said in my Bible Lord and he showed me he showed me you're giving in to this I'm wanting you you put a message on your heart to read I put something to feed on here and immediately you've got something better to do Satan pointed you to something else and for me I was hunting I loved hunting and pointing to well remember I had outdoor life well I have to be all right if I just would read that receive what's happened distracted me and I'm caught up in that why because it's fleshly it's things that satisfy your flesh do you realize that this word doesn't satisfy your flesh it makes it bitter see what I'm saying but it also delivers your flesh but you're going to bear in it see so you say well feeding on the word just doesn't satisfy what does it satisfy I hope it's satisfying something and you're not doing it just because just because well I gotta read a scripture and I got to read just this and this and I would just do that and I've done my duty that's an attitude that's the attitude The Moldy the objective deep down of a lot of people instead of doing it to receive more and want to know more of him more about him to receive something from him you're doing it because well I've done my duty you'll never get anywhere with that you'll never get anywhere with works trying to satisfy the Lord through works it's a love affair I believe in good works but where's the motive of it where is it coming from okay it's the distraction of it I'm not saying you shouldn't read that something in the news but watch out because watch what God is doing what you're giving time for when you could have been giving it to something else and he's given you that time for him that thirst that you're trying to satisfy through other things all right what's happened to your church you've seen so much television so much things in the world it's easy for your old Adam nature to drift into that to act like the rest of them all right you want to know where that comes from message leadership leadership interesting Prophet would bring that under a message of leadership leadership of what eternal life Christ in you he said True predestinated Believers will stay with the word because they are part of that word o wandering Stars how long will you want Wonder you Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Outsiders whatever you might be wandering stars from church to church from pillar to place and television to television world to world or Internet I said I'm going to make Television Internet so internet to internet he is longing for you he wants to transform you by the renewing of your mind he longs to have fellowship with you he said he wants to transform you by the renewing of your mind not to the church or to the denomination but to his word which you are part of if that desire is in you you are a part of if that desire is in you what are you Desiring you know what's in your soul by what you desire if you're Desiring him you're part of him well I made mistakes still a part of him all right I'm not just Christian de-christianizing you if I am I'm de-christianizing myself I'm not telling you because well if you do that you're just completely lost no we're talking about the subtleness of Satan and God's wanting you to know you can be free of it it's your choice you know when he's distracting you and it don't have to be this can be other things and I and I'm saying you the things we do and there's things there's a time and a place for everything okay there's a time but what are you seeing what are you watching what is it producing we're going to come to another scripture in in a moment here what Paul spoke of in Philippians what it does I'm trying to get to that and I will try to go along real quickly here I don't have my local watch up here all right it's dead well that's good all right I'm just going to bypass some of these there's lots of things foreign he said oh today we're getting so slothful the church is getting so worldly and he's preaching this on a message called the presence of God unrecognized that's what's happening and so indifferent and so their minds they're getting so worldly and so indifferent and their minds are muddled up with Television Internet we love Susie and some of these old things and staying home that shows where the people's hearts are and you can tell them these things are wrong and they think you're crazy what is it Lover's a pleasure more than lovers of God see oh the greatest pleasure watch what the prophet says the greatest pleasure I know of is to be is to be to pray until I realize that I'm in the presence of God and recognize it well I spend I spend this much time in prayer I don't care how much time you spend what happens how sincere are you when you go to prayer do you make God a messenger boy or do you pray to be lifted up to his presence amen come into His presence he said unrecognized I think we ought to be it ought to be the thrill of the church is the presence of the Holy Spirit seeing that God that made the promise standing among us feel his presence and see his word and see it Vindicated it ought to give Faith to make cripples walk blind seed death here dumb speak it ought to be the opening of the word and the word becoming more flesh all the time you're making those things that you see if whether you realize it or not on some of those things you see in the internet you're making that your example there's a great deception in these things brother Bram says it is he says he said the Pentecostals used not to go to them dirty filthy picture shows when they had such plays the devil put one on you and put the television or the internet in your house are you with me and don't tell me it's just not newscast I'm talking about because one thing leads to another the next thing you look at a movie well it's okay there's no dirty words but yeah but they were kissing and they were doing this we'd more is it motivated what's it pointing to yeah if you can't discern some of these Spirits then I say you need the discerner okay now I just leave it like that he put it right there he just put one over on you instead of going to it's okay you put that ahead of the word you put that ahead of you and then you presume you've got the Holy Ghost listen brother sister it's no time to presume you have the Holy Ghost we better know you have it God never intended you to pursue and hope I do amen you either have or you don't and you either know or you don't it's not presuming well I have good intentions brother Brown's a good intentions many have good intentions it's not good intentions what is this message doing for you what's it was it transforming you is it changing you what is it doing what do you see in your life what kind of fruit are you bearing is it more of him it's a great instrument of Hell brother Ram said these television and the it's a house Satan that great instrument of hell has come down amongst the people and deceived them into these things amen all right let's go on committing okay he said now watch it's not only distractions of those things it's the destruction of music oh they're such nice words yeah they're they're a little bit modern what do we call that modern music it's a different name temporary contemporary that's it yeah it should be temporary in your life but it's contemporary oh it sounds good got a nice beat but what is it satisfying your flesh or your soul nice words where where's the source coming from oh Satan can do those nice things in fact he knows how to he knows how to worship as far as we understand worship praises and everything and songs so beautiful a lot more than you ever thought of he was the chief leader of that in heaven he knows what it is be careful about that contemporary if it's not speaking and that's the problem it's catching a lot of attention especially young people pulling their hearts the wrong direction here's a man that's been in music I've been in music I've been in a lot of music through my life I know what it is brother sister I'm telling you be careful because it can be a deception it is a wrong spirit amen Satan knows how to put just certain words to it amen that's right all right that's why we need Godly music leaders why a church needs Godly music leaders that have discernment about that kind of music that's the truth amen all right you need a holy ghost one that's why deacons have to be holy ghost LED because they have to have discernment amen these movies and things he said when you watch that type of programs he and this is how I said it you and I know you shouldn't be going to dances I hope nobody is Boogie Woogie parties and watch old dirty television internet programs you are committing adultery with Christ on him as calling him your husband amen all right there will come a time in the name of the Lord that people will go completely insane this is on the knoweth that not message 65. there will come a time when people will go completely insane the Bible said so they'll scream and holler great hideous things in their imaginary mind notice the radios and things or television programs are producing it most of the news today is garbage I'm just going to be very Frank with you it's garbage who cares about whether the Bison did this to that one and this and and it's just constant everything amen I say let the Lord I say God give me understanding of what I need to hear otherwise let my head be out of it help me and he said you make the decision you have the discernment you make the decision I said Thank You Lord that's exactly right he said he said they're going to see things and we know they are and I'm not saying you guys people are watching that today but they are now watch what it's doing to their minds he said that's see they're seeing prehistoric creatures that's lived in the earth so many thousands and millions of years hatch and come forth he said that's just minor thing to what's going to happen when hell is open the Devil comes out with all his mysterious things see Harold hell has opened this widen's mouth you can see it everywhere you go they can't even make decisions they can't make why can't they it's Darkness gross Darkness to people they can't discern light from dark but you're not that way and God is concerned about the littlest things you say well they ought to be all these big things no just what about the little foxes what about the little foxes that spoil the vine and you're connected to the Vine what's the spoiling the vine connecting with the branch in your branch if it spoils Divine you're spoiled if he can reach into that vine and spoil it your connection with it guess what you'll wither that's right is that right okay all right now he said he said talk about telling people saying they're gospel singers he said I never saw a bunch of rookies like I saw on that close recording gospel singers it was discredited to Jesus Christ to see they were carrying on shaking themselves and listen I've seen enough shaking of people around in message churches that it makes me sick to my stomach almost and especially in the women amen that's the truth and they think that's a religious move no it's not a religious move most of them aren't dressed decent either what you would call holiness the Bible the Bible said that present your body a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God but of course without the Holy Ghost you wouldn't discern what was holy and acceptable anyway now I'm not talking about out here in the world they've got that I'm talking about in message churches the message Arena not here say here message Arena don't take your cues from that Amen Let the Holy Spirit come in it'll be holy you'll wanna you'll want to cover yourself all right the world will go completely totally insane it's not but just one degree from it now that's back in 65 where is it now in 2023 it's not one degree it's here what he said Has Come and it's only going to get worse and worse but thank God for the protection the guidance the strength I would say we better draw night to him we better let it be our meditation every day amen and don't try to just get under the wire on things and do things you know are wrong just kind of under the table type situations that's what the devil wants you to do well nothing wrong with that yeah but you know what a lie is 99 truth God doesn't say well I believe all of it but some of it I can get by with here no you want to believe all of it right Lord line me up with every bit of it all your will I'm going to have to bypass this safe time now brother Graham said that Arizona schools at that time was suffering from mental deficiency 68 of them was by looking at television he says how about that if that was 68 now what is it who wonder why we have such a mental deficiency among people it's because of what they're feeding on probably 99 of the time is what they're feeding on what if you started feeding on the word more what comes from that I am come to do what bring life and that more abundantly just stay with the word the word is the answer the word is your deciding factor we bring every thought let's go to Second Corinthians a minute I know you know these things but what did what did Paul say he said flee idolatry brother Trevor what time is it okay anybody know the time nine my goodness time to quit okay I'm gonna come down to a close here second Corinthians 10 5 you know that scripture but I'm going to read it anyway and we'll just I want you to bring every thought under obedience second Corinthians 10 5. casting down imaginations verse 5 casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ okay Philippians 4 let's go to Philippians chapter 4. finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are good report if they're be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things now that should be a guideline for you and what you're seeing what you're hearing that's right what our conversation goes what our conversation with others see what are you thinking on what is it meditate on that take some time and say Lord show me what those things mean what is true what is lovely what is pure okay he said believe he said and the token he said

shorts and the cards and the cigarettes television whatever more and kick them out the door you're going to apply the token won't stand still for it yes sir take it all out all the dances and the parties and rock and roll an old vulgar newspapers and stuff of that world kick it out the door say we're cleaning up this place around here now I know what he thought about television I wonder what do you think about the internet oh it could be used the right way it could have been used but it's been a it turns to be a curse in many cases see but you have control over it and if you don't you need to kick it out if you can't control it get rid of it amen well but it has so many other things yes but it's got things you don't need to look at but if you can't control and not keep your nose out of the things you should look at get rid of it censor do something because I would rather do that than lose my my soul lose my relationship lose my fellowship with him okay now he said you fathers and you mothers are you ready to establish an altar in your house and take the television out are you ready to take the deck of cards off the table them comic books that your children are reading preparing their little mind for a blast the devil's going to give them are you ready to establish the old family altar again he said the whole thing is corrupt the whole thing is a putrefied sore we know that don't let him spray you and say well it's higher ethics more educated that we used to be in the old days don't you let the devil put that over on you I showed you his whole program of civilization education and science it's got right into the church don't you listen to that keep your head out of them old dirty televisions and things all right I beseech you brother and by the mercies of God that present okay I already quoted that excuse me he said out of the mouth preceded blessings and cursing my brother and these things ought not to be sold to the Fountain send forth the same place Sweet Water and bitter can the Fig Tree my brother and bear Ollie berries either a Vine figs so can no Fountain yield both salt water and fresh so what are you spending your time on you

sacrifice for us I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way o when wilt thou come unto me I will walk within my house with a perfect heart I will set no Wicked thing before mine eyes what about that I hate because why you're thinking on something then and listen even the newscasts are full of naked women amen you you men you know what I'm talking about what you said in your mind then what are you setting your eyes I'm saying from all appearance of evil you say oh I just can't do it yes you can the Satan making you believe you can't that you have the same choice I have yeah it depends on where your heart is neither shalt thou bring an Abomination into the house lest I'll be a curse thing like it lest thou be a cursing like it Thou shalt see what is it saying here you bring an abomination in thine house you'll become cursed just like it you'll take on its nature you'll take on its its its way he said but but thou shall utterly detest it that thou that thou shall utterly abhor it for it is accursed thing amen his two bad mothers set their kids down in a television program of some Scandal or or a or a video or or a or a telephone in their hands you know iPhones and now telephones anymore they're they're little computers in your hands teaching them you know we ought to be really careful what we influence our children too you know every day every decision you make is influencing your children either to the word or from the word amen that's the truth and they're going to learn most of that the first four years little children flea idolatry what is idolatry what is that spirit anything that'll bring something to you presented to you that takes the place of him having first place flee it flee it amen amen let's Stand Together I had Romans 8 5 marked down here and I thought let me just look at it I may just read it to close here with it eight five oh for they that are after The Flesh do you mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit amen amen thank you Lord I know it's a little different tonight what I what I ministered do you think but Lord laid that very deeply in my heart and it's a warning I just let the Holy Ghost deal with you if you really know him and love him Lord show me where I'm airing here I don't think this is something unusual I think he's probably dealt with some of us about it already that's good but he's just encouraging to keep on walk with him you're not going to get out of here any other way without him that's all there is to it and our whole Focus ought to be going home not in other things we shouldn't be putting you know what you say well yeah I know we should continue on building or doing things and if it's something you just keep on keeping on but yes yes that's true but be careful amen our Focus ought to be ought to have first place he ought to be the Little Wheel that controls your life your home your life your thoughts your attitudes your emotions your objectives amen everything needs to be controlled by him and that's what the believer wants that's what the real believer wants the real Holy Ghost Phil believer wants that they're not depending on Sensations and feelings I like to feel good but we're going to depend upon what he said amen that's what the Holy Ghost depends on that's what the Holy Ghost feeds on is what he said that's his word amen heavenly father I know this has been different but Lord I believe it was ordained and I well I know it is because the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord and all things work together for good to them that love him so father we'd love you we know that this isn't just something that's going to pass Lord your word will not return void to deal with every one of us individually over these things the enemy's trying to throw distractions and let us be careful Lord because when you're moving on the scene pulling us to draw closer you're pulling us Satan going to have something is going to try to distract you and Lord by that distraction is how those in the back of that line when the bride saw the bride when the prophet saw the bride marching they had their eyes on the word he represented the word they had their eyes turned and they were marching in Step but then some right at the very last where we're at today Lord got a little out of Step they started to get out of step and he cried stay in line stay in line and he said they were distracted they got their eyes over on something else going on that church going into chaos and [Music] Lord don't let us get distracted keep us on the right path keep our motive and objectives right our attitudes right our desires right why do we do the thing why are we looking at what we're looking at why are we seeing what we're seeing why are we doing

feel it sweet can you realize the wonderment and the wonderful how wonderful it is that he's given us his word and what arrests that is to the believer it's a joy to arrested him to trust him when I don't know what's going to happen when I don't know how to make a decision it's a joy that he said wait on me it's a joy it's a it's a real joy and it's a real rest that he's given us his word that's the truth what do we do if we why that ought to be the happiness our happiness and joy is to have his word because everything we need is laying right in him amen look to her husband he's the North
