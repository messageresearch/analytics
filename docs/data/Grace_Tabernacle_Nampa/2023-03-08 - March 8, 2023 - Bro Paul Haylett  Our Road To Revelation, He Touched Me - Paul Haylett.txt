that from our heart amen that our hearts desire is just to be heard actually just studying you know brother Branham just kind of putting some thoughts together and brother Branham is just talking about what a blessing it is that God hears us it's we're we're a voice that is familiar to him and now I thank God for that amen and just uh just so happy a couple things tonight maybe we'll Express them during the service just hearing the song service that just touched my heart amen I want to uh mention that I would like to have Bible study this Sunday uh 5 p.m again like we've been doing with uh some prayer time to close that out also just want to announce early um communion foot washing on April the 2nd so that way we'll we'll know and be able to plan uh a little quicker I haven't been very diligent kind of springing that on the people I want to get to where it's it's known out in advance and uh obviously we have things in life and circumstances so you know we never look down on those who can't make it but it is definitely my heart that everyone would be there and uh you know every time you go to write down prayer requests you know it's like you have a mental block and uh just uh sister Sue would like to be remembered Amen brother Dan is is doing better uh and uh I will boldly Proclaim that we call him brother we're claiming amen we never want to come his life the Lord just deals with us in certain ways and and I just uh I just you know the prophet of God said just make that Circle bigger anyway sister Sue desires to be remembered and give her strength I know brother Tim Sister Miriam have had quite a trip and of course uh um all the travel and stuff so let's remember our brother Tim Sister Miriam this evening I want to just take a moment if I may I see brother Titus sitting here on the front row and I pray that there'll be many many services that we see him there and our sister Donna I just uh you know sometimes jokingly but you don't want to be misunderstood it's like you're in the wrong seat move up move up and I was just thinking tonight our dear sister vika here she is playing so beautifully a gift that God's given her and I'm thankful and to sum that off I would like to just say I am very pleased to see our sister back at the piano she give many years to this little body of Believers and and I have I don't want people to be shocked people always misunderstood sometimes it seems like they want to be but I just love Sister Sarah she's always just Captain even Keel I don't know how she is at home but but she's always just been so willing and I I just want to say thank you now and thank you for the future amen because when we had very limited resources Our Sister Sarah stepped up and God's blessed us I mean look at what's happened we have three four five brothers that can lead songs and we have uh uh I'd have stopped to do the math so we'll just say uh many gifted musicians in the church already and rising up and I don't know maybe I'm feeling sentimental tonight but I just say thank you Lord for the blessings that you're raining down upon us and so let's just turn to the word tonight thank you so much our musicians and I just have to say to brother Chris as maybe a more willing I don't get sidetracked and we express this but uh just some things that just really touched my heart in the song service tonight let's just stand go into the word of God and to Mark the eighth chapter but I want to speak to you on our journey because this is what we're in my brother and sister this is not a Sprint amen and this is not a relay we don't get a hand it off to someone else as it were and we stop running but this is a journey that we're on and I want to take this out of Mark the eighth chapter tonight our road to revelation he touched me and uh along the way I just pray uh this will this will um all tied together amen Mark 8 and 22 now I want you to catch this right above this Marcus giving us the account of the fishes and the loaves of the crowds and the disciples are Jesus is interacting with them and and he can tell they they don't get it and uh if you just go back there and you'll read you'll see that Jesus is speaking pretty straight to them basically saying you know what you're not figuring this out you're not seeing the big picture and then there's a little shift right here moving from the 21st verse to the 22nd and it says and he cometh to Bethesda and they bring a blind man unto him and besought him to touch him and he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town and when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands upon him he asked him if he saw ought and he looked up and said I see men as trees walking after that he put his hands again upon his eyes and made him look up and he was restored and saw every man clearly and he sent him away to his house saying neither go into the town nor tell it to any in the town and then we see in verse 27 that Jesus then moves on and goes to caesarea Philippe and it's there that he's talking to the disciples and he asked them who do men say that I am Heavenly Father we thank you Lord today your grace and mercy Lord just to be able to rise up by Revelation Lord and press into the mark of the High Calling to Lord be able to press through the the darkness and the oppression of this day and father just as we saw this afternoon a storm rolled through and it got very dark and very windy and very cloudy Lord over us and uh on the drive to church Lord here we are trying to take a picture of such a beautiful sunset because your word said it would be light in the evening time father let the darkness the storms of life fall behind us as we look at the promise that we come into the evening time and to the bride of Christ your wife it will be light in the evening time we thank you for that Lord thank you for speaking to our hearts we thank you for your word a life-changing word guide us tonight we pray bless each one in your name amen you may be seated as we look at this we'll see tonight a blind man being brought to our lord Jesus now when you think about that uh a blind man what a need my brother and sister you know it is such that that we have become so uh familiar as it were from birth to be able to see and here here is one who does not see cannot see and uh you know it is something that's just hard to imagine but you know if you have like myself and I I just use it for you might say example or analogy uh when you have one that has a poor natural eyesight you know uh uh I I thought everybody struggled to read the chalkboard in school and I've been wearing glasses since I was 13 years old and and I know that's not too younger there's intermitts that face a similar thing but you you tend to kind of morph into a position where you you know your eyesight is something that's important to you and here is a man being brought wrong no doubt my brother and sister are these who brought him or were concerned to bring him to Jesus cared for him it doesn't say in the scripture that they were critics looking for some kind of a miracle to or lack of or whatever to criticize but I just take this as someone who loved this man and wanted them him to come to Jesus and ask him to touch him besought him that's a fervent request and and uh to to just touch this man they weren't needing of some great example of some kind of testimony some kind of recital of the great things they already were convinced and they're bringing this and asking and my brother and sister it is uh just a touch and we'll think about this for just a moment if I may just a touch is all they were asking there was maybe other infirmities maybe not but we'll look at this this and realize that all they were searching for was just a touch from our lord Jesus and I would say tonight if in this midst of this building tonight we have any kind of a need we should be saying Lord I just need a touch tonight just touch me tonight Lord I I have this need and the prophet of God in studying for this thought you know he's talking about that it's not just about the physical need it's not just that maybe one needs a touch in their body or touching their eyesight but God come and touch us in our spirit touch us right down to the depths of our souls that we can respond to the word and find life being restored and I just felt very moved as I studied this now my brother and sister we see that all through the Bible all through the message that we see the example of God bringing us to a place of Separation we'll look at Abraham for just a moment my brother and sister he was commanded of God it was not a request it was not a suggestion he was commanded of God to separate himself from his family but yet we'll see how that lot was there when it All Shook out that no doubt they thought you know who's going to take care who's going to care for for him and they took him along and my brother and sister sometimes we have little things like that that we take along with us when God has asked us for a separation and you know it's difficult sometimes because they can be emotional ties they can be as it were physical ties but we look at this and sometimes you might say I've seen this in in in my time that people actually have spiritual ties back to a certain time and place in their life and that's good but if the foundation or the tie there is not beneficial for their spiritual walk today it's not a tie it's an anchor and God doesn't want us to be anchored so he calls us my brother and sister while we are called to be a part of a body of Believers right Grace Tabernacle God is calling us into a separation in other words our relationship with him should not be dependent on this person or that person but we are called into a separate relationship with our Lord Jesus Christ and we walk in that relationship and then in our time of need we don't run to the pastor we run to this manner to that one we run to the Lord amen and that's what God is trying or wanting to train us to do is that he becomes our first place of Refuge or first place of counsel amen and so God comes down and in moving here Jesus he he doesn't he could have just laid hands on him right there at that place declared him healed and he would have been healed right I that's the power of our Lord Jesus Christ but it was there that God is now laying an example and he takes this man and takes him by the hand amen which in that there's a sign or example of guidance and it's there that he now is becoming this Man's Guide he's not just there to speak words over him but he's imparting something much deeper than natural eyesight he is imparting guidance to this man and so he takes him not there into the city park and not into the the uh um oh what do you call it in the middle of the town the plaza he's not taking him into that area he takes him out of town my brother and sister he's bringing this man into a place of total separation um not dependent on his friends rallying yes believe believe but he takes him entirely out to a total separation and this man doesn't say what are you doing and why aren't you just praying for me he is in a place in total separation of total submission wherever Jesus led him he was following oh I say Lord help us help us Lord that we can come to a place of total submission to follow him and you know he takes him out of the Town into this place of separation and you know no doubt there would have been negative Spirits there no doubt there would have been Spectators there maybe what you would call the religious sightseers the ones that you know were if I could see a sign I could believe well my brother and sister it's very clear that if people would see the Lord Jesus Christ today if they don't believe his word they wouldn't believe if he was standing here in their midst they would still find fault or find a reason to not follow a reason to not submit to the word so he leads him away from the negative from the religious as it were the sight seers you see not to take too long tonight I I just kept trying to prune this back but you see the Lord Works in unconventional ways when I say unconventional they're actually the normal they're the real they're the absolute they're the supernatural but man has got his idea into religion and he has now molded religion to where when God works it's unconventional and you tie these words together and you'll find that even the word uh heretical is that did I pronounce heretical man's way is now declaring God's way heretical now think about that it should be what God you are declaring your way but man has come in such a concept that they now declare the work of God the supernatural to be strange it's it's out of the ordinary out of the it's not normal I want to know what is normal my brother and sister I don't mean to mock but I want to tell you more and more we see people with tattoos we're talking about extensive tattoos and and people are complimenting on their body art my brother and sister that is defiling the Temple of the Holy Ghost that is against the word of God and yet it's now becoming considered a form of art to deface this body my how clever Satan is so God working in the unconventional how unconventional will God be he will lead a blind man from the town to a place there's a very limited and these Witnesses would be considered not very dependable come on look out the church look how the Temple look how the priests looked at the disciples their testimony is not dependable yet our Lord Jesus Christ leads them from any other witness that they would be and he brings them out here outside of the town and I'm telling you this is getting really unconventional because he spits in his eyes come on brothers and sisters I I don't mean to try and make humor out of this but if you come up here and said I have this need and the preacher starts spitting on you you're going to be going what is going on here and there is something that is there's nothing through the Scrolls imagine if there had been Witnesses they'd have been rolling the Torah out they would have been trying and do we have any history at all of this there's nothing but God didn't care because he was the one who wanted the witnesses to be his Witnesses not Witnesses of the church not Witnesses of religion of a sect or a certain group or of the critic he wanted the witnesses to be true Witnesses and it's there that he takes this man outside of this city and he is there and spits in his eyes and I'm telling you my brother and sister that's so unorthodox that even we right now tonight look at that and go oh my but that was God's approach that was God's answer of this time right now my brother and sister to deal with a blind man and he spits on his eyes and he spits there into his eyes as a word and you know what he he is there it's like look who would ever think that that would be an Avenue or a route to healing but my brother and sister I'm telling you here was a man that had come to a place I don't believe he was just looking for healing I believe he was looking not in in the flesh but he was looking for another kind of healing he was looking for a restoration that something down in the soul was saying there's got to be an answer to the questions I have well why am I here why do I exist what is God's plan for my life and here it is unfolding and it's so unorthodox one would say there's no way that could be healing brother Branham says in the message yes please perseverant God is Supernatural can we say Amen you don't scientifically prove God you believe God you believe it if you don't believe it then a man that says everything that's not scientifically is unorthodox it's not right come on I hope you're catching this connection right here they're coming down the church says we have an Avenue and when the Messiah comes these things will take place but this is not the Messiah so they cut him out of the equation and there they're looking now for some kind of Avenue that fits their plan and God says you know what you're not going to be able to prove this by any plan I'm going to spit in this man's Vine I'm going to wipe that saliva around his eye and you won't be able scientifically to prove how thou will bring healing but here is a man so submitted oh God let us come to this so submitted that Lord however you want to bring Deliverance in my life whether it can be in my own prayer time I'm looking for a great preacher to come and I'm sorry I haven't been inviting very many and if that's the time my faith would rise up I'm going to ask you do you not have faith in the prayers that you were praying to our god to our Lord Jesus Christ we should have that kind of faith in the very words that come from our lips Lord you know my needs you know my heart you know my family you know my health you know my circumstance Lord I Believe You're My Healer you're my provider you're my deliverer I believe it sorry I'm getting strident but it's just my hearts it's just leaping everything that's not scientifically is unorthodox it's not right then that man can never be a Christian pretty straightforward isn't it if we got to come to the place we need some other thing remember the man that stood before brother Phantom I believe that was in in Houston or Dallas Texas and says you know we can cut the baby you heal it prophet of God said that man ain't even a Christian needs something that's so you know prove it to me now I don't want to deviate off into that but I've had people look me in the face and say that's what you believe in the message prove it to me and you know I I would go home sister Jerry which you don't like me saying you're my witness but she was the witness there go home and I'm like I don't even know how I couldn't even speak and you realize God was binding you because if we have to come and we have to prove we have to prove what faith is how can you do that how can you prove what Revelation is you can't do that those are gifts from God we cannot come and scientifically prove a gift from God he has to believe by faith we believe God not by education not by theology but by faith ye are saved notice Faith finds a source that others don't see now hope you kind of catch really why I kind of chose this quote because we can have perfect natural eyesight and not see we can be blind as a bat outside of the Physical Realm spiritual realm blind is a bat faith finds the source his word is a sword Hebrews 4 12 said not the word of God is sharper than two-edged sword even discerns the thoughts it's intents that's in the heart that's the word of God and the only thing that can hold that sword is the hand of faith look at how this comes together so much you know a weak Christian they don't tend to act on the word they'll believe it but they don't tend to act on the word because they haven't built up to that yet you know they're they're getting strengthened by the by the preaching of the word by the eating of the book they're getting strengthened until the day or the season comes just like we would not take in the days of old a child and give them a giant spear or a giant sword and send them into battle because they're not seasoned in the art of warfare and that's why even when the scripture talks about pastors Ministry that you don't want novice right now we all have to start somewhere so we don't want to get critical in the age factor and say Well they're not old enough not enough experience but that to put that in a leadership role you know God says don't let a novice do that because when it comes to Warfare my brother and sister right as many would have faced Samson turns out they were all novices in their Warfare Samson didn't need a giant sword and a giant Shield he just needed to believe and when he picked up that Jawbone of that donkey he didn't Stomp and scientifically say this jawbone's bleached white it's got the strength maybe I should just grab this weed over here it'll be strong as this Jawbone he didn't prove that that way he just took what was provided started slaying the enemy but a less experienced man would have said I don't have the tools to fight the enemy right now I need to just run I'll run away from this battle I'll run away from this experience I'll run away from this circumstance but God says no I don't want you to run I want you to believe and I want you to stand and as we look at this my brother and sister sharper Discerning thoughts intents of the heart that's the word of God and the only thing that can hold that sword is the hand of faith and nothing else can do it nothing else you have to see something otherwise scientific you scientifically educationally you cannot hold that sword and we'll look at this and realize what it is you can't do it by education it's too Twisted too complicated you'll make it it'll make it it'll try to deny itself in everything and you know I I would just was reading a little literature and it's one thing I do believe that we need to make sure our young people understand well maybe everyone understands but you look at this and I was reading a a little deal and the man's you know here is a grown educated man saying we really can't explain the Trinity but we just believe it is so um and the question that was lobbied back to him where is that in the Bible Matthew 28 19 I don't care how you turn that upside down you don't find Trinity there and you don't find anyone with a testimony that they acted on that but Satan planted the seed men anointed to water it even so much today that there's various things on the face of the Earth that if you don't believe the Trinity you can't even be a part of this some of the health care programs that they promote you know the the Christian Health Care Ministries Etc good programs right but they put it as a requirement to belong to that that you would hold to the Trinity my what's health care and a false Doctrine got to do together well it comes down to a Time of inclusion or exclusion it really is that simple and so it's way too complicated you make it it make it it tried to deny itself and everything you cannot do it Jesus said it's hid from you so forget about it you cannot know it it's hid and when God hides anything it's really hidden wow I'm telling you tonight Saints the reason I bring this out in this fashion I want you to realize as we are sitting here tonight amen this blind man being led God came and he has led you and I to the place that he has applied now South will call it to our eyes that we're able to see and without him oh let's just go back and name it like it is without him spitting and wiping that in our eyes we would never see we might have perfect eyesight in the natural but our soul would be blind to the word of God tonight has come my brother and sister and it is here that we stand in the presence of almighty God he has led us by the hand Can someone say Amen he's led us out of Darkness he's led us out of deception he's led us out of all these isms and schisms and led us out to a place and said you know what I'm going to open your eyes for you I'm going to touch you I'm going to affect your life in such a fashion that when you have your eyes open my brother and sister it is just a startling thing you know that when your eyes have been opened I'm talking about real Christians no matter how hard Satan tries he cannot close them he cannot bring you back to darkness no matter how hard he tries he cannot take you back and we are eternally grateful that our Lord has come let us out of the multitude of the town of city of the critics of all the false witness and let us out into a small might say group or small what to come and let us see the prophet of God once again speaking it's not just about natural my brother and sister but even speaks to them of let it take place now in the spiritual we have needs but our greatest need that we have is in the spiritual it is not to solve this problem or solve that problem if we took that problem to our grave or took that problem to the Rapture I say thank you Lord but let the eyesight let the ears let the understanding be set forth by our Lord Jesus Christ amen not to be walking through this life perfectly healthy and blind to the word of God if it be vice versa I say let it be so that we would see him as he is amen so we see how that this is coming to pass and it's blind man is being led but do you realize as you read this scripture that Jesus was also leading the disciples because behind this he takes them and he asks them who do men say that I am now it's pretty easy my brother and sister to stand here and say well the prophet said come on I'm not trying to make any you know big political type point but it's real easy to say the prophet said but Jesus Narrows this down in other words he said everything else aside he looked you and I in the face as he looked the disciples in the face who do you say I am and my brother and sister unfortunately this is the hour we're living in many people can look to this and say well the prophet said but it's hard for them to come and face who they themselves say where do I stand can we just put it that blood where do I stand in the message because this message my brother and sister you know I've just gave up trying to make the point this message is Jesus Christ you know understand please understand the message we believe is Jesus Christ I'm here to say tonight this message is Jesus Christ period not another alternative to be to to be uh explained or dissected or or woven in my brother and sister if we don't see that this message is the word of God our Lord Jesus Christ tonight we got to go back to square one right we're teaching algebra to people that can't even figure anything out amen it won't work it won't work and as the last of this quote is you can't do it by education too Twisted too complicated how do you reconcile Acts 2 38 and Matthew 28 19 if you believe in the trinity but our understanding of the godhead should be solid enough but we can look in the word now we hear all of these well you know it's a father son yes all of that fits together that's lovely but if they're blind that goes right by them all of that is just like no no you're not getting it you're not getting it just goes right by when the eyes have been opened I don't care what you have on your hand Lord just touch me spiritual revelation maybe it comes with correction first maybe it comes with a time of consecration maybe it comes with a time of restoration maybe it comes with whatever God chooses for it to come with but Lord what I'm looking for is your hand to touch me and open my eyes and open my ears because I want to see you and I don't want you to see you what I think you are I want to see you as you are amen but look at this disciples a blind man being led disciples being led and it wasn't just this Blind Man's eyes my brother and sister that we're being open to the supernatural God was educating if you want to call it we just talked about not being education so I just use that as a phrase God is educating the disciples he's he's instructing he's showing them how the power of the word can come and be absolute life-changing imagine you just saw fishes and Loaves and you walked away and said wow that's that was incredible and that's all you got out of it come on my brother and sister we understand by the word of God that many people went away from there that day and all they were there for was the fishes and the loaves they they were there to be blessed and walked away with no revelation but here's a man if I could imply it this way here's a man who is blind and he willingly follows Jesus out of the town and when Jesus spits and wipes a spittle in his eyes and his eyes then are affected but I want you to catch this I hope you catch this whole spiritual picture his eyes are affected and when Jesus asked him if he can see he says yes I can I can see Acts 2 38. I I conceive yes I can see this I can see this but when he is asked if he can see it clearly he says no I see men as though they were trees walking very very indistinct understanding but look where it is my brother and sister let's not ever mock that because that's an improvement from where it was and the man had the honesty I hope you follow me the man had the honesty to say I'm not seeing it I'm not seeing it clearly I can't see what you're talking about but then in that expression Jesus doesn't say well that's all the Revelation I'm going to give you for this day for this age for your spiritual walk know what I'm going to do is I'm going to touch you again I'm going to touch you again and when I touch you I'm asking you now what do you see and he's there in the natural saying I see it clearly but look at this in the spiritual realm God coming I want to say tonight Lord I Thank you tonight I lift my hand and I thank you tonight that Lord you didn't just touch me once or twice you've been touching me over and over and over and over Through The Years in my time of Despair in my time of need in my time of desperation you're there touching me and all I can see now I cannot see the help of this world I cannot see the wealth of this world I cannot see the influence of this world I don't care about all their influencer and their scheme all I can see is Jesus Christ because he's been touching me every day after day after day oh life changing oh I'll tell you what it it causes me off thinking about this as I study and I was thinking about this the song when he reached down his hand for me he didn't come and say Hey you over there just come the direction of my voice no sir he come as it were literally and took him by the hand you know it's so interesting as a child I used to have nightmares actually partner every night and it was the same nightmare for years and if you want to be creeped out I'll tell you about it because up until the time I was probably 15 years old it was the same nightmare it wasn't a swamp monster it wasn't of this or of that it was something that brought absolute tip to my heart and I'd wake up in the middle of the night scream and my mama would walk in the room sit down on the bed and take me by the hand that's the last thing I remember because I was in a place of peace and comfort I was in a place that my mom was here and I did have my mama tell me some years later I was just getting sick and tired of you doing that I was ready for you to grow up but you see I couldn't help I couldn't help that I didn't go to bed at night thinking I'm going to have this just horrible nightmare and I'm going to scream to the top of my lungs until my mama comes no but it was something that came but when he touched me the nightmare of who I was and why I was here and where my life was going faded away because there was peace and comfort I believe this all being lumped together by Mark all this the bread the fish in the loaves this blind man going to caesarea Felipe and and doing this all being lumped together right there one right after the other my brother and sister I believe that our lord Jesus was actually preparing while he blessed this man with his natural sight and I believe a spiritual touch also he's preparing the disciples to come to a showdown that they themselves need to see they themselves have to come to a place they see it for themselves no longer just Jesus speaking to them and then we still see the lapse after his crucifixion the lapse of how did this happen why did this happen what is going on but yet he had preached it to them saints could it be that we might come to a Time in this world where people are going to say what happened and why did this happen and it's been preached what's he doing not just trying to prove to us he opened our eyes or our ears he's trying to show us this is things that are to be this is what's coming he preaches the Rapture my brother and sister some people hear the Rapture sermon and think yep we're getting out of here but hidden inside of that message is a real key of our faith to rise up and know that not just is there a catching away but I will be an overcomer when I get to the Rapture amen it's not going to be some miracle that suddenly in the last second of time on Earth turns us into this perfect image of Sons and Daughters of God but he's trying to show us open our eyes open our ears to see that we already have Victory we already are Overcomers we are already in that place and yet we will find that in the message my brother and sister there is a spirit of defeatism that's out there because the Satan is bringing us to a place that we don't think we measured up well what are we going to measure ourselves to what are we going to measure ourselves to because I can tell you right now that Paul heylett started a failure and In the Flesh he would end a failure if it was not for Jesus Christ amen so let's not stop and look at this and have a defeatist attitude but let's stop and say Lord you are showing me something and I want to see it and I want to hear it and Lord what I need and what did the prophet I'm just going to bring this I'm a little out of order here but I'm going to bring this what did the prophet of God tell us to pray for Revelation he didn't say you know don't come down pray for you have authority over this or this and the other he said pray for Revelation because when our eyes are open and our ears are open we will see what is happening around us because you can't have Revelation and be null and void you can't be empty you can't be desolate you can't be oh excuse me I'm just wound up tonight ain't I well Hallelujah yeah you see he saw this I see Menace trees walking I wrote a little footnote here he had a vision of the open Word but not a clear one he knew God had come we refer to it even though we're now in the 21st century but he sent us a 20th century prophet and it brought great clarity or did it oh boy brother Paul I can hear the ACT ice cracking what the prophet of God say he says when this bride sees who she is now trust me I'm not being negative tonight and I don't want you to take this as negative some people believe if you just see the message that's all there is to see but my brother and sister the prophet of God said when this bride sees who she is so she's got to have spiritual eyes it's not just to be able to go to Malachi 4 in Revelation 10 7 and lay these things out she needs some spiritual eyes to see who she is well there's a great spiritual movement on the Earth today the gospel has went around the earth you know the world seven times when the prophet was there and we say oh that's good but can you see can we see who we are that we've been given this great Authority because he has touched our eyes my brother and sister he's anointed Us in the spirit our ears are open to hear the word of God and our spirit has been softened um well I tell you there was a vision there but it didn't have Clarity it wasn't a full revelation so what does he do he puts his hands on his eyes again oh and told them look up come on are you with me Saints one more touch from the Lord and then he didn't tell him now go look see if you can see a footprint in the dirt see if you can see this see that can you see Ministries no he said look up I've touched your eyes I've opened your eyes of understanding it I've touched your life and now it's time for you to look up because your Redemption is drawing nigh and in this movement my brother and sister this stirring of the holy spirit is moving us to quit looking down and look up amen that's what God's wanting us to do quit looking at the problems quit looking at all of this we can't save anybody we can't give anybody revelation we need to look up and pray for them and let our faith be what moves and stirs and comes as a prophet of God talks about the water and the pool of Bethesda when the spirit or the angel of the Lord left the water it was just water there's not a thing you're going to do not a thing we're going to change not an influence as it were directly that we can bring but I tell you by prayer and supplication before the Lord living that word and moving of the spirit my brother and sister we can change things amen but we confront and we can cry I go back and I'm sorry to go back I've told it many times but as we were just in South Africa got to see it with my eyes I got to see a young man that a mother was so concerned about her lost son and God speaking out don't worry about it now how my brother and sister will the words of a stranger impact the heart of a mother concerning a backslidden son but that mother had enough faith that she said okay if God said it I will believe that and her son is serving God today married to a lovely ex-catholic girl and you know that she was used to be just shook up about but God come on this scene it wasn't a man it wasn't a mother's tears as it were just to Cry tears but it was a heart to believe and had a revelation that God said I could claim my family with the token and I'm going to apply the token so that I can stand and be there without one hindrance one thing we have and I'm sorry to go this route but I just feel led to we want to apply the token but we don't even have the token over our own life we need the token over our house before we try to get everyone else in under the token we can't be outside the token and just say I'm applying the token it doesn't work that way my brother and sister what God's wanting us to do is come to a place that our eyes are open we see the word we say I'm going to believe it I'm going to live it I'm going to do this and then God would come and he lays his hand and I want to ask you tonight can't we just lift a hand and say he's laid his hand on my life he has laid his hand on my life the evidence brother Chris made a comment about that he's laid his hand on my life so many times I could not deny him I struggle I have times I want to give up but I look at this and in the end it all comes down to how can I quit him after he is done for me what he has done for me to see the hand of God and see what God's doing it's not just he died on Calvary this is a personal relationship this blind man had a personal relationship with Jesus Christ it was in theory it wasn't just taught in the temple but it was a personal relationship oh my look at this the prophet of God again you can look these things up if you need to ties these things of natural just a few times it's not a tremendous amount of times but he ties the natural eyes and the spiritual eyes together and how he does that oh my brother and sister just stirred my heart yeah oh I'll tell you what each time we've been touched by the word our vision has got clear now I'm telling you how clear our vision ought to be I can only speak for myself but over and over and over and over and I couldn't even say that enough times to cover it the word has come and touched my life clear our vision ought to be how clear our vision should be my brother and sister let's not let those things that so easily beset us fogger Vision again we've been touched by the word and and I don't want to force anybody's reaction but once again all I can do is lift a hand and say God is constantly I pick up my Bible and I've been struggling a little bit and I'm upset about something I pick up my Bible and I'm like oh Lord forgive me Lord forgive me it's not my brother and sister it's not oh I'm reading my Bible not Trevor guy it don't work that way pick up my Bible and I'm looking and I'm like Lord forgive me Lord help me and then you feel that touch where there was turmoil struggle now to replace there's peace oh my oh my he touched me Hallelujah he touched me no one else my brother and sister says it really record in that town a direct touch from Jesus Christ but here's a man who had a testimony I find it remarkable that Jesus tells him don't go back to the town and don't tell it in the town I have to tell you I have a lot of things I surmise but I don't have a real answer for exactly why but if you don't mind I'll just share just a little glimpse of one of the reasons the prophet of God said you can actually be talked out of your healing imagine him walking back into town here he is no crowd with him no lamb to guide him no dog to guide him and no friend that has his hand to guide him and he comes back in town and everybody's like ah happened to you we're not going to believe this Jesus took me by the hand led me out of the town spit in my eyes and I could see but not clearly and he laid hands on me touched me again and now I can see perfectly Judah that's a cult that's spiritualism this is not real if it was real you would have received your healing your eyesight in the temple it would have been the high priest it would have been this way it would have been that way you needed to have been Anointed with oil not spit that is what it says isn't it maybe this Jesus guy is not real and this would have been his friends who had good intentions because we don't want you to get caught up in something that keeps you from the sin of laodicea we don't want you to get caught up in something that was started by a man and it's going to lead you off in a wilderness why don't you just settle down be normal like us drunk on Friday night and fighting with a family and you know out of here and go to church three times a year this three as one Minister once said the three sacred days and he included Chris was that sacred to man not to God says no what I want you to do is I just want you to end up back at your own house and if I could just in just closing bring this out to you I want you to walk up to the door of your own house and maybe a little girl just like Nessa wanted him to walk in that door in front of his baby girl and for her to see with her own eyes no opinion of the neighborhood or the church or the religious to say Daddy you're not blind anymore and the impact that would be on a little girl to have her Daddy get down and say honey the Lord Jesus touched me that little girl would have something embedded in the depths of her soul that Jesus Christ is the Healer he is the deliverer not to hear someone's version of how maybe hit his head and it moved some optic nerve and he can see now wasn't you eating some herbs didn't you have something over here no maybe his own family speaking of token needed to see that power of Jesus Christ on display not hear about it not to become a story because I'm telling you once those that were close to him Saul he wasn't just he hadn't just been given his eyesight for a day or two he was delivered oh I'll tell you what my brother and sister I want to be delivered from any Spirit any hindrance that keeps me from seeing my Lord Jesus as he is to keep me from seeing him in clarity hallelujah amen Philippians 1 6. being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ amen this Revelation that has been given and been open to us my brother and sister it's not a passing Revelation it is the Revelation it is Christ himself amen I'll tell you what just kind of redundant here but I can just see the people's response he spit on you what kind of thing are you into what are you doing there is sacred oil that should have been anointed on you and you have went to some crazy cult but what he knew is he had given himself to Jesus Christ and Christ led him to a life full of Revelation not a life of Destruction or a life of mediocrity but a life of Revelation revelation after revelation after Revelation and you say how do you say it so because I want to tell you as a blind man we don't know that he ever had sight but as a blind man to walk out the door see a sunrise brother Trevor called me this evening because they was just storming like I'll get out over their Direction it's like is everything okay we are having church and see this I make this point and and I believe Brothers Trevor sister Kerry will be able to follow me and and won't feel like I'm pinching on them but they're in a storm my brother and sister and I'm watching one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen in my life and all of that town could have been in a storm and all this man saw was the power of Jesus Christ it was the most beautiful thing to him and yet the scoffer and the critic and all of these would have been in the city Square saying it ain't so it ain't so but by revelation he touched me he touched me by revelation oh hallelujah hallelujah sister vika would you come amen now in the sermon God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same brother Brown says it this way and I I just really touched me it just think they can break atoms and do everything else but when it comes to touching life they can't even tell where it come from a simple blade of grass and God is hid in it they can fire a rocket to the moon and shoot a radar over there or whatever more and yet can't explain the life in the blade of grass that's right see it's because it can't be explained it's so simple they Overlook it he touched me I can't explain it like the little room my brother and sister in the tent vision now I I'm not I don't say this critically but right people are people are just living any old kind of lives [Music] I had a brother share with me he says well this brother and and he just told me who it was this brother says he has so much money you won't believe how much money he has in a bank account that when brother Branham comes back he is going to give all this money hundreds of thousands of dollars gonna give it to brother Brown that's where he's caught up that's what he sees I'm not going to mark that I'm not going to speak down on that but that's not the revelation of this word [Music] man needs a touch and I want to say where would we be tonight except for the touch that he touched us with our eyes and our ears our understanding of the word of God would be just along everything else but he touched me touched us now you look at this my brother and sister God called us I'm so thankful I can't see what the world sees reminds me a little story and I pardon me for even expressing it this way but it's just the way the world thinks of the insanity two young men after the weekend meet at work on Monday morning they'd went to a party on Saturday and the one young man says to the other he said so drunk I passed out the other guy is like I was close the one young man looks at him goes we had fun didn't we you see they're so focused in a self-destructive nature and Satan anoints them to say this was good wasn't it wasn't this good we damaged our liver made fools out of ourselves it was good right but I tell you what's good is when the Holy Spirit comes down moves in our midst moves in the kitchen moves in the bedroom moves in the car moves wherever we are Jesus that's good that's good hallelujah hallelujah yes a little room in the tent [Music] prophet of God recounts it to us what were the people doing they were coming out and people were asking what happened in there they're wanting an explanation of the move of God but look what the prophet of God says their response was I don't know but I'm changed unchanged what was it his touch not the touch of the preacher his touch that's what happened oh may we have a a little room experience every day of our life Hallelujah amen hallelujah let's just stand if you would please [Music] let's just sing that song 471 brother Alex laughs the next song I'd like to sing and the song service tonight foreign [Music] thank you and now I am no longer the same oh he touched me oh he touched me and all over joy that floods my soul something happen and now I know oh he touched me and me me a sense I met this place is savior since he cleansed me me home please I shall I shall ease to praise him oh I will shouted oh he touched me oh my Lord Jesus touch me and all the joy that floods my soul or something happened and now I know he touched me and me me oh let's just lift our hands and thank the Lord we thank you Lord Jesus tonight Lord you've come in an age of education and science Lord when there's all kinds of explanations
