[38:58] through
[39:01] 7 not by works of righteousness which we
[39:05] have done but according to his Mercy he
[39:09] saved us amen by the washing of
[39:12] regeneration not
[39:14] replacement that's right God didn't go
[39:16] find someone that was a little more
[39:18] perfect than us and said I'll just set
[39:20] him in that position in your
[39:23] stead but regeneration and the renewing
[39:26] of the Holy Spirit which he shed on us
[39:30] abundantly can we say the word together
[39:34] abundantly through Jesus Christ Our
[39:36] Savior that being justified by his grace
[39:40] we should be made hes according to the
[39:42] hope of eternal life Heavenly Father we
[39:46] thank you for this opportunity to come
[39:48] Lord to give praise and worship and hear
[39:51] the word of God as you speak to us Lord
[39:53] let it settle right into Those portions
[39:55] of our our heart Mind Body Soul Lord to
[39:59] renew us amen regenerate us father fill
[40:03] us with your Holy Spirit once again that
[40:05] we could leave today Lord with questions
[40:08] answered Spirits rejuvenated Lord
[40:11] strength in this old body father a
[40:13] Clarity of mind that we can press to the
[40:16] mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus
[40:19] we thank you once again Lord in your
[40:21] precious name amen amen you may be
[40:24] seated I just want to say God bless you
[40:26] and greetings to our our visitors and
[40:28] certainly um if I understood correct you
[40:31] go to brother
[40:32] Barry's yes give brother Barry Sister
[40:35] Lisa well the assembly our Greetings
[40:37] From Grace Tabernacle amen amen it's uh
[40:41] it's a wonderful time uh the Lord is
[40:45] just doing and also want to greet our
[40:47] other visitors God bless you amen young
[40:50] man uh we just uh come together Saints
[40:54] of lack precious faith today now as we
[40:57] look at this today this thought uh I
[41:00] just really had a lot of lot of uh you
[41:04] know
[41:05] little distracting thoughts Associated
[41:08] today but by God's grace maybe this can
[41:11] come out if he will be so kind it will
[41:14] flow and actually make sense you see it
[41:19] says not by works of
[41:23] righteousness which
[41:28] excuse
[41:31] me not by works of righteousness which
[41:34] we have done now you know the devil
[41:37] doesn't like it I haven't had a fit
[41:39] since
[41:50] yesterday not by righteousness which we
[41:53] have
[41:54] done the scripture says that our
[41:56] righteous is as filthy rags that we have
[42:00] really nothing to offer we could say you
[42:02] know I've lived a good life I've done
[42:04] this I've done that some of these things
[42:06] in my life that used to bother me I've
[42:08] put them behind me I've been delivered
[42:10] I've done this and I've done that but
[42:12] the truth of it is Saints we have done
[42:14] nothing all that we have done what we do
[42:18] our contribution is simply surrendering
[42:22] to the Lord Jesus Christ it that's
[42:25] that's the great challenge that we have
[42:27] for us is not what we can attain but
[42:30] what we can give up to his service and
[42:33] so if it were of
[42:36] righteousness uh the prophet of God says
[42:39] that there would be many more people
[42:41] more sincere than us so if it was about
[42:44] our sincerity we already know that we
[42:47] would have come short and so it's here
[42:50] that we're not relying on who we are and
[42:53] you know sometimes when you preach this
[42:55] way it sounds like that we we are kind
[42:57] of speaking down on the very life that's
[43:00] been given to us but really what it is
[43:02] is we're recognizing that we are nothing
[43:05] without Jesus Christ and and in that I'm
[43:08] perfectly well I I'm I'm perfectly
[43:10] comfortable I I don't feel like that I'm
[43:12] demeaning myself or or debasing or or
[43:17] declaring myself unfit which I could but
[43:21] he says we're worthy amen because he is
[43:24] worthy so we're not going to debase our
[43:27] s on looking at this flesh and and the
[43:30] thoughts that we might battle and
[43:32] emotions that we battle you know what
[43:34] I'm talking about amen the devil coming
[43:36] and telling him you're not good enough
[43:38] God would not have chosen you my brother
[43:40] and sister that you you know that didn't
[43:42] come from God he's never going to come
[43:45] now there might be preachers on the
[43:46] earth that believe that cutting you down
[43:49] is the way to make you a better
[43:51] Christian but that's not what the word
[43:52] of God does he corrects us amen but he
[43:56] builds us up he he wants us to lift up
[43:59] to the place that we know that we were
[44:02] called of him before the foundation of
[44:04] the world that we can have a confidence
[44:06] to stand in the day that we're living
[44:09] and know that we are going to be
[44:11] victorious amen there's no reason to go
[44:15] into the battle if you believe you're
[44:18] already
[44:19] defeated amen it's hard I I was just
[44:22] reading in the Old Testament there
[44:25] several different places is connecting
[44:28] together and you know my brother and
[44:30] sister you you'll find in scripture
[44:33] where you know the ammonites were there
[44:35] and they're telling them yeah we'll
[44:37] spare you we'll do this all I need you
[44:40] to do is give up all your rights and let
[44:44] us pluck out your
[44:46] eye and we'll let you live my brother
[44:50] and sister the devil would like to offer
[44:52] you that today that you would not be
[44:54] able to see any further revelation of
[44:57] the word of God but he would leave you
[44:59] in peace otherwise we were called to see
[45:02] the word amen Our Eyes Are Open the
[45:05] light is shining Upon Us you're not here
[45:08] to settle for a life of peace and
[45:11] comfort with not another Revelation from
[45:14] the Lord in our life amen he wants to
[45:17] reveal himself and will reveal himself
[45:20] to us right to the coming of the Lord
[45:23] amen revelation will flow it will come
[45:26] forth because this is a
[45:28] relationship amen now you know we can
[45:31] all kind of I say this a tad bit joking
[45:33] we marry a young woman she's young and
[45:36] pretty has not had children not suffered
[45:39] through the nights of sicknesses and all
[45:41] of these other things the labors of life
[45:43] and we would just like to keep her as
[45:45] that pretty little 20 year-old as she
[45:47] was the day you married her but you see
[45:50] she must
[45:53] mature she has a child it is as a
[45:56] revelation
[45:58] she'll never be the
[46:00] same and she has a relationship with a
[46:04] husband that will leave her never the
[46:08] same you see maybe a poor analogy but
[46:11] these things are in life we don't just
[46:13] come to his place and stop we continue
[46:16] to mature we continue to come forth and
[46:20] that's who we really are my brother and
[46:21] sister that 20 years is just a stage it
[46:25] doesn't stop there and we don't come to
[46:28] the word of God by Revelation our eyes
[46:30] opened and our ears hearing just to come
[46:33] to a place to stop that's a beginning
[46:36] Point that's a place where God says I'm
[46:38] going to take you on through and I'm
[46:40] going to reveal myself to you in this
[46:44] relationship but if we are content to
[46:47] stop at any place along the way and say
[46:49] this is far enough my brother and sister
[46:52] you will not see the revelation of Jesus
[46:56] Christ
[47:02] himself
[47:06] amen so being justified by his grace we
[47:11] should be made HS according to the hope
[47:13] of eternal life now the word should
[47:15] there is actually speaking in a positive
[47:18] context that if we'll do what the word
[47:21] said we will
[47:22] become okay not a hope as in maybe it
[47:26] could come or whatever we just have to
[47:29] follow the word and when we being
[47:31] justified by his grace amen a true
[47:35] justification of Grace now we talk about
[47:38] justification and it's a a stage that we
[47:41] go beyond but you must understand you
[47:43] can't leave that stage out there's no
[47:47] way you leave that stage out now here I
[47:50] just want to just look into the sermon
[47:53] perseverance it's here in a prayer
[47:57] I pray thee God forgive our sin of
[48:00] unbelief long as we have been following
[48:05] thee and we confess Lord that we're way
[48:09] short of the requirements as ministers
[48:12] and as Christians I'm glad he put the
[48:14] ministers first doesn't need to put
[48:16] people down ministers are responsible
[48:19] for a lot of this amen they'll get
[48:22] credit but they'll also face
[48:25] judgment so it's there he's saying we're
[48:27] way short of the requirement as
[48:29] ministers and as Christians so be
[48:31] merciful to us oh merciful god and as a
[48:35] man cried one day uh with a boy with
[48:38] epilepsy said Lord help my unbelief we
[48:41] cry to thee tonight Lord after we read
[48:44] the promises of this precious Bible and
[48:47] see what could be done then we cry help
[48:50] our unbelief send the presence of the
[48:53] Lord Jesus in our midst tonight as we
[48:55] speak on the word and may the word
[48:57] become flesh and our spirit catch it
[49:01] amen you got to catch it amen how much
[49:04] let me put it this way how many times
[49:07] has the word come God speaking from his
[49:10] word I'm not talking about a man but God
[49:13] speaking from his word and it just went
[49:14] on
[49:15] bias amen it went
[49:19] unclaimed if the church had a lost and
[49:21] found it would be
[49:24] full but you see my brother and sister
[49:26] sister we've got to come to the place
[49:28] that the word has come to our flesh
[49:31] Christ alive Amen in our flesh it comes
[49:35] and we have to catch that we got to be
[49:38] in the right Spirit we come to church
[49:40] you know what I'm talking about we have
[49:42] distractions we have struggles we have
[49:44] that and the devil just loves to climb
[49:46] in the car with you on Sunday morning
[49:49] and ride to church with you amen he
[49:51] loves to the devil just loves to anoint
[49:54] that crazy guy that you know
[49:56] everything's wrong in his life and it's
[49:58] everybody else's fault and he wants to
[50:01] cut you off and he wants a this and he
[50:03] wants a that because the devil's trying
[50:05] to catch and
[50:08] condition condition Your
[50:10] Atmosphere my we we serve God Faithfully
[50:14] my brother and sister and we let the
[50:15] devil condition our
[50:17] atmosphere so when it comes to a
[50:19] situation like this what we've got to do
[50:22] is recognize the holy spirit's here and
[50:25] we need to reach out and catch that amen
[50:28] and believe it I don't care if you had a
[50:31] rough morning a rough week a rough month
[50:34] a rough
[50:35] year or think your life has been a rough
[50:38] life you can reach out and catch the
[50:42] Holy Spirit now you say no man can do
[50:45] that yes you can because the wooing of
[50:47] the spirit is there God is here wooing
[50:50] us amen I'm not talking about you know
[50:53] uh the unconverted Heathen that doesn't
[50:56] care about God God I'm talking about you
[50:58] and I that we just stop and say well I I
[51:01] don't know I just didn't get much out of
[51:03] the service did you reach
[51:04] out was you trying to catch a halt of it
[51:07] was you C crying out to the Lord amen so
[51:11] here we are I I want to just pull a
[51:13] couple things out of this as long as we
[51:15] have been following thee and we confess
[51:18] Lord that we're way short of the
[51:20] requirements
[51:27] whose fault is
[51:29] that it's not God's
[51:32] fault we've allowed all kinds of things
[51:35] to come in and we brought them to church
[51:38] with us and we actually allow them to
[51:41] continue to reside in our
[51:46] house you know the spirit of resentment
[51:48] my brother and
[51:50] sister he's content to live in the
[51:52] closet till he wants to come out the
[51:56] spirit of
[51:57] bitterness all of these Spirits we'll
[51:59] just sum it up that way are content to
[52:01] just live in your house in the closet
[52:04] until they see the proper time to come
[52:07] out and when they come out Spirits are
[52:10] expressed in such an incredible way it's
[52:12] almost shocking something of resentments
[52:15] and this and that just suddenly burst
[52:17] forth and we say where did that come
[52:19] from it's been living there the whole
[52:21] time it didn't bust it didn't you know
[52:24] it didn't pick the lock it didn't crawl
[52:27] in through an unlatched window it's been
[52:29] there all the time amen I didn't hit on
[52:33] the title of of the sermon uh it's still
[52:36] I didn't give it a secondary title but a
[52:38] a change in our thinking because you see
[52:41] as we're coming closer to the end of all
[52:43] of this my brother and sister prophecy
[52:46] that Russia would go for the oil now it
[52:49] doesn't take a very bright person to
[52:50] take a ruler and a map and draw the
[52:54] lines it doesn't take a very smart
[52:56] person person to see what's happening in
[52:58] the world today and how it all connects
[53:01] together so what we got to do is stop
[53:04] from our life long enough to see what
[53:08] God has for us we get so caught up in
[53:12] this and so caught up in that amen
[53:14] reminds me of a little story supposedly
[53:16] true of two men standing on the same
[53:20] Corner in a city uh testifying to the
[53:23] people two different signs and as
[53:25] they're there one looks over at the one
[53:27] preacher looks over at the other one's
[53:29] sign and says you know I don't agree
[53:31] with you and the other guy says well I
[53:33] wasn't going to say anything but now
[53:35] that you mention it I don't agree with
[53:37] you and they're both standing there now
[53:41] the Lord is dealing with them because as
[53:43] they're continuing to speak to the
[53:45] people something's working on them God's
[53:48] telling each one of those Is This
[53:53] Love and after a little bit both them
[53:55] men turn to each other and said I think
[53:57] they're that cuz they're budding into
[54:00] each
[54:02] other God is
[54:05] love I
[54:08] believe both of them changed their
[54:10] message on that street corner and
[54:12] started declaring to the people God is
[54:14] love they found Unity on the corner by
[54:18] setting their difference
[54:20] aside now it doesn't mean all difference
[54:23] needs to be tossed out but there's a
[54:25] time and a place a platform for the
[54:28] difference to be dealt with and it
[54:30] starts with prayer because prayer is
[54:32] what changes things and so as it is my
[54:36] brother and sister we come we know what
[54:38] we believe we've had it proven
[54:41] Vindicated to us the word is true but my
[54:44] brother and sister whether this comes to
[54:46] pass just like this or this comes to
[54:48] pass just like this our thoughts don't
[54:50] matter what does God's
[54:53] thoughts that's where we need to come
[54:55] together and say I want to be right in
[54:57] the word I want to I want to know what
[55:00] God thinks about this what God's wanting
[55:02] to say about this and maybe my idea of
[55:05] it is just a little skewered but I want
[55:08] God's thoughts and his thoughts are
[55:11] higher than our thoughts so we can
[55:13] always subject oursel or or surrender to
[55:16] his thoughts amen and so as we look at
[55:21] this as we journey along in this life we
[55:25] experience revelation
[55:27] correct amen sometimes we experience a
[55:30] lot of revelation God is gracious to us
[55:33] opens our eyes tremendously that that we
[55:36] see this uh to have wonderful
[55:39] experiences of the word speaking to us
[55:42] to have questions in our minds for years
[55:45] but yet we're we're able by God's grace
[55:47] to put those up on a shelf not let them
[55:50] distract us from serving God and and as
[55:53] it is that we are we are there and and
[55:56] these things are opening up and then God
[55:58] starts to open up and answer the
[56:00] questions amen how wonderful to
[56:04] experience the opening of the word can
[56:05] we say amen amen it is it is not
[56:08] laborious for us it is beautiful it is
[56:11] glorious Amen to see the word being
[56:14] opened and you know here's the wonderful
[56:17] thing about God he doesn't say now I'm
[56:19] going to give Revelation to this whole
[56:21] church at once but he'll drop Revelation
[56:24] down Revelation down re ration down and
[56:28] sometimes that is concerning certain
[56:30] situations or teachings that we've had
[56:33] or or aspects of our spiritual life and
[56:36] God brings us and we come to that
[56:38] maturity and he drops in a revelation
[56:40] and we move forward so the eban flow of
[56:43] a body of Believers is never stagnant
[56:46] it's not a solid wall moving but it's
[56:48] always
[56:50] alive amen can you say Amen to that the
[56:53] revelation of Jesus Christ is always
[56:56] alive it's always moving and touching
[56:59] and and
[57:00] expressing
[57:01] amen I say the opening of the word to
[57:05] you and I is personal amen we cannot
[57:08] preach as it were a blanket message that
[57:11] you must achieve a certain Thing by a
[57:13] certain time in your spiritual walk my
[57:15] brother and sister God is a personal God
[57:19] Amen he'll save the whole world if
[57:22] they'll give him the opportunity but
[57:23] they don't want the opportunity but
[57:25] there was something something he placed
[57:26] in you and I before the foundation of
[57:28] the world that has a desire to know the
[57:31] things of God and to live not just to
[57:33] know but to live those
[57:36] things amen so the opening of the word
[57:39] is to you personal and sometimes we're
[57:42] overwhelmed by the presence of
[57:45] God Amen but we don't want to be past
[57:48] tense we we refer to that past tense I
[57:50] could give you I could give you examples
[57:53] of past tense why would we look in past
[57:57] tense when we can ask God to come
[58:00] present
[58:02] tense to have the presence of God here
[58:05] in this assembly this morning in such a
[58:08] powerful way that we walk out and know
[58:11] we'll never be the same that's what we
[58:13] should long for amen amen it's not just
[58:17] teaching we need the
[58:20] experience of the presence of the Holy
[58:23] Spirit
[58:24] moving my brother and sister it doesn't
[58:27] have to happen in church
[58:29] alone we can have that experience in our
[58:32] car going down the road all by ourselves
[58:34] amen we don't need someone patting us on
[58:37] the back or someone you know prodding us
[58:39] to go forward amen it's God in you the
[58:43] hope of glory amen it's not God in the
[58:45] church God in the preacher God in this
[58:47] and that it's God in you that is that
[58:50] experience amen so we get to see this
[58:54] and and the opportunity to be
[58:57] overwhelmed by the presence of God is
[59:00] actually with you every day you hold the
[59:04] key to release the presence of God in
[59:07] your
[59:08] life the church doesn't hold it the
[59:11] preachers doesn't hold it somebody in an
[59:14] office somewhere far beyond the world
[59:16] doesn't hold it you hold it amen are you
[59:20] willing to put the key in the lock and
[59:22] unlock the presence of God in your life
[59:25] today amen
[59:26] amen that's what we've got to do we can
[59:29] find plenty of reasons why someone else
[59:32] impacted
[59:34] you I just recently last few days had a
[59:38] conversation sometimes these are a
[59:40] little straightforward God anoints
[59:45] that a young man offering a reason why
[59:47] he wasn't serving God right
[59:51] now then going back and his own self
[59:54] dissecting
[59:56] the things that brought him up to that
[59:57] place to make a
[1:00:03] decision one simple
[1:00:08] Crux if they're going to go to hell are
[1:00:12] you obligated to go with
[1:00:17] them straightforward enough for
[1:00:21] you that's how personal it is we had a
[1:00:25] bad pastor we had a bad experience we
[1:00:27] had a bad this a bad that got nothing to
[1:00:30] do with it it comes down to what is what
[1:00:34] are you going to unlock with the key
[1:00:37] that you've been
[1:00:38] given amen bitterness there all the time
[1:00:41] as we just said it's hiding in the house
[1:00:43] you can open that closet up your own
[1:00:46] self and sweep it clean amen let the
[1:00:48] light of the Gospel shine or you can
[1:00:51] justify that Spirit of bitterness living
[1:00:54] behind closed doors
[1:00:58] I think we have to have a change in our
[1:01:07] thinking we got a lot of reasons why
[1:01:09] we're
[1:01:10] bitter we got a lot of reasons why we're
[1:01:14] disappointed and we got a lot of reasons
[1:01:17] to give it all to Jesus and walk on
[1:01:29] you
[1:01:30] know have you been overwhelmed by the
[1:01:32] presence of God
[1:01:35] Amen now a lot of people will will say
[1:01:38] yes yes I spoke in tongues certainly we
[1:01:41] have nothing against
[1:01:43] that but that doesn't prove that you've
[1:01:45] had an experience that's
[1:01:49] right I won't go into it here but I'll
[1:01:52] tell you there's a very known uh minist
[1:01:56] in the United States in a big service
[1:01:58] there and all of a sudden he starts
[1:02:00] speaking in
[1:02:02] tongues and many people recognized it I
[1:02:04] don't remember now exactly the
[1:02:07] language they said oh that's this
[1:02:10] language well this man who was an
[1:02:12] interpreter for
[1:02:14] living interpreted what the minister was
[1:02:18] saying and it was something on the order
[1:02:21] of go go go away come again some other
[1:02:23] day
[1:02:28] and people are all
[1:02:31] like
[1:02:33] really does that edify the body of
[1:02:36] Christ the scripture says if it's spoke
[1:02:39] in an unknown tongue and there's no real
[1:02:41] true interpretation of it it brings
[1:02:44] confusion we don't want confusion my
[1:02:47] brother and sister we want the word pure
[1:02:50] straightforward unadulterated and
[1:02:53] Powerful amen we can get true truth my
[1:02:56] brother and sister that's so weak amen
[1:02:59] so brought down so Bas that it wouldn't
[1:03:01] deliver nothing and what people like
[1:03:04] that because they can find it in their
[1:03:06] Bible but it's not powerful enough to
[1:03:08] deliver them I want a word amen I
[1:03:11] believe you want a word that's powerful
[1:03:13] enough to drive the spirits out of the
[1:03:16] closet we want the word to come and
[1:03:18] speak to our hearts in such a fashion
[1:03:21] that we can then commit our life fully
[1:03:23] to that stand on that word and say you
[1:03:25] know what I shall not be moved but if
[1:03:28] it's that water down and weak you'll
[1:03:30] find it in
[1:03:31] scripture but you won't find it in power
[1:03:34] enough to deliver
[1:03:37] you don't want it my brother and sister
[1:03:40] if it's been watered
[1:03:44] down now so we experien these Heights
[1:03:46] that the Lord would take us and we've
[1:03:48] all kind of acknowledged that proving
[1:03:50] his word we've stepped out on the limb
[1:03:53] figuratively or out on the ice and and
[1:03:56] God's come and he's proved his word to
[1:03:58] us and I believe everyone that claims to
[1:04:00] be a Christian today needs to have that
[1:04:02] kind of experience where you can say God
[1:04:04] has proved his word to me I don't need
[1:04:07] anyone else I have a personal experience
[1:04:11] or relationship with the Lord and he's
[1:04:13] proved that he's real you see my brother
[1:04:16] and sister you're starting to see this I
[1:04:17] won't name it names or whatever but but
[1:04:20] if you do a little research you're
[1:04:21] starting to see different churches
[1:04:23] they're they're settling in they're
[1:04:25] being I think they call it
[1:04:27] woke and we need to be careful about
[1:04:29] that because uh we read a notice that
[1:04:31] our church had been
[1:04:33] censored because things preached
[1:04:37] here well I'll tell you what if it was
[1:04:39] the
[1:04:41] truth it'll still find its way out
[1:04:45] yeah
[1:04:47] amen I don't think we're allowed to say
[1:04:49] that c o v i
[1:04:54] d i f s f a l s e
[1:05:02] word what they do is they don't know
[1:05:06] what you're talking about but their
[1:05:08] little AI says we don't allow that
[1:05:11] that's like hate speech or uh
[1:05:14] disinformation well I tell you what
[1:05:16] disinformation they ought to censor is
[1:05:19] that water down stuff they call the
[1:05:22] gospel that's what they ought to censor
[1:05:26] but we know what their gospel
[1:05:31] is now let's look at
[1:05:36] this cover this in a sense we know the
[1:05:39] height of the experience that the Lord
[1:05:41] would take us to amen drag us out of
[1:05:44] alleys out of bars out of this out of
[1:05:46] drug deals you know needle tracks this
[1:05:49] that and the other and and Deliver Us
[1:05:51] from that we know where God will go to
[1:05:53] do this but I want you to understand
[1:05:55] understand just as it was with job you
[1:05:58] guys remember job amen we have to
[1:06:01] recognize just how far God is going to
[1:06:05] take
[1:06:06] us to perfect
[1:06:10] us job was already just and
[1:06:14] upright the Lord's already boasting of
[1:06:19] him but the Lord found one little
[1:06:23] Fleck and he said I'm going to burn that
[1:06:25] out of you job never told job that but
[1:06:28] that's what he was speaking and so the
[1:06:30] Trials come and and job faces that and
[1:06:33] in himself he he knows he's he's an
[1:06:36] upright
[1:06:37] man he's not quite understanding what's
[1:06:40] taking place uh why suddenly his world
[1:06:42] is turned up down upside down but you
[1:06:45] see God was showing how far he's willing
[1:06:47] to take even those that he claimed were
[1:06:50] like perfect and upright before him he
[1:06:53] says oh there's something there back to
[1:06:55] the
[1:06:57] furnace amen aren't you all excited
[1:06:59] about the
[1:07:00] furnace
[1:07:01] amen amen the Lord's going to take us
[1:07:05] where he needs to take us to prove his
[1:07:07] word amen he's not going to stop short
[1:07:10] because of your
[1:07:11] feelings okay I hope I don't hurt
[1:07:13] anybody's feelings this morning but I'm
[1:07:15] going to tell you right now God does not
[1:07:18] care about your feelings he cares about
[1:07:21] your position in his word amen which is
[1:07:25] is your position in him am that's what
[1:07:29] he cares about amen your feelings he'll
[1:07:32] rub a little savv on that later amen now
[1:07:36] job 19
[1:07:39] 23-27 he said oh this is job little
[1:07:42] later down the road oh that my words
[1:07:44] were now written oh that they were
[1:07:46] printed in a
[1:07:49] book that they were Graven with an iron
[1:07:51] pin and led in the rock forever for I
[1:07:55] know that my redeemer liveth and that he
[1:07:58] shall stand at the latter day upon the
[1:08:01] Earth and though after my skin worms
[1:08:04] destroy this body yet in my flesh shall
[1:08:07] I see God now look at verse 27 to me
[1:08:11] this is very Pro profound whom I shall
[1:08:16] see for myself yes amen not what the
[1:08:21] preacher told me not what this one said
[1:08:24] not what that one thought but to see it
[1:08:26] for himself amen for you and I to be
[1:08:30] able to see God in his majesty see him
[1:08:33] in his preeminence to see him in his
[1:08:35] glory and to know that when he took you
[1:08:38] back to the fiery furnace when he took
[1:08:41] you back to that and you were scraping
[1:08:44] your boils and when you were struggling
[1:08:46] and wondering why to know that God is so
[1:08:48] perfect that we can say Lord there has
[1:08:50] to be a reason and I'm going to be here
[1:08:53] to see the glory of the word manifested
[1:08:57] in me amen it's not then that it will be
[1:09:01] I'll go to church and the preacher will
[1:09:03] tell me why but you will see why for
[1:09:06] yourself and mine eyes Shall Behold and
[1:09:09] not another though my Reigns be consumed
[1:09:12] within me my brother and sister are we
[1:09:16] there
[1:09:22] yet I'll just have to leave that
[1:09:24] question for you to answer
[1:09:28] but I have a sneaky little feeling if we
[1:09:31] can go by
[1:09:34] feelings we've got a few more trials
[1:09:39] coming we got a few more days that we
[1:09:43] question why we were
[1:09:45] born imagine a man such as job and his
[1:09:49] position his status and how people
[1:09:51] looked at him and how he served God and
[1:09:54] he gave and he helped and he did and
[1:09:57] then all of a sudden they're thinking is
[1:09:59] skewed a little bit and they're
[1:10:00] wondering does job have a secret
[1:10:04] sin and we literally could say yes he
[1:10:16] did you know what God says about
[1:10:21] you he's telling the devil
[1:10:23] today the per perfect amen they're
[1:10:27] upright they're righteous
[1:10:31] amen
[1:10:34] but I'll go ahead and let you pull the
[1:10:36] Hedge
[1:10:37] back 2024 God is still letting the devil
[1:10:42] pull the Hedge
[1:10:45] back because you see the Lord's not
[1:10:49] going to be
[1:10:50] satisfied until every bit of
[1:10:53] dross every bit of us has been burnt out
[1:10:58] of
[1:11:00] us amen and it sounds almost like God is
[1:11:04] cruel but God is love amen
[1:11:08] amen because to be
[1:11:11] perfect In His
[1:11:14] Image well that's
[1:11:18] self-explanatory we're going to have to
[1:11:19] be
[1:11:21] perfect and the word will bring us to
[1:11:23] that place amen and you know people
[1:11:26] think that Christians there's so many
[1:11:27] people think that Christians are just
[1:11:31] wimps it's so easy to serve the
[1:11:35] devil see how Satan even Twisted that
[1:11:38] one
[1:11:39] around oh you've got to be you've got to
[1:11:42] be weak to serve God no you got to be
[1:11:45] weak to serve the
[1:11:47] devil because you can just let
[1:11:51] go you know when we were kids I hope
[1:11:53] this little analogy fits when we were
[1:11:55] kids they don't allow it anymore but we
[1:11:57] used to swim in the lowline canal you
[1:12:00] know the one that runs out the bottom of
[1:12:01] Lake L we would swim in that and I I
[1:12:04] used to be I'd probably drown a quarter
[1:12:07] of the way across now but I used to be a
[1:12:09] good enough swimmer to climb in above
[1:12:11] the check and swim straight across the
[1:12:14] canal and climb out the other
[1:12:17] side now my brother and sister you would
[1:12:20] get there in the middle swimming for all
[1:12:23] your worth I mean all your worth and
[1:12:26] it's trying to sweep you Downstream and
[1:12:28] in your mind there was no pain you just
[1:12:31] went down through the check and got out
[1:12:33] below it but you'd swim for all your wor
[1:12:35] but there was something inside of you
[1:12:37] says I can do it and you just kept going
[1:12:41] your muscles are burning starting to
[1:12:43] hurt and then all of a sudden you
[1:12:44] realize it's getting a little simpler a
[1:12:47] little easier and finally you get to the
[1:12:49] other
[1:12:50] side now I don't make much of the fact
[1:12:54] that I was able to do that as a young
[1:12:56] man I was a scrawny little runt there
[1:12:59] wasn't a whole lot of me to propel
[1:13:00] across
[1:13:01] there but my brother and sister that
[1:13:04] same spirit is in you that when it seems
[1:13:08] like it's time to give up everything in
[1:13:11] your life says give up your circumstance
[1:13:14] says give up when your energy level is
[1:13:16] so low you thinking I can't go one step
[1:13:20] further I'm going to give
[1:13:22] up something inside of you says I can't
[1:13:25] yet I've got to keep going I've got to
[1:13:28] put there's more in me than I thought
[1:13:31] there was there's more of Christ in me
[1:13:34] than I realize I can't quit now do you
[1:13:38] know what I'm talking about amen and God
[1:13:40] is moving on this did you know that kind
[1:13:43] of spirit is
[1:13:46] contagious just as negative Spirits
[1:13:50] spirits of fear and
[1:13:52] anxiety doubts that they're all
[1:13:55] contagious like the
[1:13:58] flu and
[1:14:00] Faith while it's an individual
[1:14:03] event individual
[1:14:06] Affair it's
[1:14:11] contagious cold formal
[1:14:15] Contagious on fire
[1:14:18] contagious we got to decide Grace
[1:14:21] Tabernacle are we going to change our
[1:14:23] thinking or just settle into to a rut
[1:14:26] and call it good and say we did our
[1:14:28] best I don't think we've done our best I
[1:14:31] hope I'm not preaching too hard to
[1:14:33] anyone today but I don't believe we've
[1:14:35] done our best I believe there's more in
[1:14:37] us more of Christ in us to be expressed
[1:14:40] than we even
[1:14:42] realize and it's time for us to rise up
[1:14:45] to the occasion and turn Christ loose in
[1:14:48] us turn Christ loose in our church amen
[1:14:52] let it impact lives not just oh they're
[1:14:54] Christians but to the world to know
[1:14:56] they're different and I I've got over
[1:14:59] the point that it matters whether people
[1:15:01] think doesn't matter whether people
[1:15:02] think I'm weird or
[1:15:04] not because I know they're
[1:15:12] weird you see job come to that place he
[1:15:15] says whom I shall see for myself there's
[1:15:17] Revelation expressed right there in
[1:15:19] those words I will see him amen amen not
[1:15:24] hope to see him I will see him amen how
[1:15:28] glorious it is to be in his presence
[1:15:30] amen hallelujah now I'm not here to like
[1:15:32] boast because I was there but I tell you
[1:15:35] my brother and sister as I've shared
[1:15:37] with you through the years we have seen
[1:15:39] broken bones healed we have seen
[1:15:41] diseased eyes corrected we have seen all
[1:15:45] kinds of things the list could go on and
[1:15:48] on and on that we've seen and we allow
[1:15:50] the gospel the power of God to become so
[1:15:53] common to us that we just just go
[1:15:56] oh it ought to put us on fire it ought
[1:15:59] to put us to say if God healed that
[1:16:01] person he'll heal that one he'll heal
[1:16:03] that one and he'll Heal Me amen but the
[1:16:07] Devil comes and tones that so down that
[1:16:09] we don't want to just get too caught up
[1:16:12] or carried away it's time for us to
[1:16:14] change our thinking amen it's time for
[1:16:17] us to realize amen this world we live in
[1:16:21] according to scripture is
[1:16:23] cursed it's going to
[1:16:25] burn amen the world we live in also has
[1:16:29] toned that down that there's no hell and
[1:16:31] no real
[1:16:33] judgment my brother and sister that's
[1:16:35] not what my Bible says my Bible says
[1:16:38] there is a judgment
[1:16:43] amen and when we see the presence of God
[1:16:45] it's glorious I say it is
[1:16:50] glorious doesn't seem so glorious to get
[1:16:53] sent back
[1:16:55] to the
[1:16:56] furnace amen that doesn't seem so
[1:16:59] glorious in fact we often say what did I
[1:17:01] do wrong well it ain't what you did
[1:17:05] wrong it's what God's doing right in
[1:17:10] you amen we don't get the dross out of
[1:17:12] the
[1:17:14] gold by patting it on the
[1:17:17] back you pound on it you burn
[1:17:22] it amen
[1:17:25] how do you know when gold is hot
[1:17:28] enough when it starts to
[1:17:32] oxidize that means when the original
[1:17:35] content or structure starts to evaporate
[1:17:40] from the presence of
[1:17:42] heat can any of us say we've been that
[1:17:46] far in the
[1:17:50] furnace believe it or not some of you
[1:17:52] might be thinking nope nope I'm here to
[1:17:53] tell you yes yes yes yes because you see
[1:17:56] the dross of the old man is slowly going
[1:18:01] away slowly disappearing from our
[1:18:05] lives we're changed people
[1:18:09] amen oh so make mistakes isn't it
[1:18:12] interesting the devil likes to anoint
[1:18:14] people that Christians would not make
[1:18:16] mistakes when they see a mistake they
[1:18:18] must not be a Christian
[1:18:23] but I don't where let's go look at the
[1:18:27] track record of the
[1:18:29] Apostles none of them were real true
[1:18:31] Apostles Jesus was just making them
[1:18:34] happy by calling them his no my brother
[1:18:37] and sister every one of them had a flaw
[1:18:39] amen amen and God used him in spite of
[1:18:42] the flaw God used him even when the flaw
[1:18:44] was really obvious when Peter stood
[1:18:48] before the Lord and made the statements
[1:18:50] that he made Jesus rebukes him
[1:18:56] was the flaw fixed that
[1:18:58] day
[1:19:02] no but when he denied
[1:19:05] Christ something gripped him so
[1:19:09] strongly that he wept like he never wept
[1:19:14] before a changed
[1:19:17] man Grace Tabernacle do we want to be
[1:19:21] changed amen
[1:19:27] I kind of already touched this here I
[1:19:28] have another side note the Lord's not
[1:19:30] really concerned about our feelings he's
[1:19:32] concerned about our
[1:19:36] position what a
[1:19:38] paradox because we are very concerned
[1:19:42] about our
[1:19:44] feelings in fact many times we're less
[1:19:47] concerned about our
[1:19:48] position than we are our
[1:19:51] feelings in other words if we needed to
[1:19:53] protect something we wouldn't protect
[1:19:55] our position we would protect our
[1:19:59] feelings just absolutely contrary to
[1:20:01] what we really need in her life I feel I
[1:20:06] feel I feel instead of Lord where am I
[1:20:11] at and if I'm not in the right place
[1:20:13] Lord put me in the right place let my
[1:20:17] feelings go to this side I need my
[1:20:20] proper position in Jesus Christ
[1:20:25] but sometimes our feelings are
[1:20:27] Paramount they're right at the
[1:20:32] top and We
[1:20:34] complain about the
[1:20:37] furnace when we got it so
[1:20:39] backwards we should be saying Thank You
[1:20:43] Lord I'm delivered from my feelings
[1:20:45] that's right the furnace did its job and
[1:20:48] I'm so
[1:20:50] thankful but quite the
[1:20:53] opposite H I think there was a reason my
[1:20:57] brother and sister God Shadrach Meshach
[1:20:59] and
[1:21:00] Abednego never told him what was
[1:21:04] coming yeah so they're they're just
[1:21:07] worshiping they're not going to go back
[1:21:09] on the word they come to the furnace and
[1:21:13] how it must be that all the men throwing
[1:21:16] them in the furnace are dying from the
[1:21:21] heat but in the presence of the
[1:21:26] Flames it gave Liberty Amen to Shadrach
[1:21:30] and meach burnt the bonds off of them
[1:21:36] amen and there was Christ
[1:21:39] amen amen I'm telling you that be you'd
[1:21:42] have to be
[1:21:43] convinced you know when that big Burly
[1:21:47] kind of reminds me of the day and age we
[1:21:48] live in you know the the big Burly
[1:21:52] policeman you know little scrawny guy
[1:21:55] amen I seen a little news clip the other
[1:21:57] day it took three of them to drag a 98b
[1:21:59] girl away now my brother and sister you
[1:22:03] never know what the anointing was but
[1:22:05] that in my mind is a Shadrach and mhack
[1:22:08] moment they're Overkill they got these
[1:22:11] big Burly guys that work out and they're
[1:22:13] strong and you guys are going in the
[1:22:15] flame and next thing you know they're
[1:22:17] laying their
[1:22:18] dead and Shak mesach ior
[1:22:22] like what do we do for from
[1:22:26] here but there was always that one
[1:22:28] that's anointed to make sure you're
[1:22:29] going to land in the fire if it kills
[1:22:32] them and it
[1:22:38] does First Peter 17 says that the trial
[1:22:42] of your faith being much more precious
[1:22:44] than that of gold that perished though
[1:22:47] be tried with fire might be found into
[1:22:49] praise and honor and Glory at the
[1:22:52] appearing of Jesus Christ see so we
[1:22:55] don't necessarily see here Saints what
[1:22:58] God is doing in our
[1:23:00] life some of this doesn't even really
[1:23:03] come out until the appearing of our Lord
[1:23:06] Jesus
[1:23:08] Christ which means it should be showing
[1:23:10] because he's here that's
[1:23:12] right but sometimes what God did a fiery
[1:23:16] trial yesterday amen the fiery trial
[1:23:20] yesterday might not show you its
[1:23:22] fruit for a while
[1:23:26] but it will show you fruit
[1:23:31] [Music]
[1:23:36] amen now as we read in the quote
[1:23:40] there says we're way short of where we
[1:23:42] should
[1:23:44] be I tell you what I'm going to
[1:23:46] do I'm going to stand before you and I'm
[1:23:49] going to lift my hand and tell you I
[1:23:51] recognize I'm way short amen of where I
[1:23:54] should
[1:23:56] be but I want the Lord to bring me where
[1:23:59] I should be I want to be who and what
[1:24:02] I'm supposed to be and I want you to do
[1:24:05] it sooner Lord that's right than
[1:24:09] later you see but the human
[1:24:11] element will cause
[1:24:14] us to pull
[1:24:18] back we as Christians have a choice to
[1:24:22] make we get run to the Lord or we get to
[1:24:26] run away from the
[1:24:29] Lord and so when we run away from the
[1:24:32] Lord we just get to face the trial again
[1:24:35] the Lord will just let you Gallop off
[1:24:37] into the desert and then you'll find a
[1:24:39] little nicer Trail than the one you was
[1:24:41] on a little nicer Trail than the one you
[1:24:43] was on until you realize you're right
[1:24:46] back where you
[1:24:49] started yeah oh and the nicer Trails
[1:24:52] always go downhill
[1:24:55] that's that's where nice Trails they're
[1:24:57] wide somebody else has taking all the
[1:24:59] stones out and they go downhill going to
[1:25:01] bring you right back where you were amen
[1:25:03] why
[1:25:05] run
[1:25:06] amen so what are we going to do well
[1:25:09] according to the word that I read says
[1:25:11] that we're going to confess what the
[1:25:13] word says are you going to confess the
[1:25:15] word amen it says that we're healed and
[1:25:18] delivered it says that we're Victorious
[1:25:22] amen hallelujah I love this when you
[1:25:25] come down Revelations 2 and 3 every one
[1:25:30] of those seven
[1:25:33] churches was focused to the
[1:25:39] Overcomer every one of them every one of
[1:25:41] them with reward Focus to the Overcomer
[1:25:44] amen amen what's the devil want to tell
[1:25:47] you wow that Overcomer things overrated
[1:25:49] no my brother and sister it's an
[1:25:51] ingredient that the word has placed that
[1:25:55] it is there to be an overcomer and you
[1:25:58] read for this age Overcomers amen I'm
[1:26:03] going to stand up even if I don't feel
[1:26:04] like it and say I'm an overcomer amen
[1:26:07] I've overcome sickness I've overcome
[1:26:09] every kind of sickness I've overcome
[1:26:11] everything that would hinder me I've
[1:26:13] overcome it you say okay if you overcome
[1:26:16] it where's it at I don't always know
[1:26:18] where it's at but I know it's in the
[1:26:19] word that's right and I know I'm a Son
[1:26:21] of God so therefore I know I have
[1:26:24] overcome that because he has already
[1:26:27] declared this is a finished work and in
[1:26:29] a finished work my brother and sister is
[1:26:32] no room for
[1:26:37] error
[1:26:39] hallelujah oh wait just a second I want
[1:26:41] I want to offer you an
[1:26:44] alternative we could confess our
[1:26:46] feelings
[1:26:56] yeah we could confess our
[1:26:59] feelings I don't
[1:27:04] feel
[1:27:06] yeah I didn't feel like you know what
[1:27:08] alarm clock went off this
[1:27:10] morning my feelings
[1:27:12] said I ain't doing
[1:27:17] it and then I
[1:27:19] remembered if I wasn't going to do it I
[1:27:22] needed to have called brother
[1:27:26] David
[1:27:28] earlier I know he gets up early but
[1:27:30] calling him at you know 4:49 to say I've
[1:27:34] decided I don't feel like preaching
[1:27:38] today yeah or feelings I don't mean to
[1:27:42] put sister Jerry under the bus but I've
[1:27:44] threw her there so many times she's very
[1:27:46] familiar with
[1:27:50] it if I only ate
[1:27:54] when sister Jerry felt like
[1:28:00] cooking I'd be skinnier than I am now I
[1:28:03] guarantee
[1:28:04] you but you know she doesn't go by
[1:28:08] feelings she fixes me a meal and
[1:28:11] sometimes they're just
[1:28:13] Grand sometimes not
[1:28:18] so but the point is see she's not being
[1:28:21] my wife by feelings
[1:28:24] right she's not taking care of me on her
[1:28:27] feelings amen she recognizes that she
[1:28:31] made a vow committed herself to that
[1:28:34] that's right I don't get up and go to
[1:28:37] work if I feel like it otherwise we
[1:28:39] would be living in a wore out camper
[1:28:41] trailer in some alley or back road or
[1:28:44] Canal bank CU I just don't feel like it
[1:28:48] anymore H I'm getting off Melancholy
[1:28:52] here so let's just stop
[1:28:55] see we don't confess our
[1:28:57] feelings I tell you what when we confess
[1:29:00] the word that's reality to the
[1:29:02] believer amen and the other one is a
[1:29:04] false reality of this
[1:29:07] age where grown men won't get out of bed
[1:29:10] and go to work their wives
[1:29:12] do amen where men have become sissies
[1:29:16] amen and their wives have become
[1:29:19] masculine or I should say just the woman
[1:29:22] maybe not their wife you see the whole
[1:29:24] shift of the dynamic my brother and
[1:29:26] sister and what we've got to do is make
[1:29:29] sure we don't allow that kind of
[1:29:31] thinking to come into our Christian
[1:29:33] experience amen where we come now let's
[1:29:36] type that feminine as the
[1:29:39] church where the church becomes
[1:29:41] dominant and we don't expect much out of
[1:29:44] Christ we don't expect much out of the
[1:29:47] word we don't expect deliverance from
[1:29:49] Spirit we don't expect healings we don't
[1:29:51] just our our young people are or maybe
[1:29:54] those that have already left we're not
[1:29:56] expecting them to come back well I'll
[1:29:58] tell you I got a brother good friend of
[1:30:00] mine that's a pastor of a church and you
[1:30:02] know there a lot of people was there
[1:30:04] they lamented for the longest time of
[1:30:07] how many young people had left their
[1:30:08] church over the years and went out in
[1:30:11] the world but I tell you what happened
[1:30:12] they found Revival in their church and
[1:30:15] their young people are coming back
[1:30:18] they're walking in the door they're not
[1:30:19] being wooed by some program they're
[1:30:21] walking in the door and saying I I
[1:30:24] realize I got to serve God but maybe
[1:30:27] they've been gone 10 12 15 years and in
[1:30:30] that time people tend to kind of give
[1:30:34] up God doesn't give up God says I'll let
[1:30:37] him go for a season the season will be
[1:30:39] the link that I determine it that's
[1:30:41] right and then they're coming back
[1:30:44] because I determined it amen well I
[1:30:47] think we as a church ought to have amen
[1:30:50] more faith in God we ought to have more
[1:30:52] trust in God because God God is in
[1:30:54] control not you and I oh this is a
[1:30:57] pastor's decision it's God's
[1:31:00] decision amen for the word to become
[1:31:04] reality oh sorry I didn't think I had
[1:31:06] enough to preach you're were right
[1:31:08] Jerry yeah I made a comment to her I
[1:31:11] just don't have much this morning and
[1:31:12] she's like don't say
[1:31:15] that first John
[1:31:19] 1 we'll be
[1:31:21] closing 1 John 1 that which was from the
[1:31:24] beginning which we have heard which we
[1:31:26] have seen with our eyes which we have
[1:31:28] looked upon and our hands have handled
[1:31:31] of the word of life for the life was
[1:31:33] manifested I say amen and we have seen
[1:31:36] it amen and we bear witness amen and
[1:31:40] show unto you that eternal life which
[1:31:42] was with the father and was manifested
[1:31:45] unto us that which we have seen and
[1:31:48] heard declare we unto you that ye Also
[1:31:51] may have fellowship with us truly
[1:31:54] Fellowship is with the father and with
[1:31:56] his son Jesus Christ and these things
[1:31:59] write we unto you that your
[1:32:01] joyen amen this just not for the
[1:32:04] preacher to say boy I told them no my
[1:32:07] brother and sister this is so that the
[1:32:09] people can rejoice in the word rejoice
[1:32:12] in the liberty of being set free amen
[1:32:14] the chains are
[1:32:16] broken amen then this is the message
[1:32:19] which we have heard of him and declare
[1:32:21] unto you that God is light and in him is
[1:32:23] no Darkness at all if we say that we
[1:32:26] have fellowship with him and walk in
[1:32:28] darkness we lie that's right and do not
[1:32:30] the truth amen but if we walk in the
[1:32:32] light as he is in the light we have
[1:32:35] Fellowship one with another and the
[1:32:38] blood of Jesus Christ the his son
[1:32:41] cleanses us from all sin amen whoa did
[1:32:46] you see that yes
[1:32:48] sir you don't got to be super Christian
[1:32:51] you don't got to be super spiritual or
[1:32:53] super smart
[1:32:54] SM you just need to walk in the light
[1:32:59] amen amen oh I know it maybe isn't as
[1:33:03] easy as that sounded but if you would
[1:33:05] set your mind single-mindedly not on
[1:33:08] this challenge of life not on that
[1:33:11] challenge of life not on that challenge
[1:33:13] of life but saying here's the light I'm
[1:33:15] going to walk in the light and the light
[1:33:18] is going to cleanse me amen now think
[1:33:20] about medical science today my brother
[1:33:22] and sister they're using light bler yes
[1:33:26] sir to
[1:33:27] purify to
[1:33:29] cut to do all kinds of things
[1:33:32] light now we walk in the light my
[1:33:35] brother and sister well let me just go
[1:33:37] on here and if we say we have no sin we
[1:33:39] deceive ourselves and the truth is not
[1:33:41] in us if we confess our sins he is
[1:33:43] faithful and just to forgive us our sins
[1:33:46] and to cleanse us from all
[1:33:48] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[1:33:50] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[1:33:52] word is not in US amen amen I would say
[1:33:55] today Lord help our
[1:33:57] unbelief amen that we could come here
[1:34:00] look a continued walk in the light is a
[1:34:03] continual cleansing that's right amen
[1:34:09] exactly got to look Beyond yourself
[1:34:12] that's
[1:34:13] right you got to look beyond what is
[1:34:16] your hangup that's
[1:34:19] it we got to have a change of our
[1:34:22] thinking
[1:34:26] well I'll tell you
[1:34:29] what I just can't live
[1:34:35] it I can't live
[1:34:37] it I'm going to
[1:34:39] quit because I can't live it you got a
[1:34:42] wrong
[1:34:44] Revelation it's not the right
[1:34:46] Revelation Satan anointing a person to
[1:34:48] say I I just can't live it I I have some
[1:34:51] things that just kind of keep popping up
[1:34:52] in my life I just can't live and I'm
[1:34:54] going to
[1:34:55] quit that's not what the word
[1:34:57] says word says just keep
[1:35:00] walking just keep
[1:35:02] walking Satan would anoint you say I
[1:35:05] can't do it the Holy Spirit anoint you
[1:35:09] just keep
[1:35:10] walking just keep
[1:35:14] walking but look I I have I have these
[1:35:17] failures just keep walking amen
[1:35:25] but but
[1:35:27] no just keep
[1:35:32] walking you know the church has two
[1:35:39] flaws we want to clean them before we
[1:35:41] catch
[1:35:43] them and after we catch
[1:35:46] them we think they should be perfect
[1:35:55] and someone somewhere said
[1:36:00] amen it's two flaws of the
[1:36:03] church you name the name of being a
[1:36:07] Christian there you
[1:36:09] are but here it says if we keep walking
[1:36:12] we'll be
[1:36:13] cleansed that means somewhere along the
[1:36:15] line they walk in the door an unbeliever
[1:36:19] God does an incredible work in their
[1:36:21] life we expect him from that day on to
[1:36:23] be
[1:36:24] perfect and God is saying you just keep
[1:36:27] walking in this
[1:36:30] light imagine how in our minds we think
[1:36:33] that a person would not be spiritual
[1:36:36] after 30 40 Years of serving God that
[1:36:39] they still maybe have a little thing in
[1:36:43] their
[1:36:44] life now we wouldn't go into what those
[1:36:46] things are but patience is one that
[1:36:48] comes to
[1:36:50] mind after 40 years a man should be so
[1:36:56] patient that you could just do anything
[1:36:59] to him and he would say thank you
[1:37:02] brother but instead you see the flicker
[1:37:05] in his eyes and realize that he's either
[1:37:08] going to strangle you or knock you over
[1:37:10] the
[1:37:10] hedge and therefore he's not
[1:37:14] saved without ever considering your
[1:37:18] part in that
[1:37:21] equation how easy it is
[1:37:25] is could we use a change in our
[1:37:29] thinking could we use a change that
[1:37:31] would come and say you know what brother
[1:37:33] I don't mean to be rude Sister Sister to
[1:37:36] Sister whatever her brother
[1:37:39] appropriately I see you're struggling
[1:37:42] I'm not here judgmental let's just keep
[1:37:44] it to brother to brother I see you're
[1:37:46] struggling I'm not here
[1:37:48] judgmental I'm here let me help you amen
[1:37:53] because as you are going forward I am
[1:37:57] going forward and we'll both be cleansed
[1:38:01] amen God working in the body amen a
[1:38:05] change of our
[1:38:06] thinking a
[1:38:09] judgmental pose that we
[1:38:12] take as I see sin in their own life but
[1:38:14] yet we fail as the scripture says to
[1:38:18] remove those things that we become so
[1:38:21] familiar with
[1:38:24] we think it's part of the
[1:38:26] landscape because we see it but you
[1:38:30] don't
[1:38:31] realize as you
[1:38:33] judge oh no no we won't be judged we're
[1:38:37] Believers yes you will be
[1:38:40] judged the word judges everyone and
[1:38:42] judgment's passed either now or
[1:38:45] there amen Lord pass it now amen let us
[1:38:50] yield to the word of God now
[1:38:54] amen you see because it's not our
[1:38:57] righteousness
[1:38:59] amen Pardon Me Maybe This is not for you
[1:39:02] maybe it's somewhere Over the
[1:39:05] Mountain but we get caught up in our
[1:39:10] righteousness somehow we judge ourselves
[1:39:13] deem ourselves just a little bit better
[1:39:16] than the next
[1:39:18] man without God's grace we are filthy
[1:39:22] rags
[1:39:28] have I been sufficiently honest this
[1:39:39] morning let's go to
[1:39:42] it becometh us to fulfill all
[1:39:48] righteousness because of time I want to
[1:39:50] skip forward musicians if you would come
[1:39:58] it's not that long we'll just read it
[1:40:01] Christ was God's testimony because God
[1:40:03] was in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:40:05] himself now he says suffer this to be so
[1:40:08] John that is right in other words John
[1:40:10] you're a mighty man you're a great
[1:40:12] Mighty prophet and your revelation of me
[1:40:15] is exactly the truth you know who I am
[1:40:17] you know because your ministry didn't
[1:40:19] come from man your ministry came from
[1:40:21] God you never learned it of man
[1:40:23] you wasn't taught this in a seminary but
[1:40:27] at the age of 9 years old you went out
[1:40:29] into the Wilderness because you were
[1:40:30] born in odd peculiar child who's nine
[1:40:33] around
[1:40:34] here who's close to nine around
[1:40:38] here
[1:40:40] Yan sorry to skip over
[1:40:43] yanessa but I don't see you going out in
[1:40:45] the
[1:40:46] wilderness imagine one of these boys 9
[1:40:50] years old so-called of God anointed
[1:40:54] to go to the
[1:40:57] Wilderness and God turned him imagine
[1:41:00] all the things that he experienced
[1:41:02] coming
[1:41:03] up and he knew God was with him amen I'm
[1:41:07] going to include you Nessa you're right
[1:41:10] there you know it's
[1:41:12] [Music]
[1:41:14] God it's not an accident not a
[1:41:17] fluke not
[1:41:20] lucky but knowing it's God in your life
[1:41:25] knowing god is present and he's
[1:41:27] powerful and he would never lie to you
[1:41:31] and he gives you the strength to go in
[1:41:32] that Wilderness and come out as a mighty
[1:41:37] man you know who I am you know because
[1:41:39] your ministry didn't come from man your
[1:41:41] ministry came from God you never learned
[1:41:43] it of man you wasn't taught this in a
[1:41:45] seminary but at the age of 9 years old
[1:41:47] you went in the wilderness because you
[1:41:48] were born an odd peculiar child and from
[1:41:51] your very birth God began to to deal
[1:41:53] with you even before your birth the
[1:41:55] prophet saw you and you are a light of
[1:41:59] this
[1:42:00] day and in the wilderness you know who I
[1:42:03] am because God in the wilderness told
[1:42:05] you there would be a sign following me
[1:42:08] you've already bore witness of it you
[1:42:10] know it and we know who each other are
[1:42:13] we know each other and then it is true
[1:42:16] that you need to be baptized of me but
[1:42:19] let's suffer that to be so for John if
[1:42:21] we are the lights of of this day we must
[1:42:26] fulfill all
[1:42:34] righteousness now I don't mean to twist
[1:42:36] any words
[1:42:37] here but who
[1:42:39] could literally lift a hand and say I'm
[1:42:44] righteous see such a paradox we should
[1:42:47] everyone have our hand
[1:42:49] up but you see our flesh step to the
[1:42:53] Forefront and says no
[1:42:56] way no
[1:43:00] way but the word says that's
[1:43:03] right now are we going to listen to the
[1:43:05] word yes or our flesh amen oh my brother
[1:43:09] and
[1:43:11] sister let's go on
[1:43:15] here if you are the lights of this day
[1:43:17] we must fulfill all righteousness all
[1:43:20] God's word must be fulfilled by us for
[1:43:23] this day for it is becoming to us
[1:43:25] behooving it's becoming it's like us
[1:43:29] amen for if we are the true Witnesses of
[1:43:32] God today John we are the lights of this
