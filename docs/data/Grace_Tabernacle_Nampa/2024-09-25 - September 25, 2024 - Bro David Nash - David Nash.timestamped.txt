[28:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[28:28] and father you've given us your word
[28:30] that whatsoever thing we ask we can
[28:33] have and you gave us a promise that if
[28:35] there's even two or three of us here
[28:37] tonight that you'll be here in our
[28:41] midst so father if there's anything
[28:44] we've done to grieve away your Holy
[28:47] Spirit God forgive
[28:49] us wash our hearts wash our lives and if
[28:52] there's condemnation father in our
[28:55] hearts you said greater
[28:59] is your word greater are you than our
[29:02] hearts so let the greatness of our Lord
[29:05] Jesus Christ be with us from this moment
[29:08] on in every heart and every life and as
[29:12] I approach your
[29:13] word father reading from the Holy
[29:16] Scripture Lord
[29:19] today he said the voice of your
[29:22] beloved call in Lord to your bride Let
[29:25] It Be Your Voice tonight speak into to
[29:28] your bride to your your people to those
[29:31] online to whoever would be listening if
[29:34] there's someone there you don't know
[29:36] Christ
[29:38] please surrender your heart just
[29:41] now as we proceed for this service in
[29:45] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[29:48] amen God bless you it's wonderful to see
[29:52] yall you had our assistant pastor this
[29:55] last Sunday did he do okay he always I
[29:58] always ask him well how'd you do and he
[30:00] said well nobody
[30:02] left so uh he feeds us well at home he
[30:07] takes a lot of the services there so I
[30:09] hope he did you well maybe I'll just add
[30:11] a little dessert to it um God bless each
[30:15] and every one of you uh we spoke on
[30:17] these things up there this weekend while
[30:20] he was down
[30:22] here uh a little different twist I
[30:25] thought it was you know sometimes a guy
[30:28] do things the same but the Lord sort of
[30:29] turned it around a little bit this
[30:31] afternoon so while not to keep you
[30:34] standing but God bless every one of you
[30:36] and I always like to think of it as you
[30:39] know prophet of God said that
[30:41] our uh you know three of our greatest
[30:44] gifts were you know Salvation through
[30:46] Christ a a good maid or a loving family
[30:50] like that and then the other thing he
[30:51] said is our
[30:52] time I want to thank you before we even
[30:55] start just for you coming and sharing
[30:58] your time with me CU that's a great
[31:03] gift from you to me so God bless you if
[31:06] we turn to Song of
[31:09] Solomon thank you musicians it was
[31:11] beautiful wonderful thank
[31:13] you I so enjoy the the violins and not
[31:18] no guitar tonight but if he was here I'd
[31:20] be praising him too know Song of Solomon
[31:24] is not
[31:25] a a real big book
[31:28] it's not that many
[31:31] chapters but it's so rich and so full
[31:34] because it talks about the
[31:37] relationship of Jesus Christ and his
[31:40] bride sister Sue God bless you good to
[31:43] see you
[31:45] too she's short there I almost missed
[31:47] her looking over the TV thing here God
[31:51] bless
[31:52] you and so it's talking about a
[31:56] relationship of Christ
[31:58] and the
[32:00] bride and when we think about what the
[32:04] Christian walk is all about is a
[32:06] relationship with God so if we could
[32:09] turn to chapter two I'll
[32:12] read about three verses there I believe
[32:15] it
[32:16] is we'll start out with the first
[32:19] one is everybody there I am the rose of
[32:22] Sharon and the lily of the valleys as a
[32:24] lily among the Thorns so is my love
[32:28] among the daughters and we'll drop down
[32:30] to verse 8 the voice of my beloved
[32:33] behold he come leaping upon the
[32:35] mountains skipping upon the
[32:39] hills and then I had
[32:41] uh one other one there I think it's
[32:44] verse 14 oh my Dove that art in the
[32:48] casss of the Rock in the secret places
[32:50] of the stairs let me see thy countenance
[32:53] let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy
[32:56] voice and and th countenance is
[33:00] comely gracious heavenly father that
[33:03] should be enough to start the service
[33:05] asking you lead lead and guide us in the
[33:08] direction in which you would have us
[33:09] speak this evening in the name of Jesus
[33:12] Christ amen please be
[33:16] seated we've heard a lot of gospel most
[33:20] of us I mean some of you young people
[33:22] it's a lot of this is new a lot of it's
[33:25] uh the things we hear I understand but
[33:28] for most of us older folks uh we've
[33:32] heard a lot of gospel we've heard a lot
[33:34] of messages preached a lot of tapes
[33:37] whatever it is that wherever we've heard
[33:40] and how that uh there's a relationship
[33:44] through the preaching of the Gospel the
[33:47] the Bible you know in one place calls it
[33:49] foolishness through the foolishness of
[33:53] preaching and but it's through that
[33:55] foolishness that he has ordained
[33:57] salvation
[33:59] yes what is foolish to man is to God the
[34:03] most uh important thing and how that you
[34:07] know man calls certain things great and
[34:10] God says it's foolish and God calls
[34:13] something great and people we think well
[34:15] that's kind of foolish it was but it's
[34:18] through that foolishness that we gain
[34:20] the relationship that we have with Jesus
[34:24] Christ and I wanted before we actually
[34:27] get into it I'm sure you're familiar
[34:29] with this uh scripture Hebrew 138 I'm a
[34:33] Bible preacher I I I'll you know I don't
[34:36] use a whole lot of what we say quotes or
[34:39] uh other things like that and uh because
[34:43] every word in this book even you know
[34:46] brother brandham said that every word in
[34:48] here is inspired and if we read it
[34:51] there's an inspiration behind it so
[34:55] Hebrews 13:8 I know you're familiar with
[34:57] it and I probably mentioned it before
[35:00] but it says you know Jesus Christ the
[35:03] same yesterday today and
[35:06] forever and as we think about that and
[35:10] we
[35:11] think thanks buddy I got one for each
[35:14] hand now praise the Lord thank you you
[35:18] and as we think about
[35:21] that in that particular
[35:24] scripture it's telling us that the the
[35:26] Jesus Christ that was
[35:28] yesterday H is the same God that is
[35:31] today but he is forever and when you
[35:34] begin to study through that scripture a
[35:36] little bit and start actually looking up
[35:38] the words and looking at it it means
[35:41] that the god that spoke
[35:44] yesterday is the same God that speaks
[35:47] today and I I know this is big words
[35:50] especially maybe for you young people
[35:52] that it's it says copulative cumulative
[35:56] in the uh dissertation from the
[35:58] interpreters and what that actually
[36:00] means it's an extremely close
[36:04] relationship that
[36:06] accumulates it's like when two people
[36:08] get married they that close relationship
[36:13] brings something more it brings children
[36:15] into the Earth and so that you know that
[36:20] coming
[36:21] together accumulates something and with
[36:25] the voice of Jesus Christ because he's
[36:27] The Voice voice of God to
[36:29] us that was was there yesterday and that
[36:32] is here today it's going to produce
[36:35] something and what that voice produces
[36:38] is
[36:40] forever think about that the god that
[36:44] spoke before that's speaking now today
[36:48] produces forever to the
[36:51] Believers if we can receive the fact
[36:55] that we're in a close relationship with
[36:57] Christ
[36:58] and that though that that which was
[37:00] yesterday and that which is today is
[37:01] going to produce in us it's going to
[37:04] accumulate into
[37:06] forever and take us out of this world
[37:10] into the presence of forever which is
[37:13] Jesus Christ so we see that the word is
[37:18] about producing a relationship even in
[37:21] simplest form there in verse eight and
[37:24] how I like to think that
[37:27] as we consider where we're living and
[37:29] what time we're living in and all of the
[37:31] things going around us I'll read just
[37:34] quickly from Revelations the first
[37:36] chapter and again I realize most of you
[37:39] are familiar with
[37:41] this but in the first chapter of the
[37:44] Book of Revelations or third chapter I'm
[37:47] sorry
[37:50] uh it's talking about ages of the church
[37:55] system it's not talking it does speak
[37:57] directly to single churches as in
[37:59] Ephesus samna pergamus thyrus and when
[38:03] it comes down to chapter
[38:05] 3 uh it goes into uh well the last one
[38:09] it speaks about is Le oia and he starts
[38:12] out and says and unto the angel of the
[38:14] Church of the leodan write these
[38:19] things uh write these things saith the
[38:22] amen so God is speaking and this is a
[38:25] god of yesterday
[38:28] okay that was speaking here to the angel
[38:31] uh these things saith the amen that is
[38:35] the final word that means what so be it
[38:39] is how it's usually uh spoken to people
[38:41] is is if this what he speaking here is
[38:44] going to
[38:45] become exactly what he says it is and so
[38:49] he he said there sayith the amen and the
[38:53] faithful and true
[38:55] witness this is Jesus Christ speaking as
[38:59] the faithful and true witness he is the
[39:03] one that's filled with faith and he is
[39:06] the witness to the things that are being
[39:09] spoken and it for them you know for the
[39:12] the Apostle in this particular case the
[39:15] god of yesterday was becoming the god of
[39:19] today and in that relationship that he's
[39:22] speaking there to the Apostle John in
[39:26] that relation ship and in these words
[39:29] it's going to produce something and what
[39:32] it's going to produce is
[39:35] forever in these words in this he's the
[39:38] faithful and the true witness because he
[39:41] is now the one who was faithful unto
[39:45] every word that was spoken of him as far
[39:49] as being
[39:50] savior he stuck with every word so
[39:55] closely and even when going up to his
[39:58] crucifixion I don't maybe you haven't
[40:00] noticed before and we we spoke about it
[40:03] a few years ago for Brother Rich and how
[40:05] that when they first offered him the
[40:08] soop with the the vinegar and stuff on
[40:10] the cross he spit it out he would not
[40:14] taste of
[40:16] that and yet but right before he passed
[40:21] right before he it said the spirit
[40:23] departed from him right before he died
[40:26] on Calvary
[40:28] they offered it him to him again and he
[40:30] drank
[40:32] it why would that be he had to fulfill
[40:36] all
[40:38] righteousness every scripture his
[40:40] relationship he was God the word being
[40:45] manifested in flesh he was called the
[40:49] Nazarene he had a Nazarite vow and you
[40:52] go back and you read the vows of the
[40:54] Nazarene he was not
[40:56] allowed to to partake of the vinegar and
[40:59] he spit it out he
[41:01] fulfilled his part his relationship with
[41:05] that
[41:07] verse because he was a
[41:09] Nazarene but at the end right before he
[41:13] passed he drank it because he had to
[41:16] fulfill the scripture I believe it's
[41:18] either in Isaiah or Psalms where it said
[41:20] they gave him vinegar and Gall to
[41:23] drink and he drank it
[41:27] his relationship with with the word of
[41:30] God was so powerful and so strong he was
[41:35] the
[41:35] witness that the word of God is
[41:39] true and then it says that he's the
[41:41] beginning of the creation of God it
[41:44] doesn't say God's
[41:46] creation he was the starting point of
[41:49] God creating himself the god of
[41:53] yesterday becoming today for for us to
[41:58] take us
[42:00] into
[42:02] forever and he's the beginning of that
[42:05] and as we receive that we become part of
[42:09] Hebrews
[42:10] 138 and a ton of others and hundreds of
[42:14] other
[42:16] scriptures and as we look at
[42:19] that third chapter there of Revelations
[42:22] what I as I was reading it today I I
[42:25] never really thought about it in this
[42:28] particular
[42:29] form but the church world is going
[42:32] through a
[42:34] transition they were called out you know
[42:37] back in all the way back to Ephesus when
[42:40] the all the way actually back to the the
[42:43] church at Pentecost and how they were
[42:45] called out and they began to grow and
[42:47] they went through the exact same cycle
[42:49] that Jesus did because the the spirit of
[42:53] Christ was in him and he went through a
[42:56] birth Life Death burial and
[43:00] Resurrection just as we see every day
[43:03] when the sun comes up birth Life Death
[43:06] burial and
[43:07] resurrection and because he did that and
[43:11] because his Spirit was planted into the
[43:14] Church of God or the Church of the
[43:16] Living God as we would call it the
[43:18] church went through the same cycle it
[43:21] went through a transition of uh uh you
[43:24] know in Ephesus this great church this
[43:28] we call it the lion the lion roared that
[43:30] Spirit the the four spirits that Ezekiel
[43:33] Saw when he saw God that lion roared and
[43:36] that that church went out and it
[43:38] preached everywhere Fearless regardless
[43:41] of what they did regardless of what they
[43:43] had to do they preached fearlessly
[43:46] because they had the spirit of the
[43:48] lion but the time came when they
[43:51] transitioned into the spirit of the
[43:53] man and how that I mean the ox came
[43:57] first and the ox was a sacrificial Beast
[44:00] and the church was
[44:02] sacrificed it was sacrificed and died in
[44:07] the dark a ages when they even you know
[44:10] according to the Catholic Catholic
[44:12] Church according to their own records
[44:14] they killed 68 million Christians that's
[44:18] not counting the ones they that got
[44:20] missed along the
[44:21] line the church as we think of it died
[44:24] and the word died with it and then but
[44:27] then it became the the man the spirit of
[44:30] the man and the the knowledge of man
[44:32] began to they got a hold of the
[44:34] scriptures and through man's knowledge
[44:37] they begin they were able to start
[44:39] picking up and going well that's not
[44:42] right that's not right God never
[44:44] ordained that and so that took them into
[44:47] the what we call the spirit of the eagle
[44:50] and we know that Spirit of the eagle
[44:53] culminated in a
[44:56] relationship of a prophet's
[44:58] message because God types his Eagles to
[45:01] they can see further than any
[45:04] Beast they soar the skies I'll never
[45:07] forget we were coming back I think it
[45:08] was from Panama coming in over the the
[45:12] uh the sea there coming down into
[45:16] Houston and I think they told us we were
[45:18] around 30,000 ft uh over the Gulf of
[45:22] Mexico and I remember just kind of
[45:25] kicked back on the airplane and I I
[45:27] looked up and above the
[45:30] airplane you could barely see it but way
[45:33] up there was this Eagle circling in the
[45:36] storm friends
[45:39] 34,000 I think is what they told us and
[45:42] he was above
[45:44] us and he didn't seem to have any
[45:46] trouble seeing
[45:49] things because that was the spirit that
[45:51] was sent to the
[45:53] church but that spirit that was sent to
[45:55] the church and if you when think about
[45:57] it when you go home and you read this
[45:59] you know there about Le oia because I
[46:02] found it so interesting because it
[46:04] actually
[46:06] parallels the uh Song of Solomon in a
[46:09] lot of
[46:10] ways because in it there he speaks as a
[46:15] church of transition going through this
[46:18] transition as we read those other Church
[46:20] ages and as a church of transition what
[46:22] it brings is a
[46:25] transformation these words words are not
[46:27] there just to tell us oh we're going
[46:29] through this time and we're going
[46:31] through these struggles and and the
[46:33] whole world and we know all this
[46:35] information about the world and we know
[46:37] how they're headed for the mark of the
[46:39] beast and hope I didn't tear something
[46:41] up too
[46:42] bad I always have trouble with those
[46:45] little wires but I don't know what it is
[46:48] Jerry what is
[46:50] it it's so nice to have you
[46:53] here but it's not just going to show us
[46:57] that the church is in transition it's
[46:59] bringing us from that transition into a
[47:03] transformation we are being transformed
[47:07] into the image of
[47:09] God that spirit and those and those all
[47:13] of those uh faces and what they
[47:16] represent is certain Natures that was on
[47:19] the the spirit of the church and in time
[47:21] to take him through those Transitions
[47:24] and through the transition we have today
[47:27] but even as we're going through these
[47:28] transition or these transitions it's
[47:31] bringing us it's a transforming
[47:34] power that is being placed by the life
[47:37] of God in us by the word of God it's
[47:40] it's him transforming us into an image
[47:44] of
[47:46] forever the image of the god that spoke
[47:50] back there and and trans you know went
[47:53] through transition all through those
[47:55] ages and is speaking here tonight it's
[47:58] to bring us into a
[48:00] transformation into the Sons and
[48:02] Daughters of
[48:04] God that he can manifest himself not
[48:09] just as the beginning of the creation of
[48:11] God but as the beginning Jesus Christ is
[48:14] the beginning he said I am the beginning
[48:17] I am the
[48:19] ending and it's a transition that has
[48:22] taken us to a
[48:23] transformation that when we receive
[48:26] Jesus Christ Christ he transforms
[48:30] us into the image of the god that spoke
[48:35] then is speaking now in the image that
[48:38] he saw us in
[48:41] Forever that's God's
[48:43] plan that's God's way uh I haven't
[48:47] listened to it for a while but uh Christ
[48:50] The Mystery of God revealed he said
[48:52] three-fold
[48:54] purpose and his purpose is say to
[48:58] manifest us as
[49:00] transformed Sons and Daughters of God
[49:03] that we are transformed to be able to
[49:06] step into
[49:07] eternity with
[49:10] him because just as the spirit that was
[49:12] in Christ was in the church there the
[49:16] spirit that was in Christ right now will
[49:19] take us to Christ that is
[49:23] forever just as they went through the
[49:25] same life cycle
[49:27] we go through the same life cycle
[49:30] because it didn't end with the
[49:33] resurrection no it ended if you want to
[49:36] say
[49:36] ended before it started the next phase
[49:40] it ended with what we would call a
[49:43] Rapture but you know it was the first
[49:46] Rapture that in the New Testament I
[49:49] believe it was or second I can't
[49:51] remember how but it was a Rapture he was
[49:54] caught up in into the cloud from the
[49:57] ground
[49:59] up
[50:00] Acts chapter
[50:03] 2 and so that he was transformed by what
[50:07] he went through in death life burial and
[50:10] Resurrection into the transforming power
[50:13] that took him up and that's where we're
[50:16] at
[50:17] tonight he is
[50:20] Transforming Our Hearts into the
[50:23] resurrected Jesus Christ that he can
[50:27] meet with us as he saw us before the
[50:30] foundation of the world Sons and
[50:33] Daughters of God so now we said
[50:37] that to actually I I mentioned in some
[50:41] ways it parallel Song of Solomon and I
[50:44] say that because he jumps back and forth
[50:47] he jumps back and forth between the the
[50:49] makeb believer or the unbeliever
[50:51] whatever it is and the
[50:53] Believers and and he jumps back and
[50:56] forth for and he said you're rich
[50:57] increased with goods and you don't
[50:59] you're wretched miserable poor blind and
[51:01] naked that doesn't apply to
[51:03] me applies to what's out there in the
[51:07] church world but what applies to me is
[51:11] to him that overcometh amen will I grant
[51:14] to sit with me in my
[51:17] Throne he is calling us
[51:20] calling us to that
[51:24] throne and when it says that you know to
[51:26] S but e but he says even as I also
[51:29] overcame how did he
[51:33] overcome if we know how he
[51:35] overcame we can
[51:37] overcome he overcame
[51:40] because there was a
[51:43] time after his birth and a portion of
[51:46] his life when there was a prophet on the
[51:49] scene called John the Baptist an eagle
[51:52] God Likens His prophets to Eagles and
[51:55] that eagle
[51:58] when he saw he was you know he was
[52:00] tearing it up man you scribes and
[52:02] Pharisees you bunch of snakes I mean he
[52:04] was tearing it up big
[52:06] time and and not a
[52:09] Fearless sore in the heavenlies but when
[52:13] he saw
[52:16] Jesus come down to the
[52:19] water his
[52:21] entire uh demeanor
[52:25] changed he turns and says Behold the
[52:28] Lamb of God the
[52:31] Lamb of God we've heard the token he
[52:36] said it's a lamb the nature of a
[52:39] lamb but when he talked about the Lamb
[52:42] of God you know they said how did you
[52:45] know and he said because I was told in
[52:48] the spirit when you see the
[52:50] dove the dove land on that one that's my
[52:56] my
[53:00] lamb the spirit of God is a
[53:04] dove it's
[53:06] gentle I made a mistake a while back I
[53:10] was thinking I was correcting
[53:13] somebody and they flew away and I
[53:16] realized
[53:18] David you shouldn't have done
[53:21] that because the dove has a nature you
[53:24] can't feed a dove
[53:27] Eagle food really it'll kill them
[53:29] Prophet said that we all think about oh
[53:32] we're Eagles and we're going to go into
[53:33] the fresh kill and eat all this no man
[53:37] when you're dealing with certain people
[53:38] and certain
[53:40] Hearts you got to treat him like a
[53:43] dove you'll kill them eag a dove can't
[53:48] eat that kind of carrying it'll kill
[53:50] them they have to have grains little
[53:54] grains and and when you throw them out
[53:56] there you got to stand back and watch
[53:59] just and when they pick it up they pick
[54:01] it up just kind of one at a time you
[54:04] don't you know go to the smorgus board
[54:06] and slide them down the deal and find
[54:09] out what's in their mouth when they get
[54:10] to the other end no the dove they eat
[54:14] pure
[54:15] grain pure
[54:18] seeds and Jesus said my word is a seed
[54:23] and the nature of the word
[54:26] is the Dove and the
[54:29] lamb helpless little
[54:32] lambs as it were without the spirit of
[54:37] the
[54:38] dove and if we just go to church and
[54:41] tear it up or we tear up our families or
[54:44] tear up our friends you know I I think
[54:46] we've seen different Church splits and
[54:48] things along the way and I and I've
[54:50] wondered sometimes what really happened
[54:53] well you go back and you list you know
[54:55] the the message tells us that you are
[54:58] what you
[55:00] eat you I've I've seen a a a deer once
[55:04] in southern Utah that had taken down an
[55:08] eagle I mean had taken down a
[55:12] deer and the eagle was sitting on the
[55:14] deer and he's just tearing it up eating
[55:17] the fresh kill beautiful sight didn't
[55:21] even I you know I drove up probably from
[55:23] here to Sister Jerry and sat there and
[55:25] watched him tearing it up and the other
[55:28] birds start coming there was some Hawks
[55:30] and some crows and you know different
[55:33] ones
[55:34] come and and there and he wouldn't let
[55:37] him get near it until he'd eaten his
[55:39] fill and then when he'd eaten his fill
[55:41] he just flew back sat on a a tree or
[55:44] stump something there and just watched
[55:46] the other birds eat the fresh
[55:49] kill friends if we eat or we
[55:54] serve Eagle food crows can eat
[55:58] it I know this is probably not what you
[56:01] expected to
[56:02] hear but it's
[56:05] true it's true and if we treat people
[56:08] like you know I got this bunch of meat
[56:10] man and I'm going to jam it down your
[56:13] throat you might want to step back and
[56:15] think about what you're
[56:17] doing because if they're a dove you
[56:19] can't even get too
[56:21] close I I had actually it was over near
[56:26] the airport just a couple weeks ago
[56:28] there was two there was a mother Dove
[56:30] and two babies two baby doves and I
[56:33] guess you'd been teaching him to fly and
[56:37] those two little doves they held so
[56:39] close together and they actually let me
[56:41] get probably from here to that violin
[56:44] away from him and I was afraid to get
[56:47] any closer because the mother was
[56:49] standing back a little further watching
[56:51] me and I backed away slowly they never
[56:54] moved
[56:56] because they don't have the same nature
[56:58] as a crow they don't have the same
[57:01] nature as even an
[57:05] eagle and when we read there in the Song
[57:08] of
[57:10] Solomon and so as we we as you're going
[57:14] through that look how he jumps back and
[57:17] forth in Revelations we'll go back to
[57:19] the song Salon here in just a minute he
[57:21] jumps back and forth and I love there
[57:25] also where he says as many as I
[57:28] love I rebuke and chasten but how does
[57:32] that chastening come I remember it's
[57:34] been a few years ago I was listening to
[57:36] a certain tape and brother brandom he he
[57:40] said that uh you know he said boy did
[57:43] you you hear that rebuke that I wasn't
[57:47] the word wasn't severe or that but it
[57:50] was you know like a very strong
[57:52] rebuke to that person last night
[57:57] huh I went back and listened to it
[57:59] friend it was almost like
[58:01] nothing but he called it a a strong
[58:05] rebuke he was dealing with a
[58:08] dove he was dealing with the holy spirit
[58:12] that was dealing with that Dove it
[58:15] didn't have to be just tear it up and
[58:16] beat him up and jam it down somebody's
[58:20] throat live the
[58:23] life let the transforming power power of
[58:27] Jesus Christ becomes so much a part of
[58:30] us he said he loves
[58:33] us and then he you
[58:35] know I stand at the door and knock and
[58:38] in verse 20 there he said as many as
[58:41] hear my
[58:43] voice what
[58:46] voice is calling the
[58:50] bride now there was a transition where
[58:52] we came through the eagle
[58:54] age that that presenting of the eagle
[58:58] and it's good food don't get me wrong
[59:01] it's
[59:02] amazing what God did through the voice
[59:04] of that eagle but it when when it comes
[59:07] to the calling out of the
[59:09] Bride he said as many as hear my voice
[59:13] and I wrote down because it's basically
[59:16] the same word that we
[59:19] hear in uh clear back at the beginning
[59:23] In the Garden of Eden it has you know a
[59:26] slightly different twinge to it I
[59:29] suppose in the Greek than it did in the
[59:32] Hebrew but in Genesis 3 and
[59:35] 8 when it talks about the
[59:39] voice it says it's the sound of an
[59:42] instrument oh it was so beautiful
[59:44] tonight the sounds of the instruments
[59:47] then it says it was a noise it was a
[59:50] calling a voice calling aloud when it
[59:55] said we heard the voice voice of God in
[59:57] the garden and we were afraid so he
[1:00:01] we're talking about the voice and it
[1:00:03] said inside of that voice I'm just
[1:00:05] reading the meanings there was a
[1:00:08] bleeting what
[1:00:11] bleats sheep friends thank you brother
[1:00:13] that's true a bleeding a
[1:00:18] crackling a
[1:00:21] cry a
[1:00:22] lo as the cattle or as the sheep in the
[1:00:26] fields and they're eating gently of the
[1:00:29] grasses and of
[1:00:30] the but then you know running it into as
[1:00:34] it were into the church ages there was a
[1:00:37] thunder in the voice brother you're
[1:00:40] familiar we're supposed to know about
[1:00:43] the seven
[1:00:44] Thunders because they're all wrapped up
[1:00:46] in the
[1:00:49] voice and there's a lightheartedness
[1:00:53] another actually the word that used next
[1:00:55] was frivolous or
[1:00:57] frivolity how there's a
[1:01:01] joy in the voice a joy that should be in
[1:01:05] our hearts a joy that we can that we've
[1:01:09] heard the voice I've heard the voice and
[1:01:12] and I'm I'm
[1:01:14] happy and sometimes
[1:01:16] lighthearted because there's there's
[1:01:18] light in it the light from there it it
[1:01:22] pushes back the darkness it pushes back
[1:01:27] you know all the things all of that
[1:01:29] transition stuff that the world is is
[1:01:31] the You Know Rich increased all that
[1:01:33] stuff it's pushing it back and we should
[1:01:36] be
[1:01:37] lighthearted and and
[1:01:39] happy I'm happy he brought me to his to
[1:01:43] his banqueting table it says in in the
[1:01:45] Song of Solomon and His Banner Over Me
[1:01:48] was
[1:01:49] love it's love I you know I kind of hate
[1:01:53] to say this but I I remember Deborah and
[1:01:56] I we were talking about it one time and
[1:01:59] how that you know people said we were
[1:02:03] worthless people when they're about to
[1:02:05] get married and they're in love they're
[1:02:09] worthless man you can't get a word in
[1:02:12] It's Like H let them go they'll get over
[1:02:16] it
[1:02:17] someday you're all laughing because you
[1:02:19] know it's
[1:02:21] true and that's how it is with Jesus
[1:02:24] Christ we should be
[1:02:27] happy there is a joy there is something
[1:02:32] about falling in
[1:02:34] love about getting to
[1:02:37] know each other and getting to know our
[1:02:40] relationship and our place as it were in
[1:02:43] that
[1:02:45] relationship and I and how that there
[1:02:49] there's a song I heard recently it said
[1:02:52] that you know where two hearts become
[1:02:55] one
[1:02:56] our hearts should beat as one with Jesus
[1:03:02] Christ
[1:03:06] because it says that you know as many as
[1:03:10] hear the voice or understand the voice
[1:03:13] do we
[1:03:14] truly understand the voice because that
[1:03:18] voice now we can go back to Song of
[1:03:20] Solomon that
[1:03:24] voice hm
[1:03:27] my beloved is like a row I'm on in in
[1:03:29] verse n well I'll start at eight the
[1:03:33] voice of my beloved behold he comes
[1:03:35] leaping upon the mountains skipping upon
[1:03:37] the hills my beloved is like a row which
[1:03:40] is like a deer or say you says or a
[1:03:43] young heart behold he stands behind our
[1:03:47] wall he looks forth at the windows
[1:03:49] showing himself through the lattice do
[1:03:52] you know what that word lattice is oh
[1:03:54] there is so much in there that maybe God
[1:03:57] will allow us to preach sometime on the
[1:03:59] lattice but we think of it as you know
[1:04:01] when people have the garden and they
[1:04:03] have the The Vines going up and they
[1:04:05] have that thing that's you know they put
[1:04:08] it there by the door and to look through
[1:04:10] it you never get the whole picture at
[1:04:12] one
[1:04:13] time you get it from this Square this
[1:04:16] Square this
[1:04:18] square and it says he shows himself
[1:04:21] through the lattice line upon line
[1:04:25] preach precept upon precept and showing
[1:04:29] himself and they'll put the Roses on
[1:04:30] those lattice or sometimes grapes
[1:04:33] different
[1:04:34] things but he looks forth at the windows
[1:04:37] and he shows himself through the lattice
[1:04:41] we're talking hear about the the voice
[1:04:43] of my
[1:04:44] beloved the voice comes in little
[1:04:49] pieces and it's the
[1:04:51] voice of the dove because it continues
[1:04:55] my beloved SP uh my beloved spake and
[1:04:58] said unto me rise up my love my fair one
[1:05:02] and come away what's the call to the
[1:05:05] Bride of Jesus
[1:05:07] Christ it's the voice of God showing
[1:05:11] himself and like I said that word
[1:05:13] lattice oh man there's a whole there's a
[1:05:16] mathematical lattice that they talk
[1:05:18] about there's a chemical
[1:05:22] lattice and they all relate actually B
[1:05:25] back to little pieces coming together
[1:05:29] from what I understand it some of it's
[1:05:31] way over my head so don't quote me on
[1:05:33] that CU I'm going wow there's a lattice
[1:05:36] of I think light and there's a lattice
[1:05:38] of this and that and
[1:05:41] it's things being broken into pieces
[1:05:45] that give us a picture of the whole by
[1:05:49] the pieces I hope I'm saying that right
[1:05:53] but and I'll go ahead and read down down
[1:05:56] a few more verses because I love it it
[1:05:58] says for Lo the winter is passed the
[1:06:00] rain is over the flowers appear on the
[1:06:02] earth the time of the singing of the
[1:06:05] birds is come the voice of the turtle is
[1:06:09] heard in our land I questioned over that
[1:06:12] the turtle I've never heard a turtle
[1:06:14] speak but in Spanish it's aan I think
[1:06:18] it's like Avan so it's the turtle
[1:06:21] dove the flowers appear on the word it's
[1:06:24] the springtime
[1:06:26] when did was the the message it is the
[1:06:29] rising of the sun
[1:06:32] preached it was preached in the spring
[1:06:36] and he's saying the flowers are
[1:06:38] appearing the time of the singing of the
[1:06:41] birds and the voice of the turtle dove
[1:06:46] is heard in our
[1:06:48] land the kingdom of God is within USL
[1:06:56] and the turtle dove is heard in our land
[1:07:00] in our
[1:07:01] portion of the scripture the dove is to
[1:07:05] be living in our
[1:07:08] hearts and that voice should be
[1:07:11] heard he says and the Fig Tree puts
[1:07:14] forth her green figs and the vines with
[1:07:16] their tender grape and they give a good
[1:07:19] smell Arise My Love My Fair one and come
[1:07:24] away
[1:07:27] that's
[1:07:29] not what we would think of is like
[1:07:32] strong meat it's just a call from a
[1:07:35] voice from the voice of my beloved who
[1:07:39] it says in another place his voice is
[1:07:41] like a dove well of course because
[1:07:44] that's what landed on the
[1:07:47] lamb and even when he rebuked and
[1:07:50] chastised and did those things you know
[1:07:53] he brw his vipers and that kind of stuff
[1:07:57] it was still done with the
[1:08:00] attitude and with the the
[1:08:04] nature of the
[1:08:09] Lamb Arise My Fair one and come away and
[1:08:15] then he continues in verse 14 oh my oh
[1:08:18] my
[1:08:19] Dove that are in the Cliffs of the rocks
[1:08:21] and the secret places of the stairs let
[1:08:24] me see thy countenance let me hear thy
[1:08:28] voice now he's this time he's talking to
[1:08:30] the the
[1:08:34] bride the dove the king the one with the
[1:08:41] banners is that
[1:08:44] right skipping upon the
[1:08:50] hills the Banners at the banqueting
[1:08:52] table there is joy joy unspeakable in
[1:08:57] the spirit of the
[1:08:59] dove oh my Dove thou that art in the
[1:09:03] cfts of the rock the secret places of
[1:09:05] the stairs let me see thy countenance he
[1:09:08] wants to
[1:09:10] see what our countenance is or the
[1:09:13] countenance is actually the spirit that
[1:09:16] is you know exuded from around around us
[1:09:20] we used to you know there's there's
[1:09:21] people and even you can actually train
[1:09:24] yourself under certain condition I
[1:09:25] conditions through meditation to see the
[1:09:27] countenance on
[1:09:29] people before I had even met the Lord we
[1:09:32] used to we they call it you know in the
[1:09:36] I believe it's the uh religion of East
[1:09:40] India they call it the
[1:09:42] aura and I had been uh meditating with
[1:09:46] some friends we went to a certain uh
[1:09:49] event a singing event when I was in
[1:09:52] college and I'd not even I don't think
[1:09:54] I'd even met the the Lord yet as far as
[1:09:57] I
[1:09:57] know and as we sat there and the
[1:10:00] lighting was just right I was telling
[1:10:01] them now look at I looked at a certain
[1:10:03] man came in and he had a certain Aura
[1:10:06] around him large yellow or amber colored
[1:10:11] and you could tell man he was so
[1:10:12] energetic and so happy was a teacher I
[1:10:15] knew the man
[1:10:16] well and as he stood there against the
[1:10:20] wall and I said look look out about from
[1:10:22] his body maybe this you know about so
[1:10:24] far out out and you can see where his
[1:10:28] Aura is and there was like two or three
[1:10:30] other kids and two of them weren't
[1:10:32] familiar with anything like that and
[1:10:34] they weren't we can see
[1:10:37] it and there was a young woman there
[1:10:40] that I knew pretty well that was a lot
[1:10:43] into meditation and as we sat there and
[1:10:46] we got into the
[1:10:47] music that was going on that was a folk
[1:10:50] concert another man came in and as I
[1:10:53] looked at him he had a tiny or a kind of
[1:10:56] a blue or a blue green color and you
[1:11:00] could tell he was I think he was a
[1:11:01] smoker and maybe an alcoholic and when
[1:11:04] he got close to that teacher he
[1:11:08] literally you could see it with natural
[1:11:11] eyes he sucked part of that aura off
[1:11:15] that onto his until when he left he was
[1:11:18] feeling pretty good and the other and
[1:11:20] the teacher that I knew was like wore
[1:11:23] out you ever get around down town you
[1:11:26] come home and you're just flat wor out
[1:11:29] it's because they've sucked the
[1:11:31] energy right out of you I'm not making
[1:11:35] this up they'll suck that energy right
[1:11:39] out of
[1:11:41] you and that's why we have to stay as it
[1:11:44] we're prayed up all the
[1:11:46] time so we keep you know so we're we're
[1:11:50] plugged in and I'm not talking about
[1:11:51] into these
[1:11:53] things we're plugged in into Jesus
[1:11:56] Christ the word because it says all
[1:11:58] power of Heaven and Earth was his and
[1:12:03] it's given unto us to
[1:12:07] use and he said let me see your
[1:12:09] countenance he's
[1:12:11] talking bride little
[1:12:14] doves little Dove oh oh my Dove you're
[1:12:18] hiding in the cust of the who's the rock
[1:12:21] come on yeah you understand this is all
[1:12:23] about Jesus Christ
[1:12:25] every bit of it we're hidden in the Rock
[1:12:29] Christ Jesus we're in the CFT of the
[1:12:32] rock we're hiding in the secret places
[1:12:35] of the stairs stairs go up stairs go
[1:12:41] down and he says let me see your
[1:12:43] countenance let me take a look at your
[1:12:46] spirit create in me a clean heart and
[1:12:49] renew a right spirit in me regardless of
[1:12:55] what you did today or what you'll do
[1:12:57] tomorrow and how much condemnation the
[1:13:00] devil tries to put you on you I believe
[1:13:02] it's in first John it says no matter if
[1:13:05] you if your hearts condemn us said I'm
[1:13:09] greater than your
[1:13:11] heart the dove of God is
[1:13:15] greater than the condemnation in our
[1:13:18] hearts and all we have to do is go back
[1:13:21] and look at I guess I can say papa dove
[1:13:28] and feel the
[1:13:29] connection if I use those two big words
[1:13:32] copul
[1:13:34] accumulative in other words the close
[1:13:36] relationship accumulates into
[1:13:40] eternity and he says and let me hear
[1:13:43] your
[1:13:44] voice let me hear thy voice our
[1:13:48] husband Jesus Christ the
[1:13:52] dove that's calling us come up here
[1:13:56] come
[1:13:57] up come
[1:13:59] up the Winter's
[1:14:03] passed arise rise up my love my fair one
[1:14:07] come
[1:14:09] away it's not a
[1:14:12] pounding it's a gentle call
[1:14:16] arise and come away my fair
[1:14:20] one and when he speaks about her he said
[1:14:24] for sweet is your
[1:14:29] voice bet you weren't expecting this
[1:14:32] were you neither was
[1:14:35] I but he says Arise My Fair one and come
[1:14:40] away and he wants to hear the
[1:14:43] voice and he says for thy countenance is
[1:14:46] comely or in other words it's it's soft
[1:14:50] it's remember when it talked about Jesus
[1:14:53] it said he had nothing that people would
[1:14:56] desire of him as a man he was a small
[1:14:59] man he he he wasn't like Saul or you
[1:15:04] know like a big Warrior coming out
[1:15:06] booming and and screaming at
[1:15:10] people no he spoke in a boat on the Sea
[1:15:14] of
[1:15:15] Galilee and yet they heard his voice
[1:15:18] 3,000 people on a
[1:15:23] bank he says for sweet is your voice
[1:15:27] your voice to Jesus Christ is
[1:15:32] sweet and if you go you know back since
[1:15:36] we mentioned
[1:15:37] Genesis I'll mention it once more he
[1:15:40] said when he talked to Adam after the
[1:15:45] fall and you know first he curses the
[1:15:47] serpent then he he doesn't curse Eve he
[1:15:50] just curses the child birth says you're
[1:15:52] going to have trouble with that now
[1:15:55] think about it sisters it's
[1:15:57] hard because of what happened there with
[1:16:00] the adultery in the garden he says
[1:16:03] you're going to struggle with that and
[1:16:04] when he talks to Adam then the thir you
[1:16:07] know and he begins he he curses there
[1:16:10] too but he never cursed
[1:16:15] Adam he
[1:16:17] couldn't because he was a Son of
[1:16:21] God Bible talks about the first Adam in
[1:16:24] the the
[1:16:25] second Adam the second Adam is a
[1:16:28] lifegiving
[1:16:31] spirit and he never cursed Adam but he
[1:16:35] cursed the
[1:16:37] ground but and then he gave the
[1:16:42] reason I love this because it's talking
[1:16:45] about Adam being like Jesus Christ we've
[1:16:48] heard the message and how that he said
[1:16:52] he Adam could not leave Eve in that
[1:16:56] position she had no way back her only
[1:17:00] way back was through Adam because that's
[1:17:03] where she came from our only way back is
[1:17:07] through Christ because that's who where
[1:17:09] we came
[1:17:10] from and he would not leave us just as
[1:17:14] Adam would not leave
[1:17:16] Eve and he said Adam because you
[1:17:20] listened to the voice of your
[1:17:23] wife I don't know know what she said I
[1:17:25] don't know how she said it there's no
[1:17:27] scripture that tells
[1:17:31] us but her
[1:17:33] voice was enough that Adam took her and
[1:17:38] brought her under his
[1:17:42] protection he brought her from a lost
[1:17:48] position from a position of Eternal
[1:17:52] separation from God
[1:17:56] into his tent as we would say it and he
[1:18:00] placed his natural seed into her that
[1:18:04] brought forth CH a
[1:18:07] child and when we when when we call to
[1:18:11] God as we cry out to
[1:18:14] God it's it's our voice that he
[1:18:18] hears it's a sweet
[1:18:20] voice he said let me hear your voice he
[1:18:24] just wants to hear our voice because it
[1:18:27] was the voice of Eve that called to Adam
[1:18:30] that Adam said come
[1:18:32] hither come unto me and when he gave her
[1:18:36] of his seed she brought forth a
[1:18:39] son
[1:18:41] able and when we give our when we call
[1:18:45] out to God he gives us the seed he said
[1:18:49] my word is a
[1:18:51] seed take it my y is easy my burden is
[1:18:57] light take the seed because in my seed
[1:19:01] is life I am the light of the world I am
[1:19:04] the resurrection and the life I am that
[1:19:08] I
[1:19:10] am and he displays himself to his bride
[1:19:15] as a
[1:19:20] dove oh my
[1:19:26] I'm beginning to believe I've been
[1:19:29] looking at things backwards for a long
[1:19:32] time God let me have the voice of the
[1:19:36] dove let me have that voice that moves
[1:19:41] God in the sweetness and that my renew a
[1:19:45] right spirit that my
[1:19:48] countenance is such that he he says to
[1:19:51] me let me hear your voice David
[1:19:56] Trevor whoever you are give him your
[1:20:00] voice let Bible says that in
[1:20:04] the out of the
[1:20:08] mouth is what the heart
[1:20:11] speaks and when we speak to
[1:20:14] him let our hearts say here am I Lord
[1:20:19] what would you have me to
[1:20:22] do Lord just let me hear that come up
[1:20:26] hither come into your presence once
[1:20:31] again God take me into your presence
[1:20:35] take me into your life and let our
[1:20:37] hearts beat as one let the yesterday and
[1:20:41] to today become forever
[1:20:47] together God let me hear your voice as
[1:20:50] the
[1:20:52] dove I don't need cow fu food I don't
[1:20:56] you know and the food of the eagle like
[1:20:57] I said it's
[1:20:58] wonderful but let it produce the
[1:21:03] dove because he in US is the
[1:21:06] Dove and that's the nature that he looks
[1:21:10] forth looks for in
[1:21:13] us because he's calling as a
[1:21:19] dove behold Thou Art Fair now I'm back
[1:21:22] in chapter 1 Thou Art Fair my love
[1:21:25] behold Thou Art
[1:21:29] Fair
[1:21:31] wow we didn't get to the first couple of
[1:21:33] verses there did we well maybe another
[1:21:38] time he's the rose of Shar and the lily
[1:21:41] of the valleys the Lily among the
[1:21:44] Thorns so is my love among the daughters
[1:21:47] we know that's all talking about Jesus
[1:21:49] Christ every word of it is talking about
[1:21:54] Jesus Jesus Christ The Lily among the
[1:21:57] Thorns the Lily has to be crushed to get
[1:22:00] the medicine out of it and it was there
[1:22:04] being crushed amidst the crown of
[1:22:09] thorns the lily of the valley the rose
[1:22:12] of Sharon Sharon actually is it's called
[1:22:15] for what it is because it's the flat
[1:22:19] place and the flat place when you think
[1:22:22] about it talks about John the Baptist
[1:22:24] and he said you know the mountains are
[1:22:25] coming down the valleys come up what's
[1:22:27] it talking about a flat
[1:22:31] place but the flat place is there to
[1:22:35] produce the
[1:22:37] rose the rose of Sharon which from the
[1:22:40] seed not I mean there's probably
[1:22:43] medicinal Pro properties in the whole
[1:22:45] row they're finding out many other PLS
[1:22:47] is that
[1:22:48] way but in the seeds in the little they
[1:22:51] call them rose hips what's there we
[1:22:54] think think of it as vitamin C and
[1:22:56] they've proven now that it gives us
[1:23:00] immunity to a lot of diseases and if you
[1:23:03] get the disease it makes you well
[1:23:07] faster and the rose grows out of the
[1:23:10] flat place from the
[1:23:14] message came the rose Jesus Christ shall
[1:23:17] we
[1:23:20] stand you know that song consume me
[1:23:23] sister could we sing that I love that
[1:23:27] song Praise the Lord I I hope this is
[1:23:31] something that will help you in your
[1:23:34] Christian walk I it's helped
[1:23:38] me and is helping me because it is the

[1:25:59] by before we sing it
[1:26:02] again I heard a interesting story keep
[1:26:06] playing sister it's
[1:26:09] beautiful in Japan they have this
[1:26:12] strange
[1:26:14] custom that if they find like a vase or
[1:26:17] maybe a a nice bowl or something and it
[1:26:20] gets
[1:26:22] broken that last long M Bless The Broken
[1:26:26] Pieces Of My
[1:26:30] Life they find it and it's broken they
[1:26:33] will painstakingly get
[1:26:35] down and pick up every
[1:26:39] piece and I'll put it there
[1:26:43] [Music]
[1:26:44] together by the fire Holy Spirit now put
[1:26:48] all the pieces together and they'll
[1:26:51] start putting it together like a puzzle
[1:26:54] but they don't use
[1:26:56] glue they take like a little torch or
[1:26:59] something hot and they'll
[1:27:01] fill the cracks with
[1:27:03] [Music]
[1:27:07] gold and they will put the pot the bowl
[1:27:10] whatever it was that had value they'll
[1:27:13] put it all back together with
[1:27:16] gold and their thought
[1:27:19] is because now it's far more Val
[1:27:24] valuable because the
[1:27:27] gold gives it more value but to them the
[1:27:31] real value is the
[1:27:33] story of being
[1:27:36] broken that the balll or the vase now
[1:27:40] holds these trials that we're going
[1:27:43] through says you're it's more precious
[1:27:46] than gold friends our broken lives are
