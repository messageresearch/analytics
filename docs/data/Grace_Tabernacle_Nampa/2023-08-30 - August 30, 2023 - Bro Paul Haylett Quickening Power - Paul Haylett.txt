Lord Jesus Hallelujah amen I had several announcements and I don't know if I want to break this atmosphere amen to make those announcements amen I'll just be very brief this coming Sunday is communion we want to remember that and also we want to remember that young adults in Sunday school starts this Sunday uh 9 45. uh we're going to have the singing before just like we have in the past and um so parents please be timely and we just want to uh just create an atmosphere young adults I don't know if you can handle or not but you'll just got to start off with brother Paul we'll see where the Lord takes us from there we have youth group on the 8th of August it will be here at the church for the Youth and at brother Sergey and sister Julius for grace kids it is with a heavy heart that I announced to you I forgot my phone at home but I believe the little boy's name was Kennen from Alaska that we prayed for six years old my heart goes out to the family but my god is perfect God has called him home amen right now he's in that restored body amen not a body ravaged with cancer disease and so let's just remember the family uh this little boy I can't even imagine what that must feel like so just uh remember all of these needs and each one this coming Sunday we will hand out the ballots for the vote of confidence we will not be collecting him this Sunday so we will give them to you if you for some reason aren't here to get one you will have your opportunity to fill out your ballot let's turn in our Bibles I want to preach to you tonight it's a little bit from thank you amen for our song leader tonight for our musicians tonight just feel really blessed a lovely atmosphere can we say Amen to that it's just good sister April had no idea you would be here tonight I was just just telling brother Isaac in the back that just the work schedule alone would make me want to never be a doctor and uh so forget about the work itself just the schedule and uh so we're happy to see you here tonight and God bless you to each one brother Yannick each one of you I say God bless you tonight we're happy amen you know it's going to seem like I can't get away from this but I'll just turn to First Peter the second chapter the fifth verse you see my brother and sisters we look at this this scripture just keeps speaking to me because it's not talking about a tearing down it's not talking about uh any other Avenue but it is actually a real Focus to build up and I say in the day that we live in this hour that we're living in right now God is building up a church amen now we want to we'll touch on these if we get to it and don't get sidetracked like last Sunday and I don't go off on a tangent and embarrass myself and whatever but uh you know the word is coming my brother and sister and is just slowly building this bride up it's not a just a magical thing that goes poof and we're ready for a Rapture but can we honestly from our hearts tonight say God is building us amen and I look and as the uh colored sister was you know praise God I'm not what I used to be and and that really makes my heart Rejoice that we're not just stagnant we're not sitting here just hoping but God is doing a work and while sometimes we get discouraged in our own self realize God's the one in control amen he's the one that's setting the timepiece he's setting the pattern ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices so if the devil ever comes and starts to beat up on you remember God's called you not to offer up your feelings your emotion your circumstance but to offer up a spiritual sacrifice that can be hard sometimes my brother and sister we get a little lonely we get a little discouraged the things we face and and the Devil comes in and starts to holler and make his noise and we think now I I know I'm speaking to real Believers tonight and we get to the place that we would actually tell ourselves I have nothing to offer God but this scripture declares otherwise whether we feel like it whether we think it's true or not he said that we were called up to offer spiritual sacrifice so I tell you remember this scripture and just hand it to the devil amen and tell them I'm sorry you've missed the boss you've missed the memo you weren't there when it happened I was God called me to offer up a spiritual sacrifice amen acceptable to God by Jesus Christ and I want to just go ahead and move on down the chapter as we have these last few Wednesdays but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that ye should sow forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in time passed so my brother and sister this is telling you this is a present tense scripture right now tonight amen which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy have we obtained Mercy tonight amen I stand with confidence tonight knowing I have obtained Mercy amen Heavenly Father Lord we just come tonight Lord such a lovely atmosphere and I thank you Father it was my prayer today Lord and I don't believe just my prayer but the prayer of the Saints Lord that you would just come tonight and speak to us and Lord just strengthen us build us up Lord that when we leave tonight Lord we would truly be able to say from our hearts it was good and not good but great to be in the house of God Lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for guidance we thank you for love Lord we also thank you for the word tonight in your name amen you may be seated Saints amen you know as we look at this and and um there's just times my brother and sister that I myself personally not to make emphasis on a personal level but there's times that I just uh read a scripture and every time I read it I might be reading it over and over and over again but every time I read it it seems as though it speaks to me in a fashion it speaks to me in a way that I had not thought about or I needed that little bit of encouragement at the moment and and God is so faithful that way to to just let his word be a Living Word to us can we say Amen it's a Living Word it's not a word that we read in a historical fashion and I enjoy these words of Peter that he's speaking to the church because they're definitely positive words words of affirmation and you know as uh you know I forget what the name of that book was a certain uh I'll what was that thing that you know the one that has the different types and one of those is affirmation I forgot what they call that book yeah yeah so you know you look at that and realize that you know in in a something like that they would write and say okay now your personality would be such that you are a person than affirmation but I'm here to tell you tonight every one of us is a person that desires affirmation amen we're here as Sons and Daughters of God God designed us to desire not encouragement of the word that continually lifts us up builds us up and you know sometimes we we come in a little state of life and and we just simply need a word of affirmation and uh you know if you raise your children without any words of affirmation you'll have children that if they have any self-confidence it will certainly come from somewhere but not you and so we are called as parents to give words of affirmation strengthening amen but I love Paul's words to the church because the emphasis here is upon the overcome summer even though the word Overcomer is not in these verses right here my brother and sister he's talking about the Overcomer he's speaking to those that have looked at the word of God Amen can we say the word is a good word amen the word is an encouraging word the word lifts us up and so the emphasis is to the Overcomer and we realize these words uh won't mean near as much to the make-believer my brother and sister now the prophet of God spoke about three kinds of Believers and we recognized in the whole context over all of the church but my brother and sister we sit here tonight and I believe I'm speaking to Believers amen and uh do you feel the same way yeah if any of you don't um well anyway but we're we're speaking to Believers we're speaking to Overcomers and the word is here in our midst to build us up to give us words of affirmation that builds our confidence and our trust amen you see Satan has worked for all these thousands of years to undermine Humanity's trust in the word of God and he he's done such efficient job that you'll have certain polls there are certain religious uh pollsters that that you know uh uh go and and they're kind of check the pulse of modern day Christianity and you know when you have polls that come back that show a very high percentage of Christians don't read their Bible a very high percentage of Christians don't believe in Divine Healing a very high percentage of Christians don't believe in the indwelling of the Holy Spirit Now isn't this a paradox that everything that makes Christianity that's a part of that's part of the foundation of but that's how well Satan has undermined it we can have the identity of Christian with no faith in God no trust in God at all no expectation from God I'm here tonight with great expectation amen you know I don't like to talk about it but you know I have blood sugar issue I don't claim that but I'm telling you with full expectation I believe I am healed in the name of Jesus Christ I don't care what the lying vanity or symptom says I believe the word of God and if the time would Terry and brother Paul passed away still with blood sugar issues my brother and sister that doesn't change my fact I believe my God Is My Healer and while I still have personal traits in my natural life that I am working to overcome I believe he has delivered me amen I'm not sitting here saying woe is me but I'm standing you hear a man that's been delivered because the word of God says so and I trust that word amen so it's there these won't mean much to the make-believer and will be almost nothing to the unbeliever amen I always Marvel at the wisdom as brother Branham speaks and the man says well you know I don't believe that and brother Branham doesn't cut the man down but he just speaks these words that's okay because it's not for unbelievers so we're going to see here tonight by God's grace what God is doing as he's building up this spiritual house he's building such a broad Foundation my brother and sister we don't have to build a house that is some little skinny thing some little just little postage stamp of a house that God is building a broad foundation of the word that we can as Sons and Daughters of God live fully the promise of God Amen that means if you want to add on to your living room you go this way and God's got a foundation for you you want to add on to the kitchen or make a sun room in a spiritual sense if you know what I'm saying you can go right out there and add on and God's got a foundation there for you we don't have to move off the foundation of the word to fulfill those things that are in the natural desires of our Lives can you say Amen to that amen when I say natural desires I'm talking about you know if you want to be the one that flies the airplane that's great if you want to be the one that jumps out of it that's that's great also amen I wouldn't mind jumping out of an airplane as long as it's sitting on the ground but you see what it's doing you sit here tonight my brother and sister identified as Victorious we're not identified in the word as as a defeated people not identified in the word as a husband or a might be but we are identified tonight in the word of God as a Victorious people in other words one that has already take possession of the promise of God and watching it being fulfilled in their life it's one thing my brother and sister you can take a Barney pole and uh Barney or pull and they talk about well Christians say this Christians say that my brother and sister I want to see what Christians are doing I don't want to hear about what they say they're going to do my do should do have done in the past but look at the life that's happening and you say oh brother Paul I don't know there's some things well we'll we'll address that in just a minute okay but look at this here we're identified tonight as a Victorious people can we can we come in unity tonight and claim that we are a Victorious People in Jesus Christ amen now the devil's going to say but you did this and you did not that's got nothing to do with it my brother and sister not one thing to do with it amen so it's there amen we're Victorious People and we're here as a people with revelation amen now there are so many things that I was going to add in and I took back out because I don't want to keep you here all night but my brother and sister are the prophet of God one declared of all the things that we as Believers should pray for Revelation would be one of them I want to ask you does God answer your prayer amen has God opened the word to you is God speaking to you are you being enlightened is the word being quickened to you amen so what do we have we have the word being fulfilled tonight prayers being answered tonight because we're not sitting here tonight saying well let me go check and see what this theological idea is let me go see what this Seminary says but we're here my brother and sister with a point of view What God Says is good enough Hallelujah amen I'm going to lift my hand and say thank you Lord that I could read between the lines amen this is not a cliche my brother and sister I don't represent it as a cliche but it is the revelation of Jesus Christ that allows you to look between the line and see what the world does not see sister Jerry showed me a little clip the other night and it was there that This Woman's explaining something about uh being a Christian and all of these things and she looks so ungodly I'm not being judgmental I'm being factual so ungodly explaining the scripture I'm sorry apply it first and then preach it to me I don't care who we are apply it first here take this pill no one's ever taken it and if you get well no take it yourself I'm sorry I'll deviate for just a moment but some gentleman very rich multi-billionaire man from Germany is talking about how there's too many humans on the earth and we need to get rid of some of them if he really believe that why would he start with himself hmm no he's not another interpretation of that that's like the preacher amen telling you how to live and you can't see the evidence God help us right that's straightforward boy that just skinned the height off of me didn't it amen I won't elaborate all I'll embarrass myself again Amen in the rising of the Sun just wanted to get into our thought here and one day when I was weary hmm brother Brown was weary myself and I said if you boy you'd better go ahead you're 50 years old if you're going to do anything for the Lord you better hurry up and do it you're getting old my 50 years old brother didn't feel like he had done a single thing and we sat here tonight whatever our age might be and say I just don't feel like I'm doing anything for the Lord here's a prophet that has seen the Supernatural manifested and unfolded before the people and he's saying I don't my brother and sister he wasn't being uh what would you what was the right word he wasn't you know kind of cutting down on himself for sympathy or anything like that I believe he's speaking from his heart that that's the very nature of a real Christian is I want to do more for the Lord I need to do more I want to live a better life I want to be a better example amen it's a desire God's put in us because imagine if we had a different attitude well I have done so much let's see I think we find him in Scripture even though the scripture doesn't make that direct tie here's a rich young ruler as the years unfolded who said my barns are full all is well I think I'll just take my rest and it was in that moment God called him my brother and sister what would we be we would be the fattest laziest Christians ever we've got the message praise God I can just lay down on my laurels no sir God left the hunger in you and I had a brother one time told me he said brother Paul I just never feel satisfied and I was like praise the Lord praise the Lord otherwise we'd lay down on the job amen you're getting old see and there that morning the quickening power come and he let me look over the curtain and I've seen all of you over there aha see he said all that you ever loved and all that loved you their give to you see and I've seen them all over there like that what was it quickening power John the Revelator was filled full of quickening power that stood up and seen the end of the uh in from the beginning Isaiah was full of the quickening power and stood up and seen the Millennium and all now let's stop right here let's not move on did you guys catch something right hiding right there in the middle of the quote something that sometimes is misused misrepresented misappropriated and put out in such fashion my brother and sister now look at this he was there beyond the curtain and there that morning the quickening power come and he let me look over the curtain and I seen all of you amen he didn't see a herd of branham's he didn't see all just his best friends he says I seen all of you and then he goes right into all that you love and Ever Loved You who was he speaking to my brother and sister he was speaking in the context of a bride of Christ loving a prophet in a prophet's office the word says we give him honor and we need to be partakers of that honor so we honor the word and we honor the prophet and the word comes back it's not about this natural love it's not about I hunted and I fished and I I got to laugh and joke my brother and sister all that loved him I say today in the right context because I am not an idolater I am not in fact I struggle because I lean the other way a little bit but he looked over and he saw me he saw you and then he immediately steps into and he let me know he let me see let me hear he let me understand he gave me Revelation he gave me quickening power that all that love me and all that I love and I can tell you the sacrifice that he made as a man amen shows that he loved the Bride of Jesus Christ because he sacrificed not everything my brother and sister he had his times he had his Joy but I tell you we won't go into there but I can tell you that his wife sacrificed his children sacrificed and he sacrificed and he did it because he loved us he loved us through the word amen but look at this what it is all that you ever loved and all loved you that give to you are these all branhams no this one you led to the Lord as an old wrinkled end of life sister I think we could preach a whole series of sermons right off of that right there amen I've seen them all over there like that you see to recognize them my brother and sister if it was his brother and mom and dad and uncle and no sir it was this bride it was you and I that he loved and we're here today through the word of God in honor to the office and honor to the sacrifice given loving him amen oh the world would twist that they would say say proof you're following a man well if we're following a man we're doing a poor job because I've never seen a man yet that could open the word and discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart what was it was it quickening power stood up seen the end from the beginning Isaiah was full of quickening power and stood up and seen the Millennium and all now look at this my brother and sister as John the Revelator was filled full of quickening power stood up and seen the end from the beginning if we were turning our Bibles tonight and we'll just be very quick so you don't need to but Genesis 1 2 amen says that the spirit of God moved amen so we're seeing that it moved upon the Deep amen so it moved upon every seed that God had already deposited it was nothing to do with Adam amen it wasn't anything to do with what come in the future it was the seed that God had already placed in the spirit of God move and those Spirits amen of that seed came to life amen by his Spirit moving over them the spirit that was in them came to life and so we're here my brother and sister we're called by the word of God to live in the spirit is that not right God doesn't want us to be just old dead cold formal people amen and the prophet of God teaches us if you want to you know study it out on the Sabbath you'll understand that the Sabbath is is spoke of being the Lord's day so we are living here today and we are living in the Lord's day but is that Saturday or is it Sunday so a prophet of God had to come in and settle this equation because these believe it's Saturday these believe it's Sunday and the prophet of God showed us and said every day to the believer is the Sabbath amen so we live in the Lord's Day amen not just one day a week that we go and get suddenly religious or two days a week we get suddenly religious we as the bride of Christ are living every single day in the Lord's day amen and so if every day is the Lord's day then let us live in the spirit amen because as it was that the word anointed moved on the Lord's day and let it move upon us on the Lord's day that we can live in the spirit did that make sense amen now look let's just move on and Isaiah was full of quickening power he stood and seen the Millennium and all quickening power and if the spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you it'll Quicken your mortal body remember quickening power look what we've seen in this day the quickening power has come to us to open the Seven Seals now he didn't say the quickening power came to me foreign you see this mystery of the Seven Seals that people want to complicate there are some that just got it so twisted up that you can't even hardly even comprehend how they've come to this conclusion when the prophet speaks words like this amen this wasn't like in 1948 or something my brother and sister if dates matter to you just look at the date and you'll realize God was finishing up opening up a revelation to the people that we might grasp this that we wouldn't be sitting here saying did he mean this did he mean that what is this it says a quickening power has come to us did you know in the proper context of Old English when you would be standing in a group of people and use the word us it is inclusive not one person in that group saying us identifies as me us means us and the prophet of God says it's come to us to open the seventh seal oh I'm going to step right out on a limb if you guys don't mind or thin ice or whatever you want to call it my brother and sister do you realize you were an integral part of the opening of the seventh seal amen there was no reason to open it if there was no believer to believe it if there was no one to take a horse of it and act on it and let it live then there was no reason to bother even opening it it had to be a people as a prophet of God speaks a select or special group of people that were able to realize through the word and say you know what there's something about this and I have to identify with it not I might if I can explain it I might if this circumstance something inside of this group of people says I must identify with this do you believe the seals are open yes explain it I can't why because it's not the prophet says explainable because it actually comes by revelation and Revelation comes by quickening power my oh my prayer tonight go ahead wrap your mind back around to prayer tonight without this I can't have this and laugh out this can't go here I believe that was ordained to God I about jumped out of the chair and shouted Hallelujah and ran down the back of it but I'm getting old and feeble and I probably would have fell off and I'm

quickening power of God foretold this would take place see the quickening power of God made the world testify to it it's the truth the angel of the Lord I told you was around in a pillar of fire quickening power let the world testify that it's the truth and in that they didn't know what it was until Angel Lord give inspiration turn it that's right yeah that's exactly right now if the Lord would give inspiration to take a picture taken by someone else to prove what it is imagine the inspiration he gives at the opening of his word it's not dead letter it's not just a book we're reading we're not looking backwards or looking forward we're living it amen this opening of the seventh seal God privileged US to live it my brother and sister not talk about it not argue about it not fuss about it not put it on a shell oh my brother and sister he said No at the opening of this seal there's going to be a people then are going to take this book and eat this book and they're not going to stop until they've eaten all the books and then they're gonna go and say you know it can be hard to live this message it can be hard to do this now give me some more give me some more Hallelujah oh my Hallelujah I'll get a little excited here if you don't mind amen made the world testify so much it put it in a magazine that at the time was one of the preeminent magazines in the world all right amen amen they didn't know what it was and we knew don't tell me you've never been this way before that people will be like well this is this and this answer to this is this and the answer is no no it's this is and you're sitting over there I know the answer world falling apart come on my brother and sister we're all falling apart a World's nervous what are we going to get this president for another four years is it going to be this is going to be that what's going to happen in the economy what's going to the bride is saying oh a prophetic word says there's nothing left but the coming of the Lord no we don't have to look to Washington for an answer and look to Boise for an answer look to Warren Buffett for an answer my brother and sister we look to the Lord for the answer because we have a prophetic word that says there's nothing left but a bride laying in the presence of the Sun oh Lord let me just hold still let me hold still don't let me be that nervous Nelly that just gotta keep going gotta find an answer and there's got to be something we're missing got to be doing just lay still amen Hallelujah he is the one the angel of the Lord I told you was around in a pillar fire quickening power let the world testify it's the truth and in that they didn't know what it was and we knew amen just look Ed away and it's our Lord up there you see he's talking about the picture just look at this amen now let's go to the next page there brother Gideon amen hallelujah what's that Top Line say that's right Hallelujah well that William Branham sure took a lot of credit for this and did that and he said this and he said that and said it was his Revelation I think what I'm reading amen it ain't what I'm reading he's passing along you know in the corporate world those who have been around the corporate world there's a lot of credit taking you know if you work for a company and you invent something it's the companies they had nothing to do with it they never did it I knew a man met him one time the man's very successful very wealthy he's old now wouldn't trade his age for his money but um he uh he had such a novel idea such an incredible idea he come home one day he had been secretly sketching this out and doing all this stuff and he come home one day and told his wife honey let's go party tonight let's go let's go celebrate she's like what are we celebrating I quit my job she's like wow what'd you do I said I quit my job today and he wouldn't tell her why six months went by he went down to a patent office laid it on the table patented it sold the idea off I think it was General Electric and made millions and millions in royalties but you see it would have got no credit and here's a prophet a man are you with me tonight could have pulled this in and said look what I've done but that would have made him a liar so what's he do he says well actually the answer to this the revelation of this he this is where this come from he's the one who opened the seals he is those seals for the whole word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was past tense opened amen what is the opening of the seals then revealing Christ and we got people today saying the seals aren't open my brother and sister this is going to sound harsh but I'm going to say it anyway you can look at what they preach you can look at how they live and realize something is missing because they're saying it's closed it's closed what they're actually saying is I never met Christ because you meet Christ you recognize the seals are open I've met him he's come in my presence I've been allowed to look upon him I've been allowed to worship him in his presence that is the word my brother and sister and the Very seven angels which represented the seven churches all completed and we couldn't even see it they did they took the picture not us and there he is standing there Supreme judge showing that he is alpha and omega beginning and the end what identification I'll just throw this in here it's not in this quote but when that picture was taken I was in him you were in him amen when they took that picture on Sunset Mountain they took a picture of you oh people be like that's weird no it's not I've been in him from the foundation of the world before amen and if I was in him then I'm in him now amen he hadn't exactly forgot me somewhere remind me of a time I knew some people you know they went home the mom starts to cook supper and I forget what their little boy's name was I'll just call him Junior they were like where's junior he needs to wash up oh jump in the station wagon tear down the grocery store run in there and there's the manager with Junior he said no you don't get him back the police need to talk to you and they're there in the foyer of a grocery store honest officer you have to understand what kind of kid he is he's here one second the guy's like I got a kid like that and I've never left him anywhere amen took him for a little while to explain it and basically the cop said I'm going to check up on you imagine we forgot our kid imagine the Lord Jesus Christ got down about the fifth Church age just forgot who you were no not gonna happen amen if I can just preach and quit talking we'll get this done amen Howard did that oh we'll go back up they did they took they took picture not us see so it wasn't God God didn't let it be you know a believer taking the picture believer with the early version of Photoshop no sir he let men might have been Godless then but he let men that had no connection maybe even doubts take the picture Supreme judge alpha and omega beginning in the end what identification quickening power what do you guys catch this quickening power did that to us I'm here tonight I'm here to tell you Saints quickening power has done something to you amen it wasn't I got some religion I started going to church it was quickening power it was a ThunderBolt from the Throne of almighty God come down and struck the seed in you just as it was in Genesis my brother and sister the moving of the spirit moved on us oh I got saved at this day well technically you might say that but I'll tell you technically you were saved from the foundation of the world Amen it was just the light shining on you amen quickening power did that to us quickening power let us see his coming quickening power snatched us from death to life brickening power gives discernment to know what's wrong with you now look at this my brother and sister I'm going to step out on another limb did we okay on that other limb hey man I'm gonna step out on the limb do you realize what God's doing now sometimes a prophet would come down or or maybe a minister I've seen it I'm not boasting but I've seen it I've preached it and people say that's exactly right but my brother and sister what happens oftentimes at the preaching of the word we see our own faults that's right we see our own weakness I thought the Brothers the start of this service was gonna just maybe launch right in my brother and sister what do we got to do when we see we got to repent we can't just sit there and say okay I see my problem that's not the anointing that's on the bride of Christ the bride of Christ is like oh I see my failure Lord forgive me and we we go when we start to do something about that Amen to know what's wrong with you and what to do and what you have done and what you ought not have done and what you should have done and what you will be now we could even just totally apply this to the prophet but I believe the prophet's words were to me amen amen and there's times that we know we should and I know I shouldn't have right and it would have been better if I would have but I didn't and God still loves me oh Hallelujah quickening power all these things oh my brother and sister I'll tell you what I get excited about this amen what an identification look I'm these words just leaped out at me when I was studying quickening power did this to us it's quickening power that took me from where I was and put me here it's not quickening power that made me a a Pampered you know young boy a Pampered this or pampered Christian I've still got to fight you've still gotta fight but go on through quickening Power did this to us can someone say thank you Lord for quickening power tonight amen it's changing our life now I'll tell you what this just gets better as we go on you thought I was at the end of the quote didn't you I'm reading a book to you amen hallelujah our lord Jesus is so full of quickening power he was all of it together he was so full of quickening power he said this you destroy this body and I'll raise it up in three days talk about confidence and quickening power destroy this body and now this Temple and I'll bring it up in three days why what do you say that he knew that it was written of him well I'm going to tell you my brother and sister amen he knew what was written of him by the word of God which could not fail I can't help it I've just got to leap off of this and Jump Right In I'm telling you tonight we the bride of Jesus Christ know what is written of us and we know God's word cannot fail amen that's how you can have confidence to stand in the age that we stand in why what Satan would say I'm going to destroy your life I'm going to do all of these things and we can stand and say not unless my Lord gives you approval amen go ahead fill out the application send it in and wait for a millennia to see what God's answer is to your request amen why because my brother and sister this bride of this hour that Victorious lady we were talking about she is recognizing through the lines um why did only one leper come back because when Jesus spoke by quickening Power by revelation he started now look how God works I don't want to get sidetracked here but look how God works he's already headed down the path to the priest and quickening Power who is my priest and he just come down to a stop theirs my priest it changed the direction of his life don't think of a man just walking down a trail or a road stopping turning around we're talking about God changing directions of lives not just footsteps lives amen so our lord Jesus knew the word said will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell and he knowed that quickening power would raise him up that there wouldn't be one cell corrupt he said you destroy this Temple and I'll bring it back again in three days now my brother and sister I want to say if the prophet of God preaching this word and he's preaching it to a bride of Christ would we not have confidence in that quickening power that we could stand here and say this word amen is not going to bring me short of the Rapture it's not going to take me away from the Rapture this word has been quickened to a bride is going to take me into the Rapture because I and the opening of the revelation of Jesus Christ I am his expression on the Earth today I am his life manifested and if he had such confidence that he would not suffer corruption then this bride of Christ should be able to stand with confidence and say I will not suffer corruption Hallelujah amen amen my ah I say Lord help us tonight to be the people who see what's written of us amen hallelujah now look at this I hope my little analogy isn't too far off hey man as we move forward here God has given us a grand opportunity you see we'll either look at it as a grand opportunity or we'll look at it as a burden let me bring a little clarity whose image do we bear b-e-a-r or b-a-r-e one mostly represented as a burden something you carry the other are precious girls and boys ears is naked I didn't misspell it because we can cloak ourselves any way we want to cloak ourselves but Who We Are it's when we stand naked before God no amount of cloaks no amount of garments no amount of our words no amount of our religion can cover us up when that day comes we are completely laid bare what will be our image then what will we look like what will we represent my brother and sister you know what the definition of religion is don't you to cover it what are we when we're laid bare religion don't matter no more that's why Through the Ages the greatest humiliation That Conquers put upon the conquered was to make them bear and March them through the streets but this bride quickening power I'm not talking in the flesh follow me says make me bear that's right I don't want one thing in my life covered up expose me Lord does that not go against our human nature expose Me Lord but this is the bride that the word says there won't even be a smudge on the hymn of her garment so she is willing to submit herself to a thorough cleansing that's right praise the Lord I I just felt like I left a little bit of confusion on that so forgive me for bringing that up tonight distracting it you see God's given us this Grand opportunity my brother and sister it's seven ages of Revelation it's not Seven Ages that it took God to fulfill his word it's seven ages of compound Revelation strapped up for you and I that we can see this is how it was in the beginning this is the next stage this is the next stage this is the next stage and we're seeing what a supernatural revealing of God that come to the culmination of the absolute revealing of Jesus Christ and God said I I can take the time I have no problem he didn't have any Supply resource issues he didn't have any any you know I've got to try and make this happen no my brother and sister he could have just snapped his fingers it would have been done Seven Ages of quickly power of revealed word now I I like my analogy because uh I I would have stayed in school and graduated if they'd done this but do you realize we've been given this quickening power of Revelation it's like an open book test at school could have even graduated if they'd just let me open the book yeah yeah teacher in history now Paul in the chapter were studying who was it left Spain on a ship and traveled where for how long and I'm like um I wasn't trying to be funny um oh I can't remember that Spanish dude's name um yeah anyway you sailed for a long time and she's like did you read this and I said um mostly and she's like what do you mean by mostly I said well I read the beginning and I read the end you know I learned that in church you might think it's funny but I learned that in church amen we read beginning and we read the end and we know the devil lost amen that's the whole book right there what do you mean details about 1612 and this and that and they died from scurvy and blah blah blah on the whatever no that matters they made it there that's all that matters but you see I want you to catch this now Satan keeps kicking your flesh into the Limelight why because you're a loser because you're defeated it's called distraction all he's trying to do is distract us from what the word said about us well rubber hits the road of any of us lately done something that we stopped and said why in the world did I do that okay and we're two there's a majority right now look at this my brother and sister Satan he's like but you did but you did you did what is it all he's trying to do is draw your flesh into the position where the word is supposed to be amen he's trying to pull our Flash in and when we get to looking at our flesh we certainly won't be looking at the word because the word says when our heart condemns us not then we have confidence in God so what is he doing he's actually stealing our confidence by getting us to look at our flesh and the more we focus on our flesh the more we feel like I couldn't be but let me tell you my brother and sister this quickening power that's in you God has let you as the bride know what's been written of you amen amen now I wanna I just I might just have to pick this up amen now I'm going to go somewhere right here my brother and sister that you might might wonder where I'm coming from I just recently was listening to a man and he was being interviewed by obviously another another former believer and they're talking and the man is like yeah you know what about this denominational Spirit around the message this man's like strongest denominational Spirit I've ever seen they can't do anything until they hear from headquarters and you might say what are they talking about but I'm sitting there in my chair praise the Lord can't do thing until I I've heard from headquarters but headquarters doesn't have an address it doesn't have a phone number the headquarters is here on Earth but it's walking in Flash today a man walking and talking and living and manifesting that's the hearing of headquarters I want to hear that still Small Voice I want to hear that leadership of the Lord but you see how that Spirit would come and they've got a quickening on them but it's a quickening to look and find and to classify and to put it and know there might be some that fit that gentleman's point of view it's not the Bride of Jesus Christ The Bride of Jesus Christ has one voice that she hears amen and that makes me really happy as a pastor amen that you're not relying on my voice you're not relying on my knowledge you're not relying on what I can reveal to you but it's God himself making quickening power into our soul and the word become a Living Word it became a flaming sword a Living Word coming from the Throne of almighty God oh Hallelujah cause this bride knows what is written of her I'm not just a church member I'm not just a Christian as it were I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ amen The Book of Revelation makes it very clear she's clothed in fine linen the righteousness of the Saints not clothed in some carnal look some carnal deal some carnal explanation but in the revelation of Jesus Christ this my brother and sister is the opening of the seventh seal when we recognize we are in Christ and we are all he said we would be oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah I've got so many more notes we just need to stop hallelujah sister vika would you come amen while she's coming walk slow sister Bika amen what causes us to do this amen Philippians 2 13 I didn't I don't think I gave this note to the brothers for it is God that worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure amen what happened we lost our mind had a man that's left a message one time on telephone conversation told me Paul you've lost your mind I'm like praise God hallelujah because my mind calls me a lot of trouble foreign amen thank you Lord of your good pleasure yeah we'll stop right here I've still got some scripture some quotes different things here yeah my brother and sister I was gonna die for a moment to the resume of the church agents here but we'll we'll be okay you see in that first stage the indictment I do want to close this out the indictment was as they left their first love so there was a point in time that they were on fire and I hope you catch this point they were on fire but they had left their first love they had moved away from their first love [Music] and God doesn't come as it were with an indictment you know good people [Music] I'm going to judge you and send you to Hades no what does he do he says return repent and just return back do your first love just come back I tell you what God's been gracious to me oh do I know what it's like that the Lord said just return back just do a little repenting see it stirred my heart when that come out the first of the service just a little repenting just come back but you see there's got to be a quickening power revealed to us what we are coming back to I don't want to go back our family being what it is there's Catholics there's Mormons there's an Nazarene there's methodists some Pentecostals to throw it in without quickening power we wouldn't know what took the god-riching mercy Mercy says look just repent and come back to your first love and my brother and sister what happened is we just bypassed all of these distractions people would be like what are you doing can't you just be like us no I Heard a Voice call me first love and when I didn't even know that I loved him I realized I love him because he first loved me and all I can do tonight is say thank you thank you Lord Jesus this is a beautiful Revelation my brother and sister that God is giving to us God in Simplicity to realize that we are a part of the opening and the revelation of the seventh seal Christ himself he said I'm going to show myself in your flesh oh my brother and sister that's the message of the hour hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my oh my let's just stand sing a song or two before we go I know that there are some that this is keeping you late but I'll tell you my brother and sister God is just so gracious to us so loving so kind inspiration that Drew you to the word in the beginnings the same inspiration that will draw you right through this world and right into a Rapture and right Beyond The Rapture right into the Throne of almighty God hey man I I heard a brother put it this way God's never going to ask his bride his wife to sit in the balcony Hallelujah she's right there as a prophet of God we'll get into it on another Wednesday she's right there in the throne oh not even on the throne my brother and sister because that shows a letter of operation but in the throne means that they became a part of the very Throne of almighty God oh Hallelujah falling in love 1013 brother Gideon oh Hallelujah Falling in Love with Jesus [Music] Jesus is the best thing I've ever done falling in love with just worship Him Saints let him know how much you love him tonight love with Jesus [Music] is the best thing I did
