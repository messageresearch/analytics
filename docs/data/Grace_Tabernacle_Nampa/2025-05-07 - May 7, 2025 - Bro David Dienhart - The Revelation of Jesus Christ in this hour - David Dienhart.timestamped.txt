[31:38] [Music]
[31:43] 433 D.
[31:46] Oh soul, are you
[31:50] weery and
[31:55] troubled? No light in the
[31:59] darkness you see.
[32:02] [Music]
[32:05] There's light for a look at the
[32:13] Savior and life more
[32:17] abundant and
[32:22] free. Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[32:32] Look full in his
[32:36] wonderful
[32:40] face. And the
[32:42] things of earth will grow
[32:47] strangeely
[32:49] dim in the
[32:52] light of his
[32:54] glory and grace.
[33:00] through death into life
[33:04] [Music]
[33:08] everlasting. He passed and we follow him
[33:14] there.
[33:18] over us and no more hath
[33:23] [Music]
[33:26] dominion. For more
[33:29] than conquerors we
[33:36] are. Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[33:45] Look full in his
[33:49] wonderful
[33:53] face. And the
[33:55] thing of earth will grow
[34:01] strangely
[34:02] dim in the
[34:05] light of his
[34:07] glory and
[34:12] grace. His word shall not fail you. He
[34:21] promised. Believe him and all will be
[34:27] [Music]
[34:30] well. Then go to a world that is dying.
[34:40] his perfect
[34:43] salvation to
[34:48] tell. Turn your eyes upon
[34:56] Jesus. Look full in his
[35:01] wonderful face.
[35:04] [Music]
[35:09] Father will grow
[35:11] [Music]
[35:13] strangely
[35:15] dim in the
[35:17] light of his
[35:20] glory and
[35:23] [Music]
[35:25] grace. Remember, his grace is
[35:28] sufficient.
[35:30] And no matter what's going on, we we
[35:32] don't understand the suffering and
[35:34] what's going on in
[35:35] Ukraine in these different places, but
[35:39] God's grace remains the same for them as
[35:41] it does for
[35:43] us. The grace is
[35:45] sufficient. I understood that they lose
[35:48] a thousand soldiers a day in
[35:53] Ukraine. They're requesting calling for
[35:55] 30,000 recruits a month.
[35:58] And if they have to, they'll press them
[36:00] into service if they just step out of
[36:02] their
[36:04] house. So just just remember Ukraine.
[36:08] It's just really burdened. I appreciate
[36:10] the song. God bless you musicians. Thank
[36:13] you for the song service
[36:15] and look full on his wonderful face.
[36:19] Goes right along with my topic this this
[36:24] evening. And we what we we are called to
[36:28] do. Bring salvation to others. Who's
[36:31] going to bring it to others? Yeah. What
[36:33] are we called for? Yeah. Life comes
[36:36] through the body. That's right. Hello.
[36:39] Life comes only one way. Life comes
[36:42] through the body. And it's his body the
[36:44] life comes through. Amen. Amen. That's
[36:48] where life comes. That's where life is
[36:50] projected. That is the
[36:54] last commission. Amen. That's right.
[36:58] Amen. That's our true commission. We are
[37:01] here to represent Christ. He's here in
[37:04] the bride form. That's the promise of
[37:07] the hour. That's the promise that he
[37:09] said would be here. And and there's a
[37:12] people, the bride that sees it. Amen. So
[37:15] the my subject this mo evening is the
[37:18] revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour.
[37:20] Amen. Amen. The revelation of Jesus
[37:23] Christ.
[37:25] Not another hour. This hour, not another
[37:30] person, same person, just a different
[37:32] form. Same person.
[37:36] Amen. Amen. So, let's bow our heads for
[37:38] a word of prayer. Our heavenly father,
[37:40] we thank you that we can look beyond the
[37:43] outer man.
[37:46] We're thankful that for grace revelation
[37:48] to look to the revelation reality of who
[37:51] we
[37:52] are and walk in
[37:54] that. Lord, as you said that we look not
[37:57] at the things which are
[37:59] seen, but the things which are not seen,
[38:03] for the things which are seen are
[38:05] temporal, passing away. Lord, don't let
[38:08] the things of this world take a hold on
[38:10] our life.
[38:12] Don't let it take such a hold that we
[38:14] are saddened we can't give it up and
[38:16] give it away for the cause of
[38:19] Christ. Lord Jesus, you have a people
[38:21] that will stay true, that will be true
[38:25] because they were in thee, thy thought
[38:28] to be manifest in this hour. What a
[38:31] great revelation. What a what a
[38:33] fellowship the little bride has with
[38:35] each other. What a union. What a what a
[38:38] communion that we have, Father God.
[38:41] Now Lord, I present myself to you.
[38:43] There's it doesn't matter the number
[38:45] who's here tonight. Just where two or
[38:47] three are gathered together in my name,
[38:49] there am I in the midst. We have not
[38:53] come to see man. We have come to see
[38:55] you. And that seeing isn't an outward
[38:58] seeing. It's an inside revelation
[38:59] because Lord, you're fellowshipping with
[39:03] yourself. And we are here to manifest
[39:06] and glorify you. and the promised word
[39:09] for the hour and season which we are so
[39:12] thankful for Lord to realize the true
[39:14] identification we have of the literal
[39:16] life of Jesus Christ being manifested
[39:20] through us we thank you now and give you
[39:22] praise bless your word to every
[39:25] individual heart here Lord and those
[39:27] that don't know you in the true baptism
[39:30] of the spirit of God may you open their
[39:32] hearts to realize where they're standing
[39:35] Lord I pray in Jesus name. Amen. While
[39:39] you're standing, I'd like to turn to
[39:41] Hebrews chapter 10. I
[39:43] have I have several me several services
[39:46] or several I should say um subjects on
[39:51] my heart. Not for tonight obviously, but
[39:54] that have been burning on my heart. Two
[39:56] major services that'll take some time to
[39:58] bring it out. And and but God has a
[40:02] time. God has a a time for everything.
[40:05] and uh and seeing real need and and just
[40:09] a time for everything he does and it may
[40:13] be here. It may be out somewhere else
[40:14] but but I just but the Lord laid this on
[40:18] my heart this evening just a simple
[40:19] message and yet a deep one. Do you
[40:23] realize simplicity of God is deep?
[40:26] How many know that you cannot in your
[40:29] humanness know what the simplicity of
[40:32] God? It's too deep.
[40:36] But when it's revealed, it's so simple.
[40:39] Goes beyond human calculation, human
[40:41] understanding, human. Because if a human
[40:44] says, "Well, that's simple." That
[40:45] probably isn't in God's eyes.
[40:48] That's the truth. So, so we'll just turn
[40:51] to Hebrews chapter 10 here. And and and
[40:54] I'm thankful if you prayed for this
[40:56] service, your prayer, I know, will be
[40:58] answered. We can't pray in vain. God
[41:00] said, "I will answer." We really believe
[41:02] him. Amen. There's somebody gonna
[41:04] believe him. And what you believe you
[41:06] get. Amen. I just want you, you cannot
[41:09] fear anyone unless you believe them.
[41:12] And we fear God because we believe him.
[41:15] You can't fear the devil without
[41:16] believing him. Right.
[41:19] Hello. Amen. If you accept his fear, you
[41:22] believe him. You're going to get what
[41:24] you believe.
[41:27] Hallelujah. That's quite a statement,
[41:29] but that's that's a that's a real true
[41:31] statement. And so let's believe the
[41:33] word. So be it unto me according thy
[41:36] word. I took that last time we
[41:37] ministered. At thy word, Lord. Don't try
[41:40] to inject your thinking. Don't try to
[41:42] inject your ideas into it. Take it what
[41:44] it said and believe it. Confess it and
[41:47] walk forward. And don't turn around with
[41:50] it. Amen. Just you don't have to figure
[41:52] it out. Don't try to figure it out.
[41:54] Don't reason with the devil about it. He
[41:56] said it. He'll do it.
[41:59] That's the faith we should have.
[42:02] got to be manifest. God can't fail.
[42:05] Amen. Hebrews 10 chap chapter 10 verse 5
[42:10] through 7. Wherefore when he cometh I
[42:13] want you to notice this. How many
[42:15] believe he's cometh? He's come into the
[42:18] world and saith sacrifice and offering
[42:21] thou wouldest not. But a body hast thou
[42:23] prepared me?
[42:26] In burnt offerings and sacrifices for
[42:28] sin thou hast no pleasure. Then said I,
[42:32] lo, I come in the volume of the book.
[42:36] Amen. What book is that? The book in the
[42:39] hand of the one mighty angel that stood
[42:42] in Revelation 10:2. Behold, I come in
[42:45] the book. In the volume of the book, it
[42:48] is written of me. May God make that
[42:51] personal to you tonight. It is written
[42:54] of me to do thy will, oh God.
[42:58] Now look, it is written of me. So be it
[43:00] unto me according to thy word. It is
[43:02] written of me to do thy will. Don't you
[43:05] think we ought to look into it and see
[43:06] what the will of God is. Isn't that
[43:08] right? Amen. You can be seated. Turn
[43:11] with me to First Timothy 3:16. There's
[43:14] three verses, three scriptures here I
[43:16] want to bring to the service. Now, I
[43:19] said my subject or my title is the
[43:22] revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour.
[43:25] And I'm putting emphases of the
[43:26] revelation of Jesus Christ in this
[43:29] hour. And my subject is the bride's
[43:32] perfect
[43:34] position. You know, that's a that's a
[43:36] powerful statement when you realize
[43:38] there's none of us humanly are perfect.
[43:40] Right? But there is a perfect place, a
[43:43] perfect position, a perfect joy, a
[43:45] perfect happiness, and that's only in
[43:47] one person.
[43:49] Amen. So, so the
[43:51] bride, the we're talking about tonight,
[43:54] the bride's perfect
[43:56] position. And remember the title, the
[43:58] revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour.
[44:01] The bride's perfect
[44:03] position. The word manifested thought.
[44:07] The word manifested thought. God
[44:09] becoming material in the bride form.
[44:14] What is it? The fullness of him.
[44:20] You wonder what the message of Malachi 4
[44:22] was. Remember, I want to know what the
[44:24] message of of uh and and Revelation 10:7
[44:28] was to finish the mystery of God.
[44:31] Is that right? Yes. All right. So, we
[44:34] have a powerful message and that message
[44:36] is not known to everyone. It's revealed
[44:39] in secret.
[44:41] Hello. The seventh seal. It's revealed
[44:44] in secret.
[44:46] Silence. And then right
[44:51] the silence denotes a
[44:53] secret but it's being manifest and lived
[44:56] out.
[44:58] But there's only one people that know
[45:00] that and it's not makes and and I say I
[45:02] wasn't going to say they're not a yes
[45:03] they are. They're a special
[45:06] people in God's sight. They're special.
[45:09] They are special. They have one purpose
[45:12] one goal in mind. That's to be the
[45:14] manifestation of the fullness of himself
[45:16] in this hour. Amen. And what is that
[45:19] revealing? The son of man again. Not
[45:22] another person. Him. Same name, same
[45:26] life, same
[45:28] position. Amen. Amen. What was his
[45:32] position? He was the manifestation of
[45:34] the word of God in the fullness of
[45:37] revelation. Is that right? And we belong
[45:39] to a body which is the fullness of him.
[45:42] Right? We have a measure of that, but
[45:44] still it's the same chemicals in that
[45:46] spoonful as it is in the whole body. So
[45:49] you have a part and I have a part. Amen.
[45:53] All
[45:53] right. All right. So we read sec 1
[45:56] Timothy
[45:58] 3:16. 1
[46:03] Timothy. Well, I'll get to it
[46:08] here 3 and verse 16. and without
[46:11] controversy. Now, we're talking about
[46:13] the revelation of Jesus Christ in this
[46:15] day. Without controversy, great is the
[46:18] mystery. Notice that's not mysteries.
[46:21] It's mystery.
[46:22] Great is the mystery of godliness. What
[46:26] is godliness? Like God. Yeah.
[46:30] And to be like God, you have to have the
[46:32] spirit of God. Yeah. To know God, you
[46:34] must be born again. You have to have the
[46:36] spirit of God dwelling in you. Right. So
[46:38] great is the mystery of godliness. God
[46:42] was can we say what he was? He is. Yes.
[46:46] And will be. So God was manifested in
[46:50] the flesh. I'm bringing it down to our
[46:51] day now. God is manifested in the flesh.
[46:54] I don't believe I added anything to
[46:56] that.
[46:58] Whatever he was, he is. Yeah. So God was
[47:01] manifest in the flesh, justified in the
[47:04] spirit.
[47:05] Amen. Yes. Hello. That's a capital S
[47:09] there. Spirit.
[47:11] Though you never did it in the first
[47:12] place, never regarded. Not even
[47:15] accounted to you. Justified in the
[47:17] spirit. Amen. Seen of angels, preached
[47:21] unto the
[47:22] Gentiles, believed on in the world,
[47:26] received up into glory. My, what a
[47:30] perfect position. Yeah. All right. So
[47:34] now Ephesians chapter
[47:40] 1 and verse 22 and
[47:43] 23. You know the Bible ought to become
[47:46] very familiar to you. Say every
[47:47] scripture you're tuning to us is
[47:49] familiar. Yes, it ought to be familiar.
[47:51] But there's a mystery laying behind
[47:52] those words and that's the thought of
[47:54] God. And it takes God to reveal it to
[47:56] you. And without the new birth, you'll
[47:58] never understand it. You'll never see
[48:00] it. Yeah. It takes a new birth to see
[48:03] God to know God because it's the spirit
[48:07] of God in you that reveals him. All
[48:09] right. So, so verse 22 and hath, who's
[48:13] he speaking of? Let's just take verse
[48:16] 21. Far above all principality and power
[48:18] and might and dominion. What a position.
[48:21] And every name that is named not only in
[48:24] this world, but also in that which is to
[48:26] come and hath put all things. Can you
[48:30] say all things?
[48:32] Under his feet. How many are a member of
[48:36] his body here? That's under his that's
[48:39] the feet. Yes. If you're the skin on the
[48:41] bottom of the feet, every devil, I don't
[48:44] care who he is, what he is, or what
[48:45] position he comes in, at any time, at
[48:48] any place, he's under he's under the
[48:50] feet of Jesus Christ. Amen. That's
[48:52] right. God. Amen. He's under his body.
[48:56] Yes. Because he's the head of that body.
[48:58] His body is his body. Amen. All right.
[49:02] So, and hath put all things under his
[49:04] feet, and gave him to be the head over
[49:07] all things to the church. So, fear not,
[49:11] bride. He's the head over all things.
[49:14] Amen. Amen. That's right. Okay. Which is
[49:19] his which what is his body, which is I'm
[49:23] excuse me, his head over all things to
[49:25] the church. the church which is his
[49:27] body. The church is his body. The notice
[49:32] may this just leap at you. It's amazing
[49:34] how we can read a scripture and all of a
[49:36] sudden you see it. You've read it and
[49:38] read it and read it and all of a sudden
[49:39] there's you just unveiled itself to you.
[49:42] That's revelation which is his body. The
[49:45] fullness of him.
[49:48] What is the body? The fullness of him.
[49:51] What was the message in our day? the
[49:53] full revelation of Jesus Christ through
[49:56] the opening of those seals that sealed a
[49:58] hidden mystery that God had in the back
[49:59] part of his mind that would not be fully
[50:02] known until now. The book of Revelation
[50:04] is sealed with seven seals. The whole
[50:06] Bible's sealed, but that book is sealed.
[50:08] I mean, I may know that it's sealed. And
[50:10] that revelation that those seals contain
[50:14] is the fullness of him.
[50:18] All right? and his body, the fullness of
[50:21] him, him that fillth all in all. All in
[50:26] all, all who? All that's in the body. He
[50:30] fills every every member, every person.
[50:32] It don't matter. It's him. Every member
[50:35] is him. Yes. Amen. Hallelujah. Talk
[50:38] about a fellowship divine. We ought to
[50:40] fellowship in this. What a perfect
[50:41] position. What a manifested word. What a
[50:45] material God has become into made
[50:47] manifest. See? Amen. All right.
[50:50] So, so 1 Corinthians 12:27 said that you
[50:55] are the body of Christ and members in
[50:57] particular. 1 Corinthians 12:27 said you
[51:00] are his body. You are the body of
[51:04] Christ. What is the body of Christ? His
[51:06] body. So you are the body of Christ and
[51:09] members in particular. Particular is
[51:11] different. Different ministry different
[51:14] manifestation of one man, one person.
[51:17] Particular means
[51:19] particular in your act in your ministry.
[51:22] Amen. Just like my ear is different my
[51:25] eye, my eyes is different than my mouth.
[51:26] My mouth's different from my toes. My
[51:28] toe is different from the cell. But
[51:30] every one of them
[51:32] is him. So what is the name of every one
[51:35] of those members? What are titles? What
[51:37] is the member of what is the name of
[51:39] every one of those titles? Jesus Christ.
[51:42] That's his body and you are his body.
[51:45] What a perfect position.
[51:49] Amen. Flawless.
[51:51] Why? Because it's Christ. Remember 1
[51:55] Corinthians 12:12 said he is he every
[51:57] member. He is He is the body. He is
[52:00] Christ is Let's just read it. I just I'm
[52:03] right there. 1 Corinthians
[52:09] 12 and verse 12. 12:12. And for the
[52:12] body, as the body is one,
[52:17] one. How are they one? They have one
[52:19] head. All right. As the body is one and
[52:22] hath many members, and all the members
[52:25] of that one body, being many, are one
[52:30] body. Amen. So is Christ. For by one
[52:34] spirit are we all baptized. Baptized
[52:37] means to be birthed or born from above.
[52:41] It takes the Holy Ghost baptism is the
[52:44] new birth. Don't you let nobody else
[52:46] tell you any different. The baptism of
[52:50] the Holy Ghost is the new birth because
[52:52] the Holy Ghost depends on what seat it
[52:54] falls on. You say, "Well, there's many
[52:57] baptized with the Holy Ghost. You don't
[52:59] have a new birth." Is that possible?
[53:00] Yes, that's possible. But the true birth
[53:03] and we and the the prophet
[53:05] differentiated in that when he said and
[53:07] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[53:09] that it fell upon his seed.
[53:12] And when the seed was quickened, what
[53:14] was it? Himself.
[53:16] So the new birth is a revelation of
[53:18] Jesus Christ or the revelation of Jesus
[53:20] Christ in you is the new birth. Amen.
[53:24] Amen. It's not an imagination. It's not
[53:26] I hope so. It's a living reality, a
[53:29] living person, a living being. And it
[53:32] manifests and glorifies God in the hour
[53:34] and time. And you will see your hour and
[53:37] your time and the message of this hour.
[53:40] And you will yearn to be like him. You
[53:42] will yearn to have revelation. You will
[53:44] yearn and seek God in this hour. Amen.
[53:48] And you have to seek him in one
[53:50] place. And that's where that's through
[53:53] the message of the hour. Amen. Because
[53:56] that word you say the message in the
[53:59] word. Yes. The message is the word. The
[54:01] word is the message. Amen. All right.
[54:05] Because the word comes to his prophets.
[54:08] Amen. Amen. All right.
[54:12] Now, Ephesians
[54:14] 5:28, I'm just covering these real
[54:17] quickly here. Ephesians 5:28 says
[54:25] this, "For no man ever yet hated his own
[54:28] flesh." I'm talking about his body. For
[54:31] no man ever yet hated his own flesh.
[54:34] Amen.
[54:36] Whose flesh are yours? Who's Who's your
[54:38] Who owns you? Right. Well, I own me. No,
[54:42] you Well, no, you don't. David doesn't
[54:44] own it. Christ does. That's right. He
[54:47] stamped himself on it. It may be
[54:50] corrupted, but remember what he said. If
[54:52] the spirit of Christ lives in you, it
[54:54] shall also quicken your mortal body by
[54:57] his spirit that dwelleth in
[54:59] you. Amen. So, we can expect God to
[55:02] bring this body under obedience to his
[55:04] word by his spirit. Now, that's the
[55:08] believer.
[55:10] Paul said, "If you live in the spirit,
[55:13] you shall not fulfill the lust of the
[55:14] flesh." Galatians 5. And then verse 25
[55:18] said, "If we live," Paul said, "if we
[55:19] live in the spirit, let us also walk
[55:22] right in the
[55:24] spirit, not hearers only, doers."
[55:28] Because if the spirit of life lives in
[55:30] you and you walk in that spirit, and I'm
[55:33] coming down to this because we're
[55:34] talking about his
[55:36] faith, we we have a perfect place to
[55:39] walk in, to judge by. We have a perfect
[55:42] place to live by, to live from.
[55:46] Amen. And it isn't this man, right?
[55:51] But that which is in
[55:53] you, Amen. His word revealed is
[55:57] perfect. And it's not in man's way of
[56:00] calling perfect. It's God's way of
[56:02] perfect.
[56:07] Unchanging,
[56:09] unfailing. It can't fail. Do you realize
[56:11] if born again your his spirit in you
[56:14] living in you cannot
[56:15] fail and cannot cannot change and cannot
[56:23] lie. Amen. Amen. What a place to
[56:26] believe. What a place to live from. We
[56:29] have a perfect position.
[56:32] Okay. So now, so no man ever yet hate
[56:36] his own flesh, but nourisheth and
[56:38] cherisheth it, even as the Lord the
[56:41] church, for we are members of his body,
[56:45] of his flesh, and of his bones. Verse
[56:48] 32, this is a great mystery, but I speak
[56:52] concerning Christ and the church.
[56:56] Amen. All right. Now in in the message
[57:00] things that are to be, you see the whole
[57:04] program, this is on paragraph 36. You
[57:07] see the whole
[57:09] program, the whole church is built upon
[57:12] divine revelation. Right?
[57:16] Jesus said in Matthew 16, "Flesh and
[57:18] blood has not revealed this to you."
[57:21] Amen. So you don't you don't you'll
[57:23] never get it by trying to study it and
[57:25] figure it out, right? You might as well
[57:27] just lay down your figuring out and
[57:30] start and start saying, "God, you know
[57:31] what I need, right? Show me. Reveal it
[57:34] to me. You promised it. Don't let me try
[57:38] to reason it out and figure it out."
[57:40] Yeah. You didn't ask me to do that. You
[57:43] said, "They that wait upon the Lord
[57:45] shall renew their strength." Yeah.
[57:47] Amen. All right. He said, "So flesh and
[57:51] blood has not revealed this, but my
[57:53] father which is in heaven has revealed
[57:55] this to you." Now watch what he says.
[57:56] What was it? Brother Bram says, "What
[57:59] was it?" A revelation of who he
[58:05] was. Now, I'm coming to something here.
[58:07] Now, listen. A revelation of who he was.
[58:11] Now, he's coming to something here. This
[58:13] is what we we're talking on. And upon
[58:17] this rock, now rock in the Bible, this
[58:19] is Brother Aram's own words, speaks and
[58:21] and means revelation.
[58:25] Rock in the Bible means revealed the
[58:28] revelation. Revelation. Just as in Psalm
[58:32] 62, David said, "God is my rock." What
[58:35] is he saying? God is my revelation.
[58:39] I wonder if we can see that today. Yes.
[58:42] God is my revelation. What a what a
[58:44] standard. What a place to stand. What a
[58:46] position. God is my revelation. Amen. I
[58:50] have to fret over it. God is my
[58:52] revelation. If he's ever revealed to you
[58:55] that you are become one with him.
[58:59] Amen. Not twain, right? You're in union
[59:02] with Christ. God is the bride's
[59:06] revelation.
[59:08] Okay? And upon this rock. Now, the
[59:10] revelation, now he says, a revelation of
[59:12] who he was. Now, watch what he says. He
[59:15] said, "I'll build my church upon the
[59:18] revelation of who?" Let's put it who he
[59:22] is. Brother Brandham said, who he is,
[59:24] who he was, who he
[59:26] is. All right. Now, watch what he says.
[59:29] And the gates of hell can't prevail
[59:31] against it. Now, watch. The revelation
[59:34] of Jesus Christ in this hour. The
[59:38] revelation of who he is in this hour.
[59:43] Amen. Right
[59:48] now you don't see him in the form he was
[59:50] there in the man form he was there but
[59:53] you see him in man form as he is now.
[59:56] It's the re still the revelation of
[59:58] himself as as
[1:00:01] as Eve. We don't we her name was not Eve
[1:00:04] there but say Mrs. Adam was the mystery
[1:00:06] of Mr. Adam. Yeah. And she had to come
[1:00:10] forth. That's right. She was a hidden
[1:00:13] mystery. Notice he she was the hidden
[1:00:16] mystery.
[1:00:19] She was the capstone revelation.
[1:00:22] Amen. Amen. Of Adam.
[1:00:26] That's right. Stop and think about that
[1:00:28] one a minute. Amen. Without her, she was
[1:00:31] he was not complete until she was
[1:00:33] manifest
[1:00:35] because he was alone. And God was alone
[1:00:37] and he desired fellowship with himself.
[1:00:39] So God said, "I'll take out of him a
[1:00:41] help meat for him, right? That he may
[1:00:44] fellowship with and he can come down and
[1:00:47] fellowship now with his family because
[1:00:49] God has become family." Amen.
[1:00:53] Now you see where it's coming right
[1:00:54] back. We're right at the point now where
[1:00:57] we're going back to the seventh day of
[1:01:00] Eden. That's right. How many know that's
[1:01:03] right? We're going to go right back to
[1:01:05] where we left off.
[1:01:07] pick it right up because eternity rolls
[1:01:09] on.
[1:01:11] Error and faults and failures don't
[1:01:14] hinder God. It just hinders the
[1:01:15] believer. God allows it so he can
[1:01:18] manifest himself,
[1:01:20] manifest his attributes. We know that.
[1:01:22] All right. So we see here then so the
[1:01:25] revelation now we're speaking of here
[1:01:28] now the revelation of who he was. The
[1:01:30] revelation of Jesus Christ who he is in
[1:01:33] this hour.
[1:01:36] What would what would that be? The gates
[1:01:37] of hell are not going to prevail against
[1:01:39] this. That's right. All right. Not what
[1:01:42] he was in another hour. The revelation
[1:01:44] of Jesus Christ in this hour, not what
[1:01:47] he was in another hour. Right?
[1:01:51] They had their m they had their portion
[1:01:54] in those days. But now we've turned a
[1:01:56] corner. Amen. We're in seed time. We're
[1:02:01] in virgin word time. Virgin born word
[1:02:04] time.
[1:02:06] Amen. There's a shout. Remember the
[1:02:08] church ages. Each one had their ages.
[1:02:10] And the seventh age had come open with
[1:02:12] this, a shout, saying, "Behold, the
[1:02:15] bridegroom cometh." Yes. Yes. And they
[1:02:18] all rose and trimmed their lamps. Did
[1:02:19] all that rose and trimmed their lamps
[1:02:21] make it? No.
[1:02:23] But who made it? They that were ready.
[1:02:26] How were you made ready? Before the
[1:02:28] foundation of the world, you were chosen
[1:02:30] in him. Amen. Is that right? So you were
[1:02:33] made ready and they went into a union
[1:02:36] and the sign was the sign of that union
[1:02:39] that we seen in the heavens. Whose
[1:02:42] picture was that?
[1:02:45] Amen. And what's he uniting with? His
[1:02:48] body. Amen. Where's the revelation then
[1:02:51] of Jesus Christ in this hour? His body.
[1:02:57] All right. So we see not what he was in
[1:03:01] another hour but what he was now. See
[1:03:05] see Hebrews 13:8 Paul brother Bram's
[1:03:09] trying to get us to see he remains the
[1:03:11] same. He does but he's immorphed into
[1:03:14] another form here. It's still him.
[1:03:19] She was Mrs. Adam. She wasn't nothing
[1:03:21] different than Adam. She had Adam's
[1:03:23] spirit. Not another spirit. She had
[1:03:25] Adam's spirit. Eve. I'm talking about
[1:03:27] Mrs. is Adam had Adam's spirit, right?
[1:03:30] Yeah. That right.
[1:03:33] So, whose property was she?
[1:03:38] Amen.
[1:03:40] What's the revelation in our day? Amen.
[1:03:43] See, we've we've had a we've had a a
[1:03:46] spoken word creation. We are being born
[1:03:50] again, a spoken word
[1:03:53] creation. Amen. a spiritual spoken word
[1:03:57] creation. Amen. Right now, we are living
[1:04:00] in heavenly places. Seated now. Amen. I
[1:04:04] was going to bring that scripture, but
[1:04:06] I'm talking about the perfect the
[1:04:08] bride's perfect position. We're now
[1:04:10] seated in heavenly places in Christ.
[1:04:15] Now, now will be sons of God. We are
[1:04:18] sons of God.
[1:04:20] Amen. and the spirit could come upon and
[1:04:23] could reveal himself to us because we
[1:04:25] are
[1:04:29] amens. All right. So we didn't become
[1:04:32] sons by the new birth. We were sons.
[1:04:36] Amen.
[1:04:38] Already. Yes. And that spirit just
[1:04:41] quickened that son to manifestation in
[1:04:44] their day, in their hour. That's why
[1:04:46] it's very important that we see the
[1:04:48] message for the season. And we must
[1:04:51] preach the message for the season as
[1:04:53] ministers. Yeah. Amen. We because how
[1:04:58] can the people grow? The faith is in
[1:05:01] laying in the promise of the
[1:05:02] word. Amen. Because faith ministered,
[1:05:05] faith comes by hearing the
[1:05:07] word. Faith lays in that and faith takes
[1:05:10] its resting place in that promised word.
[1:05:12] Because when that's revealed to you, a
[1:05:15] substance, nothing can take that from
[1:05:17] you because you already have it. Amen.
[1:05:20] We're just waiting as a pro as our
[1:05:22] brother said Sunday for the full re
[1:05:24] manifestation of what he promised. But
[1:05:26] we have to have it faith first. Right.
[1:05:29] It must reveal in you first in order
[1:05:31] because now you're not you're you're now
[1:05:34] how we how else you going to walk along
[1:05:36] and manifest Christ if it's not a
[1:05:37] revelation to you. How can we speak
[1:05:40] unless it's a revelation? How can we
[1:05:42] confess unless it's by revelation and a
[1:05:44] confession of faith?
[1:05:48] Amen. Amen. You see, we hold fast the
[1:05:51] confession of our faith.
[1:05:54] Amen. Not what we not what we just look
[1:05:57] at and quote quotes and quote
[1:05:58] scriptures, but what is revealed to us,
[1:06:01] right? Because we know the Holy Spirit
[1:06:04] will rightly divide the word. It won't
[1:06:07] it won't do otherwise. It's got to
[1:06:09] rightly divide it. When Satan said it's
[1:06:11] written, Jesus come back and said, "But
[1:06:13] it's also written." Yeah. Amen. One had
[1:06:16] the life of that word, the other which
[1:06:18] had just words and tried to pervert it.
[1:06:20] That's right. Amen. But but God answered
[1:06:23] him with the true revelation of the
[1:06:24] word. It is written, "Thou shalt not
[1:06:27] tempt the Lord thy God."
[1:06:30] Is that right? Where's the Lord thy God
[1:06:32] today?
[1:06:36] What's he coming to tempt? What's he
[1:06:38] against? Where's the struggle? It's
[1:06:40] working in you. But the struggle between
[1:06:42] Satan and the word, right? He does.
[1:06:45] Satan does not want expression. He hates
[1:06:47] the expression of the word. That's
[1:06:50] right. But you and I are here as that
[1:06:53] manifested thought. That word made
[1:06:56] manifest. The word manifested thought is
[1:06:59] who we are.
[1:07:03] Amen. All right. So he said not what he
[1:07:06] was in another hour. What he was now.
[1:07:09] Hebrews 13:8, the same yesterday, today,
[1:07:11] and forever. The Bible
[1:07:13] expresses it's growing in the
[1:07:17] bride. So where's the revelation? It's
[1:07:19] growing. It's growing in the bride.
[1:07:23] Brother Bram said perfect faith. He said
[1:07:26] his spirit, he's pouring out himself
[1:07:29] into the bride, and they are becoming
[1:07:32] one for the wedding supper. What? We are
[1:07:35] becoming one for the body change, for
[1:07:37] the meeting in the air. Amen. And how
[1:07:40] can we do that unless he come to unite
[1:07:41] with us, right? And so the second coming
[1:07:44] is his uniting with bride and becoming
[1:07:46] manifest in bride form. What are we
[1:07:48] looking for? Many people are looking for
[1:07:50] a second coming. And really what they're
[1:07:52] seeing re realizing it's the third,
[1:07:55] right? Because the third coming, the
[1:07:57] opening of the third coming and the
[1:07:59] ending of the second coming is our
[1:08:00] meeting in the air. Because the third
[1:08:02] coming is when he comes back and dwells
[1:08:04] on earth with his bride in a millennium.
[1:08:06] Right? Did not the prophet say the
[1:08:09] second fold of that three-fold mystery
[1:08:11] of that seventh seal is God in the bride
[1:08:15] form God in his people.
[1:08:19] Amen. And what are we ready for then? He
[1:08:21] says we're ready for
[1:08:22] Eden. Well, how was he to be manifest
[1:08:25] here in this day? What's the mystery of
[1:08:26] it? Amen. Is that he would be manifest
[1:08:30] in bride form. Other words, it's the
[1:08:31] bride coming of Christ. Amen. This is
[1:08:35] what the hidden mystery is. Yes, he
[1:08:38] couldn't let that out until this hour.
[1:08:40] Because if we did, Satan would try to
[1:08:41] pervert that. But he's too late now. He
[1:08:44] can't do it. And he knows nothing about
[1:08:47] it. That third pull, he can't know that
[1:08:49] third pull. Amen. The third pull is the
[1:08:51] opening of the word, and he's not the
[1:08:53] word to be opened. Amen. Hallelujah. But
[1:08:56] there is a bride that is that word to be
[1:08:58] open. Hallelujah. Amen. Yeah. That's why
[1:09:01] there's a a true, you know, don't let
[1:09:03] anyone ever tell you there's not a true
[1:09:05] evidence of the indwelling of the Holy
[1:09:07] Spirit. I've heard it said, "Well,
[1:09:09] there's no real no real true
[1:09:11] evidence." That's that's not the truth.
[1:09:15] You say, "Well, well, he might have said
[1:09:17] that, but watch what else he said
[1:09:22] because the message progressed." How
[1:09:24] many know that he didn't talk about the
[1:09:26] gene? He didn't talk about the gene seed
[1:09:28] of God until 65. Right. Yeah. You tell
[1:09:33] me if it's progressed.
[1:09:35] Yeah. Amen. See, so it's coming. It had
[1:09:38] to come to its maturity. This this
[1:09:40] message come to its head and its head
[1:09:42] and we have to come to the head because
[1:09:44] it's growing in the bride to a full
[1:09:46] stature. He said it's growing. This
[1:09:48] revelation is growing in the bride. So
[1:09:50] where is this revelation? It's a
[1:09:52] revelation of who you are. I'll build my
[1:09:54] church. Amen. Amen. And the gates of
[1:09:57] hell can't prevail against it. That's
[1:09:59] right.
[1:10:01] Because who you are is him. Amen.
[1:10:05] Amen.
[1:10:07] Hallelujah. Satan does not want this
[1:10:09] out. He hates this. And that's what the
[1:10:12] whole world that's why they're electing
[1:10:13] a new pope.
[1:10:15] Yeah. So they can continue to come
[1:10:18] against by their Chaldian Babylonian
[1:10:21] Babylonian
[1:10:24] idol worships of the trinity of three
[1:10:27] gods. They're coming against the true
[1:10:30] oneness of the true
[1:10:32] God. Amen. And the unveiling of his
[1:10:35] coming. And Satan can't stand it because
[1:10:38] there's a bride on earth that sees him,
[1:10:41] knows him, not knows about him. She
[1:10:44] knows him. She's in union with him. It's
[1:10:47] a relationship with him.
[1:10:51] All right. So, it's growing in the bride
[1:10:54] to the full stature. Other words, it's
[1:10:55] growing into the head form for the body
[1:10:58] chain. Remember, he said the head and
[1:10:59] the body would become soul in his such
[1:11:01] as image. She will be him. Yes. Amen.
[1:11:06] And that's another race.
[1:11:09] Yeah. Amen. You're living by another
[1:11:11] race. You're living in another position.
[1:11:13] Right. You ought to be living today out
[1:11:15] of another position. Sure, Satan comes
[1:11:18] in and upsets us. We can't perfect this
[1:11:20] flesh. We have troubles. We have tests.
[1:11:22] But every one of those things is for the
[1:11:24] going home of the bride. Lord, every one
[1:11:27] of them is bringing you and I to a total
[1:11:30] reliance and a dependency upon this
[1:11:32] word.
[1:11:35] Amen. Amen. Amen. All right. Now, so
[1:11:39] therefore, and brother Bram goes back
[1:11:41] now, and why therefore if the corn of
[1:11:43] wheat of Christ had to fall in the
[1:11:44] ground, that's St. John 12. You read St.
[1:11:46] John 12. If that corn of wheat had to
[1:11:49] fall in the
[1:11:50] ground, so did the bride have to fall to
[1:11:53] the ground through the dark
[1:11:55] ages. Any grain that goes to the ground
[1:11:57] must die or it can't re it can't produce
[1:12:00] itself.
[1:12:02] And the and the word there is reproduce
[1:12:04] itself. Amen. because it had to go in
[1:12:07] the ground. You You plant a corn in the
[1:12:09] ground. It's got to come forth and be
[1:12:11] whatever it was that was put in the
[1:12:12] ground. Has to come back to being what
[1:12:14] it is. That's exactly right.
[1:12:17] That God withheld the message. Said,
[1:12:19] "But in this message, in this day, I
[1:12:21] will bring a message of restoration of
[1:12:23] all things."
[1:12:25] Now, the prophet said, "Now I've
[1:12:27] introduced you to him." John was on
[1:12:28] earth at his coming. Do you realize that
[1:12:30] John was on earth and said, "This is
[1:12:32] whom I spoke of right here. He pointed
[1:12:34] us to the lamb and said, "This is he.
[1:12:38] This is my ministry. This is my
[1:12:40] message." And he's uniting with a
[1:12:43] bride. He's not coming right out in
[1:12:45] plain open sight that everybody can see
[1:12:47] him. He has to come in
[1:12:49] faith. Amen. Amen. Is that right? Yeah.
[1:12:53] If you don't have the faith of rapture,
[1:12:55] you'll never be in a rapture. That's it.
[1:12:58] That's right. The bride is looking for
[1:13:00] the revelation of the rapture. What is
[1:13:02] it? It's the rapture becomes substance
[1:13:04] in you. Amen. That gives you the
[1:13:08] rapture. Yeah. That identifies you in
[1:13:10] the rapture. The token identifies you as
[1:13:13] his property. You're his eternal
[1:13:15] possession. Now, nothing can take that
[1:13:17] from you. There's not enough mistakes
[1:13:19] and errors and failures. What we want to
[1:13:21] do is say, "Lord, I want to line up with
[1:13:23] your will, your word, and that's all
[1:13:25] that matters." I don't care what it has
[1:13:27] to take to get me to do it, but that's
[1:13:29] what matters. That's right.
[1:13:32] Amen. That's right.
[1:13:35] Amen. He's not going to take an
[1:13:36] imperfect bride
[1:13:38] home. He takes a perfect bride. That's
[1:13:41] why the later it gets, the later it
[1:13:43] gets, the later it gets. The door may be
[1:13:44] shut. We don't know. I'm not saying I
[1:13:47] have no idea. I hope it isn't. I still
[1:13:49] have I still have uh
[1:13:52] children, but there's one thing I know.
[1:13:56] They will not miss getting eternal life
[1:13:58] whether it's here or at the white throne
[1:14:00] judgment. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:03] Amen. That's exactly right. Because that
[1:14:05] token will if it's applied correctly
[1:14:08] cannot fail. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:11] Amen. It cannot fail. And the prophet
[1:14:15] said you apply it with confidence. Amen.
[1:14:18] Holding that token over your unmovable
[1:14:21] faith in the promised word. That's it.
[1:14:24] Because the token says it's mine, right?
[1:14:29] Hallelujah. All right. Now, so the grain
[1:14:32] goes to the ground, must die, can't
[1:14:34] reproduce itself. Brother Bram said it
[1:14:35] can't reproduce itself. And the great
[1:14:38] church that he established on the day of
[1:14:39] Pentecost by sending the Holy Ghost had
[1:14:41] to suffer martyrdom, go into the dirt of
[1:14:44] those denominations. Amen. And then come
[1:14:47] out and then come on out to the full
[1:14:51] stature. See, it had to come through
[1:14:53] Luther. It had to come through Wesley.
[1:14:56] Made way for the baptism. Made way for
[1:14:59] what? The person, the Holy Ghost himself
[1:15:03] to come right
[1:15:04] down back to the word again. A virgin
[1:15:08] born word of God again that has left the
[1:15:12] shuck. Yeah.
[1:15:14] Amen. What is it? It's his word. It's
[1:15:17] his word. It's his spoken word seed. His
[1:15:20] bride, he said, is his spoken word seed.
[1:15:26] Amen. Amen. Amen. All right. Because she
[1:15:29] comes from the same source he came from.
[1:15:31] Do you do you realize that he came from
[1:15:33] the same source? Let me read it to you.
[1:15:35] He said she's called the body of Christ.
[1:15:37] She This bride is the literal spoken
[1:15:40] word seed bride. Page 166 of the church
[1:15:43] aid book. And though she is feminine in
[1:15:45] designation, she is also called the body
[1:15:48] of Christ.
[1:15:49] Where's the revelation then? Yeah. All
[1:15:52] right. He said, "It is very apparent
[1:15:54] that she ought to be called that, for
[1:15:57] she was predestinated in him,
[1:16:00] came from the same source."
[1:16:03] Amen. Was eternal with
[1:16:07] him and is now manifesting God in a many
[1:16:12] membered
[1:16:13] body. Whereas once once God was manifest
[1:16:16] in one member even our Lord Jesus
[1:16:18] Christ. So we're coming to a conclusion.
[1:16:22] Amen. The word the thought expressed the
[1:16:26] logos is made flesh dwelling among us
[1:16:29] and is coming to a perfect perfect
[1:16:32] complete re body change by that that is
[1:16:36] taking us there.
[1:16:38] We're on the move. We're not standing
[1:16:40] still. We're marching right in step with
[1:16:42] the word. Amen. And if one little
[1:16:45] portion gets out of step, stay in line.
[1:16:48] Is that right? Then move in line. Don't
[1:16:50] argue with it. Don't reason with it. Do
[1:16:52] what he said to do and stay there. Amen.
[1:16:56] You say, "Well, I might miss this. I
[1:16:57] might miss that. I might not have this.
[1:16:59] I might not have that." It's not
[1:17:01] reasonable, brother David. At thy word,
[1:17:04] Lord, so be it unto me according to thy
[1:17:08] word. Amen. Lay down yourself. die to
[1:17:12] yourself. Take up your cross and follow
[1:17:14] him. Yeah. Amen. That's what God's
[1:17:16] calling for. That's what he
[1:17:19] wants. Amen. That's what he'll have in a
[1:17:23] bride.
[1:17:26] All right. So, we had to come through
[1:17:28] that and come out. And she comes out to
[1:17:30] the full stature. Luther Wesley
[1:17:32] Pentecost comes out to the full stature
[1:17:34] of the bride of Jesus Christ for the
[1:17:36] last day. And they that were ready went
[1:17:38] into the marriage. There's the corner
[1:17:40] turned.
[1:17:43] This is not this. We are out. We have
[1:17:46] been We have come out of Le Oysia.
[1:17:50] We are now in the in the very
[1:17:52] manifestation of the revelation of the
[1:17:54] rapture taking us to a body change. And
[1:17:58] that seed is manifested right now in the
[1:18:00] bride form.
[1:18:03] Talk about a fellowship. Where's our
[1:18:05] fellowship lay? It's two men in one
[1:18:08] body.
[1:18:11] That's fellowship. Yeah. And I can be
[1:18:13] different and you can be different. We
[1:18:14] can still have fellowship. And we long
[1:18:16] for fellowship. We desire fellowship.
[1:18:19] We should have fellowship. God desires
[1:18:22] fellowship.
[1:18:24] First is fellowship with you and his
[1:18:25] soul,
[1:18:27] him and you. Then that fellowship
[1:18:29] extends out to others in fellowship.
[1:18:33] Amen.
[1:18:34] Oh, but Satan hates that fellowship.
[1:18:36] He'll do everything he can to keep you
[1:18:38] on an island to yourself. Right. Yeah.
[1:18:41] That's exactly what he'll do because he
[1:18:43] hates gathering together because stone
[1:18:46] sharpen stone and these things are
[1:18:48] happening. And that's good for us.
[1:18:55] I'm speaking to
[1:18:57] myself. That's good for
[1:19:01] me. But all this mystery see the bride.
[1:19:05] See, in the full stature of the bride of
[1:19:06] Jesus Christ, the last day, what is it?
[1:19:08] Christ in the bride form.
[1:19:12] Amen. But all this mystery is revealed
[1:19:15] only. All this
[1:19:17] mystery, bride's perfect position, the
[1:19:20] mystery revealed, Christ in you, the
[1:19:21] mystery of God
[1:19:23] revealed. Perfect
[1:19:25] position. The open book reveals this
[1:19:28] mystery. All right.
[1:19:30] So all this mystery revealed only as he
[1:19:33] promised to his bride. Hell is against
[1:19:36] the truth of the revelation of this
[1:19:38] mystery. All hell's against it. What is
[1:19:40] it against? The revelation of Jesus
[1:19:42] Christ personally to you.
[1:19:46] That's what he's against.
[1:19:49] All right. Because because it'll bring
[1:19:51] forth expression.
[1:19:55] So all hell is against the truth of the
[1:19:57] revelation of this mystery. But the
[1:19:58] bride is standing on it. Let me read
[1:20:01] that again. The bride is standing on it.
[1:20:04] That's her stand. Now, why do you
[1:20:08] hunger, church? Why do you thirst? It's
[1:20:10] the father trying to reveal to you this
[1:20:13] hidden secret to you. Why do you hunger?
[1:20:16] Anybody hungry? I think there's a few in
[1:20:19] here that are hungry. Okay. Why? Why do
[1:20:21] you hunger? Why do you hunger? Why do
[1:20:23] you thirst? It's the father trying to
[1:20:25] reveal this hidden secret to you. But
[1:20:28] you let now brothers and sisters coming
[1:20:31] right down to where we are. Listen to
[1:20:33] this now. Well, he's telling us where we
[1:20:35] are, but right down the rubber meets the
[1:20:37] road. But you let
[1:20:40] so many things get it out of you. You
[1:20:42] let your job, you let your wife, you let
[1:20:46] your husband, you let your children, you
[1:20:49] let the cares of the world, you let some
[1:20:51] pastor, you let somebody else get that
[1:20:53] out of you when you know that way down
[1:20:56] in your heart, you're thirsting and
[1:20:57] hungry. It's God trying to reveal it to
[1:21:01] you. See the revelation, the last day is
[1:21:05] here.
[1:21:07] The opening of the seals, he said the
[1:21:09] end is come. Yes. He said, 'How long? I
[1:21:12] don't know, but we've arrived. We're at
[1:21:15] the end. All right.
[1:21:18] Now, all this book and all, excuse me,
[1:21:22] and all that's in this book is the
[1:21:26] elect. Amen.
[1:21:29] Would be
[1:21:31] him. For that's the believer. The words
[1:21:35] in the book. Remember he told Daniel,
[1:21:38] "Seal up the book. seal up the words
[1:21:40] until the time of the end. But the time
[1:21:42] of the end, the word would be loosed.
[1:21:44] Yeah. And you're the word in the book,
[1:21:47] right? Amen. Amen. Well, can what can we
[1:21:51] expect? We can expect the revelation of
[1:21:52] Jesus Christ for this hour to be known
[1:21:55] personally, right? Amen. That's what I
[1:21:58] expect. Amen. And every day it's a
[1:22:00] little step, one more step. Inch by
[1:22:02] inch, we're possessing what God's given
[1:22:04] to us. Amen. We've done crossed over. If
[1:22:07] you haven't crossed over, you need to
[1:22:09] cross over, right? Amen. Not stay on the
[1:22:12] other side, but come into your promise.
[1:22:14] Yes. Amen. All
[1:22:19] right. Okay. I'm going to bypass some of
[1:22:22] this. In the beginning, he wasn't even
[1:22:24] God then. No, God's object worship. Only
[1:22:27] thing he was was the eternal. And in him
[1:22:29] was attributes. And those attributes
[1:22:31] were
[1:22:32] thoughts. That's eternal thoughts.
[1:22:35] And that's what he come to redeem those
[1:22:38] thoughts he come to redeem and them as
[1:22:42] soon as it strikes them they see it
[1:22:43] because life is in there to strike. All
[1:22:47] right. How can you be born again? The
[1:22:49] seed of God must be in you.
[1:22:52] Okay. The whole thing Jesus said at that
[1:22:55] day at that day. That's this day. We
[1:22:57] know that this day we are here seeing it
[1:23:00] manifest. You shall know that I'm in the
[1:23:02] father the father in me. I in you and
[1:23:04] you in
[1:23:05] me. The whole thing is God becoming
[1:23:08] material. Amen. Like a husband and wife
[1:23:11] becoming one together. God and his
[1:23:13] church becoming one. Then he turned
[1:23:15] right around and said, "God and his
[1:23:17] church are no longer twain. They are
[1:23:19] one." Yeah. Why? Because she's
[1:23:22] pregnantated with his life. What's that
[1:23:24] do? That brings you in union with him.
[1:23:27] Amen. All right. God with his thoughts
[1:23:31] becoming
[1:23:32] material and that brings us with eternal
[1:23:35] life. The eternal life, there's only one
[1:23:36] form of it. That's
[1:23:39] God. And then it's God expressed in his
[1:23:42] church. Amen. God expressed in his
[1:23:45] church, God expressed in his son. It's
[1:23:47] the same God all the time. God above us,
[1:23:49] God with us, God in us.
[1:23:52] Just bringing the whole thing right
[1:23:54] back. You can't go any further than that
[1:23:58] than that one
[1:23:59] God. Amen. In the full manifestation of
[1:24:03] that one God. There's nothing beyond
[1:24:04] that
[1:24:06] and here we come to that God in us. God
[1:24:09] in bride form. God with us. God in us.
[1:24:12] Amen.
[1:24:14] All right. And then he was he is the
[1:24:16] eternal. In him was attributes. All
[1:24:18] right. Now he spoke it and it was word
[1:24:21] and the word made manifest. The word is
[1:24:23] made manifest. It's God becoming
[1:24:25] material. He drives that home over and
[1:24:27] over. I'm driving it home because you
[1:24:29] must see God becoming material.
[1:24:33] Amen. That takes all the struggle away
[1:24:35] no matter what you're going through.
[1:24:38] Yeah. Well, it's still a struggle. I'm
[1:24:40] not saying the struggle is not a
[1:24:42] struggle. It's a struggle. It's hard.
[1:24:44] It's not easy. But it takes the fear
[1:24:47] away from you. Amen. The struggle is not
[1:24:50] going to beat you down. The struggle is
[1:24:51] not going to take you. In fact, you can
[1:24:53] turn around and say, "Thank you, Lord,
[1:24:54] for the struggle. I will thank you in
[1:24:56] all things, giving you praise in all
[1:24:57] things." And rejoice in all
[1:25:00] things because it's not going to change
[1:25:02] you. It's not going to it's not going to
[1:25:04] take you out of his care. You're in his
[1:25:06] care. You're in his hands. He's become
[1:25:07] material in you. And he's goes through
[1:25:10] that struggle.
[1:25:13] Oh, that's a different thought, isn't
[1:25:14] it?
[1:25:16] All
[1:25:17] right. So, we are his faith and his
[1:25:20] name. Now, I want to get to this real
[1:25:22] quick. I've got about just a about 10 15
[1:25:25] minutes here. So, and then we are his
[1:25:30] faith, his name. Habac 2:4 said that we
[1:25:34] that we shall live in his the believer
[1:25:38] shall live in his faith. I'm going to
[1:25:40] just bypass it, not read these, but it's
[1:25:42] his faith. If you notice, his
[1:25:45] faith. All right. Galatians 2:20 said
[1:25:48] that we are crucified with Christ.
[1:25:50] Nevertheless, we live. Yet not I, but
[1:25:54] Christ that liveth in me. And the
[1:25:58] life the life that I now live, I live by
[1:26:01] the
[1:26:03] faith of
[1:26:06] the son of God. Not you live by the
[1:26:09] faith in the son. You live by the faith
[1:26:12] of the son. It's the same faith. Yes.
[1:26:15] Amen. That's right. So if he's
[1:26:18] manifested in us, then it's his faith.
[1:26:21] He lives in us. It's his faith. It's his
[1:26:23] name. Amen. Amen. And it's and it's in
[1:26:28] faith in his name and and by his
[1:26:32] faith. All right. As Peter said, silver
[1:26:35] and gold have I none, but such as I have
[1:26:38] give I unto thee. Amen. What did he
[1:26:41] give? What did he impart to that? He he
[1:26:44] imparted what? a reality, a revelation
[1:26:46] to that man led by the spirit. Jesus
[1:26:49] said, "I can't speak until the holy
[1:26:50] spirit speaks through me. I cannot
[1:26:53] speak." He said, "Only what the father
[1:26:56] what the father shows me I do." And the
[1:26:58] same harmony exists between the bride.
[1:27:00] When he told Jesus speak, he spoke. My
[1:27:02] father worketh hither to and I work. How
[1:27:04] can it be any different with the bride?
[1:27:05] It's the same person in you with the
[1:27:07] same character in you. And he does the
[1:27:09] same things he did yesterday and he does
[1:27:11] it today. Right? So if we know his
[1:27:13] character, Christ is his character.
[1:27:17] What are we growing into? Whose stature?
[1:27:19] Christ. Christ's own character. We
[1:27:22] wonder why things go around us and
[1:27:24] happening to us we don't know anything
[1:27:25] about. And God's pointing this to you.
[1:27:27] And then pretty soon you say, "Oh,
[1:27:30] then you see something and victory is
[1:27:32] yours. It's always been yours. Your
[1:27:34] victory is our faith." But what is our
[1:27:35] faith? It's his faith. If ye abide in me
[1:27:38] and my word abides in you, it's his
[1:27:40] faith. Right?
[1:27:42] Amen.
[1:27:43] Amen. So, it's his faith. Mark 11:22
[1:27:49] said, "Have faith in God." And the and
[1:27:51] in a subject margin on the schoolfield,
[1:27:53] it it interprets that and it says, "Have
[1:27:55] the faith of God." Right? Amen. So, have
[1:27:59] faith in God, but have the faith of God
[1:28:01] if you shall say to this mountain. Now,
[1:28:03] how can it fail? What a position to be
[1:28:05] in with this revelation. The revelation
[1:28:07] is our position. And in that position,
[1:28:10] how can that fail? How can that faith
[1:28:12] fail? And how can that name fail? So
[1:28:14] many times we act under under a feeling
[1:28:17] or under or under some uh like well I I
[1:28:21] feel impressed. Well, that may be so and
[1:28:24] it may not be so. But if it's a true
[1:28:25] impression of God, it's got to happen.
[1:28:27] Yeah. Amen. If it's a true revelation,
[1:28:30] you're not speaking. Remember the Bible
[1:28:32] said the word of God is nigh even in thy
[1:28:34] mouth, right? And in thy heart. What is
[1:28:36] that word in you? What is that word
[1:28:38] that's nigh thee in thy mouth? The Bible
[1:28:40] said it's the word of faith. The word of
[1:28:42] what? The word of faith. Who's whose
[1:28:45] faith?
[1:28:47] And who's speaking? Yes.
[1:28:52] Hallelujah. You see why you know that's
[1:28:55] why the Bible prophet by even even Paul
[1:28:58] said slow to speak and quick to hear.
[1:29:02] Amen. That's truth. Yeah. I mean I say
[1:29:05] too many things. I say too many foolish
[1:29:07] things. Amen. But when God says it, when
[1:29:11] it's revealed to you and you say it,
[1:29:13] it's not you speaking. It's not the man.
[1:29:15] It's not David. It's him.
[1:29:18] That's the communion. That's the union.
[1:29:20] That's the harmony that exists between
[1:29:23] him and his bride. Right? She's not
[1:29:25] walking haphazardly. Every step is
[1:29:28] ordered. Amen. Every move is ordered.
[1:29:31] Amen. Amen. That's what the word said,
[1:29:33] didn't it? Yeah. Okay, then so be it
[1:29:36] unto me according to thy word.
[1:29:39] Amen.
[1:29:41] I have to figure it out. Just commit him
[1:29:44] yourself to him. And then then don't
[1:29:45] take it back after you've committed
[1:29:46] yourself. Don't turn around and take it
[1:29:48] back. Well, I made a mistake in
[1:29:50] committing. You've committed him
[1:29:51] yourself to him believing he's leading.
[1:29:53] Then relax and rest in that leadership.
[1:29:56] Oh, it'll be radical. It'll be beyond
[1:29:58] your own thinking. But you've got to
[1:29:59] rest in the fact that you've given
[1:30:00] yourself to him, right?
[1:30:06] We get maturity mixed up. Except you
[1:30:08] become as a little child converted and
[1:30:10] then become as a little child, you shall
[1:30:12] no wise enter in a little child in what?
[1:30:15] Faith. Yeah. A little child's faith is
[1:30:19] simple and it's
[1:30:21] perfect. We don't want to accept that,
[1:30:23] but that's the truth. That's what Jesus
[1:30:24] said. That's able to just accept the
[1:30:27] word as my my father and that settles
[1:30:29] it. Right? That just settles it.
[1:30:32] He said so. That settles it.
[1:30:38] Doesn't child doesn't reason around with
[1:30:39] why daddy said it. He just believes his
[1:30:41] daddy.
[1:30:44] All right.
[1:30:47] Now, and so in Acts in Acts 15, I'll
[1:30:51] have you turn to Acts three, I mean
[1:30:53] three. Acts 3:15, Paul or I mean not
[1:30:57] Paul but
[1:30:58] um Peter over there in Acts is talking
[1:31:02] about when he spoke to the man at the
[1:31:04] gate
[1:31:06] beautiful something he had that he
[1:31:08] imparted to him and we talked about that
[1:31:10] earlier.
[1:31:11] Now three verse 15 he says
[1:31:16] why he did that. Let me read it to you.
[1:31:19] And and three yeah and killed the prince
[1:31:23] of life whom God has raised from the
[1:31:25] dead where and we are witnesses. Verse
[1:31:27] 16. And his name through faith in his
[1:31:31] name hath made this man strong. And and
[1:31:34] his name through faith in his name hath
[1:31:38] made this man strong. The faith which is
[1:31:41] by
[1:31:42] him hath given him this perfect
[1:31:45] soundness in the presence of you all.
[1:31:47] This is how brother Brandham says it.
[1:31:49] And Jesus and in and
[1:31:52] his at the gate and his Jesus name
[1:31:55] through faith in his Jesus name hath
[1:31:58] made this man formal cri former
[1:32:00] strong. Yay, the faith which is by him
[1:32:03] from by which is by or from him Jesus
[1:32:07] hath given him the man this perfect
[1:32:09] soundness in the presence of you all.
[1:32:12] See there it is Jesus name and Jesus's
[1:32:15] faith brought about the miracle. Amen.
[1:32:18] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:32:26] Now, okay, now it's seed time or bride
[1:32:29] time. The shucks are dead. If they're
[1:32:31] dead, life has left it. The shuckss are
[1:32:33] dried up. They're gone. No life in the
[1:32:35] shuck. How many believe that? When you
[1:32:38] begin to say, "I and my father one."
[1:32:40] Sound like what we're saying tonight,
[1:32:41] isn't it? I and my father are one. The
[1:32:43] shuck pulls away from it. It can't
[1:32:45] accept that. It puts it out of itself.
[1:32:48] Amen. And that's what's happens has
[1:32:50] happened. The virgin word time. The
[1:32:53] shucks are dried up. The ver the virgin
[1:32:55] word time, not touch, it's virgin. And
[1:32:57] he says,
[1:32:58] "Remember, it's virgin word time, but
[1:33:02] God's church is not touched by man or
[1:33:04] man-handled." Hallelujah. It's a virgin
[1:33:07] born, word of God made
[1:33:10] manifest. What's the bride? A virgin
[1:33:13] born, word of God made manifest. And
[1:33:17] when the word's manifested, what is it?
[1:33:19] Light. It's a virgin word of God made
[1:33:22] manifest. Jesus Christ. Who is it? Jesus
[1:33:25] Christ. the same yesterday, today, and
[1:33:27] forever. Hallelujah. How wonderful. I
[1:33:30] love it. I believe it. I know it's the
[1:33:33] truth. Do you know it's the truth?
[1:33:37] Ephesians 2:5-10. I won't read that, but
[1:33:40] by grace are you saved through faith. He
[1:33:43] called you when you were in sin. He
[1:33:45] loved you when you were unlovable. And
[1:33:47] he died for you and raised us up again.
[1:33:50] You died with him, raised you up again,
[1:33:52] now seated in heavenly places in Christ.
[1:33:55] For by grace are you saved through
[1:33:57] faith. And that faith is not of
[1:33:59] yourselves.
[1:34:01] It's not your faith.
[1:34:04] It's God's faith. And you are his
[1:34:06] workmanship. And that's God's gift to
[1:34:08] you. And what is that gift? Eternal
[1:34:10] life. And if we repent and be baptized
[1:34:13] and not stop, but go on to receive the
[1:34:16] Holy Ghost.
[1:34:19] I have something I'd like to bring on
[1:34:22] that here one of these days.
[1:34:25] and go on to receive the Holy
[1:34:27] Ghost, which is the gift of God, which
[1:34:30] is eternal life, the new
[1:34:33] birth. Amen. Amen. And you are his
[1:34:38] workmanship.
[1:34:40] Amen. Amen. Created in Christ Jesus.
[1:34:44] Brother Brandham said that created means
[1:34:45] in union with. You're his workmanship in
[1:34:48] union with Christ Jesus. Coming from the
[1:34:51] same source. Royal seed. He's royal
[1:34:53] seed. You're royal seed.
[1:34:56] Amen. And coming with from the same
[1:34:58] sort, you are his workmanship created in
[1:35:01] Christ Jesus unto good works. You don't
[1:35:03] have to figure out
[1:35:05] works. God's ordained the works you'll
[1:35:08] do.
[1:35:10] Unto good works which he hath before
[1:35:12] ordained that you should walk in them.
[1:35:15] There you are. You see, all that we've
[1:35:18] talked tonight is perfect rest. A
[1:35:21] perfect place, a perfect rest, a perfect
[1:35:23] peace, a perfect
[1:35:26] position. Amen. It's Christ. All
[1:35:29] right.
[1:35:32] Now, in the message of perfect
[1:35:35] faith, I'm going to close with these
[1:35:38] these next few things right here. All
[1:35:42] right. We are not growing in not a
[1:35:45] faith, but a perfect faith. It's built
[1:35:47] up in here in the soul. Watch a perfect
[1:35:49] God with a perfect heart keep a perfect
[1:35:51] promise by his perfect word. Yeah.
[1:35:56] All right. Then on page 68 or number not
[1:35:59] not page number paragraph
[1:36:02] 68 he says
[1:36:05] this. He said and God was in him. He
[1:36:08] knew with that perfect faith that he was
[1:36:10] the anointed Messiah that the spirit of
[1:36:13] God was upon him. Now there's a people
[1:36:16] in the land that know the same thing
[1:36:17] today.
[1:36:19] He said, "Now I in myself do nothing."
[1:36:23] Isn't that lovely? I in myself do
[1:36:26] nothing, but it's my faith in God and
[1:36:28] God was in him. The word made manifest.
[1:36:32] And when the word of God comes in you,
[1:36:34] it's made manifest for you are a
[1:36:38] believer. Now watch what he defines a
[1:36:41] believer. And a believer is the faith of
[1:36:45] God that moves in
[1:36:48] you. The believer is the faith of
[1:36:52] God that moves in you. Talk about a
[1:36:56] position. Yes.
[1:37:00] Knowing who he was. Paragraph 70.
[1:37:03] Without a shadow of doubt, he knew he
[1:37:06] was the son of God. He knew it. Yes. Oh,
[1:37:10] hallelujah. Amen. I'm glad there's
[1:37:12] faith. I'm glad for revelation. He knew
[1:37:15] it. There's a bride's going to know it.
[1:37:18] She knows where she is. She knows her
[1:37:21] position. She knows where she's
[1:37:23] standing. And Satan is trembling.
[1:37:27] Because his hour is soon. We're going to
[1:37:29] leave here, brother, sister. It's right
[1:37:31] upon us. You can see it. Amen. I don't
[1:37:34] know when, how long, but it's right
[1:37:36] here. Amen. Amen. It won't take many
[1:37:39] more turns and maybe yet this evening,
[1:37:42] maybe in the morning. We don't know.
[1:37:43] Amen. Amen. All right. But if you're not
[1:37:46] ready, you need to be ready. Amen.
[1:37:48] Because without the token, you're not
[1:37:49] going in a rapture. Now, that's just all
[1:37:52] there is to it. The literal without the
[1:37:54] literal life of Jesus Christ abiding in
[1:37:57] you. And I'd like to go into the
[1:37:59] evidence another time. I have, but I'd
[1:38:02] like to go into it
[1:38:03] again. Without that abiding in you,
[1:38:07] you're not going into rapture.
[1:38:10] That ought to either put a desperation
[1:38:11] in you or I don't care in you. Right?
[1:38:15] That statement right there ought to put
[1:38:17] a desperation in your heart to seek
[1:38:20] after him. He that seeketh, he that
[1:38:21] hungers and thirsts after God shall be
[1:38:23] filled. He that seeks me will find me.
[1:38:26] He that knocks, it'll be opened.
[1:38:29] But you're going to have to go where the
[1:38:31] source of life is to find him. And then
[1:38:34] he said you would receive it. That's his
[1:38:37] promise to you. You can step up there
[1:38:39] and say, "Satan, he promised me
[1:38:43] and I'm hungry for it." And there
[1:38:45] wouldn't be a deep in me calling for
[1:38:47] that unless there was a deep to respond
[1:38:48] for it.
[1:38:52] Amen. That's exactly right. So without
[1:38:55] that, you're being left. You leave. You
[1:38:57] You're not going. You cannot even see
[1:39:00] the message of the hour without being
[1:39:02] born of the spirit.
[1:39:05] You can't even worship him without being
[1:39:08] born of the spirit.
[1:39:12] That's the truth. All right. Now I I
[1:39:15] truly am closing. It's right time to
[1:39:18] close now. Just And then he turned
[1:39:20] around. He said, "The works that I do
[1:39:22] shall you do also."
[1:39:24] And he said, "A little while the world
[1:39:26] will see no more, but you shall see me
[1:39:28] because I'll be with you, even in you."
[1:39:31] Amen. The identification of a scriptural
[1:39:34] Christian, these words said, "Jesus,
[1:39:35] these signs shall follow them that
[1:39:38] believe." The word comes first, the sign
[1:39:40] follows.
[1:39:42] Amen. Is that right? The promise comes
[1:39:45] first, the word is manifest before you,
[1:39:47] the voice, and the sign follows. Now,
[1:39:50] where are you standing? You don't have
[1:39:52] to work that up. Pump it up. Make it
[1:39:54] happen. It'll happen for the word of the
[1:39:56] hour. You were ordained to be here for
[1:39:58] this
[1:40:00] hour and the word is in you for this
[1:40:03] hour. All right.
[1:40:09] Now, okay. He says
[1:40:14] this, Jesus had perfect faith. He had it
[1:40:17] and it come because he was the word. And
[1:40:19] you become the word. You believe become
[1:40:21] the word as you receive the word. If you
[1:40:23] abide in me and my words in you, see, if
[1:40:26] you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:40:28] you,
[1:40:30] how's his words abide in you? His faith,
[1:40:33] right?
[1:40:35] They're abiding. It's in you abiding.
[1:40:38] All right. Now, watch. He said to us,
[1:40:40] "If you abide in me and my word in you,
[1:40:42] you can ask what you will, it'll be
[1:40:44] done." Then recognize your position in
[1:40:46] the scripture as a believer. Then
[1:40:49] recognize your position in the scripture
[1:40:51] as a believer.
[1:40:53] He
[1:40:55] recognize your position as he recognized
[1:41:00] his position. Do you believe his
[1:41:04] position was perfect? So is yours. Yes.
[1:41:08] That's right. So don't let nothing keep
[1:41:10] you out of your position. Now, there's
[1:41:13] position in the body. You ordained to a
[1:41:15] certain position. Amen. that nobody else
[1:41:18] can take can take that position. But
[1:41:21] we're talking about the body as a whole.
[1:41:23] Her position is Jesus Christ revealed.
[1:41:26] It's himself. Amen. It's a perfect
[1:41:30] position. All right. My my how we love
[1:41:33] him.
[1:41:35] Amen. Look, Christ in you makes him the
[1:41:38] center of life of the
[1:41:40] revelation. I'm just going to I just
[1:41:42] want to read this slow. I'm closing with
[1:41:44] this. You can stand with me, but listen
[1:41:47] to it. I'm not I'm not I'm going to
[1:41:49] follow Keep following through here.
[1:41:51] Look, Christ in
[1:41:54] you makes him the center of life of the
[1:41:58] revelation. Right? See, Christ's life in
[1:42:02] you makes him the center of the
[1:42:06] revelation. Amen.
[1:42:08] Christ in the Bible would make the Bible
[1:42:11] what?
[1:42:14] the complete revelation of Christ.
[1:42:18] Is that right? And you're the words in
[1:42:21] the book.
[1:42:23] Right. Christ in you makes you
[1:42:28] what? The complete revelation
[1:42:32] of the whole
[1:42:34] thing. You talk about a position.
[1:42:38] What manner of people ought we to be?
[1:42:40] Yes.
[1:42:42] I think we ought to be more aware of
[1:42:43] what we're thinking, what we're saying,
[1:42:46] the words we speak. They carry spirit.
[1:42:50] Words are powerful. Yeah. God uses his
[1:42:53] words.
[1:42:56] God uses words. He always speaks in a
[1:42:59] word. His voice is heard in a word.
[1:43:02] Amen. It's speech. Jesus said, "Why can
[1:43:06] you not understand my speech? Is because
[1:43:08] you're not of my father. Because you
[1:43:10] cannot hear my word is the reason you
[1:43:13] don't know my
[1:43:15] speech. Who's going to know the speech
[1:43:18] of the bride? It sounds like it's all
[1:43:20] it's I just talks in such deepness.
[1:43:22] Brother, sister, it's so simple you
[1:43:25] can't even imagine
[1:43:27] it. If you think that's deep, well, it
[1:43:31] is
[1:43:32] deep. But to your thinking, it isn't.
[1:43:34] So, be careful what your thoughts are.
[1:43:39] Amen. Because without the revelation of
[1:43:42] this hour, without that corn, we're
[1:43:44] we're moved. We're in a bride time. We
[1:43:47] are in the seed time. Brother Bram said,
[1:43:49] "We are in seed time." That's a corner
[1:43:52] turned, he said, because it's no longer
[1:43:54] in the shuck. It's seed time. It's here.
[1:43:56] The seed is manifest. Now, and he to
[1:43:59] make sure you get it, he said, "Or bride
[1:44:01] time." Right?
[1:44:03] [Music]
[1:44:06] Then what is bride time? the revelation
[1:44:08] of Jesus Christ for this
[1:44:12] hour. Amen. All right.
[1:44:16] Now, what is it? It's all God becoming
[1:44:20] tangible. He said, "Now, you're the
[1:44:22] revelation thing." And brother Ram ends
[1:44:23] that with this. What? See what God is
[1:44:27] trying to
[1:44:29] do. What is it? It's all God becoming
[1:44:32] tangible and you're a part of God.
[1:44:34] Hallelujah. Ah. Amen.
[1:44:38] God's here in shoe leather this morning.
[1:44:40] It's here this evening. It's here in
[1:44:42] you. It's here in me. It's here in his
[1:44:44] bride around the world. It's here in his
[1:44:47] body. It's his body. It's his body. You
[1:44:50] are his body.
[1:44:53] What's quite a position.
[1:44:57] Special class of
[1:44:59] [Music]
[1:45:01] people. He was Elohim the eternal. But
[1:45:04] in him was thoughts. He wanted to become
[1:45:05] material. What did he do? He spoke the
[1:45:07] word and the word was materialized. It's
[1:45:09] Elohim materializing so he could be
[1:45:12] touched and felt. That's first John 1.
[1:45:15] We bring the message. We've seen the
[1:45:16] word manifest. We've touched him. We've
[1:45:18] held
[1:45:19] him. Whose feet have you
[1:45:23] washed? What comes here to take
[1:45:25] communion is those people are saying,
[1:45:28] "I'm born of the spirit and I'm in
[1:45:29] fellowship with the word."
[1:45:34] But we know not everyone that does take
[1:45:36] communion today. I wish that we could
[1:45:37] say that, but not all are born again.
[1:45:42] But that's not for me to judge who is
[1:45:43] who isn't. The point is when we sit down
[1:45:46] to wash feet, I'm washing the feet of
[1:45:47] Jesus Christ. It may be earthly feet,
[1:45:50] but those earthly feet will be changed
[1:45:52] one of these days. And the one that
[1:45:55] lives in those feet owns those feet.
[1:45:57] Right?
[1:46:00] That's it.
[1:46:02] So, let's start living from the soul
[1:46:04] realm, brother, sister. Let's not walk
[1:46:06] any more of what this temporal out here
[1:46:08] and judge ourselves by our temporal.
[1:46:10] Let's walk by the soul. Let's walk in
[1:46:12] his faith. Live in his
[1:46:15] [Music]
[1:46:17] faith.
[1:46:20] Amen. So, he said in the millennium,
[1:46:22] it's Elohim sitting on the throne. See,
[1:46:24] that's right. all of his subjects around
[1:46:26] him that he predestinated before the
[1:46:28] foundation of the world. We are facing
[1:46:30] that millennium.
[1:46:34] I believe that.
[1:46:36] Amen.
[1:46:39] Hallelujah. To you and I, the ages are
[1:46:42] over.
[1:46:44] Did you know that? To you and I, the
[1:46:46] bride, the ages are finished. Brother
[1:46:50] Brandon even said, "It's over." And it
[1:46:51] is.
[1:46:53] Who is he speaking to? We know Leodysia
[1:46:56] is going out of here, but that doesn't
[1:46:58] pertain to you and I.
[1:47:00] You and I are the seed word made
[1:47:04] manifest,
[1:47:06] revealed Jesus Christ. You are the
[1:47:09] revelation of Jesus Christ. By
[1:47:11] revelation, you know who you are. And
[1:47:14] when you know who you are, you know who
[1:47:16] he is. And when you know who he is, you
[1:47:18] know who you are. Amen.
[1:47:22] Amen.
[1:47:23] Then in the end it all winds up. God
[1:47:25] tangible. God in Christ tangible made
[1:47:27] flesh dwelt among us. And in that great
[1:47:29] millennium to come, God in the form of
[1:47:31] Christ sits upon the throne of David and
[1:47:33] the church is
[1:47:35] bride, husband and wife together. Other
[1:47:38] words, king and queen together. Do you
[1:47:42] know you're the ones the Bible speaks
[1:47:44] of?
[1:47:47] Do you know tonight that you are the
[1:47:49] ones the Bible speaks of? It's written
[1:47:51] of
[1:47:55] you. Do you know your position is in
[1:47:59] Christ? If you're in Christ, you're a
[1:48:02] new creature. That creature is creation.
[1:48:05] A spoken word
[1:48:06] creation. That creature is
[1:48:09] himself. It's a person. Eternal life is
[1:48:12] a person. It's not a feeling. It's a
[1:48:15] person. Amen. Do you know this word is
[1:48:19] like everyday living to you?
[1:48:21] Not just church. You're in fellowship
[1:48:24] every day. Fellowshipping with him in
[1:48:25] your soul.
[1:48:28] What a union. What a fellowship. Then
[1:48:31] getting together, traveling together,
[1:48:33] meeting together,
[1:48:36] fellowship. God loves it. And it's so
[1:48:39] simple. It's as simple as coming down
[1:48:42] and not magnificent questions and ask
[1:48:44] his children, Adam and Eve, are you are
[1:48:46] you happy today? Did you have a good
[1:48:47] time today?
[1:48:49] Are you enjoying your stay here? Yes,
[1:48:53] father. Fellowship.
[1:48:57] Simple. That's how simple. I like the
[1:48:59] way a brother brought that. I'm just
[1:49:01] repeating kind of what he said. But it's
[1:49:03] good. It's
[1:49:05] simple. If you're in Christ, do you know
[1:49:08] this word is like everyday living to
[1:49:09] you? Why? Sure. It's yours. It's yours.
[1:49:12] It's
[1:49:14] yours. How many say amen? It's mine.
[1:49:17] Amen.
[1:49:19] Amen. And Lord, let me come under your
[1:49:22] obedience to your word. Let nothing, I
[1:49:25] don't care what it is, let nothing stand
[1:49:26] in your way. If there's anything in your
[1:49:29] way from taking your full position, it's
[1:49:31] an it's a spirit of
[1:49:35] idolatry. I didn't say you're an
[1:49:37] idolatrous. I said it's a spirit of it
[1:49:39] trying to take and position something
[1:49:41] before you, standing in your way from
[1:49:43] taking your place that God called you
[1:49:45] to.
[1:49:48] Amen. And I think he showed us where
[1:49:50] your place
[1:49:52] is. This is the bride's
[1:49:55] position. Why, sure, it's yours. You are
[1:49:58] an eagle. It's yours. You're an eagle.
[1:50:01] That's your food. Amen. God bless you.
[1:50:04] If I've run a little over time, forgive
[1:50:06] me, Brother Paul. You know what? I know
[1:50:08] he
[1:50:11] will. You know
[1:50:13] what? Let's live from our soul.
[1:50:17] Let's hear what he says, not what others
[1:50:20] think. Amen. What does he want me to do?
[1:50:23] It's not that we don't care. See, the
[1:50:26] devil comes back. Well, you just don't
[1:50:27] care. You just don't care. I beg your
[1:50:30] pardon. He's a liar. I do care. But I
[1:50:33] will obey my Lord over my feeling and
[1:50:35] over what others
[1:50:37] think. Amen. Amen. That rubs the flesh
[1:50:41] the wrong
[1:50:42] way. Okay. Hey, I want to sing a song
[1:50:44] and we're dismissed.
[1:50:47] Amen. And I'm going to ask brother Alex
[1:50:51] if you'll come up. Let's sing this song.
[1:50:53] On Christ the solid rock. On Christ the
[1:50:56] solid revelation. Amen. I stand. Amen.
[1:51:00] Amen. Where's your stand today?
[1:51:03] Amen. On Christ the solid rock. You
[1:51:06] don't know how to play that one. What is
[1:51:08] it? Oh, what? Okay. I'm sorry. The F.
[1:51:12] You wanted the key. F.
[1:51:13] Okay. Amen. My hope is built on nothing
[1:51:19] less than Jesus blood and
[1:51:24] righteousness. I dare not try. Notice
[1:51:28] sweetest frame but holy lean. On Jesus
[1:51:35] name on Christ the solid rock I stand.
[1:51:41] All other ground is sinking
[1:51:45] sand. All other ground is sinking
[1:51:50] sand. When darkness seemed to hide his
[1:51:55] face, I rest on his unchanging grace. In
[1:52:01] every high and stormy gale, my anchor
[1:52:07] holds with it. Is your anchor holding
[1:52:10] within the vehill? On Christ the solid
[1:52:14] rock I stand. All other ground is
[1:52:19] sinking
[1:52:20] sand. All other ground is sinking
[1:52:26] sand. His oath his cough. Remember the
[1:52:30] blood carries life. Support me in the
[1:52:34] whelming flood. In all around my soul
[1:52:39] gives way. He then is all my hope and
[1:52:45] stay. On Christ the solid rock I stand.
[1:52:51] All other ground is sinking
[1:52:55] sand. All other ground is sinking
[1:53:00] sand. Then he shall brother sister we've
[1:53:05] already heard the sound. Oh may I then
[1:53:08] in him be found dressed in his
[1:53:13] rightous. Amen. Foughtless to stand
[1:53:18] before the
[1:53:19] throne. On Christ the solid rock I
[1:53:24] stand. All other ground is sinking sand.
[1:53:30] All other ground is sinking sand. You
[1:53:35] know, verse four is a little out of
[1:53:39] time. That trumpet we've heard
[1:53:44] and his righteousness is life alone.
[1:53:47] Faultless to stand before the throne.
[1:53:49] No, it's faultless to stand. We are
[1:53:51] faultless now. Yeah. And we aren't
[1:53:54] standing before the throne. We will for
[1:53:56] reward but not for his white throne
[1:53:59] judgment.
[1:54:01] We we sit in his throne and white throne
[1:54:03] judgment.
[1:54:05] Amen. There's two judgments here that
[1:54:06] people
[1:54:07] mix. There's a judgment that that is
[1:54:11] reward for your service. You've already
[1:54:13] done made it, but he's going to judge
[1:54:15] you by your works. What is the reward to
[1:54:18] this? Did you serve me? See, you don't
[1:54:21] lose your salvation. You're not cast
[1:54:23] away there.
[1:54:25] [Music]
[1:54:27] Amen. That's right. But you may not hear
[1:54:30] it was well done, my good and faithful
[1:54:32] servant. Brother Bram said, "That's one
[1:54:34] thing I want to hear there. It was well
[1:54:37] done." Amen. Amen. So, thank God for the
[1:54:40] opening of the word that we can see. God
[1:54:42] bless you. God be with you, Brother
[1:54:45] Alex.
[1:54:49] [Music]
[1:54:57] delivery.
[1:54:58] Did it go well?
[1:55:00] Praise the Lord. It's good to hear,
[1:55:04] [Applause]
[1:55:06] man. We'll continue to pray for Yes.
[1:55:10] continue to pray for recovery and uh
[1:55:12] just to bless them all. Um let's sing

[1:55:32] Sweeping over the mountain, over the
[1:55:35] hills he
[1:55:38] runs. I long to hear his voice. I long
[1:55:43] to hear him say, "Arise, my loved, my
[1:55:47] fair one, come

[1:56:25] vineyard blossoms for its harvest
[1:56:30] time. Keep your eyes on things above.
[1:56:34] Don't look at me or you see that lovely
[1:56:38] one. He's coming in plain
[1:56:43] view. It's manifesting time. The fruits
[1:56:48] are on the vine and the lovely one is

[1:57:09] view in the cliff of the rock. In the
[1:57:14] secret place so high till the day break
[1:57:18] and the shadows flee
[1:57:23] away in that mountain place. A sweet
[1:57:27] smells coming through. He's that lovely

[1:57:36] view. It's manifesting time. The fruits

[1:58:09] Sweeping over the mountains, over the
[1:58:12] hills he
[1:58:15] runs. I long to hear his voice. I long
[1:58:20] to hear him say, "Arise, my love, my
[1:58:25] fair one, come away."
[1:58:29] It's manifesting time. The fruits are on
[1:58:34] the vine and the lovely one is coming in
[1:58:39] plain
[1:58:41] view. Oh to God's chosen
[1:58:45] bride. Redemption draw with nigh. He's
[1:58:49] that lovely one. He's coming in plain
[1:58:53] view. Chorus one more time. Oh, it's
[1:58:57] manifesting time. The fruits are on the
[1:59:01] vine and the lovely one is coming in
[1:59:06] plain
[1:59:08] view. Oh, to God's chosen
[1:59:11] bride. Redemption draw with nigh. He's
