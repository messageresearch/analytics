[32:19] amen isn't wonderful we can say Amen to
[32:22] that
[32:23] amen
[32:25] I just want to
[32:28] make this a little announcement before I
[32:31] I forget
[32:33] I've pondered this prayed about it and I
[32:36] believe just for the sake of timing the
[32:38] efforts that are involved with
[32:40] Thanksgiving that we will not have a
[32:44] Wednesday night service directly
[32:46] proceeding
[32:48] Thanksgiving uh
[32:51] you know through the years it's it's
[32:53] always been just very hard for me to
[32:56] cancel a service I
[32:58] I just it's a long story some of you
[33:01] know it but it just kind of goes against
[33:03] the grain but
[33:05] just uh realizing all the preparations
[33:09] and things that would be will we will
[33:12] cancel Wednesday and we'll meet again
[33:13] the coming Sunday after Thanksgiving of
[33:17] which
[33:19] um
[33:19] our brother David
[33:21] uh we'll be ministering this Sunday
[33:23] after Thanksgiving so we have a little
[33:26] schedule there that will come out I have
[33:29] something I just want to share very
[33:30] quickly I thought about reading the
[33:32] whole thing to you but sister Andrea
[33:35] sent me uh um an email today and
[33:39] um just a lovely lovely email you know
[33:43] we shared the other day how God was
[33:45] touching those cancer markers and
[33:47] decreasing all of that and and it's
[33:50] continuing amen God is still just doing
[33:54] a mighty work in her body and she just
[33:57] asked me to thank you as a church for
[34:00] praying for her for remembering her and
[34:02] and let's be faithful in that to just
[34:05] continue uh to remember our sister
[34:08] Andrea you know
[34:10] um
[34:11] the devil would just love
[34:13] but remember as we spoke the other day
[34:16] he comes as a roaring lion we've got our
[34:19] own lion we don't need him and um you
[34:22] know the word's been spoken
[34:24] Christ is our healer amen we don't have
[34:28] to look or trust to anything else we can
[34:32] trust to him and so she just sends her
[34:35] greetings and her thank yous and we just
[34:39] want to continue to send our prayers up
[34:42] on her behalf and all of the sisters
[34:44] that we had been praying for that have
[34:47] these issues thank you so much and I
[34:50] don't want to embarrass her but
[34:52] um it's just really awesome to see our
[34:54] our sister vika
[34:56] God's given her a great gift
[34:59] consider blessed to receive that let's
[35:02] turn in our Bibles I want to speak to
[35:04] you again on the the title or general
[35:07] thought of the war within and the war
[35:09] without
[35:11] and uh you know this all comes directly
[35:16] um as inspiration that comes there's
[35:18] actually several sermons that brother
[35:20] Brown preaches along the same line but
[35:22] the greatest battle ever fought uh just
[35:25] comes right in there and uh we're we're
[35:28] seeing we're seeing that actually coming
[35:31] to pass right now and and I'll get into
[35:34] it if the Lord leads into the service a
[35:37] little further but truly the greatest
[35:39] bottle ever fought
[35:41] is not entirely confined to the
[35:44] spiritual world
[35:45] and so it is there that the age that we
[35:48] live in is a bombarding of spirits uh it
[35:53] is uh all all of the advertisements all
[35:56] of these kind of things are all designed
[35:59] to to catch your attention to catch
[36:03] something in that now those of you that
[36:05] might have focused this years ago uh you
[36:08] know they proved that in this Cinema
[36:10] when they were playing the the Prelude
[36:14] or whatever you call it to the show
[36:16] there would be images that were too fast
[36:19] for the mind or the eye to actually
[36:22] catch it
[36:24] but they were projecting images of candy
[36:27] bars and pop and popcorn and whatever
[36:30] and people always like I don't know why
[36:33] when I get you know they go to the
[36:35] theater then I just get this urge to
[36:38] that but it was this subliminal message
[36:40] that was being sent out and while the
[36:43] eye would catch it the Mind couldn't
[36:45] quite identify it but then slowed down
[36:50] it became obvious it was right there
[36:52] every so many frames there was a picture
[36:54] of these things and so I just shared
[36:56] that to kind of lay the groundwork that
[37:01] we're living in an age where Satan is
[37:04] just in his fashion
[37:07] just dumping these things putting them
[37:10] out and they say we don't understand uh
[37:13] uh why this person behaved in this
[37:16] fashion or this well my brother and
[37:19] sister it's under those influences
[37:22] which would be one of the reasons
[37:24] that as Believers I don't believe we
[37:26] should let our children be playing all
[37:28] of these games that are on these devices
[37:31] because I don't think you're going to
[37:33] find any born-again Christians doing you
[37:36] know uh Minecraft or a War of the Worlds
[37:40] or whatever those things are in fact I
[37:42] did some research on that and find out
[37:44] that one of the most popular writers of
[37:47] those games is is a drug addict who
[37:51] constantly would just get himself as
[37:53] high as he could get and still function
[37:55] and then stay up for 36 hours straight
[37:59] under an anointing and write those games
[38:01] and we just have to be careful let's
[38:04] turn in our Bibles to Second Corinthians
[38:06] if we would this evening it's just so
[38:08] good to see each and every one of you
[38:10] and you know just uh like you to
[38:14] remember
[38:15] I think about them very often our
[38:19] brother John sister Joanna down I
[38:22] believe it is San Jose or Fresno or
[38:25] wherever they're at somewhere between
[38:27] here and there and and all of the
[38:31] Believers down there we just ask you to
[38:33] remember them in prayer our brother
[38:35] Prashant and sister akonsha uh when when
[38:39] they can have been fellowshipping with
[38:41] them it's a pretty good drive I think
[38:43] three or four hours but there's some
[38:46] interaction and so you know we know
[38:48] Sister Jerry and I know brother John
[38:50] sister Joanna and we just ask you just
[38:53] remember them and the Saints down there
[38:54] in prayer
[38:56] now I want to have you you're going to
[38:59] have to jump
[39:01] from thought to thought tonight
[39:03] and I've tried to
[39:06] trim this down so that it doesn't drag
[39:09] out forever second Corinthians 4 10.
[39:12] through 12.
[39:14] always a bearing about in the body the
[39:17] dying of the Lord Jesus that the life
[39:20] also of Jesus might be made manifest and
[39:25] in my notes I have enlarged the word in
[39:28] quite large
[39:30] it's a very key element of our thought
[39:32] tonight
[39:33] that Jesus might be made manifest in our
[39:37] body
[39:38] for we which live are always delivered
[39:40] unto death for Jesus sake that the life
[39:43] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[39:47] our mortal flesh so then death worketh
[39:51] in us but life in you
[39:55] Heavenly Father we just ask you to bless
[39:58] the thought tonight help us Lord Lord
[40:00] just to be focused and we just ask the
[40:03] Lord Now guide us in your name amen you
[40:06] may be seated
[40:10] I just want to put this in a context now
[40:13] this is just how Paul thinks so if it
[40:16] doesn't come across just quite right uh
[40:19] you know just bear with me but you know
[40:22] when we pray for the Saints in the
[40:24] Ukraine we need to also remember all of
[40:27] the Believers
[40:29] um in those regions
[40:31] um it's not just Ukraine but on the
[40:34] Borderlands and even into the country
[40:35] all of the Believers in Russia and the
[40:38] bordering countries there there's just
[40:40] been a tremendous need and Believers
[40:43] that are in um these other countries are
[40:46] are you know giving a a lot to help the
[40:50] Believers taking families in and and
[40:53] these kind of things so let's just
[40:55] expand that boundary that border to all
[40:58] of the Believers in in the whole region
[41:01] because as we're thinking this has been
[41:03] very much on my mind uh just in the way
[41:06] that I I wrote my notes here now brother
[41:09] Branham in the greatest battle ever
[41:11] fought lays out the platform you might
[41:13] say that we can see clearly how that
[41:17] when the Warfare there was a choice of a
[41:19] Terrain for the Warfare that Satan he
[41:24] really desired to bring it into the mind
[41:26] he saw that that would be a very great
[41:29] place a very successful place for him to
[41:33] bring in the Warfare and so he he chose
[41:36] as it is to take the Warfare of the Mind
[41:39] knowing that if he can Captivate the
[41:42] mind he also gets the body but as I
[41:44] spoke to you on along this subject here
[41:47] of a few Wednesdays ago the flash does
[41:52] not matter at all he's after the soul he
[41:54] he wants the soul the flesh is just uh
[41:57] you might say a byproduct of what the
[41:59] Warfare is and what it's about and so as
[42:03] Satan has come he he chooses the mind
[42:06] because the mind is kind of you might
[42:09] say control Central and uh so as we look
[42:12] at the Battleground external uh how that
[42:16] Warfare is very destructive very
[42:18] devastating and we see how that Satan my
[42:22] brother and sister he has invaded so
[42:24] deep he looked out and he thought you
[42:27] know what
[42:28] I can affect generations to come if I
[42:32] can bring separation or divorce into a
[42:34] family it won't just affect that man and
[42:37] woman but it will affect children and
[42:39] those children then will have a scar and
[42:42] it will be that much easier for me to
[42:44] come and Scar them even deeper because
[42:48] they won't know how to trust they won't
[42:50] know how to to just put themselves
[42:52] completely into a relationship and that
[42:55] affects us spiritually also that people
[42:58] who cannot trust have a very hard time
[43:01] and when it comes even in the spiritual
[43:03] realm to trust God and so he looks at
[43:07] that and he says you know now if I can
[43:09] come and and the scripture says that he
[43:11] is our healer so if I can come and touch
[43:15] these uh Believers if I can come and uh
[43:19] when they're expecting or yearning or
[43:21] longing and crying out for healing if I
[43:24] can just come in and I can interfere
[43:28] just a little bit and so it's in that
[43:31] realm my brother and sister that he
[43:33] would come and just leave just this
[43:36] slightest slightest smidge of doubt
[43:40] or fear
[43:42] knowing that will interfere
[43:45] knowing that will hinder
[43:47] and uh you know it's there that he he
[43:50] would come and um in so many Fashions we
[43:53] won't go through them tonight you can
[43:55] just look at all of the things that are
[43:57] of humanity that Satan does not have to
[44:00] come and and uh completely rip something
[44:03] apart to make it ineffective uh you know
[44:07] sister Sue bought me a book quite some
[44:09] time back and I I got around to reading
[44:11] it and it was of the great spies uh and
[44:16] saboteurs of World War II and and
[44:19] actually I found a lot of uh very very
[44:22] inspiring things in there spiritually
[44:25] but uh one of the stories was how a man
[44:29] who was a spy just found work clothes
[44:32] put them on found a wheelbarrow and just
[44:35] started pushing it down the road and
[44:37] they come along and says what are you
[44:39] doing and he said oh I'm a laborer
[44:41] looking for work and they said well here
[44:44] is this Factory over here go over there
[44:47] and work and he went in there and he had
[44:49] in hidden in his clothes a special
[44:51] powder that was kind of a a super super
[44:55] fine grit and so he got him a job
[44:59] assigned to an area where they put all
[45:00] the bearings and he just went and every
[45:03] so many bearings he would do he would
[45:06] just rub a little of that grit on the
[45:08] bearing and then they could not
[45:10] understand as the trucks were leaving uh
[45:13] it was a truck Factory as the trucks
[45:15] were leaving some within a hundred miles
[45:17] some after a few weeks but they would
[45:19] grind to a halt because you see he
[45:22] didn't need to pour rocks and gravel and
[45:24] metal filings it was just the finest
[45:27] almost invisible to the eye is all he
[45:30] had to apply and it brought that to a
[45:33] halt and and it caused me to stop and
[45:36] think about how that Satan comes in our
[45:39] lives and he doesn't have to pour out
[45:41] you know great big things into our life
[45:44] but if he can pour out something of the
[45:46] finest that would would come at a
[45:48] certain day at a certain time down the
[45:51] road and would bring us to a place that
[45:53] we would come and we would start to
[45:55] doubt or fear would rise up in us and
[45:58] circumstances around us we'd lose our
[46:00] trust and it would be in such a fashion
[46:03] that when we as Christians come to a
[46:05] halt then Satan can just come in as it
[46:08] were and ravaged that person because
[46:10] they're not moving forward spiritually
[46:12] and so is that in this we look how that
[46:16] the Battleground external can be a great
[46:20] thing and let me just bring this to you
[46:22] also that the Battleground external
[46:25] Satan knows how whether it would be of
[46:27] the perversion of the world in magazines
[46:30] and and Etc but Satan knows how
[46:32] externally to assault you that it would
[46:36] be the prophet of God now people would
[46:38] sometimes cringe at Brothers Paul's way
[46:40] of looking at this but as the prophet of
[46:42] God is talking about hanging that little
[46:44] crucifix from Izmir and he says when you
[46:48] would look out there he says then I
[46:50] would turn I would look at the cross
[46:52] hanging there now my brother and sister
[46:54] I'm not implying anything negative
[46:56] please don't misunderstand
[46:59] but it wasn't like the prophet was blind
[47:01] to that woman on the street
[47:07] are you with me
[47:10] but he knew what he had to do
[47:14] so Satan throws these things external
[47:19] and if one's not careful he gets caught
[47:21] in that the second look the third look
[47:23] and condemnation comes and Liberty is
[47:26] taken away stripped for a season as it
[47:29] were and so we look at this these things
[47:31] sometimes that people think oh that was
[47:34] just a little story the prophet of God
[47:36] told you stop you read it again you pray
[47:39] over it those little stories are sermons
[47:42] in their own self
[47:44] they are there as in samples for us to
[47:47] recognize as he is speaking what is
[47:50] taking place and to know that if Satan
[47:53] can externally he will throw the very
[47:55] same thing back against you and I and so
[47:58] it's there that if we can grasp the the
[48:01] warfare that's taking place and this is
[48:04] why my brother and sister in Warfare you
[48:07] don't want all new fresh officers you
[48:09] want old veterans we want old brothers
[48:12] old sisters that would be able to say
[48:15] you know what we have been through this
[48:17] we have saw this please don't go there
[48:20] take a different route look at it
[48:22] differently because we need that in the
[48:25] body of Believers it is not just a fresh
[48:27] crop going on but God mingling our
[48:31] elders as it were with us right down to
[48:33] our babies to bring a mixture together
[48:36] that brings a successful church because
[48:40] in the outside realm external we then
[48:43] can fight again since those things with
[48:46] experience and with confidence
[48:49] not worried about all will this work or
[48:52] not you'll have and and you say what do
[48:54] you mean by oh old veterans or Elders my
[48:57] brother and sister it's not necessarily
[48:59] age that makes you Elder
[49:03] but if someone is discouraged
[49:07] in a position of their healing
[49:09] you need someone who has been healed
[49:13] amen
[49:15] you don't need to have a whole group of
[49:17] people speculating whether God Is A
[49:19] Healer or not that's why God puts these
[49:23] Elders as it were or even young people
[49:25] that have been healed they put them in
[49:28] the body so that when someone says I've
[49:31] been praying for healing someone can
[49:33] rise up and say remember God healed me
[49:37] and I'm telling you this might be a
[49:40] little Stark or whatever but my brother
[49:42] and sister you get a group of men mixed
[49:45] in age together and you're going to find
[49:47] that somewhere if people are on us there
[49:50] will be a brother that will say I have
[49:52] something I'm fighting and they're in
[49:55] that little group will be a brother what
[49:57] rise up and say God gave me victory over
[50:00] that you can do it brother keep pressing
[50:03] the battle
[50:04] and so God makes this mixture of the
[50:07] body of Believers so that there's always
[50:09] a witness on the scene
[50:12] God will never leave us without a
[50:15] witness Can someone say thank you Lord
[50:18] amen and so it's there that we are able
[50:21] to see in the external now my brother
[50:24] and sister it's interesting this
[50:26] magazine showed up after we're already
[50:28] well into this but I I received a a farm
[50:33] publication that I've been subscribed to
[50:35] for probably 30 years and partly because
[50:38] it's free
[50:39] but um this issue they send me it's
[50:42] about Mental Health
[50:46] they get right down to it
[50:48] they don't patty cake this thing
[50:51] now you say why do you bring that up
[50:52] brother Paul
[50:54] because there's some things in our lives
[50:57] that have a stigma
[51:01] and we as humans it's not just to mental
[51:04] health there's a lot of things
[51:06] sometimes there's sin in our life that's
[51:08] a stigma
[51:11] and the Articles talking about how
[51:14] that mental of Health affects people in
[51:17] such a fashion they can't even make
[51:19] decisions
[51:20] can't hardly get out of bed in the
[51:21] morning sometimes struggle to do the
[51:24] simplest task because one it wrongs them
[51:27] of all confidence of what they're doing
[51:28] uh it robs them of all of awareness of
[51:32] where they really fit in the picture and
[51:34] it demeans them and lowers their
[51:36] self-worth and I thought isn't that just
[51:39] like the devil
[51:40] that is just like the devil he comes in
[51:43] he wants you to look at yourself in the
[51:46] beer and say I couldn't possibly be a
[51:48] Son of God I couldn't possibly be a
[51:51] daughter of God and to young people to
[51:53] children say I I can't even see what
[51:56] they're talking about do I even try and
[51:59] Satan muddying this off and bringing in
[52:01] such a fashion that at the end what he's
[52:04] trying to do is take an external battle
[52:06] interior
[52:08] he's trying to bring it into an inner
[52:11] battle and when he can get that battle
[52:13] down in the Realms my brother and sister
[52:15] of the spiritual elements of our life
[52:17] then Satan's goes to work and it's a
[52:20] matter of time and it sometimes as a
[52:23] brother just shared with me the other
[52:24] day a little deal sometimes it takes two
[52:27] three four years for Satan's work to
[52:30] come down and cut his way all the way
[52:32] down to the soul but that's where he's
[52:34] going my brother and sister
[52:36] you know as the scripture says we'd be
[52:38] better to go to heaven I'm kind of
[52:40] enlarging this we'd be better to go to
[52:42] heaven missing an arm a hand an eye
[52:45] not able to hear not able to speak we'd
[52:48] be better to go down than to go whole
[52:50] and be lost
[52:53] and Satan knows if he can come in there
[52:55] and maim the spirit
[52:59] so he takes the battle in
[53:02] inside
[53:05] and the similarities my brother and
[53:07] sister are so close
[53:10] destruction
[53:13] devastation
[53:15] collateral damage
[53:20] sometimes people who are never touched
[53:22] by the Warfare are traumatized
[53:24] the rest of their lives
[53:30] just by the experience
[53:34] we'll touch on that I hope I can just
[53:36] get going here
[53:39] touch on that is what the prophet said
[53:41] now I'm going to skip over some things
[53:43] tonight so I just need you to just kind
[53:45] of grasp a whole to this and see where
[53:47] I'm going
[53:51] very costly to win a war
[53:55] now everybody's just guessing
[53:57] but I was looking at an article it was
[54:00] talking about
[54:01] how much that Russia has spent so far
[54:04] and how much Ukraine has spent so far
[54:07] and you go back and correlate that with
[54:09] what United States spent in Vietnam
[54:12] and these different things and war is
[54:15] costly
[54:16] not only in the lives of men and women
[54:19] and the collateral but just cold Hard
[54:22] Cash it's costly
[54:24] and you look at this and realize that to
[54:27] win a war
[54:28] is is very expensive
[54:32] but I want to just bring this so that I
[54:35] don't lose your thoughts tonight I want
[54:36] to just bring this right along and we'll
[54:38] go into Ephesians 3 16. and as we look
[54:42] at this my brother and sister to win a
[54:44] war is very costly
[54:46] a price equal
[54:48] to what
[54:50] he says in Ephesians 3 16 he said that
[54:53] he would Grant you according to the
[54:56] riches of his glory
[54:59] not putting a price back to fleshly
[55:02] things or carnal things but he's viewing
[55:05] or tying you and I in a Warfare back to
[55:08] the riches of his glory
[55:12] my if one's soul is worth ten thousand
[55:14] worlds my brother and sister I think
[55:16] I've shared with you before I once had a
[55:18] business calculator that went out to
[55:20] like 10 or 12 places and I just started
[55:23] in in encyclopedia at the GDP and this
[55:27] is many years ago the GDP alphabetically
[55:30] of countries and I started just putting
[55:32] them into the calculator I didn't get
[55:34] very far down the list and the number
[55:36] was too big for a 10 Place calculator
[55:40] just give you an idea that the wealth of
[55:42] the world
[55:44] is a lot
[55:46] and then God said that ain't enough I'm
[55:48] going to times it by 10 and declare
[55:51] that's what you are worth
[55:53] when Satan would come and try to tell
[55:55] you you're worthless you're not worth
[55:57] the effort you're not worth anything God
[56:00] wouldn't even think of you throw that
[56:02] back at the Devil and tell him Satan
[56:04] until you could come up with the wealth
[56:08] of 10
[56:09] 000 worlds don't even open your mouth
[56:15] come on it's time for us to be bold on
[56:17] these things don't even open your mouth
[56:19] because you don't got it you couldn't
[56:21] even come down as a near Kinsman and
[56:25] redeem because you were afraid of what
[56:27] it would cost you
[56:31] my
[56:35] are you with me
[56:37] to be strengthened with might by his
[56:40] Spirit see now it's no longer exterior
[56:44] it's no longer an outward battle
[56:48] God's coming along and he's going to
[56:51] strengthen You by his spirit in the
[56:54] Inner Man
[56:55] that's what we need my brother and
[56:57] sister I got no problem with the
[56:59] brothers that exercised don't
[57:01] misunderstand that but we don't need
[57:04] external strength we need strength in
[57:07] the Inner Man we need strength down in
[57:10] the realm of the soul that we can stand
[57:12] solid and not be shoved around by every
[57:15] wind of Doctrine and not be uh finding
[57:18] ourselves confused by people saying no
[57:20] that's not what it is it's this it's
[57:22] that the strength of the inner man will
[57:25] take you to the heart of the word
[57:29] that Christ May dwell in your hearts
[57:32] by faith that ye being rooted and
[57:35] grounded in love
[57:38] you know interesting it doesn't even lay
[57:40] it down to Doctrine
[57:43] theology
[57:48] my eyes not been actually bothering me
[57:50] it's been bothering my wife but I wake
[57:53] up in the mornings my eye is just
[57:55] totally blood red bloodshot
[57:58] she finally said
[58:00] I'm making an appointment you're going
[58:02] to go you know how that is it's okay
[58:04] wives for you to be that way because men
[58:07] can be stubborn
[58:09] anyway so I went in there to the doctor
[58:11] this morning
[58:14] and uh
[58:16] you know I'm sure glad he didn't have a
[58:19] bunch of patients this morning because
[58:20] he's like so your wife said something to
[58:24] the to the receptionist and you guys are
[58:27] going somewhere and so I I tell him you
[58:30] know we're going to Israel and and we
[58:33] talked for probably 40 minutes on
[58:35] spiritual things
[58:37] and um he had books he says oh somebody
[58:40] told me to read this book he said and
[58:42] you know I thought well why are you
[58:44] telling me all the name and author of
[58:45] the book if you don't want me to read it
[58:47] but anyway we talked about these things
[58:49] and these things of the holy land and
[58:51] all of this stuff and and he he was like
[58:54] you know and I'm reading a book right
[58:56] now about how they're making the case
[58:58] that it
[59:00] um it wasn't the Romans that killed
[59:02] Jesus but I said I I would I would agree
[59:06] with that
[59:07] but his reasoning was wrong
[59:11] and he says well no the author means
[59:13] it's like this or had to be like a
[59:15] conspiracy
[59:17] because if the Jews had killed Jesus
[59:19] they would have stoned him
[59:22] and I thought okay I'm not going to get
[59:25] down to the niceties but I threw this
[59:27] one at him
[59:30] prophecy
[59:31] house to be fulfilled
[59:34] there's just no way we can say oh this
[59:37] will change this you know could be a
[59:39] different way prophecy must be fulfilled
[59:44] now my brother and sister the prophet of
[59:45] God says you need to recognize yourself
[59:48] in the word of God now prophecy might
[59:51] not put your surname there it might not
[59:54] put all of the you know middle names
[59:56] there but it speaks to the spirit of
[59:59] Sons and Daughters of God and identifies
[1:00:02] them as Revelation comes out of the book
[1:00:04] it it stirs the heart of a son or
[1:00:07] daughter of God that they can say he's
[1:00:09] talking about me
[1:00:11] and it's in that realm then we stop and
[1:00:14] say you know what if I'm in the book
[1:00:16] there's prophecy concerning me and that
[1:00:19] prophecy must come to pass
[1:00:21] and I stand on that and I say thank you
[1:00:24] Lord and the prophet of God comes along
[1:00:26] and drives it home and says he won't
[1:00:30] lose a single one
[1:00:33] and the devil's there saying you have no
[1:00:35] value you have no value you have no
[1:00:37] value I'm sorry regardless of what my
[1:00:40] value is the word said he won't lose me
[1:00:44] oh my brother and sister
[1:00:48] reminds me of a story some young men in
[1:00:51] the military we were in a beach in a
[1:00:53] foreign country on taking some leave
[1:00:55] time or whatever and one of them found
[1:00:57] an old coin and and he thought oh look
[1:01:00] at this look at this this is an old coin
[1:01:02] and he went to a coin dealer
[1:01:05] and the coin dealer says yes
[1:01:07] they made those out of every kind of
[1:01:10] metal and stamped that little Insignia
[1:01:13] on it and yours is not even worth a
[1:01:16] nickel
[1:01:19] do you want to change
[1:01:23] you see my brother and sister it doesn't
[1:01:25] matter
[1:01:27] the young man says no when was this coin
[1:01:30] made and they told them the date quite
[1:01:33] some time back
[1:01:35] he said it has value to me
[1:01:39] because I found it
[1:01:42] then the coin dealer says well I'll give
[1:01:44] you a few dollars for it
[1:01:46] no you don't understand this coin is
[1:01:48] taken on value to me
[1:01:50] something that wasn't worth it worth
[1:01:52] making change for is suddenly
[1:01:55] allow you and Satan would come and say
[1:01:57] your
[1:01:58] value or not couldn't be in God's
[1:02:00] economy being who you are and stumbling
[1:02:02] around like you have and making mistakes
[1:02:04] but God looked down and says I don't
[1:02:07] care about any other kind of value the
[1:02:10] value resides in what it is to me
[1:02:13] no and the devil would like us to
[1:02:15] believe we're nothing to Christ but the
[1:02:17] word says we're everything
[1:02:20] amen
[1:02:23] may be able to comprehend with All
[1:02:25] Saints what is the breadth and length
[1:02:27] and depth and height and to know the
[1:02:29] love of Christ which passes All Passes
[1:02:33] knowledge that you might be filled with
[1:02:35] all the fullness of God now unto him
[1:02:38] that is able to exceeding abundantly
[1:02:39] above all that we ask or think according
[1:02:42] to the power that worketh
[1:02:44] in US
[1:02:47] this message my brother and sister
[1:02:51] is external to some
[1:02:55] wife daughters you are gonna do this
[1:02:59] Sons you are going to be like this and I
[1:03:02] will be like this
[1:03:05] external
[1:03:07] but when the word ever gets down on the
[1:03:10] inside
[1:03:12] when the battle for the outside is put
[1:03:14] to the side and I say truly put the
[1:03:17] battle for the outside to the side and
[1:03:19] look to the inside and when it gets to
[1:03:22] the inside a man doesn't have to tell
[1:03:24] his wife how to dress a man doesn't have
[1:03:27] to tell his daughters how to dress a man
[1:03:29] doesn't have to tell his son what
[1:03:31] conduct that he should we should teach
[1:03:33] it but still there's something there
[1:03:35] that says this is it and when that is
[1:03:38] taken and the intrinsic value of that is
[1:03:41] recognized my brother and sister Satan
[1:03:44] has nothing to offer you he has nothing
[1:03:46] he can give to you that you would
[1:03:49] exchange for that
[1:03:54] unto him be glory in the church by
[1:03:56] Christ Jesus throughout all ages World
[1:03:59] Without End Amen so this is showing that
[1:04:04] as God took this battle to the inside
[1:04:08] we don't find much in this scripture
[1:04:10] there in the New Testament really
[1:04:12] dealing exterior
[1:04:18] when you boil it all down my brother and
[1:04:20] sister it is just a very small amount
[1:04:22] that deals with the outer man because
[1:04:25] God knew if he can ever capture the
[1:04:28] Inner Man the inner man will capture the
[1:04:32] outer man
[1:04:33] oh we can dress right we can look right
[1:04:36] we can walk right we can talk right we
[1:04:38] can do all of that but the scripture
[1:04:40] says they come as ravening wolves
[1:04:43] so the exterior doesn't even matter
[1:04:47] God's looking to the inside
[1:04:51] oh Hallelujah
[1:05:00] I hope you don't mind I think I'll just
[1:05:03] step over a few things that basically
[1:05:05] are just reiterating that
[1:05:09] in the Great and Mighty conquer
[1:05:15] brother Brown puts it like this before
[1:05:17] any Victory can be won
[1:05:19] there must be great prices paid
[1:05:23] oh what prices
[1:05:26] and sometimes they are very deep
[1:05:29] and they make great scars tearing down
[1:05:33] but in order to have the mountain
[1:05:37] we've got to have the valley
[1:05:40] now I want you to think about Warfare
[1:05:44] you cannot hold the Heights in Warfare
[1:05:48] without being able to defend the valley
[1:05:53] and we say oh Lord just let me live in
[1:05:55] the heavenlies up in the mountaintops
[1:05:58] without any challenge without any no you
[1:06:01] see my brother and sister to hold the
[1:06:03] top
[1:06:05] you have to be able to defend the valley
[1:06:12] Lord
[1:06:14] not
[1:06:15] my will
[1:06:17] but thy will
[1:06:20] what are you doing
[1:06:22] you are ruling
[1:06:27] by offense and defense in the same
[1:06:32] Lord if you want me to live in Heavenly
[1:06:34] places then you have to allow me to make
[1:06:37] it through the valley
[1:06:39] to rise to Heavenly places
[1:06:41] this is why Saints
[1:06:44] I'm deviating just a little bit but this
[1:06:46] is why you will see people whose
[1:06:48] relationship goes from revival to
[1:06:51] Revival to Revival to Revival because
[1:06:55] they're not able to defend the valley
[1:06:59] are you with me you got to be able to
[1:07:03] move from The Mountaintop through the
[1:07:05] valley to the next Mountaintop intact
[1:07:10] if everything you have and everything
[1:07:11] that you are is destroyed at every
[1:07:14] Valley you come to then you cannot ride
[1:07:17] the next Mountain Victorious
[1:07:20] so God wants you to be able to defend
[1:07:22] yourself in the Valley now I don't think
[1:07:25] any of us tonight would raise a hand and
[1:07:27] say I just love going through the valley
[1:07:30] valleys are my specialty
[1:07:32] no sir
[1:07:35] lofty grandeur
[1:07:38] is the specialty
[1:07:41] I know where I can stand and the Eagles
[1:07:43] are flying
[1:07:45] and I can see and all its peace and
[1:07:48] tranquility
[1:07:50] but you see God didn't just
[1:07:52] no let me back up because actually God
[1:07:54] did
[1:07:55] make you to fly in the heavenlies I was
[1:07:58] kind of thinking in a different
[1:07:59] direction but God made you to fly in the
[1:08:02] heavenlies
[1:08:04] but you have to be able to fly down the
[1:08:08] valley also
[1:08:11] we've got to have the valley before we
[1:08:13] can have the sunshine we've got to get
[1:08:15] the rain
[1:08:17] for we can have the light we've got to
[1:08:19] get the night before we can have right
[1:08:21] they had to have wrong or you could have
[1:08:24] never known what wrong was but in order
[1:08:26] to conquer and to win the greatest
[1:08:29] battle that was ever won one stepped out
[1:08:32] of Glory oh aren't you glad tonight one
[1:08:35] stepped out of glory and said you know
[1:08:37] what I'm a veteran of this Warfare I
[1:08:40] know how to overcome these things and
[1:08:42] I'm gonna show you how to be the
[1:08:45] Overcomer the Conqueror and I'm going to
[1:08:48] show you the tactics of the enemy
[1:08:51] oh sorry I get a little excited tonight
[1:08:54] but you see my brother and sister one
[1:08:56] stepped out of Glory many years ago and
[1:08:59] he did not take upon himself the form of
[1:09:01] an Angel
[1:09:03] he did not come as some great person but
[1:09:06] he was going to prove that it don't take
[1:09:08] muskets and bullets and atomic bombs to
[1:09:11] win a war
[1:09:12] Hallelujah aren't you glad tonight we
[1:09:15] don't have to have a little pocket nuke
[1:09:17] briefcase nuke they have different terms
[1:09:20] for them my brother and sister we don't
[1:09:22] have to have that God has said I'll take
[1:09:24] you through Valley I'll take you to the
[1:09:26] middle of the mountain I'll take you to
[1:09:28] the top of the mountain if you ever want
[1:09:31] to find a scriptural or spiritual
[1:09:34] connection in that you look at lot and
[1:09:36] his daughters and they fled and they
[1:09:39] went down and they dwelled in the city
[1:09:41] for a while and even the city was too
[1:09:43] Wicked for a lot but where was the
[1:09:45] downfall at my brother and sister it
[1:09:48] wasn't in the total complete debasement
[1:09:50] of the valley they made it part way up
[1:09:53] the mountain found a cave in backslid
[1:09:55] right there
[1:09:57] God never intended for us to just get
[1:09:59] halfway to the Mountaintop
[1:10:01] halfway to an overcoming experience
[1:10:04] halfway to being conquerors
[1:10:06] and look what he did it brought about
[1:10:08] Moab which in the end Satan used to
[1:10:11] bring a downfall to Israel
[1:10:17] he did not come
[1:10:19] atomic bombs to win a war he clothed
[1:10:21] himself in humility like a little baby
[1:10:24] was born in a manger
[1:10:26] isn't that awesome my brother and sister
[1:10:29] I look at that and I say oh Lord I keep
[1:10:32] telling myself Lord I've got to do this
[1:10:33] and I've got to do that
[1:10:35] I don't got to do nothing but surrender
[1:10:38] I've got to just say Lord here I am
[1:10:40] reporting for Duty here I am whatever it
[1:10:44] is I want you to go crawl through the
[1:10:45] mud yes sir
[1:10:50] um
[1:10:51] come on and take you back into a into a
[1:10:54] few things here I hope you don't mind
[1:10:56] but you look and and there's a movie
[1:10:59] that's been made about it there's books
[1:11:00] written about it but a man named Colonel
[1:11:02] Hal Moore in Vietnam trained his
[1:11:05] soldiers I believe they were in Georgia
[1:11:07] Florida somewhere down there there were
[1:11:09] swamps anyway and he trained them so
[1:11:11] hard those men talked amongst themselves
[1:11:14] we ought to just kill this guy when he's
[1:11:16] you know went to the bathroom throw a
[1:11:18] grenade in there and get this over with
[1:11:19] everybody else has gotten you know easy
[1:11:22] everybody else is doing he made them
[1:11:24] wear full packs crawl through real mud
[1:11:26] with their gun in front of them and when
[1:11:28] they come out the other end their gun
[1:11:30] better be clean
[1:11:31] and Men hated him for it
[1:11:34] but they get sent to Vietnam
[1:11:37] and they came home from that war
[1:11:40] with the least casualties of any
[1:11:42] battalion
[1:11:44] that went there
[1:11:47] and Men come
[1:11:49] after married and starting families
[1:11:52] they found him and they thanked him
[1:11:55] because their name wasn't on a black
[1:11:58] marble wall in Washington D.C
[1:12:05] sometimes God says
[1:12:07] I'm gonna let you crawl in the mud for a
[1:12:09] little while
[1:12:11] I'm going to load you down with so many
[1:12:13] burdens you don't even think you can
[1:12:16] move and then I'm going to demand that
[1:12:18] you move
[1:12:19] and we're going to say Lord what are you
[1:12:21] doing to me making you a conqueror
[1:12:25] bringing you through the war
[1:12:27] that you would come one day and say
[1:12:29] thank you Lord
[1:12:31] thank you Lord I'm alive today
[1:12:41] there was not even a place for his birth
[1:12:43] when he came come
[1:12:46] I want you to look at the different
[1:12:47] material of warfare
[1:12:50] what he used now Adam's race was all in
[1:12:54] bondage
[1:12:55] there they were without hope without god
[1:12:57] without chance without Mercy without
[1:12:59] anything that could help them the great
[1:13:02] enemies of the lower regions of the Lost
[1:13:04] had them shut up in darkness
[1:13:07] now that seems my brother and sister are
[1:13:09] a different way to describe somebody
[1:13:11] that's just caught up in sin
[1:13:15] come on
[1:13:17] oh it's just a little sin no you're
[1:13:19] caught up in the outer regions of
[1:13:20] Darkness
[1:13:22] that's really how we correlate this
[1:13:25] problem is we have become tolerant that
[1:13:28] we were like that was just we don't even
[1:13:31] call it a gray lie I was a little white
[1:13:33] lie
[1:13:35] see how Satan's so tricky
[1:13:37] he's God is lying and whitewashing it
[1:13:41] and we don't even think it matters
[1:13:43] but the reality of it is at that point
[1:13:46] without repentance
[1:13:48] it's the outer regions of Darkness
[1:13:52] the prophet of God gave me a license to
[1:13:55] preach a little harder than I have been
[1:13:58] because he was talking
[1:14:00] about those preachers that were cowards
[1:14:03] because they wouldn't preach
[1:14:05] the word
[1:14:07] and I went and looked in the mirror and
[1:14:09] said I am not a coward
[1:14:13] so now I got to prove it
[1:14:17] had them shut up in darkness is not a
[1:14:20] way out it was no one could help nothing
[1:14:22] could be done it looked like a total
[1:14:24] complete loss but our hero I like this
[1:14:28] the world's always looking for Heroes
[1:14:30] they need a hero they got one right in
[1:14:32] their midst the greatest hero ever but
[1:14:34] he's not the kind of hero they're
[1:14:36] looking for but our hero amen can we say
[1:14:39] that together but our hero
[1:14:43] who came down from the portals of Glory
[1:14:45] condescending down for there was no man
[1:14:48] on Earth could do the job they were all
[1:14:50] as worldly speaking in the same boat we
[1:14:53] were all born in sin shaped in iniquity
[1:14:55] come to the world speaking lives and
[1:14:57] none of us could help each other
[1:15:01] hmm yes look at that none of us could
[1:15:04] help each other
[1:15:05] we stood helpless defeated
[1:15:08] Chaos on every hand
[1:15:10] you know this seems this is a brother
[1:15:13] shared with me
[1:15:15] it's been back a little while he shared
[1:15:18] with me he says you know Paul
[1:15:19] when I'm preaching a youth meeting
[1:15:21] convention
[1:15:23] he said I can tell the kids that were
[1:15:25] raised in the message
[1:15:28] from the kids whose families converted
[1:15:31] come into the message
[1:15:34] and he says it's a lot harder to preach
[1:15:37] to the kids raised in the message
[1:15:43] because they don't really know what sin
[1:15:45] is
[1:15:46] right oh they got caught with their
[1:15:48] fingers in the cookie jar
[1:15:50] but they don't understand it's it's a
[1:15:52] little harder for them to grasp that I
[1:15:56] was born in sin
[1:15:58] period that's just the whole thing I
[1:16:00] didn't have to go out and sin I was born
[1:16:03] into that and I was shaped in iniquity
[1:16:10] and I come forth Just naturally
[1:16:12] I mean you'll never find a parent saying
[1:16:16] now little Bobby
[1:16:18] when I'm in the other room
[1:16:21] you sneak over here and take cookies
[1:16:24] and when I ask you if you took cookies
[1:16:26] you tell me no
[1:16:29] any parent ever trained their kid like
[1:16:31] that
[1:16:32] no sir but Mom rounds the corner near a
[1:16:36] beeline to the cookie jar they know
[1:16:38] exactly what she wasn't stealing cookies
[1:16:41] but the other day if I walk in the
[1:16:44] kitchen and at first I don't know what
[1:16:45] she is doing and she's over there and
[1:16:47] she opens one drawer and pulls it way
[1:16:50] out then pulls the next drawer out and
[1:16:52] then when she was standing on top of the
[1:16:54] counter
[1:16:55] I'm like
[1:16:56] that's how that works
[1:16:59] yeah
[1:17:00] now when I was a kid we always lived in
[1:17:02] houses if you'd have stepped on that
[1:17:04] first drawer it would have splintered
[1:17:05] and it would have been disc
[1:17:09] and we were smart enough to not do that
[1:17:13] but you look Little Johnny Bobby Fred
[1:17:16] Sue whatever
[1:17:18] it's just in them
[1:17:20] come on let's admit it Saints it's just
[1:17:22] Dennis
[1:17:23] just Dennis
[1:17:25] that's why we all need a conversion
[1:17:28] amen
[1:17:31] yep
[1:17:33] we come down look at this my brother and
[1:17:35] sister
[1:17:36] seemed like the whole human race laid
[1:17:38] waste and then he come he come down
[1:17:40] because he was in the beginning the
[1:17:42] Bible said he was the word he was the
[1:17:44] logos that went out of God and the logos
[1:17:47] in the beginning was the word and he
[1:17:50] became the word then when he ascended up
[1:17:54] on that glorious day of Easter he become
[1:17:56] not only the word but he I look at this
[1:17:59] come on catch this I hope it stirs your
[1:18:01] heart he became the high priest of his
[1:18:04] own word
[1:18:06] oh my when we go before the high priest
[1:18:10] to tell them Lord I'm sorry for these
[1:18:12] things what are we doing we're not
[1:18:14] talking to somebody off in a room
[1:18:15] somewhere here is now the judge the jury
[1:18:19] everything all in one and he says as the
[1:18:23] high priest I am in charge I am the one
[1:18:27] that accepts the indictment I'm the one
[1:18:30] that gives the pardon
[1:18:32] know how beautiful that is my brother
[1:18:34] and sister he became the word
[1:18:38] then we need to send it up on that
[1:18:40] glorious day not only the word become
[1:18:43] the high priest of his own word and what
[1:18:45] a glorious thing brother Neville just
[1:18:47] think he's not only the word but he is
[1:18:49] the high priest of his own word how
[1:18:52] could we doubt it how could we walk to
[1:18:54] him and not believe that we receive what
[1:18:57] we ask for
[1:18:58] the very one that make the promise the
[1:19:01] very one that can fulfill the promise
[1:19:04] and the Very one that will will manifest
[1:19:06] that promise right out in our flesh as
[1:19:09] we read earlier is right there how could
[1:19:12] we not
[1:19:14] oh not receive what we asked for
[1:19:17] oh my this was a really long quote and
[1:19:20] at first I was going to cut it off but I
[1:19:22] was just it's just too good I gotta
[1:19:24] gotta gotta read it amen for he is the
[1:19:27] word
[1:19:28] and the intercessor
[1:19:31] of the word
[1:19:33] the logos become word and the word made
[1:19:35] flesh in the same flesh that was the
[1:19:38] word received up into glory and now is
[1:19:40] the high priest making intercession by
[1:19:42] himself to his word that's what it takes
[1:19:45] that's a lot deeper saying so I hope you
[1:19:47] don't just gloss over that as a you know
[1:19:49] a word Trail
[1:19:51] that's deep right there that's you
[1:19:54] having personal access to the very
[1:19:58] Throne of God
[1:20:00] oh we don't got to go through the
[1:20:02] preacher we don't got to go through a
[1:20:03] priest we don't got to go through you
[1:20:05] know Mecca as it were we have a direct
[1:20:08] line amen that little girl I don't know
[1:20:11] if she lives down there in Louisiana but
[1:20:13] she was down there singing that a direct
[1:20:15] line to the throne room
[1:20:17] yeah I don't know if any of you ever
[1:20:19] heard that but if you haven't go on uh
[1:20:22] what's that girl's name Jerry you
[1:20:24] remember
[1:20:25] Hayley cross
[1:20:27] go go on YouTube find Haley cross listen
[1:20:31] to that I'm telling you every time I
[1:20:33] listen to that song it stirs something
[1:20:36] in me because this little girl singing
[1:20:38] that song that has a direct line to the
[1:20:42] throne room
[1:20:43] oh you can't tell me because I've
[1:20:46] already got that direct line my brother
[1:20:49] and sister what is this that's you and I
[1:20:51] oh no we're not trying to bypass
[1:20:53] anything we're not trying to bypass
[1:20:55] going to church we're not trying to
[1:20:57] bypass the preacher we're not trying to
[1:20:58] bypass you know following the word of
[1:21:01] God no no no no no but God's given you
[1:21:05] a direct line
[1:21:07] to the intercessor
[1:21:09] I'm telling you what my brother and
[1:21:11] sister what's happening in the world we
[1:21:13] live in today and I'm not going to leave
[1:21:14] myself out of this little indictment is
[1:21:17] we are not making enough
[1:21:20] direct line calls
[1:21:23] to the throne room
[1:21:26] we're not asking
[1:21:28] for enough intercession
[1:21:31] reminds me of a little story years ago
[1:21:34] had kind of a deeper meaning to it
[1:21:36] priest is sitting in his confession
[1:21:38] booth young lady walks in one day
[1:21:41] and makes a confession
[1:21:45] concerning
[1:21:46] kind of an important but not really
[1:21:48] important thing and she does her
[1:21:50] confession
[1:21:51] she's back the next day at the
[1:21:52] confession booth and makes pretty much
[1:21:55] the same confession
[1:21:57] and the next day the same confession and
[1:22:00] the next day the same confession
[1:22:03] and the priest says look you've already
[1:22:05] confessed that she goes no I was
[1:22:08] confessing what I did yesterday
[1:22:11] this is a new day
[1:22:16] cute story huh
[1:22:18] except for the prophet of God says we
[1:22:20] backslide
[1:22:22] daily
[1:22:25] not a once a month visit to the throne
[1:22:27] room
[1:22:29] but daily
[1:22:31] and maybe not even daily maybe we
[1:22:33] shouldn't even let 24 hours pass
[1:22:37] I quieted you guys all up my goodness
[1:22:45] by himself to his word that's what it
[1:22:47] takes that's the material that the
[1:22:49] church is God what a weapon there has
[1:22:51] never been one like it he was the word
[1:22:54] and when he come he was born in a manger
[1:22:56] he come to use the weapon of love love
[1:22:59] to conquer the world not with that army
[1:23:01] bullets not with machine guns and tanks
[1:23:04] but he come in a different manner he
[1:23:06] come in the form of love he was God's
[1:23:09] love
[1:23:10] boy I'll tell you what if we're missing
[1:23:12] love my brother and sister you're not
[1:23:13] going to get much further than that cave
[1:23:15] halfway up the mountain
[1:23:16] oh God help us God help us and we're not
[1:23:20] talking about touchy feely love
[1:23:22] we're talking
[1:23:24] rooted in the word rooted in our spirit
[1:23:28] rooted that that we just are going to
[1:23:32] love no matter what
[1:23:35] now how many have ever been offended
[1:23:40] okay the rest of you can lift your hands
[1:23:43] and nothing be ashamed about
[1:23:46] it's hard isn't it
[1:23:49] and I am fairly good at opening my mouth
[1:23:52] and putting my foot in it
[1:23:55] and would leave the door open for some
[1:23:58] things to be taken as
[1:24:00] offense
[1:24:03] but now I want to remind you all
[1:24:06] just in case I have done that
[1:24:08] or I do it
[1:24:10] again
[1:24:11] can anyone tell me how many times you
[1:24:13] have to forgive me
[1:24:20] that's right
[1:24:25] now let's talk about love
[1:24:28] come on
[1:24:30] do we have love
[1:24:32] I'm talking to the bride of Christ
[1:24:33] tonight okay is that is that good we're
[1:24:35] not just talking to humans talking to
[1:24:37] the bride of Christ
[1:24:39] do we have enough love to do that
[1:24:41] Lord help us if we would say no
[1:24:44] let us find
[1:24:46] a place to repent if we say no to that
[1:24:50] and I'm not talking about making a big
[1:24:52] deal out of it just find your time in
[1:24:55] your own room however it works for you
[1:24:58] but you see that's what God's bringing
[1:25:00] us to that our weapon of our Warfare
[1:25:03] is not external
[1:25:07] it is internal
[1:25:11] my brother that I farm with
[1:25:15] always talks because he's a rough Gruff
[1:25:18] hiding that soft mushy interior who he
[1:25:21] is that you can tell him about something
[1:25:23] and he gets tears in his eyes and then
[1:25:25] immediately he's this light
[1:25:28] work
[1:25:29] you know gotta hide it somehow
[1:25:32] but you see my brother and sister
[1:25:35] in this world we live in
[1:25:37] my brother always says quit wearing your
[1:25:41] feelings on your sleeve
[1:25:45] okay I'll put them in my pocket and
[1:25:46] bring him up like a hanky so you can see
[1:25:48] them
[1:25:49] no I don't think that's what it is
[1:25:52] I think that God's working on a Saints
[1:25:54] to bring us to a place
[1:25:56] that it's no longer an exterior Warfare
[1:26:00] but it's down here in the piece and it's
[1:26:03] settled in The Souls of Sons and
[1:26:05] Daughters of God that we can look out
[1:26:07] and say you know they might have meant
[1:26:10] it
[1:26:11] but this test is not about them
[1:26:13] this test is actually about me
[1:26:17] and I'm going to win
[1:26:19] this test I'm gonna I'm gonna overcome
[1:26:23] amen
[1:26:25] praise the Lord
[1:26:28] are we willing to pay a price Saints
[1:26:31] now you look in the message we're almost
[1:26:33] done well you look in the message and um
[1:26:37] brother Branham uses the word betting
[1:26:39] ground
[1:26:41] quite a few times
[1:26:43] and so we'll look at this and I'm just
[1:26:46] going to touch just briefly on this for
[1:26:48] a moment
[1:26:50] imagine
[1:26:53] that the betting ground
[1:26:56] has been planted with good seed
[1:27:01] do you believe we have an exemption that
[1:27:03] says that the wicked one's not going to
[1:27:05] come and plant his seed in that same
[1:27:06] bedding ground
[1:27:09] that would be to say that the word was
[1:27:12] not entirely accurate
[1:27:15] so we have a betting ground that we've
[1:27:17] done our best Mothers you've done the
[1:27:19] best to raise your children can we say
[1:27:21] Amen
[1:27:23] the devil's not going to say they're
[1:27:26] never going to hear rock and roll
[1:27:28] the devil is never going to say I won't
[1:27:31] even bother them because they've been
[1:27:34] raised right
[1:27:35] actually then the Devil comes along and
[1:27:38] says you know what I'm I'm going to go
[1:27:40] in full Warfare
[1:27:43] full Warfare
[1:27:45] because here's a young person
[1:27:48] I love Saints
[1:27:50] I don't know if any of you ever went and
[1:27:52] looked it up
[1:27:53] I love reading about muskox
[1:27:59] can any of you tell me why
[1:28:02] can you remember one of the key elements
[1:28:04] of the muskox
[1:28:08] they always
[1:28:10] shove the weak
[1:28:13] to the center
[1:28:16] and they surround them
[1:28:18] with as it is their horns their heads
[1:28:21] out
[1:28:24] the problem the devil's got people into
[1:28:27] is we take the weak
[1:28:29] and we say you know the wolf might be
[1:28:31] satisfied
[1:28:33] if he gets to devour this one
[1:28:37] well that's well and good right I mean
[1:28:39] after all it's just natural selection
[1:28:41] you know the devil always goes after the
[1:28:43] weakest right
[1:28:47] come on somebody you know better
[1:28:50] the devil goes after whoever he desires
[1:28:53] weak poor strong rich
[1:29:00] but the musk ox
[1:29:02] they never
[1:29:03] they never abandoned their own
[1:29:07] wolves surround them
[1:29:09] try to entice them to go out and if
[1:29:12] you've ever watched anything like that
[1:29:14] they'll go out a few steps but they
[1:29:16] realize their safety is in the body
[1:29:20] and they come right back to their
[1:29:22] position why because look at this now
[1:29:24] God gave this Instinct I think for them
[1:29:26] to be an example in the spiritual world
[1:29:29] that it's not just them that will be
[1:29:31] damaged if they go out after to prove
[1:29:34] the message and they go out there and
[1:29:37] then the wolf devours them they've now
[1:29:39] left a hole as it were in the body that
[1:29:42] the Wolves will then uh try us they're
[1:29:45] luring this out they try to Dart in
[1:29:46] behind until that hole is closed
[1:29:49] that's why the body of Believers Satan
[1:29:52] says
[1:29:52] um I'll throw some offense in there
[1:29:55] draw somebody out they become angry I
[1:29:57] don't want to go to church with them
[1:29:58] they don't love me they're not far what
[1:30:00] is he doing he's leaving a hole in there
[1:30:02] he's not only got that when he's left a
[1:30:04] hole into the body that he can come into
[1:30:06] and so it's there my brother and sister
[1:30:08] the musk ox recognize us their
[1:30:11] protection
[1:30:12] is to not look
[1:30:15] at the hinder most parts
[1:30:17] of the other muskox
[1:30:22] but always
[1:30:24] oh
[1:30:25] I don't know why I drifted off into this
[1:30:27] but it's not going to be me back here
[1:30:30] going well brother Trevor you know
[1:30:32] brother Trevor's brother Trevor
[1:30:35] but it's me standing right here brother
[1:30:37] Trevor
[1:30:40] we'll just watch The Wolf together
[1:30:43] we'll Stomp The Wolf together
[1:30:47] you wanna kinda put a cheeseburger on
[1:30:50] whether I get him or you get him
[1:30:56] see never looking at the hinder most but
[1:30:58] always standing together
[1:31:00] saying I'm sorry yep double you're right
[1:31:03] you're right he didn't do that correct
[1:31:05] but I'm still going to stand shoulder to
[1:31:07] shoulder with my brother
[1:31:09] with the body of believers
[1:31:11] oh my
[1:31:13] see the betting ground produces fear or
[1:31:15] faith
[1:31:16] that's the Simplicity of it you can just
[1:31:18] boil it right down if you want what the
[1:31:20] prophet of God said it produces fear or
[1:31:22] faith
[1:31:23] and now we're down to our last quote
[1:31:25] here
[1:31:26] amen
[1:31:27] well that's the matter with our
[1:31:29] Pentecostal faith today
[1:31:32] we've let too many things hinder it the
[1:31:35] faith that we've been taught the Holy
[1:31:37] Spirit that's been living
[1:31:38] in US
[1:31:41] we've let too many things looking at
[1:31:44] somebody else
[1:31:48] well I'm sure I could live an overcoming
[1:31:50] life
[1:31:51] if everybody else would live an
[1:31:52] overcoming life
[1:31:54] well let yourself be the first if
[1:31:57] there's no one else you be the first
[1:32:03] we let too many things looking at
[1:32:04] somebody else and the devil is always
[1:32:06] trying to point you to somebody's
[1:32:08] failure
[1:32:09] but he tries to keep you away from the
[1:32:11] real testimony that's genuine he'll
[1:32:14] point you to a hypocrite sometimes who
[1:32:17] went out impersonating something he
[1:32:19] didn't do it because he was
[1:32:21] impersonating
[1:32:22] this was kind of the root of what I
[1:32:24] started in the start of the service
[1:32:25] right we've made this circle around that
[1:32:28] we need those in our midst that have
[1:32:30] overcome we need those in our midst that
[1:32:32] have been healed we need those in our
[1:32:34] midst that have went through absolute
[1:32:36] fiery trials because they are not
[1:32:39] impersonators my brother and sister and
[1:32:42] when they tell you our God heals then
[1:32:45] you can understand sure is our God Is A
[1:32:48] Healer it's right here and when there's
[1:32:50] Deliverance someone brother sister would
[1:32:52] say God delivered me we can go to the
[1:32:55] bank with that and say you know what
[1:32:57] God's right here in our midst still
[1:33:00] delivering
[1:33:02] people are like well you know they just
[1:33:04] this isn't happening and that didn't
[1:33:06] happen like where
[1:33:08] probably at your house it's not because
[1:33:10] you have
[1:33:12] fear of faith and you gave up Faith and
[1:33:15] settled on fear
[1:33:17] and fear never accomplished anything
[1:33:20] what is that acronym they use for fear
[1:33:23] um
[1:33:25] false evidence appearing real
[1:33:27] my a lot of things that seem to appear
[1:33:30] real today my brother and sister
[1:33:32] yeah you better believe that Abraham
[1:33:35] Lincoln said on a quote that he put on
[1:33:37] the internet that
[1:33:40] come on we can find all kinds of
[1:33:42] nonsense but what are we doing Satan
[1:33:44] luring real Christians to look at the
[1:33:48] hinder most part of those around them
[1:33:53] I Repent from my statement I made the
[1:33:55] other day that somebody ought to chase
[1:33:57] them Scoundrels down and you know
[1:34:00] investigate their life and
[1:34:02] slam it in their face I I Repent from
[1:34:05] that that's not right
[1:34:08] I just read today the prophet said you
[1:34:10] know Judas is Ministry
[1:34:13] was a holy ghost Ministry
[1:34:19] God checked me I thought yep I would get
[1:34:21] all this evidence run over there and
[1:34:23] smack him in the face and they would be
[1:34:24] doing the will of God
[1:34:27] and I would be the one that would be out
[1:34:28] of the will
[1:34:30] I'll just withdraw I feel accept my
[1:34:32] apology for that one because that was
[1:34:34] unwise to stay say there no
[1:34:39] but if it come from a true source of the
[1:34:41] word of God heavens and earth will pass
[1:34:44] away but my word cannot pass away it's
[1:34:46] got to stay there you see it Sis it must
[1:34:50] be accepted in the mind then it's
[1:34:52] believed with the heart
[1:34:55] hallelujah sister Emmy would you come
[1:34:58] Hallelujah
[1:35:03] I hope that
[1:35:04] my little ramble
[1:35:06] the last few days through the word of
[1:35:08] God
[1:35:09] spoke to you tonight
[1:35:12] you see my brother and sister the devil
[1:35:15] wants to lure you
[1:35:17] into the fight on his ground
[1:35:21] but we've been given
[1:35:24] the word
[1:35:27] and the way to use it
[1:35:32] you realize some of the Roman
[1:35:34] legionnaires
[1:35:37] because there was a certain amount of
[1:35:39] prestige that come with those they had
[1:35:42] conquered
[1:35:43] some
[1:35:47] legionnaires that were maybe not of good
[1:35:50] moral character
[1:35:52] would find someone to fight them
[1:35:54] that was of a lesser skill
[1:35:57] and it made them look good because it
[1:36:00] comes out with everything he comes out
[1:36:02] with the helmet the breastplate you know
[1:36:05] all of the armor on the legs and and
[1:36:08] everything and the sword in his hand but
[1:36:10] because he has no experience it doesn't
[1:36:14] take long for that man to conquer him
[1:36:17] and then that man looks
[1:36:20] looks important looks great can count
[1:36:23] his victories
[1:36:26] I could just preach it or I could
[1:36:28] plagiarize it and you probably wouldn't
[1:36:30] figure it out but I don't like to do
[1:36:32] that
[1:36:33] brother Danny Stevens preached a sermon
[1:36:36] some time back and he drives home the
[1:36:39] point
[1:36:41] before Satan Lucifer ever got to the
[1:36:44] Earth
[1:36:45] come on grasp this before he ever got to
[1:36:49] the Earth
[1:36:51] he'd already been conquered
[1:36:56] he got
[1:36:57] got out of heaven
[1:37:00] by our hero Hallelujah
[1:37:04] come on Saints when the Devil comes a
[1:37:06] roaring just remind him sorry my hero My
[1:37:10] Heroes already kicked you out and you're
[1:37:13] already defeated
[1:37:16] oh I'll tell you what I love that my
[1:37:18] brother and sister I don't have to stand
[1:37:20] try and say well if I was a little more
[1:37:23] spiritual if I was a little more than
[1:37:24] this no sir I just get a stand with my
[1:37:27] hero he's already conquered him amen
[1:37:30] aren't you glad to serve a God Like That
[1:37:32] amen one to come in our time of need
[1:37:35] amen let's just stand and just worship
[1:37:38] for a minute or two
[1:37:42] I love you Lord
[1:37:46] oh
[1:37:48] now I would just ask you just to follow
[1:37:50] the directive as it were
[1:37:53] of the song
[1:37:55] would that be too much for Paul to ask
[1:37:56] you
[1:37:58] I love you Lord
[1:38:00] and
[1:38:02] I lift
[1:38:04] [Music]

[1:38:17] foreign
[1:38:19] [Applause]
[1:38:22] [Music]

[1:38:46] and watch you hear
[1:38:52] Let It Be Our sweets
[1:38:56] [Music]

[1:40:05] want to see you

[1:40:09] walls with a roof

[1:40:14] great men that we have known in there
[1:40:17] are those great men

[1:40:47] asking for permission can I go to the
[1:40:49] throne can I go to the throne you're
[1:40:51] going to hear a voice echo through the
